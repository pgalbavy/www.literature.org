<p>When Simon Kenton was left alone by the missionary, who had been
the means of bringing about this hostile meeting, he knew that
a full hour must pass before his mortal enemy, The Panther, would
reach the spot. The ranger was in need of sleep, and he did a
thing which, while the most sensible act he could perform under
the circumstances, was certainly extraordinary; he sat down on
the ground, with his back against a tree, closed his eyes in slumber,
and did not open them again until the hour had passed. He possessed
that ability, which almost any one can acquire, of awaking at
any time previously fixed upon.</p>

<p>Day was breaking, its light steadily spreading and diffusing
itself through the surrounding forest and filling the summer sky
with an increasing glow. Kenton deliberately arose, drank from
the neighboring river, bathing his hands and face in it, and then
sauntered to the spot where he expected to meet the dusky miscreant
who was equally eager to cross weapons with him. Leaning his rifle
against a tree, the ranger took a position and attitude in which
nothing could approach or pass without being noted by him.</p>

<p>"The parson is the best man in the world," he mused; "there ain't
another white man that dare go visitin' 'mong the varmints like
him, for they trust him just as his own kith and kin do.</p>

<p>"When I seed him walk out of the wood, right by them other varmints
and straight up to The Panther, I was sartin it was all over with
him, and he was in for his last sickness sure. The Panther had
just had things slip up on him in a way that must have made him
mad enough to bite off his own head, but the parson fixed it,
and The Panther and me are bound to meet this time.</p>

<p>"There must be something in that thing which he preaches," continued
the ranger, musingly, "which ain't like other things. What he
says hits one so powerful hard that it makes me feel quar. It
makes him love the varmints, the black people and the white all
alike; it makes him leave his home and spend days or weeks in
the wood, just as Boone done afore he brought his family to Kentucky.</p>

<p>"What did the missionary mean by tellin' me a brave man is merciful?
I wonder whether he had any talk with The Panther? It would be
just like him to do so, but it was time throwed away. Howsumever,
his words to me stick in my ears, and keep going back and forth
as nothin' that was ever said to me afore has done.</p>

<p>"The Panther is full of grit; when he comes I'll make him b'leve
I think he was scared and run off. That'll make him so mad, he'll
fight harder than ever, which is what I want.</p>

<p>"But he'll fight like a wounded catamount, He is sure he'll wipe
me out and send me under this time, and that he can go on shootin'
settlers in the back, tomahawking women and children without stoppin'
to bother with me. Somehow or other I don't feel as sartin in
this matter as afore, but I wouldn't let this chance of closing
accounts with The Panther pass by for the whole of Kentucky&mdash;sh!
there he comes!"</p>

<p>A rustle, such as a quail might have made in walking over the
leaves, caused the ranger to turn his head like a flash. The undergrowth
parted, and Wa-on-mon, chief of the Shawanoes, stepped into full
view hardly ten feet distant, with his glittering eyes fixed upon
the face of the ranger.</p>

<p>The coarse black hair dangled about the shoulders, with a couple
of strands hanging loosely over the chest. Three stained eagle
feathers projected backward from the crown, where the hair was
stained with several hues of paint. The hard, sinister features
displayed the same fantastic daubs that marked them when The Panther
was a prisoner on the flatboat, the white cross showing on the
forehead, with streakings of red and black on the cheeks and chin.
The coppery chest was bare to the waist, where reposed the single
weapon of the chieftain&mdash;his formidable hunting knife, which had
committed many a dark deed when wielded in the vicious grip of
the dusky miscreant.</p>

<p>Below the breech-clout the iron limbs were encased in leggings
and the small feet were covered with moccasins, now faded and
worn by hard usage. The Panther paused, with his left foot in
advance, his right hand grasping the hilt of his knife at his
waist, and his shoulders and head thrust forward, the attitude
of the body being that of an athlete with his muscles concentrated
for a leap across a chasm that yawns in front of him.</p>

<p>The pose of Kenton was dissimilar, and yet showed some points
of resemblance. In accordance with the custom of his people, he
carried his knife, in a small scabbard, by a string over his left
breast. He grasped the handle, ready to whip it out on the first
need. He did not mean that his antagonist should "get the drop"
on him.</p>

<p>Kenton stood with his feet well together, but separated enough
to give his attitude grace and strength. His coonskin cap, fringed
hunting shirt, leggings and shoes were such as were commonly worn
by people of his calling. He was taller, more sinewy and equally
active with the Shawanoe, upon whom his blue eyes were fixed with
burning intensity and a glow that was the "light of battle" itself.</p>

<p>The Panther had brought no weapon except his knife with him.
The rifle of the ranger rested against a tree several paces away,
and as near the Indian as the white man. It was a strange position
for two mortal enemies, thoroughly distrusting each other, but
in neither case did it imply a lessening of that distrust; it
simply attested the faith of the two in a third person &mdash;Missionary
Finley. He had arranged this meeting, and both believed in him.</p>

<p>A scornful smile lit up the thin, smooth, handsome face of Kenton,
who, with his fingers still clasping the haft of the weapon at
his breast, said in the Shawanoe tongue:</p>

<p>"The Panther meets his enemy at last, but does he bring no warriors
with him to hide among the trees and rush forward when he begs
for mercy from the white man?"</p>

<p>This question was meant for the cutting taunt it proved to be,
for it was a strange fashion on the frontier, when two enemies
came face to face in deadly encounter, for each to try to goad
the other to the point of what may be termed nervousness before
the critical assault took place.</p>

<p>"The Panther needs no one to help him bring the dog of a white
man to his knees," replied Wa-on-mon, holding his passion well
in hand.</p>

<p>"Then why, Shawanoe, did you run away when a short time since
you promised to meet me by the splintered tree near the clearing?"</p>

<p>"The dog of a white man speaks as a fool! He knows that Wa-on-mon
hastened to find his brave warriors, that the pale-faces should
not be allowed to make their way to the fort. He found them, and
they shall never get there."</p>

<p>"The Shawanoes have tried to stop them, but could not; they tried
last night, and more than one of the dogs were brought low. The
gun that leans against the tree there did its part, as it shall
continue to do. The Shawanoes fled as children, and I leaped ashore
and chased them, but they ran too fast for me to catch them."</p>

<p>This was drawing it with a long bow, but as we have intimated,
it was in accordance with the fashion of the times. The chieftain
restrained his temper better than would have been expected, for
the reason that he understood the motive of his enemy; it was
the contest preliminary to the decisive one.</p>

<p>"Why did not the white dogs all come ashore and chase the Shawanoes?"
he asked, with little appearance of passion in voice or manner.</p>

<p>"One of them did&mdash;a little child&mdash;you, dog of a Shawanoe, made
captive the child and strode back among your warriors, proud and
boastful because it was the first prisoner you ever took. Oh,
brave Shawanoe! Oh, mighty chieftain!"</p>

<p>While uttering these taunts, Kenton did not permit the slightest
"sign" to escape him. He saw he was fast goading his foe to the
resistless point, the object he had in view. There was an almost
insensible tightening of the muscles of the fingers closing around
the handle of the knife, the faintest possible quiver passed through
the thighs, or showed in a single twitch of the toes of the left
foot, which inched forward. The Panther gave a quick inhalation,
and while the words recorded were in the mouth of Kenton, he hissed:</p>

<p>"Die, dog of a pale-face!"</p>

<p>At the same time he bounded forward, as does the animal whose
name he bore when leaping upon his prostrate foe. The intervening
space was cleared at the single leap, and the knife, whipped from
the girdle at the instant of starting, made a fierce sweep through
the air, almost too quick for the eye to follow, and shot like
the head of a rattlesnake at the breast of the ranger.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it clove through vacancy, for Kenton recoiled a
single step, the hundredth part of a second before the weapon
flashed in front of his face, and struck with equal power and
swiftness at the crouching demon while yet in mid-air; but nothing
could have surpassed the dexterity of The Panther, who, by a flirt
of the head, dodged the blow, and dropping like a cat upon his
feet, not only endeavored to strike the white man in the back,
but came within a hair of succeeding. It need hardly be said that
had he done so, the conflict would have been over on the instant.</p>

<p>But Kenton saved himself, and faced about to receive the assault
from the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Instead of following up the slight and yet possibly fatal advantage
thus obtained, The Panther became more guarded in his attack.
The opening bout made both more cautious; their respect for each
other's prowess was increased.</p>

<p>Neither uttered a syllable; the taunts had ended; there was no
call to goad each other to fury, for the highest point of passion
was already attained. To spend breath in the utterance of words
was to place themselves in the position of the gymnast who breaks
into laughter&mdash;it would be a fatal weakening of strength.</p>

<p>The Panther, crouching low, clutching knife, with head thrust
forward, and gleaming eye fixed on his victim, began slowly circling
around him, on the watch for an opening that would permit him
to bound forward and strike his foe to the earth.</p>

<p>Standing thus in the centre of a circle, Kenton had but to turn
slowly so as to keep his face turned toward his assailant. It
was the easiest thing in the world to present indefinitely an
unassailable front, and yet The Panther had barely completed his
first circuit when the opening which he sought offered itself,
and he seized it with lightning-like quickness.</p>

<p>But it was presented purposely; Kenton incited the attack, and
when the Shawanoe demon shot through the air toward him, he steadied
himself for a second, and struck again with all the might and
skill at command.</p>

<p>That which the ranger had not counted upon, or which was not
likely to happen once in a thousand times, intervened to save
The Panther for the single instant. He and Kenton struck precisely
the same blow, and their forearms glanced against each other.
The stroke of the white man was the more powerful, and impinging
against the less muscular arm of the Shawanoe with paralyzing
force, sent his knife spinning twenty feet away among the undergrowth.
Before the agile Shawanoe could recover himself the left hand
of Kenton griped his throat, he was borne furiously backward,
hurled to the ground as though he were an infant, the knee of
the ranger was at his breast, and the knife was held ready to
complete the fearful work.</p>

<p>"Dog of a Shawanoe!" hissed the infuriated hunter, "you are conquered
at last! Now beg for mercy!"</p>

<p>Had the positions of the two been reversed, the prostrate foe
could not have been more defiant when he hissed back, with flashing
eye:</p>

<p>"Dog of a pale-face, that is afraid to strike!"</p>

<p>The words were meant as a taunt to the ranger to do his worst.</p>

<p>Down deep in the heart of every being, no matter how degraded,
how sinful, how wicked, how merciless, is a spark of goodness
which, when fanned by the angel's breath, glows or spreads until
it burns out all the dross that years of wrong-doing have implanted
there. Why it was and how it came about, Simon Kenton to his dying
day never fully understood, but he always insisted that at that
moment he heard the voice of Missionary Finley, with unmistakable
distinctness, in his ear:</p>

<p>"Show him mercy, and mercy shall be shown to you when you need
it!"</p>

<p>Impelled by a power which he dared not resist, the ranger rose
from the chest of The Panther, and said in tones that sounded
like those of another person:</p>

<p>"Shawanoe, take your life; I give it to you!"</p>
