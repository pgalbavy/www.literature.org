<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Since that first night I had never clapped eyes on Sandy. He
had gone clean out of the world, and Blenkiron and I waited anxiously
for a word of news. Our own business was in good trim, for we
were presently going east towards Mesopotamia, but unless we learned
more about Greenmantle our journey would be a grotesque failure.
And learn about Greenmantle we could not, for nobody by word or
deed suggested his existence, and it was impossible of course
for us to ask questions. Our only hope was Sandy, for what we
wanted to know was the prophet’s whereabouts and his plans. I
suggested to Blenkiron that we might do more to cultivate Frau
von Einem, but he shut his jaw like a rat-trap.</p>

<p>"There’s nothing doing for us in that quarter," he said. "That’s
the most dangerous woman on earth; and if she got any kind of
notion that we were wise about her pet schemes I reckon you and
I would very soon be in the Bosporus."</p>

<p>This was all very well; but what was going to happen if the two
of us were bundled off to Baghdad with instructions to wash away
the British? Our time was getting pretty short, and I doubted
if we could spin out more than three days more in Constantinople.
I felt just as I had felt with Stumm that last night when I was
about to be packed off to Cairo and saw no way of avoiding it.
Even Blenkiron was getting anxious. He played Patience incessantly,
and was disinclined to talk. I tried to find out something from
the servants, but they either knew nothing or wouldn’t speak—the
former, I think. I kept my eyes lifting, too, as I walked about
the streets, but there was no sign anywhere of the skin coats
or the weird stringed instruments. The whole Company of the Rosy
Hours seemed to have melted into the air, and I began to wonder
if they had ever existed.</p>

<p>Anxiety made me restless, and restlessness made me want exercise.
It was no good walking about the city. The weather had become
foul again, and I was sick of the smells and the squalor and the
flea-bitten crowds. So Blenkiron and I got horses, Turkish cavalry
mounts with heads like trees, and went out through the suburbs
into the open country.</p>

<p>It was a grey drizzling afternoon, with the beginnings of a sea
fog which hid the Asiatic shores of the straits. It wasn’t easy
to find open ground for a gallop, for there were endless small
patches of cultivation and the gardens of country houses. We kept
on the high land above the sea, and when we reached a bit of downland
came on squads of Turkish soldiers digging trenches. Whenever
we let the horses go we had to pull up sharp for a digging party
or a stretch of barbed wire. Coils of the beastly thing were lying
loose everywhere, and Blenkiron nearly took a nasty toss over
one. Then we were always being stopped by sentries and having
to show our passes. Still the ride did us good and shook up our
livers, and by the time we turned for home I was feeling more
like a white man.</p>

<p>We jogged back in the short winter twilight, past the wooded
grounds of white villas, held up every few minutes by transport-wagons
and companies of soldiers. The rain had come on in real earnest,
and it was two very bedraggled horsemen that crawled along the
muddy lanes. As we passed one villa, shut in by a high white wall,
a pleasant smell of wood smoke was wafted towards us, which made
me sick for the burning veld. My ear, too, caught the twanging
of a zither, which somehow reminded me of the afternoon in Kuprasso’s
garden-house.</p>

<p>I pulled up and proposed to investigate, but Blenkiron very testily
declined.</p>

<p>"Zithers are as common here as fleas," he said. "You don’t want
to be fossicking around somebody’s stables and find a horse-boy
entertaining his friends. They don’t like visitors in this country;
and you’ll be asking for trouble if you go inside those walls.
I guess it’s some old Buzzard’s harem." Buzzard was his own private
peculiar name for the Turk, for he said he had had as a boy a
natural history book with a picture of a bird called the turkey-buzzard,
and couldn’t get out of the habit of applying it to the Ottoman
people.</p>

<p>I wasn’t convinced, so I tried to mark down the place. It seemed
to be about three miles out from the city, at the end of a steep
lane on the inland side of the hill coming from the Bosporus.
I fancied somebody of distinction lived there, for a little farther
on we met a big empty motor-car snorting its way up, and I had
a notion that the car belonged to the walled villa.</p>

<p>Next day Blenkiron was in grievous trouble with his dyspepsia.
About midday he was compelled to lie down, and having nothing
better to do I had out the horses again and took Peter with me.
It was funny to see Peter in a Turkish army-saddle, riding with
the long Boer stirrup and the slouch of the backveld.</p>

<p>That afternoon was unfortunate from the start. It was not the
mist and drizzle of the day before, but a stiff northern gale
which blew sheets of rain in our faces and numbed our bridle hands.
We took the same road, but pushed west of the trench-digging parties
and got to a shallow valley with a white village among the cypresses.
Beyond that there was a very respectable road which brought us
to the top of a crest that in clear weather must have given a
fine prospect. Then we turned our horses, and I shaped our course
so as to strike the top of the long lane that abutted on the down.
I wanted to investigate the white villa.</p>

<p>But we hadn’t gone far on our road back before we got into trouble.
It arose out of a sheep-dog, a yellow mongrel brute that came
at us like a thunderbolt. It took a special fancy to Peter, and
bit savagely at his horse’s heels and sent it capering off the
road. I should have warned him, but I did not realize what was
happening, till too late. For Peter, being accustomed to mongrels
in Kaffir kraals, took a summary way with the pest. Since it despised
his whip, he out with his pistol and put a bullet through its
head.</p>

<p>The echoes of the shot had scarcely died away when the row began.
A big fellow appeared running towards us, shouting wildly. I guessed
he was the dog’s owner, and proposed to pay no attention. But
his cries summoned two other fellows—soldiers by the look of them—who
closed in on us, unslinging their rifles as they ran. My first
idea was to show them our heels, but I had no desire to be shot
in the back, and they looked like men who wouldn’t stop short
of shooting. So we slowed down and faced them.</p>

<p>They made as savage-looking a trio as you would want to avoid.
The shepherd looked as if he had been dug up, a dirty ruffian
with matted hair and a beard like a bird’s nest. The two soldiers
stood staring with sullen faces, fingering their guns, while the
other chap raved and stormed and kept pointing at Peter, whose
mild eyes stared unwinkingly at his assailant.</p>

<p>The mischief was that neither of us had a word of Turkish. I
tried German, but it had no effect. We sat looking at them and
they stood storming at us, and it was fast getting dark. Once
I turned my horse round as if to proceed, and the two soldiers
jumped in front of me.</p>

<p>They jabbered among themselves, and then one said very slowly:
"He ... want ... pounds," and he held up five fingers. They evidently
saw by the cut of our jib that we weren’t Germans.</p>

<p>"I’ll be hanged if he gets a penny," I said angrily, and the
conversation languished.</p>

<p>The situation was getting serious, so I spoke a word to Peter.
The soldiers had their rifles loose in their hands, and before
they could lift them we had the pair covered with our pistols.</p>

<p>"If you move," I said, "you are dead." They understood that all
right and stood stock still, while the shepherd stopped his raving
and took to muttering like a gramophone when the record is finished.</p>

<p>"Drop your guns," I said sharply. "Quick, or we shoot."</p>

<p>The tone, if not the words, conveyed my meaning. Still staring
at us, they let the rifles slide to the ground. The next second
we had forced our horses on the top of them, and the three were
off like rabbits. I sent a shot over their heads to encourage
them. Peter dismounted and tossed the guns into a bit of scrub
where they would take some finding.</p>

<p>This hold-up had wasted time. By now it was getting very dark,
and we hadn’t ridden a mile before it was black night. It was
an annoying predicament, for I had completely lost my bearings
and at the best I had only a foggy notion of the lie of the land.
The best plan seemed to be to try and get to the top of a rise
in the hope of seeing the lights of the city, but all the countryside
was so pockety that it was hard to strike the right kind of rise.</p>

<p>We had to trust to Peter’s instinct. I asked him where our line
lay, and he sat very still for a minute sniffing the air. Then
he pointed the direction. It wasn’t what I would have taken myself,
but on a point like that he was pretty near infallible.</p>

<p>Presently we came to a long slope which cheered me. But at the
top there was no light visible anywhere—only a black void like
the inside of a shell. As I stared into the gloom it seemed to
me that there were patches of deeper darkness that might be woods.</p>

<p>"There is a house half-left in front of us," said Peter.</p>

<p>I peered till my eyes ached and saw nothing.</p>

<p>"Well, for heaven’s sake, guide me to it," I said, and with Peter
in front we set off down the hill.</p>

<p>It was a wild journey, for darkness clung as close to us as a
vest. Twice we stepped into patches of bog, and once my horse
saved himself by a hair from going head forward into a gravel
pit. We got tangled up in strands of wire, and often found ourselves
rubbing our noses against tree trunks. Several times I had to
get down and make a gap in barricades of loose stones. But after
a ridiculous amount of slipping and stumbling we finally struck
what seemed the level of a road, and a piece of special darkness
in front which turned out to be a high wall.</p>

<p>I argued that all mortal walls had doors, so we set to groping
along it, and presently found a gap. There was an old iron gate
on broken hinges, which we easily pushed open, and found ourselves
on a back path to some house. It was clearly disused, for masses
of rotting leaves covered it, and by the feel of it underfoot
it was grass-grown.</p>

<p>We dismounted now, leading our horses, and after about fifty
yards the path ceased and came out on a well-made carriage drive.
So, at least, we guessed, for the place was as black as pitch.
Evidently the house couldn’t be far off, but in which direction
I hadn’t a notion.</p>

<p>Now, I didn’t want to be paying calls on any Turk at that time
of day. Our job was to find where the road opened into the lane,
for after that our way to Constantinople was clear. One side the
lane lay, and the other the house, and it didn’t seem wise to
take the risk of tramping up with horses to the front door. So
I told Peter to wait for me at the end of the back-road, while
I would prospect a bit. I turned to the right, my intention being
if I saw the light of a house to return, and with Peter take the
other direction.</p>

<p>I walked like a blind man in that nether-pit of darkness. The
road seemed well kept, and the soft wet gravel muffled the sounds
of my feet. Great trees overhung it, and several times I wandered
into dripping bushes. And then I stopped short in my tracks, for
I heard the sound of whistling.</p>

<p>It was quite close, about ten yards away. And the strange thing
was that it was a tune I knew, about the last tune you would expect
to hear in this part of the world. It was the Scots air: "Ca’
the yowes to the knowes," which was a favourite of my father’s.</p>

<p>The whistler must have felt my presence, for the air suddenly
stopped in the middle of a bar. An unbounded curiosity seized
me to know who the fellow could be. So I started in and finished
it myself.</p>

<p>There was silence for a second, and then the unknown began again
and stopped. Once more I chipped in and finished it. Then it seemed
to me that he was coming nearer. The air in that dank tunnel was
very still, and I thought I heard a light foot. I think I took
a step backward. Suddenly there was a flash of an electric torch
from a yard off, so quick that I could see nothing of the man
who held it.</p>

<p>Then a low voice spoke out of the darkness—a voice I knew well—and,
following it, a hand was laid on my arm. "What the devil are you
doing here, Dick?" it said, and there was something like consternation
in the tone.</p>

<p>I told him in a hectic sentence, for I was beginning to feel
badly rattled myself.</p>

<p>"You’ve never been in greater danger in your life," said the
voice. "Great God, man, what brought you wandering here today
of all days?"</p>

<p>You can imagine that I was pretty scared, for Sandy was the last
man to put a case too high. And the next second I felt worse,
for he clutched my arm and dragged me in a bound to the side of
the road. I could see nothing, but I felt that his head was screwed
round, and mine followed suit. And there, a dozen yards off, were
the acetylene lights of a big motor-car.</p>

<p>It came along very slowly, purring like a great cat, while we
pressed into the bushes. The headlights seemed to spread a fan
far to either side, showing the full width of the drive and its
borders, and about half the height of the over-arching trees.
There was a figure in uniform sitting beside the chauffeur, whom
I saw dimly in the reflex glow, but the body of the car was dark.</p>

<p>It crept towards us, passed, and my mind was just getting easy
again when it stopped. A switch was snapped within, and the limousine
was brightly lit up. Inside I saw a woman’s figure.</p>

<p>The servant had got out and opened the door and a voice came
from within—a clear soft voice speaking in some tongue I didn’t
understand. Sandy had started forward at the sound of it, and
I followed him. It would never do for me to be caught skulking
in the bushes.</p>

<p>I was so dazzled by the suddenness of the glare that at first
I blinked and saw nothing. Then my eyes cleared and I found myself
looking at the inside of a car upholstered in some soft dove-coloured
fabric, and beautifully finished off in ivory and silver. The
woman who sat in it had a mantilla of black lace over her head
and shoulders, and with one slender jewelled hand she kept its
fold over the greater part of her face. I saw only a pair of pale
grey-blue eyes—these and the slim fingers.</p>

<p>I remember that Sandy was standing very upright with his hands
on his hips, by no means like a servant in the presence of his
mistress. He was a fine figure of a man at all times, but in those
wild clothes, with his head thrown back and his dark brows drawn
below his skull-cap, he looked like some savage king out of an
older world. He was speaking Turkish, and glancing at me now and
then as if angry and perplexed. I took the hint that he was not
supposed to know any other tongue, and that he was asking who
the devil I might be.</p>

<p>Then they both looked at me, Sandy with the slow unwinking stare
of the gipsy, the lady with those curious, beautiful pale eyes.
They ran over my clothes, my brand-new riding-breeches, my splashed
boots, my wide-brimmed hat. I took off the last and made my best
bow.</p>

<p>"Madam," I said, "I have to ask pardon for trespassing in your
garden. The fact is, I and my servant—he’s down the road with
the horses and I guess you noticed him—the two of us went for
a ride this afternoon, and got good and well lost. We came in
by your back gate, and I was prospecting for your front door to
find someone to direct us, when I bumped into this brigand-chief
who didn’t understand my talk. I’m American, and I’m here on a
big Government proposition. I hate to trouble you, but if you’d
send a man to show us how to strike the city I’d be very much
in your debt."</p>

<p>Her eyes never left my face. "Will you come into the car?" she
said in English. "At the house I will give you a servant to direct
you."</p>

<p>She drew in the skirts of her fur cloak to make room for me,
and in my muddy boots and sopping clothes I took the seat she
pointed out. She said a word in Turkish to Sandy, switched off
the light, and the car moved on.</p>

<p>Women had never come much my way, and I knew about as much of
their ways as I knew about the Chinese language. All my life I
had lived with men only, and rather a rough crowd at that. When
I made my pile and came home I looked to see a little society,
but I had first the business of the Black Stone on my hands, and
then the war, so my education languished. I had never been in
a motor-car with a lady before, and I felt like a fish on a dry
sandbank. The soft cushions and the subtle scents filled me with
acute uneasiness. I wasn’t thinking now about Sandy’s grave words,
or about Blenkiron’s warning, or about my job and the part this
woman must play in it. I was thinking only that I felt mortally
shy. The darkness made it worse. I was sure that my companion
was looking at me all the time and laughing at me for a clown.</p>

<p>The car stopped and a tall servant opened the door. The lady
was over the threshold before I was at the step. I followed her
heavily, the wet squelching from my field-boots. At that moment
I noticed that she was very tall.</p>

<p>She led me through a long corridor to a room where two pillars
held lamps in the shape of torches. The place was dark but for
their glow, and it was as warm as a hothouse from invisible stoves.
I felt soft carpets underfoot, and on the walls hung some tapestry
or rug of an amazingly intricate geometrical pattern, but with
every strand as rich as jewels. There, between the pillars, she
turned and faced me. Her furs were thrown back, and the black
mantilla had slipped down to her shoulders.</p>

<p>"I have heard of you," she said. "You are called Richard Hanau,
the American. Why have you come to this land?"</p>

<p>"To have a share in the campaign," I said. "I’m an engineer,
and I thought I could help out with some business like Mesopotamia."</p>

<p>"You are on Germany’s side?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," I replied. "We Americans are supposed to be nootrals,
and that means we’re free to choose any side we fancy. I’m for
the Kaiser."</p>

<p>Her cool eyes searched me, but not in suspicion. I could see
she wasn’t troubling with the question whether I was speaking
the truth. She was sizing me up as a man. I cannot describe that
calm appraising look. There was no sex in it, nothing even of
that implicit sympathy with which one human being explores the
existence of another. I was a chattel, a thing infinitely removed
from intimacy. Even so I have myself looked at a horse which I
thought of buying, scanning his shoulders and hocks and paces.
Even so must the old lords of Constantinople have looked at the
slaves which the chances of war brought to their markets, assessing
their usefulness for some task or other with no thought of a humanity
common to purchased and purchaser. And yet—not quite. This woman’s
eyes were weighing me, not for any special duty, but for my essential
qualities. I felt that I was under the scrutiny of one who was
a connoisseur in human nature.</p>

<p>I see I have written that I knew nothing about women. But every
man has in his bones a consciousness of sex. I was shy and perturbed,
but horribly fascinated. This slim woman, poised exquisitely like
some statue between the pillared lights, with her fair cloud of
hair, her long delicate face, and her pale bright eyes, had the
glamour of a wild dream. I hated her instinctively, hated her
intensely, but I longed to arouse her interest. To be valued coldly
by those eyes was an offence to my manhood, and I felt antagonism
rising within me. I am a strong fellow, well set up, and rather
above the average height, and my irritation stiffened me from
heel to crown. I flung my head back and gave her cool glance for
cool glance, pride against pride.</p>

<p>Once, I remember, a doctor on board ship who dabbled in hypnotism
told me that I was the most unsympathetic person he had ever struck.
He said I was about as good a mesmeric subject as Table Mountain.
Suddenly I began to realize that this woman was trying to cast
some spell over me. The eyes grew large and luminous, and I was
conscious for just an instant of some will battling to subject
mine. I was aware, too, in the same moment of a strange scent
which recalled that wild hour in Kuprasso’s garden-house. It passed
quickly, and for a second her eyes drooped. I seemed to read in
them failure, and yet a kind of satisfaction, too, as if they
had found more in me than they expected.</p>

<p>"What life have you led?" the soft voice was saying.</p>

<p>I was able to answer quite naturally, rather to my surprise.
"I have been a mining engineer up and down the world."</p>

<p>"You have faced danger many times?"</p>

<p>"I have faced danger."</p>

<p>"You have fought with men in battles?"</p>

<p>"I have fought in battles."</p>

<p>Her bosom rose and fell in a kind of sigh. A smile—a very beautiful
thing—flitted over her face. She gave me her hand. "The horses
are at the door now," she said, "and your servant is with them.
One of my people will guide you to the city."</p>

<p>She turned away and passed out of the circle of light into the
darkness beyond ...</p>

<p>Peter and I jogged home in the rain with one of Sandy’s skin-clad
Companions loping at our side. We did not speak a word, for my
thoughts were running like hounds on the track of the past hours.
I had seen the mysterious Hilda von Einem, I had spoken to her,
I had held her hand. She had insulted me with the subtlest of
insults and yet I was not angry. Suddenly the game I was playing
became invested with a tremendous solemnity. My old antagonists,
Stumm and Rasta and the whole German Empire, seemed to shrink
into the background, leaving only the slim woman with her inscrutable
smile and devouring eyes. "Mad and bad," Blenkiron had called
her, "but principally bad." I did not think they were the proper
terms, for they belonged to the narrow world of our common experience.
This was something beyond and above it, as a cyclone or an earthquake
is outside the decent routine of nature. Mad and bad she might
be, but she was also great.</p>

<p>Before we arrived our guide had plucked my knee and spoken some
words which he had obviously got by heart. "The Master says,"
ran the message, "expect him at midnight."</p>
