<P>
"MY nephew!" Lady Lydiard exclaimed in a tone which expressed
astonishment, but certainly not pleasure as well. "How many years
is it since you and I last met?" she asked, in her abruptly
straightforward way, as Mr. Felix Sweetsir approached her
writing-table.
<P>
The visitor was not a person easily discouraged. He took Lady
Lydiard's hand, and kissed it with easy grace. A shade of irony
was in his manner, agreeably relieved by a playful flash of
tenderness.
<P>
"Years, my dear aunt?" he said. "Look in your glass and you will
see that time has stood still since we met last. How wonderfully
well you wear! When shall we celebrate the appearance of your
first wrinkle? I am too old; I shall never live to see it."
<P>
He took an easychair, uninvited; placed himself close at his
aunt's side, and ran his eye over her ill-chosen dress with an
air of satirical admiration. "How perfectly successful!" he said,
with his well-bred insolence. "What a chaste gayety of color!"
<P>
"What do you want?" asked her Ladyship, not in the least softened
by the compliment.
<P>
"I want to pay my respects to my dear aunt," Felix answered,
perfectly impenetrable to his ungracious reception, and perfectly
comfortable in a spacious arm-chair.
<P>
No pen-and-ink portrait need surely be drawn of Felix
Sweetsir--he is too well-known a picture in society. The little
lith e man, with his bright, restless eyes, and his long
iron-gray hair falling in curls to his shoulders, his airy step
and his cordial manner; his uncertain age, his innumerable
accomplishments, and his unbounded popularity--is he not familiar
everywhere, and welcome everywhere? How gratefully he receives,
how prodigally he repays, the cordial appreciation of an admiring
world! Every man he knows is "a charming fellow." Every woman he
sees is "sweetly pretty." What picnics he gives on the banks of
the Thames in the summer season! What a well-earned little income
he derives from the whist-table! What an inestimable actor he is
at private theatricals of all sorts (weddings included)! Did you
never read Sweetsir's novel, dashed off in the intervals of
curative perspiration at a German bath? Then you don't know what
brilliant fiction really is. He has never written a second work;
he does everything, and only does it once. One song--the despair
of professional composers. One picture--just to show how easily a
gentleman can take up an art and drop it again. A really
multiform man, with all the graces and all the accomplishments
scintillating perpetually at his fingers' ends. If these poor
pages have achieved nothing else, they have done a service to
persons not in society by presenting them to Sweetsir. In his
gracious company the narrative brightens; and writer and reader
(catching reflected brilliancy) understand each other at last,
thanks to Sweetsir.
<P>
"Well," said Lady Lydiard, "now you are here, what have you got
to say for yourself? You have been abroad, of course! Where?"
<P>
"Principally at Paris, my dear aunt. The only place that is fit
to live in--for this excellent reason, that the French are the
only people who know how to make the most of life. One has
relations and friends in England and every now and then one
returns to London--"
<P>
"When one has spent all one's money in Paris," her Ladyship
interposed. "That's what you were going to say, isn't it?"
<P>
Felix submitted to the interruption with his delightful
good-humor.
<P>
"What a bright creature you are!" he exclaimed. "What would I not
give for your flow of spirits! Yes--one does spend money in
Paris, as you say. The clubs, the stock exchange, the
race-course: you try your luck here, there, and everywhere; and
you lose and win, win and lose--and you haven't a dull day to
complain of." He paused, his smile died away, he looked
inquiringly at Lady Lydiard. "What a wonderful existence yours
must be," he resumed. "The everlasting question with your needy
fellow-creatures, 'Where am I to get money?' is a question that
has never passed your lips. Enviable woman!" He paused once
more--surprised and puzzled this time. "What is the matter, my
dear aunt? You seem to be suffering under some uneasiness."
<P>
"I am suffering under your conversation," her Ladyship answered
sharply. "Money is a sore subject with me just now," she went on,
with her eyes on her nephew, watching the effect of what she
said. "I have spent five hundred pounds this morning with a
scrape of my pen. And, only a week since, I yielded to temptation
and made an addition to my picture-gallery." She looked, as she
said those words, towards an archway at the further end of the
room, closed by curtains of purple velvet. "I really tremble when
I think of what that one picture cost me before I could call it
mine. A landscape by Hobbema; and the National Gallery bidding
against me. Never mind!" she concluded, consoling herself, as
usual, with considerations that were beneath her. "Hobbema will
sell at my death for a bigger price than I gave for him--that's
one comfort!" She looked again at Felix; a smile of mischievous
satisfaction began to show itself in her face. "Anything wrong
with your watch-chain?" she asked.
<P>
Felix, absently playing with his watch-chain, started as if his
aunt had suddenly awakened him. While Lady Lydiard had been
speaking, his vivacity had subsided little by little, and had
left him looking so serious and so old that his most intimate
friend would hardly have known him again. Roused by the sudden
question that had been put to him, he seemed to be casting about
in his mind in search of the first excuse for his silence that
might turn up.
<P>
"I was wondering," he began, "why I miss something when I look
round this beautiful room; something familiar, you know, that I
fully expected to find here."
<P>
"Tommie?" suggested Lady Lydiard, still watching her nephew as
maliciously as ever.
<P>
"That's it!" cried Felix, seizing his excuse, and rallying his
spirits. "Why don't I hear Tommie snarling behind me; why don't I
feel Tommie's teeth in my trousers?"
<P>
The smile vanished from Lady Lydiard's face; the tone taken by
her nephew in speaking of her dog was disrespectful in the
extreme. She showed him plainly that she disapproved of it. Felix
went on, nevertheless, impenetrable to reproof of the silent
sort. "Dear little Tommie! So delightfully fat; and such an
infernal temper! I don't know whether I hate him or love him.
Where is he?"
<P>
"Ill in bed," answered her ladyship, with a gravity which
startled even Felix himself. "I wish to speak to you about
Tommie. You know everybody. Do you know of a good dog-doctor? The
person I have employed so far doesn't at all satisfy me."
<P>
"Professional person?" inquired Felix.
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"All humbugs, my dear aunt. The worse the dog gets the bigger the
bill grows, don't you see? I have got the man for you--a
gentleman. Knows more about horses and dogs than all the
veterinary surgeons put together. We met in the boat yesterday
crossing the Channel. You know him by name, of course? Lord
Rotherfield's youngest son, Alfred Hardyman."
<P>
"The owner of the stud farm? The man who has bred the famous
racehorses?" cried Lady Lydiard. "My dear Felix, how can I
presume to trouble such a great personage about my dog?"
<P>
Felix burst into his genial laugh. "Never was modesty more
woefully out of place," he rejoined. "Hardyman is dying to be
presented to your Ladyship. He has heard, like everybody, of the
magnificent decorations of this house, and he is longing to see
them. His chambers are close by, in Pall Mall. If he is at home
we will have him here in five minutes. Perhaps I had better see
the dog first?"
<P>
Lady Lydiard shook her head. "Isabel says he had better not be
disturbed," she answered. "Isabel understands him better than
anybody."
<P>
Felix lifted his lively eyebrows with a mixed expression of
curiosity and surprise. "Who is Isabel?"
<P>
Lady Lydiard was vexed with herself for carelessly mentioning
Isabel's name in her nephew's presence. Felix was not the sort of
person whom she was desirous of admitting to her confidence in
domestic matters. "Isabel is an addition to my household since
you were here last," she answered shortly.
<P>
"Young and pretty?" inquired Felix. "Ah! you look serious, and
you don't answer me. Young and pretty, evidently. Which may I see
first, the addition to your household or the addition to your
picture-gallery? You look at the picture-gallery--I am answered
again." He rose to approach the archway, and stopped at his first
step forward. "A sweet girl is a dreadful responsibility, aunt,"
he resumed, with an ironical assumption of gravity. "Do you know,
I shouldn't be surprised if Isabel, in the long run, cost you
more than Hobbema. Who is this at the door?"
<P>
The person at the door was Robert Moody, returned from the bank.
Mr. Felix Sweetsir, being near-sighted, was obliged to fit his
eye-glass in position before he could recognize the prime
minister of Lady Lydiard's household.
<P>
"Ha! our worthy Moody. How well he wears! Not a gray hair on his
head--and look at mine! What dye do you use, Moody? If he had my
open disposition he would tell. As it is, he looks unutterable
things, and holds his tongue. Ah! if I could only have held _my_
tongue--when I was in the diplomatic service, you know--what a
position I might have occupied by this time! Don't let me
interrupt you, Moody, if you have anything to say to Lady
Lydiard."
<P>
Having acknowledged Mr. Sweetsir's lively greeting by a formal
bow, and a grave look of wonder which respectfully repelled that
vivacious gentleman's flow of humor, Moody turned
 towards his mistress.
<P>
"Have you got the bank-note?" asked her Ladyship.
<P>
Moody laid the bank-note on the table.
<P>
"Am I in the way?" inquired Felix.
<P>
"No," said his aunt. "I have a letter to write; it won't occupy
me for more than a few minutes. You can stay here, or go and look
at the Hobbema, which you please."
<P>
Felix made a second sauntering attempt to reach the
picture-gallery. Arrived within a few steps of the entrance, he
stopped again, attracted by an open cabinet of Italian
workmanship, filled with rare old china. Being nothing if not a
cultivated amateur, Mr. Sweetsir paused to pay his passing
tribute of admiration before the contents of the cabinet.
"Charming! charming!" he said to himself, with his head twisted
appreciatively a little on one side. Lady Lydiard and Moody left
him in undisturbed enjoyment of the china, and went on with the
business of the bank-note.
<P>
"Ought we to take the number of the note, in case of accident?"
asked her Ladyship.
<P>
Moody produced a slip of paper from his waistcoat pocket. "I took
the number, my Lady, at the bank."
<P>
"Very well. You keep it. While I am writing my letter, suppose
you direct the envelope. What is the clergyman's name?"
<P>
Moody mentioned the name and directed the envelope. Felix,
happening to look round at Lady Lydiard and the steward while
they were both engaged in writing, returned suddenly to the table
as if he had been struck by a new idea.
<P>
"Is there a third pen?" he asked. "Why shouldn't I write a line
at once to Hardyman, aunt? The sooner you have his opinion about
Tommie the better--don't you think so?"
<P>
Lady Lydiard pointed to the pen tray, with a smile. To show
consideration for her dog was to seize irresistibly on the
high-road to her favor. Felix set to work on his letter, in a
large scrambling handwriting, with plenty of ink and a noisy pen.
"I declare we are like clerks in an office," he remarked, in his
cheery way. "All with our noses to the paper, writing as if we
lived by it! Here, Moody, let one of the servants take this at
once to Mr. Hardyman's."
<P>
The messenger was despatched. Robert returned, and waited near
his mistress, with the directed envelope in his hand. Felix
sauntered back slowly towards the picture-gallery, for the third
time. In a moment more Lady Lydiard finished her letter, and
folded up the bank-note in it. She had just taken the directed
envelope from Moody, and had just placed the letter inside it,
when a scream from the inner room, in which Isabel was nursing
the sick dog, startled everybody. "My Lady! my Lady!" cried the
girl, distractedly, "Tommie is in a fit? Tommie is dying!"
<P>
Lady Lydiard dropped the unclosed envelope on the table, and
ran--yes, short as she was and fat as she was, ran--into the
inner room. The two men, left together, looked at each other.
<P>
"Moody," said Felix, in his lazily-cynical way, "do you think if
you or I were in a fit that her Ladyship would run? Bah! these
are the things that shake one's faith in human nature. I feel
infernally seedy. That cursed Channel passage--I tremble in my
inmost stomach when I think of it. Get me something, Moody."
<P>
"What shall I send you, sir?" Moody asked coldly.
<P>
"Some dry curacoa and a biscuit. And let it be brought to me in
the picture-gallery. Damn the dog! I'll go and look at Hobbema."
<P>
This time he succeeded in reaching the archway, and disappeared
behind the curtains of the picture-gallery.
