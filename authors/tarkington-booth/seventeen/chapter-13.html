<p>After ablutions, he found his wet hair plastic, and easily obtained
the long, even sweep backward from the brow, lacking which no
male person, unless bald, fulfilled his definition of a man of
the world. But there ensued a period of vehemence and activity
caused by a bent collar-button, which went on strike with a desperation
that was downright savage. The day was warm and William was warmer;
moisture bedewed him afresh. Belated victory no sooner arrived
than he perceived a fatal dimpling of the new collar, and was
forced to begin the operation of exchanging it for a successor.
Another exchange, however, he unfortunately forgot to make: the
handkerchief with which he had wiped the wall remained in his
pocket.</p>

<p>Voices from below, making polite laughter, warned him that already
some of the bidden party had arrived, and, as he completed the
fastening of his third consecutive collar, an ecstasy of sound
reached him through the open window&mdash;and then, Oh then! his breath
behaved in an abnormal manner and he began to tremble. It was
the voice of Miss Pratt, no less!</p>

<p>He stopped for one heart-struck look from his casement. All in
fluffy white and heliotrope she was&mdash;a blonde rapture floating
over the sidewalk toward William's front gate. Her little white
cottony dog, with a heliotrope ribbon round his neck, bobbed his
head over her cuddling arm; a heliotrope parasol shielded her
infinitesimally from the amorous sun. Poor William!</p>

<p>Two youths entirely in William's condition of heart accompanied
the glamorous girl and hung upon her rose-leaf lips, while Miss
Parcher appeared dimly upon the outskirts of the group, the well-known
penalty for hostesses who entertain such radiance. Probably it
serves them right.</p>

<p>To William's reddening ear Miss Pratt's voice came clearly as
the chiming of tiny bells, for she spoke whimsically to her little
dog in that tinkling childlike fashion which was part of the spell
she cast.</p>

<p>"Darlin' Flopit," she said, "wake up! Oo tummin' to tea-potty
wiz all de drowed-ups. P'eshus Flopit, wake up!"</p>

<p>Dizzy with enchantment, half suffocated, his heart melting within
him, William turned from the angelic sounds and fairy vision of
the window. He ran out of the room, and plunged down the front
stairs. And the next moment the crash of breaking glass and the
loud thump-bump of a heavily falling human body resounded through
the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter, alarmed, quickly excused herself from the tea-table,
round which were gathered four or five young people, and hastened
to the front hall, followed by Jane. Through the open door were
seen Miss Pratt, Miss Parcher, Mr. Johnnie Watson and Mr. Joe
Bullitt coming leisurely up the sunny front walk, laughing and
unaware of the catastrophe which had just occurred within the
shadows of the portal. And at a little distance from the foot
of the stairs William was seated upon the prostrate "Battle of
Gettysburg."</p>

<p>"It slid," he said, hoarsely. "I carried it upstairs with me"&mdash;he
believed this&mdash;"and somebody brought it down and left it lying
flat on the floor by the bottom step on purpose to trip me! I
stepped on it and it slid." He was in a state of shock: it seemed
important to impress upon his mother the fact that the picture
had not remained firmly in place when he stepped upon it. "It
<em>SLID, I </em>tell you!"</p>

<p>"Get up, Willie!" she urged, under her breath, and as he summoned
enough presence of mind to obey, she beheld ruins other than the
wrecked engraving. She stifled a cry. "<em>WILLIE! </em>Did the
glass cut you?"</p>

<p>He felt himself. "No'm."</p>

<p>"It did your trousers! You'll have to change them. Hurry!"</p>

<p>Some of William's normal faculties were restored to him by one
hasty glance at the back of his left leg, which had a dismantled
appearance. A long blue strip of cloth hung there, with white
showing underneath.</p>

<p>"<em>HURRY!" </em>said Mrs. Baxter. And hastily gathering some
fragments of glass, she dropped them upon the engraving, pushed
it out of the way, and went forward to greet Miss Pratt and her
attendants.</p>

<p>As for William, he did not even pause to close his mouth, but
fled with it open. Upward he sped, unseen, and came to a breathless
halt upon the landing at the top of the stairs.</p>

<p>As it were in a dream he heard his mother's hospitable greetings
at the door, and then the little party lingered in the hall, detained
by Miss Pratt's discovery of Jane.</p>

<p>"Oh, tweetums tootums ickle dirl!" he heard the ravishing voice
exclaim. "Oh, tootums ickle blue sash!"</p>

<p>"It cost a dollar and eighty-nine cents," said Jane. "Willie
sat on the cakes."</p>

<p>"Oh no, he didn't," Mrs. Baxter laughed. "He didn't <em>QUITE</em>!"</p>

<p>"He had to go up-stairs," said Jane. And as the stricken listener
above smote his forehead, she added placidly, "He tore a hole
in his clo'es."</p>

<p>She seemed about to furnish details, her mood being communicative,
but Mrs. Baxter led the way into the "living-room"; the hall was
vacated, and only the murmur of voices and laughter reached William.
What descriptive information Jane may have added was spared his
hearing, which was a mercy.</p>

<p>And yet it may be that he could not have felt worse than he did;
for there IS nothing worse than to be seventeen and to hear one
of the Noblest girls in the world told by a little child that
you sat on the cakes and tore a hole in your clo'es.</p>

<p>William leaned upon the banister railing and thought thoughts
about Jane. For several long, seething moments he thought of her
exclusively. Then, spurred by the loud laughter of rivals and
the agony of knowing that even in his own house they were monopolizing
the attention of one of the Noblest, he hastened into his own,
room and took account of his reverses.</p>

<p>Standing with his back to the mirror, he obtained over his shoulder
a view of his trousers which caused him to break out in a fresh
perspiration. Again he wiped his forehead with the handkerchief,
and the result was instantly visible in the mirror.</p>

<p>The air thickened with sounds of frenzy, followed by a torrential
roar and great sputterings in a bath-room, which tumult subsiding,
William returned at a tragic gallop to his room and, having removed
his trousers, began a feverish examination of the garments hanging
in a clothes-closet. There were two pairs of flannel trousers
which would probably again be white and possible, when cleaned
and pressed, but a glance showed that until then they were not
to be considered as even the last resort of desperation. Beside
them hung his "last year's summer suit" of light gray.</p>

<p>Feverishly he brought it forth, threw off his coat, and then&mdash;deflected
by another glance at the mirror&mdash;began to change his collar again.
This was obviously necessary, and to quicken the process he decided
to straighten the bent collar-button. Using a shoe-horn as a lever,
he succeeded in bringing the little cap or head of the button
into its proper plane, but, unfortunately, his final effort dislodged
the cap from the rod between it and the base, and it flew off
malignantly into space. Here was a calamity; few things are more
useless than a decapitated collar-button, and William had no other.
He had made sure that it was his last before he put it on, that
day; also he had ascertained that there was none in, on, or about
his father's dressing-table. Finally, in the possession of neither
William nor his father was there a shirt with an indigenous collar.</p>

<p>For decades, collar-buttons have been on the hand-me-down shelves
of humor; it is a mistake in the catalogue. They belong to pathos.
They have done harm in the world, and there have been collar-buttons
that failed when the destinies of families hung upon them. There
have been collar-buttons that thwarted proper matings. There have
been collar-buttons that bore last hopes, and, falling to the
floor, <em>NEVER </em>were found! William's broken collar-button
was really the only collar-button in the house, except such as
were engaged in serving his male guests below.</p>

<p>At first he did not realize the extent of his misfortune. How
could he? Fate is always expected to deal its great blows in the
grand manner. But our expectations are fustian spangled with pinchbeck;
we look for tragedy to be theatrical. Meanwhile, every day before
our eyes, fate works on, employing for its instruments the infinitesimal,
the ignoble and the petty&mdash;in a word, collar-buttons.</p>

<p>Of course William searched his dressing-table and his father's,
although he had been thoroughly over both once before that day.
Next he went through most of his mother's and Jane's accessories
to the toilette; through trinket-boxes, glove-boxes, hairpin-boxes,
handkerchief-cases&mdash;even through sewing-baskets. Utterly he convinced
himself that ladies not only use no collar-buttons, but also never
pick them up and put them away among their own belongings. How
much time he consumed in this search is difficult to reckon;&mdash;it
is almost impossible to believe that there is absolutely no collar-button
in a house.</p>

<p>And what William's state of mind had become is matter for exorbitant
conjecture. Jane, arriving at his locked door upon an errand,
was bidden by a thick, unnatural voice to depart.</p>

<p>"Mamma says, 'What in mercy's name is the matter?'" Jane called.
"She whispered to me, 'Go an' see what in mercy's name is the
matter with Willie; an' if the glass cut him, after all; an' why
don't he come down'; an' why don't you, Willie? We're all havin'
the nicest time!"</p>

<p>"You g'way!" said the strange voice within the room. "G'way!"</p>

<p>"Well, did the glass cut you?"</p>

<p>"No! Keep quiet! G'way!"</p>

<p>"Well, are you <em>EVER </em>comin' down to your party?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am! G'way!"</p>

<p>Jane obeyed, and William somehow completed the task upon which
he was engaged. Genius had burst forth from his despair; necessity
had become a mother again, and William's collar was in place.
It was tied there. Under his necktie was a piece of string.</p>

<p>He had lost count of time, but he was frantically aware of its
passage; agony was in the thought of so many rich moments frittered
away; up-stairs, while Joe Bullitt and Johnnie Watson made hay
below. And there was another spur to haste in his fear that the
behavior of Mrs. Baxter might not be all that the guest of honor
would naturally expect of William's mother. As for Jane, his mind
filled with dread; shivers passed over him at intervals.</p>

<p>It was a dismal thing to appear at a "party" (and that his own)
in "last summer's suit," but when he had hastily put it on and
faced the mirror, he felt a little better&mdash;for three or four seconds.
Then he turned to see how the back of it looked.</p>

<p>And collapsed in a chair, moaning.</p>
