<p>It was in the days when nothing physical tainted her passionate
attachment to Clive. When she was with him she enjoyed the moment
with all her heart and soul&mdash;gave to it and to him everything
that was best in her&mdash;all the richness of her mental and bodily
vigour, all the unspoiled enthusiasm of her years, all the sturdy
freshness of youth, eager, receptive, credulous, unsatiated.</p>

<p>With them, once more, the old happy companionship began; the
Café Arabesque, the Regina, the theatres, the suburban restaurants
knew them again. Familiar faces among the waiters welcomed them
to the same tables; the same ushers guided them through familiar
aisles; the same taxi drivers touched their caps with the same
alacrity; the same porters bestirred themselves for tips.</p>

<p>Sometimes when they were not alone, they and their friends danced
late at Castle House or the Sans-Souci, or the Humming-Bird, or
some such resort, at that time in vogue.</p>

<p>Sometimes on Saturday afternoons or on Sundays and holidays they
spent hours in the museums and libraries&mdash;not that Clive had either
inherited or been educated to any truer appreciation of things
worth while than the average New York man&mdash;but like the majority
he admitted the solemnity and fearsomeness of art and letters,
and his attitude toward them was as carefully respectful as it
was in church.</p>

<p>Which first perplexed and then amused Athalie who, with no opportunities,
had been born with a wholesome passion for all things beautiful
of the mind.</p>

<p>The little she knew she had learned from books or from her companionship
with Captain Dane that first summer after Clive had gone abroad.
And there was nothing orthodox, nothing pedantic, nothing simulated
or artificial in her likes or dislikes, her preferences or her
indifference.</p>

<p>Yet, somehow, even without knowing, the girl instinctively gravitated
toward all things good.</p>

<p>In modern art&mdash;with the exception of a few painters&mdash;she found
little to attract her; but the magnificence of the great Venetians,
the sombre splendour of the great Spaniards, the nobility of the
great English and Dutch masters held her with a spell forever
new. And, as for the exquisite, naïvely self-conscious works of
Greuze, Lancret, Fragonard, Boucher, Watteau, and Nattier, she
adored them with all the fresh and natural appetite of a capacity
for visual pleasure unjaded.</p>

<p>He recognised Raphael with respect and pleasure when authority
reassured him it <em>was</em> Raphael. Also he probably knew more
about the history of art than did she. Otherwise it was Athalie
who led, instinctively, toward what gallery and library held as
their best.</p>

<p>Her favourite lingering places were amid the immortal Chinese
porcelains and the masterpieces of the Renaissance. And thither
she frequently beguiled Clive,&mdash;not that he required any persuading
to follow this young and lovely creature who ranged the full boundaries
of her environment, living to the full life as it had been allotted
her.</p>

<p>Wholesome with that charming and rounded slenderness of perfect
health there yet seemed no limit to her capacity for the enjoyment
of all things for which an appetite exists&mdash;pleasures, mental
or physical&mdash;it did not seem to matter.</p>

<p>She adored walking; to exercise her body delighted her. Always
she ate and drank with a relish that fascinated; she was mad about
the theatre and about music:&mdash;and whatever she chanced to be doing
she did with all the vigour, intelligence, and pleasure of which
she was capable, throwing into it her entire heart and soul.</p>

<p>It led to temporary misunderstandings&mdash;particularly with the
men she met&mdash;even in the small circle of friends whom she received
and with whom she went about. Arthur Ensart entirely mistook her
until fiercely set right one evening when alone with him; James
Allys also listened to a curt but righteously impassioned discourse
which he never forgot. Hargrave's gentlemanly and suavely villainous
intentions, when finally comprehended, became radically modified
under her coolly scornful rebuke. Welter, fat and sentimental,
never was more than tiresomely saccharine; Ferris and Lyndhurst
betrayed symptoms of being misunderstood, but it was a toss-up
as to the degree of seriousness in their intentions.</p>


<p>The intentions of men are seldom more serious than they have
to be. But they all were helplessly, hopelessly caught in the
magic, gossamer web of Athalie's beauty and personal charm; and
some merely kicked and buzzed and some tried to rend the frail
rainbow fabric, and some struggled silently against they knew
not what&mdash;themselves probably. And some, like Dane, hung motionless,
enmeshed, knowing that to struggle was futile. And some, like
Clive, were still lying under her jewelled feet in the very centre
of the sorcery, so far silent and unstirring, awaiting to see
whether the grace of God would fall upon them or the <em>coup-de-grâce</em>
that ended all. Eventually, however, like all other men, Clive
gave signs of life and impatience.</p>

<p>"<em>Can't</em> you love me, Athalie?" he said abruptly one night,
when they had returned from the theatre and he had already taken
his leave&mdash;and had come back from the door to take it again more
tenderly. The girl let him kiss her.</p>

<p>She, in her clinging, sparkling evening gown was standing by
her crystal, the fingers of one hand lightly poised upon it, looking
down at it.</p>

<p>"Love you, Clive," she repeated in smiling surprise. "Why, I
do, you dear, foolish boy. I've admitted it to you. Also haven't
you just kissed me?"</p>

<p>"I know.... But I mean&mdash;couldn't you love me above all other
men&mdash;above everything in this world&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I <em>do</em>! Were you annoyed because I was silly with
Cecil to-night?"</p>

<p>"No.... I understand. You simply can't help turning everybody's
head. It's in you,&mdash;it's part of you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm merely having a good time," she protested. "It means no
more than you see, when I flirt with other men.... It never goes
any farther&mdash;except&mdash;once or twice I have let men kiss me....
Only two or three.... Before you came back, of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't know that," he said sullenly.</p>

<p>"Didn't you? Then the men were more decent than I supposed....
Yes, I let John Lyndhurst kiss me once. And Francis Hargrave did
it.... And Jim Allys tried to, against my wishes&mdash;but he never
attempted it after that."</p>

<p>She had been looking down again at the crystal while speaking;
her attitude was penitential, but the faint smile on her lips
adorably mischievous. Presently she glanced up at him to see how
he was taking it. He must have been taking it very badly, for:</p>

<p>"Clive!" she said, startled; "are you really annoyed with me?"</p>

<p>The gathering scowl faded and he forced a smile. Then the frown
returned; he flung one arm around her supple waist and gathered
both her hands into his, holding them closely imprisoned.</p>

<p>"You <em>must</em> love!" he said almost roughly.</p>

<p>"My dear! I've told you that I do love you."</p>

<p>"And I tell you you don't! Your calm and cheerful friendship
for me isn't love!"</p>

<p>"Oh. What else is it, please?"</p>

<p>He kissed her on the mouth. She suffered his lips again without
flinching, then drew back laughingly to avoid him.</p>

<p>"Why are you becoming so very demonstrative?" she asked. "If
you are not careful it will become a horrid habit with you."</p>

<p>"Does it mean nothing more than a habit to you?" he asked, unsmilingly.</p>

<p>"It means that I care enough for you to let you do it more than
once, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>He shrugged and turned his face toward the window:</p>

<p>"And you believe that you love me," he said, sullenly and partly
to himself.</p>

<p>"You amazingly sulky man, <em>what</em> are you muttering to
yourself?" she demanded, bending forward and across his shoulder
to see his face which was still turned from her. He swung about
and caught her fiercely in his arms; and the embrace left her
breathless and flushed.</p>

<p>"Clive&mdash;please&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>Can't</em> you care for me! For God's sake show it if you
can!"</p>

<p>"Please, dear &mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>Can't</em> you!" he repeated unsteadily, drawing her closer.
"You know what I am asking. Answer me!"</p>

<p>She bent her head and rested it against his shoulder a moment,
considering; she then looked away from him, troubled:</p>

<p>"I don't want to be your&mdash;mistress," she said. Truth disconcerts
the vast majority. It disconcerted him&mdash;after a ringing silence
through which the beating of rain on the window came to him like
the steady tattoo of his own heart.</p>

<p>"I did not ask that," he said, very red.</p>

<p>"You meant that.... Because I've been everything to you except
that."</p>

<p>"I want you for my wife," he interrupted sharply.</p>

<p>"But you are married, Clive. So what more can I be to you, unless
I become&mdash;what I don't want to become&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I merely want you to love me&mdash;until I can find some way out
of this hell on earth I'm living in!"</p>

<p>"Dear, I'm sorry! I'm sorry you are so unhappy. But you can't
get free,&mdash;can you? She won't let you, will she?"</p>

<p>"I've got to have my freedom! I can't stand this. Good God! Must
a man do life for being a fool once? Isn't there any allowance
to be made for a first offence? I've always wanted to marry you.
I was a miserable, crazy coward to do what I did! Haven't I paid
for it? Do you know what I've been through?"</p>

<p>She said very sweetly and pitifully: "Dear, I know what people
suffer&mdash;what lonely hearts endure. I think I understand what you
have been through."</p>

<p>"I know you understand! Fool that I am who enlightened you. But
yours was the injury of bruised faith&mdash;the suffering caused by
outrage. No hell of self-contempt set <em>you</em> crawling about
the world in agony; no despicable self-knowledge drove <em>you</em>
out into the waste places. Yours was the sorrow of a self-respecting
victim; mine the grief of the damned fool who has done to death
all that he ever loved for the love of expediency and of self!"</p>

<p>"Clive!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's what I am!" he interrupted fiercely, "a damned fool!
I don't know what else I am, but I can't live without you, and
I won't!"</p>

<p>She said: "You told me that being in love with me would not make
you unhappy. So I told you to love me. I was wrong to let you
do it."</p>

<p>"You darling! I am more than happy!"</p>

<p>"It was a dreadful mistake, Clive! I shouldn't have let you."</p>

<p>"Do you think you could have stopped me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Couldn't I? I've stopped other men.... I shouldn't
have let you. But it was so delightful&mdash;to be really loved by
<em>you</em>! All my pride responded. It seemed to dignify everything;
it seemed to make me really a woman, with a place among other
women&mdash;to be loved by such a man as you ... and I was <em>not</em>
selfish about it; I did ask you whether it would make you unhappy
to be in love with me. Oh, I see now that I was very wrong, Clive&mdash;very
foolish, very wrong! Because it <em>is</em> making you restless
and unhappy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you could only love me a little in return!"</p>

<p>"I don't know how to love you except the way I am doing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is a more vital emotion&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It seems impossible that I could care for you more deeply than
I do."</p>

<p>"If you could only respond with a little tenderness&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I <em>do</em> respond&mdash;as well as I know how," she said piteously.</p>

<p>He drew her nearer and touched her cheek with his lips:</p>

<p>"I know, dear. I don't mean to complain."</p>

<p>"Oh, Clive! I have let you fall in love with me and it is making
you miserable! And now it's making me miserable, too, because
you are disappointed in me."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are! I'm not what you expected&mdash;not what you wanted&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are everything I want!&mdash;if I could only wake your heart!"
he said in a low tense voice.</p>

<p>"It isn't my heart that is asleep.... I know what you miss in
me.... And I can't help it. I &mdash;I don't wish to help it&mdash;or
to be different."</p>

<p>She dropped her head against his shoulder. After a few moments
she spoke from there in a muffled, childish voice:</p>

<p>"What can I do about it? I don't want to be your mistress, Clive....
I never wanted to do&mdash;anything&mdash;like that."</p>

<p>A deeper colour burnt his face. He said: "Could you love me enough
to marry me if I managed to free myself?"</p>

<p>"I have never thought of marrying you, Clive. It isn't that I
couldn't love you&mdash;that way. I suppose I could. Probably I could.
Only &mdash;I don't know anything about it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me try to free myself, anyway."</p>

<p>"How is it possible?"</p>

<p>He said, exasperated: "Do you suppose I can endure this sort
of existence forever?"</p>

<p>The swift tears sprang to her eyes. "I don't know &mdash;I don't
know," she faltered. "I thought this existence of ours ideal.
I thought you were going to be happy; I supposed that our being
together again would bring happiness to us both. It doesn't! It
is making us wretched. You are not contented with our friendship!"
She turned on him passionately: "I don't wish to be your mistress.
I don't want you to make me wish to be. No girl naturally desires
less than she is entitled to, or more than the law permits&mdash;unless
some man teaches her to wish for it. Don't make such a girl of
me, Clive! You&mdash;you are beginning to do it. And I don't wish it!
Truly I don't!"</p>

<p>In that fierce flash of candour,&mdash;of guiltless passion, she had
revealed herself. Never, until that moment, had he supposed himself
so absolutely dominant, invested with such power for good or evil.
That he could sway her one way or the other through her pure loyalty,
devotion, and sympathy he had not understood.</p>

<p>To do him justice he desired no such responsibility. He had meant
to be honest and generous and unselfish even when the outlook
seemed most hopeless,&mdash;when he was convinced that he had no chance
of freedom.</p>

<p>But a man with the girl he loves in his arms might as well set
a net to catch the wind as to set boundaries to his desires. Perhaps
he could not so ardently have desired his freedom to marry her
had he not as ardently desired her love.</p>

<p>Love he had of her, but it was an affection utterly innocent
of passion. He knew it; she realised it; realised too that the
capacity for passion was in her. And had asked him not awaken
her to it, instinctively recoiling from it. Generous, unsullied,
proudly ignorant, she desired to remain so. Yet knew her peril;
and candidly revealed it to him in the most honest appeal ever
made to him.</p>

<p>For if the girl herself suspected and dreaded whither her loyalty
and deep devotion to him might lead her, he had realised very
suddenly what his leadership meant in such a companionship.</p>

<p>Now it sobered him, awed him,&mdash;and chilled him a trifle.</p>

<p>Himself, his own love for her, his own passion he could control
and in a measure subdue. But, once awakened, could he control
such an ally as she might be to his own lesser, impatient and
hot-headed self?</p>

<p>Where her disposition was to deny, he could still fetter self
and acquiesce. But he began to understand that half his strength
lay in her unwillingness; half of their safety in her inexperience,
her undisturbed tranquillity, her aloofness from physical emotion
and her ignorance of the mastery of the lesser passions.</p>

<p>The girl had builded wholesomely and wisely for herself. Instinct
had led her truly and well as far as that tangled moment in her
life. Instinct still would lead her safely if she were let alone,&mdash;instinct
and the intelligence she herself had developed. For the ethical
view of the question remained only as a vague memory of precepts
mechanical and meaningless to a healthy child. She had lost her
mother too early to have understood the casual morals so gently
inculcated. And nobody else had told her anything.</p>

<p>Also intelligence is often a foe to instinct. She might, with
little persuasion accept an unconventional view of life; with
a little emotional awakening she might more easily still be persuaded
to a logic builded on false foundations. Add to these her ardent
devotion to this man, and her deep and tender concern lest he
be unhappy, and Athalie's chances for remaining her own mistress
were slim enough.</p>

<p>Something of this Clive seemed to understand; and the understanding
left him very serious and silent where he stood in the soft glow
of the lamp with this young girl in his arms and her warm, sweet
head on his breast.</p>

<p>He said after a long silence: "You are right, Athalie. It is
better, safer, not to respond to me. I'm just in love with you
and I want to marry you&mdash;that's all. I shall not be unhappy about
it. I am not, now. If I marry you, you'll fall in love, too, in
your own way. That will be as it should be. I could desire no
more than that. I <em>do</em> desire nothing more."</p>

<p>He looked down at her, smiled, releasing her gently. But she
clung to him for a moment.</p>

<p>"You are so wonderful, Clive&mdash;so dear! I <em>do</em> love you.
I will marry you if I can. I want to make up everything to you&mdash;the
lonely years, your deep unhappiness&mdash;even," she added shyly, "your
little disappointment in me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't understand, Athalie. I am not disappointed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I <em>do</em> understand. And I am thinking of what will happen
if you fail to free yourself.... Because I realize now that I
don't propose to leave you to grow old all alone.... I shall live
with you when you're old whatever people may think. I tell you,
Clive, I'm the same child, the same girl that you once knew, only
grown into a woman. I know right from wrong. I had rather not
do wrong. But if I've got to &mdash;I won't whimper. And I'll
do it thoroughly!"</p>

<p>"You won't do it at all," he said, smiling at her threat to the
little tin gods.</p>

<p>"I don't know. If they won't give you your freedom, and if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Athalie," he said, laughing, coolly master of himself
once more. "We mustn't be unwholesomely romantic, you and I. I'll
marry you if I can; if I can't, God help us, that's all."</p>

<p>But she had become very grave: "God help us," she repeated slowly.
"Because I believe that, rightly or wrongly, I shall one day belong
to you."</p>

<p>He said: "It can be only in one way. The right way." Perhaps
he had awakened too late to a realisation of his power over her,
for the girl made no response, no longer even looked at him.</p>

<p>"Only one way," he repeated, uneasily;&mdash;"the right way, Athalie."</p>

<p>But into her dark blue eyes had come a vague and brooding beauty
which he had never before seen. In it was tenderness, and a new
wisdom, alas! and a faint and shadowy something, profound, starlike,
inscrutable.</p>

<p>"As for love," he said, forcing a lighter tone, "there are fifty-seven
different varieties, Athalie; and only one is poisonous,&mdash;unless
taken with the other fifty-six, and in small doses."</p>

<p>She smiled faintly and walked to the window. Rain beat there
in the darkness spattering the little iron balcony. Below, the
bleared lights of the city stretched away to the sky-line.</p>

<p>He followed, and slipped his arm through hers; and she bent her
wrist, interlacing her slim fingers with his.</p>

<p>"You know," he said, "that when I often speak with apparent authority
I am wrong. In the final analysis <em>you</em> are the real leader,
Athalie. Your instincts are the right ones; your convictions honest,
your conclusions just. Mine are too often confused with selfishness
and indecision. For mine is an irresolute character;&mdash;or it was.
I'm trying to make it firmer."</p>

<p>She pressed his hand lightly, her eyes still fixed on the light-smeared
darkness.</p>

<p>He went on more gravely: "Candour and the intuition born of common
sense,&mdash;that is where you are so admirable, dear. Add to that
the tenderest heart that ever beat, and a proud ignorance of the
lesser, baser emotions&mdash;and, who am I to interfere,&mdash;to come into
the sweet order of your life with demands that confuse you&mdash;with
complaints against the very destiny I brought upon us both&mdash;with
the clamour of a selfish and ignoble philosophy which your every
instinct rejects, and which your heart entertains only because
it <em>is</em> your heart, and its heavenly sympathy has never
failed me yet.... Oh, Athalie, Athalie, it would be a shameful
day for me and a bitter day for you if my selfishness and irresolution
ever swerved you. What I have lost&mdash;if I have indeed lost it&mdash;is
lost irrevocably. And I've got to learn to face it."</p>

<p>She said, still gazing absently into the darkness: "Yes. But
I am just beginning to wonder what it is that <em>I</em> may have
lost,&mdash;what it is that I have never known."</p>

<p>"Don't think of it! Don't permit anything I have said or done
to trouble you or stir you toward such an awakening.... I don't
want to stand charged with that. You are tranquil, now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em><em>was</em>."</p>

<p>"You are still!" he said in quick concern. "Listen, Athalie&mdash;the
majority of men lose their grip at moments; men as irresolute
as I lose it oftener. Don't waste sympathy on me; it was nothing
but a whine born of a lesser impulse&mdash;born of emotions less decent
than you could comprehend&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maybe I am beginning to comprehend."</p>

<p>"You shall not! You shall remain as you are! Dear, don't you
realise that I can't steady myself unless I can look up to you?
You've raised yourself to where you stand; you've made your own
pedestal. Look down at me from it; don't ever <em>step</em> down;
don't ever condescend; don't ever let me think you mortal. You
are not, now. Don't ever descend entirely to my level&mdash;even if
we marry."</p>

<p>She turned, smiling too wisely, yet adorably: "What endless romance
there is in that boy's heart of yours! There always was,&mdash;when
you came running back to me where I stood alone by the closed
door,&mdash;when you found me living as all women who work live, and
made a beautiful home for me and gave me more than I wished to
take, asking nothing of me in return. Oh, Clive, you were chivalrous
and romantic, too, when you listened to your mother's wishes and
gave me up. I understand it so much better, now. I know how it
was&mdash;with your father dead and your beautiful mother, broken,
desolate, confiding to your keeping all her hope and pride and
future happiness,&mdash;all the traditions of the family, and its dignity
and honour!</p>

<p>"In the light of a clearer knowledge, do you suppose I blame
you now? Do you suppose I blame you for anything?&mdash;for your long
and broken-hearted and bitter silence?&mdash;for the quick resurgence
of your affection for me&mdash;for your love &mdash;Oh, Clive!&mdash;for
your passion?</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I think less of you because you love me&mdash;care
for me in the many and inexplicable ways that a man cares for
a woman?&mdash;because you want me as a man wants the woman he loves,
as his wife if it may be so, as his <em>own</em>, anyhow?"</p>

<p>She let her eyes rest on him in a new and fearless comprehension,
tender, curious, sad by turns.</p>

<p>"It is the romance of passion in you that has been fighting to
awaken the Sleeping Princess of a legend," she said with a slight
smile; "it is the same illogical, impulsive romance that draws
back just as her closed lids tremble, fearing to awaken her to
the sorrows and temptations of a world which, after all, God made
for us to wake in."</p>

<p>"Athalie! I am a scoundrel if I have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Clive!" she laughed, mocking the solemn measure of her own
words; "adorable boy of impulse and romance, never to outgrow
its magic armour, destined always to be ruled by dreams through
the sweetest and most generous of hearts, you need not fear for
me. I am already awake&mdash;at least I am sufficiently aroused to
understand you&mdash;and something, too, of my own self which I have
never hitherto understood."</p>

<p>For a second, lightly, she rested her warm, fresh cheek against
his. When it was burning she disengaged her fingers from his and
leaned aside against the rain-swept window.</p>

<p>"You see?" she said calmly but with heightened colour.... "I
am very human after all.... But it is still my mind that rules,
not my emotions."</p>

<p>She turned to him in her old sweetly humorous and mocking manner:</p>

<p>"That is all the romance of which I am capable, Clive&mdash;if there
be any real romance in a very clear mind. For it is my intellect
that must lead me to salvation or to destruction. If I am to come
crashing down at your feet, I shall have already planned the fall.
If I am to be destroyed, it will not be by any accident of romantic
emotion, of unconsidered impulse, or sudden blindness of passion;
it will be because my intelligence coolly courted destruction,
and accepted every chance, every hazard."</p>

<p>So spoke Athalie, smiling, in the full confidence and pride of
her superb youth, certain of the mind's autocracy over matter,
lightly defying within herself the latent tempest, of which she
as yet divined no more than the first exquisitely disturbing breeze;&mdash;deriding,
too, the as yet unloosened bolts of the old gods themselves,&mdash;the
white lightning of desire.</p>

<p>"Come," she said, half mockingly, half seriously, passing her
arm through Clive's;&mdash;"we are quite safe together in this safe
and sane old world&mdash;unless <em>I</em> choose&mdash;otherwise."</p>

<p>She turned and touched her lips lightly to his hair:</p>

<p>"So you may safely behave as irrationally, irresponsibly, and
romantically as you choose.... As long as I now am wide awake."</p>

<p>And then, for the first time, he realised his utter responsibility
to this girl who so gaily and audaciously relieved him of it.
And he understood how pitifully unarmed she really stood, and
how imminent the necessity for him to forge for himself the armour
of character, and to wear it eternally for his own safety as well
as hers.</p>

<p>"Good night, dear," he said.</p>

<p>In her new and magnificent self-confidence she turned and put
both arms around his neck, drawing his lips against hers.</p>

<p>But after he had gone she leaned against the closed door, less
confident, her heart beating too fast and hard to entirely justify
this new enfranchisement of the body, or her overwhelming faith
in its wise and trusted guardian, the mind.</p>

<p>And he went soberly on his way through the rain to his hotel,
troubled but determined upon his new rôle as his own soul's armourer.
All that was in him of romance and of chivalry was responding
passionately to the girl's unconscious revelation of her new need.</p>

<p>For now he realised that her boasted armour was of gauze; he
could see her naked heart beating behind it; he beheld, through
the shield she lifted on high to protect them both, the moon shining
with its false, reflected light.</p>

<p>Never did Athalie stand in such dire need of the armour she supposed
that she was wearing.</p>

<p>And he must put on his own, rapidly, and rivet it fast&mdash;the inflexible
mail of character which alone can shield such souls as his&mdash;and
hers.</p>

"It was a very different matter when you were travelling<br/>
about and I could say that you were off on another exploring<br/>
expedition. But your return from South America was mentioned<br/>
in the London papers; and the fact that you are now not<br/>
only in New York but that you have also gone into business<br/>
there is known and is the subject of comment.

</p>
<p>
"I shall be, as usual, perfectly frank with you; I do not<br/>
care whether you are here or not; in fact I infinitely<br/>
prefer your absence to your presence. But your engaging in<br/>
business in New York is a very different matter, and creates<br/>
a different situation for me.

</p>
<p>
"You like to travel. Why don't you do it? I don't care to be<br/>
the subject of gossip; and I shall be&mdash;am, no doubt,<br/>
already,&mdash;because you are making the situation too plain and<br/>
too public.

</p>
<p>
"It's well enough for one's friends to surmise the condition<br/>
of affairs; no unpleasantness for me results. But let it<br/>
once become newspaper gossip and my situation among people I<br/>
most earnestly desire to cultivate would become instantly<br/>
precarious and perhaps impossible.

</p>
<p>
"It is not necessary for me to inform you what is the very<br/>
insecure status of an American woman here, particularly in<br/>
view of the Court's well known state of mind concerning<br/>
marital irregularities.

</p>
<p>
"The King's views coincide with the Queen's. And the Queen's<br/>
are perfectly well known.

</p>
<p>
"If you continue your exploring expeditions, which you<br/>
evidently like to engage in, and if you report here at<br/>
intervals for the sake of appearances, I can get on very<br/>
well and very comfortably. But if you settle in New York and<br/>
engage in business there, and continue to remain away from<br/>
this country where you are popularly supposed to maintain<br/>
residences in town and country, I shall certainly begin to<br/>
experience very disagreeably the consequences of your<br/>
selfish conduct.

</p>
<p>
"Your reply to my last letter has thoroughly incensed me.

</p>
<p>
"You always have been selfish. From the time I had the<br/>
misfortune to marry you I had to suffer from your selfish,<br/>
self-centred, demonstrative, and rather common<br/>
character&mdash;until you finally learned that demonstration is<br/>
offensive to decent breeding, and that, although I happened<br/>
to be married to you, I intended to keep to my own notions<br/>
of delicacy, reserve, privacy, and self-respect.

</p>
<p>
"Of course you thought it a sufficient reason for us to have<br/>
children merely because <em>you</em> once thought you wanted them;<br/>
and I shall not forget what was your brutal attitude toward<br/>
me when I told you very plainly that I refused to be saddled<br/>
with the nasty, grubby little brats. Evidently you are<br/>
incapable of understanding any woman who is not half animal.

</p>
<p>
"I did not desire children, and that ought to have been<br/>
sufficient for you. I am not demonstrative toward anybody; I<br/>
leave that custom to my servants. And is it any crime if the<br/>
things that interest and appeal to you do not happen to<br/>
attract me?

</p>
<p>
"And I'll tell you now that your subjects of conversation<br/>
always bored me. I make no pretences; I frankly do not care<br/>
for what you so smugly designate as 'the things of the mind'<br/>
and 'things worth while.' I am no hypocrite: I like well<br/>
bred, well dressed people; I like what they do and say and<br/>
think. Their characters may be negative as you say, but<br/>
their poise and freedom from demonstration are most<br/>
agreeable to me.

</p>
<p>
"You politely designated them as fools, and what they said<br/>
you characterised as piffle. You had the exceedingly bad<br/>
taste to sneer at various members of an ancient and<br/>
established aristocracy&mdash;people who by inheritance from<br/>
generations of social authority, require no toleration from<br/>
such a man as you.

</p>
<p>
"These are the people who are my friends; among whom I enjoy<br/>
an established position. This position you now threaten by<br/>
coolly going into business in New York. In other and uglier<br/>
words you advertise to the world that you have abandoned<br/>
your home and wife.

</p>
<p>
"Of course I cannot help it if you insist on doing this<br/>
common and disgraceful thing.

</p>
<p>
"And I suppose, considering the reigning family's attitude<br/>
toward divorce, that you believe me to be at your mercy.

</p>
<p>
"Permit me to inform you that I am not. If, in a certain<br/>
set, wherein I now have the entrée, divorce is not<br/>
tolerated,&mdash;at any rate where the divorced wife of an<br/>
American would not be received,&mdash;nevertheless there are<br/>
other sets as desirable, perhaps even more desirable, and<br/>
which enjoy a prestige as weighty.

</p>
<p>
"And I'll tell you now that in case you persist in<br/>
affronting me by remaining in business in New York, I shall<br/>
be forced to procure a separation&mdash;possibly a divorce. And I<br/>
shall not suffer for it socially as no doubt you think I<br/>
will.

</p>
<p>
"There is only one reason why I have not done so<br/>
already&mdash;disinclination to be disturbed in a social milieu<br/>
which suits me. It's merely the inconvenience of a transfer<br/>
to another equally agreeable set.

</p>
<p>
"But if your selfish conduct forces me to make the change,<br/>
don't doubt for one minute, my friend, that I'm entirely<br/>
capable and able to accomplish it without any detriment or<br/>
anything worse than some slight inconvenience to myself.

</p>
<p>
"Whether it be a separation or a divorce I have not yet made<br/>
up my mind.

</p>
<p>
"There is only one reason why I should hesitate and that is<br/>
the thought that possibly you might be glad of your freedom.<br/>
If I were sure of that I'd punish you by asking for a<br/>
separation. But I do not suppose it really matters to you. I<br/>
think I know you well enough to know that you have no desire<br/>
to marry again. And, as for the young woman in whose company<br/>
you made yourself notorious before we were engaged&mdash;well, I<br/>
think you would hesitate to offer her marriage, or even,<br/>
perhaps, the not unprecedented privilege of being your<br/>
<em>chère amie</em>. I do you the honour of believing you too<br/>
fastidious to select a public fortune teller for your<br/>
mistress, or to parade a cheap trance-medium as a specimen<br/>
of your personal taste in pulchritude.

</p>
<p>
"Meanwhile your attitude in domestic matters continues to<br/>
annoy me. Be good enough to let me know, definitely, what<br/>
you propose to do, so that I may take proper measures to<br/>
protect myself&mdash;because I have always been obliged to<br/>
protect myself from you and your vulgar notions ever since<br/>
my mother and yours made a fool of me.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<em>WINIFRED STUART BAILEY</em>."

<p>With his care-worn eyes still fixed on the written pages he rested
his elbow on the table and dropped his head on his hand, heavily.</p>

<p>Rain swept the windows; the wind also was rising; his room seemed
to be full of sounds; even the clock which had a subdued tick
and a most discreet manner of announcing the passing of time,
seemed noisy to him.</p>

<p>"God! what a mess I've made of life," he said aloud. For a moment
a swift anger burned fiercely against the woman who had written
him; then the flame of it blew against himself, scorching him
with the wrath of self-contempt.</p>

<p>"Hell!" he said between his teeth. "It isn't the fault of that
little girl across the ocean. It's my fault, mine, and the fault
of nobody else."</p>

<p>Indecision, the weakness of a heart easily appealed to, the irresolution
of a man who was not man enough to guard and maintain his own
freedom of action and the right to live his own life&mdash;these had
encompassed the wrecking of him.</p>

<p>It seemed that he was at least man enough to admit it, generous
enough to concede it, even if perhaps it was not altogether true.</p>

<p>But never once had he permitted himself, even for a second, to
censure the part played by his mother in the catastrophe. That
he had been persuaded, swerved, over-ridden, dominated, was his
own fault.</p>

<p>The boy had been appealed to, subtly, cleverly, on his most vulnerable
side; he had been bothered and badgered and beset. Two women,
clever and hard as nails, had made up their minds to the marriage;
the third remained passive, indifferent, but acquiescent. Wiser,
firmer, and more experienced men than Clive had surrendered earlier.
Only the memory of Athalie held him at all;&mdash;some vague, indefinite
hope may have remained that somehow, somewhere, sometime, either
the world's attitude might change or he might develop the courage
to ignore it and to seek his happiness where it lay and let the
world howl.</p>

<p>That is probably all that held him at all. And after a while
the constant pressure snapped that thread. This was the result.</p>

<p>He lifted his head and stared, heavy-eyed, at his wife's letter.
Then, dropping the sheets to the floor he turned and laid both
arms upon the table and buried his face in them.</p>

<p>Toward morning his servant discovered him there, asleep.</p>
