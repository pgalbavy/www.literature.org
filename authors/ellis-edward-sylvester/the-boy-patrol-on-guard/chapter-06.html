<p>Gideon Landon sat talking with his friend Franklin Haynes in
the city home of the former one cold evening in the early spring
of 1912. You may recall that they had been estranged for a time,
but after the removal of the misunderstanding, they became more
intimate than before. They were associated in various business
deals and hardly a day passed without their seeing each other.</p>

<p>The subject of their conversation on this occasion was the Boy
Scouts of America, in which both were deeply interested, for they
knew that their sons, of whom you have already learned something,
had joined the organization.</p>

<p>"That fact led me to look closely into it," said Landon, "and
the more I learned about it the more I liked it; in my opinion
the Boy Scouts mark the grandest advance that has been made in
all history by the youths of any country. It will prove a mighty
factor in the betterment of mankind."</p>

<p>"It has started with such a boom," remarked Haynes, "that I fear
its collapse; such an enthusiasm as a rule soon expends itself;
action and reaction are equal and the higher the climb the greater
the fall."</p>

<p>"There will be nothing of the kind in this case, for there is
no element of weakness in the organization. It was originated
and is controlled by men who understand boy nature through and
through, and who know how to appeal to it. The very word ‘scout’
kindles that yearning which every healthy boy feels for stirring
incident. What youngster can resist the call of the fragrant woods,
the rugged climb of the mountains, the rollicking plunge and splash
in the crystalline waters, the trailing through the cool twilight
of the forest,—the fishing, canoeing, hunting with a tinge of
danger, the crackle of the camp fire, the stories of adventure,
the sweet dreamless sleep on the bed of spruce tops or balsam
boughs,—the songs of the birds——"</p>

<p>The friend raised his hand in protest,</p>

<p>"Cease, I pray thee. You remind me of the colored parson and
his deacon riding on mule back through the Arkansas lowlands.
The deacon depicted so eloquently the rapturous delicacy of browned
’possum, smothered in rich gravy, that the preacher suddenly gasped
and dived from his animal, splitting a boulder apart with his
head. As he climbed to his feet unharmed but slightly stunned,
he explained that he couldn’t stand the ravishing memories called
up by the deacon’s picture. And here you are discoursing so fascinatingly
on the out-door life, that I am tempted to clap on my hat and
overcoat and make a run of it for the pine woods."</p>

<p>"I believe I should do it myself, if it were not too early in
the season."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see you hiking for the woods; before you reached the
Grand Central you would switch off to Wall Street. You managed
to worry through a few weeks at Southport Island last summer,
and then on the first flimsy excuse you could think of, sneaked
back to New York and stayed there."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are right, Franklin; we didn’t begin early enough.
No danger of our boys making that blunder; those youngsters know
how to live and they will get all there is coming to them, when
they plunge into the wilds of Maine. Not only are their bodies
trained but their minds and consciences. I was impressed some
weeks ago when the Blazing Arrow Patrol held a meeting in my library
and by invitation I was present. I sat back and looked and listened.
It was the regular Saturday evening business session, when the
Scout Master presided and the usual order or schedule was followed.
The one feature that caught me was when the leader called upon
each Boy Scout to tell what ‘good turn’ he had done for some one
during the day. I then learned that each boy is pledged to do
at least one such kindness for some person every twenty-four hours.
I felt a lump in my throat as the youths popped up one after the
other and modestly told their stories. All the incidents were
trifling: one had volunteered to do an errand for his father or
mother; another had helped an old lady across the street; a third
had assisted a small boy in carrying a big bundle; another, when
challenged to fight by a young ruffian, had turned his back without
a word and walked away. ‘And I knew all the time I could lick
him,’ the scout added with a flash of his eyes; still another
had pointed out to a gentleman the best way to reach the Waldorf-Astoria,
and so it went.</p>

<p>"Think of it,—a boy on the lookout every day of his life for
a chance to do a good turn for some one else. Such a youngster
is sure very soon to beat that record; he will hit the four hundred
mark every year; that’s four thousand in ten years or twenty thousand
in a half century. Won’t that look fine, Franklin, on the credit
side of the great Book that will be opened at the Judgment Day?
Ah, I fear the balance will be on the other side of the account,
so far as <em>I’m</em> concerned."</p>

<p>"And with me, too," sighed his friend; "think what a different
world this will be when every one, even the children, is hunting
for an opportunity to do a kindness for a fellow creature."</p>

<p>"I wonder if the Boy Scouts would admit us into their organization,"
said Landon with a wee bit of earnestness.</p>

<p>"We are both old enough, which is about our only qualification.
We have done many turns for others, but they hardly deserve to
have the adjective ‘good’ applied to them."</p>

<p>"Well," sighed the elder millionaire, "I am so pleased with the
principles of the Boy Scouts, and they have had such good effect
upon Alvin—"</p>

<p>"The same is to be said of Chester."</p>

<p>"That I have decided to do the Blazing Arrow, the Stag and the
Eagle Patrols (which I believe are those that make up the troop)
a good turn which is so slight that it isn’t worth bragging about."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"You know I own the southern shore of Gosling Lake, which lies
in the lower part of Maine, a few miles from the bank of the Sheepscott.
Our club is about to put up a bungalow on that bank that will
serve for headquarters. Such of the members as wish will bunk
there while fishing this summer. It is the close season for game,
beside which there is little to be had in that section. I have
invited Scout Master Hall to spend the month of August there with
his boys."</p>

<p>"That is a long distance for them to travel and I’m afraid some
cannot afford the expense."</p>

<p>"It shall not cost any one a cent. It is to be simply an outing
for the troop, who will be the guests of Alvin."</p>

<p>"And Chester: I shall insist upon <em>that</em>."</p>

<p>"As you please. Our boys will go to Southport early in July,
or as soon as their schools close. They and Mike Murphy will manage
to worry through several weeks with the motor launch, until the
main party is ready to hike for the woods and all have their picnic
on Gosling Lake."</p>

<p>"I gather from what you say that this will not be the usual camping-out
experience, in which the boys put up their tents in the depth
of the woods and provide for their own wants."</p>

<p>"No; they will have something of the kind—to keep their hands
in, as may be said—during early spring and summer nearer their
own homes. They will continue to study woodcraft, undergo training,
perfect their discipline, and in short rough it like real scouts.
They will be on edge, and prepared to mix some of the conveniences
of life with the roughness of existence out of doors. Perhaps
you and I will feel like taking a turn at it ourselves, if they
will consent."</p>

<p>Haynes shook his head with a grim smile.</p>

<p>"As we agreed a few minutes ago, we have waited too long for
that. Your plan is admirable and does you credit."</p>

<p>"Precious little. If it is what may be called a good turn, it
is the only one of which I have been guilty in more years than
I like to think of."</p>

<p>"You say you have talked the plan over with Scout Master Hall?"</p>

<p>"He has spent several evenings with me discussing the scheme
with Alvin, Chester and myself. I may say it has been perfected;
the boys are all anxious to go, but a few of them will spend their
vacation in their homes. I believe we can count upon twenty guests
at the clubhouse on Gosling Lake."</p>

<p>"Call it an even score; that will be twenty good turns that you
will do others; you can’t help piling up several additional ones
during the dog days, and will be able to make a creditable report
when called upon."</p>

<p>"I never thought of that, but I’m blessed if it doesn’t give
me a comfortable sensation. I tell you, Franklin, the Boy Scouts
are the Junior Freemasons of society and the most powerful organization
ever formed for the advancement of the idea of the fatherhood
of God and the brotherhood of men. I shall do all I can to help
along the work."</p>

<p>"And I am with you. But let’s stick to practical facts. You and
I will send the troop into the Maine woods, at the beginning of
August, and see that every possible provision is made at the bungalow
for the boys. Won’t that place quite a task on your shoulders?"</p>

<p>"None whatever. When the boys arrive at the lake they will find
sleeping quarters awaiting them in the clubhouse. If they think
they are crowded, some of them can sleep in the woods, and it
will be just like the majority to do so. Of course they will take
their fishing tackle and such articles as they are likely to need
with them."</p>

<p>"What about firearms?"</p>

<p>"The only one of which I have heard is a revolver of which Scout
Master Hall is the proprietor. He talks as if he knows something
about the weapon, but in my opinion he is bluffing and doesn’t
know whether to aim the butt or muzzle at a target. Bear in mind
that the Boy Scouts don’t live to kill, and the safety of our
friends will never demand a gun or pistol. Several for amusement
may make a few bows and arrows, but not much will be done in that
line. They wear uniforms because they look natty, and they wouldn’t
be boys if they didn’t like to make a display. Beyond question
it helps to enforce discipline and assists in the military drill
which forms a part of their training."</p>

<p>"Will the camp be provided with boats?"</p>

<p>"Two large canoes are to be sent there from Portland and they
will be at the disposal of the scouts at all times."</p>

<p>"What of provisions and supplies?"</p>

<p>"You may be sure that we have guarded against famine. There is
a track of several miles from the lake through the woods to the
main road over which a strong team can be driven; thence the communication
is easy with Boothbay Harbor, where there is no end of provisions.
A wagon will make the trip once a week taking all that may be
needed to the camp."</p>

<p>"Those miles through the woods must be pretty tough traveling."</p>

<p>"That cannot be denied, but one of the things in Maine and many
other states that will amaze you is the terrific roads over which
teams seem to have little difficulty in making their way. Last
summer I strolled along the boardwalk ground the southern end
of Squirrel Island. I was puzzled by numerous tracks in the black
earth. There were ruts, hollows and cavities that looked as if
made by wagon wheels, but that appeared impossible, for the course
was choked with huge boulders and deep depressions over which
it seemed as if only a chamois or goat could leap. While I was
speculating and wondering I saw a horse coming toward me, dragging
a wagon in which sat a man in his shirt sleeves, driving. Straight
over those boulders and through the abrupt hollows, he plunged
and labored without halt or hesitation. Sometimes the hind wheels
bounced high in air with the front diving down, the body yawed
and was wrenched, and the driver wobbled from side to side and
forward and back, but he kept bravely on, and as he pitched and
lurched and bumped past, calmly called out that it was a pleasant
day. Compared with that roadway the few miles through the forest
to Gosling Lake will be like a macadamized turnpike."</p>

<p>The conversation thus recorded may form the framework of the
picture of the camp of the Boy Patrols on Gosling Lake. Omitting
the preliminaries which otherwise might be necessary, let us step
forward to that day, early in August, 1912, succeeding the arrival
of the lads at the bungalow on this beautiful sheet of water in
southern Maine. </p>
