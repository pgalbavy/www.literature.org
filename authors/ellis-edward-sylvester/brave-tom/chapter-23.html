<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>That night, after the establishment of Mr. Warmore was closed
and the employees had gone home, two persons remained behind to
engage in earnest consultation. They were the proprietor and G.
Field Catherwood, the young man who expected, at the end of the
year, to become an equal partner with him. The doors were fastened,
and the two sat alone in the private office, the expression on
the faces of both showing that some grave matter weighed upon
them.</p>

<p>"How long has this been going on?" asked Mr. Warmore.</p>

<p>"For two weeks or more; that is to say, I discovered it about
a fortnight ago. No doubt it has been kept up in a small way for
a long time previous to that."</p>

<p>"How much do you suppose has been taken altogether?"</p>

<p>"Several hundred dollars; perhaps a thousand."</p>

<p>"And your suspicions point to Mr. Gordon?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say they do. Of course he was the last one to
suspect; but, when I began quietly investigating, the trail led
unmistakably to him."</p>

<p>"What caused you first to suspect him, Mr. Catherwood?"</p>

<p>"Well, when a merchant finds some, one of his employees is robbing
him, the most natural thing to do is to look into the habits of
them all. If he discovers that one is living beyond his means,
he naturally probes a little farther; and, if his habits prove
to be extravagant, the suspicion increases."</p>

<p>"What did you find out about Mr. Gordon?"</p>

<p>"I accidentally learned that he has a considerable sum in the
savings-bank."</p>

<p>"He deserves credit for that."</p>

<p>"True, if that which was deposited was his own. Besides, he spends
a good deal of money."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"In the first place, on his clothes."</p>

<p>"He certainly is well dressed, but no more so than his salary
will permit."</p>

<p>"Last week he paid off a mortgage on the farm of Mr. Pitcairn,
and then made a present of it to the old gentleman."</p>

<p>"What was the amount?"</p>

<p>"Several thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken. Mr. Pitcairn told me of it three days ago.
He had promised Mr. Gordon not to tell any one; but the farmer
was so happy that he said he could not keep it back. It was only
three hundred dollars, however."</p>

<p>"Then I was misinformed," Catherwood hastened to say with a flush;
"but I happen to know he is speculating in Wall Street, and betting
on the races."</p>

<p>"That is bad; is your information reliable?"</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt of its truth."</p>

<p>"Have you any objection to telling me the channel through which
this knowledge reached you?"</p>

<p>"I would be glad to do so, but the source at present is confidential."</p>

<p>"Very well; I am sorry to hear this about Mr. Gordon, for, as
you know, I held him in high regard. For the present, let us keep
the matter a close secret. Do not let him see he is under suspicion,
and we will not move until certain there can be no mistake in
the matter."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the two walked out of the front door, which
was carefully locked behind them, and sauntered homeward. The
younger man went to the chief hotel of the town, while the elder
continued up the highway, thinking deeply over the subject he
had just discussed with Catherwood.</p>

<p>Now, it so happened that Josiah Warmore, the merchant, was a
far shrewder man than G. Field Catherwood suspected. If the latter
had been playing a part, so had the former.</p>

<p>As has been intimated, it came to the knowledge of the merchant,
about a fortnight before, that some one in his employ was systematically
robbing him. Gatherwood first dropped a hint, and then both investigated
so far as the opportunity allowed. The result turned suspicion
toward Tom Gordon. The merchant had learned, in the course of
his long and varied experience, the sad truth that no man in the
world can be picked out and declared, beyond all possibility of
doubt, to be absolutely honest. Thousands of people live and die
and go to their graves wrapped in the mantle of unassailable integrity.
It may be they have not defrauded a person out of a penny, for
the simple reason that the temptation has never been strong enough
to make them do so. Had it been a little stronger, they would
have succumbed. Others, after years of straightforward life, have
fallen. So it might be that, though he had given full trust to
Tom Gordon, he was not worthy to receive that trust. This half-belief
caused the chill in his treatment of the young man, so different
from that to which he had been accustomed. Before making up his
final judgment, however, Mr. Warmore resolved that every vestige
of doubt should be removed. He sent for Mr. Fyfe Lathewood, one
of the shrewdest detectives in New York City, told him all the
circumstances, and ordered him to find out the whole truth, no
matter what it cost, or where it might strike.</p>

<p>The detective had been at work the better part of a week, without
any one in Bellemore suspecting his identity or business. On the
afternoon of the day in which Tom Gordon checked the runaway pony
of Miss Warmore, the detective dropped into the store, as any
stranger might have done, made a few trifling purchases, and then
turned and walked out. As he did so, he managed to pass close
to the proprietor, who was standing at the front, and whispered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>It isn't Gordon; I'll see you to-night</em>."</p>

<p>Mr. Warmore was strolling homeward, swinging the heavy cane which
he always carried, when, in passing a small stretch of woods just
beyond the outskirts of the town, a man stepped from among the
trees with the stealth of a shadow and waited for him to approach.
The merchant hesitated a moment in doubt of his identity, but
the other spoke in a low voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's all right; come on."</p>

<p>"I wasn't quite sure," remarked Mr. Warmore, turning aside among
the trees, where he could talk with the detective without the
possibility of being seen or overheard.</p>

<p>"Well," said the merchant in a guarded voice, "what is it?"</p>

<p>"It was a dirty piece of business to throw suspicion on that
young Gordon. He is as innocent as you or I."</p>

<p>"What did you learn about him?"</p>

<p>"You told me of that mortgage which he paid off for the farmer
where he has lived so long."</p>

<p>"Yes; there is no doubt of the truth of that."</p>

<p>"He has been in your employ for four or five years. You tell
me he is saving, and has no bad habits. So the paying of such
a small mortgage ought not to be impossible."</p>

<p>"By no means."</p>

<p>"Nor would it be strange if he had a nest-egg in the savings-bank?"</p>

<p>"Knowing him as well as I do, I would be surprised if such was
not the fact. There is no one in the world dependent on him, and
his wages are liberal. But what about Wall Street and the races?"</p>

<p>"He has never risked a dollar there, I am sure of it."</p>

<p>"I had my doubts, but Catherwood told me he had positive information."</p>

<p>"He simply lied to you&mdash;that's all. Have you found how this money
is taken from you? Does it disappear through the day,&mdash;that is,
is it missing at night in making up the accounts, or is the money
short in the morning?"</p>

<p>"It has happened in both ways."</p>

<p>"You do not keep a private watchman?"</p>

<p>"We have one who passes along the front every half hour or so,
and looks in to see if the light is burning, and everything is
right. Two of the clerks sleep overhead, so it would seem that
such a thing as burglary is out of the question."</p>

<p>"Can you get me inside the store to-night without being seen?"</p>

<p>"I guess I can manage it," replied the merchant in surprise.</p>

<p>"How would you like to go with me? There will be no personal
danger. I will see to that."</p>

<p>"What time of the night do you wish to enter?"</p>

<p>"It isn't likely there will be a visitor before midnight; but,
to make sure, we will say about eleven."</p>

<p>"I can warn the watchman"&mdash;</p>

<p>"You mustn't think of such a thing! We must slip inside without
a soul knowing it. The watchman is the last one to trust."</p>

<p>"Do you suspect <em>him</em>?" asked the astonished Mr. Warmore.</p>

<p>"Not in the least; but you must never trust any person when it
can possibly be avoided. Doubtless, he means well, but he may
leak. The gentleman for whom we are looking might take it into
his head to quiz him: do you see?"</p>

<p>"It shall be as you say. Will you call for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it will be safe enough, I think, to do that."</p>

<p>After his family had retired, Mr. Warmore lit a cigar a few minutes
before the time mentioned, and sauntered down the path in front
of his house. Detective Lathewood was prompt, and met him at his
gate. They walked briskly along the highway, until they entered
the town and approached the large establishment which had been
in the possession of the Warmore family for the better part of
a century. The merchant's familiarity with his own premises enabled
him to enter by a back way, without attracting the attention of
the watchman or any one. They waited till the streets, which were
quite clear at that late hour, showed no one near, when they slipped
inside, and closed the door behind them.</p>

<p>It was important that the two clerks sleeping upstairs should
not be awakened; for they were not only likely to begin shooting,
if they heard intruders below, but, of necessity, would learn
of the project which the detective and the merchant had in mind.</p>

<p>Every foot was familiar to Mr. Warmore, who reached the large
main room of his establishment without mishap. Lathewood did the
same, by keeping close to him, and feeling each inch of the way.</p>

<p>Here there was a light burning; and they had to be extremely
careful, since their movements could be seen by any one passing
the front. The opportunities, however, for concealment were so
good that they readily secured a place where they could sit down
behind the far end of the counter, and remain unobserved in comfort.
This was done, and the trying wait began.</p>

<p>The detective was so accustomed to that sort of thing, that he
remained cool and collected. He would have liked to smoke a cigar
to help while away the time, but was too wise to attempt anything
of the kind. The odor of tobacco would be certain to warn any
one who entered by means of the front door.</p>

<p>Mr. Warmore was nervous, for the experience was new to him. He
succeeded by a great effort in keeping himself well in hand, venturing
only to whisper a word now and then.</p>

<p>"You don't think he is likely to come in the back way?" he asked
in a guarded undertone.</p>

<p>"There is not the slightest danger of his doing so. That would
look suspicious. He will use the front door, so, if seen and challenged,
he will be ready with the excuse that he has called on legitimate
business of his own. At the same time, he will try to manage it
so as not to be observed by any one. That watchman of yours is
not the keenest-eyed fellow in the world."</p>

<p>Some time later, just as the town clock finished booming the
hour of midnight, the officer touched the arm of his companion,
who said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I haven't noticed anything; what is it?"</p>

<p>"Did you hear some one walk past?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the footfall sounded plainly enough: what of it?"</p>

<p>"That is the third time that man has gone by. He is on the alert."</p>

<p>"It may have been different persons."</p>

<p>"It was the same man&mdash;sh! there he comes on the porch."</p>

<p>In the stillness of the night the sound was plainly heard. The
next moment a key turned in the lock of the door, which was silently
shoved inward.</p>

<p>The visitor, whoever he was, acted with the coolness of a professional.
He entered by the main door, so, if it chanced that any one saw
him, he could explain the cause of his visit. At the same time,
he made as sure as was possible that no one did see him. Knowing
the movements of the watchman, he waited until he was out of the
way, with the certainty that he would not be back again under
a half-hour at the least. That interval was more than sufficient
to do all that he had in mind, and to take his departure.</p>

<p>He opened the door so quietly that, but for the warning rattle
of the key, it would have been hard for the watchers to hear him.
Almost before they knew it he stood inside with the door closed.
Here the light fell upon him, and revealed his identity to the
men at the rear.</p>

<p>Neither was surprised. Although they had not mentioned their
suspicions to each other, both were morally certain the thief
would prove to be the man whom they now identified. G. Field Catherwood.</p>

<p>Walking quickly and softly across the floor to the private office,
which opened off from the other end of the counter, the prospective
partner of the business stooped down, turned the shining knob
of the safe round until the right combination had been struck,
and swung back the immense, massive door. Then from an inner drawer
he drew the merchant's bank-book, in which were clasped several
hundred dollars in bills. Two of the largest denomination&mdash;fifty
each&mdash;were withdrawn, and the book returned to its place.</p>

<p>No veteran could have been cooler than Catherwood. He looked
and acted no more like the exquisite on the steamboat than did
Tom Gordon himself. He was the sleek, cunning, hypocritical villain
he had always been, stealing, not because he was in need of money,
but because it was his nature to do so.</p>

<p>"<em>Well, Mr. Catherwood, it looks as if the account will be
a little short to-morrow</em>!"</p>

<p>The miscreant started as if he had heard the warning of a rattlesnake
at his feet. Turning like a flash, he saw Mr. Warmore standing
at his elbow. Had he received but a few seconds' notice, he might
have tried to bluff it out, by pretending he had come to look
after some matters about which he was not fully satisfied. Holding
the situation he did in the establishment, he could feel certain
no one would suspect him of any sinister purpose.</p>

<p>But the exposure dropped like a thunderbolt. He had not an instant
to prepare himself. He was caught in the act, and could explain
nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. Warmore, upon seeing who the thief was, whispered to the
detective,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Leave him to me; don't show yourself, unless he resists."</p>

<p>Before the shivering rogue could make protest, the merchant,
suppressing his anger, said with a coolness which surprised himself
as much as it did the officer crouching a few paces away, with
his hand on his revolver,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We will call the amount stolen an even thousand dollars, Mr.
Catherwood. How soon will you be prepared to restore it?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;why"&mdash;</p>

<p>"As a beginning, suppose you return that which you have just
taken."</p>

<p>Catherwood did as ordered without a word.</p>

<p>"Now re-lock the safe. Be sure you have the right combination.
No one knows it besides you and me. I will give you a week in
which to send back the rest."</p>

<p>G. Field Catherwood was recovering his nerve. He was furious
with himself that he had been so completely knocked out.</p>

<p>"Suppose I don't choose to return it, what then?"</p>

<p>"It will be ten years or more in State prison."</p>

<p>"Bah! you will have a sweet time proving anything against me."</p>

<p>"I have a witness at hand."</p>

<p>"W-w-what!"</p>

<p>"<em>Give me the word and I'll have the nippers on him before
you can say Jack Robinson</em>."</p>

<p>The detective, without rising to his feet or allowing himself
to be seen, uttered these words in such a sepulchral tone that
they almost lifted the hair on the head of the criminal. He started,
and stared affrightedly back in the gloom.</p>

<p>"What do you say?" asked the merchant.</p>

<p>"It's all right; it's all right. I'll send it to you as soon
as I can get back to the city. Don't be too hard on a fellow,
Warmore. I declare"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Enough has been said. Now go!"</p>

<p>He went.</p>

<p>"You are too tender-hearted," remarked Detective Lathewood, when
he and Mr. Warmore were walking homeward.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am; but mean as is the man, I shuddered at the thought
of disgracing and ruining him for life."</p>

<p>"But it was <em>he</em>, not <em>you</em>, who does that."</p>

<p>"True; I know that's the way you officers of the law look at
it. But this is not the first time I have had dealings with young
men who have yielded to temptation. I think it is safer to err
on the side of charity than that of sternness. It is better to
reform than to punish a man."</p>

<p>"Do you think you have reformed that specimen?"</p>

<p>"Far from it; he is the most contemptible scoundrel I ever knew.
He is rich, and therefore has no excuse for stealing. Worse than
all, he tried to ruin a young man whose shoe-latchet he is not
worthy to unloose."</p>

<p>"So you unloose <em>him</em>. But let him go. He is certain not
to trouble you or any of your family again."</p>

<p>Two days later Mr. Warmore received a certified check for nine
hundred dollars; and thus the account between him and G. Field
Catherwood was closed. He was never seen in Bellemore again. Ten
years later he died, while travelling abroad with a woman whom
he had made his wife. Then, for the first time, Tom Gordon learned
the particulars of the night when Mr. Warmore assisted the detective.</p>

<p>Let us take one more, and the final, leap forward. Three years
have passed since Tom Gordon checked runaway Jack, and saved the
life of pretty Jennie Warmore. They have been three years of undimmed
happiness to both; for during the last one of those years they
two became man and wife.</p>

<p>Oh, it all came about so naturally, that you would not care to
know the particulars. Tom was given a share in the business which
he had done so much to develop; and on the day previous to his
wedding his prospective father-in-law presented him with a half
interest, thus insuring him a handsome income for life.</p>

<p>Tom made one condition, which was carried out in spirit and letter.
Mr. Pitcairn, from whose hospitable roof he took his final departure,
was to have all the groceries, dry-goods, and every sort of supplies
from the store as long as he lived, without paying one penny therefor.
And it is a pleasure to record that this arrangement continued
without break until the old couple were finally laid to rest in
the churchyard beside poor Jim Travers who had passed on long
before.</p>

<p>Among the wedding presents to the bride was the locket and chain
which she herself had taken from her neck years previous, when
drowning in the North River, and linked about the button on the
coat of her rescuer. She and her parents were amazed beyond measure
as they stood with only her smiling husband present, examining
the treasure.</p>

<p>"It is the same," said the wondering mother, opening the locket,
and looking at the childish features, "the very one you wore about
your neck on that awful night."</p>

<p>"But where did it come from?" asked the father, taking it from
his wife's hand, and examining it with an interest that can hardly
be described.</p>

<p>"There is no name with it," added Jennie, "and&mdash;do you know anything
about it, Tom?" she asked abruptly, turning short upon him.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you years ago, when you related the story, that
the boy would turn up sooner or later. Well, he has done so, and
what of it?"</p>

<p>"But where is he?"</p>

<p>He opened his arms, and the proud, happy bride rushed into his
embrace, while the parents stared, not able quite to understand
what it all meant.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, looking around, "I was the fortunate boy who
jumped into the water after you, and found that chain wound round
the button of my coat. I have kept it and the locket ever since,
but I never knew you were the original until I heard the story
from your lips."</p>

<p>"You scamp!" exclaimed Mr. Warmore. "And you never said a word
about it."</p>

<p>"Yes, you mean fellow, why didn't you tell us?" demanded Jennie,
disposed to pout.</p>

<p>"You were sure you would know the young gentleman; and I meant
that if I ever gained your love you should love me for myself,
and not for any accident of the past."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but how jolly it would have been if we had known it was
you! For you see I have had two heroes all along. One was you,
and the other was that unknown boy who took a plunge in the icy
river for my sake."</p>

<p>"You may have those two heroes still," said Tom.</p>

<p>"So I have; but now the two are one."</p>

<p>"And so are <em>we</em>," he added, touching his lips to the
sweet mouth that did not refuse to meet them.</p>

<p>"And any way, I could not love you a bit more than I have all
along."</p>

<p>And the grateful, happy fellow, in looking back over his stormy
boyhood and young manhood, and feeling how strongly he had striven
at all times to live by the Golden Rule, knew in his heart that
it was to that fact that he had Fought the Battle that Won.</p>
