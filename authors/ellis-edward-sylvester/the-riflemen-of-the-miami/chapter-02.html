We will rear new trees under homes that glow<br/>
As if gems were the frontage of every bough;<br/>
O'er our white walls we will train the vine,<br/>
And sit in its shadow at day's decline,<br/>
And watch our herds as they range at will<br/>
Through the green savannas, all bright and still.

<p>The incident narrated in the preceding chapter occurred one autumn,
many years ago. In the spring succeeding this autumn, a company
of settlers, with their loaded teams, and unwieldy baggage, were
making their slow way through the labyrinths of an Ohio forest
to a sparse settlement buried many miles further in the wilderness.</p>

<p>At that day, so comparatively recent, such a sight was rarely
witnessed in this section, as a deep-rooted hostility existed
between the settlers and Indians, and an undertaking like the
present was attended with too great danger for it to be often
repeated. The rut of a single wagon, half obliterated by accumulated
leaves and rankly-growing grass, showed that this route had been
traveled over but once before, and that on the preceding season.
At regular intervals, trees were passed with chips hacked from
their sides, the track having first been "blazed" before being
passed over.</p>

<p>Like the emigrant-party which had preceded it, the present one
possessed but a single wagon, drawn by two pair of slow but powerful
oxen. It had a substantial cover, beneath which were stowed an
immense quantity of baggage and some six or eight children, including
also four women, two of whom were married and two unmarried. At
the side of the front oxen walked the driver, whose whole attention
was devoted to their direction. Several yards in advance rode
two horsemen, and beside them three men plodded forward on foot.
In the rear, scarcely a yard behind the lumbering wagon, walked
"old Caleb Smith," and his two overgrown sons, as proud of them
as was any monarch of his favorite generals. In addition to the
men enumerated, there were three more&mdash;who may properly be called
the scouts of the party. One of these was a couple of hundred
yards in advance, stealing his way along, as carefully as if pursued
by an unrelenting foe, his whole soul occupied in watching for
signs of the dusky red-men of the woods. At a somewhat less distance
on either side of the road, and in such a position as to be opposite
the wagon, was one of the remaining scouts, as watchful, vigilant
and skillful as the one referred to. Thus the party progressed,
neglecting no precaution that could make their safety more secure,
and although numerically small, still far more powerful than were
many emigrant-parties who had preceded them in penetrating other
portions of the Great West.</p>

<p>One of the young women, that we have mentioned as being in the
wagon, was Edith Sudbury, the heroine of the preceding chapter.
She had not a single relation among all those around her, and
it was certainly singular that she should have united her destinies
with those who, several months before, were entirely unknown to
her. But, though not related, every one was her friend. Her amiable
disposition, her grace and beauty of manners, her own prepossessing
appearance, and above all, her unremitting kindness to every one
with whom she came in contact, had won upon the hearts of all.
Old Smith's two sons, Jim and Harry, one eighteen the other twenty,
both over six feet in height, looked upon "little Edith" as nothing
more than a baby, and woe betide the one who dared to offer her
harm or insult in their presence!</p>

<p>"I say, father, how much further ahead is that creek we've got
to cross?" asked Jim, in a free and easy manner, as he would have
spoken to an equal.</p>

<p>"Well, sonny, it must be nigh on to ten mile."</p>

<p>"Won't get over afore morning then?"</p>

<p>"Don't expect to, as you see it's well along in the after noon."</p>

<p>"Let's see&mdash;we've come over forty mile, hain't we?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jim, nearer fifty."</p>

<p>"Well, we're that much nearer the settlement, <em>that's</em>
certain. If we get over the creek without much trouble with the
oxen, we may fetch up there by sundown, eh?"</p>

<p>"That's the expectation, I believe."</p>

<p>"Provided, of course, <em>the Injins don't make trouble</em>."</p>

<p>"Sh! not so loud, Jim," continued Harry. "They might hear us
in the wagon, and I don't s'pose you'd want to scare Edith, when
there's no need of it."</p>

<p>"I should like to see any one try that same thing on 'em. They'd
be somebody else scared, I reckon. But, father," asked Jim, in
an earnest whisper, "how is it about the Injins? We haven't seen
a sign of one yet, and that's what gets me."</p>

<p>The parent and his children fell a few yards further behind,
and commenced conversing together in suppressed voices.</p>

<p>"I tell you what, boys," said the father, "it won't do to expect
to get through without hot work. I've been talking with the scouts,
and they think the same. I believe a number are following us,
and waiting only for the proper place to come in upon us."</p>

<p>"Where do you suppose that will be?"</p>

<p>"<em>The creek!</em>"</p>

<p>"Shouldn't wonder if 'twas," said Harry, in a matter-of-fact
tone; "if we only had the women-folks out the way, we might count
on some tall fun. I wish Edith was taken care of."</p>

<p>"That's the deuce of it. I should think she got enough of the
imps last autumn, when the Riflemen left her at our house; but
that's the <em>Injin</em>, especially the Shawnee part of it.
If there's any chance to get scalps with long hair, they're bound
to do it. However, boys, it won't do to lose heart."</p>

<p>"That's the fact, father, and I reckon none of this crowd intend
to do that thing just now. Sam, in front, isn't likely to get
asleep, is he?"</p>

<p>"No danger of him. They say he never shuts both eyes at the same
time."</p>

<p>"I'll answer for them on the sides of the road," added Harry.
"If there's a greasy Shawnee in a mile, Jake Laughlin will scent
him. You mind the time, Jim, when he went with us over into Kentucky,
and he saved us from running into that ambush?"</p>

<p>"'Tain't likely I'll ever forget it, being I got my arm bored
with some of their lead."</p>

<p>"Well, that affair satisfied me that Jake Laughlin understands
as much as it is worth while to understand about Injin deviltries,
and that he ain't likely to be blind when there's so much to practice
eyesight on."</p>

<p>"I'd give our yoke of oxen this minute, if I could only set eyes
on Lew Dernor and his boys, the Riflemen of the Miami," said the
parent. "They've been long together, as I s'pose, and have been
in more Injin fights and scrimmages than any men living, and yet
not one of them has been grazed by a bullet. There's Tom O'Hara,
whose legs are so short that he's about as tall when he sits down
as he is when he stands up, and yet, I'll be hanged if he isn't
the luckiest one of the lot. They're a wonderful set of boys,
are those Riflemen."</p>

<p>"Father," said son Jim, with a meaning smile, "you remember the
night that Lew brought Edith to our house?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do."</p>

<p>"Didn't it strike you that he acted queerly then?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean? I don't understand you. I noticed nothing."</p>

<p>"I did. I saw how he watched Edith, and I made up my mind that
he was in <em>love with her</em>! Since then I've found out it
<em>was</em> so!"</p>

<p>"Why, Jim, I never dreamed of such a thing. He hasn't been to
our house since to see her."</p>

<p>"Just because he <em>is</em> in love! I've met him in the woods
a dozen times since, and by the way in which he questioned me,
I'd been a downright fool if I hadn't understood him."</p>

<p>This avowal seemed to trouble the father, as he bent his head;
and, for a while, nothing further was said. But Jim, who had little
reverence for sentiment or romance, added, in a meaning voice:</p>

<p>"That isn't all, father."</p>

<p>"What else have you to tell?"</p>

<p>"That Edith loves him!"</p>

<p>"Thunder! I don't believe it."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say <em>positively</em> that she does; but I know
she <em>likes</em> him, and if Lew Dernor has a mind he can get
her. You don't appear to like it, father."</p>

<p>"I don't care much, but the gal seems so like my own da'ter,
being I never had any, that I should hate despritly to lose her."</p>

<p>"Fudge! it's got to come to that sooner or later, and who could
she get better than Lew Dernor, the leader of the Miami Riflemen?"</p>

<p>"None, that's the fact, but&#11834;"</p>

<p>A footstep attracted their attention, and looking up, they saw
Jake Laughlin step into view. He raised his hand, as if to command
silence, jerking his thumb at the same time significantly toward
the wagon and the rest of the settlers. He stepped carefully into
the wagon-track, and the father and sons halted.</p>

<p>"It's so," said he, nodding his head several times.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"I've seen sign a half-dozen times since noon."</p>

<p>"Shawnees, I s'pose?"</p>

<p>"Yes. There are plenty of them in the woods."</p>

<p>"What are they waiting for?"</p>

<p>"The chance. There ain't enough, and we're too wide awake to
allow them to attack us at present. They're waiting to take us
off our guard or to get us at disadvantage. I've an idee where
that'll be."</p>

<p>"The creek?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly. There's where the tug of war will come, and
I think if we should encamp to-night without a guard there would
be no danger of attack from the Shawnees."</p>

<p>"Are you going to warn others?"</p>

<p>"Not until night, I think, as there is no necessity for it."</p>

<p>"Well, we don't need to tell you to be on the look-out. You know
we've got a lot of women-folks to take care of."</p>

<p>"Never fear."</p>

<p>With this, Laughlin stole back into the wood, as cautiously as
he had emerged from it, and the father and his sons quickened
their pace in order to gain the ground they had lost. As they
resumed their places in the rear of the wagon, no one would have
suspected from their actions and appearance, that they had been
conversing upon a subject so important to all.</p>

<p>It was about the middle of the afternoon, and the emigrant-party
plodded patiently forward, chatting and conversing upon ordinary
topics with such pleasantry and zest that no one would have suspected
the least thought of danger had entered their heads. So long as
the silence of the scouts continued, the emigrants knew there
was no cause for alarm. Should danger threaten, they would be
warned in time.</p>

<p>An hour later, as they were proceeding quietly along, the near
report of a rifle broke upon their ears. Every face blanched,
and every heart beat faster at the startling signal of danger.
This it meant, and nothing else; and the members of the company
instinctively halted, and made a partial preparation for an attack.
They had scarcely done so, when Laughlin, with his cat-like tread,
stepped in among them.</p>

<p>"What made you fire, Jake?" asked Dravoond, one of the leaders
of the party.</p>

<p>"Me fire? I haven't pulled trigger since I shot the wild turkey
yesterday. It must have been Sam or Myrick."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the latter two, who were the other scouts, also
made their appearance, when, to the surprise of all, it was discovered
that neither of them had fired the alarming shot. Consequently,
it must have been done by a stranger. The moment this fact became
known, the scouts separated and resumed their duties, while the
emigrants, after a short consultation, moved on again, more slowly
and carefully than before.</p>

<p>On the whole, although the report of the rifle could not be explained
by any of the emigrants, the majority were disposed to take it
rather as a favorable sign than otherwise. If made by an Indian,
it could not have been done accidentally, for such a thing rarely
if ever was known among them; and, as it could not have been fired
by an enemy, with the full knowledge of the vicinity of the emigrants,
the savages, if savages they were, must either be unaware of the
latter fact, or else the strange shot came from a white man.</p>

<p>If there were lurking Indians in the wood, ignorant of the presence
of the whites, they were soon apprised, for both of the leading
oxen, who had not done such a thing for days, now paused and bellowed
terrifically for several moments. The driver endeavored to check
their dreadful noise by whacking them over the heads, but it availed
nothing. They were determined, and continued the clamor, pausing
now and then, as though pleased with the echo, which could be
heard rolling through the woods for over a mile distant. Having
finished, they resumed their progress, as if satisfied with what
they had done.</p>

<p>"Father, them's our oxen," said Jim, "and, by thunder, if they
bawl out that way agin I'll shoot 'em both. How far did you say
the settlement is off?"</p>

<p>"Forty or fifty miles. Why do you ask again?"</p>

<p>"Nothin', only if they've put any of their babies asleep to-day,
them oxen have set them all to squalling agin."</p>

<p>The sun was getting well down toward the horizon, and the dim
twilight was wrapping the woods in its mantle, when the teamster
halted the oxen, and the emigrants commenced their preparations
for the encampment. The wagon was left standing in its tracks,
the oxen simply unfastened, and with their yokes on, led to where
some bundles of hay were spread upon the ground. A large fire
was soon blazing and crackling a short distance away, around which
the women were engaged in preparing the evening meal, while the
men, who wandered hither and thither apparently without any definite
object, neglected no precaution which could insure them against
attack through the night. The three scouts had extended their
beats several hundred yards, and completely reconnoitered the
ground intervening between them and the camp-fire, so that they
felt some assurance of safety as they joined their friends in
the evening meal.</p>

<p>Just as they all had finished partaking of this, a second rifle
report, as near to them as was the first, broke the stillness.
The men started to their feet and grasped their weapons. They
gazed all around them, as if expecting the appearance of some
one, but failing to see any thing, commenced speculating upon
the cause of this singular repetition of what had puzzled them
so at first.</p>

<p>"It beats my larning to explain it," said old Smith.</p>

<p>"I tell you what it is," said son Harry, "that ain't an Injin's
piece, nohow you can fix it."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" queried brother Jim.</p>

<p>"It's the same gun we heard this afternoon, and when you see
a Shawnee do that I'll believe our oxen don't know how to beller."</p>

<p>"We must be ready, my friends, for the worst," said one of the
emigrants, who, up to this time, had not referred to the danger
at all.</p>

<p>Another reconnoissance was made by the scouts, but with no better
success than before. The darkness of the wood was such that they
labored at great disadvantage, and it would have been no difficult
matter for a single person to have remained concealed within a
short distance of the whites.</p>

<p>As the night progressed, the females and children retired to
the wagon, and the men chose their stations around it. The oxen,
one by one, sunk heavily to the earth, contentedly chewing their
cuds, and a stillness as profound as that of the tomb settled
upon the forest. The fire had smouldered to a few embers, which
glowed with a dim redness through the ashes, and occasionally
disclosed a shadowy form as it hurried by.</p>

<p>Several of the men were sleeping soundly, for enough were on
duty as sentinels to make them feel as much ease as it was possible
to feel where they could never be assured of perfect safety. Two
of the most faithful sentinels were Jim and Harry Smith, who were
stationed within a few feet of each other. Now and then they exchanged
a word or two, but the risk was too great to attempt any thing
like a continued conversation.</p>

<p>Three separate times Jim was sure he heard a footstep near him,
and as often did he turn his head and fail to discover the meaning
of it. Finally, he caught a glimpse of some one as he brushed
hurriedly by and disappeared in the darkness. He raised his gun,
and was on the point of firing, when he lowered it again. The
thought that probably it was a white man, and a dislike to give
the camp a groundless alarm, was the cause of this failure to
fire.</p>

<p>Several times again through the night did he detect a foot-fall,
but he was not able to catch sight of the stranger. Shortly after
midnight the evidences of his visit ceased, and Jim concluded
that he had withdrawn so as to be beyond sight when daylight broke.</p>

<p>What was his surprise, therefore, when he saw, as the gray light
of morning stole through the wood, the form of a man seated on
the ground, with his head reclining against a tree and sound asleep.
If this surprise was great, it became absolute amazement when
he examined his features, and saw that the man was no other than
Lewis Dernor, the leader of the Riflemen of the Miami! Jim could
scarce believe his senses as he walked forward and shook the sleeper
by the shoulder.</p>

<p>"I should as soon have expected to see Mad Anthony himself as
to see you, Lew Dernor, sitting here sound asleep," said he, as
the Rifleman opened his eyes and looked about him. A smile crossed
his handsome countenance as he replied:</p>

<p>"I believe I have been sleeping."</p>

<p>"I believe you have, too. Have you been hanging around here all
night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and all day, too."</p>

<p>"And was it you who fired those shots?"</p>

<p>"I fired my rifle once or twice, I believe."</p>

<p>"Good! Well, Lew, we're glad to see you, and we would be a deuced
sight gladder if we could see the rest of the Riflemen. Where
are they?"</p>

<p>"Up the Miami, I suppose. At any rate, that's where I left them."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm afraid we're getting into hot water here, Lew, to
tell the truth, and there's no one whose face would be more welcome
just now than yours. I see they are beginning to wake up and show
themselves. Gavoon has started the fire, so s'pose we go in and
you make yourself known."</p>

<p>The hunter followed young Smith to the camp, where, in a short
time, he met and shook hands with most of the settlers, who were
indeed glad enough to see him; and this gladness was increased
to delight when he expressed his willingness to accompany them
across the dreaded creek. In the course of a half-hour the females
began to make their appearance. Near by was a small stream where
they performed their ablutions, which finished, they gathered
around the camp-fire, and busied themselves with preparing the
breakfast of the party.</p>

<p>Dernor, the Rifleman, was conversing with one of the settlers,
when some one touched him on the shoulder. Looking around, he
encountered his friend, Jim Smith.</p>

<p>"Here's a person I s'pose you've no objection to see," said he,
with a light laugh.</p>

<p>The bronzed face of the hunter deepened its hue as he saw Edith
Sudbury approaching, and although gifted with a natural grace
of manner, he displayed some embarrassment as he advanced to greet
her. Her conduct, too, was not without its suspicious air. Rosy
and fresh as the flowers of the green woods around, perhaps the
carnation of her cheeks was caused only by the morning exercise.
Jim noticed these manifestations, and quietly smiled, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>In regard to the Rifleman, at least, he was right. As that brave
and gallant-hearted ranger wandered through the grand old forests
of Ohio, and the cane-brakes of the "Dark and Bloody Ground,"
a fair face had haunted his waking and dreaming hours. As he knelt
beside the sparkling brook to slake his thirst, he beheld the
same features reflected beside his own in its mirror-like surface.
As alone he threaded his way through the labyrinths of those dim
solitudes, he had a fairy companion as faithful to him as his
own shadow. And when with his tried and faithful followers, it
was the same. Only in the excitement of the fight, or the moments
when his strategic skill was in rivalry with that of his dusky
enemies, did this shadowy being cease to haunt him. Night and
day, it was the same&mdash;and now he had met the <em>reality</em>,
and was conversing with her.</p>

<p>The conversation lasted but a few minutes. The services of Edith
were needed, and she tripped away to assist the others at their
duties. As she disappeared, Jim came up and laughingly remarked
to the Rifleman:</p>

<p>"A fine girl that, Lewis."</p>

<p>"Indeed she is. I never have heard her name&mdash;that is, nothing
more than Edith. What is the rest?"</p>

<p>"Sudbury &mdash;Edith Sudbury."</p>

<p>The hunter started, as if bitten by a rattlesnake, and turned
as pale as death. Young Smith noticed his emotion, and asked,
with some alarm:</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Lew? What is there about that name that so
troubles you?"</p>

<p>"Never mind, Jim. I did not think it was <em>her</em>!"</p>

<p>Smith had too much natural kindness of heart to refer to a subject
so painful to the hunter, although his curiosity was great to
know what could possibly have affected him so strangely. As nothing
further was said by Dernor, this curiosity remained unsatisfied
for a long time.</p>

<p>The emigrant-party shortly after was under way. When within a
mile or so of the creek to which we have referred, one of the
scouts reconnoitered it, and came in with the report that quite
a body of Shawnees were on its banks, and beyond a doubt were
waiting for the company to come up. Dernor coincided in this opinion,
and held a consultation with the male members of the party. The
result of this consultation was a determination on his part to
make all haste to the rendezvous of the Riflemen of the Miami,
and bring them hither, the settlers agreeing to halt and await
their arrival. The danger that menaced them was certainly great
to make this step necessary.</p>
