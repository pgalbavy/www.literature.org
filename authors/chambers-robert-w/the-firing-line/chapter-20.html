<p>One evening in April, returning with a few brace of trout, they
found the mail-bag awaiting them on the hall table; and Portlaw
distributed the contents, proclaiming, as usual, his expectation
of a letter from Malcourt.</p>

<p>There was none. And, too peevish and disappointed to even open
the heterogeneous mass of letters and newspapers, he slumped sulkily
in his chair, feet on the fender, biting into his extinct cigar.</p>

<p>"That devilish Louis," he said, "has been away for several of
the most accursedly lonely weeks I ever spent.... No reflection
on you, Hamil &mdash;Oh, I beg your pardon; I didn't see you were
busy&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hamil had not even heard him. He was busy&mdash;very busy with a letter&mdash;dozens
of sheets of a single letter, closely written, smeared in places&mdash;the
letter that had come at last!</p>

<p>In the fading light he bent low over the pages. Later a servant
lighted the lamps; later still Portlaw went into the library,
drew out a book bound in crushed levant, pushed an electric button,
and sat down. The book bound so admirably in crushed levant was
a cook-book; the bell he rang summoned his cook.</p>

<p>In the lamplit living-room the younger man bent over the letter
that had come at last. It was dated early in April; had been written
at Palm Beach, carried to New York, but had only been consigned
to the mails within thirty-six hours:</p>

<p>   "I have had all your letters&mdash;but no courage to answer. Now
you    will write no more.</p>

<p>   "Dear&mdash;this, my first letter to you, is also my last. I know
now    what the condemned feel who write in the hour of death.</p>

<p>   "When you went away on Thursday I could not leave my room
to say    good-bye to you. Gray came and knocked, but I was not
fit to be    seen. If I hadn't looked so dreadfully I wouldn't
have minded    being ill. You know that a little illness would
not have kept me    from coming to say good-bye to you.</p>

<p>   "So you went away, all alone with Gray. I remained in bed
that    day with the room darkened. Mother and Cecile were troubled
but    could not bring themselves to believe that my collapse
was due to    your going. It was not logical, you know, as we
all expected to    see you in a week or two in New York.</p>

<p>   "So they had Dr. Vernam, and I took what he prescribed, and   
nobody attached any undue importance to the matter. So I was left   
to myself, and I lay and thought out what I had to do.</p>

<p>   "Dear    &mdash;I knew there was only one thing to do; I knew
whither my    love&mdash;our love&mdash;was carrying me&mdash;faster and faster&mdash;spite
of all    I'd said. <em>Said</em>! What are words beside such
love as ours? What    would be my affection for dad and mother
beside my love for you?    Would your loyalty and your dear self-denial
continue to help me    when they only make me love you more intensely?</p>

<p>   "There is only one thing clear in all this pitiful confusion;   
<em>I&mdash;</em>whom they took and made their child&mdash;cannot sacrifice
them!    And yet I <em>would</em>!&mdash;oh, Garry!    &mdash;I would
for you. There was no    safety for me at all as long as there
was the slightest chance to    sacrifice everything&mdash;everybody&mdash;and
give myself to you.</p>

<p>   "Listen! On the second day after you left I was sitting with   
mother and Cecile on the terrace. We were quietly discussing the   
closing of the house and other harmless domestic matters. All
at    once there swept over me such a terrible sense of desolation
that    I think I lost my mind; for the next thing I knew I was
standing    in my own room, dressed for travelling&mdash;with a hand-bag
in my    hand.</p>

<p>   "It was my maid knocking that brought me to my senses: I had
been    going away to find you; that was all I could realise.
And I sank    on my bed, trembling; and presently fell into the
grief-stricken    lethargy which is all I know now of sleep.</p>

<p>   "But when I woke to face the dreadful day again, I knew the
time    had come. And I went to mother that evening and told her.</p>

<p>   "But, Garry, there is never to be any escape from deception,
it    seems; I had to make her think I <em>wanted</em> to acknowledge
and take    up life with my husband. My life is to be a living
lie!...</p>

<p>   "As I expected, mother was shocked and grieved beyond words&mdash;and,   
dearest, they are bitterly disappointed; they all had hoped it   
would be <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>   "She says there must positively be another ceremony. I don't
know    how dad will take it&mdash;but mother is so good, so certain
of his    forgiving me.</p>

<p>   "It wrings my heart&mdash;the silent astonishment of Cecile and   
Gray&mdash;and their trying to make the best of it, and mother,   
smiling for my sake, tender, forgiving, solicitous, and deep   
under all bitterly disappointed. Oh, well&mdash;she can bear that   
better than disgrace.</p>

<p>   "I've been crying over this letter; that's what all this blotting   
means.</p>

<p>   "Now I can never see you again; never touch your hand, never
look    into those brown eyes again    &mdash;Garry! Garry!&mdash;never
while life    lasts.</p>

<p>   "I ask forgiveness for all the harm my love has done to you,
for    all the pain it has caused you, for the unhappiness that,
please    God, will not endure with you too long.</p>

<p>   "I have tried to pray that the pain will not last too long
for    you; I will try to pray that you may love another woman
and    forget all this unhappiness.</p>

<p>   "Think of me as one who died, loving you. I cling to this
paper    as though it were your hand. But&mdash;</p>

<p>   "Dearest&mdash;dearest    &mdash;Good-by.</p>

<p>
"<em>SHIELA CARDROSS</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>When Portlaw came in from his culinary conference he found Hamil
scattering the black ashes of a letter among the cinders.</p>

<p>"Well, we're going to try an old English receipt on those trout,"
he began cheerfully&mdash;and stopped short at sight of Hamil's face.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked bluntly.</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>Hamil returned to his chair and picked up a book; Portlaw looked
at him for a moment, then, perplexed, sorted his mail and began
to open the envelopes.</p>

<p>"Bills, bills," he muttered, "appeals for some confounded foundlings'
hospital&mdash;all the eternal junk my flesh is heir to&mdash;and a letter
from a lawyer&mdash;let them sue!&mdash;and a&mdash;a&mdash;hey! what the devil&mdash;what
the&mdash;"</p>

<p>Portlaw was on his feet, startled eyes fairly protruding as he
scanned incredulously the engraved card between his pudgy fingers.</p>

<p>"O Lord!" he bellowed; "it's all up! The entire bally business
has gone up! That pup of a Louis!&mdash;Oh, there's no use! &mdash;Look
here, Hamil! I tell you I can't believe it, I can't, and I won't&mdash;<em>Look</em>
what that fool card says!"</p>

<p>And Hamil's stunned gaze fell on the engraved card:</p>

<p>"Mr. and Mrs. Neville Cardross have the honour of announcing
the marriage of their daughter Shiela to Mr. Louis Malcourt."</p>

<p>The date and place followed.</p>

<p>Portlaw was making considerable noise over the matter, running
about distractedly with little, short, waddling steps. Occasionally
he aimed a kick at a stuffed arm-chair, which did not hurt his
foot too much.</p>

<p>It was some time before he calmed enough to pout and fume and
protest in his usual manner, appealing alternately to Heaven as
witness and to Hamil for corroboration that he had been outrageously
used.</p>

<p>"Now, who the devil could suspect him of such intention!" wailed
poor Portlaw. "God knows, he was casual with the sex. There have
been dozens of them, Hamil, literally dozens in every port!&mdash;from
Mamie and Stella up to Gladys and Ethelberta! Yes, he was Harry
to some and Reginald to others&mdash;high, low&mdash;and the game, Hamil&mdash;the
game amused him; but so help me kings and aces! I never looked
for this&mdash;never so help me; and I thought him as safe with the
Vere-de-Veres as he was with the Pudding Sisters, Farina and Tapioca!
And now"&mdash;passionately displaying the engraved card&mdash;"look who's
here!... O pip! What's the use."</p>

<p>Dinner modified his grief; hope bubbled in the Burgundy, simmered
in the soup, grew out of gravy like the sturdy, eternal weed she
is, parasitic in the human breast.</p>

<p>"He's probably married a million or so," suggested Portlaw, mollified
under the seductive appeal of a fruit salad dressed with a mixture
containing nearly a hundred different ingredients. "If he has
I don't see why he shouldn't build a camp next to mine. I'll give
him the land&mdash;if he doesn't care to pay for it," he added cautiously.
"Don't say anything to him about it, Hamil. After all, why shouldn't
he pay for the land?... But if he doesn't want to&mdash;between you
and me &mdash;I'll come within appreciable distance of almost
giving him what land he needs.... O gee! O fizz! That damn Louis!...
And I'm wondering&mdash;about several matters&mdash;"</p>

<p>After dinner Portlaw settled down by the fire, cigar lighted,
and began to compose a letter to Malcourt, embodying his vivid
ideas concerning a new house near his own for the bridal pair.</p>

<p>Hamil went out into the fresh April night. The young grass was
wet under the stars; a delicate fragrance of new buds filled the
air.</p>

<p>He had been walking for a long time, when the first far hint
of thunder broke the forest silence. Later lightning began to
quiver through the darkness; a wind awaking overhead whispered
prophecy, wailed it, foreboding; then slowly the woods filled
with the roar of the rain.</p>

<p>He was moving on, blindly, at random, conscious only of the necessity
of motion. Where the underbrush halted him he sheered off into
the open timber, feeling his way, falling sometimes, lying where
he fell for a while till the scourge of necessity lashed him into
motion again.</p>

<p>About midnight the rain increased to a deluge, slackened fitfully,
and died out in a light rattle of thunder; star after star broke
out through the dainty vapours overhead; the trees sighed and
grew quiet. For a while drumming drops from the branches filled
the silence with a musical tattoo, then there remained no sound
save, far away in the darkness, the muffled roar of some brook,
brimming bank-high with the April rain. And Hamil, soaked, exhausted,
and believing he could sleep, went back to the house. Toward morning
sleep came.</p>

<p>He awoke restless and depressed; and the next morning he was
not well; and not quite as well the next, remaining in his room
with a headache, pestered by Portlaw and retinues of servants
bearing delicacies on trays.</p>

<p>He had developed a cold, not a very bad one, and on the third
day he resumed his duties in the woods with Phelps and Baker,
the surveyors, and young Hastings.</p>

<p>The dull, stupid physical depression hung on to him; so did his
cold; and he found breathing difficult at night. The weather had
turned very raw and harsh, culminating in a flurry of snow.</p>

<p>Then one morning he appeared at breakfast looking so ghastly
that Portlaw became alarmed. It seemed to be rather late for that;
Hamil's face was already turning a dreadful bluish white under
his host's astonished gaze, and as the first chill seized him
he rose from the table, reeling.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I am sorry, Portlaw," he tried to say.</p>

<p>"What on earth have you got?" asked Portlaw in a panic; but Hamil
could not speak.</p>

<p>They got him to the gardener's cottage as a precautionary measure,
and telephoned to Utica for trained nurses, and to Pride's Fall
for a doctor. Meanwhile, Hamil, in bed, was fast becoming mentally
irresponsible as the infection spread, involving both lungs, and
the fever in his veins blazed into a conflagration. That is one
way that pneumonia begins; but it ought not to have made such
brutally quick work of a young, healthy, and care-free man. There
was not much chance for him by the next morning, and less the
following night when the oxygen tanks arrived.</p>

<p>Portlaw, profoundly shocked and still too stunned by the swiftness
of the calamity to credit a tragic outcome, spent the day in a
heavily bewildered condition, wandering, between meals, from his
house to the cottage where Hamil lay, and back again to the telephone.</p>

<p>He had physicians in consultation from Utica and Albany; he had
nurses and oxygen; he had Miss Palliser on the telephone, first
in New York, then at Albany, and finally at Pride's Fall, to tell
her that Hamil was alive.</p>

<p>She arrived after midnight with Wayward. Hamil was still breathing&mdash;if
it could be called by that name.</p>

<p>Toward dawn a long-distance call summoned Portlaw: Malcourt was
on the end of the wire.</p>

<p>"Is Hamil ill up at your place?"</p>

<p>"He is," said Portlaw curtly.</p>

<p>"Very ill?"</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>"How ill?"</p>

<p>"Well, he's not dead."</p>

<p>"Portlaw, is he dying?"</p>

<p>"They don't know yet."</p>

<p>"What is the sickness?"</p>

<p>"Pneumonia. I wish to heaven you were here!" he burst out, unable
to suppress his smouldering irritation any longer.</p>

<p>"I was going to ask you if you wanted me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You needn't ask such a fool question. Your house is here for
you and the servants are eating their heads off. I haven't had
your resignation and I don't expect it while we're in trouble....
Mrs. Malcourt will come with you, of course."</p>

<p>"Hold the wire."</p>

<p>Portlaw held it for a few minutes, then:</p>

<p>"Mr. Portlaw?"&mdash;scarcely audible.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Mrs. Malcourt?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... Is Mr. Hamil going to die?"</p>

<p>"We don't know, Mrs. Malcourt. We are doing all we can. It came
suddenly; we were caught unprepared&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Suddenly, you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it hit him like a bullet. He ought to have broken the journey
northward; he was not well when he arrived, but I never for a
moment thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Portlaw&mdash;please!"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Is there a chance for him?"</p>

<p>"The doctors refuse to say so."</p>

<p>"Do they say there is <em>no</em> chance?"</p>

<p>"They haven't said that, Mrs. Malcourt. I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please, Mr. Portlaw!"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam!"</p>

<p>"Will you listen very carefully, please?"</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Malcourt and I are leaving on the 10.20. You will please
consult your time-table and keep us informed at the following
stations&mdash;have you a pencil to write them down?... Are you ready
now? Ossining, Hudson, Albany, Fonda, and Pride's Fall.... Thank
you.... Mr. Malcourt wishes you to send the Morgan horses....
If there is any change in Mr. Hamil's condition before the train
leaves the Grand Central at 10.20, let me know. I will be at the
telephone station until the last moment. Telegrams for the train
should be directed to me aboard "The Seminole"&mdash;the private car
of Mr. Cardross.... Is all this clear?... Thank you."</p>

<p>With a confused idea that he was being ordered about too frequently
of late Portlaw waddled off bedward; but sleep eluded him; he
lay there watching through his window the light in the window
of the sick-room where Hamil lay fighting for breath; and sometimes
he quivered all over in scared foreboding, and sometimes the thought
that Malcourt was returning seemed to ease for a moment the dread
load of responsibility that was already playing the mischief with
his digestion.</p>

<p>A curry had started it; a midnight golden-buck superimposed upon
a miniature mince pie had, to his grief and indignation, continued
an outrageous conspiracy against his liver begun by the shock
of Hamil's illness. But what completed his exasperation was the
indifference of the physicians attending Hamil who did not seem
to appreciate the gravity of an impaired digestive system, or
comprehend that a man who couldn't enjoy eating might as well
be in Hamil's condition; and Portlaw angrily swallowed the calomel
so indifferently shoved toward him and hunted up Wayward, to whom
he aired his deeply injured feelings.</p>

<p>"What you need are 'Drover's Remedies,'" observed Wayward, peering
at him through his spectacles; and Portlaw unsuspiciously made
a memorandum of the famous live-stock and kennel panacea for future
personal emergencies.</p>

<p>The weather was unfavourable for Hamil; a raw, wet wind rattled
the windows; the east lowered thick and gray with hurrying clouds;
volleys of chilly rain swept across the clearing from time to
time.</p>

<p>Portlaw and Wayward sat most of the time in the big living-room
playing "Canfield." There was nothing else to do except to linger
somewhere within call, and wait. Constance Palliser remained near
whichever nurse happened to be off duty, and close enough to the
sick-room to shudder at what she heard from within, all day, all
night, ceaselessly ominous, pitiable, heart-breaking.</p>

<p>At length Wayward took her away without ceremony into the open
air.</p>

<p>"Look here, Constance, your sitting there and hearing such things
isn't helping Garry. Lansdale is doing everything that can be
done; Miss Race and Miss Clay are competent. You're simply frightening
yourself sick&mdash;"</p>

<p>She protested, but he put her into a hooded ulster, buckled on
her feet a pair of heavy carriage boots, and drew her arm under
his, saying: "If there's a chance Garry is having it, and you've
got to keep your strength.... I wish this mist would clear; Hooper
telephoned to Pride's for the weather bulletin, but it is not
encouraging."</p>

<p>They walked about for an hour and finally returned from the wet
woodland paths to the bridge, leaning on the stone parapet together.</p>

<p>A swollen brook roared under the arches, carrying on its amber
wave-crests tufts of green grass and young leaves and buds which
the promise of summer had tenderly unfolded to the mercy of a
ruthless flood.</p>

<p>"Like those young lives that go out too early," murmured Constance.
"See that little wind-flower, Jim, uprooted, drowning&mdash;and that
dead thing tumbling about half under water&mdash;"</p>

<p>Wayward laid a firm hand across hers.</p>

<p>"I don't mean to be morbid," she said with a pathetic upward
glance, "but, Jim, it is too awful to hear him fighting for just&mdash;just
a chance to breathe a little&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think he's going to get well," said Wayward.</p>

<p>"Jim! Why do you think it? Has any&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No.... I just think it."</p>

<p>"Is there any reason&mdash;"</p>

<p>"None&mdash;except you."</p>

<p>His voice within the last month or two had almost entirely lost
its indistinct and husky undertone; the clear resonant quality,
which had always thrilled her a little as a young girl, seemed
to be returning; and now she felt, faintly, the old response awaking
within her.</p>

<p>"It is very sweet of you to believe he'll live because I love
him," she said gently.</p>

<p>Wayward drew his hand from hers and, folding his arms, leaned
on the parapet inspecting the turbid water through his spectacles.</p>

<p>"There are no fights too desperate to be won," he said. "The
thing to do is to finish&mdash;still fighting!"</p>

<p>"Jim?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>This time her hand sought his, drew it toward her, and covered
it with both of hers.</p>

<p>"Jim," she said tremulously, "there is something &mdash;I am
horribly afraid&mdash;that&mdash;perhaps Garry is not fighting."</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked bluntly.</p>

<p>"There was an&mdash;an attachment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A what?"</p>

<p>"An unfortunate affair; he was very deeply in love&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not ridiculously, I hope!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean.... He cared more than I have believed
possible; I saw him in New York on his way here and, Jim, he must
have known then, for he looked like death&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean he was in love with that Cardross girl?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes!... I do not understand the affair; but I tell
you, Jim, the strangest part was that the girl loved him! If ever
a woman was in love with a man, Shiela Cardross was in love with
Garry! I tell you I know it; I am not guessing, not hazarding
an opinion; I <em>know</em> it.... And she married Louis Malcourt!...
And, Jim, I have been so frightened&mdash;so terrified&mdash;for Garry&mdash;so
afraid that he might not care to fight&mdash;"</p>

<p>Wayward leaned there heavily and in silence. He was going to
say that men do not do such things for women any longer, but he
thought of the awful battle not yet ended which he had endured
for the sake of the woman beside him; and he said nothing; because
he knew that, without hope of her to help him, the battle had
long since gone against him. But Garry had nothing to fight for,
if what Constance said was true. And within him his latent distrust
and contempt for Malcourt blazed up, tightening the stern lines
of his sun-burnt visage.</p>

<p>"Portlaw says that Louis is coming to-night, and that young Mrs.
Malcourt is with him," he observed.</p>

<p>"I know it.... I was wondering if there was any way we could
use her&mdash;make use of her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To stir up Garry to fight?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes&mdash;something like that &mdash;I am vague about it myself&mdash;if
it could be done without anybody suspecting the&mdash;O Jim! &mdash;I
don't know; I am only a half-crazed woman willing to do anything
for my boy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly. If there's anything that might benefit Garry you
need not hesitate on account of that little beast Malcourt&mdash;"</p>

<p>She said in her gentle, earnest way: "Louis Malcourt is so very
strange. He has treated Virginia dreadfully; they were engaged&mdash;they
must have been or she could not have gone all to pieces the way
she has.... I cannot understand it, Jim&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's Louis coming here for?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Portlaw begged him to come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What for? Oh, well, I guess I can answer that for myself; it's
to save Portlaw some trouble or other&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are very hard on people&mdash;very intolerant, sometimes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have no illusions concerning the unselfishness of Billy Portlaw.
Look at him tagging after the doctors and bawling for pills!&mdash;with
Garry lying there! He hustled him into a cottage, too&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was quite right, Jim, Garry is better off&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So's William. Don't tell <em>me</em>, Constance; he's always
been the same; he never really cared for anybody in all his life
except Louis Malcourt. But it's a jolly, fat, good-humoured beast,
and excellent company aboard the <em>Ariani!</em>" ... He was
silent a moment, then his voice deepened to a clear, gentle tone,
almost tender: "You've been rained on enough, now; come in by
the fire and I'll bring you the latest news from Garry."</p>

<p>But when he returned to the fire where Constance and Portlaw
sat in silence, the report he brought was only negative. A third
doctor from Albany arrived at nightfall and left an hour later.
He was non-committal and in a hurry, and very, very famous.</p>
