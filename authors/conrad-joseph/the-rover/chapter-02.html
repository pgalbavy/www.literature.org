<p>Citizen Peyrol stayed at the inn-yard gate till the night had
swallowed up all those features of the land to which his eyes
had clung as long as the last gleams of daylight. And even after
the last gleams had gone he had remained for some time staring
into the darkness, in which all he could distinguish was the white
road at his feet and the black heads of pines where the cart track
dipped towards the coast. He did not go indoors till some carters
who had been refreshing themselves had departed with their big
two-wheeled carts, piled up high with empty wine-casks, in the
direction of Fréjus. The fact that they did not remain for the
night pleased Peyrol. He ate his bit of supper alone, in silence,
and with a gravity which intimidated the old woman who had aroused
in him the memory of his mother. Having finished his pipe and
obtained a bit of candle in a tin candlestick, Citizen Peyrol
went heavily upstairs to rejoin his luggage. The crazy staircase
shook and groaned under his feet as though he had been carrying
a burden. The first thing he did was to close the shutters most
carefully as though he had been afraid of a breath of night air.
Next he bolted the door of the room. Then sitting on the floor,
with the candlestick standing before him between his widely straggled
legs, he began to undress, flinging off his coat and dragging
his shirt hastily over his head. The secret of his heavy movements
was disclosed then in the fact that he had been wearing next his
bare skin&mdash;like a pious penitent his hair-shirt&mdash;a sort of waistcoat
made of two thicknesses of old sail-cloth and stitched all over
in the manner of a quilt with tarred twine. Three horn buttons
closed it in front. He undid them, and after he had slipped off
the two shoulder-straps which prevented this strange garment from
sagging down on his hips he started rolling it up. Notwithstanding
all his care there were during this operation several faint chinks
of some metal which could not have been lead.</p>

<p>His bare torso thrown backwards and sustained by his rigid big
arms heavily tattooed on the white skin above the elbows, Peyrol
drew a long breath into his broad chest with a pepper and salt
pelt down the breastbone. And not only was the breast of Citizen
Peyrol relieved to the fullest of its athletic capacity, but a
change had also come over his large physiognomy on which the expression
of severe stolidity had been simply the result of physical discomfort.
It isn’t a trifle to have to carry girt about your ribs and hung
from your shoulders a mass of mixed foreign coins equal to sixty
or seventy thousand francs in hard cash; while as to the paper
money of the Republic, Peyrol had had already enough experience
of it to estimate the equivalent in cartloads. A thousand of them.
Perhaps two thousand. Enough in any case to justify his flight
of fancy, while looking at the countryside in the light of the
sunset, that what he had on him would buy all that soil from which
he had sprung: houses, woods, vines, olives, vegetable gardens,
rocks and salt lagoons&mdash;in fact, the whole landscape, including
the animals in it. But Peyrol did not care for the land at all.
He did not want to own any part of the solid earth for which he
had no love. All he wanted from it was a quiet nook, an obscure
corner out of men’s sight where he could dig a hole unobserved.</p>

<p>That would have to be done pretty soon, he thought. One could
not live for an indefinite number of days with a treasure strapped
round one’s chest. Meantime, an utter stranger in his native country
the landing on which was perhaps the biggest adventure in his
adventurous life, he threw his jacket over the rolled-up waistcoat
and laid his head down on it after extinguishing the candle. The
night was warm. The floor of the room happened to be of planks,
not of tiles. He was no stranger to that sort of couch. With his
cudgel laid ready at his hand Peyrol slept soundly till the noises
and the voices about the house and on the road woke him up shortly
after sunrise. He threw open the shutter, welcoming the morning
light and the morning breeze in the full enjoyment of idleness
which, to a seaman of his kind, is inseparable from the fact of
being on shore. There was nothing to trouble his thoughts; and
though his physiognomy was far from being vacant, it did not wear
the aspect of profound meditation.</p>

<p>It had been by the merest accident that he had discovered during
the passage, in a secret recess within one of the lockers of his
prize, two bags of mixed coins: gold mohurs, Dutch ducats, Spanish
pieces, English guineas. After making that discovery he had suffered
from no doubts whatever. Loot, big or little, was a natural fact
of his freebooter’s life. And now when by the force of things
he had become a master-gunner of the Navy he was not going to
give up his find to confounded landsmen, mere sharks, hungry quill-drivers,
who would put it in their own pockets. As to imparting the intelligence
to his crew (all bad characters), he was much too wise to do anything
of the kind. They would not have been above cutting his throat.
An old fighting sea-dog, a Brother of the Coast, had more right
to such plunder than anybody on earth. So at odd times, while
at sea, he had busied himself within the privacy of his cabin
in constructing the ingenious canvas waistcoat in which he could
take his treasure ashore secretly. It was bulky, but his garments
were of an ample cut, and no wretched customs-guard would dare
to lay hands on a successful prize-master going to the Port Admiral’s
offices to make his report. The scheme had worked perfectly. He
found, however, that this secret garment, which was worth precisely
its weight in gold, tried his endurance more than he had expected.
It wearied his body and even depressed his spirits somewhat. It
made him less active and also less communicative. It reminded
him all the time that he must not get into trouble of any sort&mdash;keep
clear of rows, of intimacies, of promiscuous jollities. This was
one of the reasons why he had been anxious to get away from the
town. Once, however, his head was laid on his treasure he could
sleep the sleep of the just.</p>

<p>Nevertheless in the morning he shrank from putting it on again.
With a mixture of sailor’s carelessness and of old-standing belief
in his own luck he simply stuffed the precious waistcoat up the
flue of the empty fireplace. Then he dressed and had his breakfast.
An hour later, mounted on a hired mule, he started down the track
as calmly as though setting out to explore the mysteries of a
desert island.</p>

<p>His aim was the end of the peninsula which, advancing like a
colossal jetty into the sea, divides the picturesque roadstead
of Hyères from the headlands and curves of the coast forming the
approaches of the Port of Toulon. The path along which the sure-footed
mule took him (for Peyrol, once he had put its head the right
way, made no attempt at steering) descended rapidly to a plain
of arid aspect, with the white gleams of the Salins in the distance,
bounded by bluish hills of no great elevation. Soon all traces
of human habitations disappeared from before his roaming eyes.
This part of his native country was more foreign to him than the
shores of the Mozambique Channel, the coral strands of India,
the forests of Madagascar. Before long he found himself on the
neck of the Giens peninsula, impregnated with salt and containing
a blue lagoon, particularly blue, darker and even more still than
the expanses of the sea to the right and left of it, from which
it was separated by narrow strips of land not a hundred yards
wide in places. The track ran indistinct, presenting no wheel-ruts,
and with patches of efflorescent salt as white as snow between
the tufts of wiry grass and the particularly dead-looking bushes.
The whole neck of land was so low that it seemed to have no more
thickness than a sheet of paper laid on the sea. Citizen Peyrol
saw on the level of his eye, as if from a mere raft, sails of
various craft, some white and some brown, while before him his
native island of Porquerolles rose dull and solid beyond a wide
strip of water. The mule, which knew rather better than Citizen
Peyrol where it was going to, took him presently amongst the gentle
rises at the end of the peninsula. The slopes were covered with
scanty grass; crooked boundary walls of dry stones ran across
the fields, and above them, here and there, peeped a low roof
of red tiles shaded by the heads of delicate acacias. At a turn
of the ravine appeared a village with its few houses, mostly with
their blind walls to the path, and, at first, no living soul in
sight. Three tall platanes, very ragged as to their bark and very
poor as to foliage, stood in a group in an open space; and Citizen
Peyrol was cheered up by the sight of a dog sleeping in the shade.
The mule swerved with great determination towards a massive stone
trough under the village fountain. Peyrol, looking round from
the saddle while the mule drank, could see no signs of an inn.
Then, examining the ground nearer to him, he perceived a ragged
man sitting on a stone. He had a broad leathern belt and his legs
were bare to the knee. He was contemplating the stranger on the
mule with stony surprise. His dark nut-brown face contrasted strongly
with his grey shock of hair. At a sign from Peyrol he showed no
reluctance and approached him readily without changing the stony
character of his stare.</p>

<p>The thought that if he had remained at home he would have probably
looked like that man crossed unbidden the mind of Peyrol. With
that gravity from which he seldom departed he inquired if there
were any inhabitants besides himself in the village. Then, to
Peyrol’s surprise, that destitute idler smiled pleasantly and
said that the people were out looking after their bits of land.</p>

<p>There was enough of the peasant-born in Peyrol, still, to remark
that he had seen no man, woman, or child, or four-footed beast
for hours, and that he would hardly have thought that there was
any land worth looking after anywhere around. But the other insisted.
Well, they were working on it all the same, at least those that
had any.</p>

<p>At the sound of the voices the dog got up with a strange air
of being all backbone, and, approaching in dismal fidelity, stood
with his nose close to his master’s calves.</p>

<p>"And you," said Peyrol, "you have no land then?" The man took
his time to answer. "I have a boat."</p>

<p>Peyrol became interested when the man explained that his boat
was on the salt pond, the large, deserted and opaque sheet of
water lying dead between the two great bays of the living sea.
Peyrol wondered aloud why anyone should want a boat on it.</p>

<p>"There is fish there," said the man.</p>

<p>"And is the boat all your worldly goods?" asked Peyrol.</p>

<p>The flies buzzed, the mule hung its head, moving its ears and
flapping its thin tail languidly.</p>

<p>"I have a sort of hut down by the lagoon and a net or two," the
man confessed, as it were. Peyrol, looking down, completed the
list by saying: "And this dog."</p>

<p>The man again took his time to say:</p>

<p>"He is company."</p>

<p>Peyrol sat as serious as a judge. "You haven’t much to make a
living of," he delivered himself at last. "However!... Is there
no inn, café, or some place where one could put up for a day?
I have heard up inland that there was some such place."</p>

<p>"I will show it to you," said the man, who then went back to
where he had been sitting and picked up a large empty basket before
he led the way. His dog followed with his head and tail low, and
then came Peyrol dangling his heels against the sides of the intelligent
mule, which seemed to know beforehand all that was going to happen.
At the corner where the houses ended there stood an old wooden
cross stuck into a square block of stone. The lonely boatman of
the Lagoon of Pesquiers pointed in the direction of a branching
path where the rises terminating the peninsula sank into a shallow
pass. There were leaning pines on the skyline, and in the pass
itself dull silvery green patches of olive orchards below a long
yellow wall backed by dark cypresses, and the red roofs of buildings
which seemed to belong to a farm.</p>

<p>"Will they lodge me there?" asked Peyrol.</p>

<p>"I don’t know. They will have plenty of room, that’s certain.
There are no travellers here. But as for a place of refreshment,
it used to be that. You have only got to walk in. If he isn’t
there, the mistress is sure to be there to serve you. She belongs
to the place. She was born on it. We know all about her."</p>

<p>"What sort of woman is she?" asked Citizen Peyrol, who was very
favourably impressed by the aspect of the place.</p>

<p>"Well, you are going there. You shall soon see. She is young."</p>

<p>"And the husband?" asked Peyrol, who, looking down into the other’s
steady upward stare, detected a flicker in the brown, slightly
faded eyes. "Why are you staring at me like this? I haven’t got
a black skin, have I?"</p>

<p>The other smiled, showing in the thick pepper and salt growth
on his face as sound a set of teeth as Citizen Peyrol himself.
There was in his bearing something embarrassed, but not unfriendly,
and he uttered a phrase from which Peyrol discovered that the
man before him, the lonely hirsute, sunburnt and barelegged human
being at his stirrup, nourished patriotic suspicions as to his
character. And this seemed to him outrageous. He wanted to know
in a severe voice whether he looked like a confounded landsman
of any kind. He swore also without, however, losing any of the
dignity of expression inherent in his type of features and in
the very modelling of his flesh.</p>

<p>"For an aristocrat you don’t look like one, but neither do you
look like a farmer or a pedlar or a patriot. You don’t look like
anything that has been seen here for years and years and years.
You look like one, I dare hardly say what. You might be a priest."</p>

<p>Astonishment kept Peyrol perfectly quiet on his mule. "Do I dream?"
he asked himself mentally. "You aren’t mad?" he asked aloud. "Do
you know what you are talking about? Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?"</p>

<p>"All the same," persisted the other innocently, "it is much less
than ten years ago since I saw one of them of the sort they call
Bishops, who had a face exactly like yours."</p>

<p>Instinctively Peyrol passed his hand over his face. What could
there be in it? Peyrol could not remember ever having seen a Bishop
in his life. The fellow stuck to his point, for he puckered his
brow and murmured:</p>

<p>"Others too.... I remember perfectly.... It isn’t so many years
ago. Some of them skulk amongst the villages yet, for all the
chasing they got from the patriots."</p>

<p>The sun blazed on the boulders and stones and bushes in the perfect
stillness of the air. The mule, disregarding with republican austerity
the neighbourhood of a stable within less than a hundred and twenty
yards, dropped its head, and even its ears, and dozed as if in
the middle of a desert. The dog, apparently changed into stone
at his master’s heel, seemed to be dozing too with his nose near
the ground. Peyrol had fallen into a deep meditation, and the
boatman of the lagoon awaited the solution of his doubts without
eagerness and with something like a grin within his thick beard.
Peyrol’s face cleared. He had solved the problem, but there was
a shade of vexation in his tone.</p>

<p>"Well, it can’t be helped," he said. "I learned to shave from
the English. I suppose that’s what’s the matter."</p>

<p>At the name of the English the boatman pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>"One can’t tell where they are all gone to," he murmured. "Only
three years ago they swarmed about this coast in their big ships.
You saw nothing but them, and they were fighting all round Toulon
on land. Then in a week or two, crac!&mdash;nobody! Cleared out devil
knows where. But perhaps you would know."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Peyrol, "I know all about the English, don’t
you worry your head."</p>

<p>"I am not troubling my head. It is for you to think about what’s
best to say when you speak with him up there. I mean the master
of the farm."</p>

<p>"He can’t be a better patriot than I am, for all my shaven face,"
said Peyrol. "That would only seem strange to a savage like you."</p>

<p>With an unexpected sigh the man sat down at the foot of the cross,
and, immediately, his dog went off a little way and curled himself
up amongst the tufts of grass.</p>

<p>"We are all savages here," said the forlorn fisherman from the
lagoon. "But the master up there is a real patriot from the town.
If you were ever to go to Toulon and ask people about him they
would tell you. He first became busy purveying the guillotine
when they were purifying the town from all aristocrats. That was
even before the English came in. After the English got driven
out there was more of that work than the guillotine could do.
They had to kill traitors in the streets, in cellars, in their
beds. The corpses of men and women were lying in heaps along the
quays. There were a good many of his sort that got the name of
drinkers of blood. Well, he was one of the best of them. I am
only just telling you."</p>

<p>Peyrol nodded. "That will do me all right," he said. And before
he could pick up the reins and hit it with his heels the mule,
as though it had just waited for his words, started off along
the path.</p>

<p>In less than five minutes Peyrol was dismounting in front of
a low, long addition to a tall farmhouse with very few windows,
and flanked by walls of stones enclosing not only the yard but
apparently a field or two also. A gateway stood open to the left,
but Peyrol dismounted at the door, through which he entered a
bare room, with rough whitewashed walls and a few wooden chairs
and tables, which might have been a rustic café. He tapped with
his knuckles on the table. A young woman with a fichu round her
neck and a striped white and red skirt, with black hair and a
red mouth, appeared in an inner doorway.</p>

<p>"Bonjour, citoyenne," said Peyrol. She was so startled by the
unusual aspect of this stranger that she answered him only by
a murmured "Bonjour," but in a moment she came forward and waited
expectantly. The perfect oval of her face, the colour of her smooth
cheeks, and the whiteness of her throat forced from the Citizen
Peyrol a slight hiss through his clenched teeth.</p>

<p>"I am thirsty, of course," he said, "but what I really want is
to know whether I can stay here."</p>

<p>The sound of a mule’s hoofs outside caused Peyrol to start, but
the woman arrested him.</p>

<p>"She is only going to the shed. She knows the way. As to what
you said, the master will be here directly. Nobody ever comes
here. And how long would you want to stay?"</p>

<p>The old rover of the seas looked at her searchingly.</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, citoyenne, it may be in a manner of speaking
for ever."</p>

<p>She smiled in a bright flash of teeth, without gaiety or any
change in her restless eyes that roamed about the empty room as
though Peyrol had come in attended by a mob of shades.</p>

<p>"It’s like me," she said. "I lived as a child here."</p>

<p>"You are but little more than that now," said Peyrol, examining
her with a feeling that was no longer surprise or curiosity, but
seemed to be lodged in his very breast.</p>

<p>"Are you a patriot?" she asked, still surveying the invisible
company in the room.</p>

<p>Peyrol, who had thought that he had "done with all that damned
nonsense," felt angry and also at a loss for an answer.</p>

<p>"I am a Frenchman," he said bluntly.</p>

<p>"Arlette!" called out an aged woman’s voice through the open
inner door.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" she answered readily.</p>

<p>"There’s a saddled mule come into the yard."</p>

<p>"All right. The man is here." Her eyes, which had steadied, began
to wander again all round and about the motionless Peyrol. She
moved a step nearer to him and asked in a low confidential tone:
"Have you ever carried a woman’s head on a pike?"</p>

<p>Peyrol, who had seen fights, massacres on land and sea, towns
taken by assault by savage warriors, who had killed men in attack
and defence, found himself at first bereft of speech by this simple
question, and next moved to speak bitterly.</p>

<p>"No. I have heard men boast of having done so. They were mostly
braggarts with craven hearts. But what is all this to you?"</p>

<p>She was not listening to him, the edge of her white even teeth
pressing her lower lip, her eyes never at rest. Peyrol remembered
suddenly the sans-culotte&mdash;the blood-drinker. Her husband. Was
it possible?... Well, perhaps it was possible. He could not tell.
He felt his utter incompetence. As to catching her glance, you
might just as well have tried to catch a wild sea-bird with your
hands. And altogether she was like a sea-bird&mdash;not to be grasped.
But Peyrol knew how to be patient, with that patience that is
so often a form of courage. He was known for it. It had served
him well in dangerous situations. Once it had positively saved
his life. Nothing but patience. He could well wait now. He waited.
And suddenly as if tamed by his patience this strange creature
dropped her eyelids, advanced quite close to him and began to
finger the lapel of his coat&mdash;something that a child might have
done. Peyrol all but gasped with surprise, but he remained perfectly
still. He was disposed to hold his breath. He was touched by a
soft indefinite emotion, and as her eyelids remained lowered till
her black lashes seemed to lie like a shadow on her pale cheek,
there was no need for him to force a smile. After the first moment
he was not even surprised. It was merely the sudden movement,
not the nature of the act itself, that had startled him.</p>

<p>"Yes. You may stay. I think we shall be friends. I’ll tell you
about the Revolution."</p>

<p>At these words Peyrol, the man of violent deeds, felt something
like a chill breath at the back of his head.</p>

<p>"What’s the good of that?" he said.</p>

<p>"It must be," she said and backed away from him swiftly, and
without raising her eyes turned round and was gone in a moment,
so lightly that one would have thought her feet had not touched
the ground. Peyrol, staring at the open kitchen door, saw after
a moment an elderly woman’s head, with brown thin cheeks and tied
up in a coloured handkerchief, peeping at him fearfully.</p>

<p>"A bottle of wine, please," he shouted at it.</p>
