<p>When Gerald Buxton's shotgun was fired by him, and the report
rang out in the still night, it awoke several persons, who wondered
what it meant. No one gave the matter further thought, however,
until an old lady, facing the main street, looked through her
bedroom window and saw the citizen chasing his boy, who toted
a gun over his shoulder. At the first streakings of daylight she
hurried to the Buxton home for the explanation. Within the following
half hour the majority of the population of Beartown knew that
an attempt had been made to rob the post office during the night.
Then followed a hurrying thither, for no one could be satisfied
until he had viewed the scene and talked with the postmistress
herself.</p>

<p>It was the confusion and hurly-burly below stairs that awoke
Mike Murphy early. He would have left at once to join Alvin and
Chester if Nora had not forced him to eat breakfast before bidding
them good-by. It must be said that the Irish youth did not require
much urging to detain him that long.</p>

<p>He found he was attracting unpleasant attention. It was Nora
who took pains to let it be known that but for him all the money
in the safe would have been stolen. Mr. Jasper, the owner of the
large sum, scrambled through the crowd, snatched up his big envelope
and hurried off without so much as thanking Mike, who cared naught.</p>

<p>"You needn't tell me," said the keeper of the other grocery store
to the husband of the town milliner. "That redheaded Irish chap
is one of the gang."</p>

<p>"How do you account for his preventing the other robber from
carrying away the money in the safe?" asked his neighbor.</p>

<p>"Plain enough; they'd had a quarrel. He wanted it all for himself."</p>

<p>"Why didn't he take it then?"</p>

<p>"The widder and others bounced down on him afore he had the chance."</p>

<p>"I don't see why if the other villain run away this one didn't
do likewise."</p>

<p>"He'll do it quick enough, never you fear."</p>

<p>"Why is he hanging round after they've gone?"</p>

<p>"To git the money. Seems to me, Rufe, you're blamed stupid this
morning. Why, you've only to take one look at that young ruffian's
face to see the wickedness wrote there. He oughter be in prison
this very minute, and he'll soon be there&mdash;take my word for it!"</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Sneaked off while he had the chance&mdash;wal, I'll be gul darned!"</p>

<p>The grinning Mike Murphy was standing at his elbow, where he
had heard every word of the pointed conversation. The gossip was
so taken aback that he began stammering:</p>

<p>"I had&mdash;that is, I was thinking of the other robber."</p>

<p>"I was told," said Mike, "that there was a man hereabouts that
looked so much like me he must be my lost brither that was let
out of jail in Boston a fortnight since. I've found him and begs
the privilege of shaking his hand."</p>

<p>And he caught the limp fingers of the gaping fellow and squeezed
them hard, while he continued to gape and say nothing.</p>

<p>Since this unpleasant person bore not the slightest resemblance
to the youth, being pale and effeminate looking, those who stood
near broke into laughter. Mike turned about, and having bidden
good-by to mother and daughter, passed into the street and turned
down the road leading to the landing.</p>

<p>The hour was early and the fog of which I have spoken was beginning
to creep over the village and through the woods. He kept his bearings,
and when near the river plunged in among the trees to find the
<em>Deerfoot</em>, remembering where she was moored the night
before.</p>

<p>Some hours earlier Alvin Landon and Chester Haynes had boarded
the <em>Water Witch</em>, never doubting that it was the <em>Deerfoot</em>,
and started down the river. Consequently Mike could not make the
same mistake, and came straight to the launch with which he was
familiar. Standing for a brief period on the bank he looked admiringly
at it.</p>

<p>"Where are the byes?" was the first question he asked himself,
as a glance told him he had arrived ahead of them. "I wonder now
if they have strayed off in the woods, where they may wander about
like the two lost babes and be niver heerd of agin."</p>

<p>Not doubting that they would soon show up, he sat down on the
velvety ground to await them. By and by he became drowsy. The
previous night had been so broken that he had not gained half
the sleep he needed. It was natural, therefore, after his generous
breakfast, that he should be inclined to slumber. Rousing up,
he reflected:</p>

<p>"If I fall asleep here, the byes may not obsarve me and sail
away and leave me behind. I shouldn't mind that so much wid only
a quarter of a dollar in me pocket, fur I could go back to Nora
and her mother and spind the rest of me days. But the Captain
and second mate would graive themselves to death, and that would
make me feel bad."</p>

<p>Throwing off his drowsiness, he rose to his feet, reached out
one hand and sprang lightly aboard the boat. Seats, cushions,
flags, everything was as they had left it the night before. He
sat down on one seat, rested his feet upon another and settled
himself for a good nap, indifferent as to how long it should last.</p>

<p>"When they come they will obsarve that I'm sweetly draaming,
and will respict me enough to refrain from disturbing me, as Bobbie
Burns used to say whin he lay down beside the road late at night
on his way home."</p>

<p>His posture was so comfortable that his head soon bowed and he
drifted into the land of dreams. His first essay was not so successful
as he hoped it would be, for by and by the nodding head tipped
too far forward, and he sprawled on his face. His first confused
fancy was that he had been lying in his trundle bed at Tipperary
with his cousin Garry Murphy.</p>

<p>"Arrah, now, what do ye maan by kicking me out on the floor,
ye spalpeen? Whin I git me eyes open I'll taich ye better manners,"
he called, climbing carefully to his feet. After a brief spell
he recalled the situation. His first fear was that the Captain
and second mate had returned and witnessed his tumble, but looking
around, he saw nothing of them. The mooring line lay looped around
the base of the spruce and the launch was motionless.</p>

<p>Soon after, two persons came stealing their way among the trees,
feeling each step like a couple of Indian scouts entering a hostile
camp. They were Kit Woodford, leader of the post office burglars,
and his young companion Graff Miller. You remember they acted
as lookouts, while the third was busy inside. They had fled like
the cowards they were on the first sign of danger, had managed
to find each other and then set out to flee in their launch. What
had become of "Nox" they did not know or care. He must do as they
had done&mdash;save himself or go unsaved.</p>

<p>A shock of astonishment came to the miscreants when they reached
the place where the <em>Water Witch</em> was moored the night
before, only to discover that it had vanished. To the alarmed
ruffians there was but the one explanation: the men who had interfered
with the work at the post office had learned of the launch and
run off with it.</p>

<p>"This is a rum go!" was the disgusted exclamation of Woodford.
"I thought we should have an easy thing of it, but we've got to
turn back inland. We shouldn't have any trouble, though it looks
to me as if we shall have to part company."</p>

<p>The younger man was not favorably impressed at first, but a moment's
reflection convinced him that this was one of the situations in
which the proverb, "In union there is strength," did not hold
good. Two persons trying together to make their way out of the
neighborhood without drawing suspicion would be in more danger
than one. So he said:</p>

<p>"All right; I will go down stream."</p>

<p>He moved away from his companion, who held his place for a brief
while, still reflecting whether his plan was the better one after
all. He was turning over the problem in his mind, when he caught
the sound of a guarded whistle. It was a familiar call from his
companion and he did not hesitate to follow it. Only a little
way off he paused with an exclamation of astonishment.</p>

<p>There was the swift launch <em>Deerfoot</em> moored against the
bank so near the place where the <em>Water Witch</em> had been
left that it is no wonder that Alvin Landon and Chester Haynes
failed to notice the difference of location. Not only that, but
one of the youths belonging to the boat was seated near the stern
with head bowed as if asleep.</p>

<p>What could the amazing fact mean? Woodford's first thought was
that a trap had been set for them. More than likely the seeming
slumber on the part of the motionless figure was a pretence, and
meant to tempt them to come out into the open.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it?" whispered Graff Miller.</p>

<p>"Some deviltry you may be sure; the others are near by."</p>

<p>They stealthily withdrew deeper into the wood and watched and
listened, but nothing occurred to cause alarm. Then a sudden resolution
came to the elder.</p>

<p>"So long as there's only one, let's make him prisoner."</p>

<p>"I'm willing," assented the other.</p>

<p>As silently as two shadows, they stole to the edge of the water.
Woodford deftly cast off the bow line and, leaning over, gently
laid it on the deck. Then they stepped aboard and Miller took
up the boathook, pressed it against the bank and the launch began
moving away. When the boathook could be used no longer, it was
softly laid down and the younger man took his place at the wheel.
He understood the running of the launch better than his companions
and generally acted as pilot.</p>

<p>"Shall I start?" he asked, in a guarded voice.</p>

<p>The other nodded. Miller slipped the switch plug in place, started
the motor and put on the power, with just enough force to set
the screw slowly revolving. He headed out in the river, where,
because of the fog, he could barely see the flagstaff at the bow,
and began a wide sweeping circle with the intention of descending
the stream.</p>

<p>And still Mike Murphy dreamed on.</p>

<p>Now that the boat was under way with the screw revolving faster,
Kit Woodford stepped closer to the sleeping youth and looked at
his face. When he recognized him as the belligerent Irish lad,
his feelings underwent a sudden change. He knew something of the
sleeper and decided on the instant that he was <em>persona non
grata</em>. While one of the other boys might have been held with
some vague idea of being used as a hostage, this one would make
more trouble aboard than on land.</p>

<p>Without a word as to his purpose to his companion, Kit Woodford
stooped over, and with the great strength he possessed, easily
lifted the sleeping boy clear of the deck. Then he cautiously
moved to the taffrail, and with a single toss flung Mike Murphy
clear of the launch. And the water was fifty feet deep, and Mike
had never swum a stroke, and there was no one to go to his help.</p>
