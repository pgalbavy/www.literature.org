<p>There was great rejoicing in the little village in the pond when
Brownie Beaver returned with the good news that there would be no more
hunting and fishing. And when old Grandaddy Beaver said that everybody
ought to take a holiday to celebrate the occasion, all the villagers
said it was a fine idea.
</p>
<p>So they stopped working, for once, and began to plan the celebration.
They thought that there ought to be swimming races and tree-felling
contests. And Brownie Beaver said that after the holiday was over he
would suggest that someone be chosen to go down and thank Farmer Green
for putting the notice on the tree.
</p><p>The whole village agreed to Brownie's proposal and they voted to see
who should be sent. Brownie Beaver himself passed his hat around to
take up the votes. And it was quickly found that every vote was for
Brownie Beaver. He had even voted for himself. But no one seemed to
care about that.
</p><p>Then the swimming races began. There was a race under water, a race
with heads out of water--and another in which each person who took
part had to stay beneath the surface as long as he could.
</p><p>That last race caused some trouble. A young scamp called Slippery Sam
won it. And many people thought that he had swum up inside his house,
where he could get air, without being seen. But no one could prove it;
so he won the race, just the same.
</p><p>Next came the tree-felling contest. There were six, including Brownie
Beaver, that took part in it. Grandaddy Beaver had picked out six
trees of exactly the same size. Each person in the contest had to try
to bring his tree to the ground first. And that caused some trouble,
too, because some claimed that their trees were of harder wood than
others--and more difficult to gnaw--while others complained that the
bark of their trees tasted very bitter, and of course that made their
task unpleasant.
</p><p>Those six trees, falling one after another, made such a racket that
old Mr. Crow heard the noise miles away and flew over to see what was
happening.
</p><p>After everybody crept out of his hiding-place some time afterward
(everyone had to hide for a while, you know), there was Mr. Crow
sitting upon one of the fallen trees.
</p><p>"What's going on?" he inquired. "You're not going to cut down the
whole forest, I hope."
</p><p>Then they told him about the celebration. And Mr. Crow began to laugh.
</p><p>"What are you going to do next?" he asked.
</p><p>"We're a-going to send Brownie Beaver over to Pleasant Valley to thank
Farmer Green for his kindness in putting an end to hunting and
fishing," said old Grandaddy Beaver. "And he's a-going to start right
away."
</p><p>Mr. Crow looked around. And there was Brownie Beaver, with a
lunch-basket in his hand, all ready to begin his long journey.
</p><p>"Say good-by to him then," said Mr. Crow, "for you'll never see him
again."
</p><p>"What do you mean?" Grandaddy Beaver asked. And as for Brownie--he was
so frightened that he dropped his basket right in the water.
</p><p>"I mean----" said Mr. Crow--"I mean that it's a very dangerous errand.
You don't seem to have understood that sign. In the first place, it
was not Farmer Green, but his son Johnnie, who nailed It to the tree."
</p><p>"Ah!" Brownie Beaver cried. "<u>That</u> is why one of the words was
misspelled!"
</p><p>"No doubt!" Mr. Crow remarked. As a matter of fact, not being able to
read he hadn't known about the word that was spelled wrong. "In the
second place," he continued, "the sign doesn't mean that hunting and
fishing are to be stopped. It means that no one but Johnnie Green is
going to hunt and fish in this neighborhood. He wants all the hunting
and fishing for himself. That's why he put up that sign. And instead
of hunting and fishing being stopped, I should say that they were
going to begin to be more dangerous than ever.... They tell me," he
added, "that Johnnie Green had a new gun on this birthday."
</p><p>Brownie Beaver said at once that he was not going on the errand of
thanks.
</p><p>"I resign," he said, "and anyone that wants to go in my place is
welcome to do so."
</p><p>But nobody cared to go. And the whole village seemed greatly
disappointed, until Grandaddy Beaver made a short speech.
</p><p>"We've all had a good holiday, anyhow," he said. "And I should say
that was something to be thankful for."
