<p>He shook hands with me: "Well, there you are, on your own, appointed
officially under my responsibility."</p>

<p>He was actually walking with me to the door. What a distance
off it seemed! I moved like a man in bonds. But we reached it
at last. I opened it with the sensation of dealing with mere dream-stuff,
and then at the last moment the fellowship of seamen asserted
itself, stronger than the difference of age and station. It asserted
itself in Captain Ellis’ voice.</p>

<p>"Good-bye&mdash;and good luck to you," he said so heartily that I
could only give him a grateful glance. Then I turned and went
out, never to see him again in my life. I had not made three steps
into the outer office when I heard behind my back a gruff, loud,
authoritative voice, the voice of our deputy-Neptune.</p>

<p>It was addressing the head Shipping-Master who, having let me
in, had, apparently, remained hovering in the middle distance
ever since. "Mr. R., let the harbour launch have steam up to take
the captain here on board the Melita at half-past nine to-night."</p>

<p>I was amazed at the startled alacrity of R’s "Yes, sir." He ran
before me out on the landing. My new dignity sat yet so lightly
on me that I was not aware that it was I, the Captain, the object
of this last graciousness. It seemed as if all of a sudden a pair
of wings had grown on my shoulders. I merely skimmed along the
polished floor.</p>

<p>But R. was impressed.</p>

<p>"I say!" he exclaimed on the landing, while the Malay crew of
the steam-launch standing by looked stonily at the man for whom
they were going to be kept on duty so late, away from their gambling,
from their girls, or their pure domestic joys. "I say! His own
launch. What have you done to him?"</p>

<p>His stare was full of respectful curiosity. I was quite confounded.</p>

<p>"Was it for me? I hadn’t the slightest notion," I stammered out.</p>

<p>He nodded many times. "Yes. And the last person who had it before
you was a Duke. So, there!"</p>

<p>I think he expected me to faint on the spot. But I was in too
much of a hurry for emotional displays. My feelings were already
in such a whirl that this staggering information did not seem
to make the slightest difference. It merely fell into the seething
cauldron of my brain, and I carried it off with me after a short
but effusive passage of leave-taking with R.</p>

<p>The favour of the great throws an aureole round the fortunate
object of its selection. That excellent man enquired whether he
could do anything for me. He had known me only by sight, and he
was well aware he would never see me again; I was, in common with
the other seamen of the port, merely a subject for official writing,
filling up of forms with all the artificial superiority of a man
of pen and ink to the men who grapple with realities outside the
consecrated walls of official buildings. What ghosts we must have
been to him! Mere symbols to juggle with in books and heavy registers,
without brains and muscles and perplexities; something hardly
useful and decidedly inferior.</p>

<p>And he&mdash;the office hours being over&mdash;wanted to know if he could
be of any use to me!</p>

<p>I ought&mdash;properly speaking &mdash;I ought to have been moved
to tears. But I did not even think of it. It was merely another
miraculous manifestation of that day of miracles. I parted from
him as if he were a mere symbol. I floated down the staircase.
I floated out of the official and imposing portal. I went on floating
along.</p>

<p>I use that word rather than the word "flew," because I have a
distinct impression that, though uplifted by my aroused youth,
my movements were deliberate enough. To that mixed white, brown,
and yellow portion of mankind, out abroad on their own affairs,
I presented the appearance of a man walking rather sedately. And
nothing in the way of abstraction could have equalled my deep
detachment from the forms and colours of this world. It was, as
it were, final.</p>

<p>And yet, suddenly, I recognized Hamilton. I recognized him without
effort, without a shock, without a start. There he was, strolling
toward the Harbour Office with his stiff, arrogant dignity. His
red face made him noticeable at a distance. It flamed, over there,
on the shady side of the street.</p>

<p>He had perceived me, too. Something (unconscious exuberance of
spirits perhaps) moved me to wave my hand to him elaborately.
This lapse from good taste happened before I was aware that I
was capable of it.</p>

<p>The impact of my impudence stopped him short, much as a bullet
might have done. I verily believe he staggered, though as far
as I could see he didn’t actually fall. I had gone past in a moment
and did not turn my head. I had forgotten his existence.</p>

<p>The next ten minutes might have been ten seconds or ten centuries
for all my consciousness had to do with it. People might have
been falling dead around me, houses crumbling, guns firing, I
wouldn’t have known. I was thinking: "By Jove! I have got it."
<em>It</em> being the command. It had come about in a way utterly
unforeseen in my modest day-dreams.</p>

<p>I perceived that my imagination had been running in conventional
channels and that my hopes had always been drab stuff. I had envisaged
a command as a result of a slow course of promotion in the employ
of some highly respectable firm. The reward of faithful service.
Well, faithful service was all right. One would naturally give
that for one’s own sake, for the sake of the ship, for the love
of the life of one’s choice; not for the sake of the reward.</p>

<p>There is something distasteful in the notion of a reward.</p>

<p>And now here I had my command, absolutely in my pocket, in a
way undeniable indeed, but most unexpected; beyond my imaginings,
outside all reasonable expectations, and even notwithstanding
the existence of some sort of obscure intrigue to keep it away
from me. It is true that the intrigue was feeble, but it helped
the feeling of wonder&mdash;as if I had been specially destined for
that ship I did not know, by some power higher than the prosaic
agencies of the commercial world.</p>

<p>A strange sense of exultation began to creep into me. If I had
worked for that command ten years or more there would have been
nothing of the kind. I was a little frightened.</p>

<p>"Let us be calm," I said to myself.</p>

<p>Outside the door of the Officers’ Home the wretched Steward seemed
to be waiting for me. There was a broad flight of a few steps,
and he ran to and fro on the top of it as if chained there. A
distressed cur. He looked as though his throat were too dry for
him to bark.</p>

<p>I regret to say I stopped before going in. There had been a revolution
in my moral nature. He waited open-mouthed, breathless, while
I looked at him for half a minute.</p>

<p>"And you thought you could keep me out of it," I said scathingly.</p>

<p>"You said you were going home," he squeaked miserably. "You said
so. You said so."</p>

<p>"I wonder what Captain Ellis will have to say to that excuse,"
I uttered slowly with a sinister meaning.</p>

<p>His lower jaw had been trembling all the time and his voice was
like the bleating of a sick goat. "You have given me away? You
have done for me?"</p>

<p>Neither his distress nor yet the sheer absurdity of it was able
to disarm me. It was the first instance of harm being attempted
to be done to me&mdash;at any rate, the first I had ever found out.
And I was still young enough, still too much on this side of the
shadow line, not to be surprised and indignant at such things.</p>

<p>I gazed at him inflexibly. Let the beggar suffer. He slapped
his forehead and I passed in, pursued, into the dining room, by
his screech: "I always said you’d be the death of me."</p>

<p>This clamour not only overtook me, but went ahead as it were
on to the verandah and brought out Captain Giles.</p>

<p>He stood before me in the doorway in all the commonplace solidity
of his wisdom. The gold chain glittered on his breast. He clutched
a smouldering pipe.</p>

<p>I extended my hand to him warmly and he seemed surprised, but
did respond heartily enough in the end, with a faint smile of
superior knowledge which cut my thanks short as if with a knife.
I don’t think that more than one word came out. And even for that
one, judging by the temperature of my face, I had blushed as if
for a bad action. Assuming a detached tone, I wondered how on
earth he had managed to spot the little underhand game that had
been going on.</p>

<p>He murmured complacently that there were but few things done
in the town that he could not see the inside of. And as to this
house, he had been using it off and on for nearly ten years. Nothing
that went on in it could escape his great experience. It had been
no trouble to him. No trouble at all.</p>

<p>Then in his quiet, thick tone he wanted to know if I had complained
formally of the Steward’s action.</p>

<p>I said that I hadn’t&mdash;though, indeed, it was not for want of
opportunity. Captain Ellis had gone for me bald-headed in a most
ridiculous fashion for being out of the way when wanted.</p>

<p>"Funny old gentleman," interjected Captain Giles. "What did you
say to that?"</p>

<p>"I said simply that I came along the very moment I heard of his
message. Nothing more. I didn’t want to hurt the Steward. I would
scorn to harm such an object. No. I made no complaint, but I believe
he thinks I’ve done so. Let him think. He’s got a fright he won’t
forget in a hurry, for Captain Ellis would kick him out into the
middle of Asia. . . ."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," said Captain Giles, leaving me suddenly. I sat
down feeling very tired, mostly in my head. Before I could start
a train of thought he stood again before me, murmuring the excuse
that he had to go and put the fellow’s mind at ease.</p>

<p>I looked up with surprise. But in reality I was indifferent.
He explained that he had found the Steward lying face downward
on the horsehair sofa. He was all right now.</p>

<p>"He would not have died of fright," I said contemptuously.</p>

<p>"No. But he might have taken an overdose out of one of them little
bottles he keeps in his room," Captain Giles argued seriously.
"The confounded fool has tried to poison himself once&mdash;a few years
ago."</p>

<p>"Really," I said without emotion. "He doesn’t seem very fit to
live, anyhow."</p>

<p>"As to that, it may be said of a good many."</p>

<p>"Don’t exaggerate like this!" I protested, laughing irritably.
"But I wonder what this part of the world would do if you were
to leave off looking after it, Captain Giles? Here you have got
me a command and saved the Steward’s life in one afternoon. Though
why you should have taken all that interest in either of us is
more than I can understand."</p>

<p>Captain Giles remained silent for a minute. Then gravely:</p>

<p>"He’s not a bad steward really. He can find a good cook, at any
rate. And, what’s more, he can keep him when found. I remember
the cooks we had here before his time! . . ."</p>

<p>I must have made a movement of impatience, because he interrupted
himself with an apology for keeping me yarning there, while no
doubt I needed all my time to get ready.</p>

<p>What I really needed was to be alone for a bit. I seized this
opening hastily. My bedroom was a quiet refuge in an apparently
uninhabited wing of the building. Having absolutely nothing to
do (for I had not unpacked my things), I sat down on the bed and
abandoned myself to the influences of the hour. To the unexpected
influences. . . .</p>

<p>And first I wondered at my state of mind. Why was I not more
surprised? Why? Here I was, invested with a command in the twinkling
of an eye, not in the common course of human affairs, but more
as if by enchantment. I ought to have been lost in astonishment.
But I wasn’t. I was very much like people in fairy tales. Nothing
ever astonishes them. When a fully appointed gala coach is produced
out of a pumpkin to take her to a ball, Cinderella does not exclaim.
She gets in quietly and drives away to her high fortune.</p>

<p>Captain Ellis (a fierce sort of fairy) had produced a command
out of a drawer almost as unexpectedly as in a fairy tale. But
a command is an abstract idea, and it seemed a sort of "lesser
marvel" till it flashed upon me that it involved the concrete
existence of a ship.</p>

<p>A ship! My ship! She was mine, more absolutely mine for possession
and care than anything in the world; an object of responsibility
and devotion. She was there waiting for me, spell-bound, unable
to move, to live, to get out into the world (till I came), like
an enchanted princess. Her call had come to me as if from the
clouds. I had never suspected her existence. I didn’t know how
she looked, I had barely heard her name, and yet we were indissolubly
united for a certain portion of our future, to sink or swim together!</p>

<p>A sudden passion of anxious impatience rushed through my veins,
gave me such a sense of the intensity of existence as I have never
felt before or since. I discovered how much of a seaman I was,
in heart, in mind, and, as it were, physically&mdash;a man exclusively
of sea and ships; the sea the only world that counted, and the
ships, the test of manliness, of temperament, of courage and fidelity&mdash;and
of love.</p>

<p>I had an exquisite moment. It was unique also. Jumping up from
my seat, I paced up and down my room for a long time. But when
I came downstairs I behaved with sufficient composure. Only I
couldn’t eat anything at dinner.</p>

<p>Having declared my intention not to drive but to walk down to
the quay, I must render the wretched Steward justice that he bestirred
himself to find me some coolies for the luggage. They departed,
carrying all my worldly possessions (except a little money I had
in my pocket) slung from a long pole. Captain Giles volunteered
to walk down with me.</p>

<p>We followed the sombre, shaded alley across the Esplanade. It
was moderately cool there under the trees. Captain Giles remarked,
with a sudden laugh: "I know who’s jolly thankful at having seen
the last of you."</p>

<p>I guessed that he meant the Steward. The fellow had borne himself
to me in a sulkily frightened manner at the last. I expressed
my wonder that he should have tried to do me a bad turn for no
reason at all.</p>

<p>"Don’t you see that what he wanted was to get rid of our friend
Hamilton by dodging him in front of you for that job? That would
have removed him for good. See?"</p>

<p>"Heavens!" I exclaimed, feeling humiliated somehow. "Can it be
possible? What a fool he must be! That overbearing, impudent loafer!
Why! He couldn’t. . . . And yet he’s nearly done it, I believe;
for the Harbour Office was bound to send somebody."</p>

<p>"Aye. A fool like our Steward can be dangerous sometimes," declared
Captain Giles sententiously. "Just because he is a fool," he added,
imparting further instruction in his complacent low tones. "For,"
he continued in the manner of a set demonstration, "no sensible
person would risk being kicked out of the only berth between himself
and starvation just to get rid of a simple annoyance&mdash;a small
worry. Would he now?"</p>

<p>"Well, no," I conceded, restraining a desire to laugh at that
something mysteriously earnest in delivering the conclusions of
his wisdom as though it were the product of prohibited operations.
"But that fellow looks as if he were rather crazy. He must be."</p>

<p>"As to that, I believe everybody in the world is a little mad,"
he announced quietly.</p>

<p>"You make no exceptions?" I inquired, just to hear his manner.</p>

<p>"Why! Kent says that even of you."</p>

<p>"Does he?" I retorted, extremely embittered all at once against
my former captain. "There’s nothing of that in the written character
from him which I’ve got in my pocket. Has he given you any instances
of my lunacy?"</p>

<p>Captain Giles explained in a conciliating tone that it had been
only a friendly remark in reference to my abrupt leaving the ship
for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>I muttered grumpily: "Oh! leaving his ship," and mended my pace.
He kept up by my side in the deep gloom of the avenue as if it
were his conscientious duty to see me out of the colony as an
undesirable character. He panted a little, which was rather pathetic
in a way. But I was not moved. On the contrary. His discomfort
gave me a sort of malicious pleasure.</p>

<p>Presently I relented, slowed down, and said:</p>

<p>"What I really wanted was to get a fresh grip. I felt it was
time. Is that so very mad?"</p>

<p>He made no answer. We were issuing from the avenue. On the bridge
over the canal a dark, irresolute figure seemed to be awaiting
something or somebody.</p>

<p>It was a Malay policeman, barefooted, in his blue uniform. The
silver band on his little round cap shone dimly in the light of
the street lamp. He peered in our direction timidly.</p>

<p>Before we could come up to him he turned about and walked in
front of us in the direction of the jetty. The distance was some
hundred yards; and then I found my coolies squatting on their
heels. They had kept the pole on their shoulders, and all my worldly
goods, still tied to the pole, were resting on the ground between
them. As far as the eye could reach along the quay there was not
another soul abroad except the police peon, who saluted us.</p>

<p>It seems he had detained the coolies as suspicious characters,
and had forbidden them the jetty. But at a sign from me he took
off the embargo with alacrity. The two patient fellows, rising
together with a faint grunt, trotted off along the planks, and
I prepared to take my leave of Captain Giles, who stood there
with an air as though his mission were drawing to a close. It
could not be denied that he had done it all. And while I hesitated
about an appropriate sentence he made himself heard:</p>

<p>"I expect you’ll have your hands pretty full of tangled-up business."</p>

<p>I asked him what made him think so; and he answered that it was
his general experience of the world. Ship a long time away from
her port, owners inaccessible by cable, and the only man who could
explain matters dead and buried.</p>

<p>"And you yourself new to the business in a way," he concluded
in a sort of unanswerable tone.</p>

<p>"Don’t insist," I said. "I know it only too well. I only wish
you could impart to me some small portion of your experience before
I go. As it can’t be done in ten minutes I had better not begin
to ask you. There’s that harbour launch waiting for me, too. But
I won’t feel really at peace till I have that ship of mine out
in the Indian Ocean."</p>

<p>He remarked casually that from Bangkok to the Indian Ocean was
a pretty long step. And this murmur, like a dim flash from a dark
lantern, showed me for a moment the broad belt of islands and
reefs between that unknown ship, which was mine, and the freedom
of the great waters of the globe.</p>

<p>But I felt no apprehension. I was familiar enough with the Archipelago
by that time. Extreme patience and extreme care would see me through
the region of broken land, of faint airs, and of dead water to
where I would feel at last my command swing on the great swell
and list over to the great breath of regular winds, that would
give her the feeling of a large, more intense life. The road would
be long. All roads are long that lead toward one’s heart’s desire.
But this road my mind’s eye could see on a chart, professionally,
with all its complications and difficulties, yet simple enough
in a way. One is a seaman or one is not. And I had no doubt of
being one.</p>

<p>The only part I was a stranger to was the Gulf of Siam. And I
mentioned this to Captain Giles. Not that I was concerned very
much. It belonged to the same region the nature of which I knew,
into whose very soul I seemed to have looked during the last months
of that existence with which I had broken now, suddenly, as one
parts with some enchanting company.</p>

<p>"The gulf . . . Ay! A funny piece of water&mdash;that," said Captain
Giles.</p>

<p>Funny, in this connection, was a vague word. The whole thing
sounded like an opinion uttered by a cautious person mindful of
actions for slander.</p>

<p>I didn’t inquire as to the nature of that funniness. There was
really no time. But at the very last he volunteered a warning.</p>

<p>"Whatever you do keep to the east side of it. The west side is
dangerous at this time of the year. Don’t let anything tempt you
over. You’ll find nothing but trouble there."</p>

<p>Though I could hardly imagine what could tempt me to involve
my ship amongst the currents and reefs of the Malay shore, I thanked
him for the advice.</p>

<p>He gripped my extended arm warmly, and the end of our acquaintance
came suddenly in the words: "Good-night."</p>

<p>That was all he said: "Good-night." Nothing more. I don’t know
what I intended to say, but surprise made me swallow it, whatever
it was. I choked slightly, and then exclaimed with a sort of nervous
haste: "Oh! Good-night, Captain Giles, good-night."</p>

<p>His movements were always deliberate, but his back had receded
some distance along the deserted quay before I collected myself
enough to follow his example and made a half turn in the direction
of the jetty.</p>

<p>Only my movements were not deliberate. I hurried down to the
steps, and leaped into the launch. Before I had fairly landed
in her sternsheets the slim little craft darted away from the
jetty with a sudden swirl of her propeller and the hard, rapid
puffing of the exhaust in her vaguely gleaming brass funnel amidships.</p>

<p>The misty churning at her stern was the only sound in the world.
The shore lay plunged in the silence of the deeper slumber. I
watched the town recede still and soundless in the hot night,
till the abrupt hail, "Steam-launch, ahoy!" made me spin round
face forward. We were close to a white ghostly steamer. Lights
shone on her decks, in her portholes. And the same voice shouted
from her:</p>

<p>"Is that our passenger?"</p>

<p>"It is," I yelled.</p>

<p>Her crew had been obviously on the jump. I could hear them running
about. The modern spirit of haste was loudly vocal in the orders
to "Heave away on the cable"&mdash;to "Lower the sideladder," and in
urgent requests to me to "Come along, sir! We have been delayed
three hours for you. . . . Our time is seven o’clock, you know!"</p>

<p>I stepped on the deck. I said "No! I don’t know." The spirit
of modern hurry was embodied in a thin, long-armed, long-legged
man, with a closely clipped gray beard. His meagre hand was hot
and dry. He declared feverishly:</p>

<p>"I am hanged if I would have waited another five minutes Harbour-Master
or no Harbour-Master."</p>

<p>"That’s your own business," I said. "I didn’t ask you to wait
for me."</p>

<p>"I hope you don’t expect any supper," he burst out. "This isn’t
a boarding-house afloat. You are the first passenger I ever had
in my life and I hope to goodness you will be the last."</p>

<p>I made no answer to this hospitable communication; and, indeed,
he didn’t wait for any, bolting away on to his bridge to get his
ship under way.</p>

<p>The three days he had me on board he did not depart from that
half-hostile attitude. His ship having been delayed three hours
on my account he couldn’t forgive me for not being a more distinguished
person. He was not exactly outspoken about it, but that feeling
of annoyed wonder was peeping out perpetually in his talk.</p>

<p>He was absurd.</p>

<p>He was also a man of much experience, which he liked to trot
out; but no greater contrast with Captain Giles could have been
imagined. He would have amused me if I had wanted to be amused.
But I did not want to be amused. I was like a lover looking forward
to a meeting. Human hostility was nothing to me. I thought of
my unknown ship. It was amusement enough, torment enough, occupation
enough.</p>

<p>He perceived my state, for his wits were sufficiently sharp for
that, and he poked sly fun at my preoccupation in the manner some
nasty, cynical old men assume toward the dreams and illusions
of youth. I, on my side, refrained from questioning him as to
the appearance of my ship, though I knew that being in Bangkok
every fortnight or so he must have known her by sight. I was not
going to expose the ship, my ship! to some slighting reference.</p>

<p>He was the first really unsympathetic man I had ever come in
contact with. My education was far from being finished, though
I didn’t know it. No! I didn’t know it.</p>

<p>All I knew was that he disliked me and had some contempt for
my person. Why? Apparently because his ship had been delayed three
hours on my account. Who was I to have such a thing done for me?
Such a thing had never been done for him. It was a sort of jealous
indignation.</p>

<p>My expectation, mingled with fear, was wrought to its highest
pitch. How slow had been the days of the passage and how soon
they were over. One morning, early, we crossed the bar, and while
the sun was rising splendidly over the flat spaces of the land
we steamed up the innumerable bends, passed under the shadow of
the great gilt pagoda, and reached the outskirts of the town.</p>

<p>There it was, spread largely on both banks, the Oriental capital
which had as yet suffered no white conqueror; an expanse of brown
houses of bamboo, of mats, of leaves, of a vegetable-matter style
of architecture, sprung out of the brown soil on the banks of
the muddy river. It was amazing to think that in those miles of
human habitations there was not probably half a dozen pounds of
nails. Some of those houses of sticks and grass, like the nests
of an aquatic race, clung to the low shores. Others seemed to
grow out of the water; others again floated in long anchored rows
in the very middle of the stream. Here and there in the distance,
above the crowded mob of low, brown roof ridges, towered great
piles of masonry, King’s Palace, temples, gorgeous and dilapidated,
crumbling under the vertical sunlight, tremendous, overpowering,
almost palpable, which seemed to enter one’s breast with the breath
of one’s nostrils and soak into one’s limbs through every pore
of one’s skin.</p>

<p>The ridiculous victim of jealousy had for some reason or other
to stop his engines just then. The steamer drifted slowly up with
the tide. Oblivious of my new surroundings I walked the deck,
in anxious, deadened abstraction, a commingling of romantic reverie
with a very practical survey of my qualifications. For the time
was approaching for me to behold my command and to prove my worth
in the ultimate test of my profession.</p>

<p>Suddenly I heard myself called by that imbecile. He was beckoning
me to come up on his bridge.</p>

<p>I didn’t care very much for that, but as it seemed that he had
something particular to say I went up the ladder.</p>

<p>He laid his hand on my shoulder and gave me a slight turn, pointing
with his other arm at the same time.</p>

<p>"There! That’s your ship, Captain," he said.</p>

<p>I felt a thump in my breast&mdash;only one, as if my heart had then
ceased to beat. There were ten or more ships moored along the
bank, and the one he meant was partly hidden away from my sight
by her next astern. He said: "We’ll drift abreast her in a moment."</p>

<p>What was his tone? Mocking? Threatening? Or only indifferent?
I could not tell. I suspected some malice in this unexpected manifestation
of interest.</p>

<p>He left me, and I leaned over the rail of the bridge looking
over the side. I dared not raise my eyes. Yet it had to be done&mdash;and,
indeed, I could not have helped myself. I believe I trembled.</p>

<p>But directly my eyes had rested on my ship all my fear vanished.
It went off swiftly, like a bad dream. Only that a dream leaves
no shame behind it, and that I felt a momentary shame at my unworthy
suspicions.</p>

<p>Yes, there she was. Her hull, her rigging filled my eye with
a great content. That feeling of life-emptiness which had made
me so restless for the last few months lost its bitter plausibility,
its evil influence, dissolved in a flow of joyous emotion.</p>

<p>At first glance I saw that she was a high-class vessel, a harmonious
creature in the lines of her fine body, in the proportioned tallness
of her spars. Whatever her age and her history, she had preserved
the stamp of her origin. She was one of those craft that, in virtue
of their design and complete finish, will never look old. Amongst
her companions moored to the bank, and all bigger than herself,
she looked like a creature of high breed&mdash;an Arab steed in a string
of cart-horses.</p>

<p>A voice behind me said in a nasty equivocal tone: "I hope you
are satisfied with her, Captain." I did not even turn my head.
It was the master of the steamer, and whatever he meant, whatever
he thought of her, I knew that, like some rare women, she was
one of those creatures whose mere existence is enough to awaken
an unselfish delight. One feels that it is good to be in the world
in which she has her being.</p>

<p>That illusion of life and character which charms one in men’s
finest handiwork radiated from her. An enormous bulk of teak-wood
timber swung over her hatchway; lifeless matter, looking heavier
and bigger than anything aboard of her. When they started lowering
it the surge of the tackle sent a quiver through her from water-line
to the trucks up the fine nerves of her rigging, as though she
had shuddered at the weight. It seemed cruel to load her so. .
. .</p>

<p>Half an hour later, putting my foot on her deck for the first
time, I received the feeling of deep physical satisfaction. Nothing
could equal the fullness of that moment, the ideal completeness
of that emotional experience which had come to me without the
preliminary toil and disenchantments of an obscure career.</p>

<p>My rapid glance ran over her, enveloped, appropriated the form
concreting the abstract sentiment of my command. A lot of details
perceptible to a seaman struck my eye, vividly in that instant.
For the rest, I saw her disengaged from the material conditions
of her being. The shore to which she was moored was as if it did
not exist. What were to me all the countries of the globe? In
all the parts of the world washed by navigable waters our relation
to each other would be the same&mdash;and more intimate than there
are words to express in the language. Apart from that, every scene
and episode would be a mere passing show. The very gang of yellow
coolies busy about the main hatch was less substantial than the
stuff dreams are made of. For who on earth would dream of Chinamen?

<p>I went aft, ascended the poop, where, under the awning, gleamed
the brasses of the yacht-like fittings, the polished surfaces
of the rails, the glass of the skylights. Right aft two seamen,
busy cleaning the steering gear, with the reflected ripples of
light running playfully up their bent backs, went on with their
work, unaware of me and of the almost affectionate glance I threw
at them in passing toward the companion-way of the cabin.</p>

<p>The doors stood wide open, the slide was pushed right back. The
half-turn of the staircase cut off the view of the lobby. A low
humming ascended from below, but it stopped abruptly at the sound
of my descending footsteps.</p>
