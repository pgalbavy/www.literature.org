<p>The military historian must often make shift to write of battles
with slender data, but he can pad out his deficiencies by learned
parallels. If his were the talented pen describing this, the latest
action fought on British soil against a foreign foe, he would
no doubt be crippled by the absence of written orders and war
diaries. But how eloquently he would discant on the resemblance
between Dougal and Gouraud&mdash;how the plan of leaving the enemy
to waste his strength upon a deserted position was that which
on the 15th of July, 1918, the French general had used with decisive
effect in Champagne! But Dougal had never heard of Gouraud, and
I cannot claim that, like the Happy Warrior, he</p>

"through the heat of conflict kept the law<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In calmness made, and saw what he foresaw."

<p>I have had the benefit of discussing the affair with him and
his colleagues, but I should offend against historic truth if
I represented the main action as anything but a scrimmage&mdash;a "soldiers'
battle," the historian would say, a Malplaquet, an Albuera.</p>

<p>Just after half-past three that afternoon the Commander-in-Chief
was revealed in a very bad temper. He had intercepted Sir Archie's
car, and, since LÃ©on was known to be fully occupied, had brought
it in by the West Lodge, and hidden it behind a clump of laurels.
There he had held a hoarse council of war. He had cast an appraising
eye over Sime the butler, Carfrae the chauffeur, and McGuffog
the gamekeeper, and his brows had lightened when he beheld Sir
Archie with an armful of guns and two big cartridge-magazines.
But they had darkened again at the first words of the leader of
the reinforcements.</p>

<p>"Now for the Tower," Sir Archie had observed cheerfully. "We
should be a match for the three watchers, my lad, and it's time
that poor devil What's-his-name was relieved."</p>

<p>"A bonny-like plan that would be," said Dougal. "Man, ye would
be walkin' into the very trap they want. In an hour, or maybe
two, the rest will turn up from the sea and they'd have ye tight
by the neck. Na, na! It's time we're wantin', and the longer they
think we're a' in the auld Tower the better for us. What news
o' the polis?"</p>

<p>He listened to Sir Archie's report with a gloomy face.</p>

<p>"Not afore the darkenin'? They'll be ower late&mdash;the polis are
aye ower late. It looks as if we had the job to do oursels. What's
<em>your</em> notion?"</p>

<p>"God knows," said the baronet whose eyes were on Saskia. "What's
yours?"</p>

<p>The deference conciliated Dougal. "There's just the one plan
that's worth a docken. There's five o' us here, and there's plenty
weapons. Besides there's five Die-Hards somewhere about, and though
they've never tried it afore they can be trusted to loose off
a gun. My advice is to hide at the Garplefoot and stop the boats
landin'. We'd have the tinklers on our flank, no doubt, but I'm
not muckle feared o' them. It wouldn't be easy for the boats to
get in wi' this tearin' wind and us firin' volleys from the shore."</p>

<p>Sir Archie stared at him with admiration. "You're a hearty young
fire-eater. But Great Scott! we can't go pottin' at strangers
before we find out their business. This is a law-abidin' country,
and we're not entitled to start shootin' except in self-defence.
You can wash that plan out, for it ain't feasible."</p>

<p>Dougal spat cynically. "For all that it's the right strawtegy.
Man, we might sink the lot, and then turn and settle wi' Dobson,
and all afore the first polisman showed his neb. It would be a
grand performance. But I was feared ye wouldn't be for it....
Well, there's just the one other thing to do. We must get inside
the Hoose and put it in a state of defence. Heritage has McCunn's
pistol, and he'll keep them busy for a bit. When they've finished
wi' him and find the place is empty, they'll try the Hoose and
we'll give them a warm reception. That should keep us goin' till
the polis arrive, unless they're comin' wi' the blind carrier."</p>

<p>Sir Archie nodded. "But why put ourselves in their power at all?
They're at present barking up the wrong tree. Let them bark up
another wrong 'un. Why shouldn't the House remain empty? I take
it we're here to protect the Princess. Well, we'll have done that
if they go off empty-handed."</p>

<p>Dougal looked up to the heavens. "I wish McCunn was here," he
sighed. "Ay, we've got to protect the Princess, and there's just
the one way to do it, and that's to put an end to this crowd o'
blagyirds. If they gang empty-handed, they'll come again another
day, either here or somewhere else, and it won't be long afore
they get the lassie. But if we finish with them now she can sit
down wi' an easy mind. That's why we've got to hang on to them
till the polis comes. There's no way out o' this business but
a battle."</p>

<p>He found an ally. "Dougal is right," said Saskia. "If I am to
have peace, by some way or other the fangs of my enemies must
be drawn for ever."</p>

<p>He swung round and addressed her formally. "Mem, I'm askin' ye
for the last time. Will ye keep out of this business? Will ye
gang back and sit doun aside Mrs. Morran's fire and have your
tea and wait till we come for ye? Ye can do no good, and ye're
puttin' yourself terrible in the enemy's power. If we're beat
and ye're no' there, they get very little satisfaction, but if
they get <em>you</em> they get what they've come seekin'. I tell
ye straight&mdash;ye're an encumbrance."</p>

<p>She laughed mischievously. "I can shoot better than you," she
said.</p>

<p>He ignored the taunt. "Will ye listen to sense and fall to the
rear?"</p>

<p>"I will not," she said.</p>

<p>"Then gang your own gait. I'm ower wise to argy-bargy wi' women.
The Hoose be it!"</p>

<p>It was a journey which sorely tried Dougal's temper. The only
way in was by the verandah, but the door at the west end had been
locked, and the ladder had disappeared. Now of his party three
were lame, one lacked an arm, and one was a girl; besides, there
were the guns and cartridges to transport. Moreover, at more than
one point before the verandah was reached the route was commanded
by a point on the ridge near the old Tower, and that had been
Spidel's position when Dougal made his last reconnaissance. It
behoved to pass these points swiftly and unobtrusively, and his
company was neither swift nor unobtrusive. McGuffog had a genius
for tripping over obstacles, and Sir Archie was for ever proffering
his aid to Saskia, who was in a position to give rather than to
receive, being far the most active of the party. Once Dougal had
to take the gamekeeper's head and force it down, a performance
which would have led to an immediate assault but for Sir Archie's
presence. Nor did the latter escape. "Will ye stop heedin' the
lassie, and attend to your own job," the Chieftain growled. "Ye're
makin' as much noise as a road-roller."</p>

<p>Arrived at the foot of the verandah wall there remained the problem
of the escalade. Dougal clambered up like a squirrel by the help
of cracks in the stones, and he could be heard trying the handle
of the door into the House. He was absent for about five minutes
and then his head peeped over the edge accompanied by the hooks
of an iron ladder. "From the boiler-house," he informed them as
they stood clear for the thing to drop. It proved to be little
more than half the height of the wall.</p>

<p>Saskia ascended first, and had no difficulty in pulling herself
over the parapet. Then came the guns and ammunition, and then
the one-armed Sime, who turned out to be an athlete. But it was
no easy matter getting up the last three. Sir Archie anathematised
his frailties. "Nice old crock to go tiger-shootin' with," he
told the Princess. "But set me to something where my confounded
leg don't get in the way, and I'm still pretty useful!" Dougal,
mopping his brow with the rag he called his handkerchief, observed
sourly that he objected to going scouting with a herd of elephants.</p>

<p>Once indoors his spirits rose. The party from the Mains had brought
several electric torches and the one lamp was presently found
and lit. "We can't count on the polis," Dougal announced, "and
when the foreigners is finished wi' the Tower they'll come on
here. If no', we must make them. What is it the sodgers call it?
Forcin' a battle? Now see here! There's the two roads into this
place, the back door and the verandy, leavin' out the front door
which is chained and lockit. They'll try those two roads first
and we must get them well barricaded in time. But mind, if there's
a good few o' them, it'll be an easy job to batter in the front
door or the windies, so we maun be ready for that."</p>

<p>He told off a fatigue party&mdash;the Princess, Sir Archie and McGuffog&mdash;to
help in moving furniture to the several doors. Sime and Carfrae
attended to the kitchen entrance, while he himself made a tour
of the ground-floor windows. For half an hour the empty house
was loud with strange sounds. McGuffog, who was a giant in strength,
filled the passage at the verandah end with an assortment of furniture
ranging from a grand piano to a vast mahogany sofa, while Saskia
and Sir Archie pillaged the bedrooms and packed up the interstices
with mattresses in lieu of sandbags. Dougal on his return saw
fit to approve their work.</p>

<p>"That'll fickle the blagyirds. Down at the kitchen door we've
got a mangle, five wash-tubs and the best part of a ton o' coal.
It's the windies I'm anxious about, for they're ower big to fill
up. But I've gotten tubs o' water below them and a lot o' wire-nettin'
I fund in the cellar."</p>

<p>Sir Archie morosely wiped his brow. "I can't say I ever hated
a job more," he told Saskia. "It seems pretty cool to march into
somebody else's house and make free with his furniture. I hope
to goodness our friends from the sea do turn up, or we'll look
pretty foolish. Loudon will have a score against me he won't forget."</p>

<p>"Ye're no' weakenin'?" asked Dougal fiercely.</p>

<p>"Not a bit. Only hopin' somebody hasn't made a mighty big mistake."</p>

<p>"Ye needn't be feared for that. Now you listen to your instructions.
We're terrible few for such a big place, but we maun make up for
shortness o' numbers by extra mobility. The gemkeeper will keep
the windy that looks on the verandy, and fell any man that gets
through. You'll hold the verandy door, and the ither lame man&mdash;is't
Carfrae ye call him?&mdash;will keep the back door. I've telled the
one-armed man, who has some kind of a head on him, that he maun
keep on the move, watchin' to see if they try the front door or
any o' the other windies. If they do, he takes his station there.
D'ye follow?"</p>

<p>Sir Archie nodded gloomily. "What is my post?" Saskia asked.</p>

<p>"I've appointed ye my Chief of Staff," was the answer. "Ye see
we've no reserves. If this door's the dangerous bit, it maun be
reinforced from elsewhere; and that'll want savage thinkin'. Ye'll
have to be ay on the move, Mem, and keep me informed. If they
break in at two bits, we're beat, and there'll be nothin' for
it but to retire to our last position. Ye ken the room ayont the
hall where they keep the coats. That's our last trench, and at
the worst we fall back there and stick it out. It has a strong
door and a wee windy, so they'll no' be able to get in on our
rear. We should be able to put up a good defence there, unless
they fire the place over our heads.... Now, we'd better give out
the guns."</p>

<p>"We don't want any shootin' if we can avoid it," said Sir Archie,
who found his distaste for Dougal growing, though he was under
the spell of the one being there who knew precisely his own mind.</p>

<p>"Just what I was goin' to say. My instructions is, reserve your
fire, and don't loose off till you have a man up against the end
o' your barrel."</p>

<p>"Good Lord, we'll get into a horrible row. The whole thing may
be a mistake, and we'll be had up for wholesale homicide. No man
shall fire unless I give the word."</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief looked at him darkly. Some bitter retort
was on his tongue, but he restrained himself.</p>

<p>"It appears," he said, "that ye think I'm doin' all this for
fun. I'll no 'argy wi' ye. There can be just the one general in
a battle, but I'll give ye permission to say the word when to
fire.... Macgreegor!" he muttered, a strange expletive only used
in moments of deep emotion. "I'll wager ye'll be for sayin' the
word afore I'd say it mysel'."</p>

<p>He turned to the Princess. "I hand over to you, till I am back,
for I maun be off and see to the Die-Hards. I wish I could bring
them in here, but I daren't lose my communications. I'll likely
get in by the boiler-house skylight when I come back, but it might
be as well to keep a road open here unless ye're actually attacked."</p>

<p>Dougal clambered over the mattresses and the grand piano; a flicker
of waning daylight appeared for a second as he squeezed through
the door, and Sir Archie was left staring at the wrathful countenance
of McGuffog. He laughed ruefully.</p>

<p>"I've been in about forty battles, and here's that little devil
rather worried about my pluck, and talkin' to me like a corps
commander to a newly joined second-lieutenant. All the same he's
a remarkable child, and we'd better behave as if we were in for
a real shindy. What do you think, Princess?"</p>

<p>"I think we are in for what you call a shindy. I am in command,
remember. I order you to serve out the guns."</p>

<p>This was done, a shot-gun and a hundred cartridges to each, while
McGuffog, who was a marksman, was also given a sporting Mannlicher,
and two other rifles, a .303 and a small-bore Holland, were kept
in reserve in the hall. Sir Archie, free from Dougal's compelling
presence, gave the gamekeeper peremptory orders not to shoot till
he was bidden, and Carfrae at the kitchen door was warned to the
same effect. The shuttered house, where the only light apart from
the garden-room was the feeble spark of the electric torches,
had the most disastrous effect upon his spirits. The gale which
roared in the chimney and eddied among the rafters of the hall
seemed an infernal commotion in a tomb.</p>

<p>"Let's go upstairs," he told Saskia; "there must be a view from
the upper windows."</p>

<p>"You can see the top of the old Tower, and part of the sea,"
she said. "I know it well, for it was my only amusement to look
at it. On clear days, too, one could see high mountains far in
the west." His depression seemed to have affected her, for she
spoke listlessly, unlike the vivid creature who had led the way
in.</p>

<p>In a gaunt west-looking bedroom, the one in which Heritage and
Dickson had camped the night before, they opened a fold of the
shutters and looked out into a world of grey wrack and driving
rain. The Tower roof showed mistily beyond the ridge of down,
but its environs were not in their prospect. The lower regions
of the House had been gloomy enough, but this bleak place with
its drab outlook struck a chill to Sir Archie's soul. He dolefully
lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"This is a pretty rotten show for you," he told her. "It strikes
me as a rather unpleasant brand of nightmare."</p>

<p>"I have been living with nightmares for three years," she said
wearily.</p>

<p>He cast his eyes round the room. "I think the Kennedys were mad
to build this confounded barrack. I've always disliked it, and
old Quentin hadn't any use for it either. Cold, cheerless, raw
monstrosity! It hasn't been a very giddy place for you, Princess."</p>

<p>"It has been my prison, when I hoped it would be a sanctuary.
But it may yet be my salvation."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I hope so. I say, you must be jolly hungry. I don't
suppose there's any chance of tea for you."</p>

<p>She shook her head. She was looking fixedly at the Tower, as
if she expected something to appear there, and he followed her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Rum old shell, that. Quentin used to keep all kinds of live
stock there, and when we were boys it was our castle where we
played at bein' robber chiefs. It'll be dashed queer if the real
thing should turn up this time. I suppose McCunn's Poet is roostin'
there all by his lone. Can't say I envy him his job."</p>

<p>Suddenly she caught his arm. "I see a man," she whispered. "There!
He is behind those far bushes. There is his head again!"</p>

<p>It was clearly a man, but he presently disappeared, for he had
come round by the south end of the House, past the stables, and
had now gone over the ridge.</p>

<p>"The cut of his jib is uncommonly like Loudon, the factor. I
thought McCunn had stretched him on a bed of pain. Lord, if this
thing should turn out a farce, I simply can't face Loudon....
I say, Princess, you don't suppose by any chance that McCunn's
a little bit wrong in the head?"</p>

<p>She turned her candid eyes on him. "You are in a very doubting
mood."</p>

<p>"My feet are cold and I don't mind admittin' it. Hanged if I
know what it is, but I don't feel this show a bit real. If it
isn't, we're in a fair way to make howlin' idiots of ourselves,
and get pretty well embroiled with the law. It's all right for
the red-haired boy, for he can take everything seriously, even
play. I could do the same thing myself when I was a kid. I don't
mind runnin' some kinds of risk &mdash;I've had a few in my time&mdash;but
this is so infernally outlandish and I &mdash;I don't quite believe
in it. That is to say, I believe in it right enough when I look
at you or listen to McCunn, but as soon as my eyes are off you
I begin to doubt again. I'm gettin' old and I've a stake in the
country, and I daresay I'm gettin' a bit of a prig&mdash;anyway I don't
want to make a jackass of myself. Besides, there's this foul weather
and this beastly house to ice my feet."</p>

<p>He broke off with an exclamation, for on the grey cloud-bounded
stage in which the roof of the Tower was the central feature,
actors had appeared. Dim hurrying shapes showed through the mist,
dipping over the ridge, as if coming from the Garplefoot.</p>

<p>She seized his arm and he saw that her listlessness was gone.
Her eyes were shining.</p>

<p>"It is they," she cried. "The nightmare is real at last. Do you
doubt now?"</p>

<p>He could only stare, for these shapes arriving and vanishing
like wisps of fog still seemed to him phantasmal. The girl held
his arm tightly clutched, and craned towards the window space.
He tried to open the frame, and succeeded in smashing the glass.
A swirl of wind drove inwards and blew a loose lock of Saskia's
hair across his brow.</p>

<p>"I wish Dougal were back," he muttered, and then came the crack
of a shot.</p>

<p>The pressure on his arm slackened, and a pale face was turned
to him. "He is alone &mdash;Mr. Heritage. He has no chance. They
will kill him like a dog."</p>

<p>"They'll never get in," he assured her. "Dougal said the place
could hold out for hours."</p>

<p>Another shot followed and presently a third. She twined her hands
and her eyes were wild.</p>

<p>"We can't leave him to be killed," she gasped.</p>

<p>"It's the only game. We're playin' for time, remember. Besides
he won't be killed. Great Scott!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, a sudden explosion cleft the drone of the wind and
a patch of gloom flashed into yellow light.</p>

<p>"Bomb!" he cried. "Lord, I might have thought of that."</p>

<p>The girl had sprung back from the window. "I cannot bear it.
I will not see him murdered in sight of his friends. I am going
to show myself, and when they see me they will leave him.... No,
you must stay here. Presently they will be round this house. Don't
be afraid for me &mdash;I am very quick of foot."</p>

<p>"For God's sake, don't! Here, Princess, stop," and he clutched
at her skirt. "Look here, I'll go."</p>

<p>"You can't. You have been wounded. I am in command, you know.
Keep the door open till I come back."</p>

<p>He hobbled after her, but she easily eluded him. She was smiling
now, and blew a kiss to him. "La, la, la," she trilled, as she
ran down the stairs. He heard her voice below, admonishing McGuffog.
Then he pulled himself together and went back to the window. He
had brought the little Holland with him, and he poked its barrel
through the hole in the glass.</p>

<p>"Curse my game leg," he said, almost cheerfully, for the situation
was now becoming one with which he could cope. "I ought to be
able to hold up the pursuit a bit. My aunt! What a girl!"</p>

<p>With the rifle cuddled to his shoulder he watched a slim figure
come into sight on the lawn, running towards the ridge. He reflected
that she must have dropped from the high verandah wall. That reminded
him that something must be done to make the wall climbable for
her return, so he went down to McGuffog, and the two squeezed
through the barricaded door to the verandah. The boiler-house
ladder was still in position, but it did not reach half the height,
so McGuffog was adjured to stand by to help, and in the meantime
to wait on duty by the wall. Then he hurried upstairs to his watch-tower.</p>

<p>The girl was in sight, almost on the crest of the high ground.
There she stood for a moment, one hand clutching at her errant
hair, the other shielding her eyes from the sting of the rain.
He heard her cry, as Heritage had heard her, but since the wind
was blowing towards him the sound came louder and fuller. Again
she cried, and then stood motionless with her hands above her
head. It was only for an instant, for the next he saw she had
turned and was racing down the slope, jumping the little scrogs
of hazel like a deer. On the ridge appeared faces, and then over
it swept a mob of men.</p>

<p>She had a start of some fifty yards, and laboured to increase
it, having doubtless the verandah wall in mind. Sir Archie, sick
with anxiety, nevertheless spared time to admire her prowess.
"Gad! she's a miler," he ejaculated. "She'll do it. I'm hanged
if she don't do it."</p>

<p>Against men in seaman's boots and heavy clothing she had a clear
advantage. But two shook themselves loose from the pack and began
to gain on her. At the main shrubbery they were not thirty yards
behind, and in her passage through it her skirts must have delayed
her, for when she emerged the pursuit had halved the distance.
He got the sights of the rifle on the first man, but the lawns
sloped up towards the house, and to his consternation he found
that the girl was in the line of fire. Madly he ran to the other
window of the room, tore back the shutters, shivered the glass,
and flung his rifle to his shoulder. The fellow was within three
yards of her, but thank God! he had now a clear field. He fired
low and just ahead of him, and had the satisfaction to see him
drop like a rabbit, shot in the leg. His companion stumbled over
him, and for a moment the girl was safe.</p>

<p>But her speed was failing. She passed out of sight on the verandah
side of the house, and the rest of the pack had gained ominously
over the easier ground of the lawn. He thought for a moment of
trying to stop them by his fire, but realised that if every shot
told there would still be enough of them left to make sure of
her capture. The only chance was at the verandah, and he went
downstairs at a pace undreamed of since the days when he had two
whole legs.</p>

<p>McGuffog, Mannlicher in hand, was poking his neck over the wall.
The pursuit had turned the corner and were about twenty yards
off; the girl was at the foot of the ladder, breathless, drooping
with fatigue. She tried to climb, limply and feebly, and very
slowly, as if she were too giddy to see clear. Above were two
cripples, and at her back the van of the now triumphant pack.</p>

<p>Sir Archie, game leg or no, was on the parapet preparing to drop
down and hold off the pursuit were it only for seconds. But at
that moment he was aware that the situation had changed.</p>

<p>At the foot of the ladder a tall man seemed to have sprung out
of the ground. He caught the girl in his arms, climbed the ladder,
and McGuffog's great hands reached down and seized her and swung
her into safety. Up the wall, by means of cracks and tufts, was
shinning a small boy.</p>

<p>The stranger coolly faced the pursuers and at the sight of him
they checked, those behind stumbling against those in front. He
was speaking to them in a foreign tongue, and to Sir Archie's
ear the words were like the crack of a lash. The hesitation was
only for a moment, for a voice among them cried out, and the whole
pack gave tongue shrilly and surged on again. But that instant
of check had given the stranger his chance. He was up the ladder,
and, gripping the parapet, found rest for his feet in a fissure.
Then he bent down, drew up the ladder, handed it to McGuffog and
with a mighty heave pulled himself over the top.</p>

<p>He seemed to hope to defend the verandah, but the door at the
west end was being assailed by a contingent of the enemy, and
he saw that its thin woodwork was yielding.</p>

<p>"Into the House," he cried, as he picked up the ladder and tossed
it over the wall on the pack surging below. He was only just in
time, for the west door yielded. In two steps he had followed
McGuffog through the chink into the passage, and the concussion
of the grand piano pushed hard against the verandah door from
within coincided with the first battering on the said door from
without.</p>

<p>In the garden-room the feeble lamp showed a strange grouping.
Saskia had sunk into a chair to get her breath, and seemed too
dazed to be aware of her surroundings. Dougal was manfully striving
to appear at his ease, but his lip was quivering.</p>

<p>"A near thing that time," he observed. "It was the blame of that
man's auld motor-bicycle."</p>

<p>The stranger cast sharp eyes around the place and company.</p>

<p>"An awkward corner, gentlemen," he said. "How many are there
of you? Four men and a boy? And you have placed guards at all
the entrances?"</p>

<p>"They have bombs," Sir Archie reminded him.</p>

<p>"No doubt. But I do not think they will use them here&mdash;or their
guns, unless there is no other way. Their purpose is kidnapping,
and they hope to do it secretly and slip off without leaving a
trace. If they slaughter us, as they easily can, the cry will
be out against them, and their vessel will be unpleasantly hunted.
Half their purpose is already spoiled, for it is no longer secret....
They may break us by sheer weight, and I fancy the first shooting
will be done by us. It's the windows I'm afraid of."</p>

<p>Some tone in his quiet voice reached the girl in the wicker chair.
She looked up wildly, saw him and with a cry of "Alesha" ran to
his arms. There she hung, while his hand fondled her hair, like
a mother with a scared child. Sir Archie, watching the whole thing
in some stupefaction, thought he had never in his days seen more
nobly matched human creatures.</p>

<p>"It is my friend," she cried triumphantly, "the friend whom I
appointed to meet me here. Oh, I did well to trust him. Now we
need not fear anything."</p>

<p>As if in ironical answer came a great crashing at the verandah
door, and the twanging of chords cruelly mishandled. The grand
piano was suffering internally from the assaults of the boiler-house
ladder.</p>

<p>"Wull I gie them a shot?" was McGuffog's hoarse inquiry.</p>

<p>"Action stations," Alexis ordered, for the command seemed to
have shifted to him from Dougal. "The windows are the danger.
The boy will patrol the ground floor, and give us warning, and
I and this man," pointing to Sime, "will be ready at the threatened
point. And for God's sake no shooting, unless I give the word.
If we take them on at that game we haven't a chance."</p>

<p>He said something to Saskia in Russian and she smiled assent
and went to Sir Archie's side. "You and I must keep this door,"
she said.</p>

<p>Sir Archie was never very clear afterwards about the events of
the next hour. The Princess was in the maddest spirits, as if
the burden of three years had slipped from her and she was back
in her first girlhood. She sang as she carried more lumber to
the pile&mdash;perhaps the song which had once entranced Heritage,
but Sir Archie had no ear for music. She mocked at the furious
blows which rained at the other end, for the door had gone now,
and in the windy gap could be seen a blur of dark faces. Oddly
enough, he found his own spirits mounting to meet hers. It was
real business at last, the qualms of the civilian had been forgotten,
and there was rising in him that joy in a scrap which had once
made him one of the most daring airmen on the Western Front. The
only thing that worried him now was the coyness about shooting.
What on earth were his rifles and shot-guns for unless to be used?
He had seen the enemy from the verandah wall, and a more ruffianly
crew he had never dreamed of. They meant the uttermost business,
and against such it was surely the duty of good citizens to wage
whole-hearted war.</p>

<p>The Princess was humming to herself a nursery rhyme. "The King
of Spain's daughter," she crooned, "came to visit me, and all
for the sake-&mdash;Oh, that poor piano!" In her clear voice she
cried something in Russian, and the wind carried a laugh from
the verandah. At the sound of it she stopped. "I had forgotten,"
she said. "Paul is there. I had forgotten." After that she was
very quiet, but she redoubled her labours at the barricade.</p>

<p>To the man it seemed that the pressure from without was slackening.
He called to McGuffog to ask about the garden-room window, and
the reply was reassuring. The gamekeeper was gloomily contemplating
Dougal's tubs of water and wire-netting, as he might have contemplated
a vermin trap.</p>

<p>Sir Archie was growing acutely anxious&mdash;the anxiety of the defender
of a straggling fortress which is vulnerable at a dozen points.
It seemed to him that strange noises were coming from the rooms
beyond the hall. Did the back door lie that way? And was not there
a smell of smoke in the air? If they tried fire in such a gale
the place would burn like matchwood.</p>

<p>He left his post and in the hall found Dougal.</p>

<p>"All quiet," the Chieftain reported. "Far ower quiet. I don't
like it. The enemy's no' puttin' out his strength yet. The Russian
says a' the west windies are terrible dangerous. Him and the chauffeur's
doin' their best, but ye can't block thae muckle glass panes."</p>

<p>He returned to the Princess, and found that the attack had indeed
languished on that particular barricade. The withers of the grand
piano were left unwrung, and only a faint scuffling informed him
that the verandah was not empty. "They're gathering for an attack
elsewhere," he told himself. But what if that attack were a feint?
He and McGuffog must stick to their post, for in his belief the
verandah door and the garden-room window were the easiest places
where an entry in mass could be forced.</p>

<p>Suddenly Dougal's whistle blew, and with it came a most almighty
crash somewhere towards the west side. With a shout of "Hold tight,
McGuffog," Sir Archie bolted into the hall, and, led by the sound,
reached what had once been the ladies' bedroom. A strange sight
met his eyes, for the whole framework of one window seemed to
have been thrust inward, and in the gap Alexis was swinging a
fender. Three of the enemy were in the room&mdash;one senseless on
the floor, one in the grip of Sime, whose single hand was tightly
clenched on his throat, and one engaged with Dougal in a corner.
The Die-Hard leader was sore pressed, and to his help Sir Archie
went. The fresh assault made the seaman duck his head, and Dougal
seized the occasion to smite him hard with something which caused
him to roll over. It was Spidel's life-preserver which he had
annexed that afternoon.</p>

<p>Alexis at the window seemed to have for a moment daunted the
attack. "Bring that table," he cried, and the thing was jammed
into the gap. "Now you"&mdash;this to Sime&mdash;"get the man from the back
door to hold this place with his gun. There's no attack there.
It's about time for shooting now, or we'll have them in our rear.
What in heaven is that?"</p>

<p>It was McGuffog whose great bellow resounded down the corridor.
Sir Archie turned and shuffled back, to be met by a distressing
spectacle. The lamp, burning as peacefully as it might have burned
on an old lady's tea-table, revealed the window of the garden-room
driven bodily inward, shutters and all, and now forming an inclined
bridge over Dougal's ineffectual tubs. In front of it stood McGuffog,
swinging his gun by the barrel and yelling curses, which, being
mainly couched in the vernacular, were happily meaningless to
Saskia. She herself stood at the hall door, plucking at something
hidden in her breast. He saw that it was a little ivory-handled
pistol.</p>

<p>The enemy's feint had succeeded, for even as Sir Archie looked
three men leaped into the room. On the neck of one the butt of
McGuffog's gun crashed, but two scrambled to their feet and made
for the girl. Sir Archie met the first with his fist, a clean
drive on the jaw, followed by a damaging hook with his left that
put him out of action. The other hesitated for an instant and
was lost, for McGuffog caught him by the waist from behind and
sent him through the broken frame to join his comrades without.</p>

<p>"Up the stairs," Dougal was shouting, for the little room beyond
the hall was clearly impossible. "Our flank's turned. They're
pourin' through the other windy." Out of a corner of his eye Sir
Archie caught sight of Alexis, with Sime and Carfrae in support,
being slowly forced towards them along the corridor. "Upstairs,"
he shouted. "Come on, McGuffog. Lead on, Princess." He dashed
out the lamp, and the place was in darkness.</p>

<p>With this retreat from the forward trench line ended the opening
phase of the battle. It was achieved in good order, and position
was taken up on the first-floor landing, dominating the main staircase
and the passage that led to the back stairs. At their back was
a short corridor ending in a window which gave on the north side
of the House above the verandah, and from which an active man
might descend to the verandah roof. It had been carefully reconnoitred
beforehand by Dougal, and his were the dispositions.</p>

<p>The odd thing was that the retreating force were in good heart.
The three men from the Mains were warming to their work, and McGuffog
wore an air of genial ferocity. "Dashed fine position I call this,"
said Sir Archie. Only Alexis was silent and preoccupied. "We are
still at their mercy," he said. "Pray God your police come soon."
He forbade shooting yet awhile. "The lady is our strong card,"
he said. "They won't use their guns while she is with us, but
if it ever comes to shooting they can wipe us out in a couple
of minutes. One of you watch that window, for Paul Abreskov is
no fool."</p>

<p>Their exhilaration was short-lived. Below in the hall it was
black darkness save for a greyness at the entrance of the verandah
passage; but the defence was soon aware that the place was thick
with men. Presently there came a scuffling from Carfrae's post
towards the back stairs, and a cry as of some one choking. And
at the same moment a flare was lit below which brought the whole
hall from floor to rafters into blinding light.</p>

<p>It revealed a crowd of figures, some still in the hall and some
half-way up the stairs, and it revealed, too, more figures at
the end of the upper landing where Carfrae had been stationed.
The shapes were motionless like mannequins in a shop window.</p>

<p>"They've got us treed all right," Sir Archie groaned. "What the
devil are they waiting for?"</p>

<p>"They wait for their leader," said Alexis.</p>

<p>No one of the party will ever forget the ensuing minutes. After
the hubbub of the barricades the ominous silence was like icy
water, chilling and petrifying with an indefinable fear. There
was no sound but the wind, but presently mingled with it came
odd wild voices.</p>

<p>"Hear to the whaups," McGuffog whispered.</p>

<p>Sir Archie, who found the tension unbearable, sought relief in
contradiction. "You're an unscientific brute, McGuffog," he told
his henchman. "It's a disgrace that a gamekeeper should be such
a rotten naturalist. What would whaups be doin' here at this time
of year?"</p>

<p>"A' the same, I could swear it's whaups, Sir Erchibald."</p>

<p>Then Dougal broke in and his voice was excited. "It's no whaups.
That's our patrol signal. Man, there's hope for us yet. I believe
it's the polis."</p>

<p>His words were unheeded, for the figures below drew apart and
a young man came through them. His beautifully-shaped dark head
was bare, and as he moved he unbuttoned his oilskins and showed
the trim dark-blue garb of the yachtsman. He walked confidently
up the stairs, an odd elegant figure among his heavy companions.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Alexis," he said in English. "I think we may
now regard this interesting episode as closed. I take it that
you surrender. Saskia, dear, you are coming with me on a little
journey. Will you tell my men where to find your baggage?"</p>

<p>The reply was in Russian. Alexis' voice was as cool as the other's,
and it seemed to wake him to anger. He replied in a rapid torrent
of words, and appealed to the men below, who shouted back. The
flare was dying down, and shadows again hid most of the hall.</p>

<p>Dougal crept up behind Sir Archie. "Here, I think it's the polis.
They're whistlin' outbye, and I hear folk cryin' to each other&mdash;no'
the foreigners."</p>

<p>Again Alexis spoke, and then Saskia joined in. What she said
rang sharp with contempt, and her fingers played with her little
pistol.</p>

<p>Suddenly before the young man could answer Dobson bustled towards
him. The innkeeper was labouring under some strong emotion, for
he seemed to be pleading and pointing urgently towards the door.</p>

<p>"I tell ye it's the polis," whispered Dougal. "They're nickit."</p>

<p>There was a swaying in the crowd and anxious faces. Men surged
in, whispered and went out, and a clamour arose which the leader
stilled with a fierce gesture.</p>

<p>"You there," he cried, looking up, "you English. We mean you
no ill, but I require you to hand over to me the lady and the
Russian who is with her. I give you a minute by my watch to decide.
If you refuse my men are behind you and around you, and you go
with me to be punished at my leisure."</p>

<p>"I warn you," cried Sir Archie. "We are armed, and will shoot
down any one who dares to lay a hand on us."</p>

<p>"You fool," came the answer. "I can send you all to eternity
before you touch a trigger."</p>

<p>LÃ©on was by his side now &mdash;LÃ©on and Spidel, imploring him
to do something which he angrily refused. Outside there was a
new clamour, faces showing at the door and then vanishing, and
an anxious hum filled the hall.... Dobson appeared again and this
time he was a figure of fury.</p>

<p>"Are ye daft, man?" he cried. "I tell ye the polis are closin'
round us, and there's no' a moment to lose if we would get back
to the boats. If ye'll no' think o' your own neck, I'm thinkin'
o' mine. The whole thing's a bloody misfire. Come on, lads, if
ye're no' besotted on destruction."</p>

<p>LÃ©on laid a hand on the leader's arm and was roughly shaken off.
Spidel fared no better, and the little group on the upper landing
saw the two shrug their shoulders and make for the door. The hall
was emptying fast, and the watchers had gone from the back stairs.
The young man's voice rose to a scream; he commanded, threatened,
cursed; but panic was in the air and he had lost his mastery.</p>

<p>"Quick," croaked Dougal, "now's the time for the counter-attack."</p>

<p>But the figure on the stairs held them motionless. They could
not see his face, but by instinct they knew that it was distraught
with fury and defeat. The flare blazed up again as the flame caught
a knot of fresh powder, and once more the place was bright with
the uncanny light.... The hall was empty save for the pale man
who was in the act of turning.</p>

<p>He looked back. "If I go now, I will return. The world is not
wide enough to hide you from me, Saskia."</p>

<p>"You will never get her," said Alexis.</p>

<p>A sudden devil flamed into his eyes, the devil of some ancestral
savagery, which would destroy what is desired but unattainable.
He swung round, his hand went to his pocket, something clicked,
and his arm shot out like a baseball pitcher's.</p>

<p>So intent was the gaze of the others on him, that they did not
see a second figure ascending the stairs. Just as Alexis flung
himself before the Princess, the new-comer caught the young man's
outstretched arm and wrenched something from his hand. The next
second he had hurled it into a far corner where stood the great
fireplace. There was a blinding sheet of flame, a dull roar, and
then billow upon billow of acrid smoke. As it cleared they saw
that the fine Italian chimneypiece, the pride of the builder of
the House, was a mass of splinters, and that a great hole had
been blown through the wall into what had been the dining-room....
A figure was sitting on the bottom step feeling its bruises. The
last enemy had gone.</p>

<p>When Mr. John Heritage raised his eyes he saw the Princess with
a very pale face in the arms of a tall man whom he had never seen
before. If he was surprised at the sight, he did not show it.
"Nasty little bomb that. Time fuse. I remember we struck the brand
first in July '18."</p>

<p>"Are they rounded up?" Sir Archie asked.</p>

<p>"They've bolted. Whether they'll get away is another matter.
I left half the mounted police a minute ago at the top of the
West Lodge avenue. The other lot went to the Garplefoot to cut
off the boats."</p>

<p>"Good Lord, man," Sir Archie cried, "the police have been here
for the last ten minutes."</p>

<p>"You're wrong. They came with me."</p>

<p>"Then what on earth&#11834;?" began the astonished baronet. He stopped
short, for he suddenly got his answer. Into the hall from the
verandah limped a boy. Never was there seen so ruinous a child.
He was dripping wet, his shirt was all but torn off his back,
his bleeding nose was poorly staunched by a wisp of handkerchief,
his breeches were in ribbons, and his poor bare legs looked as
if they had been comprehensively kicked and scratched. Limpingly
he entered, yet with a kind of pride, like some small cock-sparrow
who has lost most of his plumage but has vanquished his adversary.</p>

<p>With a yell Dougal went down the stairs. The boy saluted him,
and they gravely shook hands. It was the meeting of Wellington
and BlÃ¼cher.</p>

<p>The Chieftain's voice shrilled in triumph, but there was a break
in it. The glory was almost too great to be borne.</p>

<p>"I kenned it," he cried. "It was the Gorbals Die-Hards. There
stands the man that done it.... Ye'll no' fickle Thomas Yownie."</p>
