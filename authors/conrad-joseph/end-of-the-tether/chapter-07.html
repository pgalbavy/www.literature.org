<p> Sterne went down smirking and apparently not at all disconcerted,
but the engineer Massy remained on the bridge, moving about with
uneasy self-assertion. Everybody on board was his inferior&mdash;everyone
without exception. He paid their wages and found them in their
food. They ate more of his bread and pocketed more of his money
than they were worth; and they had no care in the world, while
he alone had to meet all the difficulties of shipowning. When
he contemplated his position in all its menacing entirety, it
seemed to him that he had been for years the prey of a band of
parasites: and for years he had scowled at everybody connected
with the Sofala except, perhaps, at the Chinese firemen who served
to get her along. Their use was manifest: they were an indispensable
part of the machinery of which he was the master.</p>

<p>When he passed along his decks he shouldered those he came across
brutally; but the Malay deck hands had learned to dodge out of
his way. He had to bring himself to tolerate them because of the
necessary manual labor of the ship which must be done. He had
to struggle and plan and scheme to keep the Sofala afloat&mdash;and
what did he get for it? Not even enough respect. They could not
have given him enough of that if all their thoughts and all their
actions had been directed to that end. The vanity of possession,
the vainglory of power, had passed away by this time, and there
remained only the material embarrassments, the fear of losing
that position which had turned out not worth having, and an anxiety
of thought which no abject subservience of men could repay.</p>

<p>He walked up and down. The bridge was his own after all. He had
paid for it; and with the stem of the pipe in his hand he would
stop short at times as if to listen with a profound and concentrated
attention to the deadened beat of the engines (his own engines)
and the slight grinding of the steering chains upon the continuous
low wash of water alongside. But for these sounds, the ship might
have been lying as still as if moored to a bank, and as silent
as if abandoned by every living soul; only the coast, the low
coast of mud and mangroves with the three palms in a bunch at
the back, grew slowly more distinct in its long straight line,
without a single feature to arrest attention. The native passengers
of the Sofala lay about on mats under the awnings; the smoke of
her funnel seemed the only sign of her life and connected with
her gliding motion in a mysterious manner.</p>

<p>Captain Whalley on his feet, with a pair of binoculars in his
hand and the little Malay Serang at his elbow, like an old giant
attended by a wizened pigmy, was taking her over the shallow water
of the bar.</p>

<p>This submarine ridge of mud, scoured by the stream out of the
soft bottom of the river and heaped up far out on the hard bottom
of the sea, was difficult to get over. The alluvial coast having
no distinguishing marks, the bearings of the crossing-place had
to be taken from the shape of the mountains inland. The guidance
of a form flattened and uneven at the top like a grinder tooth,
and of another smooth, saddle-backed summit, had to be searched
for within the great unclouded glare that seemed to shift and
float like a dry fiery mist, filling the air, ascending from the
water, shrouding the distances, scorching to the eye. In this
veil of light the near edge of the shore alone stood out almost
coal-black with an opaque and motionless solidity. Thirty miles
away the serrated range of the interior stretched across the horizon,
its outlines and shades of blue, faint and tremulous like a background
painted on airy gossamer on the quivering fabric of an impalpable
curtain let down to the plain of alluvial soil; and the openings
of the estuary appeared, shining white, like bits of silver let
into the square pieces snipped clean and sharp out of the body
of the land bordered with mangroves.</p>

<p>On the forepart of the bridge the giant and the pigmy muttered
to each other frequently in quiet tones. Behind them Massy stood
sideways with an expression of disdain and suspense on his face.
His globular eyes were perfectly motionless, and he seemed to
have forgotten the long pipe he held in his hand.</p>

<p>On the fore-deck below the bridge, steeply roofed with the white
slopes of the awnings, a young lascar seaman had clambered outside
the rail. He adjusted quickly a broad band of sail canvas under
his armpits, and throwing his chest against it, leaned out far
over the water. The sleeves of his thin cotton shirt, cut off
close to the shoulder, bared his brown arm of full rounded form
and with a satiny skin like a woman’s. He swung it rigidly with
the rotary and menacing action of a slinger: the 14-lb. weight
hurtled circling in the air, then suddenly flew ahead as far as
the curve of the bow. The wet thin line swished like scratched
silk running through the dark fingers of the man, and the plunge
of the lead close to the ship’s side made a vanishing silvery
scar upon the golden glitter; then after an interval the voice
of the young Malay uplifted and long-drawn declared the depth
of the water in his own language.</p>

<p>"Tiga stengah," he cried after each splash and pause, gathering
the line busily for another cast. "Tiga stengah," which means
three fathom and a half. For a mile or so from seaward there was
a uniform depth of water right up to the bar. "Half-three. Half-three.
Half-three,"&mdash;and his modulated cry, returned leisurely and monotonous,
like the repeated call of a bird, seemed to float away in sunshine
and disappear in the spacious silence of the empty sea and of
a lifeless shore lying open, north and south, east and west, without
the stir of a single cloud-shadow or the whisper of any other
voice.</p>

<p>The owner-engineer of the Sofala remained very still behind the
two seamen of different race, creed, and color; the European with
the time-defying vigor of his old frame, the little Malay, old,
too, but slight and shrunken like a withered brown leaf blown
by a chance wind under the mighty shadow of the other. Very busy
looking forward at the land, they had not a glance to spare; and
Massy, glaring at them from behind, seemed to resent their attention
to their duty like a personal slight upon himself.</p>

<p>This was unreasonable; but he had lived in his own world of unreasonable
resentments for many years. At last, passing his moist palm over
the rare lanky wisps of coarse hair on the top of his yellow head,
he began to talk slowly.</p>

<p>"A leadsman, you want! I suppose that’s your correct mail-boat
style. Haven’t you enough judgment to tell where you are by looking
at the land? Why, before I had been a twelvemonth in the trade
I was up to that trick&mdash;and I am only an engineer. I can point
to you from here where the bar is, and I could tell you besides
that you are as likely as not to stick her in the mud in about
five minutes from now; only you would call it interfering, I suppose.
And there’s that written agreement of ours, that says I mustn’t
interfere."</p>

<p>His voice stopped. Captain Whalley, without relaxing the set
severity of his features, moved his lips to ask in a quick mumble&mdash;</p>

<p>"How near, Serang?"</p>

<p>"Very near now, Tuan," the Malay muttered rapidly.</p>

<p>"Dead slow," said the Captain aloud in a firm tone.</p>

<p>The Serang snatched at the handle of the telegraph. A gong clanged
down below. Massy with a scornful snigger walked off and put his
head down the engineroom skylight.</p>

<p>"You may expect some rare fooling with the engines, Jack," he
bellowed. The space into which he stared was deep and full of
gloom; and the gray gleams of steel down there seemed cool after
the intense glare of the sea around the ship. The air, however,
came up clammy and hot on his face. A short hoot on which it would
have been impossible to put any sort of interpretation came from
the bottom cavernously. This was the way in which the second engineer
answered his chief.</p>

<p>He was a middle-aged man with an inattentive manner, and apparently
wrapped up in such a taciturn concern for his engines that he
seemed to have lost the use of speech. When addressed directly
his only answer would be a grunt or a hoot, according to the distance.
For all the years he had been in the Sofala he had never been
known to exchange as much as a frank Good-morning with any of
his shipmates. He did not seem aware that men came and went in
the world; he did not seem to see them at all. Indeed he never
recognized his ship mates on shore. At table (the four white men
of the Sofala messed together) he sat looking into his plate dispassionately,
but at the end of the meal would jump up and bolt down below as
if a sudden thought had impelled him to rush and see whether somebody
had not stolen the engines while he dined. In port at the end
of the trip he went ashore regularly, but no one knew where he
spent his evenings or in what manner. The local coasting fleet
had preserved a wild and incoherent tale of his infatuation for
the wife of a sergeant in an Irish infantry regiment. The regiment,
however, had done its turn of garrison duty there ages before,
and was gone somewhere to the other side of the earth, out of
men’s knowledge. Twice or perhaps three times in the course of
the year he would take too much to drink. On these occasions he
returned on board at an earlier hour than usual; ran across the
deck balancing himself with his spread arms like a tight-rope
walker; and locking the door of his cabin, he would converse and
argue with himself the livelong night in an amazing variety of
tones; storm, sneer, and whine with an inexhaustible persistence.
Massy in his berth next door, raising himself on his elbow, would
discover that his second had remembered the name of every white
man that had passed through the Sofala for years and years back.
He remembered the names of men that had died, that had gone home,
that had gone to America: he remembered in his cups the names
of men whose connection with the ship had been so short that Massy
had almost forgotten its circumstances and could barely recall
their faces. The inebriated voice on the other side of the bulkhead
commented upon them all with an extraordinary and ingenious venom
of scandalous inventions. It seems they had all offended him in
some way, and in return he had found them all out. He muttered
darkly; he laughed sardonically; he crushed them one after another;
but of his chief, Massy, he babbled with an envious and naive
admiration. Clever scoundrel! Don’t meet the likes of him every
day. Just look at him. Ha! Great! Ship of his own. Wouldn’t catch
<em>him</em> going wrong. No fear&mdash;the beast! And Massy, after
listening with a gratified smile to these artless tributes to
his greatness, would begin to shout, thumping at the bulkhead
with both fists&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shut up, you lunatic! Won’t you let me go to sleep, you fool!"</p>

<p>But a half smile of pride lingered on his lips; outside the solitary
lascar told off for night duty in harbor, perhaps a youth fresh
from a forest village, would stand motionless in the shadows of
the deck listening to the endless drunken gabble. His heart would
be thumping with breathless awe of white men: the arbitrary and
obstinate men who pursue inflexibly their incomprehensible purposes,&mdash;beings
with weird intonations in the voice, moved by unaccountable feelings,
actuated by inscrutable motives.</p>
