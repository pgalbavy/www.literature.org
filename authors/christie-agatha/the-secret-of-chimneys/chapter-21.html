<p>At ten o’clock that morning, Lord Caterham and his daughter were
breakfasting. Bundle was looking very thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Father," she said at last.</p>

<p>Lord Caterham, absorbed in <em>The Times</em>, did not reply.</p>

<p>"Father," said Bundle again, more sharply.</p>

<p>Lord Caterham, torn from his interested perusal of forthcoming
sales of rare books, looked up absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>"Eh?" he said. "Did you speak?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Who is it who’s had breakfast?"</p>

<p>She nodded towards a place that had evidently been occupied.
The rest were all expectant.</p>

<p>"Oh, what’s-his-name."</p>

<p>"Fat Iky?"</p>

<p>Bundle and her father had enough sympathy between them to comprehend
each other’s somewhat misleading observations.</p>

<p>"That’s it."</p>

<p>"Did I see you talking to the detective this morning before breakfast?"</p>

<p>Lord Caterham sighed.</p>

<p>"Yes, he buttonholed me in the hall. I do think the hours before
breakfast should be sacred. I shall have to go abroad. The strain
on my nerves——"</p>

<p>Bundle interrupted unceremoniously.</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"Said every one who wanted to could clear out."</p>

<p>"Well," said Bundle, "that’s all right. That’s what you’ve been
wanting."</p>

<p>"I know. But he didn’t leave it at that. He went on to say that
nevertheless he wanted me to ask every one to stay on."</p>

<p>"I don’t understand," said Bundle, wrinkling her nose.</p>

<p>"So confusing and contradictory," complained Lord Caterham. "And
before breakfast too."</p>

<p>"What did you say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I agreed, of course. It’s never any good arguing with these
people. Especially before breakfast," continued Lord Caterham,
reverting to his principal grievance.</p>

<p>"Who have you asked so far?"</p>

<p>"Cade. He was up very early this morning. He’s going to stop
on. I don’t mind that. I can’t quite make the fellow out; but
I like him—I like him very much."</p>

<p>"So does Virginia," said Bundle, drawing a pattern on the table
with her fork.</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"And so do I. But that doesn’t seem to matter."</p>

<p>"And I asked Isaacstein," continued Lord Caterham.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"But fortunately he’s got to go back to town. Don’t forget to
order the car for the 10.40, by the way."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"Now if I can only get rid of Fish too," continued Lord Caterham,
his spirits rising.</p>

<p>"I thought you liked talking to him about your mouldy old books."</p>

<p>"So I do, so I do. So I did, rather. But it gets monotonous when
one finds that one is always doing all the talking. Fish is very
interested, but he never volunteers any statements of his own."</p>

<p>"It’s better than doing all the listening," said Bundle. "Like
one does with George Lomax."</p>

<p>Lord Caterham shuddered at the remembrance.</p>

<p>"George is all very well on platforms," said Bundle. "I’ve clapped
him myself, though of course I know all the time that he’s talking
balderdash. And anyway I’m a Socialist——"</p>

<p>"I know, my dear, I know," said Lord Caterham hastily.</p>

<p>"It’s all right," said Bundle. "I’m not going to bring politics
into the house. That’s what George does—public speaking in private
life. It ought to be abolished by Act of Parliament."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Lord Caterham.</p>

<p>"What about Virginia?" asked Bundle. "Is she to be asked to stop
on?"</p>

<p>"Battle said everybody."</p>

<p>"Says he firmly! Have you asked her to be my stepma yet?"</p>

<p>"I don’t think it would be any good," said Lord Caterham mournfully.
"Although she did call me a darling last night. But that’s the
worst of these attractive young women with affectionate dispositions.
They’ll say anything, and they mean absolutely nothing by it."</p>

<p>"No," agreed Bundle. "It would have been much more hopeful if
she’d thrown a boot at you or tried to bite you."</p>

<p>"You modern young people seem to have such unpleasant ideas about
love-making," said Lord Caterham plaintively.</p>

<p>"It comes from reading <em>The Sheik</em>," said Bundle. "Desert
love. Throw her about, etc."</p>

<p>"What is <em>The Sheik</em>?" asked Lord Caterham simply. "Is
it a poem?"</p>

<p>Bundle looked at him with commiserating pity. Then she rose and
kissed the top of his head.</p>

<p>"Dear old Daddy," she remarked, and sprang lightly out of the
window.</p>

<p>Lord Caterham went back to the Sale Rooms.</p>

<p>He jumped when addressed suddenly by Mr. Hiram Fish, who had
made his usual noiseless entry.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Lord Caterham."</p>

<p>"Oh, good morning," said Lord Caterham. "Good morning. Nice day."</p>

<p>"The weather is delightful," said Mr. Fish.</p>

<p>He helped himself to coffee. By way of food, he took a piece
of dry toast.</p>

<p>"Do I hear correctly that the embargo is removed?" he asked after
a minute or two. "That we are all free to depart?"</p>

<p>"Yes—er—yes," said Lord Caterham. "As a matter of fact, I hoped,
I mean that I shall be delighted"—his conscience drove him on—"only
too delighted if you will stay on for a little."</p>

<p>"Why, Lord Caterham——"</p>

<p>"It’s been a beastly visit, I know," Lord Caterham hurried on.
"Too bad. Shan’t blame you for wanting to run away."</p>

<p>"You misjudge me, Lord Caterham. The associations have been painful,
no one could deny that point. But the English country life, as
lived in the mansions of the great, has a powerful attraction
for me. I am interested in the study of those conditions. It is
a thing we lack completely in America. I shall be only too delighted
to accept your vurry kind invitation and stay on."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Lord Caterham, "that’s that. Absolutely delighted,
my dear fellow, absolutely delighted."</p>

<p>Spurring himself on to a false geniality of manner, Lord Caterham
murmured something about having to see his bailiff and escaped
from the room.</p>

<p>In the hall, he saw Virginia just descending the staircase.</p>

<p>"Shall I take you into breakfast?" asked Lord Caterham tenderly.</p>

<p>"I’ve had it in bed, thank you. I was frightfully sleepy this
morning."</p>

<p>She yawned.</p>

<p>"Had a bad night, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly a bad night. From one point of view decidedly a
good night. Oh, Lord Caterham"—she slipped her hand inside his
arm and gave it a squeeze—"I <em>am</em> enjoying myself. You
were a darling to ask me down."</p>

<p>"You’ll stop on for a bit, then, won’t you? Battle is lifting
the—the embargo, but I want you to stay particularly. So does
Bundle."</p>

<p>"Of course I’ll stay. It’s sweet of you to ask me."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Lord Caterham.</p>

<p>He sighed.</p>

<p>"What is your secret sorrow?" asked Virginia. "Has anyone bitten
you?"</p>

<p>"That’s just it," said Lord Caterham mournfully.</p>

<p>Virginia looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"You don’t feel, by any chance, that you want to throw a boot
at me? No, I can see you don’t. Oh, well, it’s of no consequence."</p>

<p>Lord Caterham drifted sadly away, and Virginia passed out through
a side door into the garden.</p>

<p>She stood there for a moment, breathing in the crisp October
air which was infinitely refreshing to one in her slightly jaded
state.</p>

<p>She started a little to find Superintendent Battle at her elbow.
The man seemed to have an extraordinary knack of appearing out
of space without the least warning.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mrs. Revel. Not too tired, I hope?"</p>

<p>Virginia shook her head.</p>

<p>"It was a most exciting night," she said. "Well worth the loss
of a little sleep. The only thing is, to-day seems a little dull
after it."</p>

<p>"There’s a nice shady place down under that cedar tree," remarked
the superintendent. "Shall I take a chair down to it for you?"</p>

<p>"If you think it’s the best thing for me to do," said Virginia
solemnly.</p>

<p>"You’re very quick, Mrs. Revel. Yes, it’s quite true, I do want
a word with you."</p>

<p>He picked up a long wicker chair and carried it down the lawn.
Virginia followed him with a cushion under her arm.</p>

<p>"Very dangerous place, that terrace," remarked the detective.
"That is, if you want to have a private conversation."</p>

<p>"I’m getting excited again, Superintendent Battle."</p>

<p>"Oh, it’s nothing important." He took out a big watch and glanced
at it. "Half-past ten. I’m starting for Wyvvern Abbey in ten minutes
to report to Mr. Lomax. Plenty of time. I only wanted to know
if you could tell me a little more about Mr. Cade."</p>

<p>"About Mr. Cade?"</p>

<p>Virginia was startled.</p>

<p>"Yes, where you first met him, and how long you’ve known him
and so forth."</p>

<p>Battle’s manner was easy and pleasant enough. He even refrained
from looking at her, and the fact that he did so made her vaguely
uneasy.</p>

<p>"It’s more difficult than you think," she said at last. "He did
me a great service once——"</p>

<p>Battle interrupted her.</p>

<p>"Before you go any further, Mrs. Revel, I’d just like to say
something. Last night, after you and Mr. Eversleigh had gone to
bed, Mr. Cade told me all about the letters and the man who was
killed in your house."</p>

<p>"He did?" gasped Virginia.</p>

<p>"Yes, and very wisely too. It clears up a lot of misunderstanding.
There’s only one thing he didn’t tell me—how long he had known
you. Now I’ve a little idea of my own about that. You shall tell
me if I’m right or wrong. I think that the day he came to your
house in Pont Street was the first time you had ever seen him.
Ah! I see I’m right. It was so."</p>

<p>Virginia said nothing. For the first time she felt afraid of
this stolid man with the expressionless face. She understood what
Anthony had meant when he said there were no flies on Superintendent
Battle.</p>

<p>"Has he ever told you anything about his life?" the detective
continued. "Before he was in South Africa, I mean. Canada? Or
before that, the Sudan? Or about his boyhood?"</p>

<p>Virginia merely shook her head.</p>

<p>"And yet I’d bet he’s got something worth telling. You can’t
mistake the face of a man who’s led a life of daring and adventure.
He could tell you some interesting tales if he cared to."</p>

<p>"If you want to know about his past life, why don’t you cable
to that friend of his, Mr. McGrath?" Virginia asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, we have. But it seems he’s up country somewhere. Still,
there’s no doubt Mr. Cade was in Bulawayo when he said he was.
But I wondered what he’d been doing before he came to South Africa.
He’d only had that job with Castle’s about a month." He took out
his watch again. "I must be off. The car will be waiting."</p>

<p>Virginia watched him retreat to the house. But she did not move
from her chair. She hoped that Anthony might appear and join her.
Instead came Bill Eversleigh, with a prodigious yawn.</p>

<p>"Thank God, I’ve got a chance to speak to you at last, Virginia,"
he complained.</p>

<p>"Well, speak to me very gently, Bill darling, or I shall burst
into tears."</p>

<p>"Has some one been bullying you?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly bullying me. Getting inside my mind and turning
it inside out. I feel as though I’d been jumped on by an elephant."</p>

<p>"Not Battle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Battle. He’s a terrible man really."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind Battle. I say, Virginia, I do love you so awfully——"</p>

<p>"Not this morning, Bill. I’m not strong enough. Anyway, I’ve
always told you the best people don’t propose before lunch."</p>

<p>"Good Lord," said Bill. "I could propose to you before breakfast."</p>

<p>Virginia shuddered.</p>

<p>"Bill, be sensible and intelligent for a minute. I want to ask
your advice."</p>

<p>"If you’d once make up your mind to it, and say you’d marry me,
you’d feel miles better, I’m sure. Happier, you know, and more
settled down."</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Bill. Proposing to me is your <em>idée fixe</em>.
All men propose when they’re bored and can’t think of anything
to say. Remember my age and my widowed state, and go and make
love to a pure young girl."</p>

<p>"My darling Virginia—Oh, blast! here’s that French idiot bearing
down on us."</p>

<p>It was indeed M. Lemoine, black-bearded and correct of demeanour
as ever.</p>

<p>"Good morning, madame. You are not fatigued, I trust?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least."</p>

<p>"That is excellent. Good morning, Mr. Eversleigh."</p>

<p>"How would it be if we promenaded ourselves a little, the three
of us?" suggested the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"How about it, Bill?" said Virginia.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," said the unwilling young gentleman by her side.</p>

<p>He heaved himself up from the grass, and the three of them walked
slowly along. Virginia between the two men. She was sensible at
once of a strange undercurrent of excitement in the Frenchman,
though she had no clue as to what caused it.</p>

<p>Soon, with her usual skill, she was putting him at his ease,
asking him questions, listening to his answers, and gradually
drawing him out. Presently he was telling them anecdotes of the
famous King Victor. He talked well, albeit with a certain bitterness,
as he described the various ways in which the detective bureau
had been outwitted.</p>

<p>But all the time, despite the real absorption of Lemoine in his
own narrative, Virginia had a feeling that he had some other object
in view. Moreover, she judged that Lemoine, under cover of his
story, was deliberately striking out his own course across the
park. They were not just strolling idly. He was deliberately guiding
them in a certain direction.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he broke off his story and looked round. They were
standing just where the drive intersected the park before turning
an abrupt corner by a clump of trees. Lemoine was staring at a
vehicle approaching them from the direction of the house.</p>

<p>Virginia’s eyes followed his.</p>

<p>"It’s the luggage cart," she said, "taking Isaacstein’s luggage
and his valet to the station."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said Lemoine. He glanced down at his own watch
and started. "A thousand pardons. I have been longer here than
I meant—such charming company. Is it possible, do you think, that
I might have a lift to the village?"</p>

<p>He stepped out on to the drive, and signalled with his arm. The
luggage cart stopped, and after a word or two of explanation Lemoine
climbed in behind. He raised his hat politely to Virginia, and
drove off.</p>

<p>The other two stood and watched the cart disappearing with puzzled
expressions. Just as the cart swung round the bend, a suit-case
fell off into the drive. The cart went on.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Virginia to Bill. "We’re going to see something
interesting. That suit-case was thrown out."</p>

<p>"Nobody’s noticed it," said Bill.</p>

<p>They ran down the drive towards the fallen piece of luggage.
Just as they reached it, Lemoine came round the corner of the
bend on foot. He was hot from walking fast.</p>

<p>"I was obliged to descend," he said pleasantly. "I found that
I had left something behind."</p>

<p>"This?" said Bill, indicating the suit-case.</p>

<p>It was a handsome case of heavy pigskin, with the initials H.
I. on it.</p>

<p>"What a pity!" said Lemoine gently. "It must have fallen out.
Shall we lift it from the road?"</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, he picked up the suit-case, and
carried it over to the belt of trees. He stooped over it, something
flashed in his hand, and the lock slipped back.</p>

<p>He spoke, and his voice was totally different, quick and commanding.</p>

<p>"The car will be here in a minute," he said. "Is it in sight?"</p>

<p>Virginia looked back towards the house.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>With deft fingers he tossed the things out of the suit-case.
Gold-topped bottle, silk pyjamas, a variety of socks. Suddenly
his whole figure stiffened. He caught up what appeared to be a
bundle of silk underwear, and unrolled it rapidly.</p>

<p>A slight exclamation broke from Bill. In the centre of the bundle
was a heavy revolver.</p>

<p>"I hear the horn," said Virginia.</p>

<p>Like lightning, Lemoine repacked the suit-case. The revolver
he wrapped in a silk handkerchief of his own, and slipped into
his pocket. He snapped the locks of the suit-case, and turned
quickly to Bill.</p>

<p>"Take it. Madame will be with you. Stop the car, and explain
that it fell off the luggage cart. Do not mention me."</p>

<p>Bill stepped quickly down to the drive just as the big Lanchester
limousine with Isaacstein inside it came round the corner. The
chauffeur slowed down, and Bill swung the suit-case up to him.</p>

<p>"Fell off the luggage cart," he explained. "We happened to see
it."</p>

<p>He caught a momentary glimpse of a startled yellow face as the
financier stared at him, and then the car swept on again.</p>

<p>They went back to Lemoine. He was standing with the revolver
in his hand, and a look of gloating satisfaction in his face.</p>

<p>"A long shot," he said. "A very long shot. But it came off."</p>
