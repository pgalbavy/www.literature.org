<p>"You have saved our lives," exclaimed Lieutenant Canfield, as
the dusky form of the Huron appeared beside him.</p>

<p>"Ain't hurt, eh? den we go," said he, not noticing the remark.</p>

<p>"No, neither of us is hurt."</p>

<p>"I beliebes a bullet struck me aside de head," said Cato, removing
his cap, and scratching his black poll.</p>

<p>"A bullet struck you?" repeated the Lieutenant, in astonishment.
"Where did it hit you?"</p>

<p>"When dat gun went off, sunkin' struck me slap right above my
ear, and I fought I felt it flatten dar."</p>

<p>"Fudge! you are not hurt.  But I say, Oonomoo," resumed the soldier,
with a more determined air, "you have saved me, and I want to
grasp your hand for it."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "You have saved me, and I want to grasp your hand
for it."]</p>

<p>The Huron extended his hand, but it hung limp in that of the
ardent young man.  It was easy to see that the iterated thanks
were distasteful to him.  He said nothing until the jubilant Cato
also made a spring at it as soon as it was released.</p>

<p>"Nebber mind&mdash;nottin' &mdash;Oonomoo do nottin'."</p>

<p>"Hebens, golly! yes, you did.  If you hadn't come jes' as you
did, I'd had to fout de Injines all alone, single-handed, widout
any feller to help me, and, like as not, would've got hurt."</p>

<p>"Can't hurt Cato's head&mdash;hard," said the Huron, dropping his
hand upon the superabundant wool of the negro, and allowing it
to bound up as if an elastic cushion were beneath it.  "Make nice
scalp &mdash;Shawnee like it," added the Indian, still toying
with it.</p>

<p>"De Lord bless me!  I hopes he nebber will get it, and he nebber
will if I can hender dem."</p>

<p>It was now quite dark, and, to the surprise of the Lieutenant,
a round, full, bright moon appeared above the forest.  The preceding
night had been without a moon to light up the cloudy heavens;
but there was scarcely a cloud visible now in the sky.  Here and
there a small fleck floated overhead, like a handful of snow cast
there by some giant, while not a breath of wind disturbed the
tree-tops.  All was silent and gloomy as the tomb.</p>

<p>"When are we to go to the Shawnee village?" asked the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Now!" replied the Huron.</p>

<p>"Then why do you linger?"</p>

<p>"Cato go with us?"</p>

<p>"That is just as you say, Oonomoo.  If you think it imprudent
to take him along, he must remain behind."</p>

<p>"You ain't agoin' to leab me here, be you?"</p>

<p>"Know de way to settlement?" asked the Huron.</p>

<p>"No, no; I (recollecting what he had told the Lieutenant) did
know de way once, but, I's afraid I've forgot it.  My mem'ry is
gittin' poor."</p>

<p>"You find de way&mdash;must go&mdash;can't stay wid us."</p>

<p>"Oh, gorry! don't leab me among de Injines; dey will eat me up
alive!" replied the negro, bellowing like a bull.</p>

<p>Canfield saw the glitter of the Huron's eyes, and taking Cato
by the arm, said:</p>

<p>"Let us hear no more of this, Cato, or you will arouse the anger
of Oonomoo, and there is no telling what he may do."</p>

<p>"But, I's afraid to go t'rough de dark woods, dat am full of
de Shawnees," said the negro, in pitiful accents.</p>

<p>"It will be no more dangerous than to go with us.  We shall probably
find ourselves right among them before long; while, if you are
cautious, there is little probability of your encountering them. 
Go, Cato, and tell Mrs. Prescott and Helen what has happened,
but do not exaggerate it.  Tell them, for me, that they can hope
for the best, and that they shall soon hear from Oonomoo and myself."</p>

<p>The words of the Lieutenant had the desired effect upon the negro.
When he saw that he had but a choice between two dangers, he prudently
took that which seemed to be the least, replying that, "all t'ings
'sidered, 'twould be 'bout as well to tote off to de settlement,
and guv de news to de folks dar."  He added that he was not influenced
by "pussonal fear, but was simply actin' on de advice ob de Leftenant."</p>

<p>Accordingly, Cato took his departure.  Our two friends watched
him as he shuffled across the clearing, and finally disappeared
in the shadowy wood beyond.</p>

<p>Then the Huron turned to the duty before him.  Taking a northerly
direction, he proceeded at such a rapid walk that the young soldier
was compelled every now and then to run a few steps to maintain
his place beside him.  He kept up his pace for a half-hour or
so, when he suddenly halted.</p>

<p>"Fast walk&mdash;make breathe fast," said he, his black eye sparkling.</p>

<p>"It is rather rapid walking, Oonomoo, but I can stand it.  Don't
stop on my account."</p>

<p>"Plenty time&mdash;git dar mornin'&mdash;soon enough."</p>

<p>"How far are we from the Shawnee village?"</p>

<p>"Two&mdash;eight&mdash;dozen miles&mdash;go in canoe part way."</p>

<p>"When will we rescue her from the dogs&mdash;the Shawnees?" asked
the young Lieutenant, scarcely able to restrain his curiosity.</p>

<p>"Dunno&mdash;may be can't get her 't all."</p>

<p>"Won't get her?" he repeated, his heart throbbing painfully. 
"My God, Oonomoo, why do you say that?"</p>

<p>"'Cause true&mdash;hain't got her yit&mdash;may be won't &mdash;Shawnee
watch close&mdash;t'ink Oonomoo 'bout."</p>

<p>"But you <em>expect</em> to rescue her, do you not?"</p>

<p>"Yeh, 'spect to&mdash;do all can&mdash;ain't sartin&mdash;mustn't t'ink I am&mdash;be
ready for her dead."</p>

<p>"I will try to be prepared for the worst, Oonomoo, but I place
great hopes on you."</p>

<p>"Place hopes on Him &mdash;He do it, may be."</p>

<p>Never, to his dying day, did Lieutenant Canfield forget the rebuke
of that Huron Indian.  As he uttered these words he pointed upward&mdash;a
flood of moonlight, streaming down through the trees upon his
upturned face, rested like a halo of glory upon his bronzed brow. 
Years afterward, when Oonomoo had been gathered to his fathers,
and Lieutenant Canfield was an old man, he asserted that he could
hear those words as distinctly, and see that reverential expression
as plainly as upon that memorable night.</p>

<p>"You are right, Oonomoo."  said the Lieutenant, "and I feel the
reproof you have given me.  The merciful God is the only one upon
whom we can rely, and under Him it is upon your sagacity and skill
that I depend."</p>

<p>"Dat so&mdash;we go purty soon."</p>

<p>After resting a half-hour, the two moved forward at a much slower
rate than before.  As the moon ascended, its light was so clear
and unobstructed that in the open spots in the woods he could
easily have read a printed page.  For a night of reconnoitering
and action it possessed all the advantages and disadvantages of
a clear day.  The Huron almost invariably held his peace when
walking, and the young soldier did not attempt to disturb him
upon the present occasion.  From his remarks, he gathered that
it was his wish to reach the neighborhood of the Shawnee village
in a few hours, and wait until daylight before attempting to accomplish
anything.  To carry out his intentions, it was necessary, in the
first place, to see Hans Vanderbum, and secure his cooperation. 
Fully aware of his astonishing sleeping qualities, the Huron knew
he might as well try to wake a dead man as to secure an interview
with him during the night.</p>

<p>An hour later the bank of the Miami was reached.  As they stood
on the shore and looked down-stream, its clear surface, glistening
brightly in the moonlight, could be seen as plainly as at noonday,
until it disappeared from sight in a sweeping bend.  From their
stand-point it resembled a lake more than a river, the woods,
apparently, shutting down in such a manner as to hide it entirely. 
Not a ripple was heard along the shore, and only once a zephyr
hurried over its bosom, crinkling the surface as it passed, and
rustling the tops of a few trees along the bank as it went on
and was lost in the wood beyond. The great wilderness, on every
hand, stretched miles and miles away, until it was lost afar,
like a sea of gloom, in the sky.  Once a night-bird rushed whirring
past, so startlingly close, that the Lieutenant felt a cold chill
run over him as its wings fanned his face. It shot off like a
bullet directly across the river, and could be distinguished for
several minutes, its body resembling a black ball, until it faded
out from view.  Nothing else disturbed the solemn stillness that
held reign.  Everything wore the spirit of quietness and repose.</p>

<p>The soldier was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"Isn't this an impressive sight, Oonomoo?"</p>

<p>"Yeh&mdash;make think of Great Spirit."</p>

<p>"That is true.  You seem to be more than usually solemn in your
reflections, my good friend, and I am glad to see it.  This calm
moonlight night, the clear sky and the deep, silent wood, is enough
to make any person thoughtful; but it must have required something
more than ordinary to impress you thus."</p>

<p>"Saw Fluellina to-day, Oonomoo's wife."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Canfield was considerably puzzled to understand how
this could account for the peculiar frame of the Huron's mind,
but he had too much consideration to question him further.  It
was not until he spoke again, that he gained a clear idea of his
meaning.</p>

<p>"Fluellina Christian&mdash;got Bible&mdash;tell 'bout God &mdash;Great
Spirit up dere&mdash;read out of it&mdash;tell Oonomoo 'bout t'ings in it
&mdash;Oonomoo nebber take anodder scalp."</p>

<p>"A wise determination; such a brave man as you needs no <em>proof</em>
of your bravery, and that good Being which your Fluellina has
told you about will smile upon your noble conduct."</p>

<p>"Know dat&mdash;<em>feel</em> it," added the Huron, eagerly.  He stood
a moment longer, and then added, "Time dat we go."</p>

<p>"You spoke of going part way in a canoe, but I do not see any
for us."</p>

<p>"Down yonder, by dat rock."</p>

<p>The Indian pointed down the river as he spoke, and, following
the direction of his finger, Lieutenant Canfield distinguished
a large rock projecting some distance from the shore, but could
distinguish nothing of the canoe of which he spoke.  Knowing,
however, that it must be concealed somewhere in the vicinity,
he remarked, as they withdrew again into the wood:</p>

<p>"How is it, Oonomoo, that you have your canoe in every part of
the country?  You must be the owner of quite a fleet."</p>

<p>"Got two&mdash;free&mdash;twenty&mdash;more'n dat&mdash;all ober&mdash;in Big Miami &mdash;Little
Miami&mdash;all 'long Ohio&mdash;Soty (Sciota)&mdash;Hocking &mdash;Mussygum
(Muskingum)&mdash;'way out 'long de Wabash&mdash;hid all ober&mdash;got 'em eberywhere."</p>

<p>"And I suppose you find occasion to use them all?"</p>

<p>"Use 'em all.  Out on Wabash last winter&mdash;snow deep&mdash;two days
in de snow&mdash;paddlin' on de ribber&mdash;hab 'em hid 'long de shore&mdash;sometime
lose 'em."</p>

<p>"How did you get them in these different places?  Carry them
there yourself?"</p>

<p>"Made 'em&mdash;knowed want use 'em&mdash;made 'em and hid 'em."</p>

<p>The young soldier was about to speak, when the Huron motioned
for him to maintain his peace.  The conversation had been carried
on in so low tones that a third party, a rod distant, could not
have overheard their words.  Before the Indian spoke, he had glanced
around to satisfy himself that it was impossible for a human being
to be concealed within that area.</p>

<p>Now, however, he was about to change his position, and the strictest
silence was necessary.</p>

<p>The two passed down through the woods, and were just emerging
again upon the bank, when the Huron, who was in front, suddenly
started back, so quickly and lightly that the Lieutenant did not
understand his movement till he saw their relative change of position.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" he asked, in a whisper.</p>

<p>"'Sh!  Shawnees dere."</p>

<p>"Where? on the rock?"</p>

<p>The Huron pointed across the river.</p>

<p>"Dere! on dat shore&mdash;may be come over."</p>

<p>The soldier, was much puzzled to know how his companion had made
such a sudden discovery, when they were so far away.  As there
could be no danger of their words being overheard, he made the
inquiry.</p>

<p>"See'd water splash," replied Oonomoo.  "Got canoe."</p>

<p>"Not yours?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;deir own&mdash;come ober here, putty soon."</p>

<p>His words were true.  He had hardly spoken, when a noise, as
of the dipping of a paddle, was heard, and the next moment a canoe
shot out from the bank and headed directly toward them.  This
being the case, it was impossible to determine the number of savages
in it, although there must have been several.</p>

<p>"Would it not be best to move to prevent discovery?" asked the
Lieutenant, as he watched the approaching Shawnees with considerable
anxiety.</p>

<p>"Won't land here&mdash;go 'low us."</p>

<p>A moment later the head of the canoe turned down-stream.  It
was then seen to be of considerable size.  Five savages were seated
within it. Oonomoo bent his head, took one earnest glance at them,
and then said:</p>

<p>"Ain't Shawnees &mdash;Miamis."</p>

<p>"Friends or foes?"</p>

<p>"Jes' as bad&mdash;take scalp&mdash;kill white people&mdash;take your scalp&mdash;see
you."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Canfield by no means felt at ease at the indifference
with which his friend uttered these words.  It certainly was no
pleasant prospect&mdash;that of having these bloodthirsty Miamis for
such near neighbors, and he expressed as much to Oonomoo.</p>

<p>"Won't come here&mdash;keep quiet&mdash;won't git hurt," replied the imperturbable
Huron.</p>

<p>Considerably relieved at this assurance, he said no more, but
watched the canoe.  To his astonishment and dismay it again changed
its course, and headed directly toward the rock in front of them. 
He looked at his companion, but his face was as immovable as a
statue's and, determined not to show any childish fear, he maintained
his place and said no more.</p>

<p>Reaching the outer end of the rock, the Miamis halted for a moment
or two, when they turned down the river again, and landed about
a hundred yards below where our two friends were standing.  The
latter waited for full half an hour, when, seeing and hearing
nothing more of them, the Huron resolved to obtain his canoe,
and continue their journey down the river.</p>

<p>"But where is it?" asked the soldier, when he announced his intention.</p>

<p>"Fastened out end of rock."</p>

<p>"May be the Miamis discovered it and have destroyed it."</p>

<p>"Dunno&mdash;meb' so&mdash;didn't take him 'way, dough."</p>

<p>"Is the water very deep?"</p>

<p>"Two&mdash;t'ree&mdash;twenty feet&mdash;swim dere."</p>

<p>As it seemed impossible to run even the most ordinary risk, the
Lieutenant felt no apprehension at all when he saw him walk down
to the water without his rifle, and wade out and commence swimming. 
The moon, as we have said, was unusually bright, and not only
the dark, ball-like head of the Huron could be seen, floating
on the surface, but, when his face was turned in the right direction,
his black eyes and aquiline nose and high cheek-bones were plainly
distinguishable, while his long, black hair, simply closed in
one clasp (years before it was always gathered in the defiant
scalp-lock), floated like a veil behind him. The soldier watched
him until he disappeared around the corner of the rock, and then
patiently awaited his return.</p>

<p>The Huron was a most consummate swimmer, and moved, while in
the water, as silently as a fish.  More from habit than anything
else, as he found himself in the eddy made by the twisting of
the river around the upper edge of the stone, he "backed water,"
and, for a moment, remained perfectly motionless.  The moon was
in such a quarter of the sky that a long line of shadow was thrown
out from the rock, far enough to envelop both Oonomoo and his
canoe, lying several yards below him.  As he caught sight of the
latter, he saw a Miami Indian seated in it, apparently waiting
and watching for some one.  As quick as lightning the meaning
of the singular action of the other canoe flashed upon his mind. 
By some means which he could only conjecture, the Miamis had gained
a knowledge of his movements.  Perhaps the discovery of his boat
was what first awakened their suspicions.  At any rate, they had
learned enough to satisfy themselves that a rich prize was within
their grasp.  Leaving one of their number in the strange canoe,
they had passed on down-stream, concealing the absence of their
comrade with such skill, that the watchful eye of the Huron failed
to detect it. Beyond a doubt they were lingering in the vicinity,
ready to come to his assistance at the first signal.</p>

<p>The instructions of the warrior who remained behind were to shoot
the savage at the moment of his appearance, and, in case he had
a companion, to put out in the stream at once and call to his
friends, who would immediately come to him.  A brief glance at
the situation of the Miami will show that his task was one of
no ordinary peril, especially if the returning Indian should have
any apprehension of danger.  If he chose, the latter could swim
out to the rock, and walk over its surface to its outer edge,
when he would be directly above the Miami, and could brain him
with his tomahawk in an instant.  As the physical exertion thus
incurred would be greater than the simple act of swimming out
to the canoe, it was not likely such a thing would take place,
unless, as we have said, the suspicions of the approaching savage
be aroused.  The probability was that the latter would take precisely
the same course that we have seen the Huron take, that is, if
he believed the coast clear; but as there was no certainty of
this, the Miami was compelled to keep watch both up-stream and
down-stream, and it was thus it happened that his back was turned
to Oonomoo at the very moment he came around the edge of the rock.</p>

<p>The different methods by which the Miami could be disposed of
occurred to the Huron with electric quickness.  To the first&mdash;that
of passing over the rock and tomahawking him, there was one objection
so important as to make it a fatal one.  In the bright moonlight,
he would offer too fine a target to the other Miamis concealed
along the bank.  Without the responsibility of his white friend's
safety, Oonomoo felt it would be hardly short of suicide, for
it would be affording his deadliest enemies the opportunity of
capturing or killing him as they preferred. He had but the choice
of two plans: that of pressing forward and engaging the Miami,
or of instantly returning to the shore, and proceeding to the
Shawnee village by land.  He chose the former.</p>

<p>Everything depended now upon the quickness of the Huron's movements.
The Miami being compelled to watch both directions, it was certain
he would turn his head in a moment, when, if Oonomoo was still
in the water, his fate would be pretty certain.  Accordingly he
shot rapidly forward, and was so close when he halted, that, do
his utmost, he could not prevent his head from striking the prow
of the canoe.  Slight as was the shock, it did not escape the
notice of the Miami, who instantly turned his head, and approaching
the prow, leaned over and looked in the water.</p>

<p>The Huron had been expecting this movement, and to guard against
its consequences, sunk quietly beneath the surface, and allowed
the current to carry him just the length of the canoe, when he
again rose, with his head beneath its stem.  Resting here a moment,
with his nose and eyes just in sight, he commenced drifting down-stream,
inch by inch, until he caught a glimpse of the Miami's head over
the edge of the canoe when he returned to his former position
under the stern and gathered his energies for the struggle.</p>

<p>Sustaining himself by his feet alone, he reached his hands upward,
grasped the canoe in such a manner that it was firmly held on
each side.  Holding it thus only long enough to make his hold
sure, he pressed the stern quickly downward, and then by a sudden
wrench threw the Miami upon his back in the water.  Letting go
his hold, the Huron made a dash at him, and closing in the deadly
embrace, the two went down&mdash;down&mdash;down&mdash;till their feet struck
the soft bottom, when they shot up again like two corks.</p>

<p>Imminent as was the peril of Oonomoo, his greatest fear was that
their struggles would carry them below the rock, where the moonlight
would discover them to the Miamis on the bank.  With a skill as
wonderful as it was rare even among his own people, he <em>regulated</em>
his movements while submerged, in such a manner that they operated
to carry both combatants <em>up</em>-stream, had there been no
current, so that when they came to the surface, it was very nearly
in the same spot that they had gone down.</p>

<p>But Oonomoo and the Miami had whipped out their knives, and they
raised them aloft at the same instant.  But neither descended. 
They were still in the air, when the one spoke the simple word. 
"Heigon!" and the other simultaneously with him uttered the name
of "Oonomoo," and the hands of both dropped beside them.  Without
speaking, the Miami grasped the edge of the rock and clambered
to the surface, and beckoned for the Huron to follow; but the
latter held back, and whispered, in the tongue of his companion:</p>

<p>"Miamis on shore wait to make Oonomoo a prisoner."</p>

<p>"Oonomoo is the friend of Heigon, and the Miamis will not injure
him."</p>

<p>[Illustration: But Oonomoo and the Miami had whipped out their
knives.]</p>

<p>The Huron hesitated no longer, but the next moment stood beside
the Miami on the broad mass of stone.  Heigon gave a short peculiar
whoop, which was instantly followed by the appearance of the other
canoe with its four inmates, who impelled it forward with great
rapidity, and in almost a twinkling were also upon the rock. 
Each held a glittering knife in hand, and they gazed upon their
victim with exulting eyes, who stood firm, unmoved, and returned
their glances with as proud and defiant an air as a king would
have looked upon the vassals beneath him.  They were about to
proceed to violence, when Heigon simply said: "He is my friend." 
Instantly every knife was sheathed, and the gloating expression
of the Miamis changed to one of interest and pleasure.  They gathered
more closely around the Huron, and looked to their companion for
some further explanation.</p>

<p>"When the snow was upon the ground," said he, "Heigon was hunting,
and he became weak and feeble, like an old man, or the child that
cannot walk.[1]  The snow came down till it covered the rocks
like this, and Heigon grew weaker and feebler until he could walk
no further, and lay down in the snow to die.  When he was covered
over, and the Great Spirit was about to take him to himself, another
Indian came that way. He was Heigon's enemy, but he lifted him
to his feet and brushed the snow from his face and limbs and poured
his fire-water down his throat. He dug the snow away until he
came to the dry leaves, and then he kindled a fire to warm Heigon
by.  He stayed by him all night, and in the morning Heigon was
strong and a man again.  When he went away, he asked the Indian
his name.  It was Oonomoo, the Huron.  He stands by us, and is
now in our power."</p>

<p>The eyes of the Miamis fairly sparkled as they listened to this
narration of their comrade, and they looked upon the far-famed
Huron with feelings only of friendship and admiration.  He had
been considered for years as one of the deadliest enemies of the
Miamis, and his capture or death by them would have been an exploit
that would have descended through tradition to the last remnant
of their people.  Fully sensible of this, this same Huron had
come upon one of their most distinguished warriors when he was
as helpless as an infant, and could have been scalped by a mere
child.  But the magnanimous savage had acted the part of a good
Samaritan, feeding and warming him and sending him on his way
in the morning, refreshed and strengthened.  Such a deed as this
could never be forgotten, either by the recipient or those of
his tribe to whom it became known.</p>

<p>During the narrative the Huron stood with arms folded, and as
insensible to the praises of Heigon as if he had not uttered a
syllable since the advent of his companions.  He who appeared
to be the leading warrior now asked:</p>

<p>"Whither does my brother Huron wish to go?"</p>

<p>"To the Shawnee village on the shore of the Miami."</p>

<p>"We journey thither, and will take our brother with us."</p>

<p>"Oonomoo goes as the enemy of the Shawnees.  He goes to save
a pale-faced maiden who has fallen into their hands.  My Miami
brothers go as the friends of the Shawnees."</p>

<p>"They go as the friends of Oonomoo, who saved one of their warriors,
and they will carry him in their canoe."</p>

<p>"The feet of Oonomoo are like the deer's, and his eyes are as
the eagle's.  He can see his path at night in the wood, and can
journey from the rising until the setting sun without becoming
weary."</p>

<p>"We know our brother is brave and fleet of foot.  His Miami friends
will carry him far upon his journey, and when he wishes to go
through the woods, they will leave him upon the shore."</p>

<p>Oonomoo could not decline this kind offer.  Simply to show in
a small degree their friendship for him, the Miamis insisted upon
carrying him in their canoe as far as he wished, landing him upon
the bank whenever it was his desire that they should do so.  The
Miamis being allies of the Shawnees, and on their way to join
one of their war-parties, they could not (even on account of their
peculiar relations with the Huron) act as their enemies in any
way; consequently the Huron did not expect or ask their assistance. 
But while they were prevented from aiding him in the least, in
his attempt to rescue the captive, the claims which he had upon
their gratitude were such, that he well knew they would carefully
avoid throwing any obstacle in his way, and would act as neutrals
throughout the affair, believing, however, that it was not inconsistent
with such a profession to carry him even in sight of the Shawnee
village itself.  Beyond that it would be as if these five Miamis
were a thousand miles distant.</p>

<p>All this time, it may well be supposed, that Lieutenant Canfield
was no uninterested spectator of the interview between his Huron
friend and the Miamis.  When they made their appearance upon the
rock, he believed that Oonomoo had been captured.  He was about
to seek his own safety in flight, but he was struck by the apparently
good feeling of the conference.  Their words being in the Miami
tongue, he could not distinguish their meaning, but from their
sound, judged them to be friendly in their nature.  Still, there
could be no certainty, and he was in a torment of doubt, when
he was startled by hearing the Huron call his name.  At first
he determined not to answer, thinking his friend had been compelled
to betray him by his captors.  A moment's reflection, however,
convinced him that such could not be the case.</p>

<p>"Canfiel'!  Canfiel'!"</p>

<p>"What do you want, Oonomoo?"</p>

<p>"Go down bank&mdash;wait for us &mdash;Miami won't hurt."</p>

<p>The young soldier did as he requested, and the next moment saw
the two canoes put out from the rock.  In the first were the four
Miamis, and in the second Oonomoo and Heigon, the latter using
the paddle.  They touched a point on the shore about a hundred
yards down-stream, almost at the same moment that it was reached
by the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"How-de-do, brudder?" asked the foremost, extending his hand. 
The soldier exchanged similar greetings with the others, when
at a signal the five seated themselves upon the ground, and he
followed suit.  A pipe, the "calumet of peace," was produced and
passed from mouth to mouth, each one smoking slowly and solemnly
a few whiffs.</p>

<p>This tedious ceremony occupied fully a half-hour, during which
it was nearly impossible for the young Lieutenant to conceal his
impatience. It seemed to him nothing but a sheer waste of time,
and he wondered how Oonomoo could take it so composedly.  At length
the last smoker had taken what he evidently believed the proper
number of whiffs, and they arose and embarked again in their canoes.</p>

<p>In the boat, which really belonged to the Huron, were seated
himself, Lieutenant Canfield, and Heigon, who insisted upon using
the paddle himself.  For a moment they glided along under the
shadow of the wooded bank, and then, coming out on the clear,
moonlit surface of the river, they shot downstream like swallows
upon the wing.</p>

<p>It was not quite ten miles to the Shawnee town, and, as it was
now in the neighborhood of midnight, their destination would be
easily reached in time.</p>

<p>All went well for some four or five miles, when an exclamation
from the canoe in advance attracted the attention of Oonomoo and
the soldier.</p>

<p>"What is it?" inquired the latter.</p>

<p>"Ugh! nudder canoe comin' &mdash;Shawnees."</p>

<p>Such proved to be the case.  A large war-canoe, containing over
a score of painted warriors, was coming up the river, nearly in
the center of the stream, while the Miamis were nearer the right
bank.  When nearly opposite each other, the war-canoe paused while
that which contained the four Miamis went over to it, somewhat
after the manner that two friendly ships come to anchor in the
midst of the ocean, and exchange congratulations and news.</p>

<p>During the interview, Heigon prudently kept at a safe distance,
but from the gesticulations and words of the Shawnees it was evident
they were making inquiries in regard to the inmates of his boat. 
The replies proved satisfactory, for a moment later, the canoes
separated, and each party proceeded on his way.  Little did the
Shawnees dream that the very foe for whom they were searching&mdash;he
whose scalp was worth that of a hundred warriors, whose death
they would have nearly given their own life to secure&mdash;little
did they dream, we say, that this very man was within a few rods
of them&mdash;so close that he recognized the features of every one
of their number!</p>

<p>Several miles further, and Oonomoo spoke to Heigon.  They were
now in the vicinity of the Shawnee village, and he wished to land. 
Heigon instantly turned the prow of his canoe toward shore, and
the others, understanding the cause, followed.  A moment later,
Lieutenant Canfield and the Huron stood upon <em>terra firma</em>. 
They were compelled again to shake hands all around with their
curiously-made friends, when they separated&mdash;the latter to go
down the river as brothers to the warlike Shawnees, and the former
to go to the same destination as their deadly enemies!</p>
