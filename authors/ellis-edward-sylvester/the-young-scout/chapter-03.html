<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The selection of a candidate by competitive examination for the
United States Military Academy at West Point has not the slightest
effect upon his admission to that institution. When he knocks
at the door he stands precisely upon the same footing as if he
were a country lad from the backwoods of Illinois or the plains
of one of the territories. His selection simply carries with it
the probability that he is the best qualified of the numerous
youths living in his congressional district who are seeking the
appointment.</p>

<p>James Decker joined the little multitude that were put through
the severe ordeal which awaits every candidate who has a chance
of becoming an officer of the United States army by means of the
best military institution in the world. He was hopeful but anxious,
as is every young man. The first damper he received was when two
other lads, who seemed to be fine specimens of young American
manhood, and were his companions in the preliminary efforts were
rejected. One was from California and broke down on the mental
test. The other was a tall, stoop-shouldered youth from Kentucky,
who was declared physically deficient.</p>

<p>The ordeal through which James passed brought out the cold perspiration
all over his body. He was literally tested from the crown of his
head to the soles of his feet. When the medical board found no
physical defect, he was set to work answering questions relating
to his scholarship. This occupied three days, and when completed,
the great burden was lifted from his shoulders, by the notice
that he had passed successfully and was a plebe.</p>

<p>This was the opening of a most trying experience. Hazing is reduced
to the minimum at West Point, but enough of it remains to test
the spirits of a proud boy. The plebes have to play the part,
more or less, of servants to the upper classmen, who are sometimes
so oppressive that the young cadet rebels. He is foolish to do
so, but occasionally it is inevitable. James was on the point
more than once of challenging his persecutor to a bout at arms,
but he gained a great victory over himself by passing through
the first year without anything of the kind.</p>

<p>The collision came during his second year and was settled one
bright morning in spring, by a battle near the ruins of old Fort
Putnam, in the presence of some twenty members of the different
classes who were in the secret. Young Decker’s opponent had made
himself unbearably obnoxious, and when he was utterly and overwhelmingly
defeated, many of his own classmates were glad of it. The violation
of the rules did not reach the authorities, and Cadet Decker was
involved in nothing more of the kind during the four years spent
at the institution.</p>

<p>Young Decker maintained a high grade of scholarship throughout
his course. Once he stood second in his class, but dropped slightly,
and when he was graduated his standing was five. This entitled
him to enter the corps of engineers, or to take his choice of
the branches below that.</p>

<p>"The cavalry is the arm of the service that suits me," he said
to his roommate, who was from Alabama.</p>

<p>"It isn’t half so good as the engineers or artillery," remarked
his friend, who expected to be assigned to the latter. "I look
upon the engineers as the real, ornamental branch of the service."</p>

<p>"And that’s the reason I want none of it," replied Decker; "I
am going into the army to make a record and win promotion."</p>

<p>"The engineers have a good thing; you are sure to be assigned
to one of the large cities on the sea-coast or to Washington,
where you have plenty of society and many social privileges, with
little hard work."</p>

<p>"Promotion is slow in the artillery; the only chance is a foreign
war, and I don’t see any prospect of that. The Indian troubles
in the Southwest give the cavalry plenty to do. Geronimo and the
rest are making things lively, and whoever goes down there won’t
be allowed to rust to death."</p>

<p>"No," smiled his friend, "it will be a poisoned arrow or a rifle
bullet or scalping knife. Then the climate is something like that
of hades."</p>

<p>"All that may be as you say, but after an experience of a few
years there a fellow will be able to appreciate the soft snaps
elsewhere."</p>

<p>"But some of those posts in Arizona and New Mexico," persisted
his classmate, "are enough to drive a fellow wild. A cousin of
mine, now a captain of cavalry, told me that the years he spent
at Fort Grant were such that he would not go through again for
the biggest fortune in the world. The hot sun, the daily parade
and grind, the same old round of duty day in and out for weeks,
months and years in that confounded climate were enough to drive
a person crazy."</p>

<p>"Didn’t he have any campaigning?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it; everything was as calm as a mill pond."</p>

<p>"That’s the difference; it would be the last place I would go,
if it were not for the prospect of something in the way of fighting.
I have been studying matters and making inquiries, and there is
reason to hope that things will hum in the Southwest before you
and I have time to grow our mustaches."</p>

<p>"Well, Decker, you are welcome to it; give me the artillery."</p>

<p>So it came about in the natural order of things that Second-Lieutenant
Decker was assigned to Fort Reno in Arizona. Full of ambition
and hope, he bade his friends good-by and made the long journey
to that section, his spirits unaffected by the flaming weather
and the desolate appearance of the half civilized region through
which he was compelled to pass, a portion by stage and much by
horseback.</p>

<p>The letter which Lieutenant Decker wrote to his old classmate,
who had a pleasant berth at Washington, was not precisely what
he expected to write when bidding him farewell.</p>

<p>"But for the prospect of active service," he said, "I would agree
with many of my old friends, including yourself, that I made a
great mistake. This is one of the most frightful regions of our
glorious country. If it was not that the atmosphere is dry no
one could stand it. Human beings would be driven out as from Sahara,
but no one knows what he can undergo until he makes the experiment.
Trouble is certain to come with the Apaches and I am as confident
as ever that if I can bring my scalp out of the flurry I shall
win promotion, which you know is the dream of all of us."</p>

<p>Having located the brave young lieutenant in his new quarters,
with his dreams of glory, some attention must now be given to
others with whose fortunes he became closely identified before
he had spent a year at Fort Reno in Arizona.</p>

<p>Maurice Freeman was a veteran of the Southern Confederacy, who
had moved into the section nearly two years before Lieutenant
Decker was assigned to that post. His family consisted of his
wife Molly, his little boy Fulton and a girl Fannie. It was on
a pleasant day in winter, when the climate in that region is delightful,
that Freeman set out to ride to Fort Reno, ten miles distant from
his ranch.</p>

<p>The ranchman was accustomed to make periodical visits to the
military post, where he had a pleasant acquaintance with the officers
and received a cordial welcome and courteous treatment. There
were many little articles which he could obtain there that were
useful to his family and which, therefore, rendered unnecessary,
except at distant intervals, his journeys to Prescott, Phœnix,
Tombstone and the other comparatively large towns.</p>

<p>Freeman was riding at a brisk pace, for his animal was excellent
and the weather favorable. Ascending a gentle slope, some distance
from Salt River, a tributary of the Gila, he checked his pony
and looked off over the broad stretch of country spread out before
him, with a winding branch of the Gila showing at varying distances
across the undulating plain.</p>

<p>But the scene was so familiar that it excited little interest
and he had not paused to admire it; he was looking for friends
or enemies, as the case might prove to be.</p>

<p>His scrutiny of the sandy expanse was not in vain, for the first
sweeping glance revealed three horsemen to the northwest, all
galloping at a swift pace, and heading toward him.</p>

<p>"Who can they be?" he asked himself, shading his eyes with his
hand and peering intently in that direction. "If I had a glass,
I could make them out, but they will soon disclose themselves,
for they seem to be in a hurry."</p>

<p>It was early in the afternoon, and since nothing was to be gained
by remaining where he was, the ranchman spoke to his horse, which
instantly broke into an easy, swinging pace toward the others,
who were studying the single man as closely as he was trying to
make them out.</p>

<p>"Just what I expected," exclaimed Freeman; "it’s Lieutenant Decker
from the fort, and he has Mendez and Cemuri with him. Decker would
rather fight than eat, and if I’m not mistaken he will have enough
of it before he sees much service in this part of the world. Geronimo
has been quiet so long that it’s time he was heard of again, and
when the old fellow moves the fur will fly."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decker, as might be supposed, was fond of scouting
through the country, as his superiors permitted, and when rumors
came to the post that the Apaches were becoming restless once
more he was reckless enough to declare that he hoped the news
would prove true.</p>

<p>"I don’t know anything more irksome," he was wont to repeat,
"than to be stationed at one of these posts, with nothing going
on but the same monotonous drill and parade, day after day, week
after week, and through the months from one year’s end to the
other. If Geronimo will stir up things, I’ll do my part to keep
them going."</p>

<p>Mendez and Cemuri, both of whom were in middle life, were among
the very best scouts that had served under Generals Crook and
Miles. They were White Mountain Apaches, whose loyalty was never
under a cloud. They had given invaluable help in more than one
critical emergency, and, esteemed as they were by our officers
and soldiers, they were intensely hated by their own people, who
when forced to cease their hostilities, were sullen, ugly, revengeful,
and given to brooding over their wrongs.</p>

<p>What more natural than that while hating the white race, they
should regard with unspeakable detestation those of their own
people who had aided that race in conquering them? Mendez and
Cemuri knew that they took their lives in their hands, when they
helped the white men to hunt down the Apache desperadoes, a score
of whom were enough to throw the settlements, over an area of
hundreds of miles, into consternation and terror.</p>

<p>The fact that Lieutenant Decker and these two friendly scouts
were riding thus far from Fort Reno, was evidence that they were
out on the same duty that had taken them scores of miles, many
a time within the past weeks.</p>

<p>The young man made a military salute as he recognized Captain
Freeman, and all four drew down their horses to a walk and quickly
came to a standstill. The lieutenant’s white teeth shone under
his dark mustache as he smiled, and, looking at the oval face,
much bronzed under the Arizona sun, the clear bright eyes, the
slightly aquiline nose and the fine figure, Captain Freeman thought
he was the handsomest young officer he had ever met.</p>

<p>Mendez and Cemuri remained a few paces in the background, as
the two white men halted with their knees almost touching each
other. The Apaches had nothing to say unless appealed to, but
were always ready for action, when called upon.</p>

<p>"On another scout, lieutenant?" was the inquiring remark of Freeman.</p>

<p>"Yes; we have been off toward the Gila; these fellows say that
Geronimo and about twenty of his band have been there within the
past three days, but we didn’t get a glimpse of them. I’m afraid
it’s a false alarm."</p>

<p>"You’re <em>afraid</em> it is! Don’t you hope so?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied the young officer, removing his cap and drawing
his handkerchief over his forehead, "I suppose I ought to feel
that way, for the worst devils with copper skins are those that
bear the name of Apache, but when you have to fight it’s a pleasure
to know that you are not fighting ninnies and lambs."</p>

<p>"But no pleasure, as I view it, to fight savages, who violate
every rule of civilized warfare, who are more cruel than death
itself, treacherous, fierce, relentless and merciless to men,
women and children. Lieutenant," added Freeman gravely, "I must
say that while I believe you are a brave young man, I don’t like
the hope you show that those miscreants should break loose again.
I surrendered with Lee at Appomattox and was all through the war.
I was wounded and saw hundreds killed, but I would rather go into
a battle like the Wilderness or Gettysburg or Antietam than know
that a single band of hostile Apaches were raiding through this
section. When the North and South fought, each knew the bravery
and chivalry of the other, and we never hit a foe when he was
down. Here we are fighting rattlesnakes."</p>

<p>"Well, captain, I often felt sorry that I wasn’t born twenty
years sooner, or that you had waited that long before opening
on Fort Sumter, but the unpleasantness between the sections is
over; promotion is slow, and unless we can have something to stir
us up, there’s no saying how long I shall have to wait for my
first lieutenancy or captaincy, to say nothing of the eagles of
the colonelcy far, far beyond."</p>

<p>"Your talk shows that you are young," said Freeman, who, despite
the reproof in his voice, could not help admiring the manly youth
of whom he was very fond; "five or ten years from now your sentiments
will be more in accord with mine."</p>

<p>"I can’t deny that your strictures are just; you have a wife
and two children——"</p>

<p>"And there are many others with similar ties; some had them once,
but have them no longer; you know the cause."</p>

<p>"Of course, and therefore I am the more anxious to get at those
miscreants. So long as they can range up and down the country,
burning, shooting and killing without receiving punishment therefor,
so long will they keep it up; but, captain, the thing has got
to end some time, and the sooner the final struggle begins the
sooner will it terminate."</p>

<p>"There’s a big field for discussion, which it isn’t worth while
for us to enter; but sometimes I wonder whether, if the right
course had been pursued, this trouble would not have ended long
ago."</p>

<p>"Of course it would," broke in the lieutenant with some heat;
"if the management of the Indians had been left to the army, there
would have been mighty little fighting, for the redskins would
have been treated honestly, and that’s all they ask. It’s the
Indian ring at Washington that raises the mischief; they’re continually
poking their nose into our affairs, and when Crook or Miles gets
everything running smoothly, those scoundrels arrange for a big
swindle and divvy."</p>

<p>The lieutenant looked round at the stolid faces of the two dusky
scouts, as if to learn whether they were listening.</p>

<p>"I don’t think there’s any danger of their reporting me, but
I wish we could have the whole gang of plunderers right here and
put them in front, when we start on a chase after Geronimo and
his hostiles."</p>

<p>"It would be a mighty good thing if you could," assented Freeman,
who had seen much of the frightful mismanagement of Indian affairs;
"but it is as it was during the civil war: the men who yell the
loudest for a fight are those who stay at home. No fear of any
one of them showing himself within reach of a hostile. However
we have got to take things as they are. We are confronted by a
condition, not a theory. We are in danger from the worst warriors
that ever scalped a woman or dashed out the brains of a baby.
If the Apaches are likely to make a raid through this section,
I must look after my family, who are peculiarly exposed, as is
the family of Captain Murray."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the lieutenant thoughtfully, "you and he are neighbors,
and both of your homes are in great peril—halloo!" he added looking
around; "Mendez seems to have discovered something."</p>
