<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>This double murder, following upon a series of tragic incidents all of
which were closely connected, was the climax to such an accumulation of
horrors and of shocking disasters that the two young men did not utter a
word or stir a limb. Death, whose breath they had already felt so often
on the battlefield, had never appeared to them under a more hateful or
forbidding guise.
</p><p>Death! They beheld it, not as an insidious disease that strikes at
hazard, but as a specter creeping in the shadow, watching its adversary,
choosing its moment and raising its arm with deliberate intention. And
this specter bore for them the very shape and features of Major Hermann.
</p><p>When Paul spoke at last, his voice had the dull, scared tone that seems
to summon up the evil powers of darkness:
</p><p>"He came last night. He came and, as we had written our names on the
wall, the names of Bernard d'Andeville and Paul Delroze which represent
the names of two enemies in his eyes, he took the opportunity to rid
himself of those two enemies. Persuaded that it was you and I who were
sleeping in this room, he struck . . . and those whom he struck were
poor Gériflour and his friend, who have died in our stead."
</p><p>After a long pause, he whispered:
</p><p>"They have died as my father died . . . and as Élisabeth died . . . and
the keeper also and his wife; and by the same hand, by the same hand,
Bernard, do you understand? . . . Yes, it's inadmissible, is it not? My
brain refuses to admit it. . . . And yet it is always the same hand that
holds the dagger . . . then and now."
</p><p>Bernard examined the dagger. At the sight of the four letters, he said:
</p><p>"That stands for Hermann, I suppose? Major Hermann?"
</p><p>"Yes," said Paul, eagerly. "Is it his real name, though? And who is he
actually? I don't know. But what I do know is that the criminal who
committed all those murders is the same who signs with these four
letters, H, E, R, M."
</p><p>After giving the alarm to the men of his section and sending to inform
the chaplain and the surgeons, Paul resolved to ask for a private
interview with his colonel and to tell him the whole of the secret
story, hoping that it might throw some light on the execution of
Élisabeth and the assassination of the two soldiers. But he learnt that
the colonel and his regiment were fighting on the other side of the
frontier and that the 3rd Company had been hurriedly sent for, all but
a detachment which was to remain at the château under Sergeant Delroze's
orders. Paul therefore made his own investigation with his men.
</p><p>It yielded nothing. There was no possibility of discovering the least
clue to the manner in which the murderer had made his way first into the
park, next into the ruins and lastly into the bedroom. As no civilian
had passed, were they to conclude that the perpetrator of the two crimes
was one of the privates of the 3rd company? Obviously not. And yet what
other theory was there to adopt?
</p><p>Nor did Paul discover anything to tell him of his wife's death or of the
place where she was buried. And this was the hardest trial of all.
</p><p>He encountered the same ignorance among the German wounded as among the
prisoners. They had all heard of the execution of a man and two women,
but they had all arrived after the execution and after the departure of
the troops that occupied the château.
</p><p>He went on to the village, thinking that they might know something
there; that the inhabitants had some news to tell of the lady of the
château, of the life she led, of her martyrdom and death. But Ornequin
was empty, with not a woman even, not an old man left in it. The enemy
must have sent all the inhabitants into Germany, doubtless from the
start, with the manifest object of destroying every witness to his
actions during the occupation and of creating a desert around the
château.
</p><p>Paul in this way devoted three days to the pursuit of fruitless
inquiries.
</p><p>"And yet," he said to Bernard, "Élisabeth cannot have disappeared
entirely. Even if I cannot find her grave, can I not find the least
trace of her existence? She lived here. She suffered here. I would give
anything for a relic of her."
</p><p>They had succeeded in fixing upon the exact site of the room in which
she used to sleep and even, in the midst of the ruins, the exact heap of
stones and plaster that remained of it. It was all mixed up with the
wreckage of the ground-floor rooms, into which the first-floor ceilings
had been precipitated; and it was in this chaos, under the pile of walls
and furniture reduced to dust and fragments, that one morning he picked
up a little broken mirror, followed by a tortoise-shell hair-brush, a
silver pen-knife and a set of scissors, all of which had belonged to
Élisabeth.
</p><p>But what affected him even more was the discovery of a thick diary, in
which he knew that his wife, before her marriage, used to note down her
expenses, the errands or visits that had to be remembered and,
occasionally, some more private details of her life. Now all that was
left of her diary was the binding, with the date, 1914, and the part
containing the entries for the first seven months of the year. All the
sheets for the last five months had been not torn out but removed
separately from the strings that fastened them to the binding.
</p><p>Paul at once thought to himself:
</p><p>"They were removed by Élisabeth, removed at her leisure, at a time when
there was no hurry and when she merely wished to use those pages for
writing on from day to day. What would she want to write? Just those
more personal notes which she used formerly to put down in her diary
between the entry of a disbursement and a receipt. And as there can have
been no accounts to keep since my departure and as her existence was
nothing but a hideous tragedy, there is no doubt that she confided her
distress to those pages, her complaints, possibly her shrinking from
me."
</p><p>That day, in Bernard's absence, Paul increased the thoroughness of his
search. He rummaged under every stone and in every hole. The broken
slabs of marble, the twisted lustres, the torn carpets, the beams
blackened by the flames, he lifted them all. He persisted for hours. He
divided the ruins into sections which he examined patiently in rotation;
and, when the ruins refused to answer his questions, he renewed his
minute investigations in the ground.
</p><p>His efforts were useless; and Paul knew that they were bound to be so.
Élisabeth must have attached far too much value to those pages not to
have either destroyed them or hidden them beyond the possibility of
discovery. Unless:
</p><p>"Unless," he said to himself, "they have been stolen from her. The major
must have kept a constant watch upon her. And, in that case, who knows?"
</p><p>An idea occurred to Paul's mind. After finding the peasant-woman's
clothes and black lace scarf, he had left them on the bed, attaching no
further importance to them; and he now asked himself if the major, on
the night when he had murdered the two soldiers, had not come with the
intention of fetching away the clothes, or at least the contents of
their pockets, which he had not been able to do because they were hidden
under Private Gériflour, who was sleeping on the top of them. Now Paul
seemed to remember that, when unfolding that peasant's skirt and bodice,
he had noticed a rustling of paper in one of the pockets. Was it not
reasonable to conclude that this was Élisabeth's diary, which had been
discovered and stolen by Major Hermann?
</p><p>Paul hastened to the room in which the murders had been committed,
snatched up the clothes and looked through them:
</p><p>"Ah," he at once exclaimed, with genuine delight, "here they are!"
</p><p>There was a large, yellow envelope filled with the pages removed from
the diary. These were crumpled and here and there torn; and Paul saw at
a glance that the pages corresponded only with the months of August and
September and that even some days in each of these months were missing.
</p><p>And he saw Élisabeth's handwriting.
</p><p>It was not a full or detailed diary. It consisted merely of notes, poor
little notes in which a bruised heart found an outlet. At times, when
they ran to greater length, an extra page had been added. The notes had
been jotted down by day or night, anyhow, in ink and pencil; they were
sometimes hardly legible; and they gave the impression of a trembling
hand, of eyes veiled with tears and of a mind crazed with suffering.
</p><p>Paul was moved to the very depths of his being. He was alone and he
read:
</p>
<p>                                        "<u>Sunday, 2 August.</u>
</p><pre>
      "He ought not to have written me that letter. It is
      too cruel. And why does he suggest that I should leave
      Ornequin? The war? Does he think that, because there
      is a chance of war, I shall not have the courage to
      stay here and do my duty? How little he knows me! Then
      he must either think me a coward or believe me capable
      of suspecting my poor mother! . . . Paul, dear Paul,
      you ought not to have left me. . . .</pre>

<p>                                        "<u>Monday, 3 August.</u>
</p><pre>
      "Jérôme and Rosalie have been kinder and more
      thoughtful than ever, now that the servants are gone.
      Rosalie begged and prayed that I should go away, too.
      "'And what about yourselves, Rosalie?' I said. 'Will
      you go?'
      "'Oh, we're people who don't matter, we have nothing
      to fear! Besides, our place is here.'
      "I said that so was mine; but I saw that she could not
      understand.
      "Jérôme, when I meet him, shakes his head and looks at
      me sadly.</pre>

<p>                                       "<u>Tuesday, 4 August.</u>
</p><pre>
      "I have not the least doubt of what my duty is. I
      would rather die than turn my back on it. But how am I
      to fulfil that duty and get at the truth? I am full of
      courage; and yet I am always crying, as though I had
      nothing better to do. The fact is that I am always
      thinking of Paul. Where is he? What has become of him?
      When Jérôme told me this morning that war was
      declared, I thought that I should faint. So Paul is
      going to fight. He will be wounded perhaps. He may be
      killed. God knows if my true place is not somewhere
      near him, in a town close to where he is fighting!
      What have I to hope for in staying here? My duty to my
      mother, yes, I know. Ah, mother, I beseech your
      forgiveness . . . but, you see, I love my husband and
      I am so afraid of anything happening to him! . . .</pre>

<p>                                      "<u>Thursday, 6 August.</u>
</p><pre>
      "Still crying. I grow unhappier every day. But I feel
      that, even if I became still more so, I would not
      desist. Besides, how can I go to him when he does not
      want to have anything more to do with me and does not
      even write? Love me? Why, he loathes me! I am the
      daughter of a woman whom he hates above all things in
      the world. How unspeakably horrible! If he thinks like
      that of my mother and if I fail in my task, we shall
      never see each other again! That is the life I have
      before me.</pre>

<p>                                        "<u>Friday, 7 August.</u>
</p><pre>
      "I have made Jérôme and Rosalie tell me all about
      mother. They only knew her for a few weeks, but they
      remember her quite well; and what they said made me
      feel so happy! She was so good, it seems, and so
      pretty; everybody worshiped her.
      "'She was not always very cheerful,' said Rosalie. 'I
      don't know if it was her illness already affecting her
      spirits, but there was something about her, when she
      smiled, that went to one's heart.'
      "My poor, darling mother!</pre>

<p>                                      "<u>Saturday, 8 August.</u>
</p><pre>
      "We heard the guns this morning, a long way off. They
      are fighting 25 miles away.
      "Some French soldiers have arrived. I had seen some of
      them pretty often from the terrace, marching down the
      Liseron Valley. But these are going to stay at the
      house. The captain made his apologies. So as not to
      inconvenience me, he and his lieutenants will sleep
      and have their meals in the lodge where Jérôme and
      Rosalie used to live.</pre>

<p>                                        "<u>Sunday, 9 August.</u>
</p><pre>
      "Still no news of Paul. I have given up trying to
      write to him either. I don't want him to hear from me
      until I have all the proofs. But what am I to do? How
      can I get proofs of something that happened seventeen
      years ago? Hunt about, think and reflect as I may, I
      can find nothing.</pre>

<p>                                       "<u>Monday, 10 August.</u>
</p><pre>
      "The guns never ceased booming in the distance.
      Nevertheless, the captain tells me that there is
      nothing to make one expect an attack by the enemy on
      this side.</pre>

<p>                                      "<u>Tuesday, 11 August.</u>
</p><pre>
      "A sentry posted in the woods, near the little door
      leading out of the estate, has just been
      killed--stabbed with a knife. They think that he must
      have been trying to stop a man who wanted to get out
      of the park. But how did the man get in?</pre>

<p>                                    "<u>Wednesday, 12 August.</u>
</p><pre>
      "What can be happening? Here is something that has
      made a great impression on me and seems impossible to
      understand. There are other things besides which are
      just as perplexing, though I can't say why. I am much
      astonished that the captain and all his soldiers whom
      I meet appear so indifferent and should even be able
      to make jokes among themselves. I feel the sort of
      depression that comes over one when a storm is at
      hand. There must be something wrong with my nerves.
      "Well, this morning. . . ."</pre>
<p>Paul stopped reading. The lower portion of the page containing the last
few lines and the whole of the next page were torn out. It looked as if
the major, after stealing Élisabeth's diary, had, for reasons best known
to himself, removed the pages in which she set forth a certain incident.
</p><p>The diary continued:
</p>
<p>                                       "<u>Friday, 14 August.</u>
</p><pre>
      "I felt I must tell the captain. I took him to the
      dead tree covered with ivy and asked him to lie down
      on the ground and listen. He did so very patiently and
      attentively. But he heard nothing and ended by saying:
      "'You see, madame, that everything is absolutely
      normal.'
      "'I assure you,' I answered, 'that two days ago there
      was a confused sound from this tree, just at this
      spot. And it lasted for several minutes.'
      "He replied, smiling as he spoke:
      "'We could easily have the tree cut down. But don't
      you think, madame, that in the state of nervous
      tension in which we all are we are liable to make
      mistakes; that we are subject to hallucinations? For,
      after all, where could the sound come from?'
      "Of course, he was right. And yet I had heard and seen
      for myself. . . .</pre>

<p>                                     "<u>Saturday, 15 August.</u>
</p><pre>
      "Yesterday, two German officers were brought in and
      were locked up in the wash-house, at the end of the
      yard. This morning, there was nothing in the
      wash-house but their uniforms. One can understand
      their breaking open the door. But the captain has
      found out that they made their escape in French
      uniforms and that they passed the sentries, saying
      that they had been sent to Corvigny.
      "Who can have supplied them with those uniforms?
      Besides, they had to know the password: who can have
      given them that?
      "It appears that a peasant woman called several days
      in succession with eggs and milk, a woman rather too
      well-dressed for her station, and that she hasn't been
      here to-day. But there is nothing to prove her
      complicity.</pre>

<p>                                       "<u>Sunday, 16 August.</u>
</p><pre>
      "The captain has been strongly urging me to go away.
      He is no longer cheerful. He seems very much
      preoccupied:
      "'We are surrounded by spies,' he said. 'And there is
      every sign of the possibility of a speedy attack. Not
      a big attack, intended to force a way through to
      Corvigny, but an attempt to take the château by
      surprise. It is my duty to warn you, madame, that we
      may be compelled at any moment to fall back on
      Corvigny and that it would be most imprudent for you
      to stay.'
      "I answered that nothing would change my resolution.
      Jérôme and Rosalie also implored me to leave. But what
      is the good? I intend to remain."</pre>
<p>Once again Paul stopped. There was a page missing in this section of the
diary; and the next page, the one headed 18 August, was torn at the top
and the bottom and contained only a fragment of what Élisabeth had
written on that day:
</p><pre>
      ". . . and that is why I have not spoken of it in the
      letter which I have just sent to Paul. He will know
      that I am staying on and the reasons for my decision;
      but he must not know of my hopes.
      "Those hopes are still so vague and built on so
      insignificant a detail. Still, I feel overjoyed. I do
      not realize the meaning of that detail, but I feel its
      importance. The captain is hurrying about, increasing
      the patrols; the soldiers are polishing their arms and
      crying out for the battle; the enemy may be taking up
      his quarters at Èbrecourt, as they say: what do I
      care? I have only one thought: have I found the key?
      Am I on the right road? Let me think. . . ."</pre>
<p>The page was torn here, at the place where Élisabeth was about to
explain things exactly. Was this a precautionary measure on Major
Hermann's part? No doubt; but why?
</p><p>The first part of the page headed 19 August was likewise torn. The
nineteenth was the day before t on which the Germans had carried
Ornequin, Corvigny and the whole district by assault. What had Élisabeth
written on that Wednesday afternoon? What had she discovered? What was
preparing in the darkness?
</p><p>Paul felt a dread at his heart. He remembered that the first gunshot had
thundered over Corvigny at two o'clock in the morning on Thursday and it
was with an anxious mind that he read, on the second half of the page:
</p>
<p>                                                 "<u>11 p. m.</u>
</p><pre>
      "I have got up and opened my window. Dogs are barking
      on every side. They answer one another, stop, seem to
      be listening and then begin howling again as I have
      never heard them do before. When they cease, the
      silence becomes impressive and I listen in my turn to
      try and catch the indistinct sounds that keep them
      awake.
      "Those sounds seem to my ears also to exist. It is
      something different from the rustling of the leaves.
      It has nothing to do with the ordinary interruption to
      the dead silence of the night. It comes from I can't
      tell where; and the impression it makes on me is so
      powerful that I ask myself at the same time whether I
      am just listening to the beating of my heart or
      whether I am hearing what might be the distant tramp
      of a marching army.
      "Oh, I must be mad! A marching army! And our outposts
      on the frontier? And our sentries all around the
      château? Why, there would be fighting, firing! . . .</pre>

<p>                                                  "<u>1 a. m.</u>
</p><pre>
      "I did not stir from the window. The dogs were no
      longer barking. Everything was asleep. And suddenly I
      saw some one come from under the trees and go across
      the lawn. I at first imagined it was one of our
      soldiers. But, when whoever it was passed under my
      window, there was just enough light in the sky for me
      to make out a woman's figure. I thought for a moment
      of Rosalie. But no, the figure was taller and moved
      with a lighter and quicker step.
      "I was on the point of waking Jérôme and giving the
      alarm. I did not, however. The figure had disappeared
      in the direction of the terrace. And all at once there
      came the cry of a bird, which struck me as strange.
      This was followed by a light that darted into the sky,
      like a shooting star springing from the ground.
      "After that, nothing. Silence, general restfulness.
      Nothing more. And yet I dare not go back to bed. I am
      frightened, without knowing why. All sorts of dangers
      seem to come rushing from every corner of the horizon.
      They draw closer, they surround me, they hem me in,
      they suffocate me, crush me, I can't breathe. I'm
      frightened . . . I'm frightened. . . ."</pre>
