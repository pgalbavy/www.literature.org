<p>There was little sleep that night in the cavern home of the gold-seekers.
The fact that the whole crop of the precious stuff was the better
part of a mile away in the mountains, even though apparently safe,
caused every one to feel uneasy. In addition was the announcement
of Jeff Graham, the leader, that their work in the Klondike region
was ended. In keeping with his habit of making known only that
which was necessary, he gave no explanation, and his friends were
left to speculate and surmise among themselves. All, however,
suspected the truth.</p>

<p>At early dawn Tim McCabe and the boys started up the trail, leading
the burro. The old miner remained behind, saying that he expected
company and his help was not needed in recovering the pilfered
gold. The anxiety of the men and boys did not lessen until they
reached the well-remembered spot and found the canvas bags intact.
They were carefully loaded upon the strong back of the animal,
secured in place, and the homeward journey begun. Frank and Roswell
walked at the rear, to make sure none of the gold was lost. In
due time they reached their primitive home, with all their wealth
in hand.</p>

<p>To their surprise, Jeff was absent. The recent experience of
the three confirmed them in their resolution not to leave the
nuggets and dust unguarded for a single hour. While some were
at work in the diggings, one at least would be at the cavern on
the watch against dishonest visitors. It was agreed that Tim and
Roswell should go to the little valley to resume work, while Frank
with the Winchester and smaller weapon acted as sentinel.</p>

<p>As the two were on the point of setting out, Jeff Graham appeared
with two well-dressed gentlemen, both in middle life. They were
talking earnestly, and halted just beyond earshot to complete
what they had to say. Then, without waiting to be introduced to
Jeff's friends, they bade him good-day, and hurried down the path
to where their horses were waiting, and lost no time in returning
to Dawson City.</p>

<p>"Get ready to foller," was the curt command of Jeff; and within
the following hour the whole party, including the donkey, were
on the road. They were compelled to spend one of the short nights
in camp, but reached Dawson City without the slightest molestation
from any one or the loss of a dollar's worth of gold. As Jeff
had announced his intention, they brought away only their auriferous
harvest and such clothing as was on their bodies. At the hotel
he held another long interview with the two gentlemen who had
called on him at the diggings; and the first steamer down the
Yukon, which was now fairly open, bore among its hundreds of passengers
Jeff Graham, Tim McCabe, Roswell Palmer, and Frank Mansley. The
combined gold of the fortunate passengers on that trip must have
amounted to nearly a million dollars.</p>

<p>Some weeks later Jeff and Tim were seated alone in one of the
rooms at the Palace Hotel, San Francisco. They had met by appointment
to close up the business which had taken them into the Klondike
region.</p>

<p>"You know, Tim," said the old miner, "that this whole thing was
my own."</p>

<p>Tim nodded his head.</p>

<p>"I was aware of the same before ye mentioned it. Ye paid all
our ixpenses like a gintleman, and we're entitled to fair wages
for hilping and no more."</p>

<p>The generous disavowal of all claim to a share in the rich find
touched Jeff, who hastened to say:</p>

<p>"Some folks might think that way, but I don't. It was a speculation
on my part. It didn't cost much to get us to the Klondike, and
so that don't count. I have delivered to the mint all the gold
we brought back, and have been paid one hundred and twenty thousand
dollars for it. You know what was done by the two men that visited
us at the diggings?"</p>

<p>"The byes and mesilf had the idea that they bought out your claim."</p>

<p>"That's it. I was anxious to get out of the country before the
summer fairly set in and the mosquitoes ate us up alive. From
the way the dirt panned out, we should have been millionaires
in a few weeks, but we had enough. There ain't many men as know
when they have enough," was the philosophical observation of Jeff.
"I do, so I sold my claim for a hundred and eighty thousand dollars.
As I figure out, that makes the total three hundred thousand dollars,
which, divided among us four, gives each seventy-five thousand
dollars. How does that strike you, Tim?"</p>

<p>"It almost knocks me off my chair, if you mean it."</p>

<p>"The boys being under age, I have turned over their shares to
their parents; and do you know," added Jeff, with an expression
of disgust, "they both fixed things so as to go to college? You
wouldn't believe it, but it's the fact. Howsumever, it's their
business, and I ain't saying anything. Say, Tim, you hain't any
idea of going to college?" asked Jeff, looking across at his friend
with a startled expression.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "<em>SAY, TIM, YOU HAIN'T ANY IDEA OF GOING TO
COLLEGE, HAVE YOU</em>?"]</p>

<p>"I won't unless ye will go wid me. How does that strike ye?"</p>

<p>Jeff's shoulders bobbed up and down with silent laughter, and
immediately he became serious again.</p>

<p>"As soon as you sign this paper, Tim, I shall give you a certified
check for seventy-five thousand dollars on the Bank of Californy.
Are you ready to sign?"</p>

<p>"I'll sign me own death warrant for that trifle," replied Tim,
his rosy face aglow, as he caught up the pen.</p>

<p>"Read it first."</p>

<p>His friend read:</p>

<p>"I, Timothy McCabe, hereby pledge my sacred honor not to taste
a drop of malt or spirituous liquor, even on the advice of a physician
who may declare it necessary to save my life, from the date of
the signing of this pledge until the Fourth of July, one thousand
nine hundred and seven."</p>

<p>As Tim gathered the meaning of the words on the paper, his eyes
expanded; he puckered his lips and emitted a low whistle.</p>

<p>"Do ye mind," he said, looking across the table with his old
quizzical expression, "the remark that the governor of North Carliny
made to the governor of South Carliny?"</p>

<p>Jeff gravely inclined his head.</p>

<p>"I've heerd of it."</p>

<p>"What do ye s'pose he would have said if the time between drinks
was ten years?"</p>

<p>"I've never thought, and don't care."</p>

<p>"He would have died long before the time was up."</p>

<p>"When you left the boys in the diggings you came to Dawson City
to spend the worth of that nugget for whiskey. I happened to meet
you in time and made you go back with me. You'd been off on sprees
a half dozen other times, if I hadn't kept an eye on you. Drink
is the enemy that will down you if you don't stop at once. If
you'll stay sober for ten years, I'll take the chances after that.
Are you going to sign?"</p>

<p>Tim's eyes were fixed on the paper which he held in his hand.
He mused loud enough for the listening Jeff to catch every word:</p>

<p>"To sign that means no more headaches and bad health, but a clear
brain and a strong body; no more hours of gloom, no weakness of
the limbs and pricks of the conscience; no more breaking the heart
of me good old mother in Ireland, but the bringing of sunshine
and joy to her in her last days; it means the signing away of
me slavery, and the clasping to me heart of the swate boon of
liberty; it means the making of mesilf into a man!"</p>

<p>With a firm hand he wrote his name at the bottom of the paper,
and flinging down the pen, said:</p>

<p>"With God's help, that pledge shall be kept."</p>

<p>"Amen," reverently responded Jeff; "there's your check for seventy-five
thousand dollars."</p>

<p><em>THE END</em>.</p>
