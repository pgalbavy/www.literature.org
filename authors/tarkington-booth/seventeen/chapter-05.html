<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>There was something really pageant-like about the little excursion
now, and the glittering clothes-boiler, borne on high, sent flashing
lights far down the street. The wash-tubs were old-fashioned,
of wood; they refused to fit one within the other; so William,
with his right hand, and Genesis, with his left, carried one of
the tubs between them; Genesis carried the heavy wringer with
his right hand, and he had fastened the other tub upon his back
by means of a bit of rope which passed over his shoulder; thus
the tin boiler, being a lighter burden, fell to William.</p>

<p>The cover would not stay in place, but continually fell off when
he essayed to carry the boiler by one of its handles, and he made
shift to manage the accursed thing in various ways&mdash;the only one
proving physically endurable being, unfortunately, the most grotesque.
He was forced to carry the cover in his left hand and to place
his head partially within the boiler itself, and to support it&mdash;tilted
obliquely to rest upon his shoulders&mdash;as a kind of monstrous tin
cowl or helmet. This had the advantage of somewhat concealing
his face, though when he leaned his head back, in order to obtain
clearer vision of what was before him, the boiler slid off and
fell to the pavement with a noise that nearly caused a runaway,
and brought the hot-cheeked William much derisory attention from
a passing street-car. However, he presently caught the knack of
keeping it in position, and it fell no more.</p>

<p>Seen from the rear, William was unrecognizable&mdash;but interesting.
He appeared to be a walking clothes-boiler, armed with a shield
and connected, by means of a wash-tub, with a negro of informal
ideas concerning dress. In fact, the group was whimsical, and
three young people who turned in behind it, out of a cross-street,
indulged immediately in fits of inadequately suppressed laughter,
though neither Miss May Parcher nor Mr. Johnnie Watson even remotely
suspected that the legs beneath the clothes-boiler belonged to
an acquaintance. And as for the third of this little party, Miss
Parcher's visitor, those peregrinating legs suggested nothing
familiar to her.</p>

<p>"Oh, see the fun-ee laundrymans!" she cried, addressing a cottony
doglet's head that bobbed gently up and down over her supporting
arm. "Sweetest Flopit must see, too! Flopit, look at the fun-ee
laundrymans!"</p>

<p>"'Sh!" murmured Miss Parcher, choking. "He might hear you."</p>

<p>He might, indeed, since they were not five yards behind him and
the dulcet voice was clear and free. Within the shadowy interior
of the clothes-boiler were features stricken with sudden, utter
horror. "<em>FLOPIT</em>!"</p>

<p>The attention of Genesis was attracted by a convulsive tugging
of the tub which he supported in common with William; it seemed
passionately to urge greater speed. A hissing issued from the
boiler, and Genesis caught the words, huskily whispered:</p>

<p>"Walk faster! You got to walk faster."</p>

<p>The tub between them tugged forward with a pathos of appeal wasted
upon the easy-going Genesis.</p>

<p>"I got plenty time cut 'at grass befo' you' pa gits home," he
said, reassuringly. "Thishere rope what I got my extry tub slung
to is 'mos' wo' plum thew my hide."</p>

<p>Having uttered this protest, he continued to ambulate at the
same pace, though somewhat assisted by the forward pull of the
connecting tub, an easance of burden which he found pleasant;
and no supplementary message came from the clothes-boiler, for
the reason that it was incapable of further speech. And so the
two groups maintained for a time their relative positions, about
fifteen feet apart.</p>

<p>The amusement of the second group having abated through satiety,
the minds of its components turned to other topics. "Now Flopit
must have his darlin' 'ickle run," said Flopit's mistress, setting
the doglet upon the ground. "That's why sweetest Flopit and I
and all of us came for a walk, instead of sitting on the nice,
cool porch-kins. <em>SEE </em>the sweetie toddle! Isn't he adorable,
May? <em>ISN'T </em>he adorable, Mr. Watson?"</p>

<p>Mr. Watson put a useless sin upon his soul, since all he needed
to say was a mere "Yes." He fluently avowed himself to have become
insane over the beauty of Flopit.</p>

<p>Flopit, placed upon the ground, looked like something that had
dropped from a Christmas tree, and he automatically made use of
fuzzy legs, somewhat longer than a caterpillar's, to patter after
his mistress. He was neither enterprising nor inquisitive; he
kept close to the rim of her skirt, which was as high as he could
see, and he wished to be taken up and carried again. He was in
a half-stupor; it was his desire to remain in that condition,
and his propulsion was almost wholly subconscious, though surprisingly
rapid, considering his dimensions.</p>

<p>"My goo'ness!" exclaimed Genesis, glancing back over his shoulder.
"'At li'l' thing ack like he think he go'n a <em>GIT </em>somewheres!"
And then, in answer to a frantic pull upon the tub, "Look like
you mighty strong t'day," he said. "I cain' go no fastuh!" He
glanced back again, chuckling. "'At li'l' bird do well not mix
up nothin' 'ith ole man Clematis!"</p>

<p>Clematis, it happened, was just coming into view, having been
detained round the corner by his curiosity concerning a set of
Louis <em>XVI. </em>furniture which some house-movers were unpacking
upon the sidewalk. A curl of excelsior, in fact, had attached
itself to his nether lip, and he was pausing to remove it&mdash;when
his roving eye fell upon Flopit. Clematis immediately decided
to let the excelsior remain where it was, lest he miss something
really important.</p>

<p>He approached with glowing eagerness at a gallop.</p>

<p>Then, having almost reached his goal, he checked himself with
surprising abruptness and walked obliquely beside Flopit, but
upon a parallel course, his manner agitated and his brow furrowed
with perplexity. Flopit was about the size of Clematis's head,
and although Clematis was certain that Flopit was something alive,
he could not decide what.</p>

<p>Flopit paid not the slightest attention to Clematis. The self-importance
of dogs, like that of the minds of men, is in directly inverse
ratio to their size; and if the self-importance of Flopit could
have been taken out of him and given to an elephant, that elephant
would have been insufferable.</p>

<p>Flopit continued to pay no attention to Clematis.</p>

<p>All at once, a roguish and irresponsible mood seized upon Clematis;
he laid his nose upon the ground, deliberating a bit of gaiety,
and then, with a little rush, set a large, rude paw upon the sensitive
face of Flopit and capsized him. Flopit uttered a bitter complaint
in an asthmatic voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, nassy dray bid Horror!" cried his mistress, turning quickly
at this sound and waving a pink parasol at Clematis. "Shoo! <em>DIRTY
</em>dog! Go 'way!"  And she was able somehow to connect him with
the wash-tub and boiler, for she added, "Nassy laundrymans to
have bad doggies!"</p>

<p>Mr. Watson rushed upon Clematis with angry bellowings and imaginary
missiles. "You disgusting brute!" he roared. "How <em>DARE </em>you?"</p>

<p>Apparently much alarmed, Clematis lowered his ears, tucked his
tail underneath him, and fled to the rear, not halting once or
looking back until he disappeared round the corner whence he had
come. "There!" said Mr. Watson. "I guess HE won't bother us again
very soon!"</p>

<p>It must be admitted that Milady was one of those people who do
not mind being overheard, no matter what they say. "Lucky for
us," she said, "we had a nice dray bid <em>MANS </em>to protect
us, wasn't it, Flopit?" And she thought it necessary to repeat
something she had already made sufficiently emphatic.</p>

<p>"Nassy laundrymans!"</p>

<p>"I expect I gave that big mongrel the fright of his life," said
Mr. Watson, with complacency. "He'll probably run a mile!"</p>

<p>The shoulders of Genesis shook as he was towed along by the convulsive
tub. He knew from previous evidence that Clematis possessed both
a high quality and a large quantity of persistence, and it was
his hilarious opinion that the dog had not gone far. As a matter
of fact, the head of Clematis was at this moment cautiously extended
from behind the fence-post at the corner whither he had fled.
Viewing with growing assurance the scene before him, he permitted
himself to emerge wholly, and sat down, with his head tilted to
one side in thought. Almost at the next corner the clothes-boiler
with legs, and the wash-tubs, and Genesis were marching on; and
just behind them went three figures not so familiar to Clematis,
and connected in his mind with a vague, mild apprehension. But
all backs were safely toward him, and behind them pattered that
small live thing which had so profoundly interested him.</p>

<p>He rose and came on apace, silently.</p>

<p>When he reached the side of Flopit, some eight or nine seconds
later, Clematis found himself even more fascinated and perplexed
than during their former interview, though again Flopit seemed
utterly to disregard him. Clematis was not at all sure that Flopit
<em>WAS </em>a dog, but he felt that it was his business to find
out. Heaven knows, so far, Clematis had not a particle of animosity
in his heart, but he considered it his duty to himself&mdash;in case
Flopit turned out not to be a dog&mdash;to learn just what he was.
The thing might be edible.</p>

<p>Therefore, again pacing obliquely beside Flopit (while the human
beings ahead went on, unconscious of the approaching climax behind
them) Clematis sought to detect, by senses keener than sight,
some evidence of Flopit's standing in the zoological kingdom;
and, sniffing at the top of Flopit's head&mdash;though Clematis was
uncertain about its indeed being a head&mdash;he found himself baffled
and mentally much disturbed.</p>

<p>Flopit did not smell like a dog; he smelled of violets.</p>
