<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I believe he had seen us out of the window coming off to dine
in the dinghy of a fourteen-ton yawl belonging to Marlow my host
and skipper.  We helped the boy we had with us to haul the boat
up on the landing-stage before we went up to the riverside inn,
where we found our new acquaintance eating his dinner in dignified
loneliness at the head of a long table, white and inhospitable
like a snow bank.</p>

<p>The red tint of his clear-cut face with trim short black whiskers
under a cap of curly iron-grey hair was the only warm spot in
the dinginess of that room cooled by the cheerless tablecloth. 
We knew him already by sight as the owner of a little five-ton
cutter, which he sailed alone apparently, a fellow yachtsman in
the unpretending band of fanatics who cruise at the mouth of the
Thames.  But the first time he addressed the waiter sharply as
'steward' we knew him at once for a sailor as well as a yachtsman.</p>

<p>Presently he had occasion to reprove that same waiter for the
slovenly manner in which the dinner was served.  He did it with
considerable energy and then turned to us.</p>

<p>"If we at sea," he declared, "went about our work as people ashore
high and low go about theirs we should never make a living.  No
one would employ us.  And moreover no ship navigated and sailed
in the happy-golucky manner people conduct their business on shore
would ever arrive into port."</p>

<p>Since he had retired from the sea he had been astonished to discover
that the educated people were not much better than the others. 
No one seemed to take any proper pride in his work: from plumbers
who were simply thieves to, say, newspaper men (he seemed to think
them a specially intellectual class) who never by any chance gave
a correct version of the simplest affair.  This universal inefficiency
of what he called "the shore gang" he ascribed in general to the
want of responsibility and to a sense of security.</p>

<p>"They see," he went on, "that no matter what they do this tight
little island won't turn turtle with them or spring a leak and
go to the bottom with their wives and children."</p>

<p>From this point the conversation took a special turn relating
exclusively to sea-life.  On that subject he got quickly in touch
with Marlow who in his time had followed the sea.  They kept up
a lively exchange of reminiscences while I listened.  They agreed
that the happiest time in their lives was as youngsters in good
ships, with no care in the world but not to lose a watch below
when at sea and not a moment's time in going ashore after work
hours when in harbour.  They agreed also as to the proudest moment
they had known in that calling which is never embraced on rational
and practical grounds, because of the glamour of its romantic
associations.  It was the moment when they had passed successfully
their first examination and left the seamanship Examiner with
the little precious slip of blue paper in their hands.</p>

<p>"That day I wouldn't have called the Queen my cousin," declared
our new acquaintance enthusiastically.</p>

<p>At that time the Marine Board examinations took place at the
St. Katherine's Dock House on Tower Hill, and he informed us that
he had a special affection for the view of that historic locality,
with the Gardens to the left, the front of the Mint to the right,
the miserable tumble-down little houses farther away, a cabstand,
boot-blacks squatting on the edge of the pavement and a pair of
big policemen gazing with an air of superiority at the doors of
the Black Horse public-house across the road.  This was the part
of the world, he said, his eyes first took notice of, on the finest
day of his life.  He had emerged from the main entrance of St.
Katherine's Dock House a full-fledged second mate after the hottest
time of his life with Captain R-, the most dreaded of the three
seamanship Examiners who at the time were responsible for the
merchant service officers qualifying in the Port of London.</p>

<p>"We all who were preparing to pass," he said, "used to shake
in our shoes at the idea of going before him.  He kept me for
an hour and a half in the torture chamber and behaved as though
he hated me.  He kept his eyes shaded with one of his hands. 
Suddenly he let it drop saying, "You will do!"  Before I realised
what he meant he was pushing the blue slip across the table. 
I jumped up as if my chair had caught fire.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," says I, grabbing the paper.</p>

<p>"Good morning, good luck to you," he growls at me.</p>

<p>"The old doorkeeper fussed out of the cloak-room with my hat. 
They always do.  But he looked very hard at me before he ventured
to ask in a sort of timid whisper: "Got through all right, sir?" 
For all answer I dropped a half-crown into his soft broad palm. 
"Well," says he with a sudden grin from ear to ear, "I never knew
him keep any of you gentlemen so long.  He failed two second mates
this morning before your turn came. Less than twenty minutes each:
that's about his usual time."</p>

<p>"I found myself downstairs without being aware of the steps as
if I had floated down the staircase.  The finest day in my life. 
The day you get your first command is nothing to it.  For one
thing a man is not so young then and for another with us, you
know, there is nothing much more to expect.  Yes, the finest day
of one's life, no doubt, but then it is just a day and no more. 
What comes after is about the most unpleasant time for a youngster,
the trying to get an officer's berth with nothing much to show
but a brand-new certificate.  It is surprising how useless you
find that piece of ass's skin that you have been putting yourself
in such a state about.  It didn't strike me at the time that a
Board of Trade certificate does not make an officer, not by a
long long way.  But the slippers of the ships I was haunting with
demands for a job knew that very well.  I don't wonder at them
now, and I don't blame them either. But this 'trying to get a
ship' is pretty hard on a youngster all the same . . . "</p>

<p>He went on then to tell us how tired he was and how discouraged
by this lesson of disillusion following swiftly upon the finest
day of his life. He told us how he went the round of all the ship-owners'
offices in the City where some junior clerk would furnish him
with printed forms of application which he took home to fill up
in the evening.  He used to run out just before midnight to post
them in the nearest pillar-box.  And that was all that ever came
of it.  In his own words: he might just as well have dropped them
all properly addressed and stamped into the sewer grating.</p>

<p>Then one day, as he was wending his weary way to the docks, he
met a friend and former shipmate a little older than himself outside
the Fenchurch Street Railway Station.</p>

<p>He craved for sympathy but his friend had just "got a ship" that
very morning and was hurrying home in a state of outward joy and
inward uneasiness usual to a sailor who after many days of waiting
suddenly gets a berth.  This friend had the time to condole with
him but briefly.  He must be moving.  Then as he was running off,
over his shoulder as it were, he suggested: "Why don't you go
and speak to Mr. Powell in the Shipping Office."  Our friend objected
that he did not know Mr. Powell from Adam.  And the other already
pretty near round the corner shouted back advice: "Go to the private
door of the Shipping Office and walk right up to him.  His desk
is by the window.  Go up boldly and say I sent you."</p>

<p>Our new acquaintance looking from one to the other of us declared:
"Upon my word, I had grown so desperate that I'd have gone boldly
up to the devil himself on the mere hint that he had a second
mate's job to give away."</p>

<p>It was at this point that interrupting his flow of talk to light
his pipe but holding us with his eye he inquired whether we had
known Powell. Marlow with a slight reminiscent smile murmured
that he "remembered him very well."</p>

<p>Then there was a pause.  Our new acquaintance had become involved
in a vexatious difficulty with his pipe which had suddenly betrayed
his trust and disappointed his anticipation of self-indulgence. 
To keep the ball rolling I asked Marlow if this Powell was remarkable
in any way.</p>

<p>"He was not exactly remarkable," Marlow answered with his usual
nonchalance.  "In a general way it's very difficult for one to
become remarkable.  People won't take sufficient notice of one,
don't you know. I remember Powell so well simply because as one
of the Shipping Masters in the Port of London he dispatched me
to sea on several long stages of my sailor's pilgrimage.  He resembled
Socrates.  I mean he resembled him genuinely: that is in the face. 
A philosophical mind is but an accident. He reproduced exactly
the familiar bust of the immortal sage, if you will imagine the
bust with a high top hat riding far on the back of the head, and
a black coat over the shoulders.  As I never saw him except from
the other side of the long official counter bearing the five writing
desks of the five Shipping Masters, Mr. Powell has remained a
bust to me."</p>

<p>Our new acquaintance advanced now from the mantelpiece with his
pipe in good working order.</p>

<p>"What was the most remarkable about Powell," he enunciated dogmatically
with his head in a cloud of smoke, "is that he should have had
just that name.  You see, my name happens to be Powell too."</p>

<p>It was clear that this intelligence was not imparted to us for
social purposes.  It required no acknowledgment.  We continued
to gaze at him with expectant eyes.</p>

<p>He gave himself up to the vigorous enjoyment of his pipe for
a silent minute or two.  Then picking up the thread of his story
he told us how he had started hot foot for Tower Hill.  He had
not been that way since the day of his examination&mdash;the finest
day of his life&mdash;the day of his overweening pride.  It was very
different now.  He would not have called the Queen his cousin,
still, but this time it was from a sense of profound abasement. 
He didn't think himself good enough for anybody's kinship.  He
envied the purple-nosed old cab-drivers on the stand, the boot-black
boys at the edge of the pavement, the two large bobbies pacing
slowly along the Tower Gardens railings in the consciousness of
their infallible might, and the bright scarlet sentries walking
smartly to and fro before the Mint.  He envied them their places
in the scheme of world's labour.  And he envied also the miserable
sallow, thin-faced loafers blinking their obscene eyes and rubbing
their greasy shoulders against the door-jambs of the Black Horse
pub, because they were too far gone to feel their degradation.</p>

<p>I must render the man the justice that he conveyed very well
to us the sense of his youthful hopelessness surprised at not
finding its place in the sun and no recognition of its right to
live.</p>

<p>He went up the outer steps of St. Katherine's Dock House, the
very steps from which he had some six weeks before surveyed the
cabstand, the buildings, the policemen, the boot-blacks, the paint,
gilt, and plateglass of the Black Horse, with the eye of a Conqueror. 
At the time he had been at the bottom of his heart surprised that
all this had not greeted him with songs and incense, but now (he
made no secret of it) he made his entry in a slinking fashion
past the doorkeeper's glass box.  "I hadn't any half-crowns to
spare for tips," he remarked grimly.  The man, however, ran out
after him asking: "What do you require?" but with a grateful glance
up at the first floor in remembrance of Captain R-'s examination
room (how easy and delightful all that had been) he bolted down
a flight leading to the basement and found himself in a place
of dusk and mystery and many doors.  He had been afraid of being
stopped by some rule of no-admittance.  However he was not pursued.</p>

<p>The basement of St. Katherine's Dock House is vast in extent
and confusing in its plan.  Pale shafts of light slant from above
into the gloom of its chilly passages.  Powell wandered up and
down there like an early Christian refugee in the catacombs; but
what little faith he had in the success of his enterprise was
oozing out at his finger-tips.  At a dark turn under a gas bracket
whose flame was half turned down his selfconfidence abandoned
him altogether.</p>

<p>"I stood there to think a little," he said.  "A foolish thing
to do because of course I got scared.  What could you expect? 
It takes some nerve to tackle a stranger with a request for a
favour.  I wished my namesake Powell had been the devil himself. 
I felt somehow it would have been an easier job.  You see, I never
believed in the devil enough to be scared of him; but a man can
make himself very unpleasant.  I looked at a lot of doors, all
shut tight, with a growing conviction that I would never have
the pluck to open one of them.  Thinking's no good for one's nerve. 
I concluded I would give up the whole business.  But I didn't
give up in the end, and I'll tell you what stopped me.  It was
the recollection of that confounded doorkeeper who had called
after me.  I felt sure the fellow would be on the look-out at
the head of the stairs. If he asked me what I had been after,
as he had the right to do, I wouldn't know what to answer that
wouldn't make me look silly if no worse.  I got very hot.  There
was no chance of slinking out of this business.</p>

<p>"I had lost my bearings somehow down there.  Of the many doors
of various sizes, right and left, a good few had glazed lights
above; some however must have led merely into lumber rooms or
such like, because when I brought myself to try one or two I was
disconcerted to find that they were locked.  I stood there irresolute
and uneasy like a baffled thief. The confounded basement was as
still as a grave and I became aware of my heart beats.  Very uncomfortable
sensation.  Never happened to me before or since.  A bigger door
to the left of me, with a large brass handle looked as if it might
lead into the Shipping Office.  I tried it, setting my teeth. 
"Here goes!"</p>

<p>"It came open quite easily.  And lo! the place it opened into
was hardly any bigger than a cupboard.  Anyhow it wasn't more
than ten feet by twelve; and as I in a way expected to see the
big shadowy cellar-like extent of the Shipping Office where I
had been once or twice before, I was extremely startled.  A gas
bracket hung from the middle of the ceiling over a dark, shabby
writing-desk covered with a litter of yellowish dusty documents. 
Under the flame of the single burner which made the place ablaze
with light, a plump, little man was writing hard, his nose very
near the desk.  His head was perfectly bald and about the same
drab tint as the papers.  He appeared pretty dusty too.</p>

<p>"I didn't notice whether there were any cobwebs on him, but I
shouldn't wonder if there were because he looked as though he
had been imprisoned for years in that little hole.  The way he
dropped his pen and sat blinking my way upset me very much.  And
his dungeon was hot and musty; it smelt of gas and mushrooms,
and seemed to be somewhere 120 feet below the ground.  Solid,
heavy stacks of paper filled all the corners half-way up to the
ceiling.  And when the thought flashed upon me that these were
the premises of the Marine Board and that this fellow must be
connected in some way with ships and sailors and the sea, my astonishment
took my breath away.  One couldn't imagine why the Marine Board
should keep that bald, fat creature slaving down there.  For some
reason or other I felt sorry and ashamed to have found him out
in his wretched captivity.  I asked gently and sorrowfully: "The
Shipping Office, please."</p>

<p>He piped up in a contemptuous squeaky voice which made me start:
"Not here.  Try the passage on the other side.  Street side. 
This is the Dock side.  You've lost your way . . . "</p>

<p>He spoke in such a spiteful tone that I thought he was going
to round off with the words: "You fool" . . . and perhaps he meant
to.  But what he finished sharply with was: "Shut the door quietly
after you."</p>

<p>And I did shut it quietly&mdash;you bet.  Quick and quiet.  The indomitable
spirit of that chap impressed me.  I wonder sometimes whether
he has succeeded in writing himself into liberty and a pension
at last, or had to go out of his gas-lighted grave straight into
that other dark one where nobody would want to intrude.  My humanity
was pleased to discover he had so much kick left in him, but I
was not comforted in the least.  It occurred to me that if Mr.
Powell had the same sort of temper . . . However, I didn't give
myself time to think and scuttled across the space at the foot
of the stairs into the passage where I'd been told to try. And
I tried the first door I came to, right away, without any hanging
back, because coming loudly from the hall above an amazed and
scandalized voice wanted to know what sort of game I was up to
down there.  "Don't you know there's no admittance that way?"
it roared.  But if there was anything more I shut it out of my
hearing by means of a door marked <em>Private</em> on the outside. 
It let me into a six-feet wide strip between a long counter and
the wall, taken off a spacious, vaulted room with a grated window
and a glazed door giving daylight to the further end.  The first
thing I saw right in front of me were three middle-aged men having
a sort of romp together round about another fellow with a thin,
long neck and sloping shoulders who stood up at a desk writing
on a large sheet of paper and taking no notice except that he
grinned quietly to himself. They turned very sour at once when
they saw me.  I heard one of them mutter 'Hullo!  What have we
here?'</p>

<p>"'I want to see Mr. Powell, please,' I said, very civil but firm;
I would let nothing scare me away now.  This was the Shipping
Office right enough.  It was after 3 o'clock and the business
seemed over for the day with them.  The long-necked fellow went
on with his writing steadily.  I observed that he was no longer
grinning.  The three others tossed their heads all together towards
the far end of the room where a fifth man had been looking on
at their antics from a high stool.  I walked up to him as boldly
as if he had been the devil himself.  With one foot raised up
and resting on the cross-bar of his seat he never stopped swinging
the other which was well clear of the stone floor.  He had unbuttoned
the top of his waistcoat and he wore his tall hat very far at
the back of his head. He had a full unwrinkled face and such clear-shining
eyes that his grey beard looked quite false on him, stuck on for
a disguise.  You said just now he resembled Socrates&mdash;didn't you? 
I don't know about that.  This Socrates was a wise man, I believe?"</p>

<p>"He was," assented Marlow.  "And a true friend of youth.  He
lectured them in a peculiarly exasperating manner.  It was a way
he had."</p>

<p>"Then give me Powell every time," declared our new acquaintance
sturdily. "He didn't lecture me in any way.  Not he.  He said:
'How do you do?' quite kindly to my mumble.  Then says he looking
very hard at me: 'I don't think I know you&mdash;do I?'</p>

<p>"No, sir," I said and down went my heart sliding into my boots,
just as the time had come to summon up all my cheek.  There's
nothing meaner in the world than a piece of impudence that isn't
carried off well.  For fear of appearing shamefaced I started
about it so free and easy as almost to frighten myself.  He listened
for a while looking at my face with surprise and curiosity and
then held up his hand.  I was glad enough to shut up, I can tell
you.</p>

<p>"Well, you are a cool hand," says he.  "And that friend of yours
too.  He pestered me coming here every day for a fortnight till
a captain I'm acquainted with was good enough to give him a berth. 
And no sooner he's provided for than he turns you on.  You youngsters
don't seem to mind whom you get into trouble."</p>

<p>"It was my turn now to stare with surprise and curiosity.  He
hadn't been talking loud but he lowered his voice still more.</p>

<p>"Don't you know it's illegal?"</p>

<p>"I wondered what he was driving at till I remembered that procuring
a berth for a sailor is a penal offence under the Act.  That clause
was directed of course against the swindling practices of the
boarding-house crimps.  It had never struck me it would apply
to everybody alike no matter what the motive, because I believed
then that people on shore did their work with care and foresight.</p>

<p>"I was confounded at the idea, but Mr. Powell made me soon see
that an Act of Parliament hasn't any sense of its own.  It has
only the sense that's put into it; and that's precious little
sometimes.  He didn't mind helping a young man to a ship now and
then, he said, but if we kept on coming constantly it would soon
get about that he was doing it for money.</p>

<p>"A pretty thing that would be: the Senior Shipping-Master of
the Port of London hauled up in a police court and fined fifty
pounds," says he. "I've another four years to serve to get my
pension.  It could be made to look very black against me and don't
you make any mistake about it," he says.</p>

<p>"And all the time with one knee well up he went on swinging his
other leg like a boy on a gate and looking at me very straight
with his shining eyes.  I was confounded I tell you.  It made
me sick to hear him imply that somebody would make a report against
him.</p>

<p>"Oh!" I asked shocked, "who would think of such a scurvy trick,
sir?"  I was half disgusted with him for having the mere notion
of it.</p>

<p>"Who?" says he, speaking very low.  "Anybody.  One of the office
messengers maybe.  I've risen to be the Senior of this office
and we are all very good friends here, but don't you think that
my colleague that sits next to me wouldn't like to go up to this
desk by the window four years in advance of the regulation time? 
Or even one year for that matter.  It's human nature."</p>

<p>"I could not help turning my head.  The three fellows who had
been skylarking when I came in were now talking together very
soberly, and the long-necked chap was going on with his writing
still.  He seemed to me the most dangerous of the lot.  I saw
him sideface and his lips were set very tight.  I had never looked
at mankind in that light before.  When one's young human nature
shocks one.  But what startled me most was to see the door I had
come through open slowly and give passage to a head in a uniform
cap with a Board of Trade badge.  It was that blamed old doorkeeper
from the hall.  He had run me to earth and meant to dig me out
too.  He walked up the office smirking craftily, cap in hand.</p>

<p>"What is it, Symons?" asked Mr. Powell.</p>

<p>"I was only wondering where this 'ere gentleman 'ad gone to,
sir.  He slipped past me upstairs, sir."</p>

<p>I felt mighty uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Symons.  I know the gentleman," says Mr. Powell
as serious as a judge.</p>

<p>"Very well, sir.  Of course, sir.  I saw the gentleman running
races all by 'isself down 'ere, so I . . ."</p>

<p>"It's all right I tell you," Mr. Powell cut him short with a
wave of his hand; and, as the old fraud walked off at last, he
raised his eyes to me. I did not know what to do: stay there,
or clear out, or say that I was sorry.</p>

<p>"Let's see," says he, "what did you tell me your name was?"</p>

<p>"Now, observe, I hadn't given him my name at all and his question
embarrassed me a bit.  Somehow or other it didn't seem proper
for me to fling his own name at him as it were.  So I merely pulled
out my new certificate from my pocket and put it into his hand
unfolded, so that he could read <em>Charles Powell</em> written
very plain on the parchment.</p>

<p>"He dropped his eyes on to it and after a while laid it quietly
on the desk by his side.  I didn't know whether he meant to make
any remark on this coincidence.  Before he had time to say anything
the glass door came open with a bang and a tall, active man rushed
in with great strides.  His face looked very red below his high
silk hat.  You could see at once he was the skipper of a big ship.</p>

<p>"Mr. Powell after telling me in an undertone to wait a little
addressed him in a friendly way.</p>

<p>"I've been expecting you in every moment to fetch away your Articles,
Captain.  Here they are all ready for you."  And turning to a
pile of agreements lying at his elbow he took up the topmost of
them.  From where I stood I could read the words: "Ship <em>Ferndale</em>"
written in a large round hand on the first page.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Powell, they aren't ready, worse luck," says that skipper. 
"I've got to ask you to strike out my second officer."  He seemed
excited and bothered.  He explained that his second mate had been
working on board all the morning.  At one o'clock he went out
to get a bit of dinner and didn't turn up at two as he ought to
have done.  Instead there came a messenger from the hospital with
a note signed by a doctor.  Collar bone and one arm broken.  Let
himself be knocked down by a pair horse van while crossing the
road outside the dock gate, as if he had neither eyes nor ears. 
And the ship ready to leave the dock at six o'clock to-morrow
morning!</p>

<p>"Mr. Powell dipped his pen and began to turn the leaves of the
agreement over.  "We must then take his name off," he says in
a kind of unconcerned sing-song.</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" burst out the skipper.  "This office closes
at four o'clock.  I can't find a man in half an hour."</p>

<p>"This office closes at four," repeats Mr. Powell glancing up
and down the pages and touching up a letter here and there with
perfect indifference.</p>

<p>"Even if I managed to lay hold some time to-day of a man ready
to go at such short notice I couldn't ship him regularly here&mdash;could
I?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Powell was busy drawing his pen through the entries relating
to that unlucky second mate and making a note in the margin.</p>

<p>"You could sign him on yourself on board," says he without looking
up. "But I don't think you'll find easily an officer for such
a pier-head jump."</p>

<p>"Upon this the fine-looking skipper gave signs of distress. 
The ship mustn't miss the next morning's tide.  He had to take
on board forty tons of dynamite and a hundred and twenty tons
of gunpowder at a place down the river before proceeding to sea. 
It was all arranged for next day. There would be no end of fuss
and complications if the ship didn't turn up in time . . . I couldn't
help hearing all this, while wishing him to take himself off,
because I wanted to know why Mr. Powell had told me to wait. 
After what he had been saying there didn't seem any object in
my hanging about.  If I had had my certificate in my pocket I
should have tried to slip away quietly; but Mr. Powell had turned
about into the same position I found him in at first and was again
swinging his leg.  My certificate open on the desk was under his
left elbow and I couldn't very well go up and jerk it away.</p>

<p>"I don't know," says he carelessly, addressing the helpless captain
but looking fixedly at me with an expression as if I hadn't been
there.  "I don't know whether I ought to tell you that I know
of a disengaged second mate at hand."</p>

<p>"Do you mean you've got him here?" shouts the other looking all
over the empty public part of the office as if he were ready to
fling himself bodily upon anything resembling a second mate. 
He had been so full of his difficulty that I verify believe he
had never noticed me.  Or perhaps seeing me inside he may have
thought I was some understrapper belonging to the place.  But
when Mr. Powell nodded in my direction he became very quiet and
gave me a long stare.  Then he stooped to Mr. Powell's ear &mdash;I
suppose he imagined he was whispering, but I heard him well enough.</p>

<p>"Looks very respectable."</p>

<p>"Certainly," says the shipping-master quite calm and staring
all the time at me.  "His name's Powell."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see!" says the skipper as if struck all of a heap.  "But
is he ready to join at once?"</p>

<p>"I had a sort of vision of my lodgings&mdash;in the North of London,
too, beyond Dalston, away to the devil&mdash;and all my gear scattered
about, and my empty sea-chest somewhere in an outhouse the good
people I was staying with had at the end of their sooty strip
of garden.  I heard the Shipping Master say in the coolest sort
of way:</p>

<p>"He'll sleep on board to-night."</p>

<p>"He had better," says the Captain of the <em>Ferndale</em> very
businesslike, as if the whole thing were settled.  I can't say
I was dumb for joy as you may suppose.  It wasn't exactly that. 
I was more by way of being out of breath with the quickness of
it.  It didn't seem possible that this was happening to me.  But
the skipper, after he had talked for a while with Mr. Powell,
too low for me to hear became visibly perplexed.</p>

<p>"I suppose he had heard I was freshly passed and without experience
as an officer, because he turned about and looked me over as if
I had been exposed for sale.</p>

<p>"He's young," he mutters.  "Looks smart, though . . . You're
smart and willing (this to me very sudden and loud) and all that,
aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I just managed to open and shut my mouth, no more, being taken
unawares. But it was enough for him.  He made as if I had deafened
him with protestations of my smartness and willingness.</p>

<p>"Of course, of course.  All right."  And then turning to the
Shipping Master who sat there swinging his leg, he said that he
certainly couldn't go to sea without a second officer.  I stood
by as if all these things were happening to some other chap whom
I was seeing through with it.  Mr. Powell stared at me with those
shining eyes of his.  But that bothered skipper turns upon me
again as though he wanted to snap my head off.</p>

<p>"You aren't too big to be told how to do things&mdash;are you?  You've
a lot to learn yet though you mayn't think so."</p>

<p>"I had half a mind to save my dignity by telling him that if
it was my seamanship he was alluding to I wanted him to understand
that a fellow who had survived being turned inside out for an
hour and a half by Captain R- was equal to any demand his old
ship was likely to make on his competence.  However he didn't
give me a chance to make that sort of fool of myself because before
I could open my mouth he had gone round on another tack and was
addressing himself affably to Mr. Powell who swinging his leg
never took his eyes off me.</p>

<p>"I'll take your young friend willingly, Mr. Powell.  If you let
him sign on as second-mate at once I'll take the Articles away
with me now."</p>

<p>"It suddenly dawned upon me that the innocent skipper of the
<em>Ferndale</em> had taken it for granted that I was a relative
of the Shipping Master!  I was quite astonished at this discovery,
though indeed the mistake was natural enough under the circumstances. 
What I ought to have admired was the reticence with which this
misunderstanding had been established and acted upon.  But I was
too stupid then to admire anything.  All my anxiety was that this
should be cleared up.  I was ass enough to wonder exceedingly
at Mr. Powell failing to notice the misapprehension.  I saw a
slight twitch come and go on his face; but instead of setting
right that mistake the Shipping Master swung round on his stool
and addressed me as 'Charles.'  He did.  And I detected him taking
a hasty squint at my certificate just before, because clearly
till he did so he was not sure of my christian name.  "Now then
come round in front of the desk, Charles," says he in a loud voice.</p>

<p>"Charles!  At first, I declare to you, it didn't seem possible
that he was addressing himself to me.  I even looked round for
that Charles but there was nobody behind me except the thin-necked
chap still hard at his writing, and the other three Shipping Masters
who were changing their coats and reaching for their hats, making
ready to go home.  It was the industrious thin-necked man who
without laying down his pen lifted with his left hand a flap near
his desk and said kindly:</p>

<p>"Pass this way."</p>

<p>I walked through in a trance, faced Mr. Powell, from whom I learned
that we were bound to Port Elizabeth first, and signed my name
on the Articles of the ship <em>Ferndale</em> as second mate&mdash;the
voyage not to exceed two years.</p>

<p>"You won't fail to join&mdash;eh?" says the captain anxiously.  "It
would cause no end of trouble and expense if you did.  You've
got a good six hours to get your gear together, and then you'll
have time to snatch a sleep on board before the crew joins in
the morning."</p>

<p>"It was easy enough for him to talk of getting ready in six hours
for a voyage that was not to exceed two years.  He hadn't to do
that trick himself, and with his sea-chest locked up in an outhouse
the key of which had been mislaid for a week as I remembered. 
But neither was I much concerned.  The idea that I was absolutely
going to sea at six o'clock next morning hadn't got quite into
my head yet.  It had been too sudden.</p>

<p>"Mr. Powell, slipping the Articles into a long envelope, spoke
up with a sort of cold half-laugh without looking at either of
us.</p>

<p>"Mind you don't disgrace the name, Charles."</p>

<p>"And the skipper chimes in very kindly:</p>

<p>"He'll do well enough I dare say.  I'll look after him a bit."</p>

<p>"Upon this he grabs the Articles, says something about trying
to run in for a minute to see that poor devil in the hospital,
and off he goes with his heavy swinging step after telling me
sternly: "Don't you go like that poor fellow and get yourself
run over by a cart as if you hadn't either eyes or ears."</p>

<p>"Mr. Powell," says I timidly (there was by then only the thin-necked
man left in the office with us and he was already by the door,
standing on one leg to turn the bottom of his trousers up before
going away).  "Mr. Powell," says I, "I believe the Captain of
the <em>Ferndale</em> was thinking all the time that I was a relation
of yours."</p>

<p>"I was rather concerned about the propriety of it, you know,
but Mr. Powell didn't seem to be in the least.</p>

<p>"Did he?" says he.  "That's funny, because it seems to me too
that I've been a sort of good uncle to several of you young fellows
lately.  Don't you think so yourself?  However, if you don't like
it you may put him right&mdash;when you get out to sea."  At this I
felt a bit queer.  Mr. Powell had rendered me a very good service:-
because it's a fact that with us merchant sailors the first voyage
as officer is the real start in life. He had given me no less
than that.  I told him warmly that he had done for me more that
day than all my relations put together ever did.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no," says he.  "I guess it's that shipment of explosives
waiting down the river which has done most for you.  Forty tons
of dynamite have been your best friend to-day, young man."</p>

<p>"That was true too, perhaps.  Anyway I saw clearly enough that
I had nothing to thank myself for.  But as I tried to thank him,
he checked my stammering.</p>

<p>"Don't be in a hurry to thank me," says he.  "The voyage isn't
finished yet."</p>

<p>Our new acquaintance paused, then added meditatively: "Queer
man.  As if it made any difference.  Queer man."</p>

<p>"It's certainly unwise to admit any sort of responsibility for
our actions, whose consequences we are never able to foresee,"
remarked Marlow by way of assent.</p>

<p>"The consequence of his action was that I got a ship," said the
other. "That could not do much harm," he added with a laugh which
argued a probably unconscious contempt of general ideas.</p>

<p>But Marlow was not put off.  He was patient and reflective. 
He had been at sea many years and I verily believe he liked sea-life
because upon the whole it is favourable to reflection.  I am speaking
of the now nearly vanished sea-life under sail.  To those who
may be surprised at the statement I will point out that this life
secured for the mind of him who embraced it the inestimable advantages
of solitude and silence.  Marlow had the habit of pursuing general
ideas in a peculiar manner, between jest and earnest.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't suggest," he said, "that your namesake Mr. Powell,
the Shipping Master, had done you much harm.  Such was hardly
his intention. And even if it had been he would not have had the
power.  He was but a man, and the incapacity to achieve anything
distinctly good or evil is inherent in our earthly condition. 
Mediocrity is our mark.  And perhaps it's just as well, since,
for the most part, we cannot be certain of the effect of our actions."</p>

<p>"I don't know about the effect," the other stood up to Marlow
manfully. "What effect did you expect anyhow?  I tell you he did
something uncommonly kind."</p>

<p>"He did what he could," Marlow retorted gently, "and on his own
showing that was not a very great deal.  I cannot help thinking
that there was some malice in the way he seized the opportunity
to serve you.  He managed to make you uncomfortable.  You wanted
to go to sea, but he jumped at the chance of accommodating your
desire with a vengeance.  I am inclined to think your cheek alarmed
him.  And this was an excellent occasion to suppress you altogether. 
For if you accepted he was relieved of you with every appearance
of humanity, and if you made objections (after requesting his
assistance, mind you) it was open to him to drop you as a sort
of impostor.  You might have had to decline that berth for some
very valid reason.  From sheer necessity perhaps.  The notice
was too uncommonly short.  But under the circumstances you'd have
covered yourself with ignominy."</p>

<p>Our new friend knocked the ashes out of his pipe.</p>

<p>"Quite a mistake," he said.  "I am not of the declining sort,
though I'll admit it was something like telling a man that you
would like a bath and in consequence being instantly knocked overboard
to sink or swim with your clothes on.  However, I didn't feel
as if I were in deep water at first.  I left the shipping office
quietly and for a time strolled along the street as easy as if
I had a week before me to fit myself out.  But by and by I reflected
that the notice was even shorter than it looked. The afternoon
was well advanced; I had some things to get, a lot of small matters
to attend to, one or two persons to see.  One of them was an aunt
of mine, my only relation, who quarrelled with poor father as
long as he lived about some silly matter that had neither right
nor wrong to it.  She left her money to me when she died.  I used
always to go and see her for decency's sake.  I had so much to
do before night that I didn't know where to begin.  I felt inclined
to sit down on the kerb and hold my head in my hands.  It was
as if an engine had been started going under my skull.  Finally
I sat down in the first cab that came along and it was a hard
matter to keep on sitting there I can tell you, while we rolled
up and down the streets, pulling up here and there, the parcels
accumulating round me and the engine in my head gathering more
way every minute.  The composure of the people on the pavements
was provoking to a degree, and as to the people in shops, they
were benumbed, more than half frozen&mdash;imbecile.  Funny how it
affects you to be in a peculiar state of mind: everybody that
does not act up to your excitement seems so confoundedly unfriendly. 
And my state of mind what with the hurry, the worry and a growing
exultation was peculiar enough.  That engine in my head went round
at its top speed hour after hour till eleven at about at night
it let up on me suddenly at the entrance to the Dock before large
iron gates in a dead wall."</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>These gates were closed and locked.  The cabby, after shooting
his things off the roof of his machine into young Powell's arms,
drove away leaving him alone with his sea-chest, a sail cloth
bag and a few parcels on the pavement about his feet.  It was
a dark, narrow thoroughfare he told us. A mean row of houses on
the other side looked empty: there wasn't the smallest gleam of
light in them.  The white-hot glare of a gin palace a good way
off made the intervening piece of the street pitch black.  Some
human shapes appearing mysteriously, as if they had sprung up
from the dark ground, shunned the edge of the faint light thrown
down by the gateway lamps.  These figures were wary in their movements
and perfectly silent of foot, like beasts of prey slinking about
a camp fire.  Powell gathered up his belongings and hovered over
them like a hen over her brood.  A gruffly insinuating voice said:</p>

<p>"Let's carry your things in, Capt'in!  I've got my pal 'ere."</p>

<p>He was a tall, bony, grey-haired ruffian with a bulldog jaw,
in a torn cotton shirt and moleskin trousers.  The shadow of his
hobnailed boots was enormous and coffinlike.  His pal, who didn't
come up much higher than his elbow, stepping forward exhibited
a pale face with a long drooping nose and no chin to speak of. 
He seemed to have just scrambled out of a dust-bin in a tam-o'shanter
cap and a tattered soldier's coat much too long for him.  Being
so deadly white he looked like a horrible dirty invalid in a ragged
dressing gown.  The coat flapped open in front and the rest of
his apparel consisted of one brace which crossed his naked, bony
chest, and a pair of trousers.  He blinked rapidly as if dazed
by the faint light, while his patron, the old bandit, glowered
at young Powell from under his beetling brow.</p>

<p>"Say the word, Capt'in.  The bobby'll let us in all right.  'E
knows both of us."</p>

<p>"I didn't answer him," continued Mr. Powell.  "I was listening
to footsteps on the other side of the gate, echoing between the
walls of the warehouses as if in an uninhabited town of very high
buildings dark from basement to roof.  You could never have guessed
that within a stone's throw there was an open sheet of water and
big ships lying afloat.  The few gas lamps showing up a bit of
brick work here and there, appeared in the blackness like penny
dips in a range of cellars&mdash;and the solitary footsteps came on,
tramp, tramp.  A dock policeman strode into the light on the other
side of the gate, very broad-chested and stern.</p>

<p>"Hallo!  What's up here?"</p>

<p>"He was really surprised, but after some palaver he let me in
together with the two loafers carrying my luggage.  He grumbled
at them however and slammed the gate violently with a loud clang. 
I was startled to discover how many night prowlers had collected
in the darkness of the street in such a short time and without
my being aware of it.  Directly we were through they came surging
against the bars, silent, like a mob of ugly spectres.  But suddenly,
up the street somewhere, perhaps near that public-house, a row
started as if Bedlam had broken loose: shouts, yells, an awful
shrill shriek&mdash;and at that noise all these heads vanished from
behind the bars.</p>

<p>"Look at this," marvelled the constable.  "It's a wonder to me
they didn't make off with your things while you were waiting."</p>

<p>"I would have taken good care of that," I said defiantly.  But
the constable wasn't impressed.</p>

<p>"Much you would have done.  The bag going off round one dark
corner; the chest round another.  Would you have run two ways
at once?  And anyhow you'd have been tripped up and jumped upon
before you had run three yards.  I tell you you've had a most
extraordinary chance that there wasn't one of them regular boys
about to-night, in the High Street, to twig your loaded cab go
by.  Ted here is honest . . . You are on the honest lay, Ted,
ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Always was, orficer," said the big ruffian with feeling.  The
other frail creature seemed dumb and only hopped about with the
edge of its soldier coat touching the ground.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I dare say," said the constable.  "Now then, forward,
march . . . He's that because he ain't game for the other thing,"
he confided to me.  "He hasn't got the nerve for it.  However,
I ain't going to lose sight of them two till they go out through
the gate.  That little chap's a devil.  He's got the nerve for
anything, only he hasn't got the muscle. Well!  Well!  You've
had a chance to get in with a whole skin and with all your things."</p>

<p>"I was incredulous a little.  It seemed impossible that after
getting ready with so much hurry and inconvenience I should have
lost my chance of a start in life from such a cause.  I asked:</p>

<p>"Does that sort of thing happen often so near the dock gates?"</p>

<p>"Often!  No!  Of course not often.  But it ain't often either
that a man comes along with a cabload of things to join a ship
at this time of night.  I've been in the dock police thirteen
years and haven't seen it done once."</p>

<p>"Meantime we followed my sea-chest which was being carried down
a sort of deep narrow lane, separating two high warehouses, between
honest Ted and his little devil of a pal who had to keep up a
trot to the other's stride.  The skirt of his soldier's coat floating
behind him nearly swept the ground so that he seemed to be running
on castors.  At the corner of the gloomy passage a rigged jib
boom with a dolphin-striker ending in an arrow-head stuck out
of the night close to a cast iron lamp-post.  It was the quay
side.  They set down their load in the light and honest Ted asked
hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Where's your ship, guv'nor?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know.  The constable was interested at my ignorance.</p>

<p>"Don't know where your ship is?" he asked with curiosity.  "And
you the second officer!  Haven't you been working on board of
her?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't explain that the only work connected with my appointment
was the work of chance.  I told him briefly that I didn't know
her at all.  At this he remarked:</p>

<p>"So I see.  Here she is, right before you.  That's her."</p>

<p>"At once the head-gear in the gas light inspired me with interest
and respect; the spars were big, the chains and ropes stout and
the whole thing looked powerful and trustworthy.  Barely touched
by the light her bows rose faintly alongside the narrow strip
of the quay; the rest of her was a black smudge in the darkness. 
Here I was face to face with my start in life.  We walked in a
body a few steps on a greasy pavement between her side and the
towering wall of a warehouse and I hit my shins cruelly against
the end of the gangway.  The constable hailed her quietly in a
bass undertone '<em>Ferndale</em> there!'  A feeble and dismal
sound, something in the nature of a buzzing groan, answered from
behind the bulwarks.</p>

<p>"I distinguished vaguely an irregular round knob, of wood, perhaps,
resting on the rail.  It did not move in the least; but as another
brokendown buzz like a still fainter echo of the first dismal
sound proceeded from it I concluded it must be the head of the
ship-keeper.  The stalwart constable jeered in a mock-official
manner.</p>

<p>"Second officer coming to join.  Move yourself a bit."</p>

<p>"The truth of the statement touched me in the pit of the stomach
(you know that's the spot where emotion gets home on a man) for
it was borne upon me that really and truly I was nothing but a
second officer of a ship just like any other second officer, to
that constable.  I was moved by this solid evidence of my new
dignity.  Only his tone offended me. Nevertheless I gave him the
tip he was looking for.  Thereupon he lost all interest in me,
humorous or otherwise, and walked away driving sternly before
him the honest Ted, who went off grumbling to himself like a hungry
ogre, and his horrible dumb little pal in the soldier's coat,
who, from first to last, never emitted the slightest sound.</p>

<p>"It was very dark on the quarter deck of the <em>Ferndale</em>
between the deep bulwarks overshadowed by the break of the poop
and frowned upon by the front of the warehouse.  I plumped down
on to my chest near the after hatch as if my legs had been jerked
from under me.  I felt suddenly very tired and languid.  The ship-keeper,
whom I could hardly make out hung over the capstan in a fit of
weak pitiful coughing.  He gasped out very low 'Oh! dear!  Oh!
dear!' and struggled for breath so long that I got up alarmed
and irresolute.</p>

<p>"I've been took like this since last Christmas twelvemonth. 
It ain't nothing."</p>

<p>"He seemed a hundred years old at least.  I never saw him properly
because he was gone ashore and out of sight when I came on deck
in the morning; but he gave me the notion of the feeblest creature
that ever breathed.  His voice was thin like the buzzing of a
mosquito.  As it would have been cruel to demand assistance from
such a shadowy wreck I went to work myself, dragging my chest
along a pitch-black passage under the poop deck, while he sighed
and moaned around me as if my exertions were more than his weakness
could stand.  At last as I banged pretty heavily against the bulkheads
he warned me in his faint breathless wheeze to be more careful.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" I asked rather roughly, not relishing to
be admonished by this forlorn broken-down ghost.</p>

<p>"Nothing!  Nothing, sir," he protested so hastily that he lost
his poor breath again and I felt sorry for him.  "Only the captain
and his missus are sleeping on board.  She's a lady that mustn't
be disturbed.  They came about half-past eight, and we had a permit
to have lights in the cabin till ten to-night."</p>

<p>"This struck me as a considerable piece of news.  I had never
been in a ship where the captain had his wife with him.  I'd heard
fellows say that captains' wives could work a lot of mischief
on board ship if they happened to take a dislike to anyone; especially
the new wives if young and pretty.  The old and experienced wives
on the other hand fancied they knew more about the ship than the
skipper himself and had an eye like a hawk's for what went on. 
They were like an extra chief mate of a particularly sharp and
unfeeling sort who made his report in the evening. The best of
them were a nuisance.  In the general opinion a skipper with his
wife on board was more difficult to please; but whether to show
off his authority before an admiring female or from loving anxiety
for her safety or simply from irritation at her presence&mdash;nobody
I ever heard on the subject could tell for certain.</p>

<p>"After I had bundled in my things somehow I struck a match and
had a dazzling glimpse of my berth; then I pitched the roll of
my bedding into the bunk but took no trouble to spread it out. 
I wasn't sleepy now, neither was I tired.  And the thought that
I was done with the earth for many many months to come made me
feel very quiet and self-contained as it were.  Sailors will understand
what I mean."</p>

<p>Marlow nodded.  "It is a strictly professional feeling," he commented.
"But other professions or trades know nothing of it.  It is only
this calling whose primary appeal lies in the suggestion of restless
adventure which holds out that deep sensation to those who embrace
it.  It is difficult to define, I admit."</p>

<p>"I should call it the peace of the sea," said Mr. Charles Powell
in an earnest tone but looking at us as though he expected to
be met by a laugh of derision and were half prepared to salve
his reputation for common sense by joining in it.  But neither
of us laughed at Mr. Charles Powell in whose start in life we
had been called to take a part.  He was lucky in his audience.</p>

<p>"A very good name," said Marlow looking at him approvingly. 
"A sailor finds a deep feeling of security in the exercise of
his calling.  The exacting life of the sea has this advantage
over the life of the earth that its claims are simple and cannot
be evaded."</p>

<p>"Gospel truth," assented Mr. Powell.  "No! they cannot be evaded."</p>

<p>That an excellent understanding should have established itself
between my old friend and our new acquaintance was remarkable
enough.  For they were exactly dissimilar&mdash;one individuality projecting
itself in length and the other in breadth, which is already a
sufficient ground for irreconcilable difference.  Marlow who was
lanky, loose, quietly composed in varied shades of brown robbed
of every vestige of gloss, had a narrow, veiled glance, the neutral
bearing and the secret irritability which go together with a predisposition
to congestion of the liver.  The other, compact, broad and sturdy
of limb, seemed extremely full of sound organs functioning vigorously
all the time in order to keep up the brilliance of his colouring,
the light curl of his coal-black hair and the lustre of his eyes,
which asserted themselves roundly in an open, manly face. Between
two such organisms one would not have expected to find the slightest
temperamental accord.  But I have observed that profane men living
in ships like the holy men gathered together in monasteries develop
traits of profound resemblance.  This must be because the service
of the sea and the service of a temple are both detached from
the vanities and errors of a world which follows no severe rule. 
The men of the sea understand each other very well in their view
of earthly things, for simplicity is a good counsellor and isolation
not a bad educator.  A turn of mind composed of innocence and
scepticism is common to them all, with the addition of an unexpected
insight into motives, as of disinterested lookers-on at a game. 
Mr. Powell took me aside to say,</p>

<p>"I like the things he says."</p>

<p>"You understand each other pretty well," I observed.</p>

<p>"I know his sort," said Powell, going to the window to look at
his cutter still riding to the flood.  "He's the sort that's always
chasing some notion or other round and round his head just for
the fun of the thing."</p>

<p>"Keeps them in good condition," I said.</p>

<p>"Lively enough I dare say," he admitted.</p>

<p>"Would you like better a man who let his notions lie curled up?"</p>

<p>"That I wouldn't," answered our new acquaintance.  Clearly he
was not difficult to get on with.  "I like him, very well," he
continued, "though it isn't easy to make him out.  He seems to
be up to a thing or two. What's he doing?"</p>

<p>I informed him that our friend Marlow had retired from the sea
in a sort of half-hearted fashion some years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. Powell's comment was: "Fancied had enough of it?"</p>

<p>"Fancied's the very word to use in this connection," I observed,
remembering the subtly provisional character of Marlow's long
sojourn amongst us.  From year to year he dwelt on land as a bird
rests on the branch of a tree, so tense with the power of brusque
flight into its true element that it is incomprehensible why it
should sit still minute after minute.  The sea is the sailor's
true element, and Marlow, lingering on shore, was to me an object
of incredulous commiseration like a bird, which, secretly, should
have lost its faith in the high virtue of flying.</p>
