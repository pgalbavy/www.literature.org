The foregoing is a sample roaming with the White Logic through the
dusk of my soul.
<P>
To the best of my power I have striven to give the reader a
glimpse of a man's secret dwelling when it is shared with John
Barleycorn.  And the reader must remember that this mood, which he
has read in a quarter of an hour, is but one mood of the myriad
moods of John Barleycorn, and that the procession of such moods
may well last the clock around through many a day and week and
month.
<P>
My alcoholic reminiscences draw to a close.  I can say, as any
strong, chesty drinker can say, that all that leaves me alive to-
day on the planet is my unmerited luck--the luck of chest, and
shoulders, and constitution.  I dare to say that a not large
percentage of youths, in the formative stage of fifteen to
seventeen, could have survived the stress of heavy drinking that I
survived between my fifteenth and seventeenth years; that a not
large percentage of men could have punished the alcohol I have
punished in my manhood years and lived to tell the tale.  I
survived, through no personal virtue, but because I did not have
the chemistry of a dipsomaniac and because I possessed an organism
unusually resistant to the ravages of John Barleycorn.  And,
surviving, I have watched the others die, not so lucky, down all
the long sad road.
<P>
It was my unmitigated and absolute good fortune, good luck,
chance, call it what you will, that brought me through the fires
of John Barleycorn.  My life, my career, my joy in living, have
not been destroyed.  They have been scorched, it is true; like the
survivors of forlorn hopes, they have by unthinkably miraculous
ways come through the fight to marvel at the tally of the slain.
<P>
And like such a survivor of old red war who cries out, "Let there
be no more war!" so I cry out, "Let there be no more poison-
fighting by our youths!" The way to stop war is to stop it.  The
way to stop drinking is to stop it.  The way China stopped the
general use of opium was by stopping the cultivation and
importation of opium.  The philosophers, priests, and doctors of
China could have preached themselves breathless against opium for
a thousand years, and the use of opium, so long as opium was ever
accessible and obtainable, would have continued unabated.  We are
so made, that is all.
<P>
We have with great success made a practice of not leaving arsenic
and strychnine, and typhoid and tuberculosis germs lying around
for our children to be destroyed by.  Treat John Barleycorn the
same way.  Stop him.  Don't let him lie around, licensed and
legal, to pounce upon our youth.  Not of alcoholics nor for
alcoholics do I write, but for our youths, for those who possess
no more than the adventure-stings and the genial predispositions,
the social man-impulses, which are twisted all awry by our
barbarian civilisation which feeds them poison on all the corners. 
It is the healthy, normal boys, now born or being born, for whom I
write.
<P>
It was for this reason, more than any other, and more ardently
than any other, that I rode down into the Valley of the Moon, all
a-jingle, and voted for equal suffrage.  I voted that women might
vote, because I knew that they, the wives and mothers of the race, 
would vote John Barleycorn out of existence and back into the
historical limbo of our vanished customs of savagery.  If I thus
seem to cry out as one hurt, please remember that I have been
sorely bruised and that I do dislike the thought that any son or
daughter of mine or yours should be similarly bruised.
<P>
The women are the true conservators of the race.  The men are the
wastrels, the adventure-lovers and gamblers, and in the end it is
by their women that they are saved.  About man's first experiment
in chemistry was the making of alcohol, and down all the
generations to this day man has continued to manufacture and drink
it.  And there has never been a day when the women have not
resented man's use of alcohol, though they have never had the
power to give weight to their resentment.  The moment women get
the vote in any community, the first thing they proceed to do is
to close the saloons.  In a thousand generations to come men of
themselves will not close the saloons.  As well expect the
morphine victims to legislate the sale of morphine out of
existence.
<P>
The women know.  They have paid an incalculable price of sweat and
tears for man's use of alcohol.  Ever jealous for the race, they
will legislate for the babes of boys yet to be born; and for the
babes of girls, too, for they must be the mothers, wives, and
sisters of these boys.
<P>
And it will be easy.  The only ones that will be hurt will be the
topers and seasoned drinkers of a single generation.  I am one of
these, and I make solemn assurance, based upon long traffic with
John Barleycorn, that it won't hurt me very much to stop drinking
when no one else drinks and when no drink is obtainable.  On the
other hand, the overwhelming proportion of young men are so
normally non-alcoholic, that, never having had access to alcohol,
they will never miss it.  They will know of the saloon only in the
pages of history, and they will think of the saloon as a quaint
old custom similar to bull-baiting and the burning of witches.
