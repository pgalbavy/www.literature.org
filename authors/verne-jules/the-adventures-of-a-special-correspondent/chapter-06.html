<article class="w3-container w3-justify">

<P>The ideas of a man on horseback are different to those which occur to him
when he is on foot. The difference is even more noticeable when he is on the
railway. The association of his thoughts, the character of his reflections are
all affected by the speed of the train. They &quot;roll&quot; in his head, as he rolls in
his car. And so it comes about that I am in a particularly lively mood, desirous
of observing, greedy of instruction, and that at a speed of thirty-one miles an
hour. That is the rate at which we are to travel through Turkestan, and when we
reach the Celestial Empire we shall have to be content with eighteen.</P>
<P>That is what I have just ascertained by consulting my time-table, which I
bought at the station. It is accompanied by a long slip map, folded and refolded
on itself, which shows the whole length of the line between the Caspian and the
eastern coast of China. I study, then, my Transasiatic, on leaving Uzun Ada,
just as I studied my Transgeorgian when I left Tiflis.</P>
<P>The gauge of the line is about sixty-three inches&mdash;as is usual on the Russian
lines, which are thus about four inches wider than those of other European
countries. It is said, with regard to this, that the Germans have made a great
number of axles of this length, in case they have to invade Russia. I should
like to think that the Russians have taken the same precautions in the no less
probable event of their having to invade Germany.</P>
<P>On either side of the line are long sandhills, between which the train runs
out from Uzun Ada; when it reaches the arm of the sea which separates Long
Island from the continent, it crosses an embankment about 1,200 yards long,
edged with masses of rock to protect it against the violence of the waves.</P>
<P>We have already passed several stations without stopping, among others
Mikhailov, a league from Uzun Ada. Now they are from ten to eleven miles apart.
Those I have seen, as yet, look like villas, with balustrades and Italian roofs,
which has a curious effect in Turkestan and the neighborhood of Persia. The
desert extends up to the neighborhood of Uzun Ada, and the railway stations form
so many little oases, made by the hand of man. It is man, in fact, who has
planted these slender, sea-green poplars, which give so little shade; it is man
who, at great expense, has brought here the water whose refreshing jets fall
back into an elegant vase. Without these hydraulic works there would not be a
tree, not a corner of green in these oases. They are the nurses of the line, and
dry-nurses are of no use to locomotives.</P>
<P>The truth is that I have never seen such a bare, arid country, so clear of
vegetation; and it extends for one hundred and fifty miles from Uzun Ada. When
General Annenkof commenced his works at Mikhailov, he was obliged to distil the
water from the Caspian Sea, as if he were on board ship. But if water is
necessary to produce steam, coal is necessary to vaporize the water. The readers
of the <I>Twentieth Century</I> will ask how are the furnaces fed in a country
in which there is neither coal nor wood? Are there stores of these things at the
principal stations of the Transcaspian? Not at all. They have simply put in
practice an idea which occurred to our great chemist, Sainte-Claire Deville,
when first petroleum was used in France. The furnaces are fed, by the aid of a
pulverizing apparatus, with the residue produced from the distillation of the
naphtha, which Baku and Derbent produce in such inexhaustible quantities. At
certain stations on the line there are vast reservoirs of this combustible
mineral, from which the tenders are filled, and it is burned in specially
adapted fireboxes. In a similar way naphtha is used on the steamboats on the
Volga and the other affluents of the Caspian.</P>
<P>I repeat, the country is not particularly varied. The ground is nearly flat
in the sandy districts, and quite flat in the alluvial plains, where the
brackish water stagnates in pools. Nothing could be better for a line of
railway. There are no cuttings, no embankments, no viaducts, no works of art&mdash;to
use a term dear to engineers, very &quot;dear,&quot; I should say. Here and there are a
few wooden bridges from two hundred to three hundred feet long. Under such
circumstances the cost per kilometre of the Transcaspian did not exceed
seventy-five thousand francs.</P>
<P>The monotony of the journey would only be broken on the vast oases of Merv,
Bokhara and Samarkand.</P>
<P>But let us busy ourselves with the passengers, as we can do all the more
easily from our being able to walk from one end to the other of the train. With
a little imagination we can make ourselves believe we are in a sort of traveling
village, and I am just going to take a run down main street.</P>
<P>Remember that the engine and tender are followed by the van at the angle of
which is placed the mysterious case, and that Popof&apos;s compartment is in the
left-hand corner of the platform of the first car.</P>
<P>Inside this car I notice a few Sarthes of tall figure and haughty face,
draped in their long robes of bright colors, from beneath which appear the
braided leather boots. They have splendid eyes, a superb beard, arched nose, and
you would take them for real lords, provided we ignore the word Sarthe, which
means a pedlar, and these were going evidently to Tachkend, where these pedlars
swarm.</P>
<P>In this car the two Chinese have taken their places, opposite each other. The
young Celestial looks out of window. The old one&mdash;Ta-lao-ye, that is to say, a
person well advanced in years&mdash;is incessantly turning over the pages of his book.
This volume, a small 32mo, looks like our <I>Annuaire du Bureau des
Longitudes</I>, and is covered in plush, like a breviary, and when it is shut
its covers are kept in place by an elastic band. What astonishes me is that the
proprietor of this little book does not seem to read it from right to left. Is
it not written in Chinese characters? We must see into this!</P>
<P>On two adjoining seats are Ephrinell and Miss Horatia Bluett. Their talk is
of nothing but figures. I don&apos;t know if the practical American murmurs at the
ear of the practical Englishwoman the adorable verse which made the heart of
Lydia palpitate:</P>
<P align=center>&quot;Nee tecum possum vivere sine te,&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;</P>
<P class=normal>but I do know that Ephrinell can very well live without me. I
have been quite right in not reckoning on his company to charm away the tedium
of the journey. The Yankee has completely &quot;left&quot; me&mdash;that is the word&mdash;for this
angular daughter of Albion.</P>
<P>I reach the platform. I cross the gangway and I am at the door of the second
car.</P>
<P>In the right-hand corner is Baron Weissschnitzerd√∂rfer. His long nose&mdash;this
Teuton is as short-sighted as a mole&mdash;rubs the lines of the book he reads. The
book is the timetable. The impatient traveler is ascertaining if the train
passes the stations at the stated time. Whenever it is behind there are new
recriminations and menaces against the Grand Transasiatic Company.</P>
<P>In this car there are also the Caternas, who have made themselves quite
comfortable. In his cheery way, the husband is talking with a good deal of
gesticulation, sometimes touching his wife&apos;s hands, sometimes putting his arms
round her waist; and then he turns his head toward the platform and says
something aside. Madame Caterna leans toward him, makes little confused
grimaces, and then leans back into the corner and seems to reply to her husband,
who in turn replies to her. And as I leave I hear the chorus of an operetta in
the deep voice of Monsieur Caterna.</P>
<P>In the third car, occupied by many Turkomans and three or four Russians, I
perceive Major Noltitz. He is talking with one of his countrymen. I will
willingly join in their conversation if they make me any advances, but I had
better maintain a certain reserve; the journey has only begun.</P>
<P>I then visit the dining car. It is a third longer than the other cars, a
regular dining room, with one long table. At the back is a pantry on one side, a
kitchen on the other, where the cook and steward are at work, both of them
Russians. This dining car appears to me capitally arranged. Passing through it,
I reach the second part of the train, where the second-class passengers are
installed. Kirghizes who do not look very intelligent with their depressed
heads, their prognathous jaws stuck well out in front, their little beards, flat
Cossack noses and very brown skins. These wretched fellows are Mahometans and
belong either to the Grand Horde wandering on the frontier between China and
Siberia, or to the Little Horde between the Ural Mountains and the Aral Sea. A
second-class car, or even a third-class car, is a palace for these people,
accustomed to the encampments on the Steppes, to the miserable &quot;iourts&quot; of
villages. Neither their beds nor their seats are as good as the stuffed benches
on which they have seated themselves with true Asiatic gravity.</P>
<P>With them are two or three Nogais going to Eastern Turkestan. Of a higher
race than the Kirghizes, being Tartars, it is from them that come the learned
men and professors who have made illustrious the opulent cities of Bokhara and
Samarkand. But science and its teaching do not yield much of a livelihood, even
when reduced to the mere necessaries of life, in these provinces of Central
Asia. And so these Nogais take employment as interpreters. Unfortunately, since
the diffusion of the Russian language, their trade is not very remunerative.</P>
<P>Now I know the places of my numbers, and I know where to find them when I
want them. As to those going through to Pekin, I have no doubt of Ephrinell and
Miss Horatia Bluett nor the German baron, nor the two Chinese, nor Major
Noltitz, nor the Caternas, nor even for the haughty gentleman whose bony outline
I perceive in the corner of the second car.</P>
<P>As to these travelers who are not going across the frontier, they are of most
perfect insignificance in my eyes. But among my companions I have not yet found
the hero of my chronicle! let us hope he will declare himself as we proceed.</P>
<P>My intention is to take notes hour by hour&mdash;what did I say? To &quot;minute&quot; my
journey. Before the night closes in I go out on the platform of the car to have
a last look at the surrounding country. An hour with my cigar will take me to
Kizil Arvat, where the train has to stop for some time. In going from the second
to the first car I meet Major Noltitz. I step aside to let him pass. He salutes
me with that grace which distinguishes well-bred Russians. I return his salute.
Our meeting is restricted to this exchange of politeness, but the first step is
taken.</P>
<P>Popof is not just now in his seat. The door of the luggage van being open, I
conclude that the guard has gone to talk with the driver. On the left of the van
the mysterious box is in its place. It is only half-past six as yet, and there
is too much daylight for me to risk the gratification of my curiosity.</P>
<P>The train advances through the open desert. This is the Kara Koum, the Black
Desert. It extends from Khiva over all Turkestan comprised between the Persian
frontier and the course of the Amou Daria. In reality the sands of the Kara Koum
are no more black than the waters of the Black Sea or than those of the White
Sea are white, those of the Red Sea red, or those of the Yellow River yellow.
But I like these colored distinctions, however erroneous they may be. In
landscapes the eye is caught by colors. And is there not a good deal of
landscape about geography?</P>
<P>It appears that this desert was formerly occupied by a huge central basin. It
has dried up, as the Caspian will dry up, and this evaporation is explained by
the powerful concentration of the solar rays on the surface of the territories
between the Sea of Aral and the Plateau of the Pamir.</P>
<P>The Kara Koum is formed of low sandy hills which the high winds are
constantly shifting and forming. These &quot;barkans,&quot; as the Russians call them,
vary in height from thirty to ninety feet. They expose a wide surface to the
northern hurricanes which drive them gradually southward. And on this account
there is a well-justified fear for the safety of the Transcaspian. It had to be
protected in some efficacious way, and General Annenkof would have been much
embarrassed if provident Nature had not, at the same time as she gave the land
favorable for the railway to be laid along, given the means of stopping the
shifting of the barkanes.</P>
<P>Behind these sand hills grow a number of spring shrubs, clumps of tamarisk,
star thistles, and that <I>Haloxylon ammodendron</I> which Russians call, not so
scientifically, &quot;saksaoul.&quot; Its deep, strong roots are as well adapted for
binding together the ground as those of <I>Hippopha√´ rhamnoides</I>, an arbutus
of the Eleagnaceous family, which is used for binding together the sands in
southern Europe.</P>
<P>To these plantations of saksaouls the engineers of the line have added in
different places a series of slopes of worked clay, and in the most dangerous
places a line of palisades.</P>
<P>These precautions are doubtless of use; but if the road is protected, the
passengers are hardly so, when the sand flies like a bullet hail, and the wind
sweeps up from the plain the whitish efflorescences of salt. It is a good thing
for us that we are not in the height of the hot season; and it is not in June or
July or August that I would advise you to take a trip on the Grand
Transasiatic.</P>
<P>I am sorry that Major Noltitz does not think of coming out on the gangway to
breathe the fresh air of the Kara Koum. I would offer him one of those choice
regalias with which my case is well provided. He would tell me if these stations
I see on my time-table, Balla-Ischem, A√Ødine, Pereval, Kansandjik, Ouchak, are
of any interest&mdash;which they do not seem to be. But it would not do for me to
disturb his siesta. And yet his conversation ought to be interesting, for as a
surgeon in the Russian army he took part in the campaigns of Generals Skobeleff
and Annenkof. When our train ran through the little stations that it honors only
with a whistle, he could tell me if this one or that one had been the scene of
any incident of the war. As a Frenchman I am justified in questioning him about
the Russian expedition across Turkestan, and I have no doubt that my fellow
passenger will be pleased to gratify me. He is the only one I can really trust
besides Popof.</P>
<P>But why is Popof not in his seat? He also is not insensible to the charms of
a cigar. It would seem that his conversation with the engineer has not finished
yet.</P>
<P>Ah! Here he is coming from the front of the luggage van. He comes out of it
and shuts the door; he remains for a moment and is about to take a seat. A hand
which holds a cigar, is stretched out toward him. Popof smiles and soon his
perfumed puffs are mingling voluptuously with mine.</P>
<P>For fifteen years I think I said our guard had been in the Transcaspian
service. He knows the country up to the Chinese frontier, and five or six times
already he has been over the whole line known as the Grand Transasiatic.</P>
<P>Popof was on duty on the section between Mikhailov and Kizil Arvat when the
line opened&mdash;a section which was begun in the December of 1880 and finished in
ten months, in November, 1881. Five years later the locomotive entered Merv, on
the 14th July, 1886, and eighteen months later it was welcomed at Samarkand. Now
the road through Turkestan joins the road through the Celestial Empire, and the
ribbon of iron extends without interruption from the Caspian Sea to Pekin.</P>
<P>When Popof had given me this information, I asked if he knew anything of our
fellow travelers, I meant those who were going through to China. And in the
first place of Major Noltitz?</P>
<P>&quot;The major,&quot; said Popof, &quot;has lived a long time in the Turkestan provinces,
and he is going to Pekin to organize the staff of a hospital for our
compatriots, with the permission of the Czar, of course.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I like this Major Noltitz,&quot; I said, &quot;and I hope to make his acquaintance
very soon.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He would be equally pleased to make yours,&quot; replied Popof.</P>
<P>&quot;And these two Chinese, do you know them?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not in the least, Monsieur Bombarnac; all I know is the name on the
luggage.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is that?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The younger man&apos;s name is Pan-Chao, the elder&apos;s is Tio-King. Probably they
have been traveling in Europe for some years. As to saying where they come from,
I cannot. I imagine that Pan-Chao belongs to some rich family, for he is
accompanied by his doctor.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This Tio-King?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, Doctor Tio-King.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And do they only speak Chinese?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Probably; I have not heard them speak any other language together.&quot;</P>
<P>On this information from Popof, I will keep to the number nine I have given
to young Pan-Chao, and to the ten with which I have labelled Doctor
Tio-King.</P>
<P>&quot;The American,&quot; began Popof.</P>
<P>&quot;Ephrinell?&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;and Miss Horatia Bluett, the Englishwoman? Oh! You
can tell me nothing about them I don&apos;t know.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Shall I tell you what I think about that couple, Monsieur Bombarnac?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you think?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That as soon as they reach Pekin, Miss Bluett will become Mrs.
Ephrinell.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And may Heaven bless their union, Popof, for they are really made for each
other.&quot;</P>
<P>I saw that on this subject Popof and I held similar ideas.</P>
<P>&quot;And the two French people, that couple so affectionate.&quot; I asked, &quot;who are
they?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Have they not told you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, Popof.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You need not be anxious, Monsieur Bombarnac. Besides, if you wish to know
their profession, it is written at full length on all their luggage.</P>
<P>&quot;And that is?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Stage people who are going to a theater in China.&quot;</P>
<P>Stage people! If that explains the attitudes, and mobile physiognomy, and
demonstrative gestures of Caterna, it does not explain his maritime
allusions.</P>
<P>&quot;And do you know what line these players are in?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The husband is comic lead.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And the wife?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;She is leading lady.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And where are these lyrical people going?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To Shanghai, where they have an engagement at the French theater.&quot;</P>
<P>That is capital. I will talk about the theater, and behind the scenes, and
such matters, and, as Popof said, I shall soon make the acquaintance of the
cheery comedian and his charming wife. But it is not in their company that I
shall discover the hero of romance who is the object of my desire.</P>
<P>As to the scornful gentleman, our guide knew nothing beyond that his luggage
bore the address in full: Sir Francis Trevellyan, Trevellyan Hall,
Trevellyanshire.</P>
<P>&quot;A gentleman who does not answer when he is spoken to!&quot; added Popof.</P>
<P>Well, my number eight will have to be dumb man, and that will do very
well.</P>
<P>&quot;Now we get to the German,&quot; said I.</P>
<P>&quot;Baron Weissschnitzerd√∂rfer?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He is going to Pekin, I think.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To Pekin and beyond.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Beyond?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; he is on a trip round the world.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A trip round the world?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In thirty-nine days.&quot;</P>
<P>And so after Mrs. Bisland who did the famous tour in seventy-three days, and
Train who did it in seventy, this German was attempting to do it in
thirty-nine?</P>
<P>True, the means of communication are more rapid the line is more direct, and
by using the Grand Transasiatic which puts Pekin within a fortnight of the
Prussian capital, the baron might halve the old time by Suez and
Singapore&mdash;but&mdash;</P>
<P>&quot;He will never do it!&quot; I exclaimed.</P>
<P>&quot;Why not?&quot; asked Popof.</P>
<P>&quot;Because he is always late. He nearly missed the train at Tiflis, he nearly
missed the boat at Baku&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But he did not miss the start from Uzun Ada.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter, Popof. I shall be much surprised if this German beats an
American at globe trotting.&quot;</P>
