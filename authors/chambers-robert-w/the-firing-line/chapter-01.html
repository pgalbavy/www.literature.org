<p>As the wind veered and grew cooler a ribbon of haze appeared
above the Gulf-stream.</p>

<p>Young Hamil, resting on his oars, gazed absently into the creeping
mist. Under it the ocean sparkled with subdued brilliancy; through
it, shoreward, green palms and palmettos turned silvery; and,
as the fog spread, the sea-pier, the vast white hotel, bathing-house,
cottage, pavilion, faded to phantoms tinted with rose and pearl.</p>

<p>Leaning there on his oars, he could still make out the distant
sands flecked with the colours of sunshades and bathing-skirts;
the breeze dried his hair and limbs, but his swimming-shirt and
trunks still dripped salt water.</p>

<p>Inshore a dory of the beach guard drifted along the outer line
of breakers beyond which the more adventurous bathers were diving
from an anchored raft. Still farther out moving dots indicated
the progress of hardier swimmers; one in particular, a girl capped
with a brilliant red kerchief, seemed to be already nearer to
Hamil than to the shore.</p>

<p>It was all very new and interesting to him&mdash;the shore with its
spectral palms and giant caravansary, the misty, opalescent sea
where a white steam-yacht lay anchored north of him&mdash;the <em>Ariani</em>&mdash;from
which he had come, and on board of which the others were still
doubtless asleep &mdash;Portlaw, Malcourt, and Wayward. And at
thought of the others he yawned and moistened his lips, still
feverish from last night's unwisdom; and leaning forward on his
oars, sat brooding, cradled by the flowing motion of the sea.</p>

<p>The wind was still drawing into the north; he felt it, never
strong, but always a little cooler, in his hair and on his wet
swimming-shirt. The flat cloud along the Gulf-stream spread thickly
coastward, and after a little while the ghosts of things terrestrial
disappeared.</p>

<p>All around him, now, blankness&mdash;save for the gray silhouette
of the <em>Ariani</em>. A colourless canopy surrounded him, centred
by a tiny pool of ocean. Overhead through the vanishing blue,
hundreds of wild duck were stringing out to sea; under his tent
of fog the tarnished silver of the water formed a floor smoothly
unquiet.</p>

<p>Sounds from the land, hitherto unheard, now came strangely distinct;
the cries of bathers, laughter, the muffled shock of the surf,
doubled and redoubled along the sands; the barking of a dog at
the water's edge. Clear and near sounded the ship's bell on the
<em>Ariani</em>; a moment's rattle of block and tackle, a dull
call, answered; and silence. Through which, without a sound, swept
a great bird with scarce a beat of its spread wings; and behind
it, another, and, at exact intervals another and another in impressive
processional, sailing majestically through the fog; white pelicans
winging inland to the lagoons.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the wind, which had become fitful, suddenly
grew warm. All around him now the mist was dissolving into a thin
golden rain; the land-breeze freshened, blowing through distant
jasmine thickets and orange groves, and a soft fragrance stole
out over the sea.</p>

<p>As the sun broke through in misty splendour, the young man, brooding
on his oars, closed his eyes; and at the same instant his boat
careened violently, almost capsizing as a slender wet shape clambered
aboard and dropped into the bows. As the boat heeled under the
shock Hamil had instinctively flung his whole weight against the
starboard gunwale. Now he recovered his oars and his balance at
the same time, and, as he swung half around, his unceremonious
visitor struggled to sit upright, still fighting for breath.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," she managed to say; "may I rest here? I
am&mdash;" She stopped short; a flash of sudden recognition came into
her eyes&mdash;flickered, and faded. It was evident to him that, for
a moment, she thought she had met him before.</p>

<p>"Of course you may stay here," he said, inclined to laugh.</p>

<p>She settled down, stretching slightly backward as though to give
her lungs fuller play. In a little while her breathing grew more
regular; her eyes closed for a moment, then opened thoughtfully,
skyward.</p>

<p>Hamil's curious and half-amused gaze rested on her as he resumed
the oars. But when he turned his back and headed the boat shoreward
a quick protest checked him, and oars at rest, he turned again,
looking inquiringly at her over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I am only rowing you back to the beach," he said.</p>

<p>"Don't row me in; I am perfectly able to swim back."</p>

<p>"No doubt," he returned drily, "but haven't you played tag with
Death sufficiently for one day?"</p>

<p>"Death?" She dismissed the grotesque suggestion with a shrug,
then straightened up, breathing freely and deeply. "It is an easy
swim," she remarked, occupied with her wet hair under the knotted
scarlet; "the fog confused me; that was all."</p>

<p>"And how long could you have kept afloat if the fog had not lifted?"
he inquired with gentle sarcasm. To which, adroitly adjusting
hair and kerchief, she made no answer. So he added: "There is
supposed to be a difference between mature courage and the fool-hardiness
of the unfledged&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>The quick close-clipped question cutting his own words silenced
him. And, as he made no reply, she continued to twist the red
kerchief around her hair, and to knot it securely, her doubtful
glance returning once or twice to his amused face.</p>

<p>When all had been made fast and secure she rested one arm on
the gunwale and dropped the other across her knees, relaxing in
every muscle a moment before departure. And, somehow, to Hamil,
the unconscious grace of the attitude suggested the "Resting Hermes"&mdash;that
sculptured concentration of suspended motion.</p>

<p>"You had better not go just yet," he said, pointing seaward.</p>

<p>She also had been watching the same thing that he was now looking
at, a thin haze which again became apparent over the Gulf-stream.</p>

<p>"Do you think it will thicken?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know; you had a close call last time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There was no danger."</p>

<p>"I think there was danger enough; you were apparently headed
straight out to sea&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I heard a ship's bell and swam toward it, and when the fog lifted
I found you."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you swim toward the shore? You could hear the surf&mdash;and
a dog barking."</p>

<p>"I"&mdash;she turned pink with annoyance&mdash;"I suppose I was a trifle
tired&mdash;if you insist. I realised that I had lost my bearings;
that was all. Then I heard a ship's bell.... Then the mist lifted
and I saw you&mdash;but I've explained all that before. <em>Look</em>
at that exasperating fog!"</p>

<p>Vexation silenced her; she sat restless for a few seconds, then:</p>

<p>"What do you think I had better do?"</p>

<p>"I think you had better try to endure me for a few minutes longer.
I'm safer than the fog."</p>

<p>But his amusement left her unresponsive, plainly occupied with
her own ideas.</p>

<p>Again the tent of vapour stretched its magic folds above the
boat and around it; again the shoreward shapes faded to phantoms
and disappeared.</p>

<p>He spoke again once or twice, but her brief replies did not encourage
him. At first, he concluded that her inattention and indifference
must be due to self-consciousness; then, slightly annoyed, he
decided they were not. And, very gradually, he began to realise
that the unconventional, always so attractive to the casual young
man, did not interest her at all, even enough to be aware of it
or of him.</p>

<p>This cool unconsciousness of self, of him, of a situation which
to any wholesome masculine mind contained the germs of humour,
romance, and all sorts of amusing possibilities, began to be a
little irksome to him. And still her aloofness amused him, too.</p>

<p>"Do you know of any decorous reason why we should not talk to
each other occasionally during this fog?" he asked.</p>

<p>She turned her head, considered him inattentively, then turned
it away again.</p>

<p>"No," she said indifferently; "what did you desire to say?"</p>

<p>Resting on his oars, the unrequited smile still forlornly edging
his lips, he looked at his visitor, who was staring into the fog,
lost in her own reflections; and never a glimmer in her eyes,
never a quiver of lid or lash betrayed any consciousness of his
gaze or even of his presence. And he continued to inspect her
with increasing annoyance.</p>

<p>The smooth skin, the vivid lips slightly upcurled, the straight
delicate nose, the cheeks so smoothly rounded where the dark thick
lashes swept their bloom as she looked downward at the water&mdash;all
this was abstractly beautiful; very lovely, too, the full column
of the neck, and the rounded arms guiltless of sunburn or tan.</p>

<p>So unusually white were both neck and arms that Hamil ventured
to speak of it, politely, asking her if this was not her first
swim that season.</p>

<p>Voice and question roused her from abstraction; she turned toward
him, then glanced down at her unstained skin.</p>

<p>"My first swim?" she repeated; "oh, you mean my arms? No, I never
burn; they change very little." Straightening up she sat looking
across the boat at him without visible interest at first, then
doubtfully, as though in an effort to say something polite.</p>

<p>"I am really very grateful to you for letting me sit here. Please
don't feel obliged to amuse me during this annoying fog."</p>

<p>"Thank you; you <em>are</em> rather difficult to talk to. But
I don't mind trying at judicious intervals," he said, laughing.</p>

<p>She considered him askance. "If you wish to row in, do so. I
did not mean to keep you here at sea&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I belong out here; I'm from the <em>Ariani</em> yonder;
you heard her bell in the fog. We came from Nassau last night....
Have you ever been to Nassau?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded listlessly and glanced at the white yacht, now
becoming visible through the thinning mist. Somewhere above in
the viewless void an aura grew and spread into a blinding glory;
and all around, once more, the fog turned into floating golden
vapour shot with rain.</p>

<p>The girl placed both hands on the gunwales as though preparing
to rise.</p>

<p>"Not yet!" said Hamil sharply.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?"&mdash;looking up surprised, still poised lightly
on both palms as though checked at the instant of rising into
swift aërial flight&mdash;so light, so buoyant she appeared.</p>

<p>"Don't go overboard," he repeated.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I'm going to row you in."</p>

<p>"I wish to swim; I prefer it."</p>

<p>"I am only going to take you to the float&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I don't care to have you. I am perfectly able to swim in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know you are," he said, swinging clear around in his seat
to face her, "but I put it in the form of a request; will you
be kind enough to let me row you part way to the float? This fog
is not ended."</p>

<p>She opened her lips to protest; indeed, for a moment it looked
as if she were going overboard without further argument; then
perhaps some belated idea of civility due him for the hospitality
of his boat restrained her.</p>

<p>"You understand, of course, that I am quite able to swim in,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Yes; may I now row you part way? The fog is closing in again."</p>

<p>She yielded with a pretty indifference, none the less charming
because there was no flattery in it for him. He now sat facing
her, pushing his oars through the water; and she stole a curious
glance at his features&mdash;slightly sullen for the moment&mdash;noticing
his well-set, well-shaped head and good shoulders.</p>

<p>That fugitive glance confirmed the impression of recognition
in her mind. He was what she had expected in breeding and physique&mdash;the
type usually to be met with where the world can afford to take
its leisure.</p>

<p>As he was not looking at her she ventured to continue her inspection,
leaning back, and dropping her bare arm alongside, to trail her
fingers through the sunlit water.</p>

<p>"Have we not rowed far enough?" she asked presently. "This fog
is apparently going to last forever."</p>

<p>"Like your silence," he said gaily.</p>

<p>Raising her eyes in displeasure she met his own frankly amused.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you," he asked, "exactly why I insisted on rowing
you in? I'm afraid"&mdash;he glanced at her with the quick smile breaking
again on his lips&mdash;"I'm afraid you don't care whether I tell you
or not. Do you?"</p>

<p>"If you ask me &mdash;I really don't," she said. "And, by the
way, do you know that if you turned around properly and faced
the stern you could make better progress with your oars?"</p>

<p>"By 'better' do you mean <em>quicker</em> progress?" he asked,
so naïvely that she concluded he was a trifle stupid. The best-looking
ones were usually stupid.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," she said, impatient. "It's all very well to
push a punt across a mill-pond that way, but it's not treating
the Atlantic with very much respect."</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> were not particularly respectful toward the Atlantic
Ocean when you started to swim across it."</p>

<p>But again the echo of amusement in his voice found no response
in her unsmiling silence.</p>

<p>He thought to himself: "Is she a prude, or merely stupid! The
pity of it!&mdash;with her eyes of a thinking goddess!&mdash;and no ideas
behind them! What she understands is the commonplace. Let us offer
her the obvious."</p>

<p>And, aloud, fatuously: "This is a rarely beautiful scene&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" crisply.</p>

<p>And feeling mildly wicked he continued:</p>

<p>&mdash;"Soft skies, a sea of Ionian azure; one might almost expect
to see a triareme heading up yonder out of the south, festooned
with the golden fleece. This is just the sort of a scene for a
triareme; don't you think so?"</p>

<p>Her reply was the slightest possible nod.</p>

<p>He looked at her meanly amused:</p>

<p>"It's really very classical," he said, "like the voyage of Ulysses;
I, Ulysses, you the water nymph Calypso, drifting in that golden
ship of Romance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Calypso was a <em>land</em> nymph," she observed, absently,
"if accuracy interests you as much as your monologue."</p>

<p>Checked and surprised, he began to laugh at his own discomfiture;
and she, elbow on the gunwale, small hand cupping her chin, watched
him with an expressionless directness that very soon extinguished
his amusement and left him awkward in the silence.</p>

<p>"I've tried my very best to be civil and agreeable," he said
after a moment. "Is it really such an effort for you to talk to
a man?"</p>

<p>"Not if I am interested," she said quietly.</p>

<p>He felt that his ears were growing red; she noticed it, too,
and added: "I do not mean to be <em>too</em> rude; and I am quite
sure you do not either."</p>

<p>"Of course not," he said; "only I couldn't help seeing the humour
of romance in our ocean encounter. I think anybody would&mdash;except
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>The crisp, quick question which, with her, usually seemed like
an exclamation, always startled him into temporary silence; then
he began more carefully:</p>

<p>"There was one chance in a million of your finding my boat in
the fog. If you hadn't found it&mdash;" He shook his head. "And so
I wish you might recognise in our encounter something amusing,
humourous"&mdash;he looked cautiously at her&mdash;"even mildly romantic&mdash;ah&mdash;enough
to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To what?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;to say&mdash;to do something characteristically&mdash;ah&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>" &mdash;Human!" he ventured&mdash;quite prepared to see her rise
wrathfully and go overboard.</p>

<p>Instead she remained motionless, those clear, disconcerting eyes
fixed steadily on him. Once or twice he thought that her upper
lip quivered; that some delicate demon of laughter was trying
to look out at him under the lashes; but not a lid twitched; the
vivid lips rested gravely upon each other. After a silence she
said:</p>

<p>"What is it, <em>human</em>, that you expect me to do? Flirt
with you?"</p>

<p>"Good Lord, no!" he said, stampeded.</p>

<p>She was now paying him the compliment of her full attention;
he felt the dubious flattery, although it slightly scared him.</p>

<p>"Why is it," she asked, "that a man is eternally occupied in
thinking about the effect he produces on woman&mdash;whether or not
he knows her&mdash;that seems to make no difference at all? Why is
it?"</p>

<p>He turned redder; she sat curled up, nursing both ankles, and
contemplating him with impersonal and searching curiosity.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she said; "is there any earthly reason why you and
I should be interested in each other&mdash;enough, I mean, to make
any effort toward civility beyond the bounds of ordinary convention?"</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>

<p>"Because," she added, "if there is not, any such effort on your
part borders rather closely on the offensive. And I am quite sure
you do not intend that."</p>

<p>He was indignant now, but utterly incapable of retort.</p>

<p>"Is there anything romantic in it because a chance swimmer rests
a few moments in somebody's boat?" she asked. "Is that chance
swimmer superhuman or inhuman or ultra-human because she is not
consciously, and simperingly, preoccupied with the fact that there
happens to be a man in her vicinity?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" he broke out, "do you think I'm that sort of
noodle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I <em>don't</em> think about you at all," she interrupted;
"there is not a thought that I have which concerns you as an individual.
My homily is delivered in the abstract. Can't you&mdash;in the abstract&mdash;understand
<em>that</em>?&mdash;even if you are a bit doubtful concerning the
seven deadly conventions?"</p>

<p>He rested on his oars, tingling all over with wrath and surprise.</p>

<p>"And now," she said quietly, "I think it time to go. The sun
is almost shining, you see, and the beauty of the scene is too
obvious for even you to miss."</p>

<p>"May I express an opinion before you depart?"</p>

<p>"If it is not a very long or very dissenting opinion."</p>

<p>"Then it's this: two normal and wholesome people&mdash;man and a woman,
can <em>not</em> meet, either conventionally or unconventionally,
without expressing some atom of interest in one another as individuals.
I say two&mdash;perfectly&mdash;normal&mdash;people&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it has just happened!" she insisted, preparing to rise.</p>

<p>"No, it has not happened."</p>

<p>"Really. You speak for yourself of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. I <em>am</em> interested; I'd be stupid if I were
not. Besides, I understand conventions as well as you do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't observe them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't worship them!"</p>

<p>She said coolly: "Women should be ritualists. It is safer."</p>

<p>"It is not necessary in this case. I haven't the slightest hope
of making this incident a foundation for another; I haven't the
least idea that I shall ever see you again. But for me to pretend
an imbecile indifference to you or to the situation would be a
more absurd example of self-consciousness than even you have charged
me with."</p>

<p>Wrath and surprise in her turn widened her eyes; he held up his
hand: "One moment; I have not finished. May I go on?"</p>

<p>And, as she said nothing, he resumed: "During the few minutes
we have been accidentally thrown together, I have not seen a quiver
of human humour in you. <em>There</em> is the self-consciousness&mdash;the
absorbed preoccupation with appearances."</p>

<p>"What is there humourous in the situation?" she demanded, very
pink.</p>

<p>"Good Lord! What is there humourous in any situation if you don't
make it so?"</p>

<p>"I am not a humourist," she said.</p>

<p>She sat in the bows, one closed hand propping her chin; and sometimes
her clear eyes, harboring lightning, wandered toward him, sometimes
toward the shore.</p>

<p>"Suppose you continue to row," she said at last. "I'm doing you
the honour of thinking about what you've said."</p>

<p>He resumed the oars, still sitting facing her, and pushed the
boat slowly forward; and, as they continued their progress in
silence, her brooding glance wavered, at intervals, between him
and the coast.</p>

<p>"Haven't you <em>any</em> normal human curiosity concerning me?"
he asked so boyishly that, for a second, again from her eyes,
two gay little demons seemed to peer out and laugh at him.</p>

<p>But her lips were expressionless, and she only said: "I have
no curiosity. Is that criminally abnormal?"</p>

<p>"Yes; if it is true. Is it?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it is too unflattering a truth for you to believe."
She checked herself, looked up at him, hesitated. "It is <em>not</em>
absolutely true. It was at first. I am normally interested now.
If you knew more about me you would very easily understand my
lack of interest in people I pass; the habit of not permitting
myself to be interested&mdash;the necessity of it. The art of indifference
is far more easily acquired than the art of forgetting."</p>

<p>"But surely," he said, "it can cost you no effort to forget me."</p>

<p>"No, of course not." She looked at him, unsmiling: "It was the
acquired habit of indifference in me which you mistook for &mdash;I
think you mistook it for stupidity. Many do. Did you?"</p>

<p>But the guilty amusement on his face answered her; she watched
him silently for a while.</p>

<p>"You are quite right in one way," she said; "an unconventional
encounter like this has no significance&mdash;not enough to dignify
it with any effort toward indifference. But until I began to reprove
man in the abstract, I really had not very much interest in you
as an individual."</p>

<p>And, as he said nothing: "I might better have been in the beginning
what you call 'human'&mdash;found the situation mildly amusing&mdash;and
it <em>is</em>&mdash;though you don't know it! But"&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;"the
acquired instinct operated automatically. I wish I had been more&mdash;human;
I can be." She raised her eyes; and in them glimmered her first
smile, faint, yet so charming a revelation that the surprise of
it held him motionless at his oars.</p>

<p>"Have I paid the tribute you claim?" she asked. "If I have, may
I not go overboard at my convenience?"</p>

<p>He did not answer. She laid both arms along the gunwales once
more, balancing herself to rise.</p>

<p>"We are near enough now," she said, "and the fog is quite gone.
May I thank you and depart without further arousing you to psychological
philosophy?"</p>

<p>"If you must," he said; "but I'd rather row you in."</p>

<p>"If I must? Do you expect to paddle me around Cape Horn?" And
she rose and stepped lightly onto the bow, maintaining her balance
without effort while the boat pitched, fearless, confident, swaying
there between sky and sea.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she said, gravely nodding at him.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Calypso!"</p>

<p>She joined her finger tips above her head, preliminary to a plunge.
Then she looked down at him over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"I <em>told</em> you that Calypso was a <em>land</em> nymph."</p>

<p>"I can't help it; fabled Calypso you must remain to me."</p>

<p>"Oh; am I to remain&mdash;anything&mdash;to you&mdash;for the next five minutes?"</p>

<p>"Do you think I could forget you?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so&mdash;for five minutes. Your satisfied vanity will
retain me for so long&mdash;until it becomes hungry again. And&mdash;but
read the history of Ulysses&mdash;carefully. However, it <em>was</em>
nice of you&mdash;not to name yourself and expect a response from me.
I'm afraid &mdash;I'm afraid it is going to take me almost five
minutes to forget you &mdash;I mean your boat of course. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>Before he could speak again she went overboard, rose swimming
with effortless grace. After a dozen strokes or so she turned
on one side, glancing back at him. Later, almost among the breakers,
she raised one arm in airy signal, but whether to him or to somebody
on the raft he did not know.</p>

<p>For five minutes&mdash;the allotted five&mdash;he lay on his oars watching
the sands. At moments he fancied he could still distinguish her,
but the distance was great, and there were many scarlet head-dresses
among the bathers ashore and afloat.</p>

<p>And after a while he settled back on his oars, cast a last glance
astern, and pulled for the <em>Ariani</em>, aboard of which Portlaw
was already bellowing at him through an enormous megaphone.</p>

<p>Malcourt, who looked much younger than he really was, appeared
on the after deck, strolling about with a telescope tucked up
under one arm, both hands in his trousers pockets; and, as Hamil
pulled under the stern, he leaned over the rail: "Hello, Hamil!
Any trade with the natives in prospect? How far will a pint of
beads go with the lady aborigines?"</p>

<p>"Better ask at the Beach Club," replied Hamil, laughing; "I say,
Malcourt, I've had a corking swim out yonder&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go in deep?" inquired Malcourt guilelessly.</p>

<p>"Deep? It's forty fathoms off the reef."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean the water," murmured Malcourt.</p>
