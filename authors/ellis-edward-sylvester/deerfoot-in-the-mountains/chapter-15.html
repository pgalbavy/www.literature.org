<p>Never in all their lives were the Shelton brothers prouder of
Deerfoot the Shawanoe than when they saw him utterly defeat the
finest athletes of the Blackfoot tribe. The youth had done his
best, as he was urged to do, and his triumph was too overwhelming
for anyone to question it. He had been pitted against the very
flower of that powerful people, who at that time numbered between
three and four thousand souls. The pick of the runners and marksmen
had come from the other villages, and every one was decisively
vanquished.</p>

<p>The delight of Mul-tal-la and of Spink and Jiggers was hardly
less than that of the boys. Mul-tal-la <em>knew</em> the Shawanoe
would win, while the other two Blackfeet merely believed it, for
they had never been intimately associated with the champion of
champions, and only remembered what Mul-tal-la told them he had
witnessed.</p>

<p>Human nature is the same the world over, and among the defeated
ones was a feeling of envy and resentment toward the young warrior
who belonged to another tribe, and who, after coming many hundreds
of miles, had put them all to shame. This was to be expected,
and it caused no uneasiness to Deerfoot, who had faced it many
times among his own race as well as on the part of white people.</p>

<p>But the Shawanoe took little or no pleasure in his victory. He
had entered into the contest because he could not help it. Had
he reached the village at the same time with his friends, he would
have sternly forbidden any reference to his brilliant physical
powers, and thus prevented the tournament that was so distasteful
to him; but, as I have shown, the mischief was done before he
came upon the scene. His reputation had been proclaimed, and naught
remained but to prove that only the simple truth had been told
of him.</p>

<p>That evening the four friends who had spent so many days and
nights together were gathered in the lodge at the northern end
of the village. Time had been given for the excitement to die
out. Three of the defeated champions were well on their way to
their own village, when, had the result been different, they would
have staid for several days in what may be considered the Blackfoot
capital. The hum and murmur of voices and the restless moving
to and fro were audible outside, but the old companions were left
to themselves. Mul-tal-la had succeeded in impressing upon his
countrymen that when their guests retired to their tepee they
were not to be intruded upon.</p>

<p>The fire was burning in the middle of the primitive home, and
George and Victor Shelton and Mul-tal-la were seated on the furs
that were spread along three sides of the apartment. Deerfoot
sat by himself, removed from all. He was partly reclining on one
elbow and gazing into the fire, as if sunk in meditation. The
boys knew the meaning of his attitude and air; he was dissatisfied
with what had occurred that day.</p>

<p>"By gracious!" said Victor; "if I could do what you did, Deerfoot,
I'd be so proud I wouldn't speak to George or Mul-tal-la or you;
and yet you don't seem to feel a bit stuck up. You ought to be
ashamed of yourself."</p>

<p>The Shawanoe made no reply, but continued gazing into the fire,
as if he did not hear the words. George added:</p>

<p>"Your victory will be talked about among all the Blackfoot villages,
and the children of to-day will tell their children about it long
after we are gone."</p>

<p>Mul-tal-la kept glancing at Deerfoot with an admiring, affectionate
expression, and, noting his continued silence, he said in a gentle
voice:</p>

<p>"The Blackfeet did not think Mul-tal-la spoke with a single tongue;
they said his words were lies, but they do not say so now."</p>

<p>"I didn't see anything of Taggarak," added Victor. "I looked
around for him after the battle was won. Why did he stay away?"</p>

<p>Deerfoot for the first time noted what was said. He lifted his
head from his elbow and sat upright.</p>

<p>"Taggarak was there; Deerfoot saw him," he quietly remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes; Mul-tal-la passed near him. The chief kept by himself and
spoke to no one. He was on the side nearest the wood. Just before
the last race was won he turned away and went back to his lodge."</p>

<p>"What was the meaning of <em>that</em>?" asked the Shawanoe.
"Is he displeased with the defeat of his young men?"</p>

<p>"It is the other way; he is glad their conceit has been checked.
The Blackfeet are great boasters, and he has reproved them many
times. Mul-tal-la saw him smile when Deerfoot came home many paces
in front of that tall warrior, who is the greatest boaster of
them all. Taggarak was glad when he was defeated."</p>

<p>"It pleases us more than we can tell to know that Deerfoot has
won the good-will of the war chief," observed George Shelton,
who could not forget that ominous conversation they had had some
time before with Taggarak. "It will make our stay more pleasant
than I believed it would be."</p>

<p>The observant Victor noticed that Mul-tal-la gave no reply to
this remark, which had been made in the hope of being confirmed
by the Blackfoot. The latter glanced at the Shawanoe, whose eyes
again rested upon the fire. George threw a couple of sticks in
the blaze and then resumed his seat beside his brother. When the
stillness was becoming oppressive, Mul-tal-la startled all three
of his listeners by what was certainly a remarkable question:</p>

<p>"Is Deerfoot afraid of any man?"</p>

<p>Even the Shawanoe flashed a surprised look upon the Blackfoot.</p>

<p>"Why does my brother ask Deerfoot that?"</p>

<p>"He shall soon know. Will Deerfoot answer Mul-tal-la?"</p>

<p>The question seemed to rouse the Shawanoe, who spoke with more
animation than he had shown since the group had come together
for the evening.</p>

<p>"No; Deerfoot fears no man that lives! God has given him more
power and skill than he deserves. He has never denied protection
to Deerfoot. He has told him to do right, and Deerfoot tries to
obey His will. When He thinks the time has come for Deerfoot to
go to Him, Deerfoot will be ready and will be glad. Deerfoot knows
He is not pleased with such things as took place to-day. What
is it for one man to run faster or shoot straighter than another?
No credit belongs to <em>him</em>, for it is God who gives him
the power. Deerfoot would sin if he shrank from any task laid
upon him; but a victory like that just won does no one any good.
Deerfoot would be happier if he could turn the thoughts of all
those people to the true God."</p>

<p>In the warmth of his feelings the Shawanoe had wandered from
the question just asked him, but in doing so he revealed the nobility
of his nature. He was oppressed by the belief that the strife
in which he had been the victor not only accomplished no real
good, but actually retarded the work he had in mind. He came back
to the question his friend had just asked.</p>

<p>"Why does my brother think Deerfoot is afraid of any man?"</p>

<p>Mul-tal-la could not hide a certain nervousness, but with all
the calmness he could summon he parried the direct question by
the remark:</p>

<p>"The most terrible warrior of all the Blackfeet is Taggarak the
chieftain; he has slain many men in battle and has never been
conquered."</p>

<p>The inference from this remark was obvious even to the boys.
It was Victor who asked in surprise:</p>

<p>"Is Deerfoot to fight with Taggarak? If he does, I'll bet on
Deerfoot."</p>

<p>To any others except those present the words of the Shawanoe
would have sounded like boasting, but there was no such thought
in his heart.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot has no more fear of Taggarak than he has of a pappoose.
He may be a great warrior, but Deerfoot has conquered as great
warriors as he."</p>

<p>Determined that Mul-tal-la should parry no longer, the Shawanoe
forced him to a direct answer.</p>

<p>"Why does my brother think Taggarak wishes to fight him?"</p>

<p>The reply was astonishing:</p>

<p>"The squaw of Taggarak is seeking to learn of the God that she
has been told is known to the Shawanoe. She has asked me, she
has asked Kepkapkolakak and Borabtrik (the messengers known as
'Spink' and 'Jiggers'). She does not sleep because of her heaviness
of mind."</p>

<p>"Does Taggarak know of this?" asked the surprised Deerfoot.</p>

<p>"Not yet; but it must soon come to his knowledge."</p>

<p>"Will he harm his wife?"</p>

<p>"Mul-tal-la cannot say; he may put her to death. There is no
doubt that he will slay Deerfoot&mdash;<em>if he can</em>," added the
Blackfoot significantly, "or he will make him walk around the
Spirit Circle till he drops dead."</p>

<p>Deerfoot stared in astonishment. He was mystified.</p>

<p>"The Spirit Circle," he repeated. "Does Deerfoot hear aright?
If so, what does his brother mean? Deerfoot is listening."</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, the Blackfoot was silent for a minute, as if
gathering his thoughts. He looked up at the opening in the roof
of the lodge, then into the fire, and, addressing the three, repeated
the following myth or legend, which has been extant among the
Blackfeet Indians from time immemorial:</p>

<p>"Many, many moons ago, long before the parents of our oldest
men were born, a chieftain as great as Taggarak ruled the Blackfeet.
His fame reached far to the north, to the east, to the south and
to the west, beyond the Stony Mountains, to the shore of the great
water, for there was none like him. In those far-away days the
home of Wahla, chieftain of the Blackfeet, was to the south of
this village, on the banks of the Two Rivers.</p>

<p>"Wahla had a daughter who was the most beauteous maiden that
warrior ever looked upon. She was loving and dainty, and the idol
of the stern old warrior, who would have cut off his right hand
rather than have the slightest harm come to her. Never did father
love daughter more than Chief Wahla loved Mita the Rose of the
Forest.</p>

<p>"Wahla returned one day from a fierce battle with the Cheyennes.
A great victory had been won, and the Blackfeet brought home a
score of prisoners, that they might be tied to the stake and burned
while their captives made merry over their sufferings. This was
the custom of the Blackfeet, and they have not yet forgotten such
amusements.</p>

<p>"Among the captives was a manly youth, who was proud and brave,
and had slain three of the Blackfeet and wounded Wahla himself
before they made him prisoner. He scorned to ask mercy, which
would have been denied him, and, without a tremor of limb or a
dimming of his bright eyes, awaited the cruel death that he knew
had been prepared for him and his comrades.</p>

<p>"Wahla had to keep his captives for a week or more until word
could be sent to the other villages, that they might come and
feast upon the deaths of the Cheyennes. During that time, Mul-tal-la
cannot tell how, the young Cheyenne warrior and Mita, daughter
of the chieftain, met and learned to love each other. No one knew
their secret, and so, while preparations were going on for the
cruel deaths, she managed to loose his bonds, and one night the
two fled for the home of the Cheyennes, there to become husband
and wife.</p>

<p>"Wahla did not learn of the flight of his daughter and lover
until the next morning, when he started in pursuit. He went alone,
for his rage was so terrible that he was not willing anyone should
share the sweetness of revenge with him. He traveled fast, and
drew nigh enough to catch sight of the two on the second day following
their flight. He did not carry his bow, but had his knife and
tomahawk, while the youth possessed no weapon at all. Had a knife
been his, he would not have used it against Wahla, because he
was the father of the maiden whom he loved more than his life.</p>

<p>"When the two found they could not flee faster than the wrathful
chieftain, they paused and waited for him to come up. Then Mita
threw herself at the feet of her father and prayed him to spare
the life of the Cheyenne. The chief spurned her and ran after
the young warrior. The youth did not flee, but stood with folded
arms, calmly awaiting him.</p>

<p>"'Slay me,' he said, 'but when I die Mita will die with me!'</p>

<p>"Heedless of the appeal, the furious chieftain plunged his knife
into the breast of the youth, who sank to the earth and breathed
out his life. Wahla turned to seize his daughter, but at that
moment a wild shriek rent the air, and she died, clasping his
knees and moaning that he had slain her as well as the Cheyenne.</p>

<p>"When Wahla saw what he had done, he started to hurry to his
village, but his mind had gone from him. You were told that he
had been wounded by the Cheyenne in battle. The wound was in the
thigh of the chief, and it now broke out afresh, as if in punishment
for the crime he had committed. It made him limp sorely, but he
would not stop, and ran faster than ever. Because of his halt
gait, he ran in a circle.</p>

<p>"Round and round he went all night, when he perished, but the
Great Spirit kept him running throughout the days and weeks that
followed until he became a shadow. His feet wore a circular path,
which may be seen to-day, as Mul-tal-la has looked upon it many
times and my brothers may do if they will journey a few days to
the southward.</p>

<p>"But Mul-tal-la now tells the strangest part of this story. In
the years that have passed since Wahla slew the Cheyenne lover,
and his daughter died at his feet, the storms would have wiped
away all signs of the path long ago. But it remains as distinct
as ever. This is because the spirit of Wahla tramps it round and
round all through the nights when the moon does not shine, for
no one can see him running over the ground.</p>

<p>"When you look toward the slope of the mountain you can see the
circle as plain as we see those sticks burning in the middle of
the lodge, but when you reach the spot no sign of the path shows."</p>

<p>"How is that?" asked the wondering Victor.</p>

<p>"It is the belief that the spirit of Mita, the daughter, is always
hovering over the spot, and that her heart forever grieves for
her father and lover. When she sees anyone drawing near the place,
she hurries from her home, which is near at hand, though no one
knows exactly where, and, bending over the ground, hurries along
and flirts a piece of her garment over the whole length of the
path and blots it out, so that grass grows where a few minutes
before was only the hard earth, packed by the moccasins of her
father."</p>

<p>"What brings the path into sight again?" asked George Shelton.</p>

<p>"When night comes, Chief Wahla begins tramping around the circle
once more. At sunrise the path is as it was before, and so remains
unless some one starts forward to gain a closer look. The moment
he does so the invisible spirit of Mita, daughter of Wahla, hurries
out and destroys all the footprints, so that no one has ever been
near enough to gain a close view of them, nor can he ever do so.
Such is the legend of the Spirit Circle."[1]</p>

<p>
[1] On the gently sloping side of a low mountain near the<br/>
Colorado-Wyoming line can be plainly seen a circular path of<br/>
about two hundred feet in diameter. The road connecting the<br/>
Rambler copper mines with Laramie passes within ten miles of the<br/>
place. When the curious observer climbs to the spot, whose path<br/>
shows distinctly from a distance, he cannot detect a sign of the<br/>
mystic circle. Various theories have been offered in explanation<br/>
of this phenomenon, but as yet none has proved satisfactory.
