<p>The Mohawk felt that he had accomplished a great feat in the
taking of the canoe before the very eyes of the Iroquois sentinel
set to watch it and in successfully eluding the pursuit of the
others. But the danger was not yet disposed of, for, at the moment
the fugitives stepped from the canoe, the other two crafts were
in swift pursuit, the occupants having learned the trick played
upon them by the wily Mohawk. Although the canoe of the latter
was invisible, yet they were well aware of the direction taken,
and could not avoid a pretty accurate guess as to the destination
of the occupants. Thus it was that they headed almost in a direct
line for the precise point where the fugitives landed, and were
not much behind them in reaching the spot.</p>

<p>The majority of persons, in making such a flight, would have
started for the depths of the forest without an instant's delay,
but the Mohawk perpetrated a little piece of strategy which proved
of inestimable benefit to him and his friends. At the moment they
stepped from the boat he seized the latter in a strong grasp and
gave it a powerful impulse that sent it far out and down the stream.
Although their pursuers were coming up rapidly, yet they were
not quite in sight, and in the brief interval that must elapse
before they could catch a glimpse of the empty craft, the purpose
of Lena-Wingo was perfected. An exultant whoop from one of the
pursuing canoes told of the discovery of the drifting boat, whose
occupants had effected a landing but a second or two before. But
the craft which caused the outcry was several rods below the spot
where it had touched the land, and the fugitives themselves were
still further removed from the water's edge, stealing along in
the darkness of the woods from the Iroquois who were hastily gathering
to the spot, apprised by a dozen signals of what had taken place.</p>

<p>The Indian, telling his friends to keep on the move and make
no noise, remained in the rear, to learn what his foes intended
to do. He saw the two canoes halt for a moment beside the empty
boat, as if they wished to make sure that it held none of the
party for whom they were hunting, and then they shot their own
craft in to the shore, leaving the other to drift aimlessly down
the river. The two which struck the bank did so at a point something
more than a rod below where the other landing had taken place.
There they met quite a number of others who came down from the
woods, where they had been signaling to and answering calls from
those across the stream. Then followed a wrangle, with the same
prospect of conflict that occurred at no great time before. The
provocation in the latter instance was much greater than in the
former, for the fugitives had slipped through the hands of the
Iroquois in the most exasperating manner. But there seemed, also,
to be the identical level-headed ones, who were backed by an authority
sufficient to compel the fiery warriors to keep the peace. The
storm of passion subsided almost as soon as it rose.</p>

<p>Lena-Wingo was desirous of learning what the party, as a whole,
would do, now that it was clear that the fugitives had succeeded
in crossing the Susquehanna in spite of all the preparations to
prevent it; but the warriors gathered around were so numerous
and began to spread out in such a fashion, that his position became
untenable, and he found it no easy matter to get out of his rather
uncomfortable quarters and to rejoin his companions, who were
awaiting him some little distance off. All were in high spirits
over the success of the strategy of the Mohawk, but they could
not shut their eyes to the fact that in one sense they had crossed
the Rubicon. As there was no turning back, they must press forward.</p>

<p>With many whispered congratulations over the discomfiture of
the Iroquois, the fugitives hurried forward until they reached
the spot where they felt free to say what they chose without danger
of being heard by their pursuers. The Mohawk was at the head of
the little party and conducted them to the edge of a large clear
space, where grain had been growing. As there was every convenience
for sitting down and enjoying a comfortable rest, they paused,
and for the first time that night felt the pleasure of knowing
that there was nothing to be feared from the Tories and Indians.</p>

<p>"Lena-Wingo, you're a brick!" exclaimed Jo Minturn, taking the
liberty of slapping the grim Indian a resounding blow on the back.
"I couldn't have done that thing better if I had taken the contract
myself."</p>

<p>The guide did not resent this familiarity, though at times it
would have offended him.</p>

<p>"Iroquois get mad," he replied, with his usual grin. "When Iroquois
get mad, then Lena-Wingo get glad."</p>

<p>"Yes; I suspect you were inclined that way, from what I've heard
of your dealings with those people."</p>

<p>"Recollect that we haven't reached Wilkesbarre yet," put in Rosa,
"and it isn't wise to rejoice until we're well out of the woods.
It seems to me that the hardest part of the work still lies before
us."</p>

<p>"Gal speak right," assented the Mohawk, with an approving nod.
"Iroquois all round&mdash;look everywhere."</p>

<p>"It strikes me that is what they've been doing for the past few
days," added Jo, who was not to be discouraged. "But they haven't
made a success of it, so far."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Ned, addressing Jo, but meaning his words
for Lena-Wingo, "that when the approaches to Wilkesbarre are guarded
so closely it will be wiser for us to go somewhere else."</p>

<p>This scheme had been freely discussed by the two young scouts,
and they had arranged that it should be introduced in this manner
for the purpose of learning the views of the Mohawk.</p>

<p>"I have thought of the same thing," replied Jo, as if it were
the first time it had been mentioned in his hearing. "And it does
look as if it is risking a great deal to push right through the
woods in this way, when there are hundreds of other paths by which
we can escape the Iroquois."</p>

<p>"It would be a good trick on Colonel Butler, when he has arranged
his redskins and Tories so that he is sure we will walk right
into their hands, for him to learn that we have gone somewhere
else."</p>

<p>"It can be done," said Jo, carrying out the plan fixed upon some
time before. "We have already shown them that there is no use
of their trying to stop us, when we have made up our minds to
do something, &mdash;I mean Lena-Wingo more than us,&mdash;and so we
can afford to retire and leave them to themselves."</p>

<p>"If they can't stop us," said Rosa, "what, then, is the use of
acting as though they had done so?"</p>

<p>"See here," said her brother, turning rather sharply, "I thought
Ned and I had arranged without your help."</p>

<p>Not one of the three imagined that Lena-Wingo was quick enough
to take the cue from what was thus said by Jo, but such was the
case. The Mohawk held his peace and listened, but he was not deceived.</p>
