<p>As long as Captain Shirril stayed near the scuttle, he could
not command a view of the entire roof of his cabin. His interest
in what was going on below made him anxious to do this, but he
was too alive to his own danger to remain motionless for more
than a few minutes at a time.</p>

<p>The indistinct rustling that had awakened his hope soon ceased,
and he was compelled to believe the Comanche had given up his
intention of trying to gain a stealthy shot at him and was now
devoting himself to the inmates of the dwelling.</p>

<p>How he longed to descend through the scuttle and take part in
the stirring events that must soon be under way there! What short
work he would make of the wretch who had dared to assume such
a risk!</p>

<p>But it was useless to regret his own shortsightedness, now that
it rendered him powerless to strike a blow for his friends. He
crept to the peak of the roof, and scrutinized every portion thus
brought into his field of vision. Not the slightest sound fell
upon his ear that could indicate danger, nor could he discern
anything of his enemies.</p>

<p>The wind was still blowing fitfully, and he heard the familiar
rustle of the mesquite bush, with now and then a signal passing
between the Comanches. He listened in vain for the noise made
by the hoofs of their mustangs. They seemed to have ceased their
aimless galloping back and forth, and were probably plotting some
new form of mischief.</p>

<p>Suddenly the rattle of a horse's feet struck him. It broke upon
his hearing for an instant, and then ceased as abruptly as it
had made itself manifest.</p>

<p>It was as if a steed were galloping over the soft earth, and,
reaching a small bridge of planks, dashed over them with two or
three bounds, his hoofs immediately becoming inaudible in the
yielding ground beyond.</p>

<p>That which might have puzzled a listener was plain to the Texan,
who had spent many years on the plains of the Southwest. He knew
that what might be called a peculiar eddy in the fitful wind had
brought the sound to him. A sudden change of direction&mdash;ended
as soon as it began&mdash;whirled the noise as straight across the
intervening space as if it had been fired by an arrow.</p>

<p>The sound was similar to that which he had noticed many times
that evening, but the impression came to him that it possessed
a significance which belonged to none of the others. It was a
single horse, and he was going at a moderate speed, which, however,
was the case with most of those he had heard.</p>

<p>All at once the sound broke upon his ear again, but this time
it was accompanied by the noise of many other hoofs.</p>

<p>"They are cattle," was his conclusion; "a part of the herd has
been stampeded, and one of the men is trying to round them up:
it was his mustang that I heard&mdash;ah! there it goes again!"</p>

<p>It was the crack of a rifle and the screech of a mortally struck
person that startled him this time.</p>

<p>"I believe that was a Comanche who has gone down before the rifle
of one of our men."</p>

<p>As the reader is aware, the Texan was correct in every particular,
for it was the report of Gleeson's Winchester, which ended the
career of the warrior pressing Avon Burnet so hard, that reached
the captain as he lay on the roof of his own dwelling.</p>

<p>The whimsical nature of the wind, that had been blowing all the
night, excluded further sounds. The stillness that succeeded seemed
so unnatural in its way that it might have alarmed a more superstitious
person. Once the faintest possible rumbling of the cattle's hoofs
was detected, but it quickly subsided, and nothing more of the
kind was noticeable.</p>

<p>It was clear that the Comanches in the immediate vicinity of
the cabin must have noted all that interested the Texan. Whatever
the issue of the remarkable meeting on the prairie, there could
be no doubt that one of the red men had been laid low. Another
had been shot by the captain a short time before, not to mention
the other one or two that he believed had fallen.</p>

<p>Thus far, no one of the inmates had been harmed, unless perchance
his nephew was overtaken by disaster. Consequently, the game the
Comanches were playing, though they did their part with rare skill,
was a losing one up to this point.</p>

<p>As the minutes passed, the Texan found himself more hopeful than
he had been through the entire evening. He was strong in the belief
that Avon had succeeded in reaching the camp of the cattlemen,
and that the latter would soon appear on the scene with an emphasis
that would scatter his assailants like so much chaff.</p>

<p>The only vulnerable point for fire was on the roof, but the designs
of the Indians had been defeated thus far, and he believed they
could be stood off indefinitely, at least until the arrival of
the cowboys, who would then take charge of business.</p>

<p>The two matters that gave him anxiety were the presence of the
warrior below in the cabin, and the probability of himself being
struck by some of the bullets that he expected to come scurrying
over the planking every minute.</p>

<p>The two shots that had been fired came alarmingly near, and the
next were likely to come still nearer.</p>

<p>But immunity from harm gives one confidence, and only a few more
minutes passed when, instead of contenting himself with peering
about him, the captain began stealthily creeping toward the part
of the eaves where the last Indian had appeared and disappeared
so suddenly.</p>

<p>Mindful of the risk of the action, he paused when close to the
edge, and waited several minutes before venturing to peep over.
The stillness was as if every living person were a hundred miles
away. This, however, as he well knew, might be the case with a
score of Indians grouped directly beneath.</p>

<p>But having gone thus far, he did not mean to return to his post
without accomplishing something. With the greatest possible caution,
he raised his head just far enough to look over. He held it in
this position only a second or two, for, if any of his enemies
were on the alert, they would be sure to observe him.</p>

<p>Nothing greeted his vision, beyond that which he had seen times
without number. He did not catch the outlines of a single person
or mustang, though convinced they were near at hand.</p>

<p>Had there been any doubt on this point, it would have been dissipated
by a repetition of the signals that seemed almost continually
passing between the besieging Comanches.</p>

<p>Captain Shirril noticed that the sounds came from the direction
of the mesquite bush, as though most of them had gathered there
apparently for consultation, and were calling in the other members
of their party.</p>

<p>"If that is so, they can't do us much harm," was his conclusion,
"but they are not likely to stay there. I suppose they have gathered
in Avon and my horses long ago, and we shall have to ride other
animals on the tramp to Kansas."</p>

<p>On the whole, the result of his survey was satisfactory; whatever
mischief the Comanches were plotting, there was no immediate danger.
Minutes were precious, but they were more valuable to the defenders
than to the assailants. The cattlemen must arrive soon, and when
they did so the siege would be over.</p>

<p>The reconnoissance, if such it may be termed, lasted but a few
minutes, when the captain started on his cautious return to the
scuttle, in the hope that something in the way of information
awaited him there.</p>

<p>To his amazement, he was still within several yards, when he
perceived that it was open.</p>

<p>The door was raised fully six inches, the opening being toward
him, so that the Comanche had him at his mercy. It looked indeed
to the Texan as if his enemy had got the drop on him, and at last
he was at his mercy.</p>

<p>The captain whipped out his revolver, but before he could fire
a familiar voice called out in a husky undertone:</p>

<p>"Am dat you, captin'? And am you well?"</p>
