<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>There it was in plain sight, rising like a giant nosegay of emerald
from the crystalline water. It was barely two acres in extent,
and, like nearly all islands great and small in southern Maine,
the firs, pines and spruce grew to the very edge of the water.
It reminded one of the patches of green earth in Europe where
the frugal owners do not allow a square inch to go to waste.</p>

<p>"I don't see anything of the <em>Deerfoot</em>," said Calvert
in a guarded voice to Noxon.</p>

<p>"We always lay to on the other side. Keep down!"</p>

<p>It was wise advice, though not needed. The two crouched so low
in their crowded quarters that a person a hundred feet away would
not have seen them. Each instinctively felt of his hip pocket.
The little weapon was there.</p>

<p>The officers had now to depend upon Noxon, who for the time was
director of the enterprise. He could make himself heard over his
shoulder without drawing attention to himself, provided he was
under the eye of his old associates. He was never more alert.</p>

<p>Veering to the right, where there was a hundred yards of clear
water between the islet and the mainland, he slowed down and began
gradually circling the exuberant patch of earth. It will be remembered
that he had been there before and knew the habits of Woodford
and Miller. By and by, he had glided far enough to bring the western
shore into his field of vision. Before that moment he had discerned
the stern and flagstaff of a launch. A second glance told him
the truth, which he cautiously made known to the crouching forms
behind him:</p>

<p>"The <em>Deerfoot</em> is there! Don't stir till I give the word!"</p>

<p>Neither of the criminals was in sight, but it was evident they
were near, else the launch would not be lying where it was. Noxon
gave a series of toots with his whistle, though the noise of the
exhaust must have been noted before. In response, Kit Woodford
and Graff Miller came out from among the trees, halted at the
side of the launch and stared at the <em>Water Witch</em> and
its single occupant.</p>

<p>Could they believe their eyes? They saw before them their own
boat and the young man whom they had cowardly deserted in his
extremity. What was the explanation to be?</p>

<p>By this time the parties were so near that they could talk with
only a slight raise in their voices. Kit Woodford was the first
to open his mouth. With a profane expletive expressing his surprise,
he demanded:</p>

<p>"Where did you come from?"</p>

<p>It was on the tongue of Noxon to make a biting reply, but he
did not forget the part he had to play.</p>

<p>"I found this boat at the wharf at Beartown and thought I'd hunt
you up. How came you to have <em>that</em> launch?"</p>

<p>"Some one had run off with ours and left that. So we made a trade
and I rather think we got the best of the bargain. I don't understand
how ours was found by you."</p>

<p>"Maybe the owners of that wanted to trade back. I say, Kit, I
would like to know something&mdash;why did you and Graff run off and
leave me behind?"</p>

<p>"We didn't!" replied Woodford, with virtuous indignation. "Me
and Graff hunted high and low for you and made up our minds you
had run off yourself with the swag."</p>

<p>"A fine lot of swag I had, when I had to scoot just after I got
the safe open."</p>

<p>While this snatch of conversation was going on, Noxon, who had
cut off the power, was edging nearer. Calvert and Hagan squeezed
each other so hard that it looked as if they would push themselves
through the hull of the launch.</p>

<p>Graff Miller now put in his oar:</p>

<p>"If we didn't get a haul out of the measly post office we've
scooped a mighty fine motor boat. We can sell it and gather in
enough to last us till we crack another place."</p>

<p>"That won't be as easy as it looks to you. The whole neighborhood
is up in arms and we shall have to lie low for awhile."</p>

<p>"Well, we've got enough to keep us a week or so&#11834;<em>Nox, there's
somebody in the boat with you</em>!" exclaimed Miller, who that
instant caught sight of the head of one of the crouching men.
The craft was now so close that concealment was impossible. In
fact, in the same moment that the <em>Water Witch</em> gently
bumped against the other boat, Stockham Calvert and Warner Hagan
straightened up and bounded across upon the <em>Deerfoot</em>.
Each grasped a revolver, and Calvert shouted:</p>

<p>"Hands up, or I'll let daylight through you."</p>

<p>The terrified Woodford turned to run, but a bullet whistled past
his ear. Perhaps too he realized in that frightful instant that
no place of refuge awaited him. The island was too small to allow
him to hide himself. He abruptly halted on the edge of the wood,
and facing about sullenly raised his hands.</p>

<p>As for Graff Miller he did not attempt to get away. Accepting
the order addressed to his leader as applying to himself, he stood
stock still and seemed to be doing the best he could to keep the
sky from falling on him.</p>

<p>Knowing that Hagan would look after him, Calvert gave his whole
attention to Woodford. Keeping his revolver presented, he crossed
the narrow deck of the <em>Deerfoot</em> and dropped lightly to
the ground. A few steps took him to the cowardly ruffian. Never
lowering his weapon, he ran the other hand over the outside of
the man's clothing and twitched a revolver from his hip pocket.</p>

<p>"That will do, Christopher; if you now feel an inclination to
lower your dirty hands, you have my permission to do so. Perhaps
it will not tire you quite so much."</p>

<p>Hardly had he complied when a sharp click sounded. So quickly
that it looked like a piece of magic a pair of handcuffs were
snapped upon the miscreant, and Hagan was only a few seconds later
in doing the same with his prisoner.</p>

<p>The capture of the two was so easy that it suggested a farce.</p>

<p>"If you had only put up a fight, Kit, it would have been a good
deal more interesting," said Calvert, "but you always were one
of the biggest cowards that ever made a bluff at being a bad man.
Get a move on you!"</p>

<p>As meekly as a lamb the prisoner stepped upon the nearest launch,
and, as ordered, seated himself on one of the seats at the stern.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to go there too?" humbly asked Graff Miller.</p>

<p>"Of course; step lively."</p>

<p>Calvert explained what was to be done. The handcuffed prisoners
were to be taken to Wiscasset on the <em>Deerfoot</em>, their
captors bearing them company. In that city they would be locked
up, and every step that followed would be strictly in accordance
with law.</p>

<p>Noxon was to trail after the launch in the <em>Water Witch</em>.
There was more than one reason for this arrangement. Since both
boats were capable of making good speed, it was better than to
have one tow the other. If the <em>Water Witch's</em> gasoline
gave out, the <em>Deerfoot</em> could take it in tow, but this
would not be done unless the necessity arose.</p>

<p>The separation of Noxon from his former associates would prevent
an unpleasant scene. Kit Woodford and Graff Miller could not fail
to see that Noxon had given them into the hands of the officers.
While they were powerless to harm the young man, they could make
it uncomfortable for him despite the restraining presence of Calvert
and Hogan.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that none of the steamers and other boats encountered
on that memorable voyage up stream suspected the meaning of what
they saw. One launch was gliding evenly up the river with a second
closely resembling it a hundred yards or more to the rear. In
the latter sat a young man. In the former were four persons, two
of whom had been engaged for weeks in robbing post offices in
the State of Maine. No one observed that they wore handcuffs,
or dreamed that the man handling the wheel was a famous detective.
In this case he was Calvert, who had a fair knowledge of running
a motor boat.</p>

<p>The prisoners were sullen and silent for most of the way. Hagan,
seated behind Calvert, could protect him from any treacherous
attack with the handcuffs. The detective was too wise to invite
an assault of that nature.</p>

<p>When a turn in the course brought the long Wiscasset bridge in
sight with the pretty town on the left, Kit Woodford turned his
head and looked back at the young man who was guiding the other
launch.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with <em>him</em>?" he asked, with
a black scowl.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Hagan.</p>

<p>"Why haven't you got the bracelets on him?"</p>

<p>"He has done us too valuable service. That isn't the way we reward
our friends."</p>

<p>Calvert, who had overheard the words, looked round.</p>

<p>"We may need his evidence to land you and Graff in Atlanta."</p>

<p>The remark was so illuminating that the prisoner said never a
word. The occasion was one of those in which language falls short
of doing justice to the emotions of the persons chiefly involved.
It was Graff Miller who snarled with a smothered rage which it
is hard to picture:</p>

<p>"I'll get even with him if I have to wait ten years."</p>

<p>"You'll have to wait all of that and probably longer," said Calvert,
"and by that time I don't think Orestes Noxon will care much what
you try to do."</p>

<p>The detective pronounced the name with emphasis, to learn whether
it attracted any notice. It did not so far as he could judge,
whereat he was glad.</p>

<p>The criminals were put behind bars, and the young man strolled
through the street to the railway station. On the way, the elder
said:</p>

<p>"It looks to me as if you have a clear title to the <em>Water
Witch</em>. What do you wish to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Sell it to someone so I shall never see it again."</p>

<p>"If you will turn the boat over to me I think I can dispose of
it for you. Have you any price in mind?"</p>

<p>"Sell the launch for whatever you can get, if it isn't more than
twenty-three cents."</p>

<p>"All right; I'll fix it. Here is the railway office. You have
enough funds?"</p>

<p>"Plenty. I shall a buy a through ticket to&mdash;<em>home</em>."</p>

<p>"Of course. I shall call upon you this autumn. Good-by, Horace."</p>

<p>"Good-by to one of the best friends I ever had. God bless you!"</p>
