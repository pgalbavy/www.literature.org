<p>The three of us in that winter camp in the Selkirks were talking
the slow aimless talk of wearied men.</p>

<p>The Soldier, who had seen many campaigns, was riding his hobby
of the Civil War and descanting on Lee's tactics in the last Wilderness
struggle. I said something about the stark romance of it&mdash;of Jeb
Stuart flitting like a wraith through the forests; of Sheridan's
attack at Chattanooga, when the charging troops on the ridge were
silhouetted against a harvest moon; of Leonidas Polk, last of
the warrior Bishops, baptizing his fellow generals by the light
of a mess candle. "Romance,"  I said, "attended the sombre grey
and blue levies as faithfully as she ever rode with knight-errant
or crusader."</p>

<p>The Scholar, who was cutting a raw-hide thong, raised his wise
eyes.</p>

<p>"Does it never occur to you fellows that we are all pretty mixed
in our notions? We look for romance in the well-cultivated garden-plots,
and when it springs out of virgin soil we are surprised, though
any fool might know it was the natural place for it."</p>

<p>He picked up a burning stick to relight his pipe.</p>

<p>"The things we call aristocracies and reigning houses are the
last places to look for masterful men. They began strongly, but
they have been too long in possession. They have been cosseted
and comforted and the devil has gone out of their blood. Don't
imagine that I undervalue descent. It is not for nothing that
a great man leaves posterity. But who is more likely to inherit
the fire&mdash;the elder son with his flesh-pots or the younger son
with his fortune to find? Just think of it! All the younger sons
of younger sons back through the generations! We none of us know
our ancestors beyond a little way. We all of us may have kings'
blood in our veins. The dago who blacked my boots at Vancouver
may be descended by curious byways from Julius Caesar.</p>

<p>"Think of it!" he cried. "The spark once transmitted may smoulder
for generations under ashes, but the appointed time will come,
and it will flare up to warm the world. God never allows waste.
And we fools rub our eyes and wonder, when we see genius come
out of the gutter. It didn't begin there. We tell ourselves that
Shakespeare was the son of a woolpedlar, and Napoleon of a farmer,
and Luther of a peasant, and we hold up our hands at the marvel.
But who knows what kings and prophets they had in their ancestry!"</p>

<p>After that we turned in, and as I lay looking at the frosty stars
a fancy wove itself in my brain. I saw the younger sons carry
the royal blood far down among the people, down even into the
kennels of the outcast. Generations follow, oblivious of the high
beginnings, but there is that in the stock which is fated to endure.
The sons and daughters blunder and sin and perish, but the race
goes on, for there is a fierce stuff of life in it. It sinks and
rises again and blossoms at haphazard into virtue or vice, since
the ordinary moral laws do not concern its mission. Some rags
of greatness always cling to it, the dumb faith that sometime
and somehow that blood drawn from kings it never knew will be
royal again. Though nature is wasteful of material things, there
is no waste of spirit. And then after long years there comes,
unheralded and unlooked-for, the day of the Appointed Time....</p>

<p>This is the story which grew out of that talk by the winter fire.</p>
