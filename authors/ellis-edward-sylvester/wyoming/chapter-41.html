<p>It need not be said that Fred Godfrey improved his opportunity
to the utmost.</p>

<p>Having eluded the Senecas who were so close behind him, it was
not likely he would run any risk of being caught on their return.
In fact, he might have considered himself beyond danger, and yet
the narrowest escape of all occurred only a few minutes afterward.</p>

<p>Anxious to gain the utmost time possible, he was picking his
way with great care, when he stepped upon a stone that turned
under his foot, and he narrowly escaped falling.</p>

<p>Immediately he caught a birdlike call near him, and his quick
wit told him it was a signal from one of the warriors searching
for him.</p>

<p>Fred made an abrupt turn, and going a rod or two, halted precisely
as before&mdash;that is beneath a large tree, and stood close against
the trunk.</p>

<p>And standing thus, he noticed the same sound once more, this
time answered from a point directly behind him.</p>

<p>He could do nothing but stand still, and he knew how to do that
equal to a living statue. Only a few yards in front was an open
space, where the moonlight revealed objects without exposing himself
to observation.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the youth detected two Indians, who came out
of the wood on the other side and stopped, as if they were posing
for inspection. They talked for some minutes in their own tongue,
gesticulating earnestly and then walked toward him.</p>

<p>He quickly shifted his position to the other side of the tree
and peered around, but, when they came into the shadow, nothing
could be seen of them.</p>

<p>"I believe they know where I am," thought he, "and are amusing
themselves at my expense."</p>

<p>Such seemed to be the case, for once more the red men stopped
and were actually within reach of him. Since the arms of the latter
were still fastened behind him, it can well be understood how
he dreaded discovery, his chief fear being that the painful throbbing
of his heart would betray him.</p>

<p>But the good fortune that had attended him on the other side
the river did not desert him now. The Senecas hovered about him
only a minute or two and then moved away, this time taking a direction
that led toward the camp-fire&mdash;an indication that they had given
up the pursuit.</p>

<p>Pausing only long enough for them to pass beyond hearing, Fred
resumed his flight, with the same care he had used from the first.</p>

<p>He was now more hopeful than ever, but almost instantly received
another warning that it is never safe to shout until you are "out
of the woods."</p>

<p>He judged he was fully two hundred yards from the camp-fire which
he had left so hurriedly, when he found himself in such darkness
that he once more stopped until he could gather some idea of his
location and of the points of the compass.</p>

<p>Listening closely, he caught the gentle flow of the small waterfall
and of the Susquehanna on his right, from which direction also
came the occasional reports of guns and the shouts of Indians.
This convinced him he was facing south, and that his back was
turned toward his friends.</p>

<p>It was no pleasant discovery to find the same ominous sounds
proceeding from his own side the river; but, having left them
in such a situation, this alarming fact was scarcely noticed.</p>

<p>"The first thing for me to do is to get these withes off my arms
and wrists," he said, poking around with his feet for some sharp-cornered
stone. "I've stood this&mdash;"</p>

<p>To his dismay, a figure approached in the gloom. There were just
enough scattering rays of moonlight to show it, and its movements
made certain the fact that he (the stranger) had discovered him.</p>

<p>"I shall have to use my feet," was the thought of Fred, as he
braced himself; "and I will give him a kick that will do something&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Am dat you, leftenant?" came in the form of a husky whisper,
as the figure stopped a few feet away and tried to peer through
the gloom.</p>

<p>Fred Godfrey almost shouted with delight, for the question revealed
the identity of Gravity Gimp.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!" was the exclamation of the young man. "I hadn't
the remotest idea of meeting you, Gravity."</p>

<p>"Let's shake on it," chuckled the African, groping forward with
his huge palm, which he shoved into the face of the pleased Fred,
who said:</p>

<p>"If you'll be kind enough to cut these bonds that hold my arms
immovable, I'll shake both hands."</p>

<p>"Of course; where am dey?" asked the equally happy negro, poking
around with his immense jack-knife. "I'se so glorious dat you
mus' 'scuse me if I cut off de wrong things. I can't hold myself.
Dar, I knowed it!" he added, slashing away; "dat's your leg dat
I have hold of, and I do b'leve dat I've cut it half off. Begs
pardon, leftenant, and I'll hit it after a while."</p>

<p>But no such blunder had been committed, and, under the manipulation
of the jack-knife, the withes that had bound the arms of Fred
Godfrey were speedily cut, and he swung his hands about and sawed
the air with great relief.</p>

<p>"My gracious! but that's good!" he exclaimed. "I was so wretched
that I believe I would have gone wild if I hadn't been freed."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you gnaw 'em off?" said Gimp. "You've got good 'nough
teeth to walk right through anything like dat."</p>

<p>"That may be, Gravity; but with my hands tied behind me, I couldn't
very well get at them with my teeth."</p>

<p>"I didn't thunk ob dat&mdash;but you could hab fixed it easy 'nough."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"Jes' stood on your head&mdash;dat was de way to reach 'em."</p>
