<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Teddy gave up; he believed it was all over with him. Lying flat
on his face, he committed himself to heaven, and waited for the
beast to devour him.</p>

<p>Ugh! what a galvanic shudder shook him, as he heard its smothered
bark repeated, and felt its hideous nose glide along his body!
He felt it thrust beneath his breast, and then the beast gave
a lunge, like a hog when rooting, as if seeking to turn him over
on his back.</p>

<p>"No; be the powers, you don’t," muttered Teddy. "I’m not the
chap that’s goin’ to turn over and see mesilf ate up."</p>

<p>So, instead of turning, he remained flat upon his face, sliding
a few inches over the ground.</p>

<p>With a low growl of rage the monster repeated the attempt, and
his victim resisted him as before.</p>

<p>Teddy O’Doherty was brave, almost to fearlessness, but this was
too much even for him; and, at that point, he swooned away into
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>He probably remained in that condition but a short time. When
his senses came back to him, he was lying on his back, with his
face upturned to the moon. For a few moments, he was naturally
enough bewildered, and he lay motionless until it all came back
to him. Then he half whispered.</p>

<p>"<em>I’m dead and ate up!</em> how qu’ar it saams! I never knew
it felt this way. Yis, Teddy, you’re ate up!"</p>

<p>Gradually a doubt began to filter through his mind, and he moved
his hands about his person to see whether he was all there. His
load of provisions were shoved from his back, and lay to one side,
while he soon discovered that he was all there and had suffered
no physical harm!</p>

<p>Yes; the consciousness finally came to the terrified Irishman
that he was still in the land of the living. There was not a wound
or scratch upon his person, nor had the food been disturbed, except
by the mere act of displacement.</p>

<p>"Begorrah, Teddy O’Doherty, but it’s your own mither’s son that
ye be," he soliloquized, not a little delighted; "but it’s so
different that ye feel, that ye’ll have to have somebody to inthrodooce
ye to yersilf. I wonder ef that ould craythur is watching fur
me."</p>

<p>The Celt cautiously raised his head and looked about him. There
was nothing to be seen of the dreaded beast, look in whatever
direction he chose.</p>

<p>"Ef it wasn’t me that wasn’t me, but the baast, then it’s mesilf
that would be afther ating Teddy O’Doherty, and be the same towken
that I haven’t, I’m sartin the baast isn’t human," concluded Teddy,
as he slowly clambered to his feet and furtively glanced about
him.</p>

<p>"Thank the good Lord, and the Vargin, that I’m alive!" he exclaimed,
gratefully, as he began picking up his provisions again. "I s’pose
the craythur wasn’t hungry, and whin he was pokin’ his nose about
me, it’s likely that he was thrying to pick me pockets."</p>

<p>Filled with wonder at his unaccountable escape from the monster,
the Celt begun his walk homeward again. He reached and passed
up and over the ridge without discovering any thing of his dreaded
enemy. Turning aside, he found his horse quietly grazing where
he had left him, and, deeming him as safe there as any where else,
he permitted him to remain.</p>

<p>He was now within a short distance of the camp of his friends,
and was proceeding in his quiet manner, when a cold thrill ran
through him at the sound of that appalling bark.</p>

<p>Turning his head, he saw the beast on a full gallop, coming down
the ridge, and scarcely a hundred feet distant.</p>

<p>It was like the explosion of a bombshell behind Teddy, and he
broke into a wild run, bounding through the timber and up to the
camp-fire with the exclamations that have been recorded.</p>

<p>A horde of mounted Blackfeet, or a dozen grizzly bears, could
not have created greater consternation. Old Stebbins and Black
Tom, as will be remembered, had been conversing about the mysterious
creature, and their minds were full of it.</p>

<p>Instantly they leaped to their feet, and stared out in the gloom.</p>

<p>"Whar is he?" demanded Black Tom.</p>

<p>"Close behint me," replied the terrified Irishman, running around
to the opposite side of the camp-fire.</p>

<p>"I don’t see him&mdash;b’ars and bufflers! thar he comes!"</p>

<p>Unconsciously the two trappers took their position side by side.
They had stood by each other in many fearful and dangerous scenes,
and neither would desert the other at this time.</p>

<p>As Tom spoke, both he and his companion caught sight of the hideous
brute, coming through the bushes straight toward them. It was
walking quite slowly, and at intervals gave forth that peculiar
bark, which had a strange, cavernous sound.</p>

<p>Viewed from the front, its appearance was appalling in the extreme.
Its head was of vast size, its mouth in latitude resembled that
of the alligator. As it advanced, the firelight shone full in
its face, and curiously enough neither of the hunters could discern
any thing that resembled eyes, although of course it was sentient.</p>

<p>Very naturally the two trappers had determined to send their
messengers into his eyes, satisfied that, if there was nothing
superhuman in its make, it could not prove invulnerable to such
an attack; but they were unexpectedly deprived of this great advantage,
seeing which Black Tom whispered to his companion:</p>

<p>"Aim under the throat, and maybe we’ll reach its heart."</p>

<p>No more than a dozen feet separated men and beast, when the former
simultaneously drew their guns to their shoulders, took a quick
but sure aim and fired.</p>

<p>They might as well have buried their bullets in the solid oak
beside them, for all the good that was accomplished. That peculiar
bark of the brute may have been caused by the sound as well as
by the bullet of the gun.</p>

<p>It stood a moment, as if looking steadily at the men, and then
resumed its advance.</p>

<p>This was too much, and with a howl of terror the three men scattered
and were up the nearest saplings in a twinkling. Here they felt
a certain degree of safety, as it was hardly probable that such
a constructed creature could "climb a tree."</p>

<p>"But if he chooses," replied Teddy, from his perch in reply to
this remark, "he kin pull up the tree by its ruts, and crack our
heads togither."</p>

<p>Finding himself master of the situation, the mysterious brute
took every thing very quietly. Teddy having fastened the meat
to his back, had not removed it upon climbing the tree, so that
there was nothing on the ground for it to devour; and the trappers
were too veteran hunters to fail to carry their weapons with them.</p>

<p>The camp-fire had just been heaped up with fuel, and was now
roaring and crackling furiously. The brute seemed to contemplate
it a few minutes in quiet wonderment, and then he sat down upon
his haunches like a bear, and looked fixedly at the blaze.</p>

<p>"Look at the spalpeen!" called out Teddy. "Did ye ever see sich
impudence. He looks as if he owned the grove and us too."</p>

<p>"That’s jest ’bout what he does own," replied Black Tom, with
grim humor.</p>

<p>"He reminds mesilf, whin I used to sit down in the pratie patch
at home, in Tipperary, and think I owned the whole of it, and
so I would, if it hadn’t been that anuther chap claimed it."</p>

<p>During these few minutes, all three of the men had been reloading
their guns, as best they could in their circumscribed position.
When ready it was arranged that they should discharge their pieces
together, at the head of the monster.</p>

<p>This was done, and incredible as it may seem, without result.
Struck it undoubtedly was, for it gave a slight twitch with its
head, as a dog will do, when pestered with a fly, but it certainly
was no more harmed than it would have been by such an insect.</p>

<p>At so short a distance, with such a plain target, it would have
been impossible for the bullets to miss their mark, so that no
refuge from the difficulty could be taken in that supposition.</p>

<p>The brute sat motionless a moment, with his gaze upon the burning
faggots, and then rising from his sitting position, walked around
to the other side of the fire, and took his seat directly under
the sapling which was the refuge of Teddy O’Doherty.</p>

<p>"Ye dirthy blaguard, ye needn’t come there," he growled, as he
looked down at him; "ye’re a dirthy dog, as me Bridget used to
obsarve, affectionately, when she saw me comin’ in her shanty
av Soonday avening."</p>

<p>"He’s fell in love with you," remarked Black Tom, who thought
he could afford to jest a little, so long as the brute made no
active demonstrations against him.</p>

<p>"I guess he’s turned watch-dog," said Stebbins, "and is going
to keep the other spooks away."</p>

<p>It may be stated that the demonstration which the trappers had
just received of the invulnerability of the mysterious creature
was complete in every respect. They would have staked any thing
and every thing that it could have stood without flinching before
a battery of columbiads. Under these circumstances, therefore,
they did not deem it wise to waste any more powder in firing upon
it.</p>

<p>So they reserved their ammunition, and made themselves as comfortable
as possible in their elevated position, waiting until it should
take it into its head to depart.</p>

<p>"S’pose he stays here a week or two?" said Stebbins.</p>

<p>"Then we must do the same."</p>

<p>"Why didn’t we think of the fire?" muttered Black Tom.</p>

<p>"What did yer want to think ’bout <em>that</em>?" asked old Stebbins.</p>

<p>"If he don’t care fur rifle-balls, it’s likely he’s afeard of
that. If I had only slammed a lot of fire in his face, he’d left."</p>

<p>"Better not try it," returned the elder.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"’Tain’t noways likely it would have hurt him, and he might have
cotched you up and slammed you in the fire."</p>

<p>This was a fearful supposition, and all three shuddered at the
thought of the brute venting his spite in such a manner.</p>

<p>As it was certain that nothing could be done in the way of vanquishing
the monster, the question now was as to how long he would remain.
While he was present, no one could entertain any idea of descending,
and if he should take it into his head to spend several days there,
there certainly was reason to fear the most serious consequences.</p>

<p>An hour passed and still the brute sat as motionless as a statue.
Being several yards from the camp-fire, its fitful light gave
him a most terrible appearance. The trio kept up a pointless conversation
for a long time, Teddy gradually withdrawing from it, until he
became silent altogether.</p>

<p>No notice was taken of this fact for some time, until suddenly
Black Tom became suspicious and called his name. Receiving no
response, he exclaimed, to old Stebbins:</p>

<p>"Bufflers and Blackfeet! he’s goin’ to sleep!"</p>

<p>"If he does he’s gone, sure. Wake him up!"</p>

<p>"Teddy! Teddy!" called Tom, "wake up, or you never will."</p>

<p>"Aoogh! what&mdash;"</p>

<p>Too late. The Irishman, in his bewilderment, did not comprehend
his perilous position, and making an uneasy movement, lost his
hold and fell!</p>

<p>And fell in such a manner that he struck full length upon the
back of the frightful brute!</p>

<p>A shudder of horror shook the trappers, as they looked down upon
what they regarded the certain death of their comrade, who gave
a shriek of terror as he rolled like a log helpless to the ground.</p>

<p>The brute started, uttered his sharp, bark-like cry, and then
bolted away and vanished in the darkness, without offering to
harm the man who lay helpless at his feet.</p>

<p>"Begorra! but he’s a gintleman, as Micky Dunn obsarved of the
man that cracked his crown. That’s the sicind time he’s give me
the go-by, and the nixt time he does it we’ll shake hands and
swear we’re friends."</p>

<p>"It beats thunder!" exclaimed old Stebbins, who was now prepared
to believe Teddy’s account of his extraordinary meeting with this
animal.</p>

<p>"It can’t be that he don’t eat men," said Black Tom, "for Stumpy
Sam said he see’d it chaw up one of their men."</p>

<p>"I guess he don’t like Irishmen."</p>

<p>"It’s meself that thinks he does," retorted Teddy, "for he’s
tr’ated me like a gintleman all the way through."</p>

<p>"Ain’t yer going to climb up ag’in?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"What’s the use, when it’s more comfortable here, as Micky McFee
remarked when he was axed to come out of the gutter."</p>

<p>The Irishman made no attempt to re-climb the tree, although he
looked carefully about in every direction in quest of the dreaded
creature.</p>

<p>Some fifteen minutes passed and nothing was seen or heard of
their dreaded foe, when the hunters, who were excessively hungry,
cautiously descended to the ground again.</p>

<p>The first thing done was to replenish the fire, and they determined
that if the brute should reappear, they would try the effect of
dashing some of the brands in his face.</p>

<p>The next proceeding was to attack the provisions which Teddy
had brought back with him, and with such ravenous appetites, they
were not long in "throwing themselves outside" of an immense quantity
of food.</p>

<p>By this time night was well advanced, but there was no thought
of sleep upon the part of any one, excepting Teddy O’Doherty.
He had acted as sentinel the night before, and soon became drowsy
and stupid.</p>

<p>As he was entitled to rest, he was permitted to stretch out near
the fire, with his blanket gathered about him, when he speedily
sunk off into utter unconsciousness.</p>

<p>There was some apprehension regarding the horses, and after a
while Tom stole away from the fire into the grove to see whether
they had been disturbed. Having cropped their full of the rich
herbage they were found asleep, as free from alarm as was the
sleeping Teddy O’Doherty.</p>

<p>Added to the terror inspired by the very appearance of the dreaded
creature, was that of amazement at the unaccountable manner in
which it had acted toward the Irishman. Twice it had had him completely
in its power, and yet had not harmed a hair of his head.</p>

<p>Why was this? Was it possible that it had really formed a sort
of partiality toward Teddy? Such things have been known among
wild animals, but it was hardly possible in this case. What, then,
could be the explanation?</p>

<p>These were conundrums which the trappers asked themselves repeatedly,
and which as repeatedly they were compelled to "give up."</p>

<p>The night wore gradually away, but nothing more was seen of the
terrible monster. The camp-fire was kept burning brightly, and
the hunters listened attentively for sounds that might betray
his approach.</p>

<p>Once or twice a faint rustling of the leaves caused them to start
and look affrightedly out in the gloom, but they caught no glimpse
of the frightful beast. Accustomed as the hunters were to all
manner of exposure and deprivation of sleep and rest, they found
no difficulty in keeping their senses about them, even when their
bodies were not in motion.</p>

<p>It was a relief to them when the gray mist of morning began stealing
through the wood, and they saw the light of another day illuminating
wood and prairie.</p>

<p>They seemed to feel scarcely any desire for sleep, and Tom aroused
Teddy by giving him a vigorous kick.</p>

<p>"Come, git up! that beast is looking for you!"</p>

<p>"Let him look!" replied Teddy, as he roused himself. "As long
as he behaves himself so well I’ll be glad to see him."</p>

<p>There remained enough of the provisions brought by Teddy to make
a substantial breakfast, after which the horses were brought up
and saddled, and in a short time the trappers were on their way
toward the north-west.</p>

<p>They had still a short distance to travel before reaching their
destination, and while they are thus engaged we will take occasion
to refer to a few matters necessary to a full understanding of
the incidents that follow.</p>
