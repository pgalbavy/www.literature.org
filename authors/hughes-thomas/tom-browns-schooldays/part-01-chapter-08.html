&nbsp;&mdash;<em>LOWELL, </em>Stanzas on Freedom.

</p>
</div>
<p>The lower-fourth form, in which Tom found himself at the beginning
of the next half-year, was the largest form in the lower school,
and numbered upwards of forty boys. Young gentlemen of all ages
from nine to fifteen were to be found there, who expended such
part of their energies as was devoted to Latin and Greek upon
a book of Livy, the "Bucolics"  of Virgil, and the "Hecuba" of
Euripides, which were ground out in small daily portions. The
driving of this unlucky lower-fourth must have been grievous work
to the unfortunate master, for it was the most unhappily constituted
of any in the school. Here stuck the great stupid boys, who, for
the life of them, could never master the accidence&mdash;the objects
alternately of mirth and terror to the youngsters, who were daily
taking them up and laughing at them in lesson, and getting kicked
by them for so doing in play-hours. There were no less than three
unhappy fellows in tail coats, with incipient down on their chins,
whom the Doctor and the master of the form were always endeavouring
to hoist into the upper school, but whose parsing and construing
resisted the most well-meant shoves. Then came the mass of the
form, boys of eleven and twelve, the most mischievous and reckless
age of British youth, of whom East and Tom Brown were fair specimens.
As full of tricks as monkeys, and of excuses as Irishwomen, making
fun of their master, one another, and their lessons, Argus himself
would have been puzzled to keep an eye on them; and as for making
them steady or serious for half an hour together, it was simply
hopeless. The remainder of the form consisted of young prodigies
of nine and ten, who were going up the school at the rate of a
form a half-year, all boys' hands and wits being against them
in their progress. It would have been one man's work to see that
the precocious youngsters had fair play; and as the master had
a good deal besides to do, they hadn't, and were for ever being
shoved down three or four places, their verses stolen, their books
inked, their jackets whitened, and their lives otherwise made
a burden to them.</p>

<p>The lower-fourth, and all the forms below it, were heard in the
great school, and were not trusted to prepare their lessons before
coming in, but were whipped into school three-quarters of an hour
before the lesson began by their respective masters, and there,
scattered about on the benches, with dictionary and grammar, hammered
out their twenty lines of Virgil and Euripides in the midst of
babel. The masters of the lower school walked up and down the
great school together during this three-quarters of an hour, or
sat in their desks reading or looking over copies, and keeping
such order as was possible. But the lower-fourth was just now
an overgrown form, too large for any one man to attend to properly,
and consequently the elysium or ideal form of the young scapegraces
who formed the staple of it.</p>

<p>Tom, as has been said, had come up from the third with a good
character, but the temptations of the lower-fourth soon proved
too strong for him, and he rapidly fell away, and became as unmanageable
as the rest. For some weeks, indeed, he succeeded in maintaining
the appearance of steadiness, and was looked upon favourably by
his new master, whose eyes were first opened by the following
little incident.</p>

<p>Besides the desk which the master himself occupied, there was
another large unoccupied desk in the corner of the great school,
which was untenanted. To rush and seize upon this desk, which
was ascended by three steps and held four boys, was the great
object of ambition of the lower-fourthers; and the contentions
for the occupation of it bred such disorder that at last the master
forbade its use altogether. This, of course, was a challenge to
the more adventurous spirits to occupy it; and as it was capacious
enough for two boys to lie hid there completely, it was seldom
that it remained empty, notwithstanding the veto. Small holes
were cut in the front, through which the occupants watched the
masters as they walked up and down; and as lesson time approached,
one boy at a time stole out and down the steps, as the masters'
backs were turned, and mingled with the general crowd on the forms
below. Tom and East had successfully occupied the desk some half-dozen
times, and were grown so reckless that they were in the habit
of playing small games with fives balls inside when the masters
were at the other end of the big school. One day, as ill-luck
would have it, the game became more exciting than usual, and the
ball slipped through East's fingers, and rolled slowly down the
steps and out into the middle of the school, just as the masters
turned in their walk and faced round upon the desk. The young
delinquents watched their master, through the lookout holes, march
slowly down the school straight upon their retreat, while all
the boys in the neighbourhood, of course, stopped their work to
look on; and not only were they ignominiously drawn out, and caned
over the hand then and there, but their characters for steadiness
were gone from that time. However, as they only shared the fate
of some three-fourths of the rest of the form, this did not weigh
heavily upon them.</p>

<p>In fact, the only occasions on which they cared about the matter
were the monthly examinations, when the Doctor came round to examine
their form, for one long, awful hour, in the work which they had
done in the preceding month. The second monthly examination came
round soon after Tom's fall, and it was with anything but lively
anticipations that he and the other lower-fourth boys came in
to prayers on the morning of the examination day.</p>

<p>Prayers and calling-over seemed twice as short as usual, and
before they could get construes of a tithe of the hard passages
marked in the margin of their books, they were all seated round,
and the Doctor was standing in the middle, talking in whispers
to the master. Tom couldn't hear a word which passed, and never
lifted his eyes from his book; but he knew by a sort of magnetic
instinct that the Doctor's under-lip was coming out, and his eye
beginning to burn, and his gown getting gathered up more and more
tightly in his left hand. The suspense was agonizing, and Tom
knew that he was sure on such occasions to make an example of
the School-house boys. "If he would only begin," thought Tom,
"I shouldn't mind."</p>

<p>At last the whispering ceased, and the name which was called
out was not Brown. He looked up for a moment, but the Doctor's
face was too awful; Tom wouldn't have met his eye for all he was
worth, and buried himself in his book again.</p>

<p>The boy who was called up first was a clever, merry School-house
boy, one of their set; he was some connection of the Doctor's,
and a great favourite, and ran in and out of his house as he liked,
and so was selected for the first victim.</p>

<p>"Triste lupus stabulis," began the luckless youngster, and stammered
through some eight or ten lines.</p>

<p>"There, that will do," said the Doctor; "now construe."</p>

<p>On common occasions the boy could have construed the passage
well enough probably, but now his head was gone.</p>

<p>"Triste lupus, the sorrowful wolf," he began.</p>

<p>A shudder ran through the whole form, and the Doctor's wrath
fairly boiled over. He made three steps up to the construer, and
gave him a good box on the ear. The blow was not a hard one, but
the boy was so taken by surprise that he started back; the form
caught the back of his knees, and over he went on to the floor
behind. There was a dead silence over the whole school. Never
before and never again while Tom was at school did the Doctor
strike a boy in lesson. The provocation must have been great.
However, the victim had saved his form for that occasion, for
the Doctor turned to the top bench, and put on the best boys for
the rest of the hour and though, at the end of the lesson, he
gave them all such a rating as they did not forget, this terrible
field-day passed over without any severe visitations in the shape
of punishments or floggings. Forty young scapegraces expressed
their thanks to the "sorrowful wolf" in their different ways before
second lesson.</p>

<p>But a character for steadiness once gone is not easily recovered,
as Tom found; and for years afterwards he went up the school without
it, and the masters' hands were against him, and his against them.
And he regarded them, as a matter of course, as his natural enemies.</p>

<p>Matters were not so comfortable, either, in the house as they
had been; for old Brooke left at Christmas, and one or two others
of the sixth-form boys at the following Easter. Their rule had
been rough, but strong and just in the main, and a higher standard
was beginning to be set up; in fact, there had been a short foretaste
of the good time which followed some years later. Just now, however,
all threatened to return into darkness and chaos again. For the
new praepostors were either small young boys, whose cleverness
had carried them up to the top of the school, while in strength
of body and character they were not yet fit for a share in the
government; or else big fellows of the wrong sort&mdash;boys whose
friendships and tastes had a downward tendency, who had not caught
the meaning of their position and work, and felt none of its responsibilities.
So under this no-government the School-house began to see bad
times. The big fifth-form boys, who were a sporting and drinking
set, soon began to usurp power, and to fag the little boys as
if they were praepostors, and to bully and oppress any who showed
signs of resistance. The bigger sort of sixth-form boys just described
soon made common cause with the fifth, while the smaller sort,
hampered by their colleagues' desertion to the enemy, could not
make head against them. So the fags were without their lawful
masters and protectors, and ridden over rough-shod by a set of
boys whom they were not bound to obey, and whose only right over
them stood in their bodily powers; and, as old Brooke had prophesied,
the house by degrees broke up into small sets and parties, and
lost the strong feeling of fellowship which he set so much store
by, and with it much of the prowess in games and the lead in all
school matters which he had done so much to keep up.</p>

<p>In no place in the world has individual character more weight
than at a public school. Remember this, I beseech you, all you
boys who are getting into the upper forms. Now is the time in
all your lives, probably, when you may have more wide influence
for good or evil on the society you live in than you ever can
have again. Quit yourselves like men, then; speak up, and strike
out if necessary, for whatsoever is true, and manly, and lovely,
and of good report; never try to be popular, but only to do your
duty and help others to do theirs, and you may leave the tone
of feeling in the school higher than you found it, and so be doing
good which no living soul can measure to generations of your countrymen
yet unborn. For boys follow one another in herds like sheep, for
good or evil; they hate thinking, and have rarely any settled
principles. Every school, indeed, has its own traditionary standard
of right and wrong, which cannot be transgressed with impunity,
marking certain things as low and blackguard, and certain others
as lawful and right. This standard is ever varying, though it
changes only slowly and little by little; and, subject only to
such standard, it is the leading boys for the time being who give
the tone to all the rest, and make the School either a noble institution
for the training of Christian Englishmen, or a place where a young
boy will get more evil than he would if he were turned out to
make his way in London streets, or anything between these two
extremes.</p>

<p>The change for the worse in the School-house, however, didn't
press very heavily on our youngsters for some time. They were
in a good bedroom, where slept the only praepostor left who was
able to keep thorough order, and their study was in his passage.
So, though they were fagged more or less, and occasionally kicked
or cuffed by the bullies, they were, on the whole, well off; and
the fresh, brave school-life, so full of games, adventures, and
good-fellowship, so ready at forgetting, so capacious at enjoying,
so bright at forecasting, outweighed a thousand-fold their troubles
with the master of their form, and the occasional ill-usage of
the big boys in the house. It wasn't till some year or so after
the events recorded above that the praepostor of their room and
passage left. None of the other sixth-form boys would move into
their passage, and, to the disgust and indignation of Tom and
East, one morning after breakfast they were seized upon by Flashman,
and made to carry down his books and furniture into the unoccupied
study, which he had taken. From this time they began to feel the
weight of the tyranny of Flashman and his friends, and, now that
trouble had come home to their own doors, began to look out for
sympathizers and partners amongst the rest of the fags; and meetings
of the oppressed began to be held, and murmurs to arise, and plots
to be laid as to how they should free themselves and be avenged
on their enemies.</p>

<p>While matters were in this state, East and Tom were one evening
sitting in their study. They had done their work for first lesson,
and Tom was in a brown study, brooding, like a young William Tell,
upon the wrongs of fags in general, and his own in particular.</p>

<p>"I say, Scud," said he at last, rousing himself to snuff the
candle, "what right have the fifth-form boys to fag us as they
do?"</p>

<p>"No more right than you have to fag them," answered East, without
looking up from an early number of "Pickwick," which was just
coming out, and which he was luxuriously devouring, stretched
on his back on the sofa.</p>

<p>Tom relapsed into his brown study, and East went on reading and
chuckling. The contrast of the boys' faces would have given infinite
amusement to a looker-on&mdash;the one so solemn and big with mighty
purpose, the other radiant and bubbling over with fun.</p>

<p>"Do you know, old fellow, I've been thinking it over a good deal,"
began Tom again.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I know&mdash;fagging you are thinking of. Hang it all! But
listen here, Tom&mdash;here's fun. Mr. Winkle's horse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I've made up my mind," broke in Tom, "that I won't fag except
for the sixth."</p>

<p>"Quite right too, my boy," cried East, putting his finger on
the place and looking up; "but a pretty peck of troubles you'll
get into, if you're going to play that game. However, I'm all
for a strike myself, if we can get others to join. It's getting
too bad."</p>

<p>"Can't we get some sixth-form fellow to take it up?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps we might. Morgan would interfere, I think. Only,"
added East, after a moment's pause, "you see, we should have to
tell him about it, and that's against School principles. Don't
you remember what old Brooke said about learning to take our own
parts?"</p>

<p>"Ah, I wish old Brooke were back again. It was all right in his
time."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, you see, then the strongest and best fellows were
in the sixth, and the fifth-form fellows were afraid of them,
and they kept good order; but now our sixth-form fellows are too
small, and the fifth don't care for them, and do what they like
in the house."</p>

<p>"And so we get a double set of masters," cried Tom indignantly&mdash;"the
lawful ones, who are responsible to the Doctor at any rate, and
the unlawful, the tyrants, who are responsible to nobody."</p>

<p>"Down with the tyrants!" cried East; "I'm all for law and order,
and hurrah for a revolution."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't mind if it were only for young Brooke now," said
Tom; "he's such a good-hearted, gentlemanly fellow, and ought
to be in the sixth. I'd do anything for him. But that blackguard
Flashman, who never speaks to one without a kick or an oath&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The cowardly brute," broke in East&mdash;"how I hate him! And he
knows it too; he knows that you and I think him a coward. What
a bore that he's got a study in this passage! Don't you hear them
now at supper in his den? Brandy-punch going, I'll bet. I wish
the Doctor would come out and catch him. We must change our study
as soon as we can."</p>

<p>"Change or no change, I'll never fag for him again," said Tom,
thumping the table.</p>

<p>"Fa-a-a-ag!" sounded along the passage from Flashman's study.
The two boys looked at one another in silence. It had struck nine,
so the regular night-fags had left duty, and they were the nearest
to the supper-party. East sat up, and began to look comical, as
he always did under difficulties.</p>

<p>"Fa-a-a-ag!" again. No answer.</p>

<p>"Here, Brown! East! you cursed young skulks," roared out Flashman,
coming to his open door; "I know you're in; no shirking."</p>

<p>Tom stole to their door, and drew the bolts as noiselessly as
he could; East blew out the candle.</p>

<p>"Barricade the first," whispered he. "Now, Tom, mind, no surrender."</p>

<p>"Trust me for that," said Tom between his teeth.</p>

<p>In another minute they heard the supper-party turn out and come
down the passage to their door. They held their breaths, and heard
whispering, of which they only made out Flashman's words, "I know
the young brutes are in."</p>

<p>Then came summonses to open, which being unanswered, the assault
commenced. Luckily the door was a good strong oak one, and resisted
the united weight of Flashman's party. A pause followed, and they
heard a besieger remark, "They're in safe enough. Don't you see
how the door holds at top and bottom? So the bolts must be drawn.
We should have forced the lock long ago." East gave Tom a nudge,
to call attention to this scientific remark.</p>

<p>Then came attacks on particular panels, one of which at last
gave way to the repeated kicks; but it broke inwards, and the
broken pieces got jammed across (the door being lined with green
baize), and couldn't easily be removed from outside: and the besieged,
scorning further concealment, strengthened their defences by pressing
the end of their sofa against the door. So, after one or two more
ineffectual efforts, Flashman and Company retired, vowing vengeance
in no mild terms.</p>

<p>The first danger over, it only remained for the besieged to effect
a safe retreat, as it was now near bed-time. They listened intently,
and heard the supper-party resettle themselves, and then gently
drew back first one bolt and then the other. Presently the convivial
noises began again steadily. "Now then, stand by for a run," said
East, throwing the door wide open and rushing into the passage,
closely followed by Tom. They were too quick to be caught; but
Flashman was on the lookout, and sent an empty pickle-jar whizzing
after them, which narrowly missed Tom's head, and broke into twenty
pieces at the end of the passage. "He wouldn't mind killing one,
if he wasn't caught," said East, as they turned the corner.</p>

<p>There was no pursuit, so the two turned into the hall, where
they found a knot of small boys round the fire. Their story was
told. The war of independence had broken out. Who would join the
revolutionary forces? Several others present bound themselves
not to fag for the fifth form at once. One or two only edged off,
and left the rebels. What else could they do? "I've a good mind
to go to the Doctor straight," said Tom.</p>

<p>"That'll never do. Don't you remember the levy of the school
last half?"  put in another.</p>

<p>In fact, the solemn assembly, a levy of the School, had been
held, at which the captain of the School had got up, and after
premising that several instances had occurred of matters having
been reported to the masters; that this was against public morality
and School tradition; that a levy of the sixth had been held on
the subject, and they had resolved that the practice must be stopped
at once; and given out that any boy, in whatever form, who should
thenceforth appeal to a master, without having first gone to some
praepostor and laid the case before him, should be thrashed publicly,
and sent to Coventry.</p>

<p>"Well, then, let's try the sixth. Try Morgan," suggested another.
"No use"&mdash;"Blabbing won't do," was the general feeling.</p>

<p>"I'll give you fellows a piece of advice," said a voice from
the end of the hall. They all turned round with a start, and the
speaker got up from a bench on which he had been lying unobserved,
and gave himself a shake. He was a big, loose-made fellow, with
huge limbs which had grown too far through his jacket and trousers.
"Don't you go to anybody at all&mdash;you just stand out; say you won't
fag. They'll soon get tired of licking you. I've tried it on years
ago with their forerunners."</p>

<p>"No! Did you? Tell us how it was?" cried a chorus of voices,
as they clustered round him.</p>

<p>"Well, just as it is with you. The fifth form would fag us, and
I and some more struck, and we beat 'em. The good fellows left
off directly, and the bullies who kept on soon got afraid."</p>

<p>"Was Flashman here then?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and a dirty, little, snivelling, sneaking fellow he was
too. He never dared join us, and used to toady the bullies by
offering to fag for them, and peaching against the rest of us."</p>

<p>"Why wasn't he cut, then?" said East.</p>

<p>"Oh, toadies never get cut; they're too useful. Besides, he has
no end of great hampers from home, with wine and game in them;
so he toadied and fed himself into favour."</p>

<p>The quarter-to-ten bell now rang, and the small boys went off
upstairs, still consulting together, and praising their new counsellor,
who stretched himself out on the bench before the hall fire again.
There he lay, a very queer specimen of boyhood, by name Diggs,
and familiarly called "the Mucker." He was young for his size,
and a very clever fellow, nearly at the top of the fifth. His
friends at home, having regard, I suppose, to his age, and not
to his size and place in the school, hadn't put him into tails;
and even his jackets were always too small; and he had a talent
for destroying clothes and making himself look shabby. He wasn't
on terms with Flashman's set, who sneered at his dress and ways
behind his back; which he knew, and revenged himself by asking
Flashman the most disagreeable questions, and treating him familiarly
whenever a crowd of boys were round him. Neither was he intimate
with any of the other bigger boys, who were warned off by his
oddnesses, for he was a very queer fellow; besides, amongst other
failings, he had that of impecuniosity in a remarkable degree.
He brought as much money as other boys to school, but got rid
of it in no time, no one knew how; and then, being also reckless,
borrowed from any one; and when his debts accumulated and creditors
pressed, would have an auction in the hall of everything he possessed
in the world, selling even his school-books, candlestick, and
study table. For weeks after one of these auctions, having rendered
his study uninhabitable, he would live about in the fifth-form
room and hall, doing his verses on old letter-backs and odd scraps
of paper, and learning his lessons no one knew how. He never meddled
with any little boy, and was popular with them, though they all
looked on him with a sort of compassion, and called him "Poor
Diggs," not being able to resist appearances, or to disregard
wholly even the sneers of their enemy Flashman. However, he seemed
equally indifferent to the sneers of big boys and the pity of
small ones, and lived his own queer life with much apparent enjoyment
to himself. It is necessary to introduce Diggs thus particularly,
as he not only did Tom and East good service in their present
warfare, as is about to be told, but soon afterwards, when he
got into the sixth, chose them for his fags, and excused them
from study-fagging, thereby earning unto himself eternal gratitude
from them and all who are interested in their history.</p>

<p>And seldom had small boys more need of a friend, for the morning
after the siege the storm burst upon the rebels in all its violence.
Flashman laid wait, and caught Tom before second lesson, and receiving
a point-blank "No" when told to fetch his hat, seized him and
twisted his arm, and went through the other methods of torture
in use. "He couldn't make me cry, though," as Tom said triumphantly
to the rest of the rebels; "and I kicked his shins well, I know."
And soon it crept out that a lot of the fags were in league, and
Flashman excited his associates to join him in bringing the young
vagabonds to their senses; and the house was filled with constant
chasings, and sieges, and lickings of all sorts; and in return,
the bullies' beds were pulled to pieces and drenched with water,
and their names written up on the walls with every insulting epithet
which the fag invention could furnish. The war, in short, raged
fiercely; but soon, as Diggs had told them, all the better fellows
in the fifth gave up trying to fag them, and public feeling began
to set against Flashman and his two or three intimates, and they
were obliged to keep their doings more secret, but being thorough
bad fellows, missed no opportunity of torturing in private. Flashman
was an adept in all ways, but above all in the power of saying
cutting and cruel things, and could often bring tears to the eyes
of boys in this way, which all the thrashings in the world wouldn't
have wrung from them.</p>

<p>And as his operations were being cut short in other directions,
he now devoted himself chiefly to Tom and East, who lived at his
own door, and would force himself into their study whenever he
found a chance, and sit there, sometimes alone, and sometimes
with a companion, interrupting all their work, and exulting in
the evident pain which every now and then he could see he was
inflicting on one or the other.</p>

<p>The storm had cleared the air for the rest of the house, and
a better state of things now began than there had been since old
Brooke had left; but an angry, dark spot of thunder-cloud still
hung over the end of the passage where Flashman's study and that
of East and Tom lay.</p>

<p>He felt that they had been the first rebels, and that the rebellion
had been to a great extent successful; but what above all stirred
the hatred and bitterness of his heart against them was that in
the frequent collisions which there had been of late they had
openly called him coward and sneak. The taunts were too true to
be forgiven. While he was in the act of thrashing them, they would
roar out instances of his funking at football, or shirking some
encounter with a lout of half his own size. These things were
all well enough known in the house, but to have his own disgrace
shouted out by small boys, to feel that they despised him, to
be unable to silence them by any amount of torture, and to see
the open laugh and sneer of his own associates (who were looking
on, and took no trouble to hide their scorn from him, though they
neither interfered with his bullying nor lived a bit the less
intimately with him), made him beside himself. Come what might,
he would make those boys' lives miserable. So the strife settled
down into a personal affair between Flashman and our youngsters&mdash;a
war to the knife, to be fought out in the little cockpit at the
end of the bottom passage.</p>

<p>Flashman, be it said, was about seventeen years old, and big
and strong of his age. He played well at all games where pluck
wasn't much wanted, and managed generally to keep up appearances
where it was; and having a bluff, off-hand manner, which passed
for heartiness, and considerable powers of being pleasant when
he liked, went down with the school in general for a good fellow
enough. Even in the School-house, by dint of his command of money,
the constant supply of good things which he kept up, and his adroit
toadyism, he had managed to make himself not only tolerated, but
rather popular amongst his own contemporaries; although young
Brooke scarcely spoke to him, and one or two others of the right
sort showed their opinions of him whenever a chance offered. But
the wrong sort happened to be in the ascendant just now, and so
Flashman was a formidable enemy for small boys. This soon became
plain enough. Flashman left no slander unspoken, and no deed undone,
which could in any way hurt his victims, or isolate them from
the rest of the house. One by one most of the other rebels fell
away from them, while Flashman's cause prospered, and several
other fifth-form boys began to look black at them and ill-treat
them as they passed about the house. By keeping out of bounds,
or at all events out of the house and quadrangle, all day, and
carefully barring themselves in at night, East and Tom managed
to hold on without feeling very miserable; but it was as much
as they could do. Greatly were they drawn then towards old Diggs,
who, in an uncouth way, began to take a good deal of notice of
them, and once or twice came to their study when Flashman was
there, who immediately decamped in consequence. The boys thought
that Diggs must have been watching.</p>

<p>When therefore, about this time, an auction was one night announced
to take place in the hall, at which, amongst the superfluities
of other boys, all Diggs's penates for the time being were going
to the hammer, East and Tom laid their heads together, and resolved
to devote their ready cash (some four shillings sterling) to redeem
such articles as that sum would cover. Accordingly, they duly
attended to bid, and Tom became the owner of two lots of Diggs's
things: &mdash;Lot 1, price one-and-threepence, consisting (as
the auctioneer remarked) of a "valuable assortment of old metals,"
in the shape of a mouse-trap, a cheese-toaster without a handle,
and a saucepan: Lot 2, of a villainous dirty table-cloth and green-baize
curtain; while East, for one-and-sixpence, purchased a leather
paper-case, with a lock but no key, once handsome, but now much
the worse for wear. But they had still the point to settle of
how to get Diggs to take the things without hurting his feelings.
This they solved by leaving them in his study, which was never
locked when he was out. Diggs, who had attended the auction, remembered
who had bought the lots, and came to their study soon after, and
sat silent for some time, cracking his great red finger-joints.
Then he laid hold of their verses, and began looking over and
altering them, and at last got up, and turning his back to them,
said, "You're uncommon good-hearted little beggars, you two. I
value that paper-case; my sister gave it to me last holidays.
I won't forget." And so he tumbled out into the passage, leaving
them somewhat embarrassed, but not sorry that he knew what they
had done.</p>

<p>The next morning was Saturday, the day on which the allowances
of one shilling a week were paid&mdash;an important event to spendthrift
youngsters; and great was the disgust amongst the small fry to
hear that all the allowances had been impounded for the Derby
lottery. That great event in the English year, the Derby, was
celebrated at Rugby in those days by many lotteries. It was not
an improving custom, I own, gentle reader, and led to making books,
and betting, and other objectionable results; but when our great
Houses of Palaver think it right to stop the nation's business
on that day and many of the members bet heavily themselves, can
you blame us boys for following the example of our betters? At
any rate we did follow it. First there was the great school lottery,
where the first prize was six or seven pounds; then each house
had one or more separate lotteries. These were all nominally voluntary,
no boy being compelled to put in his shilling who didn't choose
to do so. But besides Flashman, there were three or four other
fast, sporting young gentlemen in the Schoolhouse, who considered
subscription a matter of duty and necessity; and so, to make their
duty come easy to the small boys, quietly secured the allowances
in a lump when given out for distribution, and kept them. It was
no use grumbling&mdash;so many fewer tartlets and apples were eaten
and fives balls bought on that Saturday; and after locking-up,
when the money would otherwise have been spent, consolation was
carried to many a small boy by the sound of the night-fags shouting
along the passages, "Gentlemen sportsmen of the School-house;
the lottery's going to be drawn in the hall." It was pleasant
to be called a gentleman sportsman, also to have a chance of drawing
a favourite horse.</p>

<p>The hall was full of boys, and at the head of one of the long
tables stood the sporting interest, with a hat before them, in
which were the tickets folded up. One of them then began calling
out the list of the house. Each boy as his name was called drew
a ticket from the hat, and opened it; and most of the bigger boys,
after drawing, left the hall directly to go back to their studies
or the fifth-form room. The sporting interest had all drawn blanks,
and they were sulky accordingly; neither of the favourites had
yet been drawn, and it had come down to the upper-fourth. So now,
as each small boy came up and drew his ticket, it was seized and
opened by Flashman, or some other of the standers-by. But no great
favourite is drawn until it comes to the Tadpole's turn, and he
shuffles up and draws, and tries to make off, but is caught, and
his ticket is opened like the rest.</p>

<p>"Here you are! Wanderer&mdash;the third favourite!" shouts the opener.</p>

<p>"I say, just give me my ticket, please," remonstrates Tadpole.</p>

<p>"Hullo! don't be in a hurry," breaks in Flashman; "what'll you
sell Wanderer for now?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to sell," rejoins Tadpole.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you! Now listen, you young fool: you don't know anything
about it; the horse is no use to you. He won't win, but I want
him as a hedge. Now, I'll give you half a crown for him." Tadpole
holds out, but between threats and cajoleries at length sells
half for one shilling and sixpence&mdash;about a fifth of its fair
market value; however, he is glad to realize anything, and, as
he wisely remarks, "Wanderer mayn't win, and the tizzy is safe
anyhow."</p>

<p>East presently comes up and draws a blank. Soon after comes Tom's
turn. His ticket, like the others, is seized and opened. "Here
you are then,"  shouts the opener, holding it up&mdash;"Harkaway! 
&mdash;By Jove, Flashey, your young friend's in luck."</p>

<p>"Give me the ticket," says Flashman, with an oath, leaning across
the table with open hand and his face black with rage.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like it?" replies the opener, not a bad fellow
at the bottom, and no admirer of Flashman. "Here, Brown, catch
hold." And he hands the ticket to Tom, who pockets it. Whereupon
Flashman makes for the door at once, that Tom and the ticket may
not escape, and there keeps watch until the drawing is over and
all the boys are gone, except the sporting set of five or six,
who stay to compare books, make bets, and so on; Tom, who doesn't
choose to move while Flashman is at the door; and East, who stays
by his friend, anticipating trouble. The sporting set now gathered
round Tom. Public opinion wouldn't allow them actually to rob
him of his ticket, but any humbug or intimidation by which he
could be driven to sell the whole or part at an undervalue was
lawful.</p>

<p>"Now, young Brown, come, what'll you sell me Harkaway for? I
hear he isn't going to start. I'll give you five shillings for
him," begins the boy who had opened the ticket. Tom, remembering
his good deed, and moreover in his forlorn state wishing to make
a friend, is about to accept the offer, when another cries out,
"I'll give you seven shillings." Tom hesitated and looked from
one to the other.</p>

<p>"No, no!" said Flashman, pushing in, "leave me to deal with him;
we'll draw lots for it afterwards. Now sir, you know me: you'll
sell Harkaway to us for five shillings, or you'll repent it."</p>

<p>"I won't sell a bit of him," answered Tom shortly.</p>

<p>"You hear that now!" said Flashman, turning to the others. "He's
the coxiest young blackguard in the house. I always told you so.
We're to have all the trouble and risk of getting up the lotteries
for the benefit of such fellows as he."</p>

<p>Flashman forgets to explain what risk they ran, but he speaks
to willing ears. Gambling makes boys selfish and cruel as well
as men.</p>

<p>"That's true. We always draw blanks," cried one.&mdash;"Now, sir,
you shall sell half, at any rate."</p>

<p>"I won't," said Tom, flushing up to his hair, and lumping them
all in his mind with his sworn enemy.</p>

<p>"Very well then; let's roast him," cried Flashman, and catches
hold of Tom by the collar. One or two boys hesitate, but the rest
join in. East seizes Tom's arm, and tries to pull him away, but
is knocked back by one of the boys, and Tom is dragged along struggling.
His shoulders are pushed against the mantelpiece, and he is held
by main force before the fire, Flashman drawing his trousers tight
by way of extra torture. Poor East, in more pain even than Tom,
suddenly thinks of Diggs, and darts off to find him. "Will you
sell now for ten shillings?" says one boy who is relenting.</p>

<p>Tom only answers by groans and struggles.</p>

<p>"I say, Flashey, he has had enough," says the same boy, dropping
the arm he holds.</p>

<p>"No, no; another turn'll do it," answers Flashman. But poor Tom
is done already, turns deadly pale, and his head falls forward
on his breast, just as Diggs, in frantic excitement, rushes into
the hall with East at his heels.</p>

<p>"You cowardly brutes!" is all he can say, as he catches Tom from
them and supports him to the hall table. "Good God! he's dying.
Here, get some cold water&mdash;run for the housekeeper."</p>

<p>Flashman and one or two others slink away; the rest, ashamed
and sorry, bend over Tom or run for water, while East darts off
for the housekeeper. Water comes, and they throw it on his hands
and face, and he begins to come to. "Mother!"&mdash;the words came
feebly and slowly&mdash;"it's very cold to-night." Poor old Diggs is
blubbering like a child. "Where am I?" goes on Tom, opening his
eyes, "Ah! I remember now." And he shut his eyes again and groaned.</p>

<p>"I say," is whispered, "we can't do any good, and the housekeeper
will be here in a minute." And all but one steal away. He stays
with Diggs, silent and sorrowful, and fans Tom's face.</p>

<p>The housekeeper comes in with strong salts, and Tom soon recovers
enough to sit up. There is a smell of burning. She examines his
clothes, and looks up inquiringly. The boys are silent.</p>

<p>"How did he come so?" No answer. "There's been some bad work
here," she adds, looking very serious, "and I shall speak to the
Doctor about it."  Still no answer.</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better carry him to the sick-room?" suggests Diggs.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can walk now," says Tom; and, supported by East and the
housekeeper, goes to the sick-room. The boy who held his ground
is soon amongst the rest, who are all in fear of their lives.
"Did he peach?"  "Does she know about it?"</p>

<p>"Not a word; he's a stanch little fellow." And pausing a moment,
he adds, "I'm sick of this work; what brutes we've been!"</p>

<p>Meantime Tom is stretched on the sofa in the housekeeper's room,
with East by his side, while she gets wine and water and other
restoratives.</p>

<p>"Are you much hurt, dear old boy?" whispers East.</p>

<p>"Only the back of my legs," answers Tom. They are indeed badly
scorched, and part of his trousers burnt through. But soon he
is in bed with cold bandages. At first he feels broken, and thinks
of writing home and getting taken away; and the verse of a hymn
he had learned years ago sings through his head, and he goes to
sleep, murmuring,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where the wicked cease from troubling, And the weary are at
rest."</p>

<p>But after a sound night's rest, the old boy-spirit comes back
again. East comes in, reporting that the whole house is with him;
and he forgets everything, except their old resolve never to be
beaten by that bully Flashman.</p>

<p>Not a word could the housekeeper extract from either of them,
and though the Doctor knew all that she knew that morning, he
never knew any more.</p>

<p>I trust and believe that such scenes are not possible now at
school, and that lotteries and betting-books have gone out; but
I am writing of schools as they were in our time, and must give
the evil with the good.</p>
