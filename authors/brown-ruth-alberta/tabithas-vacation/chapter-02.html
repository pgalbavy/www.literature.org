<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>"You really think you want to do it?"  Mr. Catt glanced quizzically
from one bright, girlish face to the other as his fingers gently
stroked the red tresses and the black hovering so close to his
knee.</p>

<p>"Sure, daddy!" promptly answered Tabitha, patting the arm nearest
her in a fashion that a year before she never would have dreamed
of.</p>

<p>"Perfectly sure!" repeated Gloriana, snuggling closer to the
big armchair in which her adopted father sat, and smiling contentedly
at thought of the new life opening up before her.</p>

<p>"Two weeks mean fourteen whole days," he warned them.</p>

<p>"Yes," they giggled, "fourteen whole days!"</p>

<p>"And six lively children can raise quite a racket."</p>

<p>"The house is too far from the rest of town for their noise to
bother anyone else," Tabitha reminded him.</p>

<p>"That's another point.  What would you do if burglars broke in
at night?  You would be too far from town to call help."</p>

<p>"There is nothing at McKittrick's to burgle," his daughter retorted
triumphantly.  "I am not afraid."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Gloriana, though somewhat faintly, for of a sudden
a new phase of the matter had presented itself.  She <em>was</em>
still afraid of the black desert nights, and burglars were a constant
source of terror to her, though never in all her life had she
encountered any of that species of mankind.</p>

<p>"The cottage on the cliff is no more isolated than our cottage
here in the hollow, now that the Carsons are away," continued
the black-haired girl.  "It would be just as easy&mdash;easier, in
fact, to get help if we needed it there, than here; for the McKittrick
house is on the side of the mountain overlooking the town, while
our place is hidden from the rest of Silver Bow by that hill. 
We can see only the roof of the assayer's office from here, and
that is the nearest building to ours except Carrie's house."</p>

<p>"That's true!" exclaimed Gloriana with such an air of relief
that Mr. Catt could not refrain from smiling.</p>

<p>"And besides, nothing is going to happen in two weeks," continued
Tabitha.</p>

<p>"Suppose Miss Davis doesn't return in two weeks?  I thought you
wanted to spend your summer at the beach."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Davis will be back on time," was the confident reply. 
"And we had planned to stay here a few weeks anyway, you know. 
Myra won't be looking for us before the first of July, for we
had expected Tom would come home early in the summer for his vacation
instead of having to wait until fall, and so made our plans accordingly."</p>

<p>He smiled at the grown-up air she had assumed, then sighed, for
something in her quiet self-assurance and dignified poise suddenly
brought home to him the realization that his little girl was fast
growing up.  The sensitive, rebellious, little spitfire of a few
months ago had developed into a charming, gentle-mannered maid;
and while he rejoiced in gaining so sweet a daughter, he disliked
to lose the wild, untamed elf who had so suddenly blossomed into
a young lady before he could in any measure atone for the unhappy
years of her loveless childhood.  He would have kept her a little
girl all her life, had he been able; but here she was springing
up into the beauty of a glorious womanhood before his very eyes. 
So he sighed as he thought of his lost opportunities, then abruptly
asked, "How old are you, Tabitha?"</p>

<p>"Going on sixteen, daddy."</p>

<p>"And you, my other daughter?" turning to Gloriana sitting silently
on her low stool by his side.</p>

<p>"Fourteen, sir."</p>

<p>"Rather youthful housekeepers," he drawled, teasingly.</p>

<p>"But experienced in spite of youth," Tabitha gayly retorted. 
"Why, Miss King says we are the two most promising domestic science
pupils she has.  Now what do you think of that?"</p>

<p>"That she is right," came the prompt though unexpected reply;
"and if you really think you want to play Good Samaritan for a
couple weeks, you have my hearty sanction.  The fact of the matter
is, I find it impossible to be here at home much for the next
fortnight, myself; possibly not at all after tonight.  So you
might just as well be mothering the McKittricks as left alone
in this end of the town, so far as I can see."</p>

<p>"I knew you would say yes," sighed Tabitha contentedly.  "You
shall see what model housekeepers your daughters can be.  We'll
make you proud of us."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it," he answered heartily.  "But if you begin
your arduous duties to-morrow, it is time you were in bed this
minute.  Fly away now!"</p>

<p>So they ran laughingly away to their room, both secretly glad
of the chance to seek their pillows an hour earlier, for that
day at the McKittrick cottage had been a busy one, and though
neither would acknowledge it to the other, feet, arms and backs
ached sadly.  But the next morning, after a refreshing night's
sleep, the duet was ready and eager for the novel role they were
about to play; and just as soon as their own simple tasks were
done, the necessary clothes packed and the little cottage made
secure for its two weeks of solitude, they tramped merrily up
the steep path to the Eagles' Nest, and entered upon their summer
vacation as housekeepers for a family of six, as Susie expressed
it.</p>

<p>Everything was topsy-turvy in the excitement of getting the injured
father, and weary, distracted mother started on their brief journey;
but finally they were off, and a row of sober-faced children stood
on the bluff overlooking the flats below, watching the train puff
its way slowly out of sight behind the mountains.</p>

<p>With the last glimpse of the departing cars, the sense of responsibility
in her new charge descended upon the shoulders of the volunteer
housekeeper, and Tabitha was for a brief moment appalled at the
task which she had so rashly undertaken.</p>

<p>"Six children to look after for two whole weeks!" she gasped
in dismay. Then her courage returned with a rush.  "Why, Tabitha
Catt, you coward! I am ashamed of you!  If you can't take care
of six children for two short weeks, particularly with Gloriana
to help, you are not good for much!"  Resolutely she turned toward
the house, saying briskly, to hide her own wavering spirits, "Well,
folkses, let's have chocolate pie for supper!"</p>

<p>"Oh, goody!" cried Inez, whirling about to follow her leader;
and at mention of these words, the faces of the whole group brightened
wonderfully.</p>

<p>"Can't we have some cake, too?  Mamma said we might if you knew
how to make it."</p>

<p>"Knew how to make it?" boasted Tabitha scornfully.  "Well, I
should say we do!  What kind will you have?"</p>

<p>"Nut loaf," quickly responded Mercedes, who knew from experience
how delicious Tabitha's nut loaves were.</p>

<p>"Angel cake," wheedled Susie, with her most engaging smile.</p>

<p>"Frosted with chocolate," added Inez.</p>

<p>"Devil's food," suggested Irene.</p>

<p>"Cookies," pleaded Rosslyn, who had a boy's fondness for that
particular delicacy.</p>

<p>"Dingerbread," lisped the baby.</p>

<p>And Tabitha laughed.  "That's quite a collection, my dears."</p>

<p>"I should say so!" gasped Gloriana.  "We can't make them all
to-night. In fact, it is nearly four o'clock now.  There isn't
time for both pie and cake."</p>

<p>"Unless we do make gingerbread, as Janie suggested," said Tabitha
slowly, seeing the look of disappointment clouding the row of
round, serious faces watching them so expectantly.</p>

<p>"Wiv raisins," coaxed Rosslyn.  "Lots of 'em!"</p>

<p>Instantly the faces brightened again.  "Oh, yes, that's the way
we like it best," chorused the four older members.</p>

<p>"And let us seed them," pleaded Inez.  "Mamma often lets us."</p>

<p>"She won't let us eat more'n twelve," added Irene hopefully,
"and we can work real fast."</p>

<p>"Well, you will have to if we have gingerbread for supper," said
Gloriana.  "I supposed the raisins were already seeded.  Will
we have time, Tabitha?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if everyone hustles, I reckon.  Mercy, you know where things
are in the pantry.  Supposing you get out the spices, sugar, flour,
and things.  Susie and the twins stone the raisins; and, Rosslyn,
you might bring in some small wood for the stove.  We'll use the
range to-night, because I have baked in that oven before and know
how it works, but won't know until I experiment with it, how the
gasolene oven bakes."</p>

<p>While she was issuing orders, Tabitha flaxed blithely about the
little kitchen, lighting the fire, hunting up cooking utensils,
and beginning the process of making chocolate pie, leaving Gloriana
to wrestle with the mysteries of a raisin gingerbread.</p>

<p>Anxious for the coming treat, the children obediently flew to
their various tasks; and soon voices buzzed busily, while the
little hands tried their best to hurry.</p>

<p>"There!" breathed Tabitha at last, lifting a red, perspiring
face from an inspection of two beautifully frosted pies in the
oven, "they are done.  Don't they look fine?  Now you can put
in your gingerbread whenever you are ready, Glory.  I'll set these
on the wash bench outside to cool, while I hustle up the rest
of the supper."</p>

<p>"Mamma always puts her pies in the pantry window," volunteered
Irene, not wishing to have the tempting delicacy removed from
her sight.</p>

<p>"But they will cool quicker in the open air," explained Tabitha. 
"And supper will be ready so soon that they won't be cool enough
to eat if we set them in the window.  Now, Mercy<hr>"</p>

<p>"Oh, Kitty," came a sudden wail of alarm from the dooryard where
Rosslyn was still busy with his basket of chips, "Janie is gone! 
I can't find her anywhere!"</p>

<p>Tabitha dropped her platter of cold potatoes which she was preparing
to warm over; Mercedes hastily left her dishpan where she was
piling up the soiled kitchen utensils which the youthful cooks
had used with extravagant hand; Susie and the twins abruptly deserted
the raisin jar; and all bolted for the door.</p>

<p>Only Gloriana remained at her post.  She had arrived at the most
critical stage of her gingerbread making, and though her first
impulse was to join in the search for the missing baby with the
rest of her mates, her thrifty bringing-up reminded her that in
the meantime the cake would spoil.  So she paused long enough
to dump in the cupful of raisins still standing on the doorsill,
where the seeders had been sitting at their task.  Giving the
mixture a final beat, she poured the spicy brown dough into the
baking sheet, thrust it into the oven, adjusted the dampers, and
followed the example of the others, setting out down the rocky
path as rapidly as her lameness would permit.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, toiling up the steep trail on the other side of the
house, came a tiny, tired figure, almost ready to drop from her
unusual exertions.  Her dress was torn in a dozen places where
the cruel mesquite had caught her as she passed, one shoe was
unlaced, one stocking hung in rolls about the plump, scratched
ankle, she wore no hat, and her fair hair was sadly tousled by
the wind and her struggle through sagebrush and Spanish bayonets. 
Altogether, she presented a woeful spectacle; but in spite of
it all, she clasped tightly in one chubby fist, a soiled and crumpled
letter, which every now and then she examined critically, having
discovered that the warmth and moisture of her fat hands left
tiny, smudgy fingerprints on the white envelope, and being anxious
to present a clean document to her wondering audience when she
should have reached her goal.  But oh, it did seem so far up to
the Eagles' Nest, and the way was so rough for her little feet!
Still she kept plodding wearily along, and at length reached the
end of her journey, only to find the house silent and deserted.</p>

<p>"Mercy!" she piped shrilly, pushing open the screen and stumbling
into the hot kitchen.  "I'se dot a letter!  Where is you?  Susie! 
Rossie!"</p>

<p>Still no answer.  Puzzled at this unusual state of affairs, she
raced from room to room as fast as her short, tired legs would
carry her, but no one was there.</p>

<p>"Tabby!" she shrieked.  "Dory!  What did you leave me for?"</p>

<p>A panic seized her.  She had been deserted!  Tears gathered in
her sea-blue eyes, and trickled in rivulets down her flushed cheeks. 
She was afraid to stay alone.  Why had everyone left her?  Back
to the kitchen she pattered.  It was empty, but a fire still burned
in the stove and savory odors from the oven lured her on.  Curiosity
overcame her fear for a moment, and with a mighty tug, she jerked
open the door, revealing Gloriana's gingerbread just done to a
turn.</p>

<p>"Dingerbread!" cried the child, gloating over the huge, golden
sheet which smelled, oh, so good!  "I want some now!"  And forgetting
that the oven was hot, she seized the pan with both chubby fists,
but instantly let go her hold and roared with pain, for ten rosy
fingers were cruelly burned, and how they did smart!</p>

<p>Suddenly above the wail of her lusty voice came the sound of
excited voices and flying feet; and the next instant frightened
Tabitha with her adopted brood in close pursuit, flew into the
kitchen, and gathered up the hurt, sobbing baby in her arms, crooning
tenderly, "There, there, dearie, you mustn't cry any more.  We've
all come back.  We were hunting you.  Where did you go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, see her hands!" cried Irene, shuddering in sympathy.  "She
has burned herself!"</p>

<p>"But the gingerbread isn't burned at all," volunteered Susie
with satisfaction, after a keen and anxious scrutiny of the spicy
loaf half-way out of the oven.</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake!" ejaculated Tabitha, not having noticed
the seared fingers up to that moment, "What do you do for burns?"</p>

<p>"Bring some butter," ordered Gloriana, remembering Granny Conover's
first remedy for burns.</p>

<p>"Mamma uses molasses," said Irene; and Susie and Inez, recovering
their senses at the same instant, dived into the pantry, returning
immediately, one with a crock of butter in her hand, and the other
bearing a bucket of molasses; and before either of the older girls
could intervene, they plunged both of Janie's dirty, scorched
hands first into one dish and then into the other, leaving them
to drip sticky puddles down the front of Tabitha's dress and on
to the clean kitchen floor.</p>

<p>"Why, you little monkeys!" gasped the senior housekeeper, forgetting
the dignity of her position in her wrath at what seemed inexcusable
carelessness on the part of the girls.</p>

<p>"Mamma <em>always</em> puts molasses on burns," quavered Inez,
her lip trembling at Tabitha's tone.</p>

<p>"And Glory said butter," surprised Susie defended.  Then both
culprits dissolved in tears.</p>

<p>"There, there, never mind!" cried Tabitha in dismay.  "I didn't
mean to scold, but you ought to have known more than to stick
the baby's dirty hands into the molasses pail and butter crock."</p>

<p>"Not dirty!" screamed the outraged Janie, striking the face above
her with a dripping fist.  "On'y burned!  Ve pan was&mdash;"  Her sentence
unfinished, she found herself ruthlessly shaken and dumped into
the middle of the floor, while angry Tabitha rushed out of the
door into the cool dusk of early evening, leaving a dismayed family
staring aghast at each other in the hot kitchen.  Even the amazed
baby forgot to voice her protest at such treatment, but stood
where she had landed, staring with round, scared eyes after the
fleeing figure.</p>

<p>Down the mountainside sped Tabitha to the big boulder, wheeled
about and rushed back to the house as swiftly as she had left
it, and before the astounded children had recovered their breath,
she cried, "I am sorry I was cross.  I reckon I'm a little tired
and everything has gone upside down and&mdash;suppose we have supper
now.  I know you are all hungry.  Susie, while I am tying up Janie's
hands, you might put the potatoes on in the frying pan; Irene,
set the table; Inez, fetch the water; and Mercy, cut the bread. 
Is the gingerbread done, Gloriana?"</p>

<p>"Yes," responded the junior housekeeper proudly, "and already
sliced for the table.  Shall I bring in the pie?"</p>

<p>"The pies!" shouted the six McKittricks.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten all about them," confessed the older girl. 
"Yes, you better get them right away.  One will be enough for
supper,&mdash;the tins are so large."</p>

<p>While Tabitha was speaking, Gloriana had stepped briskly out
of the door into the summer night and disappeared around the corner
of the house; but immediately a terrified scream pierced the air,
there was a loud snort and the sound of startled, scampering feet,
and Gloriana burst into the room again bearing an empty plate
in one hand and a dilapidated looking pie, minus all its frosting,
in the other.</p>

<p>"Oh, our lovely pies!" wailed the children in chorus.</p>

<p>"The burros!" gasped Tabitha.</p>

<p>Gloriana nodded.  "One had his nose right in the middle of this
pie. The other beast had upset the second tin and was licking
up the crumbs from the gravel."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I want some pie!" whimpered Rosslyn, puckering his
face to cry.</p>

<p>"Ain't that the worst luck?" Susie burst out.</p>

<p>"If you had put the pies in the <em>window</em> to cool, like
mamma does&mdash;" began Inez.</p>

<p>"It's too late to make any more to-night," Gloriana hastily interrupted,
seeing a wrathful sparkle in Tabitha's black eyes; "but if you
don't make any more fuss about it this time, we'll bake some to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And if you want any supper at all, you'd better come now," advised
Mercedes, from her post by the stove, where she was vigorously
making hash of the sliced potatoes.  "This stuff is beginning
to burn."</p>

<p>Gloriana rescued the frying pan, and the disappointed children
gathered about the table, trying to look cheerful, but failing
dismally.</p>

<p>"Don't want any 'tato," objected Janie, scorning the proffered
dish. "Dingerbread!"</p>

<p>"Potato and beans first," insisted Tabitha.</p>

<p>"Dingerbread!" stubbornly repeated the child, so sleepy and cross
that the weary older girl said no more, but slid a large slice
of the savory cake into the little plate, and proceeded to help
the other children in the same liberal manner.  No one wanted
beans and potato, but at the first mouthful of the tempting-looking
gingerbread, everyone paused, looked inquiringly at her neighbor,
chewed cautiously a time or two, and then eight hands went to
eight pair of lips.</p>

<p>"I thought we stoned raisins for this cake," cried Susie, half
indignantly.</p>

<p>"So you did," replied Gloriana, her face flushed crimson as she
bent over her plate, intently examining her slice of cake.</p>

<p>"Oh, and put the stones in the cake!  What did you do with the
raisins?" demanded Inez.</p>

<p>Before Glory could frame a reply, or offer any excuse for the
accident, Irene slid hurriedly off her chair, flew through the
doorway and down the path toward town, but she was back in a moment,
and in her hand she held a cup of raisins.</p>

<p>"Why, Irene McKittrick!" cried Mercedes, lifting her hands in
horror. "What made you hide them?"</p>

<p>"I didn't hide them," the twin indignantly protested.  "The cup
was in my lap when Rosslyn called that Janie was lost, and I forgot
to put it down when I ran out-doors.  I remembered it by the time
we reached our playhouse, so I set it down there and that's where
I found it now."</p>

<p>"Janie wasn't lost," interrupted that small maiden in drowsy
tones. "Me went to get a letter."</p>

<p>"To get a letter!" chorused her sisters.  "Where?"</p>

<p>"To the store where Mercy goes.  A man dave me one, too," she
finished triumphantly, squirming down from her high chair to search
about the room for the missing epistle, while the rest of the
family forgot both pie and gingerbread in joining in the hunt. 
Rosslyn found it at last under the stove where it had fallen when
Janie began her investigation of the oven; and the girls exclaimed
in genuine surprise, "Why, it <em>is</em> a real letter!"'</p>

<p>"Addressed to mamma," said Mercedes, "Do you suppose Janie really
went to the post-office all alone?"</p>

<p>But Janie was fast asleep in her chair where she had retired
when convinced that Rosslyn had actually found her precious letter;
so the sisters once more bent curious eyes upon the soiled envelope.</p>

<p>"Better re-address it to your mother," suggested Tabitha, remembering
that in her written instructions, Mrs. McKittrick had failed to
mention the matter of mail which might come to Silver Bow for
her.</p>

<p>"Mamma told me to open all her letters, and not even to send
papa's to Los Angeles, unless 'twas something <em>very</em> important."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you open it?" cried Susanne impatiently.</p>

<p>"And see who wrote it," added Inez.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>guess I will."  Deliberately she tore open
the envelope, spread out the brief letter it contained, and with
a comically important air, read the few short lines.  Then beginning
with the heading, she read it the second time, her face growing
graver at each word, until impatient Inez could stand the strain
no longer, and burst out, "Well, what's it all about?  Does it
take you all night to read that teenty letter?"</p>

<p>"It's from Aunt Kate, Uncle Dennis' wife," Mercedes slowly retorted.
"She is going to Europe for something, and wants to send the boys
out here to us."</p>

<p>"Williard and Theodore?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But how can they, with papa hurt and mamma gone?"</p>

<p>"She says that they will pay good board and she knows mamma will
be glad enough to get the money, seeing that papa's still unable
to work."</p>

<p>Tabitha's face darkened.  "It's an imposition!" she exploded
wrathfully.</p>

<p>"I sh'd say so!" agreed Susanne.  "They are dreadful noisy boys. 
We had 'em here once before, and Aunt Kate got awful mad 'cause
papa licked 'em when they touched a match to the old shed to see
how the people on the desert put out fires."</p>

<p>"She said they never should come again," added Inez, "but I guess
she's forgot."</p>

<p>"How old are they?" ventured Gloriana.</p>

<p>"Williard's between me and Susie," Mercedes answered, "and Theodore's
between Susie and the twins."</p>

<p>"Are you going to let them come?" demanded Irene.</p>

<p>Mercedes turned helplessly toward Tabitha.  "What would you do,
Kitty?" she asked.  "Shall I write and ask mamma?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't," Tabitha promptly replied.  "Your mother has her
hands full now, and it would only worry her to know how nervy
your Aunt Kate is.  I'd write her,&mdash;your aunt, I mean,&mdash;and tell
her just how things stand, your father in the hospital and your
mother with him.  She ought to know more than to send them then. 
Still, I believe I'd just say that the boys can't come.  She would
understand that all right.  And I'll be responsible, Mercedes,
if your mother should think we ought to have told her about it
first."</p>

<p>"<em>I'd</em> telegraph, so's to be sure," said Susanne.  "Aunt
Kate doesn't think much about other folks' wishes, and if she
wanted to go to Europe bad enough, she'd ship the boys to us if
we all had smallpox."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea," Tabitha acknowledged.  "We'll telegraph
at once, and then she will have no excuse for not knowing how
sick your father is.  Where is there a pencil and paper?  I'll
write out a telegram now, and we'll slip down town, and send it
to-night."</p>

<p>She hastily scribbled the words:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Dennis McKittrick,   Jamaica Plains, Mass.</p>

<p>Don't send boys.  Father in Los Angeles hospital.  Mother with
him.</p>

<p><em>MERCEDES </em>Mc<em>KITTRICK</em>."</p>

<p>Then taking Irene as company, she carried the message to the
telegraph station that same evening, to make sure it reached its
destination in time to prevent the threatened visit from the unwelcome
cousins.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I acted in a high-handed manner," she confessed to Gloriana,
as they were preparing for bed that night, "but I couldn't bear
to think of that selfish old cat&mdash;yes, that's what she is,&mdash;imposing
upon Mrs. McKittrick again.  I remember the boys, though it was
quite a while ago that they were here.  They were only little
shavers then, too.  I never met them, but one doesn't have to
in order to know all they want to know about their antics."</p>

<p>"And judging from our first day's experiences as housekeepers
in this family, we shall have all <em>we</em> want to do, without
two terrors of boys added."</p>

<p>"To-day has been rather hard and disappointing," Tabitha acknowledged
with a gusty sigh.</p>

<p>"But to-morrow will be better," Gloriana comforted her.  "And
it is only for two weeks.  That's one consolation."</p>

<p>"Thank fortune!" Tabitha exclaimed with fervor; and the tired
eyelids closed over the drowsy black eyes and the gray.</p>
