<p>Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay, looking down from the top of a
tall tree, held their breath. Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel and
his cousin, Chatterer the Red Squirrel, looking down from another
tree, held <em>their</em> breath. Unc' Billy Possum, sticking
his head out from a hollow tree, held <em>his</em> breath. Bobby
Coon, looking through a hole in a hollow stump in which he was
hiding, held <em>his</em> breath. Reddy Fox, lying flat down behind
a heap of brush, held <em>his</em> breath. Peter Rabbit, sitting
bolt upright under a thick hemlock branch, with eyes and ears
wide open, held <em>his</em> breath. And all the other little
people who happened to be where they could see did the same thing.</p>

<p>You see, it was the most exciting moment ever was in the Green
Forest. Farmer Brown's boy had just stepped out from behind one
side of a little hemlock-tree and Buster Bear had just stepped
out from behind the opposite side of the little hemlock-tree and
neither had known that the other was anywhere near. For a whole
minute they stood there face to face, gazing into each other's
eyes, while everybody watched and waited, and it seemed as if
the whole Green Forest was holding its breath.</p>

<p>Then something happened. Yes, Sir, something happened. Farmer
Brown's boy opened his mouth and yelled! It was such a sudden
yell and such a loud yell that it startled Chatterer so that he
nearly fell from his place in the tree, and it made Reddy Fox
jump to his feet ready to run. And that yell was a yell of fright.
There was no doubt about it, for with the yell Farmer Brown's
boy turned and ran for home, as no one ever had seen him run before.
He ran just as Peter Rabbit runs when he has got to reach the
dear Old Briar-patch before Reddy Fox can catch him, which, you
know, is as fast as he can run. Once he stumbled and fell, but
he scrambled to his feet in a twinkling, and away he went without
once turning his head to see if Buster Bear was after him. There
wasn't any doubt that he was afraid, very much afraid.</p>

<p>Everybody leaned forward to watch him. "What did I tell you?
Didn't I say that he was afraid of Buster Bear?" cried Little
Joe Otter, dancing about with excitement.</p>

<p>"You were right, Little Joe! I'm sorry that I doubted it. See
him go! Caw, caw, caw!" shrieked Blacky the Crow.</p>

<p>For a minute or two everybody forgot about Buster Bear. Then
there was a great crash which made everybody turn to look the
other way. What do you think they saw? Why, Buster Bear was running
away too, and he was running twice as fast as Farmer Brown's boy!
He bumped into trees and crashed through bushes and jumped over
logs, and in almost no time at all he was out of sight. Altogether
it was the most surprising thing that the little people of the
Green Forest ever had seen.</p>

<p>Sammy Jay looked at Blacky the Crow, and Blacky looked at Chatterer,
and Chatterer looked at Happy Jack, and Happy Jack looked at Peter
Rabbit, and Peter looked at Unc' Billy Possum, and Unc' Billy
looked at Bobby Coon, and Bobby looked at Johnny Chuck, and Johnny
looked at Reddy Fox, and Reddy looked at Jimmy Skunk, and Jimmy
looked at Billy Mink, and Billy looked at Little Joe Otter, and
for a minute nobody could say a word. Then Little Joe gave a funny
little gasp.</p>

<p>"Why, why-e-e!" said he, "I believe Buster Bear is afraid too!"
Unc' Billy Possum chuckled. "Ah believe yo' are right again, Brer
Otter," said he. "It cert'nly does look so. If Brer Bear isn't
scared, he must have remembered something impo'tant and has gone
to attend to it in a powerful hurry."</p>

<p>Then everybody began to laugh.</p>
