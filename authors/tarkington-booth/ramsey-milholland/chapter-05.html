<p>With Wesley Bender, Ramsey was again upon fair terms before the
winter had run its course; the two were neighbours and, moreover,
were drawn together by a community of interests which made their
reconciliation a necessity. Ramsey played the guitar and Wesley
played the mandolin.</p>

<p>All ill feeling between them died with the first duet of spring,
yet the twinkling they made had no charm to soothe the savage
breast of Ramsey whenever the Teacher's Pet came into his thoughts.
He daydreamed a thousand ways of putting her in her place, but
was unable to carry out any of them, and had but a cobwebby satisfaction
in imagining discomfitures for her which remained imaginary. With
a yearning so poignant that it hurt, he yearned and yearned to
show her what she really was. "Just once!" he said to Fred Mitchell.
"That's all I ask, just once. Just gimme one chance to show that
girl what she really is. I guess if I ever get the chance she'll
find out what's the matter with her, for <em>once</em> in her
life, anyway!" Thus it came to be talked about and understood
and expected in Ramsey's circle, all male, that Dora Yocum's day
was coming. The nature of the disaster was left vague, but there
was no doubt in the world that retribution merely awaited its
ideal opportunity. "You'll see!" said Ramsey. "The time'll come
when that ole girl'll wish she'd moved o' this town before she
ever got appointed monitor of <em>our</em> class! Just you wait!"</p>

<p>They waited, but conditions appeared to remain unfavourable indefinitely.
Perhaps the great opportunity might have arrived if Ramsey had
been able to achieve a startling importance in any of the "various
divergent yet parallel lines of school endeavour"&mdash;one of the
phrases by means of which teachers and principal clogged the minds
of their unarmed auditors. But though he was far from being the
dumb driven beast of misfortune that he seemed in the schoolroom,
and, in fact, lived a double life, exhibiting in his out-of-school
hours a remarkable example of "secondary personality"&mdash;a creature
fearing nothing and capable of laughter; blue-eyed, fairly robust,
and anything but dumb&mdash;he was nevertheless without endowment or
attainment great enough to get him distinction.</p>

<p>He "tried for" the high-school eleven, and "tried for" the nine,
but the experts were not long in eliminating him from either of
these competitions, and he had to content himself with cheering
instead of getting cheered. He was by no manner of means athlete
enough, or enough of anything else, to put Dora Yocum in her place,
and so he and the great opportunity were still waiting in May,
at the end of the second year of high school, when the class,
now the "10 A," reverted to an old fashion and decided to entertain
itself with a woodland picnic.</p>

<p>They gathered upon the sandy banks of a creek, in the blue shade
of big, patchy-barked sycamores, with a dancing sky on top of
everything and gold dust atwinkle over the water. Hither the napkin-covered
baskets were brought from the wagons and assembled in the shade,
where they appeared as an attractive little meadow of white napery,
and gave both surprise and pleasure to communities of ants and
to other original settlers of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>From this nucleus or headquarters of the picnic, various expeditions
set forth up and down the creek and through the woods that bordered
it. Camera work was constant; spring wild flowers were accumulated
by groups of girls who trooped through the woods with eager eyes
searching the thickets; two envied boy fishermen established themselves
upon a bank up-stream, with hooks and lines thoughtfully brought
with them, and poles which they fashioned from young saplings.
They took mussels from the shallows, for bait, and having gone
to all this trouble, declined to share with friends less energetic
and provident the perquisites and pleasures secured to themselves.</p>

<p>Albert Paxton was another person who proved his enterprise. Having
visited the spot some days before, he had hired for his exclusive
use throughout the duration of the picnic an old rowboat belonging
to a shanty squatter; it was the only rowboat within a mile or
two and Albert had his own uses for it. Albert was the class lover
and, after first taking the three chaperon teachers "out for a
row," an excursion concluded in about ten minutes, he disembarked
them; Sadie Clews stepped into the boat, a pocket camera in one
hand, a tennis racket in the other; and the two spent the rest
of the day, except for the luncheon interval, solemnly drifting
along the banks or grounded on a shoal. Now and then Albert would
row a few strokes, and at almost any time when the populated shore
glanced toward them, Sadie would be seen photographing Albert,
or Albert would be seen photographing Sadie, but the tennis racket
remained an enigma. Oarsman and passenger appeared to have no
conversation whatever&mdash;not once was either seen or heard to address
a remark to the other; and they looked as placid as their own
upside-down reflections in one of the still pools they slowly
floated over. They were sixteen, and had been "engaged" more than
two years.</p>

<p>On the borders of the little meadow of baskets there had been
deposited two black shapes, which remained undisturbed throughout
the day, a closed guitar case and a closed mandolin case, no doubt
containing each its proper instrument. So far as any use of these
went they seemed to be of the same leisure class to which Sadie's
tennis racket belonged, for when one of the teachers suggested
music, the musicians proved shy. Wesley Bender said they hadn't
learned to play anything much and, besides, he had a couple o'
broken strings he didn't know as he could fix up; and Ramsey said
he guessed it seemed kind o' too hot to play much. Joining friends,
they organized a contest in marksmanship, the target being a floating
can which they assailed with pebbles; and after that they "skipped"
flat stones upon the surface of the water, then went to join a
group gathered about Willis Parker and Heinie Krusemeyer.</p>

<p>No fish had been caught, a lack of luck crossly attributed by
the fishermen to the noise made by constant advice on the part
of their attendant gallery. Messrs. Milholland, Bender, and the
other rock throwers came up shouting, and were ill received.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sakes," Heinie Krusemeyer demanded, "can't you
shut up? Here we just first got the girls to keep their mouths
shut a minute and I almost had a big pickerel or something on
my hook, and here you got to up and yell so he chases himself
away! Why can't nobody show a little sense sometimes when they
ought to?"</p>

<p>"I should say so!" his comrade exclaimed. "If people would only
just take and think of all the trouble we been to, it seems funny
somebody couldn't let us have half a chance to get a few good
fish. What chance they got to bite with a lot o' <em>girls</em>
gabbin' away, and then, just as we get 'em quieted down, all you
men got to come bustin' up here yellin' your heads off. A fish
isn't goin' to bite when he can't even hear himself think! Anybody
ought to know that much."</p>

<p>But the new arrivals hooted. <em>"Fish!"</em> Ramsey vociferated.
"I'll bet a hundred dollars there hasn't been even a minny in
this creek for the last sixty years!"</p>

<p>"There is, too!" said Heinie, bitterly. "But I wouldn't be surprised
there wouldn't be no longer if you got to keep up this noise.
If you'd shut up just a minute you could see yourself there's
fish here."</p>

<p>In whispers several of the tamed girls at once heartily corroborated
this statement, whereupon the newcomers ceased to gibe and consented
to silence. Ramsey leaned forth over the edge of the overhanging
bank, a dirt precipice five feet above the water, and peered into
the indeterminable depths below. The pool had been stirred, partly
by the inexpert pokings of the fishermen and partly by small clods
and bits of dirt dislodged from above by the feet of the audience.
The water, consequently, was but brownly translucent and revealed
its secrets reluctantly; nevertheless certain dim little shapes
had been observed to move within it, and were still there. Ramsey
failed to see them at first.</p>

<p>"Where's any ole fish?" he inquired, scornfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, my goodness!" Heinie Krusemeyer moaned. "<em>Can't</em>
you shut up?"</p>

<p>"Look!" whispered the girl who stood nearest to Ramsey. She pointed.
"There's one. Right down there by Willis's hook. Don't you see
him?"</p>

<p>Ramsey was impressed enough to whisper. "Is there? I don't see
him. I can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl came closer to him, and, the better to show him, leaned
out over the edge of the bank, and, for safety in maintaining
her balance, rested her left hand upon his shoulder while she
pointed with her right. Thereupon something happened to Ramsey.
The touch upon his shoulder was almost nothing, and he had never
taken the slightest interest in Milla Rust (to whom that small
warm hand belonged), though she was the class beauty, and long
established in the office. Now, all at once, a peculiar and heretofore
entirely unfamiliar sensation suddenly became important in the
upper part of his chest. For a moment he held his breath, an involuntary
action;&mdash;he seemed to be standing in a shower of flowers.</p>

<p>"Don't you see it, Ramsey?" Milla whispered. "It's a great big
one. Why, it must be as long as&mdash;as your shoe! Look!"</p>

<p>Ramsey saw nothing but the thick round curl on Milla's shoulder.
Milla had a group of curls on each of her shoulders, for she got
her modes at the Movies and had that sort of prettiness: large,
gentle, calculating eyes, and a full, softly modelled face, implacably
sweet. Ramsey was accustomed to all this charm, and Milla had
never before been of more importance to him than an equal weight
of school furniture&mdash;but all at once some magic had enveloped
her. That curl upon the shoulder nearest him was shot with dazzling
fibres of sunshine. He seemed to be trembling.</p>

<p>"I don't see it," he murmured, huskily, afraid that she might
remove her hand. "I can't see any fish, Milla."</p>

<p>She leaned farther out over the bank. "Why, there, goosie!" she
whispered. "Right there."</p>

<p>"I can't see it."</p>

<p>She leaned still farther, bending down to point. "Why right th&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment she removed her hand from his shoulder, though
unwillingly. She clutched at him, in fact, but without avail.
She had been too amiable.</p>

<p>A loud shriek was uttered by throats abler to vocalize, just
then, than Milla's, for in her great surprise she said nothing
whatever&mdash;the shriek came from the other girls as Milla left the
crest of the overhanging bank and almost horizontally disappeared
into the brown water. There was a tumultuous splash, and then
of Milla Rust and her well-known beautifulness there was nothing
visible in the superficial world, nor upon the surface of that
creek. The vanishment was total.</p>

<p>"<em>Save</em> her!"</p>

<p>Several girls afterward admitted having used this expression,
and little Miss Floy Williams, the youngest and smallest member
of the class, was unable to deny that she had said, "Oh, God!"
Nothing could have been more natural, and the matter need not
have been brought before her with such insistence and frequency,
during the two remaining years of her undergraduate career.</p>

<p>Ramsey was one of those who heard this exclamation, later so
famous, and perhaps it was what roused him to heroism. He dived
from the bank, headlong, and the strange thought in his mind was
"I guess <em>this</em>'ll show Dora Yocum!" He should have been
thinking of Milla, of course, at such a time, particularly after
the little enchantment just laid upon him by Milla's touch and
Milla's curls; and he knew well enough that Miss Yocum was not
among the spectators. She was half a mile away, as it happened,
gathering "botanical specimens" with one of the teachers&mdash;which
was her idea of what to do at a picnic!</p>

<p>Ramsey struck the water hard, and in the same instant struck
something harder. Wesley Bender's bundle of books had given him
no such shock as he received now, and if the creek bottom had
not been of mud, just there, the top of his young head might have
declined the strain. Half stunned, choking, spluttering he somehow
floundered to his feet; and when he could get his eyes a little
cleared of water he found himself wavering face to face with a
blurred vision of Milla Rust. She had risen up out of the pond
and stood knee deep, like a lovely drenched figure in a fountain.</p>

<p>Upon the bank above them, Willis Parker was jumping up and down,
gesticulating and shouting fiercely. "Now I guess you're satisfied
our fishin' <em>is</em> spoilt! Whyn't you listen me? I <em>told</em>
you it wasn't more'n three feet deep! I and Heinie waded all over
this creek gettin' our bait. You're a pretty sight!"</p>

<p>Of Milla he spoke unwittingly the literal truth. Even with her
hair thus wild and sodden, Milla rose from immersion blushing
and prettier than ever; and she was prettiest of all when she
stretched out her hand helplessly to Ramsey and he led her up
out of the waters. They had plenty of assistance to scramble to
the top of the bank, and there Milla was surrounded and borne
away with a great clacketing and tumult. Ramsey gave his coat
into the hands of friends, who twisted the water out of it for
him, while he sat upon the grass in the sun, rubbed his head,
and experimented with his neck to see if it would "work." The
sunshine was strong and hot; in half an hour he and his clothes
were dry&mdash;or at least "dry enough," as he said, and except for
some soreness of head and neck, and the general crumpledness of
his apparel, he seemed to be in all ways much as usual when shouts
and whistlings summoned all the party to luncheon at the rendezvous.
The change that made him different was invisible.</p>
