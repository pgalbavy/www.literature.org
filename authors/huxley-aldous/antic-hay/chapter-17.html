<p>The two o’clock snorted out of Charing Cross, but no healths
were drunk, this time, to Viscount Lascelles. A desiccating sobriety
made arid the corner of the third-class carriage in which Gumbril
was sitting. His thoughts were an interminable desert of sand,
with not a palm in sight, not so much as a comforting mirage.
Once again he fumbled in his breast-pocket, brought out and unfolded
the flimsy paper. Once more he read. How many times had he read
before?</p>

<p>  "Your telegram made me very unhappy. Not merely because of
the   accident—though it made me shudder to think that something
terrible   might have happened, poor darling—but also, selfishly,
my own   disappointment. I had looked forward so much. I had made
a picture   of it all so clearly. I should have met you at the
station with the   horse and trap from the Chequers, and we’d
have driven back to the   cottage—and you’d have loved the cottage.
We’d have had tea and I’d   have made you eat an egg with it after
your journey. Then we’d have   gone for a walk; through the most
heavenly wood I found yesterday to   a place where there’s a wonderful
view—miles and miles of it. And   we’d have wandered on and on,
and sat down under the trees, and the   sun would have set, and
the twilight would slowly have come to an   end, and we’d have
gone home again and found the lamps lighted and   supper ready—not
very grand, I’m afraid, for Mrs. Vole isn’t the   best of cooks.
And then the piano; for there is a piano, and I had   the tuner
come specially from Hastings yesterday, so that it isn’t   <em>so</em>
bad now. And you’d have played; and perhaps I would have made  
my noises on it. And at last it would have been time for candles
and   bed. When I heard you were coming, Theodore, I told Mrs.
Vole a lie   about you. I said you were my husband, because she’s
fearfully   respectable, of course; and it would dreadfully disturb
her if you   weren’t. But I told myself that, too. I meant that
you should be.   You see, I tell you everything. I’m not ashamed.
I wanted to give   you everything I could, and then we should
always be together,   loving one another. And I should have been
your slave, I should have   been your property and lived inside
your life. But you would always   have had to love me.</p>

<p>  "And then, just as I was getting ready to go and call at the  
Chequers for the horse and trap, your telegram came. I saw the
word   ‘accident,’ and I imagined you all bleeding and smashed—oh,  
dreadful, dreadful. But then, when you seemed to make rather a
joke   of it—why did you say ‘a little indisposed?’ that seemed,
somehow,   so stupid, I thought—and said you were coming to-morrow,
it wasn’t   that which upset me; it was the dreadful, dreadful
disappointment.   It was like a stab, that disappointment; it
hurt so terribly, so   unreasonably much. It made me cry and cry,
so that I thought I   should never be able to stop. And then,
gradually, I began to see   that the pain of the disappointment
wasn’t unreasonably great. It   wasn’t merely a question of your
coming being put off for a day; it   was a question of its being
put off for ever, of my never seeing you   again. I saw that that
accident had been something really arranged   by Providence. It
was meant to warn me and show me what I ought to   do. I saw how
hopelessly impracticable the happiness I had been   imagining
really was. I saw that you didn’t, you couldn’t love me in   anything
like the same way as I loved you. I was only a curious   adventure,
a new experience, a means to some other end. Mind, I’m   not blaming
you in the least. I’m only telling you what is true,   what I
gradually came to realize as true. If you’d come—what then?  
I’d have given you everything, my body, my mind, my soul, my whole  
life. I’d have twisted myself into the threads of your life. And  
then, when in due course you wanted to make an end to this curious  
little adventure, you would have had to cut the tangle and it
would   have killed me; it would also have hurt you. At least
I think it   would. In the end, I thanked God for the accident
which had   prevented you coming. In this way, Providence lets
us off very   lightly—you with a bruise or two (for I do hope
it really is   nothing, my precious darling), and me with a bruise
inside, round   the heart. But both will get well quite soon.
And all our lives, we   shall have an afternoon under the trees,
an evening of music and in   the darkness, a night, an eternity
of happiness, to look back on. I   shall go away from Robertsbridge
at once. Good-bye, Theodore. What a   long letter! The last you’ll
ever get from me. The last—what a   dreadful hurting word that
is. I shall take it to post at once, for   fear, if I leave it,
I may be weak enough to change my mind and let   you come to-morrow.
I shall take it at once, then I shall come home   again and pack
up and tell some new fib to Mrs. Vole. And after   that, perhaps
I shall allow myself to cry again. Good-bye."</p>

<p>Aridly, the desert of sand stretched out with not a tree and
not even a mirage, except perhaps the vague and desperate hope
that he might get there before she started, that she might conceivably
have changed her mind. Ah, if only he’d read the letter a little
earlier! But he hadn’t woken up before eleven, he hadn’t been
down before half-past. Sitting at the breakfast-table, he had
read the letter through.</p>

<p>The eggs and bacon had grown still colder, if that was possible,
than they were. He had read it through, he had rushed to the <em>A.B.C.
</em>There was no practicable train before the two o’clock.</p>

<p>If he had taken the seven-twenty-seven he would certainly have
got there before she started. Ah, if only he had woken up a little
earlier! But then he would have had to go to bed a little earlier.
And in order to go to bed earlier, he would have had to abandon
Mrs. Viveash before she had bored herself to that ultimate point
of fatigue at which she did at last feel ready for repose. And
to abandon Mrs. Viveash—ah, that was really impossible, she wouldn’t
allow herself to be left alone. If only he hadn’t gone to the
London Library yesterday! A wanton, unnecessary visit it had been.
For after all, the journey was short; he didn’t need a book for
the train. And the <em>Life of Beckford</em>, for which he had
asked, proved, of course, to be out—and he had been utterly incapable
of thinking of any other book, among the two or three hundred
thousand on the shelves, that he wanted to read. And, in any case,
what the devil did he want with a <em>Life of Beckford</em>? Hadn’t
he his own life, the life of Gumbril, to attend to? Wasn’t one
life enough, without making superfluous visits to the London Library
in search of other lives? And then what a stroke of bad luck to
have run into Mrs. Viveash at that very moment! What an abject
weakness to have let himself be bullied into sending that telegram.
"A little indisposed...." Oh, my God! Gumbril shut his eyes and
ground his teeth together; he felt himself blushing with a retrospective
shame.</p>

<p>And of course it was quite useless taking the train, like this,
to Robertsbridge. She’d be gone, of course. Still, there was always
the desperate hope. There was the mirage across the desiccated
plains, the mirage one knew to be deceptive and which, on a second
glance, proved not even to be a mirage, but merely a few livery
spots behind the eyes. Still, it was amply worth doing—as a penance,
and to satisfy the conscience and to deceive oneself with an illusion
of action. And then the fact that he was to have spent the afternoon
with Rosie and had put her off—that too was highly satisfying.
And not merely put her off, but—ultimate clownery in the worst
of deliriously bad taste—played a joke on her. "Impossible come
to you, meet me 213 Sloane Street, second floor, a little indisposed."
He wondered how she’d get on with Mr. Mercaptan; for it was to
his rococo boudoir and Crébillon-souled sofa that he had on the
spur of the clownish moment, as he dashed into the post office
on the way to the station, sent her.</p>

<p>Aridly, the desiccated waste extended. Had she been right in
her letter? Would it really have lasted no more than a little
while, and ended as she prophesied, with an agonizing cutting
of the tangle? Or could it be that she had held out the one hope
of happiness? Wasn’t she perhaps the one unique being with whom
he might have learned to await in quietness the final coming of
that lovely terrible thing, from before the sound of whose secret
footsteps more than once and oh! ignobly he had fled? He could
not decide, it was impossible to decide until he had seen her
again, till he had possessed her, mingled his life with hers.
And now she had eluded him; for he knew very well that he would
not find her. He sighed and looked out of the window.</p>

<p>The train pulled up at a small suburban station. Suburban, for
though London was already some way behind, the little sham half-timbered
houses near the station, the newer tile and rough-cast dwellings
farther out on the slope of the hill proclaimed with emphasis
the presence of the business man, the holder of the season ticket.
Gumbril looked at them with a pensive disgust which must have
expressed itself on his features; for the gentleman sitting in
the corner of the carriage facing his, suddenly leaned forward,
tapped him on the knee, and said, "I see you agree with me, sir,
that there are too many people in the world."</p>

<p>Gumbril, who up till now had merely been aware that somebody
was sitting opposite him, now looked with more attention at the
stranger. He was a large, square old gentleman of robust and flourishing
appearance, with a face of wrinkled brown parchment and a white
moustache that merged, in a handsome curve, with a pair of side
whiskers, in a manner which reminded one of the photographs of
the Emperor Francis Joseph.</p>

<p>"I perfectly agree with you, sir," Gumbril answered. If he had
been wearing his beard, he would have gone on to suggest that
loquacious old gentlemen in trains are among the supernumeraries
of the planet. As it was, however he spoke with courtesy, and
smiled in his most engaging fashion.</p>

<p>"When I look at all these revolting houses," the old gentleman
continued, shaking his fist at the snuggeries of the season-ticket
holders, "I am filled with indignation. I feel my spleen ready
to burst, sir, ready to burst."</p>

<p>"I can sympathize with you," said Gumbril. "The architecture
is certainly not very soothing."</p>

<p>"It’s not the architecture I mind so much," retorted the old
gentleman, "that’s merely a question of art, and all nonsense
so far as I’m concerned. What disgusts me is the people inside
the architecture, the number of them, sir. And the way they breed.
Like maggots, sir, like maggots. Millions of them, creeping about
the face of the country, spreading blight and dirt wherever they
go; ruining everything. It’s the people I object to."</p>

<p>"Ah well," said Gumbril, "if you will have sanitary conditions
that don’t allow plagues to flourish properly; if you will tell
mothers how to bring up their children, instead of allowing nature
to kill them off in her natural way; if you will import unlimited
supplies of corn and meat: what can you expect? Of course the
numbers go up."</p>

<p>The old gentleman waved all this away. "I don’t care what the
causes are," he said. "That’s all one to me. What I do object
to, sir, is the effects. Why sir, I am old enough to remember
walking through the delicious meadows beyond Swiss Cottage, I
remember seeing the cows milked in West Hampstead, sir. And now,
what do I see now, when I go there? Hideous red cities pullulating
with Jews, sir. Pullulating with prosperous Jews. Am I right in
being indignant, sir? Do I do well, like the prophet Jonah, to
be angry?"</p>

<p>"You do, sir," said Gumbril, with growing enthusiasm, "and the
more so since this frightful increase in population is the world’s
most formidable danger at the present time. With populations that
in Europe alone expand by millions every year, no political foresight
is possible. A few years of this mere bestial propagation will
suffice to make nonsense of the wisest schemes of to-day—or would
suffice," he hastened to correct himself, "if any wise schemes
were being matured at the present."</p>

<p>"Very possibly, sir," said the old gentleman, "but what I object
to is seeing good cornland being turned into streets, and meadows,
where cows used to graze, covered with houses full of useless
and disgusting human beings. I resent seeing the country parcelled
out into back gardens."</p>

<p>"And is there any prospect," Gumbril earnestly asked, "of our
ever being able in the future to support the whole of our population?
Will unemployment ever decrease?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know, sir," the old gentleman replied. "But the families
of the unemployed will certainly increase."</p>

<p>"You are right, sir," said Gumbril, "they will. And the families
of the employed and the prosperous will as steadily grow smaller.
It is regrettable that birth control should have begun at the
wrong end of the scale. There seems to be a level of poverty below
which it doesn’t seem worth while practising birth control, and
a level of education below which birth control is regarded as
morally wrong. Strange, how long it has taken for the ideas of
love and procreation to dissociate themselves in the human mind.
In the majority of minds they are still, even in this so-called
twentieth century, indivisibly wedded. Still," he continued hopefully,
"progress is being made, progress is certainly, though slowly,
being made. It is gratifying to find, for example, in the latest
statistics, that the clergy, as a class, are now remarkable for
the smallness of their families. The old jest is out of date.
Is it too much to hope that these gentlemen may bring themselves
in time to preach what they already practise?"</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> too much to hope, sir," the old gentleman answered
with decision.</p>

<p>"You are probably right," said Gumbril.</p>

<p>"If we were all to preach all the things we all practise," continued
the old gentleman, "the world would soon be a pretty sort of bear-garden,
I can tell you. Yes, and a monkey-house. And a wart-hoggery. As
it is, sir, it is merely a place where there are too many human
beings. Vice must pay its tribute to virtue, or else we are all
undone."</p>

<p>"I admire your wisdom, sir," said Gumbril.</p>

<p>The old gentleman was delighted. "And I have been much impressed
by your philosophical reflections," he said. "Tell me, are you
at all interested in old brandy?"</p>

<p>"Well, not philosophically," said Gumbril. "As a mere empiric
only."</p>

<p>"As a mere empiric!" The old gentleman laughed. "Then let me
beg you to accept a case. I have a cellar which I shall never
drink dry, alas! before I die. My only wish is that what remains
of it shall be distributed among those who can really appreciate
it. In you, sir, I see a fitting recipient of a case of brandy."</p>

<p>"You overwhelm me," said Gumbril. "You are too kind, and, I may
add, too flattering." The train, which was a mortally slow one,
came grinding for what seemed the hundredth time to a halt.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said the old gentleman. "If you have a card, sir."</p>

<p>Gumbril searched his pockets. "I have come without one."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the old gentleman. "I think I have a pencil.
If you will give me your name and address, I will have the case
sent to you at once."</p>

<p>Leisurely, he hunted for the pencil, he took out a notebook.
The train gave a jerk forward.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," he said.</p>

<p>Gumbril began dictating. "Theodore," he said slowly.</p>

<p>"The—o—dore," the old gentleman repeated, syllable by syllable.</p>

<p>The train crept on, with slowly gathering momentum, through the
station. Happening to look out of the window at this moment, Gumbril
saw the name of the place painted across a lamp. It was Robertsbridge.
He made a loud, inarticulate noise, flung open the door of the
compartment, stepped out on to the footboard and jumped. He landed
safely on the platform, staggered forward a few paces with his
acquired momentum and came at last to a halt. A hand reached out
and closed the swinging door of his compartment and, an instant
afterwards, through the window, a face that, at a distance, looked
more than ever like the face of the Emperor Francis Joseph, looked
back towards the receding platform. The mouth opened and shut;
no words were audible. Standing on the platform, Gumbril made
a complicated pantomime, signifying his regret by shrugging his
shoulders and placing his hand on his heart; urging in excuse
for his abrupt departure the necessity under which he laboured
of alighting at this particular station—which he did by pointing
at the name on the boards and lamps, then at himself, then at
the village across the fields. The old gentleman waved his hand,
which still held, Gumbril noticed, the notebook in which he had
been writing. Then the train carried him out of sight. There went
the only case of old brandy he was ever likely to possess, thought
Gumbril sadly, as he turned away. Suddenly, he remembered Emily
again; for a long time he had quite forgotten her.</p>

<p>The cottage, when at last he found it, proved to be fully as
picturesque as he had imagined. And Emily, of course, had gone,
leaving, as might have been expected, no address. He took the
evening train back to London. The aridity was now complete, and
even the hope of a mirage had vanished. There was no old gentleman
to make a diversion. The size of clergymen’s families, even the
fate of Europe, seemed unimportant now, were indeed perfectly
indifferent to him. </p>
