<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was the sultriest of weather in London&mdash;days when the city
lay in a fog of heat, when the paving cracked, and the brow was
damp from the slightest movement and the mind of the stranger
was tortured by the thought of airy downs and running rivers.
The leaves in the Green Park were withered and dusty, the window-boxes
in Mayfair had a tarnished look, and horse and man moved with
unwilling languor. A tall young man in a grey frockcoat searched
the street for shadow, and finding none entered the doorway of
a club which promised coolness.</p>

<p>Mr. George Winterham removed his top-hat, had a good wash, and
then sought the smoking room. Seen to better advantage, he was
sufficiently good-looking, with an elegant if somewhat lanky frame,
a cheerful countenance, and a great brown moustache which gave
him the air military. But he was no soldier, being indeed that
anomalous creature, the titular barrister, who shows his profession
by rarely entering the chambers and by an ignorance of law more
profound than Necessity's.</p>

<p>He found the shadiest corner of the smoking room and ordered
the coolest drink he could think of. Then he smiled, for he saw
advancing to him across the room another victim of the weather.
This was a small, thin man, with a finely-shaped dark head and
the most perfectly-fitting clothes. He had been deep in a review,
but at the sight of the wearied giant in the corner he had forgotten
his interest in the "Entomology of the Riviera." He looked something
of the artist or the man of letters, but in truth he had no taint
of Bohemianism about him, being a very respectable person and
a rising politician. His name was Arthur Mordaunt, but because
it was the fashion at the time for a certain class of people to
address each other in monosyllables, his friends invariably knew
him as "John."</p>

<p>He dropped into a chair and regarded his companion with half-closed
eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, John. Dished, eh? Most infernal heat I ever endured! I
can't stand it, you know. I'll have to go away."</p>

<p>"Think," said the other, "think that at this moment somewhere
in the country there are great, cool, deep woods and lakes and
waterfalls, and we might be sitting in flannels instead of being
clothed in these garments of sin."</p>

<p>"Think," said George, "of nothing of the kind. Think of high
upland glens and full brown rivers, and hillsides where there
is always wind. Why do I tantalize myself and talk to a vexatious
idiot like you?"</p>

<p>This young man had a deep voice, a most emphatic manner of speech,
and a trick of cheerfully abusing his friends which they rather
liked than otherwise.</p>

<p>"And why should I sit opposite six feet of foolishness which
can give me no comfort? Whew! But I think I am getting cool at
last. I have sworn to make use of my first half-hour of reasonable
temperature and consequent clearness of mind to plan flight from
this place."</p>

<p>"May I come with you, my pretty maid? I am hideously sick of
July in town. I know Mabel will never forgive me, but I must risk
it."</p>

<p>Mabel was the young man's sister, and the friendship between
the two was a perpetual joke. As a small girl she had been wont
to con eagerly her brother's cricketing achievements, for George
had been a famous cricketer, and annually went crazy with excitement
at the Eton and Harrow match. She exercised a maternal care over
him, and he stood in wholesome fear of her and ordered his doings
more or less at her judgment. Now she was married, but she still
supervised her tall brother, and the victim made no secret of
the yoke.</p>

<p>Suddenly Arthur jumped to his feet. "I say, what about Lewis
Haystoun? He is home now, somewhere in Scotland. Have you heard
a word about him?"</p>

<p>"He has never written," groaned George, but he took out a pocket-book
and shook therefrom certain newspaper cuttings. "The people I
employ sent me these about him to-day." And he laid them out on
his knee.</p>

<p>The first of them was long, and consisted of a belated review
of Mr. Haystoun's book. George, who never read such things, handed
it to Arthur, who glanced over the lines and returned it. The
second explained in correct journalese that the Manorwater family
had returned to Glenavelin for the summer and autumn, and that
Mr. Lewis Haystoun was expected at Etterick shortly. The third
recorded the opening of a bazaar in the town of Gledsmuir which
Mr. Haystoun had patronised, "looking," said the fatuous cutting,
"very brown and distinguished after his experiences in the East."&mdash;"Whew!"
said George. "Poor beggar, to have such stuff written about him!"
&mdash;The fourth discussed the possible retirement of Sir Robert
Merkland, the member for Gledsmuir, and his possible successor.
Mr. Haystoun's name was mentioned, "though indeed," said the wiseacre,
"that gentleman has never shown any decided leanings to practical
politics. We understand that the seat will be contested in the
Radical interest by Mr. Albert Stocks, the well-known writer and
lecturer."</p>

<p>"You know everybody, John. Who's the fellow?" George asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, a very able man indeed, one of the best speakers we have.
I should like to see a fight between him and Lewie: they would
not get on with each other. This Stocks is a sort of living embodiment
of the irritable Radical conscience, a very good thing in its
way, but not quite in Lewie's style."</p>

<p>The fifth cutting mentioned the presence of Mr. Haystoun at three
garden-parties, and hinted the possibility of a mistress soon
to be at Etterick.</p>

<p>George lay back in his chair gasping. "I never thought it would
come to this. I always thought Lewie the least impressionable
of men. I wonder what sort of woman he has fallen in love with.
But it may not be true."</p>

<p>"We'll pray that it isn't true. But I was never quite sure of
him. You know there was always an odd romantic strain in the man.
The ordinary smart, pretty girl, who adorns the end of a dinner-table
and makes an admirable mistress of a house, he would never think
twice about. But for all his sanity Lewie has many cranks, and
a woman might get him on that side."</p>

<p>"Don't talk of it. I can picture the horrid reality. He will
marry some thin-lipped creature who will back him in all his madness,
and his friends will have to bid him a reluctant farewell. Or,
worse still, there are scores of gushing, sentimental girls who
might capture him. I wish old Wratislaw were here to ask him what
he thinks, for he knows Lewie better than any of us. Is he a member
here?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, he is a member, but I don't think he comes much. You
people are too frivolous for him."</p>

<p>"Well, that is all the good done by subscribing to a news-cutting
agency for news of one's friends. I feel as low as ditch water.
There is that idiot who goes off to the ends of the earth for
three years, and when he comes back his friends get no good of
him for the confounded women." George echoed the ancient complaint
which is doubtless old as David and Jonathan.</p>

<p>Then these two desolated young men, in view of their friend's
defection, were full of sad memories, much as relations after
a funeral hymn the acts of the deceased.</p>

<p>George lit a cigar and smoked it savagely. "So that is the end
of Lewis! And to think I knew the fool at school and college and
couldn't make a better job of him than this! Do you remember,
John, how we used to call him 'Vaulting Ambition,' because he
won the high jump and was a cocky beggar in general?"</p>

<p>"And do you remember when he got his First, and they wanted him
to stand for a fellowship, but he was keen to get out of England
and travel? Do you remember that last night at Heston, when he
told us all he was going to do, and took a bet with Wratislaw
about it?"</p>

<p>It is probable that this sad elegy would have continued for hours,
had not a servant approached with letters, which he distributed,
two to Arthur Mordaunt and one to Mr. Winterham. A close observer
might have seen that two of the envelopes were identical. Arthur
slipped one into his pocket, but tore open the other and read.</p>

<p>"It's from Lewie," he cried. "He wants me down there next week
at Etterick. He says he is all alone and crazy to see old friends
again."</p>

<p>"Mine's the same!" said George, after puzzling out Mr. Haystoun's
by no means legible writing. "I say, John, of course we'll go.
It's the very chance we were wishing for."</p>

<p>Then he added with a cheerful face, "I begin to think better
of human nature. Here were we abusing the poor man as a defaulter,
and ten minutes after he heaps coals of fire on our heads. There
can't be much truth in what that newspaper says, or he wouldn't
want his friends down to spoil sport."</p>

<p>"I wonder what he'll be like? Wratislaw saw him in town, but
only for a little, and he notices nothing. He's rather famous
now, you know, and we may expect to find him very dignified and
wise. He'll be able to teach us most things, and we'll have to
listen with proper humility."</p>

<p>"I'll give you fifty to one he's nothing of the kind," said George.
"He has his faults like us all, but they don't run in that line.
No, no, Lewie will be modest enough. He may have the pride of
Lucifer at heart, but he would never show it. His fault is just
this infernal modesty, which makes him shirk fighting some blatant
ass or publishing his merits to the world."</p>

<p>Arthur looked curiously at his companion. Mr. Winterham was loved
of his friends as the best of good fellows, but to the staid and
rising politician he was not a person for serious talk. Hence,
when he found him saying very plainly what had for long been a
suspicion of his own, he was willing to credit him with a new
acuteness.</p>

<p>"You know I've always backed Lewie to romp home some day," went
on the young man. "He has got it in him to do most things, if
he doesn't jib and bolt altogether."</p>

<p>"I don't see why you should talk of your friends as if they were
racehorses or prize dogs."</p>

<p>"Well, there's a lot of truth in the metaphor. You know yourself
what a mess of it he might make. Say some good woman got hold
of him&mdash;some good woman, for we will put aside the horrible suggestion
of the adventuress. I suppose he'd be what you call a 'good husband.'
He would become a magistrate and a patron of local agricultural
societies and flower shows. And eveybody would talk about him
as a great success in life; but we&mdash;you and I and Tommy&mdash;who know
him better, would feel that it was all a ghastly failure."</p>

<p>Mr. Lewis Haystoun's character erred in its simplicity, for it
was at the mercy of every friend for comment.</p>

<p>"What makes you dread the women so?" asked Arthur with a smile.</p>

<p>"I don't dread 'em. They are all that's good, and a great deal
better than most men. But then, you know, if you get a man really
first-class he's so much better than all but the very best women
that you've got to look after him. To ordinary beggars like myself
it doesn't matter a straw, but I won't have Lewie throwing himself
away."</p>

<p>"Then is the ancient race of the Haystouns to disappear from
the earth?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there are women fit for him, sure enough, but you won't
find them at every garden party. Why, to find the proper woman
would be the making of the man, and I should never have another
doubt about him. But I am afraid. He's a deal too kindly and good-natured,
and he'd marry a girl to-morrow merely to please her. And then
some day quite casually he would come across the woman who was
meant by Providence for him, and there would be the devil to pay
and the ruin of one good man. I don't mean that he'd make a fool
of himself or anything of that sort, for he's not a cad; but in
the middle of his pleasant domesticity he would get a glimpse
of what he might have been, and those glimpses are not forgotten."</p>

<p>"Why, George, you are getting dithyrambic," said Arthur, still
smiling, but with a new vague respect in his heart.</p>

<p>"For you cannot harness the wind or tie&mdash;tie the bonds of the
wild ass," said George, with an air of quotation. "At any rate,
we're going to look after him. He is a good chap and I've got
to see him through."</p>

<p>For Mr. Winterham, who was very much like other men, whose language
was free, and who respected few things indeed in the world, had
unfailing tenderness for two beings&mdash;his sister and his friend.</p>

<p>The two young men rose, yawned, and strolled out into the hall.
They scanned carelessly the telegram boards. Arthur pointed a
finger to a message typed in a corner.</p>

<p>"That will make a good deal of difference to Wratislaw."</p>

<p>George read: "The death is announced, at his residence in Hampshire,
of Earl Beauregard. His lordship had reached the age of eighty-five,
and had been long in weak health. He is succeeded by his son the
Right Hon. Lord Malham, the present Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs."</p>

<p>"It means that if Wratislaw's party get back with a majority
after August, and if Wratislaw gets the under-secretaryship as
most people expect, then, with his chief in the Lords, he will
be rather an important figure in the Commons."</p>

<p>"And I suppose his work will be pretty lively," said George.
He had been reading some of the other telegrams, which were, as
a rule, hysterical messages by way of foreign capitals, telling
of Russian preparations in the East.</p>

<p>"Oh, lively, yes. But I've confidence in Tommy. I wish the Fate
which decides men's politics had sent him to our side. He knows
more about the thing than any one else, and he knows his own mind,
which is rare enough. But it's too hot for serious talk. I suppose
my seat is safe enough in August, but I don't relish the prospect
of a three weeks' fight. Wratislaw, lucky man, will not be opposed.
I suppose he'll come up and help Lewis to make hay of Stock's
chances. It's a confounded shame. I shall go and talk for him."</p>

<p>On the steps of the club both men halted, and looked up and down
the sultry white street. The bills of the evening papers were
plastered in a row on the pavement, and the glaring pink and green
still further increased the dazzle. After the cool darkness within
each shaded his eyes and blinked.</p>

<p>"This settles it," said George. "I shall wire to Lewie to-night."</p>

<p>"And I," said the other; "and to-morrow evening we'll be in that
cool green Paradise of a glen. Think of it! Meantime I shall grill
through another evening in the House, and pair."</p>
