<P>
But Warming was wrong in that. An awakening
came.
<P>
What a wonderfully complex thing! this simple
seeming unity--the self! Who can trace its 
reintegration as morning after morning we awaken, the
flux and confluence of its countless factors intenveaving, 
rebuilding, the dim first stirrings of the soul, the
growth and synthesis of the unconscious to the 
subconscious, the sub-conscious to dawning consciousness, 
until at last we recognise ourselves again. And
as it happens to most of us after the night's sleep, so
it was with Graham at the end of his vast slumber.
A dim cloud of sensation taking shape, a cloudy 
dreariness, and he found himself vaguely somewhere,
recumbent, faint, but alive.
<P>
The pilgrimage towards a personal being seemed to
traverse vast gulfs, to occupy epochs. Gigantic
dreams that were terrible realities at the time, left
vague perplexing memories, strange creatures, strange
scenery, as if from another planet. There was a distinct 
impression, too, of a momentous conversation, of
a name--he could not tell what name--that was
subsequently to recur, of some queer long-forgotten
sensation of vein and muscle, of a feeling of vast 
hopeless effort, the effort of a man near drowning in 
darkness. Then came a panorama of dazzling unstable
confluent scenes.
<P>
Graham became aware his eyes were open and regarding 
some unfamiliar thing.
<P>
It was something white, the edge of something, a
frame of wood. He moved his head slightly, following 
the contour of this shape. It went up beyond the
top of his eyes. He tried to think where he might be.
Did it matter, seeing he was so wretched? The colour
of his thoughts was a dark depression. He felt the
featureless misery of one who wakes towards the hour
of dawn. He had an uncertain sense of whispers and
footsteps hastily receding.
<P>
The movement of his head involved a perception of
extreme physical weakness. He supposed he was in
bed in the hotel at the place in the valley--but he
could not recall that white edge. He must have slept.
He remembered now that he had wanted to sleep. He
recalled the cliff and waterfall again, and then 
recollected something about talking to a passer-by.
<P>
How long had he slept? What was that sound of
pattering feet? And that rise and fall, like the 
murmur of breakers on pebbles? He put out a languid
hand to reach his watch from the chair whereon it
was his habit to place it, and touched some smooth
hard surface like glass. This was so unexpected that
it startled him extremely. Quite suddenly he rolled
over, stared for a moment, and struggled into a sitting
position. The effort was unexpectedly difficult, and
it left him giddy and weak--and amazed.
<P>
He rubbed his eyes. The riddle of his surroundings
was confusing but his mind was quite clear--evidently 
his sleep had benefited him. He was not in a
bed at all as he understood the word, but Iying naked
on a very soft and yielding mattress, in a trough of
dark glass. The mattress was partly transparent, a
fact he observed with a strange sense of insecurity, and
below it was a mirror reflecting him greyly. About
his arm--and he saw with a shock that his skin was
strangIy dry and yellow--was bound a curious apparatus 
of rubber, bound so cunningly that it seemed
to pass into his skin above and below. And this
strange bed was placed in a case of greenish coloured
glass (as it seemed to him), a bar in the white framework 
of which had first arrested his attention. In
the corner of the case was a stand of glittering and
delicately made apparatus, for the most part quite
strange appliances, though a maximum and minimum
thermometer was recognisable.
<P>
The slightly greenish tint of the glass-like substance
which surrounded him on every hand obscured what
lay behind, but he perceived it was a vast apartment
of splendid appearance, and with a very large and
simple white archway facing him. Close to the walls
of the cage were articles of furniture, a table covered
with a silvery cloth, silvery like the side of a fish, a
couple of graceful chairs, and on the table a number
of dishes with substances piled on them, a bottle and
two glasses. He realised that he was intensely hungry.
<P>
He could see no human being, and after a period
of hesitation scrambled off the translucent mattress
and tried to stand on the clean white floor of his little
apartment. He had miscalculated his strength, however, 
and staggered and put his hand against the glasslike 
pane before him to steady himself. For a moment
it resisted his hand, bending outward like a distended
bladder, then it broke with a slight report and vanished--a
pricked bubble. He reeled out into the
general space of the hall, greatly astonished. He
caught at the table to save himself, knocking one of
the glasses to the floor--it rang but did not break--
and sat down in one of the armchairs.
<P>
When he had a little recovered he filled the remaining 
glass from the bottle and drank--a colourless
liquid it was, but not water, with a pleasing faint
aroma and taste and a quality of immediate support
and stimulus. He put down the vessel and looked
about him.
<P>
The apartment lost none of its size and magnificence
now that the greenish transparency that had intervened 
was removed. The archway he saw led to a
flight of steps, going downward without the
intermediation of a door, to a spacious transverse passage.
This passage ran between polished pillars of some
white-veined substance of deep ultramarine, and along
it came the sound of human movements and voices
and a deep undeviating droning note. He sat, now
fully awake, listening alertly, forgetting the viands in
his attention.
<P>
Then with a shock he remembered that he was
naked, and casting about him for covering, saw a long
black robe thrown on one of the chairs beside him.
This he wrapped about him and sat down again,
trembling.
<P>
His mind was still a surging perplexity. Clearly
he had slept. and had been removed in his sleep. But
here? And who were those people, the distant
crowd beyond the deep blue pillars? Boscastle? He
poured out and partially drank another glass of the
colourless fluid.
<P>
What was this place?--this place that to his senses
seemed subtly quivering like a thing alive? He looked
about him at the clean and beautiful form of the apartment, 
unstained by ornament, and saw that the roof
was broken in one place by a circular shaft full of
light, and, as he looked, a steady, sweeping shadow
blotted it out and passed, and came again and passed.
"Beat, beat," that sweeping shadow had a note of its
own in the subdued tumult that filled the air.
<P>
He would have called out, but only a little sound
came into his throat. Then he stood up, and, with
the uncertain steps of a drunkard, made his way
towards the archway. He staggered down the steps,
tripped on the corner of the black cloak he had
wrapped about himself, and saved himself by catching
at one of the blue pillars.
<P>
The passage ran down a cool vista of blue and purple, 
and ended remotely in a railed space like a balcony, 
brightly lit and projecting into a space of haze,
a space like the interior of some gigantic building.
Beyond and remote were vast and vague architectural
forms. The tumult of voices rose now loud and clear,
and on the balcony and with their backs to him, 
gesticulating and apparently in animated conversation,
were three figures, richly dressed in loose and easy
garments of bright soft colourings. The noise of a
great multitude of people poured up over the balcony,
and once it seemed the top of a banner passed, and
once some brightly coloured object, a pale blue cap
or garment thrown up into the air perhaps, flashed
athwart the space and fell. The shouts sounded like
English, there was a reiteration of "Wake!" He
heard some indistinct shrill cry, and abruptly the
three men began laughing.
<P>
"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed one--a red-haired man in
a short purple robe. "When the Sleeper wakes--
__When!__
<P>
He turned his eyes full of merriment along the passage. 
His face changed, the whole man changed,
became rigid. The other two turned swiftly at his
exclamation and stood motionless. Their faces
assumed an expression of consternation, an expression
that deepened into awe.
<P>
Suddenly Graham's knees bent beneath him, his arm
against the pillar collapsed limply, he staggered 
forward and fell upon his face.
