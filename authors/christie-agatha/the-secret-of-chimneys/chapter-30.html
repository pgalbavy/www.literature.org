<p>"If you will go on, gentlemen, I will follow you in a minute,"
said Anthony.</p>

<p>He waited whilst the others filed out, and then turned to where
Superintendent Battle was standing apparently absorbed in examining
the panelling.</p>

<p>"Well, Battle? Want to ask me something, don’t you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I do, sir, though I don’t know how you knew I did. But
I always marked you out as being specially quick in the uptake.
I take it that the lady who is dead was the late Queen Varaga?"</p>

<p>"Quite right, Battle. It’ll be hushed up, I hope. You can understand
what I feel about family skeletons."</p>

<p>"Trust Mr. Lomax for that, sir. No one will ever know. That is,
a lot of people will know, but it won’t get about."</p>

<p>"Was that what you wanted to ask me about?"</p>

<p>"No, sir—that was only in passing. I was curious to know just
what made you drop your own name—if I’m not taking too much of
a liberty?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. I’ll tell you. I killed myself from the purest motives,
Battle. My mother was English, I’d been educated in England, and
I was far more interested in England than in Herzoslovakia. And
I felt an absolute fool knocking about the world with a comic
opera title tacked on to me. You see, when I was very young, I
had democratic ideas. Believed in the purity of ideals, and the
equality of all men. I especially disbelieved in Kings and Princes."</p>

<p>"And since then?" asked Battle shrewdly.</p>

<p>"Oh, since then, I’ve travelled and seen the world. There’s damned
little equality going about. Mind you, I still believe in democracy.
But you’ve got to force it on people with a strong hand—ram it
down their throats. Men don’t want to be brothers—they may some
day, but they don’t now. My final belief in the Brotherhood of
Man died the day I arrived in London last week, when I observed
the people standing in a Tube train resolutely refuse to move
up and make room for those who entered. You won’t turn people
into angels by appealing to their better natures just yet awhile—but
by judicious force you can coerce them into behaving more or less
decently to one another to go on with. I still believe in the
Brotherhood of Man, but it’s not coming yet awhile. Say another
ten thousand years or so. It’s no good being impatient. Evolution
is a slow process."</p>

<p>"I’m very interested in these views of yours, sir," said Battle
with a twinkle. "And if you’ll allow me to say so, I’m sure you’ll
make a very fine King out there."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Battle," said Anthony with a sigh.</p>

<p>"You don’t seem very happy about it, sir?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don’t know. I dare say it will be rather fun. But it’s
tying oneself down to regular work. I’ve always avoided that before."</p>

<p>"But you consider it your duty, I suppose, sir?"</p>

<p>"Good Lord, no! What an idea. It’s a woman—it’s always a woman,
Battle. I’d do more than be a King for her sake."</p>

<p>"Quite so, sir."</p>

<p>"I’ve arranged it so that the Baron and Isaacstein can’t kick.
The one wants a King and the other wants oil. They’ll both get
what they want, and I’ve got—Oh, Lord, Battle, have you ever been
in love?"</p>

<p>"I am much attached to Mrs. Battle, sir."</p>

<p>"Much attached to Mrs.—Oh, you don’t know what I’m talking about!
It’s entirely different!"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir, that man of yours is waiting outside the window."</p>

<p>"Boris? So he is. He’s a wonderful fellow. It’s a mercy that
pistol went off in the struggle and killed the lady. Otherwise
Boris would have wrung her neck as sure as Fate, and then you
would have wanted to hang him. His attachment to the Obolovitch
dynasty is remarkable. The queer thing was that as soon as Michael
was dead he attached himself to me—and yet he couldn’t possibly
have known who I really was."</p>

<p>"Instinct," said Battle. "Like a dog."</p>

<p>"Very awkward instinct I thought it at the time. I was afraid
it might give the show away to you. I suppose I’d better see what
he wants."</p>

<p>He went out through the window. Superintendent Battle, left alone,
looked after him for a minute, then apparently addressed the panelling.</p>

<p>"He’ll do," said Superintendent Battle.</p>

<p>Outside, Boris explained himself.</p>

<p>"Master," said he, and led the way along the terrace.</p>

<p>Anthony followed him, wondering what was forward.</p>

<p>Presently Boris stopped and pointed with his forefinger. It was
moonlight, and in front of them was a stone seat on which sat
two figures.</p>

<p>"He <em>is</em> a dog," said Anthony to himself. "And what’s
more, a pointer!"</p>

<p>He strode forward. Boris melted into the shadows.</p>

<p>The two figures rose to meet him. One of them was Virginia—the
other——</p>

<p>"Hullo, Joe," said a well remembered voice. "This is a great
girl of yours."</p>

<p>"Jimmy McGrath, by all that’s wonderful," cried Anthony. "How
in the name of fortune did you get here?"</p>

<p>"That trip of mine into the interior went phut. Then some Dagos
came monkeying round. Wanted to buy that manuscript off me. Next
thing I as near as nothing got a knife in the back one night.
That made me think that I’d handed you out a bigger job than I
knew. I thought you might need help, and I came along after you
by the very next boat."</p>

<p>"Wasn’t it splendid of him?" said Virginia. She squeezed Jimmy’s
arm. "Why didn’t you ever tell me how frightfully nice he was?
You are, Jimmy, you’re a perfect dear."</p>

<p>"You two seem to be getting along all right," said Anthony.</p>

<p>"Sure thing," said Jimmy. "I was snooping round for news of you,
when I connected with this dame. She wasn’t at all what I thought
she’d be—some swell haughty Society lady that’d scare the life
out of me."</p>

<p>"He told me all about the letters," said Virginia. "And I feel
almost ashamed not to have been in real trouble over them when
he was such a knight-errant."</p>

<p>"If I’d known what you were like," said Jimmy gallantly, "I’d
not have given him the letters. I’d have brought them to you myself.
Say, young man, is the fun really over? Is there nothing for me
to do?"</p>

<p>"By Jove," said Anthony, "there is! Wait a minute."</p>

<p>He disappeared into the house. In a minute or two he returned
with a paper package which he cast into Jimmy’s arms.</p>

<p>"Go round to the garage and help yourself to a likely looking
car. Beat it to London and deliver that parcel at 17, Everdean
Square. That’s Mr. Balderson’s private address. In exchange he’ll
hand you a thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"What? It’s not the Memoirs? I understood that they’d been burnt."</p>

<p>"What do you take me for?" demanded Anthony. "You don’t think
I’d fall for a story like that, do you? I rang up the publishers
at once, found out that the other was a fake call, and arranged
accordingly. I made up a dummy package as I’d been directed to
do. But I put the real package in the Manager’s safe and handed
over the dummy. The Memoirs have never been out of my possession."</p>

<p>"Bully for you, my son," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Oh, Anthony," cried Virginia. "You’re not going to let them
be published?"</p>

<p>"I can’t help myself. I can’t let a pal like Jimmy down. But
you needn’t worry. I’ve had time to wade through them, and I see
now why people always hint that bigwigs don’t write their own
reminiscences but hire some one to do it for them. As a writer,
Stylptitch is an insufferable bore. He proses on about statecraft,
and doesn’t go in for any racy and indiscreet anecdotes. His ruling
passion of secrecy held strong to the end. There’s not a word
in the Memoirs from beginning to end to flutter the susceptibilities
of the most difficult politician. I rang up Balderson to-day,
and arranged with him that I’d deliver the manuscript to-night
before midnight. But Jimmy can do his own dirty work now that’s
he’s here."</p>

<p>"I’m off," said Jimmy. "I like the idea of that thousand pounds—especially
when I’d made up my mind I was down and out."</p>

<p>"Half a second," said Anthony. "I’ve got a confession to make
to you, Virginia. Something that every one else knows, but that
I haven’t yet told you."</p>

<p>"I don’t mind how many strange women you’ve loved so long as
you don’t tell me about them."</p>

<p>"Women!" said Anthony, with a virtuous air. "Women indeed? You
ask James here what kind of women I was going about with last
time he saw me."</p>

<p>"Frumps," said Jimmy solemnly. "Utter frumps. Not one a day under
forty-five."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jimmy," said Anthony, "you’re a true friend. No,
it’s much worse than that. I’ve deceived you as to my real name."</p>

<p>"Is it very dreadful?" said Virginia, with interest. "It isn’t
something silly like Pobbles, is it? Fancy being called Mrs. Pobbles."</p>

<p>"You are always thinking the worst of me."</p>

<p>"I admit that I did once think you were King Victor, but only
for about a minute and a half."</p>

<p>"By the way, Jimmy, I’ve got a job for you—gold prospecting in
the rocky fastnesses of Herzoslovakia."</p>

<p>"Is there gold there?" asked Jimmy eagerly.</p>

<p>"Sure to be," said Anthony. "It’s a wonderful country."</p>

<p>"So you’re taking my advice and going there?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Anthony. "Your advice was worth more than you knew.
Now for the confession. I wasn’t changed at nurse, or anything
romantic like that, but nevertheless I am really Prince Nicholas
Obolovitch of Herzoslovakia."</p>

<p>"Oh, Anthony," cried Virginia. "How perfectly screaming! And
I have married you! What are we going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"We’ll go to Herzoslovakia and pretend to be Kings and Queens.
Jimmy McGrath once said that the average life of a King or Queen
out there is under four years. I hope you don’t mind?"</p>

<p>"Mind?" cried Virginia. "I shall love it!"</p>

<p>"Isn’t she great?" murmured Jimmy.</p>

<p>Then, discreetly, he faded into the night. A few minutes later
the sound of a car was heard.</p>

<p>"Nothing like letting a man do his own dirty work," said Anthony,
with satisfaction. "Besides, I didn’t know how else to get rid
of him. Since we were married I’ve not had one minute alone with
you."</p>

<p>"We’ll have a lot of fun," said Virginia. "Teaching the brigands
not to be brigands, and the assassins not to assassinate, and
generally improving the moral tone of the country."</p>

<p>"I like to hear these pure ideals," said Anthony. "It makes me
feel my sacrifice has not been in vain."</p>

<p>"Rot," said Virginia calmly, "you’ll enjoy being a King. It’s
in your blood, you know. You were brought up to the trade of Royalty,
and you’ve got a natural aptitude for it, just like plumbers have
a natural bent for plumbing."</p>

<p>"I never think they have," said Anthony. "But damn it all, don’t
let’s waste time talking about plumbers. Do you know that at this
very minute I’m supposed to be deep in conference with Isaacstein
and old Lollipop? They want to talk about oil. Oil, my God! They
can just await my kingly pleasure. Virginia, do you remember my
telling you once that I’d have a damned good try to make you care
for me."</p>

<p>"I remember," said Virginia softly. "But Superintendent Battle
was looking out of the window."</p>

<p>"Well, he isn’t now," said Anthony.</p>

<p>He caught her suddenly to him, kissing her eyelids, her lips,
the green gold of her hair....</p>

<p>"I do love you so, Virginia," he whispered. "I do love you so.
Do you love me?"</p>

<p>He looked down at her—sure of the answer.</p>

<p>Her head rested against his shoulder, and very low, in a sweet
shaken voice, she answered:</p>

<p>"Not a bit!"</p>

<p>"You little devil," cried Anthony, kissing her again. "Now I
know for certain that I shall love you until I die...."</p>
