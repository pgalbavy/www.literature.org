<p>"I <em>KNOW </em>the cause of Dawson's trouble," remarked Vose
Adams, late one night at the Heavenly Bower.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Wade Ruggles, while the rest listened intently.</p>

<p>"On my last trip to Sacramento, two months ago, I brought him
a thick letter: that's what is raising the mischief with him."</p>

<p>"But what was in the letter to make him act so queer?"</p>

<p>"How should I know? do you expect me to open and read all the
letters I bring through the mountains?"</p>

<p>"Bein' as you couldn't read the big letters the parson has painted
on the side of the rock a foot high," said Al Bidwell sarcastically,
"there ain't much danger of your doin' that, which the same is
lucky for them as gits love letters like myself regular by each
mail."</p>

<p>"Which the same you won't git any more onless you sling your
remarks a little more keerful," warned the mail carrier.</p>

<p>"And the same being that you can't read the directions writ onto
them, I don't see how you're going to help yourself."</p>

<p>"The postmaster at Sacramento is very obligin'," was the significant
comment of Vose.</p>

<p>Bidwell saw the dangerous ground on which he was treading, and
made it safe by a jesting remark and an invitation to Adams and
the rest to join him at the bar.</p>

<p>"We was on the subject of Dawson," remarked Ruggles from his
seat, for all had learned long before of the uselessness of inviting
him to drink; "and it's the opinion of Vose, I understand, that
it was the letter that has made the change in him."</p>

<p>"There ain't any doubt about it," said Adams; "fur the attack
took him right after; I noticed the difference in him the next
day. He sets by himself these evenings after the little gal has
gone to bed, smoking his pipe, without any light in his shanty,
and thinking hard."</p>

<p>Wade smoked thoughtfully a minute and then remarked:</p>

<p>"I wonder whether it wouldn't be a good idee to app'int a committee
to wait on Dawson and ask him what the blazes is the matter and
whether we can't do nothin' to make a man of him agin."</p>

<p>Since Ruggles had become accustomed to act as chairman at the
discussions in the Heavenly Bower, he had developed a strong faith
in committees.</p>

<p>"That's a piece of the most onspeakable foolishness that I've
run aginst since I settled in New Constantinople," observed the
landlord with a contemptuous sniff; "the minute the committee
arrove and stated their bus'ness, Dawson would kick 'em out of
his shanty and clean across the street, and he'd be lacking in
the instincts of a man if he didn't do that same thing."</p>

<p>"Mr. Ortigies forgits that I didn't mean to suggest that <em>he</em>
was to be a member of the committee; I meant they should be <em>gentlemen</em>;
consequently that bars him out and there wouldn't be no trouble."</p>

<p>"I understand your sarcasm, Wade, but your words would leave
you off the committee likewise; but may I ask what the members
would ask him when they knocked at his door?"</p>

<p>"Any gentleman wouldn't be at a loss what to say, fur he would
only hev to remark sorter careless like that he had observed the
man was acting so queer that we was afeard he was troubled with
remorse over some crime he'd committed, and about which he had
got notice that the officers was lookin' fur him, but that if
he'd trust us and give a description of the officers, so there
wouldn't be any mistake, we'd watch fur 'em up the trail and pick
'em off afore they could profane New Constantinople with their
presence."</p>

<p>This was a prodigious sentence for Wade, and he leaned back and
smoked his pipe with considerable self-complacency, but it impressed
none of his hearers as he expected. Parson Brush shook his head.</p>

<p>"It isn't a very wise way of introducing yourself to a man by
assuming that he is a fugitive from justice. In the first place,
I am sure there is nothing of the kind in the case of Dawson.
He has probably heard some news from the East that troubles him."</p>

<p>"That's just what I was sayin'," broke in Ruggles.</p>

<p>"But not of the nature intimated by you."</p>

<p>"What else can it be?"</p>

<p>"It might be one of a dozen things; I know you are all wrong
in your guesses."</p>

<p>Every eye was fixed upon the parson, for all were anxious to
learn at what he was hinting. His face was unusually grave, but
he stopped speaking, as if he deemed it indiscreet to say anything
more. He noticed the looks and whetted the curiosity by adding:</p>

<p>"I have been so disturbed over the change in Dawson that I called
on him last night and had a talk with him."</p>

<p>"And what did you learn?" asked Budge Isham, the moment Brush
showed an inclination to stop talking.</p>

<p>"Well, it was hard work to draw him out, but finally he told
me he had received a letter from the East, which made him think
he would have to leave us. That isn't the worst."</p>

<p>All were breathless, afraid to give utterance to the dread that
until then was vague and indistinct in their minds.</p>

<p>"He thinks he must take his daughter Nellie with him."</p>

<p>"What! Take her away from us? That can never be allowed."</p>

<p>None felt the anguish of the announcement keener than the man
who made it, but he looked calmly into the angry faces and said:</p>

<p>"You forget, my friends, that she is his child and he has the
moral and legal right to do what he thinks is best for her."</p>

<p>"But where are <em>our</em> rights?" demanded Wade Ruggles; "they
mustn't be forgot."</p>

<p>"We haven't any,&mdash;not a single one. But I am satisfied that one
cause of Dawson's distress of mind is the very question you have
asked. He can never cease to be deeply grateful to all of us for
what we have done for him and his child. He doesn't wish to take
her away for it will be as painful to her as to us. But friends,"
continued the parson, with a sense of right that was creditable
to him, "Dawson's first duty is to his child. She is now twelve
years old, quite a large girl and is growing fast. She has never
seen girl or woman since she was brought here; she will soon be
a young woman; she requires association with others of her own
sex; her welfare demands this; her education and proper training
can never be obtained in this mining settlement."</p>

<p>"Eddycation!" exclaimed Vose Adams; "what have you been doing
with her all this time? She must be as far along in her studies
and eddycation as me and Ruggles."</p>

<p>"It is to be hoped so," replied the parson with a smile; "I doubt
whether she will meet any one of her age as proficient in book
learning as herself, but there remains music, etiquette, and above
all, the social customs and accomplishments which can be acquired
nowhere except in the abode of civilization. There is none upon
whom this blow will fall more heavily than myself, but I have
no right to interpose when a man is doing his duty."</p>

<p>An exploding bomb could not have caused more consternation than
the news brought by the parson. Every one felt the truth of his
words and respected him for their utterance, but it was like asking
them to consent to the blotting of the sun from the heavens.</p>

<p>"I see a way out of it," finally remarked Wade Ruggles with a
brightening face; "we can compermise."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"Why, if Dawson feels that he and the gal must go, let him split
the difference atween us; he can go and leave her; that will satisfy
everybody."</p>

<p>"It will hardly satisfy him, since the whole question is that
of taking her with him. He must be left free to do whatever he
chooses."</p>

<p>The parson looked into the gloomy faces turned toward him.</p>

<p>"Boys, you have all heard the news brought by the last papers.
Fort Sumter has been fired on; President Lincoln has called for
volunteers; the Southern Confederacy has been declared and civil
war has begun. It is the intention of Dawson to offer his services
to the cause of the Union."</p>

<p>"And I shall enlist too," declared Wade Ruggles, compressing
his lips, "but it will be on the other side."</p>

<p>"I'm with you," added Budge Isham; "I am from Alabama, and if
she secedes, as she is sure to do, I am ready to lay down my life
in her defence."</p>

<p>"Sorry, pards, but that shoves me into the Union army," remarked
Al Bidwell, puffing quietly at his pipe; "we must keep the balance
right, but we'll part friends here and we'll be friends till we
shoulder our muskets. Then we'll do all we can to kill each other."</p>

<p>Further discussion disclosed that the citizens of New Constantinople
were about equally divided in their allegiance, but all of them
were not yet ready to take up arms in support of the cause with
which they sympathized. There were eight who announced their intention
of making their way to San Francisco, there to find the most available
route to the points necessary to reach. It was typical of that
stupendous struggle, the greatest of modern times, that four of
these recruits were ardent supporters of one cause and four equally
eager to risk their lives for the other. They were the warmest
of friends and had been for years, willing to face any danger
for the sake of the remainder. It would be the same until they
parted, and then, as one of them had already expressed it, they
would devote every energy to trying to kill one another.</p>

<p>None of the volunteers faltered until Maurice Dawson decided
to leave his daughter at the settlement until his return, if so
be he should be permitted to return. He knew of no better or safer
place for her, nor of any friends to whose care he would more
cheerfully commit her, in case it should be his lot to fall on
the field of battle.</p>

<p>It had been Parson Brush's intention to be Dawson's comrade in
his perils, but when the father begged him to stay behind to look
after his child he consented. And so the programme, so fraught
with momentous consequences, was arranged.</p>
