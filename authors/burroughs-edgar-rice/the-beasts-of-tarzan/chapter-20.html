The first consideration of the party was to locate fresh
water and make camp, for all knew that their term of
existence upon Jungle Island might be drawn out to months,
or even years.
<P>
Tarzan knew the nearest water, and to this he immediately
led the party.  Here the men fell to work to construct shelters
and rude furniture while Tarzan went into the jungle after
meat, leaving the faithful Mugambi and the Mosula woman
to guard Jane, whose safety he would never trust to any
member of the Kincaid's cut-throat crew.
<P>
Lady Greystoke suffered far greater anguish than any other
of the castaways, for the blow to her hopes and her already
cruelly lacerated mother-heart lay not in her own privations
but in the knowledge that she might now never be able to
learn the fate of her first-born or do aught to discover his
whereabouts, or ameliorate his condition--a condition which
imagination naturally pictured in the most frightful forms.
<P>
For two weeks the party divided the time amongst the
various duties which had been allotted to each.  A daylight
watch was maintained from sunrise to sunset upon a bluff
near the camp--a jutting shoulder of rock which overlooked
the sea.  Here, ready for instant lighting, was gathered a huge
pile of dry branches, while from a lofty pole which they had
set in the ground there floated an improvised distress signal
fashioned from a red undershirt which belonged to the mate
of the Kincaid.
<P>
But never a speck upon the horizon that might be sail or
smoke rewarded the tired eyes that in their endless, hopeless
vigil strained daily out across the vast expanse of ocean.
<P>
It was Tarzan who suggested, finally, that they attempt to
construct a vessel that would bear them back to the mainland.  
He alone could show them how to fashion rude tools, and
when the idea had taken root in the minds of the men they
were eager to commence their labours.
<P>
But as time went on and the Herculean nature of their task
became more and more apparent they fell to grumbling, and
to quarrelling among themselves, so that to the other dangers
were now added dissension and suspicion.
<P>
More than before did Tarzan now fear to leave Jane among
the half brutes of the Kincaid's crew; but hunting he must
do, for none other could so surely go forth and return with
meat as he.  Sometimes Mugambi spelled him at the hunting;
but the black's spear and arrows were never so sure of results
as the rope and knife of the ape-man.
<P>
Finally the men shirked their work, going off into the
jungle by twos to explore and to hunt.  All this time the camp
had had no sight of Sheeta, or Akut and the other great apes,
though Tarzan had sometimes met them in the jungle as he hunted.
<P>
And as matters tended from bad to worse in the camp of
the castaways upon the east coast of Jungle Island, another
camp came into being upon the north coast.
<P>
Here, in a little cove, lay a small schooner, the Cowrie,
whose decks had but a few days since run red with the blood
of her officers and the loyal members of her crew, for the
Cowrie had fallen upon bad days when it had shipped such
men as Gust and Momulla the Maori and that arch-fiend
Kai Shang of Fachan.
<P>
There were others, too, ten of them all told, the scum of
the South Sea ports; but Gust and Momulla and Kai Shang
were the brains and cunning of the company.  It was they who
had instigated the mutiny that they might seize and divide
the catch of pearls which constituted the wealth of the
Cowrie's cargo.
<P>
It was Kai Shang who had murdered the captain as he lay
asleep in his berth, and it had been Momulla the Maori who
had led the attack upon the officer of the watch.
<P>
Gust, after his own peculiar habit, had found means to
delegate to the others the actual taking of life.  Not that
Gust entertained any scruples on the subject, other than those
which induced in him a rare regard for his own personal safety.  
There is always a certain element of risk to the assassin,
for victims of deadly assault are seldom prone to die quietly
and considerately.  There is always a certain element of risk
to go so far as to dispute the issue with the murderer.
It was this chance of dispute which Gust preferred to forgo.
<P>
But now that the work was done the Swede aspired to the
position of highest command among the mutineers.  He had
even gone so far as to appropriate and wear certain articles
belonging to the murdered captain of the Cowrie--articles of
apparel which bore upon them the badges and insignia of authority.
<P>
Kai Shang was peeved.  He had no love for authority, and
certainly not the slightest intention of submitting to the
domination of an ordinary Swede sailor.
<P>
The seeds of discontent were, therefore, already planted in the camp
of the mutineers of the Cowrie at the north edge of Jungle Island.
But Kai Shang realized that he must act with circumspection,
for Gust alone of the motley horde possessed sufficient
knowledge of navigation to get them out of the South Atlantic
and around the cape into more congenial waters where they might
find a market for their ill-gotten wealth, and no questions asked.
<P>
The day before they sighted Jungle Island and discovered
the little land-locked harbour upon the bosom of which the
Cowrie now rode quietly at anchor, the watch had discovered
the smoke and funnels of a warship upon the southern horizon.
<P>
The chance of being spoken and investigated by a man-of-war
appealed not at all to any of them, so they put into hiding
for a few days until the danger should have passed.
<P>
And now Gust did not wish to venture out to sea again.  
There was no telling, he insisted, but that the ship they had
seen was actually searching for them.  Kai Shang pointed out
that such could not be the case since it was impossible for
any human being other than themselves to have knowledge
of what had transpired aboard the Cowrie.
<P>
But Gust was not to be persuaded.  In his wicked heart he
nursed a scheme whereby he might increase his share of the
booty by something like one hundred per cent.  He alone
could sail the Cowrie, therefore the others could not leave
Jungle Island without him; but what was there to prevent
Gust, with just sufficient men to man the schooner, slipping
away from Kai Shang, Momulla the Maori, and some half
of the crew when opportunity presented?
<P>
It was for this opportunity that Gust waited.  Some day
there would come a moment when Kai Shang, Momulla, and
three or four of the others would be absent from camp,
exploring or hunting.  The Swede racked his brain for some plan
whereby he might successfully lure from the sight of the
anchored ship those whom he had determined to abandon.
<P>
To this end he organized hunting party after hunting party,
but always the devil of perversity seemed to enter the soul of
Kai Shang, so that wily celestial would never hunt except
in the company of Gust himself.
<P>
One day Kai Shang spoke secretly with Momulla the Maori,
pouring into the brown ear of his companion the suspicions
which he harboured concerning the Swede.  Momulla was for
going immediately and running a long knife through
the heart of the traitor.
<P>
It is true that Kai Shang had no other evidence than the
natural cunning of his own knavish soul--but he imagined
in the intentions of Gust what he himself would have been
glad to accomplish had the means lain at hand.
<P>
But he dared not let Momulla slay the Swede, upon whom
they depended to guide them to their destination.  
They decided, however, that it would do no harm to attempt to
frighten Gust into acceding to their demands, and with this
purpose in mind the Maori sought out the self-constituted
commander of the party.
<P>
When he broached the subject of immediate departure
Gust again raised his former objection--that the warship
might very probably be patrolling the sea directly in their
southern path, waiting for them to make the attempt to reach
other waters.
<P>
Momulla scoffed at the fears of his fellow, pointing out
that as no one aboard any warship knew of their mutiny there
could be no reason why they should be suspected.
<P>
"Ah!" exclaimed Gust, "there is where you are wrong.  
There is where you are lucky that you have an educated man
like me to tell you what to do.  You are an ignorant savage,
Momulla, and so you know nothing of wireless."
<P>
The Maori leaped to his feet and laid his hand upon the
hilt of his knife.
<P>
"I am no savage," he shouted.
<P>
"I was only joking," the Swede hastened to explain.  "We are
old friends, Momulla; we cannot afford to quarrel, at least
not while old Kai Shang is plotting to steal all the pearls
from us.  If he could find a man to navigate the Cowrie he
would leave us in a minute.  All his talk about getting away
from here is just because he has some scheme in his head to
get rid of us."
<P>
"But the wireless," asked Momulla.  "What has the wireless
to do with our remaining here?"
<P>
"Oh yes," replied Gust, scratching his head.  He was wondering
if the Maori were really so ignorant as to believe the
preposterous lie he was about to unload upon him.  "Oh yes! 
You see every warship is equipped with what they call a
wireless apparatus.  It lets them talk to other ships hundreds
of miles away, and it lets them listen to all that is said on
these other ships.  Now, you see, when you fellows were
shooting up the Cowrie you did a whole lot of loud talking, and
there isn't any doubt but that that warship was a-lyin' off south
of us listenin' to it all.  Of course they might not have learned
the name of the ship, but they heard enough to know that the
crew of some ship was mutinying and killin' her officers.  So you
see they'll be waiting to search every ship they sight for a
long time to come, and they may not be far away now."
<P>
When he had ceased speaking the Swede strove to assume
an air of composure that his listener might not have his
suspicions aroused as to the truth of the statements that
had just been made.
<P>
Momulla sat for some time in silence, eyeing Gust.  At last
he rose.
<P>
"You are a great liar," he said.  "If you don't get us on
our way by tomorrow you'll never have another chance to lie,
for I heard two of the men saying that they'd like to run
a knife into you and that if you kept them in this hole any
longer they'd do it."
<P>
"Go and ask Kai Shang if there is not a wireless," replied Gust.  
"He will tell you that there is such a thing and that vessels
can talk to one another across hundreds of miles of water.  
Then say to the two men who wish to kill me that if they
do so they will never live to spend their share of the
swag, for only I can get you safely to any port."
<P>
So Momulla went to Kai Shang and asked him if there was
such an apparatus as a wireless by means of which ships
could talk with each other at great distances, and Kai Shang
told him that there was.
<P>
Momulla was puzzled; but still he wished to leave the
island, and was willing to take his chances on the open sea
rather than to remain longer in the monotony of the camp.
<P>
"If we only had someone else who could navigate a ship!"
wailed Kai Shang.
<P>
That afternoon Momulla went hunting with two other Maoris.  
They hunted toward the south, and had not gone far
from camp when they were surprised by the sound of voices
ahead of them in the jungle.
<P>
They knew that none of their own men had preceded them,
and as all were convinced that the island was uninhabited,
they were inclined to flee in terror on the hypothesis that the
place was haunted--possibly by the ghosts of the murdered
officers and men of the Cowrie.
<P>
But Momulla was even more curious than he was superstitious,
and so he quelled his natural desire to flee from the supernatural.  
Motioning his companions to follow his example, he dropped
to his hands and knees, crawling forward stealthily and
with quakings of heart through the jungle in the direction
from which came the voices of the unseen speakers.
<P>
Presently, at the edge of a little clearing, he halted, and
there he breathed a deep sigh of relief, for plainly before him
he saw two flesh-and-blood men sitting upon a fallen log and
talking earnestly together.
<P>
One was Schneider, mate of the Kincaid, and the other
was a seaman named Schmidt.
<P>
"I think we can do it, Schmidt," Schneider was saying.  
"A good canoe wouldn't be hard to build, and three of us
could paddle it to the mainland in a day if the wind was right
and the sea reasonably calm.  There ain't no use waiting for
the men to build a big enough boat to take the whole party,
for they're sore now and sick of working like slaves all day long.  
It ain't none of our business anyway to save the Englishman.  
Let him look out for himself, says I."  He paused for a moment,
and then eyeing the other to note the effect of his next words,
he continued, "But we might take the woman.  It would be a shame
to leave a nice-lookin' piece like she is in such a
Gott-forsaken hole as this here island."
<P>
Schmidt looked up and grinned.
<P>
"So that's how she's blowin', is it?" he asked.  "Why didn't
you say so in the first place?  Wot's in it for me if I help you?"
<P>
"She ought to pay us well to get her back to civilization,"
explained Schneider, "an' I tell you what I'll do.  I'll just
whack up with the two men that helps me.   I'll take half an'
they can divide the other half--you an' whoever the other
bloke is.  I'm sick of this place, an' the sooner I get
out of it the better I'll like it.  What do you say?"
<P>
"Suits me," replied Schmidt.  "I wouldn't know how to
reach the mainland myself, an' know that none o' the other
fellows would, so's you're the only one that knows anything
of navigation you're the fellow I'll tie to."
<P>
Momulla the Maori pricked up his ears.  He had a smattering
of every tongue that is spoken upon the seas, and more
than a few times had he sailed on English ships, so that he
understood fairly well all that had passed between Schneider
and Schmidt since he had stumbled upon them.
<P>
He rose to his feet and stepped into the clearing.  Schneider and
his companion started as nervously as though a ghost had risen
before them.  Schneider reached for his revolver.  Momulla raised
his right hand, palm forward, as a sign of his pacific intentions.
<P>
"I am a friend," he said.  "I heard you; but do not fear
that I will reveal what you have said.  I can help you, and you
can help me."  He was addressing Schneider.  "You can navigate
a ship, but you have no ship.  We have a ship, but no one to
navigate it.  If you will come with us and ask no questions
we will let you take the ship where you will after you
have landed us at a certain port, the name of which we will
give you later.  You can take the woman of whom you speak,
and we will ask no questions either.  Is it a bargain?"
<P>
Schneider desired more information, and got as much as
Momulla thought best to give him.  Then the Maori suggested
that they speak with Kai Shang.  The two members of the
Kincaid's company followed Momulla and his fellows to a
point in the jungle close by the camp of the mutineers.  
Here Momulla hid them while he went in search of Kai Shang,
first admonishing his Maori companions to stand guard over
the two sailors lest they change their minds and attempt
to escape.  Schneider and Schmidt were virtually prisoners,
though they did not know it.
<P>
Presently Momulla returned with Kai Shang, to whom he
had briefly narrated the details of the stroke of good fortune
that had come to them.  The Chinaman spoke at length with
Schneider, until, notwithstanding his natural suspicion of
the sincerity of all men, he became quite convinced that
Schneider was quite as much a rogue as himself and that the
fellow was anxious to leave the island.
<P>
These two premises accepted there could be little doubt
that Schneider would prove trustworthy in so far as accepting
the command of the Cowrie was concerned; after that Kai
Shang knew that he could find means to coerce the man into
submission to his further wishes.
<P>
When Schneider and Schmidt left them and set out in the
direction of their own camp, it was with feelings of far
greater relief than they had experienced in many a day.  
Now at last they saw a feasible plan for leaving the island
upon a seaworthy craft.  There would be no more hard labour
at ship-building, and no risking their lives upon a crudely
built makeshift that would be quite as likely to go to the
bottom as it would to reach the mainland.
<P>
Also, they were to have assistance in capturing the woman,
or rather women, for when Momulla had learned that there
was a black woman in the other camp he had insisted that
she be brought along as well as the white woman.
<P>
As Kai Shang and Momulla entered their camp, it was
with a realization that they no longer needed Gust.  
They marched straight to the tent in which they might expect to
find him at that hour of the day, for though it would have
been more comfortable for the entire party to remain aboard
the ship, they had mutually decided that it would be safer for
all concerned were they to pitch their camp ashore.
<P>
Each knew that in the heart of the others was sufficient
treachery to make it unsafe for any member of the party to
go ashore leaving the others in possession of the Cowrie, so
not more than two or three men at a time were ever permitted
aboard the vessel unless all the balance of the company
was there too.
<P>
As the two crossed toward Gust's tent the Maori felt the
edge of his long knife with one grimy, calloused thumb.  
The Swede would have felt far from comfortable could he have
seen this significant action, or read what was passing amid
the convolutions of the brown man's cruel brain.
<P>
Now it happened that Gust was at that moment in the tent
occupied by the cook, and this tent stood but a few feet
from his own.  So that he heard the approach of Kai Shang
and Momulla, though he did not, of course, dream that it
had any special significance for him.
<P>
Chance had it, though, that he glanced out of the doorway
of the cook's tent at the very moment that Kai Shang and
Momulla approached the entrance to his, and he thought that
he noted a stealthiness in their movements that comported
poorly with amicable or friendly intentions, and then, just as
they two slunk within the interior, Gust caught a glimpse of
the long knife which Momulla the Maori was then carrying
behind his back.
<P>
The Swede's eyes opened wide, and a funny little sensation
assailed the roots of his hairs.  Also he turned almost white
beneath his tan.  Quite precipitately he left the cook's tent.  
He was not one who required a detailed exposition of intentions
that were quite all too obvious.
<P>
As surely as though he had heard them plotting, he knew
that Kai Shang and Momulla had come to take his life.  
The knowledge that he alone could navigate the Cowrie had,
up to now, been sufficient assurance of his safety; but quite
evidently something had occurred of which he had no knowledge
that would make it quite worth the while of his co-conspirators
to eliminate him.
<P>
Without a pause Gust darted across the beach and into the jungle.  
He was afraid of the jungle; uncanny noises that were
indeed frightful came forth from its recesses--the tangled
mazes of the mysterious country back of the beach.
<P>
But if Gust was afraid of the jungle he was far more afraid
of Kai Shang and Momulla.  The dangers of the jungle were
more or less problematical, while the danger that menaced
him at the hands of his companions was a perfectly well-
known quantity, which might be expressed in terms of a few
inches of cold steel, or the coil of a light rope.  He had seen
Kai Shang garrotte a man at Pai-sha in a dark alleyway back
of Loo Kotai's place.  He feared the rope, therefore, more
than he did the knife of the Maori; but he feared them both
too much to remain within reach of either.  Therefore he chose
the pitiless jungle.
