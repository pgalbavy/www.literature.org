<p>Mappo, the merry monkey, picked up a long, clean straw and put it in
his mouth, almost as a man might do with a toothpick. Mappo sat chewing
on the straw and looking at Tinkle.
</p><p>“Tell me about that nice home where you used to live, little pony,”
said Mappo. “Maybe it will make you feel better to talk about it.”
</p><p>“I think it will,” sighed Tinkle. “Oh, I just <u>love</u> to talk about
George and Mabel, they were so good and kind to me! And so was Patrick,
the coachman.”
</p><p>So Tinkle told Mappo the story of his home and of his having been taken
away in the moving van.
</p><p>“Those were queer adventures,” said Mappo. “Almost as queer as those I
had.”
</p><p>“Did you have adventures, too?” asked Tinkle.
</p><p>“Indeed I did,” answered the merry monkey, and he told his story of
having once lived in the jungle-forest and of how he had been caught
and put in the circus.
</p><p>“I had so many adventures,” said Mappo, “that a man put them in a book,
as he did those of Tum Tum, Dido and some other animals. Maybe you’ll
be put in a book, too, Tinkle.”
</p><p>“Oh, nothing like that will ever happen to <u>me</u>!” said the trick pony.
But that only goes to show we never can tell what is going to happen
in this world, doesn’t it? For Tinkle <u>is</u> in this very book you are
reading. And how surprised he was when he heard about it and saw his
pictures!
</p><p>But now we will leave him talking to Mappo, if you please, and go back
to where George and Mabel live. You will remember that Patrick, the
coachman, had gone to the store for salve for one of the horses, and
that George and Mabel, with their father and mother, were visiting in
the country.
</p><p>When Patrick came back with the salve the first thing he noticed was
that Tinkle was not in his stall.
</p><p>Patrick searched all around for Tinkle, but, of course, could not find
him. He asked the people living in neighboring houses, but none of them
had seen Tinkle go away, because the men shut him up inside the moving
van, you see. Some persons had seen the big wagon near the stable but
none had seen Tinkle put into it.
</p><p>Patrick even got a policeman and a fireman, whom he knew, to look for
Tinkle, but they could not find him. And when, a day or so later, Mr.
and Mrs. Farley came back from the country, with George and Mabel, the
two children cried when told that Tinkle was gone.
</p><p>“I think I must cheer them up a bit,” said Mr. Farley to his wife one
afternoon. “They are thinking too much about Tinkle. I must take their
minds off him.”
</p><p>“How will you do it?” asked Mrs. Farley.
</p><p>“A circus is coming to town to-morrow,” said her husband. “I’ll take
the children to see that, and when they watch the funny monkeys, the
queer clowns and the big elephants they will forget about Tinkle.”
</p><p>So, when the big show with the white tents came to the city where the
Farleys lived, George and Mabel were taken with their father to see the
wonderful sight.
</p><p>“Do you think there’ll be any ponies in the circus?” asked George.
</p><p>“Why, yes, maybe,” answered Mr. Farley. “Why?”
</p><p>“I’m not going to look at them,” said Mabel.
</p><p>“Nor I,” added George. “They’d make me think too much of our Tinkle.”
</p><p>On the way to the circus with their father, Mabel and George passed
through a part of the city where there were not many houses, and in
what few homes there were poor people lived.
</p><p>Many of them owned goats, some for the milk they gave, for the milk of
goats is almost as good as that of cows.
</p><p>“Oh, see that big goat!” cried George as they passed a small house,
on the rocks behind which a goat was jumping about. “Look how easy he
jumps!”
</p><p>“You may well say that!” exclaimed a pleasant-faced Irish woman at the
front gate. “Sure, Lightfoot is the most illigint goat that ever was.”
</p><p>“Is Lightfoot his name?” asked Mr. Farley.
</p><p>“Sure an’ it is, for it fits him well. He’s that light on his feet
you’d never know he was jumpin’ at all. Ah, he’s a fine goat.”
</p><p>“I had a fine pony once,” said George, “but somebody took him away.”
</p><p>“That’s too bad,” said the Irish woman, whose name was Mrs. Malony.
“Sure but I’d like to see any one, not a friend, try to take Lightfoot
away. He’d butt ’em with his horns.”
</p><p>“Isn’t it too bad Tinkle didn’t have horns?” sighed Mabel, as she
walked on.
</p><p>“A pony with horns would be a funny one,” said her brother.
</p><p>I wish I had time to tell you all that George and Mabel did at the
circus and the many things they saw, from Tum Tum the jolly elephant to
Mappo the merry monkey. They laughed at the clowns, ate popcorn and
peanuts, giving some to the elephants, feeding a whole bag of peanuts
to Tum Tum, though they did not know his name. But they were sure he
was nice because he looked at them in such a funny, jolly way.
</p><p>“Oh, look at the ponies!” cried Mabel, as the little horses trotted
into the middle ring. There was Prancer and Tiny Tim, as well as
others, and they were going to do their tricks.
</p><p>“They are nice ponies,” said George, glancing at them, even though he
and Mabel had said they would not look. “But not one of them is as nice
as Tinkle.”
</p><p>The ponies went through their tricks, doing their very best, and then,
when the time came, Tinkle himself was led in to do his tricks alone,
as of late he always did. Mabel and George were looking the other way
just then, watching a man turn a somersault over the backs of Tum Tum
and some other elephants, and at first they did not see Tinkle. But as
George turned in time to watch the trick pony take the United States
flag out of the box, and bring it to Mr. Drake the little boy cried:
</p><p>“Oh, Mabel! See that pony!”
</p><p>“Which one?” asked the little girl.
</p><p>“There,” and George pointed. “Doesn’t he look just like Tinkle? He has
four white feet and a white star on his head. Mabel, see, isn’t he
just like our pony? Why――why!” cried George, standing up in his seat,
and very much excited, “it <u>is</u> Tinkle! Oh, Mabel, it <u>is</u> Tinkle!”
</p><p>“I――I believe it is,” said the little girl slowly.
</p><p>Persons sitting near the children looked at them, and then at the pony.
Mr. Farley, too, was staring at the little trick horse.
</p><p>“I wonder if it could be Tinkle?” he asked himself.
</p><p>George was sure he was right――so sure that he jumped from his seat and
rushed into the ring where the pony had just finished his tricks.
</p><p>“Tinkle! Tinkle!” said George. “It <u>is</u> you, isn’t it? And you know me,
don’t you?”
</p><p>Tinkle knew his little master at once though it was several months
since he had seen him. The pony trotted across the ring, and while the
trainer, the circus folk, and the people in their seats looked on in
wonder, George threw his arms around the pony’s neck.
</p><p>Tinkle whinnied. That was the only way he could talk our language, but
it meant he was glad to see George again――very glad indeed.
</p><p>“Oh, Tinkle, Tinkle!” cried the happy little boy. “I’ve found you
again! I’ve found our Tinkle!”
</p><p>[Illustration: George threw his arms around the pony’s neck.]
</p><p>“What does this mean?” asked Mr. Drake. “Do you say this is your pony?
I bought him for the circus.”
</p><p>“Yes, Tinkle is my pony,” cried George. “Mine and Mabel’s. I taught him
some tricks, too. Make a bow, Tinkle.” And Tinkle did.
</p><p>“Well, this is very strange,” said the trainer. “He minds you and does
tricks for you. But I bought him of a man, and――”
</p><p>“Perhaps I can explain,” said Mr. Farley, coming into the ring with
Mabel, who not only put her arms around Tinkle’s neck but kissed him on
his white star. And Tinkle rubbed his soft nose against her soft cheek.
“This looks very much like my little boy’s pony, that was stolen from
our stable some time ago,” went on Mr. Farley, and he told of having
bought Tinkle at the stock farm.
</p><p>“Well, I guess you’re right, and it is your little boy’s pet,” said the
circus man, after Tinkle’s story had been told by Mr. Farley. “I didn’t
like the looks of the man from whom I bought the pony, but I never
thought he had stolen Tinkle.”
</p><p>There was no doubt that Tinkle belonged to George. You could tell that
by watching how glad the pony was to see his master again. The people
in the audience thought it was all part of the circus, and laughed as
Tinkle followed George about the ring.
</p><p>The circus man was sorry to lose Tinkle but, as he said he had no right
to him, he agreed to let George and Mabel have the pony back.
</p><p>“And may we take him now?” asked George eagerly.
</p><p>“Yes, I guess so,” said Mr. Drake. “There is an old pony cart in one of
the tents. You can drive Tinkle home in that and send the cart back by
your coachman. But you may keep Tinkle.”
</p><p>“And we’ll never let him go away again,” said George.
</p><p>“Never!” cried his sister. “We’ll keep him forever.”
</p><p>A man took Tinkle away to harness him to the pony cart. Tinkle had a
chance to say good-by to Mappo and Tum Tum.
</p><p>“So you are going back to your old home,” observed the monkey. “I am
glad, for you never would have been happy here in the circus, though it
just suits me.”
</p><p>“And me, also,” added Tum Tum, the jolly elephant. “If you see Dido,
the dancing bear,” he went on, “tell him to hurry back. We are lonesome
without him.”
</p><p>“I will!” cried Tinkle, who was so excited he could hardly wait to be
harnessed. He was very eager to be with George and Mabel again.
</p><p>The circus men patted the pony, for they liked him. Tinkle called
good-by to Tum Tum, Mappo and all his animal friends, and then, the
pony cart being ready, he trotted home with Mr. Farley, George and
Mabel.
</p><p>“There is that funny goat, Lightfoot, again,” said George as they
passed the home of Mrs. Malony.
</p><p>“Yes,” said Mabel. “I like him. I wonder if we will ever see him again?”
</p><p>And they did, several times; and you may read about it in the book to
come after this, which will be called: “Lightfoot, the Leaping Goat:
His Many Adventures.”
</p><p>You may well imagine how surprised Mrs. Farley and Patrick were to see
the children come driving home with the long-lost Tinkle.
</p><p>“We found him in the circus!” cried George.
</p><p>“And he can do ever so many more tricks,” said Mabel, laughing.
</p><p>“You ought to see him find the flag!” added her brother, and they began
to make Tinkle do some of his new circus tricks. So while the children
are doing that, and telling their mother how they found Tinkle again,
this will be a good chance for us to say good-by to the trick pony.
