<p>He had surrendered to his thirst. What weakness! He had not thrown
himself over, then. What folly! One splash of water on his face
had been enough. He was contemptible; and lying collapsed, in
a sort of tormented apathy, at the mouth of the cave, I despised
and envied his good fortune. It could not save him from death,
but at least he drank. I understood this when I heard his voice,
a voice altogether altered&mdash;a firm, greedy voice saying, "More,"
breathlessly. And then he drank again. He was drinking. He was
drinking up there in the light of the fire, in a circle of mortal
enemies, under Manuel's gloating eyes. Drinking! O happiness!
O delight! What a miserable wretch! I clawed the stone convulsively;
I think I would have rushed out for my share if I had not heard
Manuel's cruel and caressing voice:</p>

<p>"How now? You do not want to throw yourself over, my Castro?"</p>

<p>"I have drunk," he said gloomily.</p>

<p>I think they must have given him something to eat then. In my
mind there are many blanks in the vision of that scene, a vision
built upon a few words reaching me, suddenly, with great intervals
of silence between, as though I had been coming to myself out
of a dead faint now and then. A ferocious hum of many voices would
rise sometimes impatiently, the scrambling of feet near the edge;
or, in a sinister and expectant stillness, Manuel the artist would
be speaking to his "beloved victim Castro" in a gentle and insinuating
voice that seemed to tremble slightly with eagerness. Had he eaten
and drunk enough? They had kept their promises, he said. They
would keep them all. The water had been cool&mdash;and presently he,
Manuel-del-Popolo, would accompany with his guitar and his voice
the last moments of his victim. Bursts of laughter punctuated
his banter. Ah! that Manuel, that Manuel! Some actually swore
in admiration. But was Castro really at his ease? Was it not good
to eat and drink? Had he quite returned to life? But, <em>Caramba,
amigos</em>, what neglect! The <em>caballero</em> who has honoured
us must smoke. They shouted in high glee: "Yes. Smoke, Castro.
Let him smoke." I suppose he did; and Manuel expounded to him
how pleasant life was in which one could eat, and drink, and smoke.
His words tortured me. Castro remained mute&mdash;from disdain, from
despair, perhaps. Afterwards they carried him along clear of the
cornice, and I understood they formed a half-circle round him,
drawing their knives. Manuel, screeching in a high falsetto, ordered
the bonds of his feet to be cut. I advanced my head out as far
as I dared; their voices reached me deadened; I could only see
the profound shadow of the ravine, a patch of dark clear sky opulent
with stars, and the play of the firelight on the opposite side.
The shadow of a pair of monumental feet, and the lower edge of
a cloak, spread amply like a skirt, stood out in it, intensely
black and motionless, right in front of the cave. Now and then,
elbowed in the surge round Castro, the guitar emitted a deep and
hollow resonance. He was tumultuously ordered to stand up and,
I imagine, he was being pricked with the points of their knives
till he did get on his feet. "Jump!" they roared all together&mdash;and
Manuel began to finger the strings, lifting up his voice between
the gusts of savage hilarity, mingled with cries of death. He
exhorted his followers to close on the traitor inch by inch, presenting
their knives.</p>

<p>"He runs here and there, the blood trickling from his limbs&mdash;but
in vain, this is the appointed time for the leap...."</p>

<p>It was an improvisation; they stamped their feet to the slow
measure; they shouted in chorus the one word "Leap!" raising a
ferocious roar; and between whiles the song of voice and strings
came to me from a distance, softened and lingering in a voluptuous
and pitiless cadence that wrung my heart, and seemed to eat up
the remnants of my strength. But what could I have done, even
if I had had the strength of a giant, and a most fearless resolution?
I should have been shot dead before I had crawled halfway up the
ledge. A piercing shriek covered the guitar, the song, and the
wild merriment.</p>

<p>Then everything seemed to stop&mdash;even my own painful breathing.
Again Castro shrieked like a madman:</p>

<p>"Señorita&mdash;your gold. Señorita! Hear me! Help!"</p>

<p>Then all was still.</p>

<p>"Hear the dead calling to the dead," sneered Manuel.</p>

<p>An awestruck sort of hum proceeded from the Spaniards. Was the
senorita alive? In the cave? Or where?</p>

<p>"Her nod would have saved thee, Castro," said Manuel slowly.
I got up. I heard Castro stammer wildly:</p>

<p>"She shall fill both your hands with gold. Do you hear, hombres?
I, Castro, tell you&mdash;each man&mdash;both hands<hr>"</p>

<p>He had done it. The last hope was gone now. And all that there
remained for me to do was to leap over or give myself up, and
end this horrible business.</p>

<p>"She was a creature born to command the moon and the stars,"
Manuel mused aloud in a vibrating tone, and suddenly smote the
strings with emphatic violence. She could even stay his vengeance.
But was it possible! No, no. It could not be&mdash;and yet....</p>

<p>"Thou art alive yet, Castro," he cried. "Thou hast eaten and
drunk; life is good&mdash;is it not, old man?&mdash;and the leap is high."</p>

<p>He thundered "Silence!" to still the excited murmurs of his band.
If she lived Castro should live, too&mdash;he, Manuel, said so; but
he threatened him with horrible tortures, with two days of slow
dying, if he dared to deceive. Let him, then, speak the truth
quickly.</p>

<p>"Speak, 'viejo'. Where is she?"</p>

<p>And at the opening, fifty yards away, I was tempted to call out,
as though I had loved Castro well enough to save him from the
shame and remorse of a plain betrayal. That the moment of it had
come I could have no doubt. And it was I myself, perhaps, who
could not face the certitude of his downfall. If my throat had
not been so compressed, so dry with thirst and choked with emotion,
I believe I should have cried out and brought them away from that
miserable man with a rush. Since we were lost, he at least should
be saved from this. I suffered from his spasmodic, agonized laugh
away there, with twenty knives aimed at his breast and the eighty-foot
drop of the precipice at his back. Why did he hesitate?</p>

<p>I was to learn, then, that the ultimate value of life to all
of us is based on the means of self-deception. Morally he had
his back against the wall, he could not hope to deceive himself;
and after Manuel had cried again at him, "Where are they?" in
a really terrible tone, I heard his answer:</p>

<p>"At the bottom of the sea."</p>

<p>He had his own courage after all&mdash;if only the courage not to
believe in Manuel's promises. And he must have been weary of his
life&mdash;weary enough not to pay that price. And yet he had gone
to the very verge, calling upon Seraphina as if she could hear
him. Madness of fear, no doubt&mdash;succeeded by an awakening, a heroic
reaction. And yet sometimes it seems to me as if the whole scene,
with his wild cries for help, had been the outcome of a supreme
exercise of cunning. For, indeed, he could not have invented anything
better to bring the conviction of our death to the most sceptical
of those ruffians. All I heard after his words had been a great
shout, followed by a sudden and unbroken silence. It seemed to
last a very long time. He had thrown himself over! It is like
the blank space of a swoon to me, and yet it must have been real
enough, because, huddled up just inside the sill, with my head
reposing wearily on the stone, I watched three moving flames of
lighted branches carried by men follow each other closely in a
swaying descent along the path on the other side of the ravine.
They passed on downwards, flickering out of view. Then, after
a time, a voice below, to the left of the cave, ascended with
a hooting and mournful effect from the depths.</p>

<p>"Manuel! Manuel! We have found him!... <em>Es muerte!</em>"</p>

<p>And from above Manuel's shout rolled, augmented, between the
rocks.</p>

<p>"<em>Bueno!</em> Turn his face up&mdash;for the birds!"</p>

<p>They continued calling to each other for a good while. The men
below declared their intention of going on to the sea shore; and
Manuel shouted to them not to forget to send him up a good rope
early in the morning. Apparently, the schooner had been refloated
some time before; many of the <em>Lugareños</em> were to sleep
on board. They purposed to set sail early next day.</p>

<p>This revived me, and I spent the night between Seraphina's couch
and the mouth of the cave, keeping tight hold of my reason that
seemed to lose itself in this hope, in this darkness, in this
torment. I touched her cheek, it was hot&mdash;while her forehead felt
to my fingers as cold as ice. I had no more voice, but I tried
to force out some harsh whispers through my throat. They sounded
horrible to my own ears, and she endeavoured to soothe me by murmuring
my name feebly. I believe she thought me delirious. I tried to
pray for my strength to last till I could carry her out of that
cave to the side of the brook&mdash;then let death come. "Live, live,"
I whispered into her ear, and would hear a sigh so faint, so feeble,
that it swayed all my soul with pity and fear, "Yes, Juan."...
And I would go away to watch for the dawn from the mouth of the
cave, and curse the stars that would not fade.</p>

<p>Manuel's voice always steadied me. A languor had come over them
above, as if their passion had been exhausted; as if their hearts
had been saddened by an unbridled debauch. There was, however,
their everlasting quarrelling. Several of them, I understood,
left the camp for the schooner, but avoiding the road by the ravine
as if Castro's dead body down there had made it impassable. And
the talk went on late into the night. There was some superstitious
fear attached to the cave&mdash;a legend of men who had gone in and
had never come back any more. All they knew of it was the region
of twilight; formerly, when they used the shelter of the cavern,
no one, it seems, ever ventured outside the circle of the fire.
Manuel disdained their fears. Had he not been such a profound
politico, a man of stratagems, there would have been a necessity
to go down and see.... They all protested.</p>

<p>Who was going down? Not they.... Their craven cowardice was amazing.</p>

<p>He begged them to keep themselves quiet. They had him for <em>Capataz</em>
now. A man of intelligence. Had he not enticed Castro out? He
had never believed there was any one else in there. He sighed.
Otherwise Castro would have tried to save his life by confessing.
There had been nothing to confess. But he had the means of making
sure. A voice suggested that the <em>Inglez</em> might have withdrawn
himself into the depths. These English were not afraid of demons,
being devils themselves; and this one was fiendishly reckless.
But Manuel observed, contemptuously, that a man trapped like this
would remain near the opening. Hope would keep him there till
he died&mdash;unless he rushed out like Castro-Manuel laughed, but
in a mournful tone: and, listening to the craven talk of their
doubts and fears, it seemed to me that if I could appear at one
bound amongst them, they would scatter like chaff before my glance
It seemed intolerable to wait; more than human strength could
bear. Would the day never come? A drowsiness stole upon their
voices.</p>

<p>Manuel kept watch. He fed the fire, and his incomplete shadow,
projected across the chasm, would pass and return, obscuring the
glow that fell on the rock. His footsteps seemed to measure the
interminable duration of the night. Sometimes he would stop short
and talk to himself in low, exalted mutters. A big bright star
rested on the brow of the rock opposite, shining straight into
my eyes. It sank, as if it had plunged into the stone. At last.
Another came to look into the cavern. I watched the gradual coming
of a gray sheen from the side of Seraphina's couch. This was the
day, the last day of pain, or else of life. Its ghostly edge invaded
slowly the darkness of the cave towards its appointed limit, creeping
slowly, as colourless as spilt water on the floor. I pressed my
lips silently upon her cheek. Her eyes were open. It seemed to
me she had a smile fainter than her sighs. She was very brave,
but her smile did not go beyond her lips. Not a feature of her
face moved. I could have opened my veins for her without hesitation,
if it had not been a forbidden sacrifice.</p>

<p>Would they go? I asked myself. Through Castro's heroism or through
his weakness, perhaps through both the heroism and the weakness
of that man, they must be satisfied. They must be. I could not
doubt it; I could not believe it. Everything seemed improbable;
everything seemed possible. If they descended I would, I thought,
have the strength to carry her off, away into the darkness. If
there was any truth in what I had overheard them saying, that
the depths of the cavern concealed an abyss, we would cast ourselves
into it.</p>

<p>The feeble, consenting pressure of her hand horrified me. They
would not come down. They were afraid of that place, I whispered
to her&mdash;and I thought to myself that such cowardice was incredible.
Our fate was sealed. And yet from what I had heard....</p>

<p>We watched the daylight growing in the opening; at any moment
it might have been obscured by their figures. The tormenting incertitudes
of that hour were cruel enough to overcome, almost, the sensations
of thirst, of hunger, to engender a restlessness that had the
effect of renewed vigour. They were like a nightmare; but that
nightmare seemed to clear my mind of its feverish hallucinations.
I was more collected, then, than I had been for the last forty-eight
hours of our imprisonment. But I could not remain there, waiting.
It was absolutely necessary that I should watch at the entrance
for the moment of their departure.</p>

<p>The morning was serenely cool and, in its stillness, their talk
filled with clear-cut words the calm air of the ravine. A party
&mdash;I could not tell how many&mdash;had already come up from the
schooner in a great state of excitement. They feared that their
presence had, in some way, become known to the peons of the <em>hacienda</em>.
There was much abuse of a man called Carneiro, who, the day before,
had fired an incautious shot at a fat cow on one of the inland
<em>savannas</em>. They cursed him. Last night, before the moon
rose, those on board the schooner had heard the whinnying of a
horse. Somebody had ridden down to the water's edge in the darkness
and, after waiting a while, had galloped back the way he came.
The prints of hoofs on the beach showed that.</p>

<p>They feared these horsemen greatly. A vengeance was owing for
the man Manuel had killed; and I could guess they talked with
their faces over their shoulders. "And what about finding out
whether the <em>Inglez</em> was there, dead or alive?" asked some.</p>

<p>I was sure, now, that they would not come down in a body. It
would expose them to the danger of being caught in the cavern
by the peons. There was no time for a thorough search, they argued.</p>

<p>For the first time that morning I heard Manuel's voice, "Stand
aside."</p>

<p>He came down to the very brink.</p>

<p>"If the <em>Inglez</em> is down there, and if he is alive, he
is listening to us now."</p>

<p>He was as certain as though he had been able to see me. He added:</p>

<p>"But there's no one."</p>

<p>"Go and look, Manuel," they cried.</p>

<p>He said something in a tone of contempt. The Voices above my
head sank into busy murmurs.</p>

<p>"Give me the rope here," he said aloud.</p>

<p>I had a feeling of some inconceivable danger nearing me; and
in my state of weakness I began to tremble, backing away from
the orifice. I had no strength in my limbs. I had no weapons.
How could I fight? I would use my teeth. With a light knocking
against the rock above the arch, Williams' flask, tied by its
green cord to the end of a thick rope, descended slowly, and hung
motionless before the entrance.</p>

<p>It had been freshly filled with water; it was dripping wet outside,
and the silver top, struck by the sunbeams, dazzled my eyes.</p>

<p>This was the danger&mdash;this bait. And it seems to me that if I
had had the slightest inkling of what was coming, I should have
rushed at it instantly. But it took me some time to understand&mdash;to
take in the idea that this was water, there, within reach of my
hand. With a great effort I resisted the madness that incited
me to hurl myself upon the flask. I hung back with all my power.
A convulsive spasm contracted my throat. I turned about and fled
out of the passage.</p>

<p>I ran to Seraphina. "Put out your hand to me," I panted in the
darkness. "I need your help."</p>

<p>I felt it resting lightly on my bowed head. She did not even
ask me what I meant; as if the greatness of her soul was omniscient.
There was, in that silence, a supreme unselfishness, the unquestioning
devotion of a woman.</p>

<p>"Patience, patience," I kept on muttering. I was losing confidence
in myself. If only I had been free to dash my head against the
rock. I had the courage for that, yet. But this was a situation
from which there was no issue in death.</p>

<p>"We are saved," I murmured distractedly.</p>

<p>"Patience," she breathed out. Her hand slipped languidly off
my head.</p>

<p>And I began to creep away from her side. I am here to tell the
truth. I began to creep away towards the flask. I did not confess
this to myself; but I know now. There was a devilish power in
it. I have learned the nature of feelings in a man whom Satan
beguiles into selling his soul&mdash;the horror of an irresistible
and fatal longing for a supreme felicity. And in a drink of water
for me, then, there was a greater promise than in universal knowledge,
in unbounded power, in unlimited wealth, in imperishable youth.
What could have been these seductions to a drink? No soul had
thirsted after things unlawful as my parched throat thirsted for
water. No devil had ever tempted a man with such a bribe of perdition.</p>

<p>I suffered from the lucidity of my feelings. I saw, with indignation,
my own wretched self being angled for like a fish. And with all
that, in my forlorn state, I remained prudent. I did not rush
out blindly. No. I approached the inner end of the passage, as
though I had been stalking a wild creature, slowly, from the side.
I crept along the wall of the cavern, and protruded my head far
enough to look at the fiendish temptation.</p>

<p>There it was, a small dark object suspended in the light, with
the yellow rock across the ravine for a background. The silver
top shivered the sunbeams brilliantly. I had half hopes they had
taken it away by this time. When I drew my head back I lost sight
of it, but all my being went out to it with an almost pitiful
longing. I remembered Castro for the first time in many hours.
Was I nothing better than Castro? He had been angled for with
salted meat. I shuddered. A darkness fell into the passage. I
put down my uplifted foot without advancing. The unexpectedness
of that shadow saved me, I believe. Manuel had descended the cornice.</p>

<p>He was alone. Standing before the outer opening, he darkened
the passage, through which his talk to the people above came loudly
into my ears. They could see now if he were not a worthy <em>Capataz</em>.
If the <em>Inglez</em> was in there he was a corpse. And yet,
of these living hearts above, of these <em>valientes</em> of Rio
Medio, there was not one who would go alone to look upon a dead
body. He had contrived an infallible test, and yet they would
not believe him. Well, his valiance should prove it; his valiance,
afraid neither of light nor of darkness.</p>

<p>I could not hear the answers he got from up there; but the vague
sounds that reached me carried the usual commingling of derision
and applause, the resentment of their jeers at the admiration
he knew how to extort by the display of his talents.</p>

<p>They must kill the cattle, these <em>caballeros</em>. He scolded
ironically. Of course. They must feed on meat like lions; but
their souls were like the souls of hens born on dunghills. And
behold! there was he, Manuel, not afraid of shadows.</p>

<p>He was coming in, there could be no doubt. Out there in the full
light, he could not possibly have detected that rapid appearance
of my head darted forward and withdrawn at once; but I had a view
of his arm putting aside the swinging flask, of his leg raised
to step over the high sill. I saw him, and I ran noiselessly away
from the opening.</p>

<p>I had the time to charge Seraphina not to move, on our lives&mdash;on
the wretched remnant of our lives&mdash;when his black shape stood
in the frame of the opening, edged with a thread of light following
the contour of his hat, of his shoulders, of his whole body down
to his feet&mdash;whence a long shadow fell upon the pool of twilight
on the floor.</p>

<p>What had made him come down? Vanity? The exacting demands of
his leadership? Fear of O'Brien? The <em>Juez</em> would expect
to hear something definite, and his band pretended not to believe
in the stratagem of the bottle. I think that, for his part, from
his knowledge of human nature, he never doubted its efficacy.
He could not guess how very little, only, he was wrong. How very
little! And yet he seemed rooted in incertitude on the threshold.
His head turned from side to side. I could not make out his face
as he stood, but the slightest of his movements did not escape
me. He stepped aside, letting in all the fullness of the light.</p>

<p>Would he have the courage to explore at least the immediate neighbourhood
of the opening? Who could tell his complex motives? Who could
tell his purpose or his fears? He had killed a man in there once.
But, then, he had not been alone. If he were only showing off
before his unruly band, he need not stir a step further. He did
not advance. He leaned his shoulders against the rock just clear
of the opening. One half of him was lighted plainly; his long
profile, part of his raven locks, one listless hand, his crossed
legs, the buckle of one shoe.</p>

<p>"Nobody," he pronounced slowly, in a dead whisper.</p>

<p>While I looked at him, the profound <em>politico</em>, the artist,
the everlastingly questioned <em>Capataz</em>, the man of talent
and ability, he thought himself alone, and allowed his head to
drop on his breast, as if saddened by the vanity of human ambition.
Then, lifting it with a jerk, he listened with one ear turned
to the passage; afterwards he peered into the cavern. Two long
strides, over the cold heap of ashes, brought him to the stone
seat.</p>

<p>It was very plain to me from his starting movements and attitudes,
that he shared his uneasy attention between the inside and the
outside of the cave. He sat down, but seemed ready to jump up;
and I saw him turn his eyes upwards to the dark vault, as if on
the alert for a noise from above. I am inclined to think he was
expecting to hear the galloping hoofs of the peons' horses every
moment. I think he did. The words "I am safer here than they above,"
were perfectly audible to me in the mumbling he kept up nervously.
He wished to hear the sound of his own voice, as a timid person
whistles and talks on a lonely road at night. Only the year before
he had killed a man in that cavern, under circumstances that were,
I believe, revolting even to the honour of these bandits. He sat
there between the shadow of his murder and the reality of the
vengeance. I asked myself what could be the outcome of a struggle
with him. He was armed; he was not weakened by hunger; but he
stood between us and the water. My thirst would give me strength;
the desire to end Seraphina's sufferings would make me invincible.
On the other hand, it was dangerous to interfere. I could not
tell whether they would not try to find out what became of him.
It was safest to let him go. It was extremely improbable that
they would sail without him.</p>

<p>I am not conscious of having stirred a limb; neither had Seraphina
moved, I am ready to swear; but plainly something, some sort of
sound, startled him. He bounded out of his seated immobility,
and in one leap had his shoulders against the rock standing at
bay before the darkness, with his knife in his hand. I wonder
he did not surprise me into an exclamation. I was as startled
as himself. His teeth and the whites of his eyes gleamed straight
at me from afar; he hissed with fear; for an instant I was firmly
convinced he had seen me. All this took place so quickly that
I had no time to make one movement towards receiving his attack,
when I saw him make a great sign of the cross in the air with
the point of his dagger.</p>

<p>He sheathed it slowly, and sidled along the few feet to the entrance,
his shoulders rubbing the wall. He blocked out the light, and
in a moment had backed out of sight.</p>

<p>Before he got to the further end I was already, at the inner,
creeping after him. I had started at once, as if his disappearance
had removed a spell, as though he had drawn me after him by an
invisible bond. Raising myself on my forearms I saw him, from
his knees up, standing outside the sill, with his back to the
precipice and his face turned up.</p>

<p>"There is nobody in there," he shouted.</p>

<p>I sank down and wriggled forward on my stomach, raising myself
on my elbows, now and then, to look. Manuel was looking upwards
conversing with the people above, and holding Williams' flask
in both his hands. He never once glanced into the passage; he
seemed to be trying to undo the cord knotted to the end of the
thick rope, which hung in a long bight before him. The flask captured
my eyes, my thought, my energy. I would tear it away from him
directly. There was in me, then, neither fear nor intelligence;
only the desire of possessing myself of the thing; but an instinctive
caution prevented my rushing out violently. I proceeded with an
animal-like stealthiness, with which cool reason had nothing to
do.</p>

<p>He had some difficulty with the knot, and evidently did not wish
to cut the green silk cord. How well I remember his fumbling fingers.
He sat down sideways on the sill, with his legs outside, of course,
his face and hands turned to the light, very absorbed in his endeavour.
They shouted to him from above.</p>

<p>"I come at once," he cried to them, without lifting his head.</p>

<p>I had crept up almost near enough to grab the flask. It never
occurred to me that by flinging myself on him, I could have pushed
him off the sill. My only idea was to get hold. He did not exist
for me. The leather-covered bottle was the only real thing in
the world. I was completely insane. I heard a faint detonation,
and Manuel got up quickly from the sill. The flask was out of
my reach.</p>

<p>There were more popping sounds of shots fired, away on the plain.
The peons were attacking an outpost of the <em>Lugareños</em>.
A deep voice cried, "They are driving them in." Then several together
yelled:</p>

<p>"Come away, Manuel. Come away. <em>Por Dios....</em>"</p>

<p>Stretched at full length in the passage, and sustaining myself
on my trembling arms, I gazed up at him. He stood very rigid,
holding the flask in both hands. Several muskets were discharged
together just above, and in the noise of the reports I remember
a voice crying urgently over the edge, "Manuel! Manuel!" The shadow
of irresolution passed over his features. He hesitated whether
to run up the ledge or bolt into the cave. He shouted something.
He was not answered, but the yelling and the firing ceased suddenly,
as if the <em>Lugareños</em> had given up and taken to their heels.
I became aware of a sort of increasing throbbing sound that seemed
to come from behind me, out of the cave; then, as Manuel lifted
his foot hastily to step over the sill, I jumped up deliriously,
and with outstretched hands lurched forward at the flask in his
fingers.</p>

<p>I believe I laughed at him in an imbecile manner.</p>

<p>Somebody laughed; and I remember the superior smile on his face
passing into a ghastly grin, that disappeared slowly, while his
astonished eyes, glaring at that gaunt and dishevelled apparition
rising before him in the dusk of the passage, seemed to grow to
an enormous size. He drew back his foot, as though it had been
burnt; and in a panic-stricken impulse, he flung the flask straight
into my face, and staggered away from the sill.</p>

<p>I made a catch at it with a scream of triumph, whose unearthly
sound brought me back to my senses.</p>

<p>"In the name of God, retire," he cried, as though I had been
an apparition from another world.</p>

<p>What took place afterwards happened with an inconceivable rapidity,
in less time than it takes to draw breath. He never recognized
me. I saw his glare of incredulous awe change, suddenly, to horror
and despair. He had felt himself losing his balance.</p>

<p>He had stepped too far back. He tried to recover himself, but
it was too late. He hung for a moment in his backward fall; his
arms beat the air, his body curled upon itself with an awful striving.
All at once he went limp all over, and, with the sunlight full
upon his upturned face, vanished downwards from my sight.</p>

<p>But at the last moment he managed to clutch the bight of the
hanging rope. The end of it must have been lying quite loose on
the ground above, for I saw its whole length go whizzing after
him, in the twinkling of an eye. I pressed the flask fiercely
to my breast, raging with the thought that he could yet tear it
out of my hands; but by the time the strain came, his falling
body had acquired such a velocity that I didn't feel the slightest
jerk when the green cord snapped&mdash;no more than if it had been
the thread of a cobweb.</p>

<p>I confess that tears, tears of gratitude, were running down my
face. My limbs trembled. But I was sane enough not to think of
myself any more.</p>

<p>"Drink! Drink," I stammered, raising Seraphina's head on my shoulder,
while the galloping horses of the peons in hot pursuit passed
with a thundering rumble above us. Then all was still.</p>

<p>Our getting out of the cave was a matter of unremitting toil,
through what might have been a year of time; the recollection
is of an arduous undertaking, accomplished without the usual incentives
of men's activity. Necessity, alone, remained; the iron necessity
without the glamour of freedom of choice, of pride.</p>

<p>Our unsteady feet crushed, at last, the black embers of the fires
scattered by the hoofs of horses; and the plain appeared immense
to our weakness, swept of shadows by the high sun, lonely and
desolate as the sea. We looked at the litter of the _Lugareños'
_camp, rags on the trodden grass, a couple of abandoned blankets,
a musket thrown away in the panic, a dirty red sash lying on a
heap of sticks, a wooden bucket from the schooner, smashed water-gourds.
One of them remained miraculously poised on its round bottom and
full to the brim, while everything else seemed to have been overturned,
torn, scattered haphazard by a furious gust of wind. A scaffolding
of poles, for drying strips of meat, had been knocked over; I
found nothing there except bits of hairy hide; but lumps of scorched
flesh adhered to the white bones scattered amongst the ashes of
the camp&mdash;and I thanked God for them.</p>

<p>We averted our eyes from our faces in very love, and we did not
speak from pity for each other. There was no joy in our escape,
no relief, no sense of freedom. The <em>Lugareños</em> and the
peons, the pursued and the pursuers, had disappeared from the
upland without leaving as much as a corpse in view. There were
no moving things on the earth, no bird soared in the pellucid
air, not even a moving cloud on the sky. The sun declined, and
the rolling expanse of the plain frightened us, as if space had
been something alive and hostile.</p>

<p>We walked away from that spot, as if our feet had been shod in
lead; and we hugged the edge of the cruel ravine, as one keeps
by the side of a friend. We must have been grotesque, pathetic,
and lonely; like two people newly arisen from a tomb, shrinking
before the strangeness of the half-forgotten face of the world.
And at the head of the ravine we stopped.</p>

<p>The sensation of light, vastness, and solitude, rolled upon our
souls emerging from the darkness, overwhelmingly, like a wave
of the sea. We might have been an only couple sent back from the
underworld to begin another cycle of pain on a depopulated earth.
It had not for us even the fitful caress of a breeze; and the
only sound of greeting was the angry babble of the brook dashing
down the stony slope at our feet.</p>

<p>We knelt over it to drink deeply and bathe our faces. Then looking
about helplessly, I discovered afar the belt of the sea inclosed
between the undulating lines of the dunes and the straight edge
of the horizon. I pointed my arm at the white sails of the schooner
creeping from under the land, and Seraphina, resting her head
on my shoulder, shuddered.</p>

<p>"Let us go away from here."</p>

<p>Our necessity pointed down the slope. We could not think of another
way, and the extent of the plain with its boundary of forests
filled us with the dread of things unknown. But, by getting down
to the inlet of the sea, and following the bank of the little
river, we were sure to reach the <em>hacienda</em>, if only a
hope could buoy our sinking hearts long enough.</p>

<p>From our first step downwards the hard, rattling noise of the
stones accompanied our descent, growing in volume, bewildering
our minds. We had missed the indistinct beginning of the trail
on the side of the ravine, and had to follow the course of the
stream. A growth of wiry bushes sprang thickly between the large
fragments of fallen rocks. On our right the shadows were beginning
to steal into the chasm. Towering on our left the great stratified
wall caught at the top of the glow of the low sun in a rich, tawny
tint, right under the dark blue strip of sky, that seemed to reflect
the gloom of the ravine, the sepulchral arid gloom of deep shadows
and gray rocks, through which the shallow torrent dashed violently
with glassy gleams between the sombre masses of vegetation.</p>

<p>We pushed on through the bunches of tough twigs; the massive
boulders closed the view on every side; and Seraphina followed
me with her hands on my shoulders. This was the best way in which
I could help her descent till the declivity became less steep;
and then I went ahead, forcing a path for her. Often we had to
walk into the bed of the stream. It was icy cold. Some strange
beast, perhaps a bird, invisible somewhere, emitted from time
to time a faint and lamentable shriek. It was a wild scene, and
the orifice of the cave appeared as an inaccessible black hole
some ninety feet above our heads.</p>

<p>Then, as I stepped round a large fragment of rock, my eyes fell
on Manuel's body.</p>

<p>Seraphina was behind me. With a wave of my hand I arrested her.
It had not occurred to me before that, following the bottom of
the ravine, we must come upon the two bodies. Castro's was lower
down, of course. I would have spared her the sight, but there
was no retracing our steps. We had no strength and no time. Manuel
was lying on his back with his hands under him, and his feet nearly
in the brook.</p>

<p>The lower portion of the rope made a heap of cordage on the ground
near him, but a great length of it hung perpendicularly above
his head. The loose end he had snatched over the edge of his fall
had whipped itself tight round the stem of a dwarf tree growing
in a crevice high up the rock; and as he fell below, the jerk
must have checked his descent, and had prevented him from alighting
on his head. There was not a sign of blood anywhere upon him or
on the stones. His eyes were shut. He might have lain down to
sleep there, in our way; only from the slightly unnatural twist
in the position of his arms and legs, I saw, at a glance, that
all his limbs were broken.</p>

<p>On the other side of the boulder Seraphina called to me, and
I could not answer her, so great was the shock I received in seeing
the flutter of his slowly opening eyelids.</p>

<p>He still lived, then! He looked at me! It was an awful discovery
to make, and the contrast of his anxious and feverish stare with
the collapsed posture of his body was full of intolerable suggestions
of fate blundering unlawfully, of death itself being conquered
by pain. I looked away only to perceive something pitiless, belittling,
and cruel in the precipitous immobility of the sheer walls, in
the dark funereal green of the foliage, in the falling shadows,
in the remoteness of the sky.</p>

<p>The unconsciousness of matter hinted at a weird and mysterious
antagonism. All the inanimate things seemed to have conspired
to throw in our way this man just enough alive to feel pain. The
faint and lamentable sounds we had heard must have come from him.
He was looking at me. It was impossible to say whether he saw
anything at all. He barred our road with his remnant of life;
but, when suddenly he spoke, my heart stood still for a moment
in my motionless body.</p>

<p>"You, too!" he droned awfully. "Behold! I have been precipitated,
alive, into this hell by another ghost. Nothing else could have
overcome the greatness of my spirit."</p>

<p>His red shirt was torn open at the throat. His bared breast began
to heave. He cried out with pain. Ready to fly from him myself,
I shouted to Seraphina to keep away.</p>

<p>But it was too late. Imagining I had seen some new danger in
our path, she had advanced to stand by my side.</p>

<p>"He is dying," I muttered in distraction. "We can do nothing."</p>

<p>But could we pass him by before he died? "This is terrible,"
said Seraphina.</p>

<p>My real hope had been that, after driving the <em>Lugareños</em>
away, the peons would off-saddle near the little river to rest
themselves and their horses. This is why I had almost pitilessly
hurried Seraphina, after we had left the cave, down the steep
but short descent of the ravine. I had kept to myself my despairing
conviction that we could never reach the <em>hacienda</em> unaided,
even if we had known the way. I had pretended confidence in ourselves,
but all my trust was in the assistance I expected to get from
these men. I understood so well the slenderness of that hope that
I had not dared to mention it to her and to propose she should
wait for me on the upland, while I went down by myself on that
quest. I could not bear the fear of returning unsuccessful only
to find her dead. That is, if I had the strength to return after
such a disappointment.</p>

<p>And the idea of her, waiting for me in vain, then wandering off,
perhaps to fall under a bush and die alone, was too appalling
to contemplate. That we must keep together, at all costs, was
like a point of honour, like an article of faith with us&mdash;confirmed
by what we had gone through already. It was like a law of existence,
like a creed, like a defence which, once broken, would let despair
upon our heads. I am sure she would not have consented to even
a temporary separation. She had a sort of superstitious feeling
that, should we be forced apart, even to the manifest saving of
our lives, we would lay ourselves open to some calamity worse
than mere death could be.</p>

<p>I loved her enough to share that feeling, but with the addition
of a man's half-unconscious selfishness. I needed her indomitable
frailness to prop my grosser strength. I needed that something
not wholly of this world, which women's more exalted nature infuses
into their passions, into their sorrows, into their joys; as if
their adventurous souls had the power to range beyond the orbit
of the earth for the gathering of their love, their hate&mdash;and
their charity.</p>

<p>"He calls for death," she said, shrinking with horror and pity
before the mutters of the miserable man at our feet. Every moment
of daylight was of the utmost importance, if we were to save our
freedom, our happiness, our very lives; and we remained rooted
to the spot. For it seemed as though, at last, he had attained
the end of his enterprise. He had captured us, as if by a very
cruel stratagem.</p>

<p>A drowsiness would come at times over those big open eyes, like
a film through which a blazing glance would break out now and
then. He had recognized us perfectly; but, for the most part,
we seemed to him to be the haunting ghosts of his inferno.</p>

<p>"You came from heaven," he raved feebly, rolling his straining
eyes towards Seraphina. His internal injuries must have been frightful.
Perhaps he dared not shift his head&mdash;the only movement that was
in his power. "I reached up to the very angels in the inspiration
of my song,"  he droned, "and would be called a demon on earth.
<em>Manuel el Demonio</em>. And now precipitated alive.... Nothing
less. There is a greatness in me. Let some dew fall upon my lips."</p>

<p>He moaned from the very bottom of his heart. His teeth chattered.</p>

<p>"The blessed may not know anything of the cold and thirst of
this place. A drop of dew&mdash;as on earth you used to throw alms
to the poor from your coach&mdash;for the love of God."</p>

<p>She sank on the stones nearer to him than I would willingly have
done, brave as a woman, only, can be before the atrocious depths
of human misery. I leaned my shoulders against the boulder and
crossed my arms on my breast, as if giving up an unequal struggle.
Her hair was loose, her dress stained with ashes, torn by brambles;
the darkness of the cavern seemed to linger in her hollow cheeks,
in her sunken temples.</p>

<p>"He is thirsty," she murmured to me.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said.</p>

<p>She tore off a strip of her dress, dipped it in the running water
at her side, and approached it, all dripping, to his lips which
closed upon it with avidity. The walls of the rock looked on implacably,
but the rushing stream seemed to hurry away, as if from an accursed
spot.</p>

<p>"Dew from heaven," he sighed out.</p>

<p>"You are on earth, Manuel," she said. "You are given time to
repent. This is earth."</p>

<p>"Impossible," he muttered with difficulty.</p>

<p>He had forced his human fellowship upon us, this man whose ambition
it had been to be called demon on the earth. He held us by the
humanity of his broken frame, by his human glance, by his human
voice. I wonder if, had I been alone, I would have passed on as
reason dictated, or have had the courage of pity and finished
him off, as he demanded. Whenever he became aware of our presence,
he addressed me as "Thou, English ghost,"  and directed me, in
a commanding voice, to take a stone and crush his head, before
I went back to my own torments. I withdrew, at last, where he
could not see me; but Seraphina never flinched in her task of
moistening his lips with the strip of cloth she dipped in the
brook, time after time, with a sublime perseverance of compassion.</p>

<p>It made me silent. Could I have stood there and recited the sinister
detail of that man's crimes, in the hope that she would recoil
from him to pursue the road of safety? It was not his evil, but
his suffering that confronted us now. The sense of our kinship
emerged out of it like a fresh horror after we had escaped the
sea, the tempest; after we had resisted untold fatigues, hunger,
thirst, despair. We were vanquished by what was in us, not in
him. I could say nothing. The light ebbed out of the ravine. The
sky, like a thin blue veil stretched between the earth and the
spaces of the universe, filtered the gloom of the darkness beyond.</p>

<p>I thought of the invisible sun ready to set into the sea, of
the peons riding away, and of our helpless, hopeless state.</p>

<p>"For the love of God," he mumbled.</p>

<p>"Yes, for the love of God," I heard her expressionless voice
repeat. And then there was only the greedy sound of his lips sucking
at the cloth, and the impatient ripple of the stream.</p>

<p>"Come, death," he sighed.</p>

<p>Yes, come, I thought, to release him and to set us free. All
my prayer, now, was that we should be granted the strength to
struggle from under the malignant frown of these crags, to close
our eyes forever in the open.</p>

<p>And the truth is that, had we gone on, we should have found no
one by the sea. The routed <em>Lugareños</em> had been able to
embark under cover of a fusillade from those on board the schooner.
All that would have met our despair, at the end of our toilsome
march, would have been three dead pirates lying on the sand. The
main body of the peons had gone, already, up the valley of the
river with their few wounded. There would have been nothing for
us to do but to stumble on and on upon their track, till we lay
down never to rise again. They did not draw rein once, between
the sea and the <em>hacienda</em>, sixteen miles away.</p>

<p>About the time when we began our descent into the ravine, two
of the peons, detached from the main body for the purpose of observing
the schooner from the upland, had topped the edge of the plain.
We had then penetrated into Manuel's inferno, too deep to be seen
by them. These men spent some time lying on the grass, and watching
over the dunes the course of the schooner on the open sea. Their
horses were grazing near them. The wind was light; they waited
to see the vessel far enough down the coast to make any intention
of return improbable.</p>

<p>It was Manuel who saved our lives, defeating his own aim to the
bitter end. Had not his vanity, policy, or the necessity of his
artistic soul, induced him to enter the cave; had not his cowardice
prevented him joining the <em>Lugareños</em> above, at the moment
of the attack; had he not recoiled violently in a superstitious
fear before my apparition at the mouth of the cave&mdash;we should
have been released from our entombment, only to look once more
at the sun. He paid the price of our ransom, to the uttermost
farthing, in his lingering death. Had he killed himself on the
spot, he would have taken our only slender chance with him into
that nether world where he imagined himself to have been "precipitated
alive." Finding him dead, we should have gone on. Less than ten
minutes, no more than another ten paces beyond the spot, we should
have been hidden from sight in the thickets of denser growth in
the lower part of the ravine. I doubt whether we should have been
able to get through; but, even so, we should have been going away
from the only help within our reach. We should have been lost.</p>

<p>The two <em>vaqueros</em>, after seeing the schooner hull down
under the low, fiery sun of the west, mounted and rode home over
the plain, making for the head of the ravine, as their way lay.
And, as they cantered along the side opposite to the cave, one
of them caught sight of the length of rope dangling down the precipice.
They pulled up at once.</p>

<p>The first I knew of their nearness was the snorting of a horse
forced towards the edge of the chasm. I saw the animal's forelegs
planted tensely on the very brink, and the body of the rider leaning
over his neck to look down. And, when I wished to shout, I found
I could not produce the slightest sound.</p>

<p>The man, rising in his stirrups, the reins in one hand and turning
up the brim of his sombrero with the other, peered down at us
over the pricked ears of his horse. I pointed over my head at
the mouth of the cave, then down at Seraphina, lifting my hands
to show that I was unarmed. I opened my lips wide. Surprise, agitation,
weakness, had robbed me of every vestige of my voice. I beckoned
downwards with a desperate energy, Horse and rider remained perfectly
still, like an equestrian statue set up on the edge of a precipice.
Sera-phina had never raised her head.</p>

<p>The man's intent scrutiny could not have mistaken me for a <em>Lugareno</em>.
I think he gazed so long because he was amazed to discover down
there a woman on her knees, stooping over a prostrate body, and
a bareheaded man in a ragged white shirt and black breeches, reeling
between the bushes and gesticulating violently, like an excited
mute. But how a rope came to hang down from a tree, growing in
a position so inaccessible that only a bird could have attached
it there struck him as the most mysterious thing of all. He pointed
his finger at it interrogatively, and I answered this inquiring
sign by indicating the stony slope of the ravine. It seemed as
if he could not speak for wonder. After a while he sat back in
his saddle, gave me an encouraging wave of the hand, and wheeled
his horse away from the brink.</p>

<p>It was as if we had been casting a spell of extinction on each
other's voices. No sooner had he disappeared than I found mine.
I do not suppose it was very loud but, at my aimless screech,
Seraphina looked upwards on every side, saw no one anywhere, and
remained on her knees with her eyes, full of apprehension, fixed
upon me.</p>

<p>"No! I am not mad, dearest," I said. "There was a man. He has
seen us."</p>

<p>"Oh, Juan!" she faltered out, "pray with me that God may have
mercy on this poor wretch and let him die."</p>

<p>I said nothing. My thin, quavering scream after the peon had
awakened Manuel from his delirious dream of an inferno. The voice
that issued from his shattered body was awfully measured, hollow,
and profound.</p>

<p>"You live!" he uttered slowly, turning his eyes full upon my
face, and, as if perceiving for the first time in me the appearance
of a living man. "Ha! You English walk the earth unscathed."</p>

<p>A feeling of pity came to me&mdash;a pity distinct from the harrowing
sensations of his miserable end. He had been evil in the obscurity
of his life, as there are plants growing harmful and deadly in
the shade, drawing poison from the dank soil on which they flourish.
He was as unconscious of his evil as they&mdash;but he had a man's
right to my pity.</p>

<p>"I am b&mdash;roken," he stammered out.</p>

<p>Seraphina kept on moistening his lips.</p>

<p>"Repent, Manuel," she entreated fervently. "We have forgiven
thee the evil done to us. Repent of thy crimes&mdash;poor man."</p>

<p>"Your voice, Señorita. What? You! You yourself bringing this
blessing to my lips! In your childhood I cried '<em>viva</em>'
many times before your coach. And now you deign&mdash;in your voice&mdash;with
your hand. Ha! I could improvise &mdash;The star stoops to the
crushed worm...."</p>

<p>A rising clatter of rolling stones mingled from afar with the
broken moanings of his voice. Looking over my shoulder, I saw
one peon beginning the descent of the slope, and, higher up, motionless
between the heads of two horses, the head of another man&mdash;with
the purple tint of an enlarged sky beyond, reflecting the glow
of an invisible sun setting into the sea.</p>

<p>Manuel cried out piercingly, and we shuddered. Seraphina shrank
close to my side, hiding her head on my breast. The peon staggered
awkwardly down the slope, descending sideways in small steps,
embarrassed by the enormous rowels of his spurs. He had a striped
<em>serape</em> over his shoulder, and grasped a broad-bladed
<em>machete</em> in his right hand. His stumbling, cautious feet
sent into the ravine a crashing sound, as though we were to be
buried under a stream of stones.</p>

<p>"<em>Vuestra Señoria</em>" gasped Manuel. "I shall be silent.
Pity me! Do not&mdash;do not withdraw your hand from my extreme pain."</p>

<p>I felt she had to summon all her courage to look at him again.
She disengaged herself, resolutely, from my enfolding arms.</p>

<p>"No, no; unfortunate man," she said, in a benumbed voice. "Think
of thy end."</p>

<p>"A crushed worm, senorita," he mumbled.</p>

<p>The peon, having reached the bottom of the slope, became lost
to view amongst the bushes and the great fragments of rocks below.
Every sound in the ravine was hushed; and the darkening sky seemed
to cast the shadow of an everlasting night into the eyes of the
dying man.</p>

<p>Then the peon came out, pushing through, in a great swish of
parted bushes. His spurs jingled at every step, his footfalls
crunched heavily on the pebbles. He stopped, as if transfixed,
muttering his astonishment to himself, but asking no questions.
He was a young man with a thin black moustache twisted gallantly
to two little points. He looked up at the sheer wall of the precipice;
he looked down at the group we formed at his feet. Suddenly, as
if returning from an abyss of pain, Manuel declared distinctly:</p>

<p>"I feel in me a greatness, an inspiration...."</p>

<p>These were his last words. The heavy dark lashes descended slowly
upon the faint gleam of the eyeballs, like a lowered curtain.
The deep folds of the ravine gathered the falling dusk into great
pools of absolute blackness, at the foot of the crags.</p>

<p>Rising high above our littleness, that watched, fascinated, the
struggle of lights and shadows over the soul entangled in the
wreck of a man's body, the rocks had a monumental indifference.
And between their great, stony faces, turning pale in the gloom,
with the amazed peon as if standing guard, <em>machete</em> in
hand, Manuel's greatness and his inspiration passed away without
as much as an exhaled sigh. I did not even know that he had ceased
to breathe, till Seraphina rose from her knees with a low cry,
and flung far away from her, nervously, the strip of cloth upon
which his parted lips had refused to close.</p>

<p>My arms were ready to receive her. "Ah! At last!" she cried.
There was something resentful and fierce in that cry, as though
the pity of her woman's heart had been put to too cruel a test.</p>

<p>I, too, had been humane to that man. I had had his life on the
end of my pistol, and had spared him from an impulse that had
done nothing but withhold from him the mercy of a speedy death.
This had been my pity.</p>

<p>But it was Seraphina's cry&mdash;this "At last," showing the stress
and pain of the ordeal&mdash;that shook my faith in my conduct. It
had brought upon our heads a retribution of mental and bodily
anguish, like a criminal weakness. I was young, and my belief
in the justice of life had received a shock. If it were impossible
to foretell the consequences of our acts, if there were no safety
in the motives within ourselves, what remained for our guidance?</p>

<p>And the inscrutable immobility of towering forms, steeped in
the shadows of the chasm, appeared pregnant with a dreadful wisdom.
It seemed to me that I would never have the courage to lift my
hand, open my lips, make a step, obey a thought. A long sun-ray
shot to the zenith from the beclouded west, crossing obliquely
in a faint red bar the purple band of sky above the ravine.</p>

<p>The young <em>vaquero</em> had taken off his hat before the might
of death, and made a perfunctory sign of the cross. He looked
up and down the lofty wall, as if it could give him the word of
that riddle. Twice his spurs clashed softly, and, with one hand
grasping the rope, he stooped low in the twilight over the body.</p>

<p>"We looked for this <em>Lugareño</em>," he said, replacing his
hat on his head carelessly. "He was a mad singer, and I saw him
once kill one of us very swiftly. They used to call him in jest,
<em>El Demonio</em>. Ah! But you... But you...."</p>

<p>His wonder overcame him. His bewildered eyes glimmered, staring
at us in the deepening dusk.</p>

<p>"Speak, <em>hombre</em>," he cried. "Who are you and who is she?
Whence came you? Where are you going with this woman?..."</p>
