<p><em>THEY </em>thought of many ways to get him to do it, but none
of such ingenuity as to inspire them with confidence. Mrs. Oliphant
made more suggestions than her husband did, and she put most of
them into the form of little dramatic dialogues imagined as taking
place between Mr. Oliphant and Harlan. Mr. Oliphant was to say
such-and-such things to Harlan, who would necessarily reply in
certain terms, which she sketched;—whereupon his father could
triumphantly turn the words just uttered into proof that Harlan
would not only be doing his duty by helping Dan, but at the same
time would make great headway with Martha Shelby in a straightforward
manner involving not the slightest pose.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after each of these small dramas in turn, becoming
eager in her opinion that "<em>this</em> time" she had "got it,"
she was forced into pessimism by Mr. Oliphant’s pointing out that
Harlan wouldn’t say what she had sketched for him; but, on the
contrary, was certain to express himself to an effect precisely
the opposite.</p>

<p>Many times that afternoon the poor lady murmured, "No, I suppose
perhaps it wouldn’t do after all," and pondered again. "But why
don’t you think of a way that <em>would</em> do?" she asked, with
more spirit, after one of her failures. "You’re a lawyer; you
ought to be able to think of <em>something</em>."</p>

<p>He laughed and made the gesture of a man helpless between opposing
viewpoints of his own. "What provokes me is that I can’t help
seeing Harlan’s side of it, too. There’s a good deal to be said
on his side, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," she readily assented. "He thinks he’s perfectly
right; but of course he isn’t."</p>

<p>"Well, why isn’t he? After all, your mother trusted him to do
just what we’re planning to get him not to do."</p>

<p>"But her will doesn’t <em>say</em> he can’t help Dan. So why
shouldn’t he?"</p>

<p>"No," Mr. Oliphant interrupted; "it doesn’t say he mustn’t; but
that’s what she counted on. In our hearts we’re blaming him for
not betraying a trust, and for being unwilling to put money into
the fire;—he honestly believes it would be putting it into the
fire. And he won’t do it, even though he knows his refusing makes
him look mean in the eyes of pretty much everybody he cares about,
even in the eyes of the person he seems to care most about. Well,
there’s something rather fine in a stand like that, after all."</p>

<p>"Martha’d never forgive him!" Mrs. Oliphant said emphatically.
"Never! If he doesn’t help Dan, now that he’s got so <em>much</em>,
she’d always believe him terribly stingy. So you see we ought
to persuade him for his own good, too—if we could only think of
a way."</p>

<p>But they continued to find that elusive way beset by baffling
afterthoughts; and when Dan came home from his excursion, successful
and in high fettle, they spoke to him of the subject that had
been engrossing them—and were straightway baffled again. Dan even
declined the proffer of future assistance from his mother.</p>

<p>"Not a penny!" he said. "She didn’t have any faith in me, and
she despised the whole idea of Ornaby. She gave me thirty-five
hundred dollars of my own—bless her for it! She gave me that to
do with as I please, and it’s plenty. Why, to-morrow I’m goin’
to fix up the interest on what’s owed on the land, and then I’ve
got to settle another little matter, and after that I——"</p>

<p>"Wait, Dan," his father interposed. "What other little matter
is it you have to settle? I didn’t know anything had been worrying
you except the probable foreclosure."</p>

<p>"It didn’t, sir. I didn’t worry about this at all. I knew I could
fix <em>it</em> all right, if I could just hold off the foreclosure.
It seems I’ve never paid any of the taxes on the Addition—I’ve
had so many other things on my mind, it seems I just kind of neglected
that—and so somebody’s got a tax title to it; but now I can settle
with him to-morrow morning and clear it off—and then I’m goin’
to turn up some sod out there! I’m goin’ to get ready to lay the
foundation for my first factory!"</p>

<p>"But the <em>money</em>, dear!" his mother cried. "How in the
world do you expect even to lay the foundations unless we can
get Harlan——"</p>

<p>"No, ma’am! I wouldn’t take a nickel of it if he begged me to!
I’ve been pretty near where I was ready to steal to get money
to pull me out of a hole; but I’ll never take one single cent
of what grandma left Harlan, or of what she left you either. If
she’d meant me to have it she’d have given it to me herself; but
she didn’t have any faith in me, and she says so in plain words
in her will. You don’t expect me to take help from her that she
wanted to <em>prevent</em>, do you? Never in this world!"</p>

<p>"There! You see?" Mrs. Oliphant lamented, appealing to her husband.
"I knew it hurt him, in spite of what he said. I knew it!"</p>

<p>"You’re all wrong," Dan stoutly maintained. "She kind of explained
to me what she was goin’ to do, though I didn’t see what she meant.
It was just a few minutes before she died. She told me to remember
not to be hurt, but she needn’t have worried about it, and I told
her so. So don’t <em>you</em> worry about it. I didn’t begin to
build Ornaby on my expectations from her; I’ve carried it along
this far by myself, and I expect to carry it the rest of the way.
And I’m goin’ to build that factory! George McMillan thinks maybe
he can float some of the stock for it in New York, and I don’t
know but he’s got a little money of his own he may want to put
in. The way I feel, why, it looks to me as if I was about ready
to climb out on the top o’ the heap right now; and I’m certainly
not baby enough to be hurt because my grandmother didn’t have
any faith in me."</p>

<p>He continued to protest and perhaps protested too much; for although
it was clear enough to his parents that he was so heartened by
his thirty-five hundred dollars as to anticipate miracles, yet
it was not to be believed that his pride had suffered no injury
at all. What appeared in his grandmother’s will as a severe criticism
of his ability and judgment was more than a mere neutral lack
of faith; and Mrs. Oliphant’s intuition had touched the truth;
he was indeed hurt—but he never admitted it.</p>

<p>Moreover, he remained steadfast in refusal; he would neither
allow his mother to help him with money nor countenance any appeal
of hers, or his father’s, to Harlan. Both of them, uncountenanced,
did with faint hope reopen the subject to Harlan, though they
did it indirectly;—they made allusions to the pathos of the brave
and independent position his brother had taken. But Harlan only
looked slightly badgered, and replied that this extolled position
of Dan’s was the only possible correct one under the circumstances.</p>

<p>From time to time the troubled parents tried other diplomacies
of increasing feebleness, until finally it seemed best to mention
the subject, even indirectly, no more. In the evenings the silences
in the library were charged with feeling withheld from expression;
though Dan enlivened the room when he came in, and made it boisterous
if he brought the baby with him. Certainly no depression could
be recorded against either of this pair; Henry Daniel glowed with
health and became livelier with every month of increasing age
and weight. As for Lena, after her outburst upon the reading of
Mrs. Savage’s will, she was another of this household who was
surcharged with repressed feeling; but her repression became a
habit;—weeks went by when she did not slam a door. She appeared
to become more tolerant of her husband at this period than she
had ever been; and when she spoke to him at all, it was in a tone
suggesting that her tolerance had in it something of compassion.</p>

<p>She devoted herself to her baby, perhaps finding a refuge in
her devotion; but she declined to accompany Dan on Sunday afternoons
when he went for a sidewalk excursion with the perambulator. This
was an established custom in the town, she observed: every Sunday,
early in the afternoon, the young fathers and mothers began to
appear upon the sidewalks, the fathers pushing the baby-carriages
and the mothers strolling a little way behind with the toddlers,
if there were any of these, or perhaps lingering for a moment
of gossip with friends encountered by the way, then scurrying
on to overtake the perambulator.</p>

<p>High and low followed the custom; it was as well observed by
the South Side, where lived most of the followers of handicrafts,
as it was upon National Avenue and Amberson Boulevard. The perambulators
of these two thoroughfares were the more luxurious; fine lace
was to be seen upon the occupants, and the accompanying parents
were well dressed; though Lena, looking from her window, sometimes
shivered to see one of the passing young husbands wearing a Derby
hat as a complement to the long frock coat that appeared to be
a regalia garment necessary to this occasion.</p>

<p>By four o’clock, which was Dan’s favourite hour for his weekly
perambulator stroll, most of the pedestrian families were on their
way homeward from "Sunday dinner at grandpa’s and grandma’s,"
the grandma and grandpa being almost invariably the parents of
the young mother. Lena objected to the parade as "publicly provincial,"
and pointed out that Dan lacked any plausible reason for joining
it;—if the baby needed air he could be taken for a drive in the
family carriage; and if Dan insisted on pushing him in the perambulator,
the Oliphants’ back yard was "twice the size of Madison Square,"
she said with elaborate exaggeration; but Henry Daniel’s father
only laughed and continued to follow the custom of his fellow-townsmen.</p>

<p>The Sunday-afternoon excursion with the perambulator gave him
his greatest happiness, and all through his bustling week days
of work he looked forward to it, chuckling as he thought of it.
And when the rewarding hour arrived, he went forth wheeling his
son before him and cheerily unconscious that he was the only father
in sight not accompanied (even at a distance) by a second parent
for the occupant of the perambulator. He was proud to exhibit
Henry Daniel and loved nothing better than to lift him out of
the little carriage and talk uproarious baby-talk to him, and
tickle him to make him laugh, and in every other possible manner
show him off to other young parents—or to anybody who had time
to listen to these hilarious paternal banalities. If other parents
bragged of their own young, showing them off in turn, Dan’s manifestations
with Henry Daniel would become but the louder; and if the other
parents, being two to one, succeeded in drowning him out, he would
restore his child to the perambulator tenderly and move on, sorry
for people who had so little to make such a fuss about.</p>

<p>Sunday, he said, was the only day when he had a chance to get
really acquainted with the baby; for all the rest of the week
Dan was out hustling so early and so late that opportunities for
making the acquaintance more intimate were few. A great part of
his activity at this time was in the chase of possible buyers
of Ornaby ground; and a driven life was led by those three men
who had thought they might buy lots after the foreclosure. The
Earl of Ornaby gave them little rest; and although he sometimes
remained away from one or another of them for days at a time—perhaps
upon the ardent request, "Well, for heaven’s sakes can’t you even
give me a chance to think it <em>over</em>?"—he would write frequent
letters to the pursued creature in the interval. Incessantly he
persuaded, argued, and prophesied; seldom has a half-accepted,
half-rejected lover shown such hot persistence in convincing his
lady; and probably never have three dismal men in moderate circumstances
been so urgently courted into the buying of lots.</p>

<p>They were not friends, these men; they had gone separately to
Ornaby and had no knowledge of one another when the pursuit of
them began; but they knew one another well before it was over.
The vehement salesman had so quoted them to one another, making
such glorifying use of their every admission not actually condemning
Ornaby, that a conference of the quoted seemed to be a necessity.
They thought to meet in secret; but within ten minutes found the
hunter upon them.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he began, "you wish to be alone, and I will not
interrupt you"—and talked until two of them went home.</p>

<p>He went with them, and then returned to talk some more to the
man at whose house the conference had been called.</p>

<p>Such deadly persistence finally prevailed upon a majority of
the three and two more lots were sold in the Addition upon the
liberal terms of nothing down and little more than nothing to
be paid in periodical installments. Nevertheless, here were three
actual sales, and if there ever lived a salesman who knew how
to make three appear to be a hundred, because he himself believed
three to be a hundred, that multi-visioned salesman was Daniel
Oliphant.</p>

<p>In a day of quieter art certain academicians now gone from their
academies had frequently the desire to paint pretty young women
blue-robed and poised as if alighting from the air. Sometimes,
upon the lower part of his canvas, beneath the poising lady’s
alighting toe, such a painter would twirl a golden circle, then
swathe her eyes with a blue kerchief and name the picture, "Dame
Fortune on her Wheel." The effect was of the dame blind, but dancing;
and sometimes the course of events in the life of a human creature
will warrant the conception, yet it has usually been observed
that Fortune seldom dances to one who has not diligently begged
the favour. It would seem the blinded lady has a little bit of
her kerchief up.</p>

<p>The man who had built a picnic shack at Ornaby for his large
family found his wife and children so reluctant to come home from
the picnics that he enlarged the shack, put a cooking-stove and
cots in it, and began to stay there from Saturday afternoon until
Monday morning. His house was far down in the city where the smoke
had begun to discourage his wife, and, in the unavailing struggle
to keep things clean, she grew querulous. "If we could only <em>live</em>
out here!" she wailed one day when they were at the shack; and
this outcry produced the first house in Ornaby Addition. It was
a cottage of the "New Colonial" kind; and Dan drove all of his
other Ornaby boosters to see every new phase of its construction,
from the digging of the cellar to the polishing of the floors;
for when the cottage was begun the purchasers of land in the Addition
were increased in number to eight. By the time the cottage was
finished there were fourteen, and several of these intended to
build "right the first minute next spring," Dan said.</p>

<p>He called them his "Ornaby boosters"; for he readily adopted
the new vocabulary of commercial argot then being developed by
"promoters," by writers of advertisements, and by New York hustlers
for trade. "Every Ornaby buyer is an Ornaby booster," he said
one day, when the new cottages in the Addition had brought him
new buyers of lots; and, falling instantly in love with the cadence
of this alliteration, went straight to the billboard men. Thereafter
no one could go northward of the city for an afternoon drive and
fail to find the gentle landscape wrecked. On every road the earl
blazoned his great defacements: "Every Ornaby Buyer is an Ornaby
Booster!"</p>

<p>At home he had two subjects, both subdivided. One was Henry Daniel,
his growth, his wit, and his precocity; and the other was Ornaby
Addition, its present magnificence and prospective splendour.</p>

<p>"And the queer thing is," Harlan told Martha Shelby, "he believes
every word of it. He actually still believes he’s making a success
of that dreadful place. Isn’t it strange?"</p>

<p>But Martha said that she knew something stranger, and when he
asked her what it was, she answered: "Why, it’s your still believing
he <em>isn’t</em> making a success of the ‘dreadful place.’" </p>
