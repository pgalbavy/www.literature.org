So far as I can remember now, except for that one emotional phase
by the graveside, I passed through all these experiences rather
callously.  I had already, with the facility of youth, changed my
world, ceased to think at all of the old school routine and put
Bladesover aside for digestion at a latter stage.  I took up my
new world in Wimblehurst with the chemist's shop as its hub, set
to work at Latin and materia medica, and concentrated upon the
present with all my heart.  Wimblehurst is an exceptionally
quiet and grey Sussex town rare among south of England towns in
being largely built of stone.  I found something very agreeable
and picturesque in its clean cobbled streets, its odd turnings
and abrupt corners; and in the pleasant park that crowds up one
side of the town.  The whole place is under the Eastry dominion
and it was the Eastry influence and dignity that kept its
railway station a mile and three-quarters away.  Eastry House is
so close that it dominates the whole; one goes across the
marketplace (with its old lock-up and stocks), past the great
pre-reformation church, a fine grey shell, like some empty skull
from which the life has fled, and there at once are the huge
wrought-iron gates, and one peeps through them to see the facade
of this place, very white and large and fine, down a long avenue
of yews.  Eastry was far greater than Bladesover and an
altogether completer example of the eighteenth century system. 
It ruled not two villages, but a borough, that had sent its sons
and cousins to parliament almost as a matter of right so long as
its franchise endured.  Every one was in the system, every
one--except my uncle.  He stood out and complained.
<P>
My uncle was the first real breach I found in the great front of
Bladesover the world had presented me, for Chatham was not so
much a breach as a confirmation.   But my uncle had no respect
for Bladesover and Eastry--none whatever.  He did not believe in
them.  He was blind even to what they were.  He propounded
strange phrases about them, he exfoliated and wagged about novel
and incredible ideas.
<P>
"This place," said my uncle, surveying it from his open doorway
in the dignified stillness of a summer afternoon, "wants Waking
Up!"
<P>
I was sorting up patent medicines in the corner.
<P>
"I'd like to let a dozen young Americans loose into it," said my
uncle.  "Then we'd see."
<P>
I made a tick against Mother Shipton's Sleeping Syrup.  We had
cleared our forward stock.
<P>
"Things must be happening SOMEWHERE, George," he broke out in a
querulously rising note as he came back into the little shop.  He
fiddled with the piled dummy boxes of fancy soap and scent and so
forth that adorned the end of the counter, then turned about
petulantly, stuck his hands deeply into his pockets and withdrew
one to scratch his head.  "I must do SOMETHING," he said.  "I
can't stand it.
<P>
"I must invent something.  And shove it.... I could.
<P>
"Or a play.  There's a deal of money in a play, George.  What
would you think of me writing a play eh?... There's all sorts of
things to be done.
<P>
"Or the stog-igschange."
<P>
He fell into that meditative whistling of his.
<P>
"Sac-ramental wine!" he swore, "this isn't the world--it's Cold
Mutton Fat! That's what Wimblehurst is!  Cold Mutton Fat!--dead
and stiff!  And I'm buried in it up to the arm pits.  Nothing
ever happens, nobody wants things to happen 'scept me!  Up in
London, George, things happen.  America! I wish to Heaven,
George, I'd been born American--where things hum.
<P>
"What can one do here?  How can one grow?  While we're sleepin'
here with our Capital oozing away into Lord Eastry's pockets for
rent-men are up there...."  He indicated London as remotely over
the top of the dispensing counter, and then as a scene of great
activity by a whirl of the hand and a wink and a meaning smile at
me.
<P>
"What sort of things do they do?" I asked.
<P>
"Rush about," he said.  "Do things! Somethin' glorious.  There's
cover gambling.  Ever heard of that, George?"  He drew the air in
through his teeth.  "You put down a hundred say, and buy ten
thousand pounds worth.  See?  That's a cover of one per cent. 
Things go up one, you sell, realise cent per cent; down, whiff,
it's gone! Try again! Cent per cent, George, every day.  Men are
made or done for in an hour.  And the shoutin'!  Zzzz.... Well,
that's one way, George.  Then another way--there's Corners!"
<P>
"They're rather big things, aren't they?" I ventured.
<P>
"Oh, if you go in for wheat or steel--yes.  But suppose you
tackled a little thing, George.  Just some little thing that only
needed a few thousands.  Drugs for example.  Shoved all you had
into it--staked your liver on it, so to speak.  Take a drug--take
ipecac, for example.  Take a lot of ipecac.  Take all there is!
See?  There you are! There aren't unlimited supplies of
ipecacuanha--can't be!--and it's a thing people must have.  Then
quinine again!  You watch your chance, wait for a tropical war
breaking out, let's say, and collar all the quinine.  Where ARE
they?  Must have quinine, you know.  Eh?  Zzzz.
<P>
"Lord! there's no end of things--no end of little things. 
Dill-water--all the suffering babes yowling for it.  Eucalyptus
again--cascara--witch hazel--menthol--all the toothache things. 
Then there's antiseptics, and curare, cocaine...."
<P>
"Rather a nuisance to the doctors," I reflected.
<P>
"They got to look out for themselves.  By Jove, yes.  They'll do
you if they can, and you do them.  Like brigands.  That makes it
romantic.  That's the Romance of Commerce, George.  You're in the
mountains  there!  Think of having all the quinine in the world,
and some millionaire's pampered wife gone ill with malaria, eh?
That's a squeeze, George, eh?  Eh?  Millionaire on his motor car
outside, offering you any price you liked.  That 'ud wake up
Wimblehurst.... Lord! You haven't an Idea down here.  Not an
idea.  Zzzz."
<P>
He passed into a rapt dream, from which escaped such fragments
as: "Fifty per cent. advance sir; security--to-morrow.  Zzzz."
<P>
The idea of cornering a drug struck upon my mind then as a sort
of irresponsible monkey trick that no one would ever be
permitted to do in reality.  It was the sort of nonsense one
would talk to make Ewart laugh and set him going on to still
odder possibilities.  I thought it was part of my uncle's way of
talking.  But I've learnt differently since.  The whole trend of
modern money-making is to foresee something that will presently
be needed and put it out of reach, and then to haggle yourself
wealthy.  You buy up land upon which people will presently want
to build houses, you secure rights that will bar vitally
important developments,  and so on, and so on.  Of course the
naive intelligence of a boy does not grasp the subtler
developments of human inadequacy.  He begins life with a
disposition to believe in the wisdom of grown-up people, he does
not realise how casual and disingenuous has been the development
of law and custom, and he thinks that somewhere in the state
there is a power as irresistible as a head master's to check
mischievous and foolish enterprises of every sort.  I will
confess that when my uncle talked of cornering quinine, I had a
clear impression  that any one who contrived to do that would
pretty certainly go to jail.  Now I know that any one who could
really bring it off would be much more likely to go to the House
of Lords!
<P>
My uncle ranged over the gilt labels of his bottles and drawers
for a while, dreaming of corners in this and that.  But at last
he reverted to Wimblehurst again.
<P>
"You got to be in London when these things are in hand.  Down
here--!
<P>
"Jee-rusalem!" he cried.  "Why did I plant myself here?
Everything's done.  The game's over.  Here's Lord Eastry, and
he's got everything, except what his lawyers get, and before you
get any more change this way you'll have to dynamite him--and
them.  HE doesn't want anything more to happen.  Why should he?
Any chance 'ud be a loss to him.  He wants everything to burble
along and burble along and go on as it's going for the next ten
thousand years, Eastry after Eastry, one parson down another
come, one grocer dead, get another!  Any one with any ideas
better go away.  They HAVE gone away!  Look at all these blessed
people in this place! Look at 'em!  All fast asleep, doing their
business out of habit--in a sort of dream, Stuffed men would do
just as well--just.  They've all shook down into their places. 
THEY don't want anything to happen either.  They're all broken
in. There you are!  Only what are they all alive for?... 
<P>
"Why can't they get a clockwork chemist?"
<P>
He concluded as he often concluded these talks.  "I must invent
something,--that's about what I must do. Zzzz.  Some convenience.
<P>
Something people want.... Strike out.... You can't think, George,
of anything everybody wants and hasn't got?  I mean something you
could turn out retail under a shilling, say?  Well, YOU think,
whenever you haven't got anything better to do.  See?"
<P>
II
<P>
So I remember my uncle in that first phase, young, but already a
little fat, restless, fretful, garrulous, putting in my
fermenting head all sorts of discrepant ideas.  Certainly he was
educational....
<P>
For me the years at Wimblehurst were years of pretty active
growth.  Most of my leisure and much of my time in the shop I
spent in study.  I speedily mastered the modicum of Latin
necessary for my qualifying examinations, and--a little assisted
by the Government Science and Art Department classes that were
held in the Grammar School--went on with my mathematics.   There
were classes in physics, in chemistry, in mathematics and machine
drawing, and I took up these subjects with considerable
avidity.  Exercise I got chiefly in the form of walks.  There was
some cricket in the summer and football in the winter sustained
by young men's clubs that levied a parasitic blackmail of the big
people and the sitting member, but I was never very keen at these
games.  I didn't find any very close companions among the youths
of Wimblehurst.  They struck me, after my cockney schoolmates, as
loutish and slow, servile and furtive, spiteful and mean.  WE
used to swagger, but these countrymen dragged their feet and
hated an equal who didn't; we talked loud, but you only got the
real thoughts of Wimblehurst in a knowing undertone behind its
hand.  And even then they weren't much in the way of thoughts.
<P>
No, I didn't like those young countrymen, and I'm no believer in
the English countryside under the Bladesover system as a
breeding ground for honourable men.  One hears a frightful lot of
nonsense about the Rural Exodus and the degeneration wrought by
town life upon our population.  To my mind, the English townsman,
even in the slums, is infinitely better spiritually, more
courageous, more imaginative and cleaner, than his agricultural 
cousin.  I've seen them both when they didn't think they were
being observed, and I know.  There was something about my
Wimblehurst companions that disgusted me.  It's hard to define. 
Heaven knows that at that cockney boarding-school at Goudhurst we
were coarse enough; the Wimblehurst youngsters had neither words
nor courage for the sort of thing we used to do--for our bad
language, for example; but, on the other hand, they displayed a
sort of sluggish, real lewdness, lewdness is the word--a baseness
of attitude.  Whatever we exiled urbans did at Goudhurst was
touched with something, however coarse, of romantic imagination.
We had read the Boys of England, and told each other stories.  In
the English countryside there are no books at all, no songs, no
drama, no valiant sin even; all these things have never come or
they were taken away and hidden generations ago, and the
imagination aborts and bestialises.  That, I think, is where the
real difference against the English rural man lies.  It is
because I know this that I do not share in the common repinings
because  our countryside is being depopulated, because our
population is passing through the furnace of the towns. They
starve, they suffer, no doubt, but they come out of it hardened,
they come out of it with souls.
<P>
Of an evening the Wimblehurst blade, shiny-faced from a wash and
with some loud finery, a coloured waistcoat or a vivid tie, would
betake himself to the Eastry Arms billiard-room, or to the bar
parlour of some minor pub where nap could be played.  One soon
sickened of his slow knowingness, the cunning observation  of his
deadened eyes, his idea of a "good story," always, always told in
undertones, poor dirty worm!  his shrewd, elaborate maneuvers for
some petty advantage,  a drink to the good or such-like deal. 
There rises before my eyes as I write, young Hopley Dodd, the son
of the Wimblehurst auctioneer, the pride of Wimblehurst, its
finest flower, with his fur waistcoat and his bulldog pipe, his
riding breeches--he had no horse--and his gaiters, as he used to
sit, leaning forward and watching the billiard-table from under
the brim of his artfully tilted hat.  A half-dozen phrases
constituted  his conversation: "hard lines!" he used to say, and
"Good baazness," in a bass bleat.  Moreover, he had a long slow
whistle that was esteemed the very cream of humorous comment. 
Night after night he was there.
<P>
Also you knew he would not understand that _I_ could play
billiards, and regarded every stroke I made as a fluke.  For a
beginner I didn't play so badly, I thought.  I'm not so sure now;
that was my opinion at the time.  But young Dodd's scepticism and
the "good baazness" finally cured me of my disposition to
frequent the Eastry Arms, and so these noises had their value in
my world.
<P>
I made no friends among the young men of the place at all, and
though I was entering upon adolescence I have no love-affair to
tell of here.  Not that I was not waking up to that aspect of
life in my middle teens I did, indeed, in various slightly
informal ways scrape acquaintance with casual Wimblehurst girls;
with a little dressmaker's apprentice I got upon shyly speaking
terms, and a pupil teacher in the National School went further
and was "talked about" in connection with me but I was not by any
means touched by any reality of passion for either of these young
people; love--love as yet came to me only in my dreams.  I only
kissed these girls once or twice.  They rather disconcerted than 
developed those dreams.  They were so clearly not "it."  I shall
have much to say of love in this story, but I may break it to the
reader now that it is my role to be a rather ineffectual lover. 
Desire I knew well enough--indeed, too well; but love I have been
shy of.  In all my early enterprises in the war of the sexes, I
was torn between the urgency of the body and a habit of romantic
fantasy that wanted every phase of the adventure to be generous
and beautiful.  And I had a curiously haunting memory of
Beatrice, of her kisses in the bracken and her kiss upon the
wall, that somehow pitched the standard too high for
Wimblehurst's opportunities.  I will not deny I did in a boyish
way attempt a shy, rude adventure or so in love-making at
Wimblehurst;  but through these various influences, I didn't
bring things off to any extent at all.  I left behind me no
devastating memories, no splendid reputation.  I came away at
last, still inexperienced and a little thwarted, with only a
natural growth of interest and desire in sexual things.
<P>
If I fell in love with any one in Wimblehurst it was with my
aunt.  She treated me with a kindliness that was only half
maternal--she petted my books, she knew about my certificates,
she made fun of me in a way that stirred my heart to her.  Quite
unconsciously I grew fond of her....
<P>
My adolescent years at Wimblehurst were on the whole laborious,
uneventful years that began in short jackets and left me in many
ways nearly a man, years so uneventful that the Calculus of
Variations is associated with one winter, and an examination in
Physics for Science and Art department Honours marks an epoch. 
Many divergent impulses stirred within me, but the master impulse
was a grave young disposition to work and learn and thereby in
some not very clearly defined way get out of the Wimblehurst
world into which I had fallen.  I wrote with some frequency to
Ewart, self-conscious, but, as I remember them, not intelligent
letters, dated in Latin and with lapses into Latin quotation that
roused Ewart to parody.  There was something about me in those
days more than a little priggish.  But it was, to do myself
justice, something  more than the petty pride of learning.  I had
a very grave sense of discipline and preparation that I am not
ashamed at all to remember.  I was serious.  More serious than I
am at the present time.  More serious, indeed, than any adult
seems to be.  I was capable then of efforts--of nobilities.... 
They are beyond me now.  I don't see why, at forty, I shouldn't
confess I respect my own youth.  I had dropped being a boy quite
abruptly.  I thought I was presently to go out into a larger and
quite important world and do significant things there.  I thought
I was destined to do something definite to a world that had a
definite purpose.  I did not understand then, as I do now, that
life was to consist largely in the world's doing things to me. 
Young people never do seem to understand that aspect of things. 
And, as I say, among my educational influences my uncle, all
unsuspected, played a leading part, and perhaps among other
things gave my discontent with Wimblehurst, my desire to get away
from that clean and picturesque emptiness, a form and expression
that helped to emphasise it.  In a way that definition made me
patient.  "Presently I shall get to London," I said, echoing him.
<P>
I remember him now as talking, always talking, in those days.  He
talked to me of theology, he talked of politics, of the wonders
of science and the marvels of art, of the passions and the
affections, of the immortality of the soul and the peculiar
actions of drugs; but predominantly and constantly he talked of
getting on, of enterprises, of inventions and great fortunes, of
Rothschilds, silver kings, Vanderbilts, Goulds, flotations,
realisations and the marvelous ways of Chance with men--in all
localities, that is to say, that are not absolutely sunken to the
level of Cold Mutton Fat.
<P>
When I think of those early talks, I figure him always in one of
three positions.  Either we were in the dispensing lair behind a
high barrier, he pounding up things in a mortar perhaps, and I
rolling pill-stuff into long rolls and cutting it up with a sort
of broad, fluted knife, or he stood looking out of the shop door
against the case of sponges and spray-diffusers, while I surveyed
him from behind the counter, or he leant against the little
drawers behind the counter, and I hovered dusting in front.  The
thought of those early days brings back to my nostrils the faint
smell of scent that was always in the air, marbled now with
streaks of this drug and now of that, and to my eyes the rows of
jejune glass bottles with gold labels, mirror-reflected, that
stood behind him.  My aunt, I remember, used sometimes to come
into the shop in a state of aggressive sprightliness, a sort of
connubial ragging expedition, and get much fun over the
abbreviated Latinity of those gilt inscriptions.  "Ol Amjig,
George," she would read derisively, "and he pretends it's almond
oil!  Snap!--and that's mustard.  Did you ever, George?
<P>
"Look at him, George, looking dignified.  I'd like to put an old
label on to him round the middle like his bottles are, with Ol
Pondo on it.  That's Latin for Impostor, George MUST be.  He'd
look lovely with a stopper."
<P>
"YOU want a stopper," said my uncle, projecting his face....
<P>
My aunt, dear soul, was in those days quite thin and slender,
with a delicate rosebud completion and a disposition to connubial
badinage, to a sort of gentle skylarking.  There was a silvery
ghost of lisping in her speech.  She was a great humourist, and
as the constraint of my presence at meals wore off, I became more
and more aware of a filmy but extensive net of nonsense she had
woven about her domestic relations until it had become the
reality of her life.  She affected a derisive attitude to the
world at large and applied the epithet "old" to more things than
I have ever heard linked to it before or since.  "Here's the old
news-paper," she used to say--to my uncle.  "Now don't go and get
it in the butter, you silly old Sardine!"
<P>
"What's the day of the week, Susan?" my uncle would ask.
<P>
"Old Monday, Sossidge," she would say, and add, "I got all my Old
Washing to do.  Don't I KNOW it!"...
<P>
She had evidently been the wit and joy of a large circle of
schoolfellows, and this style had become a second nature with
her.  It made her very delightful to me in that quiet place.  Her
customary walk even had a sort of hello! in it.  Her chief
preoccupation in life was, I believe, to make my uncle laugh, and
when by some new nickname, some new quaintness or absurdity, she
achieved that end, she was, behind a mask of sober amazement, the
happiest woman on earth.  My uncle's laugh when it did come, I
must admit was, as Baedeker says, "rewarding."  It began with
gusty blowings and snortings, and opened into a clear "Ha ha!"
but in fullest development it included, in those youthful
days, falling about anyhow and doubling up tightly, and whackings
of the stomach, and tears and cries of anguish.  I never in my
life heard my uncle laugh to his maximum except at her; he was
commonly too much in earnest for that, and he didn't laugh much
at all, to my knowledge, after those early years.  Also she threw
things at him to an enormous extent in her resolve to keep things
lively in spite of Wimblehurst; sponges out of stock she threw,
cushions, balls of paper, clean washing,  bread; and once up the
yard when they thought that I and the errand boy and the
diminutive maid of all work were safely out of the way, she
smashed a boxful of eight-ounce bottles I had left to drain,
assaulting  my uncle with a new soft broom.  Sometimes she would
shy things at me--but not often.  There seemed always laughter
round and about her--all three of us would share hysterics at
times--and on one occasion the two of them came home from church
shockingly  ashamed of themselves, because of a storm of mirth
during the sermon.  The vicar, it seems, had tried to blow his
nose with a black glove as well as the customary 
pocket-handkerchief.  And afterwards she had picked up her own
glove by the finger, and looking innocently  but intently
sideways, had suddenly by this simple expedient exploded my uncle
altogether.  We had it all over again at dinner.
<P>
"But it shows you," cried my uncle, suddenly becoming grave,
"what Wimblehurst is, to have us all laughing at a little thing
like that!  We weren't the only ones that giggled.  Not by any
means!  And, Lord! it was funny!"
<P>
Socially, my uncle and aunt were almost completely isolated.  In
places like Wimblehurst the tradesmen's lives always are isolated
socially, all of them, unless they have a sister or a bosom
friend among the other wives, but the husbands met in various
bar-parlours or in the billiard-room of the Eastry Arms.  But my
uncle, for the most part, spent his evenings at home.  When first
he arrived in Wimblehurst I think he had spread his effect of
abounding ideas and enterprise rather too aggressively; and
Wimblehurst, after a temporary subjugation, had rebelled and
done its best to make a butt of him.  His appearance in a
public-house led to a pause in any conversation that was going
on.
<P>
"Come to tell us about everything, Mr. Pond'revo?" some one would
say politely.
<P>
"You wait," my uncle used to answer, disconcerted, and sulk for
the rest of his visit.
<P>
Or some one with an immense air of innocence would remark to the
world generally, "They're talkin' of rebuildin'  Wimblehurst all
over again, I'm told.  Anybody heard anything of it?  Going to
make it a reg'lar smartgoin', enterprisin' place--kind of
Crystal Pallas."
<P>
"Earthquake and a pestilence before you get that," my uncle would
mutter, to the infinite delight of every one, and add something
inaudible about "Cold Mutton Fat."...
<P>
III
<P>
We were torn apart by a financial accident to my uncle of which I
did not at first grasp the full bearings.  He had developed what
I regarded as an innocent intellectual recreation which he called
stock-market meteorology.  I think he got the idea from one use
of curves in the graphic presentation of associated variations 
that he saw me plotting.  He secured some of my squared paper
and, having cast about for a time, decided  to trace the rise and
fall of certain lines and railways.  "There's something in this,
George," he said, and I little dreamt that among other things
that were in it, was the whole of his spare money and most of
what my mother had left to him in trust for me.
<P>
"It's as plain as can be," he said.  "See, here's one system of
waves and here's another! These are prices for Union
Pacifics--extending over a month.  Now next week, mark my words,
they'll be down one whole point.  We're getting near the steep
part of the curve again.  See?  It's absolutely scientific.  It's
verifiable. Well, and apply it!  You buy in the hollow and sell
on the crest, and there you are!"
<P>
I was so convinced of the triviality of this amusement that to
find at last that he had taken it in the most disastrous earnest
overwhelmed me.
<P>
He took me for a long walk to break it to me, over the hills
towards Yare and across the great gorse commons by Hazelbrow.
<P>
"There are ups and downs in life, George," he said--halfway
across that great open space, and paused against the sky...."I
left out one factor in the Union Pacific analysis."
<P>
"DID you?" I said, struck by the sudden chance in his voice. 
"But you don't mean?"
<P>
I stopped and turned on him in the narrow sandy rut of pathway
and he stopped likewise.
<P>
"I do, George.  I DO mean.  It's bust me!  I'm a bankrupt here
and now."
<P>
"Then--?"
<P>
"The shop's bust too.  I shall have to get out of that."
<P>
"And me?"
<P>
"Oh, you!--YOU'RE all right.  You can transfer your
apprenticeship, and--er--well, I'm not the sort of man to be
careless with trust funds, you can be sure.  I kept that aspect
in mind.  There's some of it left George--trust me!--quite a
decent little sum."
<P>
"But you and aunt?"
<P>
"It isn't QUITE the way we meant to leave Wimblehurst, George;
but we shall have to go.  Sale; all the things shoved about and
ticketed--lot a hundred and one.  Ugh!... It's been a larky
little house in some ways.  The first we had.  Furnishing--a
spree in its way.... Very happy..."  His face winced at some
memory.  "Let's go on, George," he said shortly, near choking, I
could see.
<P>
I turned my back on him, and did not look round again for a
little while.
<P>
"That's how it is, you see, George."  I heard him after a time.
<P>
When we were back in the high road again he came alongside, and
for a time we walked in silence.
<P>
"Don't say anything home yet," he said presently. "Fortunes of
War.  I got to pick the proper time with Susan--else she'll get
depressed.  Not that she isn't a first-rate brick whatever comes
along."
<P>
"All right," I said, "I'll be careful"; and it seemed to me for
the time altogether too selfish to bother him with any further
inquiries about his responsibility as my trustee.  He gave a
little sigh of relief at my note of assent, and was presently
talking quite cheerfully of his plans.... But he had, I
remember, one lapse into moodiness that came and went suddenly. 
"Those others!" he said, as though the thought had stung him for
the first time.
<P>
"What others?" I asked.
<P>
"Damn them!" said he.
<P>
"But what others?"
<P>
"All those damned stick-in-the-mud-and-die-slowly tradespeople:
Ruck, the butcher, Marbel, the grocer.  Snape!  Gord!  George,
HOW they'll grin!"
<P>
I thought him over in the next few weeks, and I remember now in
great detail the last talk we had together before he handed over
the shop and me to his successor.  For he had the good luck to
sell his business, "lock, stock, and barrel"--in which expression
I found myself and my indentures included.  The horrors of a sale
by auction of the furniture even were avoided.
<P>
I remember that either coming or going on that occasion, Ruck,
the butcher, stood in his doorway and regarded us with a grin
that showed his long teeth.
<P>
"You half-witted hog!" said my uncle. "You grinning hyaena"; and
then, "Pleasant day, Mr. Ruck."
<P>
"Goin' to make your fortun' in London, then?" said Mr. Ruck, with
slow enjoyment.
<P>
That last excursion took us along the causeway to Beeching, and
so up the downs and round almost as far as Steadhurst, home.  My
moods, as we went, made a mingled web.  By this time I had really
grasped the fact that my uncle had, in plain English, robbed me;
the little accumulations of my mother, six hundred pounds and
more, that would have educated me and started me in business, had
been eaten into and was mostly gone into the unexpected hollow
that ought to have been a crest of the Union Pacific curve, and
of the remainder he still gave no account.  I was too young and
inexperienced to insist on this or know how to get it, but the
thought of it all made streaks of decidedly black anger in that
scheme of interwoven feelings.   And you know, I was also acutely
sorry for him--almost as sorry as I was for my aunt Susan.  Even
then I had quite found him out.  I knew him to be weaker than
myself; his incurable, irresponsible childishness was as clear
to me then as it was on his deathbed, his redeeming and excusing
imaginative silliness.  Through some odd mental twist perhaps I
was disposed to exonerate him even at the cost of blaming my poor
old mother who had left things in his untrustworthy hands.
<P>
I should have forgiven him altogether, I believe, if he had been
in any manner apologetic to me; but he wasn't that.  He kept
reassuring me in a way I found irritating.  Mostly, however, his
solicitude was for Aunt Susan and himself.
<P>
"It's these Crises, George," he said, "try Character. Your aunt's
come out well, my boy."
<P>
He made meditative noises for a space.
<P>
"Had her cry of course,"--the thing had been only too painfully
evident to me in her eyes and swollen face--"who wouldn't?  But
now--buoyant again!... She's a Corker.
<P>
"We'll be sorry to leave the little house of course. It's a bit
like Adam and Eve, you know.  Lord! what a chap old Milton was!
<P>
     "'The world was all before them, where to choose 
      Their place of rest, and Providence their guide.'
<P>
It sounds, George.... Providence their guide!... Well--thank
goodness there's no imeedgit prospect of either Cain or Abel!
<P>
"After all, it won't be so bad up there.  Not the scenery,
perhaps, or the air we get here, but--LIFE!  We've got very
comfortable little rooms, very comfortable considering, and I
shall rise.  We're not done yet, we're not beaten; don't think
that, George.  I shall pay twenty shillings in the pound before
I've done--you mark my words, George,--twenty--five to you.... I
got this situation within twenty-four hours--others offered. 
It's an important firm--one of the best in London.  I looked to
that.  I might have got four or five shillings a week
more--elsewhere.  Quarters I could name.  But I said to them
plainly, wages to go on with, but opportunity's my
game--development.  We understood each other."
<P>
He threw out his chest, and the little round eyes behind his
glasses rested valiantly on imaginary employers.
<P>
We would go on in silence for a space while he revised and
restated that encounter.  Then he would break out abruptly with
some banal phrase.
<P>
"The Battle of Life, George, my boy," he would cry, or "Ups and
Downs!"
<P>
He ignored or waived the poor little attempts I made to ascertain
my own position.  "That's all right," he would say; or, "Leave
all that to me.  I'LL look after them."  And he would drift away
towards the philosophy and moral of the situation.  What was I to
do?
<P>
"Never put all your resources into one chance, George; that's the
lesson I draw from this.  Have forces in reserve.  It was a
hundred to one, George, that I was right--a hundred to one.  I
worked it out afterwards.  And here we are spiked on the
off-chance.  If I'd have only kept back a little, I'd have had it
on U.P. next day, like a shot, and come out on the rise.  There
you are!"
<P>
His thoughts took a graver turn.
<P>
"It's where you'll bump up against Chance like this, George, that
you feel the need of religion.  Your hard-and-fast scientific
men--your Spencers and Huxleys--they don't understand that.  I
do.  I've thought of it a lot lately--in bed and about.  I was
thinking of it this morning while I shaved.  It's not irreverent
for me to say it, I hope--but God comes in on the off-chance,
George.  See?  Don't you be too cocksure of anything, good or
bad.  That's what I make out of it.  I could have sworn.  Well,
do you think I--particular as I am--would have touched those
Union Pacifics with trust money  at all, if I hadn't thought it a
thoroughly good thing--good without spot or blemish?... And it
was bad!
<P>
"It's a lesson to me.  You start in to get a hundred percent. 
and you come out with that.  It means, in a way, a reproof for
Pride.  I've thought of that, George--in the Night Watches.  I
was thinking this morning when I was shaving, that that's where
the good of it all comes in.  At the bottom I'm a mystic in these
affairs.  You calculate you're going to do this or that, but at
bottom who knows at all WHAT he's doing?  When you most think
you're doing things, they're being done right over your head. 
YOU'RE being done--in a sense.  Take a hundred-to one chance, or
one to a hundred--what does it matter?  You're being Led."
<P>
It's odd that I heard this at the time with unutterable contempt,
and now that I recall it--well, I ask myself, what have I got
better?
<P>
"I wish," said I, becoming for a moment outrageous, "YOU were
being Led to give me some account of my money, uncle."
<P>
"Not without a bit of paper to figure on, George, I can't.  But
you trust me about that never fear.  You trust me."
<P>
And in the end I had to.
<P>
I think the bankruptcy hit my aunt pretty hard.  There was, so
far as I can remember now, a complete cessation of all those
cheerful outbreaks of elasticity, no more skylarking in the shop
nor scampering about the house.  But there was no fuss that I
saw, and only little signs in her complexion of the fits of
weeping that must have taken her.  She didn't cry at the end,
though to me her face with its strain of self-possession was more
pathetic than any weeping.  "Well" she said to me as she came
through the shop to the cab, "Here's old orf, George!  Orf to
Mome number two! Good-bye!"  And she took me in her arms and
kissed me and pressed me to her.  Then she dived straight for the
cab before I could answer her.
<P>
My uncle followed, and he seemed to me a trifle too valiant and
confident in his bearing for reality.  He was unusually white in
the face.  He spoke to his successor at the counter.  "Here we
go!" he said.  "One down, the other up.  You'll find it a quiet
little business so long as you run it on quiet lines--a nice
quiet little business.  There's nothing more?  No?  Well, if you
want to know anything write to me.  I'll always explain fully. 
Anything--business, place or people.  You'll find Pil Antibil. a
little overstocked by-the-by, I found it soothed my mind the day
before yesterday making 'em, and I made 'em all day.  Thousands!
And where's George?  Ah! there you are! I'll write to you,
George, FULLY, about all that affair.  Fully!"
<P>
It became clear to me as if for the first time, that I was really
parting from my aunt Susan.  I went out on to the pavement and
saw her head craned forward, her wide-open blue eyes and her
little face intent on the shop that had combined for her all the
charms of a big doll's house and a little home of her very own.  
"Good-bye!" she said to it and to me.  Our eyes met for a
moment--perplexed.  My uncle bustled out and gave a few totally
unnecessary directions to the cabman and got in beside her.  "All
right?" asked the driver. "Right," said I; and he woke up the
horse with a flick of his whip.  My aunt's eyes surveyed me
again.  "Stick to your old science and things, George, and write
and tell me when they make you a Professor," she said cheerfully.
<P>
She stared at me for a second longer with eyes growing wider and
brighter and a smile that had become fixed, glanced again at the
bright little shop still saying "Ponderevo" with all the emphasis
of its fascia, and then flopped back hastily out of sight of me
into the recesses of the cab.  Then it had gone from before me
and I beheld Mr. Snape, the hairdresser, inside his store
regarding its departure with a quiet satisfaction and exchanging
smiles and significant headshakes with Mr. Marbel.
<P>
IV
<P>
I was left, I say, as part of the lock, stock, and barrel, at
Wimblehurst with my new master, a Mr. Mantell; who plays no part
in the progress of this story except in so far as he effaced my
uncle's traces.  So soon as the freshness of this new personality
faded, I began to find Wimblehurst not only a dull but a lonely
place, and to miss my aunt Susan immensely.  The advertisements
of the summer terms for Cough Linctus were removed; the bottles
of coloured water--red, green, and yellow--restored to their
places; the horse announcing veterinary medicine, which my uncle,
sizzling  all the while, had coloured in careful portraiture of a
Goodwood favourite, rewhitened; and I turned myself  even more
resolutely than before to Latin (until the passing of my
preliminary examination enabled me to drop that), and then to
mathematics and science.
<P>
There were classes in Electricity and Magnetism at the Grammar
School.  I took a little "elementary" prize in that in my first
year and a medal in my third; and in Chemistry and Human
Physiology and Sound, Light and Heat, I did well.  There was also
a lighter, more discursive subject called Physiography, in which
one ranged among the sciences and encountered Geology as a
process of evolution from Eozoon to Eastry House, and Astronomy
as a record of celestial movements of the most austere and
invariable integrity.  I learnt out of badly-written, condensed
little text-books, and with the minimum of experiment, but still
I learnt.  Only thirty years ago it was, and I remember I learnt
of the electric light as an expensive, impracticable toy, the
telephone as a curiosity, electric traction as a practical
absurdity.  There was no argon, no radium, no phagocytes--at 
least to my knowledge, and aluminium was a dear, infrequent
metal.  The fastest ships in the world went then at nineteen
knots, and no one but a lunatic here and there ever thought it
possible that men might fly.
<P>
Many things have happened since then, but the last glance I had
of Wimblehurst two years ago remarked no change whatever in its
pleasant tranquillity.  They had not even built any fresh
houses--at least not actually  in the town, though about the
station there had been some building.  But it was a good place to
do work in, for all its quiescence.  I was soon beyond the small
requirements of the Pharmaceutical Society's examination,  and as
they do not permit candidates to sit for that until one and
twenty, I was presently filling up my time and preventing my
studies becoming too desultory by making an attack upon the
London University degree of Bachelor of Science, which impressed
me then as a very splendid but almost impossible achievement. 
The degree in mathematics and chemistry appealed to me as
particularly congenial--albeit giddily inaccessible.  I set to
work.  I had presently to arrange a holiday and go to London to
matriculate, and so it was I came upon my aunt and uncle again. 
In many ways that visit marked an epoch.  It was my first
impression of London at all.  I was then nineteen, and by a
conspiracy of chances my nearest approach to that human
wilderness had been my brief visit to Chatham.  Chatham too had
been my largest town.  So that I got London at last with an
exceptional freshness of effect, as the sudden revelation of a
whole unsuspected other side to life.
<P>
I came to it on a dull and smoky day by the South Eastern
Railway, and our train was half an hour late, stopping and going
on and stopping again.  I marked beyond Chiselhurst the growing
multitude of villas, and so came stage by stage through
multiplying houses and diminishing interspaces of market garden
and dingy grass to regions of interlacing railway lines, big
factories,  gasometers and wide reeking swamps of dingy little
homes, more of them and more and more.  The number of these and
their dinginess and poverty increased,  and here rose a great
public house and here a Board School and there a gaunt factory;
and away to the east there loomed for a time a queer, incongruous
forest of masts and spars.  The congestion of houses intensified 
and piled up presently into tenements; I marveled more and more
at this boundless world of dingy people; whiffs of industrial
smell, of leather, of brewing, drifted into the carriage; the sky
darkened, I rumbled thunderously over bridges, van-crowded
streets, peered down on and crossed the Thames with an abrupt
eclat of sound.  I got an effect of tall warehouses, of grey
water, barge crowded, of broad banks of indescribable mud, and
then I was in Cannon Street Station--a monstrous dirty cavern
with trains packed across its vast floor and more porters
standing along the platform than I had ever been in my life
before.  I alighted with my portmanteau and struggled along,
realising for the first time just how small and weak I could
still upon occasion feel. In this world, I felt, an Honours medal
in Electricity and magnetism counted for nothing at all.
<P>
Afterwards I drove in a cab down a canon of rushing street
between high warehouses, and peeped up astonished  at the
blackened greys of Saint Paul's.  The traffic of Cheapside--it
was mostly in horse omnibuses in those days--seemed stupendous,
its roar was stupendous;  I wondered where the money came from to
employ so many cabs, what industry could support the endless
jostling stream of silk-hatted, frock-coated, hurrying men.  Down
a turning I found the Temperance Hotel Mr. Mantell had
recommended to me.  The porter in a green uniform who took over
my portmanteau, seemed, I thought, to despise me a good deal.
<P>
V
<P>
Matriculation kept me for four full days and then came an
afternoon to spare, and I sought out Tottenham Court Road
through a perplexing network of various and crowded streets.  But
this London was vast! it was endless! it seemed the whole world
had changed into packed frontages and hoardings and street
spaces.  I got there at last and made inquiries, and I found my
uncle behind the counter of the pharmacy he managed, an
establishment that did not impress me as doing a particularly
high-class trade.  "Lord!" he said at the sight of me, "I was
wanting something to happen!"
<P>
He greeted me warmly.  I had grown taller, and he, I thought, had
grown shorter and smaller and rounder but otherwise he was
unchanged.  He struck me as being rather shabby, and the silk hat
he produced and put on, when, after mysterious negotiations in
the back premises he achieved his freedom to accompany me, was
past its first youth; but he was as buoyant and confident as
ever.
<P>
"Come to ask me about all THAT," he cried.  "I've never written
yet."
<P>
"Oh, among other things," said I, with a sudden regrettable
politeness, and waived the topic of his trusteeship to ask after
my aunt Susan.
<P>
"We'll have her out of it," he said suddenly; "we'll go
somewhere.  We don't get you in London every day."
<P>
"It's my first visit," I said, "I've never seen London before";
and that made him ask me what I thought of it, and the rest of
the talk was London, London, to the exclusion of all smaller
topics.  He took me up the Hampstead Road almost to the Cobden
statue, plunged into some back streets to the left, and came at
last to a blistered front door that responded to his latch-key,
one of a long series of blistered front doors with fanlights and
apartment cards above.  We found ourselves in a drab-coloured
passage that was not only narrow and dirty but desolatingly
empty, and then he opened a door and revealed my aunt sitting at
the window with a little sewing-machine on a bamboo occasional
table before her, and "work"--a plum-coloured walking dress I
judged at its most analytical stage--scattered over the rest of
the apartment.
<P>
At the first glance I judged my aunt was plumper than she had
been, but her complexion was just as fresh and her China blue eye
as bright as in the old days.
<P>
"London," she said, didn't "get blacks" on her.
<P>
She still "cheeked" my uncle, I was pleased to find. "What are
you old Poking in for at THIS time--Gubbitt?," she said when he
appeared, and she still looked with a practised eye for the
facetious side of things.  When she saw me behind him, she gave a
little cry and stood up radiant.  Then she became grave.
<P>
I was surprised at my own emotion in seeing her.  She held me at
arm's length for a moment, a hand on each shoulder, and looked at
me with a sort of glad scrutiny.  She seemed to hesitate, and
then pecked little kiss off my cheek.
<P>
"You're a man, George," she said, as she released me, and
continued to look at me for a while.
<P>
Their menage was one of a very common type in London.  They
occupied what is called the dining-room floor of a small house,
and they had the use of a little inconvenient kitchen in the
basement that had once been scullery.  The two rooms, bedroom
behind and living room in front, were separated by folding-doors
that were never now thrown back, and indeed, in the presence of a
visitor, not used at all.  There was of course no bathroom or
anything of that sort available, and there was no water supply
except to the kitchen below.  My aunt did all the domestic work,
though she could have afforded to pay for help if the build of
the place had not rendered that inconvenient to the pitch of
impossibility.  There was no sort of help available except that
of indoor servants, for whom she had no accommodation.   The
furniture was their own; it was partly secondhand,  but on the
whole it seemed cheerful to my eye, and my aunt's bias for cheap,
gay-figured muslin had found ample score.  In many ways I should
think it must have been an extremely inconvenient and cramped
sort of home, but at the time I took it, as I was taking
everything, as being there and in the nature of things.  I did
not see the oddness of solvent decent people living in a
habitation so clearly neither designed nor adapted for their
needs, so wasteful of labour and so devoid of beauty as this was,
and it is only now as I describe this that I find myself thinking
of the essential absurdity of an intelligent community living in
such makeshift homes.  It strikes me now as the next thing to
wearing second-hand clothes.
<P>
You see it was a natural growth, part of that system to which
Bladesover, I hold, is the key.  There are wide regions of
London, miles of streets of houses, that appear  to have been
originally designed for prosperous-middle-class homes of the
early Victorian type.  There must have been a perfect fury of
such building in the thirties, forties, and fifties.  Street
after street must have been rushed into being, Campden Town way,
Pentonville way, Brompton way, West Kensington way in the
Victoria region and all over the minor suburbs of the south side.
<P>
I am doubtful if many of these houses had any long use as the
residences of single families if from the very first almost their
tenants did not makeshift and take lodgers and sublet.  They were
built with basements, in which their servants worked and
lived--servants of a more submissive and troglodytic generation
who did not mind stairs.  The dining-room (with folding doors)
was a little above the ground level, and in that the wholesome
boiled and roast with damp boiled potatoes and then pie to
follow, was consumed  and the numerous family read and worked in
the evening, and above was the drawing-room (also with folding
doors), where the infrequent callers were received.   That was
the vision at which those industrious builders aimed.  Even while
these houses were being run up, the threads upon the loom of fate
were shaping to abolish altogether the type of household that
would have fitted them.  Means of transit were developing to
carry the moderately prosperous middle-class families out of
London, education and factory employment were whittling away at
the supply of rough, hardworking, obedient girls who would stand
the subterranean drudgery  of these places, new classes of
hard-up middle-class people such as my uncle, employees of
various types, were coming into existence, for whom no homes were
provided.  None of these classes have ideas of what they ought to
be, or fit in any legitimate way into the Bladesover theory that
dominates our minds.  It was nobody's concern to see them housed
under civilised conditions, and the beautiful laws of supply and
demand  had free play.  They had to squeeze in.  The landlords
came out financially intact from their blundering  enterprise. 
More and more these houses fell into the hands of married
artisans, or struggling widows or old servants with savings, who
became responsible for the quarterly rent and tried to sweat a
living by sub-letting furnished or unfurnished apartments.
<P>
I remember now that a poor grey-haired old woman who had an air
of having been roused from a nap in the dust bin, came out into
the area and looked up at us as we three went out from the front
door to "see London" under my uncle's direction.  She was the
sub-letting occupier; she squeezed out a precarious living by
taking the house whole and sub-letting it in detail and she made
her food and got the shelter of an attic above and a basement
below by the transaction.  And if she didn't chance to "let"
steadily, out she went to pauperdom and some other poor, sordid
old adventurer tried in her place....
<P>
It is a foolish community that can house whole classes, useful
and helpful, honest and loyal classes, in such squalidly
unsuitable dwellings.  It is by no means the social economy it
seems, to use up old women, savings and inexperience in order to
meet the landlord's demands.  But any one who doubts this thing
is going on right up to to-day need only spend an afternoon in
hunting for lodgings in any of the regions of London I have
named.
<P>
But where has my story got to?  My uncle, I say, decided I must
be shown London, and out we three went as soon as my aunt had got
her hat on, to catch all that was left of the day.
<P>
VI
<P>
It pleased my uncle extremely to find I had never seen London
before.  He took possession of the metropolis forthwith. 
"London, George," he said, "takes a lot of understanding.  It's a
great place.  Immense. The richest town in the world, the biggest
port, the greatest manufacturing town, the Imperial city--the
centre of civilisation, the heart of the world!  See those
sandwich men down there!  That third one's hat!  Fair treat!  You
don't see poverty like that in Wimblehurst George!  And many of
them high Oxford honour men too.  Brought down by drink!  It's a
wonderful place, George--a whirlpool, a maelstrom! whirls you up
and whirls you down."
<P>
I have a very confused memory of that afternoon's inspection of
London.  My uncle took us to and fro showing us over his London,
talking erratically, following  a route of his own.  Sometimes we
were walking, sometimes we were on the tops of great staggering
horse omnibuses in a heaving jumble of traffic, and at one point
we had tea in an Aerated Bread Shop.  But I remember very
distinctly how we passed down Park Lane under an overcast sky,
and how my uncle pointed out the house of this child of good
fortune and that with succulent appreciation.
<P>
I remember, too, that as he talked I would find my aunt watching
my face as if to check the soundness of his talk by my
expression.
<P>
"Been in love yet, George?" she asked suddenly, over a bun in the
tea-shop.
<P>
"Too busy, aunt," I told her.
<P>
She bit her bun extensively, and gesticulated with the remnant to
indicate that she had more to say.
<P>
"How are YOU going to make your fortune?" she said so soon as
she could speak again.  "You haven't told us that."
<P>
"'Lectricity," said my uncle, taking breath after a deep draught
of tea.
<P>
"If I make it at all," I said.  "For my part I think shall be
satisfied with something less than a fortune."
<P>
"We're going to make ours--suddenly," she said.
<P>
"So HE old says."  She jerked her head at my uncle.
<P>
"He won't tell me when--so I can't get anything ready.  But it's
coming.  Going to ride in our carriage and have a garden. 
Garden--like a bishop's."
<P>
She finished her bun and twiddled crumbs from her fingers.  "I
shall be glad of the garden," she said.  "It's going to be a real
big one with rosaries and things.  Fountains in it.  Pampas
grass.  Hothouses."
<P>
"You'll get it all right," said my uncle, who had reddened a
little.
<P>
"Grey horses in the carriage, George," she said. "It's nice to
think about when one's dull.  And dinners in restaurants often
and often.  And theatres--in the stalls.  And money and money and
money."
<P>
"You may joke," said my uncle, and hummed for a moment.
<P>
"Just as though an old Porpoise like him would ever make money,"
she said, turning her eyes upon his profile with a sudden lapse
to affection.  "He'll just porpoise about."  
<P>
"I'll do something," said my uncle, "you bet!  Zzzz!" and rapped
with a shilling on the marble table.
<P>
"When you do you'll have to buy me a new pair of gloves," she
said, "anyhow.  That finger's past mending.  Look! you
Cabbage--you."  And she held the split under his nose, and pulled
a face of comical fierceness.
<P>
My uncle smiled at these sallies at the time, but afterwards,
when I went back with him to the Pharmacy--the low-class business
grew brisker in the evening and they kept open late--he reverted
to it in a low expository tone.  "Your aunt's a bit impatient,
George. She gets at me.  It's only natural.... A woman doesn't
understand how long it takes to build up a position.  No.... In
certain directions now--I am--quietly--building up a position. 
Now here.... I get this room.  I have my three assistants.  Zzzz.
It's a position that, judged by the criterion of imeedjit 
income, isn't perhaps so good as I deserve, but
strategically--yes.  It's what I want.  I make my plans.  I rally
my attack."  
<P>
"What plans," I said, "are you making?" 
<P>
"Well, George, there's one thing you can rely upon, I'm doing
nothing in a hurry.  I turn over this one and that, and I don't
talk--indiscreetly.  There's-- No! I don't think I can tell you
that.  And yet, why NOT?" 
<P>
He got up and closed the door into the shop.  "I've told no one,"
he remarked, as he sat down again.  "I owe you something."  
<P>
His face flushed slightly, he leant forward over the little table
towards me.
<P>
"Listen!" he said.
<P>
I listened.
<P>
"Tono-Bungay," said my uncle very slowly and distinctly.
<P>
I thought he was asking me to hear some remote, strange noise. 
"I don't hear anything," I said reluctantly to his expectant
face.   He smiled undefeated.  "Try again,"  he said, and
repeated, "Tono-Bungay."  
<P>
"Oh, THAT!" I said.
<P>
"Eh?" said he.
<P>
"But what is it?" 
<P>
"Ah!" said my uncle, rejoicing and expanding.  "What IS it? 
That's what you got to ask?  What won't it be?"  He dug me
violently in what he supposed to be my ribs.  "George," he
cried--"George, watch this place!  There's more to follow."  
<P>
And that was all I could get from him.
<P>
That, I believe, was the very first time that the words
Tono-Bungay ever heard on earth--unless my uncle indulged in
monologues in his chamber--a highly probable thing.  Its
utterance certainly did not seem to me at the time to mark any
sort of epoch, and had I been told this word was the Open Sesame
to whatever pride and pleasure the grimy front of London hid from
us that evening, I should have laughed aloud.
<P>
"Coming now to business," I said after a pause, and with a chill
sense of effort; and I opened the question of his trust.
<P>
My uncle sighed, and leant back in his chair.  "I wish I could
make all this business as clear to you as it is to me," he said. 
"However--Go on! Say what you have to say."  
<P>
VII
<P>
After I left my uncle that evening I gave way to a feeling of
profound depression.  My uncle and aunt seemed to me to be
leading--I have already used the word too often, but I must use
it again--DINGY lives. They seemed to be adrift in a limitless
crowd of dingy people, wearing shabby clothes, living
uncomfortably in shabby second-hand houses, going to and fro on
pavements that had always a thin veneer of greasy, slippery mud,
under grey skies that showed no gleam of hope of anything for
them but dinginess until they died.  It seemed absolutely clear
to me that my mother's little savings had been swallowed up and
that my own prospect was all too certainly to drop into and be
swallowed  up myself sooner or later by this dingy London ocean. 
The London that was to be an adventurous escape from the slumber
of Wimblehurst, had vanished from my dreams.  I saw my uncle
pointing to the houses in Park Lane and showing a frayed
shirt-cuff as he did so.  I heard my aunt: "I'm to ride in my
carriage then.  So he old says."  
<P>
My feelings towards my uncle were extraordinarily mixed.  I was
intensely sorry not only for my aunt Susan but for him--for it
seemed indisputable that as they were living then so they must go
on--and at the same time I was angry with the garrulous vanity
and illness that had elipped all my chance of independent study,
and imprisoned her in those grey apartments.  When I got back to
Wimblehurst I allowed myself to write him a boyishly sarcastic
and sincerely bitter letter.  He never replied.  Then, believing
it to be the only way of escape for me, I set myself far more
grimly and resolutely to my studies than I had ever done before. 
After a time I wrote to him in more moderate terms, and he
answered me evasively.  And then I tried to dismiss him from my
mind and went on working.
<P>
Yes, that first raid upon London under the moist and chilly
depression of January had an immense effect upon me.  It was for
me an epoch-making disappointment.  I had thought of London as a
large, free, welcoming, adventurous place, and I saw it slovenly
and harsh and irresponsive.
<P>
I did not realise at all what human things might be found behind
those grey frontages, what weakness that whole forbidding facade
might presently confess.  It is the constant error of youth to
over-estimate the Will in things.  I did not see that the dirt,
the discouragement,  the discomfort of London could be due simply
to the fact that London was a witless old giantess of a town, too
slack and stupid to keep herself clean and maintain a brave face
to the word.  No! I suffered from the sort of illusion that burnt
witches in the seventeenth century.  I endued her grubby disorder
with a sinister and magnificent quality of intention.
<P>
And my uncle's gestures and promises filled me with doubt and a
sort of fear for him.  He seemed to me a lost little creature,
too silly to be silent, in a vast implacable condemnation.  I was
full of pity and a sort of tenderness for my aunt Susan, who was
doomed to follow his erratic fortunes mocked by his grandiloquent
promises.
<P>
I was to learn better.  But I worked with the terror of the grim
underside of London in my soul during all my last year at
Wimblehurst.
