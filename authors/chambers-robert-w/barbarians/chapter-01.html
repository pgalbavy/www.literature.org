<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>So this is what happened to the dozen-odd malcontents who could
no longer stand the dirty business in Europe and the dirtier politicians
at home.</p>

<p>There was treachery in the Senate, treason in the House. A plague
of liars infested the Republic; the land was rotting with plots.</p>

<p>But if the authorities at Washington remained incredulous, stunned
into impotency, while the din of murder filled the world, a few
mere men, fed up on the mess, sickened while awaiting executive
galvanization, and started east to purge their souls.</p>

<p>They came from the four quarters of the continent, drawn to the
decks of the mule transport by a common sickness and a common
necessity. Only two among them had ever before met. They represented
all sorts, classes, degrees of education and of ignorance, drawn
to a common rendezvous by coincidental nausea incident to the
temporary stupidity and poltroonery of those supposed to represent
them in the Congress of the Great Republic.</p>

<p>The rendezvous was a mule transport reeking with its cargo, still
tied up to the sun-scorched wharf where scores of loungers loafed
and gazed up at the rail and exchanged badinage with the supercargo.</p>

<p>The supercargo consisted of this dozen-odd fed-up ones&mdash;eight
Americans, three Frenchmen and one Belgian.</p>

<p>There was a young soldier of fortune named Carfax, recently discharged
from the Pennsylvania State Constabulary, who seemed to feel rather
sure of a commission in the British service.</p>

<p>Beside him, leaning on the blistering rail, stood a self-possessed
young man named Harry Stent. He had been educated abroad; his
means were ample; his time his own. He had shot all kinds of big
game except a Hun, he told another young fellow&mdash;a civil engineer&mdash;who
stood at his left and whose name was Jim Brown.</p>

<p>A youth on crutches, passing along the deck behind them, lingered,
listening to the conversation, slightly amused at Stent’s game
list and his further ambition to bag a Boche.</p>

<p>The young man’s lameness resulted from a trench acquaintance
with the game which Stent desired to hunt. His regiment had been,
and still was, the 2nd Foreign Legion. He was on his way back,
now, to finish his convalescence in his old home in Finistère.
He had been a writer of stories for children. His name was Jacques
Wayland.</p>

<p>As he turned away from the group at the rail, still amused, a
man advancing aft spoke to him by name, and he recognized an American
painter whom he had met in Brittany.</p>

<p>"You, Neeland?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I’m fed up with watchful waiting."</p>

<p>"Where are you bound, ultimately?"</p>

<p>"I’ve a hint that an Overseas unit can use me. And you, Wayland?"</p>

<p>"Going to my old home in Finistère where I’ll get well, I hope."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Second Foreign."</p>

<p>"Oh. Get that leg in the trenches?" inquired Neeland.</p>

<p>"Yes. Came over to recuperate. But Finistère calls me. I’ve <em>got</em>
to smell the sea off Eryx before I can get well."</p>

<p>A pleasant-faced, middle-aged man, who stood near, turned his
head and cast a professionally appraising glance at the young
fellow on crutches.</p>

<p>His name was Vail; he was a physician. It did not seem to him
that there was much chance for the lame man’s very rapid recovery.</p>

<p>Three muleteers came on deck from below&mdash;all young men, all talking
in loud, careless voices. They wore uniforms of khaki resembling
the regular service uniform. They had no right to these uniforms.</p>

<p>One of these young men had invented the costume. His name was
Jack Burley. His two comrades were, respectively, "Sticky" Smith
and "Kid" Glenn. Both had figured in the squared circle. All three
were fed up. They desired to wallop something, even if it were
only a leather-rumped mule.</p>

<p>Four other men completed the supercargo&mdash;three French youths
who were returning for military duty and one Belgian. They had
been waiters in New York. They also were fed up with the administration.
They kept by themselves during the voyage. Nobody ever learned
their names. They left the transport at Calais, reported, and
were lost to sight in the flood of young men flowing toward the
trenches.</p>

<p>They completed the odd dozen of fed-up ones who sailed that day
on the suffocating mule transport in quest of something they needed
but could not find in America&mdash;something that lay somewhere amid
flaming obscurity in that hell of murder beyond the Somme&mdash;their
souls’ salvation perhaps.</p>

<p>Twelve fed-up men went. And what happened to all except the four
French youths is known. Fate laid a guiding hand on the shoulder
of Carfax and gave him a gentle shove toward the Vosges. Destiny
linked arms with Stent and Brown and led them toward Italy. Wayland’s
rendezvous with Old Man Death was in Finistère. Neeland sailed
with an army corps, but Chance met him at Lorient and led him
into the strangest paths a young man ever travelled.</p>

<p>As for Sticky Smith, Kid Glenn and Jack Burley, they were muleteers.
Or thought they were. A muleteer has to do with mules. Nothing
else is supposed to concern him.</p>

<p>But into the lives of these three muleteers came things never
dreamed of in their philosophy&mdash;never imagined by them even in
their cups.</p>

<p>As for the others, Carfax, Brown, Stent, Wayland, Neeland, this
is what happened to each one of them. But the episode of Carfax
comes first. It happened somewhere north of the neutral Alpine
region where the Vosges shoulder their way between France and
Germany.</p>

<p>After he had exchanged a dozen words with a staff officer, he
began to realize, vaguely, that he was done in.</p>
