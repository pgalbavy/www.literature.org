<p>(Stubb solus, and mending a brace.)
</p>
<p>Ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!--I've been thinking
over it ever since, and that ha, ha's the final consequence.
Why so?  Because a laugh's the wisest, easiest answer to all
that's queer; and come what will, one comfort's always left--
that unfailing comfort is, it's all predestinated.
I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but to my poor eye
Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt.
Be sure the old Mogul has fixed him, too.  I twigged it, knew it;
had had the gift, might readily have prophesied it--for when I
clapped my eye upon his skull I saw it.  Well, Stubb, wise Stubb--
that's my title--well, Stubb, what of it, Stubb?  Here's a carcase.
I know not all that may be coming, but be it what it will,
I'll go to it laughing.  Such a waggish leering as lurks
in all your horribles!  I feel funny.  Fa, la! lirra, skirra!
What's my juicy little pear at home doing now?  Crying its eyes out?--
Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say,
gay as a frigate's pennant, and so am I--fa, la! lirra, skirra!  Oh--
</p><pre>
         We'll drink to-night with hearts as light,
           To love, as gay and fleeting
         As bubbles that swim, on the beaker's brim,
           And break on the lips while meeting.</pre>

<p>A brave stave that--who calls?  Mr. Starbuck?  Aye, aye, sir--
(Aside) he's my superior, he has his too, if I'm not mistaken.--
Aye, aye, sir, just through with this job--coming.
