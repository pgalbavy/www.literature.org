<p>After the unceremonious flight of Mr. Perkins, the whites gathered
around the Mohawk and expressed a fear that their little joke
had resulted in the loss of the boat which the frightened settler
was about to place in their possession. But the Indian assured
them there was no loss on that account, as he knew the precise
point where, if there was any boat within reach, it would be found.
He proved the truth of what he said by leading them to the shore
of the river, where, sure enough, the very thing for which they
were looking was discovered.</p>

<p>"I feel like forgiving Ike for all those tremendous yarns he
told us," said Clinton, when the prize was found.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think he has suffered any harm beyond a good scaring,
which he deserved," added Rosa, who enjoyed the discomfiture of
the settler as much as did the Mohawk himself.</p>

<p>When they came to examine the vessel more carefully, however,
there was some disappointment; for, instead of being a neat, clean
canoe, like the one in which the girl had spent a portion of the
day, it was a very ordinary structure, known along the rivers
of the eastern part of the country as a "scow," and which under
any circumstances was incapable of any speed. It was not propelled
in the same manner as a canoe, the only implement being a long
pole, so that if they should happen to get beyond their depth,
they would be totally at sea. The only good quality it appeared
to possess was that it was perfectly tight,&mdash;a quality not often
seen in crafts of its class,&mdash;and the bottom was without a drop
of water. Ned and Jo were so disappointed in the boat that they
proposed, in the same breath, that they should look further before
making the attempt to reach the other side.</p>

<p>"Suppose we were seen by Colonel Butler or any of his men," said
Jo. "We would be at their mercy. It strikes me as very likely
that we may encounter them, and what will we do, with nothing
but a pole to push the old thing through the water?"</p>

<p>"I am of the same opinion," said Ned. "It will be a hard task
to work our passage over, any way, not to mention the danger of
being seen by some of the Iroquois. What do you think, Rosa?"</p>

<p>"I don't fancy a voyage in such a vessel; but the river is not
very wide, and I am afraid that if we stop to hunt up another,
to-morrow morning will find us on this side of the Susquehanna."</p>

<p>While these words were passing between the three, the Mohawk
stood somewhat apart, silent, grim, and listening. He appeared
interested in what was said, but showed no inclination to say
anything until directly appealed to.</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied to trust yourself in such a craft?" asked
Jo, as he faced the silent one. "Tell us what you think of it."</p>

<p>They were now entirely out of the forest, so that the faint light
of the moon enabled them to see each other's faces quite well.
When Lena-Wingo was appealed to, it was natural that the others
should look him full in the face and, as they did so, each saw
the old grin with which they were becoming so familiar.</p>

<p>"Lena-Wingo say nothing," was the unexpected reply of their guide,
who still leaned on the pole as if waiting for the others to finish
their discussion and enter the boat.</p>

<p>"But you must say something," persisted Jo; "you don't suppose
we are going to let our haste to cross blind us to the means we
use."</p>

<p>"If want to go over t'other side, Lena-Wingo push over&mdash;if don't
want to go in boat, Lena-Wingo wait and get t'other boat."</p>

<p>This answer was hardly more satisfactory than the first, and
Jo refused to accept it as an answer at all.</p>

<p>"We aren't going to let you get out that way," continued the
young scout; "we want a reply to the question I put to you."</p>

<p>Without relaxing the broad grin on his painted face, the Mohawk
said:</p>

<p>"Lena-Wingo take over in this boat, if want to go."</p>

<p>Jo was half angry, and was on the point of saying something impatient,
when his sister interfered.</p>

<p>"Lena-Wingo has answered your question, Jo; he says that he will
take us across in this boat, if we want him to, and I'm sure that
is as plain an answer as any one could ask for."</p>

<p>"It isn't as clear as I want, but if you are satisfied I'm certain
that Ned and I are also, and have nothing more to say."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid to trust myself in this boat with him, for I
am convinced he wouldn't undertake it if he wasn't confident he
could accomplish the voyage. So go ahead, Lena-Wingo, for there
has been so much delay that we'll never get across if we wait
much longer."</p>

<p>This settled the question, and the preparations for the embarkation
followed immediately. The scow was shoved off a little from the
shore, so that the combined weight would not make it too difficult
to move it. Then Rosa took her place in the furthest part, and
her brother and lover did the same. Lena-Wingo waited till all
had arranged themselves, when he forced the craft clear of the
land, and sprang lightly into it, as it was still moving away
into the stream.</p>

<p>The handling of a pole is not an occupation to which the Indians,
as a general thing, are trained, and it was not to be expected
that the Mohawk would display anything like the skill which he
possessed in the management of the paddle. But Lena-Wingo was
one of those individuals, occasionally seen, who seem to take
naturally to any kind of physical exercise, and he controlled
the rather awkward implement in a way that excited more than one
commendatory remark from the two youths who were watching him.</p>

<p>This species of craft is intended for water close to the land,
and always where it is shallow, so that the redman was under a
disadvantage, even with all his skill. As the pole was long enough
to touch the bottom in any portion of the stream, there was no
fear that he would not reach the other shore, provided he was
not disturbed by his enemies; but when his companions reflected
on what might take place, in case they were forced to resort to
anything like a contest with the Iroquois, they could not but
shudder, and regret that the start was made.</p>

<p>They had hardly left the land behind them when, as if by a common
impulse, all three of the whites turned their heads and gazed
doubtfully at the shore they were approaching. In the gloom of
the night it could not be seen at all, a dark wall seeming to
shut it from view. As the water deepened, the current became swifter
and the task of managing the unwieldly craft more difficult, though
it was hard to see how any one could have done better than the
Mohawk.</p>

<p>It was impossible to cross in anything like a direct line, and
it was found that they were drifting rapidly down stream. Still,
Lena-Wingo persevered in his calm, unexcited way until the middle
of the river was nearly reached, when it struck both the young
scouts that it was hardly the thing for them to sit idle in the
boat while he was toiling so manfully to work his way over. Ned
whispered to Jo that he meant to take a hand at the pole.</p>

<p>"Do so," whispered his friend back again, "and when you are tired,
I will try it, for it will tire us all pretty well before we make
the other shore. I am sure you can do as well as he."</p>

<p>Ned arose at once, and stepping across the length of the swaying
craft, reached out his hand for the pole.</p>

<p>"Let me help you, Jack; there is no need of wearying yourself
out when we are doing nothing."</p>

<p>Ned expected that the Mohawk would refuse to let him interfere,
but, to his surprise, he assented at once.</p>

<p>"Take him&mdash;he ain't a paddle," replied the redman, passing the
implement over to him.</p>

<p>"You are right on that point," laughed the youth as he accepted
it from him, and almost immediately found the truth of the declaration
verified in his own experience.</p>

<p>They were in deeper water than they supposed, the depth having
increased very rapidly in the last few minutes. But Clinton went
at the work manfully, with the determination to do all he could
for the "good of the cause."</p>
