<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>They were married while the flowers were knee-deep over the sunny slopes
and mesas, and the canyons gulfs of color and fragrance, and went for
their first moon together to a far high mountain valley hidden among
wooded peaks, with a clear lake for its central jewel.
</p>
<p>A month of heaven; while wave on wave of perfect rest and
world-forgetting oblivion rolled over both their hearts.
</p><p>They swam together in the dawn-flushed lake, seeing the morning mists
float up from the silver surface, breaking the still reflection of thick
trees and rosy clouds, rejoicing in the level shafts of forest filtered
sunlight. They played and ran like children, rejoiced over their picnic
meals; lay flat among the crowding flowers and slept under the tender
starlight.
</p><p>“I don't see,” said her lover, “but that my strenuous Amazon is just as
much a woman as--as any woman!”
</p><p>“Who ever said I wasn't?” quoth Diantha demurely.
</p><p>A month of perfect happiness. It was so short it seemed but a moment;
so long in its rich perfection that they both agreed if life brought no
further joy this was Enough.
</p><p>Then they came down from the mountains and began living.
</p><hr/>
<p>Day service is not so easily arranged on a ranch some miles from town.
They tried it for a while, the new runabout car bringing out a girl in
the morning early, and taking Diantha in to her office.
</p><p>But motor cars are not infallible; and if it met with any accident there
was delay at both ends, and more or less friction.
</p><p>Then Diantha engaged a first-class Oriental gentleman, well recommended
by the “vegetable Chinaman,” on their own place. This was extremely
satisfactory; he did the work well, and was in all ways reliable;
but there arose in the town a current of malicious criticism and
protest--that she “did not live up to her principles.”
</p><p>To this she paid no attention; her work was now too well planted, too
increasingly prosperous to be weakened by small sneers.
</p><p>Her mother, growing plumper now, thriving continuously in her new
lines of work, kept the hotel under her immediate management, and
did bookkeeping for the whole concern. New Union Home ran itself, and
articles were written about it in magazines; so that here and there
in other cities similar clubs were started, with varying success. The
restaurant was increasingly popular; Diantha's cooks were highly skilled
and handsomely paid, and from the cheap lunch to the expensive banquet
they gave satisfaction.
</p><p>But the “c. f. d.” was the darling of her heart, and it prospered
exceedingly. “There is no advertisement like a pleased customer,” and
her pleased customers grew in numbers and in enthusiasm. Family after
family learned to prize the cleanliness and quiet, the odorlessness and
flylessness of a home without a kitchen, and their questioning guests
were converted by the excellent of the meals.
</p><p>Critical women learned at last that a competent cook can really produce
better food than an incompetent one; albeit without the sanctity of the
home.
</p><p>“Sanctity of your bootstraps!” protested one irascible gentleman. “Such
talk is all nonsense! I don't want <u>sacred</u> meals--I want good ones--and
I'm getting them, at last!”
</p><p>“We don't brag about 'home brewing' any more,” said another, “or
'home tailoring,' or 'home shoemaking.' Why all this talk about 'home
cooking'?”
</p><p>What pleased the men most was not only the good food, but its clock-work
regularity; and not only the reduced bills but the increased health and
happiness of their wives. Domestic bliss increased in Orchardina, and
the doctors were more rigidly confined to the patronage of tourists.
</p><p>Ross Warden did his best. Under the merciless friendliness of Mr.
Thaddler he had been brought to see that Diantha had a right to do this
if she would, and that he had no right to prevent her; but he did not
like it any the better.
</p><p>When she rolled away in her little car in the bright, sweet mornings, a
light went out of the day for him. He wanted her there, in the home--his
home--his wife--even when he was not in it himself. And in this
particular case it was harder than for most men, because he was in the
house a good deal, in his study, with no better company than a polite
Chinaman some distance off.
</p><p>It was by no means easy for Diantha, either. To leave him tugged at
her heart-strings, as it did at his; and if he had to struggle with
inherited feelings and acquired traditions, still more was she beset
with an unexpected uprising of sentiments and desires she had never
dreamed of feeling.
</p><p>With marriage, love, happiness came an overwhelming instinct of
service--personal service. She wanted to wait on him, loved to do it;
regarded Wang Fu with positive jealousy when he brought in the coffee
and Ross praised it. She had a sense of treason, of neglected duty, as
she left the flower-crowned cottage, day by day.
</p><p>But she left it, she plunged into her work, she schooled herself
religiously.
</p><p>“Shame on you!” she berated herself. “Now--<u>now</u> that you've got
everything on earth--to weaken! You could stand unhappiness; can't you
stand happiness?” And she strove with herself; and kept on with her
work.
</p><p>After all, the happiness was presently diluted by the pressure of this
blank wall between them. She came home, eager, loving, delighted to
be with him again. He received her with no complaint or criticism, but
always an unspoken, perhaps imagined, sense of protest. She was full of
loving enthusiasm about his work, and he would dilate upon his harassed
guinea-pigs and their development with high satisfaction.
</p><p>But he never could bring himself to ask about her labors with any
genuine approval; she was keenly sensitive to his dislike for the
subject, and so it was ignored between them, or treated by him in a vein
of humor with which he strove to cover his real feeling.
</p><p>When, before many months were over, the crowning triumph of her effort
revealed itself, her joy and pride held this bitter drop--he did not
sympathize--did not approve. Still, it was a great glory.
</p><p>The New York Company announced the completion of their work and the
<u>Hotel del las Casas</u> was opened to public inspection. “House of the
Houses! That's a fine name!” said some disparagingly; but, at any
rate, it seemed appropriate. The big estate was one rich garden, more
picturesque, more dreamily beautiful, than the American commercial mind
was usually able to compass, even when possessed of millions. The hotel
of itself was a pleasure palace--wholly unostentatious, full of gaiety
and charm, offering lovely chambers for guests and residents, and every
opportunity for healthful amusement. There was the rare luxury of a big
swimming-pool; there were billiard rooms, card rooms, reading rooms,
lounging rooms and dancing rooms of satisfying extent.
</p><p>Outside there were tennis-courts, badminton, roque, even croquet; and
the wide roof was a garden of Babylon, a Court of the Stars, with views
of purple mountains, fair, wide valley and far-flashing rim of sea.
Around it, each in its own hedged garden, nestled “Las Casas”--the
Houses--twenty in number, with winding shaded paths, groups of rare
trees, a wilderness of flowers, between and about them. In one corner
was a playground for children--a wall around this, that they might
shout in freedom; and the nursery thereby gave every provision for the
happiness and safety of the little ones.
</p><p>The people poured along the winding walls, entered the pretty cottages,
were much impressed by a little flock of well-floored tents in another
corner, but came back with Ohs! and Ahs! of delight to the large
building in the Avenue.
</p><p>Diantha went all over the place, inch by inch, her eyes widening with
admiration; Mr. and Mrs. Porne and Mrs. Weatherstone with her. She
enjoyed the serene, well-planned beauty of the whole; approved heartily
of the cottages, each one a little different, each charming in its
quiet privacy, admired the plentiful arrangements for pleasure and gay
association; but her professional soul blazed with enthusiasm over the
great kitchens, clean as a hospital, glittering in glass and copper and
cool tiling, with the swift, sure electric stove.
</p><p>The fuel all went into a small, solidly built power house, and came out
in light and heat and force for the whole square.
</p><p>Diantha sighed in absolute appreciation.
</p><p>“Fine, isn't it?” said Mr. Porne.
</p><p>“How do you like the architecture?” asked Mrs. Porne.
</p><p>“What do you think of my investment?” said Mrs. Weatherstone. Diantha
stopped in her tracks and looked from one to the other of them.
</p><p>“Fact. I control the stock--I'm president of the Hotel del las Casas
Company. Our friends here have stock in it, too, and more that you don't
know. We think it's going to be a paying concern. But if you can make
it go, my dear, as I think you will, you can buy us all out and own the
whole outfit!”
</p><p>It took some time to explain all this, but the facts were visible
enough.
</p><p>“Nothing remarkable at all,” said Mrs. Weatherstone. “Here's Astor with
three big hotels on his hands--why shouldn't I have one to play with?
And I've got to employ <u>somebody</u> to manage it!”
</p><hr/>
<p>Within a year of her marriage Diantha was at the head of this pleasing
Centre of Housekeeping. She kept the hotel itself so that it was a joy
to all its patrons; she kept the little houses homes of pure delight for
those who were so fortunate as to hold them; and she kept up her “c.
f. d.” business till it grew so large she had to have quite a fleet of
delivery wagons.
</p><p>Orchardina basked and prospered; its citizens found their homes happier
and less expensive than ever before, and its citizenesses began to wake
up and to do things worth while.
</p><hr/>
<p>Two years, and there was a small Ross Warden born.
</p><p>She loved it, nursed it, and ran her business at long range for some
six months. But then she brought nurse and child to the hotel with her,
placed them in the cool, airy nursery in the garden, and varied her busy
day with still hours by herself--the baby in her arms.
</p><p>Back they came together before supper, and found unbroken joy and peace
in the quiet of home; but always in the background was the current of
Ross' unspoken disapproval.
</p><p>Three years, four years.
</p><p>There were three babies now; Diantha was a splendid woman of thirty,
handsome and strong, pre-eminently successful--and yet, there were times
when she found it in her heart to envy the most ordinary people who
loved and quarreled and made up in the little outlying ranch houses
along the road; they had nothing between them, at least.
</p><p>Meantime in the friendly opportunities of Orchardina society, added to
by the unexampled possibilities of Las Casas (and they did not scorn
this hotel nor Diantha's position in it), the three older Miss Wardens
had married. Two of them preferred “the good old way,” but one tried the
“d. s.” and the “c. f. d.” and liked them well.
</p><p>Dora amazed and displeased her family, as soon as she was of age, by
frankly going over to Diantha's side and learning bookkeeping. She
became an excellent accountant and bade fair to become an expert manager
soon.
</p><p>Ross had prospered in his work. It may be that the element of
dissatisfaction in his married life spurred him on, while the unusual
opportunities of his ranch allowed free effort. He had always held that
the “non-transmissability of acquired traits” was not established by
any number of curtailed mice or crop-eared rats. “A mutilation is not
an acquired trait,” he protested. “An acquired trait is one gained by
exercise; it modifies the whole organism. It must have an effect on the
race. We expect the sons of a line of soldiers to inherit their fathers'
courage--perhaps his habit of obedience--but not his wooden leg.”
</p><p>To establish his views he selected from a fine family of guinea-pigs two
pair; set the one, Pair A, in conditions of ordinary guinea-pig bliss,
and subjected the other, Pair B, to a course of discipline. They were
trained to run. They, and their descendants after them, pair following
on pair; first with slow-turning wheels as in squirrel cages, the wheel
inexorably going, machine-driven, and the luckless little gluttons
having to move on, for gradually increasing periods of time, at
gradually increasing speeds. Pair A and their progeny were sheltered
and fed, but the rod was spared; Pair B were as the guests at
“Muldoon's”--they had to exercise. With scientific patience and
ingenuity, he devised mechanical surroundings which made them jump
increasing spaces, which made them run always a little faster and a
little farther; and he kept a record as carefully as if these little
sheds were racing stables for a king.
</p><p>Several centuries of guinea-pig time went by; generation after
generation of healthy guinea-pigs passed under his modifying hands;
and after some five years he had in one small yard a fine group of the
descendants of his gall-fed pair, and in another the offspring of
the trained ones; nimble, swift, as different from the first as the
razor-backed pig of the forest from the fatted porkers in the sty.
He set them to race--the young untrained specimens of these distant
cousins--and the hare ran away from the tortoise completely.
</p><p>Great zoologists and biologists came to see him, studied, fingered,
poked, and examined the records; argued and disbelieved--and saw them
run.
</p><p>“It is natural selection,” they said. “It profited them to run.”
</p><p>“Not at all,” said he. “They were fed and cared for alike, with no gain
from running.”
</p><p>“It was artificial selection,” they said. “You picked out the speediest
for your training.”
</p><p>“Not at all,” said he. “I took always any healthy pair from the trained
parents and from the untrained ones--quite late in life, you understand,
as guinea-pigs go.”
</p><p>Anyhow, there were the pigs; and he took little specialized piglets
scarce weaned, and pitted them against piglets of the untrained lot--and
they outran them in a race for “Mama.” Wherefore Mr. Ross Warden found
himself famous of a sudden; and all over the scientific world the
Wiesmanian controversy raged anew. He was invited to deliver a lecture
before some most learned societies abroad, and in several important
centers at home, and went, rejoicing.
</p><p>Diantha was glad for him from the bottom of her heart, and proud of him
through and through. She thoroughly appreciated his sturdy opposition to
such a weight of authority; his long patience, his careful, steady work.
She was left in full swing with her big business, busy and successful,
honored and liked by all the town--practically--and quite independent of
the small fraction which still disapproved. Some people always will. She
was happy, too, in her babies--very happy.
</p><p>The Hotel del las Casas was a triumph.
</p><p>Diantha owned it now, and Mrs. Weatherstone built others, in other
places, at a large profit.
</p><p>Mrs. Warden went to live with Cora in the town. Cora had more time to
entertain her--as she was the one who profited by her sister-in-law's
general services.
</p><p>Diantha sat in friendly talk with Mrs. Weatherstone one quiet day, and
admitted that she had no cause for complaint.
</p><p>“And yet--?” said her friend.
</p><p>Young Mrs. Warden smiled. “There's no keeping anything from you, is
there? Yes--you're right. I'm not quite satisfied. I suppose I ought not
to care--but you see, I love him so! I want him to <u>approve</u> of me!--not
just put up with it, and bear it! I want him to <u>feel</u> with me--to care.
It is awful to know that all this big life of mine is just a mistake to
him--that he condemns it in his heart.”
</p><p>“But you knew this from the beginning, my dear, didn't you?”
</p><p>“Yes--I knew it--but it is different now. You know when you are
<u>married</u>--”
</p><p>Mrs. Weatherstone looked far away through the wide window. “I do know,”
 she said.
</p><p>Diantha reached a strong hand to clasp her friend's. “I wish I could
give it to you,” she said. “You have done so much for me! So much! You
have poured out your money like water!”
</p><p>“My money! Well I like that!” said Mrs. Weatherstone. “I have taken my
money out of five and seven per cent investments, and put it into ten
per cent ones, that's all. Shall I never make you realize that I am a
richer woman because of you, Diantha Bell Warden! So don't try to be
grateful--I won't have it! Your work has <u>paid</u> remember--paid me as
well as you; and lots of other folks beside. You know there are eighteen
good imitations of Union House running now, in different cities, and
three 'Las Casas!' all succeeding--and the papers are talking about the
dangers of a Cooked Food Trust!”
</p><p>They were friends old and tried, and happy in mutual affection. Diantha
had many now, though none quite so dear. Her parents were contented--her
brother and sister doing well--her children throve and grew and found
Mama a joy they never had enough of.
</p><p>Yet still in her heart of hearts she was not wholly happy.
</p><hr/>
<p>Then one night came by the last mail, a thick letter from Ross--thicker
than usual. She opened it in her room alone, their room--to which they
had come so joyously five years ago.
</p><p>He told her of his journeying, his lectures, his controversies and
triumphs; rather briefly--and then:
</p><p>“My darling, I have learned something at last, on my travels, which
will interest you, I fancy, more than the potential speed of all the
guinea-pigs in the world, and its transmissability.
</p><p>“From what I hear about you in foreign lands; from what I read about you
wherever I go; and, even more, from what I see, as a visitor, in many
families; I have at last begun to grasp the nature and importance of
your work.
</p><p>“As a man of science I must accept any truth when it is once clearly
seen; and, though I've been a long time about it, I do see at last what
brave, strong, valuable work you have been doing for the world. Doing it
scientifically, too. Your figures are quoted, your records studied, your
example followed. You have established certain truths in the business of
living which are of importance to the race. As a student I recognize and
appreciate your work. As man to man I'm proud of you--tremendously proud
of you. As your husband! Ah! my love! I am coming back to you--coming
soon, coming with my Whole Heart, Yours! Just wait, My Darling, till I
get back to you!
</p><p>“Your Lover and Husband.”
</p><p>Diantha held the letter close, with hands that shook a little. She
kissed it--kissed it hard, over and over--not improving its appearance
as a piece of polite correspondence.
</p><p>Then she gave way to an overmastering burst of feeling, and knelt down
by the wide bed, burying her face there, the letter still held fast. It
was a funny prayer, if any human ear had heard it.
</p><p>“Thank you!” was all she said, with long, deep sobbing sighs between.
“Thank you!--O--thank you!”
