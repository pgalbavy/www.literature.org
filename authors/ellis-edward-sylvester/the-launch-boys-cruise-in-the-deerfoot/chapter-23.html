<p>Mike Murphy would have given the launch a speed of fifty miles
an hour had it been in his power, so impatient was he to reach
the thieves who had not only stolen the launch, but had insulted
and defied him. He would not pause to secure the <em>Deerfoot</em>,
but would leap ashore the instant he was within reach of it.</p>

<p>Taunting and gibing him, the miscreants waited until hardly a
dozen yards separated them. Then they wheeled about and dashed
into the woods as fast as they could go! Though there were two
and each was older than he, they dared not meet him in fair fight!</p>

<p>Mike could have cried with rage and disappointment. He shouted
his reproaches, hoping to anger them into coming back and standing
their ground, and kept the launch going until her bow nearly touched
the bank. Had there been any possibility of success, he would
have made after them. But they buried themselves among the trees
and he never saw them again.</p>

<p>During those brief moments he had so plain a sight of their faces
that he would have recognized them anywhere. He was surprised
to know that he had never seen either before. They were not the
couple with whom he and Alvin Landon had had the encounter some
nights previous and who, both believed, were the thieves of the
motor boat. Not to make a mystery of a comparatively unimportant
matter, I may say that facts which afterward came to light showed
that these young men had nothing to do with the robbery of the
post offices in southern Maine, nor, so far as known, with any
other crime, excepting the theft of the <em>Deerfoot</em>. Even
in taking that they did not intend to keep or try to sell it.
They were a couple of "city chaps" who, happening upon the craft
by accident, yielded to the temptation to play a practical joke
upon the unknown owners. Both had some knowledge of motor boating,
and knowing that instant measures would be taken to recover the
property, and beginning also to feel some misgivings as to the
consequences, they ran into the cove with the intention of abandoning
the <em>Deerfoot</em>, to be found sooner or later by the right
parties. They were but a short distance off when the sound of
the exhaust told them that some one had come aboard and they hastened
back to learn who it was. Uncertain whether Mike Murphy had any
more right to it than themselves they opened a bombardment, but
when he so promptly accepted their challenge, they wasted no time
in effecting a change of base, which carried them far beyond harm.</p>

<p>Convinced that it was out of his power to bring the couple to
account, Mike once more headed for the mouth of the small bay.
He did not forget the boatman and swerved in to where he was patiently
waiting. The youth was in high spirits over his success, barring
his latest disappointment, and ran in quite close to the man.</p>

<p>"I won't naad ye," he called, "but ye've airned yer fee all the
same."</p>

<p>Taking a half dollar from his pocket, Mike stood up.</p>

<p>"Howld yersilf riddy!" he said, motioning to toss the coin to
him.</p>

<p>The boatman sprang to his feet and eagerly held his bony hands
outspread. When the couple were nearest Mike tossed the silver
piece, and he deftly caught it, though the motion of the launch
came within a hair of carrying the money beyond reach.</p>

<p>"Thank you kindly; you're a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Which the same is what all me acquaintances remark whin they
get a squar' look at me winsome countenance," said Mike, settling
back in his seat.</p>

<p>Now that he was once more plowing the waters of the broad Sheepscot,
he spent a minute or two debating with himself what he ought to
do.</p>

<p>"Fortinitly I haven't any Captain or mate to consult&mdash;being that
I'm both."</p>

<p>His first thought was to head up the river in quest of his friends,
but he did not know where to look for them. They would have left
Charmount long before he could reach that point, and it would
have taken many hours to stop at all the intermediate landings
in the effort to trace them. Moreover, a not unnatural longing
came over him to make the utmost of the privilege at his command.
A thrilling pride filled him when he realized that he was the
sole occupant of the <em>Deerfoot</em>, with no one to say nay
to his plans. The handsome craft was obedient to his slightest
whim and he could go whither he chose. The engine was working
with perfect smoothness, and though lacking full practical knowledge,
he believed he could run hither and yon for several days without
trouble. Furthermore, his waggish disposition manifested itself.</p>

<p>"I might as well give Alvin and Chester a run fur their money;
they let the boat get away from them and it's mesilf that has
the chance to taich them a big moral lesson; so here goes, as
me second cousin said whin the bull throwed him over the fence."</p>

<p>Midway in the channel, Mike turned the bow of the launch southward,
leaving the Isle of Springs well to the left. A little later he
shot past McMahans on his right, then Dog Fish Head opposite,
followed by Hendrick Light, Cedarbrush Island, Cat Ledges and
finally Lower Mark.</p>

<p>He was now in Sheepscot Bay, fully four miles across. Although
he did not know the names of the points and islands, his close
study of the map had given him a general knowledge and he knew
precisely where he was when he glided around Cape Newagen, which,
as we remember, is the most southern reach of the big island of
Southport. There his parents lived and Alvin and Chester made
their summer home. Running close in shore he coasted northward
and soon saw plainly the dwelling of Chester Haynes, but no person
was in sight. A little farther the handsome residence of Mr. Landon&mdash;that
is, when he chose to spend a few weeks there&mdash;rose to view.</p>

<p>Mike preferred that his father should not see him, for he feared
the consequences, but it so happened that the old gentleman had
come down to the shore to fish and was seated on the rocks thus
engaged. The very moment in which he caught sight of the launch
he recognized it and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Hello, dad!" shouted Mike, waving his hand at him.</p>

<p>"Are ye alone?" asked the astonished parent.</p>

<p>"That's what I am, as yer brother said whin he fell overboard."</p>

<p>"Where are the byes?"</p>

<p>"I left them up the river; they'll be back agin one of these
days."</p>

<p>Inasmuch as Mike showed no purpose of stopping, the father thought
it time to assert his authority.</p>

<p>"What do ye maan, ye spalpeen, by such outrageous thricks? Come
right to land, and resave the whaling ye desarve. Do ye hear me?"</p>

<p>"Thank ye, dad, for yer kind permission to take a sail; it's
me intintion to return be morning or mayhap before. Don't worry,
and tell mither I'm all right."</p>

<p>"Ye'll be all right whin I lays me hands on ye!"</p>

<p>The parent flung down his line and ran leaping along the rocks
in the effort to keep abreast of the launch. He shook his fist
and shouted:</p>

<p>"Turn into land, confound ye! I'm aching to lay hands onto ye!
DO YE <em>HAAR ME</em>?"</p>

<p>"Ye always was a kind dad and I'll bring ye a pound of 'bacca
from Boothbay or Squirrel Island. Good luck to ye!"</p>

<p>And with a parting wave Mike turned away his head and gave his
attention to guiding the craft which by a freak of fortune had
come under his sole control.</p>

<p>"I wonder if it will be aisy to make dad think the motion of
the boat raised such a wind that it twisted his words so they
didn't carry right. I doubt not that him and me will be obleeged
to have a sittlement and I'll be the one to come out sicond best,
as was the case wid all the folks that I had a shindy with."</p>

<p>No wonder the Irish lad was exhilarated. He was seated in the
cockpit of the finest motor launch seen for a long time in those
waters, with his hands resting upon the wheel and the boat as
obedient to his lightest touch as a gentle horse to the rein of
its driver. The breeze caused by its swift motion made the flags
at the prow and stern flutter and whip, and now and then give
out a snapping sound. The sharp bow cut the clear cold water like
a knife, sending a fanlike spread of foam that widened and lost
itself behind the churning screw. The wind-shield guarded his
face from so much as a zephyr, and the consciousness that among
all the boats big and small in sight at varying distances, there
was not one that could hold its own with the <em>Deerfoot</em>,
was enough to stir his blood and make him shout for very joy.</p>

<p>Mike was in a varying mood. His first impulse was to make for
Boothbay Harbor, but he felt some misgiving about threading his
way among the many craft that are always anchored or moored there.
With the steamers coming and going, he might become confused over
the signals and the right of way, with disastrous results to the
launch. He had not yet learned the meaning of the toots of the
whistle which Captain Alvin gave when crossing the bow of a larger
boat, or when meeting it.</p>

<p>He was only prudent, therefore, when he turned from the larger
town and sped toward Squirrel Island. He observed the <em>Nellie
G.</em> in the act of moving aside to make room for a mail steamer
that had whistled its wishes, and half a hundred men, women and
children were gathered on the wharf, with nothing to do but to
watch the arrival and departure of boats.</p>

<p>There were so many constantly going and coming at the height
of the summer season that the only person, so far as Mike could
see, who gave him a look was Captain Williams of the <em>Nellie
G.</em> Mike had meant to land, but he feared he would become
involved in a tangle, and sheered off. Captain Williams had backed
out so far that he was brought up alongside the <em>Deerfoot</em>.
He had done so often what he was now doing that it was instinctive
on his part. He could have gone through the manoeuvre with his
eyes shut.</p>

<p>"Where are Alvin and Chester?" he asked from his little pilot
house as he was gliding past.</p>

<p>"I lift them behind. If ye maat them before I do, Captain, tell
'em I've slipped off on a little thrip to the owld counthry, but
will soon return."</p>

<p>"I'll tell them what you told me," said Captain Williams, giving
his attention to his return to the wharf.</p>
