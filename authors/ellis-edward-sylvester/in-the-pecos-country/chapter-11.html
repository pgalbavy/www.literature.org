<p>The contest of Simpson with the wonderfully supple and sinewy
Apache began and ended in a few seconds. In the most thrilling
moments the hunter did not forget his peril from outside barbarians.</p>

<p>The main war-party seeing the desperate straits of their leader,
who was liable to be shot down by a ball from the revolver, galloped
forward to his assistance, and, almost at the same moment the
dozen horsemen that had set out to head him off put in appearance,
all coming from different directions, and converging toward the
one point, where the veteran borderer was suddenly transformed
from an aggressor into a deeply imperiled fugitive.</p>

<p>It was a time for "business" of the sternest kind, and the grizzled
hunter went at it like one who understood what it meant. Rifle
and pistol were discharged, and, therefore, useless. The former
was slung over his back, and the latter was quickly jammed into
his girdle. In a twinkling he had his huge bowie in his right
hand, and, shouting to his mustang, he headed out on the prairie,
and made a dash for life and freedom.</p>

<p>At such a crisis, everything depends upon the sagacity and intelligence
of the horse. It requires something more than speed&mdash;it needs
a grasp of the "situation," upon the part of the brute, and the
guidance of his action which should result therefrom. It was in
this respect that Sut Simpson possessed an advantage which can
scarcely be appreciated. He made no attempt to guide or control
the creature he bestrode; but, bending forward upon his back and
clutching his terrible weapon in his hand, he uttered a shout,
which the mustang interpreted as an appeal to do his best, and
he proceeded to do so without an instant's hesitation.</p>

<p>Still, it was vain to try to dodge through the converging warriors
without coming in contact with them. There were too many to permit
any such performance, but the wall was not impenetrable. Like
an arrow from the bow sped the animal, and, seeing the point toward
which he was aiming, the Apaches endeavored to close the gap.
The equine fugitive did not swerve in the least, and it looked
as if he was plunging to his own destruction.</p>

<p>The scout saw it all, and made no effort to change the direction
he was pursuing. He only grasped his bowie the more tightly and
compressed his lips. There was an ugly gleam in his sharp gray
eye as he braced himself for the conflict.</p>

<p>The nose of the mustang was almost touching the head of the other
horses, when he swerved almost at right angles, and, with a tremendous
burst of speed, shot through the nearest "opening." This threw
all his enemies, by the brilliant maneuver, in his rear, and left
the clear prairie before him as a path in which to complete his
flight.</p>

<p>The space separating Sut from his enemies was too slight for
him to reach safety by one plunge. The mustang was scarcely under
way, when he was compelled to dodge as abruptly as before, and
in a trice he made a third, which was done with consummate skill,
and yet with the unavoidable result of bringing the scout in collision
with a swarthy warrior. Sut was expecting it, and, bursting like
a thunderbolt upon the howling red-skin, he drove the flashing
bowie with such prodigious force that, to repeat an old expression,
the first thing the Apache knew, he knew nothing.</p>

<p>At the moment of making the thrust, a painted warrior riding
on the opposite side struck a terrific blow with his tomahawk,
but the dextrous flirt of the hunter's head permitted the weapon
to whizz by and graze his cheek. The time was to short for him
to do any work with the knife in the other hand, quick as was
Simpson in his movements; so the tomahawk had scarcely descended
upon its harmless mission when he sent out his left hand straight
from his shoulder, like the plunge of a piston rod.</p>

<p>It struck the astonished warrior straight in his face with irresistible
force and his head went down and his heels up so suddenly that
he was knocked completely off his horse&mdash;a thing which, it may
be safely said, does not occur with an Apache or Comanche once
in a thousand times, unless it be a bullet that tumbles him to
the ground. This opened the way again and the magnificent mustang
settled down to the work of life and death.</p>

<p>Sut saw that it was impossible for any of the horsemen to throw
themselves across his track, and so he flung himself forward upon
his matchless steed and said a few words encouragingly in the
hope that it might add a particle to his speed; but that was impossible,
as the noble creature was doing his very utmost.</p>

<p>The pursuing Apaches seemed to cling to the hope of capturing
the daring scout, for they thundered away in pursuit, while he
as steadily drew away from them. Suddenly came the crack of rifles,
but Sut noticed that most of them came from a point in advance,
and he raised his head enough to learn what it meant.</p>

<p>The mustang (whether by design or accident cannot be stated)
had sped continually in the direction of New Boston, and was dashing
down toward that point. The pioneers were on the alert, and the
instant they could distinguish pursuers from pursued, they opened
on the former, with the result of tumbling several from the backs
of their steeds. This so disorganized the hot pursuit that in
the flurry of the moment the scout shot in among the group of
alarmed horses, sprang from his back, and was soon among his friends,
from whom he had been separated less than half an hour.</p>

<p>Lone Wolf seemed meditating a charge down the valley, and once
or twice a formidable number of his warriors were observed gathering
upon the slope; but the moment they were discovered such a galling
fire was poured in among them that they quickly scampered out
of range. The chief, beyond question, was infuriated by the manner
in which he had been baffled, and this fury tempted him, perhaps,
to a rash deed or two; but he speedily regained his shrewdness
and drew his warriors off.</p>

<p>A careful reconnaisance, made an hour later, failed to show a
single Apache. The entire body had departed.</p>

<p>The special errand of Sut in venturing out was to effect the
recapture of the lad. The chance of success was very desperate,
but upon that alone the scout had based his hopes. Had the opportunity
been tempting, the Apaches would have done all they could to head
off any effort in that direction, but it is often by a sudden
dash, when apparently there is no hope, that the most brilliant
successes are made. But the issue in the present case had been
a complete failure, and Sut chafed greatly under the reflection,
for everything connected with it was mortifying to him.</p>

<p>In the first place, he had been completely outwitted from beginning
to end by his old enemy, Lone Wolf. That chieftain, whom he detested
with the very intensity of hatred, had snatched up the boy under
his very nose, and made off with him. The shot that had been fired
to bring the war-chief to earth failed in its purpose, and while
the hunter was forcing him into a corner he awoke to the fact
that he was there himself, and it was only by a hair's breadth
that he succeeded in saving his bacon.</p>

<p>"But Sut Simpson don't give up the job just yet," said he, the
next morning, in discussing the situation with Barnwell and the
leading pioneers. "That younker has got himself in a scrape, through
no fault of his own, and onless he gets a lift there's no show
for his pullin' out of it."</p>

<p>"Mickey O'Rooney is still absent, and he may be able to help
you."</p>

<p>But Sut shook his head. He saw no prospect of any appreciable
assistance from that quarter.</p>

<p>"He's a good fellow, and I like him; but he'll have all he can
do to take care of himself. When a chap undertakes to go it alone
in these parts, he must never wink both eyes at the same time."</p>

<p>"Suppose the Irishman has been killed?" ventured one of the men,
who was somewhat shaken up by the events of the night before.
"It seems to me that it is very probable."</p>

<p>"You're right," replied Sut, as if he were discussing the question
of stock. "Very likely he's gone under. We've all got to come
to it sooner or later, and what's the odds if one's a little ahead
of the other?"</p>

<p>By this time the speaker was astride his mustang, which was as
fresh and eager as though he had not been subjected to the tremendous
strain of the night before. The little party of pioneers had come
to look upon the scout as indispensable to their safety. His timely
warning of the coming of the Apaches had saved them from a frightful
massacre, and he now gave them some parting advice, which could
not be disregarded.</p>

<p>"You cleaned 'em out this time," said he, as he sat on his mustang,
hesitating a few minutes, until several of the sentinels that
had been sent out could come in with their reports; "you cleaned
them out this time," he repeated, "but don't you think on that
account they'll stay away. As I observed to you some time ago,
I know something 'bout that varmint, and he'll be back agin, and
you kin bet your bottom dollar on it. He'll fetch a pile of the
dogs at his back, and he'll clean out this place so complete that
a fortnight from now a microscope won't be able to tell where
the town of New Boston stood."</p>

<p>"And you urge us to give over the attempt to make a settlement
here?"  remarked Barnwell, with his old cynical smile.</p>

<p>"For the present I do; I don't ax you to give it up forever,
mind, but only to wait some fifty or seventy-five years, till
I get a chance to wipe out Lone Wolf, and things become sorter
quieted down like. It's better to get out of bed than it is to
be kicked out, and you must take your choice."</p>

<p>"But we are here, and why should we not stay?"</p>

<p>"The best reason is 'cause you can't. I don't know as there's
any better. It's only fifty miles to Fort Severn, and you can
make it easy in two or three days with your teams and baggage.
You've traveled the plains long 'nough to understand how the thing
is done."</p>

<p>At this juncture the three men who had been sent out in different
directions on a reconnoissance came in with their report. One
of them had climbed the very tree in which Fred Munson had taken
refuge. This gave him an extended view of the surrounding country.
One of the others had devoted himself to a careful examination
of the river, while the third scanned the prairie in another direction.
The result in every case was the failure to detect any signs of
the Apaches.</p>

<p>Sut Simpson waved his friends a good-by and galloped up the slope,
where he took the trail of the Indians and at once set off in
quest of his young friend, who was a captive in their hands.</p>
