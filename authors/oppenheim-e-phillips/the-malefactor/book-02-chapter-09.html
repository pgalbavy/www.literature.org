<P>
Wingrave had just come in from an early gallop. His pale cheeks were slightly
flushed, and his eyes were bright. He had been riding hard to escape from
disconcerting thoughts. He looked in at the study, and found Aynesworth with a
mass of correspondence before him.
<P>
"Anything important?" he asked.
<P>
"Not yet," Aynesworth answered. "The letters marked private I have sent up to
your room. By the bye, there was something I wanted to tell you."
<P>
Wingrave closed the door.
<P>
"Well?" he said.
<P>
"I was up in the gallery of the Opera House last night," Aynesworth said,
"with a--person who saw you only once, soon after I first came to you--before
America. You were some distance away, and yet--my friend recognized you."
<P>
Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
"That, of course, is possible," he answered. "It really does not matter so
very much unless they knew me--as Wingrave Seton!"
<P>
"My friend," Aynesworth said, "recognized you as Sir Wingrave Seton."
<P>
Wingrave frowned thoughtfully for a moment.
<P>
"Who was it?" he asked.
<P>
"A most unlikely person," Aynesworth remarked smiling. "Do you remember, when
we went down to Tredowen just before we left for America, a little,
long-legged, black-frocked child, whom we met in the gardens--the organist's
daughter, you know?"
<P>
"What of her?" Wingrave asked.
<P>
"It was she who was with me," Aynesworth remarked. "It was she who saw you in
the box with the Marchioness of Westchester."
<P>
Aynesworth was puzzled by the intentness with which Wingrave was regarding
him. Impenetrable though the man was, Aynesworth, who had not yet lost his
early trick of studying him closely, knew that, for some reason or other, his
intelligence had proved disturbing.
<P>
"Have you then--kept up your acquaintance with this child?" he demanded.
<P>
Aynesworth shook his head.
<P>
"She is not a child any longer, but a very beautiful young woman," he said. "I
met her again quite by accident. She is up in London, studying art at the
studio of an old friend of mine who has a class of girls. I called to see him
the other afternoon, and recognized her."
<P>
"Your acquaintance," Wingrave remarked, "has progressed rapidly if she accepts
your escort--to the gallery of the Opera!"
<P>
"It was scarcely like that," Aynesworth explained. "I met her and Mrs.
Tresfarwin on the way there, and asked to be allowed to accompany them. Mrs.
Tresfarwin was once your housekeeper, I think, at Tredowen."
<P>
"And did you solve the mystery of this relation of her father who turned up so
opportunely?" Wingrave asked.
<P>
Aynesworth shook his head.
<P>
"She told me nothing about him," he answered.
<P>
Wingrave passed on to his own room. His breakfast was on the table awaiting
him, and a little pile of letters and newspapers stood by his plate. His
servant, his head groom, and his chauffeur were there to receive their orders
for the morning. About him were all the evidences of his well-ordered life. He
sent both the men away and locked the door. It was half an hour before he
touched either his breakfast or his letters . . . .
<P>
He lunched at Westchester House in obedience to a somewhat imperative summons.
There were other guests there, whom, however, he outstayed. As soon as they
were alone, his hostess touched him on the arm and led him to her own room.
<P>
"At last!" she exclaimed, with an air of real relief. "There, sit down
opposite to me, please--I want to watch your face."
<P>
She was a little paler than usual, and he noticed that she had avoided talking
much to him at luncheon time. And yet he thought that he had never seen her
more beautiful. Something in her face had altered. He could not tell what it
was for he was not a man of much experience as regarded her sex. Yet, in a
vague sort of way, he understood the change. A certain part of the almost
insolent quietness, the complete self-assurance of her manner, had gone. She
was a little more like an ordinary woman!
<P>
"Lady Ruth proved herself an excellent tactician last night," she remarked.
"She has given me an exceedingly uncomfortable few hours. For you, well for
you it was a respite, wasn't it?"
<P>
"I don't know that I should call it exactly that," he answered thoughtfully.
<P>
She looked at him steadfastly, almost wistfully.
<P>
"Well," she said, "I am not going to make excuses for myself. But the things
which one says naturally enough when the emotions provoke them sound crude
enough in cold blood and colder daylight. We women are creatures of mood, you
know. I was feeling a little lonely and a little tired last night, and the
music stole away my common sense."
<P>
"I understand," he murmured. "All that you said shall be forgotten."
<P>
"Then you do not understand," she answered, smiling at him. "What I said I do
not wish to be forgotten. Only--just at that moment, it sounded natural
enough--and today--I think that I am a little ashamed."
<P>
He rose from his seat. Her eyes leaped up to his expectantly, and the color
streamed into her cheeks. But he only stood by her side. He did nothing to
meet the half-proffered embrace.
<P>
"Dear Lady Emily," he said, "all the kind things that you said were spoken to
a stranger. You did not know me. I did not mean anyone to know me. It is you
who have commanded the truth. You must have it. I am not the person I seem to
be. I am not the person to whom words such as yours should have been spoken.
Even my name is an assumed one. I should prefer to leave it at that--if you
are content."
<P>
"I am not content," she answered quietly; "I must hear more."
<P>
He bowed.
<P>
"I am a man," he said, "who spent ten years in prison, the ten best years of
my life. A woman sent me there--a woman swore my liberty away to save her
reputation. I was never of a forgiving disposition, I was never an amiably
disposed person. I want you to understand this. Any of the ordinary good
qualities with which the average man may be endowed, and which I may have
possessed, are as dead in me as hell fire could burn them. You have spoken of
me as of a man who failed to find a sufficient object in life. You were wrong.
I have an object, and I do my best to live up to it. I hate the whole world of
men and women who laughed their way through life whilst I suffered--tortures.
I hate the woman who sent me there. I have no heart, nor any sense of pity.
Now perhaps you can understand my life and the manner of it."
<P>
Her hands were clasped to the side of her head. Something of horror had stolen
into the steadfast gaze with which she was still regarding him. Yet there were
other things there which puzzled him.
<P>
"This--is terrible!" she murmured. "Then you are not--Mr. Wingrave at all?"
<P>
He hesitated. After all, it was scarcely worth while concealing anything now.
<P>
"I am Sir Wingrave Seton," he said. "You may remember my little affair!"
<P>
She caught hold of his hands.
<P>
"You poor, poor dear!" she cried. "How you must have suffered!"
<P>
Wingrave had a terrible moment. What he felt he would never have admitted,
even to himself. Her eyes were shining with sympathy, and it was so
unexpected. He had expected something in the nature of a cold withdrawal; her
silence was the only thing he had counted upon. It was a fierce, but short
battle. His sudden grasp of her hands was relaxed. He stood away from her.
<P>
"You are very kind," he said. "As you can doubtless imagine, it is a little
too late for sympathy. The years have gone, and the better part of me, if ever
there was a better part, with them."
<P>
"I am not so sure of that!" she whispered.
<P>
He looked at her coldly.
<P>
"Why not?"
<P>
"If you were absolutely heartless," she said, "if you were perfectly
consistent, why did you not make me suffer? You had a great chance! A little
feigned affection, and then a few truths. You could have dragged me down a
little way into the pit of broken hearts! Why didn't you?"
<P>
He frowned.
<P>
"One is forced to neglect a few opportunities!"
<P>
She smiled at him--delightfully.
<P>
"You foolish man!" she murmured. "Some day or other, you will turn out to be a
terrible impostor. Do you know, I think I am going to ask you again--what I
asked you last night?"
<P>
"I scarcely think that you will be so ill-advised," he declared coldly.
"Whether you believe it or not, I can assure you that I am incapable of
affection."
<P>
She sighed.
<P>
"I am not so sure about that," she said with protesting eyebrows, "but you are
terribly hard-hearted?"
<P>
He was entirely dissatisfied with the impression he had produced. He
considered the attitude of the Marchioness unjustifiably frivolous. He had an
uneasy conviction that she was not in the least inclined to take him
seriously.
<P>
"I don't think," he said, glancing at the clock, "that I need detain you any
longer."
<P>
"You are really going away, then?" she asked him softly.
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"To call on Lady Ruth, perhaps?"
<P>
"As it happens, no," he answered.
<P>
Suddenly her face changed--she had remembered something.
<P>
"It was Lady Ruth!" she exclaimed.
<P>
"Exactly!" he interrupted.
<P>
"What a triumph of inconsistency!" she declared scornfully. "You are lending
them money!"
<P>
"I am lending money to Lady Ruth," he answered slowly.
<P>
Their eyes met. She understood, at any rate, what he intended to convey.
Certainly his expression was hard and merciless enough now!
<P>
"Poor Ruth," she murmured.
<P>
"Some day," he answered, "you will probably say that in earnest."
