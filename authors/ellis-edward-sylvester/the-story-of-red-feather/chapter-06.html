<p>It was easy for any spectator to interpret the actions and signals
of the Sioux warrior who was standing erect on his pony and waving
his blanket at some party invisible to the others.</p>

<p>After a minute or two he rested, with the blanket trailing beside
him, while he still held his erect position, and continued gazing
earnestly over the prairie. This showed that he was waiting for
an answer to his signal. Either there was none, or that which
was given was not satisfactory, for up went the blanket once more,
and he swung it more vigorously than before, stopping and gazing
away again.</p>

<p>This time the reply was what was desired, for the warrior dropped
as suddenly astride of his horse as though his feet had been knocked
from under him, and, wheeling about, he and his companion galloped
down the hill to where the others were viewing the cabin.</p>

<p>The taunting words which Melville had called through the front
window must have convinced the Sioux that the pitcher had gone
once too often to the fountain. Red Feather had escaped by a wonderful
piece of good fortune when wedged in the window, and had been
encouraged to another attempt, which ended in his ruin.</p>

<p>"Red Feather," said Melville, stepping close to the chieftain,
who was still peering through one of the windows, "the other Sioux
will soon be here."</p>

<p>"Dat so&mdash;dat so," replied the Indian, looking around at him and
nodding his head several times.</p>

<p>"What will they do?"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Standing erect and waving his blanket."]</p>

<p>Instead of replying to this question the chief seemed to be plunged
in thought. He gazed fixedly in the face of the youth, as if uncertain
what he ought to answer, and then he walked to the head of the
stairs.</p>

<p>"Wait here&mdash;don't come."</p>

<p>And, without anything more, he went down the steps slowly, and
without the slightest noise. Melville listened, but could hear
nothing of his footfalls, though certain that he was moving across
the floor.</p>

<p>"I don't like this," muttered the lad, compressing his lips and
shaking his head; "it makes me uneasy."</p>

<p>He was now in the lower story, where he left his rifle, knife,
and tomahawk. He was therefore more fully armed than the youth,
and, if he chose to play the traitor, there was nothing to prevent
it.</p>

<p>It seemed to Melville that the coming of the larger party was
likely to change whatever plans Red Feather might have formed
for befriending him and his sister. What more probable than that
he had decided to return to his first love?</p>

<p>But speculation could go on this way for ever, and without reaching
any result.</p>

<p>"I'll do as I have done all along," he muttered; "I'll trust
in Heaven and do the best I can. I'm sure of one thing," he added;
"whatever comes, Red Feather won't hurt Dot: he has spared me
on her account: and if he turns against me now, he will do what
he can to save her. Therefore I'll make use of the little one."</p>

<p>Dot had held her peace through these trying moments, but he now
called her to him and explained what he wished her to do. It was
that she should place herself at the head of the stairs and watch
Red Feather. In case he started to open the door, or to come up
the stairs, she was to tell him. Dot was beginning to understand
more clearly than before the situation in which she was placed.
The belief that she could be of some use to her brother made her
more anxious than ever to do her part. She walked to the head
of the stairs and sat down where she could see what went on below.</p>

<p>Returning to his place at the window, Melville found enough to
interest him without thinking of Red Feather.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "The whole party broke out in a series of yells."
&mdash;Page 63]</p>

<p>The band from the Muddy Creek country had just arrived, and as
nearly as he could judge, there were fully a score&mdash;all wild,
ugly-looking fellows, eager for mischief. They had just galloped
up the hill, where they gathered round the man that had first
signalled them, he having ridden forward to meet them. They talked
for several minutes, evidently to learn what had taken place in
and around the Clarendon cabin.</p>

<p>This was soon made clear to them, and then the whole party broke
into a series of yells enough to startle the bravest man. At the
same time they began riding rapidly back and forth, swinging their
rifles over their heads, swaying their bodies first on one side
and then on another, and apparently growing more excited every
minute.</p>

<p>At first they described short circles on the prairie, and then
suddenly extended them so as to pass entirely around the house.</p>

<p>The Sioux, as they came in sight in front of the cabin, were
in such a fire range that the youth felt sure he could bring down
a warrior at every shot. He was tempted to do so, but restrained
himself.</p>

<p>He reflected that, though several shots had been fired, no one,
so far as he knew, had been hurt on either side. He had brought
his own rifle to his shoulder more than once, and but a feather's
weight more pressure on the trigger would have discharged it,
but he was glad he had not done so.</p>

<p>"I shall not shoot any one," he said, determinedly, "until I
see it must be done for the sake of Dot or myself. I wonder what
Red Feather is at?"</p>

<p>Dot was still sitting at the head of the stairs, dividing her
attention between Susie her doll and the chieftain. Stepping softly
toward her, Melville asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is he doing, Dot?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Where is he standing?"</p>

<p>"Beside the front window, looking out just like you did a minute
ago."</p>

<p>This was reassuring information, and helped to drive away the
fear that had troubled the youth ever since the Sioux passed below
stairs.</p>

<p>"Mel," called his sister the next minute, "I'm awful hungry;
ain't it past dinner-time?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there is nothing to eat in the house."</p>

<p>"I'm awful thirsty, too."</p>

<p>"I feel a little that way myself, but I don't believe there is
anything to eat or drink. You know, father and mother didn't expect
us to stay here, or they would have left something for us."</p>

<p>"Can't I go downstairs and look?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you will keep away from the windows, and tell Red Feather
what you are doing."</p>

<p>"Hasn't he got eyes that he can see for himself?" asked the little
one as she hurried down the steps.</p>

<p>The chief looked around when he heard the dainty steps, wondering
what errand brought her downstairs.</p>

<p>"Red Feather," said the young lady, "I'm hungry; ain't you?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;me no hungry," he answered, his dark face lighting up with
pleasure at sight of the picture of innocence.</p>

<p>"Then you must have eaten an awful big breakfast this morning,"
remarked Dot, walking straight to the cupboard in the farther
corner of the room, into which Melville had glanced when he first
entered the house; "I know where mother keeps her jam and nice
things."</p>

<p>That she knew where the delicacies were stored Dot proved the
next minute, when, to her delight, she found everything that heart,
or rather appetite, could wish.</p>

<p>There were a jar of currant jam, a pan of cool milk, on which
a thick crust of yellow cream had formed, three-fourths of a loaf
of bread, and an abundance of butter. Good Mrs. Clarendon left
them behind because she had an abundance without them. Little
did she dream of the good service they were destined to do.</p>

<p>Dot uttered such a cry of delight that the chief walked toward
her, and Melville seized the excuse to hurry below.</p>

<p>The first thing that struck him was that Red Feather's tomahawk
and knife still lay in the corner where he had placed them. He
simply held his rifle which most likely he was ready to use against
his own people whenever the necessity arose.</p>

<p>"Well, Dot, you <em>have</em> found a prize," said her brother,
following the chief, who was looking over her shoulder; "I had
no idea that mother had left anything behind; there's enough for
all."</p>

<p>She insisted that the others should partake while she waited,
but neither would permit it. No matter how a-hungered either might
have been, he enjoyed the sight of seeing her eat tenfold more
than in partaking himself.</p>

<p>And you may be sure that Dot did ample justice to the rich find.
Melville cut a thick slice for her, and spread the butter and
jam on it, while a portion of the milk was poured into a cup.</p>

<p>I never heard of a little girl who could eat a piece of bread
well covered with jam or preserves without failing to get most
of it on her mouth. Dot Clarendon was no exception to the rule;
and before she was through a goodly part of it, the sticky sweet
stuff was on her cheeks and nose. When she looked up at the two
who were watching her, the sight was so comical that Red Feather
did that which I do not believe he had done a dozen times in all
his life&mdash;he threw back his head and laughed loud. Melville caught
the contagion and gave way to his mirth, which was increased by
the naive remark of Dot that she couldn't see anything to laugh
at.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "He threw back his head and laughed loud."]</p>

<p>The appetite of the young queen having been satisfied, Melville
insisted on Red Feather sharing what was left with him. The Sioux
declined at first, but yielded, and the remaining bread and milk
furnished them a grateful and nourishing repast. They did not
use all, but saved enough to supply another meal for Dot, whose
appetite was sure to make itself felt before many hours passed
by.</p>

<p>Like most boys of his age in these later days, Melville Clarendon
carried a watch, which showed that it was past three o'clock in
the afternoon. This was considerably later than he supposed, and
proved that in the rush of incidents time had passed faster than
he had suspected.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" asked the youth, turning to the chief.</p>

<p>"Go&mdash;up up," he replied, pointing up the steps; "watch out. Red
Feather&mdash;he watch out here."</p>

<p>"Do you want Dot to stay with you?" asked Melville, pausing on
his way to the steps.</p>

<p>"Leave wid Red Feather&mdash;he take heap care ob pappoose."</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt of <em>that</em>," remarked the brother,
as he bounded up the stairs, resuming his former station near
the window.</p>

<p>Looking out with the same care he had shown from the first, he
found the Sioux had grown tired of galloping round the house and
buildings, or they were plotting some other kind of mischief,
for only one of them was in sight.</p>

<p>He was seated on his pony on the crest of the hill from which
the signals were made to the Muddy Creek warriors. A moment's
study of the red men showed that his attention was directed not
toward the west but the north, in the direction of the settlement.</p>

<p>"He is now looking for enemies instead of friends," was the conclusion
of Melville.</p>

<p>The truth was, the youth was beginning to wonder why the settlers
did not come. If no accident had befallen his parents, they ought
to have reached Barwell several hours before, and a gallop of
ten miles was only a moderate ride for a party of horsemen eager
to strike the marauders a blow.</p>

<p>But the fact that they were not yet in sight set the youth speculating
as to what the result was likely to be if they did not come at
all, or rather, if their coming should be delayed until nightfall,
for it was not to be supposed that relief would not be sent sooner
or later.</p>

<p>"There is only a faint moon to-night," he reflected; "and I'm
afraid that's against us."</p>

<p>The American Indian prefers to do his mischief in the dark, and,
since it would be impossible for the horsemen to conceal their
approach, they would be likely to suffer in the first collision
with the red men.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, would not the gloom be of help to Red
Feather in some scheme doubtless formed to help the children whose
friend he had so suddenly become?</p>

<p>What the nature of this scheme was (if such existed) Melville
could not guess; it might be that it required a bright moon for
its success.</p>

<p>It may be said that the Sioux chieftain, as he stood beside one
of the narrow windows on the lower floor, racked his brain until
he hit upon a way of aiding the brother and sister&mdash;especially
the latter&mdash;in their desperate peril. It was a strange plan, indeed,
and, with all his adroitness, he knew the chances were ten to
one against its success.</p>

<p>But the chief gave no hint to Melville of what was going on in
his mind, and the latter could only wait, and hope and pray that
the same Heavenly Father who had protected and preserved them
thus far would keep them to the end.</p>

<p>The youth was in the midst of his speculations over the matter
when he fancied he detected a peculiar odor from the outside.
He could not tell its nature, though he snuffed the air repeatedly.
He was alarmed, for he connected it with the silence of the war-party
outside.</p>

<p>He was on the point of appealing to Red Feather downstairs, when
its nature flashed upon him. <em>It was smoke!</em></p>

<p>He had hardly reached the decision when a mass of thick vapor
rolled in front of the house, so dense and blinding that for the
moment it shut from his sight the mounted sentinel on the hill.</p>

<p>What was dreaded by the besieged had come at last. The Sioux,
aware of the great value of the minutes, had resorted to the torch.</p>
