Bob Southey! You're a poet, poet laureate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And representative of all the race.<br/>
Although 'tis true that you turned out a Tory at<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, yours has lately been a common case.<br/>
And now my epic renegade, what are ye at<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the lakers, in and out of place?<br/>
A nest of tuneful persons, to my eye<br/>
Like four and twenty blackbirds in a pye,

</p>
<p>
Which pye being opened they began to sing'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(This old song and new simile holds good),<br/>
'A dainty dish to set before the King'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Regent, who admires such kind of food.<br/>
And Coleridge too has lately taken wing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But like a hawk encumbered with his hood,<br/>
Explaining metaphysics to the nation.<br/>
I wish he would explain his explanation.

</p>
<p>
You, Bob, are rather insolent, you know,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At being disappointed in your wish<br/>
To supersede all warblers here below,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And be the only blackbird in the dish.<br/>
And then you overstrain yourself, or so,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tumble downward like the flying fish<br/>
Gasping on deck, because you soar too high,<br/>
Bob, And fall for lack of moisture quite a dry Bob.

</p>
<p>
And Wordsworth in a rather long Excursion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(I think the quarto holds five hundred pages)<br/>
Has given a sample from the vasty version<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his new system to perplex the sages.<br/>
'Tis poetry, at least by his assertion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And may appear so when the Dog Star rages,<br/>
And he who understands it would be able<br/>
To add a story to the tower of Babel.

</p>
<p>
You gentlemen, by dint of long seclusion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From better company, have kept your own<br/>
At Keswick, and through still continued fusion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of one another's minds at last have grown<br/>
To deem, as a most logical conclusion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That poesy has wreaths for you alone.<br/>
There is a narrowness in such a notion,<br/>
Which makes me wish you'd change your lakes for ocean.

</p>
<p>
I would not imitate the petty thought,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor coin my self-love to so base a vice,<br/>
For all the glory your conversion brought,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since gold alone should not have been its price.<br/>
You have your salary; was't for that you wrought?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Wordsworth has his place in the Excise.<br/>
You're shabby fellows&mdash;true&mdash;but poets still<br/>
And duly seated on the immortal hill.

</p>
<p>
Your bays may hide the baldness of your brows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps some virtuous blushes; let them go.<br/>
To you I envy neither fruit nor boughs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the fame you would engross below,<br/>
The field is universal and allows<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Scope to all such as feel the inherent glow.<br/>
Scott, Rogers, Campbell, Moore, and Crabbe will try<br/>
'Gainst you the question with posterity.

</p>
<p>
For me, who, wandering with pedestrian Muses,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Contend not with you on the winged' steed,<br/>
I wish your fate may yield ye, when she chooses,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fame you envy and the skill you need.<br/>
And recollect a poet nothing loses<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In giving to his brethren their full meed<br/>
Of merit, and complaint of present days<br/>
Is not the certain path to future praise.

</p>
<p>
He that reserves his laurels for posterity<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Who does not often claim the bright reversion)<br/>
Has generally no great crop to spare it, he<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Being only injured by his own assertion.<br/>
And although here and there some glorious rarity<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Arise like Titan from the sea's immersion,<br/>
The major part of such appellants go<br/>
To<br/>
&mdash;God knows where&mdash;for no one else can know.

</p>
<p>
If fallen in evil days on evil tongues,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Milton appealed to the avenger, Time,<br/>
If Time, the avenger, execrates his wrongs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And makes the word Miltonic mean sublime,<br/>
He deigned not to belie his soul in songs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor turn his very talent to a crime.<br/>
He did not loathe the sire to laud the son,<br/>
But closed the tyrant-hater he begun.

</p>
<p>
Think'st thou, could he, the blind old man, arise<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Samuel from the grave to freeze once more<br/>
The blood of monarchs with his prophecies,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or be alive again&mdash;again all hoar<br/>
With time and trials, and those helpless eyes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And heartless daughters&mdash;worn and pale and poor,<br/>
Would he adore a sultan? He obey<br/>
The intellectual eunuch Castlereagh?

</p>
<p>
Cold-blooded, smooth-faced, placid miscreant!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dabbling its sleek young hands in Erin's gore,<br/>
And thus for wider carnage taught to pant,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Transferred to gorge upon a sister shore,<br/>
The vulgarest tool that tyranny could want,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With just enough of talent and no more,<br/>
To lengthen fetters by another fixed<br/>
And offer poison long already mixed.

</p>
<p>
An orator of such set trash of phrase,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ineffably, legitimately vile,<br/>
That even its grossest flatterers dare not praise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor foes&mdash;all nations&mdash;condescend to smile.<br/>
Not even a sprightly blunder's spark can blaze<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From that Ixion grindstone's ceaseless toil,<br/>
That turns and turns to give the world a notion<br/>
Of endless torments and perpetual motion.

</p>
<p>
A bungler even in its disgusting trade,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And botching, patching, leaving still behind<br/>
Something of which its masters are afraid,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;States to be curbed and thoughts to be confined,<br/>
Conspiracy or congress to be made,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cobbling at manacles for all mankind,<br/>
A tinkering slave-maker, who mends old chains,<br/>
With God and man's abhorrence for its gains.

</p>
<p>
If we may judge of matter by the mind,<br/>
Emasculated to the marrow, it<br/>
Hath but two objects, how to serve and bind,<br/>
Deeming the chain it wears even men may fit,<br/>
Eutropius of its many masters, blind<br/>
To worth as freedom, wisdom as to wit,<br/>
Fearless, because no feeling dwells in ice;<br/>
Its very courage stagnates to a vice.

</p>
<p>
Where shall I turn me not to view its bonds,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For I will never feel them. Italy,<br/>
Thy late reviving Roman soul desponds<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the lie this state-thing breathed o'er thee.<br/>
Thy clanking chain and Erin's yet green wounds<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have voices, tongues to cry aloud for me.<br/>
Europe has slaves, allies, kings, armies still,<br/>
And Southey lives to sing them very ill.

</p>
<p>
Meantime, Sir Laureate, I proceed to dedicate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In honest simple verse this song to you.<br/>
And if in flattering strains I do not predicate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis that I still retain my buff and blue;<br/>
My politics as yet are all to educate.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Apostasy's so fashionable too,<br/>
To keep one creed's a task grown quite<br/>
Herculean Is it not so, my Tory, ultra-Julian?
