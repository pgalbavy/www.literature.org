<p>It is a matter not of notoriety but of the happiest celebrity
that Mrs. Tanberry danced that night, and not only that she danced,
but that she waltzed. To the lot of Tappingham Marsh (whom she
pronounced the most wheedlmg vagabond, next to Crailey Gray, of
her acquaintance) it fell to persuade her; and, after a quadrille
with the elder Chenoweth, she was with Tappingham. More extraordinary
to relate, she danced down both her partner and music. Thereupon
did Mr. Bareaud, stung with envy, dare emulation and essay a schottische
with Miss Trixie Chenoweth, performing marvelously well for many
delectable turns before he unfortunately fell down. It was a night
when a sculptured god would have danced on his pedestal: June,
but not over-warm, balm in the air and rose leaves on the breeze;
and even Minerva's great heels might have marked the time that
orchestra kept. Be sure they waltzed again to "Those Endearing
Young Charms ":</p>

<p>"Oh, the heart that has truly loved never forgets, But as truly
loves on to the close: as the sunflower turns on her god when
he sets, The same look that she gave when he rose."</p>

<p>Three of the volunteers were resplendent in their regimentals:
Mr. Marsh (who had been elected captain of the new company to
succeed Vanrevel), and Will Cummings and Jean Madrillon, the lieutenants.
This glory was confined to the officers, who had ordered their
uniforms at home, for the privates and non-commissioned officers
were to receive theirs at the State rendezvous. However, although
this gala adornment was limited to the three gentlemen mentioned,
their appearance added "an indescribable air of splendor and pathos
to the occasion," to quote Mr. Cummings once more. A fourth citizen
of the town who might have seized upon this opportunity to display
himself as a soldier neglected to take advantage of it and stole
in quietly, toward the last, in his ordinary attire, leaving his
major's uniform folded on a chair in his own room. The flag was
to be presented to the volunteers at the close of the evening,
and Tom came for that&mdash;so he claimed to his accusing soul.</p>

<p>He entered unobserved and made his way, keeping close to the
wall, to where Mrs. Bareaud sat, taking a chair at her side; but
Robert Carewe, glancing thither by chance, saw him, and changed
countenance for an instant. Mr. Carewe composed his features swiftly,
excused himself with elaborate courtesy from Miss Chenoweth, with
whom he was talking, and crossed the room to a corner near his
enemy. Presently, as the music ceased, the volunteers were bidden
to come forward, whereupon Tom left Mrs. Bareaud and began to
work his way down the room. Groups were forming and breaking up
in the general movement of the crowd, and the dissolving of one
brought him face to face with Elizabeth Carewe, who was moving
slowly in the opposite direction, a small flock of suitors in
her train.</p>

<p>The confrontation came so suddenly and so unexpectedly that,
before either was aware, they looked squarely into each other's
eyes, full and straight, and both stopped instantly as though
transfixed, Miss Betty leaving a sentence forever half-complete.
There was a fierce, short vocal sound from the crowd behind Vanrevel;
but no one noticed Mr. Carewe; and then Tom bowed gravely, as
in apology for blocking the way, and passed on.</p>

<p>Miss Betty began to talk again, much at random, with a vivacity
too greatly exaggerated to be genuine, while the high color went
from her cheeks and left her pale. Nothing could have enraged
her more with herself than the consciousness, now suddenly strong
within her, that the encounter had a perceptible effect upon her.
What power had this man to make her manner strained and mechanical?
What right had his eyes always to stir her as they did? It was
not he for whom she had spent an hour over her hair; not he for
whom she had driven her poor handmaiden away in tears: that was
for one who had not come, one great in heart and goodness, one
of a pure and sacrificial life who deserved all she could give,
and for whose sake she had honored herself in trying to look as
pretty as she could. He had not come; and that hurt her a little,
but she felt his generosity, believing that his motive was to
spare her, since she could not speak to him in Mr Carewe's presence
without open and public rupture with her father. Well, she was
almost ready for that, seeing how little of a father hers was!
Ah! that other should have come, if only to stand between her
and this tall hypocrite whose dark glance had such strength to
disturb her. What lies that gaze contained, all in the one flash!&mdash;the
strange pretence of comprehending her gently but completely, a
sad compassion, too, and with it a look of farewell, seeming to
say: "Once more I have come for this&mdash;and just, 'Good-by!"  For
she knew that he was going with the others, going perhaps forever,
only the day after tomorrow&#11834;then she would see him no more and
be free of him. Let the day after tomorrow come soon! Miss Betty
hated herself for understanding the adieu, and hated herself more
because she could not be sure that, in the startled moment of
meeting before she collected herself, she had let it go unanswered.</p>

<p>She had done more than that: without knowing it she had bent
her head to his bow, and Mr. Carewe had seen both the salutation
and the look.</p>

<p>The young men were gathered near the orchestra, and, to the hilarious
strains of "Yankee Doodle," the flag they were to receive for
their regiment was borne down the room by the sisters and sweethearts
who had made it, all of whom were there, except Fanchon Bareaud.
Crailey had persuaded her to surrender the flag for the sake of
spending this evening&mdash;next to his last in Rouen&mdash;at home alone
with him.</p>

<p>The elder Chenoweth made the speech of presentation, that is,
he made part of it before he broke down, for his son stood in
the ranks of the devoted band. Until this incident occurred, all
had gone trippingly, for everyone had tried to put the day after
to-morrow from his mind. Perhaps there might not have been so
many tears even now, if the young men had not stood together so
smilingly to receive their gift; it was seeing them so gay and
confident, so strong in their youth and so unselfish of purpose;
it was this, and the feeling that all of them must suffer and
some of them die before they came back. So that when Mr. Chenoweth,
choking in his loftiest flight, came to a full stop, and without
disguise buried his face in his handkerchief, Mrs. Tanberry, the
apostle of gayety, openly sobbed. Chenoweth, without more ado,
carried the flag over to Tappingham Marsh, whom Vanrevel directed
to receive it, and Tappingham thanked the donors without many
words, because there were not then many at his command. .</p>

<p>Miss Carewe bad been chosen to sing "The Star Spangled Banner,"
and she stepped out a little from the crowd to face the young
men as the orchestra sounded the first chord. She sang in a full,
clear voice, but when the volunteers saw that, as she sang, the
tears were streaming down her cheeks in spite of the brave voice,
they began to choke with the others. If Miss Betty found them
worth weeping for, they could afford to cry a little for themselves.
Yet they joined the chorus nobly, and raised the roof with the
ringing song, sending the flamboyant, proud old words thunderously
to heaven.</p>

<p>That was not the last song of the night. General Trumble and
Mr. Chenoweth had invited their young friends to attend, after
the ball, a collation which they chose to call a supper, but which,
to accord with the hour, might more aptly have been designated
a breakfast. To afford a private retreat for the scene of this
celebration, they had borrowed the offices of Gray and Vanrevel,
and Crailey hospitably announced that any guest was welcome to
stay for a year or two, since, probably, neither of the firm would
have need of an office for at least that length of time. Nine
men gathered about the table which replaced Tom's work-a-day old
desk: the two Chenoweths, Eugene Madrillon, Marsh, Jefferson Bareaud,
the stout General, Tom Vanrevel, Crailey, and Will Cummings, the
editor coming in a little late, but rubbing his hands cheerfully
over what he declared was to be the last column from his pen to
rear its length on the Journal's front page for many a long day&mdash;a
description of the presentation of the flag, a bit of prose which
he considered almost equal to his report of the warehouse fire.</p>

<p>This convivial party made merry and tried to forget that most
of them had "been mighty teary," as Marsh said, an hour earlier;
while Mr. Chenoweth sat with his hand on his son's shoulder, unconsciously
most of the time, apologetically removing, it when he observed
it. Many were the witticisms concerning the difference in rank
hence forth to be observed between the young men, as Tom was now
a major, Marsh a captain, Will Cummings a second lieutenant, and
the rest mere privates, except Crailey, who was a corporal. Nevertheless,
though the board was festive, it was somewhat subdued and absent
until they came to the toasts.</p>

<p>It was Tappingham who proposed Miss Betty Carewe. "I know Tom
Vanrevel will understand&mdash;nay, I know he's man enough to join
us," said Marsh as he rose. "Why shouldn't I say that we may hail
ourselves as patriots, indeed, since at the call of our country
we depart from the town which is this lady's home, and at the
trumpet's sound resign the gracious blessing of seeing her day
by day, and why shouldn't we admit loyally and openly that it
is her image alone which shines in the hearts of most of us here?"</p>

<p>And no man arose to contradict that speech, which appears to
have rung true, seeing that four of those present had proposed
to her (again) that same evening. "So I give you," cried Tappingham,
gallantly, "the health of Miss Betty Carewe, the loveliest rose
of our bouquet! May she remember us when we come home!"</p>

<p>They rose and drank it with a shout. But Tom Vanrevel, not setting
down his cup, went to the window and threw wide the shutters,
letting in a ruddy shaft of the morning sun, so that as he stood
in the strong glow he looked like a man carved out of red gold.
He lifted his glass, not toward the table and his companions,
while they stared at him, surprised, but toward the locusts of
Carewe Street.</p>

<p>"To Miss Betty Carewe," he said, "the finest flower of them all!
May she remember those who never come home!"</p>

<p>And, without pausing, he lifted his rich baritone in an old song
that had been vastly popular with the young men of Rouen ever
since the night of Miss Betty's debut; they had hummed it as they
went about their daily work, they had whistled it on the streets;
they had drifted, into dreams at night with the sound of it still
chiming in their ears; and now, with one accord, as they stood
gathered together for the last time in Rouen, they joined Tom
Vanrevel and sang it again. And the eyes of Crailey Gray rested
very gently upon his best friend as they sang:</p>

<p>"Believe me, If all those endearing young charms, Which I gaze
on so fondly to-day, Were to change by to-morrow and fleet from
my arms, Like fairy gifts fading away, Thou wouldst still be adored
as this moment thou art: Let thy loveliness fade as it will, And
around the dear ruin, each wish of my heart Would entwine itself
verdantly still."</p>
