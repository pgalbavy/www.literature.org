<P>The next day at sunrise the American coast had disappeared; not a ship was
visible on the horizon, and the <I>Dolphin</I>, moderating the frightful
rapidity of her speed, made quietly towards the Bermudas.</P>
<P>It is useless to recount the passage across the Atlantic, which was marked by
no accidents, and ten days after the departure from Queenstown the French coast
was hailed.</P>
<P>What passed between the Captain and the young girl may be imagined, even by
the least observant individuals. How could Mr. Halliburtt acknowledge the
devotion and courage of his deliverer, if it was not by making him the happiest
of men? James Playfair did not wait for English seas to declare to the father
and daughter the sentiments which overflowed his heart, and, if Crockston is to
be believed, Miss Jenny received his confession with a happiness she did not try
to conceal.</P>
<P>Thus it happened that on the 14th of February, 18 &mdash; , a numerous crowd was
collected in the dim aisles of St. Mungo, the old cathedral of Glasgow. There
were seamen, merchants, manufacturers, magistrates, and some of every
denomination gathered here. There was Miss Jenny in bridal array and beside her
the worthy Crockston, resplendent in apple-green clothes, with gold buttons,
whilst Uncle Vincent stood proudly by his nephew.</P>
<P>In short, they were celebrating the marriage of James Playfair, of the firm
of Vincent Playfair &amp; Co., of Glasgow, with Miss Jenny Halliburtt, of
Boston.</P>
<P>The ceremony was accomplished amidst great pomp. Everyone knew the history of
the <I>Dolphin</I>, and everyone thought the young Captain well recompensed for
his devotion. He alone said that his reward was greater than he deserved.</P>
<P>In the evening there was a grand ball and banquet at Uncle Vincent&apos;s house,
with a large distribution of shillings to the crowd collected in Gordon Street.
Crockston did ample justice to this memorable feast, while keeping himself
perfectly within bounds.</P>
<P>Everyone was happy at this wedding; some at their own happiness, and others
at the happiness around them, which is not always the case at ceremonies of this
kind.</P>
<P>Late in the evening, when the guests had retired, James Playfair took his
uncle&apos;s hand.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, Uncle Vincent,&quot; said he to him.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, Nephew James?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are you pleased with the charming cargo I brought you on board the
<I>Dolphin</I>?&quot; continued Captain Playfair, showing him his brave young
wife.</P>
<P>&quot;I am quite satisfied,&quot; replied the worthy merchant; &quot;I have sold my cotton
at three hundred and seventy-five per cent. profit.&quot;</P>
