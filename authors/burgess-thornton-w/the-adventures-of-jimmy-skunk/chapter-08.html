<p>Jimmy Skunk looked very hard at Sammy Jay. Sammy Jay looked very
hard at Jimmy Skunk. Then Sammy slowly shut one eye and as slowly
opened it again. It was a wink.</p>

<p>"You mean," said Jimmy Skunk, "that you guess that Peter Rabbit
knew that I was in that barrel, and that he jumped over it so
as to make Reddy Fox run against it. Is that it?"</p>

<p>Sammy Jay said nothing, but winked again. Jimmy grinned. Then
he looked thoughtful. "I wonder," said he slowly, "if Peter did
it so as to gain time to get away from Reddy Fox."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Sammy Jay.</p>

<p>"And I wonder if he did it just to get Reddy into trouble," continued
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"I wonder," repeated Sammy Jay.</p>

<p>"And I wonder if he did it for a joke, a double joke on Reddy
and myself," Jimmy went on, scratching his head thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Sammy Jay once more, and burst out laughing.</p>

<p>Now Jimmy Skunk has a very shrewd little head on his shoulders.
"So that is your guess, is it? Well, I wouldn't be a bit surprised
if you are right," said he, nodding his head. "I think I will
go look for Peter. I think he needs a lesson. Jokes that put other
people in danger or make them uncomfortable can have no excuse.
My neck might have been broken in that wild ride down the hill,
and certainly I was made most uncomfortable. I felt as if everything
inside me was shaken out of place and all mixed up. Even now my
stomach feels a bit queer, as if it might not be just where it
ought to be. By the way, what became of Peter after he jumped
over the barrel?"</p>

<p>Sammy shook his head. "I don't know," he confessed. "You see,
it was very exciting when that barrel started rolling, and we
knew by the sounds that there was some one inside it. I guess
Reddy Fox forgot all about Peter. I know I did. And when the barrel
broke to pieces against that stone down there, and you and Reddy
faced each other, it was still more exciting. After it was over,
I looked for Peter, but he was nowhere in sight. He hadn't had
time to reach the Old Briar-patch. I really would like to know
myself what became of him."</p>

<p>Jimmy Skunk turned and looked down the hill. Then in his usual
slow way he started back towards the broken barrel.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked Sammy.</p>

<p>"To look for Peter Rabbit," replied Jimmy. "I want to ask him
a few questions."</p>

<p>Jimmy Skunk ambled along down the hill. At first he was very
angry as he thought of what Peter had done, and he made up his
mind that Peter should be taught a lesson he would never forget.
But as he ambled along, the funny side of the whole affair struck
him, for Jimmy Skunk has a great sense of humor, and before he
reached the bottom of the hill his anger had all gone and he was
chuckling.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry if I did Reddy Fox an injustice," thought he, "but
he makes so much trouble for other people that I guess no one
else will be sorry. He isn't likely to bother any one for some
time. Peter really ought to be punished, but somehow I don't feel
so much like punishing him as I did. I'll just give him a little
scare and let the scamp off with that. Now, I wonder where he
can be. I have an idea he isn't very far away. Let me see. Seems
to me I remember an old house of Johnny Chuck's not very far from
here. I'll have a look in that."</p>
