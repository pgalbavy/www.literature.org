<p>That which the astonished visitors looked upon was a pile of
wood at one side of the cavern big enough to build a roaring fire
that would last for hours. This place must have formed the headquarters
of Docak when indulging in the occasional hunts that are anything
but popular among the coast natives.</p>

<p>The Esquimau did not carry lucifer matches with him, but, on
the other hand, he was not forced to use the primitive means common
among savages. He possessed a flint and tinder such as our forefathers
used and are still popular in some parts of the world.</p>

<p>But Rob and Fred did not exhaust their supply of matches in trying
to scorch the bear steak on the iceberg, and when everything was
ready to start the blaze they did so with little trouble. The
smoke bothered them at first, but it gradually wound its way through
the opening, so that breathing became quite comfortable.</p>

<p>Docak cooked the tongues with a skill born of long experience.
There was just the faintest trace of musk, but not enough to interfere
with the vigorous appetites, which could afford to disregard trifles.
The meal proved to be what he had promised&mdash;one of the most grateful
they had ever eaten.</p>

<p>There was a good deal left after the supper was finished, and
this was laid aside for future contingencies, since the experience
of their approach to this spot taught them to be prepared for
an extended deprivation of food. Indeed, the native Esquimau sometimes
goes for days, apparently with no craving in that direction, though
it must be there all the same. When he finally secures nourishment,
he stuffs prodigiously&mdash;so much so indeed that a civilized person
would die of gluttony. He calmly waits, however, until able to
hold a little more, when he resumes cramming the food down his
throat, keeping it up until at last he is satisfied. Then he sleeps,
hour after hour, and, on waking, is ready to resume his frightful
gormandizing.</p>

<p>By the time the meal was finished the long Arctic night began
closing in. Looking through the crevice on the side, and the entrance,
they saw that the day was fast fading. The air was as clear as
crystal and very cold. The boys had no extra garments to bring
with them, but Docak, despite his cumbrous suit, carried the fur
of a polar bear that he had shot a couple of years before. This
was not only warm, but had the advantages over many pelts of being
vermin proof.</p>

<p>When traveling over the snow Docak had a way of using this extra
garment, like a shawl, so that his arms were free. It was now
spread upon the solid rock, and, though it was not extensive enough
to wrap about the forms of the four, it furnished a couch for
all, as they lay with their bodies near together, and it was most
welcome indeed.</p>

<p>It might seem that our friends ran an imprudent risk in venturing
this far from the coast without snow-shoes; for, in the event
of a thaw, the work of traveling the thirty miles would tax their
endurance to the utmost. The snow was several feet deep on a level,
and was drifted in places as high as a house. Who could make his
way through instead of over this?</p>

<p>But all misgivings on that score were ended by Docak telling
his friends there would be no thaw for days, weeks, and, perhaps,
not for months. It was more likely to be the other way.</p>

<p>The surface, as I have intimated, was as easily walked upon as
the floor of a house. So long as it remained thus there was no
need of snow-shoes or anything like artificial help.</p>

<p>The fire made it so cheerful and the warmth was so pleasant that
it was decided to keep it going for an hour or two, and then let
it die out after they fell asleep. There would be considerable
fuel left for morning, and the blaze was not really necessary,
unless the weather should take one of those appalling plunges
during which a red-hot stove seems to lose all power.</p>

<p>As was Docak's custom, when staying in an inclosed place like
this, he sauntered out doors before lying down to slumber, in
order to take a look at the weather and the surroundings. The
life of the Esquimaux makes them wonderfully skillful readers
of impending changes of temperature. Signs which are invisible
to others are as intelligible to them as the pages of a printed
book to us.</p>

<p>The native remained absent a considerable while, until his friends
began speculating as to the cause.</p>

<p>"Maybe he has caught sight of another of those musk oxen, and
wants to bring him down," suggested Rob.</p>

<p>"There is no call to do that when so many of them lie on the
frozen ground, where they will keep for months unless the wolves
find them."</p>

<p>"They'll be pretty certain to do that," continued Rob; "but then
he may have caught sight of a bull, and both may want to try a
race by starting in opposite directions and seeing which can travel
first around the world."</p>

<p>"That would be a sight worth seeing," Fred hastened to say, "unless
he fell down and bawled for some one to come to his help, after
firing his gun and missing the game by about a rod."</p>

<p>Jack Cosgrove looked wonderingly at his young friends, puzzled
to know what this curious talk meant. To him there was no sense
in it. Rob and Fred thought they had ventured as far upon forbidden
ground as was prudent, so they veered off.</p>

<p>While they were talking Docak reappeared. His feet were heard
on the crust of the snow for several seconds before he was visible,
for there was no call to guard against noise.</p>

<p>As he straightened up in the cavern he stood a moment without
speaking. Then, stepping to the wood, he threw a number of sticks
on the blaze, causing an illumination that made the interior as
light as day.</p>

<p>Jack was better acquainted with the native's moods than the boys
could be expected to be, and the first sight of the honest fellow's
countenance by the added light told him he was troubled over something.
Evidently he had made some unpleasant discovery.</p>

<p>"He'll let me know what it is," concluded the sailor, deeming
it best not to question him; "I can't imagine what would make
him feel so uneasy, but he's got something on his mind&mdash;that's
sartin."</p>

<p>Docak was on the point of speaking more than once, but some impulse
led him to close his lips at the moment the all-important matter
was about to become known. He probably would have kept it to himself
altogether had not a question of Rob given him an opportunity
too inviting to be resisted.</p>

<p>"Which course will we take to-morrow, Docak?"</p>

<p>"Dat way&mdash;we trabel fast as can, too."</p>

<p>The astonishment of the three may be understood when they saw
him point directly toward his own home&mdash;that is, in the direction
of the seacoast, and over the course they had just completed.</p>

<p>Their purpose when they set out was to penetrate at least double
the distance in the interior, and now he declared for a withdrawal.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the manner of the native proved that he considered
the crisis imminent, and that no time was to be lost in carrying
out his unexpected decision.</p>

<p>Jack knew him so well that he was right in deciding that his
hesitancy of manner was caused by his doubt whether he should
insist upon his friends starting at once, or allow them to defer
it until morning.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, Docak?" asked the sailor, now that the subject
was broached; "I never saw you look so scared&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment the dismal cry of a wolf reached their ears, quickly
followed by others. The gaunt creatures that seem born ravenously
hungry, and always remain so, had scented the rich feast that
awaited them on the plateau, and were hurrying thither from all
directions. Soon nothing would be left but the bones of the game
brought down by the rifles of the hunters.</p>

<p>Rob and Fred naturally concluded the moment these sounds were
identified that it was because of them the native was frightened,
he having discovered them before the rest; but Jack knew it was
from some other reason. He saw nothing alarming in the approach
of a pack of wild animals. The four were well armed, they had
a fire, were in a cavern, and could stand off all the wolves in
Greenland for a time at least.</p>

<p>"No, it isn't that," muttered the sailor; "but if he doesn't
choose to tell I sha'n't coax him."</p>
