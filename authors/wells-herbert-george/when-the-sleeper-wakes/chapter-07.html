<P>
Presently Graham resumed his examination of his
apartments. Curiosity kept him moving in spite of
his fatigue. The inner room, he perceived, was high,
and its ceiling dome shaped', with an oblong aperture
in the centre, opening into a funnel in which a wheel
of broad vans seemed to be rotating, apparently driving 
the air up the shaft. The faint humming note of
its easy motion was the only clear sound in that quiet
place. As these vans sprang up one after the other,
Graham could get transient glimpses of the sky. He
was surprised to see a star.
<P>
This drew his attention to the fact that the bright
lighting of these rooms was due to a multitude of very
faint glow lamps set about the cornices. There were
no windows. And he began to recall that along all
the vast chambers and passages he had traversed with
Howard he had observed no windows at all. Had
there been windows? There were windows on the
street indeed, but were they for light? Or was the
whole city lit day and night for evermore, so that
there was no night there?
<P>
And another thing dawned upon him. There was
no fireplace in either room. Was the season summer,
and were these merely summer apartments, or was
the whole City uniformly heated or cooled? He became 
interested in these questions, began examining
the smooth texture of the walls, the simply constructed
bed, the ingenious arrangements by which the labour
of bedroom service was practically abolished. And
over everything was a curious absence of deliberate
ornament, a bare grace of form and colour, that he
found very pleasing to the eye. There were several
very comfortable chairs, a light table on silent runners
carrying several bottles of fluids and glasses, and two
plates bearing a clear substance like jelly. Then he
noticed there were no books, no newspapers, no 
writing materials. "The world has changed indeed," he
said.
<P>
He observed one entire side of the outer room was
set with rows of peculiar double cylinders inscribed
with green lettering on white that harmonized With
the decorative scheme of the room, and in the centre
of this side projected a little apparatus about a yard
square and having a white smooth face to the room. A
chair faced this. He had a transitory idea that these
cylinders might be books, or a modern substitute for
books, but at first it did not seem so.
<P>
The lettering on the cylinders puzzled him. At first
sight it seemed like Russian. Then he noticed a 
suggestion of mutilated English about certain of the
words.
                   "oi Man huwdbi Kin"
<P>
forced itself on him as "The Man who would be
King." "Phonetic spelling," he said. He remembered 
reading a story with that title, then he recalled
the story vividly, one of the best stories in the world.
But this thing before him was not a book as he
understood it. He puzzled out the titles of two adjacent 
cylinders. 'The Heart of Darkness,' he had
never heard of before nor 'The Madonna of the
Future'--no doubt if they were indeed stories, they
were by post Victorian authors.
<P>
He puzzled over this peculiar cylinder for some time
and replaced it. Then he turned to the square apparatus 
and examined that. He opened a sort of lid
and found one of the double cylinders within, and
on the upper edge a little stud like the stud of an
electric bell. He pressed this and a rapid clicking
began and ceased. He became aware of voices and
music, and noticed a play of colour on the smooth
front face. He suddenly realised what this might be,
and stepped back to regard it.
<P>
On the flat surface was now a little picture, very
vividly coloured, and in this picture were figures that
moved. Not only did they move, but they were conversing 
in clear small voices. It was exactly like
reality viewed through an inverted opera glass and
heard through a long tube. His interest was seized
at once by the situation, which presented a man pacing
up and down and vociferating angry things to a pretty
but petulant woman. Both were in the picturesque
costume that seemed so strange to Graham. "I have
worked," said the man, "but what have you been
doing?"
<P>
"Ah!" said Graham. He forgot everything else,
and sat down in the chair. Within five minutes he
heard himself named, heard "when the Sleeper wakes,"
used jestingly as a proverb for remote postponement,
and passed himself by, a thing remote and incredible.
But in a little while he knew those two people like l .
intimate friends.
<P>
At last the miniature drama came to an end, and
the square face of the apparatus was blank again.
<P>
It was a strange world into which he had been permitted 
to see, unscrupulous, pleasure seeking, energetic, 
subtle, a world too of dire economic struggle;
there were allusions he did not understand, incidents
that conveyed strange suggestions of altered moral
ideals, flashes of dubious enlightenment. The blue
canvas that bulked so largely in his first impression
of the city ways appeared again and again as the 
costume of the common people. He had no doubt the
story was contemporary, and its intense realism was
undeniable. And the end had been a tragedy that
oppressed him. He sat staring at the blankness.
<P>
He started and rubbed his eyes. He had been so
absorbed in the latter-day substitute for a novel, that
he awoke to the little green and white room with more
than a touch of the surprise of his first awakening.
<P>
He stood up, and abruptly he was back in his own
wonderland. The clearness of the kinetoscope drama
passed, and the struggle in the vast place of streets,
the ambiguous Council, the swift phases of his waking
hour, came back. These people had spoken of the
Council with suggestions of a vague universality of
power. And they had spoken of the Sleeper; it had
not really struck him vividly at the time that he was
the Sleeper. He had to recall precisely what they had
said.
<P>
He walked into the bedroom and peered up through
the quick intervals of the revolving fan. As the fan
swept round, a dim turmoil like the noise of machinery
came in rhythmic eddies. All else was silence.
Though the perpetual day still irradiated his apartments, 
he perceived the little intermittent strip of sky
was now deep blue--black almost, with a dust of
little stars.
<P>
He resumed his examination of the rooms. He
could find no way of opening the padded door, no bell
nor other means of calling for attendance. His feeling 
of wonder was in abeyance; but he was curious,
anxious for information. He wanted to know exactly
how he stood to these new things. He tried to compose 
himself to wait until someone came to him.
Presently he became restless and eager for information, 
for distraction, for fresh sensations.
<P>
He went back to the apparatus in the other room,
and had soon puzzled out the method of replacing the
cylinders by others. As he did so, it came into his
mind that it must be these little appliances had fixed
the language so that it was still clear and understand-
able after two hundred years. The haphazard cylinders 
he substituted displayed a musical fantasia. At
first it was beautiful, and then it was sensuous. He
presently recognized what appeared to him to be an
altered version of the story of Tannhauser. The music
was unfamiliar. But the rendering was realistic, and
with a contemporary unfamiliarity. Tannhauser did
not go to a Venusberg, but to a Pleasure City. What
was a Pleasure City? A dream, surely, the fancy of
a fantastic, voluptuous writer.
<P>
He became interested, curious. The story developed 
with a flavour of strangely twisted sentimentality.
Suddenly he did not like it. He liked it less as it
proceeded.
<P>
He had a revulsion of feeling. These were no pictures, 
no idealisations, but photographed realities. He
wanted no more of the twenty-second century Venusberg. 
He forgot the part played by the model in
nineteenth century art, and gave way to an archaic
indignation. He rose, angry and half ashamed at himself 
for witnessing this thing even in solitude. He
pulled forward the apparatus, and with some violence
sought for a means of stopping its action. Something
snapped. A violet spark stung and convulsed his
arm and the thing was still. When he attempted next
day to replace these Tannhauser cylinders by another
pair, he found the apparatus broken....
<P>
He struck out a path oblique to the room and paced
to and fro, struggling with intolerable vast impressions. 
The things he had derived from the cylinders
and the things he had seen, conflicted, confused him.
It seemed to him the most amazing thing of all that
in his thirty years of life he had never tried to shape
a picture of these coming times. "We were making
the future," he said, "and hardly any of us troubled
to think what future we were making. And here it is!"
<P>
"What have they got to, what has been done? How
do I come into the midst of it all?" The vastness of
street and house he was prepared for, the multitudes of
people. But conflicts in the city ways! And the systematised 
sensuality of a class of rich men!
<P>
He thought of Bellamy, the hero of whose Socialistic 
Utopia had so oddly anticipated this actual experience. 
But here was no Utopia, no Socialistic state.
He had already seen enough to realise that the ancient
antithesis of luxury, waste and sensuality on the one
hand and abject poverty on the other, still prevailed.
He knew enough of the essential factors of life to
understand that correlation. And not only were the
buildings of the city gigantic and the crowds in the
street gigantic, but the voices he had heard in the
ways, the uneasiness of Howard, the very atmosphere
spoke of gigantic discontent. What country was he
in? Still England it seemed, and yet strangely
"un-English." His mind glanced at the rest of the
world, and saw only an enigmatical veil.
<P>
He prowled about his apartment, examining everything 
as a caged animal might do. He felt very tired,
felt that feverish exhaustion that does not admit of rest.
He listened for long spaces under the ventilator to
catch some distant echo of the tumults he felt must be
proceeding in the city.
<P>
He began to talk to himself. "Two hundred and
three years! " he said to himself over and over again,
laughing stupidly. "Then I am two hundred and
thirty-three years old! The oldest inhabitant. Surely
they haven't reversed the tendency of our time and
gone back to the rule of the oldest. My claims are
indisputable. Mumble, mumble. I remember the Bulgarian 
atrocities as though it was yesterday. 'Tis a
great age! Ha ha!" He was surprised at first to
hear himself laughing, and then laughed again deliberately 
and louder. Then he realised that he was
behaving foolishly. "Steady," he said. "Steady!"
<P>
His pacing became more regular. "This new
world," he said. "I don't understand it. __Why?__ . . .
But it is all __why!__"
<P>
"I suppose they can fly and do all sorts of things
Let me try and remember just how it began."
<P>
He was surprised at first to find how vague the
memories of his first thirty years had become. He
remembered fragments, for the most part trivial
moments, things of no great importance that he had
observed. His boyhood seemed the most accessible
at first, he recalled school books and certain lessons
in mensuration. Then he revived the more salient
features of his life, memories of the wife long since
dead, her magic influence now gone beyond corruption, 
of his rivals and friends and betrayers, of the
swift decision of this issue and that, and then of his ,
last years of misery, of fluctuating resolves, and at last
of his strenuous studies. In a little while he perceived
he had it all again; dim perhaps, like metal long laid
aside, but in no way defective or injured, capable of
re-polishing. And the hue of it was a deepening misery. 
Was it worth re-polishing? By a miracle he had
been lifted out of a life that had become intolerable.
<P>
He reverted to his present condition. He wrestled
with the facts in vain. It became an inextricable tangle. 
He saw the sky through the ventilator pink with
dawn. An old persuasion came out of the dark recesses 
of his memory. "I must sleep," he said. It
appeared as a delightful relief from this mental distress 
and from the growing pain and heaviness of his
limbs. He went to the strange little bed, lay down and
was presently asleep.
<P>
He was destined to become very familiar indeed
with these apartments before he left them, for he
remained imprisoned for three days. During that time
no one, except Howard, entered his prison. The marvel 
of his fate mingled with and in some way minimised 
the marvel of his survival. He had awakened
to mankind it seemed only to be snatched away into
this unaccountable solitude. Howard came regularly
with subtly sustaining and nutritive fluids, and light
and pleasant foods, quite strange to Graham. He
always closed the door carefully as he entered. On
matters of detail he was increasingly obliging, but the
bearing of Graham on the great issues that were evidently 
being contested so closely beyond the soundproof 
walls that enclosed him, he would not elucidate.
He evaded, as politely as possible, every question on
the position of affairs in the outer world.
<P>
And in those three days Graham's incessant
thoughts went far and wide. All that he had seen,
all this elaborate contrivance to prevent him seeing,
worked together in his mind. Almost every possible
interpretation of his position he debated--even as it
chanced, the right interpretation. Things that presently 
happened to him, came to him at last credible,
by virtue of this seclusion. When at length the
moment of his release arrived, it found him prepared.
<P>
Howard's bearing went far to deepen Graham's
impression of his own strange importance; the door
between its opening and closing seemed to admit with
him a breath of momentous happening. His enquiries 
became more definite and searching. Howard
retreated through protests and difficulties. The awakening 
was unforeseen, he repeated; it happened to
have fallen in with the trend of a social convulsion.
<P>
"To explain it I must tell you the history of a gross
and a half of years," protested Howard.
<P>
"The thing is this," said Graham. "You are
afraid of something I shall do. In some way I am
arbitrator--I might be arbitrator."
<P>
" It is not that. But you have--I may tell you
this much--the automatic increase of your property
puts great possibilities of interference in your hands.
And in certain other ways you have influence, with
your eighteenth century notions."
<P>
"Nineteenth century," corrected Graham.
<P>
"With your old world notions, anyhow, ignorant
as you are of every feature of our State."
<P>
"Am I a fool? "
<P>
"Certainly not."
<P>
"Do I seem to be the sort of man who would act
rashly?"
<P>
"You were never expected to act at all. No one
counted on your awakening. No one dreamt you
would ever awake. The Council had surrounded you
with antiseptic conditions. As a matter of fact, we
thought that you were dead--a mere arrest of decay.
And--but it is too complex. We dare not suddenly
--while you are still half awake."
<P>
"It won't do," said Graham. "Suppose it is as
you say--why am I not being crammed night and
day with facts and warnings and all the wisdom of the
time to fit me for my responsibilities? Am I any
wiser now than two days ago, if it is two days, when I
awoke?"
<P>
Howard pulled his lip.
<P>
"I am beginning to feel--every hour I feel more
clearly--a sense of complex concealment of which
you are the salient point. Is this Council, or committee, 
or whatever they are, cooking the accounts of
my estate? Is that it? "
<P>
"That note of suspicion--" said Howard.
<P>
" Ugh!" said Graham. "Now, mark my words, it
will be ill for those who have put me here. It will be
ill. I am alive. Make no doubt of it, I am alive.
Every day my pulse is stronger and my mind clearer
and more vigorous. No more quiescence. I am a
man come back to life. And I want to __live---__"
<P>
"__Live!__"
<P>
Howard's face lit with an idea. He came towards
Graham and spoke in an easy confidential tone.
<P>
"The Council secludes you here for your good.
You are restless. Naturally--an energetic man!
You find it dull here. But we are anxious that everything 
you may desire--every desire--every sort of
desire . . . There may be something. Is there
any sort of company? "
<P>
He paused meaningly.
" Yes," said Graham thoughtfully. " There is."
<P>
"Ah! __Now!__ We have treated you neglectfully."
<P>
"The crowds in yonder streets of yours."
<P>
"That," said Howard, "I am afraid--. But--"
<P>
Graham began pacing the room. Howard stood
near the door watching him. The implication of Howard's 
suggestion was only half evident to Graham
Company? Suppose he were to accept the proposal,
demand some sort of __company__? Would there be any
possibilities of gathering from the conversation o� this
additional person some vague inkling of the struggle
that had broken out so vividly at his waking moment?
He meditated again, and the suggestion took colour.
He turned on Howard abruptly.
<P>
"What do you mean by company? "
<P>
Howard raised his eyes and shrugged his shoulders.
"Human beings," he said, with a curious smile on his
heavy face.
<P>
"Our social ideas," he said, "have a certain increased 
liberality, perhaps, in comparison with your
times. If a man wishes to relieve such a tedium as
this--by feminine society, for instance. We think it
no scandal. We have cleared our minds of formulae.
There is in our city a class, a necessary class, no longer
despised--discreet--" 
<P>
Graham stopped dead. 
<P>
"It would pass the time," said Howard. "It is a
thing I should perhaps have thought of before, but,
as a matter of fact, so much is happening--"
<P>
He indicated the exterior world.
<P>
Graham hesitated. For a moment the figure of a
possible woman that his imagination suddenly created
dominated his mind with an intense attraction. Then
he flashed into anger.
<P>
"No I" he shouted.
<P>
He began striding rapidly up and down the room.
<P>
"Everything you say, everything you do, convinces
me--of some great issue in which I am concerned.
I do not want to pass the time, as you call it. Yes, I
know. Desire and indulgence are life in a sense--
and Death! Extinction! In my life before I slept
I had worked out that pitiful question. I will not
begin again. There is a city, a multitude--. And
meanwhile I am here like a rabbit in a bag."
<P>
His rage surged high. He choked for a moment
and began to wave his clenched fists. He gave way
to an anger fit, he swore archaic curses. His gestures
had the quality of physical threats.
<P>
"I do not know who your party may be. I am in
the dark, and you keep me in the dark. But I know
this, that I am secluded here for no good purpose.
For no good purpose. I warn you, I warn you of the
consequences. Once I come at my power--"
<P>
He realised that to threaten thus might be a danger
to himself. He stopped. Howard stood regarding
him with a curious expression.
<P>
"I take it this is a message to the Council," said
Howard.
<P>
Graham had a momentary impulse to leap upon the
man, fell or stun him. It must have shown upon his
face; at any rate Howard's movement was quick. In
a second the noiseless door had closed again, and the
man from the nineteenth century was alone.
<P>
For a moment he stood rigid, with clenched hands
half raised. Then he flung them down. "What a fool
I have been!" he said, and gave way to his anger again,
stamping about the room and shouting curses.
For a long time he kept himself in a sort of frenzy,
raging at his position, at his own folly, at the knaves
who had imprisoned him. He did this because he
did not want to look calmly at his position. He clung
to his anger--because he was afraid of Fear.
<P>
Presently he found himself reasoning with himself
This imprisonment was unaccountable, but no doubt
the legal forms--new legal forms--of the time permitted 
it. It must, of course, be legal. These people
were two hundred years further on in the march of
civilisation than the Victorian generation. It was not
likely they would be less--humane. Yet they had
cleared their minds of formulae! Was humanity a
formula as well as chastity?
<P>
His imagination set to work to suggest things that
might be done to him. The attempts of his reason to
dispose of these suggestions, though for the most part
logically valid, were quite unavailing. "Why should
anything be done to me? "
<P>
"If the worst comes to the worst," he found himself 
saying at last, "I can give up what they want.
But what do they want? And why don't they ask me
for it instead of cooping me up? "
<P>
He returned to his former preoccupation with the
Council's possible intentions. He began to reconsider
the details of Howard's behaviour, sinister glances,
inexplicable hesitations. Then, for a time, his mind
circled about the idea of escaping from these rooms;
but whither could he escape into this vast, crowded
world? He would be worse off than a Saxon yeoman
suddenly dropped into nineteenth century London.
And besides, how could anyone escape from these
rooms?
<P>
"How can it benefit anyone if harm should happen
to me? "
<P>
He thought of the tumult, the great social trouble
of which he was so unaccountably the axis. A text,
irrelevant enough and yet curiously insistent, came
floating up out of the darkness of his memory. This
also a Council had said:
<P>
"It is expedient for us that one man should die for
the people."
