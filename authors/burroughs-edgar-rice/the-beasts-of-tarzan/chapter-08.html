<article class="w3-container w3-justify">

Through the luxuriant, tangled vegetation of the Stygian
jungle night a great lithe body made its way sinuously
and in utter silence upon its soft padded feet.  Only two
blazing points of yellow-green flame shone occasionally with
the reflected light of the equatorial moon that now and again
pierced the softly sighing roof rustling in the night wind.
<P>
Occasionally the beast would stop with high-held nose,
sniffing searchingly.  At other times a quick, brief incursion
into the branches above delayed it momentarily in its steady
journey toward the east.  To its sensitive nostrils came the
subtle unseen spoor of many a tender four-footed creature,
bringing the slaver of hunger to the cruel, drooping jowl.
<P>
But steadfastly it kept on its way, strangely ignoring the
cravings of appetite that at another time would have sent
the rolling, fur-clad muscles flying at some soft throat.
<P>
All that night the creature pursued its lonely way, and the
next day it halted only to make a single kill, which it tore
to fragments and devoured with sullen, grumbling rumbles as
though half famished for lack of food.
<P>
It was dusk when it approached the palisade that surrounded
a large native village.  Like the shadow of a swift and silent
death it circled the village, nose to ground, halting at last
close to the palisade, where it almost touched the backs
of several huts.  Here the beast sniffed for a moment, and then,
turning its head upon one side, listened with up-pricked ears.
<P>
What it heard was no sound by the standards of human ears,
yet to the highly attuned and delicate organs of the beast
a message seemed to be borne to the savage brain.  A wondrous
transformation was wrought in the motionless mass of
statuesque bone and muscle that had an instant before stood
as though carved out of the living bronze.
<P>
As if it had been poised upon steel springs, suddenly released,
it rose quickly and silently to the top of the palisade,
disappearing, stealthily and catlike, into the dark space
between the wall and the back of an adjacent hut.
<P>
In the village street beyond women were preparing many little
fires and fetching cooking-pots filled with water, for a great
feast was to be celebrated ere the night was many hours older.  
About a stout stake near the centre of the circling fires
a little knot of black warriors stood conversing, their bodies
smeared with white and blue and ochre in broad and grotesque bands.  
Great circles of colour were drawn about their eyes and lips,
their breasts and abdomens, and from their clay-plastered
coiffures rose gay feathers and bits of long, straight wire.
<P>
The village was preparing for the feast, while in a hut at
one side of the scene of the coming orgy the bound victim of
their bestial appetites lay waiting for the end.  And such an end!
<P>
Tarzan of the Apes, tensing his mighty muscles, strained
at the bonds that pinioned him; but they had been re-enforced
many times at the instigation of the Russian, so that not even
the ape-man's giant brawn could budge them.
<P>
Death!
<P>
Tarzan had looked the Hideous Hunter in the face many a time,
and smiled.  And he would smile again tonight when he knew
the end was coming quickly; but now his thoughts were not
of himself, but of those others--the dear ones who must
suffer most because of his passing.
<P>
Jane would never know the manner of it.  For that he thanked Heaven;
and he was thankful also that she at least was safe in the heart of
the world's greatest city.  Safe among kind and loving friends who
would do their best to lighten her misery.
<P>
But the boy!
<P>
Tarzan writhed at the thought of him.  His son!  And now
he--the mighty Lord of the Jungle--he, Tarzan, King of the
Apes, the only one in all the world fitted to find and save the
child from the horrors that Rokoff's evil mind had planned--
had been trapped like a silly, dumb creature.  He was to die
in a few hours, and with him would go the child's last chance
of succour.
<P>
Rokoff had been in to see and revile and abuse him several
times during the afternoon; but he had been able to wring no
word of remonstrance or murmur of pain from the lips of the
giant captive.
<P>
So at last he had given up, reserving his particular bit of
exquisite mental torture for the last moment, when, just
before the savage spears of the cannibals should for ever make
the object of his hatred immune to further suffering, the
Russian planned to reveal to his enemy the true whereabouts of
his wife whom he thought safe in England.
<P>
Dusk had fallen upon the village, and the ape-men could hear
the preparations going forward for the torture and the feast.  
The dance of death he could picture in his mind's eye--for
he had seen the thing many times in the past.  Now he was
to be the central figure, bound to the stake.
<P>
The torture of the slow death as the circling warriors cut
him to bits with the fiendish skill, that mutilated without
bringing unconsciousness, had no terrors for him.  He was
inured to suffering and to the sight of blood and to cruel
death; but the desire to live was no less strong within him,
and until the last spark of life should flicker and go out, his
whole being would remain quick with hope and determination.  
Let them relax their watchfulness but for an instant, he
knew that his cunning mind and giant muscles would find a
way to escape--escape and revenge.
<P>
As he lay, thinking furiously on every possibility of self-
salvation, there came to his sensitive nostrils a faint and a
familiar scent.  Instantly every faculty of his mind was upon
the alert.  Presently his trained ears caught the sound of the
soundless presence without--behind the hut wherein he lay.  
His lips moved, and though no sound came forth that might
have been appreciable to a human ear beyond the walls of
his prison, yet he realized that the one beyond would hear.  
Already he knew who that one was, for his nostrils had told
him as plainly as your eyes or mine tell us of the identity of
an old friend whom we come upon in broad daylight.
<P>
An instant later he heard the soft sound of a fur-clad
body and padded feet scaling the outer wall behind the
hut and then a tearing at the poles which formed the wall.  
Presently through the hole thus made slunk a great beast,
pressing its cold muzzle close to his neck.
<P>
It was Sheeta, the panther.
<P>
The beast snuffed round the prostrate man, whining a little.  
There was a limit to the interchange of ideas which could
take place between these two, and so Tarzan could not be
sure that Sheeta understood all that he attempted to
communicate to him.  That the man was tied and helpless Sheeta
could, of course, see; but that to the mind of the panther this
would carry any suggestion of harm in so far as his master
was concerned, Tarzan could not guess.
<P>
What had brought the beast to him?  The fact that he had
come augured well for what he might accomplish; but when
Tarzan tried to get Sheeta to gnaw his bonds asunder the great
animal could not seem to understand what was expected of him,
and, instead, but licked the wrists and arms of the prisoner.
<P>
Presently there came an interruption.  Some one was
approaching the hut.  Sheeta gave a low growl and slunk into
the blackness of a far corner.  Evidently the visitor did not
hear the warning sound, for almost immediately he entered
the hut--a tall, naked, savage warrior.
<P>
He came to Tarzan's side and pricked him with a spear.  
From the lips of the ape-man came a weird, uncanny sound,
and in answer to it there leaped from the blackness of the
hut's farthermost corner a bolt of fur-clad death.  Full upon
the breast of the painted savage the great beast struck,
burying sharp talons in the black flesh and sinking
great yellow fangs in the ebon throat.
<P>
There was a fearful scream of anguish and terror from the black,
and mingled with it was the hideous challenge of the killing panther.
Then came silence--silence except for the rending of bloody flesh
and the crunching of human bones between mighty jaws.
<P>
The noise had brought sudden quiet to the village without.  
Then there came the sound of voices in consultation.
<P>
High-pitched, fear-filled voices, and deep, low tones of
authority, as the chief spoke.  Tarzan and the panther heard
the approaching footsteps of many men, and then, to Tarzan's
surprise, the great cat rose from across the body of its kill,
and slunk noiselessly from the hut through the aperture
through which it had entered.
<P>
The man heard the soft scraping of the body as it passed
over the top of the palisade, and then silence.  From the
opposite side of the hut he heard the savages approaching
to investigate.
<P>
He had little hope that Sheeta would return, for had the great
cat intended to defend him against all comers it would have
remained by his side as it heard the approaching savages without.
<P>
Tarzan knew how strange were the workings of the brains
of the mighty carnivora of the jungle--how fiendishly fearless
they might be in the face of certain death, and again how timid
upon the slightest provocation.  There was doubt in his mind
that some note of the approaching blacks vibrating with fear
had struck an answering chord in the nervous system of the panther,
sending him slinking through the jungle, his tail between his legs.
<P>
The man shrugged.  Well, what of it?  He had expected
to die, and, after all, what might Sheeta have done for him
other than to maul a couple of his enemies before a rifle in
the hands of one of the whites should have dispatched him!
<P>
If the cat could have released him!  Ah! that would have
resulted in a very different story; but it had proved beyond
the understanding of Sheeta, and now the beast was gone
and Tarzan must definitely abandon hope.
<P>
The natives were at the entrance to the hut now, peering
fearfully into the dark interior.  Two in advance held lighted
torches in their left hands and ready spears in their right.  
They held back timorously against those behind, who were
pushing them forward.
<P>
The shrieks of the panther's victim, mingled with those of
the great cat, had wrought mightily upon their poor nerves,
and now the awful silence of the dark interior seemed even
more terribly ominous than had the frightful screaming.
<P>
Presently one of those who was being forced unwillingly
within hit upon a happy scheme for learning first the precise
nature of the danger which menaced him from the silent interior.  
With a quick movement he flung his lighted torch into the
centre of the hut.  Instantly all within was illuminated
for a brief second before the burning brand was dashed out
against the earth floor.
<P>
There was the figure of the white prisoner still securely
bound as they had last seen him, and in the centre of the hut
another figure equally as motionless, its throat and breasts
horribly torn and mangled.
<P>
The sight that met the eyes of the foremost savages
inspired more terror within their superstitious breasts
than would the presence of Sheeta, for they saw only the
result of a ferocious attack upon one of their fellows.
<P>
Not seeing the cause, their fear-ridden minds were free to
attribute the ghastly work to supernatural causes, and with
the thought they turned, screaming, from the hut, bowling
over those who stood directly behind them in the exuberance
of their terror.
<P>
For an hour Tarzan heard only the murmur of excited voices
from the far end of the village.  Evidently the savages
were once more attempting to work up their flickering courage
to a point that would permit them to make another invasion
of the hut, for now and then came a savage yell, such
as the warriors give to bolster up their bravery upon the
field of battle.
<P>
But in the end it was two of the whites who first entered,
carrying torches and guns.  Tarzan was not surprised to
discover that neither of them was Rokoff.  He would have
wagered his soul that no power on earth could have tempted
that great coward to face the unknown menace of the hut.
<P>
When the natives saw that the white men were not attacked
they, too, crowded into the interior, their voices hushed with
terror as they looked upon the mutilated corpse of their comrade.  
The whites tried in vain to elicit an explanation from
Tarzan; but to all their queries he but shook his head, a grim
and knowing smile curving his lips.
<P>
At last Rokoff came.
<P>
His face grew very white as his eyes rested upon the bloody
thing grinning up at him from the floor, the face set in a
death mask of excruciating horror.
<P>
"Come!" he said to the chief.  "Let us get to work and
finish this demon before he has an opportunity to repeat this
thing upon more of your people."
<P>
The chief gave orders that Tarzan should be lifted and
carried to the stake; but it was several minutes before he
could prevail upon any of his men to touch the prisoner.
<P>
At last, however, four of the younger warriors dragged
Tarzan roughly from the hut, and once outside the pall of
terror seemed lifted from the savage hearts.
<P>
A score of howling blacks pushed and buffeted the prisoner
down the village street and bound him to the post in the
centre of the circle of little fires and boiling cooking-pots.
<P>
When at last he was made fast and seemed quite helpless
and beyond the faintest hope of succour, Rokoff's shrivelled
wart of courage swelled to its usual proportions when danger
was not present.
<P>
He stepped close to the ape-man, and, seizing a spear from
the hands of one of the savages, was the first to prod the
helpless victim.  A little stream of blood trickled down the
giant's smooth skin from the wound in his side; but no murmur
of pain passed his lips.
<P>
The smile of contempt upon his face seemed to infuriate
the Russian.  With a volley of oaths he leaped at the helpless
captive, beating him upon the face with his clenched fists
and kicking him mercilessly about the legs.
<P>
Then he raised the heavy spear to drive it through the
mighty heart, and still Tarzan of the Apes smiled
contemptuously upon him.
<P>
Before Rokoff could drive the weapon home the chief sprang
upon him and dragged him away from his intended victim.
<P>
"Stop, white man!" he cried.  "Rob us of this prisoner and
our death-dance, and you yourself may have to take his place."
<P>
The threat proved most effective in keeping the Russian
from further assaults upon the prisoner, though he continued
to stand a little apart and hurl taunts at his enemy.  He told
Tarzan that he himself was going to eat the ape-man's heart.  
He enlarged upon the horrors of the future life of Tarzan's
son, and intimated that his vengeance would reach as well to
Jane Clayton.
<P>
"You think your wife safe in England," said Rokoff.  
"Poor fool!  She is even now in the hands of one not even of
decent birth, and far from the safety of London and the
protection of her friends.  I had not meant to tell you this
until I could bring to you upon Jungle Island proof of her fate.
<P>
"Now that you are about to die the most unthinkably horrid
death that it is given a white man to die--let this word of
the plight of your wife add to the torments that you must
suffer before the last savage spear-thrust releases you from
your torture."
<P>
The dance had commenced now, and the yells of the circling
warriors drowned Rokoff's further attempts to distress
his victim.
<P>
The leaping savages, the flickering firelight playing upon
their painted bodies, circled about the victim at the stake.
<P>
To Tarzan's memory came a similar scene, when he had
rescued D'Arnot from a like predicament at the last moment
before the final spear-thrust should have ended his sufferings.  
Who was there now to rescue him?  In all the world there was
none able to save him from the torture and the death.
<P>
The thought that these human fiends would devour him
when the dance was done caused him not a single qualm of
horror or disgust.  It did not add to his sufferings as it would
have to those of an ordinary white man, for all his life Tarzan
had seen the beasts of the jungle devour the flesh of their kills.
<P>
Had he not himself battled for the grisly forearm of a great
ape at that long-gone Dum-Dum, when he had slain the fierce
Tublat and won his niche in the respect of the Apes of Kerchak?
<P>
The dancers were leaping more closely to him now.  The spears
were commencing to find his body in the first torturing pricks
that prefaced the more serious thrusts.
<P>
It would not be long now.  The ape-man longed for the last
savage lunge that would end his misery.
<P>
And then, far out in the mazes of the weird jungle, rose a
shrill scream.
<P>
For an instant the dancers paused, and in the silence of
the interval there rose from the lips of the fast-bound
white man an answering shriek, more fearsome and more terrible
than that of the jungle-beast that had roused it.
<P>
For several minutes the blacks hesitated; then, at the urging
of Rokoff and their chief, they leaped in to finish the
dance and the victim; but ere ever another spear touched the
brown hide a tawny streak of green-eyed hate and ferocity
bounded from the door of the hut in which Tarzan had been
imprisoned, and Sheeta, the panther, stood snarling beside
his master.
<P>
For an instant the blacks and the whites stood transfixed
with terror.  Their eyes were riveted upon the bared fangs of
the jungle cat.
<P>
Only Tarzan of the Apes saw what else there was emerging
from the dark interior of the hut.
<P>
