<p>Unhappy Mr. Crow could scarcely eat a mouthful of food after that meeting
on Saturday night, when he found the stranger talking to the gathering.
He was worried, because he knew that if the stranger succeeded in getting
Farmer Green to promise that he would not put tar on his corn the
following spring, everybody would choose the newcomer to be the leader of
all the crows in Pleasant Valley. And that was an honor that old Mr. Crow
had had for years.
</p>
<p>For two whole days he sulked at home. He wouldn't even go to his door
when anybody knocked. But on Monday evening Mr. Crow was the first to
reach the meeting-place in the pine woods, long before sunset. He sat
himself down in the leader's seat. And there he intended to stay as
long as he could.
</p><p>At last his neighbors came straggling to the woods. And when the stranger
arrived he seemed annoyed because he could not have Mr. Crow's seat. And
he said in an undertone to Mr. Crow:
</p><p>"I advise you to go home."
</p><p>The old gentleman glared at him. And he answered in a loud voice:
</p><p>"I advise you to go home yourself--<u>if you have a home to go to</u>!"
</p><p>Now, some people thought that Mr. Crow's answer was a good one. So they
laughed. And that made the stranger feel quite uncomfortable.
</p><p>But there were others who spoke up and said that Mr. Crow's remark was
very unkind. They knew that the stranger had a beautiful home, further
north, because he had told them all about it.
</p><p>And that made him feel better once more.
</p><p>Then old Mr. Crow called the meeting to order. And immediately the
stranger announced in a loud voice:
</p><p>"I saw Farmer Green and he has surrendered!"
</p><p>Then there was even more noise than is usual at a crow caucus. It was a
long time before old Mr. Crow could quiet the meeting. But he succeeded
at last. And when it was still he said to the stranger:
</p><p>"How do you know Farmer Green has surrendered?"
</p><p>It was so quiet that you could have heard a pine-needle fall, for
everyone was straining his ears to hear.
</p><p>"Farmer Green hung out the white flag to-day!" the stranger told them.
</p><p>Well, then there was another outburst. Of course, everybody knew that the
white flag was the sign of surrender. And it was some time before old Mr.
Crow could restore order.
</p><p>"I doubt it!" he cried, to everyone's astonishment.
</p><p>"It's true!" a voice shouted. "I know, for I saw--<u>caw</u>--<u>caw</u>! There was
not only <u>one</u> white flag; there were <u>dozens</u> of them!"
</p><p>And then Mr. Crow surprised them by laughing loudly. He stopped at last
and wiped his eyes--for he had actually wept, both with joy and
amusement.
</p><p>"What day is this?" he inquired.
</p><p>And a hundred voices answered: "Monday!"
</p><p>"Right!" said Mr. Crow. "And Monday is washday at the farmhouse. Those
white flags at Farmer Green's--they were the family wash, hung out on the
line to dry!"
</p><p>Then all Mr. Crow's neighbors crowded around him and told him that they
wanted him for their leader--and that they always had. They said that
they knew all the time that the stranger was a fraud.
</p><p>"Where is he?" someone inquired. "Let's fix him!"
</p><p>But when they turned to look for the stranger they couldn't find him
anywhere. He had vanished. Though Mr. Crow and his friends searched far
and wide for the bold, bad fellow, their efforts were all in vain. During
the bustle that had followed Mr. Crow's short speech the newcomer had
quietly made his escape. And no doubt it was just as well for him that he
left the meeting when he did.
</p><p>Some said he had hurried off towards the north; while others claimed that
he had gone in a southerly direction. And though they have kept an eye
out for him ever since, they have not found--or "fixed him"--yet.
