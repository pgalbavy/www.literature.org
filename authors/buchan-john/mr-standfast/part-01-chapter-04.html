<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I took the train three days later from King’s Cross to Edinburgh.
I went to the Pentland Hotel in Princes Street and left there
a suit-case containing some clean linen and a change of clothes.
I had been thinking the thing out, and had come to the conclusion
that I must have a base somewhere and a fresh outfit. Then in
well-worn tweeds and with no more luggage than a small trench
kit-bag, I descended upon the city of Glasgow.</p>

<p>I walked from the station to the address which Blenkiron had
given me. It was a hot summer evening, and the streets were filled
with bareheaded women and weary-looking artisans. As I made my
way down the Dumbarton Road I was amazed at the number of able-bodied
fellows about, considering that you couldn’t stir a mile on any
British front without bumping up against a Glasgow battalion.
Then I realised that there were such things as munitions and ships,
and I wondered no more.</p>

<p>A stout and dishevelled lady at a close-mouth directed me to
Mr Amos’s dwelling. "Twa stairs up. Andra will be in noo, havin’
his tea. He’s no yin for overtime. He’s generally hame on the
chap of six." I ascended the stairs with a sinking heart, for
like all South Africans I have a horror of dirt. The place was
pretty filthy, but at each landing there were two doors with well-polished
handles and brass plates. On one I read the name of Andrew Amos.</p>

<p>A man in his shirt-sleeves opened to me, a little man, without
a collar, and with an unbuttoned waistcoat. That was all I saw
of him in the dim light, but he held out a paw like a gorilla’s
and drew me in.</p>

<p>The sitting-room, which looked over many chimneys to a pale yellow
sky against which two factory stalks stood out sharply, gave me
light enough to observe him fully. He was about five feet four,
broad-shouldered, and with a great towsy head of grizzled hair.
He wore spectacles, and his face was like some old-fashioned Scots
minister’s, for he had heavy eyebrows and whiskers which joined
each other under his jaw, while his chin and enormous upper lip
were clean-shaven. His eyes were steely grey and very solemn,
but full of smouldering energy. His voice was enormous and would
have shaken the walls if he had not had the habit of speaking
with half-closed lips. He had not a sound tooth in his head.</p>

<p>A saucer full of tea and a plate which had once contained ham
and eggs were on the table. He nodded towards them and asked me
if I had fed.</p>

<p>"Ye’ll no eat onything? Well, some would offer ye a dram, but
this house is staunch teetotal. I door ye’ll have to try the nearest
public if ye’re thirsty."</p>

<p>I disclaimed any bodily wants, and produced my pipe, at which
he started to fill an old clay. "Mr Brand’s your name?" he asked
in his gusty voice. "I was expectin’ ye, but Dod! man ye’re late!"</p>

<p>He extricated from his trousers pocket an ancient silver watch,
and regarded it with disfavour. "The dashed thing has stoppit.
What do ye make the time, Mr Brand?"</p>

<p>He proceeded to prise open the lid of his watch with the knife
he had used to cut his tobacco, and, as he examined the works,
he turned the back of the case towards me. On the inside I saw
pasted Mary Lamington’s purple-and-white wafer.</p>

<p>I held my watch so that he could see the same token. His keen
eyes, raised for a second, noted it, and he shut his own with
a snap and returned it to his pocket. His manner lost its wariness
and became almost genial.</p>

<p>"Ye’ve come up to see Glasgow, Mr Brand? Well, it’s a steerin’
bit, and there’s honest folk bides in it, and some not so honest.
They tell me ye’re from South Africa. That’s a long gait away,
but I ken something aboot South Africa, for I had a cousin’s son
oot there for his lungs. He was in a shop in Main Street, Bloomfountain.
They called him Peter Dobson. Ye would maybe mind of him."</p>

<p>Then he discoursed of the Clyde. He was an incomer, he told me,
from the Borders, his native place being the town of Galashiels,
or, as he called it, "Gawly". "I began as a powerloom tuner in
Stavert’s mill. Then my father dee’d and I took up his trade of
jiner. But it’s no world nowadays for the sma’ independent business,
so I cam to the Clyde and learned a shipwright’s job. I may say
I’ve become a leader in the trade, for though I’m no an official
of the Union, and not likely to be, there’s no man’s word carries
more weight than mine. And the Goavernment kens that, for they’ve
sent me on commissions up and down the land to look at wuds and
report on the nature of the timber. Bribery, they think it is,
but Andrew Amos is not to be bribit. He’ll have his say about
any Goavernment on earth, and tell them to their face what he
thinks of them. Ay, and he’ll fight the case of the workingman
against his oppressor, should it be the Goavernment or the fatted
calves they ca’ Labour Members. Ye’ll have heard tell o’ the shop
stewards, Mr Brand?"</p>

<p>I admitted I had, for I had been well coached by Blenkiron in
the current history of industrial disputes.</p>

<p>"Well, I’m a shop steward. We represent the rank and file against
office-bearers that have lost the confidence o’ the workingman.
But I’m no socialist, and I would have ye keep mind of that. I’m
yin o’ the old Border radicals, and I’m not like to change. I’m
for individual liberty and equal rights and chances for all men.
I’ll no more bow down before a Dagon of a Goavernment official
than before the Baal of a feckless Tweedside laird. I’ve to keep
my views to mysel’, for thae young lads are all drucken-daft with
their wee books about Cawpital and Collectivism and a wheen long
senseless words I wouldna fyle my tongue with. Them and their
socialism! There’s more gumption in a page of John Stuart Mill
than in all that foreign trash. But, as I say, I’ve got to keep
a quiet sough, for the world is gettin’ socialism now like the
measles. It all comes of a defective eddication."</p>

<p>"And what does a Border radical say about the war?" I asked.</p>

<p>He took off his spectacles and cocked his shaggy brows at me.
"I’ll tell ye, Mr Brand. All that was bad in all that I’ve ever
wrestled with since I cam to years o’ discretion—Tories and lairds
and manufacturers and publicans and the Auld Kirk—all that was
bad, I say, for there were orra bits of decency, ye’ll find in
the Germans full measure pressed down and running over. When the
war started, I considered the subject calmly for three days, and
then I said: ‘Andra Amos, ye’ve found the enemy at last. The ones
ye fought before were in a manner o’ speakin’ just misguided friends.
It’s either you or the Kaiser this time, my man!’"</p>

<p>His eyes had lost their gravity and had taken on a sombre ferocity.
"Ay, and I’ve not wavered. I got a word early in the business
as to the way I could serve my country best. It’s not been an
easy job, and there’s plenty of honest folk the day will give
me a bad name. They think I’m stirrin’ up the men at home and
desertin’ the cause o’ the lads at the front. Man, I’m keepin’
them straight. If I didna fight their battles on a sound economic
isshue, they would take the dorts and be at the mercy of the first
blagyird that preached revolution. Me and my like are safety-valves,
if ye follow me. And dinna you make ony mistake, Mr Brand. The
men that are agitating for a rise in wages are not for peace.
They’re fighting for the lads overseas as much as for themselves.
There’s not yin in a thousand that wouldna sweat himself blind
to beat the Germans. The Goavernment has made mistakes, and maun
be made to pay for them. If it were not so, the men would feel
like a moose in a trap, for they would have no way to make their
grievance felt. What for should the big man double his profits
and the small man be ill set to get his ham and egg on Sabbath
mornin’? That’s the meaning o’ Labour unrest, as they call it,
and it’s a good thing, says I, for if Labour didna get its leg
over the traces now and then, the spunk o’ the land would be dead
in it, and Hindenburg could squeeze it like a rotten aipple."</p>

<p>I asked if he spoke for the bulk of the men.</p>

<p>"For ninety per cent in ony ballot. I don’t say that there’s
not plenty of riff-raff—the pint-and-a-dram gentry and the soft-heads
that are aye reading bits of newspapers, and muddlin’ their wits
with foreign whigmaleeries. But the average man on the Clyde,
like the average man in ither places, hates just three things,
and that’s the Germans, the profiteers, as they call them, and
the Irish. But he hates the Germans first."</p>

<p>"The Irish!" I exclaimed in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Ay, the Irish," cried the last of the old Border radicals. "Glasgow’s
stinkin’ nowadays with two things, money and Irish. I mind the
day when I followed Mr Gladstone’s Home Rule policy, and used
to threep about the noble, generous, warm-hearted sister nation
held in a foreign bondage. My Goad! I’m not speakin’ about Ulster,
which is a dour, ill-natured den, but our own folk all the same.
But the men that will not do a hand’s turn to help the war and
take the chance of our necessities to set up a bawbee rebellion
are hateful to Goad and man. We treated them like pet lambs and
that’s the thanks we get. They’re coming over here in thousands
to tak the jobs of the lads that are doing their duty. I was speakin’
last week to a widow woman that keeps a wee dairy down the Dalmarnock
Road. She has two sons, and both in the airmy, one in the Cameronians
and one a prisoner in Germany. She was telling me that she could
not keep goin’ any more, lacking the help of the boys, though
she had worked her fingers to the bone. ‘Surely it’s a crool job,
Mr Amos,’ she says, ‘that the Goavernment should tak baith my
laddies, and I’ll maybe never see them again, and let the Irish
gang free and tak the bread frae our mouth. At the gasworks across
the road they took on a hundred Irish last week, and every yin
o’ them as young and well set up as you would ask to see. And
my wee Davie, him that’s in Germany, had aye a weak chest, and
Jimmy was troubled wi’ a bowel complaint. That’s surely no justice!’...."</p>

<p>He broke off and lit a match by drawing it across the seat of
his trousers. "It’s time I got the gas lichtit. There’s some men
coming here at half-ten."</p>

<p>As the gas squealed and flickered in the lighting, he sketched
for me the coming guests. "There’s Macnab and Niven, two o’ my
colleagues. And there’s Gilkison of the Boiler-fitters, and a
lad Wilkie—he’s got consumption, and writes wee bits in the papers.
And there’s a queer chap o’ the name o’ Tombs—they tell me he
comes frae Cambridge, and is a kind of a professor there—anyway
he’s more stuffed wi’ havers than an egg wi’ meat. He telled me
he was here to get at the heart o’ the workingman, and I said
to him that he would hae to look a bit further than the sleeve
o’ the workin’-man’s jaicket. There’s no muckle in his head, poor
soul. Then there’ll be Tam Norie, him that edits our weekly paper—<em>Justice
for All</em>. Tam’s a humorist and great on Robert Burns, but
he hasna the balance o’ a dwinin’ teetotum.... Ye’ll understand,
Mr Brand, that I keep my mouth shut in such company, and don’t
express my own views more than is absolutely necessary. I criticise
whiles, and that gives me a name of whunstane common-sense, but
I never let my tongue wag. The feck o’ the lads comin’ the night
are not the real workingman—they’re just the froth on the pot,
but it’s the froth that will be useful to you. Remember they’ve
heard tell o’ ye already, and ye’ve some sort o’ reputation to
keep up."</p>

<p>"Will Mr Abel Gresson be here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Not yet. Him and me havena yet got to the point
o’ payin’ visits. But the men that come will be Gresson’s friends
and they’ll speak of ye to him. It’s the best kind of introduction
ye could seek."</p>

<p>The knocker sounded, and Mr Amos hastened to admit the first
comers. These were Macnab and Wilkie: the one a decent middle-aged
man with a fresh-washed face and a celluloid collar, the other
a round-shouldered youth, with lank hair and the large eyes and
luminous skin which are the marks of phthisis. "This is Mr Brand
boys, from South Africa," was Amos’s presentation. Presently came
Niven, a bearded giant, and Mr Norie, the editor, a fat dirty
fellow smoking a rank cigar. Gilkison of the Boiler-fitters, when
he arrived, proved to be a pleasant young man in spectacles who
spoke with an educated voice and clearly belonged to a slightly
different social scale. Last came Tombs, the Cambridge professor,
a lean youth with a sour mouth and eyes that reminded me of Launcelot
Wake.</p>

<p>"Ye’ll no be a mawgnate, Mr Brand, though ye come from South
Africa," said Mr Norie with a great guffaw.</p>

<p>"Not me. I’m a working engineer," I said. "My father was from
Scotland, and this is my first visit to my native country, as
my friend Mr Amos was telling you."</p>

<p>The consumptive looked at me suspiciously. "We’ve got two—three
of the comrades here that the cawpitalist Government expelled
from the Transvaal. If ye’re our way of thinking, ye will maybe
ken them."</p>

<p>I said I would be overjoyed to meet them, but that at the time
of the outrage in question I had been working on a mine a thousand
miles further north.</p>

<p>Then ensued an hour of extraordinary talk. Tombs in his sing-song
namby-pamby University voice was concerned to get information.
He asked endless questions, chiefly of Gilkison, who was the only
one who really understood his language. I thought I had never
seen anyone quite so fluent and so futile, and yet there was a
kind of feeble violence in him like a demented sheep. He was engaged
in venting some private academic spite against society, and I
thought that in a revolution he would be the class of lad I would
personally conduct to the nearest lamp-post. And all the while
Amos and Macnab and Niven carried on their own conversation about
the affairs of their society, wholly impervious to the tornado
raging around them.</p>

<p>It was Mr Norie, the editor, who brought me into the discussion.</p>

<p>"Our South African friend is very blate," he said in his boisterous
way. "Andra, if this place of yours wasn’t so damned teetotal
and we had a dram apiece, we might get his tongue loosened. I
want to hear what he’s got to say about the war. You told me this
morning he was sound in the faith."</p>

<p>"I said no such thing," said Mr Amos. "As ye ken well, Tam Norie,
I don’t judge soundness on that matter as you judge it. I’m for
the war myself, subject to certain conditions that I’ve often
stated. I know nothing of Mr Brand’s opinions, except that he’s
a good democrat, which is more than I can say of some o’ your
friends."</p>

<p>"Hear to Andra," laughed Mr Norie. "He’s thinkin’ the inspector
in the Socialist State would be a waur kind of awristocrat then
the Duke of Buccleuch. Weel, there’s maybe something in that.
But about the war he’s wrong. Ye ken my views, boys. This war
was made by the cawpitalists, and it has been fought by the workers,
and it’s the workers that maun have the ending of it. That day’s
comin’ very near. There are those that want to spin it out till
Labour is that weak it can be pit in chains for the rest o’ time.
That’s the manœuvre we’re out to prevent. We’ve got to beat the
Germans, but it’s the workers that has the right to judge when
the enemy’s beaten and not the cawpitalists. What do you say,
Mr Brand?"</p>

<p>Mr Norie had obviously pinned his colours to the fence, but he
gave me the chance I had been looking for. I let them have my
views with a vengeance, and these views were that for the sake
of democracy the war must be ended. I flatter myself I put my
case well, for I had got up every rotten argument and I borrowed
largely from Launcelot Wake’s armoury. But I didn’t put it too
well, for I had a very exact notion of the impression I wanted
to produce. I must seem to be honest and in earnest, just a bit
of a fanatic, but principally a hard-headed businessman who knew
when the time had come to make a deal. Tombs kept interrupting
me with imbecile questions, and I had to sit on him. At the end
Mr Norie hammered with his pipe on the table.</p>

<p>"That’ll sort ye, Andra. Ye’re entertain’ an angel unawares.
What do ye say to that, my man?"</p>

<p>Mr Amos shook his head. "I’ll no deny there’s something in it,
but I’m not convinced that the Germans have got enough of a wheepin’."
Macnab agreed with him; the others were with me. Norie was for
getting me to write an article for his paper, and the consumptive
wanted me to address a meeting.</p>

<p>"Wull ye say a’ that over again the morn’s night down at our
hall in Newmilns Street? We’ve got a lodge meeting o’ the <em>I.W.B.,
</em>and I’ll make them pit ye in the programme." He kept his
luminous eyes, like a sick dog’s, fixed on me, and I saw that
I had made one ally. I told him I had come to Glasgow to learn
and not to teach, but I would miss no chance of testifying to
my faith.</p>

<p>"Now, boys, I’m for my bed," said Amos, shaking the dottle from
his pipe. "Mr Tombs, I’ll conduct ye the morn over the Brigend
works, but I’ve had enough clavers for one evening. I’m a man
that wants his eight hours’ sleep."</p>

<p>The old fellow saw them to the door, and came back to me with
the ghost of a grin in his face.</p>

<p>"A queer crowd, Mr Brand! Macnab didna like what ye said. He
had a laddie killed in Gallypoly, and he’s no lookin’ for peace
this side the grave. He’s my best friend in Glasgow. He’s an elder
in the Gaelic kirk in the Cowcaddens, and I’m what ye call a free-thinker,
but we’re wonderful agreed on the fundamentals. Ye spoke your
bit verra well, I must admit. Gresson will hear tell of ye as
a promising recruit."</p>

<p>"It’s a rotten job," I said.</p>

<p>"Ay, it’s a rotten job. I often feel like vomiting over it mysel’.
But it’s no for us to complain. There’s waur jobs oot in France
for better men.... A word in your ear, Mr Brand. Could ye not
look a bit more sheepish? Ye stare folk ower straight in the een,
like a Hieland sergeant-major up at Maryhill Barracks." And he
winked slowly and grotesquely with his left eye.</p>

<p>He marched to a cupboard and produced a black bottle and glass.
"I’m blue-ribbon myself, but ye’ll be the better of something
to tak the taste out of your mouth. There’s Loch Katrine water
at the pipe there.... As I was saying, there’s not much ill in
that lot. Tombs is a black offence, but a dominie’s a dominie
all the world over. They may crack about their Industrial Workers
and the braw things they’re going to do, but there’s a wholesome
dampness about the tinder on Clydeside. They should try Ireland."</p>

<p>"Supposing," I said, "there was a really clever man who wanted
to help the enemy. You think he could do little good by stirring
up trouble in the shops here?"</p>

<p>"I’m positive."</p>

<p>"And if he were a shrewd fellow, he’d soon tumble to that?"</p>

<p>"Ay."</p>

<p>"Then if he still stayed on here he would be after bigger game—something
really dangerous and damnable?"</p>

<p>Amos drew down his brows and looked me in the face. "I see what
ye’re ettlin’ at. Ay! That would be my conclusion. I came to it
weeks syne about the man ye’ll maybe meet the morn’s night."</p>

<p>Then from below the bed he pulled a box from which he drew a
handsome flute. "Ye’ll forgive me, Mr Brand, but I aye like a
tune before I go to my bed. Macnab says his prayers, and I have
a tune on the flute, and the principle is just the same."</p>

<p>So that singular evening closed with music—very sweet and true
renderings of old Border melodies like "My Peggy is a young thing",
and "When the kye come hame". I fell asleep with a vision of Amos,
his face all puckered up at the mouth and a wandering sentiment
in his eye, recapturing in his dingy world the emotions of a boy.</p>

<p>The widow-woman from next door, who acted as house-keeper, cook,
and general factotum to the establishment, brought me shaving
water next morning, but I had to go without a bath. When I entered
the kitchen I found no one there, but while I consumed the inevitable
ham and egg, Amos arrived back for breakfast. He brought with
him the morning’s paper.</p>

<p>"The <em>Herald</em> says there’s been a big battle at Eepers,"
he announced.</p>

<p>I tore open the sheet and read of the great attack of 31 July
which was spoiled by the weather. "My God!" I cried. "They’ve
got St Julien and that dirty Frezenberg ridge ... and Hooge ...
and Sanctuary Wood. I know every inch of the damned place...."</p>

<p>"Mr Brand," said a warning voice, "that’ll never do. If our friends
last night heard ye talk like that ye might as well tak the train
back to London.... They’re speakin’ about ye in the yards this
morning. Ye’ll get a good turnout at your meeting the night, but
they’re Sayin’ that the polis will interfere. That mightna be
a bad thing, but I trust ye to show discretion, for ye’ll not
be muckle use to onybody if they jyle ye in Duke Street. I hear
Gresson will be there with a fraternal message from his lunatics
in America.... I’ve arranged that ye go down to Tam Norie this
afternoon and give him a hand with his bit paper. Tam will tell
ye the whole clash o’ the West country, and I look to ye to keep
him off the drink. He’s aye arguin’ that writin’ and drinkin’
gang thegither, and quotin’ Robert Burns, but the creature has
a wife and five bairns dependin’ on him."</p>

<p>I spent a fantastic day. For two hours I sat in Norie’s dirty
den, while he smoked and orated, and, when he remembered his business,
took down in shorthand my impressions of the Labour situation
in South Africa for his rag. They were fine breezy impressions,
based on the most whole-hearted ignorance, and if they ever reached
the Rand I wonder what my friends there made of Cornelius Brand,
their author. I stood him dinner in an indifferent eating-house
in a street off the Broomielaw, and thereafter had a drink with
him in a public-house, and was introduced to some of his less
reputable friends.</p>

<p>About tea-time I went back to Amos’s lodgings, and spent an hour
or so writing a long letter to Mr Ivery. I described to him everybody
I had met, I gave highly coloured views of the explosive material
on the Clyde, and I deplored the lack of clearheadedness in the
progressive forces. I drew an elaborate picture of Amos, and deduced
from it that the Radicals were likely to be a bar to true progress.
"They have switched their old militancy," I wrote, "on to another
track, for with them it is a matter of conscience to be always
militant." I finished up with some very crude remarks on economics
culled from the table-talk of the egregious Tombs. It was the
kind of letter which I hoped would establish my character in his
mind as an industrious innocent.</p>

<p>Seven o’clock found me in Newmilns Street, where I was seized
upon by Wilkie. He had put on a clean collar for the occasion
and had partially washed his thin face. The poor fellow had a
cough that shook him like the walls of a power-house when the
dynamos are going.</p>

<p>He was very apologetic about Amos. "Andra belongs to a past worrld,"
he said. "He has a big reputation in his society, and he’s a fine
fighter, but he has no kind of Vision, if ye understand me. He’s
an auld Gladstonian, and that’s done and damned in Scotland. He’s
not a Modern, Mr Brand, like you and me. But tonight ye’ll meet
one or two chaps that’ll be worth your while to ken. Ye’ll maybe
no go quite as far as them, but ye’re on the same road. I’m hoping
for the day when we’ll have oor Councils of Workmen and Soldiers
like the Russians all over the land and dictate our terms to the
pawrasites in Pawrliament. They tell me, too, the boys in the
trenches are comin’ round to our side."</p>

<p>We entered the hall by a back door, and in a little waiting-room
I was introduced to some of the speakers. They were a scratch
lot as seen in that dingy place. The chairman was a shop-steward
in one of the Societies, a fierce little rat of a man, who spoke
with a cockney accent and addressed me as "Comrade". But one of
them roused my liveliest interest. I heard the name of Gresson,
and turned to find a fellow of about thirty-five, rather sprucely
dressed, with a flower in his buttonhole. "Mr Brand," he said,
in a rich American voice which recalled Blenkiron’s. "Very pleased
to meet you, sir. We have come from remote parts of the globe
to be present at this gathering." I noticed that he had reddish
hair, and small bright eyes, and a nose with a droop like a Polish
Jew’s.</p>

<p>As soon as we reached the platform I saw that there was going
to be trouble. The hall was packed to the door, and in all the
front half there was the kind of audience I expected to see—working-men
of the political type who before the war would have thronged to
party meetings. But not all the crowd at the back had come to
listen. Some were scallawags, some looked like better-class clerks
out for a spree, and there was a fair quantity of khaki. There
were also one or two gentlemen not strictly sober.</p>

<p>The chairman began by putting his foot in it. He said we were
there tonight to protest against the continuation of the war and
to form a branch of the new British Council of Workmen and Soldiers.
He told them with a fine mixture of metaphors that we had got
to take the reins into our own hands, for the men who were running
the war had their own axes to grind and were marching to oligarchy
through the blood of the workers. He added that we had no quarrel
with Germany half as bad as we had with our own capitalists. He
looked forward to the day when British soldiers would leap from
their trenches and extend the hand of friendship to their German
comrades.</p>

<p>"No me!" said a solemn voice. "I’m not seekin’ a bullet in my
wame,"—at which there was laughter and cat-calls.</p>

<p>Tombs followed and made a worse hash of it. He was determined
to speak, as he would have put it, to democracy in its own language,
so he said "hell" several times, loudly but without conviction.
Presently he slipped into the manner of the lecturer, and the
audience grew restless. "I propose to ask myself a question—"
he began, and from the back of the hall came—"And a damned sully
answer ye’ll get." After that there was no more Tombs.</p>

<p>I followed with extreme nervousness, and to my surprise got a
fair hearing. I felt as mean as a mangy dog on a cold morning,
for I hated to talk rot before soldiers—especially before a couple
of Royal Scots Fusiliers, who, for all I knew, might have been
in my own brigade. My line was the plain, practical, patriotic
man, just come from the colonies, who looked at things with fresh
eyes, and called for a new deal. I was very moderate, but to justify
my appearance there I had to put in a wild patch or two, and I
got these by impassioned attacks on the Ministry of Munitions.
I mixed up a little mild praise of the Germans, whom I said I
had known all over the world for decent fellows. I received little
applause, but no marked dissent, and sat down with deep thankfulness.</p>

<p>The next speaker put the lid on it. I believe he was a noted
agitator, who had already been deported. Towards him there was
no lukewarmness, for one half of the audience cheered wildly when
he rose, and the other half hissed and groaned. He began with
whirlwind abuse of the idle rich, then of the middle-classes (he
called them the "rich man’s flunkeys’), and finally of the Government.
All that was fairly well received, for it is the fashion of the
Briton to run down every Government and yet to be very averse
to parting from it. Then he started on the soldiers and slanged
the officers ("gentry pups" was his name for them), and the generals,
whom he accused of idleness, of cowardice, and of habitual intoxication.
He told us that our own kith and kin were sacrificed in every
battle by leaders who had not the guts to share their risks. The
Scots Fusiliers looked perturbed, as if they were in doubt of
his meaning. Then he put it more plainly. "Will any soldier deny
that the men are the barrage to keep the officers’ skins whole?"</p>

<p>"That’s a bloody lee," said one of the Fusilier jocks.</p>

<p>The man took no notice of the interruption, being carried away
by the torrent of his own rhetoric, but he had not allowed for
the persistence of the interrupter. The jock got slowly to his
feet, and announced that he wanted satisfaction. "If ye open your
dirty gab to blagyird honest men, I’ll come up on the platform
and wring your neck."</p>

<p>At that there was a fine old row, some crying out "Order", some
"Fair play", and some applauding. A Canadian at the back of the
hall started a song, and there was an ugly press forward. The
hall seemed to be moving up from the back, and already men were
standing in all the passages and right to the edge of the platform.
I did not like the look in the eyes of these new-comers, and among
the crowd I saw several who were obviously plain-clothes policemen.</p>

<p>The chairman whispered a word to the speaker, who continued when
the noise had temporarily died down. He kept off the army and
returned to the Government, and for a little sluiced out pure
anarchism. But he got his foot in it again, for he pointed to
the Sinn Feiners as examples of manly independence. At that, pandemonium
broke loose, and he never had another look in. There were several
fights going on in the hall between the public and courageous
supporters of the orator.</p>

<p>Then Gresson advanced to the edge of the platform in a vain endeavour
to retrieve the day. I must say he did it uncommonly well. He
was clearly a practised speaker, and for a moment his appeal "Now,
boys, let’s cool down a bit and talk sense," had an effect. But
the mischief had been done, and the crowd was surging round the
lonely redoubt where we sat. Besides, I could see that for all
his clever talk the meeting did not like the look of him. He was
as mild as a turtle dove, but they wouldn’t stand for it. A missile
hurtled past my nose, and I saw a rotten cabbage envelop the baldish
head of the ex-deportee. Someone reached out a long arm and grabbed
a chair, and with it took the legs from Gresson. Then the lights
suddenly went out, and we retreated in good order by the platform
door with a yelling crowd at our heels.</p>

<p>It was here that the plain-clothes men came in handy. They held
the door while the ex-deportee was smuggled out by some side entrance.
That class of lad would soon cease to exist but for the protection
of the law which he would abolish. The rest of us, having less
to fear, were suffered to leak into Newmilns Street. I found myself
next to Gresson, and took his arm. There was something hard in
his coat pocket.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there was a big lamp at the point where we emerged,
and there for our confusion were the Fusilier jocks. Both were
strung to fighting pitch, and were determined to have someone’s
blood. Of me they took no notice, but Gresson had spoken after
their ire had been roused, and was marked out as a victim. With
a howl of joy they rushed for him.</p>

<p>I felt his hand steal to his side-pocket. "Let that alone, you
fool," I growled in his ear.</p>

<p>"Sure, mister," he said, and the next second we were in the thick
of it.</p>

<p>It was like so many street fights I have seen—an immense crowd
which surged up around us, and yet left a clear ring. Gresson
and I got against the wall on the side-walk, and faced the furious
soldiery. My intention was to do as little as possible, but the
first minute convinced me that my companion had no idea how to
use his fists, and I was mortally afraid that he would get busy
with the gun in his pocket. It was that fear that brought me into
the scrap. The jocks were sportsmen every bit of them, and only
one advanced to the combat. He hit Gresson a clip on the jaw with
his left, and but for the wall would have laid him out. I saw
in the lamplight the vicious gleam in the American’s eye and the
twitch of his hand to his pocket. That decided me to interfere
and I got in front of him.</p>

<p>This brought the second jock into the fray. He was a broad, thickset
fellow, of the adorable bandy-legged stocky type that I had seen
go through the Railway Triangle at Arras as though it were blotting-paper.
He had some notion of fighting, too, and gave me a rough time,
for I had to keep edging the other fellow off Gresson.</p>

<p>"Go home, you fool," I shouted. "Let this gentleman alone. I
don’t want to hurt you."</p>

<p>The only answer was a hook-hit which I just managed to guard,
followed by a mighty drive with his right which I dodged so that
he barked his knuckles on the wall. I heard a yell of rage, and
observed that Gresson seemed to have kicked his assailant on the
shin. I began to long for the police.</p>

<p>Then there was that swaying of the crowd which betokens the approach
of the forces of law and order. But they were too late to prevent
trouble. In self-defence I had to take my jock seriously, and
got in my blow when he had overreached himself and lost his balance.
I never hit anyone so unwillingly in my life. He went over like
a poled ox, and measured his length on the causeway.</p>

<p>I found myself explaining things politely to the constables.
"These men objected to this gentleman’s speech at the meeting,
and I had to interfere to protect him. No, no! I don’t want to
charge anybody. It was all a misunderstanding." I helped the stricken
jock to rise and offered him ten bob for consolation.</p>

<p>He looked at me sullenly and spat on the ground. "Keep your dirty
money," he said. "I’ll be even with ye yet, my man—you and that
red-headed scab. I’ll mind the looks of ye the next time I see
ye."</p>

<p>Gresson was wiping the blood from his cheek with a silk handkerchief.
"I guess I’m in your debt, Mr Brand," he said. "You may bet I
won’t forget it."</p>

<p>I returned to an anxious Amos. He heard my story in silence and
his only comment was—"Well done the Fusiliers!"</p>

<p>"It might have been worse, I’ll not deny," he went on. "Ye’ve
established some kind of a claim upon Gresson, which may come
in handy.... Speaking about Gresson, I’ve news for ye. He’s sailing
on Friday as purser in the <em>Tobermory</em>. The <em>Tobermory’s</em>
a boat that wanders every month up the West Highlands as far as
Stornoway. I’ve arranged for ye to take a trip on that boat, Mr
Brand."</p>

<p>I nodded. "How did you find out that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It took me some finding," he said dryly, "but I’ve ways and
means. Now I’ll not trouble ye with advice, for ye ken your job
as well as me. But I’m going north myself the morn to look after
some of the Ross-shire wuds, and I’ll be in the way of getting
telegrams at the Kyle. Ye’ll keep that in mind. Keep in mind,
too, that I’m a great reader of the <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em>
and that I’ve a cousin of the name of Ochterlony."</p>
