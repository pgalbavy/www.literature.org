<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>There is one great personage in the Gilberts: Tembinok’ of Apemama:
solely conspicuous, the hero of song, the butt of gossip.  Through the
rest of the group the kings are slain or fallen in tutelage: Tembinok’
alone remains, the last tyrant, the last erect vestige of a dead society.
The white man is everywhere else, building his houses, drinking his gin,
getting in and out of trouble with the weak native governments.  There is
only one white on Apemama, and he on sufferance, living far from court,
and hearkening and watching his conduct like a mouse in a cat’s ear.
Through all the other islands a stream of native visitors comes and goes,
travelling by families, spending years on the grand tour.  Apemama alone
is left upon one side, the tourist dreading to risk himself within the
clutch of Tembinok’.  And fear of the same Gorgon follows and troubles
them at home.  Maiana once paid him tribute; he once fell upon and seized
Nonuti: first steps to the empire of the archipelago.  A British warship
coming on the scene, the conqueror was driven to disgorge, his career
checked in the outset, his dear-bought armoury sunk in his own lagoon.
But the impression had been made; periodical fear of him still shakes the
islands; rumour depicts him mustering his canoes for a fresh onfall;
rumour can name his destination; and Tembinok’ figures in the patriotic
war-songs of the Gilberts like Napoleon in those of our grandfathers.
</p>
<p>We were at sea, bound from Mariki to Nonuti and Tapituea, when the wind
came suddenly fair for Apemama.  The course was at once changed; all
hands were turned-to to clean ship, the decks holy-stoned, all the cabin
washed, the trade-room overhauled.  In all our cruising we never saw the
<u>Equator</u> so smart as she was made for Tembinok’.  Nor was Captain Reid
alone in these coquetries; for, another schooner chancing to arrive
during my stay in Apemama, I found that she also was dandified for the
occasion.  And the two cases stand alone in my experience of South Sea
traders.
</p><p>We had on board a family of native tourists, from the grandsire to the
babe in arms, trying (against an extraordinary series of ill-luck) to
regain their native island of Peru. {275}  Five times already they had
paid their fare and taken ship; five times they had been disappointed,
dropped penniless upon strange islands, or carried back to Butaritari,
whence they sailed.  This last attempt had been no better-starred; their
provisions were exhausted.  Peru was beyond hope, and they had cheerfully
made up their minds to a fresh stage of exile in Tapituea or Nonuti.
With this slant of wind their random destination became once more
changed; and like the Calendar’s pilot, when the ‘black mountains’ hove
in view, they changed colour and beat upon their breasts.  Their camp,
which was on deck in the ship’s waist, resounded with complaint.  They
would be set to work, they must become slaves, escape was hopeless, they
must live and toil and die in Apemama, in the tyrant’s den.  With this
sort of talk they so greatly terrified their children, that one (a big
hulking boy) must at last be torn screaming from the schooner’s side.
And their fears were wholly groundless.  I have little doubt they were
not suffered to be idle; but I can vouch for it that they were kindly and
generously used.  For, the matter of a year later, I was once more
shipmate with these inconsistent wanderers on board the <u>Janet Nicoll</u>.
Their fare was paid by Tembinok’; they who had gone ashore from the
<u>Equator</u> destitute, reappeared upon the <u>Janet</u> with new clothes, laden
with mats and presents, and bringing with them a magazine of food, on
which they lived like fighting-cocks throughout the voyage; I saw them at
length repatriated, and I must say they showed more concern on quitting
Apemama than delight at reaching home.
</p><p>We entered by the north passage (Sunday, September 1st), dodging among
shoals.  It was a day of fierce equatorial sunshine; but the breeze was
strong and chill; and the mate, who conned the schooner from the
cross-trees, returned shivering to the deck.  The lagoon was thick with
many-tinted wavelets; a continuous roaring of the outer sea overhung the
anchorage; and the long, hollow crescent of palm ruffled and sparkled in
the wind.  Opposite our berth the beach was seen to be surmounted for
some distance by a terrace of white coral seven or eight feet high and
crowned in turn by the scattered and incongruous buildings of the palace.
The village adjoins on the south, a cluster of high-roofed maniap’s.  And
village and palace seemed deserted.
</p><p>We were scarce yet moored, however, before distant and busy figures
appeared upon the beach, a boat was launched, and a crew pulled out to us
bringing the king’s ladder.  Tembinok’ had once an accident; has feared
ever since to entrust his person to the rotten chandlery of South Sea
traders; and devised in consequence a frame of wood, which is brought on
board a ship as soon as she appears, and remains lashed to her side until
she leave.  The boat’s crew, having applied this engine, returned at once
to shore.  They might not come on board; neither might we land, or not
without danger of offence; the king giving pratique in person.  An
interval followed, during which dinner was delayed for the great man—the
prelude of the ladder, giving us some notion of his weighty body and
sensible, ingenious character, had highly whetted our curiosity; and it
was with something like excitement that we saw the beach and terrace
suddenly blacken with attendant vassals, the king and party embark, the
boat (a man-of-war gig) come flying towards us dead before the wind, and
the royal coxswain lay us cleverly aboard, mount the ladder with a
jealous diffidence, and descend heavily on deck.
</p><p>Not long ago he was overgrown with fat, obscured to view, and a burthen
to himself.  Captains visiting the island advised him to walk; and though
it broke the habits of a life and the traditions of his rank, he
practised the remedy with benefit.  His corpulence is now portable; you
would call him lusty rather than fat; but his gait is still dull,
stumbling, and elephantine.  He neither stops nor hastens, but goes about
his business with an implacable deliberation.  We could never see him and
not be struck with his extraordinary natural means for the theatre: a
beaked profile like Dante’s in the mask, a mane of long black hair, the
eye brilliant, imperious, and inquiring: for certain parts, and to one
who could have used it, the face was a fortune.  His voice matched it
well, being shrill, powerful, and uncanny, with a note like a sea-bird’s.
Where there are no fashions, none to set them, few to follow them if they
were set, and none to criticise, he dresses—as Sir Charles Grandison
lived—‘to his own heart.’  Now he wears a woman’s frock, now a naval
uniform; now (and more usually) figures in a masquerade costume of his
own design: trousers and a singular jacket with shirt tails, the cut and
fit wonderful for island workmanship, the material always handsome,
sometimes green velvet, sometimes cardinal red silk.  This masquerade
becomes him admirably.  In the woman’s frock he looks ominous and weird
beyond belief.  I see him now come pacing towards me in the cruel sun,
solitary, a figure out of Hoffmann.
</p><p>A visit on board ship, such as that at which we now assisted, makes a
chief part and by far the chief diversion of the life of Tembinok’.  He
is not only the sole ruler, he is the sole merchant of his triple
kingdom, Apemama, Aranuka, and Kuria, well-planted islands.  The taro
goes to the chiefs, who divide as they please among their immediate
adherents; but certain fish, turtles—which abound in Kuria,—and the whole
produce of the coco-palm, belong exclusively to Tembinok’.  ‘A’ cobra
{279a} berong me,’ observed his majesty with a wave of his hand; and he
counts and sells it by the houseful.  ‘You got copra, king?’ I have heard
a trader ask.  ‘I got two, three outches,’ {279b} his majesty replied: ‘I
think three.’  Hence the commercial importance of Apemama, the trade of
three islands being centred there in a single hand; hence it is that so
many whites have tried in vain to gain or to preserve a footing; hence
ships are adorned, cooks have special orders, and captains array
themselves in smiles, to greet the king.  If he be pleased with his
welcome and the fare he may pass days on board, and, every day, and
sometimes every hour, will be of profit to the ship.  He oscillates
between the cabin, where he is entertained with strange meats, and the
trade-room, where he enjoys the pleasures of shopping on a scale to match
his person.  A few obsequious attendants squat by the house door,
awaiting his least signal.  In the boat, which has been suffered to drop
astern, one or two of his wives lie covered from the sun under mats,
tossed by the short sea of the lagoon, and enduring agonies of heat and
tedium.  This severity is now and then relaxed and the wives allowed on
board.  Three or four were thus favoured on the day of our arrival:
substantial ladies airily attired in <u>ridis</u>.  Each had a share of copra,
her <u>peculium</u>, to dispose of for herself.  The display in the
trade-room—hats, ribbbons, dresses, scents, tins of salmon—the pride of
the eye and the lust of the flesh—tempted them in vain.  They had but the
one idea—tobacco, the island currency, tantamount to minted gold;
returned to shore with it, burthened but rejoicing; and late into the
night, on the royal terrace, were to be seen counting the sticks by
lamplight in the open air.
</p><p>The king is no such economist.  He is greedy of things new and foreign.
House after house, chest after chest, in the palace precinct, is already
crammed with clocks, musical boxes, blue spectacles, umbrellas, knitted
waistcoats, bolts of stuff, tools, rifles, fowling-pieces, medicines,
European foods, sewing-machines, and, what is more extraordinary, stoves:
all that ever caught his eye, tickled his appetite, pleased him for its
use, or puzzled him with its apparent inutility.  And still his lust is
unabated.  He is possessed by the seven devils of the collector.  He
hears a thing spoken of, and a shadow comes on his face.  ‘I think I no
got him,’ he will say; and the treasures he has seem worthless in
comparison.  If a ship be bound for Apemama, the merchant racks his brain
to hit upon some novelty.  This he leaves carelessly in the main cabin or
partly conceals in his own berth, so that the king shall spy it for
himself.  ‘How much you want?’ inquires Tembinok’, passing and pointing.
‘No, king; that too dear,’ returns the trader.  ‘I think I like him,’
says the king.  This was a bowl of gold-fish.  On another occasion it was
scented soap.  ‘No, king; that cost too much,’ said the trader; ‘too good
for a Kanaka.’  ‘How much you got?  I take him all,’ replied his majesty,
and became the lord of seventeen boxes at two dollars a cake.  Or again,
the merchant feigns the article is not for sale, is private property, an
heirloom or a gift; and the trick infallibly succeeds.  Thwart the king
and you hold him.  His autocratic nature rears at the affront of
opposition.  He accepts it for a challenge; sets his teeth like a hunter
going at a fence; and with no mark of emotion, scarce even of interest,
stolidly piles up the price.  Thus, for our sins, he took a fancy to my
wife’s dressing-bag, a thing entirely useless to the man, and sadly
battered by years of service.  Early one forenoon he came to our house,
sat down, and abruptly offered to purchase it.  I told him I sold
nothing, and the bag at any rate was a present from a friend; but he was
acquainted with these pretexts from of old, and knew what they were worth
and how to meet them.  Adopting what I believe is called ‘the object
method,’ he drew out a bag of English gold, sovereigns and
half-sovereigns, and began to lay them one by one in silence on the
table; at each fresh piece reading our faces with a look.  In vain I
continued to protest I was no trader; he deigned not to reply.  There
must have been twenty pounds on the table, he was still going on, and
irritation had begun to mingle with our embarrassment, when a happy idea
came to our delivery.  Since his majesty thought so much of the bag, we
said, we must beg him to accept it as a present.  It was the most
surprising turn in Tembinok’s experience.  He perceived too late that his
persistence was unmannerly; hung his head a while in silence; then,
lifting up a sheepish countenance, ‘I ‘shamed,’ said the tyrant.  It was
the first and the last time we heard him own to a flaw in his behaviour.
Half an hour after he sent us a camphor-wood chest worth only a few
dollars—but then heaven knows what Tembinok’ had paid for it.
</p><p>Cunning by nature, and versed for forty years in the government of men,
it must not be supposed that he is cheated blindly, or has resigned
himself without resistance to be the milch-cow of the passing trader.
His efforts have been even heroic.  Like Nakaeia of Makin, he has owned
schooners.  More fortunate than Nakaeia, he has found captains.  Ships of
his have sailed as far as to the colonies.  He has trafficked direct, in
his own bottoms, with New Zealand.  And even so, even there, the
world-enveloping dishonesty of the white man prevented him; his profit
melted, his ship returned in debt, the money for the insurance was
embezzled, and when the <u>Coronet</u> came to be lost, he was astonished to
find he had lost all.  At this he dropped his weapons; owned he might as
hopefully wrestle with the winds of heaven; and like an experienced
sheep, submitted his fleece thenceforward to the shearers.  He is the
last man in the world to waste anger on the incurable; accepts it with
cynical composure; asks no more in those he deals with than a certain
decency of moderation; drives as good a bargain as he can; and when he
considers he is more than usually swindled, writes it in his memory
against the merchant’s name.  He once ran over to me a list of captains
and supercargoes with whom he had done business, classing them under
three heads: ‘He cheat a litty’—‘He cheat plenty’—and ‘I think he cheat
too much.’  For the first two classes he expressed perfect toleration;
sometimes, but not always, for the third.  I was present when a certain
merchant was turned about his business, and was the means (having a
considerable influence ever since the bag) of patching up the dispute.
Even on the day of our arrival there was like to have been a hitch with
Captain Reid: the ground of which is perhaps worth recital.  Among goods
exported specially for Tembinok’ there is a beverage known (and labelled)
as Hennessy’s brandy.  It is neither Hennessy, nor even brandy; is about
the colour of sherry, but is not sherry; tastes of kirsch, and yet
neither is it kirsch.  The king, at least, has grown used to this amazing
brand, and rather prides himself upon the taste; and any substitution is
a double offence, being at once to cheat him and to cast a doubt upon his
palate.  A similar weakness is to be observed in all connoisseurs.  Now
the last case sold by the <u>Equator</u> was found to contain a different and
I would fondly fancy a superior distillation; and the conversation opened
very black for Captain Reid.  But Tembinok’ is a moderate man.  He was
reminded and admitted that all men were liable to error, even himself;
accepted the principle that a fault handsomely acknowledged should be
condoned; and wound the matter up with this proposal: ‘Tuppoti {283} I
mi’take, you ’peakee me.  Tuppoti you mi’take, I ’peakee you.  Mo’
betta.’
</p><p>After dinner and supper in the cabin, a glass or two of ‘Hennetti’—the
genuine article this time, with the kirsch bouquet,—and five hours’
lounging on the trade-room counter, royalty embarked for home.  Three
tacks grounded the boat before the palace; the wives were carried ashore
on the backs of vassals; Tembinok’ stepped on a railed platform like a
steamer’s gangway, and was borne shoulder high through the shallows, up
the beach, and by an inclined plane, paved with pebbles, to the glaring
terrace where he dwells.
