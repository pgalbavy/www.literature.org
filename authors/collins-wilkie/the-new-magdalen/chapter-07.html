<P>
"You look very pale this morning, my child."
<P>
Mercy sighed wearily. "I am not well," she answered. "The
slightest noises startle me. I feel tired if I only walk across
the room."
<P>
Lady Janet patted her kindly on the shoulder. "We must try what a
change will do for you. Which shall it be? the Continent or the
sea-side?"
<P>
"Your ladyship is too kind to me."
<P>
"It is impossible to be too kind to you."
<P>
Mercy started. The color flowed charmingly over her pale face.
"Oh!" she exclaimed, impulsively. "Say that again!"
<P>
"Say it again?" repeated Lady Janet, with a look of surprise.
<P>
"Yes! Don't think me presuming; only think me vain. I can't hear
you say too often that you have learned to like me. Is it really
a pleasure to you to have me in the house? Have I always behaved
well since I have been with you?"
<P>
(The one excuse for the act of personation--if excuse there could
be--lay in the affirmative answer to those questions. It would be
something, surely, to say of the false Grace that the true Grace
could not have been worthier of her welcome, if the true Grace
had been received at Mablethorpe House!)
<P>
Lady Janet was partly touched, partly amused, by the
extraordinary earnestness of the appeal that had been made to
her.
<P>
"Have you behaved well?" she repeated. "My dear, you talk as if
you were a child!" She laid her hand caressingly on Mercy's arm,
and continued, in a graver tone: "It is hardly too much to say,
Grace, that I bless the day when you first came to me. I do
believe I could be hardly fonder of you if you were my own
daughter."
<P>
Mercy suddenly turned her head aside, so as to hide her face.
Lady Janet, still touching her arm, felt it tremble. "What is the
matter with you?" she asked, in her abrupt, downright manner.
<P>
"I am only very grateful to your ladyship--that is all." The
words were spoken faintly, in broken tones. The face was still
averted from Lady Janet's view. "What have I said to provoke
this?" wondered the old lady. "Is she in the melting mood to-day?
If she is, now is the time to say a word for Horace!" Keeping
that excellent object in view, Lady Janet approached the delicate
topic with all needful caution at starting.
<P>
"We have got on so well together," she resumed, "that it will not
be easy for either of us to feel reconciled to a change in our
lives. At my age, it will fall hardest on me. What shall I do,
Grace, when the day comes for parting with my adopted daughter?"
<P>
Mercy started, and showed her face again. The traces of tears
were in her eyes. "Why should I leave you?" she asked, in a tone
of alarm.
<P>
"Surely you know!" exclaimed Lady Janet.
<P>
"Indeed I don't. Tell me why."
<P>
"Ask Horace to tell you."
<P>
The last allusion was too plain to be misunderstood. Mercy's head
drooped. She began to tremble again. Lady Janet looked at her in
blank amazement.
<P>
"Is there anything wrong between Horace and you?" she asked.
<P>
"No."
<P>
"You know your own heart, my dear child? You have surely not
encouraged Horace without loving him?"
<P>
"Oh no!"
<P>
"And yet--"
<P>
For the first time in their experience of each other Mercy
ventured to interrupt her benefactress. "Dear Lady Janet," she
interposed, gently, "I am in no hurry to be married. There will
be plenty of time in the future to talk of that. You had
something you wished to say to me. What is it?"
<P>
It was no easy matter to disconcert Lady Janet Roy. But that last
question fairly reduced her to silence. After all that had
passed, there sat her young companion, innocent of the faintest
suspicion of the subject that was to be discussed between them!
"What are the young women of the present time made of?" thought
the old lady, utterly at a loss to know what to say next. Mercy
waited, on her side, with an impenetrable patience which only
aggravated the difficulties of the position. The silence was fast
threatening to bring the interview to a sudden and untimely end,
when the door from the library opened, and a man-servant, bearing
a little silver salver, entered the room.
<P>
Lady Janet's rising sense of annoyance instantly seized on the
servant as a victim. "What do you want?" she asked, sharply. "I
never rang for you."
<P>
"A letter, my lady. The messenger waits for an answer."
<P>
The man presented his salver with the letter on it, and withdrew.
<P>
Lady Janet recognized the handwriting on the address with a look
of surprise. "Excuse me, my dear," she said, pausing, with her
old-fashioned courtesy, before she opened the envelope. Mercy
made the necessary acknowledgment, and moved away to the other
end of the room, little thinking that the arrival of the letter
marked a crisis in her life. Lady Janet put on her spectacles.
"Odd that he should have come back already!" she said to herself,
as she threw the empty envelope on the table.
<P>
The letter contained these lines, the writer of them being no
other than the man who had preached in the chapel of the Refuge:
<P>
"DEAR AUNT--I am back again in London before my time. My friend
the rector has shortened his holiday, and has resumed his duties
in the country. I am afraid you will blame me when you hear of
the reasons which have hastened his return. The sooner I make my
confession, the easier I shall feel. Besides, I have a special
object in wishing to see you as soon as possible. May I follow my
letter to Mablethorpe House? And may I present a lady to you--a
perfect stranger--in whom I am interested? Pray say Yes, by the
bearer, and oblige your affectionate nephew,
<P>
"JULIAN GRAY."
<P>
Lady Janet referred again suspiciously to the sentence in the
letter which alluded to the "lady."
<P>
Julian Gray was her only surviving nephew, the son of a favorite
sister whom she had lost. He would have held no very exalted
position in the estimation of his aunt--who regarded his views in
politics and religion with the strongest aversion--but for his
marked resemblance to his mother. This pleaded for him with the
old lady, aided as it was by the pride that she secretly felt in
the early celebrity which the young clergyman had achieved as a
writer and a preacher. Thanks to these mitigating circumstances,
and to Julian's inexhaustible good-humor, the aunt and  the nephe
w generally met on friendly terms. Apart from what she called
"his detestable opinions," Lady Janet was sufficiently interested
in Julian to feel some curiosity about the mysterious "lady"
mentioned in the letter. Had he determined to settle in life? Was
his choice already made? And if so, would it prove to be a choice
acceptable to the family? Lady Janet's bright face showed signs
of doubt as she asked herself that last question. Julian's
liberal views were capable of leading him to dangerous extremes.
His aunt shook her head ominously as she rose from the sofa and
advanced to the library door.
<P>
"Grace," she said, pausing and turning round, "I have a note to
write to my nephew. I shall be back directly."
<P>
Mercy approached her, from the opposite extremity of the room,
with an exclamation of surprise.
<P>
"Your nephew?" she repeated. "Your ladyship never told me you had
a nephew."
<P>
Lady Janet laughed. "I must have had it on the tip of my tongue
to tell you, over and over again," she said. "But we have had so
many things to talk about--and, to own the truth, my nephew is
not one of my favorite subjects of conversation. I don't mean
that I dislike him; I detest his principles, my dear, that's all.
However, you shall form your own opinion of him; he is coming to
see me to-day. Wait here till I return; I have something more to
say about Horace."
<P>
Mercy opened the library door for her, closed it again, and
walked slowly to and fro alone in the room, thinking.
<P>
Was her mind running on Lady Janet's nephew? No. Lady Janet's
brief allusion to her relative had not led her into alluding to
him by his name. Mercy was still as ignorant as ever that the
preacher at the Refuge and the nephew of her benefactress were
one and the same man. Her memory was busy now with the tribute
which Lady Janet had paid to her at the outset of the interview
between them: "It is hardly too much to say, Grace, that I bless
the day when you first came to me." For the moment there was balm
for her wounded spirit in the remembrance of those words. Grace
Roseberry herself could surely have earned no sweeter praise than
the praise that she had won. The next instant she was seized with
a sudden horror of her own successful fraud. The sense of her
degradation had never been so bitterly present to her as at that
moment. If she could only confess the truth--if she could
innocently enjoy her harmless life at Mablethorpe House--what a
grateful, happy woman she might be! Was it possible (if she made
the confession) to trust to her own good conduct to plead her
excuse? No! Her calmer sense warned her that it was hopeless. The
place she had won--honestly won--in Lady Janet's estimation had
been obtained by a trick. Nothing could alter, nothing could
excuse, _that_. She took out her handkerchief and dashed away the
useless tears that had gathered in her eyes, and tried to turn
her thoughts some other way. What was it Lady Janet had said on
going into the library? She had said she was coming back to speak
about Horace. Mercy guessed what the object was; she knew but too
well what Horace wanted of her. How was she to meet the
emergency? In the name of Heaven, what was to be done? Could she
let the man who loved her--the man whom she loved--drift
blindfold into marriage with such a woman as she had been? No! it
was her duty to warn him. How? Could she break his heart, could
she lay his life waste by speaking the cruel words which might
part them forever? "I can't tell him! I won't tell him!" she
burst out, passionately. "The disgrace of it would kill me!" Her
varying mood changed as the words escaped her. A reckless
defiance of her own better nature--that saddest of all the forms
in which a woman's misery can express itself--filled her heart
with its poisoning bitterness. She sat down again on the sofa
with eyes that glittered and cheeks suffused with an angry red.
"I am no worse than another woman!" she thought. "Another woman
might have married him for his money." The next moment the
miserable insufficiency of her own excuse for deceiving him
showed its hollowness, self-exposed. She covered her face with
her hands, and found refuge--where she had often found refuge
before--in the helpless resignation of despair. "Oh, that I had
died before I entered this house! Oh, that I could die and have
done with it at this moment!" So the struggle had ended with her
hundreds of times already. So it ended now.
<P>
<P>
<P>
The door leading into the billiard-room opened softly. Horace
Holmcroft had waited to hear the result of Lady Janet's
interference in his favor until he could wait no longer.
<P>
He looked in cautiously, ready to withdraw again unnoticed if the
two were still talking together. The absence of Lady Janet
suggested that the interview had come to an end. Was his
betrothed wife waiting alone to speak to him on his return to the
room? He advanced a few steps. She never moved; she sat heedless,
absorbed in her thoughts. Were they thoughts of _him?_ He
advanced a little nearer, and called to her.
<P>
"Grace!"
<P>
She sprang to her feet, with a faint cry. "I wish you wouldn't
startle me," she said, irritably, sinking back on the sofa. "Any
sudden alarm sets my heart beating as if it would choke me."
<P>
Horace pleaded for pardon with a lover's humility. In her present
state of nervous irritation she was not to be appeased. She
looked away from him in silence. Entirely ignorant of the
paroxysm of mental suffering through which she had just passed,
he seated himself by her side, and asked her gently if she had
seen Lady Janet. She made an affirmative answer with an
unreasonable impatience of tone and manner which would have
warned an older and more experienced man to give her time before
he spoke again. Horace was young, and weary of the suspense that
he had endured in the other room. He unwisely pressed her with
another question.
<P>
"Has Lady Janet said anything to you--"
<P>
She turned on him angrily before he could finish the sentence.
"You have tried to make her hurry me into marrying you," she
burst out. "I see it in your face!"
<P>
Plain as the warning was this time, Horace still failed to
interpret it in the right way. "Don't be angry!" he said,
good-humoredly. "Is it so very inexcusable to ask Lady Janet to
intercede for me? I have tried to persuade you in vain. My mother
and my sisters have pleaded for me, and you turn a deaf ear--"
<P>
She could endure it no longer. She stamped her foot on the door
with hysterical vehemence. "I am weary of hearing of your mother
and your sisters!" she broke in violently. "You talk of nothing
else."
<P>
It was just possible to make one more mistake in dealing with
her--and Horace made it. He took offense, on his side, and rose
from the sofa. His mother and sisters were high authorities in
his estimation; they variously represented his ideal of
perfection in women. He withdrew to the opposite extremity of the
room, and administered the severest reproof that he could think
of on the spur of the moment.
<P>
"It would be well, Grace, if you followed the example set you by
my mother and my sisters," he said. "_They_ are not in the habit
of speaking cruelly to those who love them."
<P>
To all appearance the rebuke failed to produce the slightest
effect. She seemed to be as indifferent to it as if it had not
reached her ears. There was a spirit in her--a miserable spirit,
born of her own bitter experience--which rose in revolt against
Horace's habitual glorification of the ladies of his family. "It
sickens me," she thought to herself, "to hear of the virtues of
women who have never been tempted! Where is the merit of living
reputably, when your life is one course of prosperity and
enjoyment? Has his mother known starvation? Have his sisters been
left forsaken in the street?" It hardened her heart--it almost
reconciled her to deceiving him--when he set his relatives up as
patterns for her. Would he never understand that women detested
having other women exhibited as examples to them? She looked
round at him with a sense of impatient wonder. He was sitting at
the luncheon-table, with his back turned on her, and his head
resting on his hand. If he had attempted to rejoin her, she would
have repelled him ; if he had spoken, she would have met him with
a sharp reply. He sat apart from her, without uttering a word. In
a man's hands silence is the most terrible of all protests to the
woman who loves him. Violence she can endure. Words she is always
ready to meet by words on her side. Silence conquers her. After a
moment's hesitation, Mercy left the sofa and advanced
submissively toward the table. She had offended him--and she
alone was in fault. How should he know it, poor fellow, when he
innocently mortified her? Step by step she drew closer and
closer. He never looked round; he never moved. She laid her hand
timidly on his shoulder. "Forgive me, Horace," she whispered in
his ear. "I am suffering this morning; I am not myself. I didn't
mean what I said. Pray forgive me." There was no resisting the
caressing tenderness of voice and manner which accompanied those
words. He looked up; he took her hand. She bent over him, and
touched his forehead with her lips. "Am I forgiven?" she asked.
<P>
"Oh, my darling," he said, "if you only knew how I loved you!"
<P>
"I do know it," she answered, gently, twining his hair round her
finger, and arranging it over his forehead where his hand had
ruffled it.
<P>
They were completely absorbed in each other, or they must, at
that moment, have heard the library door open at the other end of
the room.
<P>
Lady Janet had written the necessary reply to her nephew, and had
returned, faithful to her engagement, to plead the cause of
Horace. The first object that met her view was her client
pleading, with conspicuous success, for himself! "I am not
wanted, evidently," thought the old lady. She noiselessly closed
the door again and left the lovers by themselves.
<P>
Horace returned, with unwise persistency, to the question of the
deferred marriage. At the first words that he spoke she drew back
directly--sadly, not angrily.
<P>
"Don't press me to-day," she said; "I am not well to-day."
<P>
He rose and looked at her anxiously. "May l speak about it
to-morrow?"
<P>
"Yes, to-morrow." She returned to the sofa, and changed the
subject. "What a time Lady Janet is away!" she said. "What can be
keeping her so long?"
<P>
Horace did his best to appear interested in the question of Lady
Janet's prolonged absence. "What made her leave you?" he asked,
standing at the back of the sofa and leaning over her.
<P>
"She went into the library to write a note to her nephew.
By-the-by, who is her nephew?"
<P>
"Is it possible you don't know?"
<P>
"Indeed, I don't."
<P>
"You have heard of him, no doubt," said Horace. "Lady Janet's
nephew is a celebrated man." He paused, and stooping nearer to
her, lifted a love-lock that lay over her shoulder and pressed it
to his lips. "Lady Janet's nephew," he resumed, "is Julian Gray."
<P>
She started off her seat, and looked round at him in blank,
bewildered terror, as if she doubted the evidence of her own
senses.
<P>
Horace was completely taken by surprise. "My dear Grace!" he
exclaimed; "what have I said or done to startle you this time?"
<P>
She held up her hand for silence. "Lady Janet's nephew is Julian
Gray," she repeated; "and I only know it now!"
<P>
Horace's perplexity increased. "My darling, now you do know it,
what is there to alarm you?" he asked.
<P>
(There was enough to alarm the boldest woman living--in such a
position, and with such a temperament as hers. To her mind the
personation of Grace Roseberry had suddenly assumed a new aspect:
the aspect of a fatality. It had led her blindfold to the house
in which she and the preacher at the Refuge were to meet. He was
coming--the man who had reached her inmost heart, who had
influenced her whole life! Was the day of reckoning coming with
him?)
<P>
"Don't notice me," she said, faintly. "I have been ill all the
morning. You saw it yourself when you came in here; even the
sound of your voice alarmed me. I shall be better directly. I am
afraid I startled you?"
<P>
"My dear Grace, it almost looked as if you were terrified at the
sound of Julian's name! He is a public celebrity, I know; and I
have seen ladies start and stare at him when he entered a room.
But _you_ looked perfectly panic-stricken."
<P>
She rallied her courage by a desperate effort; she laughed--a
harsh, uneasy laugh--and stopped him by putting her hand over his
mouth. "Absurd!" she said, lightly. "As if Mr. Julian Gray had
anything to do with my looks! I am better already. See for
yourself!" She looked round at him again with a ghastly gayety;
and returned, with a desperate assumption of indifference, to the
subject of Lady Janet's nephew. "Of course I have heard of him,"
she said. "Do you know that he is expected here to-day? Don't
stand there behind me--it's so hard to talk to you. Come and sit
down."
<P>
He obeyed--but she had not quite satisfied him yet. His face had
not lost its expression of anxiety and surprise. She persisted in
playing her part, determined to set at rest in him any possible
suspicion that she had reasons of her own for being afraid of
Julian Gray. "Tell me about this famous man of yours," she said,
putting her arm familiarly through his arm. "What is he like?"
<P>
The caressing action and the easy tone had their effect on
Horace. His face began to clear; he answered her lightly on his
side.
<P>
"Prepare yourself to meet the most unclerical of clergymen," he
said. "Julian is a lost sheep among the parsons, and a thorn in
the side of his bishop. Preaches, if they ask him, in Dissenters'
chapels. Declines to set up any pretensions to priestly authority
and priestly power. Goes about doing good on a plan of his own.
Is quite resigned never to rise to the high places in his
profession. Says it's rising high enough for _him_ to be the
Archdeacon of the afflicted, the Dean of the hungry, and the
Bishop of the poor. With all his oddities, as good a fellow as
ever lived. Immensely popular with the women. They all go to him
for advice. I wish you would go, too."
<P>
Mercy changed color. "What do you mean?" she asked, sharply.
<P>
"Julian is famous for his powers of persuasion," said Horace,
smiling. "If _he_ spoke to you, Grace, he would prevail on you to
fix the day. Suppose I ask Julian to plead for me?"
<P>
He made the proposal in jest. Mercy's unquiet mind accepted it as
addressed to her in earnest. "He will do it," she thought, with a
sense of indescribable terror, "if I don't stop him!" There is
but one chance for her. The only certain way to prevent Horace
from appealing to his friend was to grant what Horace wished for
before his friend entered the house. She laid her hand on his
shoulder; she hid the terrible anxieties that were devouring her
under an assumption of coquetry painful and pitiable to see.
<P>
"Don't talk nonsense!" she said, gayly. "What were we saying just
now--before we began to speak of Mr. Julian Gray?"
<P>
"We were wondering what had become of Lady Janet," Horace
replied.
<P>
She tapped him impatiently on the shoulder. "No! no! It was
something you said before that."
<P>
Her eyes completed what her words had left unsaid. Horace's arm
stole round her waist.
<P>
"I was saying that I loved you," he answered, in a whisper.
<P>
"Only that?"
<P>
"Are you tired of hearing it?"
<P>
She smiled charmingly . "Are you so very much in earnest
about--about--" She stopped, and looked away from him.
<P>
"About our marriage?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"It is the one dearest wish of my life."
<P>
"Really?"
<P>
"Really."
<P>
There was a pause. Mercy's fingers toyed nervously with the
trinkets at her watch-chain. "When would you like it to be?" she
said, very softly, with her whole attention fixed on the
watch-chain.
<P>
She had never spoken, she had never looked, as she spoke and
looked now. Horace was afraid to believe in his own good fortune.
"Oh, Grace!" he exclaimed, "you are not trifling with me?"
<P>
"What makes you think I am trifling with you?"
<P>
Horace was innocent enough to answer her seriously. "You would
not even let me speak of our marriage just now, "he said.
<P>
"Never mind what I did just now," she retorted, petulantly. "They
say women are changeable. It is one of the defects of the sex."
<P>
"Heaven be praised for the defects of the sex!" cried Horace,
with devout sincerity. "Do you really leave me to decide?"
<P>
"If you insist on it."
<P>
Horace considered for a moment--the subject being the law of
marriage. "We may be married by license in a fortnight," he said.
"I fix this day fortnight."
<P>
She held up her hands in protest.
<P>
"Why not? My lawyer is ready. There are no preparations to make.
You said when you accepted me that it was to be a private
marriage."
<P>
Mercy was obliged to own that she had certainly said that.
<P>
"We might be married at once--if the law would only let us. This
day fortnight! Say--Yes!" He drew her closer to him. There was a
pause. The mask of coquetry--badly worn from the first--dropped
from her. Her sad gray eyes rested compassionately on his eager
face. "Don't look so serious!" he said. "Only one little word,
Grace! Only Yes."
<P>
She sighed, and said it. He kissed her passionately. It was only
by a resolute effort that she released herself.
<P>
"Leave me!" she said, faintly. "Pray leave me by myself!"
<P>
She was in earnest--strangely in earnest. She was trembling from
head to foot. Horace rose to leave her. "I will find Lady Janet,"
he said; "I long to show the dear old lady that I have recovered
my spirits, and to tell her why." He turned round at the library
door. "You won't go away? You will let me see you again when you
are more composed?"
<P>
"I will wait here," said Mercy.
<P>
Satisfied with that reply, he left the room.
<P>
Her hands dropped on her lap; her head sank back wearily on the
cushions at the head of the sofa. There was a dazed sensation in
her: her mind felt stunned. She wondered vacantly whether she was
awake or dreaming. Had she really said the word which pledged her
to marry Horace Holmcroft in a fortnight? A fortnight! Something
might happen in that time to prevent it: she might find her way
in a fortnight out of the terrible position in which she stood.
Anyway, come what might of it, she had chosen the preferable
alternative to a private interview with Julian Gray. She raised
herself from her recumbent position with a start, as the idea of
the interview--dismissed for the last few minutes--possessed
itself again of her mind. Her excited imagination figured Julian
Gray as present in the room at that moment, speaking to her as
Horace had proposed. She saw him seated close at her side--this
man who had shaken her to the soul when he was in the pulpit, and
when she was listening to him (unseen) at the other end of the
chapel--she saw him close by her, looking her searchingly in the
face; seeing her shameful secret in her eyes; hearing it in her
voice; feeling it in her trembling hands; forcing it out of her
word by word, till she fell prostrate at his feet with the
confession of the fraud. Her head dropped again on the cushions;
she hid her face in horror of the scene which her excited fancy
had conjured up. Even now, when she had made that dreaded
interview needless, could she feel sure (meeting him only on the
most distant terms) of not betraying herself? She could _not_
feel sure. Something in her shuddered and shrank at the bare idea
of finding herself in the same room with him. She felt it, she
knew it: her guilty conscience owned and feared its master in
Julian Gray!
<P>
The minutes passed. The violence of her agitation began to tell
physically on her weakened frame.
<P>
She found herself crying silently without knowing why. A weight
was on her head, a weariness was in all her limbs. She sank lower
on the cushions--her eyes closed--the monotonous ticking of the
clock on the mantelpiece grew drowsily fainter and fainter on her
ear. Little by little she dropped into slumber--slumber so light
that she started when a morsel of coal fell into the grate, or
when the birds chirped and twittered in their aviary in the
winter-garden.
<P>
Lady Janet and Horace came in. She was faintly conscious of
persons in the room. After an interval she opened her eyes, and
half rose to speak to them. The room was empty again. They had
stolen out softly and left her to repose. Her eyes closed once
more. She dropped back into slumber, and from slumber, in the
favoring warmth and quiet of the place, into deep and dreamless
sleep.
