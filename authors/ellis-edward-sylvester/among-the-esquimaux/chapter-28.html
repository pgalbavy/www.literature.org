<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>A fearful task confronted the little party. Thirty miles of snow,
several feet deep, lay between them and their only haven of refuge,
and they were without sled or snow-shoe. If they succeeded in
their prodigious task, it must be done by sheer strength and the
power of continued desperation.</p>

<p>But, with compressed lips and the resolution to do or die, they
bent to the work without faltering.</p>

<p>The Esquimau naturally took the lead to break the way so far
as he could; Jack Cosgrove came next, then Rob Carrol, while Fred
Warburton brought up the rear.</p>

<p>The first move that the native made proved he was a veteran.
He plunged in, following the decline down to the plateau, which
was the scene of their adventures two days before. He walked like
one who had only an ordinary tramp before him. In truth, he could
have gone faster and done better, but he accommodated himself
to his friends, to whom the labor was new and trying to a degree.</p>

<p>None spoke for a long time. It requires strength to do even so
slight a thing as that, and no one had an ounce to spare. The
question that was uppermost in the minds of the three was whether
they would be able to hold out to the end.</p>

<p>"I don't see why we can't," reflected Fred, who, being at the
rear, had an easier task than any of the others; "it would be
well enough if we had snow-shoes, but neither Jack nor Rob nor
I can use them, and we would flounder around a good deal worse
than we are doing now and likely enough wouldn't get ahead at
all."</p>

<p>The meditations of Rob Carrol were of a similar strain.</p>

<p>"I've seen better fun than this, but it beats staying in the
cavern and freezing to death on wolf steak. I believe I'm strong
enough to see the business through; I hope Fred won't give out,
for he isn't as strong as Jack and I. I believe Docak enjoys it.
Gracious! if I ever live to get out of this outlandish country,
I'll never set foot in it again. I haven't lost any North Pole,
and those that think they have can do their own hunting for it."</p>

<p>The sun still remained obscured, and the wonder of the three
was how their guide kept his bearings, after debouching from the
highlands and entering upon the broad, undulating plain which
stretched away to Davis Strait and Baffin's Bay. There was no
misgiving, however, in that respect. Docak could not go astray,
or, at least, if there was any likelihood of his doing so, not
one of his friends was able to help him.</p>

<p>As the boys had anticipated, the labor of walking in this difficult
fashion soon generated a warmth in their bodies that was a vast
comfort, after sitting benumbed and shivering so long in the cavern.
Despite the extreme cold they felt no discomfort, for the air
was quite dry, and less trying, therefore, than a damp atmosphere
would have been, even though twenty-five degrees higher.</p>

<p>But it is in such an Arctic climate that one can have his limbs
or a portion of his body hopelessly frozen without suspecting
it. All were so effectually protected that only a small portion
of their faces, their eyes, and tips of their noses were exposed.</p>

<p>The bear-skin, which has been referred to as belonging to Docak,
was carried by him after his usual manner. He would have offered
it to his friends in turn, had he not known that it would soon
have become a burden which he could carry better than they.</p>

<p>Jack, who trod close on the heels of the Esquimau, was admiring
the sturdy manner in which he plowed through the snow, his labor
being much greater than any one of those who followed him, when
the native turned his head and scanned his face with curious intensity.
Pausing for the moment in his labor, he leaned to one side, and
did the same to the others. His act was all the more singular
since he did not speak. The lads smiled under their head-coverings,
but their faces were so wrapped up that the relaxation of the
features could not be perceived.</p>

<p>"I wonder why he did that," thought all three.</p>

<p>"The chap has been acting curious ever since this trouble began,"
continued the sailor, "and I wouldn't be s'prised if he's just
a little off."</p>

<p>"Can it be," asked Rob, following up a whimsical idea, "that
he fears we aren't ourselves? He has started out to take us to
the seacoast, and doesn't mean that anybody else shall rope himself
in on him. I guess he's satisfied, though we're so covered up
that our nearest friends wouldn't know us."</p>

<p>For fully an hour the party toiled on, and all, with the exception
of the leader, began to feel the effects of the severe exertion.
Still, no one protested or asked for rest; each determined to
keep it up, if possible, until the leader chose to halt.</p>

<p>But Docak did not forget them. At the end of the time named he
turned about, and, with something of his old pleasantry, said:</p>

<p>"Much tired&mdash;wait while&mdash;den go on."</p>

<p>Each of the boys longed to ask him what he thought of the prospect
of getting through, but forebore, recalling his moodiness, which
might be still upon him despite his present manner.</p>

<p>"I think we're doing quite well, Docak," said Jack; "it's a little
hard, but we can take a breathing spell now and then, and keep
at it till we strike your home."</p>

<p>Had the Esquimau made any response to this half-inquiring remark
the sailor would have followed it up, but he did not. On the contrary,
he was busy studying the sky and the surrounding landscape, doubtless
with a view of determining what weather changes impended.</p>

<p>The others did the same, but though Jack had learned a good deal
of the science at sea he was now at a loss. The dull, leaden sky,
so obscured that it was impossible to tell in what part of the
heavens the sun was, told him nothing beyond the fact that more
snow was likely to fall before many hours.</p>

<p>As the best thing that could be done, the friends studied the
actions of the Esquimau.</p>

<p>The result of his survey was not satisfactory&mdash;that was clear.
He shook his head and muttered something in his own language,
which had anything but a pleasant effect on the others.</p>

<p>The scene was one of utter loneliness and desolation. North,
east, south, and west stretched the snowy plain, unrelieved by
tree, house, or sign of a living creature. Far up in the sky sounded
the honk of some wild fowl, and, looking aloft, a line of black
specks could be seen, sailing swiftly southward through space,
as if to escape the Arctic cold that would soon smother everything
in its icy embrace.</p>

<p>The rest was barely ten minutes, when Docak, looking at his companions,
asked:</p>

<p>"Be rested? We go on?"</p>

<p>"Yes; we're ready," replied Jack.</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;work hard now&mdash;don't get tired."</p>

<p>"I won't, if I can help it; but the only way I know of is to
stand still, which don't pay in this kind of business."</p>

<p>The Esquimau bent to his work, as if striving for a wager. He
had a way not only of stepping down in the soft snow, but of shoving
it partly aside from his path. It would have been the severest
kind of labor for anyone else, and it is hard to understand how
he managed it so well. It was a great help to the one immediately
behind him. Jack would have been glad to lighten the task for
the boys, but that was out of his power, and he wasted no strength
in the attempt.</p>

<p>The party was becoming accustomed to the work. That the guide
was aware of this was proven when he kept at it fully twice as
long as before. They were going slowly&mdash;very slowly&mdash;but there
was comfort in the consciousness that every step taken was toward
safety, and the task before them was lessened, even to that small
extent.</p>

<p>At the moment the boys were beginning to think it about time
another halt was called, Docak stopped in his former abrupt way,
and, leaning to one side, peered into each face in turn.</p>

<p>Something in Fred's appearance caught his attention, and, with
an exclamation, he sprang out of the path, and hurried back to
where the lad stood, wondering what was the matter with the fellow.</p>
