<p>Owen left, Villiers stayed on a few days to escort Kate to the
lake.  If she liked it there, and could find a house, she could
stay by herself.  She knew sufficient people in Mexico and in
Guadalajara to prevent her from being lonely.  But she still shrank
from travelling alone in this country.</p>

<p>She wanted to leave the city.  The new President had come in
quietly enough, but there was an ugly feeling of uppishness in the
lower classes, the bottom dog clambering mangily to the top.  Kate
was no snob.  Man or woman, she cared nothing about the social
class.  But meanness, sordidness she hated.  She hated bottom dogs.
They all were mangy, they all were full of envy and malice, many
had the rabies.  Ah no, let us defend ourselves from the bottom
dog, with its mean growl and its yellow teeth.</p>

<p>She had tea with Cipriano before leaving.</p>

<p>'How do you get along with the Government?' she asked.</p>

<p>'I stand for the law and the constitution,' he said.  'They know I
don't want anything to do with cuartelazos or revolutions.  Don
Ram&oacute;n is my chief.'</p>

<p>'In what way?'</p>

<p>'Later, you will see.'</p>

<p>He had a secret, important to himself, on which he was sitting
tight.  But he looked at her with shining eyes, as much as to say
that soon she would share the secret, and then he would be much
happier.</p>

<p>He watched her curiously, from under his wary black lashes.  She
was one of the rather plump Irishwomen, with soft brown hair
and hazel eyes, and a beautiful, rather distant repose.  Her
great charm was her soft repose, and her gentle, unconscious
inaccessibility.  She was taller and bigger than Cipriano: he was
almost boyishly small.  But he was all energy, and his eyebrows
tilted black and with a barbarian conceit, above his full, almost
insolent black eyes.</p>

<p>He watched her continually, with a kind of fascination: the same
spell that the absurd little figures of the doll Madonna had cast
over him as a boy.  She was the mystery, and he the adorer, under
the semi-ecstatic spell of the mystery.  But once he rose from his
knees, he rose in the same strutting conceit of himself as before
he knelt: with all his adoration in his pocket again.  But he had a
good deal of magnetic power.  His education had not diminished it.
His education lay like a film of white oil on the black lake of his
barbarian consciousness.  For this reason, the things he said were
hardly interesting at all.  Only what he WAS.  He made the air
around him seem darker, but richer and fuller.  Sometimes his
presence was extraordinarily grateful, like a healing of the blood.
And sometimes he was an intolerable weight on her.  She gasped to
get away from him.</p>

<p>'You think a great deal of Don Ram&oacute;n?' she said to him.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, his black eyes watching her.  'He is a very fine
man.'</p>

<p>How trivial the words sounded!  That was another boring thing about
him: his English seemed so trivial.  He wasn't really expressing
himself.  He was only flipping at the white oil that lay on his
surface.</p>

<p>'You like him better than the Bishop, your god-father?'</p>

<p>He lifted his shoulders in a twisted, embarrassed shrug.</p>

<p>'The same!' he said.  'I like him the same.'</p>

<p>Then he looked away into the distance, with a certain hauteur and
insolence.</p>

<p>'Very different, no?' he said.  'But in some ways, the same.  He
knows better what is Mexico.  He knows better what I am.  Bishop
Severn did not know the real Mexico: how could he, he was a sincere
Catholic!  But Don Ram&oacute;n knows the real Mexico, no?'</p>

<p>'And what is the real Mexico?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Well - you must ask Don Ram&oacute;n.  I can't explain.'</p>

<p>She asked Cipriano about going to the lake.</p>

<p>'Yes!' he said.  'You can go!  You will like it.  Go first to
Orilla, no? - you take a ticket on the railway to Ixtlahuacan.  And
in Orilla is an hotel with a German manager.  Then from Orilla you
can go in a motor-boat, in a few hours, to Sayula.  And there you
will find a house to live in.'</p>

<p>He wanted her to do this, she could tell.</p>

<p>'How far is Don Ram&oacute;n's hacienda from Sayula?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Near!  About an hour in a boat.  He is there now.  And at the
beginning of the month I am going with my division to Guadalajara:
now there is a new Governor.  So I shall be quite near too.'</p>

<p>'That will be nice,' she said.</p>

<p>'You think so?' he asked quickly.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said, on her guard, looking at him slowly.  'I should be
sorry to lose touch with Don Ram&oacute;n and you.'</p>

<p>He had a little tension on his brow, haughty, unwilling, conceited,
and at the same time, yearning and desirous.</p>

<p>'You like Don Ram&oacute;n very much?' he said.  'You want to know him
more?'</p>

<p>There was a peculiar anxiety in his voice.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said.  'One knows so few people in the world nowadays,
that one can respect - and fear a little.  I am a little afraid of
Don Ram&oacute;n: and I have the GREATEST respect for him - '  She ended on
a hot note of sincerity.</p>

<p>'It is good!' he said.  'It is very good.  You may respect him more
than any other man in the world.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps that is true,' she said, turning her eyes slowly to his.</p>

<p>'Yes!  Yes!' he cried impatiently.  'It is true.  You will find out
later.  And Ram&oacute;n likes you.  He told me to ask you to come to the
lake.  When you come to Sayula, when you are coming, write to him,
and no doubt he can tell you about a house, and all those things.'</p>

<p>'Shall I?' she said, hesitant.</p>

<p>'Yes.  Yes! of course, we say what we mean.'</p>

<p>Curious little man, with his odd, inflammable hauteur and conceit,
something burning inside him, that gave him no peace.  He had an
almost childish faith in the other man.  And yet she was not sure
that he did not, in some corner of his soul, resent Ram&oacute;n somewhat.</p>

<p>Kate set off by the night train for the west, with Villiers.  The
one Pullman coach was full: people going to Guadalajara and Colima
and the coast.  There were three military officers, rather shy in
their new uniforms, and rather swaggering at the same time, making
eyes at the empty air, as if they felt they were conspicuous, and
sitting quickly in their seats, as if to obliterate themselves.
There were two country farmers or ranchers, in tight trousers and
cartwheel hats stitched with silver.  One was a tall man with a big
moustache, the other was a smaller, grey man.  But they both had
the handsome, alive legs of the Mexicans, and the rather quenched
faces.  There was a widow buried in crape, accompanied by a criada,
a maid.  The rest were townsmen, Mexicans on business, at once shy
and fussy, unobtrusive and self-important.</p>

<p>The Pullman was clean and neat, with its hot green-plush seats.
But, full of people, it seemed empty compared with a Pullman in the
United States.  Everybody was very quiet, very soft and guarded.
The farmers folded their beautiful serapes and laid them carefully
on the seats, sitting as if their section were a lonely little
place.  The officers folded their cloaks and arranged dozens of
little parcels, little cardboard hatboxes and heterogeneous
bundles, under the seats and on the seats.  The business men had
the oddest luggage, canvas hold-alls embroidered in wool, with
long, touching mottoes.</p>

<p>And in all the crowd a sense of guardedness and softness and self-
effacement: a curious soft sensibilit&eacute;, touched with fear.  It was
already a somewhat conspicuous thing to travel in the Pullman; you
had to be on your guard.</p>

<p>The evening for once was grey: the rainy season really approaching.
A sudden wind whirled dust and a few spots of rain.  The train drew
out of the formless, dry, dust-smitten areas fringing the city, and
wound mildly on for a few minutes, only to stop in the main street
of Tacubaya, the suburb-village.  In the grey approach of evening
the train halted heavily in the street, and Kate looked out at the
men who stood in groups, with their hats tilted against the wind
and their blankets folded over their shoulders and up to their
eyes, against the dust, motionless, standing like sombre ghosts,
only a glint of eyes showing between the dark serape and the big
hat-brim; while donkey-drivers in a dust-cloud ran frantically,
with uplifted arms like demons, uttering short, sharp cries to
prevent their donkeys from poking in between the coaches of the
train.  Silent dogs trotted in-and-out under the train, women,
their faces wrapped in their blue rebozos, came to offer tortillas
folded in a cloth to keep them warm, or pulque in an earthenware
mug, or pieces of chicken smothered in red, thick, oily sauce; or
oranges or bananas or pitahayas, anything.  And when few people
bought, because of the dust, the women put their wares under their
arm, under the blue rebozo, and covered their faces and motionless
watched the train.</p>

<p>It was about six o'clock.  The earth was utterly dry and stale.
Somebody was kindling charcoal in front of a house.  Men were
hurrying down the wind, balancing their great hats curiously.
Horsemen on quick, fine little horses, guns slung behind, trotted
up to the train, lingered, then trotted quickly away again into
nowhere.</p>

<p>Still the train stood in the street.  Kate and Villiers got down.
They watched the sparks blowing from the charcoal which a little
girl was kindling in the street, to cook tortillas.</p>

<p>The train had a second-class coach and a first-class.  The second
class was jam-full of peasants, Indians, piled in like chickens
with their bundles and baskets and bottles, endless things.  One
woman had a fine peacock under her arm.  She put it down and in
vain tried to suppress it beneath her voluminous skirts.  It
refused to be suppressed.  She took it up and balanced it on her
knee and looked round again over the medley of jars, baskets,
pumpkins, melons, guns, bundles, and human beings.</p>

<p>In the front was a steel car with a guard of little scrubby
soldiers in their dirty cotton uniforms.  Some soldiers were
mounted on top of the train with their guns: the look-out.</p>

<p>And the whole train, seething with life, was curiously still,
subdued.  Perhaps it is the perpetual sense of danger which makes
the people so hushed, without clamour or stridency.  And with an
odd, hushed politeness among them.  A sort of demon-world.</p>

<p>At last the train moved on.  If it had waited forever, no one would
have been deeply surprised.  For what might not be ahead?  Rebels,
bandits, bridges blown up - anything.</p>

<p>However, quietly, stealthily, the train moved out and along the
great weary valley.  The circling mountains, so relentless, were
invisible save near at hand.  In a few broken adobe huts a bit of
fire sparked red.  The adobe was grey-black, of the lava dust,
depressing.  Into the distance the fields spread dry, with here and
there patches of green irrigation.  There was a broken hacienda
with columns that supported nothing.  Darkness was coming, dust
still blew in the shadow; the valley seemed encompassed in a dry,
stale, weary gloom.</p>

<p>Then there came a heavy shower.  The train was passing a pulque
hacienda.  The rows of the giant maguey stretched bristling their
iron-black barbs in the gloom.</p>

<p>All at once, the lights came on, the Pullman attendant came swiftly
lowering the blinds, so that the brilliance of the windows should
attract no bullets from the dark outside.</p>

<p>There was a poor little meal at exorbitant prices, and when this
was cleared away, the attendant came with a clash to make the beds,
pulling down the upper berths.  It was only eight o'clock, and the
passengers looked up in resentment.  But no good.  The pug-faced
Mexican in charge, and his smallpox-pitted assistant, insolently
came in between the seats, inserted the key overhead, and brought
down the berth with a crash.  And the Mexican passengers humbly
crawled away to the smoking-room or the toilet, like whipped dogs.</p>

<p>At half-past eight everybody was silently and with intense
discretion going to bed.  None of the collar-stud-snapping bustle
and 'homely' familiarity of the United States.  Like subdued
animals they all crept in behind their green serge curtains.</p>

<p>Kate hated a Pullman, the discreet indiscretion, the horrible
nearness of other people, like so many larvae in so many sections,
behind the green serge curtains.  Above all, the horrible intimacy
of the noise of going to bed.  She hated to undress, struggling in
the oven of her berth, with her elbow butting into the stomach of
the attendant who was buttoning up the green curtain outside.</p>

<p>And yet, once she was in bed and could put out her light and raise
the window-blind, she had to admit it was better than a wagon-lit
in Europe: and perhaps the best that can be done for people who
must travel through the night in trains.</p>

<p>There was a rather cold wind, after the rain, up there on that high
plateau.  The moon had risen, the sky was clear.  Rocks, and tall
organ cactus, and more miles of maguey.  Then the train stopped at
a dark little station on the rim of the slope, where men swathed in
dark serapes held dusky, ruddy lanterns that lit up no faces at
all, only dark gaps.  Why did the train stay so long?  Was
something wrong?</p>

<p>At last they were going again.  Under the moon she saw beyond her a
long downslope of rocks and cactus, and in the distance below, the
lights of a town.  She lay in her berth watching the train wind
slowly down the wild, rugged slope.  Then she dozed.</p>

<p>To wake at a station that looked like a quiet inferno, with dark
faces coming near the windows, glittering eyes in the half-light,
women in their rebozos running along the train balancing dishes of
meat, tamales, tortillas on one hand, black-faced men with fruit
and sweets, and all calling in a subdued, intense, hushed hubbub.
Strange and glaring, she saw eyes at the dark screen of the
Pullman, sudden hands thrusting up something to sell.  In fear,
Kate dropped her window.  The wire screen was not enough.</p>

<p>The platform below the Pullman was all dark.  But at the back of
the train she could see the glare of the first-class windows, on
the dark station.  And a man selling sweet-meats - Cajetas!
Cajetas!  La de Celaya!</p>

<p>She was safe inside the Pullman, with nothing to do but to listen
to an occasional cough behind the green curtains, and to feel the
faint bristling apprehension of all the Mexicans in their dark
berths.  The dark Pullman was full of a subdued apprehension, fear
lest there might be some attack on the train.</p>

<p>She went to sleep and woke at a bright station: probably Queretaro.
The green trees looked theatrical in the electric light.  Opales!
she heard the men calling softly.  If Owen had been there he would
have got up in his pyjamas to buy opals.  The call would have been
too strong.</p>

<p>She slept fitfully, in the shaken saloon, vaguely aware of stations
and the deep night of the open country.  Then she started from a
complete sleep.  The train was dead still, no sound.  Then a
tremendous jerking as the Pullman was shunted.  It must be
Irapuato, where they branched to the west.</p>

<p>She would arrive at Ixtlahuacan soon after six in the morning.  The
man woke her at daybreak, before the sun had risen.  Dry country
with mesquite bushes, in the dawn: then green wheat alternating
with ripe wheat.  And men already in the pale, ripened wheat
reaping with sickles, cutting short little handfuls from the short
straw.  A bright sky, with a bluish shadow on earth.  Parched
slopes with ragged maize stubble.  Then a forlorn hacienda and a
man on horseback, in a blanket, driving a silent flock of cows,
sheep, bulls, goats, lambs, rippling a bit ghostly in the dawn,
from under a tottering archway.  A long canal beside the railway, a
long canal paved with bright green leaves from which poked the
mauve heads of the lirio, the water hyacinth.  The sun was lifting
up, red.  In a moment it was the full, dazzling gold of a Mexican
morning.</p>

<p>Kate was dressed and ready, sitting facing Villiers, when they came
to Ixtlahuacan.  The man carried out her bags.  The train drifted
in to a desert of a station.  They got down.  It was a new day.</p>

<p>In the powerful light of morning, under a turquoise-blue sky, she
gazed at the helpless-looking station, railway lines, some standing
trucks, and a remote lifelessness.  A boy seized their bags and ran
across the lines to the station yard, which was paved with
cobblestones, but overgrown with weeds.  At one side stood an old
tram-car with two mules, like a relic.  One or two men, swathed up
to the eyes in scarlet blankets, were crossing on silent white
legs.</p>

<p>'Adonde?' said the boy.</p>

<p>But Kate went to see her big luggage taken out.  It was all there.</p>

<p>'Orilla Hotel,' said Kate.</p>

<p>The boy said they must go in the tram-car, so in the tram-car they
went.  The driver whipped his mules, they rolled in the still,
heavy morning light away down an uneven cobbled road with holes in
it, between walls with falling mortar and low, black adobe houses,
in the peculiar VACUOUS depression of a helpless little Mexican
town, towards the plaza.  The strange emptiness, everything empty
of life!</p>

<p>Occasional men on horseback clattered suddenly by, occasional big
men in scarlet serapes went noiselessly on their own way, under the
big hats.  A boy on a high mule was delivering milk from red globe-
shaped jars slung on either side his mount.  The street was stony,
uneven, vacuous, sterile.  The stones seemed dead, the town seemed
made of dead stone.  The human life came with a slow, sterile
unwillingness, in spite of the low-hung power of the sun.</p>

<p>At length they were in the plaza, where brilliant trees flowered in
a blaze of pure scarlet, and some in pure lavender, around the
basins of milk-looking water.  Milky-dim the water bubbled up in
the basins, and women, bleary with sleep, uncombed, came from under
the dilapidated arches of the portales, and across the broken
pavement, to fill their water-jars.</p>

<p>The tram stopped and they got down.  The boy got down with the
bags, and told them they must go to the river to take a boat.</p>

<p>They followed obediently down the smashed pavements, where every
moment you might twist your ankle or break your leg.  Everywhere
the same weary indifference and brokenness, a sense of dirt and of
helplessness, squalor of far-gone indifference, under the perfect
morning sky, in the pure sunshine and the pure Mexican air.  The
sense of life ebbing away, leaving dry ruin.</p>

<p>They came to the edge of the town, to a dusty, humped bridge, a
broken wall, a pale-brown stream flowing full.  Below the bridge a
cluster of men.</p>

<p>Each one wanted her to hire his boat.  She demanded a motor-boat:
the boat from the hotel.  They said there wasn't one.  She didn't
believe it.  Then a dark-faced fellow with his black hair down his
forehead, and a certain intensity in his eyes, said:  Yes, yes; the
hotel had a boat, but it was broken.  She must take a row-boat.  In
an hour and a half he would row her there.</p>

<p>'How long?' said Kate.</p>

<p>'An hour and a half.'</p>

<p>'And I am so hungry!' cried Kate.  'How much do you charge?'</p>

<p>'Two pesos.'  He held up two fingers.</p>

<p>Kate said yes, and he ran down to his boat.  Then she noticed he
was a cripple with inturned feet.  But how quick and strong!</p>

<p>She climbed with Villiers down the broken bank to the river, and in
a moment they were in the boat.  Pale green willow-trees fringed
from the earthen banks to the fuller-flowing, pale-brown water.
The river was not very wide, between deep banks.  They slipped
under the bridge, and past a funny high barge with rows of seats.
The boatman said it went up the river to Jocotlan: and he waved his
hand to show the direction.  They were slipping down-stream,
between lonely banks of willow-trees.</p>

<p>The crippled boatman was pulling hard, with great strength and
energy.  When she spoke to him in her bad Spanish and he found it
hard to understand, he knitted his brow a little, anxiously.  And
when she laughed he smiled at her with such a beautiful gentleness,
sensitive, wistful, quick.  She felt he was naturally honest and
truthful, and generous.  There was a beauty in these men, a wistful
beauty and a great physical strength.  Why had she felt so bitterly
about the country?</p>

<p>Morning was still young on the pale buff river, between the silent
earthen banks.  There was a blue dimness in the lower air, and
black water-fowl ran swiftly, unconcernedly back and forth from the
river's edge, on the dry, baked banks that were treeless now, and
wider.  They had entered a wide river, from the narrow one.  The
blueness and moistness of the dissolved night seemed to linger
under the scattered pepper-trees of the far shore.</p>

<p>The boatman rowed short and hard upon the flimsy, soft, sperm-like
water, only pausing at moments swiftly to smear the sweat from his
face with an old rag he kept on the bench beside him.  The sweat
ran from his bronze-brown skin like water, and the black hair on
his high-domed, Indian head smoked with wetness.</p>

<p>'There is no hurry,' said Kate, smiling to him.</p>

<p>'What does the Se&ntilde;orita say?'</p>

<p>'There is no hurry,' she repeated.</p>

<p>He paused, smiling, breathing deeply, and explained that now he was
rowing against stream.  This wider river flowed out of the lake,
full and heavy.  See! even as he rested a moment, the boat began to
turn and drift!  He quickly took his oars.</p>

<p>The boat moved slowly, in the hush of departed night, upon the
soft, full-flowing buff water, that carried little tufts of
floating water-hyacinth.  Some willow-trees stood near the edge,
and some pepper-trees of most delicate green foliage.  Beyond the
trees and the level of the shores, big hills rose up to high, blunt
points, baked incredibly dry, like biscuit.  The blue sky settled
against them nakedly; they were leafless and lifeless save for the
iron-green shafts of the organ cactus, that glistened blackly, yet
atmospherically, in the ochreous aridity.  This was Mexico again,
stark-dry and luminous with powerful light, cruel and unreal.</p>

<p>On a flat near the river a peon, perched on the rump of his ass,
was slowly driving five luxurious cows towards the water to drink.
The big black-and-white animals stepped in a dream-pace past the
pepper-trees to the bank, like moving pieces of light-and-shade:
the dun cows trailed after, in the incredible silence and
brilliance of the morning.</p>

<p>Earth, air, water were all silent with new light, the last blue of
night dissolving like a breath.  No sound, even no life.  The great
light was stronger than life itself.  Only, up in the blue, some
turkey-buzzards were wheeling with dirty-edged wings, as everywhere
in Mexico.</p>

<p>'Don't hurry!' Kate said again to the boatman, who was again
mopping his face, while his black hair ran sweat.  'We can go
slowly.'</p>

<p>The man smiled deprecatingly.</p>

<p>'If the Se&ntilde;orita will sit in the back,' he said.</p>

<p>Kate did not understand his request at first.  He had rowed in
towards a bend in the right bank, to be out of the current.  On the
left bank Kate had noticed some men bathing: men whose wet skins
flashed with the beautiful brown-rose colour and glitter of the
naked natives, and one stout man with the curious creamy-biscuit
skin of the city Mexicans.  Low against the water across-stream she
watched the glitter of naked men, half-immersed in the river.</p>

<p>She rose to step back into the stern of the boat, where Villiers
was.  As she did so, she saw a dark head and the flashing ruddy
shoulders of a man swimming towards the boat.  She wavered - and as
she was sitting down, the man stood up in the water and was wading
near, the water washing at the loose little cloth he had round his
loins.  He was smooth and wet and of a lovely colour, with the rich
smooth-muscled physique of the Indians.  He was coming towards the
boat, pushing back his hair from his forehead.</p>

<p>The boatman watched him, transfixed, without surprise, a little
subtle half-smile, perhaps of mockery, round his nose.  As if he
had expected it!</p>

<p>'Where are you going?' asked the man in the water, the brown river
running softly at his strong thighs.</p>

<p>The boatman waited a moment for his patrons to answer, then, seeing
they were silent, replied in a low, unwilling tone:</p>

<p>'Orilla.'</p>

<p>The man in the water took hold of the stern of the boat, as the
boatman softly touched the water with the oars to keep her
straight, and he threw back his longish black hair with a certain
effrontery.</p>

<p>'Do you know whom the lake belongs to?' he asked, with the same
effrontery.</p>

<p>'What do you say?' asked Kate, haughtily.</p>

<p>'If you know whom the lake belongs to?' the young man in the water
repeated.</p>

<p>'To whom?' said Kate, flustered.</p>

<p>'To the old gods of Mexico,' the stranger said.  'You have to make
a tribute to Quetzalcoatl if you go on the lake.'</p>

<p>The strange calm effrontery of it!  But truly Mexican.</p>

<p>'How?' said Kate.</p>

<p>'You can give me something,' he said.</p>

<p>'But why should I give something to you, if it is a tribute to
Quetzalcoatl?' she stammered.</p>

<p>'I am Quetzalcoatl's man, I,' he replied, with calm effrontery.</p>

<p>'And if I don't give you anything?' she said.</p>

<p>He lifted his shoulders and spread his free hand, staggering a
little, losing his footing in the water as he did so.</p>

<p>'If you wish to make an enemy of the lake - ' he said, coolly, as he
recovered his balance.</p>

<p>And then for the first time he looked straight at her.  And as he
did so, the demonish effrontery died down again, and the peculiar
American tension slackened and left him.</p>

<p>He gave a slight wave of dismissal with his free hand, and pushed
the boat gently forward.</p>

<p>'But it doesn't matter,' he said, with a slight insolent jerk of
his head sideways, and a faint, insolent smile.  'We will wait till
the Morning Star rises.'</p>

<p>The boatman softly but powerfully pulled the oars.  The man in the
water stood with the sun on his powerful chest, looking after the
boat in half-seeing abstraction.  His eyes had taken again the
peculiar gleaming far-awayness, suspended between the realities,
which, Kate suddenly realized, was the central look in the native
eyes.  The boatman, rowing away, was glancing back at the man who
stood in the water, and his face, too, had the abstracted,
transfigured look of a man perfectly suspended between the world's
two strenuous wings of energy.  A look of extraordinary, arresting
beauty, the silent, vulnerable centre of all life's quivering, like
the nucleus gleaming in tranquil suspense, within a cell.</p>

<p>'What does he mean,' said Kate, 'by &quot;We will wait till the Morning
Star rises&quot;?'</p>

<p>The man smiled slowly.</p>

<p>'It is a name,' he said.</p>

<p>And he seemed to know no more.  But the symbolism had evidently the
power to soothe and sustain him.</p>

<p>'Why did he come and speak to us?' asked Kate.</p>

<p>'He is one of those of the god Quetzalcoatl, Se&ntilde;orita.'</p>

<p>'And you? are you one too?'</p>

<p>'Who knows!' said the man, putting his head on one side.  Then he
added:  'I think so.  We are many.'</p>

<p>He watched Kate's face with that gleaming, intense semi-
abstraction, a gleam that hung unwavering in his black eyes, and
which suddenly reminded Kate of the morning star, or the evening
star, hanging perfect between night and the sun.</p>

<p>'You have the morning star in your eyes,' she said to the man.</p>

<p>He flashed her a smile of extraordinary beauty.</p>

<p>'The Se&ntilde;orita understands,' he said.</p>

<p>His face changed again to a dark-brown mask, like semi-transparent
stone, and he rowed with all his might.  Ahead, the river was
widening, the banks were growing lower, down to the water's level,
like shoals planted with willow-trees and with reeds.  Above the
willow-trees a square white sail was standing, as if erected on the
land.</p>

<p>'Is the lake so near?' said Kate.</p>

<p>The man hastily mopped his running wet face.</p>

<p>'Yes, Se&ntilde;orita!  The sailing-boats are waiting for the wind, to
come into the river.  We will pass by the canal.'</p>

<p>He indicated with a backward movement of the head a narrow,
twisting passage of water between deep reeds.  It made Kate think
of the little river Anapo: the same mystery unbroken.  The boatman,
with creases half of sadness and half of exaltation in his bronze,
still face, was pulling with all his might.  Water-fowl went
swimming into the reeds, or rose on wing and wheeled into the blue
air.  Some willow-trees hung a dripping, vivid green, in the stark
dry country.  The stream was narrow and winding.  With a nonchalant
motion, first of the right then of the left hand, Villiers was
guiding the boatman, to keep him from running aground in the
winding, narrow water-way.</p>

<p>And this put Villiers at his ease, to have something practical and
slightly mechanical to do and to assert.  He was striking the
American note once more, of mechanical dominance.</p>

<p>All the other business had left him incomprehending, and when he
asked Kate, she had pretended not to hear him.  She sensed a
certain delicate, tender mystery in the river, in the naked man in
the water, in the boatman, and she could not bear to have it
subjected to the tough American flippancy.  She was weary to death
of American automatism and American flippant toughness.  It gave
her a feeling of nausea.</p>

<p>'Quite a well-built fellow, that one who laid hold of the boat.
What did he want, anyway?' Villiers insisted.</p>

<p>'Nothing!' said Kate.</p>

<p>They were slipping out past the clay-coloured, loose stony edges of
the land, through a surge of ripples, into the wide white light of
the lake.  A breeze was coming from the east, out of the upright
morning, and the surface of the shallow, flimsy, dun-coloured water
was in motion.  Shoal-water rustled near at hand.  Out to the open,
large, square white sails were stepping gingerly forward, and
beyond the buff-coloured, pale desert of water rose far-away blue,
sharp hills of the other side, many miles away, pure pale blue with
distance, yet sharp-edged and clear in form.</p>

<p>'Now,' said the boatman, smiling to Kate, 'it is easier.  Now we
are out of the current.'</p>

<p>He pulled rhythmically through the frail-rippling, sperm-like
water, with a sense of peace.  And for the first time Kate felt she
had met the mystery of the natives, the strange and mysterious
gentleness between a scylla and a charybdis of violence; the small
poised, perfect body of the bird that waves wings of thunder and
wings of fire and night in its flight.  But central between the
flash of day and the black of night, between the flash of lightning
and the break of thunder, the still, soft body of the bird poised
and soaring, forever.  The mystery of the evening-star brilliant in
silence and distance between the downward-surging plunge of the sun
and the vast, hollow seething of inpouring night.  The magnificence
of the watchful morning-star, that watches between the night and
the day, the gleaming clue to the two opposites.</p>

<p>This kind of frail, pure sympathy, she felt at the moment between
herself and the boatman, between herself and the man who had spoken
from the water.  And she was not going to have it broken by
Villiers' American jokes.</p>

<p>There was a sound of breaking water.  The boatman drew away, and
pointed across to where a canoa, a native sailing-boat, was lying
at an angle.  She had run aground in a wind, and now must wait till
another wind would carry her off the submerged bank again.  Another
boat was coming down the breeze, steering cautiously among the
shoals, for the river outlet.  She was piled high with petates, the
native leaf mats, above her hollowed black sides.  And bare-legged
men with loose white drawers rolled up, and brown chests showing,
were running with poles as the shallows heaved up again, pushing
her off, and balancing their huge hats with small, bird-like shakes
of the head.</p>

<p>Beyond the boats, seawards, were rocks outcropping and strange
birds like pelicans standing in silhouette, motionless.</p>

<p>They had been crossing a bay of the lake-shore, and were nearing
the hotel.  It stood on a parched dry bank above the pale-brown
water, a long, low building amid a tender green of bananas and
pepper-trees.  Everywhere the shores rose up pale and cruelly dry,
dry to cruelty, and on the little hills the dark statues of the
organ cactus poised in nothingness.</p>

<p>There was a broken-down landing-place, and a boat-house in the
distance, and someone in white flannel trousers was standing on the
broken masonry.  Upon the filmy water ducks and black water-fowl
bobbed like corks.  The bottom was stony.  The boatman suddenly
backed the boat, and pulled round.  He pushed up his sleeve and
hung over the bows, reaching into the water.  With a quick motion
he grabbed something, and scrambled into the boat again.  He was
holding in the pale-skinned hollow of his palm a little earthenware
pot, crusted by the lake deposit.</p>

<p>'What is it?' she said.</p>

<p>'Ollita of the gods,' he said.  'Of the old dead gods.  Take it,
Se&ntilde;orita.'</p>

<p>'You must let me pay for it,' she said.</p>

<p>'No, Se&ntilde;orita.  It is yours,' said the man, with that sensitive,
masculine sincerity which comes sometimes so quickly from a native.</p>

<p>It was a little, rough round pot with protuberances.</p>

<p>'Look!' said the man, reaching again for the little pot.  He turned
it upside-down, and she saw cut-in eyes and the sticking-out ears
of an animal's head.</p>

<p>'A cat!' she exclaimed.  'It is a cat.'</p>

<p>'Or a coyote!'</p>

<p>'A coyote!'</p>

<p>'Let's look!' said Villiers.  'Why, how awfully interesting!  Do
you think it's old?'</p>

<p>'It is old?' Kate asked.</p>

<p>'The time of the old gods,' said the boatman.  Then with a sudden
smile:  'The dead gods don't eat much rice, they only want little
casseroles while they are bone under the water.'  And he looked her
in the eyes.</p>

<p>'While they are bone?' she repeated.  And she realized he meant the
skeletons of gods that cannot die.</p>

<p>They were at the landing-stage; or rather, at the heap of collapsed
masonry which had once been a landing-stage.  The boatman got out
and held the boat steady while Kate and Villiers landed.  Then he
scrambled up with the bags.</p>

<p>The man in white trousers, and a mozo appeared.  It was the hotel
manager.  Kate paid the boatman.</p>

<p>'Adi&oacute;s, Se&ntilde;orita!' he said with a smile.  'May you go with
Quetzalcoatl.'</p>

<p>'Yes!' she cried.  'Good-bye!'</p>

<p>They went up the slope between the tattered bananas, whose ragged
leaves were making a hushed, distant patter in the breeze.  The
green fruit curved out its bristly-soft bunch, the purple flower-
bud depending stiffly.</p>

<p>The German manager came to talk to them: a young man of about
forty, with his blue eyes going opaque and stony behind his
spectacles, though the centres were keen.  Evidently a German who
had been many years out in Mexico - out in the lonely places.  The
rather stiff look, the slight look of fear in the SOUL - not
physical fear - and the look of defeat, characteristic of the
European who has long been subjected to the unbroken spirit of
place!  But the defeat was in the soul, not the will.</p>

<p>He showed Kate to her room in the unfinished quarter, and ordered
her breakfast.  The hotel consisted of an old low ranch-house with
a veranda - and this was the dining-room, lounge, kitchen, and
office.  Then there was a two-storey new wing, with a smart
bathroom between each two bedrooms, and almost up-to-date fittings:
very incongruous.</p>

<p>But the new wing was unfinished - had been unfinished for a dozen
years and more, the work abandoned when Porfirio Diaz fled.  Now it
would probably never be finished.</p>

<p>And this is Mexico.  Whatever pretentiousness and modern
improvements it may have, outside the capital, they are either
smashed or raw and unfinished, with rusty bones of iron girders
sticking out.</p>

<p>Kate washed her hands and went down to breakfast.  Before the long
veranda of the old ranch-house the green pepper-trees dropped like
green light, and small cardinal birds with scarlet bodies and
blazing impertinent heads like poppy-buds flashed among the pinkish
pepper-heads, closing their brown wings upon the audacity of their
glowing redness.  A train of geese passed in the glaring sun,
automatic, towards the eternal tremble of pale, earth-coloured
water beyond the stones.</p>

<p>It was a place with a strange atmosphere: stony, hard, broken, with
round cruel hills and the many-fluted bunches of the organ-cactus
behind the old house, and an ancient road trailing past, deep in
ancient dust.  A touch of mystery and cruelty, the stoniness of
fear, a lingering, cruel sacredness.</p>

<p>Kate loitered hungrily, and was glad when the Mexican in shirt-
sleeves and patched trousers, another lingering remnant of Don
Porfirio's day, brought her her eggs and coffee.</p>

<p>He was muted as everything about the place seemed muted, even the
very stones and the water.  Only those poppies on wing, the
cardinal birds, gave a sense of liveliness: and they were uncanny.</p>

<p>So swiftly one's moods changed!  In the boat she had glimpsed the
superb rich stillness of the morning-star, the poignant
intermediate flashing its quiet between the energies of the cosmos.
She had seen it in the black eyes of the natives, in the sunrise of
the man's rich, still body, Indian-warm.</p>

<p>And now again already the silence was of vacuity, arrest, and
cruelty: the uncanny empty unbearableness of many Mexican mornings.
Already she was uneasy, suffering from the malaise which tortures
one inwardly in that country of cactuses.</p>

<p>She went up to her room, pausing at the corridor window to look out
at the savage little hills that stood at the back of the hotel in
desiccated heaps, with the dark-green bulks of organ-cactus
sticking up mechanically and sinister, sombre in all the glare.
Grey ground-squirrels like rats slithered ceaselessly around.
Sinister, strangely dark and sinister, in the great glare of the
sun!</p>

<p>She went to her room to be alone.  Below her window, in the bricks
and fallen rubble of unfinished masonry, a huge white turkey-cock,
dim-white, strutted with his brown hens.  And sometimes he
stretched out his pink wattles and gave vent to fierce, powerful
turkey-yelps, like some strong dog yelping; or else he ruffled all
his feathers like a great, soiled white peony, and chuffed, hissing
here and there, raging the metal of his plumage.</p>

<p>Below him, the eternal tremble of pale-earth, unreal waters, far
beyond which rose the stiff resistance of mountains losing their
pristine blue.  Distinct, frail distances far off on the dry air,
dim-seeing, yet sharp and edged with menace.</p>

<p>Kate took her bath in the filmy water that was hardly like water at
all.  Then she went and sat on the collapsed masonry, in the shade
of the boat-house below.  Small white ducks bobbed about on the
shallow water below her, or dived, raising clouds of submarine
dust.  A canoe came paddling in; a lean fellow with sinewy brown
legs.  He answered Kate's nod with the aloof promptness of an
Indian, made fast his canoe inside the boat-house, and was gone,
stepping silent and barefoot over the bright green water-stones,
and leaving a shadow, cold as flint, on the air behind him.</p>

<p>No sound on the morning save a faint touching of water, and the
occasional powerful yelping of the turkey-cock.  Silence, an
aboriginal, empty silence, as of life WITHHELD.  The vacuity of a
Mexican morning.  Resounding sometimes to the turkey-cock.</p>

<p>And the great, lymphatic expanse of water, like a sea, trembling,
trembling, trembling to a far distance, to the mountains of
substantial nothingness.</p>

<p>Near at hand, a ragged shifting of banana-trees, bare hills with
immobile cactus, and to the left, an hacienda with peon's square
mud boxes of houses.  An occasional ranchero in skintight trousers
and big hat rode trotting through the dust on a small horse, or
peons on the rump of their asses, in floppy white cotton, going
like ghosts.</p>

<p>Always something ghostly.  The morning passing all of a piece,
empty, vacuous.  All sound withheld, all life withheld, everything
HOLDING BACK.  The land so dry as to have a quality of invisibility,
the water earth-filmy, hardly water at all.  The lymphatic milk
of fishes, somebody said.</p>
