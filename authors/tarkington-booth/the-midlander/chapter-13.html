<p>HE <em>HAD </em>no wish to supplant his brother in Mrs. Savage’s
will or in anything;—last of all did he wish to supplant him in
the heart of Martha Shelby. Mrs. Savage had been far from understanding
her grandson’s deep pride, and, as he strode homeward in the slashing
rain, her acrid warnings that he must not hope for anything from
Martha repeated themselves over and over in his mind, as such
things will, and upon each repetition stung the more.</p>

<p>He thought ruefully of the ancient popular notion that such stingings
come from only the unpleasant truth. "It hurts him because it’s
true," people say, sometimes, as if mere insult must ever fail
to rankle, and all accusation not well-founded fall but painlessly
upon the righteous. What Harlan recognized as possibly nearest
the truth among his grandmother’s unfavourable implications was
what hurt him the least. He did not wholly lack the power of self-criticism;
and he was able to perceive that the old lady had at least a foundation
when she said, "Don’t be so superior, young man. That’s always
been your trouble." Harlan was ready to admit that superiority
had always been his trouble.</p>

<p>Not definitely, or in so many words, but nevertheless in fact,
he believed himself superior to other people—even to all other
people. Thus, when he and his brother were children, and their
father took them to Mr. Forepaugh’s circus, Dan was enthusiastic
about a giant seven and a half feet high; but Harlan remained
cold in the lofty presence. True giants were never less than nine
feet tall and this one was "a pretty poor specimen," he declared,
becoming so superior in the matter that Dan fell back upon personalities.
"Well, anyhow, he’s taller than <em>you</em> are, Harlan."</p>

<p>"I’m not in the business of being a giant, thank you," Harlan
said; and Dan, helplessly baffled by the retort, because he was
unable to analyze it, missed the chance to understand a fundamental
part of his brother’s character.</p>

<p>Harlan did not go into the giant business, yet he grew up looking
down on all giants, since they all failed to reach the somewhat
arbitrary nine feet he had set for them. He could not give credit
to a struggling giant of seven feet and a half, and admire him
for the difficulties overcome in getting to be at least that tall;
Harlan really looked down upon such a giant from a height of nine
feet.</p>

<p>Yet he was able, at times, to perceive his superiority as an
unendearing characteristic and even to look upon it with some
philosophic detachment; he did not resent his grandmother’s remarks
upon that subject. What he minded was her assumption that he was
trying to take Dan’s place in Martha Shelby’s heart; Harlan wanted
his own place there, or none.</p>

<p>He had wanted it ever since Martha was a handsome romping girl
of fourteen and he a fastidious observer a little older. She was
a romp, yet her boyish romping never lacked a laughing charm;
for, although she was one of those big young girls who seem to
grow almost overwhelmingly, she had the fortunate gift of gracefulness;
she was somehow able to be large without ever being heavy. And
one evening at a "German" for young people of the age that begins
to be fretful about a correct definition of the word "children,"
she danced lightly to Harlan and unexpectedly "favoured" him;
whereupon something profound straightway happened to the boy’s
emotions.</p>

<p>No visible manifestations betrayed the change within so self-contained
a youth; for here his pride, deep-set even then, was touched;—the
lively Martha’s too obvious preference was always for the brother
so much more of her own sort. Dan was her fellow-romp, and she
would come shouting under the Oliphants’ windows for him as if
she were a boy. They were an effervescent pair, and often rough
in their horseplay with each other; while Harlan, aloof and cold
of eye, would watch them with an inward protest so sharp that
it made him ache.</p>

<p>He wanted to make Martha over from a model of his own devising;
he wished her to be more dignified, and could not understand her
childish love of what to him seemed mere senseless caperings with
the boisterous Dan. Yet neither her caperings nor her devotion
to Dan was able to disperse Harlan’s feeling for her, which gradually
became a kind of customary faint pain. In a little time—a year
or two—the caperings ceased; Martha went eastward, as did the
brothers, for the acquisition of a polish believed to be richer
in that direction; and when she returned she had become dignified,
as Harlan wished, but otherwise did not appear to be greatly altered.
Certainly her devotion to Dan was the same; and her merely becoming
dignified failed to alleviate that customary faint pain of Harlan’s.
He still had it, and with it his long mystification;—he had never
been able to understand why she cared for Dan.</p>

<p>Harlan’s view of his brother as a rather foolish person might
have meant no more than superiority’s tolerant amusement, had
that pain and mystification of his not been involved; but, as
matters were, Harlan would have been superior indeed if all bitterness
had passed him by. He could have submitted, though with a sorrowing
perplexity, to Martha’s inability to be in love with him; but
what sometimes drove him to utter a burst of stung laughter was
the thought that she had given her heart to a man who did not
even perceive the gift. To Harlan that seemed to be the supreme
foolishness of his foolish brother.</p>

<p>Through the rain, as he opened his own gate, he saw in the direction
of the house next door a line of faintly glowing oblongs, swept
across by wet black silhouettes of tossing foliage; and since
these lighted windows at Martha’s were all downstairs, he concluded
that she must have callers; for when she was alone she went up
to her own room to read, and just before nine o’clock Mr. Shelby
put out all the lights of the lower floor. The old gentleman was
sensitive about uselessly high gas bills, in spite of the fact
that he was, himself, to an almost exclusive extent, the company
that produced the gas.</p>

<p>In the vestibule at his own door Harlan furled his umbrella,
shook the spray from his waterproof overcoat, and was groping
in his waistcoat pocket for the latchkey, when his mother unexpectedly
opened the door for him from the inside. "I was standing at a
window looking out, and saw you come up the walk," she explained.
"Your mackintosh looks soaking wet; you must be drowned! The doctor
was here again awhile ago and says Lena’s doing splendidly, and
the nurse just told me she and the baby are both asleep. Come
into the library and dry off. Your father’s gone to bed, but he
lit the fire for you before he went up. We were afraid you’d be
chilled. How did you find mother?"</p>

<p>"About the same, I should say." Harlan hung his dripping overcoat
upon the ponderous walnut hatrack, the base of which was equipped
for such emergencies with a pair of iron soup plates in a high
state of ornamentation. Then he followed his mother into the library
and went to sit by the fire, extending his long legs to its warmth,
so that presently the drenched light shoes he wore began to emit
a perceptible vapour.</p>

<p>"You ought to have worn your rubbers," Mrs. Oliphant said reproachfully;
and then as he only murmured "Oh, no," in response, she said in
a tone of inquiry: "I suppose you didn’t happen to see anything
of Dan?"</p>

<p>"Not very likely! Not much to be seen between here and grandma’s
just now except night and water."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," she assented. "I thought possibly you might have
gone somewhere else after you left mother’s."</p>

<p>"No." But there had been something a little perturbed in her
voice and he turned to look at her. "Were you at the window on
Dan’s account, mother? Are you anxious about him?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly anxious," she answered. "But—well, I just thought——"
She paused.</p>

<p>Harlan laughed. "Don’t be worried about it. I’ll sit up for him,
if you like. I dare say your surmise is correct."</p>

<p>"My surmise?" she repeated, a little embarrassed. "What surmise?"</p>

<p>"About how your wandering boy has spent his evening," Harlan
returned lightly. "I haven’t a doubt you’re right, and he’s followed
the good old custom."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oliphant coloured a little. "I don’t know what you mean."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you do!"</p>

<p>"I don’t," she protested, with a consciousness of manner that
betrayed how well she understood him in spite of her denial. "I
don’t, indeed!"</p>

<p>"No?" the amused Harlan said mockingly. "You don’t know that
upon the birth of an heir—especially when it’s the first and a
boy—it’s always understood by every good citizen of these parts
that it’s the proud father’s business to go out and celebrate?
Don’t worry, mother: Dan won’t go so far with it that he’ll be
unable to get home. Even in his liveliest times at college he
always kept his head."</p>

<p>"I’m not exactly worried," she explained, with a troubled air.
"I know young fathers usually <em>do</em> cut up a little like
that;—the only time in his life when your father didn’t seem to
be quite himself was the night after Dan was born. I’m afraid
he was really almost a little tight, and I gave him such a talking
to when I was well enough, that he didn’t repeat it when you came
along. But I haven’t been worrying so much about Dan’s going downtown
and celebrating a little, as you call it—he’s so steady nowadays,
and works so hard I don’t think it would be much harm—but I thought—I
was a little afraid—I——"</p>

<p>"Afraid of what, mother?"</p>

<p>"Well, he was so exhilarated, so excited about his having a son—he
was so much that way before he went out, I was a little afraid
that when he added stimulants to the tremendous spirits he was
already in, he might do something foolish."</p>

<p>"Why, of course he will," Harlan assured her cheerfully. "But
it will only amount to some uproariousness and singing at the
club, probably."</p>

<p>"I know," she said. "But I’ve been afraid he’d do something that
would put him in a foolish position."</p>

<p>"I shouldn’t have that on my mind if I were you, mother. There’s
hardly ever anybody at the club in the evening, and the one or
two who’d be there on a night like this certainly wouldn’t be
critical! Besides, they’d <em>expect</em> a little boisterousness
from him, under the circumstances."</p>

<p>"I know—I know," she said, but neither her tone nor her expression
denoted that his reassurances completely soothed her. On the contrary,
her anxiety seemed to increase;—she had remained near the open
door leading into the hall, and her attitude was that of one who
uneasily awaits an event.</p>

<p>"Mother, why don’t you go to bed? I’ll see that he gets in all
right and I won’t let him go near Lena’s room, if that’s what’s
bothering you."</p>

<p>"It isn’t," she returned; was silent a moment; then she said
abruptly: "Harlan, would you mind going over to Martha’s?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Would you mind going over there? You could make up some excuse;
you could say you wanted to borrow a book or something."</p>

<p>"Why, it’s after half-past ten," Harlan said, astonished. "What
on earth do you want me to go over there for, as late as this?"</p>

<p>"Well, it’s why I am a little worried," she explained. "I’d been
standing at the window a long while before you came, Harlan; and
about half an hour ago I thought I saw Dan and someone else come
along the sidewalk and stop at our gate. At any rate two men did
stop at the gate."</p>

<p>"You recognized Dan?"</p>

<p>"No; it was too dark and raining too hard. I thought at first
perhaps it was you with someone you knew and had happened to walk
along with. I went to the front door and opened it, but I could
only make out that they seemed to be talking and gesturing a good
deal, and I thought I recognized your cousin Fred Oliphant’s voice.
I waited, with the door open, but they didn’t come in, and pretty
soon they went on. I called, ‘Dan! Oh, Dan!’ but the wind was
blowing so I don’t suppose they heard me. Then I thought I saw
the same two going up the Shelbys’ walk to the front veranda.
They must have gone in, because a minute or so afterwards the
downstairs windows over there were lighted up. Couldn’t you make
some excuse to go over and see if it’s Dan?"</p>

<p>Harlan jumped up from his chair by the fire. "It just <em>might</em>
be Dan," he said, frowning. "I don’t think so, but——"</p>

<p>"I’m <em>so</em> afraid it is!" Mrs. Oliphant exclaimed. "I don’t
like to bother you, and it may be a little awkward for you, going
in so late, but you can surely think of some reasonable excuse,
if it <em>isn’t</em> Dan. If it is, do get him away as quickly
as you can; I’d be terribly upset to have him make an exhibition
of himself before Martha—she’s always had such a high opinion
of him."</p>

<p>"Yes, she has!" Harlan interrupted dryly, as he strode out into
the hall; and he added: "I don’t suppose Lena’d be <em>too</em>
pleased!"</p>

<p>"She’d be furious," his mother lamented in a whisper. She helped
him to put on his wet waterproof coat, and continued her whisper.
"She’s never been able to like poor Martha, and if she heard he
went there to-night when she’s still so sick, she—she——"</p>

<p>"Yes, she would!" Harlan said grimly, finishing the thought for
her. "You might as well go to bed now, mother."</p>

<p>"No, no," she said. "If it is Dan, I won’t let him see me when
you get back, but I just want to know he’s safely in. And try
to—try to——"</p>

<p>"Try to what, mother?" he asked, pausing with the door open.</p>

<p>"Try to explain it a little to Martha. She’s always been such
a good friend of his, and he needs friends. Try to keep her from
losing her high opinion of him. She’s always——"</p>

<p>"She has indeed!" Harlan returned with a wry smile. "I’ll do
what I can." And he closed the door behind him as gently as he
could, against the turbulent wind. </p>
