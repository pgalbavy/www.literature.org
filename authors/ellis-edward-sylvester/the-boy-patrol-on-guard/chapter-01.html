<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>One bright sunshiny day in the summer of 1912, a boy some seventeen
years old awoke to the fact that he had lost his way in the depth
of the woods of southern Maine.</p>

<p>He was a sturdy Irish youth, with red hair, freckled face, a
fine set of teeth, an exhaustless fund of good nature, humor and
wit, of pugnacious temperament, like so many of his people, but
so truthful and chivalrous that every one with whom he came in
contact speedily grew to like him.</p>

<p>Now, if you have <em>idled</em> your time in reading my "Launch
Boys" stories, you will recall this lad, Mike Murphy by name,
for they gave a pretty full record of his adventures on the Kennebec
and along its shores. In order to make clear the incidents that
follow I must add a few words of explanation.</p>

<p>Mike, as you may recall, was gifted with a voice of marvelous
purity and sweetness. His singing of several Irish songs on the
steamer crossing the Atlantic enthralled the listeners and so
roused the admiration of a famous prima donna that she offered
to prepare him for the operatic stage, but there was nothing attractive
in such a career to the modest lad. He preferred the simple life
with its invigorating ozone and freedom. During the winter months
he was one of the most regular attendants at the school in Boothbay
Harbor, where, under the skilful tutelage of Professor Herbert
E. Bowman, he made rapid progress in his studies. So with warm
thanks to the distinguished songstress, he passed up the proposition.</p>

<p>Mike’s father was caretaker for the millionaire capitalist, Gideon
Landon, of New York, who had built a fine bungalow on the southern
end of Southport Island, where the Irishman, his wife and the
son Mike dwelt in a cottage near the large structure. A little
way to the south was the home of Chester Haynes in a bungalow
less pretentious than the other. Alvin Landon and Chester Haynes
were chums, the former being the owner of a splendid launch, the
<em>Deerfoot</em>, in which the three boys met with more than
one stirring adventure. Although Mike knew nothing about the management
of a boat, Alvin made him his first mate, and thus opened the
way for the experiences that have been related elsewhere.</p>

<p>Hardly had the summer’s sport begun for the three boys with their
motor boat, when the machinery broke down disastrously. It was
plain that the craft would have to go to the repair shops in Portland
before it could be of any further use to them. Accordingly, it
was towed to that city, with the natural request that work should
be rushed. The reply came back that there was such a congestion
in the shops that it would require two or three weeks to complete
the job. You know what that always means. The time is sure to
be much longer than named, and it may be said the boys knew such
would be the fact. It was a keen disappointment to them, but there
was no help for it and they accepted the situation like true philosophers.</p>

<p>This incident, trifling of itself, brought consequences to our
young friends of which none of them dreamed. Alvin and Chester
while at home had become interested in the admirable Boy Scout
organization, and had joined the Blazing Arrow Patrol, of which
their old friend "Bert Hall" was Scout Master. He was arranging
for an outing in the Adirondacks with the Stag and Eagle Patrols,
when the plan was changed for reasons that will soon be explained.
Their destination became Gosling Lake in southern Maine, a few
miles back in the woods from the Kennebec River.</p>

<p>Alvin and Chester decided to bear them company as tenderfeet.
They provided themselves with natty uniforms, and, knowing the
size required for Mike, sent a suit by express to him with the
request that he should join them in the hike to the cool twilight
of the pine woods.</p>

<p>"It would never do to go without him," said Alvin; "he will be
the life of the camp and will make a model Boy Scout."</p>

<p>"The hardest task will be to cure him of his love for fighting,"
added Chester; "he can get up a first class shindy in ten minutes,
no matter where he is placed."</p>

<p>"There won’t be anything of the kind with the Scouts, for it
is impossible; they are taught to detest fighting and Mike is
always so chivalrous that he is never the aggressor. I prophesy
there won’t be a more peaceable boy in camp than he."</p>

<p>"It is to be hoped so," commented Chester with a dubious shake
of his head.</p>

<p>When the garments arrived Mike was mystified. He lifted them
out of the box and held them up for the inspection of himself
and parents. His father took his pipe from his mouth, squinted
an eye as if aiming a gun and gravely remarked:</p>

<p>"It’s a Sunday suit meant fur <em>me</em>,—there’s no doubt of
the same."</p>

<p>"Ye’re mistook, dad, as much as ye were last night whin ye picked
up that red hot coal thinking it was a cold pratie. The garments
are intinded either for mither or mesilf, as will be told whin
we try ’em on."</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that Mike looked "nifty" in his uniform,
which fitted him as if he had been melted and poured into it.
The hat was of olive-drab felt, with eyelets in the crown for
ventilation and enough stiffness to keep its shape; breeches of
olive-drab khaki cut full and with legs laced below the knee and
with belt guides and pockets; leggings or puttees of waterproof
army duck; poncho; shirt of olive-drab flannel with two bellows
pockets, open front, coat style; coat of same material as breeches,
with four bellows pockets, straight collar, dull metal buttons
with Boy Scout emblem; an ordinary belt; shoes, broad, high and
strong and of soft tan leather; a haversack of waterproof canvas,
with leather straps, buckles and separate pockets, scout emblem
on the flap—these were the chief garments in which Mike Murphy
carefully arrayed himself. He turned slowly around as if on a
pivot for his parents to admire. At the same time, he strove to
twist his head about so as to gain a view of the rear, but it
cannot be said his effort was successful.</p>

<p>"It is sthrange that the lad didn’t sind any word of explanition,"
remarked the father, after a search in the box and the different
pockets failed to bring anything in the nature of a letter to
light.</p>

<p>"He may have sint it through the mail—begorrah! how come I to
furgit it?"</p>

<p>"What’s the matter wid ye?" asked the mother as her son leaped
to the chair over which he had hung his discarded clothes and
began a vigorous fumbling of them. From the hip pocket of his
trousers he drew a creased and soiled envelope, glanced at it
and handed it to his father.</p>

<p>"Is that yer name writ on the same?"</p>

<p>The astonished parent turned it over, held it off and then drew
it closer.</p>

<p>"If me name is Pathrick Murphy the letter is for me, fur that
is what is writ on the outside. How long have ye been toting that
about the counthry?"</p>

<p>Mike reflected for a moment.</p>

<p>"To-day is Wednesday; let me think,—yes, it was last Monday morning
that I was handed the letter by the postmaster at Boothbay Harbor,—he
being afeard to trust ye wid the same, fur fear ye would not give
it to yersilf."</p>

<p>"Why didn’t ye hand it to me before this?"</p>

<p>"I forgot, dad, as Tim O’Shaughnessy said after moving back the
well curb and then slipping down the well. Shall I spell out the
words fur ye?" asked Mike as his father ran his stubby finger
under the flap of the letter and ripped it apart.</p>

<p>"If ye think ye’re able to know writing, ye may thry yer hand."</p>

<p>Mike unfolded the slip and read aloud the contents. The letter
was from Alvin Landon and had been mailed before the uniform was
sent. All would have gone right had the missive been addressed
to Mike, but Alvin, with his fine sense of propriety, had written
directly to the parent, asking consent for his son to spend several
weeks with the Boy Scouts in camp on Gosling Lake. There was no
question in the writer’s mind as to such permission being granted.</p>

<p>Following this request were some sentences for Mike himself.
After directing him how to reach the sheet of water, Alvin added:</p>

<p>"Chester and I have become ‘Tenderfeet’ as they are called, which
is the lowest grade among the Boy Scouts. Your name has been proposed
by us and we see no reason why you should not be accepted. But
before that can take place, you must pass the examination, which
with some studying I am sure you will be able to do. It isn’t
likely you can find any one at Southport or Boothbay Harbor to
help you, nor is it necessary. What you must know is:</p>

<p>"The Scout law, sign, salute and meaning of the badge (Chester
and I can teach you that in a few minutes); the composition and
history of our country’s flag and the usual forms of respect due
it. (This is learned as easily as the other); and you must be
able to tie four of the following knots: square or reef, sheet-bend,
bowline, fisherman’s, sheepshank, halter, clove hitch, timber
hitch or two half-hitches.</p>

<p>"I think you told Chester and me that on your trip across the
ocean you made friends with several of the sailors, who taught
you how to tie a number of knots. If this is so, you will have
no trouble on that score. So you see you have not much preparation
to make. I tell you, Mike, this is the finest thing of the kind
in the world and is just what you need. You will have plenty of
fun, which you know is your chief aim in life, with a fair prospect
of becoming a gentleman (I trust).</p>

<p>"We expect to reach Gosling Lake in time to get into our quarters
on Wednesday and shall look for you to be there to help us with
our work."</p>

<p>"And this is Wednesday morning!" repeated Mike in dismay; "what
have the poor byes done widout me to give them suggistions?"</p>

<p>"They have done a good deal better than had ye been wid them,"
replied his mother; "being ye have delayed so long, it’s best
ye bide at home."</p>

<p>With a start Mike looked at her, but the twinkle in her blue
eyes showed from which parent the son inherited most of his waggishness.</p>

<p>"I must be off," said he, springing to his feet. He would have
been out of the house the next minute had not his father checked
him.</p>

<p>"Show a little sinse even if ye niver had any; ate a big maal,
which ye can do at any time no matter if it be in the middle of
the night; put some money and yer knife, watch and compass in
yer pocket. Take that buckthorn shillalah, with which I have cracked
many a hid at Donnybrook; then hie ye to Boothbay Harbor and hire
some one to take ye to the right spot up the Sheepscott and then
thramp through the woods, as ye have been towld to do to Gosling
Lake, comporting yersilf like a gintleman, and not make yer father
and mither ashamed of ye as ye have done many a time."</p>

<p>This counsel was so wise that the impulsive youth could not object.
Despite the completeness of his uniform and equipments more than
one thing was lacking. He needed toilet articles, a change of
underclothing, needles, thread and a number of trifling conveniences,
which a thoughtful mother never forgets.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that early in the afternoon Mike walked to
Southport and there boarded the little steamer <em>Norman II</em>,
and soon thereafter landed at Boothbay Harbor, full of eager expectancy,
and little dreaming of the remarkable experience that awaited
him. </p>
