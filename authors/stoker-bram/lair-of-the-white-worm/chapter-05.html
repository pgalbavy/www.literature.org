Mr. Salton introduced Adam to Mr. Watford and his grand-daughters,
and they all moved on together.  Of course neighbours in the
position of the Watfords knew all about Adam Salton, his
relationship, circumstances, and prospects.  So it would have been
strange indeed if both girls did not dream of possibilities of the
future.  In agricultural England, eligible men of any class are
rare.  This particular man was specially eligible, for he did not
belong to a class in which barriers of caste were strong.  So when
it began to be noticed that he walked beside Mimi Watford and seemed
to desire her society, all their friends endeavoured to give the
promising affair a helping hand.  When the gongs sounded for the
banquet, he went with her into the tent where her grandfather had
seats.  Mr. Salton and Sir Nathaniel noticed that the young man did
not come to claim his appointed place at the dais table; but they
understood and made no remark, or indeed did not seem to notice his
absence.
<P>
Lady Arabella sat as before at Edgar Caswall's right hand.  She was
certainly a striking and unusual woman, and to all it seemed fitting
from her rank and personal qualities that she should be the chosen
partner of the heir on his first appearance.  Of course nothing was
said openly by those of her own class who were present; but words
were not necessary when so much could be expressed by nods and
smiles.  It seemed to be an accepted thing that at last there was to
be a mistress of Castra Regis, and that she was present amongst
them.  There were not lacking some who, whilst admitting all her
charm and beauty, placed her in the second rank, Lilla Watford being
marked as first.  There was sufficient divergence of type, as well
as of individual beauty, to allow of fair comment; Lady Arabella
represented the aristocratic type, and Lilla that of the commonalty.
<P>
When the dusk began to thicken, Mr. Salton and Sir Nathaniel walked
home--the trap had been sent away early in the day--leaving Adam to
follow in his own time.  He came in earlier than was expected, and
seemed upset about something.  Neither of the elders made any
comment.  They all lit cigarettes, and, as dinner-time was close at
hand, went to their rooms to get ready.
<P>
Adam had evidently been thinking in the interval.  He joined the
others in the drawing-room, looking ruffled and impatient--a
condition of things seen for the first time.  The others, with the
patience--or the experience--of age, trusted to time to unfold and
explain things.  They had not long to wait.  After sitting down and
standing up several times, Adam suddenly burst out.
<P>
"That fellow seems to think he owns the earth.  Can't he let people
alone!  He seems to think that he has only to throw his handkerchief
to any woman, and be her master."
<P>
This outburst was in itself enlightening.  Only thwarted affection
in some guise could produce this feeling in an amiable young man.
Sir Nathaniel, as an old diplomatist, had a way of understanding, as
if by foreknowledge, the true inwardness of things, and asked
suddenly, but in a matter-of-fact, indifferent voice:
<P>
"Was he after Lilla?"
<P>
"Yes, and the fellow didn't lose any time either.  Almost as soon as
they met, he began to butter her up, and tell her how beautiful she
was.  Why, before he left her side, he had asked himself to tea to-
morrow at Mercy Farm.  Stupid ass!  He might see that the girl isn't
his sort!  I never saw anything like it.  It was just like a hawk
and a pigeon."
<P>
As he spoke, Sir Nathaniel turned and looked at Mr. Salton--a keen
look which implied a full understanding.
<P>
"Tell us all about it, Adam.  There are still a few minutes before
dinner, and we shall all have better appetites when we have come to
some conclusion on this matter."
<P>
"There is nothing to tell, sir; that is the worst of it.  I am bound
to say that there was not a word said that a human being could
object to.  He was very civil, and all that was proper--just what a
landlord might be to a tenant's daughter. . . Yet--yet--well, I
don't know how it was, but it made my blood boil."
<P>
"How did the hawk and the pigeon come in?"  Sir Nathaniel's voice
was soft and soothing, nothing of contradiction or overdone
curiosity in it--a tone eminently suited to win confidence.
<P>
"I can hardly explain.  I can only say that he looked like a hawk
and she like a dove--and, now that I think of it, that is what they
each did look like; and do look like in their normal condition."
<P>
"That is so!" came the soft voice of Sir Nathaniel.
<P>
Adam went on:
<P>
"Perhaps that early Roman look of his set me off.  But I wanted to
protect her; she seemed in danger."
<P>
"She seems in danger, in a way, from all you young men.  I couldn't
help noticing the way that even you looked--as if you wished to
absorb her!"
<P>
"I hope both you young men will keep your heads cool," put in Mr.
Salton.  "You know, Adam, it won't do to have any quarrel between
you, especially so soon after his home-coming and your arrival here.
We must think of the feelings and happiness of our neighbours;
mustn't we?"
<P>
"I hope so, sir.  I assure you that, whatever may happen, or even
threaten, I shall obey your wishes in this as in all things."
<P>
"Hush!" whispered Sir Nathaniel, who heard the servants in the
passage bringing dinner.
<P>
After dinner, over the walnuts and the wine, Sir Nathaniel returned
to the subject of the local legends.
<P>
"It will perhaps be a less dangerous topic for us to discuss than
more recent ones."
<P>
"All right, sir," said Adam heartily.  "I think you may depend on me
now with regard to any topic.  I can even discuss Mr. Caswall.
Indeed, I may meet him to-morrow.  He is going, as I said, to call
at Mercy Farm at three o'clock--but I have an appointment at two."
<P>
"I notice," said Mr. Salton, "that you do not lose any time."
<P>
The two old men once more looked at each other steadily.  Then, lest
the mood of his listener should change with delay, Sir Nathaniel
began at once:
<P>
"I don't propose to tell you all the legends of Mercia, or even to
make a selection of them.  It will be better, I think, for our
purpose if we consider a few facts--recorded or unrecorded--about
this neighbourhood.  I think we might begin with Diana's Grove.  It
has roots in the different epochs of our history, and each has its
special crop of legend.  The Druid and the Roman are too far off for
matters of detail; but it seems to me the Saxon and the Angles are
near enough to yield material for legendary lore.  We find that this
particular place had another name besides Diana's Grove.  This was
manifestly of Roman origin, or of Grecian accepted as Roman.  The
other is more pregnant of adventure and romance than the Roman name.
In Mercian tongue it was 'The Lair of the White Worm.'  This needs a
word of explanation at the beginning.
<P>
"In the dawn of the language, the word 'worm' had a somewhat
different meaning from that in use to-day.  It was an adaptation of
the Anglo-Saxon 'wyrm,' meaning a dragon or snake; or from the
Gothic 'waurms,' a serpent; or the Icelandic 'ormur,' or the German
'wurm.'  We gather that it conveyed originally an idea of size and
power, not as now in the diminutive of both these meanings.  Here
legendary history helps us.  We have the well-known legend of the
'Worm Well' of Lambton Castle, and that of the 'Laidly Worm of
Spindleston Heugh' near Bamborough.  In both these legends the
'worm' was a monster of vast size and power--a veritable dragon or
serpent, such as legend attributes to vast fens or quags where there
was illimitable room for expansion.  A glance at a geological map
will show that whatever truth there may have been of the actuality
of such monsters in the early geologic periods, at least there was
plenty of possibility.  In England there were originally vast plains
where the plentiful supply of water could gather.  The streams were
deep and slow, and there were holes of abysmal depth, where any kind
and size of antediluvian monster could find a habitat.  In places,
which now we can see from our windows, were mud-holes a hundred or
more feet deep.  Who can tell us when the age of the monsters which
flourished in slime came to an end?  There must have been places and
conditions which made for greater longevity, greater size, greater
strength than was usual.  Such over-lappings may have come down even
to our earlier centuries.  Nay, are there not now creatures of a
vastness of bulk regarded by the generality of men as impossible?
Even in our own day there are seen the traces of animals, if not the
animals themselves, of stupendous size--veritable survivals from
earlier ages, preserved by some special qualities in their habitats.
I remember meeting a distinguished man in India, who had the
reputation of being a great shikaree, who told me that the greatest
temptation he had ever had in his life was to shoot a giant snake
which he had come across in the Terai of Upper India.  He was on a
tiger-shooting expedition, and as his elephant was crossing a
nullah, it squealed.  He looked down from his howdah and saw that
the elephant had stepped across the body of a snake which was
dragging itself through the jungle.  'So far as I could see,' he
said, 'it must have been eighty or one hundred feet in length.
Fully forty or fifty feet was on each side of the track, and though
the weight which it dragged had thinned it, it was as thick round as
a man's body.  I suppose you know that when you are after tiger, it
is a point of honour not to shoot at anything else, as life may
depend on it.  I could easily have spined this monster, but I felt
that I must not--so, with regret, I had to let it go.'
<P>
"Just imagine such a monster anywhere in this country, and at once
we could get a sort of idea of the 'worms,' which possibly did
frequent the great morasses which spread round the mouths of many of
the great European rivers."
<P>
"I haven't the least doubt, sir, that there may have been such
monsters as you have spoken of still existing at a much later period
than is generally accepted," replied Adam.  "Also, if there were
such things, that this was the very place for them.  I have tried to
think over the matter since you pointed out the configuration of the
ground.  But it seems to me that there is a hiatus somewhere.  Are
there not mechanical difficulties?"
<P>
"In what way?"
<P>
"Well, our antique monster must have been mighty heavy, and the
distances he had to travel were long and the ways difficult.  From
where we are now sitting down to the level of the mud-holes is a
distance of several hundred feet--I am leaving out of consideration
altogether any lateral distance.  Is it possible that there was a
way by which a monster could travel up and down, and yet no chance
recorder have ever seen him?  Of course we have the legends; but is
not some more exact evidence necessary in a scientific
investigation?"
<P>
"My dear Adam, all you say is perfectly right, and, were we starting
on such an investigation, we could not do better than follow your
reasoning.  But, my dear boy, you must remember that all this took
place thousands of years ago.  You must remember, too, that all
records of the kind that would help us are lacking.  Also, that the
places to be considered were desert, so far as human habitation or
population are considered.  In the vast desolation of such a place
as complied with the necessary conditions, there must have been such
profusion of natural growth as would bar the progress of men formed
as we are.  The lair of such a monster would not have been disturbed
for hundreds--or thousands--of years.  Moreover, these creatures
must have occupied places quite inaccessible to man.  A snake who
could make himself comfortable in a quagmire, a hundred feet deep,
would be protected on the outskirts by such stupendous morasses as
now no longer exist, or which, if they exist anywhere at all, can be
on very few places on the earth's surface.  Far be it from me to say
that in more elemental times such things could not have been.  The
condition belongs to the geologic age--the great birth and growth of
the world, when natural forces ran riot, when the struggle for
existence was so savage that no vitality which was not founded in a
gigantic form could have even a possibility of survival.  That such
a time existed, we have evidences in geology, but there only; we can
never expect proofs such as this age demands.  We can only imagine
or surmise such things--or such conditions and such forces as
overcame them."
