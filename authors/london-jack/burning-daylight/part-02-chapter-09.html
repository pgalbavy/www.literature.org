The time passed, and Daylight played on at the game.  But the
game had entered upon a new phase.  The lust for power in the
mere gambling and winning was metamorphosing into the lust for
power in order to revenge.  There were many men in San Francisco
against whom he had registered black marks, and now and again,
with one of his lightning strokes, he erased such a mark.  He
asked no quarter; he gave no quarter.  Men feared and hated him,
and no one loved him, except Larry Hegan, his lawyer, who would
have laid down his life for him.  But he was the only man with
whom Daylight was really intimate, though he was on terms of
friendliest camaraderie with the rough and unprincipled following
of the bosses who ruled the Riverside Club.
<P>
On the other hand, San Francisco's attitude toward Daylight had
undergone a change.  While he, with his slashing buccaneer
methods, was a distinct menace to the more orthodox financial
gamblers, he was nevertheless so grave a menace that they were
glad enough to leave him alone.  He had already taught them the
excellence of letting a sleeping dog lie.  Many of the men, who
knew that they were in danger of his big bear-paw when it reached
out for the honey vats, even made efforts to placate him, to get
on the friendly side of him.  The Alta-Pacific approached him
confidentially with an offer of reinstatement, which he promptly
declined.  He was after a number of men in that club, and,
whenever opportunity offered, he reached out for them and mangled
them.  Even the newspapers, with one or two blackmailing
exceptions, ceased abusing him and became respectful.  In short,
he was looked upon as a bald-faced grizzly from the Arctic wilds
to whom it was considered expedient to give the trail.  At the
time he raided the steamship companies, they had yapped at him
and worried him, the whole pack of them, only to have him whirl
around and whip them in the fiercest pitched battle San Francisco
had ever known.  Not easily forgotten was the Pacific Slope
Seaman's strike and the giving over of the municipal government
to the labor bosses and grafters.  The destruction of Charles
Klinkner and the California and Altamont Trust Company had been a
warning.  But it was an isolated case; they had been confident in
strength in numbers--until he taught them better.
<P>
Daylight still engaged in daring speculations, as, for instance,
at the impending outbreak of the Japanese-Russian War, when, in
the face of the experience and power of the shipping gamblers, he
reached out and clutched practically a monopoly of available
steamer-charters.  There was scarcely a battered tramp on the
Seven Seas that was not his on time charter.  As usual, his
position was, "You've got to come and see me"; which they did,
and, to use another of his phrases, they "paid through the nose"
for the privilege.  And all his venturing and fighting had now
but
one motive.  Some day, as he confided to Hegan, when he'd made a
sufficient stake, he was going back to New York and knock the
spots
out of Messrs. Dowsett, Letton, and Guggenhammer.  He'd
show them what an all-around general buzz-saw he was and what a
mistake they'd made ever to monkey with him.  But he never lost
his head, and he knew that he was not yet strong enough to go
into death-grapples with those three early enemies.  In the
meantime the black marks against them remained for a future
easement day.
<P>
Dede Mason was still in the office.  He had made no more
overtures, discussed no more books and no more grammar.  He had
no active interest in her, and she was to him a pleasant memory
of what had never happened, a joy, which, by his essential
nature, he was barred from ever knowing.  Yet, while his interest
had gone to sleep and his energy was consumed in the endless
battles he waged, he knew every trick of the light on her hair,
every quick denote mannerism of movement, every line of her
figure as expounded by her tailor-made gowns.  Several times, six
months or so apart, he had increased her salary, until now she
was receiving ninety dollars a month.  Beyond this he dared not
go, though he had got around it by making the work easier.  This
he had accomplished after her return from a vacation, by
retaining her substitute as an assistant.  Also, he had changed
his office suite, so that now the two girls had a room by
themselves.
<P>
His eye had become quite critical wherever Dede Mason was
concerned.  He had long since noted her pride of carriage.  It
was unobtrusive, yet it was there.  He decided, from the way she
carried it, that she deemed her body a thing to be proud of, to
be cared for as a beautiful and valued possession.  In this, and
in the way she carried her clothes, he compared her with her
assistant, with the stenographers he encountered in other
offices, with the women he saw on the sidewalks.  "She's sure
well put up," he communed with himself; "and she sure knows how
to dress and carry it off without being stuck on herself and
without laying it on thick."
<P>
The more he saw of her, and the more he thought he knew of her,
the more unapproachable did she seem to him.  But since he had no
intention of approaching her, this was anything but an
unsatisfactory fact.  He was glad he had her in his office, and
hoped she'd stay, and that was about all.
<P>
Daylight did not improve with the passing years.  The life was
not good for him.  He was growing stout and soft, and there was
unwonted flabbiness in his muscles.  The more he drank cocktails,
the more he was compelled to drink in order to get the desired
result, the inhibitions that eased him down from the concert
pitch of his operations.  And with this went wine, too, at meals,
and the long drinks after dinner of Scotch and soda at the
Riverside.  Then, too, his body suffered from lack of exercise;
and, from lack of decent human associations, his moral fibres
were weakening.  Never a man to hide anything, some of his
escapades became public, such as speeding, and of joy-rides in
his big red motor-car down to San Jose with companions distinctly
sporty--incidents that were narrated as good fun and comically in
the newspapers.
<P>
Nor was there anything to save him.  Religion had passed him by. 
"A long time dead" was his epitome of that phase of speculation. 
He was not interested in humanity.  According to his rough-hewn
sociology, it was all a gamble.  God was a whimsical, abstract,
mad thing called Luck.  As to how one happened to be
born--whether
a sucker or a robber--was a gamble to begin with; Luck dealt out
the cards, and the little babies picked up the hands allotted
them. 
Protest was vain.  Those were their cards and they had to play
them, willy-nilly, hunchbacked or straight backed, crippled or
clean-limbed, addle-pated or clear- headed.  There was no
fairness
in it.  The cards most picked up put them into the sucker class;
the cards of a few enabled them to become robbers.  The playing
of
the cards was life--the crowd of players, society.
<P>
The table was the earth, and the earth, in lumps and chunks, from
loaves of bread to big red motor-cars, was the stake.  And in the
end, lucky and unlucky, they were all a long time dead.
<P>
It was hard on the stupid lowly, for they were coppered to lose
from the start; but the more he saw of the others, the apparent
winners, the less it seemed to him that they had anything to brag
about.  They, too, were a long time dead, and their living did
not amount to much.  It was a wild animal fight; the strong
trampled the weak, and the strong, he had already
discovered,--men
like Dowsett, and Letton, and Guggenhammer,--were not necessarily
the best.  He remembered his miner comrades of the Arctic.  They
were the stupid lowly, they did the hard work and were robbed of
the fruit of their toil just as was the old woman making wine in
the Sonoma hills; and yet they had finer qualities of truth, and
loyalty, and square-dealing than did the men who robbed them. 
The
winners seemed to be the crooked ones, the unfaithful ones, the
wicked ones.  And even they had no say in the matter.  They
played
the cards that were given them; and Luck, the monstrous, mad-god
thing, the owner of the whole shebang, looked on and grinned.  It
was he who stacked the universal card-deck of existence.
<P>
There was no justice in the deal.  The little men that came, the
little pulpy babies, were not even asked if they wanted to try a
flutter at the game.  They had no choice.  Luck jerked them into
life, slammed them up against the jostling table, and told them:
"Now play, damn you, play!"  And they did their best, poor little
devils.  The play of some led to steam yachts and mansions; of
others, to the asylum or the pauper's ward.  Some played the one
same card, over and over, and made wine all their days in the
chaparral, hoping, at the end, to pull down a set of false teeth
and a coffin.  Others quit the game early, having drawn cards
that called for violent death, or famine in the Barrens, or
loathsome and lingering disease.  The hands of some called for
kingship and irresponsible and numerated power; other hands
called for ambition, for wealth in untold sums, for disgrace and
shame, or for women and wine.
<P>
As for himself, he had drawn a lucky hand, though he could not
see all the cards.  Somebody or something might get him yet.  The
mad god, Luck, might be tricking him along to some such end.  An
unfortunate set of circumstances, and in a month's time the
robber gang might be war-dancing around his financial carcass. 
This very day a street-car might run him down, or a sign fall
from a building and smash in his skull.  Or there was disease,
ever rampant, one of Luck's grimmest whims.  Who could say? 
To-morrow, or some other day, a ptomaine bug, or some other of a
thousand bugs, might jump out upon him and drag him down.  There
was Doctor Bascom, Lee Bascom who had stood beside him a week ago
and talked and argued, a picture of magnificent youth, and
strength, and health.  And in three days he was dead--pneumonia,
rheumatism of the heart, and heaven knew what else--at the end
screaming in agony that could be heard a block away.  That had
been terrible.  It was a fresh, raw stroke in Daylight's
consciousness.  And when would his own turn come?  Who could say?
<P>
In the meantime there was nothing to do but play the cards he
could see in his hand, and they were BATTLE, REVENGE, AND
COCKTAILS.  And Luck sat over all and grinned.
