<P>
RECOVERING from the first overpowering sensation of surprise,
Mercy rapidly advanced, eager to say her first penitent words.
Grace stopped her by a warning gesture of the hand. "No nearer to
me," she said, with a look of contemptuous command. "Stay where
you are."
<P>
Mercy paused. Grace's reception had startled her. She
instinctively took the chair nearest to her to support herself.
Grace raised a warning hand for the second time, and issued
another command: "I forbid you to be seated in my presence. You
have no right to be in this house at all. Remember, if you
please, who you are, and who I am."
<P>
The tone in which those words were spoken was an insult in
itself. Mercy suddenly lifted her head; the angry answer was on
her lips. She checked it, and submitted in silence. "I will be
worthy of Julian Gray's confidence in me," she thought, as she
stood patiently by the chair. "I will bear anything from the
woman whom I have wronged."
<P>
In silence the two faced each other; alone together, for the
first time since they had met in the French cottage. The contrast
between them was strange to see. Grace Roseberry, seated in her
chair, little and lean, with her dull white complexion, with her
hard, threatening face, with her shrunken figure clad in its
plain and poor black garments, looked like a being of a lower
sphere, compared with Mercy Merrick, standing erect in her rich
silken dress; her tall, shapely figure towering over the little
creature before her; her grand head bent in graceful submission;
gentle, patient, beautiful; a woman whom it was a privilege to
look at and a distinction to admire. If a stranger had been told
that those two had played their parts in a romance of real
life--that one of them was really connected by the ties of
relationship with Lady Janet Roy, and that the other had
successfully attempted to personate her--he would inevitably, if
it had been left to him to guess which was which, have picked out
Grace as the counterfeit and Mercy as the true woman.
<P>
Grace broke the silence. She had waited to open her lips until
she had eyed her conquered victim all over, with disdainfully
minute attention, from head to foot
<P>
"Stand there. I like to look at you," she said, speaking with a
spiteful relish of her own cruel words. "It's no use fainting
this time. You have not got Lady Janet Roy to bring you to. There
are no gentlemen here to-day to pity you and pick you up. Mercy
Merrick, I have got you at last. Thank God, my turn has come! You
can't escape me now!"
<P>
All the littleness of heart and mind which had first shown itself
in Grace at the meeting in the cottage, when Mercy told the sad
story of her life, now revealed itself once more. The woman who
in those past times. had felt no impulse to take a suffering and
a penitent fellow-creature by the hand was the same woman who
could feel no pity, who could spare no insolence of triumph, now.
Mercy's sweet voice answered her patiently, in low, pleading
tones.
<P>
"I have not avoided you," she said. "I would have gone to you of
my own accord if I had known that you were here. It is my
heartfelt wish to own that I have sinned against you, and to make
all the atonement that I can. I am too anxious to deserve your
forgiveness to have any fear of seeing you."
<P>
Conciliatory as the reply was, it was spoken with a simple and
modest dignity of manner which roused Grace Roseberry to fury.
<P>
"How dare you speak to me as if you were any equal?" she burst
out. "You stand there and answer me as if you had your right and
your place in this house. You audacious woman! _I_ have my right
and my place here--and what am I obliged to do? I am obliged to
hang about in the grounds, and fly from the sight of the
servants, and hide like a thief, and wait like a beggar, and all
for what? For the chance of having a word with _you_. Yes! you,
madam! with the air of the Refuge and the dirt of the streets on
you!"
<P>
Mercy's head sank lower; her hand trembled as it held by the back
of the chair.
<P>
It was hard to bear the reiterated insults heaped on her, but
Julian's influence still made itself felt. She answered as
patiently as ever.
<P>
"If it is your pleasure to use hard words to me," she said, "I
have no right to resent them."
<P>
"You have no right to anything!" Grace retorted. "You have no
right to the gown on your back. Look at yourself, and look at
Me!" Her eyes traveled with a tigerish stare over Mercy's costly
silk dress. "Who gave you that dress? who gave you those jewels?
I know! Lady Janet gave them to Grace Roseberry. Are _you_ Grace
Roseberry? That dress is mine. Take off your bracelets and your
brooch. They were meant for me."
<P>
"You may soon have the m, Miss Roseberry. They will not be in my
possession many hours longer."
<P>
"What do you mean?"
<P>
"However badly you may use me, it is my duty to undo the harm
that I have done. I am bound to do you justice--I am determined
to confess the truth."
<P>
Grace smiled scornfully.
<P>
"You confess!" she said. "Do you think I am fool enough to
believe that? You are one shameful brazen lie from head to foot!
Are _you_ the woman to give up your silks and your jewels, and
your position in this house, and to go back to the Refuge of your
own accord? Not you-- not you!"
<P>
A first faint flush of color showed itself, stealing slowly over
Mercy's face; but she still held resolutely by the good influence
which Julian had left behind him. She could still say to herself,
"Anything rather than disappoint Julian Gray." Sustained by the
courage which _he_ had called to life in her, she submitted to
her martyrdom as bravely as ever. But there was an ominous change
in her now: she could only submit in silence; she could no longer
trust herself to answer.
<P>
The mute endurance in her face additionally exasperated Grace
Roseberry.
<P>
"_You_ won't confess," she went on. "You have had a week to
confess in, and you have not done it yet. No, no! you are of the
sort that cheat and lie to the last. I am glad of it; I shall
have the joy of exposing you myself before the whole house. I
shall be the blessed means of casting you back on the streets.
Oh! it will be almost worth all I have gone through to see you
with a policeman's hand on your arm, and the mob pointing at you
and mocking you on your way to jail!"
<P>
This time the sting struck deep; the outrage was beyond
endurance. Mercy gave the woman who had again and again
deliberately insulted her a first warning.
<P>
"Miss Roseberry," she said, "I have borne without a murmur the
bitterest words you could say to me. Spare me any more insults.
Indeed, indeed, I am eager to restore you to your just rights.
With my whole heart I say it to you--I am resolved to confess
everything!"
<P>
She spoke with trembling earnestness of tone. Grace listened with
a hard smile of incredulity and a hard look of contempt.
<P>
"You are not far from the bell," she said; "ring it."
<P>
Mercy looked at her in speechless surprise.
<P>
"You are a perfect picture of repentance--you are dying to own
the truth," pursued the other, satirically. "Own it before
everybody, and own it at once. Call in Lady Janet--call in Mr.
Gray and Mr. Holmcroft--call in the servants. Go down on your
knees and acknowledge yourself an impostor before them all. Then
I will believe you--not before."
<P>
"Don't, don't turn me against you!" cried Mercy, entreatingly.
<P>
"What do I care whether you are against me or not?"
<P>
"Don't--for your own sake, don't go on provoking me much longer!"
<P>
"For my own sake? You insolent creature! Do you mean to threaten
me?"
<P>
With a last desperate effort, her heart beating faster and
faster, the blood burning hotter and hotter in her cheeks, Mercy
still controlled herself.
<P>
"Have some compassion on me!" she pleaded. "Badly as I have
behaved to you, I am still a woman like yourself. I can't face
the shame of acknowledging what I have done before the whole
house. Lady Janet treats me like a daughter; Mr. Holmcroft has
engaged himself to marry me. I can't tell Lady Janet and Mr.
Holmcroft to their faces that I have cheated them out of their
love. But they shall know it, for all that. I can, and will,
before I rest to-night, tell the whole truth to Mr. Julian Gray."
<P>
Grace burst out laughing. "Aha!" she exclaimed, with a cynical
outburst of gayety. "Now we have come to it at last!"
<P>
"Take care!" said Mercy. "Take care!"
<P>
"Mr. Julian Gray! I was behind the billiard-room door--I saw you
coax Mr. Julian Gray to come in! confession loses all its
horrors, and becomes quite a luxury, with Mr. Julian Gray!"
<P>
"No more, Miss Roseberry! no more! For God's sake, don't put me
beside myself! You have tortured me enough already."
<P>
"You haven't been on the streets for nothing. You are a woman
with resources; you know the value of having two strings to your
bow. If Mr. Holmcroft fails you, you have got Mr. Julian Gray.
Ah! you sicken me. _I'll_ see that Mr. Holmcroft's eyes are
opened; he shall know what a woman he might have married but for
Me--"
<P>
She checked herself; the next refinement of insult remained
suspended on her lips.
<P>
The woman whom she had outraged suddenly advanced on her. Her
eyes, staring helplessly upward, saw Mercy Merrick's face, white
with the terrible anger which drives the blood back on the heart,
bending threateningly over her.
<P>
"'You will see that Mr. Holmcroft's eyes are opened,'" Mercy
slowly repeated; "'he shall know what a woman he might have
married but for you!'"
<P>
She paused, and followed those words by a question which struck a
creeping terror through Grace Roseberry, from the hair of her
head to the soles of her feet:
<P>
"_Who are you?_"
<P>
The suppressed fury of look and tone which accompanied that
question told, as no violence could have told it, that the limits
of Mercy's endurance had been found at last. In the guardian
angel's absence the evil genius had done its evil work. The
better nature which Julian Gray had brought to life sank,
poisoned by the vile venom of a womanly spiteful tongue. An easy
and a terrible means of avenging the outrages heaped on her was
within Mercy's reach, if she chose to take it. In the frenzy of
her indignation she never hesitated--she took it.
<P>
"Who are you?" she asked for the second time.
<P>
Grace roused herself and attempted to speak. Mercy stopped her
with a scornful gesture of her hand.
<P>
"I remember!" she went on, with the same fiercely suppressed
rage. "You are the madwoman from the German hospital who came
here a week ago. I am not afraid of you this time. Sit down and
rest yourself, Mercy Merrick "
<P>
Deliberately giving her that name to her face, Mercy turned from
her and took the chair which Grace had forbidden her to occupy
when the interview began. Grace started to her feet.
<P>
"What does this mean?" she asked.
<P>
"It means," answered Mercy, contemptuously, "that I recall every
word I said to you just now. It means that I am resolved to keep
my place in this house."
<P>
"Are you out of your senses?"
<P>
"You are not far from the bell. Ring it. Do what you asked _me_
to do. Call in the whole household, and ask them which of us is
mad--you or I."
<P>
"Mercy Merrick! you shall repent this to the last hour of your
life!"
<P>
Mercy rose again, and fixed her flashing eyes on the woman who
still defied her.
<P>
"I have had enough of you!" she said. "Leave the house while you
can leave it. Stay here, and I will send for Lady Janet Roy."
<P>
"You can't send for her! You daren't send for her!"
<P>
"I can and I dare. You have not a shadow of a proof against me. I
have got the papers; I am in possession of the place; I have
established myself in Lady Janet's confidence. I mean to deserve
your opinion of me--I will keep my dresses and my jewels and my
position in the house. I deny that I have done wrong. Society has
used me cruelly; I owe nothing to Society. I have a right to take
any advantage of it if I can. I deny that I have injured you. How
was I to know that you would come to life again? Have I degraded
your name and your character? I have done honor to both. I have
won everybody's liking and everybody's respect. Do you think Lady
Janet would have loved you as she loves me? Not she! I tell you
to your face I have filled the false position more creditably
than you could have filled the true one, and I mean to keep it. I
won't give up your name; I won't restore your character! Do your
worst; I defy you!"
<P>
She poured out those reckless words in one headlong flow which
defied interruption. There was no answering her until she was too
breathless to say more. Grace seized her opportunity the moment
it was within her reach.
<P>
"You defy me?" she returned, resolutely. "You won't defy me long.
I have written to Canada. My friends will speak for me."
<P>
"What of it, if they do? Your friends are strangers here. I am
Lady Janet's adopted daughter. Do you think she will believe your
friends? She will believe me. She will burn their letters if they
write. She will forbid th e house to them if they come. I shall
be Mrs. Horace Holmcroft in a week's time. Who can shake _my_
position? Who can injure Me?"
<P>
"Wait a little. You forget the matron at the Refuge."
<P>
"Find her, if you can. I never told you her name. I never told
you where the Refuge was."
<P>
"I will advertise your name, and find the matron in that way."
<P>
"Advertise in every newspaper in London. Do you think I gave a
stranger like you the name I really bore in the Refuge? I gave
you the name I assumed when I left England. No such person as
Mercy Merrick is known to the matron. No such person is known to
Mr. Holmcroft. He saw me at the French cottage while you were
senseless on the bed. I had my gray cloak on; neither he nor any
of them saw me in my nurse's dress. Inquiries have been made
about me on the Continent--and (I happen to know from the person
who made them) with no result. I am safe in your place; I am
known by your name. I am Grace Roseberry; and you are Mercy
Merrick. Disprove it, if you can!"
<P>
Summing up the unassailable security of her false position in
those closing words, Mercy pointed significantly to the
billiard-room door.
<P>
"You were hiding there, by your own confession," she said. "You
know your way out by that door. Will you leave the room?"
<P>
"I won't stir a step!"
<P>
Mercy walked to a side-table, and struck the bell placed on it.
<P>
At the same moment the billiard-room door opened. Julian Gray
appeared--returning from his unsuccessful search in the grounds.
<P>
He had barely crossed the threshold before the library door was
thrown open next by the servant posted in the room. The man drew
back respectfully, and gave admission to Lady Janet Roy. She was
followed by Horace Holmcroft with his mother's wedding present to
Mercy in his hand.
