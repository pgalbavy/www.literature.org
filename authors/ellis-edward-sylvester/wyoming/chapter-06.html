<p>The last few sentences that passed between Maggie Brainerd and
Golcher, the Tory, were heard, not only by Aunt Maggie, but by
the African servant.</p>

<p>This was due to the fact that the renegade in his excitement
forgot his caution, besides which the servant took occasion to
approach quite close to the two.</p>

<p>A very brief space of time was occupied in the conversation,
but brief as it was, Gravity was resolved that it should end.
He did not believe the declaration of Golcher that he had a party
of half-a-dozen Senecas within call, though it was possible that
he spoke the truth; but beyond a doubt the savages were so numerous
that a summons from the Tory would bring a number to the spot.</p>

<p>When, therefore, Jake adjusted his lips for a signal, Gravity
bounded forward and caught him by the throat.</p>

<p>"Don't be in a hurry to let out a yawp; if dere's any hollerin'
to be done, I'll take charge of it."</p>

<p>Golcher was as helpless as a child in the vise-like grip of those
iron fingers. He not only was unable to speak, but he found it
hard work to breathe.</p>

<p>Dropping his gun, he threw up both hands in a frantic effort
to loosen the clutch of those fingers.</p>

<p>"Why, Gravity," said the horrified Maggie; "I'm afraid you will
strangle him."</p>

<p>"And I'm afraid I <em>won't</em>," replied the African, putting
on a little more pressure.</p>

<p>Gravity, however, had no intention of proceeding to extremities,
though he might have found justification in so doing. He regulated
the pressure of his powerful right hand so that his victim, by
putting forth his best efforts, was able to get enough breath
to save himself.</p>

<p>"Young man," said Gravity, still holding him fast, "I don't think
dis am a healthy place for you; de best ting you can do am to
leave a little sooner dan possible."</p>

<p>"Let&mdash;me&mdash;let&mdash;me&mdash;go!" gurgled Golcher, still vainly trying
to free himself.</p>

<p>"I don't find dat I've got much use for you, so I'll let you
off, but de next time I lays hand onto you, you won't got off
so easy, and bein' as you am goin', I'll give you a boost."</p>

<p>To the delight of Aunt Peggy and the horror of Maggie Brainerd,
Gravity Gimp now wheeled the Tory around as though he were the
smallest child, and actually delivered a kick that lifted him
clear of the ground.</p>

<p>Not only once, but a second and third time was the indignity
repeated. Then, with a fierce effort, Golcher wrenched himself
free from the terrible fingers on the back of his neck, and, plunging
among the trees, vanished.</p>

<p>"Dat ar might come handy," said Gravity, picking up the loaded
musket which the panic-stricken Tory had left behind him and handing
it to Aunt Peggy, who asked, with a shudder:</p>

<p>"Do you s'pose I would touch it?"</p>

<p>"Let me have it," said Maggie; "I consider it fortunate that
we have two guns with us."</p>

<p>It was a good thing, indeed, for Maggie Brainerd, like many of
the brave maidens of a hundred years ago, was an expert in handling
the awkward weapons of our Revolutionary sires. With this at her
command, the chances were she would be heard from before the rising
of the morrow's sun.</p>

<p>But, if Jake Golcher was a mild enemy before, it was certain
he was now an unrelenting one. He would neglect no effort to avenge
himself upon all for the indignity he had received.</p>

<p>The African understood this, and he lost no time in getting away
from the spot with the utmost speed.</p>

<p>It was now about five o'clock in the afternoon, but it was the
eve of the Fourth of July, and the days were among the longest
in the year. It would not be dark for three hours, and who could
tell what might take place in that brief period?</p>

<p>Extremely good fortune had attended our friends thus far, but
it was not reasonable to expect it to continue without break.</p>

<p>The Tory was scarcely out of sight when Gravity started on a
trot down the bank, with the others close behind him.</p>

<p>"Bus'ness hab got to be pushed on de jump," he said, by way of
explanation; "we ain't done wid dat chap yet."</p>

<p>It was scarcely a minute later when he uttered an exclamation
of thankfulness, and those directly behind saw him stoop down
and, grasping the prow of a small flat-boat or scow, draw it from
beneath the undergrowth and push it into the water.</p>

<p>Such craft are not managed by oars, and Gimp handed a long pole
to Maggie, saying:</p>

<p>"Use dat de best ye kin, and don't lose no time gittin' to de
oder shore."</p>

<p>"But what are <em>you</em> going to do, Gravity?"</p>

<p>"I'se gwine wid you, but I'm afeard de boat won't hold us all,
and I'll hab to ride on de outside."</p>

<p>The Susquehanna is generally quite shallow along shore, and it
was necessary to push the scow several yards before the water
was found deep enough to float it with its load.</p>

<p>Gravity laid the two guns within the boat, and then, picking
up the <em>petite</em> Maggie, hastily carried her the short distance
and placed her dry-shod within, where she immediately assumed
control by means of the pole, which was a dozen feet in length.</p>

<p>Aunt Peggy and Eva were deposited beside her, by which time the
scow was sunk within a few inches of the gunwales: had the African
followed them, it would have been swamped.</p>

<p>As it was, the faithful negro was assuming great risk, for, as
have stated, he could not swim a stroke; but the circumstances
compelled such a course, and he did not hesitate.</p>

<p>"You see, folks," said he, as he began shoving the craft out
into the river; "dat dis wessel won't carry any more passengers."</p>

<p>Just then he stepped into a hole, which threw him forward on
his face with a loud splash, his head going under and nearly strangling
him. He was thoughtful enough to let go the boat, and recovered
himself with considerable effort, after causing a slight scream
from Eva, who was afraid he was going to drown.</p>

<p>The freedom from immediate danger ended when the fugitives put
out from the shore.</p>

<p>The suddenness of the defeat, pursuit, and massacre at Wyoming
prevented anything like the use of boats by the fleeing patriots,
who were beset by a merciless foe.</p>

<p>Had the scow been near where the main stream of fugitives were
rushing into the river and striving to reach the opposite bank,
the boat would not have kept afloat for a minute. It not only
would have been grasped by a score of the fugitives, but it would
have become the target for a number of rifles, which could hardly
have failed to kill all the occupants.</p>

<p>The stream rapidly deepened, and by and by Gimp was up to his
neck and moving rather gingerly, with his two broad hands resting
on the stern of the boat.</p>

<p>Maggie Brainerd stood erect in the craft, pole in hand, and,
bending slightly as she pressed the support against the river
bottom, held on until it was almost beyond her reach, when she
withdrew it, and, reaching forward, placed the lower end against
the bottom again, shoving the awkward vessel with as much skill
as the negro himself could have shown.</p>

<p>Aunt Peggy, as trim and erect as ever, was seated near the prow,
while Eva nestled at her feet with her head in her lap. When they
observed how deep the scow sank in the water, naturally enough
their fears were withdrawn from the great calamity, and centered
upon the one of drowning.</p>

<p>The ancient lady glanced askance at the turbid current, while
Eva turned pale and shivered more than once, as she looked affrightedly
at the hungry river that seemed to be climbing slowly up the frail
partition which kept it away from the fugitives.</p>

<p>Suddenly the feet of Gravity failed to reach bottom, and, sinking
down until his ears and mouth were scarcely above the surface,
he bore slightly upon the support and began threshing the water
with his feet, so that at a distance the scow looked as if it
had a steam screw at the stern driving it forward.</p>

<p>This rather cumbersome means of propulsion really accomplished
more than would be supposed. Despite the fact that the African
could not float himself, he managed his pedal extremities with
skill, and the boat was quick to respond.</p>
