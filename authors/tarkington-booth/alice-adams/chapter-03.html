<p>Mrs. Adams had remained in Alice's room, but her mood seemed
to have changed, during her daughter's little more than momentary
absence.</p>

<p>"What did he <em>SAY?" </em>she asked, quickly, and her tone
was hopeful.</p>

<p>"'Say?'" Alice repeated, impatiently. "Why, nothing. I didn't
let him. Really, mama, I think the best thing for you to do would
be to just keep out of his room, because I don't believe you can
go in there and not talk to him about it, and if you do talk we'll
never get him to do the right thing. Never!"</p>

<p>The mother's response was a grieving silence; she turned from
her daughter and walked to the door.</p>

<p>"Now, for goodness' sake!" Alice cried. "Don't go making tragedy
out of my offering you a little practical advice!"</p>

<p>"I'm not," Mrs. Adams gulped, halting. "I'm just&mdash;just going
to dust the downstairs, Alice." And with her face still averted,
she went out into the little hallway, closing the door behind
her. A moment later she could be heard descending the stairs,
the sound of her footsteps carrying somehow an effect of resignation.</p>

<p>Alice listened, sighed, and, breathing the words, "Oh, murder!"
turned to cheerier matters. She put on a little apple-green turban
with a dim gold band round it, and then, having shrouded the turban
in a white veil, which she kept pushed up above her forehead,
she got herself into a tan coat of soft cloth fashioned with rakish
severity. After that, having studied herself gravely in a long
glass, she took from one of the drawers of her dressing-table
a black leather card-case cornered in silver filigree, but found
it empty.</p>

<p>She opened another drawer wherein were two white pasteboard boxes
of cards, the one set showing simply "Miss Adams," the other engraved
in Gothic characters, "Miss Alys Tuttle Adams." The latter belonged
to Alice's "Alys" period&mdash;most girls go through it; and Alice
must have felt that she had graduated, for, after frowning thoughtfully
at the exhibit this morning, she took the box with its contents,
and let the white shower fall from her fingers into the waste-basket
beside her small desk. She replenished the card-case from the
"Miss Adams"  box; then, having found a pair of fresh white gloves,
she tucked an ivory-topped Malacca walking-stick under her arm
and set forth.</p>

<p>She went down the stairs, buttoning her gloves and still wearing
the frown with which she had put "Alys" finally out of her life.
She descended slowly, and paused on the lowest step, looking about
her with an expression that needed but a slight deepening to betoken
bitterness. Its connection with her dropping "Alys" forever was
slight, however.</p>

<p>The small frame house, about fifteen years old, was already inclining
to become a new Colonial relic. The Adamses had built it, moving
into it from the "Queen Anne" house they had rented until they
took this step in fashion. But fifteen years is a long time to
stand still in the midland country, even for a house, and this
one was lightly made, though the Adamses had not realized how
flimsily until they had lived in it for some time. "Solid, compact,
and convenient" were the instructions to the architect, and he
had made it compact successfully. Alice, pausing at the foot of
the stairway, was at the same time fairly in the "living-room,"
for the only separation between the "living room" and the hall
was a demarcation suggested to willing imaginations by a pair
of wooden columns painted white. These columns, pine under the
paint, were bruised and chipped at the base; one of them showed
a crack that threatened to become a split; the "hard-wood" floor
had become uneven; and in a corner the walls apparently failed
of solidity, where the wall-paper had declined to accompany some
staggerings of the plaster beneath it.</p>

<p>The furniture was in great part an accumulation begun with the
wedding gifts; though some of it was older, two large patent rocking-chairs
and a footstool having belonged to Mrs. Adams's mother in the
days of hard brown plush and veneer. For decoration there were
pictures and vases. Mrs. Adams had always been fond of vases,
she said, and every year her husband's Christmas present to her
was a vase of one sort or another&mdash;whatever the clerk showed him,
marked at about twelve or fourteen dollars. The pictures were
some of them etchings framed in gilt: Rheims, Canterbury, schooners
grouped against a wharf; and Alice could remember how, in her
childhood, her father sometimes pointed out the watery reflections
in this last as very fine. But it was a long time since he had
shown interest in such things&mdash;"or in anything much," as she thought.</p>

<p>Other pictures were two water-colours in baroque frames; one
being the Amalfi monk on a pergola wall, while the second was
a yard-wide display of iris blossoms, painted by Alice herself
at fourteen, as a birthday gift to her mother. Alice's glance
paused upon it now with no great pride, but showed more approval
of an enormous photograph of the Colosseum. This she thought of
as "the only good thing in the room"; it possessed and bestowed
distinction, she felt; and she did not regret having won her struggle
to get it hung in its conspicuous place of honour over the mantelpiece.
Formerly that place had been held for years by a steel-engraving,
an accurate representation of the Suspension Bridge at Niagara
Falls. It was almost as large as its successor, the "Colosseum,"
and it had been presented to Mr. Adams by colleagues in his department
at Lamb and Company's. Adams had shown some feeling when Alice
began to urge its removal to obscurity in the "upstairs hall";
he even resisted for several days after she had the "Colosseum"
charged to him, framed in oak, and sent to the house. She cheered
him up, of course, when he gave way; and her heart never misgave
her that there might be a doubt which of the two pictures was
the more dismaying.</p>

<p>Over the pictures, the vases, the old brown plush rocking-chairs
and the stool, over the three gilt chairs, over the new chintz-covered
easy chair and the gray velure sofa&mdash;over everything everywhere,
was the familiar coating of smoke grime. It had worked into every
fibre of the lace curtains, dingying them to an unpleasant gray;
it lay on the window-sills and it dimmed the glass panes; it covered
the walls, covered the ceiling, and was smeared darker and thicker
in all corners. Yet here was no fault of housewifery; the curse
could not be lifted, as the ingrained smudges permanent on the
once white woodwork proved. The grime was perpetually renewed;
scrubbing only ground it in.</p>

<p>This particular ugliness was small part of Alice's discontent,
for though the coating grew a little deeper each year she was
used to it. Moreover, she knew that she was not likely to find
anything better in a thousand miles, so long as she kept to cities,
and that none of her friends, however opulent, had any advantage
of her here. Indeed, throughout all the great soft-coal country,
people who consider themselves comparatively poor may find this
consolation: cleanliness has been added to the virtues and beatitudes
that money can not buy.</p>

<p>Alice brightened a little as she went forward to the front door,
and she brightened more when the spring breeze met her there.
Then all depression left her as she walked down the short brick
path to the sidewalk, looked up and down the street, and saw how
bravely the maple shade-trees, in spite of the black powder they
breathed, were flinging out their thousands of young green particles
overhead.</p>

<p>She turned north, treading the new little shadows on the pavement
briskly, and, having finished buttoning her gloves, swung down
her Malacca stick from under her arm to let it tap a more leisurely
accompaniment to her quick, short step. She had to step quickly
if she was to get anywhere; for the closeness of her skirt, in
spite of its little length, permitted no natural stride; but she
was pleased to be impeded, these brevities forming part of her
show of fashion.</p>

<p>Other pedestrians found them not without charm, though approval
may have been lacking here and there, and at the first crossing
Alice suffered what she might have accounted an actual injury,
had she allowed herself to be so sensitive. An elderly woman in
fussy black silk stood there, waiting for a streetcar; she was
all of a globular modelling, with a face patterned like a frost-bitten
peach; and that the approaching gracefulness was uncongenial she
naively made too evident. Her round, wan eyes seemed roused to
bitter life as they rose from the curved high heels of the buckled
slippers to the tight little skirt, and thence with startled ferocity
to the Malacca cane, which plainly appeared to her as a decoration
not more astounding than it was insulting.</p>

<p>Perceiving that the girl was bowing to her, the globular lady
hurriedly made shift to alter her injurious expression. "Good
morning, Mrs. Dowling," Alice said, gravely. Mrs. Dowling returned
the salutation with a smile as convincingly benevolent as the
ghastly smile upon a Santa Claus face; and then, while Alice passed
on, exploded toward her a single compacted breath through tightened
lips.</p>

<p>The sound was eloquently audible, though Mrs. Dowling remained
unaware that in this or any manner whatever she had shed a light
upon her thoughts; for it was her lifelong innocent conviction
that other people saw her only as she wished to be seen, and heard
from her only what she intended to be heard. At home it was always
her husband who pulled down the shades of their bedroom window.</p>

<p>Alice looked serious for a few moments after the little encounter,
then found some consolation in the behaviour of a gentleman of
forty or so who was coming toward her. Like Mrs. Dowling, he had
begun to show consciousness of Alice's approach while she was
yet afar off; but his tokens were of a kind pleasanter to her.
He was like Mrs. Dowling again, however, in his conception that
Alice would not realize the significance of what he did. He passed
his hand over his neck-scarf to see that it lay neatly to his
collar, smoothed a lapel of his coat, and adjusted his hat, seeming
to be preoccupied the while with problems that kept his eyes to
the pavement; then, as he came within a few feet of her, he looked
up, as in a surprised recognition almost dramatic, smiled winningly,
lifted his hat decisively, and carried it to the full arm's length.</p>

<p>Alice's response was all he could have asked. The cane in her
right hand stopped short in its swing, while her left hand moved
in a pretty gesture as if an impulse carried it toward the heart;
and she smiled, with her under lip caught suddenly between her
teeth. Months ago she had seen an actress use this smile in a
play, and it came perfectly to Alice now, without conscious direction,
it had been so well acquired; but the pretty hand's little impulse
toward the heart was an original bit all her own, on the spur
of the moment.</p>

<p>The gentleman went on, passing from her forward vision as he
replaced his hat. Of himself he was nothing to Alice, except for
the gracious circumstance that he had shown strong consciousness
of a pretty girl. He was middle-aged, substantial, a family man,
securely married; and Alice had with him one of those long acquaintances
that never become emphasized by so much as five minutes of talk;
yet for this inconsequent meeting she had enacted a little part
like a fragment in a pantomime of Spanish wooing.</p>

<p>It was not for him&mdash;not even to impress him, except as a messenger.
Alice was herself almost unaware of her thought, which was one
of the running thousands of her thoughts that took no deliberate
form in words. Nevertheless, she had it, and it was the impulse
of all her pretty bits of pantomime when she met other acquaintances
who made their appreciation visible, as this substantial gentleman
did. In Alice's unworded thought, he was to be thus encouraged
as in some measure a champion to speak well of her to the world;
but more than this: he was to tell some magnificent unknown bachelor
how wonderful, how mysterious, she was.</p>

<p>She hastened on gravely, a little stirred reciprocally with the
supposed stirrings in the breast of that shadowy ducal mate, who
must be somewhere "waiting," or perhaps already seeking her; for
she more often thought of herself as "waiting" while he sought
her; and sometimes this view of things became so definite that
it shaped into a murmur on her lips. "Waiting. Just waiting."
And she might add, "For him!" Then, being twenty-two, she was
apt to conclude the mystic interview by laughing at herself, though
not without a continued wistfulness.</p>

<p>She came to a group of small coloured children playing waywardly
in a puddle at the mouth of a muddy alley; and at sight of her
they gave over their pastime in order to stare. She smiled brilliantly
upon them, but they were too struck with wonder to comprehend
that the manifestation was friendly; and as Alice picked her way
in a little detour to keep from the mud, she heard one of them
say, "Lady got cane! Jeez'!"</p>

<p>She knew that many coloured children use impieties familiarly,
and she was not startled. She was disturbed, however, by an unfavourable
hint in the speaker's tone. He was six, probably, but the sting
of a criticism is not necessarily allayed by knowledge of its
ignoble source, and Alice had already begun to feel a slight uneasiness
about her cane. Mrs. Dowling's stare had been strikingly projected
at it; other women more than merely glanced, their brows and lips
contracting impulsively; and Alice was aware that one or two of
them frankly halted as soon as she had passed.</p>

<p>She had seen in several magazines pictures of ladies with canes,
and on that account she had bought this one, never questioning
that fashion is recognized, even in the provinces, as soon as
beheld. On the contrary, these staring women obviously failed
to realize that what they were being shown was not an eccentric
outburst, but the bright harbinger of an illustrious mode. Alice
had applied a bit of artificial pigment to her lips and cheeks
before she set forth this morning; she did not need it, having
a ready colour of her own, which now mounted high with annoyance.</p>

<p>Then a splendidly shining closed black automobile, with windows
of polished glass, came silently down the street toward her. Within
it, as in a luxurious little apartment, three comely ladies in
mourning sat and gossiped; but when they saw Alice they clutched
one another. They instantly recovered, bowing to her solemnly
as they were borne by, yet were not gone from her sight so swiftly
but the edge of her side glance caught a flash of teeth in mouths
suddenly opened, and the dark glisten of black gloves again clutching
to share mirth.</p>

<p>The colour that outdid the rouge on Alice's cheek extended its
area and grew warmer as she realized how all too cordial had been
her nod and smile to these humorous ladies. But in their identity
lay a significance causing her a sharper smart, for they were
of the family of that Lamb, chief of Lamb and Company, who had
employed her father since before she was born.</p>

<p>"And know his salary! They'd be <em>SURE </em>to find out about
that!" was her thought, coupled with another bitter one to the
effect that they had probably made instantaneous financial estimates
of what she wore though certainly her walking-stick had most fed
their hilarity.</p>

<p>She tucked it under her arm, not swinging it again; and her breath
became quick and irregular as emotion beset her. She had been
enjoying her walk, but within the space of the few blocks she
had gone since she met the substantial gentleman, she found that
more than the walk was spoiled: suddenly her life seemed to be
spoiled, too; though she did not view the ruin with complaisance.
These Lamb women thought her and her cane ridiculous, did they?
she said to herself. That was their parvenu blood: to think because
a girl's father worked for their grandfather she had no right
to be rather striking in style, especially when the striking <em>WAS
</em>her style. Probably all the other girls and women would agree
with them and would laugh at her when they got together, and,
what might be fatal, would try to make all the men think her a
silly pretender. Men were just like sheep, and nothing was easier
than for women to set up as shepherds and pen them in a fold.
"To keep out outsiders," Alice thought. "And make 'em believe
I AM an outsider. What's the use of living?"</p>

<p>All seemed lost when a trim young man appeared, striding out
of a cross-street not far before her, and, turning at the corner,
came toward her. Visibly, he slackened his gait to lengthen the
time of his approach, and, as he was a stranger to her, no motive
could be ascribed to him other than a wish to have a longer time
to look at her.</p>

<p>She lifted a pretty hand to a pin at her throat, bit her lip&mdash;not
with the smile, but mysteriously&mdash;and at the last instant before
her shadow touched the stranger, let her eyes gravely meet his.
A moment later, having arrived before the house which was her
destination, she halted at the entrance to a driveway leading
through fine lawns to the intentionally important mansion. It
was a pleasant and impressive place to be seen entering, but Alice
did not enter at once. She paused, examining a tiny bit of mortar
which the masons had forgotten to scrape from a brick in one of
the massive gate-posts. She frowned at this tiny defacement, and
with an air of annoyance scraped it away, using the ferrule of
her cane an act of fastidious proprietorship. If any one had looked
back over his shoulder he would not have doubted that she lived
there.</p>

<p>Alice did not turn to see whether anything of the sort happened
or not, but she may have surmised that it did. At all events,
it was with an invigorated step that she left the gateway behind
her and went cheerfully up the drive to the house of her friend
Mildred.</p>
