<p>At four o'clock in the morning, the streets were almost empty. A few
fruit and vegetable-carts were making their way between the demolished
houses and the shattered pavements. But from a neighbouring avenue
there emerged a little cavalcade in which Simon immediately
recognized, at the head of the party, astride a monstrous big horse,
Old Sandstone, wearing his rusty top-hat, with the skirts of his black
frock-coat overflowing either side of a saddle with bulging
saddle-bags.
</p><p>Next came Antonio, <u>alias</u> Lynx-Eye, likewise mounted; then a third
horseman, perched like the others behind heavy saddle-bags; and lastly
three persons on foot, one of whom held the bridle of a fourth horse.
The three pedestrians had brick-red faces and long hair and were
dressed in the same style as Lynx-Eye, in soft leggings with leather
fringes, velveteen breeches, flannel girdles, wide-brimmed felt hats,
with gaudy ribbons: in short, a heterogeneous, picturesque band, with
many-coloured accoutrements, in which the adornments dear to circus
cow-boys were displayed side by side with those of one of Fenimore
Cooper's Redskins, or one of Gustave Aymard's scouts. They carried
rifles slung across their shoulders and revolvers and daggers in their
belts.
</p><p>"What the deuce!" exclaimed Simon. "Why, this is a martial progress!
Are we going among savages?"
</p><p>"We are going into a country," replied Antonio, gravely, "Where there
are no inhabitants, no inns, no victuals, but where there are already
visitors as dangerous as beasts of prey, which is why we have to carry
two days' provisions and two days' supply of oats and compressed
fodder for our mounts. This, then, is our escort. These are the
brothers Mazzani, the elder and the younger. This is Forsetta. Here is
Mr. Sandstone. Here, on horseback, is one of my personal friends. And
here, lastly, for you, is Orlando III. a half-breed by Gracious out of
Chiquita."
</p><p>And, at a sign from the Indian, a noble animal was led forward, lean,
sinewy and nervous, standing very high on its long legs.
</p><p>Simon mounted, much amused:
</p><p>"And you, my dear professor?" he said to Old Sandstone: "Are you one
of the party?"
</p><p>"I lost my train," said the old fellow, "and on returning to the hotel
I met Lynx-Eye, who recruited me. I represent science and am entrusted
with the geological, geographical, crographical, stratigraphical,
palaeontological and other observations. I shall have plenty to do."
</p><p>"Forward, then!" commanded Simon. And, taking the lead with Antonio,
he at once said, "Now tell me about your companions. And you,
Lynx-Eye, where do <u>you</u> hail from? After all, if there are still a
few specimens of Redskins left, they're not out for a good time on the
highways of Europe. Confess that you are, all of you, made up and
disguised."
</p><p>"They are no more made up than I am," said Antonio. "We come from the
other side. For my part, I am the grandson of one of the last
remaining Indian chiefs, Long Carbine who ran away with the little
daughter of a Canadian trapper. My mother was a Mexican. You see that,
though there's a mixture, our origins are beyond dispute."
</p><p>"But afterwards, Lynx-Eye? What has happened afterwards? I'm not
aware that the British government provides for the descendants of the
Sioux or Mohicans?"
</p><p>"There are other concerns besides the British government," said the
Indian.
</p><p>"What do you mean?"
</p><p>"I mean there are concerns which are interested in keeping us going."
</p><p>"Really? What are they?"
</p><p>"The cinema-firms."
</p><p>Simon struck his hand against his forehead:
</p><p>"What an idiot I am! Why didn't I think of that? Then you are. . . ."
</p><p>"Simply film actors from the Far West, the Prairies and the Mexican
frontier."
</p><p>"That's it! That's it!" cried Simon. "I have seen you on the screen,
haven't I? And I've seen . . . hold on. I remember now, I've seen the
fair Dolores also, haven't I? But what are you doing in Europe?"
</p><p>"An English company sent for me and I engaged a few friends over
there, who, like myself, are the very mixed descendants of Red
Indians, Mexicans and Spaniards. Now, M. Dubosc, one of these friends
of mine--the best, for I can't say much for the others, and I advise
you, if the occasion should arise, to be very careful with Forsetta
and the Mazzani brothers--the best, M. Dubosc, was murdered the day
before yesterday by Rolleston. I loved Badiarinos as a son loves his
father. I have sworn to avenge him. There you have it."
</p><p>"Lynx-Eye, grandson of Long Carbine," said Simon, "we will avenge your
friend, but Rolleston is not guilty of his murder. . . ."
</p><p>For a man like Simon, to whom practical navigation, in the air or on
the sea, had given a keen sense of direction and who, moreover, kept
on consulting his compass, it was child's play to reach a spot whose
latitude and longitude he was able to determine more or less exactly.
He galloped due south, after making the calculation that, if nothing
forced them to turn aside, they would have to cover a distance of
about thirty miles.
</p><p>Almost immediately, the little troop, leaving on their left the line
of ridges which Simon had followed a few days before, struck off
across a series of rather lower sand-hills, which nevertheless were
high enough to overlook immense beds of yellow mud, covered with a
network of small, winding streams. This was the slime deposited by the
rivers of the coast and carried out to sea by the tides and currents.
</p><p>"Grand alluvial soil," said Old Sandstone. "The water will form
channels for itself. The sandy parts will be absorbed."
</p><p>"In five years," said Simon, "we shall see herds of cattle grazing on
the very bed of the sea; and five years later there will be
railway-lines across it and palatial hotels standing in the middle."
</p><p>"Perhaps; but, for the moment the situation is not promising,"
observed the old professor. "Look here, look at this newspaper,
published yesterday evening. In both France and England the disorder
is complete. Social and economic life has been suddenly paralyzed. No
more public services. Letters and telegrams may or may not be
delivered. Nothing definite is known; and people are saying the most
extraordinary things. The cases of insanity and suicide, it seems, are
numberless. And the crimes! Isolated crimes, crimes committed by gangs
of criminals, riots, shops and churches pillaged wholesale. It's an
absolute chaos; we are back in the dark ages."
</p><p>The stratum of mud, formerly swept by the ground-wash, was not very
thick; and they were able, time after time, to venture upon it without
the least danger. For that matter, it was already indented with
footprints, which also marked the still moist sand of the hills. They
passed the hulk of a steamboat round which some people had established
a sort of camp. Some were poking about the hull. Others were entering
by the battered funnel, or demolishing the woodwork with hammers, or
breaking open cases of more or less intact provisions. Women of the
people, women in rags and tatters, wearing the look of hunted animals,
sat on pieces of timber, waiting. Children ran about, playing; and
already, marking a first attempt at communal life, a pedlar was moving
through the crowd with a keg of beer on his back, while two girls,
installed behind a tottering bar, were selling tea and whisky.
</p><p>Farther on, they saw a second camp and, in all directions, men
prowling about, solitary individuals, who, like themselves, were
reconnoitring.
</p><p>"Capital!" cried Simon. "The prairie lies stretched before us, with
all its mysteries and all its lurking dangers. Here we are on the
war-path; and the man who leads us is a Red Indian chief."
</p><p>After they had trotted for two hours at a brisk pace, the prairie was
represented by undulating plains, in which sand and mud alternated in
equal proportions and in which hesitating streams of no great depth
were seeking a favourable bed. Over it hung a low, thick, stationary
fog, apparently as solid as a ceiling.
</p><p>"What a miracle, my dear Old Sandstone!" cried Simon, while they were
following a long ribbon of fine gravel which stretched before them,
like a sunken path winding through the greensward of a park. "What a
miracle, an adventure of this sort! A horrible adventure, certainly; a
disaster causing superhuman suffering, death and mourning; but
extraordinary adventure, the finest that a man of my age could dream
of. It's all so prodigious!"
</p><p>"Prodigious, indeed!" said Old Sandstone, who, faithful to his
mission, was pursuing his scientific investigations. "Prodigious!
Thus, the presence of this gravel in this place constitutes one of the
unprecedented events of which you are speaking. And then look at that
bank of great golden fish lying over there, with their upturned
bellies. . . ."
</p><p>"Yes, yes, professor," replied Simon. "It's impossible that such an
upheaval should not usher in a new age! If I look at the future as
people sometimes look at a landscape, with my eyes half-closed, I can
see . . . heavens, what don't I see! . . . What don't I imagine! . . .
What a tragedy of folly, passion, hatred, love, violence, and noble
efforts! We are entering upon one of those periods in which men are
full to overflowing of energy, in which the will goes to the head like
a generous wine!"
</p><p>The young man's enthusiasm ended by annoying Old Sandstone, who moved
away from his expansive companion, grumbling:
</p><p>"Simon, the memory of Fenimore Cooper is making you lose your head.
You're getting too talkative, my son."
</p><p>Simon was not losing his head, but he was possessed by a burning fever
and, after the hours which he had experienced two days before, was
quivering with impatience to return, so to speak, to the world of
abnormal actions.
</p><p>In point of fact, Isabel's image was before him in all his thoughts
and in all his dreams. He paid hardly any attention to the precise aim
of his expedition or to the campaign which they were undertaking to
recover a certain object. The precious miniature was hidden in the rug
where he was sure to find it. Rolleston? His gang of ruffians? Men
stabbed in the back? A pack of inventions and nightmares! The only
reality was Isabel. The only aim before him was to distinguish himself
as a knight fighting for the love of his lady.
</p><p>Meanwhile there were no longer any camps around wrecks, nor parties of
people searching for valuables, but only individual prowlers and very
few of these, as though most of the people were afraid to go too far
from the coast. The surface was becoming more broken, consisting, no
doubt, as Old Sandstone explained, of former sand banks which the
seismic disturbances had shaken down and mixed with the underlying
sedimentary strata. They had to go out of their way to avoid not
shattered rocks indeed, nor compact cliffs, but raised tracts of
ground that had not yet assumed those definite forms in which we
perceive the action of time, of time which separates, classifies and
discriminates, which organizes chaos and gives it a durable aspect.
</p><p>They crossed a sheet of perfectly clear water, contained within a
circle of low hills. The bottom was carpeted with little white
pebbles. Then they descended, between two very high banks of mud, a
narrow gully through which the water trickled in slender cascades. As
they emerged from this gully, the Indian's horse shied. A man was
kneeling on the ground, groaning and writhing in pain, his face
covered with blood. Another man lay near him, his white face turned to
the sky.
</p><p>Antonio and Simon at once sprang from their horses. When the wounded
man raised his head, Simon cried:
</p><p>"Why, I know him . . . it's Williams, Lord Bakefield's secretary. And
I know the other too: it's Charles, the valet. They have been
attacked. What is it, Williams? You know me, Simon Dubosc."
</p><p>The man could hardly speak. He spluttered:
</p><p>"Bakefield . . . Lord Bakefield. . . ."
</p><p>"Come, Williams, tell me what happened?"
</p><p>"Yesterday . . . yesterday. . . ." replied the secretary.
</p><p>"Yes, yesterday you were attacked. By whom?"
</p><p>"Rolleston. . . ."
</p><p>Simon started:
</p><p>"Rolleston! Did he kill Charles?"
</p><p>"Yes. . . . I. . . . I was wounded. . . . I have been calling out all
night. And, just now, another man. . . ."
</p><p>Antonio put a question:
</p><p>"You were attacked again, were you not, by some thief who wanted to
rob you. . . . And, when he heard us coming, he too stabbed you and
took to his heels? Then he is not far away?"
</p><p>"There . . . there," stammered Williams, trying to stretch out his
arm.
</p><p>The Indian pointed to footsteps which led to the left, up the slope of
the hills:
</p><p>"There's the trail," he said.
</p><p>"I'll follow it up," said Simon, leaping into the saddle.
</p><p>The Indian protested:
</p><p>"What's the use?"
</p><p>"Use? The scoundrel must be punished!"
</p><p>Simon went off at a gallop, followed by one of the Indian's
companions, the one who rode the fourth horse and whose name he did
not know. Almost immediately, at five hundred yards ahead, on the
ridge of the hills, a man rose from the cover of some blocks of stone
and made away at the top of his speed.
</p><p>Two minutes later, Simon reached these blocks and exclaimed:
</p><p>"I see him! He's going around the lake which we crossed. Let's make
straight for him."
</p><p>He descended the farther slope and forced his horse into the water,
which, at this point, covered a layer of mud so deep that the two
riders had some difficulty in getting clear of it. When they reached
the opposite shore, the fugitive, seeing that there were only two of
them, turned round, threw up his rifle and covered them:
</p><p>"Halt," he commanded, "or I fire!"
</p><p>Simon was going too fast and could not pull up.
</p><p>At the moment when the shot rang, he was at most twenty yards from the
murderer. But another rider had leapt between them and was holding his
horse, reared on its hind legs, like a rampart in front of Simon. The
animal was hit in the belly and fell.
</p><p>"Thanks, old chap, you've saved my life!" cried Simon, abandoning the
pursuit and dismounting to succour the other, who was in an awkward
position, jammed under his horse and in danger of being kicked by the
dying brute.
</p><p>Nevertheless, when Simon endeavoured to extricate him, the fallen
rider did nothing to assist his efforts; and, after releasing him with
some difficulty, he perceived that the man had fainted.
</p><p>"That's odd!" thought Simon. "Those fellows don't usually faint over a
fall from a horse!"
</p><p>He knelt down beside the other and, seeing that his breathing was
embarrassed, undid the first few buttons of his shirt and uncovered
the upper part of his chest. He was stupefied and for the first time
looked at his companion, who hitherto, in the shadow of his
broad-brimmed hat, had seemed to him like the other Indians of the
escort. The hat had fallen off. Quickly, Simon lifted an orange silk
kerchief bound round the head and neck of the supposed Red Indian,
whose hair escaped from it in thick black curls.
</p><p>"The girl!" he muttered. "Dolores!"
</p><p>Once more he had before his eyes the vision of radiant beauty to which
his mind had recurred several times during the past two days, though
no emotion mingled with his admiration. He was so far from any thought
of concealing this admiration that the young woman, on recovering
consciousness, surprised it in his gaze. She smiled:
</p><p>"I'm all right now!" she said. "I was only stunned."
</p><p>"You're not in pain?"
</p><p>"No. I am used to accidents. I've often had to fall from my horse for
the films. . . . This one's dead, isn't he? Poor creature!"
</p><p>"You've saved my life," said Simon.
</p><p>"We're quits," she replied.
</p><p>Her expression was grave and harmonized with her slightly austere
features. Her's was one of those beautiful faces which are peculiarly
disconcerting by reason of the contrasts which they present, being at
once passionate and chaste, noble and sensuous, pensive and enticing.
</p><p>Simon asked her, point blank:
</p><p>"Was it you who came to my room yesterday, first in broad daylight and
afterwards at night?"
</p><p>She blushed, but admitted:
</p><p>"Yes, it was I."
</p><p>And, at a movement of Simon's, she added:
</p><p>"I felt uneasy. People were being killed, in town and in the hotel. I
had to watch over you, who had saved my life."
</p><p>"I thank you," he said once more.
</p><p>"Don't thank me. I have been doing things in spite of myself . . .
these last two days. You seem to me so different from other men! . . .
But I ought not to speak to you like this. Don't be vexed with me!"
</p><p>Simon held out his hand to her, when suddenly she assumed a listening
attitude and then, after a moment's attention, straightened her
clothes, hid her hair beneath her kerchief and put on her hat.
</p><p>"It's Antonio," she said, in a different tone. "He must have heard the
firing. Don't let him know that you recognized me, will you?"
</p><p>"Why?" asked Simon, in surprise.
</p><p>She replied, in some embarrassment:
</p><p>"It's better. . . . Antonio is very masterful. He forbade me to come.
It was only when he was naming the three Indians of the escort that he
recognized me; I had taken the fourth Indian's horse. . . . So, you
see. . . ."
</p><p>She did not complete her sentence. A horseman had made his appearance
on the ridge. When he came up to them, Dolores had unfastened her
saddle-bags and was strapping them to the saddle of Simon's horse.
Antonio asked no questions. There was no exchange of explanations.
With a glance he reconstructed the scene, examined the dead animal
and, addressing the young woman by her name, perhaps to show that he
was not taken in, said:
</p><p>"Have my horse, Dolores."
</p><p>Was it the mere familiarity of a comrade, or that of a man who wishes,
in the presence of another man, to assert his rights or his
pretentions to a woman? His tone was not imperious, but Simon
surprised the glance that flashed anger on the one side and defiance
on the other. However, he paid little attention, being much less
anxious to discover the private motives which actuated Dolores and
Antonio than to elucidate the problem arising from his meeting with
Lord Bakefield's secretary.
</p><p>"Did Williams say anything?" he asked Antonio, who was beside him.
</p><p>"No, he died without speaking."
</p><p>"Oh! He's dead! . . . And you discovered nothing?"
</p><p>"Nothing."
</p><p>"Then what do you think? Were Williams and Charles sent to the <u>Queen
Mary</u> by Lord Bakefield and his daughter and were they to find me and
help me in my search? Or did they go on their own account?"
</p><p>They soon joined the three pedestrians of the escort, to whom Old
Sandstone, with a cluster of shells in his hand, was giving a
geological lesson. The three pedestrians were asleep.
</p><p>"I'm going ahead," said Antonio to Simon. "Our horses need a rest. In
an hour's time, set out along the track of the white pebbles which I
shall drop as I go. You can ride at a trot. My three comrades are good
runners."
</p><p>He had already gone some paces, when he returned and, drawing Simon
aside, looked him straight in the eyes and said:
</p><p>"Be on your guard with Dolores, M. Dubosc. She is one of these women
of whom it is wise to beware. I have seen many a man lose his head
over her."
</p><p>Simon smiled and could not refrain from saying:
</p><p>"Perhaps Lynx-Eye is one of them?"
</p><p>The Indian repeated:
</p><p>"Be on your guard, M. Dubosc!"
</p><p>And with these words he went his way. They seemed to sum up all that
he thought of Dolores.
</p><p>Simon ate, stretched himself out on the ground and smoked some
cigarettes. Sitting on the sand, Dolores unpicked a few seams of the
wide trousers which she was wearing and arranged them in such a
fashion that they might have been taken for a skirt.
</p><p>An hour later, as Simon was making ready to start, his attention was
attracted by a sound of voices. At some little distance, Dolores and
one of the three Indians were standing face to face and disputing in a
language which Simon did not understand, while the brothers Mazzani
were watching them and grinning.
</p><p>Dolores' arms were folded across her breast; she stood motionless and
scornful. The man, on the contrary, was gesticulating, with a snarling
face and glittering eyes. Suddenly he took both Dolores' arms and,
drawing her close to him, sought her lips.
</p><p>Simon leapt to his feet. But there was no need of intervention; the
Indian had at once recoiled, pricked at the throat by a dagger which
Dolores held before her, the handle pressed against her bosom, the
point threatening her adversary.
</p><p>The incident was not followed by any sort of explanation. The Indian
made off, grumbling. Old Sandstone, who had seen nothing, tackled
Simon on the subject of his geological fault; and Simon merely said to
himself, as Dolores tightened her saddle-girth:
</p><p>"What the deuce are all these people up to?"
</p><p>He did not waste time in seeking for an answer to the question.
</p><p>The little band did not overtake Antonio until three hours later, when
he was stooping over the ground, examining some footprints.
</p><p>"There you are," he said to Simon, straightening his back. "I have
made out thirteen distinct tracks, left by people who certainly were
not travelling together. In addition to these thirteen highwaymen--for
a man has to be a pretty tough lot to risk the journey--there are two
parties ahead of us: first, a party of four horsemen and then, walking
behind them--how many hours later I couldn't say--a party of seven on
foot, forming Rolleston's gang. Look, here's the print of the
patterned rubber soles."
</p><p>"Yes, yes," said Simon, recognizing the footprint which he had seen
two days before. "And what do you conclude?"
</p><p>"I conclude that Rolleston, as we knew, is in it and that all these
gentry, separate prowlers and parties, are making for the <u>Queen
Mary</u>, the last large Channel boat sunk and the nearest to this part
of the coast. Think, what a scoop for marauders!"
</p><p>"Let's push on!" cried the young man, who was now uneasy at the
thought that he might fail in the mission which Isabel had allotted
to him.
</p><p>One by one, five other tracks coming from the north--from Eastbourne,
the Indian thought--joined the first. In the end they made such an
intricate tangle that Antonio had to give up counting them. However,
the footprints of the rubber soles and those of the four horses
continued to appear in places.
</p><p>They marched on for some time. The landscape showed little variety,
revealing sandy plains and hills, stretches of mud, rivers and pools,
of water left by the sea and filled with fish which had taken refuge
there. It was all monotonous, without beauty or majesty, but strange,
as anything that has never been seen before or anything that is
shapeless must needs be strange.
</p><p>"We are getting near," said Simon.
</p><p>"Yes," said the Indian, "the tracks are coming in from all directions;
and here even are marauders returning northwards, laden with their
swag."
</p><p>It was now four in the afternoon. Not a rift was visible in the
ceiling of motionless clouds. Rain fell in great, heavy drops. For
the first time they heard the overhead roar of an aeroplane flying
above the insuperable obstacle. . . . They followed a depression in
the ground, succeeded by hills. And suddenly a bulky object rose
before them. It was the <u>Queen Mary</u>. She was bent in two, almost like
a broken toy. And nothing was more lamentable, nothing gave a more
dismal impression of ruin and destruction than those two lifeless
halves of a once so powerful thing.
</p><p>There was no one near the wreck.
</p><p>Simon experienced an extreme emotion on standing before what was left
of the big boat which he had seen wrecked so terribly. He could not
approach it without that sort of pious horror which one would feel on
entering a mighty tomb haunted by the shades of those whom we once
knew. He thought of the three clergymen and the French family and the
captain; and he shuddered at remembering the moment when, with all the
strength of his will and all the imperious power of his love, he had
dragged Isabel towards the abyss.
</p><p>A halt was called. Simon left his horse with the Indians and went
forward, accompanied by Antonio. He ran down the steep slope which the
stern of the vessel had hollowed in the sand, gripped with both hands
a rope which hung beside the rudder and in a few seconds, with the
assistance of his feet and knees, reached the stern rail.
</p><p>Although the deck had listed violently to starboard and a sticky mud
was oozing through the planking, he ran to the spot where Isabel and
he had sat. The bench had been torn away, but the iron supports were
still standing and the rug which she had slung to one of them was
there, shrunk, heavy with the water dripping from it and packed, as
before the shipwreck, in its straps, which were untouched.
</p><p>Simon thrust his hand between the wet folds of the rug, as he had seen
Isabel do. Not feeling anything, he tried to unfasten the straps, but
the leather had swollen and the ends were jammed in the buckles. Then
he took his knife, cut the straps and unrolled the rug. The miniature
in its pearl setting was gone.
</p><p>In its place, fixed with a safety-pin, was a sheet of paper.
</p><p>He unfolded it. On it were these hastily-written words, which Isabel
evidently intended for him:
</p><pre>
      "I was hoping to see you. Haven't you received my
      letter? We have spent the night here--in an absolute
      hell on earth! and we are just leaving. I am uneasy. I
      feel that some one is prowling around us. Why are not
      you here?"</pre>
<p>"Oh!" Simon stammered, "it's incredible!"
</p><p>He showed the note to Antonio, who had joined him, and at once added:
</p><p>"Miss Bakefield! . . . She spent the night here . . . with her father
. . . and they have gone! But where? How are we to save them from so
many lurking dangers?"
</p><p>The Indian read the letter and said, slowly:
</p><p>"They have not gone back north. I should have seen their tracks."
</p><p>"Then. . . . ?"
</p><p>"Then. . . . I don't know."
</p><p>"But this is awful! See, Antonio, think of all that is threatening
them . . . of Rolleston pursuing them! Think of this wild country,
swarming with highwaymen and foot-pads! . . . It's horrible,
horrible!"
