<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Patrice, in his bedroom at the home, was unable to sleep that night. He
had a continual waking sensation of being oppressed and hunted down, as
though he were suffering the terrors of some monstrous nightmare. He had
an impression that the frantic series of events in which he was playing
the combined parts of a bewildered spectator and a helpless actor would
never cease so long as he tried to rest; that, on the contrary, they
would rage with greater violence and intensity. The leave-taking of the
husband and wife did not put an end, even momentarily, to the dangers
incurred by Coralie. Fresh perils arose on every side; and Patrice
Belval confessed himself incapable of foreseeing and still more of
allaying them.
</p><p>After lying awake for two hours, he switched on his electric light and
began hurriedly to write down the story of the past twelve hours. He
hoped in this way to some small extent to unravel the tangled knot.
</p><p>At six o'clock he went and roused Ya-Bon and brought him back with him.
Then, standing in front of the astonished negro, he crossed his arms and
exclaimed:
</p><p>"So you consider that your job is over! While I lie tossing about in the
dark, my lord sleeps and all's well! My dear man, you have a jolly
elastic conscience."
</p><p>The word elastic amused the Senegalese mightily. His mouth opened wider
than ever; and he gave a grunt of enjoyment.
</p><p>"That'll do, that'll do," said the captain. "There's no getting a word
in, once you start talking. Here, take a chair, read this report and
give me your reasoned opinion. What? You don't know how to read? Well,
upon my word! What was the good, then, of wearing out the seat of your
trousers on the benches of the Senegal schools and colleges? A queer
education, I must say!"
</p><p>He heaved a sigh, and, snatching the manuscript, said:
</p><p>"Listen, reflect, argue, deduct and conclude. This is how the matter
briefly stands. First, we have one Essarès Bey, a banker, rich as
Crœsus, and the lowest of rapscallions, who betrays at one and the same
time France, Egypt, England, Turkey, Bulgaria and Greece . . . as is
proved by the fact that his accomplices roast his feet for him.
Thereupon he kills one of them and gets rid of four with the aid of as
many millions, which millions he orders another accomplice to get back
for him before five minutes are passed. And all these bright spirits
will duck underground at eleven o'clock this morning, for at twelve
o'clock the police propose to enter on the scene. Good."
</p><p>Patrice Belval paused to take breath and continued:
</p><p>"Secondly, Little Mother Coralie--upon my word, I can't say why--is
married to Rapscallion Bey. She hates him and wants to kill him. He
loves her and wants to kill her. There is also a colonel who loves her
and for that reason loses his life and a certain Mustapha, who tries to
kidnap her on the colonel's account and also loses his life for that
reason, strangled by a Senegalese. Lastly, there is a French captain, a
dot-and-carry-one, who likewise loves her, but whom she avoids because
she is married to a man whom she abhors. And with this captain, in a
previous incarnation, she has halved an amethyst bead. Add to all this,
by way of accessories, a rusty key, a red silk bowstring, a dog choked
to death and a grate filled with red coals. And, if you dare to
understand a single word of my explanation, I'll catch you a whack with
my wooden leg, for I don't understand it a little bit and I'm your
captain."
</p><p>Ya-Bon laughed all over his mouth and all over the gaping scar that cut
one of his cheeks in two. As ordered by his captain, he understood
nothing of the business and very little of what Patrice had said; but he
always quivered with delight when Patrice addressed him in that gruff
tone.
</p><p>"That's enough," said the captain. "It's my turn now to argue, deduct
and conclude."
</p><p>He leant against the mantelpiece, with his two elbows on the marble
shelf and his head tight-pressed between his hands. His merriment, which
sprang from temperamental lightness of heart, was this time only a
surface merriment. Deep down within himself he did nothing but think of
Coralie with sorrowful apprehension. What could he do to protect her? A
number of plans occurred to him: which was he to choose? Should he hunt
through the numbers in the telephone-book till he hit upon the
whereabouts of that Grégoire, with whom Bournef and his companions had
taken refuge? Should he inform the police? Should he return to the Rue
Raynouard? He did not know. Yes, he was capable of acting, if the act to
be performed consisted in flinging himself into the conflict with
furious ardor. But to prepare the action, to divine the obstacles, to
rend the darkness, and, as he said, to see the invisible and grasp the
intangible, that was beyond his powers.
</p><p>He turned suddenly to Ya-Bon, who was standing depressed by his silence:
</p><p>"What's the matter with you, putting on that lugubrious air? Of course
it's you that throw a gloom over me! You always look at the black side
of things . . . like a nigger! . . . Be off."
</p><p>Ya-Bon was going away discomfited, when some one tapped at the door and
a voice said:
</p><p>"Captain Belval, you're wanted on the telephone."
</p><p>Patrice hurried out. Who on earth could be telephoning to him so early
in the morning?
</p><p>"Who is it?" he asked the nurse.
</p><p>"I don't know, captain. . . . It's a man's voice; he seemed to want you
urgently. The bell had been ringing some time. I was downstairs, in the
kitchen. . . ."
</p><p>Before Patrice's eyes there rose a vision of the telephone in the Rue
Raynouard, in the big room at the Essarès' house. He could not help
wondering if there was anything to connect the two incidents.
</p><p>He went down one flight of stairs and along a passage. The telephone was
through a small waiting-room, in a room that had been turned into a
linen-closet. He closed the door behind him.
</p><p>"Hullo! Captain Belval speaking. What is it?"
</p><p>A voice, a man's voice which he did not know, replied in breathless,
panting tones:
</p><p>"Ah! . . . Captain Belval! . . . It's you! . . . Look here . . . but I'm
almost afraid that it's too late. . . . I don't know if I shall have
time to finish. . . . Did you get the key and the letter? . . ."
</p><p>"Who are you?" asked Patrice.
</p><p>"Did you get the key and the letter?" the voice insisted.
</p><p>"The key, yes," Patrice replied, "but not the letter."
</p><p>"Not the letter? But this is terrible! Then you don't know . . ."
</p><p>A hoarse cry struck Patrice's ear and the next thing he caught was
incoherent sounds at the other end of the wire, the noise of an
altercation. Then the voice seemed to glue itself to the instrument and
he distinctly heard it gasping:
</p><p>"Too late! . . . Patrice . . . is that you? . . . Listen, the amethyst
pendant . . . yes, I have it on me. . . . The pendant. . . . Ah, it's
too late! . . . I should so much have liked to . . . Patrice. . . .
Coralie. . . ."
</p><p>Then again a loud cry, a heart-rending cry, and confused sounds growing
more distant, in which he seemed to distinguish:
</p><p>"Help! . . . Help! . . ."
</p><p>These grew fainter and fainter. Silence followed. And suddenly there was
a little click. The murderer had hung up the receiver.
</p><p>All this had not taken twenty seconds. But, when Patrice wanted to
replace the telephone, his fingers were gripping it so hard that it
needed an effort to relax them.
</p><p>He stood utterly dumfounded. His eyes had fastened on a large clock
which he saw, through the window, on one of the buildings in the yard,
marking nineteen minutes past seven; and he mechanically repeated these
figures, attributing a documentary value to them. Then he asked
himself--so unreal did the scene appear to him--if all this was true and
if the crime had not been penetrated within himself, in the depths of
his aching heart. But the shouting still echoed in his ears; and
suddenly he took up the receiver again, like one clinging desperately to
some undefined hope:
</p><p>"Hullo!" he cried. "Exchange! . . . Who was it rang me up just now?
. . . Are you there? Did you hear the cries? . . . Are you there? . . .
Are you there? . . ."
</p><p>There was no reply. He lost his temper, insulted the exchange, left the
linen-closet, met Ya-Bon and pushed him about:
</p><p>"Get out of this! It's your fault. Of course you ought to have stayed
and looked after Coralie. Be off there now and hold yourself at my
disposal. I'm going to inform the police. If you hadn't prevented me, it
would have been done long ago and we shouldn't be in this predicament.
Off you go!"
</p><p>He held him back:
</p><p>"No, don't stir. Your plan's ridiculous. Stay here. Oh, not here in my
pocket! You're too impetuous for me, my lad!"
</p><p>He drove him out and returned to the linen-closet, striding up and down
and betraying his excitement in irritable gestures and angry words.
Nevertheless, in the midst of his confusion, one idea gradually came to
light, which was that, after all, he had no proof that the crime which
he suspected had happened at the house in the Rue Raynouard. He must not
allow himself to be obsessed by the facts that lingered in his memory to
the point of always seeing the same vision in the same tragic setting.
No doubt the drama was being continued, as he had felt that it would be,
but perhaps elsewhere and far away from Coralie.
</p><p>And this first thought led to another: why not investigate matters at
once?
</p><p>"Yes, why not?" he asked himself. "Before bothering the police,
discovering the number of the person who rang me up and thus working
back to the start, a process which it will be time enough to employ
later, why shouldn't I telephone to the Rue Raynouard at once, on any
pretext and in anybody's name? I shall then have a chance of knowing
what to think. . . ."
</p><p>Patrice felt that this measure did not amount to much. Suppose that no
one answered, would that prove that the murder had been committed in the
house, or merely that no one was yet about? Nevertheless, the need to do
something decided him. He looked up Essarès Bey's number in the
telephone-directory and resolutely rang up the exchange.
</p><p>The strain of waiting was almost more than he could bear. And then he
was conscious of a thrill which vibrated through him from head to foot.
He was connected; and some one at the other end was answering the call.
</p><p>"Hullo!" he said.
</p><p>"Hullo!" said a voice. "Who are you?"
</p><p>It was the voice of Essarès Bey.
</p><p>Although this was only natural, since at that moment Essarès must be
getting his papers ready and preparing his flight, Patrice was so much
taken aback that he did not know what to say and spoke the first words
that came into his head:
</p><p>"Is that Essarès Bey?"
</p><p>"Yes. Who are you?"
</p><p>"I'm one of the wounded at the hospital, now under treatment at the
home. . . ."
</p><p>"Captain Belval, perhaps?"
</p><p>Patrice was absolutely amazed. So Coralie's husband knew him by name? He
stammered:
</p><p>"Yes . . . Captain Belval."
</p><p>"What a lucky thing!" cried Essarès Bey, in a tone of delight. "I rang
you up a moment ago, at the home, Captain Belval, to ask . . ."
</p><p>"Oh, it was you!" interrupted Patrice, whose astonishment knew no
bounds.
</p><p>"Yes, I wanted to know at what time I could speak to Captain Belval in
order to thank him."
</p><p>"It was <u>you</u>! . . . It was <u>you</u>! . . ." Patrice repeated, more and
more thunderstruck.
</p><p>Essarès' intonation denoted a certain surprise.
</p><p>"Yes, wasn't it a curious coincidence?" he said. "Unfortunately, I was
cut off, or rather my call was interrupted by somebody else."
</p><p>"Then you heard?"
</p><p>"What, Captain Belval?"
</p><p>"Cries."
</p><p>"Cries?"
</p><p>"At least, so it seemed to me; but the connection was very indistinct."
</p><p>"All that I heard was somebody asking for you, somebody who was in a
great hurry; and, as I was not, I hung up the telephone and postponed
the pleasure of thanking you."
</p><p>"Of thanking me?"
</p><p>"Yes, I have heard how my wife was assaulted last night and how you came
to her rescue. And I am anxious to see you and express my gratitude.
Shall we make an appointment? Could we meet at the hospital, for
instance, at three o'clock this afternoon?"
</p><p>Patrice made no reply. The audacity of this man, threatened with arrest
and preparing for flight, baffled him. At the same time, he was
wondering what Essarès' real object had been in telephoning to him
without being in any way obliged to. But Belval's silence in no way
troubled the banker, who continued his civilities and ended the
inscrutable conversation with a monologue in which he replied with the
greatest ease to questions which he kept putting to himself.
</p><p>In spite of everything, Patrice felt more comfortable. He went back to
his room, lay down on his bed and slept for two hours. Then he sent for
Ya-Bon.
</p><p>"This time," he said, "try to control your nerves and not to lose your
head as you did just now. You were absurd. But don't let's talk about
it. Have you had your breakfast? No? No more have I. Have you seen the
doctor? No? No more have I. And the surgeon has just promised to take
off this beastly bandage. You can imagine how pleased I am. A wooden leg
is all very well; but a head wrapped up in lint, for a lover, never! Get
on, look sharp. When we're ready, we'll start for the hospital. Little
Mother Coralie can't forbid me to see her there!"
</p><p>Patrice was as happy as a schoolboy. As he said to Ya-Bon an hour later,
on their way to the Porte-Maillot, the clouds were beginning to roll by:
</p><p>"Yes, Ya-Bon, yes, they are. And this is where we stand. To begin with,
Coralie is not in danger. As I hoped, the battle is being fought far
away from her, among the accomplices no doubt, over their millions. As
for the unfortunate man who rang me up and whose dying cries I
overheard, he was obviously some unknown friend, for he addressed me
familiarly and called me by my Christian name. It was certainly he who
sent me the key of the garden. Unfortunately, the letter that came with
the key went astray. In the end, he felt constrained to tell me
everything. Just at that moment he was attacked. By whom, you ask.
Probably by one of the accomplices, who was frightened of his
revelations. There you are, Ya-Bon. It's all as clear as noonday. For
that matter, the truth may just as easily be the exact opposite of what
I suggest. But I don't care. The great thing is to take one's stand upon
a theory, true or false. Besides, if mine is false, I reserve the right
to shift the responsibility on you. So you know what you're in for.
. . ."
</p><p>At the Porte-Maillot they took a cab and it occurred to Patrice to drive
round by the Rue Raynouard. At the junction of this street with the Rue
de Passy, they saw Coralie leaving the Rue Raynouard, accompanied by old
Siméon.
</p><p>She had hailed a taxi and stepped inside. Siméon sat down by the
driver. They went to the hospital in the Champs-Élysées, with Patrice
following. It was eleven o'clock when they arrived.
</p><p>"All's well," said Patrice. "While her husband is running away, she
refuses to make any change in her daily life."
</p><p>He and Ya-Bon lunched in the neighborhood, strolled along the avenue,
without losing sight of the hospital, and called there at half-past one.
</p><p>Patrice at once saw old Siméon, sitting at the end of a covered yard
where the soldiers used to meet. His head was half wrapped up in the
usual comforter; and, with his big yellow spectacles on his nose, he sat
smoking his pipe on the chair which he always occupied.
</p><p>As for Coralie, she was in one of the rooms allotted to her on the first
floor, seated by the bedside of a patient whose hand she held between
her own. The man was asleep.
</p><p>Coralie appeared to Patrice to be very tired. The dark rings round her
eyes and the unusual pallor of her cheeks bore witness to her fatigue.
</p><p>"Poor child!" he thought. "All those blackguards will be the death of
you."
</p><p>He now understood, when he remembered the scenes of the night before,
why Coralie kept her private life secret and endeavored, at least to the
little world of the hospital, to be merely the kind sister whom people
call by her Christian name. Suspecting the web of crime with which she
was surrounded, she dropped her husband's name and told nobody where she
lived. And so well was she protected by the defenses set up by her
modesty and determination that Patrice dared not go to her and stood
rooted to the threshold.
</p><p>"Yet surely," he said to himself, as he looked at Coralie without being
seen by her, "I'm not going to send her in my card!"
</p><p>He was making up his mind to enter, when a woman who had come up the
stairs, talking loudly as she went, called out:
</p><p>"Where is madame? . . . M. Siméon, she must come at once!"
</p><p>Old Siméon, who had climbed the stairs with her, pointed to where
Coralie sat at the far end of the room; and the woman rushed in. She
said a few words to Coralie, who seemed upset and at once, ran to the
door, passing in front of Patrice, and down the stairs, followed by
Siméon and the woman.
</p><p>"I've got a taxi, ma'am," stammered the woman, all out of breath. "I had
the luck to find one when I left the house and I kept it. We must be
quick, ma'am. . . . The commissary of police told me to . . ."
</p><p>Patrice, who was downstairs by this time, heard nothing more; but the
last words decided him. He seized hold of Ya-Bon as he passed; and the
two of them leapt into a cab, telling the driver to follow Coralie's
taxi.
</p><p>"There's news, Ya-Bon, there's news!" said Patrice. "The plot is
thickening. The woman is obviously one of the Essarès' servants and she
has come for her mistress by the commissary's orders. Therefore the
colonel's disclosures are having their effect. House searched;
magistrate's inquest; every sort of worry for Little Mother Coralie; and
you have the cheek to advise me to be careful! You imagine that I would
leave her to her own devices at such a moment! What a mean nature you
must have, my poor Ya-Bon!"
</p><p>An idea occurred to him; and he exclaimed:
</p><p>"Heavens! I hope that ruffian of an Essarès hasn't allowed himself to be
caught! That would be a disaster! But he was far too sure of himself. I
expect he's been trifling away his time. . . ."
</p><p>All through the drive this fear excited Captain Belval and removed his
last scruples. In the end his certainty was absolute. Nothing short of
Essarès' arrest could have produced the servant's attitude of panic or
Coralie's precipitate departure. Under these conditions, how could he
hesitate to interfere in a matter in which his revelations would
enlighten the police? All the more so as, by revealing less or more,
according to circumstances, he could make his evidence subservient to
Coralie's interests.
</p><p>The two cabs pulled up almost simultaneously outside the Essarès' house,
where a car was already standing. Coralie alighted and disappeared
through the carriage-gate. The maid and Siméon also crossed the
pavement.
</p><p>"Come along," said Patrice to the Senegalese.
</p><p>The front-door was ajar and Patrice entered. In the big hall were two
policemen on duty. Patrice acknowledged their presence with a hurried
movement of his hand and passed them with the air of a man who belonged
to the house and whose importance was so great that nothing done without
him could be of any use.
</p><p>The sound of his footsteps echoing on the flags reminded him of the
flight of Bournef and his accomplices. He was on the right road.
Moreover, there was a drawing-room on the left, the room, communicating
with the library, to which the accomplices had carried the colonel's
body. Voices came from the library. He walked across the drawing-room.
</p><p>At that moment he heard Coralie exclaim in accents of terror:
</p><p>"Oh, my God, it can't be! . . ."
</p><p>Two other policemen barred the doorway.
</p><p>"I am a relation of Mme. Essarès'," he said, "her only relation. . . ."
</p><p>"We have our orders, captain . . ."
</p><p>"I know, of course. Be sure and let no one in! Ya-Bon, stay here."
</p><p>And he went in.
</p><p>But, in the immense room, a group of six or seven gentlemen, no doubt
commissaries of police and magistrates, stood in his way, bending over
something which he was unable to distinguish. From amidst this group
Coralie suddenly appeared and came towards him, tottering and wringing
her hands. The housemaid took her round the waist and pressed her into a
chair.
</p><p>"What's the matter?" asked Patrice.
</p><p>"Madame is feeling faint," replied the woman, still quite distraught.
"Oh, I'm nearly off my head!"
</p><p>"But why? What's the reason?"
</p><p>"It's the master . . . just think! . . . Such a sight! . . . It gave me
a turn, too . . ."
</p><p>"What sight?"
</p><p>One of the gentlemen left the group and approached:
</p><p>"Is Mme. Essarès ill?"
</p><p>"It's nothing," said the maid. "A fainting-fit. . . . She is liable to
these attacks."
</p><p>"Take her away as soon as she can walk. We shall not need her any
longer."
</p><p>And, addressing Patrice Belval with a questioning air:
</p><p>"Captain? . . ."
</p><p>Patrice pretended not to understand:
</p><p>"Yes, sir," he said, "we will take Mme. Essarès away. Her presence, as
you say, is unnecessary. Only I must first . . ."
</p><p>He moved aside to avoid his interlocutor, and, perceiving that the group
of magistrates had opened out a little, stepped forward. What he now saw
explained Coralie's fainting-fit and the servant's agitation. He himself
felt his flesh creep at a spectacle which was infinitely more horrible
than that of the evening before.
</p><p>On the floor, near the fireplace, almost at the place where he had
undergone his torture, Essarès Bey lay upon his back. He was wearing the
same clothes as on the previous day: a brown-velvet smoking-suit with a
braided jacket. His head and shoulders had been covered with a napkin.
But one of the men standing around, a divisional surgeon no doubt, was
holding up the napkin with one hand and pointing to the dead man's face
with the other, while he offered an explanation in a low voice.
</p><p>And that face . . . but it was hardly the word for the unspeakable mass
of flesh, part of which seemed to be charred while the other part formed
no more than a bloodstained pulp, mixed with bits of bone and skin,
hairs and a broken eye-ball.
</p><p>"Oh," Patrice blurted out, "how horrible! He was killed and fell with
his head right in the fire. That's how they found him, I suppose?"
</p><p>The man who had already spoken to him and who appeared to be the most
important figure present came up to him once more:
</p><p>"May I ask who you are?" he demanded.
</p><p>"Captain Belval, sir, a friend of Mme. Essarès, one of the wounded
officers whose lives she has helped to save . . ."
</p><p>"That may be, sir," replied the important figure, "but you can't stay
here. Nobody must stay here, for that matter. Monsieur le commissaire,
please order every one to leave the room, except the doctor, and have
the door guarded. Let no one enter on any pretext whatever. . . ."
</p><p>"Sir," Patrice insisted, "I have some very serious information to
communicate."
</p><p>"I shall be pleased to receive it, captain, but later on. You must
excuse me now."
