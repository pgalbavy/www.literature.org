<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Leland and Leslie conversed and recounted to each other their
adventures until those were exhausted, when they endeavored to
keep off the chill by taking turns at the oars. Morning at length
began to appear. In a short time darkness lifted from the water,
and the bright rays of the morning sun pierced the foliage of
the forest and rested upon the stream.</p>

<p>About the middle of the forenoon, Kent ran in under the bank
and sprung ashore. The day was quite warm, and it was a pleasure
for the three to step upon the land and stretch themselves in
the genial sunshine. They had, however, halted for consultation,
and to determine upon the plan to pursue in order to rescue Rosalind.</p>

<p>"One more job finished and we'll rest a while," said Kent.</p>

<p>"And as we have depended upon and been guided and saved by your
wisdom," said Leslie, "of course, in this most important case
your advice must be followed."</p>

<p>"Let's hear what you chaps have got to say first, 'cause p'raps
you might accidentally say somethin' smart without knowin' it.
I'll decide it after we all get through."</p>

<p>"What seems to me the most feasible is this," commenced Leland.
"Let all three of us follow the savages which have taken my sister,
and after reaching their vicinity, by stratagem recover her. If
it be impossible to do it in this way, make a bold dash and venture
among them, and take her at all events."</p>

<p>"Killin' first 'bout one hundred Injins, just to get 'em out
the way, you know," said Kent, with mock gravity. "Come, Leslie,
it's your turn; and bein' you're so much interested, I 'spects
to hear somethin' awful grand."</p>

<p>Leslie, to save his life, could not prevent a blush at this allusion.
As might be expected, he had thought of more than one plan, long
before asked for it, and replied without hesitation:</p>

<p>"What I say is, <em>rescue</em> her at all events, as George
has said. Of course, it's out of the question to do it by force,
and we must outwit the savages. This I think possible, for the
good reason that it has so often been done. All three of us, or
perhaps, what would be better, you and myself can follow them
up and retake her. George, in his present state, could do but
little to aid us, and in all probability, will endanger the safety
of all concerned."</p>

<p>"I agrees with you there; and a little further. Mr. Leslie, 'in
his present state,' <em>would</em> do but little to aid us, and
in all probability, endanger the safety of all concerned."</p>

<p>"There is no need of jesting, Kent. You know that it would be
the best for you to have a companion, and who can you take but
me?"</p>

<p>"Don't know but what it would. Now, s'posen an old feller that
don't know nothin' says somethin'?" said Kent, good-humoredly;
for he, as is generally the case with those of his class, had
a habit of depreciating his own sagacity and foresight, when he
really knew how much superior it was to his companion's.</p>

<p>"Don't know but what it would," he repeated. "S'pose if I's in
your case, I'd feel the same; but you see, there's somethin' else
to think of. S'posen we gets her, we hain't got any place to stick
our heads in, and may be hunted forever after by the skunks. Now
as soon as convenient, we'll paddle down to the place where Leland's
house was burned, and drop him there; fur it won't do to take
<em>you</em> 'long, George. Leslie understands the Injins better
than you, and it would just git us all into a muss, and like enough,
make 'em knock her on the head, to save trouble. We'll take you
up to your farm 'cause that'll be a place we can't miss very well;
and if there's a shed or anything left, you can stow yourself
away till we gets back. Keep a good lookout, and don't get into
any trouble. I'll take Leslie along, for I s'pose he won't stay,
and I've thought of a plan that'll take him to work with. There,
you have my plan."</p>

<p>"Which you must admit, is the one that must be followed," said
Leslie, turning toward Leland.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he returned, "that your advice should be taken,
although I confess that I had hoped to accompany you; but as I
said, Kent knows best, and the only proper course is to obey him."</p>

<p>"Well, let us not wait, now that we have decided what to do,"
said Leslie, rising to his feet.</p>

<p>"No; we ought to be movin', fur I opine we've a good tramp afore
us."</p>

<p>Again the boat was shoved out, and shot onward. Nothing worthy
of mention occurred on the way. The next day, at noon, they reached
their destination. Leland's heart sunk within him, as he gazed
up from the river and saw, where once his home had been, nothing
but black and charred ruins. A portion of what had once been used
as the barn remained entire, having escaped the flames.</p>

<p>"This is just the thing," said Kent, approaching it. "We'll fix
it up a little and I'd advise you to go to sleep, and stay so
until we get back."</p>

<p>The three set vigorously to work, and in a short time they had
made it quite comfortable. It consisted of logs placed firmly
and compactly together, and secured so that a single person well
armed could offer effectual resistance to a formidable enemy.
Being in a sort of clearing, it had the additional advantage of
affording its inhabitant such a view that he could not be approached
by any person without their being observed and thus giving him
time to prepare for them.</p>

<p>"There!" said the hunter, retreating a short distance and gazing
at it. "I wouldn't ax a better place. You might bring down a hundred
Injins, and give me plenty powder and ball, I'd have the best
fun in creation."</p>

<p>"Suppose they come upon all sides?" suggested Leland.</p>

<p>"All you got to do is to take the stock off your gun and shoot
out of both ends of the barrel."</p>

<p>"You can go now as soon as you please; but first tell me what
time to expect you back."</p>

<p>Kent folded both arms over the muzzle of his gun, and shutting
one eye, remained for a few moments buried in earnest thought.
Then he replied:</p>

<p>"Between five and eight days; probably on the sixth."</p>

<p>"All ready?" queried Leslie.</p>

<p>"All ready," returned Kent.</p>

<p>Both bade Leland good-by, and after a few unimportant words,
started upon their journey. Leslie felt a wild, joyous thrill
as he realized that he was really nearing Rosalind; that in a
short time, as he firmly believed, he should see and be able to
assist her to procure her liberty. He could hardly restrain his
impatience, but vainly urged Kent to quicken his thoughtful, lagging
steps. The sun had set, and darkness was slowly spreading over
the great forest, when the two plunged into its depths and ventured
upon their perilous, doubtful undertaking.</p>

<p>For a considerable time we have left Rosalind to herself, and
with the reader's permission we will now return to her.</p>

<p>The Indians which held her, as was stated, journeyed far into
the interior of Kentucky before making a final halt. Here they
reached the village or headquarters of their tribe, and gave her
to understand that her journey was at an end.</p>

<p>The village numbered several hundred, and considering her defenseless
position, the savages allowed her considerable liberty. From the
first, however, she was made a slave and a drudge, and compelled
to toil with the hardy squaws of their tribe, bearing their insults
and sometimes even their blows. The hope and prospect of a speedy
relief and deliverance enabled her to bear this without murmuring.
She had not much fear of death, as she judged by their actions
that their intention was to make her a prisoner for life.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the animal creation but which is affected
by kindness and obedience, and there is no race upon which it
makes a more ready impression than the American. Rosalind's continual
gentleness and pleasing manner melted the hearts of many of the
warriors, and more than one rude epithet was restrained by the
meek loveliness of her face.</p>

<p>Yet she was sometimes in greater danger than she ever dreamed.
All did not act and feel thus toward her; more than one voice
demanded her blood, and while she lay quietly dreaming of some
loved one, there was many an angry discussion over her life. Deadly,
baleful glances were given her, when in her musings she was unconscious
of the notice of any one; and among the entire female portion
there was not a squaw but what regarded her with feelings of jealousy
and hatred. Had she remained a month, at the end of that time
her life would no doubt have been sacrificed. To quiet the continual
broiling and angry feelings, the Indians would have acted as they
did in nearly a similar case some years before; she would have
been tomahawked, as was the young Miss McCrea.</p>

<p>Rosalind often wondered who the person could be that had interrupted
her conversation with Zeb upon the first night of her captivity.
One day she was gratified with the knowledge. A savage approached
her and commenced a conversation:</p>

<p>"How is the pale-faced maiden?"</p>

<p>She started at hearing her tongue spoken so well, and looking
up recognized a middle-aged Indian, that had frequently visited
her house during her father's life. She replied:</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>The savage was uneasy, and waited a few moments for her to speak
further, but as she evinced no disposition to do so, he at length
added:</p>

<p>"Does the maiden remember Pequanon?"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Does the maiden remember Pequanon?"]</p>

<p>"She does," she returned, looking him steadily in the face. "She
remembers him as one who received kindness both from her father's
hand and her own, and as one who shows his gratitude by treacherously
burning her home, and carrying her into captivity. Yes, Pequanon,"
she continued, bursting into tears at the remembrance of the event,
"she remembers you and can never forget your conduct."</p>

<p>"Pequanon saved your life," he returned, feelingly.</p>

<p>"And gave me a fate that is worse."</p>

<p>"He went with his brothers when they burned your home, but he
did not help. He went to save your life, and did do it. When the
tomahawk was lifted over your head, he caught the arm and turned
it aside. When your blood was called for, Pequanon swore that
it should not be had, and he has kept his word. Pequanon never
forgets kindness, and will die for the maiden that clothed and
fed him."</p>

<p>Rosalind felt her heart moved with pity toward the poor, untutored
savage who had thus really been grateful, and no doubt had done
all in his power for her good. She recalled many instances where
she believed that he was the cause of the lenity upon the part
of the captors, and where it seemed that some one had shown an
interest in her welfare. She informed him that she believed he
had done her all the good that was in his power, and expressed
her heartfelt thanks for it. The Indian seemed gratified beyond
measure, and after further conversation took his departure, promising
eternal fidelity to her.</p>

<p>This circumstance, though trivial in itself, had a great influence
upon Rosalind. It gave her a knowledge of the true position in
which she stood. Although she doubted not but that she had friends
among the savage beings around her, yet she well knew that there
were many deadly enemies, who, when an opportunity offered, would
not hesitate to take her life. Every night when she lay down,
it was with the prayer that her life might be preserved until
morning, and that, were it in the power of her friends to rescue
her, they would do it speedily.</p>

<p>The lodge in which she slept was that of the chief. Besides his
own wife, several squaws remained in it during the night. A young
woman, her most bitter and hateful enemy, slept beside Rosalind
most of the time, and the slightest movement on the part of the
latter was sure to occasion some insulting word or command from
her. She bore this without a word, hoping each night that it was
the last she was to spend in this manner.</p>

<p>One night she suddenly awoke to a full state of consciousness&mdash;so
suddenly that it startled and alarmed her. It seemed as though
something had awakened her, and yet she could recall nothing.
She turned her head and gazed at her companion, but she, to all
appearances, was sound asleep, and could not have been the cause.
She experienced no more of drowsiness or inclination to sleep,
but concluded to feign it in the hope of satisfying herself of
any danger that might be lurking near her.</p>

<p>She half closed her eyes, yet kept a close watch of everything
around her. In a moment there was a rustling upon the outside;
the next instant the point of a knife protruded through a gap
in the skin of the lodge, and two eyes were seen gleaming like
a tiger's; then the hand that held the knife was thrust forward,
and it was held over her.</p>

<p>Rosalind tried to scream, but could not utter a sound. She seemed
frozen with terror, and only made a spasmodic movement that awoke
her companion. As soon as the latter moved, the hand was withdrawn
and the rent closed of its own accord.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she murmured, "did you see it?"</p>

<p>Her companion, more angered on account of being awakened from
her sleep, struck her a blow and commanded silence; but Rosalind
could not remain in her position, and arising and stepping softly
over the sleeping form beside her, seated herself in the center
of the lodge. Here she remained until morning, when she made the
inmates understand the nature of her nocturnal fright. All treated
it lightly, and she began to entertain a suspicion that they knew
more of it than she did herself.</p>

<p>In the course of the day she narrated the circumstance to Pequanon,
showing him also the aperture that had been made in the lodge.
He examined it carefully, and appeared troubled about it. The
marks of a person's knee and moccasin could be seen upon the soft
earth, and there was no doubt that her life had been sought. Pequanon
informed her of something that surprised and alarmed her as much
as this. Several of the warriors, since her first appearance among
them, had shown a desire to obtain Rosalind for a wife; and although
it may seem strange that she herself was not aware of the fact,
Pequanon had noticed it from the commencement, and now for the
first time warned her of it. One who suspected that he should
be disappointed, had taken the means to procure the revenge that
we have mentioned. Ever after this Pequanon remained in the lodge
during the night, and Rosalind was careful to keep at a safe distance
from the sides of it.</p>

<p>She saw in the fact that he had given her, the cause of the hatred
upon the part of the females toward her. They had seen the favor
with which she was regarded by numbers of the warriors, and were
filled with jealousy at it. From them she had as much to fear
as from the Indians who wished to obtain her.</p>
