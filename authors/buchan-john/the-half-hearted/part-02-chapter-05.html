<p>There is another quarter in Bardur besides the English one. Down
by the stream side there are narrow streets built on the scarp
of the rock, hovels with deep rock cellars, and a wonderful amount
of cubic space beneath the brushwood thatch. There the trader
from Yarkand who has contraband wares to dispose of may hold a
safe market. And if you were to go at nightfall into this quarter,
where the foot of the Kashmir policeman rarely penetrates, you
might find shaggy tribesmen who have been all their lives outlaws,
walking unmolested to visit their friends, and certain Jewish
gentlemen, members of the great family who have conquered the
world, engaged in the pursuit of their unlawful calling.</p>

<p>Marker speedily left the broader streets of the European quarter,
and plunged down a steep alley which led to the stream. Half way
down there was a lane to the left in the line of hovels, and,
after stopping a moment to consider, he entered this. It was narrow
and dark, but smelt cleanly enough of the dry granite sand. There
were little dark apertures in the huts, which might have been
either doors or windows, and at one of these he stopped, lit a
match, and examined it closely. The result was satisfactory; for
the man, who had hitherto been crouching, straightened himself
up and knocked. The door opened instantaneously, and he bowed
his tall head to enter a narrow passage. This brought him into
a miniature courtyard, about thirty feet across, above which gleamed
a patch of violet sky, sown with stars. Below a door on the right
a light shone, and this he pushed open, and entered a little room.</p>

<p>The place was richly furnished, with low couches and Persian
tables, and on the floor a bright matting. The short, square-set
man sitting smoking on the divan we have already met at a certain
village in the mountains. Fazir Khan, descendant of Abraham, and
father and chief of the Bada-Mawidi, has a nervous eye and an
uneasy face to-night, for it is a hard thing for a mountaineer,
an inhabitant of great spaces, to sit with composure in a trap-like
room in the citadel of a foe who has many acts of rape and murder
to avenge on his body. To do Fazir Khan justice he strove to conceal
his restlessness under the usual impassive calm of his race. He
turned his head slightly as Marker entered, nodded gravely over
the bowl of his pipe, and pointed to the seat at the far end of
the divan.</p>

<p>"It is a dark night," he said. "I heard you stumbling on the
causeway before you entered. And I have many miles to cover before
dawn."</p>

<p>Marker nodded. "Then you must make haste, my friend. You must
be in the hills by daybreak, for I have some errands I want you
to do for me. I have to-night been dining with two strangers,
who have come up from the south."</p>

<p>The chief's eyes sparkled. "Do they suspect?"</p>

<p>"Nothing in particular, everything in general. They are English.
One was here before and got far up into your mountains. He wrote
a clever book when he returned, which made people think. They
say their errand is sport, and it may be. On the other hand I
have a doubt. One has not the air of the common sportsman. He
thinks too much, and his eyes have a haggard look. It is possible
that they are in their Government's services and have come to
reconnoitre."</p>

<p>"Then we are lost," said Fazir Khan sourly. "It was always a
fool's plan, at the mercy of any wandering Englishman."</p>

<p>"Not so," said Marker. "Nothing is lost, and nothing will be
lost. But I fear these two men. They do not bluster and talk at
random like the others. They are so very quiet that they may mean
danger."</p>

<p>"They must remain here," said the chief. "Give me the word, and
I will send one of my men to hough their horses and, if need be,
cripple themselves."</p>

<p>Marker laughed. "You are an honest fool, Fazir Khan. That sort
of thing is past now. We live in the wrong times and places for
it. We cannot keep them here, but we must send them on a goose-chase.
Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"I understand nothing. I am a simple man and my ways are simple,
and not as yours."</p>

<p>"Then attend to my words, my friend. Our expedition must be changed
and made two days sooner. That will give these two Englishmen
three days only to checkmate it. Besides, they are ignorant, and
to-morrow is lost to them, for they go to a ball at the Logan
woman's. Still, I fear them with two days to work in. If they
go north, they are clever and suspicious, and they may see or
fancy enough to wreck our plans. They may have the way barred,
and we know how little would bar the way."</p>

<p>"Ten resolute men," said the chief. "Nay, I myself, with my two
sons, would hold a force at bay there."</p>

<p>"If that is true, how much need is there to be wary beforehand!
Since we cannot prevent these men from meddling, we can give them
rope to meddle in small matters. Let us assume that they have
been sent out by their Government. They are the common make of
Englishmen, worshipping a god which they call their honour. They
will do their duty if they can find it out. Now there is but one
plan, to create a duty for them which will take them out of the
way."</p>

<p>The chief was listening with half-closed eyes. He saw new trouble
for himself and was not cheerful.</p>

<p>"Do you know how many men Holm has with him at the Forza camp?"</p>

<p>"A score and a half. Some of my people passed that way yesterday,
when the soldiers were parading."</p>

<p>"And there are two more camps?</p>

<p>"There are two beyond the Nazri Pass, on the fringe of the Doorab
hills. We call the places Khautmi-sa and Khautmi-bana, but the
English have their own names for them."</p>

<p>Marker nodded.</p>

<p>"I know the places. They are Gurkha camps. The officers are called
Mitchinson and St. John. They will give us little trouble. But
the Forza garrison is too near the pass for safety, and yet far
enough away for my plans." And for a moment the man's eyes were
abstracted, as if in deep thought.</p>

<p>"I have another thing to tell of the Forza camp," the chief interrupted.
"The captain, the man whom they call Holm, is sick, so sick that
he cannot remain there. He went out shooting and came too near
to dangerous places, so a bullet of one of my people's guns found
his leg. He will be coming to Bardur to-morrow. Is it your wish
that he be prevented?</p>

<p>"Let him come," said Marker. "He will suit my purpose. Now I
will tell you your task, Fazir Khan, for it is time that you took
the road. You will take a hundred of the Bada-Mawidi and put them
in the rocks round the Forza camp. Let them fire a few shots but
do no great damage, lest this man Holm dare not leave. If I know
the man at all, he will only hurry the quicker when he hears word
of trouble, for he has no stomach for danger, if he can get out
of it creditably. So he will come down here to-morrow with a tale
of the Bada-Mawidi in arms, and find no men in the place to speak
of, except these two strangers. I will have already warned them
of this intended rising, and if, as I believe, they serve the
Government, they will let no grass grow below their feet till
they get to Forza. Then on the day after let your tribesmen attack
the place, not so as to take it, but so as to make a good show
of fight and keep the garrison employed. This will keep these
young men quiet; they will think that all rumours they may have
heard culminate in this rising of yours, and they will be content,
and satisfied that they have done their duty. Then, the day after,
while they are idling at Forza, we will slip through the passes,
and after that there will be no need for ruses."</p>

<p>The chief rose and pulled himself up to his full height. "After
that," he said, "there will be work for men. God! We shall harry
the valleys as our forefathers harried them, and we shall suck
the juicy plains dry. You will give us a free hand, my lord?"</p>

<p>"Your hand shall be free enough," said Marker. "But see that
every word of my bidding is done. We fail utterly unless all is
secret and swift. It is the lion attacking the village. If he
crosses the trap gate safely he may ravage at his pleasure, but
there is first the trap to cross. And now it is your time to leave."</p>

<p>The mountaineer tightened his girdle, and exchanged his slippers
for deer-hide boots. He bowed gravely to the other and slipped
out into the darkness of the court. Marker drew forth some plans
and writing materials from his great-coat pocket and spread them
before him on the table. It was a thing he had done a hundred
times within the last week, and as he made his calculations again
and traced his route anew, his action showed the tinge of nervousness
to which the strongest natures at times must yield. Then he wrote
a letter, and, yawning deeply, he shut up the place and returned
to Galetti's.</p>
