<p>When Fatty Coon started off alone to find something more to eat, after
finishing the fish that his mother had brought home for him, he did not
know that he was going to have an adventure. He nosed about among the
bushes and the tall grasses and caught a few bugs and a frog or two. But
he didn't think that THAT was much. He didn't seem to have much luck,
down on the ground. So he climbed a tall hemlock, to see if he could
find a squirrel's nest, or some bird's eggs.
</p>
<p>Fatty loved to climb trees. Up in the big hemlock he forgot, for a time,
that he was still hungry. It was delightful to feel the branches swaying
under him, and the bright sunshine was warm upon his back. He climbed
almost to the very tip-top of the tree and wound himself around the
straight stem. The thick, springy branches held him safely, and soon
Fatty was fast asleep. Next to eating, Fatty loved sleeping. And now he
had a good nap.
</p><p>Fatty Coon woke up at last, yawned, and slowly unwound himself from the
stem of the tree. He was terribly hungry now. And he felt that he simply
MUST find something to eat at once.
</p><p>Without going down to the ground, Fatty climbed over into the top of
another big tree and his little beady, bright eyes began searching all
the branches carefully. Pretty soon Fatty smiled. He smiled because he
was pleased. And he was pleased because he saw exactly what he had been
looking for. Not far below him was a big nest, built of sticks and lined
with bark and moss. It was a crow's nest, Fatty decided, and he lost no
time in slipping down to the crotch of the tree where the nest was
perched.
</p><p>There were four white eggs in the nest--the biggest crow's eggs Fatty
had ever seen. And he began to eat them hungrily. His nose became
smeared with egg, but he didn't mind that at all. He kept thinking how
good the eggs tasted--and how he wished there were more of them.
</p><p>There was a sudden rush through the branches of the tall tree. And Fatty
Coon caught a hard blow on his head. He felt something sharp sink into
his back, too. And he clutched at the edge of the nest to keep from
falling.
</p><p>Fatty was surprised, to say the least, for he had never known crows to
fight like that. And he was frightened, because his back hurt. He
couldn't fight, because he was afraid he would fall if he let go of the
nest.
</p><p>There was nothing to do but run home as fast as he could. Fatty tried to
hurry; but there was that bird, beating and clawing his back, and
pulling him first one way and then another. He began to think he would
never reach home. But at last he came to the old poplar where his mother
lived. And soon, to his great joy, he reached the hole in the big
branch; and you may well believe that Fatty was glad to slip down into
the darkness where his mother, and his brother Blackie, and Fluffy and
Cutey his sisters, were all fast asleep. He was glad, because he knew
that no crow could follow him down there.
</p><p>Mrs. Coon waked up. She saw that Fatty's back was sadly torn (for coons,
you know, can see in the dark just as well as you can see in the
daylight).
</p><p>"What on earth is the matter?" she exclaimed.
</p><p>Poor Fatty told her. He cried a little, because his back hurt him, and
because he was so glad to be safe at home once more.
</p><p>"What color were those eggs?" Mrs. Coon inquired.
</p><p>"White!" said Fatty.
</p><p>"Ah, ha!" Mrs. Coon said. "Don't you remember that crows' eggs are a
blueish green? That must have been a goshawk's nest. And a goshawk is
the fiercest of all the hawks there are. It's no wonder your back is
clawed. Come here and let me look at it."
</p><p>Fatty Coon felt quite proud, as his mother examined the marks of the
goshawk's cruel claws. And he didn't feel half as sorry for himself as
you might think, for he remembered how good the eggs had tasted. He only
wished there had been a dozen of them.
