<p>Daylight showed us how solitary the inn stood. It was plainly
hard upon the sea, yet out of all view of it, and beset on every
side with scabbit hills of sand. There was, indeed, only one thing
in the nature of a prospect, where there stood out over a brae
the two sails of a windmill, like an ass’s ears, but with the
ass quite hidden. It was strange (after the wind rose, for at
first it was dead calm) to see the turning and following of each
other of these great sails behind the hillock. Scarce any road
came by there; but a number of footways travelled among the bents
in all directions up to Mr. Bazin’s door. The truth is, he was
a man of many trades, not any one of them honest, and the position
of his inn was the best of his livelihood. Smugglers frequented
it; political agents and forfeited persons bound across the water
came there to await their passages; and I daresay there was worse
behind, for a whole family might have been butchered in that house
and nobody the wiser.</p>

<p>I slept little and ill. Long ere it was day, I had slipped from
beside my bedfellow, and was warming myself at the fire or walking
to and fro before the door. Dawn broke mighty sullen; but a little
after, sprang up a wind out of the west, which burst the clouds,
let through the sun, and set the mill to the turning. There was
something of spring in the sunshine, or else it was in my heart;
and the appearing of the great sails one after another from behind
the hill, diverted me extremely. At times I could hear a creak
of the machinery; and by half-past eight of the day, and I thought
this dreary, desert place was like a paradise.</p>

<p>For all which, as the day drew on and nobody came near, I began
to be aware of an uneasiness that I could scarce explain. It seemed
there was trouble afoot; the sails of the windmill, as they came
up and went down over the hill, were like persons spying; and
outside of all fancy, it was surely a strange neighbourhood and
house for a young lady to be brought to dwell in.</p>

<p>At breakfast, which we took late, it was manifest that James
More was in some danger or perplexity; manifest that Alan was
alive to the same, and watched him close; and this appearance
of duplicity upon the one side, and vigilance upon the other,
held me on live coals. The meal was no sooner over than James
seemed to come began to make apologies. He had an appointment
of a private nature in the town (it was with the French nobleman,
he told me), and we would please excuse him till about noon. Meanwhile
he carried his daughter aside to the far end of the room, where
he seemed to speak rather earnestly and she to listen with much
inclination.</p>

<p>"I am caring less and less about this man James," said Alan.
"There’s something no right with the man James, and I shouldnae
wonder but what Alan Breck would give an eye to him this day.
I would like fine to see yon French nobleman, Davie; and I daresay
you could find an employ to yoursel, and that would be to speir
at the lassie for some news o’ your affair. Just tell it to her
plainly—tell her ye’re a muckle ass at the off-set; and then,
if I were you, and ye could do it naitural, I would just mint
to her I was in some kind of a danger; a’ weemenfolk likes that."</p>

<p>"I cannae lee, Alan, I cannae do it naitural," says I, mocking
him.</p>

<p>"The more fool you!" says he. "Then ye’ll can tell her that I
recommended it; that’ll set her to the laughing; and I wouldnae
wonder but what that was the next best. But see to the pair of
them! If I didnae feel just sure of the lassie, and that she was
awful pleased and chief with Alan, I would think there was some
kind of hocus-pocus about you."</p>

<p>"And is she so pleased with ye, then, Alan?" I asked.</p>

<p>"She thinks a heap of me," says he. "And I’m no like you: I’m
one that can tell. That she does—she thinks a heap of Alan. And
troth! I’m thinking a good deal of him mysel; and with your permission,
Shaws, I’ll be getting a wee yont amang the bents, so that I can
see what way James goes."</p>

<p>One after another went, till I was left alone beside the breakfast
table; James to Dunkirk, Alan dogging him, Catriona up the stairs
to her own chamber. I could very well understand how she should
avoid to be alone with me; yet was none the better pleased with
it for that, and bent my mind to entrap her to an interview before
the men returned. Upon the whole, the best appeared to me to do
like Alan. If I was out of view among the sandhills, the fine
morning would decoy her forth; and once I had her in the open,
I could please myself.</p>

<p>No sooner said than done; nor was I long under the bield of a
hillock before she appeared at the inn door, looked here and there,
and (seeing nobody) set out by a path that led directly seaward,
and by which I followed her. I was in no haste to make my presence
known; the further she went I made sure of the longer hearing
to my suit; and the ground being all sandy it was easy to follow
her unheard. The path rose and came at last to the head of a knowe.
Thence I had a picture for the first time of what a desolate wilderness
that inn stood hidden in; where was no man to be seen, nor any
house of man, except just Bazin’s and the windmill. Only a little
further on, the sea appeared and two or three ships upon it, pretty
as a drawing. One of these was extremely close in to be so great
a vessel; and I was aware of a shock of new suspicion, when I
recognised the trim of the <em>Seahorse</em>. What should an English
ship be doing so near in to France? Why was Alan brought into
her neighbourhood, and that in a place so far from any hope of
rescue? and was it by accident, or by design, that the daughter
of James More should walk that day to the seaside?</p>

<p>Presently I came forth behind her in the front of the sandhills
and above the beach. It was here long and solitary; with a man-o’-war’s
boat drawn up about the middle of the prospect, and an officer
in charge and pacing the sands like one who waited. I sat down
where the rough grass a good deal covered me, and looked for what
should follow. Catriona went straight to the boat; the officer
met her with civilities; they had ten words together; I saw a
letter changing hands; and there was Catriona returning. At the
same time, as if this were all her business on the Continent,
the boat shoved off and was headed for the <em>Seahorse</em>.
But I observed the officer to remain behind and disappear among
the bents.</p>

<p>I liked the business little; and the more I considered of it,
liked it less. Was it Alan the officer was seeking? or Catriona?
She drew near with her head down, looking constantly on the sand,
and made so tender a picture that I could not bear to doubt her
innocence. The next, she raised her face and recognised me; seemed
to hesitate, and then came on again, but more slowly, and I thought
with a changed colour. And at that thought, all else that was
upon my bosom—fears, suspicions, the care of my friend’s life—was
clean swallowed up; and I rose to my feet and stood waiting her
in a drunkenness of hope.</p>

<p>I gave her "good morning" as she came up, which she returned
with a good deal of composure.</p>

<p>"Will you forgive my having followed you?" said I.</p>

<p>"I know you are always meaning kindly," she replied; and then,
with a little outburst, "but why will you be sending money to
that man! It must not be."</p>

<p>"I never sent it for him," said I, "but for you, as you know
well."</p>

<p>"And you have no right to be sending it to either one of us,"
she said. "David, it is not right."</p>

<p>"It is not, it is all wrong," said I, "and I pray God he will
help this dull fellow (if it be at all possible) to make it better.
Catriona, this is no kind of life for you to lead; and I ask your
pardon for the word, but yon man is no fit father to take care
of you."</p>

<p>"Do not be speaking of him, even!" was her cry.</p>

<p>"And I need speak of him no more; it is not of him that I am
thinking, O, be sure of that!" says I. "I think of the one thing.
I have been alone now this long time in Leyden; and when I was
by way of at my studies, still I was thinking of that. Next Alan
came, and I went among soldier-men to their big dinners; and still
I had the same thought. And it was the same before, when I had
her there beside me. Catriona, do you see this napkin at my throat!
You cut a corner from it once and then cast it from you. They’re
<em>your</em> colours now; I wear them in my heart. My dear, I
cannot be wanting you. O, try to put up with me!"</p>

<p>I stepped before her so as to intercept her walking on.</p>

<p>"Try to put up with me," I was saying, "try and bear me with
a little."</p>

<p>Still she had never the word, and a fear began to rise in me
like a fear of death.</p>

<p>"Catriona," I cried, gazing on her hard, "is it a mistake again?
Am I quite lost?"</p>

<p>She raised her face to me, breathless.</p>

<p>"Do you want me, Davie, truly?" said she, and I scarce could
hear her say it.</p>

<p>"I do that," said I. "O, sure you know it—I do that."</p>

<p>"I have nothing left to give or to keep back," said she. "I was
all yours from the first day, if you would have had a gift of
me!" she said.</p>

<p>This was on the summit of a brae; the place was windy and conspicuous,
we were to be seen there even from the English ship; but I kneeled
down before her in the sand, and embraced her knees, and burst
into that storm of weeping that I thought it must have broken
me. All thought was wholly beaten from my mind by the vehemency
of my discomposure. I knew not where I was. I had forgot why I
was happy; only I knew she stooped, and I felt her cherish me
to her face and bosom, and heard her words out of a whirl.</p>

<p>"Davie," she was saying, "O, Davie, is this what you think of
me! Is it so that you were caring for poor me! O, Davie, Davie!"</p>

<p>With that she wept also, and our tears were commingled in a perfect
gladness.</p>

<p>It might have been ten in the day before I came to a clear sense
of what a mercy had befallen me; and sitting over against her,
with her hands in mine, gazed in her face, and laughed out loud
for pleasure like a child, and called her foolish and kind names.
I have never seen the place that looked so pretty as those bents
by Dunkirk; and the windmill sails, as they bobbed over the knowe,
were like a tune of music.</p>

<p>I know not how much longer we might have continued to forget
all else besides ourselves, had I not chanced upon a reference
to her father, which brought us to reality.</p>

<p>"My little friend," I was calling her again and again, rejoicing
to summon up the past by the sound of it, and to gaze across on
her, and to be a little distant—"My little friend, now you are
mine altogether; mine for good, my little friend and that man’s
no longer at all."</p>

<p>There came a sudden whiteness in her face, she plucked her hands
from mine.</p>

<p>"Davie, take me away from him!" she cried. "There’s something
wrong; he’s not true. There will be something wrong; I have a
dreadful terror here at my heart. What will he be wanting at all
events with that King’s ship? What will this word be saying?"
And she held the letter forth. "My mind misgives me, it will be
some ill to Alan. Open it, Davie—open it and see."</p>

<p>I took it, and looked at it, and shook my head.</p>

<p>"No," said I, "it goes against me, I cannot open a man’s letter."</p>

<p>"Not to save your friend?" she cried.</p>

<p>"I cannae tell," said I. "I think not. If I was only sure!"</p>

<p>"And you have but to break the seal!" said she.</p>

<p>"I know it," said I, "but the thing goes against me."</p>

<p>"Give it here," said she, "and I will open it myself."</p>

<p>"Nor you neither," said I. "You least of all. It concerns your
father, and his honour, dear, which we are both misdoubting. No
question but the place is dangerous-like, and the English ship
being here, and your father having word from it, and yon officer
that stayed ashore. He would not be alone either; there must be
more along with him; I daresay we are spied upon this minute.
Ay, no doubt, the letter should be opened; but somehow, not by
you nor me."</p>

<p>I was about thus far with it, and my spirit very much overcome
with a sense of danger and hidden enemies, when I spied Alan,
come back again from following James and walking by himself among
the sand-hills. He was in his soldier’s coat, of course, and mighty
fine; but I could not avoid to shudder when I thought how little
that jacket would avail him, if he were once caught and flung
in a skiff, and carried on board of the <em>Seahorse</em>, a deserter,
a rebel, and now a condemned murderer.</p>

<p>"There," said I, "there is the man that has the best right to
open it: or not, as he thinks fit."</p>

<p>With which I called upon his name, and we both stood up to be
a mark for him.</p>

<p>"If it is so—if it be more disgrace—will you can bear it?" she
asked, looking upon me with a burning eye.</p>

<p>"I was asked something of the same question when I had seen you
but the once," said I. "What do you think I answered? That if
I liked you as I thought I did—and O, but I like you better!—I
would marry you at his gallows’ foot."</p>

<p>The blood rose in her face; she came close up and pressed upon
me, holding my hand: and it was so that we awaited Alan.</p>

<p>He came with one of his queer smiles. "What was I telling ye,
David?" says he.</p>

<p>"There is a time for all things, Alan," said I, "and this time
is serious. How have you sped? You can speak out plain before
this friend of ours."</p>

<p>"I have been upon a fool’s errand," said he.</p>

<p>"I doubt we have done better than you, then," said I; "and, at
least, here is a great deal of matter that you must judge of.
Do you see that?" I went on, pointing to the ship. "That is the
<em>Seahorse</em>, Captain Palliser."</p>

<p>"I should ken her, too," says Alan. "I had fyke enough with her
when she was stationed in the Forth. But what ails the man to
come so close?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you why he came there first," said I. "It was to
bring this letter to James More. Why he stops here now that it’s
delivered, what it’s likely to be about, why there’s an officer
hiding in the bents, and whether or not it’s probable that he’s
alone—I would rather you considered for yourself."</p>

<p>"A letter to James More?" said he.</p>

<p>"The same," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, and I can tell ye more than that," said Alan. "For the
last night, when you were fast asleep, I heard the man colloguing
with some one in the French, and then the door of that inn to
be opened and shut."</p>

<p>"Alan!" cried I, "you slept all night, and I am here to prove
it."</p>

<p>"Ay, but I would never trust Alan whether he was asleep or waking!"
says he. "But the business looks bad. Let’s see the letter."</p>

<p>I gave it him.</p>

<p>"Catriona," said he, "you have to excuse me, my dear; but there’s
nothing less than my fine bones upon the cast of it, and I’ll
have to break this seal."</p>

<p>"It is my wish," said Catriona.</p>

<p>He opened it, glanced it through, and flung his hand in the air.</p>

<p>"The stinking brock!" says he, and crammed the paper in his pocket.
"Here, let’s get our things together. This place is fair death
to me." And he began to walk towards the inn.</p>

<p>It was Catriona that spoke the first. "He has sold you?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Sold me, my dear," said Alan. "But thanks to you and Davie,
I’ll can jink him yet. Just let me win upon my horse," he added.</p>

<p>"Catriona must come with us," said I. "She can have no more traffic
with that man. She and I are to be married." At which she pressed
my hand to her side.</p>

<p>"Are ye there with it?" says Alan, looking back. "The best day’s
work that ever either of you did yet! And I’m bound to say, my
dawtie, ye make a real, bonny couple."</p>

<p>The way that he was following brought us close in by the windmill,
where I was aware of a man in seaman’s trousers, who seemed to
be spying from behind it. Only, of course, we took him in the
rear.</p>

<p>"See, Alan!"</p>

<p>"Wheesht!" said, he, "this is my affairs."</p>

<p>The man was, no doubt, a little deafened by the clattering of
the mill, and we got up close before he noticed. Then he turned,
and we saw he was a big fellow with a mahogany face.</p>

<p>"I think, sir," says Alan, "that you speak the English?"</p>

<p>"<em>Non</em>, <em>monsieur</em>," says he, with an incredible
bad accent.</p>

<p>"<em>Non</em>, <em>monsieur</em>," cries Alan, mocking him. "Is
that how they learn you French on the <em>Seahorse</em>? Ye muckle,
gutsey hash, here’s a Scots boot to your English hurdies!"</p>

<p>And bounding on him before he could escape, he dealt the man
a kick that laid him on his nose. Then he stood, with a savage
smile, and watched him scramble to his feet and scamper off into
the sand-hills.</p>

<p>"But it’s high time I was clear of these empty bents!" said Alan;
and continued his way at top speed, and we still following, to
the backdoor of Bazin’s inn.</p>

<p>It chanced that as we entered by the one door we came face to
face with James More entering by the other.</p>

<p>"Here!" said I to Catriona, "quick! upstairs with you and make
your packets; this is no fit scene for you."</p>

<p>In the meanwhile James and Alan had met in the midst of the long
room. She passed them close by to reach the stairs; and after
she was some way up I saw her turn and glance at them again, though
without pausing. Indeed, they were worth looking at. Alan wore
as they met one of his best appearances of courtesy and friendliness,
yet with something eminently warlike, so that James smelled danger
off the man, as folk smell fire in a house, and stood prepared
for accidents.</p>

<p>Time pressed. Alan’s situation in that solitary place, and his
enemies about him, might have daunted Cæsar. It made no change
in him; and it was in his old spirit of mockery and daffing that
he began the interview.</p>

<p>"A braw good day to ye again, Mr. Drummond," said he. "What’ll
yon business of yours be just about?"</p>

<p>"Why, the thing being private, and rather of a long story," says
James, "I think it will keep very well till we have eaten."</p>

<p>"I’m none so sure of that," said Alan. "It sticks in my mind
it’s either now or never; for the fact is me and Mr. Balfour here
have gotten a line, and we’re thinking of the road."</p>

<p>I saw a little surprise in James’s eye; but he held himself stoutly.</p>

<p>"I have but the one word to say to cure you of that," said he,
"and that is the name of my business."</p>

<p>"Say it then," says Alan. "Hout! wha minds for Davie?"</p>

<p>"It is a matter that would make us both rich men," said James.</p>

<p>"Do you tell me that?" cries Alan.</p>

<p>"I do, sir," said James. "The plain fact is that it is Cluny’s
Treasure."</p>

<p>"No!" cried Alan. "Have ye got word of it?"</p>

<p>"I ken the place, Mr. Stewart, and can take you there," said
James.</p>

<p>"This crowns all!" says Alan. "Well, and I’m glad I came to Dunkirk.
And so this was your business, was it? Halvers, I’m thinking?"</p>

<p>"That is the business, sir," said James.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Alan; and then in the same tone of childlike
interest, "it has naething to do with the <em>Seahorse</em>, then?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"With what?" says James.</p>

<p>"Or the lad that I have just kicked the bottom of behind yon
windmill?" pursued Alan. "Hut, man! have done with your lees!
I have Palliser’s letter here in my pouch. You’re by with it,
James More. You can never show your face again with dacent folk."</p>

<p>James was taken all aback with it. He stood a second, motionless
and white, then swelled with the living anger.</p>

<p>"Do you talk to me, you bastard?" he roared out.</p>

<p>"Ye glee’d swine!" cried Alan, and hit him a sounding buffet
on the mouth, and the next wink of time their blades clashed together.</p>

<p>At the first sound of the bare steel I instinctively leaped back
from the collision. The next I saw, James parried a thrust so
nearly that I thought him killed; and it lowed up in my mind that
this was the girl’s father, and in a manner almost my own, and
I drew and ran in to sever them.</p>

<p>"Keep back, Davie! Are ye daft! Damn ye, keep back!" roared Alan.
"Your blood be on your ain heid then!"</p>

<p>I beat their blades down twice. I was knocked reeling against
the wall; I was back again betwixt them. They took no heed of
me, thrusting at each other like two furies. I can never think
how I avoided being stabbed myself or stabbing one of these two
Rodomonts, and the whole business turned about me like a piece
of a dream; in the midst of which I heard a great cry from the
stair, and Catriona sprang before her father. In the same moment
the point of my sword encountered some thing yielding. It came
back to me reddened. I saw the blood flow on the girl’s kerchief,
and stood sick.</p>

<p>"Will you be killing him before my eyes, and me his daughter
after all!" she cried.</p>

<p>"My dear, I have done with him," said Alan, and went, and sat
on a table, with his arms crossed and the sword naked in his hand.</p>

<p>Awhile she stood before the man, panting, with big eyes, then
swung suddenly about and faced him.</p>

<p>"Begone!" was her word, "take your shame out of my sight; leave
me with clean folk. I am a daughter of Alpin! Shame of the sons
of Alpin, begone!"</p>

<p>It was said with so much passion as awoke me from the horror
of my own bloodied sword. The two stood facing, she with the red
stain on her kerchief, he white as a rag. I knew him well enough—I
knew it must have pierced him in the quick place of his soul;
but he betook himself to a bravado air.</p>

<p>"Why," says he, sheathing his sword, though still with a bright
eye on Alan, "if this brawl is over I will but get my portmanteau—"</p>

<p>"There goes no pockmantie out of this place except with me,"
says Alan.</p>

<p>"Sir!" cries James.</p>

<p>"James More," says Alan, "this lady daughter of yours is to marry
my friend Davie, upon the which account I let you pack with a
hale carcase. But take you my advice of it and get that carcase
out of harm’s way or ower late. Little as you suppose it, there
are leemits to my temper."</p>

<p>"Be damned, sir, but my money’s there!" said James.</p>

<p>"I’m vexed about that, too," says Alan, with his funny face,
"but now, ye see, it’s mines." And then with more gravity, "Be
you advised, James More, you leave this house."</p>

<p>James seemed to cast about for a moment in his mind; but it’s
to be thought he had enough of Alan’s swordsmanship, for he suddenly
put off his hat to us and (with a face like one of the damned)
bade us farewell in a series. With which he was gone.</p>

<p>At the same time a spell was lifted from me.</p>

<p>"Catriona," I cried, "it was me—it was my sword. O, are you much
hurt?"</p>

<p>"I know it, Davie, I am loving you for the pain of it; it was
done defending that bad man, my father. See!" she said, and showed
me a bleeding scratch, "see, you have made a man of me now. I
will carry a wound like an old soldier."</p>

<p>Joy that she should be so little hurt, and the love of her brave
nature, supported me. I embraced her, I kissed the wound.</p>

<p>"And am I to be out of the kissing, me that never lost a chance?"
says Alan; and putting me aside and taking Catriona by either
shoulder, "My dear," he said, "you’re a true daughter of Alpin.
By all accounts, he was a very fine man, and he may weel be proud
of you. If ever I was to get married, it’s the marrow of you I
would be seeking for a mother to my sons. And I bear’s a king’s
name and speak the truth."</p>

<p>He said it with a serious heat of admiration that was honey to
the girl, and through her, to me. It seemed to wipe us clean of
all James More’s disgraces. And the next moment he was just himself
again.</p>

<p>"And now by your leave, my dawties," said he, "this is a’ very
bonny; but Alan Breck’ll be a wee thing nearer to the gallows
than he’s caring for; and Dod! I think this is a grand place to
be leaving."</p>

<p>The word recalled us to some wisdom. Alan ran upstairs and returned
with our saddle-bags and James More’s portmanteau; I picked up
Catriona’s bundle where she had dropped it on the stair; and we
were setting forth out of that dangerous house, when Bazin stopped
the way with cries and gesticulations. He had whipped under a
table when the swords were drawn, but now he was as bold as a
lion. There was his bill to be settled, there was a chair broken,
Alan had sat among his dinner things, James More had fled.</p>

<p>"Here," I cried, "pay yourself," and flung him down some Lewie
d’ors; for I thought it was no time to be accounting.</p>

<p>He sprang upon that money, and we passed him by, and ran forth
into the open. Upon three sides of the house were seamen hasting
and closing in; a little nearer to us James More waved his hat
as if to hurry them; and right behind him, like some foolish person
holding up his hands, were the sails of the windmill turning.</p>

<p>Alan gave but one glance, and laid himself down to run. He carried
a great weight in James More’s portmanteau; but I think he would
as soon have lost his life as cast away that booty which was his
revenge; and he ran so that I was distressed to follow him, and
marvelled and exulted to see the girl bounding at my side.</p>

<p>As soon as we appeared, they cast off all disguise upon the other
side; and the seamen pursued us with shouts and view-hullohs.
We had a start of some two hundred yards, and they were but bandy-legged
tarpaulins after all, that could not hope to better us at such
an exercise. I suppose they were armed, but did not care to use
their pistols on French ground. And as soon as I perceived that
we not only held our advantage but drew a little away, I began
to feel quite easy of the issue. For all which, it was a hot,
brisk bit of work, so long as it lasted; Dunkirk was still far
off; and when we popped over a knowe, and found a company of the
garrison marching on the other side on some manœuvre, I could
very well understand the word that Alan had.</p>

<p>He stopped running at once; and mopping at his brow, "They’re
a real bonny folk, the French nation," says he.</p>

<p><em>CONCLUSION</em></p>

<p>No sooner were we safe within the walls of Dunkirk than we held
a very necessary council-of-war on our position. We had taken
a daughter from her father at the sword’s point; any judge would
give her back to him at once, and by all likelihood clap me and
Alan into jail; and though we had an argument upon our side in
Captain Palliser’s letter, neither Catriona nor I were very keen
to be using it in public. Upon all accounts it seemed the most
prudent to carry the girl to Paris to the hands of her own chieftain,
Macgregor of Bohaldie, who would be very willing to help his kinswoman,
on the one hand, and not at all anxious to dishonour James upon
other.</p>

<p>We made but a slow journey of it up, for Catriona was not so
good at the riding as the running, and had scarce sat in the saddle
since the ’Forty-five. But we made it out at last, reached Paris
early of a Sabbath morning, and made all speed, under Alan’s guidance,
to find Bohaldie. He was finely lodged, and lived in a good style,
having a pension on the Scots Fund, as well as private means;
greeted Catriona like one of his own house, and seemed altogether
very civil and discreet, but not particularly open. We asked of
the news of James More. "Poor James!" said he, and shook his head
and smiled, so that I thought he knew further than he meant to
tell. Then we showed him Palliser’s letter, and he drew a long
face at that.</p>

<p>"Poor James!" said he again. "Well, there are worse folk than
James More, too. But this is dreadful bad. Tut, tut, he must have
forgot himself entirely! This is a most undesirable letter. But,
for all that, gentlemen, I cannot see what we would want to make
it public for. It’s an ill bird that fouls his own nest, and we
are all Scots folk and all Hieland."</p>

<p>Upon this we all agreed, save perhaps Alan; and still more upon
the question of our marriage, which Bohaldie took in his own hands,
as though there had been no such person as James More, and gave
Catriona away with very pretty manners and agreeable compliments
in French. It was not till all was over, and our healths drunk,
that he told us James was in that city, whither he had preceded
us some days, and where he now lay sick, and like to die. I thought
I saw by my wife’s face what way her inclination pointed.</p>

<p>"And let us go see him, then," said I.</p>

<p>"If it is your pleasure," said Catriona. These were early days.</p>

<p>He was lodged in the same quarter of the city with his chief,
in a great house upon a corner; and we were guided up to the garret
where he lay by the sound of Highland piping. It seemed he had
just borrowed a set of them from Bohaldie to amuse his sickness;
though he was no such hand as was his brother Rob, he made good
music of the kind; and it was strange to observe the French folk
crowding on the stairs, and some of them laughing. He lay propped
in a pallet. The first look of him I saw he was upon his last
business; and, doubtless, this was a strange place for him to
die in. But even now I find I can scarce dwell upon his end with
patience. Doubtless, Bohaldie had prepared him; he seemed to know
we were married, complimented us on the event, and gave us a benediction
like a patriarch.</p>

<p>"I have been never understood," said he. "I forgive you both
without an afterthought;" after which he spoke for all the world
in his old manner, was so obliging as to play us a tune or two
upon his pipes, and borrowed a small sum before I left.</p>

<p>I could not trace even a hint of shame in any part of his behaviour;
but he was great upon forgiveness; it seemed always fresh to him.
I think he forgave me every time we met; and when after some four
days he passed away in a kind of odour of affectionate sanctity,
I could have torn my hair out for exasperation. I had him buried;
but what to put upon his tomb was quite beyond me, till at last
I considered the date would look best alone.</p>

<p>I thought it wiser to resign all thoughts of Leyden, where we
had appeared once as brother and sister, and it would certainly
look strange to return in a new character. Scotland would be doing
for us; and thither, after I had recovered that which I had left
behind, we sailed in a Low Country ship.</p>

<p>And now, Miss Barbara Balfour (to set the ladies first), and
Mr. Alan Balfour younger of Shaws, here is the story brought fairly
to an end. A great many of the folk that took a part in it, you
will find (if you think well) that you have seen and spoken with.
Alison Hastie in Limekilns was the lass that rocked your cradle
when you were too small to know of it, and walked abroad with
you in the policy when you were bigger. That very fine great lady
that is Miss Barbara’s name-mamma is no other than the same Miss
Grant that made so much a fool of David Balfour in the house of
the Lord Advocate. And I wonder whether you remember a little,
lean, lively gentleman in a scratch-wig and a wraprascal, that
came to Shaws very late of a dark night, and whom you were awakened
out of your beds and brought down to the dining-hall to be presented
to, by the name of Mr. Jamieson? Or has Alan forgotten what he
did at Mr. Jamieson’s request—a most disloyal act—for which, by
the letter of the law, he might be hanged—no less than drinking
the king’s health <em>across the water</em>? These were strange
doings in a good Whig house! But Mr. Jamieson is a man privileged,
and might set fire to my corn-barn; and the name they know him
by now in France is the Chevalier Stewart.</p>

<p>As for Davie and Catriona, I shall watch you pretty close in
the next days, and see if you are so bold as to be laughing at
papa and mamma. It is true we were not so wise as we might have
been, and made a great deal of sorrow out of nothing; but you
will find as you grow up that even the artful Miss Barbara, and
even the valiant Mr. Alan, will be not so very much wiser than
their parents. For the life of man upon this world of ours is
a funny business. They talk of the angels weeping; but I think
they must more often be holding their sides as they look on; and
there was one thing I determined to do when I began this long
story, and that was to tell out everything as it befell.</p>
