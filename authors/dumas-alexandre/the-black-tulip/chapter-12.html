<P>Cornelius had not three hundred paces to walk outside the 
prison to reach the foot of the scaffold. At the bottom of 
the staircase, the dog quietly looked at him whilst he was 
passing; Cornelius even fancied he saw in the eyes of the 
monster a certain expression as it were of compassion.</P>
<P>The dog perhaps knew the condemned prisoners, and only bit 
those who left as free men.</P>
<P>The shorter the way from the door of the prison to the foot 
of the scaffold, the more fully, of course, it was crowded 
with curious people.</P>
<P>These were the same who, not satisfied with the blood which 
they had shed three days before, were now craving for a new 
victim.</P>
<P>And scarcely had Cornelius made his appearance than a fierce 
groan ran through the whole street, spreading all over the 
yard, and re-echoing from the streets which led to the 
scaffold, and which were likewise crowded with spectators.</P>
<P>The scaffold indeed looked like an islet at the confluence 
of several rivers.</P>
<P>In the midst of these threats, groans, and yells, Cornelius, 
very likely in order not to hear them, had buried himself in 
his own thoughts.</P>
<P>And what did he think of in his last melancholy journey?</P>
<P>Neither of his enemies, nor of his judges, nor of his 
executioners.</P>
<P>He thought of the beautiful tulips which he would see from 
heaven above, at Ceylon, or Bengal, or elsewhere, when he 
would be able to look with pity on this earth, where John 
and Cornelius de Witt had been murdered for having thought 
too much of politics, and where Cornelius van Baerle was 
about to be murdered for having thought too much of tulips.</P>
<P>&quot;It is only one stroke of the axe,&quot; said the philosopher to 
himself, &quot;and my beautiful dream will begin to be realised.&quot;</P>
<P>Only there was still a chance, just as it had happened 
before to M. de Chalais, to M. de Thou, and other slovenly 
executed people, that the headsman might inflict more than 
one stroke, that is to say, more than one martyrdom, on the 
poor tulip-fancier.</P>
<P>Yet, notwithstanding all this, Van Baerle mounted the 
scaffold not the less resolutely, proud of having been the 
friend of that illustrious John, and godson of that noble 
Cornelius de Witt, whom the ruffians, who were now crowding 
to witness his own doom, had torn to pieces and burnt three 
days before.</P>
<P>He knelt down, said his prayers, and observed, not without a 
feeling of sincere joy, that, laying his head on the block, 
and keeping his eyes open, he would be able to his last 
moment to see the grated window of the Buytenhof.</P>
<P>At length the fatal moment arrived, and Cornelius placed his 
chin on the cold damp block. But at this moment his eyes 
closed involuntarily, to receive more resolutely the 
terrible avalanche which was about to fall on his head, and 
to engulf his life.</P>
<P>A gleam like that of lightning passed across the scaffold: 
it was the executioner raising his sword.</P>
<P>Van Baerle bade farewell to the great black tulip, certain 
of awaking in another world full of light and glorious 
tints.</P>
<P>Three times he felt, with a shudder, the cold current of air 
from the knife near his neck, but what a surprise! he felt 
neither pain nor shock.</P>
<P>He saw no change in the colour of the sky, or of the world 
around him.</P>
<P>Then suddenly Van Baerle felt gentle hands raising him, and 
soon stood on his feet again, although trembling a little.</P>
<P>He looked around him. There was some one by his side, 
reading a large parchment, sealed with a huge seal of red 
wax.</P>
<P>And the same sun, yellow and pale, as it behooves a Dutch 
sun to be, was shining in the skies; and the same grated 
window looked down upon him from the Buytenhof; and the same 
rabble, no longer yelling, but completely thunderstruck, 
were staring at him from the streets below.</P>
<P>Van Baerle began to be sensible to what was going on around 
him.</P>
<P>His Highness, William, Prince of Orange, very likely afraid 
that Van Baerle's blood would turn the scale of judgment 
against him, had compassionately taken into consideration 
his good character, and the apparent proofs of his 
innocence.</P>
<P>His Highness, accordingly, had granted him his life.</P>
<P>Cornelius at first hoped that the pardon would be complete, 
and that he would be restored to his full liberty and to his 
flower borders at Dort.</P>
<P>But Cornelius was mistaken. To use an expression of Madame 
de Sevigne, who wrote about the same time, &quot;there was a 
postscript to the letter;&quot; and the most important part of 
the letter was contained in the postscript.</P>
<P>In this postscript, William of Orange, Stadtholder of 
Holland, condemned Cornelius van Baerle to imprisonment for 
life. He was not sufficiently guilty to suffer death, but he 
was too much so to be set at liberty.</P>
<P>Cornelius heard this clause, but, the first feeling of 
vexation and disappointment over, he said to himself,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Never mind, all this is not lost yet; there is some good in 
this perpetual imprisonment; Rosa will be there, and also my 
three bulbs of the black tulip are there.&quot;</P>
<P>But Cornelius forgot that the Seven Provinces had seven 
prisons, one for each, and that the board of the prisoner is 
anywhere else less expensive than at the Hague, which is a 
capital.</P>
<P>His Highness, who, as it seems, did not possess the means to 
feed Van Baerle at the Hague, sent him to undergo his 
perpetual imprisonment at the fortress of Loewestein, very 
near Dort, but, alas! also very far from it; for Loewestein, 
as the geographers tell us, is situated at the point of the 
islet which is formed by the confluence of the Waal and the 
Meuse, opposite Gorcum.</P>
<P>Van Baerle was sufficiently versed in the history of his 
country to know that the celebrated Grotius was confined in 
that castle after the death of Barneveldt; and that the 
States, in their generosity to the illustrious publicist, 
jurist, historian, poet, and divine, had granted to him for 
his daily maintenance the sum of twenty-four stivers.</P>
<P>&quot;I,&quot; said Van Baerle to himself, &quot;I am worth much less than 
Grotius. They will hardly give me twelve stivers, and I 
shall live miserably; but never mind, at all events I shall 
live.&quot;</P>
<P>Then suddenly a terrible thought struck him.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;how damp and misty that part of the 
country is, and the soil so bad for the tulips! And then 
Rosa will not be at Loewestein!&quot; </P></article>
