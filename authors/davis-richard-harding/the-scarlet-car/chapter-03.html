<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>During the last two weeks of the "whirlwind" campaign, automobiles had
carried the rival candidates to every election district in Greater New
York.
</p>
<p>During these two weeks, at the disposal of Ernest Peabody--on the
Reform Ticket, "the people's choice for Lieutenant-Governor--"
Winthrop had placed his Scarlet Car, and, as its chauffeur, himself.
</p><p>Not that Winthrop greatly cared for Reform, or Ernest Peabody.  The
"whirlwind" part of the campaign was what attracted him; the crowds,
the bands, the fireworks, the rush by night from hall to hall, from
Fordham to Tompkinsville.  And, while inside the different Lyceums,
Peabody lashed the Tammany Tiger, outside in his car, Winthrop was
making friends with Tammany policemen, and his natural enemies, the
bicycle cops.  To Winthrop, the day in which he did not increase his
acquaintance with the traffic squad, was a day lost.
</p><p>But the real reason for his efforts in the cause of Reform, was one he
could not declare.  And it was a reason that was guessed perhaps by
only one person.  On some nights Beatrice Forbes and her brother Sam
accompanied Peabody.  And while Peabody sat in the rear of the car,
mumbling the speech he would next deliver, Winthrop was given the
chance to talk with her.  These chances were growing cruelly few.  In
one month after election day Miss Forbes and Peabody would be man and
wife.  Once before the day of their marriage had been fixed, but, when
the Reform Party offered Peabody a high place on its ticket, he asked,
in order that he might bear his part in the cause of reform, that the
wedding be postponed.  To the postponement Miss Forbes made no
objection.  To one less self-centred than Peabody, it might have
appeared that she almost too readily consented.
</p><p>"I knew I could count upon your seeing my duty as I saw it," said
Peabody much pleased, "it always will be a satisfaction to both of us
to remember you never stood between me and my work for reform."
</p><p>"What do you think my brother-in-law-to-be has done now?" demanded Sam
of Winthrop, as the Scarlet Car swept into Jerome Avenue.  "He's
postponed his marriage with Trix just because he has a chance to be
Lieutenant-Governor.  What is a Lieutenant-Governor anyway, do you
know? I don't like to ask Peabody."
</p><p>"It is not his own election he's working for," said Winthrop.  He was
conscious of an effort to assume a point of view both noble and
magnanimous.
</p><p>"He probably feels the 'cause' calls him.  But, good Heavens!"
</p><p>"Look out!" shrieked Sam, "where you going?"
</p><p>Winthrop swung the car back into the avenue.
</p><p>"To think," he cried, "that a man who could marry--a girl, and then
would ask her to wait two months.  Or, two days!  Two months lost out
of his life, and she might die; he might lose her, she might change her
mind.  Any number of men can be Lieutenant-Governors; only one man can
be----"
</p><p>He broke off suddenly, coughed and fixed his eyes miserably on the
road.  After a brief pause, Brother Sam covertly looked at him.  Could
it be that "Billie" Winthrop, the man liked of all men, should love his
sister, and--that she should prefer Ernest Peabody?  He was deeply,
loyally indignant.  He determined to demand of his sister an immediate
and abject apology.
</p><p>At eight o'clock on the morning of election day, Peabody, in the
Scarlet Car, was on his way to vote.  He lived at Riverside Drive, and
the polling-booth was only a few blocks distant.  During the rest of
the day he intended to use the car to visit other election districts,
and to keep him in touch with the Reformers at the Gilsey House.
Winthrop was acting as his chauffeur, and in the rear seat was Miss
Forbes.  Peabody had asked her to accompany him to the polling-booth,
because he thought women who believed in reform should show their
interest in it in public, before all men.  Miss Forbes disagreed with
him, chiefly because whenever she sat in a box at any of the public
meetings the artists from the newspapers, instead of immortalizing the
candidate, made pictures of her and her hat.  After she had seen her
future lord and master cast his vote for reform and himself, she was to
depart by train to Tarrytown.  The Forbes's country place was there,
and for election day her brother Sam had invited out some of his
friends to play tennis.
</p><p>As the car darted and dodged up Eighth Avenue, a man who had been
hidden by the stairs to the Elevated, stepped in front of it.  It
caught him, and hurled him, like a mail-bag tossed from a train,
against one of the pillars that support the overhead tracks.  Winthrop
gave a cry and fell upon the brakes.  The cry was as full of pain as
though he himself had been mangled.  Miss Forbes saw only the man
appear, and then disappear, but, Winthrop's shout of warning, and the
wrench as the brakes locked, told her what had happened.  She shut her
eyes, and for an instant covered them with her hands.  On the front
seat Peabody clutched helplessly at the cushions.  In horror his eyes
were fastened on the motionless mass jammed against the pillar.
Winthrop scrambled over him, and ran to where the man lay.  So,
apparently, did every other inhabitant of Eighth Avenue; but Winthrop
was the first to reach him and kneeling in the car tracks, he tried to
place the head and shoulders of the body against the iron pillar.  He
had seen very few dead men; and to him, this weight in his arms, this
bundle of limp flesh and muddy clothes, and the purple-bloated face
with blood trickling down it, looked like a dead man.
</p><p>Once or twice when in his car, Death had reached for Winthrop, and only
by the scantiest grace had he escaped.  Then the nearness of it had
only sobered him.  Now that he believed he had brought it to a fellow
man, even though he knew he was in no degree to blame, the thought
sickened and shocked him.  His brain trembled with remorse and horror.
</p><p>But voices assailing him on every side brought him to the necessity of
the moment.  Men were pressing close upon him, jostling, abusing him,
shaking fists in his face.  Another crowd of men, as though fearing the
car would escape of its own volition, were clinging to the steps and
running boards.
</p><p>Winthrop saw Miss Forbes standing above them, talking eagerly to
Peabody, and pointing at him.  He heard children's shrill voices
calling to new arrivals that an automobile had killed a man; that it
had killed him on purpose.  On the outer edge of the crowd men shouted:
"Ah, soak him," "Kill him," "Lynch him."
</p><p>A soiled giant without a collar stooped over the purple, blood-stained
face, and then leaped upright, and shouted: "It's Jerry Gaylor, he's
killed old man Gaylor."
</p><p>The response was instant.  Every one seemed to know Jerry Gaylor.
</p><p>Winthrop took the soiled person by the arm.
</p><p>"You help me lift him into my car," he ordered.  "Take him by the
shoulders.  We must get him to a hospital."
</p><p>"To a hospital?  To the Morgue!" roared the man.  "And the police
station for yours.  You don't do no get-away."
</p><p>Winthrop answered him by turning to the crowd.  "If this man has any
friends here, they'll please help me put him in my car, and we'll take
him to Roosevelt Hospital."
</p><p>The soiled person shoved a fist and a bad cigar under Winthrop's nose.
</p><p>"Has he got any friends?" he mocked.  "Sure, he's got friends, and
they'll fix you, all right."
</p><p>"Sure!" echoed the crowd.
</p><p>The man was encouraged.
</p><p>"Don't you go away thinking you can come up here with your buzz wagon
and murder better men nor you'll ever be and----"
</p><p>"Oh, shut up!" said Winthrop.
</p><p>He turned his back on the soiled man, and again appealed to the crowd.
</p><p>"Don't stand there doing nothing," he commanded.  "Do you want this man
to die?  Some of you ring for an ambulance and get a policeman, or tell
me where is the nearest drug store."
</p><p>No one moved, but every one shouted to every one else to do as Winthrop
suggested.
</p><p>Winthrop felt something pulling at his sleeve, and turning, found
Peabody at his shoulder peering fearfully at the figure in the street.
He had drawn his cap over his eyes and hidden the lower part of his
face in the high collar of his motor coat. "I can't do anything, can
I?" he asked.
</p><p>"I'm afraid not," whispered  Winthrop.  "Go back to the car and don't
leave Beatrice.  I'll attend to this."
</p><p>"That's what I thought," whispered Peabody eagerly.  "I thought she and
I had better keep out of it."
</p><p>"Right!" exclaimed Winthrop.  "Go back and get Beatrice away."
</p><p>Peabody looked his relief, but still hesitated.
</p><p>"I can't do anything, as you say," he stammered, "and it's sure to get
in the 'extras,' and they'll be out in time to lose us thousands of
votes, and though no one is to blame, they're sure to blame me.  I
don't care about myself," he added eagerly, "but the very morning of
election--half the city has not voted yet--the Ticket----"
</p><p>"Damn the Ticket!" exclaimed Winthrop.  "The man's dead!"
</p><p>Peabody, burying his face still deeper in his collar, backed into the
crowd.  In the present and past campaigns, from carts and automobiles
he had made many speeches in Harlem, and on the West Side, lithographs
of his stern, resolute features hung in every delicatessen shop, and
that he might be recognized, was extremely likely.
</p><p>He whispered to Miss Forbes what he had said, and what Winthrop had
said.
</p><p>"But you DON'T mean to leave him," remarked Miss Forbes.
</p><p>"I must," returned Peabody.  "I can do nothing for the man, and you
know how Tammany will use this--They'll have it on the street by ten.
They'll say I was driving recklessly; without regard for human life.
And, besides, they're waiting for me at headquarters.  Please hurry.  I
am late now."
</p><p>Miss Forbes gave an exclamation of surprise.
</p><p>"Why, I'm not going," she said.
</p><p>"You must go! _I_ must go.  You can't remain here alone."
</p><p>Peabody spoke in the quick, assured tone that at the first had
convinced Miss Forbes his was a most masterful manner.
</p><p>"Winthrop, too," he added, "wants you to go away."
</p><p>Miss Forbes made no reply.  But she looked at Peabody inquiringly,
steadily, as though she were puzzled as to his identity, as though he
had just been introduced to her.  It made him uncomfortable.
</p><p>"Are you coming?" he asked.
</p><p>Her answer was a question.
</p><p>"Are you going?"
</p><p>"I am!" returned Peabody.  He added sharply:  "I must."
</p><p>"Good-by," said Miss Forbes.
</p><p>As he ran up the steps to the station of the elevated, it seemed to
Peabody that the tone of her "good-by" had been most unpleasant.  It
was severe, disapproving.  It had a final, fateful sound.  He was
conscious of a feeling of self-dissatisfaction.  In not seeing the
political importance of his not being mixed up with this accident,
Winthrop had been peculiarly obtuse, and Beatrice, unsympathetic.
Until he had cast his vote for Reform, he felt distinctly ill-used.
</p><p>For a moment Beatrice Forbes sat in the car motionless, staring
unseeingly at the iron steps by which Peabody had disappeared.  For a
few moments her brows were tightly drawn.  Then, having apparently
quickly arrived at some conclusion, she opened the door of the car and
pushed into the crowd.
</p><p>Winthrop received her most rudely.
</p><p>"You mustn't come here!" he cried.
</p><p>"I thought," she stammered, "you might want some one?"
</p><p>"I told--" began Winthrop, and then stopped, and added--"to take you
away.  Where is he?"
</p><p>Miss Forbes flushed slightly.
</p><p>"He's gone," she said.
</p><p>In trying not to look at Winthrop, she saw the fallen figure,
motionless against the pillar, and with an exclamation, bent fearfully
toward it.
</p><p>"Can I do anything?" she asked.
</p><p>The crowd gave way for her, and with curious pleased faces, closed in
again eagerly.  She afforded them a new interest.
</p><p>A young man in the uniform of an ambulance surgeon was kneeling beside
the mud-stained figure, and a police officer was standing over both.
The ambulance surgeon touched lightly the matted hair from which the
blood escaped, stuck his finger in the eye of the prostrate man, and
then with his open hand slapped him across the face.
</p><p>"Oh!" gasped Miss Forbes.
</p><p>The young doctor heard her, and looking up, scowled reprovingly.
Seeing she was a rarely beautiful young woman, he scowled less
severely; and then deliberately and expertly, again slapped Mr. Jerry
Gaylor on the cheek.  He watched the white mark made by his hand upon
the purple skin, until the blood struggled slowly back to it, and then
rose.
</p><p>He ignored every one but the police officer.
</p><p>"There's nothing the matter with HIM," he said.  "He's dead drunk."
</p><p>The words came to Winthrop with such abrupt relief, bearing so
tremendous a burden of gratitude, that his heart seemed to fail him.
In his suddenly regained happiness, he unconsciously laughed.
</p><p>"Are you sure?" he asked eagerly.  "I thought I'd killed him."
</p><p>The surgeon looked at Winthrop coldly.
</p><p>"When they're like that," he explained with authority, "you can't hurt
'em if you throw them off the Times Building."
</p><p>He condescended to recognize the crowd.  "You know where this man
lives?"
</p><p>Voices answered that Mr. Gaylor lived at the corner, over the saloon.
The voices showed a lack of sympathy.  Old man Gaylor dead was a
novelty; old man Gaylor drunk was not.
</p><p>The doctor's prescription was simple and direct.
</p><p>"Put him to bed till he sleeps it off," he ordered; he swung himself to
the step of the ambulance.  "Let him out, Steve," he called.  There was
the clang of a gong and the rattle of galloping hoofs.
</p><p>The police officer approached Winthrop.  "They tell me Jerry stepped in
front of your car; that you wasn't to blame.  I'll get their names and
where they live.  Jerry might try to hold you up for damages."
</p><p>"Thank you very much," said Winthrop.
</p><p>With several of Jerry's friends, and the soiled person, who now seemed
dissatisfied that Jerry was alive, Winthrop helped to carry him up one
flight of stairs and drop him upon a bed.
</p><p>"In case he needs anything," said Winthrop, and gave several bills to
the soiled person, upon whom immediately Gaylor's other friends closed
in.  "And I'll send my own doctor at once to attend to him."
</p><p>"You'd better," said the soiled person morosely, "or, he'll try to
shake you down."
</p><p>The opinions as to what might be Mr. Gaylor's next move seemed
unanimous.
</p><p>From the saloon below, Winthrop telephoned to the family doctor, and
then rejoined Miss Forbes and the Police officer.  The officer gave him
the names of those citizens who had witnessed the accident, and in
return received Winthrop's card.
</p><p>"Not that it will go any further," said the officer reassuringly.
"They're all saying you acted all right and wanted to take him to
Roosevelt.  There's many," he added with sententious indignation, "that
knock a man down, and then run away without waiting to find out if
they've hurted 'em or killed 'em."
</p><p>The speech for both Winthrop and Miss Forbes was equally embarrassing.
</p><p>"You don't say?" exclaimed Winthrop nervously.  He shook the
policeman's hand.  The handclasp was apparently satisfactory to that
official, for he murmured "Thank you," and stuck something in the
lining of his helmet.  "Now, then!" Winthrop said briskly to Miss
Forbes, "I think we have done all we can.  And we'll get away from this
place a little faster than the law allows."
</p><p>Miss Forbes had seated herself in the car, and Winthrop was cranking
up, when the same policeman, wearing an anxious countenance, touched
him on the arm.  "There is a gentleman here," he said, "wants to speak
to you."  He placed himself between the gentleman and Winthrop and
whispered:  "He's 'Izzy' Schwab, he's a Harlem police-court lawyer and
a Tammany man.  He's after something, look out for him."
</p><p>Winthrop saw, smiling at him ingratiatingly, a slight, slim youth, with
beady, rat-like eyes, a low forehead, and a Hebraic nose.  He wondered
how it had been possible for Jerry Gaylor to so quickly secure counsel.
But Mr. Schwab at once undeceived him.
</p><p>"I'm from the Journal," he began, "not regular on the staff, but I send
'em Harlem items, and the court reporter treats me nice, see!  Now
about this accident; could you give me the name of the young lady?"
</p><p>He smiled encouragingly at Miss Forbes.
</p><p>"I could not!" growled Winthrop.  "The man wasn't hurt, the policeman
will tell you so.  It is not of the least public interest."
</p><p>With a deprecatory shrug, the young man smiled knowingly.
</p><p>"Well, mebbe not the lady's name," he granted, "but the name of the
OTHER gentleman who was with you, when the accident occurred."  His
black, rat-like eyes snapped.  "I think HIS name would be of public
interest."
</p><p>To gain time Winthrop stepped into the driver's seat.  He looked at Mr.
Schwab steadily.
</p><p>"There was no other gentleman," he said.  "Do you mean my chauffeur?"
Mr. Schwab gave an appreciative chuckle.
</p><p>"No, I don't mean your chauffeur," he mimicked.  "I mean," he declared
theatrically in his best police-court manner, "the man who to-day is
hoping to beat Tammany, Ernest Peabody!"
</p><p>Winthrop stared at the youth insolently.
</p><p>"I don't understand you," he said.
</p><p>"Oh, of course not!" jeered "Izzy" Schwab.  He moved excitedly from
foot to foot.  "Then who WAS the other man," he demanded, "the man who
ran away?"
</p><p>Winthrop felt the blood rise to his face.  That Miss Forbes should hear
this rat of a man, sneering at the one she was to marry, made him hate
Peabody.  But he answered easily:
</p><p>"No one ran away.  I told my chauffeur to go and call up an ambulance.
That was the man you saw."
</p><p>As when "leading on" a witness to commit himself, Mr. Schwab smiled
sympathetically.
</p><p>"And he hasn't got back yet," he purred, "has he?"
</p><p>"No, and I'm not going to wait for him," returned Winthrop.  He reached
for the clutch, but Mr. Schwab jumped directly in front of the car.
</p><p>"Was he looking for a telephone when he ran up the elevated steps?" he
cried.
</p><p>He shook his fists vehemently.
</p><p>"Oh, no, Mr. Winthrop, it won't do--you make a good witness.  I
wouldn't ask for no better, but, you don't fool 'Izzy' Schwab."
</p><p>"You're mistaken, I tell you," cried Winthrop desperately.  "He may
look like--like this man you speak of, but no Peabody was in this car."
</p><p>"Izzy" Schwab wrung his hands hysterically.
</p><p>"No, he wasn't!" he cried, "because he run away!  And left an old man
in the street--dead, for all he knowed--nor cared neither.  Yah!"
shrieked the Tammany heeler.  "HIM a Reformer, yah!"
</p><p>"Stand away from my car," shouted Winthrop, "or you'll get hurt."
</p><p>"Yah, you'd like to, wouldn't you?" returned Mr. Schwab, leaping,
nimbly to one side.  "What do you think the Journal'll give me for that
story, hey?  'Ernest Peabody, the Reformer, Kills an Old Man, AND RUNS
AWAY.'  And hiding his face, too!  I seen him.  What do you think that
story's worth to Tammany, hey?  It's worth twenty thousand votes!" The
young man danced in front of the car triumphantly, mockingly, in a
frenzy of malice.  "Read the extras, that's all," he taunted.  "Read
'em in an hour from now!"
</p><p>Winthrop glared at the shrieking figure with fierce, impotent rage;
then, with a look of disgust, he flung the robe off his knees and rose.
Mr. Schwab, fearing bodily injury, backed precipitately behind the
policeman.
</p><p>"Come here," commanded Winthrop softly.  Mr. Schwab warily approached.
"That story," said Winthrop, dropping his voice to a low whisper, "is
worth a damn sight more to you than twenty thousand votes.  You take a
spin with me up Riverside Drive where we can talk.  Maybe you and I can
'make a little business.'"
</p><p>At the words, the face of Mr. Schwab first darkened angrily, and then,
lit with such exultation that it appeared as though Winthrop's efforts
had only placed Peabody deeper in Mr. Schwab's power.  But the rat-like
eyes wavered, there was doubt in them, and greed, and, when they turned
to observe if any one could have heard the offer, Winthrop felt the
trick was his.  It was apparent that Mr. Schwab was willing to
arbitrate.
</p><p>He stepped gingerly into the front seat, and as Winthrop leaned over
him and tucked and buckled the fur robe around his knees, he could not
resist a glance at his friends on the sidewalk.  They were grinning
with wonder and envy, and as the great car shook itself, and ran easily
forward, Mr. Schwab leaned back and carelessly waved his hand.  But his
mind did not waver from the purpose of his ride.  He was not one to be
cajoled with fur rugs and glittering brass.
</p><p>"Well, Mr. Winthrop," he began briskly.  "You want to say something?
You must be quick--every minute's money."
</p><p>"Wait till we're out of the traffic," begged Winthrop anxiously "I
don't want to run down any more old men, and I wouldn't for the world
have anything happen to you, Mr.--" He paused politely.
</p><p>"Schwab--Isadore Schwab."
</p><p>"How did you know MY name?" asked Winthrop.
</p><p>"The card you gave the police officer"
</p><p>"I see," said Winthrop.  They were silent while the car swept swiftly
west, and Mr. Schwab kept thinking that for a young man who was afraid
of the traffic, Winthrop was dodging the motor cars, beer vans, and
iron pillars, with a dexterity that was criminally reckless.
</p><p>At that hour Riverside Drive was empty, and after a gasp of relief, Mr.
Schwab resumed the attack.
</p><p>"Now, then," he said sharply, "don't go any further.  What is this you
want to talk about?"
</p><p>"How much will the Journal give you for this story of yours?" asked
Winthrop.
</p><p>Mr. Schwab smiled mysteriously.
</p><p>"Why?" he asked.
</p><p>"Because," said Winthrop, "I think I could offer you something better."
</p><p>"You mean," said the police-court lawyer cautiously, "you will make it
worth my while not to tell the truth about what I saw?"
</p><p>"Exactly," said Winthrop.
</p><p>"That's all!  Stop the car," cried Mr. Schwab.  His manner was
commanding.  It vibrated with triumph.  His eyes glistened with wicked
satisfaction.
</p><p>"Stop the car?" demanded Winthrop, "what do you mean?"
</p><p>"I mean," said Mr. Schwab dramatically, "that I've got you where I want
you, thank you.  You have killed Peabody dead as a cigar butt!  Now I
can tell them how his friends tried to bribe me.  Why do you think I
came in your car?  For what money YOU got?  Do you think you can stack
up your roll against the New York Journal's, or against Tammany's?"
His shrill voice rose exultantly.  "Why, Tammany ought to make me judge
for this!  Now, let me down here," he commanded, "and next time, don't
think you can take on 'Izzy' Schwab and get away with it."
</p><p>They were passing Grant's Tomb, and the car was moving at a speed that
Mr. Schwab recognized was in excess of the speed limit.
</p><p>"Do you hear me?" he demanded, "let me down!"
</p><p>To his dismay Winthrop's answer was in some fashion to so juggle with
the shining brass rods that the car flew into greater speed.  To "Izzy"
Schwab it seemed to scorn the earth, to proceed by leaps and jumps.
But, what added even more to his mental discomfiture was, that Winthrop
should turn, and slowly and familiarly wink at him.
</p><p>As through the window of an express train, Mr. Schwab saw the white
front of Claremont, and beyond it the broad sweep of the Hudson.  And,
then, without decreasing its speed, the car like a great bird, swept
down a hill, shot under a bridge, and into a partly paved street.  Mr.
Schwab already was two miles from his own bailiwick.  His surroundings
were unfamiliar.  On the one hand were newly erected, untenanted flat
houses with the paint still on the window panes, and on the other side,
detached villas, a roadhouse, an orphan asylum, a glimpse of the Hudson.
</p><p>"Let me out," yelled Mr. Schwab, "what you trying to do?  Do you think
a few blocks'll make any difference to a telephone?  You think you're
damned smart, don't you?  But you won't feel so fresh when I get on the
long distance.  You let me down," he threatened, "or, I'll----"
</p><p>With a sickening skidding of wheels, Winthrop whirled the car round a
corner and into the Lafayette Boulevard, that for miles runs along the
cliff of the Hudson.
</p><p>"Yes," asked Winthrop, "WHAT will you do?"
</p><p>On one side was a high steep bank, on the other many trees, and through
them below, the river.  But there were no houses, and at half-past
eight in the morning those who later drive upon the boulevard were
still in bed.
</p><p>"WHAT will you do?" repeated Winthrop.
</p><p>Miss Forbes, apparently as much interested in Mr. Schwab's answer as
Winthrop, leaned forward.  Winthrop raised his voice above the whir of
flying wheels, the rushing wind and scattering pebbles.
</p><p>"I asked you into this car," he shouted, "because I meant to keep you
in it until I had you where you couldn't do any mischief.  I told you
I'd give you something better than the Journal would give you, and I am
going to give you a happy day in the country.  We're now on our way to
this lady's house.  You are my guest, and you can play golf, and
bridge, and the piano, and eat and drink until the polls close, and
after that you can go to the devil.  If you jump out at this speed, you
will break your neck.  And, if I have to slow up for anything, and you
try to get away, I'll go after you--it doesn't matter where it is--and
break every bone in your body."
</p><p>"Yah! you can't!" shrieked Mr. Schwab.  "You can't do it!" The madness
of the flying engines had got upon his nerves.  Their poison was
surging in his veins.  He knew he had only to touch his elbow against
the elbow of Winthrop, and he could throw the three of them into
eternity.  He was travelling on air, uplifted, defiant, carried beyond
himself.
</p><p>"I can't do what?" asked Winthrop.
</p><p>The words reached Schwab from an immeasurable distance, as from another
planet, a calm, humdrum planet on which events moved in commonplace,
orderly array.  Without a jar, with no transition stage, instead of
hurtling through space, Mr. Schwab found himself luxuriously seated in
a cushioned chair, motionless, at the side of a steep bank.  For a mile
before him stretched an empty road.  And, beside him in the car, with
arms folded calmly on the wheel there glared at him a grim, alert young
man.
</p><p>"I can't do what?" growled the young man.
</p><p>A feeling of great loneliness fell upon "Izzy" Schwab.  Where were now
those officers, who in the police courts were at his beck and call?
Where the numbered houses, the passing surface cars, the sweating
multitudes of Eighth Avenue?  In all the world he was alone, alone on
an empty country road, with a grim, alert young man.
</p><p>"When I asked you how you knew my name," said the young man, "I thought
you knew me as having won some races in Florida last winter.  This is
the car that won.  I thought maybe you might have heard of me when I
was captain of a football team at--a university.  If you have any idea
that you can jump from this car and not be killed, or, that I cannot
pound you into a pulp, let me prove to you you're wrong--now.  We're
quite alone.  Do you wish to get down?"
</p><p>"No," shrieked Schwab, "I won't!"  He turned appealingly to the young
lady.  "You're a witness," he cried.  "If he assaults me, he's liable.
I haven't done nothing."
</p><p>"We're near Yonkers," said the young man, "and if you try to take
advantage of my having to go slow through the town, you know now what
will happen to you."
</p><p>Mr. Schwab having instantly planned on reaching Yonkers, to leap from
the car into the arms of the village constable, with suspicious
alacrity, assented.  The young man regarded him doubtfully.
</p><p>"I'm afraid I'll have to show you," said the young man.  He laid two
fingers on Mr. Schwab's wrist; looking at him, as he did so, steadily
and thoughtfully, like a physician feeling a pulse.  Mr. Schwab
screamed.  When he had seen policemen twist steel nippers on the wrists
of prisoners, he had thought, when the prisoners shrieked and writhed,
they were acting.
</p><p>He now knew they were not.
</p><p>"Now, will you promise?" demanded the grim young man.
</p><p>"Yes," gasped Mr. Schwab.  "I'll sit still.  I won't do nothing."
</p><p>"Good," muttered Winthrop.
</p><p>A troubled voice that carried to the heart of Schwab a promise of
protection, said:  "Mr. Schwab, would you be more comfortable back here
with me?"
</p><p>Mr. Schwab turned two terrified eyes in the direction of the voice.  He
saw the beautiful young lady regarding him kindly, compassionately;
with just a suspicion of a smile.  Mr. Schwab instantly scrambled to
safety over the front seat into the body of the car.  Miss Forbes made
way for the prisoner beside her and he sank back with a nervous,
apologetic sigh.  The alert young man was quick to follow the lead of
the lady.
</p><p>"You'll find caps and goggles in the boot, Schwab," he said hospitably.
"You had better put them on.  We are going rather fast now."  He
extended a magnificent case of pigskin, that bloomed with fat black
cigars.  "Try one of these," said the hospitable young man.  The
emotions that swept Mr. Schwab he found difficult to pursue, but he
raised his hat to the lady.  "May I, Miss?" he said.
</p><p>"Certainly," said the lady.
</p><p>There was a moment of delay while with fingers that slightly trembled,
Mr. Schwab selected an amazing green cap and lit his cigar; and then
the car swept forward, singing and humming happily, and scattering the
autumn leaves.  The young lady leaned toward him with a book in a
leather cover.  She placed her finger on a twisting red line that
trickled through a page of type.
</p><p>"We're just here," said the young lady, "and we ought to reach home,
which is just about there, in an hour."
</p><p>"I see," said Schwab.  But all he saw was a finger in a white glove,
and long eyelashes tangled in a gray veil.
</p><p>For many minutes, or for all Schwab knew, for many miles, the young
lady pointed out to him the places along the Hudson, of which he had
read in the public school history, and quaint old manor houses set in
glorious lawns; and told him who lived in them.  Schwab knew the names
as belonging to down-town streets, and up-town clubs.  He became
nervously humble, intensely polite, he felt he was being carried as an
honored guest into the very heart of the Four Hundred, and when the car
jogged slowly down the main street of Yonkers, although a policeman
stood idly within a yard of him, instead of shrieking to him for help,
"Izzy" Schwab looked at him scornfully across the social gulf that
separated them, with all the intolerance he believed becoming in the
upper classes.
</p><p>"Those bicycle cops," he said confidentially to Miss Forbes, "are too
chesty."
</p><p>The car turned in between stone pillars, and under an arch of red and
golden leaves, and swept up a long avenue to a house of innumerable
roofs.  It was the grandest house Mr. Schwab had ever entered, and when
two young men in striped waistcoats and many brass buttons ran down the
stone steps and threw open the door of the car, his heart fluttered
between fear and pleasure.
</p><p>Lounging before an open fire in the hall were a number of young men,
who welcomed Winthrop delightedly and, to all of whom Mr. Schwab was
formally presented.  As he was introduced he held each by the hand and
elbow and said impressively, and much to the other's embarrassment,
"WHAT name, please?"
</p><p>Then one of the servants conducted him to a room opening on the hall,
from whence he heard stifled exclamations and laughter, and some one
saying "Hush."  But "Izzy" Schwab did not care.  The slave in brass
buttons was proffering him ivory-backed hair-brushes, and obsequiously
removing the dust from his coat collar.  Mr. Schwab explained to him
that he was not dressed for automobiling, as Mr. Winthrop had invited
him quite informally.  The man was most charmingly sympathetic.  And
when he returned to the hall every one received him with the most
genial, friendly interest.  Would he play golf, or tennis, or pool, or
walk over the farm, or just look on?  It seemed the wish of each to be
his escort.  Never had he been so popular.
</p><p>He said he would "just look on."  And so, during the last and decisive
day of the "whirlwind" campaign, while in Eighth Avenue voters were
being challenged, beaten, and bribed, bonfires were burning, and
"extras" were appearing every half hour, "Izzy" Schwab, the Tammany
henchman, with a secret worth twenty thousand votes, sat a prisoner, in
a wicker chair, with a drink and a cigar, guarded by four young men in
flannels, who played tennis violently at five dollars a corner.
</p><p>It was always a great day in the life of "Izzy" Schwab.  After a
luncheon, which, as he later informed his friends, could not have cost
less than "two dollars a plate and drink all you like," Sam Forbes took
him on at pool.  Mr. Schwab had learned the game in the cellars of
Eighth Avenue at two and a half cents a cue, and now, even in Columbus
Circle he was a star.  So, before the sun had set, Mr. Forbes, who at
pool rather fancied himself, was seventy-five dollars poorer, and Mr.
Schwab just that much to the good.  Then there followed a strange
ceremony called tea, or, if you preferred it, whiskey and soda; and the
tall footman bent before him with huge silver salvers laden down with
flickering silver lamps, and bubbling soda bottles, and cigars, and
cigarettes.
</p><p>"You could have filled your pockets with twenty-five cent Havanas, and
nobody would have said nothing!" declared Mr. Schwab, and his friends
who never had enjoyed his chance to study at such close quarters the
truly rich, nodded enviously.
</p><p>At six o'clock Mr. Schwab led Winthrop into the big library and asked
for his ticket of leave.
</p><p>"They'll be counting the votes soon," he begged.  "I can't do no harm
now, and I don't mean to.  I didn't see nothing, and I won't say
nothing.  But it's election night, and--and I just GOT to be on
Broadway."
</p><p>"Right," said Winthrop, "I'll have a car take you in, and if you will
accept this small check----"
</p><p>"No!" roared "Izzy" Schwab.  Afterward he wondered how he came to do
it.  "You've give me a good time, Mr. Winthrop.  You've treated me
fine, all the gentlemen have treated me nice.  I'm not a blackmailer,
Mr. Winthrop."  Mr. Schwab's voice shook slightly.
</p><p>"Nonsense, Schwab, you didn't let me finish," said Winthrop, "I'm
likely to need a lawyer any time; this is a retaining fee.  Suppose I
exceed the speed limit--I'm liable to do that----"
</p><p>"You bet you are!" exclaimed Mr. Schwab violently.
</p><p>"Well, then, I'll send for YOU, and there isn't a police magistrate,
nor any of the traffic squad, you can't handle, is there?"
</p><p>Mr. Schwab flushed with pleasure.
</p><p>"You can count on me," he vowed, "and your friends too, and the
ladies," he added gallantly.  "If ever the ladies want to get bail,
tell 'em to telephone for 'Izzy' Schwab.  Of course," he said
reluctantly, "if it's a retaining fee----"
</p><p>But when he read the face of the check he exclaimed in protest.  "But,
Mr. Winthrop, this is more than the Journal would have give me!"
</p><p>They put him in a car belonging to one of the other men, and all came
out on the steps to wave him "good-by," and he drove magnificently into
his own district, where there were over a dozen men who swore he tipped
the French chauffeur a five dollar bill "just like it was a cigarette."
</p><p>All of election day since her arrival in Winthrop's car, Miss Forbes
had kept to herself.  In the morning, when the other young people were
out of doors, she remained in her room, and after luncheon when they
gathered round the billiard table, she sent for her cart and drove off
alone.  The others thought she was concerned over the possible result
of the election, and did not want to disturb them by her anxiety.
Winthrop, thinking the presence of Schwab embarrassed her, recalling as
it did Peabody's unfortunate conduct of the morning, blamed himself for
bringing Schwab to the house.  But he need not have distressed himself.
Miss Forbes was thinking neither of Schwab nor Peabody, nor was she
worried or embarrassed.  On the contrary, she was completely happy.
</p><p>When that morning she had seen Peabody running up the steps of the
Elevated, all the doubts, the troubles, questions, and misgivings that
night and day for the last three months had upset her, fell from her
shoulders like the pilgrim's heavy pack.  For months she had been
telling herself that the unrest she felt when with Peabody was due to
her not being able to appreciate the importance of those big affairs in
which he was so interested; in which he was so admirable a figure.  She
had, as she supposed, loved him, because he was earnest, masterful,
intent of purpose.  His had seemed a fine character.  When she had
compared him with the amusing boys of her own age, the easy-going
joking youths to whom the betterment of New York was of no concern, she
had been proud in her choice.  She was glad Peabody was ambitious.  She
was ambitious for him.  She was glad to have him consult her on those
questions of local government, to listen to his fierce, contemptuous
abuse of Tammany.  And yet early in their engagement she had missed
something, something she had never known, but which she felt sure
should exist.  Whether she had seen it in the lives of others, or read
of it in romances, or whether it was there because it was nature to
desire to be loved, she did not know.  But long before Winthrop
returned from his trip round the world, in her meetings with the man
she was to marry, she had begun to find that there was something
lacking.  And Winthrop had shown her that this something lacking was
the one thing needful.  When Winthrop had gone abroad he was only one
of her brother's several charming friends.  One of the amusing merry
youths who came and went in the house as freely as Sam himself.  Now,
after two years' absence, he refused to be placed in that category.
</p><p>He rebelled on the first night of his return.  As she came down to the
dinner of welcome her brother was giving Winthrop, he stared at her as
though she were a ghost, and said, so solemnly that every one in the
room, even Peabody, smiled: "Now I know why I came home."  That he
refused to recognize her engagement to Peabody, that on every occasion
he told her, or by some act showed her, he loved her; that he swore she
should never marry any one but himself, and that he would never marry
any one but her, did not at first, except to annoy, in any way impress
her.
</p><p>But he showed her what in her intercourse with Peabody was lacking.  At
first she wished Peabody could find time to be as fond of her, as
foolishly fond of her, as was Winthrop.  But she realized that this was
unreasonable.  Winthrop was just a hot-headed impressionable boy,
Peabody was a man doing a man's work.  And then she found that week
after week she became more difficult to please.  Other things in which
she wished Peabody might be more like Winthrop, obtruded themselves.
Little things which she was ashamed to notice, but which rankled; and
big things, such as consideration for others, and a sense of humor, and
not talking of himself.  Since this campaign began, at times she had
felt that if Peabody said "I" once again, she must scream.  She assured
herself she was as yet unworthy of him, that her intelligence was weak,
that as she grew older and so better able to understand serious
affairs, such as the importance of having an honest man at Albany as
Lieutenant-Governor, they would become more in sympathy.  And now, at a
stroke, the whole fabric of self-deception fell from her.  It was not
that she saw Peabody so differently, but that she saw herself and her
own heart, and where it lay.  And she knew that "Billy" Winthrop,
gentle, joking, selfish only in his love for her, held it in his two
strong hands.
</p><p>For the moment, when as she sat in the car deserted by Peabody this
truth flashed upon her, she forgot the man lying injured in the street,
the unscrubbed mob crowding about her.  She was conscious only that a
great weight had been lifted.  That her blood was flowing again,
leaping, beating, dancing through her body.  It seemed as though she
could not too quickly tell Winthrop.  For both of them she had lost out
of their lives many days.  She had risked losing him for always.  Her
only thought was to make up to him and to herself the wasted time.  But
throughout the day the one-time welcome, but now intruding, friends and
the innumerable conventions of hospitality required her to smile and
show an interest, when her heart and mind were crying out the one great
fact.
</p><p>It was after dinner, and the members of the house party were scattered
between the billiard-room and the piano.  Sam Forbes returned from the
telephone.
</p><p>"Tammany," he announced, "concedes the election of Jerome by forty
thousand votes, and that he carries his ticket with him.  Ernest
Peabody is elected his Lieutenant-Governor by a thousand votes.
Ernest," he added, "seems to have had a close call."  There was a
tremendous chorus of congratulations in the cause of Reform.  They
drank the health of Peabody.  Peabody himself, on the telephone,
informed Sam Forbes that a conference of the leaders would prevent his
being present with them that evening.  The enthusiasm for Reform
perceptibly increased.
</p><p>An hour later Winthrop came over to Beatrice and held out his hand.
"I'm going to slip away," he said.  "Good-night."
</p><p>"Going away!" exclaimed Beatrice.  Her voice showed such apparently
acute concern that Winthrop wondered how the best of women could be so
deceitful, even to be polite.
</p><p>"I promised some men," he stammered, "to drive them down-town to see
the crowds."
</p><p>Beatrice shook her head.
</p><p>"It's far too late for that," she said.  "Tell me the real reason."
</p><p>Winthrop turned away his eyes.
</p><p>"Oh! the real reason," he said gravely, "is the same old reason, the
one I'm not allowed to talk about.  It's cruelly hard when I don't see
you," he went on, slowly dragging out the words, "but it's harder when
I do; so I'm going to say 'good-night' and run into town."
</p><p>He stood for a moment staring moodily at the floor, and then dropped
into a chair beside her.
</p><p>"And, I believe, I've not told you," he went on, "that on Wednesday I'm
running away for good, that is, for a year or two.  I've made all the
fight I can and I lose, and there is no use in my staying on here
to--well--to suffer, that is the plain English of it.  So," he
continued briskly, "I won't be here for the ceremony, and this is
'good-by' as well as 'good-night.'"
</p><p>"Where are you going for a year?" asked Miss Forbes.
</p><p>Her voice now showed no concern.  It even sounded as though she did not
take his news seriously, as though as to his movements she was
possessed of a knowledge superior to his own.  He tried to speak in
matter-of-fact tones.
</p><p>"To Uganda!" he said.
</p><p>"To  Uganda?" repeated Miss Forbes.  "Where is Uganda?"
</p><p>"It is in East Africa; I had bad luck there last trip, but now I know
the country better, and I ought to get some good shooting."
</p><p>Miss Forbes appeared indifferently incredulous.  In her eyes there was
a look of radiant happiness.  It rendered them bewilderingly beautiful.
</p><p>"On Wednesday," she said.  "Won't you come and see us again before you
sail for Uganda?"
</p><p>Winthrop hesitated.
</p><p>"I'll stop in and say 'good-by' to your mother if she's in town, and to
thank her.  She's been awfully good to me. But you--I really would
rather not see you again.  You understand, or rather, you don't
understand, and," he added vehemently, "you never will understand." He
stood looking down at her miserably.
</p><p>On the driveway outside there was a crunching on the gravel of heavy
wheels and an aurora-borealis of lights.
</p><p>"There's your car," said Miss Forbes.  "I'll go out and see you off."
</p><p>"You're very good," muttered Winthrop.  He could not understand.  This
parting from her was the great moment in his life, and although she
must know that, she seemed to be making it unnecessarily hard for him.
He had told her he was going to a place very far away, to be gone a
long time, and she spoke of saying "good-by" to him as pleasantly as
though it was his intention to return from Uganda for breakfast.
</p><p>Instead of walking through the hall where the others were gathered, she
led him out through one of the French windows upon the terrace, and
along it to the steps.  When she saw the chauffeur standing by the car,
she stopped.
</p><p>"I thought you were going alone," she said.
</p><p>"I am,"  answered Winthrop.  "It's not Fred; that's Sam's chauffeur; he
only brought the car around."
</p><p>The man handed Winthrop his coat and cap, and left them, and Winthrop
seated himself at the wheel.  She stood above him on the top step.  In
the evening gown of lace and silver she looked a part of the moonlight
night.  For each of them the moment had arrived.  Like a swimmer
standing on the bank gathering courage for the plunge, Miss Forbes gave
a trembling, shivering sigh.
</p><p>"You're cold," said Winthrop, gently.  "You must go in.  Good-by."
</p><p>"It isn't that," said the girl.  "Have you an extra coat?"
</p><p>"It isn't cold enough for----"
</p><p>"I meant for me," stammered the girl in a frightened voice.  "I thought
perhaps you would take me a little way, and bring me back."
</p><p>At first the young man did not answer, but sat staring in front of him,
then, he said simply:
</p><p>"It's awfully good of you, Beatrice.  I won't forget it."
</p><p>It was a wonderful autumn night, moonlight, cold, clear and brilliant.
She stepped in beside him and wrapped herself in one of his
great-coats.  They started swiftly down the avenue of trees.
</p><p>"No, not fast," begged the girl, "I want to talk to you."
</p><p>The car checked and rolled forward smoothly, sometimes in deep shadow,
sometimes in the soft silver glamour of the moon; beneath them the
fallen leaves crackled and rustled under the slow moving wheels.  At
the highway Winthrop hesitated.  It lay before them arched with great
and ancient elms; below, the Hudson glittered and rippled in the
moonlight.
</p><p>"Which way do you want to go?" said Winthrop.  His voice was very
grateful, very humble.
</p><p>The girl did not answer.
</p><p>There was a long, long pause.
</p><p>Then he turned and looked at her and saw her smiling at him with that
light in her eyes that never was on land or sea.
</p><p>"To Uganda," said the girl.
