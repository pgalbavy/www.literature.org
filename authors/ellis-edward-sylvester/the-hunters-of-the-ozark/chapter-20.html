<p>Deerfoot the Shawanoe was convinced of one thing&mdash;the Wolf would
trouble him no further that night. What he might do in the future
must be left for the future to tell. Whether the few words that
he had dropped should prove the good seed of which I have spoken,
or whether they should be choked up by thorns, not even the Wolf
himself could tell.</p>

<p>The young warrior showed his convictions by flinging some wood
on the fire, so that its blaze filled the cavern, and preparing
for sleep. He first sat down and pulled out the knife of the Wolf,
whose blade took on an additional gleam from the cleansing it
had received in being forced into the flinty earth. He examined
it with no little curiosity, though it was similar to his own.</p>

<p>A glance, however, showed that it was an inch or two longer.
It was straight and oval-shaped, the blade not quite two inches
wide, with a handle that had been cut from a deer's horn and fitted
with no slight skill. Whether it was the product of aboriginal
ingenuity or was the work of some cutler of the Caucasian race
could only be guessed, the matter really not being worth the trouble
of guessing. Its two edges and the point were very sharp. Deerfoot
having laid aside his gun, grasped the blade in his left hand
and circled it through the air like a swordsman at play. He was
so pleased with it that he decided to keep it. He would not throw
away the one that had served him so well, but would present it
to Fred Linden, while he retained the one with which he was sure
he could do better work.</p>

<p>It was singular that while the Shawanoe was turning the weapon
over in his hand, and examining it with so much interest, that
the occasion for its immediate use should come, but so it was.</p>

<p>He was on the point of shoving it in behind his belt and lying
down to sleep, when a movement of the bushes outside was heard.
It was so distinct indeed that he knew it was not caused by a
person.</p>

<p>The rustling was accompanied by a scratching sound and low growl.
Turning his head, he saw an immense wolf standing at the entrance
of the cavern, his whole figure revealed in the firelight. With
his jaws parted and his form erect, he was a formidable creature,
before which almost any one would have recoiled. He would have
advanced straight to an attack upon the young warrior but for
the fire which partly interposed. Even as it was, he seemed making
ready to leap at the throat of the youth, who was sitting on the
blanket, looking coolly at him.</p>

<p>It would have been the easiest matter in the world for Deerfoot
to catch up his gun and shoot him dead, but he chose to do otherwise.
Drawing one of the embers forth by the end that was not burning,
he held it before him in his right hand, and, grasping the knife
in his left, ran lightly toward him, as though he meant to jam
it into his eyes.</p>

<p>The bravest animal can not stand unmoved before such an attack,
and the namesake of the human enemy whisked about and darted out
of the cavern with the Shawanoe close behind him. The former bounded
a half dozen steps, pausing on the very spot where the hostile
warrior was first seen, and facing about, as if to observe whether
his foe dare follow him any further. But Deerfoot had him now
where he wished, and he flung the torch aside among the undergrowth,
where it lay smoking for a few minutes before it went out.</p>

<p>The fierce animal must have been of the opinion that he too had
his antagonist where he wanted him, for, without the least hesitation,
he uttered a snarling growl and made two leaps straight at him.
The first carried him a little more than half the intervening
distance, and the second was meant to bear Deerfoot to the earth.</p>

<p>The young warrior, however, stepped lightly to one side, so that
the wolf missed him altogether, and would have been forced to
wheel about and make a second attack had the chance been given
him, but at the instant it landed, the left hand, grasping the
long, keen knife, shot forward with great force and lightning-like
swiftness, and was buried to the hilt in the throat of the brute.</p>

<p>It was a blow as effective as a cannon ball could have been,
for the knife clove the seat of life in twain, and the beast rolled
over on the earth dead, almost before it could emit a single yelp
of agony.</p>

<p>Deerfoot stood a moment surveying the carcass before him, and
then, with no more excitement than he would have shown in speaking
to Fred or Terry, he said: "'Tis a good weapon, and will serve
Deerfoot well."</p>

<p>Then he walked to the tiny brook, carefully washed the gleaming
blade, shoved it behind his belt, where it was held in place without
the sheath that clasped the other, and walked back to the cavern.
The boys had not been disturbed by the outcry of the wolf, and
Deerfoot, throwing some more wood on the flames, lay down on the
blanket, drew it partly about him, and in ten minutes was asleep,
not opening his eyes again until the light of morning streamed
into the cavern and only a few smoldering embers were left of
the camp-fire.</p>

<p>He smiled when he looked upon the two youths, who were still
soundly sleeping, all unconscious of the stirring events that
had taken place during the darkness. There was no call for a renewal
of the fire, and, after spending a few minutes in communion with
the Great Spirit, he passed outside the cavern, drank from the
clear water in the brook, and laved his face and hands.</p>

<p>Just as he finished, Fred Linden emerged, rubbing his eyes and
yawning, while Terry Clark was close behind him.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Deerfoot!" called the former; "it was just like
you to let us sleep all night while you kept watch: to-night you
must let us take our turn."</p>

<p>"Fred has exprissed me own sintimints," added Terry; "we have
had so much slumber that we can kaap awake for a month. Helloa!"</p>

<p>The gaze of the boys at that moment fell on the body of the wolf,
stiffened in death.</p>

<p>"You have had visitors," said Fred; "my gracious, but he's a
big fellow! Killed by a knife thrust too, that looks as if it
had gone half way through his body; how was it, Deerfoot?"</p>

<p>The Shawanoe waited until they had finished bathing their hands
and faces, and then he quietly told them the story, including
the account of the warrior's visit. As you may well suppose, the
boys opened their eyes, and Terry, running inside, brought out
the blanket, which had been folded in such a manner that the knife
of the Winnebago passed through three thicknesses of the cloth.</p>

<p>"And to think that we slept through it all!"</p>

<p>"Begorrah, but wasn't it lucky that we didn't have the blanket
wrapped about us?" gasped Terry, who was in earnest in his momentary
belief of the narrow escape of himself and companion.</p>

<p>"It is well that you kept guard last night; neither of us would
have heard the approach of the Winnebago; and wouldn't have known
any thing about the other wolf until he lit on our shoulders."</p>

<p>"My brother is mistaken," said Deerfoot; "he is like the rattlesnake;
he gives warning before he strikes; I heard him growl, and he
stopped at the entrance to the cavern, afraid of the fire."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you shoot him?"</p>

<p>"Would he have died more quietly, or with less pain than from
the knife? It is the knife that the Winnebago left; Deerfoot wanted
to learn whether it would serve him well."</p>

<p>"And I should think ye ought to be satisfied, as a cousin of
me own once remarked after working five years for a man without
any pay excipt starvation and kicks."</p>

<p>"The knife proved itself a good one," said Fred; "but the poorest
knife would be just as effective in your hands."</p>

<p>Deerfoot withdrew his own weapon from its skin sheath, and handed
it to Fred.</p>

<p>"Let my brother carry that, for the hour may come sooner than
he thinks when it will be of use to him."</p>

<p>Fred accepted it gratefully, saying, as he managed to find place
for it somewhat after the manner of Deerfoot:</p>

<p>"If I can handle it with half of your skill, it will serve me
well indeed, but that can never be."</p>

<p>Deerfoot placed the larger weapon within the sheath from which
he had withdrawn his own and made no reply to the compliments
of his friends. He had heard many such before, but he placed no
value upon them. He regarded himself as simply trying to use in
the best way the gifts of the Great Spirit. His many escapes from
death and injury were due solely to God's protecting care, and
he could never take to himself any credit for what he did.</p>

<p>The excitement of the boys having subsided, the three sat down
in front of the cavern to eat their breakfast. Enough of the food
brought by Fred was left to give each and all the meal needed,
but when they were through, not a particle was left; henceforth
they must depend upon what their rifles brought them for support
while on the way to the camp in the Ozarks.</p>

<p>"We have two or three days' travel yet before we can reach camp,"
said Fred, while they were making ready to resume their journey;
"but I don't think we shall want for food. What troubles me the
most is that scamp of a Winnebago. You have spared him twice,
but I don't believe it will make a friend of him."</p>

<p>"He was so boilin' mad," added Terry, "because he lost his gun
that now that he has also lost his knife he may get so much madder
that he'll flop over and become pleased again."</p>

<p>This, however, was a kind of philosophy to which the others could
not agree. Deerfoot owned that he was in doubt; the sentiment
of gratitude is not one of the chief virtues of the American race,
though many story-tellers would have us believe that it is. There
have been instances known where a red man has shown something
of the kind, but as a rule they have no more of it than had the
frozen serpent that was warmed in the bosom of him who proved
his foolishness by making the experiment.</p>
