<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>By noon we were well on our way towards Boston, I riding beside
Mrs. Hamilton's carriage wheels, Jack Mount perched up on the
box, and very gay in a new suit of buckskins which he bought from
a squaw in the village, the woman being an Oneida half-breed and
a tailoress by trade.</p>

<p>So gorgeous was this newly tailored suit that, though my own
buckskins were also new and deeply fringed on sleeve and leg,
even to the quill and wampum embroidery on the thigh, I did cut
but a dingy figure beside Jack Mount. His shoulders were triple-caped
with red-fox fur edges; he wore a belted hunting-shirt, with scarlet
thrums; breeches cut to show his long legs' contour to the clout,
also gay with scarlet thrums; and Huron moccasins, baldric, holster,
and sporran, all of mole-skin, painted and beaded with those mystic
scenes of the False-Face's secret rites, common to the Six Nations
and to other Northern and Western clans.</p>

<p>Proud as a painted game-cock with silver steels was Jack. Poor
gossip, how different his condition now, with a rasher o' bacon
and a cup of ale under his waist-band, a belt full of money outside
of it, and his scarlet thrums blowing like ribbons in the wind!
A new fox-skin cap, too, with the plumy white-tipped tail bobbing
to his neck, added the finish to this forest dandy. Truly it did
warm me to behold him ruffling it with the best o' them; and it
was a wink and a kiss for the pretty maid in the pantry, and a
pinch o' snuff with mine host, and "Your servant, ma'am," to Mrs.
Hamilton, with cap sweeping the dust in a salute that a Virginian
might envy and mark for imitation.</p>

<p>The post-boys slunk past him with rueful, sidelong glances; the
footman gave him wide berth, obeying the order to mount with an
alacrity designed to curry favour as soon as possible, and let
the painful past go bury itself.</p>

<p>"You had best," muttered Mount, with pretence of a fierceness
he loved to assume. "Gad! I'm minded to tan your buttocks to line
my saddle&mdash;ho!&mdash;come back! I'm not going to do it, simpleton!
I only said I was so minded. Into your saddles, in Heaven's name.
Salute!&mdash;you mannerless scullions! Do you not see your mistress
coming?"</p>

<p>I handed Mrs. Hamilton to her chaise, and stood in attendance
while she tied on her velvet sun-mask, watching me steadily through
the eye-holes the while, but not speaking. Yet ever on her lips
hovered that smile I knew so well; and from her hair came that
fresh scent which is of itself like the perfume of Indian swale-herb,
and which powder and pomatum can neither add to nor dissimulate.</p>

<p>Over her gown of shimmering stuff, garlanded with lilac-tints,
she wore a foot-mantle, for the road was muddy from the all-night
rain, and this I disposed around her ankles when she had seated
herself in the chaise, and wrapped her restless little feet in
a thick, well-tanned pelt.</p>

<p>"<em>Merci</em>," she said, in a whisper, with her bright eyes
sparkling under her velvet mask; and I closed the carriage and
mounted Warlock nimbly, impatient to be gone.</p>

<p>"Michael," she said from the chaise window, nose in the air to
watch me ride up.</p>

<p>"Madam," I replied, politely.</p>

<p>"Let Captain Mount ride your horse, and do you come into the
carriage. I have so much to tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>I made what excuse I could. She tossed her chin.</p>

<p>"I shall die of ennui," she said.</p>

<p>"Count the thraves in the stubble," said I, laughing.</p>

<p>"And talk to my five wits of the harvest? How amusing!" she retorted,
indignantly.</p>

<p>"Repent the past, then," I suggested, smiling.</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;but 'tis one blank expanse of white innocence, with never
a stain to mark for repentance. My past is spotless, Michael&mdash;spotless&mdash;like
a fox-pelt, all of a colour."</p>

<p>Now, though we call foxes red, their ear-tips are jet black and
their brushes and bellies touched with white. But she was right;
your spotless fox can have no dealings with a dappled fawn.</p>

<p>I signalled the footman and post-boys; the chaise creaked off
down the road, and I dropped behind, turning a sober face to the
rain-washed brightness of the world.</p>

<p>So we journeyed, coming into dry roads towards noon, where no
rain had fallen. And already it seemed to me my nostrils savoured
that faint raw perfume of the mounting sea, which only those who
have lived their whole lives inland can wind at great distances.
It is not a perfume either; it is a taste that steals into the
mouth and tingles far back, above the tongue. And it is strange
to say so, but those who never before have tasted the scent know
it for what it is by instinct, and fall into a restless reverie,
searching to think where they have savoured that same enchanted
ocean breath before.</p>

<p>At Grafton we baited at the "Weather-cock Tavern"; then on along
the Charles River, with the scent o' the distant sea in every
breath we drew, through Dedham, past Needham, and north into a
most lovely country of rolling golden stubble and orchards all
red with apples, and bridges of stone, neatly fashioned to resist
the freshets. Alas, that this fair province of Massachusetts Bay
should lie a-gasping amid plenty, with the hand of Britain upon
the country's thrapple to choke out the life God gave it.</p>

<p>On the straight, well-laid high-road we passed scores of farmers'
wains, piled with corn and yellow pumpkins, cabbages, squashes,
barrels of apples, sacks o' flour, and thraves, all bound for
Boston, where the poor were starving and the rich went hungering
because the King of England had been angered to hear men prate
of human rights.</p>

<p>Since the 1st day of June the Boston Port Bill was in full effect,
and the city was sealed to commerce. Not a keel had stirred the
waters of the bay save when the great bulging war-ships shifted
their moorings to swing their broadsides towards the town; not
a sail was bent to the shore breeze in this harbour where a thousand
vessels had cleared in a single year from its busy port.</p>

<p>So when the city felt the punishment heavy upon her, and the
poor starved and the rich suffered, and the hot sun poured down
on the empty rotting wharves, the farmers of Massachusetts Bay
brought their harvests by land to the famine-stricken city, and
sister colonies sent generously of their best with the watchword:
"Stand fast, Boston! A King's anger is a little thing, but human
rights shall not perish until we perish, every one!"</p>

<p>It was sunset as we turned into the Roxbury road, with the salt
wind blowing the marsh-reeds and ruffling the shallow waters of
the harbour to the north and east. It was ebb-tide; beyond the
eastern bog, far out in the yellow shallows, the harbour channel
ran in a darker streak, glittering under the red blaze of sunset.</p>

<p>Wet marshes spread away to the north; the wind was heavy with
the salty stench of mud-flats uncovered at low-water, and all
alive with sea-fowl hovering. Northeast the steeples of Boston
rose, blood-red in the setting sun; distant windows flashed fire;
weather-vanes turned to jets of flame.</p>

<p>The red glow enveloped the road over which we travelled, now
in company with scores of other vehicles, all bound for Boston&mdash;coaches,
flies, chaises, wagons, farm wains&mdash;all moving slowly as though
the head of the column had been checked by something which we
could not yet see.</p>

<p>I rode forward to where Jack Mount was sitting on the box of
the chaise, and he motioned me to his side.</p>

<p>"We're close to Boston Neck," he said. "Tommy Gage has been making
some forts ahead of us since I last smelled the mud-flats yonder."</p>

<p>I rode on slowly, passing along the stalled line of vehicles,
until, just ahead, I caught a glimpse of an earthwork flying the
British flag. The red banner stood straight out in the sea-wind,
rippling, and snapping like a whip when the breeze freshened.
Under it a sentry moved, bayonet glittering as he turned, paced
on, turned again, only to retrace his endless path on the brown
rampart of earth.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that first coming to Boston, and the first
glimpse of the round city, set there in the sea with only a narrow
thread of land to fasten it to the continent which had made the
city's cause its own. Nor shall I forget my first sight of the
city's landward gate, closed by British earthworks, patrolled
by British bayonets, with the red standard flying in the setting
sun.</p>

<p>The Providence coach was standing in the road to my left, the
six horses stamping restlessly, the outside passengers shivering
in the harbour wind, while the red-nosed coachman muttered and
complained and craned his short bull-neck to see what was blocking
the highway ahead.</p>

<p>"It's them darned cannon," he explained to everybody who cared
to listen; "they're a-haulin' some more twenty-four pounders into
the right bastion. Ding it! My horses are ketchin' cold an' bots
an' ring-bone while we set here in a free land waitin' his Majesty's
pleasure!"</p>

<p>"The cannon will come handy&mdash;some day," called out a passenger
from the Philadelphia coach, stalled just behind.</p>

<p>"You'd better get your cannon out of the south battery before
you lay plans to steal these!" retorted a soldier, derisively,
making his way towards the city between the tangle of wheels and
horses which almost choked the road.</p>

<p>"We'll get 'em yet, young red-belly!" shouted a fat farmer, cracking
his whip for emphasis. His horses started, and he pulled them
in, shouting: "Whoa, lass! Whoa, dandy! Don't shy at a redcoat;
he can't harm ye!"</p>

<p>"Gad!" burst out an old gentleman on the Roxbury coach, "is this
rebel impudence to be endured?"</p>

<p>A chorus of protestations broke from the tops of neighbouring
coaches, but the sturdy old gentleman shook his cane, defying
every Yankee within hearing, while the protests around grew to
angry shouts and cries of: "Enough! Tar the Tory! Pitch the old
fool into the mud!"</p>

<p>In the midst of the bawling and uproar the line of vehicles ahead
suddenly started, and those behind moved on, rumbling over the
planked road with creaking wheels and thunder of a hundred hoofs,
drowning the voices of disputing Whig and Tory.</p>

<p>I looked up at the passengers as the huge mail-coaches with their
four, six, or eight horses rumbled past. Many of the people glanced
somewhat curiously down at me, smiling to see a forest-runner
mounted on so fine a horse as Warlock. And I was proud to sit
the saddle under their gaze, not minding the quips and jests directed
at me from above; though, when once a mealy faced post-boy shouted
at me, I fetched him a cuff on the ear which nigh unseated him,
and drew a roar of laughter from the people near.</p>

<p>The Philadelphia coach with passengers from Maryland and Virginia
came swaying up, horses dancing, guard standing by the boot, and
sounding his long coaching-horn&mdash;a gallant equipage, with its
blue gear and claret body showing through a skin of half-dry mud.</p>

<p>I glanced up at the outside travellers, thinking I might know
some face among them, yet not expecting it. There were no familiar
faces. I wheeled my horse to watch the coach go by, glancing idly
at the window where a young girl leaned out, sucking a China orange.
Our eyes met for a moment; the girl dropped the orange and stared
at me; I also eyed her sharply, certain that I had seen her somewhere
in the world before this. The coach passed. I sat on my horse,
looking after it, cudgelling my wits to remember that red-cheeked,
buxom lass, who seemed to know me, too.</p>

<p>Then, as our chaise rattled by, with the post-boys urging the
horses, and Jack Mount on the box, it came to me in a flash that
the girl was the thief-taker's daughter from Fort Pitt.</p>

<p>I rode up beside Mount and told him in a low voice that Billy
Bishop's buxom lass was ahead of us in the Philadelphia coach,
and that he had best keep his wits and eyes cleared for Billy
Bishop himself.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, not answering, but I noticed he was
alert enough now, unconsciously fingering his rifle, while his
quick eyes roamed restlessly as the chaise passed in between the
British earthworks on the Neck.</p>

<p>Truly this Captain-General Thomas Gage, whom the King of England
loved so well, had cut Boston from the land as neatly as his royal
master had cut it from the sea.</p>

<p>The Roxbury road ran through a narrow passage between two bastions
of earth, surrounded with a heavy abatis and <em>trous de loup</em>.
In the left bastion I could see magazines and guard-houses, and
beyond it, near the shore, a small square redoubt, a block-house,
and a battery of six cannon. In the right bastion there was a
guard-house, and beyond that a block-house on the shore of the
mud-flats, while farther out in the shallow water lay a floating
battery.</p>

<p>Our chaise rolled in through the earthworks and down a causeway
surrounded by water. This was Boston Neck, a strip of made land
not wider than a high-road, and blocked at the northern extremity
by a solid military work of stone and earth, bristling with cannon.</p>

<p>The gate guards eyed us sullenly as we drove into the city and
up a long, dusty road called Orange Street. We continued to Newbury
Street, to Marlborough Street, Mount directing us, thence through
Cornhill to Queen Street, where we drew up at a very elegant mansion.</p>

<p>Dismounting, I took Mrs. Hamilton from the carriage, and she
unmasked, for the fire was dying out in the western heavens.</p>

<p>"If," she began slowly, "I should bid you to supper at my house,
would you hurt me with refusal, Michael?"</p>

<p>"Is this your house?" I asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;my late husband's. Will you come?"</p>

<p>I explained that I cared not to leave Mount, and that also we
must seek a tavern as soon as might be, for we had much business
on the morrow which could not wait.</p>

<p>She listened, with a faintly mocking air, then thanked me for
my escort, thanked Mount for his share in providing me as her
escort by stopping her carriage, and finally curtseyed, saying
in a low voice: "Your charming Miss Warren is doubtless impatient.
Pray believe me that I wish you joy of your conquest."</p>

<p>I thought she meant it, and it touched me. But when I stepped
to her door-yard to conduct her, she turned on me like a flash,
and I saw her eyes all wet and brilliant, and her teeth crushing
her under-lip.</p>

<p>"For a charming journey in my own company, I thank you," she
said; "for your conceit and your insufferable airs, I will find
a remedy&mdash;remember that! My humiliation under your own roof is
not forgotten, Mr. Cardigan, and it shall not be forgotten until
you pay me dearly!"</p>

<p>Astonished at her bitterness, I found not a word to answer. A
man-servant in purple livery opened the door. Mrs. Hamilton turned
to me with perfect composure, returning my bow with the smile
of an angel, and tripped lightly into her house.</p>

<p>The post-chaise had driven off into the mews when I returned
to the street, but Jack Mount was waiting for me, patting Warlock,
whose beautiful head had swung around to watch for my coming.</p>

<p>"Well, Jack?" I asked, wearily.</p>

<p>"The 'Wild Goose Tavern' is ours," he said&mdash;"good cheer and company
to match it."</p>

<p>I walked out into the paved street, leading Warlock. Mount swaggered
along beside me, squaring his broad shoulders whenever we passed
a soldier, and whistling lustily "Tryon County Men," till the
stony streets rang with the melody.</p>

<p>We now crossed into Treamount Street, passed Valley Acre on our
right into Sudbury Street, then northwest through Hilliers Lane,
crossing Cambridge Street to Green Lane, and west again along
Green Lane to the corner of Chambers Street, where it becomes
Wiltshire Street and runs due north.</p>

<p>There was enough of daylight left for me to see that we were
not in an aristocratic neighbourhood. Warehouses, ship-chandlers,
rope-walks, and scrap-iron shops lined the streets, interspersed
with vacant, barren plots of ground, rarely surrounded by wooden
fences.</p>

<p>The warehouses and shops were closed and all the shutters and
doors fast bolted. There was not a soul abroad in the streets,
not a light to be seen save from one long, low building standing
midway between Chambers and Wiltshire Streets&mdash;an ancient, discoloured,
rambling structure, with a weather-vane atop, and a long, pillared
porch in front, from which hung a bush of sea-weed, and a red
sign-board depicting a creature which doubtless was intended for
a wild goose.</p>

<p>"Lord, Jack!" I said, "Shemuel's 'Bear and Cubs' appeared preferable
to your 'Wild Goose' yonder. I'm minded to seek other quarters."</p>

<p>"Never trust to the looks o' things," he laughed. "God made woodchucks
to live on the ground, but they climb trees, too, sometimes. Do
I think on the hog-pen when I eat a crisped rasher? Nenny, lad.
Come on to the cleanest tap-room in Boston town and forget that
the shutters yonder need new hinges!"</p>

<p>I led Warlock into the mews to a clean, well-aired stable, where
an ostler bedded and groomed him, and shook out as pretty a handful
of grain as I had seen since I left Johnson Hall.</p>

<p>Then Mount and I went into the tavern, where half a dozen sober
citizens in string-wigs sat, silently smoking clay pipes with
stems full three feet long.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, the company!" said Mount, pleasantly.</p>

<p>The men repeated his salutation, and looked at us sleepily over
their pipes.</p>

<p>"God save our country, gentlemen," said Mount, standing still
in the centre of the room.</p>

<p>"His mercy shall endure," replied a young man, quietly removing
the pipe from between his teeth. "What of the Thirteen Sisters?"</p>

<p>"They sew that we may reap," said Mount, slowly, and sat down,
motioning me to take a chair in the circle.</p>

<p>The men looked at us curiously, but in silence, although their
sleepy, guarded air had disappeared.</p>

<p>After a moment Mount asked if there was anything new.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the young man who had spoken before; "the Lawyers'
and Merchants' Club met at Cooper's in Brattle Square last night
to receive instructions from the Committee of Safety. I do not
know what new measures have been taken, but whatever they may
be we are assured that they will be accepted and imitated by every
town in Massachusetts Bay."</p>

<p>"Who were present?" asked Mount, curiously.</p>

<p>"The full committee, Jim Bowdoin, Sam Adams, John Adams, John
Hancock, Will Phelps, Doctor Warren, and Joseph Quincy. Paul Revere
called a meeting at the "Green Dragon" the same night, and the
Mechanics' Club sent invitations to the North End Caucus, the
South End Caucus, and the Middle District, to consider the arrival
of British transports from Quebec with the Tenth and Fifty-second
regiments."</p>

<p>"What! more troops?" exclaimed Mount, in amazement.</p>

<p>"How long have you been absent from Boston?" asked the young
man.</p>

<p>"Since April," replied Mount.</p>

<p>"Would you care to hear a few facts that have occurred since
April, gentlemen?" asked the young man, courteously including
me in his invitation. Mount called the tap-boy and commanded cakes
and ale for the company, with a harmless swagger; and when the
tankards were brought we all drank a silent but significant toast
to the dark city outside our windows.</p>

<p>The young man who had acted as spokesman for his company now
produced a small leather book, which he said was a diary. Pipes
were filled, lips wet in the tankards once more, and then the
young man, who said his name was Thomas Newell, opened his little
note-book and read rapidly:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>Newell paused, glanced over the pages again, then shut the little
book and placed it in his breast-pocket.</p>

<p>Mount sat grim and silent, twisting the scarlet thrums on his
sleeves; the others, with painful, abstracted faces, stared at
vacancy through the mounting smoke from their long clay pipes.</p>

<p>Presently the landlord came in, glanced silently around, saluted
Mount with a quiet bow, paid his respects to me in a similar manner,
and whispered that we might sup at our pleasure in the "Square
Room" above.</p>

<p>So, with a salute to the company, we rose and left the tap-room
to the silent smokers of the long pipes.</p>

<p>The so-called "Square Room" of the "Wild Goose Tavern" was a
low, wainscoted chamber, set with small deep windows. It was an
ancient room, built in the fashion of a hundred years ago, more
heavily wrought than we build in these days; and although the
floor-beams had settled in places, and the flooring sagged and
rose in little hillocks, yet the place suggested great solidity
and strength. Nor was it to be wondered at, for this portion of
the tavern had at one time been a detached block-house pierced
for musketry, and the long loopholes were still there above the
wainscoting.</p>

<p>Spite of its age and fortified allure, the "Square Room" was
cheerful under its candle-light and illuminated sconces. Rows
of framed pictures hung along the walls, the subjects representing
coaching scenes in England and also many beautiful scenes from
the sporting life of country gentlemen.</p>

<p>Relics of the hunting field also adorned the walls, trophies
of fox-masks, with brush and pads, groups of hunting-horns, whips,
and spurs, with here and there an ancient matchlock set on the
wall, flanked by duelling-pistols, powder-horns, and Scottish
dirks.</p>

<p>The furniture was of light oak, yet very clumsy and old-fashioned,
being worn shiny like polished Chinese carvings. Pipe-racks of
oak were screwed into the wainscoting under long shelves, well
stored with pewters, glass tankards, punch-bowls, and tobacco-jars.</p>

<p>There were a few small square tables scattered along the walls,
but the centre of the room was taken up with a long table, some
three dozen chairs placed, and as many covers spread for guests.</p>

<p>To this long, tenantless table our host conducted us, seating
us with a silent civility most noteworthy, and in sharp contrast
to the majority of landlords, who do sicken their guests with
obsequious babble.</p>

<p>"Well, Clay," said Mount, hitching his heavy chair closer to
the white cloth, "I left brother Jim in good spirits at Pitt."</p>

<p>The landlord bowed, and seemed gratified to hear it.</p>

<p>"You should know," said Mount, turning to me, "that our host
is Barclay Rolfe, brother to Jim Rolfe, of the 'Virginia Arms'
in Fort Pitt." And to the landlord he said, "Mr. Cardigan, late
ward of Sir William Johnson, but one of us."</p>

<p>"I owe your brother much," said I, "more than a bill for a chaise
and four. Possibly you have heard from him concerning that same
chaise?"</p>

<p>"I have heard through Saul Shemuel," he said, gravely. "I guess
my brother was tickled to death to help you out of that pickle,
Mr. Cardigan."</p>

<p>"He shall not lose by it either," said I. "My solicitor, Peter
Weaver, of Albany, has sent your brother full recompense for the
carriage and animals."</p>

<p>The elder Rolfe thanked me very simply, then excused himself
to go to the kitchen where our dinner should now be ready.</p>

<p>It was truly a noble dinner of samp soup, roast pork, beans,
a boiled cod, most toothsome and sweetly salt, and a great wild
goose, roasted brown, with onion and sage dressing, and an aroma
which filled the room like heavenly incense.</p>

<p>With this we drank October ale, touching neither Madeira nor
sherry, though both were recommended us; but I wished not to mix
draughts to set that latent deviltry a-brewing in Jack Mount,
so refused all save ale for himself and for me, though I allowed
him a hot bowl with his hazel nuts.</p>

<p>We now withdrew to one of the small tables in a corner of the
room, a servant bringing thither our nuts and hot bowls, and also
some writing materials for me.</p>

<p>These I prepared to use at once, pushing the nut-shells clear,
and seized the pen to cramp it in my fist and set to work, tongue-moistening
my determined lips:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>Sealing the letter, I bade the servant take it and bring an answer
if the gentleman was at home, but in any event to leave the letter.</p>

<p>Mount had taken a pipe from the stranger's rack, and now lighted
it, peering out of the window, and puffing away in vast contentment.</p>

<p>Northward, across the water, the lights of Charlestown glimmered
through a thin fog. Nearer, in mid-stream, rose the black hull
of a British war-ship, battle-lanthorns set and lighted, stabbing
the dark tide below with jagged shafts of yellow light, cut by
little black waves which hastened seaward on the sombre ebbing
tide.</p>

<p>As for Boston, or as much of it as we could see over the shadowy
roofs and slanting house-tops, it was deathly dark and still.
Fort Pitt, with its hundreds of people, which Boston could match
with thousands, was far more stirring and alive than this dumb
city of shadows, with never a stir in its empty streets, and never
a light from a window-candle. Truly, we sat in a tomb&mdash;the sepulchre
of all good men's hopes for justice from that distant England
we had loved so well in kinder days.</p>

<p>Somewhere, deep in the dim city's heart, a fire was burning,
and we could see its faint reflection on chimneys in the northwest.</p>

<p>"Doubtless some regimental fire on the Common," muttered Mount,
"or a signal on Mount <em>W&mdash;</em>d&mdash;m, where the Light Horse
camp. They talk to the war-ships and the castle from Beacon Hill,
too. It may be that."</p>

<p>Musing there by the window, we scarcely noticed that, little
by little, the room behind us was filling. Already at the long
table a dozen guests were seated, some conversing, some playing
absently with their glasses, some reading the newspapers through
round horn-rimmed spectacles.</p>

<p>Many of them glanced sharply at us; some looked at Mount, smiled,
and nudged others.</p>

<p>"Do you know any of these gentlemen, Jack?" I asked, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>He swung around in his chair and surveyed the table.</p>

<p>"Ay, all o' them," he said, returning their amused salutations;
"they all belong to the club that meets here."</p>

<p>"Club? What club?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The Minute Men's. I meant to tell you that you're a member."</p>

<p>"I a member?" I repeated, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Surely, lad, else you never could ha' passed these stairs. I
am a member; I bring you, and now you're a member. There's no
oath to take in this club. It's only when you go higher into the
secret councils like those o' the three caucuses, the Mechanics',
and some others I shall not mention, by your leave."</p>

<p>Mount watched the effect of his words on me and grinned.</p>

<p>"You didn't know that I am one of the Minute Club's messengers?
That's why I went to Pitt. Did you think I went there for my health?
Nenny, lad. I had a message for Cresap as well as you, and I gave
it, too."</p>

<p>He laughed, and moistened his lips at the hot bowl.</p>

<p>"Paul Revere, the goldsmith&mdash;he who made the print of the Boston
Massacre&mdash;is another messenger, but not of the Minute Club. He
is higher&mdash;goes breakneck to York for <em>S. A.</em>, you know."</p>

<p>"What is S. A.?" I broke in, petulantly. "You all talk of J.
H. and S. A. and the Thirteen Sisters, and I don't understand."</p>

<p>"S. A. is Sam Adams," said Mount, surprised. "J. H. is John Hancock,
a rich young man who is with us to the last gasp. The Thirteen
Sisters mean the thirteen colonies. They're with us, too&mdash;at least
we hope they are, though York is a hell for Tories, and Philadelphia's
full o' broad-brims who may not fight."</p>

<p>"But what is this Minute Men's Club?" I asked, curiously.</p>

<p>"Headquarters for delegates from the Minute Men and all alarm
companies in Massachusetts Bay. You know that every town, village,
and hamlet in the province is organized, don't you? Well, besides
the regular militia we have alarm companies, where half of the
men are ready to march at a minute's notice. One officer from
every company throughout the province is delegated to attend the
Minute Club here, so that he can keep his company in touch with
the march of events.</p>

<p>"Besides that, the club has a corps of runners, like me, to travel
with orders when called on. I'm in for a rest now, unless something
pressing occurs."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;what am I in this club?" I asked, smiling to see how well
Jack Mount had kept his secrets since I first knew him.</p>

<p>"You? Oh, you are a recruit for Cresap's battalion," said Mount,
much amused. "We recruit here, for certain companies."</p>

<p>"Is Cresap coming here?" I asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"He marches in the spring with his Maryland and Pennsylvania
Rangers&mdash;to pay his respects to Tommy Gage? Nenny! To help turn
this pack o' bloody-backs out of Boston, lad, and that's the truth,
which you should know."</p>

<p>I sat silent, pondering on the strange circumstances of these
months which had brought me so swiftly, from my boyhood's isolation,
into the thick of the tremendous struggle between King and colony,
a struggle still bloodless, save for the so-called Boston Massacre
of some years past.</p>

<p>That Mount had coolly recruited me without my knowledge or consent
disturbed me not at all: first, because I should have offered
my poor services anyway; second, because, had I been free to select,
I should have chosen to serve with Cresap's men, knowing him,
as I did, for a brave and honourable young man.</p>

<p>I told Jack as much, and his face brightened with pleasure. He
insisted on presenting me to the company&mdash;which was now fast filling
the room&mdash;as one of Cresap's Rangers; and he further did most
foolishly praise me for my bearing in certain common dangers he
and I had shared, which made me red and awkward and vexed with
him for my embarrassment.</p>

<p>The gentlemen I met were all most kind and polite; some appeared
to be gentlemen bred, others honest young men&mdash;over-silent and
sober for their years, perhaps, but truly a sturdy, clean-limbed
company, neatly but not fashionably attired, and the majority
characterized by a certain lankness of body which tended to gauntness
in a few.</p>

<p>All were officers of alarm companies belonging to the numerous
towns of the province; all were simple in manner, courteous to
each other, and thoughtful of strangers, inviting us to wine or
punch, and taking no offence when I prudently refused, for my
own sake as well as for Jack's.</p>

<p>Two soldiers of the Lexington militia entertained me most agreeably;
they were Nathan Harrington and Robert Monroe, the latter an old
soldier, having been standard-bearer for his regiment at Louisburg.</p>

<p>"For years," he observed, quietly, "the British have said that
all Americans are cowards, and they have so dinned it into their
own ears that they believe it. It is a strange thing for them
to believe. Who was it stood fast before Duquesne when Braddock's
British fled? Who took Louisburg? What men have fought for England
on our frontiers from our grandfathers' times?"</p>

<p>"Ay," broke in Harrington, "they tell us that we are yokels without
wit or knowledge to fire a musket. Yet, to-day, two-thirds of
the men in our province of Massachusetts Bay have served as soldiers
against the French or the savages."</p>

<p>"That we are under the King's displeasure," said Monroe, "I can
well understand; but that he and his ministers and his soldiers
should wish to deem us cowards&mdash;we who are English, too, as well
as they&mdash;passes my understanding."</p>

<p>"Mayhap they will learn the truth ere winter," observed Harrington,
grimly.</p>

<p>"If I or my friends be cowards, I do not know it," added Monroe,
simply. "It is not well to boast, Nathan, for God alone knows
what a man may do in battle; yet I myself have been in battle,
and was afraid, too, but never ran. I carried England's flag once.
It is not well that she foul her own nest."</p>

<p>"I have never smelled powder; have you, sir?" said Harrington,
turning to me.</p>

<p>"Not to boast of," I replied.</p>

<p>"Mount says you conducted most gallantly under fire," said Monroe,
smiling.</p>

<p>"No more gallantly than did all at Cresap's fort," said I, annoyed.
"We were behind ramparts and dreaded nothing save an arrow or
two."</p>

<p>"But you had some warm work with certain Tories, too," began
Monroe&mdash;"one Walter Butler, I believe."</p>

<p>"How did you hear of that?" I asked, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Benny Prince brought the news," he replied. "Where he heard
it I do not know, but it is noised abroad that you laid no kind
hands on Walter Butler and Lord Dunmore. Nay, sir, you should
not be surprised. We have our agents everywhere, listening, watching,
noting all facts and rumours for those whom I need not name. We
know, for instance, that Walter Butler has travelled north in
a litter. We know that Dunmore scarce dare show his head in Virginia
for the shame you put upon him and the growing hatred of the people
he governs. We know that Sir John Johnson is fortifying Johnson
Hall and gathering hordes of savages and Tories in Tryon County.
Ay, Mr. Cardigan, we know, too, that the son of your father will
fight to the death for the cause which his honour demands that
he embrace."</p>

<p>"My father died for his King," I said, slowly.</p>

<p>"And mine, too," said Monroe; "but were he not with God to-day,
I know where he would be found."</p>

<p>Others began to join our group. Mount, who had been conversing
with a handsome and very fashionably dressed young man, approached
our table with his companion, and presented me to him.</p>

<p>I had, of course, heard more or less of John Hancock, but had
pictured him as an elderly man, sober of costume and stern and
gray. Therefore my first meeting with John Hancock was a disappointment.
He was young, handsome, decidedly vain, though quite free from
affectation of speech or gesture. He appeared to lack that gravity
of deportment and deliberation which characterized the company
around us; gestures and words were at times impetuous if not whimsical;
he appeared not too free from an egotism which, I thought, tinged
all he said, so that, somehow, his words lost a trifle of the
weight they deserved to carry.</p>

<p>His style of dress was not to my taste, savouring of the French,
I thought. He wore an apple-green coat, white silk stockings,
very large silver buckles on his pumps, smallclothes of silver-net
tied at the knees with pea-green ribbons, which fell to his ankles,
and much expensive lace at his throat and cuffs.</p>

<p>His hair was frizzled and powdered, and worn in a French club
with black ribbon, and the hair on his temples was loaded with
pomatum and rolled twice.</p>

<p>He certainly was most civil to me, mentioning his pleasure that
Captain Cardigan's son should embrace the patriots' cause, and
inquiring most respectfully concerning the last moments of Sir
William Johnson, a man, he said, for whom he had entertained the
highest possible respect and admiration.</p>

<p>Our conversation was of short duration, Mr. Hancock being addressed
and solicited by so many who had business with him in his capacity
of delegate from the secret club at the "Green Dragon Tavern."</p>

<p>I learned from the hints dropped that Boston was literally crowded
with clubs, some open, some secret, but all organized to discuss
politics, and pledged to combat the acts of the British Parliament
to the bitter end.</p>

<p>Many clubs were formed among the Boston mechanics, of which the
Mechanics' Society or Club was the centre. The Boston mechanics,
I learned, were the earliest and most constant supporters of the
patriot cause. Neither threats, temptations, Tory arguments, nor
loyalist bribes could shake their fidelity; and they were the
people, too, who had most to lose when the city was closed to
commerce. Starvation faced them; troops thickened in Boston; but
the mechanics remained true. And although, when in dire need,
to sustain their wives and little ones, they thoughtlessly started
work on the new barracks, at a word of warning and explanation
from the Committee of Safety, they left their work in a body,
to the rage and chagrin of General Gage and every soldier and
Tory in Boston.</p>

<p>I further learned that the patriots carried on their political
action not only by clubs and through the newspapers, but also
by public meetings in defiance of Governor Gage.</p>

<p>All men know that we Americans have inherited the right of public
meeting. But when the "regulating act" came from England to prohibit
that right, it missed fire, for though it did forbid such meeting
unless authorized by Governor Gage, it did not provide for adjourning
meetings already in progress. Therefore the assemblies in all
the provincial towns had begun meetings in anticipation of the
1st of August, the date set for their prohibition, and the meetings
were carried over that date, and kept alive day after day by not
being officially declared adjourned.</p>

<p>It was useless for Gage to fume; he had no authority under the
law to adjourn them.</p>

<p>In Boston the people flocked in crowds to Faneuil Hall and the
Old South Church, where Samuel Adams, James Otis, and Josiah Quincy
were the orators. And the government, in secret dread, watched
the people thronging around these fiery orators, whose theme was
liberty and equal rights for all.</p>

<p>The Committees of Donation and of Correspondence were most active.
The former was organized to distribute relief to the poor in the
stricken city; the latter was formed to keep all patriots in all
of the thirteen colonies in touch with each other, and to observe
the approach of the great current which was surely bearing war
upon the waves that formed its crest.</p>

<p>This Committee of Correspondence was the great executive of our
party. It watched unceasingly: it received information from all
the societies, clubs, town assemblies, caucuses, and local committees.
It distributed all information, all warnings, all rumours, not
only from America, but also, through its agents, from abroad.</p>

<p>Many of its members were also members of the "Green Dragon."
John Hancock was such a member, and therefore his presence here
at the "Wild Goose" was perhaps significant.</p>

<p>That he was about to address the company was apparent, for everybody
had now taken chairs and formed a semi-circle around Mr. Hancock,
who stood leaning against the great centre-table, coolly taking
snuff, and glancing over a written sheet of paper which he held
in his left hand.</p>

<p>"It may be," he said, "a trifle premature to discuss here in
open meeting those measures of resistance contemplated and now
under discussion in the Committee of Correspondence, the Provincial
Congress, and the Continental Congress.</p>

<p>"It is sufficient, therefore, for the moment, that you should
know that Virginia and South Carolina are at last aroused to the
necessity of taking thought for their local defences. I may also
add that my Lord Dunmore's government increases in rigour and
also in disfavour.</p>

<p>"The Committee of Correspondence has received word direct from
Mr. Patrick Henry that he regards the cause of peace as already
lost, and urges us to rely on Virginia, at least, for loyal support
in whatever measures we may deem necessary to maintain our manhood
in the face of all the world."</p>

<p>A murmur of applause swept like a whisper through the room, hushed
immediately by cautious gestures and glances at the street outside,
which might harbour a spy in its heavy gloom and impenetrable,
brooding shadows.</p>

<p>"There is a certain document embodying a proposed declaration,"
continued Hancock, "which, although at present merely under discussion,
I expect to see one day printed, completed, and framed, and hung
in every home in these thirteen colonies. You may perhaps imagine
what document I refer to, and doubtless many of you sitting here
are not yet prepared for that supreme step forward in our manifest
destiny. Neither, I may say, are many who have the framing of
that declaration under discussion. Time alone will show that future
of which I, for one, am so certain.</p>

<p>"I am not here to discuss with you the proposed declaration in
question, which is not even yet existent save in the hearts of
those who have dared to dream of it.</p>

<p>"I am here to submit to you a list of crimes against our colony
of Massachusetts Bay, committed or contemplated by the King of
England."</p>

<p>He unrolled his bit of paper, took a fresh pinch of scented snuff,
and read, somewhat carelessly:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"The history of the present King of Great Britain:

</p>
<p>
"He refuses his assent to necessary laws for the public good.

</p>
<p>
"He forbids his Governors to pass laws of immediate<br/>
importance, unless suspended in their operation till his<br/>
assent be obtained; and when so suspended he has utterly<br/>
neglected to attend to them.

</p>
<p>
"He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual<br/>
with intent to fatigue, discourage, and annoy the members of<br/>
such bodies.

</p>
<p>
"He has repeatedly dissolved representative houses for<br/>
opposing his invasions of the people's rights.

</p>
<p>
"He obstructs the administration of justice.

</p>
<p>
"He makes judges dependent on his will alone for tenure of<br/>
office and payment of salaries.

</p>
<p>
"He has created a multitude of new offices and sent hither<br/>
swarms of officers to harass our people.

</p>
<p>
"He keeps among us, in times of peace, standing armies,<br/>
without consent of our legislature.

</p>
<p>
"He renders his military independent of and superior to civil<br/>
power.

</p>
<p>
"He protects these troops, by mock trials, from punishment<br/>
for murders committed on the inhabitants of this province.

</p>
<p>
"He has cut off our trade with the whole world.

</p>
<p>
"He taxes us without our consent.

</p>
<p>
"He deprives us of the benefits of trial by jury.

</p>
<p>
"He transports us beyond the seas for trial for pretended<br/>
offences.

</p>
<p>
"He takes away our charters, abolishes our laws, suspends our<br/>
legislatures."

</p>
</div>
<p>Hancock looked up, still holding the paper unrolled.</p>

<p>"Why," he said, lightly, "this is no King, but a Cæsar amid his
prætorians! Faith, I have been reading some history of the tyrants&mdash;surely
not the history of our beloved monarch, George the Third!"</p>

<p>There was a grim silence. Hancock's manner changed. He folded
the paper, placed it in the bosom of his white waistcoat, and
turned soberly to the rows of silent, seated men.</p>

<p>"Yesterday," he said, "a carpenter was arrested for stealing
bread for his little children. May I request, gentlemen, that
you send a delegate to the committee which will wait upon the
Governor to-morrow to intercede for the starving man?"</p>

<p>Then, with a brief inclination, he turned and left the room ere
anybody was aware of his purpose.</p>

<p>The effect of his unexpected appeal was as dramatic as his sudden
exit. With one impulse the company rose, grave, pale, tight-lipped;
little groups formed on the floor; few words passed; but Hancock
had done his work, and every alarm company in Massachusetts would
know, ere many hours, that they were to fight one day, not for
their honour, but to prevent the King of England from driving
them to dishonour, so that their children might not die of want
before their eyes.</p>

<p>It was not an orator's effort that Hancock had accomplished;
it was a mere statement of a truth, yet so skilfully timed and
so dramatic in execution that it was worth months of oratory before
the vast audiences of Faneuil Hall. For he had startled the representatives
of hundreds of villages, and set them thinking on that which was
closest to them&mdash;the danger to the welfare of their own households.
Such danger makes panthers of men.</p>

<p>If Hancock was theatrical at moments, the end justified the means;
if he was an egotist, he risked his wealth for principle; if he
was a dandy, he had the bravery of the true dandy, which clothes
all garments with a spotless, shining robe, and covers the face
of vanity under a laurelled helmet.</p>

</div>
<p>It was late when the servant returned from Mr. Foxcroft, with
a curt note from that gentleman, promising to receive me at one
o'clock in the afternoon of the day following.</p>

<p>As I stood twisting the letter in my fingers, and staring out
into the black city which perhaps sheltered the woman I loved
somewhere amid its shadows, Jack Mount came up, peering through
the window with restless eyes.</p>

<p>"Cade has never returned to this tavern," he said, gloomily.
"No one here has either seen or heard of him since he and I left
last April for Cresap's camp."</p>
