<P>
Miss Cornelia sailed down to the little house one
drowsy afternoon, when the gulf was the faint,
bleached blue of the August seas, and the orange lilies
at the gate of Anne's garden held up their imperial
cups to be filled with the molten gold of August
sunshine.  Not that Miss Cornelia concerned herself
with painted oceans or sun-thirsty lilies.  She sat in
her favorite rocker in unusual idleness.  She sewed
not, neither did she spin.  Nor did she say a single
derogatory word concerning any portion of mankind.  In
short, Miss Cornelia's conversation was singularly
devoid of spice that day, and Gilbert, who had stayed
home to listen to her, instead of going a-fishing, as
he had intended, felt himself aggrieved.  What had come
over Miss Cornelia?  She did not look cast down or
worried.  On the contrary, there was a certain air of
nervous exultation about her.
<P>
"Where is Leslie?" she asked--not as if it mattered
much either.
<P>
"Owen and she went raspberrying in the woods back of
her farm," answered Anne.  "They won't be back before
supper time-- if then."
<P>
"They don't seem to have any idea that there is such a
thing as a clock," said Gilbert.  "I can't get to the
bottom of that affair.  I'm certain you women pulled
strings.  But Anne, undutiful wife, won't tell me. 
Will you, Miss Cornelia?"
<P>
"No, I shall not.  But," said Miss Cornelia, with the
air of one determined to take the plunge and have it
over, "I will tell you something else.  I came today on
purpose to tell it.  I am going to be married."
<P>
Anne and Gilbert were silent.  If Miss Cornelia had
announced her intention of going out to the channel and
drowning herself the thing might have been believable. 
This was not.  So they waited.  Of course Miss Cornelia
had made a mistake.
<P>
"Well, you both look sort of kerflummexed," said Miss
Cornelia, with a twinkle in her eyes.  Now that the
awkward moment of revelation was over, Miss Cornelia
was her own woman again.  "Do you think I'm too young
and inexperienced for matrimony?"
<P>
"You know--it IS rather staggering," said Gilbert,
trying to gather his wits together.  "I've heard you
say a score of times that you wouldn't marry the best
man in the world."
<P>
"I'm not going to marry the best man in the world,"
retorted Miss Cornelia.  "Marshall Elliott is a long
way from being the best."
<P>
"Are you going to marry Marshall Elliott?" exclaimed
Anne, recovering her power of speech under this second
shock.
<P>
"Yes.  I could have had him any time these twenty years
if I'd lifted my finger.  But do you suppose I was
going to walk into church beside a perambulating
haystack like that?"
<P>
"I am sure we are very glad--and we wish you all
possible happiness," said Anne, very flatly and
inadequately, as she felt.  She was not prepared for
such an occasion.  She had never imagined herself
offering betrothal felicitations to Miss Cornelia.
<P>
"Thanks, I knew you would," said Miss Cornelia.  "You
are the first of my friends to know it."
<P>
"We shall be so sorry to lose you, though, dear Miss
Cornelia," said Anne, beginning to be a little sad and
sentimental.
<P>
"Oh, you won't lose me," said Miss Cornelia
unsentimentally.  "You don't suppose I would live over
harbor with all those MacAllisters and Elliotts and
Crawfords, do you? `From the conceit of the Elliotts,
the pride of the MacAllisters and the vain-glory of the
Crawfords, good Lord deliver us.'  Marshall is coming
to live at my place.  I'm sick and tired of hired men. 
That Jim Hastings I've got this summer is positively
the worst of the species.  He would drive anyone to
getting married.  What do you think?  He upset the
churn yesterday and spilled a big churning of cream
over the yard.  And not one whit concerned about it was
he!  Just gave a foolish laugh and said cream was good
for the land.  Wasn't that like a man?  I told him I
wasn't in the habit of fertilising my back yard with
cream."
<P>
"Well, I wish you all manner of happiness too, Miss
Cornelia," said Gilbert, solemnly; "but," he added,
unable to resist the temptation to tease Miss Cornelia,
despite Anne's imploring eyes, "I fear your day of
independence is done.  As you know, Marshall Elliott is
a very determined man."
<P>
"I like a man who can stick to a thing," retorted Miss
Cornelia.  "Amos Grant, who used to be after me long
ago, couldn't.  You never saw such a weather-vane.  He
jumped into the pond to drown himself once and then
changed his mind and swum out again.  Wasn't that like
a man?  Marshall would have stuck to it and drowned."
<P>
"And he has a bit of a temper, they tell me,"
persisted Gilbert.
<P>
"He wouldn't be an Elliott if he hadn't.  I'm thankful
he has.  It will be real fun to make him mad.  And you
can generally do something with a tempery man when it
comes to repenting time.  But you can't do anything
with a man who just keeps placid and aggravating."
<P>
"You know he's a Grit, Miss Cornelia."
<P>
"Yes, he IS," admitted Miss Cornelia rather sadly. 
"And of course there is no hope of making a
Conservative of him.  But at least he is a
Presbyterian.  So I suppose I shall have to be
satisfied with that."
<P>
"Would you marry him if he were a Methodist, Miss
Cornelia?"
<P>
"No, I would not.  Politics is for this world, but
religion is for both."
<P>
"And you may be a `relict' after all, Miss Cornelia."
<P>
"Not I.  Marshall will live me out.  The Elliotts are
long-lived, and the Bryants are not."
<P>
"When are you to be married?" asked Anne.
<P>
"In about a month's time.  My wedding dress is to be
navy blue silk.  And I want to ask you, Anne, dearie,
if you think it would be all right to wear a veil with
a navy blue dress.  I've always thought I'd like to
wear a veil if I ever got married.  Marshall says to
have it if I want to.  Isn't that like a man?"
<P>
"Why shouldn't you wear it if you want to?" asked
Anne.
<P>
"Well, one doesn't want to be different from other
people," said Miss Cornelia, who was not noticeably
like anyone else on the face of the earth.  "As I say,
I do fancy a veil.  But maybe it shouldn't be worn with
any dress but a white one.  Please tell me, Anne,
dearie, what you really think.  I'll go by your
advice."
<P>
"I don't think veils are usually worn with any but
white dresses," admitted Anne, "but that is merely a
convention; and I am like Mr. Elliott, Miss Cornelia. 
I don't see any good reason why you shouldn't have a
veil if you want one."
<P>
But Miss Cornelia, who made her calls in calico
wrappers, shook her head.
<P>
"If it isn't the proper thing I won't wear it," she
said, with a sigh of regret for a lost dream.
<P>
"Since you are determined to be married, Miss
Cornelia," said Gilbert solemnly, "I shall give you
the excellent rules for the management of a husband
which my grandmother gave my mother when she married my
father."
<P>
"Well, I reckon I can manage Marshall Elliott," said
Miss Cornelia placidly.  "But let us hear your rules."
<P>
"The first one is, catch him."
<P>
"He's caught.  Go on."
<P>
"The second one is, feed him well."
<P>
"With enough pie.  What next?"
<P>
"The third and fourth are--keep your eye on him."
<P>
"I believe you," said Miss Cornelia emphatically.
