<p>"You remember me, Monsieur?" asked Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"Perfectly!" replied Arthur Rance. "I recognise you as the lad
at the bar. [The face of Rouletabille crimsoned at being called
a "lad."] I want to shake hands with you. You are a bright little
fellow."</p>

<p>The American extended his hand and Rouletabille, relaxing his
frown, shook it and introduced Mr. Arthur Rance to me. He invited
him to share our meal.</p>

<p>"No thanks. I breakfasted with Monsieur Stangerson."</p>

<p>Arthur Rance spoke French perfectly,&mdash;almost without an accent.</p>

<p>"I did not expect to have the pleasure of seeing you again, Monsieur.
I thought you were to have left France the day after the reception
at the Elysee."</p>

<p>Rouletabille and I, outwardly indifferent, listened most intently
for every word the American would say.</p>

<p>The man’s purplish red face, his heavy eyelids, the nervous twitchings,
all spoke of his addiction to drink. How came it that so sorry
a specimen of a man should be so intimate with Monsieur Stangerson?</p>

<p>Some days later, I learned from Frederic Larsan&mdash;who, like ourselves,
was surprised and mystified by his appearance and reception at
the chateau&mdash;that Mr. Rance had been an inebriate for only about
fifteen years; that is to say, since the professor and his daughter
left Philadelphia. During the time the Stangersons lived in America
they were very intimate with Arthur Rance, who was one of the
most distinguished phrenologists of the new world. Owing to new
experiments, he had made enormous strides beyond the science of
Gall and Lavater. The friendliness with which he was received
at the Glandier may be explained by the fact that he had once
rendered Mademoiselle Stangerson a great service by stopping,
at the peril of his own life, the runaway horses of her carriage.
The immediate result of that could, however, have been no more
than a mere friendly association with the Stangersons; certainly,
not a love affair.</p>

<p>Frederic Larsan did not tell me where he had picked up this information;
but he appeared to be quite sure of what he said.</p>

<p>Had we known these facts at the time Arthur Rance met us at the
Donjon Inn, his presence at the chateau might not have puzzled
us, but they could not have failed to increase our interest in
the man himself. The American must have been at least forty-five
years old. He spoke in a perfectly natural tone in reply to Rouletabille’s
question.</p>

<p>"I put off my return to America when I heard of the attack on
Mademoiselle Stangerson. I wanted to be certain the lady had not
been killed, and I shall not go away until she is perfectly recovered."</p>

<p>Arthur Rance then took the lead in talk, paying no heed to some
of Rouletabille’s questions. He gave us, without our inviting
him, his personal views on the subject of the tragedy,&mdash;views
which, as well as I could make out, were not far from those held
by Frederic Larzan. The American also thought that Robert Darzac
had something to do with the matter. He did not mention him by
name, but there was no room to doubt whom he meant. He told us
he was aware of the efforts young Rouletabille was making to unravel
the tangled skein of "The Yellow Room" mystery. He explained that
Monsieur Stangerson had related to him all that had taken place
in the inexplicable gallery. He several times expressed his regret
at Monsieur Darzac’s absence from the chateau on all these occasions,
and thought that Monsieur Darzac had done cleverly in allying
himself with Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille, who could not fail,
sooner or later, to discover the murderer. He spoke the last sentence
with unconcealed irony. Then he rose, bowed to us, and left the
inn.</p>

<p>Rouletabille watched him through the window.</p>

<p>"An odd fish, that!" he said.</p>

<p>"Do you think he’ll pass the night at the Glandier?" I asked.</p>

<p>To my amazement the young reporter answered that it was a matter
of entire indifference to him whether he did or not.</p>

<p>As to how we spent our time during the afternoon, all I need
say is that Rouletabille led me to the grotto of Sainte-Genevieve,
and, all the time, talked of every subject but the one in which
we were most interested. Towards evening I was surprised to find
Rouletabille making none of the preparations I had expected him
to make. I spoke to him about it when night had come on, and we
were once more in his room. He replied that all his arrangements
had already been made, and this time the murderer would not get
away from him.</p>

<p>I expressed some doubt on this, reminding him of his disappearance
in the gallery, and suggested that the same phenomenon might occur
again. He answered that he hoped it would. He desired nothing
more. I did not insist, knowing by experience how useless that
would have been. He told me that, with the help of the concierges,
the chateau had since early dawn been watched in such a way that
nobody could approach it without his knowing it, and that he had
no concern for those who might have left it and remained without.</p>

<p>It was then six o’clock by his watch. Rising, he made a sign
to me to follow him, and, without in the least trying to conceal
his movements or the sound of his footsteps, he led me through
the gallery. We reached the ‘right’ gallery and came to the landing-place
which we crossed. We then continued our way in the gallery of
the left wing, passing Professor Stangerson’s apartment.</p>

<p>At the far end of the gallery, before coming to the donjon, is
the room occupied by Arthur Rance. We knew that, because we had
seen him at the window looking on to the court. The door of the
room opens on to the end of the gallery, exactly facing the east
window, at the extremity of the ‘right’ gallery, where Rouletabille
had placed Daddy Jacques, and commands an uninterrupted view of
the gallery from end to end of the chateau.</p>

<p>"That ‘off-turning’ gallery," said Rouletabille, "I reserve for
myself; when I tell you you’ll come and take your place here."</p>

<p>And he made me enter a little dark, triangular closet built in
a bend of the wall, to the left of the door of Arthur Rance’s
room. From this recess I could see all that occurred in the gallery
as well as if I had been standing in front of Arthur Rance’s door,
and I could watch that door, too. The door of the closet, which
was to be my place of observation, was fitted with panels of transparent
glass. In the gallery, where all the lamps had been lit, it was
quite light. In the closet, however, it was quite dark. It was
a splendid place from which to observe and remain unobserved.</p>

<p>I was soon to play the part of a spy&mdash;a common policeman. I wonder
what my leader at the bar would have said had he known! I was
not altogether pleased with my duties, but I could not refuse
Rouletabille the assistance he had begged me to give him. I took
care not to make him see that I in the least objected, and for
several reasons. I wanted to oblige him; I did not wish him to
think me a coward; I was filled with curiosity; and it was too
late for me to draw back, even had I determined to do so. That
I had not had these scruples sooner was because my curiosity had
quite got the better of me. I might also urge that I was helping
to save the life of a woman, and even a lawyer may do that conscientiously.</p>

<p>We returned along the gallery. On reaching the door of Mademoiselle
Stangerson’s apartment, it opened from a push given by the steward
who was waiting at the dinner-table. (Monsieur Stangerson had,
for the last three days, dined with his daughter in the drawing-room
on the first floor.) As the door remained open, we distinctly
saw Mademoiselle Stangerson, taking advantage of the steward’s
absence, and while her father was stooping to pick up something
he had let fall, pour the contents of a phial into Monsieur Stangerson’s
glass.</p>
