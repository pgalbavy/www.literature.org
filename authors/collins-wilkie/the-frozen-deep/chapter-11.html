"Still at work!" Crayford exclaimed, looking at the
half-demolished bed-place. "Give yourself a little rest, Richard.
The exploring party is ready to start. If you wish to take leave
of your brother officers before they go, you have no time to
lose."
<P>
He checked himself there, looking Wardour full in the face.
<P>
"Good Heavens!" he cried, "how pale you are! Has anything
happened?"
<P>
Frank--searching in his locker for articles of clothing which he
might require on the journey--looked round. He was startled, as
Crayford had been startled, by the sudden change in Wardour since
they had last seen him.
<P>
"Are you ill?" he asked. "I hear you have been doing Bateson's
work for him. Have you hurt yourself?"
<P>
Wardour suddenly moved his head, so as to hide his face from both
Crayford and Frank. He took out his handkerchief, and wound it
clumsily round his left hand.
<P>
"Yes," he said; "I hurt myself with the ax. It's nothing. Never
mind. Pain always has a curious effect on me. I tell you it's
nothing! Don't notice it!"
<P>
He turned his face toward them again as suddenly as he had turned
it away. He advanced a few steps, and addressed himself with an
uneasy familiarity to Frank.
<P>
"I didn't answer you civilly when you spoke to me some little
time since. I mean when I first came in here along with the rest
of them. I apologize. Shake hands! How are you? Ready for the
march?"
<P>
Frank met the oddly abrupt advance which had been made to him
with perfect good humor.
<P>
"I am glad to be friends with you, Mr. Wardour. I wish I was as
well seasoned to fatigue as you are."
<P>
Wardour burst into a hard, joyless, unnatural laugh.
<P>
"Not strong, eh? You don't look it. The dice had better have sent
me away, and kept you here. I never felt in better condition in
my life." He paused and added, with his eye on Frank and with a
strong emphasis on the words: "We men of Kent are made of tough
material."
<P>
Frank advanced a step on his side, with a new interest in Richard
Wardour.
<P>
"You come from Kent?" he said.
<P>
"Yes. From East Kent." He waited a little once more, and looked
hard at Frank. "Do you know that part of the country?" he asked.
<P>
"I ought to know something about East Kent," Frank answered.
"Some dear friends of mine once lived there."
<P>
"Friends of yours?" Wardour repeated. "One of the county
families, I suppose?"
<P>
As he put the question, he abruptly looked over his shoulder. He
was standing between Crayford and Frank. Crayford, taking no part
in the conversation, had been watching him, and listening to him
more and more attentively as that conversation went on. Within
the last moment or two Wardour had become instinctively conscious
of this. He resented Crayford's conduct with needless
irritability.
<P>
"Why are you staring at me?" he asked.
<P>
"Why are you looking unlike yourself?" Crayford answered,
quietly.
<P>
Wardour made no reply. He renewed the conversation with Frank.
<P>
"One of the county families?" he resumed. "The Winterbys of Yew
Grange, I dare say?"
<P>
"No," said Frank; "but friends of the Witherbys, very likely. The
Burnhams."
<P>
Desperately as he struggled to maintain it, Wardour's
self-control failed him. He started violently. The clumsily-wound
handkerchief fell off his hand. Still looking at him attentively,
Crayford picked it up.
<P>
"There is your handkerchief, Richard," he said. "Strange!"
<P>
"What is strange?"
<P>
"You told us you had hurt yourself with the ax--"
<P>
"Well?"
<P>
"There is no blood on your handkerchief."
<P>
Wardour snatched the handkerchief out of Crayford's hand, and,
turning away, approached the outer door of the hut. "No blood on
the handkerchief," he said to himself. "There may be a stain or
two when Crayford sees it again." He stopped within a few paces
of the door, and spoke to Crayford. "You recommended me to take
leave of my brother officers before it was too late," he said. "I
am going to follow your advice."
<P>
The door was opened from the outer side as he laid his hand on
the lock.
<P>
One of the quartermasters of the _Wanderer_ entered the hut.
<P>
"Is Captain Helding here, sir?" he asked, addressing himself to
Wardour.
<P>
Wardour pointed to Crayford.
<P>
"The lieutenant will tell you," he said.
<P>
Crayford advanced and questioned the quartermaster. "What do you
want with Captain Helding?" he asked.
<P>
"I have a report to make, sir. There has been an accident on the
ice."
<P>
"To one of your men?"
<P>
"No, sir. To one of our officers."
<P>
Wardour, on the point of going out, paused when the quartermaster
made that reply. For a moment he considered with himself. Then he
walked slowly back to the part of the room in which Frank was
standing. Crayford, directing the quartermaster, pointed to the
arched door way in the side of the hut.
<P>
"I am sorry to hear of the accident," he said. "You will find
Captain Helding in that room."
<P>
For the second time, with singular persistency, Wardour renewed
the conversation with Frank.
<P>
"So you knew the Burnhams?" he said. "What became of Clara when
her father died?"
<P>
Frank's face flushed angrily on the instant.
<P>
"Clara!" he repeated. "What authorizes you to speak of Miss
Burnham in that familiar manner?"
<P>
Wardour seized the opportunity of quarreling with him.
<P>
"What right have you to ask?" he retorted, coarsely.
<P>
Frank's blood was up. He forgot his promise to Clara to keep
their engagement secret--he forgot everything but the unbridled
insolence of Wardour's language and manner.
<P>
"A right which I insist on your respecting," he answered. "The
right of being engaged to marry her."
<P>
Crayford's steady eyes were still on the watch, and Wardour felt
them on him. A little more and Crayford might openly interfere.
Even Wardour recognized for once the necessity of controlling his
temper, cost him what it might. He made his apologies, with
overstrained politeness, to Frank.
<P>
"Impos sible to dispute such a right as yours," he said. "Perhaps
you will excuse me when you know that I am one of Miss Burnham's
old friends. My father and her father were neighbors. We have
always met like brother and sister--"
<P>
Frank generously stopped the apology there.
<P>
"Say no more," he interposed. "I was in the wrong--I lost my
temper. Pray forgive me."
<P>
Wardour looked at him with a strange, reluctant interest while he
was speaking. Wardour asked an extraordinary question when he had
done.
<P>
"Is she very fond of you?"
<P>
Frank burst out laughing.
<P>
"My dear fellow," he said, "come to our wedding, and judge for
yourself."
<P>
"Come to your wedding?" As he repeated the words Wardour stole
one glance at Frank which Frank (employed in buckling his
knapsack) failed to see. Crayford noticed it, and Crayford's
blood ran cold. Comparing the words which Wardour had spoken to
him while they were alone together with the words that had just
passed in his presence, he could draw but one conclusion. The
woman whom Wardour had loved and lost was--Clara Burnham. The man
who had robbed him of her was Frank Aldersley. And Wardour had
discovered it in the interval since they had last met. "Thank
God!" thought Crayford, "the dice have parted them! Frank goes
with the expedition, and Wardour stays behind with me."
<P>
The reflection had barely occurred to him--Frank's thoughtless
invitation to Wardour had just passed his lips--when the canvas
screen over the doorway was drawn aside. Captain Helding and the
officers who were to leave with the exploring party returned to
the main room on their way out. Seeing Crayford, Captain Helding
stopped to speak to him.
<P>
"I have a casualty to report," said the captain, "which
diminishes our numbers by one. My second lieutenant, who was to
have joined the exploring party, has had a fall on the ice.
Judging by what the quartermaster tells me, I am afraid the poor
fellow has broken his leg."
<P>
"I will supply his place," cried a voice at the other end of the
hut.
<P>
Everybody looked round. The man who had spoken was Richard
Wardour.
<P>
Crayford instantly interfered--so vehemently as to astonish all
who knew him.
<P>
"No!" he said. "Not you, Richard! not you!"
<P>
"Why not?" Wardour asked, sternly.
<P>
"Why not, indeed?" added Captain Helding. "Wardour is the very
man to be useful on a long march. He is in perfect health, and he
is the best shot among us. I was on the point of proposing him
myself."
<P>
Crayford failed to show his customary respect for his superior
officer. He openly disputed the captain's conclusion.
<P>
"Wardour has no right to volunteer," he rejoined. "It has been
settled, Captain Helding, that chance shall decide who is to go
and who is to stay."
<P>
"And chance _has_ decided it," cried Wardour. "Do you think we
are going to cast the dice again, and give an officer of the
_Sea-mew_ a chance of replacing an officer of the _Wanderer_?
There is a vacancy in our party, not in yours; and we claim the
right of filling it as we please. I volunteer, and my captain
backs me. Whose authority is to keep me here after that?"
<P>
"Gently, Wardour," said Captain Helding. "A man who is in the
right can afford to speak with moderation." He turned to
Crayford. "You must admit yourself," he continued, "that Wardour
is right this time. The missing man belongs to my command, and in
common justice one of my officers ought to supply his place."
<P>
It was impossible to dispute the matter further. The dullest man
present could see that the captain's reply was unanswerable. In
sheer despair, Crayford took Frank's arm and led him aside a few
steps. The last chance left of parting the two men was the chance
of appealing to Frank.
<P>
"My dear boy," he began, "I want to say one friendly word to you
on the subject of your health. I have already, if you remember,
expressed my doubts whether you are strong enough to make one of
an exploring party. I feel those doubts more strongly than ever
at this moment. Will you take the advice of a friend who wishes
you well?"
<P>
Wardour had followed Crayford. Wardour roughly interposed before
Frank could reply.
<P>
"Let him alone!"
<P>
Crayford paid no heed to the interruption. He was too earnestly
bent on withdrawing Frank from the expedition to notice anything
that was said or done by the persons about him.
<P>
"Don't, pray don't, risk hardships which you are unfit to bear!"
he went on, entreatingly. "Your place can be easily filled.
Change your mind, Frank. Stay here with me."
<P>
Again Wardour interfered. Again he called out, "Leave him alone!"
more roughly than ever. Still deaf and blind to every
consideration but one, Crayford pressed his entreaties on Frank.
<P>
"You owned yourself just now that you were not well seasoned to
fatigue," he persisted. "You feel (you _must_ feel) how weak that
last illness has left you? You know (I am sure you know) how
unfit you are to brave exposure to cold, and long marches over
the snow."
<P>
Irritated beyond endurance by Crayford's obstinacy; seeing, or
thinking he saw, signs of yielding in Frank's face, Wardour so
far forgot himself as to seize Crayford by the arm and attempt to
drag him away from Frank. Crayford turned and looked at him.
<P>
"Richard," he said, very quietly, "you are not yourself. I pity
you. Drop your hand."
<P>
Wardour relaxed his hold, with something of the sullen submission
of a wild animal to its keeper. The momentary silence which
followed gave Frank an opportunity of speaking at last.
<P>
"I am gratefully sensible, Crayford," he began, "of the interest
which you take in me--"
<P>
"And you will follow my advice?" Crayford interposed, eagerly.
<P>
"My mind is made up, old friend," Frank answered, firmly and
sadly. "Forgive me for disappointing you. I am appointed to the
expedition. With the expedition I go." He moved nearer to
Wardour. In his innocence of all suspicion he clapped Wardour
heartily on the shoulder. "When I feel the fatigue," said poor
simple Frank, "you will help me, comrade--won't you? Come along!"
<P>
Wardour snatched his gun out of the hands of the sailor who was
carrying it for him. His dark face became suddenly irradiated
with a terrible joy.
<P>
"Come!" he cried. "Over the snow and over the ice! Come! where no
human footsteps have ever trodden, and where no human trace is
ever left."
<P>
Blindly, instinctively, Crayford made an effort to part them. His
brother officers, standing near, pulled him back. They looked at
each other anxiously. The merciless cold, striking its victims in
various ways, had struck in some instances at their reason first.
Everybody loved Crayford. Was he, too, going on the dark way that
others had taken before him? They forced him to seat himself on
one of the lockers. "Steady, old fellow!" they said
kindly--"steady!" Crayford yielded, writhing inwardly under the
sense of his own helplessness. What in God's name could he do?
Could he denounce Wardour to Captain Helding on bare
suspicion--without so much as the shadow of a proof to justify
what he said? The captain would decline to insult one of his
officers by even mentioning the monstrous accusation to him. The
captain would conclude, as others had already concluded, that
Crayford's mind was giving way under stress of cold and
privation. No hope--literally, no hope now, but in the numbers of
the expedition. Officers and men, they all liked Frank. As long
as they could stir hand or foot, they would help him on the
way--they would see that no harm came to him.
<P>
The word of command was given; the door was thrown open; the hut
emptied rapidly. Over the merciless white snow--under the
merciless black sky--the exploring party began to move. The sick
and helpless men, whose last hope of rescue centered in their
departing messmates, cheered faintly. Some few whose days were
numbered sobbed and cried like women. Frank's voice faltered as
he turned back at the door to say his last words to the friend
who had been a father to him.
<P>
"God bless you, Crayford!"
<P>
Crayford broke away from the officers near him; and, hurrying
forward, seized Frank by both hands. Crayford held him as if he
would never let him go.
<P>
"God preserve you, Frank! I would give all I have in the world to
be with you. Good-by! Good-by!"
<P>
Frank waved his  hand--das hed away the tears that were gathering
in his eyes--and hurried out. Crayford called after him, the
last, the only warning that he could give:
<P>
"While you can stand, keep with the main body, Frank!"
<P>
Wardour, waiting till the last--Wardour, following Frank through
the snow-drift--stopped, stepped back, and answered Crayford at
the door:
<P>
"While he can stand, he keeps with Me."
