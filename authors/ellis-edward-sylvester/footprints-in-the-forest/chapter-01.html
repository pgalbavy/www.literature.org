<p>Those of my friends who have done me the honor of reading "Campfire
and Wigwam," will need little help to recall the situation at
the close of that narrative. The German lad Otto Relstaub, having
lost his horse, while on the way from Kentucky to the territory
of Louisiana (their destination being a part of the present State
of Missouri), he and his young friend, Jack Carleton, set out
to hunt for the missing animal. Naturally enough they failed:
not only that, but the two fell into the hands of a band of wandering
Sauk Indians, who held them prisoners.</p>

<p>Directly after the capture of the lads, their captors parted
company, five going in one direction with Jack and the other five
taking a different course with Otto. "Camp-Fire and Wigwam" gave
the particulars of what befell Jack Carleton. In this story, I
propose to tell all about the hunt that was made for the honest
lad, who had few friends, and who had been driven from his own
home by the cruelty of his parents to engage in a search which
would have been laughable in its absurdity, but for the danger
that marked it from the beginning.</p>

<p>The youth, however, had three devoted friends in Jack Carleton,
his mother, and Deerfoot, the Shawanoe. But for the compassion
which the good woman felt for the lad, she never would have consented
that her beloved son should enter the wilderness for the purpose
of bringing him home.</p>

<p>One fact must be borne in mind, however, in recalling the two
expeditions. In the former Jack and Otto were the actors, but
now the hunters were Jack and Deerfoot, and therein lay all the
difference in the world. Well aware of the wonderful woodcraft
of the young warrior, his courage and devotion to his friends,
the parent had little if any misgivings, when she kissed her boy
good-by, and saw him enter the wilderness in the company of the
dusky Shawanoe.</p>

<p>Something like a fortnight had gone by, when Deerfoot and Jack
Carleton sat near a camp-fire which had been kindled in the depths
of the forest, well to the westward of the little frontier settlement
of Martinsville. The air was crisp and cool, and two days had
passed since any rain had fallen, so the climate could not have
been more favorable.</p>

<p>The camp was similar to many that have been described before,
and with which the reader has become familiar long ago. It was
simply a small pile of blazing sticks, started close to a large
tree, with a little stream of water winding just beyond. More
wood was heaped near, and Jack was lolling lazily on the blanket
which he had brought with him, while his friend sat on the pile
of sticks opposite.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot, you remember I told you that while I was in the lodge
of Ogallah, an Indian came in who was one of the five that had
taken Otto away?"</p>

<p>The Shawanoe nodded his head to signify he recalled the incident.</p>

<p>"He made some of the queerest gestures to me, which I could no
more understand than I could make out what his gibberish meant,
but when I described his actions to you, you said they meant that
Otto was still alive&mdash;that is, so far as the Indian knew?"</p>

<p>"My brother speaks the truth: such was the message of the Sauk
warrior."</p>

<p>"They say all the red men can talk with each other by means of
signs, but, without asking you to explain every word of the Sauk,
I would like to hear again what it was he meant to tell me."</p>

<p>"He said that Otto had been given to a party of Indians, and
they had started westward toward the setting sun with him."</p>

<p>"But why did they turn him over to the strangers?"</p>

<p>"Deerfoot was not there to ask the Sauk," was the reply of the
young Shawanoe.</p>

<p>"That is true, for if you had been, you would have known all
about it; but, old fellow, you can explain one thing: why do you
not make your way to the Sauk village and get those warriors to
give you the particulars?"</p>

<p>Such it would seem was the true course of the dusky youth, on
whom it may be said the success or failure of the enterprise rested.
He was silent a minute as though the question caused him some
thought.</p>

<p>"It may be my brother is right, but it is a long ways to the
lodges of the Sauks, and when they were reached it may be they
could tell no more than Deerfoot knows."</p>

<p>Jack Carleton did not understand this remark.</p>

<p>He knew how little information he had given his friend, and it
seemed idle to say that the real captors of Otto Relstaub could
not tell more of him.</p>

<p>Strange things happen in this life. Several times during the
afternoon Deerfoot stopped and glanced about him, just as Jack
had seen him do when enemies were in the wood. He made no remark
by way of explanation, and his friend asked him no question.</p>

<p>"It seems to me the Sauks can tell a good deal more than I; for
instance&mdash;"</p>

<p>Deerfoot suddenly raised his forefinger and leaned his head forward
and sideways. It was his attitude of intense attention, and he
had signaled for Jack to hold his peace. The tableau lasted a
full minute. Then Deerfoot looked toward his friend, and smiled
and nodded, as if to say it had turned out just as he expected.</p>

<p>"What in the name of the mischief <em>is</em> the matter?" asked
Jack, unable longer to repress his curiosity; "you've been acting
queer all the afternoon."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot and his friend have been followed by some Indian warrior
for many miles. He is not far away; he is now coming softly toward
the camp; I have heard him often; he is near at hand."</p>

<p>"If he wants to make our acquaintance, there is no reason why
he should feel so bashful," remarked Jack, glancing at different
points in the darkening woods; "I don't see any reason why he
should prowl around in that fashion."</p>

<p>The lad's uneasiness was increased by the fact that Deerfoot
was manifestly looking over his head and into the forest behind
Jack, as though the object which caused his remarks was coming
from that direction.</p>

<p>"The Indian is not far off&mdash;he is coming this way&mdash;he will be
in camp in a breath."</p>

<p>"And, if I stay here, he will stumble over me and perhaps break
his neck," remarked Jack, who caught the rustle of leaves, and
springing to his feet, faced toward the point whence the stranger
was approaching.</p>

<p>It can not be said that the youth felt any special alarm, for
he knew the sagacious Deerfoot would take care of him, but the
knowledge that an armed stranger is stealing up behind a person,
is calculated to make him nervous.</p>

<p>At the moment Jack faced about, he caught the outlines of a middle-aged
warrior, who strode noiselessly from the wood and stepped into
the full glare of the camp light. Without noticing Jack, he advanced
to Deerfoot, who shook him by the hand, while the two spoke some
words in a tongue which the lad did not understand.</p>

<p>But when the visitor stood revealed in the firelight, the boy
looked him over and recognized him. He was the Indian who came
into the hut of Ogallah, the Sauk chieftain, when Jack was a captive,
and who went through the odd gesticulations, which the lad remembered
well enough to repeat to Deerfoot, who, in turn, interpreted them
to mean that Otto Relstaub had not been put to death, as the two
youths had feared.</p>

<p>It was strange indeed that he should come to the camp of the
lads, at the very time they were in need of such information as
he could give.</p>

<p>While Jack identified the visitor as that personage, Deerfoot
recognized him even sooner as Hay-uta, the Man-who-Runs-without-Falling.
It was he who, while on a hunt for scalps, came upon the young
Shawanoe and engaged him in a hand-to-hand encounter. You will
recall how he was disarmed and vanquished by the younger warrior,
and how the latter read to him from his Bible, and told him of
the Great Spirit who dwelt beyond the stars, and whose will was
contained in the little volume which was the companion of the
Shawanoe. Hay-uta showed he was deeply impressed, and abruptly
went away.</p>

<p>It will be remembered, therefore, that there were peculiar circumstances
which caused the two red men to feel friendly toward each other
and which led them to spend several minutes talking with such
earnestness that neither seemed aware that another party was near.
Jack did not object, but busied himself in studying the two aborigines.</p>

<p>Hay-uta has been already described as a middle-aged warrior.
He was strong, iron-limbed and daring, but was not to be compared
as respects grace, dignity and manly beauty to Deerfoot. What
specially attracted Jack's attention was the rifle which he idly
held with one hand while talking, the stock resting on the ground.
It was the finest weapon the lad had ever seen&mdash;that is so far
as appearance went. The stock was ornamented with silver, and
the make and finish were as complete as was ever seen in those
days. It was a rifle that would awaken admiration anywhere.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if he shot the owner so as to get it," thought
the lad.</p>

<p>But therein he did the Sauk injustice. The savage gave all the
furs and peltries that he was able to take during an entire winter
to a white trader from St. Louis, who with a similar weapon bought
enough more supplies to load him and his animal for their return
trip to that frontier post.</p>

<p>While Hay-uta and Deerfoot talked, they smiled, nodded and gesticulated
continually. Of course the watcher could not guess what they were
talking about, until he noticed that Hay-uta was making the same
motions that he saw him use in the lodge of Ogallah, adding, however,
several variations which the youth was unable to recall.</p>

<p>"By George!" muttered Jack, "they're talking about Otto; now
I shall learn something of him."</p>

<p>When the conversation had lasted some minutes, the talkers appeared
to become aware that a third party was near. A remark of Deerfoot
caused Hay-uta to turn and look at the young man, as though uncertain
that he had ever met him before.</p>

<p>"Hay-uta has traveled a long ways since my brother saw him,"
said Deerfoot, who did not deem it worth while to explain why
it was he had made such a journey: "he followed us a good while
before he knew I was his friend; then he came to the camp that
he might talk with me."</p>

<p>Hay-uta, though unable to understand these words, seemed to catch
their meaning from the tone of Deerfoot, for they were scarcely
spoken, when he extended his hand to Jack, who, of course, pressed
it warmly and looked the welcome which he could not put into words
that would be understood.</p>

<p>These ceremonies over, all three sat on the ground, Hay-uta lit
his pipe and the singular conversation continued, Deerfoot interpreting
to his friend, when he had any thing to tell that would interest
him.</p>

<p>"What does he know about Otto?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"He cannot tell much: the warriors who made him prisoner walked
slowly till the next morning; they took another path to their
lodges; on the road they met some strange Indians, and they sold
our brother to them for two blankets, some wampum, a knife and
three strings of beads."</p>

<p>"How many Indians were there in the party that bought Otto"</p>

<p>Deerfoot conferred with Hay-uta before answering.</p>

<p>"Four: they were large, strong and brave, and they wanted our
brother; so he was sold, as the young man was sold by his brothers
and taken into a far land, and afterward became the great chief
of the country, and the friend of his brethren and aged father."</p>

<p>Astonished as was Jack Carleton to hear these tidings, he was
more astonished to note that the young Shawanoe was comparing
the experience of Otto Relstaub with that of the touching narrative
told in the Old Testament of Joseph and his brethren.</p>
