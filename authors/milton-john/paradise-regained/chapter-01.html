I, WHO erewhile the happy Garden sung<BR>
By one man's disobedience lost, now sing<BR>
Recovered Paradise to all mankind,<BR>
By one man's firm obedience fully tried<BR>
Through all temptation, and the Tempter foiled<BR>
In all his wiles, defeated and repulsed,<BR>
And Eden raised in the waste Wilderness.<BR>
<BR>
  Thou Spirit, who led'st this glorious Eremite<BR>
Into the desert, his victorious field<BR>
Against the spiritual foe, and brought'st him thence<BR>
By proof the undoubted Son of God, inspire,<BR>
As thou art wont, my prompted song, else mute,<BR>
And bear through highth or depth of Nature's bounds,<BR>
With prosperous wing full summed, to tell of deeds<BR>
Above heroic, though in secret done,<BR>
And unrecorded left through many an age:<BR>
Worthy to have not remained so long unsung.<BR>
<BR>
  Now had the great Proclaimer, with a voice<BR>
More awful than the sound of trumpet, cried<BR>
Repentance, and Heaven's kingdom nigh at hand<BR>
To all baptized.  To his great baptism flocked<BR>
With awe the regions round, and with them came<BR>
From Nazareth the son of Joseph deemed<BR>
To the flood Jordan--came as then obscure,<BR>
Unmarked, unknown.  But him the Baptist soon<BR>
Descried, divinely warned, and witness bore<BR>
As to his worthier, and would have resigned<BR>
To him his heavenly office.  Nor was long<BR>
His witness unconfirmed: on him baptized<BR>
Heaven opened, and in likeness of a Dove<BR>
The Spirit descended, while the Father's voice<BR>
From Heaven pronounced him his beloved Son.<BR>
That heard the Adversary, who, roving still<BR>
About the world, at that assembly famed<BR>
Would not be last, and, with the voice divine<BR>
Nigh thunder-struck, the exalted man to whom<BR>
Such high attest was given a while surveyed<BR>
With wonder; then, with envy fraught and rage,<BR>
Flies to his place, nor rests, but in mid air<BR>
To council summons all his mighty Peers,<BR>
Within thick clouds and dark tenfold involved,<BR>
A gloomy consistory; and them amidst,<BR>
With looks aghast and sad, he thus bespake:--<BR>
<BR>
  "O ancient Powers of Air and this wide World<BR>
(For much more willingly I mention Air,<BR>
This our old conquest, than remember Hell,<BR>
Our hated habitation), well ye know<BR>
How many ages, as the years of men,<BR>
This Universe we have possessed, and ruled<BR>
In manner at our will the affairs of Earth,<BR>
Since Adam and his facile consort Eve<BR>
Lost Paradise, deceived by me, though since<BR>
With dread attending when that fatal wound<BR>
Shall be inflicted by the seed of Eve<BR>
Upon my head.  Long the decrees of Heaven<BR>
Delay, for longest time to Him is short;<BR>
And now, too soon for us, the circling hours<BR>
This dreaded time have compassed, wherein we<BR>
Must bide the stroke of that long-threatened wound<BR>
(At least, if so we can, and by the head<BR>
Broken be not intended all our power<BR>
To be infringed, our freedom and our being<BR>
In this fair empire won of Earth and Air)--<BR>
For this ill news I bring: The Woman's Seed,<BR>
Destined to this, is late of woman born.<BR>
His birth to our just fear gave no small cause;<BR>
But his growth now to youth's full flower, displaying<BR>
All virtue, grace and wisdom to achieve<BR>
Things highest, greatest, multiplies my fear.<BR>
Before him a great Prophet, to proclaim<BR>
His coming, is sent harbinger, who all<BR>
Invites, and in the consecrated stream<BR>
Pretends to wash off sin, and fit them so<BR>
Purified to receive him pure, or rather<BR>
To do him honour as their King.  All come,<BR>
And he himself among them was baptized--<BR>
Not thence to be more pure, but to receive<BR>
The testimony of Heaven, that who he is<BR>
Thenceforth the nations may not doubt.  I saw<BR>
The Prophet do him reverence; on him, rising<BR>
Out of the water, Heaven above the clouds<BR>
Unfold her crystal doors; thence on his head<BR>
A perfet Dove descend (whate'er it meant);<BR>
And out of Heaven the sovraign voice I heard,<BR>
'This is my Son beloved,--in him am pleased.'<BR>
His mother, than, is mortal, but his Sire<BR>
He who obtains the monarchy of Heaven;<BR>
And what will He not do to advance his Son?<BR>
His first-begot we know, and sore have felt,<BR>
When his fierce thunder drove us to the Deep;<BR>
Who this is we must learn, for Man he seems<BR>
In all his lineaments, though in his face<BR>
The glimpses of his Father's glory shine.<BR>
Ye see our danger on the utmost edge<BR>
Of hazard, which admits no long debate,<BR>
But must with something sudden be opposed<BR>
(Not force, but well-couched fraud, well-woven snares),<BR>
Ere in the head of nations he appear,<BR>
Their king, their leader, and supreme on Earth.<BR>
I, when no other durst, sole undertook<BR>
The dismal expedition to find out<BR>
And ruin Adam, and the exploit performed<BR>
Successfully: a calmer voyage now<BR>
Will waft me; and the way found prosperous once<BR>
Induces best to hope of like success."<BR>
<BR>
  He ended, and his words impression left<BR>
Of much amazement to the infernal crew,<BR>
Distracted and surprised with deep dismay<BR>
At these sad tidings.  But no time was then<BR>
For long indulgence to their fears or grief:<BR>
Unanimous they all commit the care<BR>
And management of this man enterprise<BR>
To him, their great Dictator, whose attempt<BR>
At first against mankind so well had thrived<BR>
In Adam's overthrow, and led their march<BR>
From Hell's deep-vaulted den to dwell in light,<BR>
Regents, and potentates, and kings, yea gods,<BR>
Of many a pleasant realm and province wide.<BR>
So to the coast of Jordan he directs<BR>
His easy steps, girded with snaky wiles,<BR>
Where he might likeliest find this new-declared,<BR>
This man of men, attested Son of God,<BR>
Temptation and all guile on him to try--<BR>
So to subvert whom he suspected raised<BR>
To end his reign on Earth so long enjoyed:<BR>
But, contrary, unweeting he fulfilled<BR>
The purposed counsel, pre-ordained and fixed,<BR>
Of the Most High, who, in full frequence bright<BR>
Of Angels, thus to Gabriel smiling spake:--<BR>
<BR>
  "Gabriel, this day, by proof, thou shalt behold,<BR>
Thou and all Angels conversant on Earth<BR>
With Man or men's affairs, how I begin<BR>
To verify that solemn message late,<BR>
On which I sent thee to the Virgin pure<BR>
In Galilee, that she should bear a son,<BR>
Great in renown, and called the Son of God.<BR>
Then told'st her, doubting how these things could be<BR>
To her a virgin, that on her should come<BR>
The Holy Ghost, and the power of the Highest<BR>
O'ershadow her.  This Man, born and now upgrown,<BR>
To shew him worthy of his birth divine<BR>
And high prediction, henceforth I expose<BR>
To Satan; let him tempt, and now assay<BR>
His utmost subtlety, because he boasts<BR>
And vaunts of his great cunning to the throng<BR>
Of his Apostasy.  He might have learnt<BR>
Less overweening, since he failed in Job,<BR>
Whose constant perseverance overcame<BR>
Whate'er his cruel malice could invent.<BR>
He now shall know I can produce a man,<BR>
Of female seed, far abler to resist<BR>
All his solicitations, and at length<BR>
All his vast force, and drive him back to Hell--<BR>
Winning by conquest what the first man lost<BR>
By fallacy surprised.  But first I mean<BR>
To exercise him in the Wilderness;<BR>
There he shall first lay down the rudiments<BR>
Of his great warfare, ere I send him forth<BR>
To conquer Sin and Death, the two grand foes.<BR>
By humiliation and strong sufferance<BR>
His weakness shall o'ercome Satanic strength,<BR>
And all the world, and mass of sinful flesh;<BR>
That all the Angels and aethereal Powers--<BR>
They now, and men hereafter--may discern<BR>
From what consummate virtue I have chose<BR>
This perfet man, by merit called my Son,<BR>
To earn salvation for the sons of men."<BR>
<BR>
  So spake the Eternal Father, and all Heaven<BR>
Admiring stood a space; then into hymns<BR>
Burst forth, and in celestial measures moved,<BR>
Circling the throne and singing, while the hand<BR>
Sung with the voice, and this the argument:--<BR>
<BR>
  "Victory and triumph to the Son of God,<BR>
Now entering his great duel, not of arms,<BR>
But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles!<BR>
The Father knows the Son; therefore secure<BR>
Ventures his filial virtue, though untried,<BR>
Against whate'er may tempt, whate'er seduce,<BR>
Allure, or terrify, or undermine.<BR>
Be frustrate, all ye stratagems of Hell,<BR>
And, devilish machinations, come to nought!"<BR>
<BR>
  So they in Heaven their odes and vigils tuned.<BR>
Meanwhile the Son of God, who yet some days<BR>
Lodged in Bethabara, where John baptized,<BR>
Musing and much revolving in his breast<BR>
How best the mighty work he might begin<BR>
Of Saviour to mankind, and which way first<BR>
Publish his godlike office now mature,<BR>
One day forth walked alone, the Spirit leading<BR>
And his deep thoughts, the better to converse<BR>
With solitude, till, far from track of men,<BR>
Thought following thought, and step by step led on,<BR>
He entered now the bordering Desert wild,<BR>
And, with dark shades and rocks environed round,<BR>
His holy meditations thus pursued:--<BR>
<BR>
  "O what a multitude of thoughts at once<BR>
Awakened in me swarm, while I consider<BR>
What from within I feel myself, and hear<BR>
What from without comes often to my ears,<BR>
Ill sorting with my present state compared!<BR>
When I was yet a child, no childish play<BR>
To me was pleasing; all my mind was set<BR>
Serious to learn and know, and thence to do,<BR>
What might be public good; myself I thought<BR>
Born to that end, born to promote all truth,<BR>
All righteous things.  Therefore, above my years,<BR>
The Law of God I read, and found it sweet;<BR>
Made it my whole delight, and in it grew<BR>
To such perfection that, ere yet my age<BR>
Had measured twice six years, at our great Feast<BR>
I went into the Temple, there to hear<BR>
The teachers of our Law, and to propose<BR>
What might improve my knowledge or their own,<BR>
And was admired by all.  Yet this not all<BR>
To which my spirit aspired.  Victorious deeds<BR>
Flamed in my heart, heroic acts--one while<BR>
To rescue Israel from the Roman yoke;<BR>
Then to subdue and quell, o'er all the earth,<BR>
Brute violence and proud tyrannic power,<BR>
Till truth were freed, and equity restored:<BR>
Yet held it more humane, more heavenly, first<BR>
By winning words to conquer willing hearts,<BR>
And make persuasion do the work of fear;<BR>
At least to try, and teach the erring soul,<BR>
Not wilfully misdoing, but unware<BR>
Misled; the stubborn only to subdue.<BR>
These growing thoughts my mother soon perceiving,<BR>
By words at times cast forth, inly rejoiced,<BR>
And said to me apart, 'High are thy thoughts,<BR>
O Son! but nourish them, and let them soar<BR>
To what highth sacred virtue and true worth<BR>
Can raise them, though above example high;<BR>
By matchless deeds express thy matchless Sire.<BR>
For know, thou art no son of mortal man;<BR>
Though men esteem thee low of parentage,<BR>
Thy Father is the Eternal King who rules<BR>
All Heaven and Earth, Angels and sons of men.<BR>
A messenger from God foretold thy birth<BR>
Conceived in me a virgin; he foretold<BR>
Thou shouldst be great, and sit on David's throne,<BR>
And of thy kingdom there should be no end.<BR>
At thy nativity a glorious quire<BR>
Of Angels, in the fields of Bethlehem, sung<BR>
To shepherds, watching at their folds by night,<BR>
And told them the Messiah now was born,<BR>
Where they might see him; and to thee they came,<BR>
Directed to the manger where thou lay'st;<BR>
For in the inn was left no better room.<BR>
A Star, not seen before, in heaven appearing,<BR>
Guided the Wise Men thither from the East,<BR>
To honour thee with incense, myrrh, and gold;<BR>
By whose bright course led on they found the place,<BR>
Affirming it thy star, new-graven in heaven,<BR>
By which they knew thee King of Israel born.<BR>
Just Simeon and prophetic Anna, warned<BR>
By vision, found thee in the Temple, and spake,<BR>
Before the altar and the vested priest,<BR>
Like things of thee to all that present stood.'<BR>
This having heart, straight I again revolved<BR>
The Law and Prophets, searching what was writ<BR>
Concerning the Messiah, to our scribes<BR>
Known partly, and soon found of whom they spake<BR>
I am--this chiefly, that my way must lie<BR>
Through many a hard assay, even to the death,<BR>
Ere I the promised kingdom can attain,<BR>
Or work redemption for mankind, whose sins'<BR>
Full weight must be transferred upon my head.<BR>
Yet, neither thus disheartened or dismayed,<BR>
The time prefixed I waited; when behold<BR>
The Baptist (of whose birth I oft had heard,<BR>
Not knew by sight) now come, who was to come<BR>
Before Messiah, and his way prepare!<BR>
I, as all others, to his baptism came,<BR>
Which I believed was from above; but he<BR>
Straight knew me, and with loudest voice proclaimed<BR>
Me him (for it was shewn him so from Heaven)--<BR>
Me him whose harbinger he was; and first<BR>
Refused on me his baptism to confer,<BR>
As much his greater, and was hardly won.<BR>
But, as I rose out of the laving stream,<BR>
Heaven opened her eternal doors, from whence<BR>
The Spirit descended on me like a Dove;<BR>
And last, the sum of all, my Father's voice,<BR>
Audibly heard from Heaven, pronounced me his,<BR>
Me his beloved Son, in whom alone<BR>
He was well pleased: by which I knew the time<BR>
Now full, that I no more should live obscure,<BR>
But openly begin, as best becomes<BR>
The authority which I derived from Heaven.<BR>
And now by some strong motion I am led<BR>
Into this wilderness; to what intent<BR>
I learn not yet.  Perhaps I need not know;<BR>
For what concerns my knowledge God reveals."<BR>
<BR>
  So spake our Morning Star, then in his rise,<BR>
And, looking round, on every side beheld<BR>
A pathless desert, dusk with horrid shades.<BR>
The way he came, not having marked return,<BR>
Was difficult, by human steps untrod;<BR>
And he still on was led, but with such thoughts<BR>
Accompanied of things past and to come<BR>
Lodged in his breast as well might recommend<BR>
Such solitude before choicest society.<BR>
<BR>
  Full forty days he passed--whether on hill<BR>
Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night<BR>
Under the covert of some ancient oak<BR>
Or cedar to defend him from the dew,<BR>
Or harboured in one cave, is not revealed;<BR>
Nor tasted human food, nor hunger felt,<BR>
Till those days ended; hungered then at last<BR>
Among wild beasts.  They at his sight grew mild,<BR>
Nor sleeping him nor waking harmed; his walk<BR>
The fiery serpent fled and noxious worm;<BR>
The lion and fierce tiger glared aloof.<BR>
But now an aged man in rural weeds,<BR>
Following, as seemed, the quest of some stray eye,<BR>
Or withered sticks to gather, which might serve<BR>
Against a winter's day, when winds blow keen,<BR>
To warm him wet returned from field at eve,<BR>
He saw approach; who first with curious eye<BR>
Perused him, then with words thus uttered spake:--<BR>
<BR>
  "Sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place,<BR>
So far from path or road of men, who pass<BR>
In troop or caravan? for single none<BR>
Durst ever, who returned, and dropt not here<BR>
His carcass, pined with hunger and with droughth.<BR>
I ask the rather, and the more admire,<BR>
For that to me thou seem'st the man whom late<BR>
Our new baptizing Prophet at the ford<BR>
Of Jordan honoured so, and called thee Son<BR>
Of God.  I saw and heard, for we sometimes<BR>
Who dwell this wild, constrained by want, come forth<BR>
To town or village nigh (nighest is far),<BR>
Where aught we hear, and curious are to hear,<BR>
What happens new; fame also finds us out."<BR>
<BR>
  To whom the Son of God:--"Who brought me hither<BR>
Will bring me hence; no other guide I seek."<BR>
<BR>
  "By miracle he may," replied the swain;<BR>
"What other way I see not; for we here<BR>
Live on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inured<BR>
More than the camel, and to drink go far--<BR>
Men to much misery and hardship born.<BR>
But, if thou be the Son of God, command<BR>
That out of these hard stones be made thee bread;<BR>
So shalt thou save thyself, and us relieve<BR>
With food, whereof we wretched seldom taste."<BR>
<BR>
  He ended, and the Son of God replied:--<BR>
"Think'st thou such force in bread?  Is it not written<BR>
(For I discern thee other than thou seem'st),<BR>
Man lives not by bread only, but each word<BR>
Proceeding from the mouth of God, who fed<BR>
Our fathers here with manna?  In the Mount<BR>
Moses was forty days, nor eat nor drank;<BR>
And forty days Eliah without food<BR>
Wandered this barren waste; the same I now.<BR>
Why dost thou, then, suggest to me distrust<BR>
Knowing who I am, as I know who thou art?"<BR>
<BR>
  Whom thus answered the Arch-Fiend, now undisguised:--<BR>
"'Tis true, I am that Spirit unfortunate<BR>
Who, leagued with millions more in rash revolt,<BR>
Kept not my happy station, but was driven<BR>
With them from bliss to the bottomless Deep--<BR>
Yet to that hideous place not so confined<BR>
By rigour unconniving but that oft,<BR>
Leaving my dolorous prison, I enjoy<BR>
Large liberty to round this globe of Earth,<BR>
Or range in the Air; nor from the Heaven of Heavens<BR>
Hath he excluded my resort sometimes.<BR>
I came, among the Sons of God, when he<BR>
Gave up into my hands Uzzean Job,<BR>
To prove him, and illustrate his high worth;<BR>
And, when to all his Angels he proposed<BR>
To draw the proud king Ahab into fraud,<BR>
That he might fall in Ramoth, they demurring,<BR>
I undertook that office, and the tongues<BR>
Of all his flattering prophets glibbed with lies<BR>
To his destruction, as I had in charge:<BR>
For what he bids I do.  Though I have lost<BR>
Much lustre of my native brightness, lost<BR>
To be beloved of God, I have not lost<BR>
To love, at least contemplate and admire,<BR>
What I see excellent in good, or fair,<BR>
Or virtuous; I should so have lost all sense.<BR>
What can be then less in me than desire<BR>
To see thee and approach thee, whom I know<BR>
Declared the Son of God, to hear attent<BR>
Thy wisdom, and behold thy godlike deeds?<BR>
Men generally think me much a foe<BR>
To all mankind.  Why should I? they to me<BR>
Never did wrong or violence.  By them<BR>
I lost not what I lost; rather by them<BR>
I gained what I have gained, and with them dwell<BR>
Copartner in these regions of the World,<BR>
If not disposer--lend them oft my aid,<BR>
Oft my advice by presages and signs,<BR>
And answers, oracles, portents, and dreams,<BR>
Whereby they may direct their future life.<BR>
Envy, they say, excites me, thus to gain<BR>
Companions of my misery and woe!<BR>
At first it may be; but, long since with woe<BR>
Nearer acquainted, now I feel by proof<BR>
That fellowship in pain divides not smart,<BR>
Nor lightens aught each man's peculiar load;<BR>
Small consolation, then, were Man adjoined.<BR>
This wounds me most (what can it less?) that Man,<BR>
Man fallen, shall be restored, I never more."<BR>
<BR>
  To whom our Saviour sternly thus replied:--<BR>
"Deservedly thou griev'st, composed of lies<BR>
From the beginning, and in lies wilt end,<BR>
Who boast'st release from Hell, and leave to come<BR>
Into the Heaven of Heavens.  Thou com'st, indeed,<BR>
As a poor miserable captive thrall<BR>
Comes to the place where he before had sat<BR>
Among the prime in splendour, now deposed,<BR>
Ejected, emptied, gazed, unpitied, shunned,<BR>
A spectacle of ruin, or of scorn,<BR>
To all the host of Heaven.  The happy place<BR>
Imparts to thee no happiness, no joy--<BR>
Rather inflames thy torment, representing<BR>
Lost bliss, to thee no more communicable;<BR>
So never more in Hell than when in Heaven.<BR>
But thou art serviceable to Heaven's King!<BR>
Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear<BR>
Extorts, or pleasure to do ill excites?<BR>
What but thy malice moved thee to misdeem<BR>
Of righteous Job, then cruelly to afflict him<BR>
With all inflictions? but his patience won.<BR>
The other service was thy chosen task,<BR>
To be a liar in four hundred mouths;<BR>
For lying is thy sustenance, thy food.<BR>
Yet thou pretend'st to truth! all oracles<BR>
By thee are given, and what confessed more true<BR>
Among the nations?  That hath been thy craft,<BR>
By mixing somewhat true to vent more lies.<BR>
But what have been thy answers? what but dark,<BR>
Ambiguous, and with double sense deluding,<BR>
Which they who asked have seldom understood,<BR>
And, not well understood, as good not known?<BR>
Who ever, by consulting at thy shrine,<BR>
Returned the wiser, or the more instruct<BR>
To fly or follow what concerned him most,<BR>
And run not sooner to his fatal snare?<BR>
For God hath justly given the nations up<BR>
To thy delusions; justly, since they fell<BR>
Idolatrous.  But, when his purpose is<BR>
Among them to declare his providence,<BR>
To thee not known, whence hast thou then thy truth,<BR>
But from him, or his Angels president<BR>
In every province, who, themselves disdaining<BR>
To approach thy temples, give thee in command<BR>
What, to the smallest tittle, thou shalt say<BR>
To thy adorers?  Thou, with trembling fear,<BR>
Or like a fawning parasite, obey'st;<BR>
Then to thyself ascrib'st the truth foretold.<BR>
But this thy glory shall be soon retrenched;<BR>
No more shalt thou by oracling abuse<BR>
The Gentiles; henceforth oracles are ceased,<BR>
And thou no more with pomp and sacrifice<BR>
Shalt be enquired at Delphos or elsewhere--<BR>
At least in vain, for they shall find thee mute.<BR>
God hath now sent his living Oracle<BR>
Into the world to teach his final will,<BR>
And sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to dwell<BR>
In pious hearts, an inward oracle<BR>
To all truth requisite for men to know."<BR>
<BR>
  So spake our Saviour; but the subtle Fiend,<BR>
Though inly stung with anger and disdain,<BR>
Dissembled, and this answer smooth returned:--<BR>
<BR>
  "Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke,<BR>
And urged me hard with doings which not will,<BR>
But misery, hath wrested from me.  Where<BR>
Easily canst thou find one miserable,<BR>
And not inforced oft-times to part from truth,<BR>
If it may stand him more in stead to lie,<BR>
Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure?<BR>
But thou art placed above me; thou art Lord;<BR>
From thee I can, and must, submiss, endure<BR>
Cheek or reproof, and glad to scape so quit.<BR>
Hard are the ways of truth, and rough to walk,<BR>
Smooth on the tongue discoursed, pleasing to the ear,<BR>
And tunable as sylvan pipe or song;<BR>
What wonder, then, if I delight to hear<BR>
Her dictates from thy mouth? most men admire<BR>
Virtue who follow not her lore.  Permit me<BR>
To hear thee when I come (since no man comes),<BR>
And talk at least, though I despair to attain.<BR>
Thy Father, who is holy, wise, and pure,<BR>
Suffers the hypocrite or atheous priest<BR>
To tread his sacred courts, and minister<BR>
About his altar, handling holy things,<BR>
Praying or vowing, and voutsafed his voice<BR>
To Balaam reprobate, a prophet yet<BR>
Inspired: disdain not such access to me."<BR>
<BR>
  To whom our Saviour, with unaltered brow:--<BR>
"Thy coming hither, though I know thy scope,<BR>
I bid not, or forbid.  Do as thou find'st<BR>
Permission from above; thou canst not more."<BR>
<BR>
  He added not; and Satan, bowling low<BR>
His gray dissimulation, disappeared,<BR>
Into thin air diffused: for now began<BR>
Night with her sullen wing to double-shade<BR>
The desert; fowls in their clay nests were couched;<BR>
And now wild beasts came forth the woods to roam.<BR>
