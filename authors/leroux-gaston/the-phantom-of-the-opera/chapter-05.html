<p>Christine Daae, owing to intrigues to which I will return later,
did not immediately continue her triumph at the Opera.  After
the famous gala night, she sang once at the Duchess de Zurich's;
but this was the last occasion on which she was heard in private. 
She refused, without plausible excuse, to appear at a charity
concert to which she had promised her assistance.  She acted throughout
as though she were no longer the mistress of her own destiny and
as though she feared a fresh triumph.</p>

<p>She knew that the Comte de Chagny, to please his brother, had
done his best on her behalf with M. Richard; and she wrote to
thank him and also to ask him to cease speaking in her favor. 
Her reason for this curious attitude was never known.  Some pretended
that it was due to overweening pride; others spoke of her heavenly
modesty.  But people on the stage are not so modest as all that;
and I think that I shall not be far from the truth if I ascribe
her action simply to fear.  Yes, I believe that Christine Daae
was frightened by what had happened to her. I have a letter of
Christine's (it forms part of the Persian's collection), relating
to this period, which suggests a feeling of absolute dismay:</p>

<p>"I don't know myself when I sing," writes the poor child.</p>

<p>She showed herself nowhere; and the Vicomte de Chagny tried in
vain to meet her.  He wrote to her, asking to call upon her, but
despaired of receiving a reply when, one morning, she sent him
the following note:</p>

<p><em>MONSIEUR</em>:</p>

<p>I have not forgotten the little boy who went into the sea to
rescue my scarf.  I feel that I must write to you to-day, when
I am going to Perros, in fulfilment of a sacred duty.  To-morrow
is the anniversary of the death of my poor father, whom you knew
and who was very fond of you.  He is buried there, with his violin,
in the graveyard of the little church, at the bottom of the slope
where we used to play as children, beside the road where, when
we were a little bigger, we said good-by for the last time.</p>

<p>The Vicomte de Chagny hurriedly consulted a railway guide, dressed
as quickly as he could, wrote a few lines for his valet to take
to his brother and jumped into a cab which brought him to the
Gare Montparnasse just in time to miss the morning train.  He
spent a dismal day in town and did not recover his spirits until
the evening, when he was seated in his compartment in the Brittany
express.  He read Christine's note over and over again, smelling
its perfume, recalling the sweet pictures of his childhood, and
spent the rest of that tedious night journey in feverish dreams
that began and ended with Christine Daae.  Day was breaking when
he alighted at Lannion.  He hurried to the diligence for Perros-Guirec. 
He was the only passenger.  He questioned the driver and learned
that, on the evening of the previous day, a young lady who looked
like a Parisian had gone to Perros and put up at the inn known
as the Setting Sun.</p>

<p>The nearer he drew to her, the more fondly he remembered the
story of the little Swedish singer.  Most of the details are still
unknown to the public.</p>

<p>There was once, in a little market-town not far from Upsala,
a peasant who lived there with his family, digging the earth during
the week and singing in the choir on Sundays.  This peasant had
a little daughter to whom he taught the musical alphabet before
she knew how to read. Daae's father was a great musician, perhaps
without knowing it.  Not a fiddler throughout the length and breadth
of Scandinavia played as he did.  His reputation was widespread
and he was always invited to set the couples dancing at weddings
and other festivals.  His wife died when Christine was entering
upon her sixth year.  Then the father, who cared only for his
daughter and his music, sold his patch of ground and went to Upsala
in search of fame and fortune.  He found nothing but poverty.</p>

<p>He returned to the country, wandering from fair to fair, strumming
his Scandinavian melodies, while his child, who never left his
side, listened to him in ecstasy or sang to his playing.  One
day, at Ljimby Fair, Professor Valerius heard them and took them
to Gothenburg.  He maintained that the father was the first violinist
in the world and that the daughter had the making of a great artist. 
Her education and instruction were provided for.  She made rapid
progress and charmed everybody with her prettiness, her grace
of manner and her genuine eagerness to please.</p>

<p>When Valerius and his wife went to settle in France, they took
Daae and Christine with them.  "Mamma" Valerius treated Christine
as her daughter.  As for Daae, he began to pine away with homesickness. 
He never went out of doors in Paris, but lived in a sort of dream
which he kept up with his violin.  For hours at a time, he remained
locked up in his bedroom with his daughter, fiddling and singing,
very, very softly. Sometimes Mamma Valerius would come and listen
behind the door, wipe away a tear and go down-stairs again on
tiptoe, sighing for her Scandinavian skies.</p>

<p>Daae seemed not to recover his strength until the summer, when
the whole family went to stay at Perros-Guirec, in a far-away
corner of Brittany, where the sea was of the same color as in
his own country. Often he would play his saddest tunes on the
beach and pretend that the sea stopped its roaring to listen to
them.  And then he induced Mamma Valerius to indulge a queer whim
of his.  At the time of the "pardons," or Breton pilgrimages,
the village festival and dances, he went off with his fiddle,
as in the old days, and was allowed to take his daughter with
him for a week.  They gave the smallest hamlets music to last
them for a year and slept at night in a barn, refusing a bed at
the inn, lying close together on the straw, as when they were
so poor in Sweden.  At the same time, they were very neatly dressed,
made no collection, refused the halfpence offered them; and the
people around could not understand the conduct of this rustic
fiddler, who tramped the roads with that pretty child who sang
like an angel from Heaven. They followed them from village to
village.</p>

<p>One day, a little boy, who was out with his governess, made her
take a longer walk than he intended, for he could not tear himself
from the little girl whose pure, sweet voice seemed to bind him
to her.  They came to the shore of an inlet which is still called
Trestraou, but which now, I believe, harbors a casino or something
of the sort.  At that time, there was nothing but sky and sea
and a stretch of golden beach.  Only, there was also a high wind,
which blew Christine's scarf out to sea.  Christine gave a cry
and put out her arms, but the scarf was already far on the waves. 
Then she heard a voice say:</p>

<p>"It's all right, I'll go and fetch your scarf out of the sea."</p>

<p>And she saw a little boy running fast, in spite of the outcries
and the indignant protests of a worthy lady in black.  The little
boy ran into the sea, dressed as he was, and brought her back
her scarf.  Boy and scarf were both soaked through.  The lady
in black made a great fuss, but Christine laughed merrily and
kissed the little boy, who was none other than the Vicomte Raoul
de Chagny, staying at Lannion with his aunt.</p>

<p>During the season, they saw each other and played together almost
every day.  At the aunt's request, seconded by Professor Valerius,
Daae consented to give the young viscount some violin lessons. 
In this way, Raoul learned to love the same airs that had charmed
Christine's childhood.  They also both had the same calm and dreamy
little cast of mind.  They delighted in stories, in old Breton
legends; and their favorite sport was to go and ask for them at
the cottage-doors, like beggars:</p>

<p>"Ma'am ..." or, "Kind gentleman ... have you a little story to
tell us, please?"</p>

<p>And it seldom happened that they did not have one "given" them;
for nearly every old Breton grandame has, at least once in her
life, seen the "korrigans" dance by moonlight on the heather.</p>

<p>But their great treat was, in the twilight, in the great silence
of the evening, after the sun had set in the sea, when Daae came
and sat down by them on the roadside and, in a low voice, as though
fearing lest he should frighten the ghosts whom he evoked, told
them the legends of the land of the North.  And, the moment he
stopped, the children would ask for more.</p>

<p>There was one story that began:</p>

<p>"A king sat in a little boat on one of those deep, still lakes
that open like a bright eye in the midst of the Norwegian mountains
..."</p>

<p>And another:</p>

<p>"Little Lotte thought of everything and nothing.  Her hair was
golden as the sun's rays and her soul as clear and blue as her
eyes.  She wheedled her mother, was kind to her doll, took great
care of her frock and her little red shoes and her fiddle, but
most of all loved, when she went to sleep, to hear the Angel of
Music."</p>

<p>While the old man told this story, Raoul looked at Christine's
blue eyes and golden hair; and Christine thought that Lotte was
very lucky to hear the Angel of Music when she went to sleep. 
The Angel of Music played a part in all Daddy Daae's tales; and
he maintained that every great musician, every great artist received
a visit from the Angel at least once in his life.  Sometimes the
Angel leans over their cradle, as happened to Lotte, and that
is how there are little prodigies who play the fiddle at six better
than men at fifty, which, you must admit, is very wonderful. 
Sometimes, the Angel comes much later, because the children are
naughty and won't learn their lessons or practise their scales. 
And, sometimes, he does not come at all, because the children
have a bad heart or a bad conscience.</p>

<p>No one ever sees the Angel; but he is heard by those who are
meant to hear him.  He often comes when they least expect him,
when they are sad and disheartened.  Then their ears suddenly
perceive celestial harmonies, a divine voice, which they remember
all their lives. Persons who are visited by the Angel quiver with
a thrill unknown to the rest of mankind.  And they can not touch
an instrument, or open their mouths to sing, without producing
sounds that put all other human sounds to shame.  Then people
who do not know that the Angel has visited those persons say that
they have genius.</p>

<p>Little Christine asked her father if he had heard the Angel of
Music. But Daddy Daae shook his head sadly; and then his eyes
lit up, as he said:</p>

<p>"You will hear him one day, my child!  When I am in Heaven, I
will send him to you!"</p>

<p>Daddy was beginning to cough at that time.</p>

<p>Three years later, Raoul and Christine met again at Perros. 
Professor Valerius was dead, but his widow remained in France
with Daddy Daae and his daughter, who continued to play the violin
and sing, wrapping in their dream of harmony their kind patroness,
who seemed henceforth to live on music alone.  The young man,
as he now was, had come to Perros on the chance of finding them
and went straight to the house in which they used to stay.  He
first saw the old man; and then Christine entered, carrying the
tea-tray. She flushed at the sight of Raoul, who went up to her
and kissed her.  She asked him a few questions, performed her
duties as hostess prettily, took up the tray again and left the
room.  Then she ran into the garden and took refuge on a bench,
a prey to feelings that stirred her young heart for the first
time.  Raoul followed her and they talked till the evening, very
shyly. They were quite changed, cautious as two diplomatists,
and told each other things that had nothing to do with their budding
sentiments. When they took leave of each other by the roadside,
Raoul, pressing a kiss on Christine's trembling hand, said:</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, I shall never forget you!"</p>

<p>And he went away regretting his words, for he knew that Christine
could not be the wife of the Vicomte de Chagny.</p>

<p>As for Christine, she tried not to think of him and devoted herself
wholly to her art.  She made wonderful progress and those who
heard her prophesied that she would be the greatest singer in
the world. Meanwhile, the father died; and, suddenly, she seemed
to have lost, with him, her voice, her soul and her genius.  She
retained just, but only just, enough of this to enter the <em>CONSERVATOIRE,
</em>where she did not distinguish herself at all, attending the
classes without enthusiasm and taking a prize only to please old
Mamma Valerius, with whom she continued to live.</p>

<p>The first time that Raoul saw Christine at the Opera, he was
charmed by the girl's beauty and by the sweet images of the past
which it evoked, but was rather surprised at the negative side
of her art.  He returned to listen to her.  He followed her in
the wings.  He waited for her behind a Jacob's ladder.  He tried
to attract her attention.  More than once, he walked after her
to the door of her box, but she did not see him.  She seemed,
for that matter, to see nobody.  She was all indifference.  Raoul
suffered, for she was very beautiful and he was shy and dared
not confess his love, even to himself.  And then came the lightning-flash
of the gala performance: the heavens torn asunder and an angel's
voice heard upon earth for the delight of mankind and the utter
capture of his heart.</p>

<p>And then ... and then there was that man's voice behind the door&mdash;"You
must love me!"&mdash;and no one in the room...</p>

<p>Why did she laugh when he reminded her of the incident of the
scarf? Why did she not recognize him?  And why had she written
to him? ...</p>

<p>Perros was reached at last.  Raoul walked into the smoky sitting-room
of the Setting Sun and at once saw Christine standing before him,
smiling and showing no astonishment.</p>

<p>"So you have come," she said.  "I felt that I should find you
here, when I came back from mass.  Some one told me so, at the
church."</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Raoul, taking her little hand in his.</p>

<p>"Why, my poor father, who is dead."</p>

<p>There was a silence; and then Raoul asked:</p>

<p>"Did your father tell you that I love you, Christine, and that
I can not live without you?"</p>

<p>Christine blushed to the eyes and turned away her head.  In a
trembling voice, she said:</p>

<p>"Me?  You are dreaming, my friend!"</p>

<p>And she burst out laughing, to put herself in countenance.</p>

<p>"Don't laugh, Christine; I am quite serious," Raoul answered.</p>

<p>And she replied gravely:  "I did not make you come to tell me
such things as that."</p>

<p>"You 'made me come,' Christine; you knew that your letter would
not leave me indignant and that I should hasten to Perros.  How
can you have thought that, if you did not think I loved you?"</p>

<p>"I thought you would remember our games here, as children, in
which my father so often joined.  I really don't know what I thought... 
Perhaps I was wrong to write to you ... This anniversary and your
sudden appearance in my room at the Opera, the other evening,
reminded me of the time long past and made me write to you as
the little girl that I then was..."</p>

<p>There was something in Christine's attitude that seemed to Raoul
not natural.  He did not feel any hostility in her; far from it:
the distressed affection shining in her eyes told him that.  But
why was this affection distressed?  That was what he wished to
know and what was irritating him.</p>

<p>"When you saw me in your dressing-room, was that the first time
you noticed me, Christine?"</p>

<p>She was incapable of lying.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I had seen you several times in your brother's
box. And also on the stage."</p>

<p>"I thought so!" said Raoul, compressing his lips.  "But then
why, when you saw me in your room, at your feet, reminding you
that I had rescued your scarf from the sea, why did you answer
as though you did not know me and also why did you laugh?"</p>

<p>The tone of these questions was so rough that Christine stared
at Raoul without replying.  The young man himself was aghast at
the sudden quarrel which he had dared to raise at the very moment
when he had resolved to speak words of gentleness, love and submission
to Christine.  A husband, a lover with all rights, would talk
no differently to a wife, a mistress who had offended him.  But
he had gone too far and saw no other way out of the ridiculous
position than to behave odiously.</p>

<p>"You don't answer!" he said angrily and unhappily.  "Well, I
will answer for you.  It was because there was some one in the
room who was in your way, Christine, some one that you did not
wish to know that you could be interested in any one else!"</p>

<p>"If any one was in my way, my friend," Christine broke in coldly,
"if any one was in my way, that evening, it was yourself, since
I told you to leave the room!"</p>

<p>"Yes, so that you might remain with the other!"</p>

<p>"What are you saying, monsieur?" asked the girl excitedly.  "And
to what other do you refer?"</p>

<p>"To the man to whom you said, 'I sing only for you! ... to-night
I gave you my soul and I am dead!'"</p>

<p>Christine seized Raoul's arm and clutched it with a strength
which no one would have suspected in so frail a creature.</p>

<p>"Then you were listening behind the door?"</p>

<p>"Yes, because I love you everything ... And I heard everything
..."</p>

<p>"You heard what?"</p>

<p>And the young girl, becoming strangely calm, released Raoul's
arm.</p>

<p>"He said to you, 'Christine, you must love me!'"</p>

<p>At these words, a deathly pallor spread over Christine's face,
dark rings formed round her eyes, she staggered and seemed on
the point of swooning.  Raoul darted forward, with arms outstretched,
but Christine had overcome her passing faintness and said, in
a low voice:</p>

<p>"Go on!  Go on!  Tell me all you heard!"</p>

<p>At an utter loss to understand, Raoul answered:  "I heard him
reply, when you said you had given him your soul, 'Your soul is
a beautiful thing, child, and I thank you.  No emperor ever received
so fair a gift.  The angels wept tonight.'"</p>

<p>Christine carried her hand to her heart, a prey to indescribable
emotion.  Her eyes stared before her like a madwoman's. Raoul
was terror-stricken. But suddenly Christine's eyes moistened and
two great tears trickled, like two pearls, down her ivory cheeks.</p>

<p>"Christine!"</p>

<p>"Raoul!"</p>

<p>The young man tried to take her in his arms, but she escaped
and fled in great disorder.</p>

<p>While Christine remained locked in her room, Raoul was at his
wit's end what to do.  He refused to breakfast.  He was terribly
concerned and bitterly grieved to see the hours, which he had
hoped to find so sweet, slip past without the presence of the
young Swedish girl.  Why did she not come to roam with him through
the country where they had so many memories in common?  He heard
that she had had a mass said, that morning, for the repose of
her father's soul and spent a long time praying in the little
church and on the fiddler's tomb.  Then, as she seemed to have
nothing more to do at Perros and, in fact, was doing nothing there,
why did she not go back to Paris at once?</p>

<p>Raoul walked away, dejectedly, to the graveyard in which the
church stood and was indeed alone among the tombs, reading the
inscriptions; but, when he turned behind the apse, he was suddenly
struck by the dazzling note of the flowers that straggled over
the white ground. They were marvelous red roses that had blossomed
in the morning, in the snow, giving a glimpse of life among the
dead, for death was all around him.  It also, like the flowers,
issued from the ground, which had flung back a number of its corpses. 
Skeletons and skulls by the hundred were heaped against the wall
of the church, held in position by a wire that left the whole
gruesome stack visible.  Dead men's bones, arranged in rows, like
bricks, to form the first course upon which the walls of the sacristy
had been built.  The door of the sacristy opened in the middle
of that bony structure, as is often seen in old Breton churches.</p>

<p>Raoul said a prayer for Daae and then, painfully impressed by
all those eternal smiles on the mouths of skulls, he climbed the
slope and sat down on the edge of the heath overlooking the sea. 
The wind fell with the evening.  Raoul was surrounded by icy darkness,
but he did not feel the cold.  It was here, he remembered, that
he used to come with little Christine to see the Korrigans dance
at the rising of the moon.  He had never seen any, though his
eyes were good, whereas Christine, who was a little shortsighted,
pretended that she had seen many.  He smiled at the thought and
then suddenly gave a start.  A voice behind him said:</p>

<p>"Do you think the Korrigans will come this evening?"</p>

<p>It was Christine.  He tried to speak.  She put her gloved hand
on his mouth.</p>

<p>"Listen, Raoul.  I have decided to tell you something serious,
very serious ... Do you remember the legend of the Angel of Music?"</p>

<p>"I do indeed," he said.  "I believe it was here that your father
first told it to us."</p>

<p>"And it was here that he said, 'When I am in Heaven, my child,
I will send him to you.'  Well, Raoul, my father is in Heaven,
and I have been visited by the Angel of Music."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it," replied the young man gravely, for it
seemed to him that his friend, in obedience to a pious thought,
was connecting the memory of her father with the brilliancy of
her last triumph.</p>

<p>Christine appeared astonished at the Vicomte de Chagny's coolness:</p>

<p>"How do you understand it?" she asked, bringing her pale face
so close to his that he might have thought that Christine was
going to give him a kiss; but she only wanted to read his eyes
in spite of the dark.</p>

<p>"I understand," he said, "that no human being can sing as you
sang the other evening without the intervention of some miracle. 
No professor on earth can teach you such accents as those.  You
have heard the Angel of Music, Christine."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said solemnly, "IN MY <em>DRESSING-ROOM. </em>That
is where he comes to give me my lessons daily."</p>

<p>"In your dressing-room?" he echoed stupidly.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is where I have heard him; and I have not been the
only one to hear him."</p>

<p>"Who else heard him, Christine?"</p>

<p>"You, my friend."</p>

<p>"I?  I heard the Angel of Music?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the other evening, it was he who was talking when you were
listening behind the door.  It was he who said, 'You must love
me.' But I then thought that I was the only one to hear his voice. 
Imagine my astonishment when you told me, this morning, that you
could hear him too."</p>

<p>Raoul burst out laughing.  The first rays of the moon came and
shrouded the two young people in their light.  Christine turned
on Raoul with a hostile air.  Her eyes, usually so gentle, flashed
fire.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?  <em>YOU </em>think you heard a man's
voice, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Well! ..." replied the young man, whose ideas began to grow
confused in the face of Christine's determined attitude.</p>

<p>"It's you, Raoul, who say that?  You, an old playfellow of my
own!  A friend of my father's! But you have changed since those
days.  What are you thinking of?  I am an honest girl, M. le Vicomte
de Chagny, and I don't lock myself up in my dressing-room with
men's voices.  If you had opened the door, you would have seen
that there was nobody in the room!"</p>

<p>"That's true!  I did open the door, when you were gone, and I
found no one in the room."</p>

<p>"So you see! ... Well?"</p>

<p>The viscount summoned up all his courage.</p>

<p>"Well, Christine, I think that somebody is making game of you."</p>

<p>She gave a cry and ran away.  He ran after her, but, in a tone
of fierce anger, she called out:  "Leave me!  Leave me!" And she
disappeared.</p>

<p>Raoul returned to the inn feeling very weary, very low-spirited
and very sad.  He was told that Christine had gone to her bedroom
saying that she would not be down to dinner.  Raoul dined alone,
in a very gloomy mood.  Then he went to his room and tried to
read, went to bed and tried to sleep.  There was no sound in the
next room.</p>

<p>The hours passed slowly.  It was about half-past eleven when
he distinctly heard some one moving, with a light, stealthy step,
in the room next to his.  Then Christine had not gone to bed! 
Without troubling for a reason, Raoul dressed, taking care not
to make a sound, and waited.  Waited for what?  How could he tell? 
But his heart thumped in his chest when he heard Christine's door
turn slowly on its hinges.  Where could she be going, at this
hour, when every one was fast asleep at Perros?  Softly opening
the door, he saw Christine's white form, in the moonlight, slipping
along the passage.  She went down the stairs and he leaned over
the baluster above her.  Suddenly he heard two voices in rapid
conversation.  He caught one sentence: "Don't lose the key."</p>

<p>It was the landlady's voice.  The door facing the sea was opened
and locked again.  Then all was still.</p>

<p>Raoul ran back to his room and threw back the window.  Christine's
white form stood on the deserted quay.</p>

<p>The first floor of the Setting Sun was at no great height and
a tree growing against the wall held out its branches to Raoul's
impatient arms and enabled him to climb down unknown to the landlady. 
Her amazement, therefore, was all the greater when, the next morning,
the young man was brought back to her half frozen, more dead than
alive, and when she learned that he had been found stretched at
full length on the steps of the high altar of the little church. 
She ran at once to tell Christine, who hurried down and, with
the help of the landlady, did her best to revive him.  He soon
opened his eyes and was not long in recovering when he saw his
friend's charming face leaning over him.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, when the tragedy at the Opera compelled the
intervention of the public prosecutor, M. Mifroid, the commissary
of police, examined the Vicomte de Chagny touching the events
of the night at Perros.  I quote the questions and answers as
given in the official report pp. 150 et seq.:</p>

<p>Q. "Did Mlle. Daae not see you come down from your room by the
curious road which you selected?"</p>

<p>R. "No, monsieur, no, although, when walking behind her, I took
no pains to deaden the sound of my footsteps.  In fact, I was
anxious that she should turn round and see me.  I realized that
I had no excuse for following her and that this way of spying
on her was unworthy of me. But she seemed not to hear me and acted
exactly as though I were not there.  She quietly left the quay
and then suddenly walked quickly up the road.  The church-clock
had struck a quarter to twelve and I thought that this must have
made her hurry, for she began almost to run and continued hastening
until she came to the church."</p>

<p>Q. "Was the gate open?"</p>

<p>R. "Yes, monsieur, and this surprised me, but did not seem to
surprise Mlle. Daae."</p>

<p>Q. "Was there no one in the churchyard?"</p>

<p>R. "I did not see any one; and, if there had been, I must have
seen him.  The moon was shining on the snow and made the night
quite light."</p>

<p>Q. "Was it possible for any one to hide behind the tombstones?"</p>

<p>R. "No, monsieur.  They were quite small, poor tombstones, partly
hidden under the snow, with their crosses just above the level
of the ground.  The only shadows were those of the crosses and
ourselves.  The church stood out quite brightly.  I never saw
so clear a night.  It was very fine and very cold and one could
see everything."</p>

<p>Q. "Are you at all superstitious?"</p>

<p>R. "No, monsieur, I am a practising Catholic,"</p>

<p>Q. "In what condition of mind were you?"</p>

<p>R. "Very healthy and peaceful, I assure you.  Mlle. Daae's curious
action in going out at that hour had worried me at first; but,
as soon as I saw her go to the churchyard, I thought that she
meant to fulfil some pious duty on her father's grave and I considered
this so natural that I recovered all my calmness.  I was only
surprised that she had not heard me walking behind her, for my
footsteps were quite audible on the hard snow.  But she must have
been taken up with her intentions and I resolved not to disturb
her.  She knelt down by her father's grave, made the sign of the
cross and began to pray.  At that moment, it struck midnight. 
At the last stroke, I saw Mlle. Daae life{sic} her eyes to the
sky and stretch out her arms as though in ecstasy.  I was wondering
what the reason could be, when I myself raised my head and everything
within me seemed drawn toward the invisible, <em>WHICH WAS PLAYING
THE MOST PERFECT MUSIC!  </em>Christine and I knew that music;
we had heard it as children.  But it had never been executed with
such divine art, even by M. Daae.  I remembered all that Christine
had told me of the Angel of Music.  The air was The Resurrection
of Lazarus, which old M. Daae used to play to us in his hours
of melancholy and of faith.  If Christine's Angel had existed,
he could not have played better, that night, on the late musician's
violin.  When the music stopped, I seemed to hear a noise from
the skulls in the heap of bones; it was as though they were chuckling
and I could not help shuddering."</p>

<p>Q. "Did it not occur to you that the musician might be hiding
behind that very heap of bones?"</p>

<p>R. "It was the one thought that did occur to me, monsieur, so
much so that I omitted to follow Mlle. Daae, when she stood up
and walked slowly to the gate.  She was so much absorbed just
then that I am not surprised that she did not see me."</p>

<p>Q. "Then what happened that you were found in the morning lying
half-dead on the steps of the high altar?"</p>

<p>R. "First a skull rolled to my feet ... then another ... then
another ... It was as if I were the mark of that ghastly game
of bowls.  And I had an idea that false step must have destroyed
the balance of the structure behind which our musician was concealed. 
This surmise seemed to be confirmed when I saw a shadow suddenly
glide along the sacristy wall.  I ran up.  The shadow had already
pushed open the door and entered the church.  But I was quicker
than the shadow and caught hold of a corner of its cloak.  At
that moment, we were just in front of the high altar; and the
moonbeams fell straight upon us through the stained-glass windows
of the apse.  As I did not let go of the cloak, the shadow turned
round; and I saw a terrible death's head, which darted a look
at me from a pair of scorching eyes.  I felt as if I were face
to face with Satan; and, in the presence of this unearthly apparition,
my heart gave way, my courage failed me ... and I remember nothing
more until I recovered consciousness at the Setting Sun."</p>
