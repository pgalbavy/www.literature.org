<P>
RETURNING to his office, Mr. Troy discovered, among the
correspondence that was waiting for him, a letter from the very
person whose welfare was still the uppermost subject in his mind.
Isabel Miller wrote in these terms:
<P>
"Dear Sir--My aunt, Miss Pink, is very desirous of consulting you
professionally at the earliest opportunity. Although South Morden
is within little more than half an hour's railway ride from
London, Miss Pink does not presume to ask you to visit her, being
well aware of the value of your time. Will you, therefore, be so
kind as to let me know when it will be convenient to you to
receive my aunt at your office in London? Believe me, dear sir,
respectfully yours, ISABEL MILLER. P.S.--I am further instructed
to say that the regrettable event at Lady Lydiard's house is the
proposed subject of the consultation. The Lawn, South Morden.
Thursday."
<P>
Mr. Troy smiled as he read the letter. "Too formal for a young
girl!" he said to himself. "Every word of it has been dictated by
Miss Pink." He was not long in deciding what course he should
take. There was a pressing necessity for cautioning Isabel, and
here was his opportunity. He sent for his head clerk, and looked
at his list of engagements for the day. There was nothing set
down in the book which the clerk was not quite as well able to do
as the master. Mr. Troy consulted his railway-guide, ordered his
cab, and caught the next train to South Mord en.
<P>
South Morden was then (and remains to this day) one of those
primitive agricultural villages, passed over by the march of
modern progress, which are still to be found in the near
neighborhood of London. Only the slow trains stopped at the
station and there was so little to do that the station-master and
his porter grew flowers on the embankment, and trained creepers
over the waiting-room window. Turning your back on the railway,
and walking along the one street of South Morden, you found
yourself in the old England of two centuries since. Gabled
cottages, with fast-closed windows; pigs and poultry in quiet
possession of the road; the venerable church surrounded by its
shady burial-ground; the grocer's shop which sold everything, and
the butcher's shop which sold nothing; the scarce inhabitants who
liked a good look at a stranger, and the unwashed children who
were pictures of dirty health; the clash of the iron-chained
bucket in the public well, and the thump of the falling nine-pins
in the skittle-ground behind the public-house; the horse-pond on
the one bit of open ground, and the old elm-tree with the wooden
seat round it on the other--these were some of the objects that
you saw, and some of the noises that you heard in South Morden,
as you passed from one end of the village to the other.
<P>
About half a mile beyond the last of the old cottages, modern
England met you again under the form of a row of little villas,
set up by an adventurous London builder who had bought the land a
bargain. Each villa stood in its own little garden, and looked
across a stony road at the meadow lands and softly-rising wooded
hills beyond. Each villa faced you in the sunshine with the
horrid glare of new red brick, and forced its nonsensical name on
your attention, traced in bright paint on the posts of its
entrance gate. Consulting the posts as he advanced, Mr. Troy
arrived in due course of time at the villa called The Lawn, which
derived its name apparently from a circular patch of grass in
front of the house. The gate resisting his efforts to open it, he
rang the bell.
<P>
Admitted by a trim, clean, shy little maid-servant, Mr. Troy
looked about him in amazement. Turn which way he might, he found
himself silently confronted by posted and painted instructions to
visitors, which forbade him to do this, and commanded him to do
that, at every step of his progress from the gate to the house.
On the side of the lawn a label informed him that he was not to
walk on the grass. On the other side a painted hand pointed along
a boundary-wall to an inscription which warned him to go that way
if he had business in the kitchen. On the gravel walk at the foot
of the housesteps words, neatly traced in little white shells,
reminded him not to "forget the scraper". On the doorstep he was
informed, in letters of lead, that he was "Welcome!" On the mat
in the passage bristly black words burst on his attention,
commanding him to "wipe his shoes." Even the hat-stand in the
hall was not allowed to speak for itself; it had "Hats and
Cloaks" inscribed on it, and it issued its directions
imperatively in the matter of your wet umbrella--"Put it here!"
<P>
Giving the trim little servant his card, Mr. Troy was introduced
to a reception-room on the lower floor. Before he had time to
look round him the door was opened again from without, and Isabel
stole into the room on tiptoe. She looked worn and anxious. When
she shook hands with the old lawyer the charming smile that he
remembered so well was gone.
<P>
"Don't say you have seen me," she whispered. "I am not to come
into the room till my aunt sends for me. Tell me two things
before I run away again. How is Lady Lydiard? And have you
discovered the thief?"
<P>
"Lady Lydiard was well when I last saw her; and we have not yet
succeeded in discovering the thief." Having answered the
questions in those terms, Mr. Troy decided on cautioning Isabel
on the subject of the steward while he had the chance. "One
question on my side," he said, holding her back from the door by
the arm. "Do you expect Moody to visit you here?"
<P>
"I am _sure_ he will visit me," Isabel answered warmly. "He has
promised to come here at my request. I never knew what a kind
heart Robert Moody had till this misfortune fell on me. My aunt,
who is not easily taken with strangers, respects and admires him.
I can't tell you how good he was to me on the journey here--and
how kindly, how nobly, he spoke to me when we parted." She
paused, and turned her head away. The tears were rising in her
eyes. "In my situation," she said faintly, "kindness is very
keenly felt. Don't notice me, Mr. Troy."
<P>
The lawyer waited a moment to let her recover herself.
<P>
"I agree entirely, my dear, in your opinion of Moody," he said.
"At the same time, I think it right to warn you that his zeal in
your service may possibly outrun his discretion. He may feel too
confidently about penetrating the mystery of the missing money;
and, unless you are on your guard, he may raise false hopes in
you when you next see him. Listen to any advice that he may give
you, by all means. But, before you decide on being guided by his
opinion, consult my older experience, and hear what I have to say
on the subject. Don't suppose that I am attempting to make you
distrust this good friend," he added, noticing the look of uneasy
surprise which Isabel fixed on him. "No such idea is in my mind.
I only warn you that Moody's eagerness to be of service to you
may mislead him. You understand me."
<P>
"Yes, sir," replied Isabel coldly; "I understand you. Please let
me go now. My aunt will be down directly; and she must not find
me here." She curtseyed with distant respect, and left the room.
<P>
"So much for trying to put two ideas together into a girl's
mind!" thought Mr. Troy, when he was alone again. "The little
fool evidently thinks I am jealous of Moody's place in her
estimation. Well! I have done my duty--and I can do no more."
<P>
He looked round the room. Not a chair was out of its place, not a
speck of dust was to be seen. The brightly-perfect polish of the
table made your eyes ache; the ornaments on it looked as if they
had never been touched by mortal hand; the piano was an object
for distant admiration, not an instrument to be played on; the
carpet made Mr. Troy look nervously at the soles of his shoes;
and the sofa (protected by layers of white crochet-work) said as
plainly as if in words, "Sit on me if you dare!" Mr. Troy
retreated to a bookcase at the further end of the room. The books
fitted the shelves to such absolute perfection that he had some
difficulty in taking one of them out. When he had succeeded, he
found himself in possession of a volume of the History of
England. On the fly-leaf he encountered another written
warning:--"This book belongs to Miss Pink's Academy for Young
Ladies, and is not to be removed from the library." The date,
which was added, referred to a period of ten years since. Miss
Pink now stood revealed as a retired schoolmistress, and Mr. Troy
began to understand some of the characteristic peculiarities of
that lady's establishment which had puzzled him up to the present
time.
<P>
He had just succeeded in putting the book back again when the
door opened once more, and Isabel's aunt entered the room.
<P>
If Miss Pink could, by any possible conjuncture of circumstances,
have disappeared mysteriously from her house and her friends, the
police would have found the greatest difficulty in composing the
necessary description of the missing lady. The acutest observer
could have discovered nothing that was noticeable or
characteristic in her personal appearance. The pen of the present
writer portrays her in despair by a series of negatives. She was
not young, she was not old; she was neither tall nor short, nor
stout nor thin; nobody could call her features attractive, and
nobody could call them ugly; there was nothing in her voice, her
expression, her manner, or her dress that differed in any
appreciable degree from the voice, expression, manner, and dress
of five hundred thousand other single ladies of her age and
position in the world. If you had asked her to describe herself,
she would have answered, "I am  a gentlew oman"; and if you had
further inquired which of her numerous accomplishments took
highest rank in her own esteem, she would have replied, "My
powers of conversation." For the rest, she was Miss Pink, of
South Morden; and, when that has been said, all has been said.
<P>
"Pray be seated, sir. We have had a beautiful day, after the
long-continued wet weather. I am told that the season is very
unfavorable for wall-fruit. May I offer you some refreshment
after your journey?" In these terms and in the smoothest of
voices, Miss Pink opened the interview.
<P>
Mr. Troy made a polite reply, and added a few strictly
conventional remarks on the beauty of the neighborhood. Not even
a lawyer could sit in Miss Pink's presence, and hear Miss Pink's
conversation, without feeling himself called upon (in the nursery
phrase) to "be on his best behavior".
<P>
"It is extremely kind of you, Mr. Troy, to favor me with this
visit," Miss Pink resumed. "I am well aware that the time of
professional gentlemen is of especial value to them; and I will
therefore ask you to excuse me if I proceed abruptly to the
subject on which I desire to consult your experience."
<P>
Here the lady modestly smoothed out her dress over her knees, and
the lawyer made a bow. Miss Pink's highly-trained conversation
had perhaps one fault--it was not, strictly speaking,
conversation at all. In its effect on her hearers it rather
resembled the contents of a fluently conventional letter, read
aloud.
<P>
"The circumstances under which my niece Isabel has left Lady
Lydiard's house," Miss Pink proceeded, "are so indescribably
painful--I will go further, I will say so deeply
humiliating--that I have forbidden her to refer to them again in
my presence, or to mention them in the future to any living
creature besides myself. You are acquainted with those
circumstances, Mr. Troy; and you will understand my indignation
when I first learnt that my sister's child had been suspected of
theft. I have not the honor of being acquainted with Lady
Lydiard. She is not a Countess, I believe? Just so! Her husband
was only a Baron. I am not acquainted with Lady Lydiard; and I
will not trust myself to say what I think of her conduct to my
niece."
<P>
"Pardon me, madam," Mr. Troy interposed. "Before you say any more
about Lady Lydiard, I really must beg leave to observe--"
<P>
"Pardon _me_," Miss Pink rejoined. "I never form a hasty
judgment. Lady Lydiard's conduct is beyond the reach of any
defense, no matter how ingenious it may be. You may not be aware,
sir, that in receiving my niece under her roof her Ladyship was
receiving a gentlewoman by birth as well as by education. My late
lamented sister was the daughter of a clergyman of the Church of
England. I need hardly remind you that, as such, she was a born
lady. Under favoring circumstances, Isabel's maternal grandfather
might have been Archbishop of Canterbury, and have taken
precedence of the whole House of Peers, the Princes of the blood
Royal alone excepted. I am not prepared to say that my niece is
equally well connected on her father's side. My sister
surprised--I will not add shocked--us when she married a chemist.
At the same time, a chemist is not a tradesman. He is a gentleman
at one end of the profession of Medicine, and a titled physician
is a gentleman at the other end. That is all. In inviting Isabel
to reside with her, Lady Lydiard, I repeat, was bound to remember
that she was associating herself with a young gentlewoman. She
has _not_ remembered this, which is one insult; and she has
suspected my niece of theft, which is another."
<P>
Miss Pink paused to take breath. Mr. Troy made a second attempt
to get a hearing.
<P>
"Will you kindly permit me, madam, to say a few words?"
<P>
"No!" said Miss Pink, asserting the most immovable obstinacy
under the blandest politeness of manner. "Your time, Mr. Troy, is
really too valuable! Not even your trained intellect can excuse
conduct which is manifestly _in_excusable on the face of it. Now
you know my opinion of Lady Lydiard, you will not be surprised to
hear that I decline to trust her Ladyship. She may, or she may
not, cause the necessary inquiries to be made for the vindication
of my niece's character. In a matter so serious as this--I may
say, in a duty which I owe to the memories of my sister and my
parents--I will not leave the responsibility to Lady Lydiard. I
will take it on myself. Let me add that I am able to pay the
necessary expenses. The earlier years of my life, Mr. Troy, have
been passed in the tuition of young ladies. I have been happy in
meriting the confidence of parents; and I have been strict in
observing the golden rules of economy. On my retirement, I have
been able to invest a modest, a very modest, little fortune in
the Funds. A portion of it is at the service of my niece for the
recovery of her good name; and I desire to place the necessary
investigation confidentially in your hands. You are acquainted
with the case, and the case naturally goes to you. I could not
prevail on myself--I really could not prevail on myself--to
mention it to a stranger. That is the business on which I wished
to consult you. Please say nothing more about Lady Lydiard--the
subject is inexpressibly disagreeable to me. I will only trespass
on your kindness to tell me if I have succeeded in making myself
understood."
<P>
Miss Pink leaned back in her chair, at the exact angle permitted
by the laws of propriety; rested her left elbow on the palm of
her right hand, and lightly supported her cheek with her
forefinger and thumb. In this position she waited Mr. Troy's
answer--the living picture of human obstinacy in its most
respectable form.
<P>
If Mr. Troy had not been a lawyer--in other words, if he had not
been professionally capable of persisting in his own course, in
the face of every conceivable difficulty and discouragement--Miss
Pink might have remained in undisturbed possession of her own
opinions. As it was, Mr. Troy had got his hearing at last; and no
matter how obstinately she might close her eyes to it, Miss Pink
was now destined to have the other side of the case presented to
her view.
<P>
"I am sincerely obliged to you, madam, for the expression of your
confidence in me," Mr. Troy began; "at the same time, I must beg
you to excuse me if I decline to accept your proposal."
<P>
Miss Pink had not expected to receive such an answer as this. The
lawyer's brief refusal surprised and annoyed her.
<P>
"Why do you decline to assist me?" she asked.
<P>
"Because," answered Mr. Troy, "my services are already engaged,
in Miss Isabel's interest, by a client whom I have served for
more than twenty years. My client is--"
<P>
Miss Pink anticipated the coming disclosure. "You need not
trouble yourself, sir, to mention your client's name," she said.
<P>
"My client," persisted Mr. Troy, "loves Miss Isabel dearly."
<P>
"That is a matter of opinion," Miss Pink interposed.
<P>
"And believes in Miss Isabel's innocence," proceeded the
irrepressible lawyer, "as firmly as you believe in it yourself."
<P>
Miss Pink (being human) had a temper; and Mr. Troy had found his
way to it.
<P>
"If Lady Lydiard believes in my niece's innocence," said Miss
Pink, suddenly sitting bolt upright in her chair, "why has my
niece been compelled, in justice to herself, to leave Lady
Lydiard's house?"
<P>
"You will admit, madam," Mr. Troy answered cautiously, "that we
are all of us liable, in this wicked world, to be the victims of
appearances. Your niece is a victim--an innocent victim. She
wisely withdraws from Lady Lydiard's house until appearances are
proved to be false and her position is cleared up."
<P>
Miss Pink had her reply ready. "That is simply acknowledging, in
other words, that my niece is suspected. I am only a woman, Mr.
Troy--but it is not quite so easy to mislead me as you seem to
suppose."
<P>
Mr. Troy's temper was admirably trained. But it began to
acknowledge that Miss Pink's powers of irritation could sting to
some purpose.
<P>
"No intention of misleading you, madam, has ever crossed my
mind," he rejoined warmly. "As for your niece, I can tell you
this. In all my experience of Lady Lydiard, I never saw her so
distressed as she was when Miss Isabel left the house!"
<P>
"Indeed!" said Miss Pink, with an incredulous smile. "In my rank
of life, when we feel distressed about a person, we do our best
to comfort that person by a kind letter or an early visit. But
then I am not a lady of title."
<P>
"Lady Lydiard engaged herself to call on Miss Isabel in my
hearing," said Mr. Troy. "Lady Lydiard is the most generous woman
living!"
<P>
"Lady Lydiard is here!" cried a joyful voice on the other side of
the door.
<P>
At the same moment, Isabel burst into the room in a state of
excitement which actually ignored the formidable presence of Miss
Pink. "I beg your pardon, aunt! I was upstairs at the window, and
I saw the carriage stop at the gate. And Tommie has come, too!
The darling saw me at the window!" cried the poor girl, her eyes
sparkling with delight as a perfect explosion of barking made
itself heard over the tramp of horses' feet and the crash of
carriage wheels outside.
<P>
Miss Pink rose slowly, with a dignity that looked capable of
adequately receiving--not one noble lady only, but the whole
peerage of England.
<P>
"Control yourself, dear Isabel," she said. "No well-bred young
lady permits herself to become unduly excited. Stand by my
side--a little behind me."
<P>
Isabel obeyed. Mr. Troy kept his place, and privately enjoyed his
triumph over Miss Pink. If Lady Lydiard had been actually in
league with him, she could not have chosen a more opportune time
for her visit. A momentary interval passed. The carriage drew up
at the door; the horses trampled on the gravel; the bell rung
madly; the uproar of Tommie, released from the carriage and
clamoring to be let in, redoubled its fury. Never before had such
an unruly burst of noises invaded the tranquility of Miss Pink's
villa!
