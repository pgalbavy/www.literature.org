The nursery was full of Persian cats and musk-rats that had been
brought there by the wishing carpet.  The cats were mewing and the
musk-rats were squeaking so that you could hardly hear yourself
speak.  In the kitchen were the four children, one candle, a
concealed Phoenix, and a very visible policeman.</p>

<p>'Now then, look here,' said the Policeman, very loudly, and he
pointed his lantern at each child in turn, 'what's the meaning of
this here yelling and caterwauling.  I tell you you've got a cat
here, and some one's a ill-treating of it.  What do you mean by it,
eh?'</p>

<p>It was five to one, counting the Phoenix; but the policeman, who
was one, was of unusually fine size, and the five, including the
Phoenix, were small.  The mews and the squeaks grew softer, and in
the comparative silence, Cyril said - </p>

<p>'It's true.  There are a few cats here.  But we've not hurt them. 
It's quite the opposite.  We've just fed them.'</p>

<p>'It don't sound like it,' said the policeman grimly.</p>

<p>'I daresay they're not REAL cats,' said Jane madly, perhaps they're
only dream-cats.'</p>

<p>'I'll dream-cat you, my lady,' was the brief response of the force.</p>

<p>'If you understood anything except people who do murders and
stealings and naughty things like that, I'd tell you all about it,'
said Robert; 'but I'm certain you don't.  You're not meant to shove
your oar into people's private cat-keepings.  You're only supposed
to interfere when people shout &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;stop thief&quot; in the
street.  So there!'</p>

<p>The policeman assured them that he should see about that; and at
this point the Phoenix, who had been making itself small on the
pot-shelf under the dresser, among the saucepan lids and the fish-
kettle, walked on tip-toed claws in a noiseless and modest manner,
and left the room unnoticed by any one.</p>

<p>'Oh, don't be so horrid,' Anthea was saying, gently and earnestly. 
'We LOVE cats - dear pussy-soft things.  We wouldn't hurt them for
worlds.  Would we, Pussy?'</p>

<p>And Jane answered that of course they wouldn't.  And still the
policeman seemed unmoved by their eloquence.</p>

<p>'Now, look here,' he said, 'I'm a-going to see what's in that room
beyond there, and - '</p>

<p>His voice was drowned in a wild burst of mewing and squeaking.  And
as soon as it died down all four children began to explain at once;
and though the squeaking and mewing were not at their very loudest,
yet there was quite enough of both to make it very hard for the
policeman to understand a single word of any of the four wholly
different explanations now poured out to him.</p>

<p>'Stow it,' he said at last.  'I'm a-goin' into the next room in the
execution of my duty.  I'm a-goin' to use my eyes - my ears have
gone off their chumps, what with you and them cats.'</p>

<p>And he pushed Robert aside, and strode through the door.</p>

<p>'Don't say I didn't warn you,' said Robert.</p>

<p>'It's tigers REALLY,' said Jane.  'Father said so.  I wouldn't go
in, if I were you.'</p>

<p>But the policeman was quite stony; nothing any one said seemed to
make any difference to him.  Some policemen are like this, I
believe.  He strode down the passage, and in another moment he
would have been in the room with all the cats and all the rats
(musk), but at that very instant a thin, sharp voice screamed from
the street outside - </p>

<p>'Murder - murder!  Stop thief!'</p>

<p>The policeman stopped, with one regulation boot heavily poised in
the air.</p>

<p>'Eh?' he said.</p>

<p>And again the shrieks sounded shrilly and piercingly from the dark
street outside.</p>

<p>'Come on,' said Robert.  'Come and look after cats while somebody's
being killed outside.'  For Robert had an inside feeling that told
him quite plainly WHO it was that was screaming.</p>

<p>'You young rip,' said the policeman, 'I'll settle up with you
bimeby.'</p>

<p>And he rushed out, and the children heard his boots going weightily
along the pavement, and the screams also going along, rather ahead
of the policeman; and both the murder-screams and the policeman's
boots faded away in the remote distance.</p>

<p>Then Robert smacked his knickerbocker loudly with his palm, and
said - </p>

<p>'Good old Phoenix!  I should know its golden voice anywhere.'</p>

<p>And then every one understood how cleverly the Phoenix had caught
at what Robert had said about the real work of a policeman being to
look after murderers and thieves, and not after cats, and all
hearts were filled with admiring affection.</p>

<p>'But he'll come back,' said Anthea, mournfully, 'as soon as it
finds the murderer is only a bright vision of a dream, and there
isn't one at all really.'</p>

<p>'No he won't,' said the soft voice of the clever Phoenix, as it
flew in.  'HE DOES NOT KNOW WHERE YOUR HOUSE IS.  I heard him own
as much to a fellow mercenary.  Oh! what a night we are having!
Lock the door, and let us rid ourselves of this intolerable smell
of the perfume peculiar to the musk-rat and to the house of the
trimmers of beards.  If you'll excuse me, I will go to bed.  I am
worn out.'</p>

<p>It was Cyril who wrote the paper that told the carpet to take away
the rats and bring milk, because there seemed to be no doubt in any
breast that, however Persian cats may be, they must like milk.</p>

<p>'Let's hope it won't be musk-milk,' said Anthea, in gloom, as she
pinned the paper face-downwards on the carpet.  'Is there such a
thing as a musk-cow?' she added anxiously, as the carpet shrivelled
and vanished.  'I do hope not.  Perhaps really it WOULD have been
wiser to let the carpet take the cats away.  It's getting quite
late, and we can't keep them all night.'</p>

<p>'Oh, can't we?' was the bitter rejoinder of Robert, who had been
fastening the side door.  'You might have consulted me,' he went
on.  'I'm not such an idiot as some people.'</p>

<p>'Why, whatever - '</p>

<p>'Don't you see?  We've jolly well GOT to keep the cats all
night - oh, get down, you furry beasts! - because we've had three
wishes out of the old carpet now, and we can't get any more till
to-morrow.'</p>

<p>The liveliness of Persian mews alone prevented the occurrence of a
dismal silence.</p>

<p>Anthea spoke first.</p>

<p>'Never mind,' she said.  'Do you know, I really do think they're
quieting down a bit.  Perhaps they heard us say milk.'</p>

<p>'They can't understand English,' said Jane.  'You forget they're
Persian cats, Panther.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Anthea, rather sharply, for she was tired and anxious,
'who told you &quot;milk&quot; wasn't Persian for milk.  Lots of English
words are just the same in French - at least I know &quot;miaw&quot; is, and
&quot;croquet&quot;, and &quot;fiance&quot;.  Oh, pussies, do be quiet!  Let's stroke
them as hard as we can with both hands, and perhaps they'll stop.'</p>

<p>So every one stroked grey fur till their hands were tired, and as
soon as a cat had been stroked enough to make it stop mewing it was
pushed gently away, and another mewing mouser was approached by the
hands of the strokers.  And the noise was really more than half
purr when the carpet suddenly appeared in its proper place, and on
it, instead of rows of milk-cans, or even of milk-jugs, there was
a COW.  Not a Persian cow, either, nor, most fortunately, a
musk-cow, if there is such a thing, but a smooth, sleek,
dun-coloured Jersey cow, who blinked large soft eyes at the
gas-light and mooed in an amiable if rather inquiring manner.</p>

<p>Anthea had always been afraid of cows; but now she tried to be
brave.</p>

<p>'Anyway, it can't run after me,' she said to herself 'There isn't
room for it even to begin to run.'</p>

<p>The cow was perfectly placid.  She behaved like a strayed duchess
till some one brought a saucer for the milk, and some one else
tried to milk the cow into it.  Milking is very difficult.  You may
think it is easy, but it is not.  All the children were by this
time strung up to a pitch of heroism that would have been
impossible to them in their ordinary condition.  Robert and Cyril
held the cow by the horns; and Jane, when she was quite sure that
their end of the cow was quite secure, consented to stand by, ready
to hold the cow by the tail should occasion arise.  Anthea, holding
the saucer, now advanced towards the cow.  She remembered to have
heard that cows, when milked by strangers, are susceptible to the
soothing influence of the human voice.  So, clutching her saucer
very tight, she sought for words to whose soothing influence the
cow might be susceptible.  And her memory, troubled by the events
of the night, which seemed to go on and on for ever and ever,
refused to help her with any form of words suitable to address a
Jersey cow in.</p>

<p>'Poor pussy, then.  Lie down, then, good dog, lie down!' was all
that she could think of to say, and she said it.</p>

<p>And nobody laughed.  The situation, full of grey mewing cats, was
too serious for that.  Then Anthea, with a beating heart, tried to
milk the cow.  Next moment the cow had knocked the saucer out of
her hand and trampled on it with one foot, while with the other
three she had walked on a foot each of Robert, Cyril, and Jane.</p>

<p>Jane burst into tears.  'Oh, how much too horrid everything is!'
she cried.  'Come away.  Let's go to bed and leave the horrid cats
with the hateful cow.  Perhaps somebody will eat somebody else. 
And serve them right.'</p>

<p>They did not go to bed, but they had a shivering council in the
drawing-room, which smelt of soot - and, indeed, a heap of this lay
in the fender.  There had been no fire in the room since mother
went away, and all the chairs and tables were in the wrong places,
and the chrysanthemums were dead, and the water in the pot nearly
dried up.  Anthea wrapped the embroidered woolly sofa blanket round
Jane and herself, while Robert and Cyril had a struggle, silent and
brief, but fierce, for the larger share of the fur hearthrug.</p>

<p>'It is most truly awful,' said Anthea, 'and I am so tired.  Let's
let the cats loose.'</p>

<p>'And the cow, perhaps?' said Cyril.  'The police would find us at
once.  That cow would stand at the gate and mew - I mean moo - to
come in.  And so would the cats.  No; I see quite well what we've
got to do.  We must put them in baskets and leave them on people's
doorsteps, like orphan foundlings.'</p>

<p>'We've got three baskets, counting mother's work one,' said Jane
brightening.</p>

<p>'And there are nearly two hundred cats,' said Anthea, 'besides the
cow - and it would have to be a different-sized basket for her; and
then I don't know how you'd carry it, and you'd never find a
doorstep big enough to put it on.  Except the church one - and - '</p>

<p>'Oh, well,' said Cyril, 'if you simply MAKE difficulties - '</p>

<p>'I'm with you,' said Robert.  'Don't fuss about the cow, Panther. 
It's simply GOT to stay the night, and I'm sure I've read that the
cow is a remunerating creature, and that means it will sit still
and think for hours.  The carpet can take it away in the morning. 
And as for the baskets, we'll do them up in dusters, or
pillow-cases, or bath-towels.  Come on, Squirrel.  You girls can be
out of it if you like.'</p>

<p>His tone was full of contempt, but Jane and Anthea were too tired
and desperate to care; even being 'out of it', which at other times
they could not have borne, now seemed quite a comfort.  They
snuggled down in the sofa blanket, and Cyril threw the fur
hearthrug over them.</p>

<p>'Ah, he said, 'that's all women are fit for - to keep safe and warm,
while the men do the work and run dangers and risks and things.'</p>

<p>'I'm not,' said Anthea, 'you know I'm not.'  But Cyril was gone.</p>

<p>It was warm under the blanket and the hearthrug, and Jane snuggled
up close to her sister; and Anthea cuddled Jane closely and kindly,
and in a sort of dream they heard the rise of a wave of mewing as
Robert opened the door of the nursery.  They heard the booted
search for baskets in the back kitchen.  They heard the side door
open and close, and they knew that each brother had gone out with
at least one cat.  Anthea's last thought was that it would take at
least all night to get rid of one hundred and ninety-nine cats by
twos.  There would be ninety-nine journeys of two cats each, and one
cat over.</p>

<p>'I almost think we might keep the one cat over,' said Anthea.  'I
don't seem to care for cats just now, but I daresay I shall again
some day.'  And she fell asleep.  Jane also was sleeping.</p>

<p>It was Jane who awoke with a start, to find Anthea still asleep. 
As, in the act of awakening, she kicked her sister, she wondered
idly why they should have gone to bed in their boots; but the next
moment she remembered where they were.</p>

<p>There was a sound of muffled, shuffled feet on the stairs.  Like
the heroine of the classic poem, Jane 'thought it was the boys',
and as she felt quite wide awake, and not nearly so tired as
before, she crept gently from Anthea's side and followed the
footsteps.  They went down into the basement; the cats, who seemed
to have fallen into the sleep of exhaustion, awoke at the sound of
the approaching footsteps and mewed piteously.  Jane was at the
foot of the stairs before she saw it was not her brothers whose
coming had roused her and the cats, but a burglar.  She knew he was
a burglar at once, because he wore a fur cap and a red and black
charity-check comforter, and he had no business where he was.</p>

<p>If you had been stood in jane's shoes you would no doubt have run
away in them, appealing to the police and neighbours with horrid
screams.  But Jane knew better.  She had read a great many nice
stories about burglars, as well as some affecting pieces of poetry,
and she knew that no burglar will ever hurt a little girl if he
meets her when burgling.  Indeed, in all the cases Jane had read
of, his burglarishness was almost at once forgotten in the interest
he felt in the little girl's artless prattle.  So if Jane hesitated
for a moment before addressing the burglar, it was only because she
could not at once think of any remark sufficiently prattling and
artless to make a beginning with.  In the stories and the affecting
poetry the child could never speak plainly, though it always looked
old enough to in the pictures.  And Jane could not make up her mind
to lisp and 'talk baby', even to a burglar.  And while she
hesitated he softly opened the nursery door and went in.</p>

<p>Jane followed - just in time to see him sit down flat on the floor,
scattering cats as a stone thrown into a pool splashes water.</p>

<p>She closed the door softly and stood there, still wondering whether
she COULD bring herself to say, 'What's 'oo doing here, Mithter
Wobber?' and whether any other kind of talk would do.</p>

<p>Then she heard the burglar draw a long breath, and he spoke.</p>

<p>'It's a judgement,' he said, 'so help me bob if it ain't.  Oh,
'ere's a thing to 'appen to a chap!  Makes it come 'ome to you,
don't it neither?  Cats an' cats an' cats.  There couldn't be all
them cats.  Let alone the cow.  If she ain't the moral of the old
man's Daisy.  She's a dream out of when I was a lad - I don't mind
'er so much.  'Ere, Daisy, Daisy?'</p>

<p>The cow turned and looked at him.</p>

<p>'SHE'S all right,' he went on.  'Sort of company, too.  Though them
above knows how she got into this downstairs parlour.  But them
cats - oh, take 'em away, take 'em away!  I'll chuck the 'ole
show - Oh, take 'em away.'</p>

<p>'Burglar,' said Jane, close behind him, and he started
convulsively, and turned on her a blank face, whose pale lips
trembled.  'I can't take those cats away.'</p>

<p>'Lor' lumme!' exclaimed the man; 'if 'ere ain't another on 'em. 
Are you real, miss, or something I'll wake up from presently?'</p>

<p>'I am quite real,' said Jane, relieved to find that a lisp was not
needed to make the burglar understand her.  'And so,' she added,
'are the cats.'</p>

<p>'Then send for the police, send for the police, and I'll go quiet. 
If you ain't no realler than them cats, I'm done, spunchuck - out of
time.  Send for the police.  I'll go quiet.  One thing, there'd not
be room for 'arf them cats in no cell as ever <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> see.'</p>

<p>He ran his fingers through his hair, which was short, and his eyes
wandered wildly round the roomful of cats.</p>

<p>'Burglar,' said Jane, kindly and softly, 'if you didn't like cats,
what did you come here for?'</p>

<p>'Send for the police,' was the unfortunate criminal's only reply. 
'I'd rather you would - honest, I'd rather.'</p>

<p>'I daren't,' said Jane, 'and besides, I've no one to send.  I hate
the police.  I wish he'd never been born.'</p>

<p>'You've a feeling 'art, miss,' said the burglar; 'but them cats is
really a little bit too thick.'</p>

<p>'Look here,' said Jane, 'I won't call the police.  And I am quite
a real little girl, though I talk older than the kind you've met
before when you've been doing your burglings.  And they are real
cats - and they want real milk - and - Didn't you say the cow was
like somebody's Daisy that you used to know?'</p>

<p>'Wish I may die if she ain't the very spit of her,' replied the
man.</p>

<p>'Well, then,' said Jane - and a thrill of joyful pride ran through
her - 'perhaps you know how to milk cows?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps I does,' was the burglar's cautious rejoinder.</p>

<p>'Then,' said Jane, 'if you will ONLY milk ours - you don't know how
we shall always love you.'</p>

<p>The burglar replied that loving was all very well.</p>

<p>'If those cats only had a good long, wet, thirsty drink of milk,'
Jane went on with eager persuasion, 'they'd lie down and go to
sleep as likely as not, and then the police won't come back.  But
if they go on mewing like this he will, and then I don't know
what'll become of us, or you either.'</p>

<p>This argument seemed to decide the criminal.  Jane fetched the
wash-bowl from the sink, and he spat on his hands and prepared to
milk the cow.  At this instant boots were heard on the stairs.</p>

<p>'It's all up,' said the man, desperately, 'this 'ere's a plant. 
'ERE'S the police.'  He made as if to open the window and leap from
it.</p>

<p>'It's all right, I tell you,' whispered Jane, in anguish.  'I'll
say you're a friend of mine, or the good clergyman called in, or my
uncle, or ANYTHIING - only do, do, do milk the cow.  Oh, DON'T
go - oh - oh, thank goodness it's only the boys!'</p>

<p>It was; and their entrance had awakened Anthea, who, with her
brothers, now crowded through the doorway.  The man looked about
him like a rat looks round a trap.</p>

<p>'This is a friend of mine,' said Jane; 'he's just called in, and
he's going to milk the cow for us.  ISN'T it good and kind of him?'</p>

<p>She winked at the others, and though they did not understand they
played up loyally.</p>

<p>'How do?' said Cyril, 'Very glad to meet you.  Don't let us
interrupt the milking.'</p>

<p>'I shall 'ave a 'ead and a 'arf in the morning, and no bloomin'
error,' remarked the burglar; but he began to milk the cow.</p>

<p>Robert was winked at to stay and see that he did not leave off
milking or try to escape, and the others went to get things to put
the milk in; for it was now spurting and foaming in the wash-bowl,
and the cats had ceased from mewing and were crowding round the
cow, with expressions of hope and anticipation on their whiskered
faces.</p>

<p>'We can't get rid of any more cats,' said Cyril, as he and his
sisters piled a tray high with saucers and soup-plates and platters
and pie-dishes, 'the police nearly got us as it was.  Not the same
one - a much stronger sort.  He thought it really was a foundling
orphan we'd got.  If it hadn't been for me throwing the two bags of
cat slap in his eye and hauling Robert over a railing, and lying
like mice under a laurel-bush - Well, it's jolly lucky I'm a good
shot, that's all.  He pranced off when he'd got the cat-bags off
his face - thought we'd bolted.  And here we are.'</p>

<p>The gentle samishness of the milk swishing into the hand-bowl
seemed to have soothed the burglar very much.  He went on milking
in a sort of happy dream, while the children got a cap and ladled
the warm milk out into the pie-dishes and plates, and platters and
saucers, and set them down to the music of Persian purrs and
lappings.</p>

<p>'It makes me think of old times,' said the burglar, smearing his
ragged coat-cuff across his eyes - 'about the apples in the orchard
at home, and the rats at threshing time, and the rabbits and the
ferrets, and how pretty it was seeing the pigs killed.'</p>

<p>Finding him in this softened mood, Jane said - </p>

<p>'I wish you'd tell us how you came to choose our house for your
burglaring to-night.  I am awfully glad you did.  You have been so
kind.  I don't know what we should have done without you,' she
added hastily.  'We all love you ever so.  Do tell us.'</p>

<p>The others added their affectionate entreaties, and at last the
burglar said - </p>

<p>'Well, it's my first job, and I didn't expect to be made so
welcome, and that's the truth, young gents and ladies.  And I don't
know but what it won't be my last.  For this 'ere cow, she reminds
me of my father, and I know 'ow 'e'd 'ave 'ided me if I'd laid
'ands on a 'a'penny as wasn't my own.'</p>

<p>'I'm sure he would,' Jane agreed kindly; 'but what made you come
here?'</p>

<p>'Well, miss,' said the burglar, 'you know best 'ow you come by them
cats, and why you don't like the police, so I'll give myself away
free, and trust to your noble 'earts.  (You'd best bale out a bit,
the pan's getting fullish.) I was a-selling oranges off of my
barrow - for I ain't a burglar by trade, though you 'ave used the
name so free - an' there was a lady bought three 'a'porth off me. 
An' while she was a-pickin' of them out - very careful indeed, and
I'm always glad when them sort gets a few over-ripe ones - there was
two other ladies talkin' over the fence.  An' one on 'em said to
the other on 'em just like this - </p>

<p>&quot;'I've told both gells to come, and they can doss in with M'ria and
Jane, 'cause their boss and his missis is miles away and the kids
too.  So they can just lock up the 'ouse and leave the gas
a-burning, so's no one won't know, and get back bright an' early by
'leven o'clock.  And we'll make a night of it, Mrs Prosser, so we
will.  I'm just a-going to run out to pop the letter in the post.&quot;
And then the lady what had chosen the three ha'porth so careful,
she said: &quot;Lor, Mrs Wigson, I wonder at you, and your hands all
over suds.  This good gentleman'll slip it into the post for yer,
I'll be bound, seeing I'm a customer of his.&quot; So they give me the
letter, and of course I read the direction what was written on it
afore I shoved it into the post.  And then when I'd sold my
barrowful, I was a-goin' 'ome with the chink in my pocket, and I'm
blowed if some bloomin' thievin' beggar didn't nick the lot whilst
I was just a-wettin' of my whistle, for callin' of oranges is dry
work.  Nicked the bloomin' lot 'e did - and me with not a farden to
take 'ome to my brother and his missus.'</p>

<p>'How awful!' said Anthea, with much sympathy.</p>

<p>'Horful indeed, miss, I believe yer,' the burglar rejoined, with
deep feeling.  'You don't know her temper when she's roused.  An'
I'm sure I 'ope you never may, neither.  And I'd 'ad all my oranges
off of 'em.  So it came back to me what was wrote on the
ongverlope, and I says to myself, &quot;Why not, seein' as I've been
done myself, and if they keeps two slaveys there must be some
pickings?&quot; An' so 'ere I am.  But them cats, they've brought me
back to the ways of honestness.  Never no more.'</p>

<p>'Look here,' said Cyril, 'these cats are very valuable - very
indeed.  And we will give them all to you, if only you will take
them away.'</p>

<p>'I see they're a breedy lot,' replied the burglar.  'But I don't
want no bother with the coppers.  Did you come by them honest now?
Straight?'</p>

<p>'They are all our very own,' said Anthea, 'we wanted them, but the
confidement - '</p>

<p>'Consignment,' whispered Cyril.</p>

<p>'was larger than we wanted, and they're an awful bother.  If you
got your barrow, and some sacks or baskets, your brother's missus
would be awfully pleased.  My father says Persian cats are worth
pounds and pounds each.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said the burglar - and he was certainly moved by her
remarks - 'I see you're in a hole - and I don't mind lending a helping
'and.  I don't ask 'ow you come by them.  But I've got a pal - 'e's
a mark on cats.  I'll fetch him along, and if he thinks they'd
fetch anything above their skins I don't mind doin' you a
kindness.'</p>

<p>'You won't go away and never come back,' said Jane, 'because I
don't think I COULD bear that.'</p>

<p>The burglar, quite touched by her emotion, swore sentimentally
that, alive or dead, he would come back.</p>

<p>Then he went, and Cyril and Robert sent the girls to bed and sat up
to wait for his return.  It soon seemed absurd to await him in a
state of wakefulness, but his stealthy tap on the window awoke them
readily enough.  For he did return, with the pal and the barrow and
the sacks.  The pal approved of the cats, now dormant in Persian
repletion, and they were bundled into the sacks, and taken away on
the barrow - mewing, indeed, but with mews too sleepy to attract
public attention.</p>

<p>'I'm a fence - that's what I am,' said the burglar gloomily.  'I
never thought I'd come down to this, and all acause er my kind
'eart.'</p>

<p>Cyril knew that a fence is a receiver of stolen goods, and he
replied briskly - </p>

<p>'I give you my sacred the cats aren't stolen.  What do you make the
time?'</p>

<p>'I ain't got the time on me,' said the pal - 'but it was just about
chucking-out time as I come by the &quot;Bull and Gate&quot;.  I shouldn't
wonder if it was nigh upon one now.'</p>

<p>When the cats had been removed, and the boys and the burglar had
parted with warm expressions of friendship, there remained only the
cow.</p>

<p>'She must stay all night,' said Robert.  'Cook'll have a fit when
she sees her.'</p>

<p>'All night?' said Cyril.  'Why - it's tomorrow morning if it's one. 
We can have another wish!'</p>

<p>So the carpet was urged, in a hastily written note, to remove the
cow to wherever she belonged, and to return to its proper place on
the nursery floor.  But the cow could not be got to move on to the
carpet.  So Robert got the clothes line out of the back kitchen,
and tied one end very firmly to the cow's horns, and the other end
to a bunched-up corner of the carpet, and said 'Fire away.'</p>

<p>And the carpet and cow vanished together, and the boys went to bed,
tired out and only too thankful that the evening at last was over.</p>

<p>Next morning the carpet lay calmly in its place, but one corner was
very badly torn.  It was the corner that the cow had been tied on
to.</p>
