<p>The light crept farther under the door of Farmer Brown's henhouse,
and by this time the hens were all awake. Furthermore, they had
discovered Jimmy Skunk down below and were making a great fuss.
They were cackling so that Unc' Billy was sure Farmer Brown's
boy would soon hear them and hurry out to find out what the noise
was all about.</p>

<p>"If yo' would just get out of sight, Brer Skunk, Ah reckons those
fool hens would keep quiet," Unc' Billy ventured.</p>

<p>"I don't mind their noise. It doesn't trouble me a bit," replied
Jimmy Skunk, and grinned. It was plain enough to Unc' Billy that
Jimmy was enjoying the situation.</p>

<p>But Unc' Billy wasn't. He was so anxious that he couldn't keep
still. He paced back and forth along the shelf in front of the
upper row of nests and tried to make up his mind whether it would
be better to go down and face Jimmy Skunk or to try to hide under
the hay in one of the nests, and all the time he kept listening
and listening and listening for the footsteps of Farmer Brown's
boy.</p>

<p>At last he heard them, and he knew by the sound that Farmer Brown's
boy was coming in a hurry. He had heard the noise of the hens
and was coming to find out what it was all about. Unc' Billy hoped
that now Jimmy Skunk would retreat through the hole in the floor
and give him a chance to escape.</p>

<p>"He's coming! Farmer Brown's boy is coming, Brer Skunk! Yo' better
get away while yo' can!" whispered Unc' Billy.</p>

<p>"I hear him," replied Jimmy calmly. "I'm waiting for him to open
the door for me to go out. It will be much easier than squeezing
through that hole."</p>

<p>Unc' Billy gasped. He knew, of course, that it was Jimmy Skunk's
boast that he feared no one, but it was hard to believe that Jimmy
really intended to face Farmer Brown's boy right in his own henhouse
where Jimmy had no business to be. He hoped that at last Jimmy's
boldness would get him into trouble. Yes, he did. You see, that
might give him a chance to slip away himself. Otherwise, he would
be in a bad fix.</p>

<p>The latch on the door rattled. Unc' Billy crept into one of the
nests, but frightened as he was, he couldn't keep from peeping
over the edge to see what would happen. The door swung open, letting
in a flood of light. The hens stopped their noise. Farmer Brown's
boy stood in the doorway and looked in. Jimmy Skunk lifted his
big plume of a tail just a bit higher than usual and calmly and
without the least sign of being in a hurry walked straight towards
the open door. Of course Farmer Brown's boy saw him at once.</p>

<p>"So it's you, you black and white rascal!" he exclaimed. "I suppose
you expect me to step out of your way, and I suppose I will do
just that very thing. You are the most impudent and independent
fellow of my acquaintance. That's what you are. You didn't get
any eggs, because I gathered all of them last night. And you didn't
get a chicken because they were wise enough to stay on their roosts,
so I don't know as I have any quarrel with you, and I'm sure I
don't want any. Come along out of there, you rascal."</p>

<p>Farmer Brown's boy stepped aside, and Jimmy Skunk calmly and
without the least sign of hurry or worry walked out, stopped for
a drink at the pan of water in the henyard, walked through the
henyard gate, and turned towards the stone wall along the edge
of the Old Orchard.</p>
