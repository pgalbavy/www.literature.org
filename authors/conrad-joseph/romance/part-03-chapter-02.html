<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>All this is in my mind now, softened by distance, by the tenderness
of things remembered&mdash;the wonderful dawn of life, with all the
mystery and promise of the young day breaking amongst heavy thunder-clouds.
At the time I was overwhelmed &mdash;I can't express it otherwise.
I felt like a man thrown out to sink or swim, trying to keep his
head above water. Of course, I did not suspect Carlos now; I was
ashamed of ever having done so. I had long ago forgiven him his
methods. "In a great need, you must," he had said, looking at
me anxiously, "recur to desperate remedies." And he was going
to die. I had made no answer, and only hung my head&mdash;not in resentment,
but in doubt of my strength to bear the burden of the great trust
that this man whom I loved for his gayety, his recklessness and
romance, was going to leave in my inexperienced hands.</p>

<p>He had talked till, at last exhausted, he sank back gently on
the pillows of the enormous bed emblazoned like a monument. I
went out, following a gray-headed negro, and the nun glided in,
and stood at the foot with her white hands folded patiently.</p>

<p>"Señor!" I heard her mutter reproachfully to the invalid.</p>

<p>"Do not scold a poor sinner, Dona Maria," he addressed her feebly,
with valiant jocularity. "The days are not many now."</p>

<p>The strangeness and tremendousness of what was happening came
over me very strongly whilst, in a large chamber with barred loopholes,
I was throwing off the rags in which I had entered this house.
The night had come already, and I was putting on some of Carlos'
clothes by the many flames of candles burning in a tall bronze
candelabrum, whose three legs figured the paws of a lion. And
never, since I had gone on the road to wait for the smugglers,
and been choked by the Bow Street runners, had I remembered so
well the house in which I was born. It was as if, till then, I
had never felt the need to look back. But now, like something
romantic and glamorous, there came before me Veronica's sweet,
dim face, my mother's severe and resolute countenance. I had need
of all her resoluteness now. And I remembered the figure of my
father in the big chair by the ingle, powerless and lost in his
search for rhymes. He might have understood the romance of my
situation.</p>

<p>It grew upon me as I thought. Don Balthasar, I understood, was
apprised of my arrival. As in a dream, I followed the old negro,
who had returned to the door of my room. It grew upon me in the
silence of this colonnaded court. We walked along the upper gallery;
his cane tapped before me on the tessellated pavement; below,
the water splashed in the marble basins; glass lanthorns hung
glimmering between the pillars and, in wrought silver frames,
lighted the broad white staircase. Under the inner curve of the
vaulted gateway a black-faced man on guard, with a bell-mouthed
gun, rose from a stool at our passing. I thought I saw Castro's
peaked hat and large cloak flit in the gloom into which fell the
light from the small doorway of a sort of guardroom near the closed
gate. We continued along the arcaded walk; a double curtain was
drawn to right and left before me, while my guide stepped aside.</p>

<p>In a vast white apartment three black figures stood about a central
glitter of crystal and silver. At once the aged, slightly mechanical
voice of Don Balthasar rose thinly, putting himself and his house
at my disposition.</p>

<p>The formality of movements, of voices, governed and checked the
unbounded emotions of my wonder. The two ladies sank, with a rustle
of starch and stiff silks, in answer to my profound bow. I had
just enough control over myself to accomplish that, but mentally
I was out of breath; and when I felt the slight, trembling touch
of Don Balthasar's hand resting on my inclined head, it was as
if I had suddenly become aware for a moment of the earth's motion.
The hand was gone; his face was averted, and a corpulent priest,
all straight and black below his rosy round face, had stepped
forward to say a Latin grace in solemn tones that wheezed a little.
As soon as he had done he withdrew with a circular bow to the
ladies, to Don Balthasar, who inclined his silvery head. His lifeless
voice propounded:</p>

<p>"Our excellent Father Antonio, in his devotion, dines by the
bedside of our beloved Carlos." He sighed. The heavy carvings
of his chair rose upright at his back; he sat with his head leaning
forward over his silver plate. A heavy silence fell. Death hovered
over that table&mdash;and also, as it were, the breath of past ages.
The multitude of lights, the polished floor of costly wood, the
bare whiteness of walls wainscotted with marble, the vastness
of the room, the imposing forms of furniture, carved heavily in
ebony, impressed me with a sense of secular and austere magnificence.
For centuries there had always been a Riego living in this fortress-like
palace, ruling this portion of the New World with the whole majesty
of his race. And I thought of the long, loop-holed, buttressed
walls that this abode of noble adventurers presented foursquare
to the night outside, standing there by the seashore like a tomb
of warlike glories. They built their houses thus, centuries ago,
when the bands of buccaneers, indomitable and atrocious, had haunted
their conquest with a reminder of mortality and weakness.</p>

<p>It was a tremendous thing for me, this dinner. The portly duenna
on my left had a round eye and an irritated, parrot-like profile,
crowned by a high comb, a head shaded by black lace. I dared hardly
lift my eyes to the dark and radiant presence facing me across
a table furniture that was like a display of treasure.</p>

<p>But I did look. She was the girl of the lizard, the girl of the
dagger, and, in the solemnity of the silence, she was like a fabulous
apparition from a half-forgotten tale. I watched covertly the
youthful grace of her features. The curve of her cheek filled
me with delight. From time to time she shook the heavy clusters
of her curls, and I was amazed, as though I had never before seen
a woman's hair. Each parting of her lips was a distinct anticipation
of a great felicity; when she said a few words to me, I felt an
inward trembling. They were indifferent words.</p>

<p>Had she forgotten she was the girl with the dagger? And the old
Don? What did that old man know? What did he think? What did he
mean by that touch of a blessing on my head? Did <em>he</em> know
how I had come to his house? But every turn of her head troubled
my thoughts. The movements of her hands made me forget myself.
The gravity of her eyes above the smile of her lips suggested
ideas of adoration.</p>

<p>We were served noiselessly. A battalion of young lusty negroes,
in blue jackets laced with silver, walked about barefooted under
the command of the old major-domo. He, alone, had white silk stockings,
and shoes with silver buckles; his wide-skirted maroon velvet
coat, with gold on the collar and cuffs, hung low about his thin
shanks; and, with a long ebony staff in his hand, he directed
the service from behind Don Balthasar's chair. At times he bent
towards his master's ear. Don Balthasar answered with a murmur:
and those two faces brought close together, one like a noble ivory
carving, the other black with the mute pathos of the African faces,
seemed to commune in a fellowship of age, of things far off, remembered,
lived through together. There was something mysterious and touching
in this violent contrast, toned down by the near approach to the
tomb&mdash;the brotherhood of master and slave.</p>

<p>At a given moment an enormous iron key was brought in on a silver
salver, and, bending over the chair, the gray-headed negro laid
it by Don Balthasar's plate.</p>

<p>"Don Carlos' orders," he muttered.</p>

<p>The old Don seemed to wake up; a little colour mounted to his
cheeks.</p>

<p>"There was a time, young <em>caballero</em>, when the gates of
Casa Riego stood open night and day to the griefs and poverty
of the people, like the doors of a church&mdash;and as respected. But
now it seems . . ."</p>

<p>He mumbled a little peevishly, but seemed to recollect himself.
"The safety of his guest is like the breath of life to a Castilian,"
he ended, with a benignant but attentive look at me.</p>

<p>He rose, and we passed out through the double lines of the servants
ranged from table to door. By the splash of the fountain, on a
little round table between two chairs, stood a many-branched candlestick.
The duenna sat down opposite Don Balthasar. A multitude of stars
was suspended over the breathless peace of the court.</p>

<p>"Señorita," I began, mustering all my courage, and all my Spanish,
"I do not know<hr>"</p>

<p>She was walking by my side with upright carriage and a nonchalant
step, and shut her fan smartly.</p>

<p>"Don Carlos himself had given me the dagger," she said rapidly.</p>

<p>The fan flew open; a touch of the wind fanning her person came
faintly upon my cheek with a suggestion of delicate perfume.</p>

<p>She noticed my confusion, and said, "Let us walk to the end,
Señor."</p>

<p>The old man and the duenna had cards in their hands now. The
intimate tone of her words ravished me into the seventh heaven.</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, when we were out of ear-shot, "I have the spirit
of my house; but I am only a weak girl. We have taken this resolution
because of your <em>hidal-guidad</em>, because you are our kinsman,
because you are English. <em>Ay de mi!</em> Would I had been a
man. My father needs a son in his great, great age. Poor father!
Poor Don Carlos!"</p>

<p>There was the catch of a sob in the shadow of the end gallery.
We turned back, and the undulation of her walk seemed to throw
me into a state of exaltation.</p>

<p>"On the word of an Englishman<hr>" I began.</p>

<p>The fan touched my arm. The eyes of the duenna glittered over
the cards.</p>

<p>"This woman belongs to that man, too," muttered Seraphina. "And
yet she used to be faithful&mdash;almost a mother. <em>Misericordia!</em>
Señor, there is no one in this unhappy place that he has not bought,
corrupted, frightened, or bent to his will&mdash;to his madness of
hate against England. Of our poor he has made a rabble. The bishop
himself is afraid."</p>

<p>Such was the beginning of our first conversation in this court
suggesting the cloistered peace of a convent. We strolled to and
fro; she dropped her eyelids, and the agitation of her mind, pictured
in the almost fierce swiftness of her utterance, made a wonderful
contrast to the leisurely rhythm of her movements, marked by the
slow beating of the fan. The retirement of her father from the
world after her mother's death had made a great solitude round
his declining years. Yes, that sorrow, and the base intrigues
of that man&mdash;a fugitive, a hanger-on of her mother's family&mdash;recommended
to Don Balthasar's grace by her mother's favour. Yes! He had,
before she died, thrown his baneful influence even upon that saintly
spirit, by the piety of his practices and these sufferings for
his faith he always paraded. His faith! Oh, hypocrite, hypocrite,
hypocrite! His only faith was hate&mdash;the hate of England. He would
sacrifice everything to it. He would despoil and ruin his greatest
benefactors, this fatal man!</p>

<p>"Señor, my cousin," she said picturesquely, "he would, if he
could, drop poison into every spring of clear water in your country.
. . . Smile, Don Juan."</p>

<p>Her repressed vehemence had held me spellbound, and the silvery
little burst of laughter ending her fierce tirade had the bewildering
effect of a crash on my mind. The other two looked up from their
cards.</p>

<p>"I pretend to laugh to deceive that woman," she explained quickly.
"I used to love her."</p>

<p>She had no one now about her she could trust or love. It was
as if the whole world were blind to the nefarious nature of that
man. He had possessed himself of her little father's mind. I glanced
towards the old Don, who at that moment was brokenly taking a
pinch of snuff out of a gold snuff-box, while the duenna, very
sallow and upright, waited, frowning loftily at her cards.</p>

<p>"It seemed as if nothing could restrain that man," Seraphina's
voice went on by my side, "neither fear nor gratitude." He seemed
to cast a spell upon people. He was the plenipotentiary of a powerful
religious order&mdash;no matter. Don Carlos knew these things better
than she did. He had the ear of the Captain-General through that.
"Sh! But the intrigues, the intrigues!" I saw her little hand
clenched on the closed fan. There were no bounds to his audacity.
He wasted their wealth. "The audacity!"  He had overawed her father's
mind; he claimed descent from his Irish kings, he who<hr> "Señor,
my English cousin, he even dares aspire to my person."</p>

<p>The game of cards was over.</p>

<p>"Death rather," she let fall in a whisper of calm resolution.</p>

<p>She dropped me a deep curtsey. Servants were ranging themselves
in a row, holding upright before their black faces wax lights
in tall silver candlesticks inherited from the second Viceroy
of Mexico. I bowed profoundly, with indignation on her behalf
and horror in my breast; and, turning away from me, she sank low,
bending her head to receive her father's blessing. The major-domo
preceded the <em>cortège</em>. The two women moved away with an
ample rustling of silk, and with lights carried on each side of
their black, stiff figures. Before they had disappeared up the
wide staircase, Don Balthasar, who had stood perfectly motionless
with his old face over his snuff-box, seemed to wake up, and made
in the air a hasty sign of the cross after his daughter.</p>

<p>They appeared again in the upper gallery between the columns.
I saw her head, draped in lace, carried proudly, with the white
flower in her hair. I raised my eyes. All my being seemed to strive
upwards in that glance. Had she turned her face my way just a
little? Illusion! And the double door above closed with an echoing
sound along the empty galleries. She had disappeared.</p>

<p>Don Balthasar took three turns in the courtyard, no more. It
was evidently a daily custom. When he withdrew his hand from my
arm to tap his snuff-box, we stood still till he was ready to
slip it in again. This was the strangest part of it, the most
touching, the most startling&mdash;that he should lean like this on
me, as if he had done it for years. Before me there must have
been somebody else. Carlos? Carlos, no doubt. And in this placing
me in that position there was apparent the work of death, the
work of life, of time, the pathetic realization of an inevitable
destiny. He talked a little disjointedly, with the uncertain swaying
of a shadow on his thoughts, as if the light of his mind had flickered
like an expiring lamp. I remember that once he asked me, in a
sort of senile worry, whether I had ever heard of an Irish king
called Brian Boru; but he did not seem to attach any importance
to my reply, and spoke no more till he said good-night at the
door of my chamber.</p>

<p>He went on to his apartment, surrounded by lights and preceded
by his major-domo, who walked as bowed with age as himself; but
the African had a firmer step.</p>

<p>I watched him go; there was about his progress in state something
ghostlike and royal, an old-time, decayed majesty. It was as if
he had arisen before me after a hundred years' sleep in his retreat&mdash;that
man who, in his wild and passionate youth, had endangered the
wealth of the Riegos, had been the idol of the Madrid populace,
and a source of dismay to his family. He had carried away, <em>vi
et armis</em>, a nun from a convent, incurring the enmity of the
Church and the displeasure of his sovereign. He had sacrificed
all his fortune in Europe to the service of his king, had fought
against the French, had a price put upon his head by a special
proclamation. He had known passion, power, war, exile, and love.
He had been thanked by his returned king, honoured for his wisdom,
and crushed with sorrow by the death of his young wife &mdash;Seraphina's
mother.</p>

<p>What a life! And what was my arm&mdash;my arm on which he had leaned
in his decay? I looked at it with a sort of surprise, dubiously.
What was expected of it? I asked myself. Would it have the strength?
Ah, let <em>her</em> only lean on it!</p>

<p>It seemed to me that I would have the power to shake down heavy
pillars of stone, like Samson, in her service; to reach up and
take the stars, one by one, to lay at her feet. I heard a sigh.
A shadow appeared in the gallery.</p>

<p>The door of my room was open. Leaning my back against the balustrade,
I saw the black figure of the Father Antonio, muttering over his
breviary, enter the space of the light.</p>

<p>He crossed himself, and stopped with a friendly, "You are taking
the air, my son. The night is warm." He was rubicund, and his
little eyes looked me over with priestly mansuetude.</p>

<p>I said it was warm indeed. I liked him instinctively.</p>

<p>He lifted his eyes to the starry sky. "The orbs are shining excessively,"
he said; then added, "To the greater glory of God. One is never
tired of contemplating this sublime spectacle."</p>

<p>"How is Don Carlos, your reverence?" I asked.</p>

<p>"My beloved penitent sleeps," he answered, peering at me benevolently;
"he reposes. Do you know, young <em>caballero</em>, that I have
been a prisoner of war in your country, and am acquainted with
Londres? I was chaplain of the ship <em>San José</em> at the battle
of Trafalgar. On my soul, it is, indeed, a blessed, fertile country,
full of beauty and of well-disposed hearts. I have never failed
since to say every day an especial prayer for its return to our
holy mother, the Church. Because I love it."</p>

<p>I said nothing to this, only bowing; and he laid a short, thick
hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"May your coming amongst us, my son, bring calmness to a Christian
soul too much troubled with the affairs of this world." He sighed,
nodded to me with a friendly, sad smile, and began to mutter his
prayers as he went.</p>
