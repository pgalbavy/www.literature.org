<p>IT is necessary now for us to relate the extraordinary events
which happened on the railway. At this part of the track, which
is double, there were two stations about four miles apart, through
which the express trains ran quite frequently. In the evening
after Théophraste had been speaking to Mme. Petito, the express
train had passed through the first station, and the station master
was waiting for the signal from the second station, when suddenly
a message came through saying that the train had not arrived yet.
The station master could not understand it. The train had passed
through his station fifteen minutes before, and would not have
taken all that time to go the short distance to the other station.
He went out and looked up the track. There was no sign of the
train, and all was quiet. Again the signal came back, and the
second station master said that he would walk along the track
to see if he could find the cause of the delay. The first man
said he would do the same, and they both started running down
the track, followed by other men in the stations. Although it
was broad daylight, nothing could be seen of the train, and the
two parties met on the track. The first station master was greatly
agitated, and wrung his hands in despair. He knew the train had
passed through his station. He was sure of it. The report of his
assistant confirmed it. Where could it have disappeared to? The
excitement and fear was too much for him, and without any warning
he fell dead at their feet with heart failure.</p>

<p>The men ran hither, thither, on both sides of the tracks, but
no sign of the train was there. At last they gave up the search,
and placing the dead body of the station master on a rough bier
of sticks and leaves, they made their way sadly back to the station.</p>

<p>They had not gone far when one of the party cried out: "Look
ahead, there’s the train!"</p>

<p>And there, a few yards outside the station, on the very track
they had traveled on, was a wagon and baggage car of the disappeared
train!</p>

<p>They were all very astonished, and were running, shouting, toward
the train, when they suddenly stopped. Peering out of the doors
of the train was a peculiar head. It had no ears, and appeared
as though the door had been shut violently, catching the man’s
neck. They called to him as soon as they saw him, but he did not
answer. The head just swayed from one side to the other, rocked
by the wind, which was blowing in great gusts. Upon the head was
curly hair, and the cravat around the white neck was untied, floating
in the wind.</p>

<p>On approaching, they saw the door of the coach was covered with
blood, and on examination saw that the man’s head was held to
the door by a piece of rag. He had evidently opened the door and
poked his head out, when somebody must have shut the door again
and decapitated him. The two men who carried the dead body of
the station master uttered a cry of dismay, and placing their
burden on the track, made an examination of the trucks. They found
no one in the first one, and opening the door of the second, found
that it was empty save for the dead man’s body, which had been
stripped of all its clothing.</p>

<p>The news of this fantastic horror spread rapidly in the villages
on the road, and an enormous crowd gathered at the little station.</p>

<p>The police were sent for, but they were unable to get any clue
as to who the strange man was, or where the train with all its
travelers had gone to.</p>

<p>They were, however, very quiet about it, and only at the inquest
did the facts become known.</p>

<p>As it has been said, the tracks between these stations contained
no bridge or tunnel, but ran through a flat, desolate country,
marked by no hills. The only thing to break the line of the track
was a short side line which ran into a disused quarry, which had
been used as a sand quarry by a glassmaker. This had been abandoned
many years ago, and had not been used since.</p>

<p>On looking at the plan one would at once think that the presence
of this branch line was an explanation of the train disaster.
But this was not so, as subsequent events will prove. In fact,
so simple a solution of the problem would soon have been discovered
by the station men.</p>

<p>Wandering along the road which followed the track, Théophraste
had noticed the little side track, and he had seen that the switch
had been left unlocked. This would have had no significance to
him before he had the interview with Mme. Petito, but now he saw
an excellent opportunity of getting at Signor Petito, who was
on the train. He of course could not get on the train while it
was in motion. He would open the switch and wait for the train
to come up. The engineer would be sure to see it and stop his
train. Here was his opportunity.</p>

<p>This was simple enough, and he did as he intended. He turned
the switch, and, going along the track, hid behind the bushes
to await the express. He waited and waited for a long time, but
no express came. He became impatient, and looked up and down the
track, hoping to hear it, or see its smoke.</p>

<p>However, after half an hour, he rose, and, although tired of
waiting, went down the track to see what had happened. He had
gone about half the distance to the station, when he met a train-fitter
who was going along the track to look for the train. Asking him
what had become of the train, he turned back up the line, and
arriving at the point where he had been hiding, he discovered
the baggage car and carriage which were to be found a few minutes
later by the trainmen from the station.</p>

<p>In his astonishment he asked how they could have got there without
passing him. He had not left the track, so it could not have passed
him.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw the head of a man at the carriage door; the head
had no ears, and so he quickly recognized it as that of Signor
Petito. He climbed up into the carriage, all excitement, and searching
the carriage, suddenly had an idea. He would disguise himself
in Signor Petito’s clothes! He quickly undressed, and stripping
the dead body of all its clothes put them on, and tied his own
up in a bundle. He then descended from the carriage, and fumbling
in the pockets of the dead man’s clothes, drew out an old pocketbook.
He became feverishly excited as he searched through the papers,
seeking some trace of his treasures. But he found nothing, and
he found it difficult to hide his disappointment, for Signor Petito
had carried the secret of the treasure to the grave.</p>

<p>Mme. Petito was unable to give him any information, for soon
after hearing of her husband’s death she became insane, and remained
so to the end of her days.</p>
