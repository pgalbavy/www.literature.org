<P>
I met him first in a hurricane; and though we had gone through the hurricane
on the same schooner, it was not until the schooner had gone to pieces under
us that I first laid eyes on him. Without doubt I had seen him with the rest
of the kanaka crew on board, but I had not consciously been aware of his
existence, for the Petite Jeanne was rather overcrowded. In addition to her
eight or ten kanaka seamen, her white captain, mate, and supercargo, and her
six cabin passengers, she sailed from Rangiroa with something like eighty-five
deck passengers-- Paumotans and Tahitians, men, women, and children each with
a trade box, to say nothing of sleeping mats, blankets, and clothes bundles.
<P>
The pearling season in the Paumotus was over, and all hands were returning to
Tahiti. The six of us cabin passengers were pearl buyers. Two were Americans,
one was Ah Choon (the whitest Chinese I have ever known), one was a German,
one was a Polish Jew, and I completed the half dozen.
<P>
It had been a prosperous season. Not one of us had cause for complaint, nor
one of the eighty-five deck passengers either.  All had done well, and all
were looking forward to a rest-off and a good time in Papeete.
<P>
Of course, the Petite Jeanne was overloaded. She was only seventy tons, and
she had no right to carry a tithe of the mob she had on board. Beneath her
hatches she was crammed and jammed with pearl shell and copra. Even the trade
room was packed full with shell. It was a miracle that the sailors could work
her.  There was no moving about the decks. They simply climbed back and forth
along the rails.
<P>
In the night time they walked upon the sleepers, who carpeted the deck, I'll
swear, two deep. Oh! And there were pigs and chickens on deck, and sacks of
yams, while every conceivable place was festooned with strings of drinking
cocoanuts and bunches of bananas. On both sides, between the fore and main
shrouds, guys had been stretched, just low enough for the foreboom to swing
clear; and from each of these guys at least fifty bunches of bananas were
suspended.
<P>
It promised to be a messy passage, even if we did make it in the two or three
days that would have been required if the southeast trades had been blowing
fresh. But they weren't blowing fresh.  After the first five hours the trade
died away in a dozen or so gasping fans. The calm continued all that night and
the next day--one of those glaring, glassy, calms, when the very thought of
opening one's eyes to look at it is sufficient to cause a headache.
<P>
The second day a man died--an Easter Islander, one of the best divers that
season in the lagoon. Smallpox--that is what it was; though how smallpox could
come on board, when there had been no known cases ashore when we left
Rangiroa, is beyond me. There it was, though--smallpox, a man dead, and three
others down on their backs.
<P>
There was nothing to be done. We could not segregate the sick, nor could we
care for them. We were packed like sardines. There was nothing to do but rot
and die--that is, there was nothing to do after the night that followed the
first death. On that night, the mate, the supercargo, the Polish Jew, and four
native divers sneaked away in the large whale boat. They were never heard of
again. In the morning the captain promptly scuttled the remaining boats, and
there we were.
<P>
That day there were two deaths; the following day three; then it jumped to
eight. It was curious to see how we took it. The natives, for instance, fell
into a condition of dumb, stolid fear. The captain--Oudouse, his name was, a
Frenchman--became very nervous and voluble. He actually got the twitches. He
was a large fleshy man, weighing at least two hundred pounds, and he quickly
became a faithful representation of a quivering jelly-mountain of fat.
<P>
The German, the two Americans, and myself bought up all the Scotch whiskey,
and proceeded to stay drunk. The theory was beautiful--namely, if we kept
ourselves soaked in alcohol, every smallpox germ that came into contact with
us would immediately be scorched to a cinder. And the theory worked, though I
must confess that neither Captain Oudouse nor Ah Choon were attacked by the
disease either. The Frenchman did not drink at all, while Ah Choon restricted
himself to one drink daily.
<P>
It was a pretty time. The sun, going into northern declination, was straight
overhead. There was no wind, except for frequent squalls, which blew fiercely
for from five minutes to half an hour, and wound up by deluging us with rain.
After each squall, the awful sun would come out, drawing clouds of steam from
the soaked decks.
<P>
The steam was not nice. It was the vapor of death, freighted with millions and
millions of germs. We always took another drink when we saw it going up from
the dead and dying, and usually we took two or three more drinks, mixing them
exceptionally stiff.  Also, we made it a rule to take an additional several
each time they hove the dead over to the sharks that swarmed about us.
<P>
We had a week of it, and then the whiskey gave out. It is just as well, or I
shouldn't be alive now. It took a sober man to pull through what followed, as
you will agree when I mention the little fact that only two men did pull
through. The other man was the heathen--at least, that was what I heard
Captain Oudouse call him at the moment I first became aware of the heathen's
existence. But to come back.
<P>
It was at the end of the week, with the whiskey gone, and the pearl buyers
sober, that I happened to glance at the barometer that hung in the cabin
companionway. Its normal register in the Paumotus was 29.90, and it was quite
customary to see it vacillate between 29.85 and 30.00, or even 30.05; but to
see it as I saw it, down to 29.62, was sufficient to sober the most drunken
pearl buyer that ever incinerated smallpox microbes in Scotch whiskey.
<P>
I called Captain Oudouse's attention to it, only to be informed that he had
watched it going down for several hours. There was little to do, but that
little he did very well, considering the circumstances. He took off the light
sails, shortened right down to storm canvas, spread life lines, and waited for
the wind. His mistake lay in what he did after the wind came. He hove to on
the port tack, which was the right thing to do south of the Equator, if--and
there was the rub--IF one were NOT in the direct path of the hurricane.
<P>
We were in the direct path. I could see that by the steady increase of the
wind and the equally steady fall of the barometer. I wanted him to turn and
run with the wind on the port quarter until the barometer ceased falling, and
then to heave to. We argued till he was reduced to hysteria, but budge he
would not. The worst of it was that I could not get the rest of the pearl
buyers to back me up. Who was I, anyway, to know more about the sea and its
ways than a properly qualified captain? was what was in their minds, I knew.
<P>
Of course, the sea rose with the wind frightfully; and I shall never forget
the first three seas the Petite Jeanne shipped. She had fallen off, as vessels
do at times when hove to, and the first sea made a clean breach. The life
lines were only for the strong and well, and little good were they even for
them when the women and children, the bananas and cocoanuts, the pigs and
trade boxes, the sick and the dying, were swept along in a solid, screeching,
groaning mass.
<P>
The second sea filled the Petite Jeanne'S decks flush with the rails; and, as
her stern sank down and her bow tossed skyward, all the miserable dunnage of
life and luggage poured aft. It was a human torrent. They came head first,
feet first, sidewise, rolling over and over, twisting, squirming, writhing,
and crumpling up. Now and again one caught a grip on a stanchion or a rope;
but the weight of the bodies behind tore such grips loose.
<P>
One man I noticed fetch up, head on and square on, with the starboard bitt.
His head cracked like an egg. I saw what was coming, sprang on top of the
cabin, and from there into the mainsail itself. Ah Choon and one of the
Americans tried to follow me, but I was one jump ahead of them. The American
was swept away and over the stern like a piece of chaff. Ah Choon caught a
spoke of the wheel, and swung in behind it. But a strapping Raratonga vahine
(woman)--she must have weighed two hundred and fifty--brought up against him,
and got an arm around his neck. He clutched the kanaka steersman with his
other hand; and just at that moment the schooner flung down to starboard.
<P>
The rush of bodies and sea that was coming along the port runway between the
cabin and the rail turned abruptly and poured to starboard. Away they
went--vahine, Ah Choon, and steersman; and I swear I saw Ah Choon grin at me
with philosophic resignation as he cleared the rail and went under.
<P>
The third sea--the biggest of the three--did not do so much damage. By the
time it arrived nearly everybody was in the rigging. On deck perhaps a dozen
gasping, half-drowned, and half-stunned wretches were rolling about or
attempting to crawl into safety. They went by the board, as did the wreckage
of the two remaining boats. The other pearl buyers and myself, between seas,
managed to get about fifteen women and children into the cabin, and battened
down. Little good it did the poor creatures in the end.
<P>
Wind? Out of all my experience I could not have believed it possible for the
wind to blow as it did. There is no describing it. How can one describe a
nightmare? It was the same way with that wind. It tore the clothes off our
bodies. I say TORE THEM OFF, and I mean it. I am not asking you to believe it.
I am merely telling something that I saw and felt. There are times when I do
not believe it myself. I went through it, and that is enough. One could not
face that wind and live. It was a monstrous thing, and the most monstrous
thing about it was that it increased and continued to increase.
<P>
Imagine countless millions and billions of tons of sand. Imagine this sand
tearing along at ninety, a hundred, a hundred and twenty, or any other number
of miles per hour. Imagine, further, this sand to be invisible, impalpable,
yet to retain all the weight and density of sand. Do all this, and you may get
a vague inkling of what that wind was like.
<P>
Perhaps sand is not the right comparison. Consider it mud, invisible,
impalpable, but heavy as mud. Nay, it goes beyond that. Consider every
molecule of air to be a mudbank in itself.  Then try to imagine the
multitudinous impact of mudbanks. No; it is beyond me. Language may be
adequate to express the ordinary conditions of life, but it cannot possibly
express any of the conditions of so enormous a blast of wind. It would have
been better had I stuck by my original intention of not attempting a
description.
<P>
I will say this much: The sea, which had risen at first, was beaten down by
that wind. 'more: it seemed as if the whole ocean had been sucked up in the
maw of the hurricane, and hurled on through that portion of space which
previously had been occupied by the air.
<P>
Of course, our canvas had gone long before. But Captain Oudouse had on the
Petite Jeanne something I had never before seen on a South Sea schooner--a sea
anchor. It was a conical canvas bag, the mouth of which was kept open by a
huge loop of iron. The sea anchor was bridled something like a kite, so that
it bit into the water as a kite bites into the air, but with a difference. The
sea anchor remained just under the surface of the ocean in a perpendicular
position. A long line, in turn, connected it with the schooner. As a result,
the Petite Jeanne rode bow on to the wind and to what sea there was.
<P>
The situation really would have been favorable had we not been in the path of
the storm. True, the wind itself tore our canvas out of the gaskets, jerked
out our topmasts, and made a raffle of our running gear, but still we would
have come through nicely had we not been square in front of the advancing
storm center. That was what fixed us. I was in a state of stunned, numbed,
paralyzed collapse from enduring the impact of the wind, and I think I was
just about ready to give up and die when the center smote us.  The blow we
received was an absolute lull. There was not a breath of air. The effect on
one was sickening.
<P>
Remember that for hours we had been at terrific muscular tension, withstanding
the awful pressure of that wind. And then, suddenly, the pressure was removed.
I know that I felt as though I was about to expand, to fly apart in all
directions. It seemed as if every atom composing my body was repelling every
other atom and was on the verge of rushing off irresistibly into space. But
that lasted only for a moment. Destruction was upon us.
<P>
In the absence of the wind and pressure the sea rose. It jumped, it leaped, it
soared straight toward the clouds. Remember, from every point of the compass
that inconceivable wind was blowing in toward the center of calm. The result
was that the seas sprang up from every point of the compass. There was no wind
to check them. They popped up like corks released from the bottom of a pail of
water. There was no system to them, no stability. They were hollow, maniacal
seas. They were eighty feet high at the least. They were not seas at all. They
resembled no sea a man had ever seen.
<P>
They were splashes, monstrous splashes--that is all. Splashes that were eighty
feet high. Eighty! They were more than eighty.  They went over our mastheads.
They were spouts, explosions. They were drunken. They fell anywhere, anyhow.
They jostled one another; they collided. They rushed together and collapsed
upon one another, or fell apart like a thousand waterfalls all at once. It was
no ocean any man had ever dreamed of, that hurricane center. It was confusion
thrice confounded. It was anarchy. It was a hell pit of sea water gone mad.
<P>
The Petite Jeanne? I don't know. The heathen told me afterwards that he did
not know. She was literally torn apart, ripped wide open, beaten into a pulp,
smashed into kindling wood, annihilated. When I came to I was in the water,
swimming automatically, though I was about two-thirds drowned. How I got there
I had no recollection. I remembered seeing the Petite Jeanne fly to pieces at
what must have been the instant that my own consciousness was buffeted out of
me. But there I was, with nothing to do but make the best of it, and in that
best there was little promise. The wind was blowing again, the sea was much
smaller and more regular, and I knew that I had passed through the center.
Fortunately, there were no sharks about. The hurricane had dissipated the
ravenous horde that had surrounded the death ship and fed off the dead.
<P>
It was about midday when the Petite Jeanne went to pieces, and it must have
been two hours afterwards when I picked up with one of her hatch covers. Thick
rain was driving at the time; and it was the merest chance that flung me and
the hatch cover together. A short length of line was trailing from the rope
handle; and I knew that I was good for a day, at least, if the sharks did not
return. Three hours later, possibly a little longer, sticking close to the
cover, and with closed eyes, concentrating my whole soul upon the task of
breathing in enough air to keep me going and at the same time of avoiding
breathing in enough water to drown me, it seemed to me that I heard voices.
The rain had ceased, and wind and sea were easing marvelously. Not twenty feet
away from me, on another hatch cover were Captain Oudouse and the heathen.
They were fighting over the possession of the cover--at least, the Frenchman
was. "Paien noir!" I heard him scream, and at the same time I saw him kick the
kanaka.
<P>
Now, Captain Oudouse had lost all his clothes, except his shoes, and they were
heavy brogans. It was a cruel blow, for it caught the heathen on the mouth and
the point of the chin, half stunning him. I looked for him to retaliate, but
he contented himself with swimming about forlornly a safe ten feet away.
Whenever a fling of the sea threw him closer, the Frenchman, hanging on with
his hands, kicked out at him with both feet. Also, at the moment of delivering
each kick, he called the kanaka a black heathen.
<P>
"For two centimes I'd come over there and drown you, you white beast!" I
yelled.
<P>
The only reason I did not go was that I felt too tired. The very thought of
the effort to swim over was nauseating. So I called to the kanaka to come to
me, and proceeded to share the hatch cover with him. Otoo, he told me his name
was (pronounced o-to-o ); also, he told me that he was a native of Bora Bora,
the most westerly of the Society Group. As I learned afterward, he had got the
hatch cover first, and, after some time, encountering Captain Oudouse, had
offered to share it with him, and had been kicked off for his pains.
<P>
And that was how Otoo and I first came together. He was no fighter. He was all
sweetness and gentleness, a love creature, though he stood nearly six feet
tall and was muscled like a gladiator. He was no fighter, but he was also no
coward. He had the heart of a lion; and in the years that followed I have seen
him run risks that I would never dream of taking. What I mean is that while he
was no fighter, and while he always avoided precipitating a row, he never ran
away from trouble when it started. And it was "Ware shoal!" when once Otoo
went into action. I shall never forget what he did to Bill King. It occurred
in German Samoa. Bill King was hailed the champion heavyweight of the American
Navy. He was a big brute of a man, a veritable gorilla, one of those
hard-hitting, rough-housing chaps, and clever with his fists as well. He
picked the quarrel, and he kicked Otoo twice and struck him once before Otoo
felt it to be necessary to fight. I don't think it lasted four minutes, at the
end of which time Bill King was the unhappy possessor of four broken ribs, a
broken forearm, and a dislocated shoulder blade. Otoo knew nothing of
scientific boxing. He was merely a manhandler; and Bill King was something
like three months in recovering from the bit of manhandling he received that
afternoon on Apia beach.
<P>
But I am running ahead of my yarn. We shared the hatch cover between us. We
took turn and turn about, one lying flat on the cover and resting, while the
other, submerged to the neck, merely held on with his hands. For two days and
nights, spell and spell, on the cover and in the water, we drifted over the
ocean.  Towards the last I was delirious most of the time; and there were
times, too, when I heard Otoo babbling and raving in his native tongue. Our
continuous immersion prevented us from dying of thirst, though the sea water
and the sunshine gave us the prettiest imaginable combination of salt pickle
and sunburn.
<P>
In the end, Otoo saved my life; for I came to lying on the beach twenty feet
from the water, sheltered from the sun by a couple of cocoanut leaves. No one
but Otoo could have dragged me there and stuck up the leaves for shade. He was
lying beside me. I went off again; and the next time I came round, it was cool
and starry night, and Otoo was pressing a drinking cocoanut to my lips.
<P>
We were the sole survivors of the Petite Jeanne. Captain Oudouse must have
succumbed to exhaustion, for several days later his hatch cover drifted ashore
without him. Otoo and I lived with the natives of the atoll for a week, when
we were rescued by the French cruiser and taken to Tahiti. In the meantime,
however, we had performed the ceremony of exchanging names. In the South Seas
such a ceremony binds two men closer together than blood brothership. The
initiative had been mine; and Otoo was rapturously delighted when I suggested
it.
<P>
"It is well," he said, in Tahitian. "For we have been mates together for two
days on the lips of Death."
<P>
"But death stuttered," I smiled.
<P>
"It was a brave deed you did, master," he replied, "and Death was not vile
enough to speak."
<P>
"Why do you 'master' me?" I demanded, with a show of hurt feelings. "We have
exchanged names. To you I am Otoo. To me you are Charley. And between you and
me, forever and forever, you shall be Charley, and I shall be Otoo. It is the
way of the custom. And when we die, if it does happen that we live again
somewhere beyond the stars and the sky, still shall you be Charley to me, and
I Otoo to you."
<P>
"Yes, master," he answered, his eyes luminous and soft with joy.
<P>
"There you go!" I cried indignantly.
<P>
"What does it matter what my lips utter?" he argued. "They are only my lips.
But I shall think Otoo always. Whenever I think of myself, I shall think of
you. Whenever men call me by name, I shall think of you. And beyond the sky
and beyond the stars, always and forever, you shall be Otoo to me. Is it well,
master?"
<P>
I hid my smile, and answered that it was well.
<P>
We parted at Papeete. I remained ashore to recuperate; and he went on in a
cutter to his own island, Bora Bora. Six weeks later he was back. I was
surprised, for he had told me of his wife, and said that he was returning to
her, and would give over sailing on far voyages.
<P>
"Where do you go, master?" he asked, after our first greetings.
<P>
I shrugged my shoulders. It was a hard question.
<P>
"All the world," was my answer--"all the world, all the sea, and all the
islands that are in the sea."
<P>
"I will go with you," he said simply. "My wife is dead."
<P>
I never had a brother; but from what I have seen of other men's brothers, I
doubt if any man ever had a brother that was to him what Otoo was to me. He
was brother and father and mother as well. And this I know: I lived a
straighter and better man because of Otoo. I cared little for other men, but I
had to live straight in Otoo's eyes. Because of him I dared not tarnish
myself. He made me his ideal, compounding me, I fear, chiefly out of his own
love and worship and there were times when I stood close to the steep pitch of
hell, and would have taken the plunge had not the thought of Otoo restrained
me. His pride in me entered into me, until it became one of the major rules in
my personal code to do nothing that would diminish that pride of his.
<P>
Naturally, I did not learn right away what his feelings were toward me. He
never criticized, never censured; and slowly the exalted place I held in his
eyes dawned upon me, and slowly I grew to comprehend the hurt I could inflict
upon him by being anything less than my best.
<P>
For seventeen years we were together; for seventeen years he was at my
shoulder, watching while I slept, nursing me through fever and wounds--ay, and
receiving wounds in fighting for me. He signed on the same ships with me; and
together we ranged the Pacific from Hawaii to Sydney Head, and from Torres
Straits to the Galapagos. We blackbirded from the New Hebrides and the Line
Islands over to the westward clear through the Louisades, New Britain, New
Ireland, and New Hanover. We were wrecked three times--in the Gilberts, in the
Santa Cruz group, and in the Fijis. And we traded and salved wherever a dollar
promised in the way of pearl and pearl shell, copra, beche-de-mer, hawkbill
turtle shell, and stranded wrecks.
<P>
It began in Papeete, immediately after his announcement that he was going with
me over all the sea, and the islands in the midst thereof. There was a club in
those days in Papeete, where the pearlers, traders, captains, and riffraff of
South Sea adventurers forgathered. The play ran high, and the drink ran high;
and I am very much afraid that I kept later hours than were becoming or
proper. No matter what the hour was when I left the club, there was Otoo
waiting to see me safely home.
<P>
At first I smiled; next I chided him. Then I told him flatly that I stood in
need of no wet-nursing. After that I did not see him when I came out of the
club. Quite by accident, a week or so later, I discovered that he still saw me
home, lurking across the street among the shadows of the mango trees. What
could I do? I know what I did do.
<P>
Insensibly I began to keep better hours. On wet and stormy nights, in the
thick of the folly and the fun, the thought would persist in coming to me of
Otoo keeping his dreary vigil under the dripping mangoes. Truly, he made a
better man of me. Yet he was not strait-laced. And he knew nothing of common
Christian morality. All the people on Bora Bora were Christians; but he was a
heathen, the only unbeliever on the island, a gross materialist, who believed
that when he died he was dead. He believed merely in fair play and square
dealing. Petty meanness, in his code, was almost as serious as wanton
homicide; and I do believe that he respected a murderer more than a man given
to small practices.
<P>
Concerning me, personally, he objected to my doing anything that was hurtful
to me. Gambling was all right. He was an ardent gambler himself. But late
hours, he explained, were bad for one's health. He had seen men who did not
take care of themselves die of fever. He was no teetotaler, and welcomed a
stiff nip any time when it was wet work in the boats. On the other hand, he
believed in liquor in moderation. He had seen many men killed or disgraced by
square-face or Scotch.
<P>
Otoo had my welfare always at heart. He thought ahead for me, weighed my
plans, and took a greater interest in them than I did myself. At first, when I
was unaware of this interest of his in my affairs, he had to divine my
intentions, as, for instance, at Papeete, when I contemplated going partners
with a knavish fellow-countryman on a guano venture. I did not know he was a
knave. Nor did any white man in Papeete. Neither did Otoo know, but he saw how
thick we were getting, and found out for me, and without my asking him. Native
sailors from the ends of the seas knock about on the beach in Tahiti; and
Otoo, suspicious merely, went among them till he had gathered sufficient data
to justify his suspicions. Oh, it was a nice history, that of Randolph Waters.
I couldn't believe it when Otoo first narrated it; but when I sheeted it home
to Waters he gave in without a murmur, and got away on the first steamer to
Aukland.
<P>
At first, I am free to confess, I couldn't help resenting Otoo's poking his
nose into my business. But I knew that he was wholly unselfish; and soon I had
to acknowledge his wisdom and discretion. He had his eyes open always to my
main chance, and he was both keen-sighted and far-sighted. In time he became
my counselor, until he knew more of my business than I did myself.  He really
had my interest at heart more than I did. 'mine was the magnificent
carelessness of youth, for I preferred romance to dollars, and adventure to a
comfortable billet with all night in. So it was well that I had some one to
look out for me. I know that if it had not been for Otoo, I should not be here
today.
<P>
Of numerous instances, let me give one. I had had some experience in
blackbirding before I went pearling in the Paumotus. Otoo and I were on the
beach in Samoa--we really were on the beach and hard aground--when my chance
came to go as recruiter on a blackbird brig. Otoo signed on before the mast;
and for the next half-dozen years, in as many ships, we knocked about the
wildest portions of Melanesia. Otoo saw to it that he always pulled stroke-oar
in my boat. Our custom in recruiting labor was to land the recruiter on the
beach. The covering boat always lay on its oars several hundred feet off
shore, while the recruiter's boat, also lying on its oars, kept afloat on the
edge of the beach. When I landed with my trade goods, leaving my steering
sweep apeak, Otoo left his stroke position and came into the stern sheets,
where a Winchester lay ready to hand under a flap of canvas. The boat's crew
was also armed, the Sniders concealed under canvas flaps that ran the length
of the gunwales.
<P>
While I was busy arguing and persuading the woolly-headed cannibals to come
and labor on the Queensland plantations Otoo kept watch. And often and often
his low voice warned me of suspicious actions and impending treachery.
Sometimes it was the quick shot from his rifle, knocking a nigger over, that
was the first warning I received. And in my rush to the boat his hand was
always there to jerk me flying aboard. Once, I remember, on SANTA ANNA, the
boat grounded just as the trouble began. The covering boat was dashing to our
assistance, but the several score of savages would have wiped us out before it
arrived. Otoo took a flying leap ashore, dug both hands into the trade goods,
and scattered tobacco, beads, tomahawks, knives, and calicoes in all
directions.
<P>
This was too much for the woolly-heads. While they scrambled for the
treasures, the boat was shoved clear, and we were aboard and forty feet away.
And I got thirty recruits off that very beach in the next four hours.
<P>
The particular instance I have in mind was on Malaita, the most savage island
in the easterly Solomons. The natives had been remarkably friendly; and how
were we to know that the whole village had been taking up a collection for
over two years with which to buy a white man's head? The beggars are all
head-hunters, and they especially esteem a white man's head. The fellow who
captured the head would receive the whole collection.  As I say, they appeared
very friendly; and on this day I was fully a hundred yards down the beach from
the boat. Otoo had cautioned me; and, as usual when I did not heed him, I came
to grief.
<P>
The first I knew, a cloud of spears sailed out of the mangrove swamp at me. At
least a dozen were sticking into me. I started to run, but tripped over one
that was fast in my calf, and went down. The woolly-heads made a run for me,
each with a long-handled, fantail tomahawk with which to hack off my head. 
They were so eager for the prize that they got in one another's way. In the
confusion, I avoided several hacks by throwing myself right and left on the
sand.
<P>
Then Otoo arrived--Otoo the manhandler. In some way he had got hold of a heavy
war club, and at close quarters it was a far more efficient weapon than a
rifle. He was right in the thick of them, so that they could not spear him,
while their tomahawks seemed worse than useless. He was fighting for me, and
he was in a true Berserker rage. The way he handled that club was amazing.
<P>
Their skulls squashed like overripe oranges. It was not until he had driven
them back, picked me up in his arms, and started to run, that he received his
first wounds. He arrived in the boat with four spear thrusts, got his
Winchester, and with it got a man for every shot. Then we pulled aboard the
schooner, and doctored up.
<P>
Seventeen years we were together. He made me. I should today be a supercargo,
a recruiter, or a memory, if it had not been for him.
<P>
"You spend your money, and you go out and get more," he said one day. "It is
easy to get money now. But when you get old, your money will be spent, and you
will not be able to go out and get more. I know, master. I have studied the
way of white men. On the beaches are many old men who were young once, and who
could get money just like you. Now they are old, and they have nothing, and
they wait about for the young men like you to come ashore and buy drinks for
them.
<P>
"The black boy is a slave on the plantations. He gets twenty dollars a year.
He works hard. The overseer does not work hard.
<P>
He rides a horse and watches the black boy work. He gets twelve hundred
dollars a year. I am a sailor on the schooner. I get fifteen dollars a month.
That is because I am a good sailor. I work hard. The captain has a double
awning, and drinks beer out of long bottles. I have never seen him haul a rope
or pull an oar. He gets one hundred and fifty dollars a month. I am a sailor.
He is a navigator. 'master, I think it would be very good for you to know
navigation."
<P>
Otoo spurred me on to it. He sailed with me as second mate on my first
schooner, and he was far prouder of my command than I was myself. Later on it
was:
<P>
"The captain is well paid, master; but the ship is in his keeping, and he is
never free from the burden. It is the owner who is better paid--the owner who
sits ashore with many servants and turns his money over."
<P>
"True, but a schooner costs five thousand dollars--an old schooner at that," I
objected. "I should be an old man before I saved five thousand dollars."
<P>
"There be short ways for white men to make money," he went on, pointing ashore
at the cocoanut-fringed beach.
<P>
We were in the Solomons at the time, picking up a cargo of ivory nuts along
the east coast of Guadalcanar.
<P>
"Between this river mouth and the next it is two miles," he said.
<P>
"The flat land runs far back. It is worth nothing now. Next year--who
knows?--or the year after, men will pay much money for that land. The
anchorage is good. Big steamers can lie close up. You can buy the land four
miles deep from the old chief for ten thousand sticks of tobacco, ten bottles
of square-face, and a Snider, which will cost you, maybe, one hundred dollars.
Then you place the deed with the commissioner; and the next year, or the year
after, you sell and become the owner of a ship."
<P>
I followed his lead, and his words came true, though in three years, instead
of two. Next came the grasslands deal on Guadalcanar--twenty thousand acres,
on a governmental nine hundred and ninety-nine years' lease at a nominal sum.
I owned the lease for precisely ninety days, when I sold it to a company for
half a fortune. Always it was Otoo who looked ahead and saw the opportunity.
He was responsible for the salving of the Doncaster--bought in at auction for
a hundred pounds, and clearing three thousand after every expense was paid. He
led me into the Savaii plantation and the cocoa venture on Upolu.
<P>
We did not go seafaring so much as in the old days. I was too well off. I
married, and my standard of living rose; but Otoo remained the same old-time
Otoo, moving about the house or trailing through the office, his wooden pipe
in his mouth, a shilling undershirt on his back, and a four-shilling lava-lava
about his loins. I could not get him to spend money. There was no way of
repaying him except with love, and God knows he got that in full measure from
all of us. The children worshipped him; and if he had been spoilable, my wife
would surely have been his undoing.
<P>
The children! He really was the one who showed them the way of their feet in
the world practical. He began by teaching them to walk. He sat up with them
when they were sick. One by one, when they were scarcely toddlers, he took
them down to the lagoon, and made them into amphibians. He taught them more
than I ever knew of the habits of fish and the ways of catching them. In the
bush it was the same thing. At seven, Tom knew more woodcraft than I ever
dreamed existed. At six, Mary went over the Sliding Rock without a quiver, and
I have seen strong men balk at that feat.  And when Frank had just turned six
he could bring up shillings from the bottom in three fathoms.
<P>
"My people in Bora Bora do not like heathen--they are all Christians; and I do
not like Bora Bora Christians," he said one day, when I, with the idea of
getting him to spend some of the money that was rightfully his, had been
trying to persuade him to make a visit to his own island in one of our
schooners--a special voyage which I had hoped to make a record breaker in the
matter of prodigal expense.
<P>
I say one of OUR schooners, though legally at the time they belonged to me. I
struggled long with him to enter into partnership.
<P>
"We have been partners from the day the Petite Jeanne went down," he said at
last. "But if your heart so wishes, then shall we become partners by the law.
I have no work to do, yet are my expenses large. I drink and eat and smoke in
plenty--it costs much, I know. I do not pay for the playing of billiards, for
I play on your table; but still the money goes. Fishing on the reef is only a
rich man's pleasure. It is shocking, the cost of hooks and cotton line. Yes;
it is necessary that we be partners by the law. I need the money. I shall get
it from the head clerk in the office."
<P>
So the papers were made out and recorded. A year later I was compelled to
complain.
<P>
"Charley," said I, "you are a wicked old fraud, a miserly skinflint, a
miserable land crab. Behold, your share for the year in all our partnership
has been thousands of dollars. The head clerk has given me this paper. It says
that in the year you have drawn just eighty-seven dollars and twenty cents."
<P>
"Is there any owing me?" he asked anxiously.
<P>
"I tell you thousands and thousands," I answered.
<P>
His face brightened, as with an immense relief.
<P>
"It is well," he said. "See that the head clerk keeps good account of it. When
I want it, I shall want it, and there must not be a cent missing.
<P>
"If there is,:" he added fiercely, after a pause, "it must come out of the
clerk's wages."
<P>
And all the time, as I afterwards learned, his will, drawn up by Carruthers,
and making me sole beneficiary, lay in the American consul's safe.
<P>
But the end came, as the end must come to all human associations.
<P>
It occurred in the Solomons, where our wildest work had been done in the wild
young days, and where we were once more-- principally on a holiday,
incidentally to look after our holdings on Florida Island and to look over the
pearling possibilities of the Mboli Pass. We were lying at Savo, having run in
to trade for curios.
<P>
Now, Savo is alive with sharks. The custom of the woolly-heads of burying
their dead in the sea did not tend to discourage the sharks from making the
adjacent waters a hangout. It was my luck to be coming aboard in a tiny,
overloaded, native canoe, when the thing capsized. There were four
woolly-heads and myself in it, or rather, hanging to it. The schooner was a
hundred yards away.
<P>
I was just hailing for a boat when one of the woolly-heads began to scream.
Holding on to the end of the canoe, both he and that portion of the canoe were
dragged under several times. Then he loosed his clutch and disappeared. A
shark had got him.
<P>
The three remaining niggers tried to climb out of the water upon the bottom of
the canoe. I yelled and cursed and struck at the nearest with my fist, but it
was no use. They were in a blind funk. The canoe could barely have supported
one of them. Under the three it upended and rolled sidewise, throwing them
back into the water.
<P>
I abandoned the canoe and started to swim toward the schooner, expecting to be
picked up by the boat before I got there. One of the niggers elected to come
with me, and we swam along silently, side by side, now and again putting our
faces into the water and peering about for sharks. The screams of the man who
stayed by the canoe informed us that he was taken. I was peering into the
water when I saw a big shark pass directly beneath me. He was fully sixteen
feet in length. I saw the whole thing. He got the woolly-head by the middle,
and away he went, the poor devil, head, shoulders, and arms out of the water
all the time, screeching in a heart-rending way. He was carried along in this
fashion for several hundred feet, when he was dragged beneath the surface.
<P>
I swam doggedly on, hoping that that was the last unattached shark. But there
was another. Whether it was one that had attacked the natives earlier, or
whether it was one that had made a good meal elsewhere, I do not know. At any
rate, he was not in such haste as the others. I could not swim so rapidly now,
for a large part of my effort was devoted to keeping track of him. I was
watching him when he made his first attack. By good luck I got both hands on
his nose, and, though his momentum nearly shoved me under, I managed to keep
him off. He veered clear, and began circling about again. A second time I
escaped him by the same manoeuvre. The third rush was a miss on both sides. He
sheered at the moment my hands should have landed on his nose, but his
sandpaper hide (I had on a sleeveless undershirt) scraped the skin off one arm
from elbow to shoulder.
<P>
By this time I was played out, and gave up hope. The schooner was still two
hundred feet away. My face was in the water, and I was watching him manoeuvre
for another attempt, when I saw a brown body pass between us. It was Otoo.
<P>
"Swim for the schooner, master!" he said. And he spoke gayly, as though the
affair was a mere lark. "I know sharks. The shark is my brother."
<P>
I obeyed, swimming slowly on, while Otoo swam about me, keeping always between
me and the shark, foiling his rushes and encouraging me.
<P>
"The davit tackle carried away, and they are rigging the falls," he explained,
a minute or so later, and then went under to head off another attack.
<P>
By the time the schooner was thirty feet away I was about done for. I could
scarcely move. They were heaving lines at us from on board, but they
continually fell short. The shark, finding that it was receiving no hurt, had
become bolder. Several times it nearly got me, but each time Otoo was there
just the moment before it was too late. Of course, Otoo could have saved
himself any time. But he stuck by me.
<P>
"Good-by, Charley! I'm finished!" I just managed to gasp.
<P>
I knew that the end had come, and that the next moment I should throw up my
hands and go down.
<P>
But Otoo laughed in my face, saying:
<P>
"I will show you a new trick. I will make that shark feel sick!"
<P>
He dropped in behind me, where the shark was preparing to come at me.
<P>
"A little more to the left!" he next called out. "There is a line there on the
water. To the left, master--to the left!"
<P>
I changed my course and struck out blindly. I was by that time barely
conscious. As my hand closed on the line I heard an exclamation from on board.
I turned and looked. There was no sign of Otoo. The next instant he broke
surface. Both hands were off at the wrist, the stumps spouting blood.
<P>
"Otoo!" he called softly. And I could see in his gaze the love that thrilled
in his voice.
<P>
Then, and then only, at the very last of all our years, he called me by that
name.
<P>
"Good-by, Otoo!" he called.
<P>
Then he was dragged under, and I was hauled aboard, where I fainted in the
captain's arms.
<P>
And so passed Otoo, who saved me and made me a man, and who saved me in the
end. We met in the maw of a hurricane, and parted in the maw of a shark, with
seventeen intervening years of comradeship, the like of which I dare to assert
has never befallen two men, the one brown and the other white. If Jehovah be
from His high place watching every sparrow fall, not least in His kingdom
shall be Otoo, the one heathen of Bora Bora.
