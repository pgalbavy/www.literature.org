<p>(<em>EXTRACT FROM THE NOTE-BOOK OF JOSEPH ROULETABILLE</em>)</p>

<p>"Last night&mdash;the night between the 29th and 30th of October&mdash;"
wrote Joseph Rouletabille, "I woke up towards one o’clock in the
morning. Was it sleeplessness, or noise without? &mdash;The cry
of the Bete du Bon Dieu rang out with sinister loudness from the
end of the park. I rose and opened the window. Cold wind and rain;
opaque darkness; silence. I reclosed my window. Again the sound
of the cat’s weird cry in the distance. I partly dressed in haste.
The weather was too bad for even a cat to be turned out in it.
What did it mean, then&mdash;that imitating of the mewing of Mother
Angenoux’ cat so near the chateau? I seized a good-sized stick,
the only weapon I had, and, without making any noise, opened the
door.</p>

<p>"The gallery into which I went was well lit by a lamp with a
reflector. I felt a keen current of air and, on turning, found
the window open, at the extreme end of the gallery, which I call
the ‘off-turning’ gallery, to distinguish it from the ‘right’
gallery, on to which the apartment of Mademoiselle Stangerson
opened. These two galleries cross each other at right angles.
Who had left that window open? Or, who had come to open it? I
went to the window and leaned out. Five feet below me there was
a sort of terrace over the semi-circular projection of a room
on the ground-floor. One could, if one wanted, jump from the window
on to the terrace, and allow oneself to drop from it into the
court of the chateau. Whoever had entered by this road had, evidently,
not had a key to the vestibule door. But why should I be thinking
of my previous night’s attempt with the ladder? &mdash;Because
of the open window&mdash;left open, perhaps, by the negligence of a
servant? I reclosed it, smiling at the ease with which I built
a drama on the mere suggestion of an open window.</p>

<p>"Again the cry of the Bete du Bon Dieu!&mdash;and then silence. The
rain ceased to beat on the window. All in the chateau slept. I
walked with infinite precaution on the carpet of the gallery.
On reaching the corner of the ‘right’ gallery, I peered round
it cautiously. There was another lamp there with a reflector which
quite lit up the several objects in it,&mdash;three chairs and some
pictures hanging on the wall. What was I doing there? Perfect
silence reigned throughout. Everything was sunk in repose. What
was the instinct that urged me towards Mademoiselle Stangerson’s
chamber? Why did a voice within me cry: ‘Go on, to the chamber
of Mademoiselle Stangerson!’ I cast my eyes down upon the carpet
on which I was treading and saw that my steps were being directed
towards Mademoiselle Stangerson’s chamber by the marks of steps
that had already been made there. Yes, on the carpet were traces
of footsteps stained with mud leading to the chamber of Mademoiselle
Stangerson. Horror! Horror! &mdash;I recognised in those footprints
the impression of the neat boots of the murderer! He had come,
then, from without in this wretched night. If you could descend
from the gallery by way of the window, by means of the terrace,
then you could get into the chateau by the same means.</p>

<p>"The murderer was still in the chateau, for here were marks as
of returning footsteps. He had entered by the open window at the
extremity of the ‘off-turning’ gallery; he had passed Frederic
Larsan’s door and mine, had turned to the right, and had entered
Mademoiselle Stangerson’s room. I am before the door of her ante-room&mdash;it
is open. I push it, without making the least noise. Under the
door of the room itself I see a streak of light. I listen&mdash;no
sound&mdash;not even of breathing! Ah!&mdash;if I only knew what was passing
in the silence that is behind that door! I find the door locked
and the key turned on the inner side. And the murderer is there,
perhaps. He must be there! Will he escape this time?&mdash;All depends
on me! &mdash;I must be calm, and above all, I must make no false
steps. I must see into that room. I can enter it by Mademoiselle
Stangerson’s drawing-room; but, to do that I should have to cross
her boudoir; and while I am there, the murderer may escape by
the gallery door&mdash;the door in front of which I am now standing.</p>

<p>"I am sure that no other crime is being committed, on this night;
for there is complete silence in the boudoir, where two nurses
are taking care of Mademoiselle Stangerson until she is restored
to health.</p>

<p>"As I am almost sure that the murderer is there, why do I not
at once give the alarm? The murderer may, perhaps, escape; but,
perhaps, I may be able to save Mademoiselle Stangerson’s life.
Suppose the murderer on this occasion is not here to murder? The
door has been opened to allow him to enter; by whom? &mdash;And
it has been refastened&mdash;by whom? &mdash;Mademoiselle Stangerson
shuts herself up in her apartment with her nurses every night.
Who turned the key of that chamber to allow the murderer to enter?
&mdash;The nurses,&mdash;two faithful domestics? The old chambermaid,
Sylvia? It is very improbable. Besides, they slept in the boudoir,
and Mademoiselle Stangerson, very nervous and careful, Monsieur
Robert Darzac told me, sees to her own safety since she has been
well enough to move about in her room, which I have not yet seen
her leave. This nervousness and sudden care on her part, which
had struck Monsieur Darzac, had given me, also, food for thought.
At the time of the crime in "The Yellow Room", there can be no
doubt that she expected the murderer. Was he expected this night?
&mdash;Was it she herself who had opened her door to him? Had
she some reason for doing so? Was she obliged to do it?&mdash;Was it
a meeting for purposes of crime? &mdash;Certainly it was not a
lover’s meeting, for I believe Mademoiselle Stangerson adores
Monsieur Darzac.</p>

<p>"All these reflections ran through my brain like a flash of lightning.
What would I not give to know!</p>

<p>"It is possible that there was some reason for the awful silence.
My intervention might do more harm than good. How could I tell?
How could I know I might not any moment cause another crime? If
I could only see and know, without breaking that silence!</p>

<p>"I left the ante-room and descended the central stairs to the
vestibule and, as silently as possible, made my way to the little
room on the ground-floor where Daddy Jacques had been sleeping
since the attack made at the pavilion.</p>

<p>"I found him dressed, his eyes wide open, almost haggard. He
did not seem surprised to see me. He told me that he had got up
because he had heard the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu, and because
he had heard footsteps in the park, close to his window, out of
which he had looked and, just then, had seen a black shadow pass
by. I asked him whether he had a firearm of any kind. No, he no
longer kept one, since the examining magistrate had taken his
revolver from him. We went out together, by a little back door,
into the park, and stole along the chateau to the point which
is just below Mademoiselle Stangerson’s window.</p>

<p>"I placed Daddy Jacques against the wall, ordering him not to
stir from the spot, while I, taking advantage of a moment when
the moon was hidden by a cloud, moved to the front of the window,
out of the patch of light which came from it,&mdash;for the window
was half-open! If I could only know what was passing in that silent
chamber! I returned to Daddy Jacques and whispered the word ‘ladder’
in his ear. At first I had thought of the tree which, a week ago,
served me for an observatory; but I immediately saw that, from
the way the window was half-opened, I should not be able to see
from that point of view anything that was passing in the room;
and I wanted, not only to see, but to hear, and&mdash;to act.</p>

<p>"Greatly agitated, almost trembling, Daddy Jacques disappeared
for a moment and returned without the ladder, but making signs
to me with his arms, as signals to me to come quickly to him.
When I got near him he gasped: ‘Come!’</p>

<p>"He led me round the château, past the don-jon. Arrived there,
he said:</p>

<p>"‘I went to the donjon in search of my ladder, and in the lower
part of the donjon which serves me and the gardener for a lumber
room, I found the door open and the ladder gone. On coming out,
that’s what I caught sight of by the light of the moon.</p>

<p>"And he pointed to the further end of the chateau, where a ladder
stood resting against the stone brackets supporting the terrace,
under the window which I had found open. The projection of the
terrace had prevented my seeing it. Thanks to that ladder, it
was quite easy to get into the ‘off-turning’ gallery of the first
floor, and I had no doubt of it having been the road taken by
the unknown.</p>

<p>"We ran to the ladder, but at the moment of reaching it, Daddy
Jacques drew my attention to the half-open door of the little
semi-circular room, situated under the terrace, at the extremity
of the right wing of the chateau, having the terrace for its roof.
Daddy Jacques pushed the door open a little further and looked
in.</p>

<p>"‘He’s not there!" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Who is not there?"</p>

<p>"The forest&mdash;keeper."</p>

<p>With his lips once more to my ear, he added:</p>

<p>"‘Do you know that he has slept in the upper room of the donjon
ever since it was restored?’ And with the same gesture he pointed
to the half-open door, the ladder, the terrace, and the windows
in the ‘off-turning’ gallery which, a little while before, I had
re-closed.</p>

<p>"What were my thoughts then? I had no time to think. I felt more
than I thought.</p>

<p>"Evidently, I felt, if the forest-keeper is up there in the chamber
(I say, if, because at this moment, apart from the presence of
the ladder and his vacant room, there are no evidences which permit
me even to suspect him)&mdash;if he is there, he has been obliged to
pass by the ladder, and the rooms which lie behind his, in his
new lodging, are occupied by the family of the steward and by
the cook, and by the kitchens, which bar the way by the vestibule
to the interior of the chateau. And if he had been there during
the evening on any pretext, it would have been easy for him to
go into the gallery and see that the window could be simply pushed
open from the outside. This question of the unfastened window
easily narrowed the field of search for the murderer. He must
belong to the house, unless he had an accomplice, which I do not
believe he had; unless&mdash;unless Mademoiselle Stangerson herself
had seen that that window was not fastened from the inside. But,
then,&mdash;what could be the frightful secret which put her under
the necessity of doing away with obstacles that separated her
from the murderer?</p>

<p>"I seized hold of the ladder, and we returned to the back of
the chateau to see if the window of the chamber was still half-open.
The blind was drawn but did not join and allowed a bright stream
of light to escape and fall upon the path at our feet. I planted
the ladder under the window. I am almost sure that I made no noise;
and while Daddy Jacques remained at the foot of the ladder, I
mounted it, very quietly, my stout stick in my hand. I held my
breath and lifted my feet with the greatest care. Suddenly a heavy
cloud discharged itself at that moment in a fresh downpour of
rain.</p>

<p>"At the same instant the sinister cry of the Bete du bon Dieu
arrested me in my ascent. It seemed to me to have come from close
by me&mdash;only a few yards away. Was the cry a signal? &mdash;Had
some accomplice of the man seen me on the ladder! &mdash;Would
the cry bring the man to the window? &mdash;Perhaps! Ah, there
he was at the window! I felt his head above me. I heard the sound
of his breath! I could not look up towards him; the least movement
of my head, and &mdash;I might be lost. Would he see me? &mdash;Would
he peer into the darkness? No; he went away. He had seen nothing.
I felt, rather than heard, him moving on tip-toe in the room;
and I mounted a few steps higher. My head reached to the level
of the window-sill; my forehead rose above it; my eyes looked
between the opening in the blinds&mdash;and I saw &mdash;A man seated
at Mademoiselle Stangerson’s little desk, writing. His back was
turned toward me. A candle was lit before him, and he bent over
the flame, the light from it projecting shapeless shadows. I saw
nothing but a monstrous, stooping back.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Stangerson herself was not there! &mdash;Her bed
had not been lain on! Where, then, was she sleeping that night?
Doubtless in the side-room with her women. Perhaps this was but
a guess. I must content myself with the joy of finding the man
alone. I must be calm to prepare my trap.</p>

<p>"But who, then, is this man writing there before my eyes, seated
at the desk, as if he were in his own home? If there had not been
that ladder under the window; if there had not been those footprints
on the carpet in the gallery; if there had not been that open
window, I might have been led to think that this man had a right
to be there, and that he was there as a matter of course and for
reasons about which as yet I knew nothing. But there was no doubt
that this mysterious unknown was the man of "The Yellow Room",&mdash;the
man to whose murderous assault Mademoiselle Stangerson&mdash;without
denouncing him&mdash;had had to submit. If I could but see his face!
Surprise and capture him!</p>

<p>"If I spring into the room at this moment, he will escape by
the right-hand door opening into the boudoir,&mdash;or crossing the
drawing-room, he will reach the gallery and I shall lose him.
I have him now and in five minutes more he’ll be safer than if
I had him in a cage. &mdash;What is he doing there, alone in Mademoiselle
Stangerson’s room? &mdash;What is he writing? I descend and place
the ladder on the ground. Daddy Jacques follows me. We re-enter
the chateau. I send Daddy Jacques to wake Monsieur Stangerson,
and instruct him to await my coming in Mademoiselle Stangerson’s
room and to say nothing definite to him before my arrival. I will
go and awaken Frederic Larsan. It’s a bore to have to do it, for
I should have liked to work alone and to have carried off all
the honors of this affair myself, right under the very nose of
the sleeping detective. But Daddy Jacques and Monsieur Stangerson
are old men, and I am not yet fully developed. I might not be
strong enough. Larsan is used to wrestling and putting on the
handcuffs. He opened his eyes swollen with sleep, ready to send
me flying, without in the least believing in my reporter’s fancies.
I had to assure him that the man was there!</p>

<p>"‘That’s strange!’ he said; ‘I thought I left him this afternoon
in Paris.’</p>

<p>"He dressed himself in haste and armed himself with a revolver.
We stole quietly into the gallery.</p>

<p>"‘Where is he?’ Larsan asked.</p>

<p>"‘In Mademoiselle Stangerson’s room.</p>

<p>"‘And &mdash;Mademoiselle Stangerson?’</p>

<p>"‘She is not in there.’</p>

<p>"‘Let’s go in.’</p>

<p>"‘Don’t go there! On the least alarm the man will escape. He
has four ways by which to do it&mdash;the door, the window, the boudoir,
or the room in which the women are sleeping.’</p>

<p>"‘I’ll draw him from below.’</p>

<p>"‘And if you fail? &mdash;If you only succeed in wounding him&mdash;he’ll
escape again, without reckoning that he is certainly armed. No,
let me direct the expedition, and I’ll answer for everything.’</p>

<p>"‘As you like,’ he replied, with fairly good grace.</p>

<p>"Then, after satisfying myself that all the windows of the two
galleries were thoroughly secure, I placed Frederic Larsan at
the end of the ‘off-turning’ gallery, before the window which
I had found open and had reclosed.</p>

<p>"‘Under no consideration,’ I said to him, ‘must you stir from
this post till I call you. The chances are even that the man,
when he is pursued, will return to this window and try to save
himself that way; for it is by that way he came in and made a
way ready for his flight. You have a dangerous post.’</p>

<p>"‘What will be yours?’ asked Fred.</p>

<p>"‘I shall spring into the room and knock him over for you.’</p>

<p>"‘Take my revolver,’ said Fred, ‘and I’ll take your stick.’</p>

<p>"‘Thanks,’ I said; ‘You are a brave man.’</p>

<p>"I accepted his offer. I was going to be alone with the man in
the room writing and was really thankful to have the weapon.</p>

<p>"I left Fred, having posted him at the window (No. 5 on the plan),
and, with the greatest precaution, went towards Monsieur Stangerson’s
apartment in the left wing of the chateau. I found him with Daddy
Jacques, who had faithfully obeyed my directions, confining himself
to asking his master to dress as quickly as possible. In a few
words I explained to Monsieur Stangerson what was passing. He
armed himself with a revolver, followed me, and we were all three
speedily in the gallery. Since I had seen the murderer seated
at the desk ten minutes had elapsed. Monsieur Stangerson wished
to spring upon the assassin at once and kill him. I made him understand
that, above all, he must not, in his desire to kill him, miss
him.</p>

<p>"When I had sworn to him that his daughter was not in the room,
and in no danger, he conquered his impatience and left me to direct
the operations. I told them that they must come to me the moment
I called to them, or when I fired my revolver. I then sent Daddy
Jacques to place himself before the window at the end of the ‘right’
gallery. (No. 2 on my plan.) I chose that position ‘for Daddy
Jacques because I believed that the murderer, tracked, on leaving
the room, would run through the gallery towards the window which
he had left open, and, instantly seeing that it was guarded by
Larsan, would pursue his course along the ‘right’ gallery. There
he would encounter Daddy Jacques, who would prevent his springing
out of the window into the park. Under that window there was a
sort of buttress, while all the other windows in the galleries
were at such a height from the ground that it was almost impossible
to jump from them without breaking one’s neck. All the doors and
windows, including those of the lumber-room at the end of the
‘right’ gallery&mdash;as I had rapidly assured myself&mdash;were strongly
secured.</p>

<p>"Having indicated to Daddy Jacques the post he was to occupy,
and having seen him take up his position, I placed Monsieur Stangerson
on the landing at the head of the stairs not far from the door
of his daughter’s ante-room, rather than the boudoir, where the
women were, and the door of which must have been locked by Mademoiselle
Stangerson herself if, as I thought, she had taken refuge in the
boudoir for the purpose of avoiding the murderer who was coming
to see her. In any case, he must return to the gallery where my
people were awaiting him at every possible exit.</p>

<p>"On coming there, he would see on his left, Monsieur Stangerson;
he would turn to the right, towards the ‘off-turning’ gallery&mdash;the
way he had pre-arranged for flight, where, at the intersection
of the two galleries, he would see at once, as I have explained,
on his left, Frederic Larsan at the end of the ‘off-turning’ gallery,
and in front, Daddy Jacques, at the end of the ‘right’ gallery.
Monsieur Stangerson and myself would arrive by way of the back
of the chateau. &mdash;He is ours! &mdash;He can no longer escape
us! I was sure of that.</p>

<p>"The plan I had formed seemed to me the best, the surest, and
the most simple. It would, no doubt, have been simpler still,
if we had been able to place some one directly behind the door
of Mademoiselle’s boudoir, which opened out of her bedchamber,
and, in that way, had been in a position to besiege the two doors
of the room in which the man was. But we could not penetrate the
boudoir except by way of the drawing-room, the door of which had
been locked on the inside by Mademoiselle Stangerson. But even
if I had had the free disposition of the boudoir, I should have
held to the plan I had formed; because any other plan of attack
would have separated us at the moment of the struggle with the
man, while my plan united us all for the attack, at a spot which
I had selected with almost mathematical precision,&mdash;the intersection
of the two galleries.</p>

<p>"Having so placed my people, I again left the chateau, hurried
to my ladder, and, replacing it, climbed up, revolver in hand.</p>

<p>"If there be any inclined to smile at my taking so many precautionary
measures, I refer them to the mystery of "The Yellow Room", and
to all the proofs we have of the weird cunning of the murderer.
Further, if there be some who think my observations needlessly
minute at a moment when they ought to be completely held by rapidity
of movement and decision of action, I reply that I have wished
to report here, at length and completely, all the details of a
plan of attack conceived so rapidly that it is only the slowness
of my pen that gives an appearance of slowness to the execution.
I have wished, by this slowness and precision, to be certain that
nothing should be omitted from the conditions under which the
strange phenomenon was produced, which, until some natural explanation
of it is forthcoming, seems to me to prove, even better than the
theories of Professor Stangerson, the Dissociation of Matter &mdash;I
will even say, the instantaneous Dissociation of Matter."</p>
