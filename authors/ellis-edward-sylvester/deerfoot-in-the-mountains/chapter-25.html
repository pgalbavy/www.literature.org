<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The man was quick-witted. The words and the frenzied gestures
told a story which he understood. Standing close to the edge of
the stream, he peered into it and caught sight of a white face,
loosely flapping limbs and the helpless drift of a human being,
borne toward him with the speed of a race horse. The top of the
bank was so near the surface that the man dropped on his face,
so as to be able to reach forward and downward to the foaming
torrent.</p>

<p>He saw the body coming, and braced himself for the herculean
effort that would be necessary in the next breath. Reaching so
far that he was in danger of losing his own balance, he coolly
awaited the critical moment. Then his big hand closed like the
paw of a grizzly bear on the shoulder of Victor Shelton. A tremendous
wrench and he was dragged out and dropped limp and senseless at
the feet of his rescuer.</p>

<p>George Shelton saw this much, and, hardly knowing what he was
doing, made a desperate effort to leap the chasm, that he might
join the couple. But his foot slipped, too, and only by a superhuman
effort did he save himself from tumbling into the swirling wrath
of water. Scrambling to his feet, he sped downward to Victor and
the stranger. The latter showed his coolness by getting to work
without the least delay. Victor was senseless and had swallowed
a good deal of water. He seemed to be drowned.</p>

<p>The man held him by the heels and was standing him on his head.
Then he rolled him over and pressed his chest, with that oscillation
which is helpful in restoring seemingly drowned persons, while
the breathless George stood idly by watching everything with straining
eyes. He could do nothing but pray and hope.</p>

<p>At the end of a minute or two he saw, with joy unspeakable, the
signs of returning life. Victor was on his back, as if dead, when
he partly opened his eyes; but there was no expression in them.
His rescuer was scrutinizing the lad's face and noted the awakening
of consciousness. Straightening up, he said with a sigh:</p>

<p>"He's all right now; but he couldn't have come nigher pegging
out."</p>

<p>"You have saved him! You have saved him! Oh, how can I thank
you?"</p>

<p>And yielding to the reaction, George sobbed like a child. The
stranger looked at him without speaking, and gave his attention
again to the prostrate form. Victor speedily regained his senses,
and, with a little help from the man, sat up. He stared wonderingly
at his new friend and then at his brother, striving manfully to
master his emotions. With the waggery that cropped up at the most
unexpected times, he turned to George with the question:</p>

<p>"Are you crying because he saved my life?"</p>

<p>"I'm crying for joy. I had given up all hope."</p>

<p>"So had I. I tell you I came pretty near being a goner. Please
help me up."</p>

<p>George took his hand and almost lifted Victor to his feet. As
he came up he made a grimace, because of the pain that wrenched
him. He was so battered and bruised that the wonder was that several
bones had not been broken.</p>

<p>"Where's my rifle?" suddenly asked Victor, looking about him.</p>

<p>"In the bottom of the ca√±on, I reckon."</p>

<p>"Mebbe you'd like to make a dive for it," suggested the man.</p>

<p>"No, I've had enough of that. How shall I thank you for what
you have done?"</p>

<p>"By not saying anything about it. By a piece of good luck I happened
to be on the spot in time to give you a lift."</p>

<p>The boys now looked more closely at the Good Samaritan. He was
attired in the dress common among the trappers and hunters of
the Northwest in those days, and was a magnificent specimen of
physical manhood, being fully six feet in height, with a broad,
massive frame and an immense grizzled beard, which flowed over
his chest and covered his face almost to the eyes. He had laid
down his long, formidable rifle when he hurried to the rescue
of the boy, and he now stooped and picked up the weapon. Moving
back a few paces, so as to get beyond the noise made by the rushing
waters, he said, in his gruff but not unpleasant voice:</p>

<p>"Tell me how this thing happened."</p>

<p>George briefly gave the particulars of the mishap, to which the
man silently listened.</p>

<p>"You ain't the only younker or man either who has lost all by
a little slip. The next time you want to make a big jump be sure
of your footing. What are you two chaps doing in this part of
the world?"</p>

<p>"We have been across the continent, almost to the Pacific, and
are now on the way to our home in Ohio."</p>

<p>"You ain't traveling alone, are you?"</p>

<p>"No; we have a companion, who is off somewhere in the mountains,
but will soon join us in camp."</p>

<p>"'Pears to me you've been on a powerful long tramp."</p>

<p>"We have. We spent last winter among the Blackfeet, and are homesick."</p>

<p>"I reckon your camp ain't fur off, and we may as well go there."</p>

<p>"We shall be glad to have you with us, for you have proved the
best of friends."</p>

<p>"Thar! Thar! Drop that; talk about something else."</p>

<p>When Victor tried to walk he had to lean on the shoulder of his
brother, and the pain from his bruises compelled him at times
to stop and rest. The burly trapper offered to help, but Victor
thanked him and got on quite well with the assistance of George.
The man walked a few paces behind the two, that he might not hurry
them too much, and because it belonged to the boys to act as guide.</p>

<p>"Who is the man you've got with you?"</p>

<p>"He is a young Shawanoe Indian named Deerfoot," replied George
Shelton.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the trapper, stopping as if shot. "Do you mean
that handsome young warrior who went through the country below
us last summer with a Blackfoot redskin and two younkers?"</p>

<p>"The same. We are the boys that were with him."</p>

<p>"Wal, I'll be skulped!" added the other, as if he could not do
justice to his feelings. "I never dreamed of anything like <em>that</em>."</p>

<p>"Like what?" asked George.</p>

<p>"Seeing that Shawanoe agin. Say, he's a great one, ain't he?"</p>

<p>"You know him, then?"</p>

<p>"Wal, I reckon. He done me the greatest favor of my life&mdash;greater
than what I done that chap of yourn a little while ago."</p>

<p>"I don't see how that can be," remarked the limping Victor; "but
Deerfoot is always doing good to others."</p>

<p>"Didn't he ever tell you anything about me?"</p>

<p>"You haven't told us your name."</p>

<p>"I'm Jack Halloway."</p>

<p>The boys agreed that they had never heard the Shawanoe mention
him by name. Victor added:</p>

<p>"He is the last one to speak of his good deeds, and he doesn't
like to hear anyone else speak of them."</p>

<p>"He'll hear some one talk when I see him," chuckled the trapper,
with a shaking of his herculean shoulders.</p>

<p>Because of Victor's hurts the descent among the foothills to
camp took a long time, and the afternoon was well gone when the
three reached headquarters. While a little way off the three caught
sight of the Shawanoe, who had started a fire and was broiling
buffalo steak for supper. He looked with surprise at the sight
of Victor leaning on the shoulder of his brother and walking with
difficulty, and at the towering form behind them. Ceasing his
work, he came forward to greet the party. He paid no attention
to the man until George Shelton told of the mishap in which the
life of Victor was saved by the person behind them.</p>

<p>During this brief interchange the trapper kept in the background,
with his eyes on the Shawanoe. Needless to say, Deerfoot had recognized
him at the first glance. Not suspecting this, the man now came
forward, the moving of the beard about his mouth showing that
he was grinning and chuckling.</p>

<p>"I reckon you don't remember me, Deerfoot."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot could never forget his brother, Jack Halloway," replied
the youth, extending his hand, which was warmly grasped by the
trapper.</p>

<p>"I'm powerful glad to meet you agin, Shawanoe, though I hadn't
much hope of ever doing so. Talk about friends, you beat 'em all,
and I'll be skulped if you don't look handsomer than ever&mdash;no
you don't, for that couldn't be. Shake agin, pardner."</p>

<p>Deerfoot was as pleased to meet his old acquaintance as the latter
was to see him. All seated themselves on the ground about the
blaze, and as night had not yet come the meal was deferred until
more was learned of what had taken place during the interval between
the former meeting and the present coming together.</p>

<p>"Why is my brother in the mountains at this season of the year?"
asked Deerfoot, when the trapper had lit his pipe.</p>

<p>Of course cold weather is the time for trapping fur-bearing animals.
The custom in the olden days was for the hunters to go into the
mountains in the autumn, spend the time until spring in gathering
peltries, and then bring them to civilization for sale. It was
now summer, and it was not to be supposed that Jack Halloway was
engaged on professional business in the Laramie Mountains. He
explained:</p>

<p>"Last fall I took a partner &mdash;Dick Burley by name&mdash;and we
put in the winter among the beaver runs and mountains over to
the northwest. We done so poor that I let Dick start with the
pack animals for St. Louis, without me going with him. He hadn't
more than half a load, and we made up our minds that we'd got
to find new trapping grounds or we shouldn't make enough to pay
for our salt. So me and Dick parted and I've been on the tramp
for two months."</p>

<p>"How did you make out?" asked Victor, who, having found an easy
position for his aching body, felt it his duty to join in the
discussion.</p>

<p>"I hit it when I came to this part of the country. A few miles
south are hundreds of beaver, foxes, otter and other critters
whose furs we're after. I don't think a single one of 'em has
ever been trapped. There's where me and Dick will try it next
fall."</p>

<p>"Then you will soon go home?"</p>

<p>"I intended to start to-morrow. My horse is a little way back
among the foothills, stuffing himself with enough grass to last
him a week."</p>

<p>"My brother will go with us," said the pleased Deerfoot.</p>

<p>"If you don't feel too proud to have me for company, I'll be
mighty glad to go with you."</p>

<p>"Nothing will suit us better," said George, heartily. It was
natural that he and Victor should feel profoundly grateful to
the trapper. Even had he not done them so measureless a service
they would have liked him from the first.</p>

<p>It was not until the night had fully come, the evening meal eaten
and the fire replenished, though the weather remained mild, that
a full interchange took place among the different members of the
little party. Victor suffered less from his bruises, and with
his blanket wrapped about his shoulders showed no effects from
his terrifying adventure. The horses were left to themselves,
Jack Halloway saying that no attention need be given to his, despite
the possibility of some thieving Indian making off with him. The
trapper expressed unbounded admiration of Whirlwind, and could
not understand how Deerfoot had ever gained such a piece of property.
George and Victor did not dare to explain in the presence of the
Shawanoe, but each determined to do so on the first opportunity,
despite the risk of another "disciplining" at the hands of the
modest youth.</p>

<p>After Jack had smoked awhile and the chat had gone on without
any special point, he turned to the Shawanoe and said:</p>

<p>"I've seen you stealing a look at me now and then and I know
what you done it for."</p>

<p>"Yes, Deerfoot did so; but my brother cannot tell the reason."</p>

<p>"You've been trying to find out from my looks whether I've stuck
to the pledge I made you a year ago to give up drinking whiskey."</p>

<p>"That was the reason; Deerfoot was almost but not quite certain."</p>

<p>"Have you any doubts left?"</p>

<p>The Shawanoe smiled.</p>

<p>"Only a shadow."</p>

<p>"Wal, you can kick that shadow out of sight! I haven't drank
a drop of the stuff since that night, a year ago, when I flung
my flask into the creek, after hearing your sermon, that shook
me down to my toes."</p>

<p>Deerfoot leaned over and offered his hand again to happy Jack
Halloway, who turned to the boys.</p>

<p>"Being as he never told you, I might as well give you the story."</p>

<p>Thereupon the trapper related in his characteristic fashion the
incident of which you heard long ago. The eyes of the boys kindled
and Victor said:</p>

<p>"That is only one of a hundred things Deerfoot has done."</p>

<p>Catching a warning look from the Shawanoe, Victor said in desperation:</p>

<p>"I'm not going to try to give a list, Deerfoot, but won't you
let me tell Jack how you whipped the greatest war chief of the
Blackfeet and how he became a Christian?"</p>

<p>"There is no need of that, but my brothers may tell what happened
to them when they disobeyed Deerfoot."</p>

<p>"I'll do that if you don't shut down on the other story."</p>

<p>The Shawanoe would have refused, but the trapper's curiosity
had been stirred and he insisted upon hearing of the incident.
As a compromise the Indian youth rose to his feet and sauntered
out to where Whirlwind was still cropping the juicy herbage. He
would not stay and listen to what he knew was about to be said.
The boys were glad to have him absent, for it left them free to
speak what they pleased, and you may be sure that Victor and George
did not mince matters. Their account of that remarkable combat
and its results was told with graphic eloquence. Then George added
the story of Deerfoot's encounter with the grizzly bear and his
defeat of the Assiniboine, whose life he spared. Inasmuch as the
boys had never been able to draw the particulars of that combat
from Deerfoot, Victor had to embellish it with his own imagination,
and he did it to perfection. He was in the midst of a description
of how the Shawanoe beat the best marksmen, runners and leapers
of the Blackfeet when Deerfoot came back to the camp fire.</p>

<p>"Now let my brothers tell of what happened to them when Deerfoot
was through with Taggarak."</p>

<p>"You needn't worry; I didn't forget that. Well, Jack, you see
Deerfoot forbade me and George to come anywhere near, but we couldn't
stay away. He found it out, cut a big gad and splintered it over
our shoulders and we couldn't help ourselves."</p>

<p>And then Jack Halloway threw back his head and roared with laughter,
declaring that he had never heard so good a story.</p>
