<p>The maple-bordered street was as still as a country Sunday; so
quiet that there seemed an echo to my footsteps. It was four o'clock
in the morning; clear October moonlight misted through the thinning
foliage to the shadowy sidewalk and lay like a transparent silver
fog upon the house of my admiration, as I strode along, returning
from my first night's work on the "Wainwright Morning Despatch."</p>

<p>I had already marked that house as the finest (to my taste) in
Wainwright, though hitherto, on my excursions to this metropolis,
the state capital, I was not without a certain native jealousy
that Spencerville, the county-seat where I lived, had nothing
so good. Now, however, I approached its purlieus with a pleasure
in it quite unalloyed, for I was at last myself a resident (albeit
of only one day's standing) of Wainwright, and the house&mdash;though
I had not even an idea who lived there&mdash;part of my possessions
as a citizen. Moreover, I might enjoy the warmer pride of a next-door-neighbor,
for Mrs. Apperthwaite's, where I had taken a room, was just beyond.</p>

<p>This was the quietest part of Wainwright; business stopped short
of it, and the "fashionable residence section" had overleaped
this "forgotten backwater," leaving it undisturbed and unchanging,
with that look about it which is the quality of few urban quarters,
and eventually of none, as a town grows to be a city&mdash;the look
of still being a neighborhood. This friendliness of appearance
was largely the emanation of the homely and beautiful house which
so greatly pleased my fancy.</p>

<p>It might be difficult to say why I thought it the "finest" house
in Wainwright, for a simpler structure would be hard to imagine;
it was merely a big, old-fashioned brick house, painted brown
and very plain, set well away from the street among some splendid
forest trees, with a fair spread of flat lawn. But it gave back
a great deal for your glance, just as some people do. It was a
large house, as I say, yet it looked not like a mansion but like
a home; and made you wish that you lived in it. Or, driving by,
of an evening, you would have liked to hitch your horse and go
in; it spoke so surely of hearty, old-fashioned people living
there, who would welcome you merrily.</p>

<p>It looked like a house where there were a grandfather and a grandmother;
where holidays were warmly kept; where there were boisterous family
reunions to which uncles and aunts, who had been born there, would
return from no matter what distances; a house where big turkeys
would be on the table often; where one called "the hired man"
(and named either Abner or Ole) would crack walnuts upon a flat-iron
clutched between his knees on the back porch; it looked like a
house where they played charades; where there would be long streamers
of evergreen and dozens of wreaths of holly at Christmas-time;
where there were tearful, happy weddings and great throwings of
rice after little brides, from the broad front steps: in a word,
it was the sort of a house to make the hearts of spinsters and
bachelors very lonely and wistful&mdash;and that is about as near as
I can come to my reason for thinking it the finest house in Wainwright.</p>

<p>The moon hung kindly above its level roof in the silence of that
October morning, as I checked my gait to loiter along the picket
fence; but suddenly the house showed a light of its own. The spurt
of a match took my eye to one of the upper windows, then a steadier
glow of orange told me that a lamp was lighted. The window was
opened, and a man looked out and whistled loudly.</p>

<p>I stopped, thinking that he meant to attract my attention; that
something might be wrong; that perhaps some one was needed to
go for a doctor. My mistake was immediately evident, however;
I stood in the shadow of the trees bordering the sidewalk, and
the man at the window had not seen me.</p>

<p>"Boy! Boy!" he called, softly. "Where are you, Simpledoria?"</p>

<p>He leaned from the window, looking downward. "Why, <em>THERE
</em>you are!" he exclaimed, and turned to address some invisible
person within the room. "He's right there, underneath the window.
I'll bring him up." He leaned out again. "Wait there, Simpledoria!"
he called. "I'll be down in a jiffy and let you in."</p>

<p>Puzzled, I stared at the vacant lawn before me. The clear moonlight
revealed it brightly, and it was empty of any living presence;
there were no bushes nor shrubberies&mdash;nor even shadows&mdash;that could
have been mistaken for a boy, if "Simpledoria" <em>WAS </em>a
boy. There was no dog in sight; there was no cat; there was nothing
beneath the window except thick, close-cropped grass.</p>

<p>A light shone in the hallway behind the broad front doors; one
of these was opened, and revealed in silhouette the tall, thin
figure of a man in a long, old-fashioned dressing-gown.</p>

<p>"Simpledoria," he said, addressing the night air with considerable
severity, "I don't know what to make of you. You might have caught
your death of cold, roving out at such an hour. But there," he
continued, more indulgently; "wipe your feet on the mat and come
in. You're safe <em>NOW</em>!"</p>

<p>He closed the door, and I heard him call to some one up-stairs,
as he rearranged the fastenings:</p>

<p>"Simpledoria is all right&mdash;only a little chilled. I'll bring
him up to your fire."</p>

<p>I went on my way in a condition of astonishment that engendered,
almost, a doubt of my eyes; for if my sight was unimpaired and
myself not subject to optical or mental delusion, neither boy
nor dog nor bird nor cat, nor any other object of this visible
world, had entered that opened door. Was my "finest" house, then,
a place of call for wandering ghosts, who came home to roost at
four in the morning?</p>

<p>It was only a step to Mrs. Apperthwaite's; I let myself in with
the key that good lady had given me, stole up to my room, went
to my window, and stared across the yard at the house next door.
The front window in the second story, I decided, necessarily belonged
to that room in which the lamp had been lighted; but all was dark
there now. I went to bed, and dreamed that I was out at sea in
a fog, having embarked on a transparent vessel whose preposterous
name, inscribed upon glass life-belts, depending here and there
from an invisible rail, was <em>SIMPLEDORIA</em>.</p>
