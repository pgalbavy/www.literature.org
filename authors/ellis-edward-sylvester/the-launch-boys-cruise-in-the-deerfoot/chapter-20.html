<p>Through the soft, impenetrable darkness stole the almost inaudible
sound of a paddle, and strangely enough, only a single stroke
was heard. The listening youths agreed that the point whence it
came was to the north of the islet, and it was Chester Haynes
who was keen witted enough to hit upon the explanation.</p>

<p>"Whoever it is he is trying not to betray himself; he is using
his oar as a paddle, to avoid the sound of rowing."</p>

<p>"But <em>we</em> heard him," said Alvin.</p>

<p>"He made a slight slip and may do it again."</p>

<p>They listened intently for several minutes, but the stillness
was unbroken. This continued for some time, when suddenly the
sound was heard, fainter than before&mdash;so faintly indeed that had
not the two been closely attentive they would not have noted it.</p>

<p>"Another slip," remarked Chester; "I guess he doesn't know how
to handle a paddle very well. But he has got ahead, for he isn't
where he was when we first heard him."</p>

<p>"He seems to be between us and the islet."</p>

<p>"He may be coming this way!"</p>

<p>As if in answer to the thought, the few rays of moonlight which
fell upon the water at that moment revealed the dim outlines of
a small boat that was heading toward the very spot where the friends
were standing.</p>

<p>"Let's make a change of base," whispered Chester, hastily turning
to the north, but halting where they could see the boat without
being visible themselves.</p>

<p>With the weak light, they could trace it quite clearly. The craft
was of the ordinary structure, so small that it would not have
carried more than two or three persons, and had nothing in the
nature of a sail.</p>

<p>A man was seated in the middle holding a single paddle which
he swayed first on one side and then on the other. The observers
suspected his identity before the nose of the little boat slid
up the bank and it came to rest. Gently laying down the paddle,
as if guarding against discovery, the man rose to his feet and
stepped out. As he did so, he grasped a small handbag in one hand
and moved with the alert nimbleness of a boy. He was the man in
the gray suit, who seemed to have formed the habit of intruding
into the plans of Alvin and Chester. They waited motionless and
silent until he disappeared in the wood.</p>

<p>"Chester," said his friend, "I'll give you eleven cents if you
will explain that."</p>

<p>"And I'll give you twelve if you'll clear it up for me."</p>

<p>"I wonder now if he isn't acting as a sentinel for the others.
He knows we are somewhere in the neighborhood and has set out
to keep track of us."</p>

<p>The theory might seem reasonable to the boys, but would not hold
water, for, after all, the action of the stranger did not agree
with it. They felt it idle to try to guess, and gave it up. Alvin
had proposed that they should stay no longer in the wood, but
return to the hospitable home of Uncle Ben. Though it would be
late when they reached there, they would be welcome, but both
shrank from meeting the couple after the discovery of the money
they had placed under their plates.</p>

<p>"Hold on, Alvin," whispered the other; "let's play a trick on
that fellow that keeps nosing into our business."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Let's use his boat to get a closer view of the <em>Deerfoot</em>."</p>

<p>It was a rash thing to do, but it appealed to the young Captain.</p>

<p>"All right; I'm with you. We must hurry, for he is likely to
come back any moment."</p>

<p>Had they taken time for reflection, they probably would have
given up the plan, but boys of their age and younger are not apt
to "look before they leap." Without hesitation, they walked to
where the frail boat lay against the bank and Alvin shoved it
clear. The water seemed to be deep close to land, and the Captain
took up the paddle, remarking that the craft bore some resemblance
to a canoe. They half expected that the man would dash forward
and call them to account, but nothing was seen or heard of him,
and the gloom swallowed them from sight of any person on land.</p>

<p>Now that the chance was theirs to settle the question which had
perplexed them so long it was important to consider each step.
Alvin had had experience in managing a small boat and he handled
the paddle with more skill than the former occupant, for the ripple
which he caused could not have been heard a dozen feet away. As
the distance from shore increased, they ceased to whisper. One
knew the right thing to do as well as the other, and Chester realized
that he could give no directions of value.</p>

<p>It seemed to Alvin that since those on the launch knew the direction
taken by one of their number, they would expect him to return
over the same course. Instead, therefore, of making straight for
the motor boat, the Captain turned to the right, so as to approach
the bow or stern. Before he caught sight of the craft, he made
a complete circuit of the islet, keeping just near enough to trace
its outlines and that of the launch. The former was merely a mass
of sand, consisting of about an acre and without a tree or shrub
upon it. It must have been nearly submerged when the tide was
high.</p>

<p>Seated in the prow of the small boat, Chester Haynes peered with
all the power of eyesight at his command into the darkness, partly
lighted up now and then by the moon. This made the illumination
treacherous and uncertain and caused misgivings to both. Alvin
glanced up at the rolling clouds, striving to avoid betraying
himself to anyone on board. The presumption was that all had gone
to sleep, leaving the duty of protection to their friend, the
man in gray.</p>

<p>A look at the masses of vapor in the sky told Alvin that the
heavy obscurity would last for several minutes. He dipped the
paddle deeper and stole toward the bow of the launch that was
beginning to show vaguely. By and by he saw the sharp cutwater
rising several feet above the water, the staff with its drooping
flag, and the glass shield just aft of the motor compartment.</p>

<p>"Sh! sh! back quick!"</p>

<p>Chester whispered the warning, and Alvin without pausing to ask
the reason swung the paddle so powerfully that the gentle forward
motion was checked, and the boat moved in the other direction.
Two or three strokes carried it so far that the launch and all
pertaining to it were swallowed up in the gloom.</p>

<p>Waiting till it was safe to speak, the Captain asked:</p>

<p>"What did you see, Chester?"</p>

<p>"A man," was the reply.</p>

<p>"In what part of the launch?"</p>

<p>"He was standing in front of the cockpit, about half way between
it and the flagstaff."</p>

<p>"Then he saw us."</p>

<p>"No; for he was looking toward the shore to which this boat had
gone. Had he turned his head, he must have noticed us."</p>

<p>Alvin held the reverse motion until they felt it safe to talk
without dropping into whispers.</p>

<p>"What harm could have come if he had seen us?" asked the Captain,
"I favor going straight up to the <em>Deerfoot</em>, stepping
aboard and ordering the thieves to turn her over to us."</p>

<p>"Before doing so, one thing ought to be settled."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Find out whether it <em>is</em> the <em>Deerfoot</em>."</p>

<p>"Of course it is; what other boat could it be? We act as if we
were afraid to claim our own property."</p>

<p>"<em>Your</em> property you mean, Captain. If I may advise, it
is that you make another circuit around the islet and come up
to the launch from the rear. I don't think there is a second man
on watch, and, if there isn't, we shall be less likely to attract
the first one's notice."</p>

<p>"I'll do as you say, though I see no sense in it."</p>

<p>With the utmost care the islet was circumnavigated as before,
and the stealthy approach from the rear was made. Alvin depended
upon his companion to give him warning, and while he remained
silent the small boat glided forward like a shadow cast by the
moon.</p>

<p>The man who had been seen standing near the prow would have been
in sight had he held his position, and since he was invisible,
he must have gone away. With the acme of caution, Alvin stole
along the side of the launch, keeping just far enough off to avoid
grazing her, until he came once more to the bow.</p>

<p>This period being one of the total eclipses of the moon, he could
do no more than trace the outlines of the boat, whose familiar
appearance filled him with burning indignation that thieves should
have dared to lay hands upon it. There was not a breath of air
stirring, and Chester who still clung to his doubts, now drew
his rubber safe from his pocket and scratched a match over the
corrugated bottom. As the tiny flame flickered, he held it up
in front of the gilt letters on the side of the prow. Each saw
them plainly, long enough to note that the name painted there
was not <em>Deerfoot</em> but <em>Water Witch</em>!</p>

<p>Alvin was astounded and disgusted beyond expression. Without
a word, he turned the head of the little boat toward the shore
which they had left a short time before, and did not speak until
they reached land. He was impatient, because he plainly heard
his companion chuckling.</p>

<p>"Let's give up looking for the <em>Deerfoot</em>," exclaimed
the Captain, "and see whether we can find Mike Murphy."</p>

<p>"I'm with you," was the hearty response of Chester.</p>

<p>Indeed it is high time that we, too, started upon the same errand.</p>
