<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The evening before, I had sent my automobile to Rouen by the
highway. I was to travel to Rouen by rail, on my way to visit
some friends that live on the banks of the Seine.</p>

<p>At Paris, a few minutes before the train started, seven gentlemen
entered my compartment; five of them were smoking. No matter that
the journey was a short one, the thought of traveling with such
a company was not agreeable to me, especially as the car was built
on the old model, without a corridor. I picked up my overcoat,
my newspapers and my time-table, and sought refuge in a neighboring
compartment.</p>

<p>It was occupied by a lady, who, at sight of me, made a gesture
of annoyance that did not escape my notice, and she leaned toward
a gentleman who was standing on the step and was, no doubt, her
husband. The gentleman scrutinized me closely, and, apparently,
my appearance did not displease him, for he smiled as he spoke
to his wife with the air of one who reassures a frightened child.
She smiled also, and gave me a friendly glance as if she now understood
that I was one of those gallant men with whom a woman can remain
shut up for two hours in a little box, six feet square, and have
nothing to fear.</p>

<p>Her husband said to her:</p>

<p>"I have an important appointment, my dear, and cannot wait any
longer. Adieu."</p>

<p>He kissed her affectionately and went away. His wife threw him
a few kisses and waved her handkerchief. The whistle sounded,
and the train started.</p>

<p>At that precise moment, and despite the protests of the guards,
the door was opened, and a man rushed into our compartment. My
companion, who was standing and arranging her luggage, uttered
a cry of terror and fell upon the seat. I am not a coward&mdash;far
from it&mdash;but I confess that such intrusions at the last minute
are always disconcerting. They have a suspicious, unnatural aspect.</p>

<p>However, the appearance of the new arrival greatly modified the
unfavorable impression produced by his precipitant action. He
was correctly and elegantly dressed, wore a tasteful cravat, correct
gloves, and his face was refined and intelligent. But, where the
devil had I seen that face before? Because, beyond all possible
doubt, I had seen it. And yet the memory of it was so vague and
indistinct that I felt it would be useless to try to recall it
at that time.</p>

<p>Then, directing my attention to the lady, I was amazed at the
pallor and anxiety I saw in her face. She was looking at her neighbor&mdash;they
occupied seats on the same side of the compartment&mdash;with an expression
of intense alarm, and I perceived that one of her trembling hands
was slowly gliding toward a little traveling bag that was lying
on the seat about twenty inches from her. She finished by seizing
it and nervously drawing it to her. Our eyes met, and I read in
hers so much anxiety and fear that I could not refrain from speaking
to her:</p>

<p>"Are you ill, madame? Shall I open the window?"</p>

<p>Her only reply was a gesture indicating that she was afraid of
our companion. I smiled, as her husband had done, shrugged my
shoulders, and explained to her, in pantomime, that she had nothing
to fear, that I was there, and, besides, the gentleman appeared
to be a very harmless individual. At that moment, he turned toward
us, scrutinized both of us from head to foot, then settled down
in his corner and paid us no more attention.</p>

<p>After a short silence, the lady, as if she had mustered all her
energy to perform a desperate act, said to me, in an almost inaudible
voice:</p>

<p>"Do you know who is on our train?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"He.... he....I assure you...."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Arsène Lupin!"</p>

<p>She had not taken her eyes off our companion, and it was to him
rather than to me that she uttered the syllables of that disquieting
name. He drew his hat over his face. Was that to conceal his agitation
or, simply, to arrange himself for sleep? Then I said to her:</p>

<p>"Yesterday, through contumacy, Arsène Lupin was sentenced to
twenty years’ imprisonment at hard labor. Therefore it is improbable
that he would be so imprudent, to-day, as to show himself in public.
Moreover, the newspapers have announced his appearance in Turkey
since his escape from the Santé."</p>

<p>"But he is on this train at the present moment," the lady proclaimed,
with the obvious intention of being heard by our companion; "my
husband is one of the directors in the penitentiary service, and
it was the stationmaster himself who told us that a search was
being made for Arsène Lupin."</p>

<p>"They may have been mistaken&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No; he was seen in the waiting-room. He bought a first-class
ticket for Rouen."</p>

<p>"He has disappeared. The guard at the waiting-room door did not
see him pass, and it is supposed that he had got into the express
that leaves ten minutes after us."</p>

<p>"In that case, they will be sure to catch him."</p>

<p>"Unless, at the last moment, he leaped from that train to come
here, into our train.... which is quite probable.... which is
almost certain."</p>

<p>"If so, he will be arrested just the same; for the employees
and guards would no doubt observe his passage from one train to
the other, and, when we arrive at Rouen, they will arrest him
there."</p>

<p>"Him&mdash;never! He will find some means of escape."</p>

<p>"In that case, I wish him ‘bon voyage.’"</p>

<p>"But, in the meantime, think what he may do!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know. He may do anything."</p>

<p>She was greatly agitated, and, truly, the situation justified,
to some extent, her nervous excitement. I was impelled to say
to her:</p>

<p>"Of course, there are many strange coincidences, but you need
have no fear. Admitting that Arsène Lupin is on this train, he
will not commit any indiscretion; he will be only too happy to
escape the peril that already threatens him."</p>

<p>My words did not reassure her, but she remained silent for a
time. I unfolded my newspapers and read reports of Arsène Lupin’s
trial, but, as they contained nothing that was new to me, I was
not greatly interested. Moreover, I was tired and sleepy. I felt
my eyelids close and my head drop.</p>

<p>"But, monsieur, you are not going to sleep!"</p>

<p>She seized my newspaper, and looked at me with indignation.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," I said.</p>

<p>"That would be very imprudent."</p>

<p>"Of course," I assented.</p>

<p>I struggled to keep awake. I looked through the window at the
landscape and the fleeting clouds, but in a short time all that
became confused and indistinct; the image of the nervous lady
and the drowsy gentleman were effaced from my memory, and I was
buried in the soothing depths of a profound sleep. The tranquility
of my response was soon disturbed by disquieting dreams, wherein
a creature that had played the part and bore the name of Arsène
Lupin held an important place. He appeared to me with his back
laden with articles of value; he leaped over walls, and plundered
castles. But the outlines of that creature, who was no longer
Arsène Lupin, assumed a more definite form. He came toward me,
growing larger and larger, leaped into the compartment with incredible
agility, and landed squarely on my chest. With a cry of fright
and pain, I awoke. The man, the traveller, our companion, with
his knee on my breast, held me by the throat.</p>

<p>My sight was very indistinct, for my eyes were suffused with
blood. I could see the lady, in a corner of the compartment, convulsed
with fright. I tried even not to resist. Besides, I did not have
the strength. My temples throbbed; I was almost strangled. One
minute more, and I would have breathed my last. The man must have
realized it, for he relaxed his grip, but did not remove his hand.
Then he took a cord, in which he had prepared a slip-knot, and
tied my wrists together. In an instant, I was bound, gagged, and
helpless.</p>

<p>Certainly, he accomplished the trick with an ease and skill that
revealed the hand of a master; he was, no doubt, a professional
thief. Not a word, not a nervous movement; only coolness and audacity.
And I was there, lying on the bench, bound like a mummy, I &mdash;Arsène
Lupin!</p>

<p>It was anything but a laughing matter, and yet, despite the gravity
of the situation, I keenly appreciated the humor and irony that
it involved. Arsène Lupin seized and bound like a novice! robbed
as if I were an unsophisticated rustic&mdash;for, you must understand,
the scoundrel had deprived me of my purse and wallet! Arsène Lupin,
a victim, duped, vanquished....What an adventure!</p>

<p>The lady did not move. He did not even notice her. He contented
himself with picking up her traveling-bag that had fallen to the
floor and taking from it the jewels, purse, and gold and silver
trinkets that it contained. The lady opened her eyes, trembled
with fear, drew the rings from her fingers and handed them to
the man as if she wished to spare him unnecessary trouble. He
took the rings and looked at her. She swooned.</p>

<p>Then, quite unruffled, he resumed his seat, lighted a cigarette,
and proceeded to examine the treasure that he had acquired. The
examination appeared to give him perfect satisfaction.</p>

<p>But I was not so well satisfied. I do not speak of the twelve
thousand francs of which I had been unduly deprived: that was
only a temporary loss, because I was certain that I would recover
possession of that money after a very brief delay, together with
the important papers contained in my wallet: plans, specifications,
addresses, lists of correspondents, and compromising letters.
But, for the moment, a more immediate and more serious question
troubled me: How would this affair end? What would be the outcome
of this adventure?</p>

<p>As you can imagine, the disturbance created by my passage through
the Saint-Lazare station has not escaped my notice. Going to visit
friends who knew me under the name of Guillaume Berlat, and amongst
whom my resemblance to Arsène Lupin was a subject of many innocent
jests, I could not assume a disguise, and my presence had been
remarked. So, beyond question, the commissary of police at Rouen,
notified by telegraph, and assisted by numerous agents, would
be awaiting the train, would question all suspicious passengers,
and proceed to search the cars.</p>

<p>Of course, I had foreseen all that, but it had not disturbed
me, as I was certain that the police of Rouen would not be any
shrewder than the police of Paris and that I could escape recognition;
would it not be sufficient for me to carelessly display my card
as "député," thanks to which I had inspired complete confidence
in the gate-keeper at Saint-Lazare? &mdash;But the situation was
greatly changed. I was no longer free. It was impossible to attempt
one of my usual tricks. In one of the compartments, the commissary
of police would find Mon. Arsène Lupin, bound hand and foot, as
docile as a lamb, packed up, all ready to be dumped into a prison-van.
He would have simply to accept delivery of the parcel, the same
as if it were so much merchandise or a basket of fruit and vegetables.
Yet, to avoid that shameful dénouement, what could I do?&mdash;bound
and gagged, as I was? And the train was rushing on toward Rouen,
the next and only station.</p>

<p>Another problem was presented, in which I was less interested,
but the solution of which aroused my professional curiosity. What
were the intentions of my rascally companion? Of course, if I
had been alone, he could, on our arrival at Rouen, leave the car
slowly and fearlessly. But the lady? As soon as the door of the
compartment should be opened, the lady, now so quiet and humble,
would scream and call for help. That was the dilemma that perplexed
me! Why had he not reduced her to a helpless condition similar
to mine? That would have given him ample time to disappear before
his double crime was discovered.</p>

<p>He was still smoking, with his eyes fixed upon the window that
was now being streaked with drops of rain. Once he turned, picked
up my time-table, and consulted it.</p>

<p>The lady had to feign a continued lack of consciousness in order
to deceive the enemy. But fits of coughing, provoked by the smoke,
exposed her true condition. As to me, I was very uncomfortable,
and very tired. And I meditated; I plotted.</p>

<p>The train was rushing on, joyously, intoxicated with its own
speed.</p>

<p>Saint Etienne!....At that moment, the man arose and took two
steps toward us, which caused the lady to utter a cry of alarm
and fall into a genuine swoon. What was the man about to do? He
lowered the window on our side. A heavy rain was now falling,
and, by a gesture, the man expressed his annoyance at his not
having an umbrella or an overcoat. He glanced at the rack. The
lady’s umbrella was there. He took it. He also took my overcoat
and put it on.</p>

<p>We were now crossing the Seine. He turned up the bottoms of his
trousers, then leaned over and raised the exterior latch of the
door. Was he going to throw himself upon the track? At that speed,
it would have been instant death. We now entered a tunnel. The
man opened the door half-way and stood on the upper step. What
folly! The darkness, the smoke, the noise, all gave a fantastic
appearance to his actions. But suddenly, the train diminished
its speed. A moment later it increased its speed, then slowed
up again. Probably, some repairs were being made in that part
of the tunnel which obliged the trains to diminish their speed,
and the man was aware of the fact. He immediately stepped down
to the lower step, closed the door behind him, and leaped to the
ground. He was gone.</p>

<p>The lady immediately recovered her wits, and her first act was
to lament the loss of her jewels. I gave her an imploring look.
She understood, and quickly removed the gag that stifled me. She
wished to untie the cords that bound me, but I prevented her.</p>

<p>"No, no, the police must see everything exactly as it stands.
I want them to see what the rascal did to us."</p>

<p>"Suppose I pull the alarm-bell?"</p>

<p>"Too late. You should have done that when he made the attack
on me."</p>

<p>"But he would have killed me. Ah! monsieur, didn’t I tell you
that he was on this train. I recognized him from his portrait.
And now he has gone off with my jewels."</p>

<p>"Don’t worry. The police will catch him."</p>

<p>"Catch Arsène Lupin! Never."</p>

<p>"That depends on you, madame. Listen. When we arrive at Rouen,
be at the door and call. Make a noise. The police and the railway
employees will come. Tell what you have seen: the assault made
on me and the flight of Arsène Lupin. Give a description of him&mdash;soft
hat, umbrella&mdash;yours&mdash;gray overcoat...."</p>

<p>"Yours," said she.</p>

<p>"What! mine? Not at all. It was his. I didn’t have any."</p>

<p>"It seems to me he didn’t have one when he came in."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes.... unless the coat was one that some one had forgotten
and left in the rack. At all events, he had it when he went away,
and that is the essential point. A gray overcoat&mdash;remember!....Ah!
I forgot. You must tell your name, first thing you do. Your husband’s
official position will stimulate the zeal of the police."</p>

<p>We arrived at the station. I gave her some further instructions
in a rather imperious tone:</p>

<p>"Tell them my name &mdash;Guillaume Berlat. If necessary, say
that you know me. That will save time. We must expedite the preliminary
investigation. The important thing is the pursuit of Arsène Lupin.
Your jewels, remember! Let there be no mistake. Guillaume Berlat,
a friend of your husband."</p>

<p>"I understand....Guillaume Berlat."</p>

<p>She was already calling and gesticulating. As soon as the train
stopped, several men entered the compartment. The critical moment
had come.</p>

<p>Panting for breath, the lady exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Arsène Lupin.... he attacked us.... he stole my jewels....I
am Madame Renaud.... my husband is a director of the penitentiary
service....Ah! here is my brother, Georges Ardelle, director of
the Crédit Rouennais.... you must know...."</p>

<p>She embraced a young man who had just joined us, and whom the
commissary saluted. Then she continued, weeping:</p>

<p>"Yes, Arsène Lupin.... while monsieur was sleeping, he seized
him by the throat....Mon. Berlat, a friend of my husband."</p>

<p>The commissary asked:</p>

<p>"But where is Arsène Lupin?"</p>

<p>"He leaped from the train, when passing through the tunnel."</p>

<p>"Are you sure that it was he?"</p>

<p>"Am I sure! I recognized him perfectly. Besides, he was seen
at the Saint-Lazare station. He wore a soft hat&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, a hard felt, like that," said the commissary, pointing to
my hat.</p>

<p>"He had a soft hat, I am sure," repeated Madame Renaud, "and
a gray overcoat."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is right," replied the commissary, "the telegram says
he wore a gray overcoat with a black velvet collar."</p>

<p>"Exactly, a black velvet collar," exclaimed Madame Renaud, triumphantly.</p>

<p>I breathed freely. Ah! the excellent friend I had in that little
woman.</p>

<p>The police agents had now released me. I bit my lips until they
ran blood. Stooping over, with my handkerchief over my mouth,
an attitude quite natural in a person who has remained for a long
time in an uncomfortable position, and whose mouth shows the bloody
marks of the gag, I addressed the commissary, in a weak voice:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, it was Arsène Lupin. There is no doubt about that.
If we make haste, he can be caught yet. I think I may be of some
service to you."</p>

<p>The railway car, in which the crime occurred, was detached from
the train to serve as a mute witness at the official investigation.
The train continued on its way to Havre. We were then conducted
to the station-master’s office through a crowd of curious spectators.</p>

<p>Then, I had a sudden access of doubt and discretion. Under some
pretext or other, I must gain my automobile, and escape. To remain
there was dangerous. Something might happen; for instance, a telegram
from Paris, and I would be lost.</p>

<p>Yes, but what about my thief? Abandoned to my own resources,
in an unfamiliar country, I could not hope to catch him.</p>

<p>"Bah! I must make the attempt," I said to myself. "It may be
a difficult game, but an amusing one, and the stake is well worth
the trouble."</p>

<p>And when the commissary asked us to repeat the story of the robbery,
I exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, really, Arsène Lupin is getting the start of us. My
automobile is waiting in the courtyard. If you will be so kind
as to use it, we can try...."</p>

<p>The commissary smiled, and replied:</p>

<p>"The idea is a good one; so good, indeed, that it is already
being carried out. Two of my men have set out on bicycles. They
have been gone for some time."</p>

<p>"Where did they go?"</p>

<p>"To the entrance of the tunnel. There, they will gather evidence,
secure witnesses, and follow on the track of Arsène Lupin."</p>

<p>I could not refrain from shrugging my shoulders, as I replied:</p>

<p>"Your men will not secure any evidence or any witnesses."</p>

<p>"Really!"</p>

<p>"Arsène Lupin will not allow anyone to see him emerge from the
tunnel. He will take the first road&#11834;"</p>

<p>"To Rouen, where we will arrest him."</p>

<p>"He will not go to Rouen."</p>

<p>"Then he will remain in the vicinity, where his capture will
be even more certain."</p>

<p>"He will not remain in the vicinity."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! And where will he hide?"</p>

<p>I looked at my watch, and said:</p>

<p>"At the present moment, Arsène Lupin is prowling around the station
at Darnétal. At ten fifty, that is, in twenty-two minutes from
now, he will take the train that goes from Rouen to Amiens."</p>

<p>"Do you think so? How do you know it?"</p>

<p>"Oh! it is quite simple. While we were in the car, Arsène Lupin
consulted my railway guide. Why did he do it? Was there, not far
from the spot where he disappeared, another line of railway, a
station upon that line, and a train stopping at that station?
On consulting my railway guide, I found such to be the case."</p>

<p>"Really, monsieur," said the commissary, "that is a marvelous
deduction. I congratulate you on your skill."</p>

<p>I was now convinced that I had made a mistake in displaying so
much cleverness. The commissary regarded me with astonishment,
and I thought a slight suspicion entered his official mind....Oh!
scarcely that, for the photographs distributed broadcast by the
police department were too imperfect; they presented an Arsène
Lupin so different from the one he had before him, that he could
not possibly recognize me by it. But, all the same, he was troubled,
confused and ill-at-ease.</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu! nothing stimulates the comprehension so much as the
loss of a pocketbook and the desire to recover it. And it seems
to me that if you will give me two of your men, we may be able...."</p>

<p>"Oh! I beg of you, monsieur le commissaire," cried Madame Renaud,
"listen to Mon. Berlat."</p>

<p>The intervention of my excellent friend was decisive. Pronounced
by her, the wife of an influential official, the name of Berlat
became really my own, and gave me an identity that no mere suspicion
could affect. The commissary arose, and said:</p>

<p>"Believe me, Monsieur Berlat, I shall be delighted to see you
succeed. I am as much interested as you are in the arrest of Arsène
Lupin."</p>

<p>He accompanied me to the automobile, and introduced two of his
men, Honoré Massol and Gaston Delivet, who were assigned to assist
me. My chauffer cranked up the car and I took my place at the
wheel. A few seconds later, we left the station. I was saved.</p>

<p>Ah! I must confess that in rolling over the boulevards that surrounded
the old Norman city, in my swift thirty-five horse-power Moreau-Lepton,
I experienced a deep feeling of pride, and the motor responded,
sympathetically to my desires. At right and left, the trees flew
past us with startling rapidity, and I, free, out of danger, had
simply to arrange my little personal affairs with the two honest
representatives of the Rouen police who were sitting behind me.
Arsène Lupin was going in search of Arsène Lupin!</p>

<p>Modest guardians of social order &mdash;Gaston Delivet and Honoré
Massol&mdash;how valuable was your assistance! What would I have done
without you? Without you, many times, at the cross-roads, I might
have taken the wrong route! Without you, Arsène Lupin would have
made a mistake, and the other would have escaped!</p>

<p>But the end was not yet. Far from it. I had yet to capture the
thief and recover the stolen papers. Under no circumstances must
my two acolytes be permitted to see those papers, much less to
seize them. That was a point that might give me some difficulty.</p>

<p>We arrived at Darnétal three minutes after the departure of the
train. True, I had the consolation of learning that a man wearing
a gray overcoat with a black velvet collar had taken the train
at the station. He had bought a second-class ticket for Amiens.
Certainly, my début as detective was a promising one.</p>

<p>Delivet said to me:</p>

<p>"The train is express, and the next stop is Montérolier-Buchy
in nineteen minutes. If we do not reach there before Arsène Lupin,
he can proceed to Amiens, or change for the train going to Clères,
and, from that point, reach Dieppe or Paris."</p>

<p>"How far to Montérolier?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-three kilometres."</p>

<p>"Twenty-three kilometres in nineteen minutes....We will be there
ahead of him."</p>

<p>We were off again! Never had my faithful Moreau-Repton responded
to my impatience with such ardor and regularity. It participated
in my anxiety. It indorsed my determination. It comprehended my
animosity against that rascally Arsène Lupin. The knave! The traitor!</p>

<p>"Turn to the right," cried Delivet, "then to the left."</p>

<p>We fairly flew, scarcely touching the ground. The mile-stones
looked like little timid beasts that vanished at our approach.
Suddenly, at a turn of the road, we saw a vortex of smoke. It
was the Northern Express. For a kilometre, it was a struggle,
side by side, but an unequal struggle in which the issue was certain.
We won the race by twenty lengths.</p>

<p>In three seconds we were on the platform standing before the
second-class carriages. The doors were opened, and some passengers
alighted, but not my thief. We made a search through the compartments.
No sign of Arsène Lupin.</p>

<p>"Sapristi!" I cried, "he must have recognized me in the automobile
as we were racing, side by side, and he leaped from the train."</p>

<p>"Ah! there he is now! crossing the track."</p>

<p>I started in pursuit of the man, followed by my two acolytes,
or rather followed by one of them, for the other, Massol, proved
himself to be a runner of exceptional speed and endurance. In
a few moments, he had made an appreciable gain upon the fugitive.
The man noticed it, leaped over a hedge, scampered across a meadow,
and entered a thick grove. When we reached this grove, Massol
was waiting for us. He went no farther, for fear of losing us.</p>

<p>"Quite right, my dear friend," I said. "After such a run, our
victim must be out of wind. We will catch him now."</p>

<p>I examined the surroundings with the idea of proceeding alone
in the arrest of the fugitive, in order to recover my papers,
concerning which the authorities would doubtless ask many disagreeable
questions. Then I returned to my companions, and said:</p>

<p>"It is all quite easy. You, Massol, take your place at the left;
you, Delivet, at the right. From there, you can observe the entire
posterior line of the bush, and he cannot escape without you seeing
him, except by that ravine, and I shall watch it. If he does not
come out voluntarily, I will enter and drive him out toward one
or the other of you. You have simply to wait. Ah! I forgot: in
case I need you, a pistol shot."</p>

<p>Massol and Delivet walked away to their respective posts. As
soon as they had disappeared, I entered the grove with the greatest
precaution so as to be neither seen nor heard. I encountered dense
thickets, through which narrow paths had been cut, but the overhanging
boughs compelled me to adopt a stooping posture. One of these
paths led to a clearing in which I found footsteps upon the wet
grass. I followed them; they led me to the foot of a mound which
was surmounted by a deserted, dilapidated hovel.</p>

<p>"He must be there," I said to myself. "It is a well-chosen retreat."</p>

<p>I crept cautiously to the side of the building. A slight noise
informed me that he was there; and, then, through an opening,
I saw him. His back was turned toward me. In two bounds, I was
upon him. He tried to fire a revolver that he held in his hand.
But he had no time. I threw him to the ground, in such a manner
that his arms were beneath him, twisted and helpless, whilst I
held him down with my knee on his breast.</p>

<p>"Listen, my boy," I whispered in his ear. "I am Arsène Lupin.
You are to deliver over to me, immediately and gracefully, my
pocketbook and the lady’s jewels, and, in return therefore, I
will save you from the police and enroll you amongst my friends.
One word: yes or no?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Very good. Your escape, this morning, was well planned. I congratulate
you."</p>

<p>I arose. He fumbled in his pocket, drew out a large knife and
tried to strike me with it.</p>

<p>"Imbecile!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>With one hand, I parried the attack; with the other, I gave him
a sharp blow on the carotid artery. He fell&mdash;stunned!</p>

<p>In my pocketbook, I recovered my papers and bank-notes. Out of
curiosity, I took his. Upon an envelope, addressed to him, I read
his name: Pierre Onfrey. It startled me. Pierre Onfrey, the assassin
of the rue Lafontaine at Auteuil! Pierre Onfrey, he who had cut
the throats of Madame Delbois and her two daughters. I leaned
over him. Yes, those were the features which, in the compartment,
had evoked in me the memory of a face I could not then recall.</p>

<p>But time was passing. I placed in an envelope two bank-notes
of one hundred francs each, with a card bearing these words: "Arsène
Lupin to his worthy colleagues Honoré Massol and Gaston Delivet,
as a slight token of his gratitude." I placed it in a prominent
spot in the room, where they would be sure to find it. Beside
it, I placed Madame Renaud’s handbag. Why could I not return it
to the lady who had befriended me? I must confess that I had taken
from it everything that possessed any interest or value, leaving
there only a shell comb, a stick of rouge Dorin for the lips,
and an empty purse. But, you know, business is business. And then,
really, her husband is engaged in such a dishonorable vocation!</p>

<p>The man was becoming conscious. What was I to do? I was unable
to save him or condemn him. So I took his revolver and fired a
shot in the air.</p>

<p>"My two acolytes will come and attend to his case," I said to
myself, as I hastened away by the road through the ravine. Twenty
minutes later, I was seated in my automobile.</p>

<p>At four o’clock, I telegraphed to my friends at Rouen that an
unexpected event would prevent me from making my promised visit.
Between ourselves, considering what my friends must now know,
my visit is postponed indefinitely. A cruel disillusion for them!</p>

<p>At six o’clock I was in Paris. The evening newspapers informed
me that Pierre Onfrey had been captured at last.</p>

<p>Next day,&mdash;let us not despise the advantages of judicious advertising,&mdash;the
‘Echo de France’ published this sensational item:</p>

<p>"Yesterday, near Buchy, after numerous exciting incidents, Arsène
Lupin effected the arrest of Pierre Onfrey. The assassin of the
rue Lafontaine had robbed Madame Renaud, wife of the director
in the penitentiary service, in a railway carriage on the Paris-Havre
line. Arsène Lupin restored to Madame Renaud the hand-bag that
contained her jewels, and gave a generous recompense to the two
detectives who had assisted him in making that dramatic arrest."</p>
