<p>After they learned that Major Monkey was in the habit of going to
Farmer Green's henhouse for eggs, the wild folk began to have a better
opinion of him once more. So long as he didn't steal birds' eggs they
were willing to overlook his stone-throwing--if he didn't throw too
many.
</p>
<p>Somehow they never seemed to think of Farmer Green's loss. Or if they
did, no doubt they thought that he had so many eggs that he wouldn't
mind losing a few now and then.
</p><p>So it happened that Major Monkey found everybody most agreeable--except
old Mr. Crow, who never felt the same toward him again.
</p><p>But Major Monkey did not let Mr. Crow's gruffness trouble him. He had
so many other cronies that he frequently remarked that he had never
spent a pleasanter summer.
</p><p>"I've decided"--he told Jolly Robin one day, when he stopped in the
orchard to eat an apple--"I've decided to stay right here in Pleasant
Valley for the rest of my life."
</p><p>"My gracious!" Jolly Robin exclaimed. "Then you don't mind cold
weather."
</p><p>Major Monkey asked him what he meant. And it surprised him to learn
that all winter long deep snow lay upon the ground, and cold winds
blew, and fierce storms often raged.
</p><p>Though it was a hot summer's day, Major Monkey shivered at the mere
mention of such things. And he pulled his red cap further down upon
his head.
</p><p>"If that's the case," he said, "I certainly don't want to spend the
winters here.... I don't see how you manage to live through them."
</p><p>Jolly Robin laughed merrily. "Bless you!" he cried. "I don't stay here
the year 'round. As soon as it begins to grow chilly I go South, where
it's warm."
</p><p>Now, Major Monkey looked worried when he heard about the bitter
winters in Pleasant Valley. His queer face had screwed itself into
even more wrinkles than it usually wore. But as soon as Jolly Robin
spoke of going to a warmer place, the Major brightened at once.
</p><p>"I'm going South too!" he cried. "And if you've no objection we'll
travel together."
</p><p>Jolly Robin said that nothing would please him more.
</p><p>"I shall be glad to go with you--if my wife doesn't object," he assured
the Major.
</p><p>"Oh! She won't mind," said Major Monkey. "She can go with us. We'll
make up a party.... She'll be lucky to go anywhere with such a famous
traveller as I am."
</p><p>Jolly Robin said somewhat doubtfully that he hoped Mrs. Robin would
accept their plan. And then he dashed Major Monkey's high hopes by
remarking, "Of course, we always fly when we go South."
</p><p>The Major's face fell. He looked careworn and unhappy again.
</p><p>"I don't know how to fly," he faltered. "But if you'll fly low, and
slowly enough, perhaps I can run through the tree-tops fast enough to
keep up with you. I hope it isn't a long trip," he added somewhat
anxiously.
</p><p>"It's about a thousand miles," Jolly Robin told him.
