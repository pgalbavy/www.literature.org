<p></p>

<p>Ursula came back to Cossethay to fight with her mother. Her schooldays
were over. She had passed the matriculation examination. Now she came
home to face that empty period between school and possible marriage.</p>

<p>At first she thought it would be just like holidays all the time, she
would feel just free. Her soul was in chaos, blinded suffering, maimed.
She had no will left to think about herself. For a time she must just
lapse.</p>

<p>But very shortly she found herself up against her mother. Her mother
had, at this time, the power to irritate and madden the girl
continuously. There were already seven children, yet Mrs. Brangwen was
again with child, the ninth she had borne. One had died of diphtheria
in infancy.</p>

<p>Even this fact of her mother's pregnancy enraged the eldest girl. Mrs.
Brangwen was so complacent, so utterly fulfilled in her breeding. She
would not have the existence at all of anything but the immediate,
physical, common things. Ursula inflamed in soul, was suffering all the
anguish of youth's reaching for some unknown ordeal, that it can't
grasp, can't even distinguish or conceive. Maddened, she was fighting
all the darkness she was up against. And part of this darkness was her
mother. To limit, as her mother did, everything to the ring of physical
considerations, and complacently to reject the reality of anything
else, was horrible. Not a thing did Mrs. Brangwen care about, but the
children, the house, and a little local gossip. And she would not be
touched, she would let nothing else live near her. She went about, big
with child, slovenly, easy, having a certain lax dignity, taking her
own time, pleasing herself, always, always doing things for the
children, and feeling that she thereby fulfilled the whole of
womanhood.</p>

<p>This long trance of complacent child-bearing had kept her young and
undeveloped. She was scarcely a day older than when Gudrun was born.
All these years nothing had happened save the coming of the children,
nothing had mattered but the bodies of her babies. As her children came
into consciousness, as they began to suffer their own fulfilment, she
cast them off. But she remained dominant in the house. Brangwen
continued in a kind of rich drowse of physical heat, in connection with
his wife. They were neither of them quite personal, quite defined as
individuals, so much were they pervaded by the physical heat of
breeding and rearing their young.</p>

<p>How Ursula resented it, how she fought against the close, physical,
limited life of herded domesticity! Calm, placid, unshakeable as ever,
Mrs. Brangwen went about in her dominance of physical maternity.</p>

<p>There were battles. Ursula would fight for things that mattered to her.
She would have the children less rude and tyrannical, she would have a
place in the house. But her mother pulled her down, pulled her down.
With all the cunning instinct of a breeding animal, Mrs. Brangwen
ridiculed and held cheap Ursula's passions, her ideas, her
pronunciations. Ursula would try to insist, in her own home, on the
right of women to take equal place with men in the field of action and
work.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; said the mother, &quot;there's a good crop of stockings lying ripe for
mending. Let that be your field of action.&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula disliked mending stockings, and this retort maddened her. She
hated her mother bitterly. After a few weeks of enforced domestic life,
she had had enough of her home. The commonness, the triviality, the
immediate meaninglessness of it all drove her to frenzy. She talked and
stormed ideas, she corrected and nagged at the children, she turned her
back in silent contempt on her breeding mother, who treated her with
supercilious indifference, as if she were a pretentious child not to be
taken seriously.</p>

<p>Brangwen was sometimes dragged into the trouble. He loved Ursula,
therefore he always had a sense of shame, almost of betrayal, when he
turned on her. So he turned fiercely and scathingly, and with a
wholesale brutality that made Ursula go white, mute, and numb. Her
feelings seemed to be becoming deadened in her, her temper hard and
cold.</p>

<p>Brangwen himself was in one of his states or flux. After all these
years, he began to see a loophole of freedom. For twenty years he had
gone on at this office as a draughtsman, doing work in which he had no
interest, because it seemed his allotted work. The growing up of his
daughters, their developing rejection of old forms set him also free.</p>

<p>He was a man of ceaseless activity. Blindly, like a mole, he pushed his
way out of the earth that covered him, working always away from the
physical element in which his life was captured. Slowly, blindly,
gropingly, with what initiative was left to him, he made his way
towards individual expression and individual form.</p>

<p>At last, after twenty years, he came back to his woodcarving, almost to
the point where he had left off his Adam and Eve panel, when he was
courting. But now he had knowledge and skill without vision. He saw the
puerility of his young conceptions, he saw the unreal world in which
they had been conceived. He now had a new strength in his sense of
reality. He felt as if he were real, as if he handled real things. He
had worked for many years at Cossethay, building the organ for the
church, restoring the woodwork, gradually coming to a knowledge of
beauty in the plain labours. Now he wanted again to carve things that
were utterances of himself.</p>

<p>But he could not quite hitch on - always he was too busy, too uncertain,
confused. Wavering, he began to study modelling. To his surprise he
found he could do it. Modelling in clay, in plaster, he produced
beautiful reproductions, really beautiful. Then he set-to to make a
head of Ursula, in high relief, in the Donatello manner. In his first
passion, he got a beautiful suggestion of his desire. But the pitch of
concentration would not come. With a little ash in his mouth he gave
up. He continued to copy, or to make designs by selecting motives from
classic stuff. He loved the Della Robbia and Donatello as he had loved
Fra Angelico when he was a young man. His work had some of the
freshness, the naive alertness of the early Italians. But it was only
reproduction.</p>

<p>Having reached his limit in modelling, he turned to painting. But he
tried water-colour painting after the manner of any other amateur. He
got his results but was not much interested. After one or two drawings
of his beloved church, which had the same alertness as his modelling,
he seemed to be incongruous with the modern atmospheric way of
painting, so that his church tower stood up, really stood and asserted
its standing, but was ashamed of its own lack of meaning, he turned
away again.</p>

<p>He took up jewellery, read Benvenuto Cellini, pored over reproductions
of ornament, and began to make pendants in silver and pearl and matrix.
The first things he did, in his start of discovery, were really
beautiful. Those later were more imitative. But, starting with his
wife, he made a pendant each for all his womenfolk. Then he made rings
and bracelets.</p>

<p>Then he took up beaten and chiselled metal work. When Ursula left
school, he was making a silver bowl of lovely shape. How he delighted
in it, almost lusted after it.</p>

<p>All this time his only connection with the real outer world was through
his winter evening classes, which brought him into contact with state
education. About all the rest, he was oblivious, and entirely
indifferent - even about the war. The nation did not exist to him. He
was in a private retreat of his own, that had neither nationality, nor
any great adherent.</p>

<p>Ursula watched the newspapers, vaguely, concerning the war in South
Africa. They made her miserable, and she tried to have as little to do
with them as possible. But Skrebensky was out there. He sent her an
occasional post-card. But it was as if she were a blank wall in his
direction, without windows or outgoing. She adhered to the Skrebensky
of her memory.</p>

<p>Her love for Winifred Inger wrenched her life as it seemed from the
roots and native soil where Skrebensky had belonged to it, and she was
aridly transplanted. He was really only a memory. She revived his
memory with strange passion, after the departure of Winifred. He was to
her almost the symbol of her real life. It was as if, through him, in
him, she might return to her own self, which she was before she had
loved Winifred, before this deadness had come upon her, this pitiless
transplanting. But even her memories were the work of her imagination.</p>

<p>She dreamed of him and her as they had been together. She could not
dream of him progressively, of what he was doing now, of what relation
he would have to her now. Only sometimes she wept to think how cruelly
she had suffered when he left her - ah, how she had suffered! She
remembered what she had written in her diary:</p>

<p>&quot;If I were the moon, I know where I would fall down.&quot;</p>

<p>Ah, it was a dull agony to her to remember what she had been then. For
it was remembering a dead self. All that was dead after Winifred. She
knew the corpse of her young, loving self, she knew its grave. And the
young living self she mourned for had scarcely existed, it was the
creature of her imagination.</p>

<p>Deep within her a cold despair remained unchanging and unchanged. No
one would ever love her now - she would love no one. The body of love
was killed in her after Winifred, there was something of the corpse in
her. She would live, she would go on, but she would have no lovers, no
lover would want her any more. She herself would want no lover. The
vividest little flame of desire was extinct in her for ever. The tiny,
vivid germ that contained the bud of her real self, her real love, was
killed, she would go on growing as a plant, she would do her best to
produce her minor flowers, but her leading flower was dead before it
was born, all her growth was the conveying of a corpse of hope.</p>

<p>The miserable weeks went on, in the poky house crammed with children.
What was her life - a sordid, formless, disintegrated nothing; Ursula
Brangwen a person without worth or importance, living in the mean
village of Cossethay, within the sordid scope of Ilkeston. Ursula
Brangwen, at seventeen, worthless and unvalued, neither wanted nor
needed by anybody, and conscious herself of her own dead value. It
would not bear thinking of.</p>

<p>But still her dogged pride held its own. She might be defiled, she
might be a corpse that should never be loved, she might be a
core-rotten stalk living upon the food that others provided; yet she
would give in to nobody.</p>

<p>Gradually she became conscious that she could not go on living at home
as she was doing, without place or meaning or worth. The very children
that went to school held her uselessness in contempt. She must do
something.</p>

<p>Her father said she had plenty to do to help her mother. From her
parents she would never get more than a hit in the face. She was not a
practical person. She thought of wild things, of running away and
becoming a domestic servant, of asking some man to take her.</p>

<p>She wrote to the mistress of the High School for advice.</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot see very clearly what you should do, Ursula,&quot; came the reply,
&quot;unless you are willing to become an elementary school teacher. You
have matriculated, and that qualifies you to take a post as
uncertificated teacher in any school, at a salary of about fifty pounds
a year.</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot tell you how deeply I sympathise with you in your desire to
do something. You will learn that mankind is a great body of which you
are one useful member, you will take your own place at the great task
which humanity is trying to fulfil. That will give you a satisfaction
and a self-respect which nothing else could give.&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula's heart sank. It was a cold, dreary satisfaction to think of.
Yet her cold will acquiesced. This was what she wanted.</p>

<p>&quot;You have an emotional nature,&quot; the letter went on, &quot;a quick natural
response. If only you could learn patience and self-discipline, I do
not see why you should not make a good teacher. The least you could do
is to try. You need only serve a year, or perhaps two years, as
uncertificated teacher. Then you would go to one of the training
colleges, where I hope you would take your degree. I most strongly urge
and advise you to keep up your studies always with the intention of
taking a degree. That will give you a qualification and a position in
the world, and will give you more scope to choose your own way.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall be proud to see one of my girls win her own economical
independence, which means so much more than it seems. I shall be glad
indeed to know that one more of my girls has provided for herself the
means of freedom to choose for herself.&quot;</p>

<p>It all sounded grim and desperate. Ursula rather hated it. But her
mother's contempt and her father's harshness had made her raw at the
quick, she knew the ignominy of being a hanger-on, she felt the
festering thorn of her mother's animal estimation.</p>

<p>At length she had to speak. Hard and shut down and silent within
herself, she slipped out one evening to the workshed. She heard the
tap-tap-tap of the hammer upon the metal. Her father lifted his head as
the door opened. His face was ruddy and bright with instinct, as when
he was a youth, his black moustache was cut close over his wide mouth,
his black hair was fine and close as ever. But there was about him an
abstraction, a sort of instrumental detachment from human things. He
was a worker. He watched his daughter's hard, expressionless face. A
hot anger came over his breast and belly.</p>

<p>&quot;What now?&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Can't I,&quot; she answered, looking aside, not looking at him, &quot;can't I go
out to work?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go out to work, what for?&quot;</p>

<p>His voice was so strong, and ready, and vibrant. It irritated her.</p>

<p>&quot;I want some other life than this.&quot;</p>

<p>A flash of strong rage arrested all his blood for a moment.</p>

<p>&quot;Some other life?&quot; he repeated. &quot;Why, what other life do you want?&quot;</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>&quot;Something else besides housework and hanging about. And I want to earn
something.&quot;</p>

<p>Her curious, brutal hardness of speech, and the fierce invincibility of
her youth, which ignored him, made him also harden with anger.</p>

<p>&quot;And how do you think you're going to earn anything?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I can become a teacher - I'm qualified by my matric.&quot;</p>

<p>He wished her matric. in hell.</p>

<p>&quot;And how much are you qualified to earn by your matric?&quot; he asked,
jeering.</p>

<p>&quot;Fifty pounds a year,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He was silent, his power taken out of his hand.</p>

<p>He had always hugged a secret pride in the fact that his daughters need
not go out to work. With his wife's money and his own they had four
hundred a year. They could draw on the capital if need be later on. He
was not afraid for his old age. His daughters might be ladies.</p>

<p>Fifty pounds a year was a pound a week - which was enough for her to
live on independently.</p>

<p>&quot;And what sort of a teacher do you think you'd make? You haven't the
patience of a Jack-gnat with your own brothers and sisters, let alone
with a class of children. And I thought you didn't like dirty, board-
school brats.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They're not all dirty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'd find they're not all clean.&quot;</p>

<p>There was silence in the workshop. The lamplight fell on the burned
silver bowl that lay between him, on mallet and furnace and chisel.
Brangwen stood with a queer, catlike light on his face, almost like a
smile. But it was no smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Can I try?&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;You can do what the deuce you like, and go where you like.&quot;</p>

<p>Her face was fixed and expressionless and indifferent. It always sent
him to a pitch of frenzy to see it like that. He kept perfectly still.</p>

<p>Cold, without any betrayal of feeling, she turned and left the shed. He
worked on, with all his nerves jangled. Then he had to put down his
tools and go into the house.</p>

<p>In a bitter tone of anger and contempt he told his wife. Ursula was
present. There was a brief altercation, closed by Mrs. Brangwen's
saying, in a tone of biting superiority and indifference:</p>

<p>&quot;Let her find out what it's like. She'll soon have had enough.&quot;</p>

<p>The matter was left there. But Ursula considered herself free to act.
For some days she made no move. She was reluctant to take the cruel
step of finding work, for she shrank with extreme sensitiveness and
shyness from new contact, new situations. Then at length a sort of
doggedness drove her. Her soul was full of bitterness.</p>

<p>She went to the Free Library in Ilkeston, copied out addresses from the
Schoolmistress, and wrote for application forms. After two days she
rose early to meet the postman. As she expected, there were three long
envelopes.</p>

<p>Her heart beat painfully as she went up with them to her bedroom. Her
fingers trembled, she could hardly force herself to look at the long,
official forms she had to fill in. The whole thing was so cruel, so
impersonal. Yet it must be done.</p>

<p>&quot;Name (surname first):...&quot;</p>

<p>In a trembling hand she wrote, &quot;Brangwen, - Ursula.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Age and date of birth:...&quot;</p>

<p>After a long time considering, she filled in that line.</p>

<p>&quot;Qualifications, with date of Examination:...&quot;</p>

<p>With a little pride she wrote:</p>

<p>&quot;London Matriculation Examination.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Previous experience and where obtained:...&quot;</p>

<p>Her heart sank as she wrote:</p>

<p>&quot;None.&quot;</p>

<p>Still there was much to answer. It took her two hours to fill in the
three forms. Then she had to copy her testimonials from her
head-mistress and from the clergyman.</p>

<p>At last, however, it was finished. She had sealed the three long
envelopes. In the afternoon she went down to Ilkeston to post them. She
said nothing of it all to her parents. As she stamped her long letters
and put them into the box at the main post-office she felt as if
already she was out of the reach of her father and mother, as if she
had connected herself with the outer, greater world of activity, the
man-made world.</p>

<p>As she returned home, she dreamed again in her own fashion her old,
gorgeous dreams. One of her applications was to Gillingham, in Kent,
one to Kingston-on-Thames, and one to Swanwick in Derbyshire.</p>

<p>Gillingham was such a lovely name, and Kent was the Garden of England.
So that, in Gillingham, an old, old village by the hopfields, where the
sun shone softly, she came out of school in the afternoon into the
shadow of the plane trees by the gate, and turned down the sleepy road
towards the cottage where cornflowers poked their blue heads through
the old wooden fence, and phlox stood built up of blossom beside the
path.</p>

<p>A delicate, silver-haired lady rose with delicate, ivory hands uplifted
as Ursula entered the room, and:</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, my dear, what do you think!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is it, Mrs. Wetherall?&quot;</p>

<p>Frederick had come home. Nay, his manly step was heard on the stair,
she saw his strong boots, his blue trousers, his uniformed figure, and
then his face, clean and keen as an eagle's, and his eyes lit up with
the glamour of strange seas, ah, strange seas that had woven through
his soul, as he descended into the kitchen.</p>

<p>This dream, with its amplifications, lasted her a mile of walking. Then
she went to Kingston-on-Thames.</p>

<p>Kingston-on-Thames was an old historic place just south of London.
There lived the well-born dignified souls who belonged to the
metropolis, but who loved peace. There she met a wonderful family of
girls living in a large old Queen Anne house, whose lawns sloped to the
river, and in an atmosphere of stately peace she found herself among
her soul's intimates. They loved her as sisters, they shared with her
all noble thoughts.</p>

<p>She was happy again. In her musings she spread her poor, clipped wings,
and flew into the pure empyrean.</p>

<p>Day followed day. She did not speak to her parents. Then came the
return of her testimonials from Gillingham. She was not wanted, neither
at Swanwick. The bitterness of rejection followed the sweets of hope.
Her bright feathers were in the dust again.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, after a fortnight, came an intimation from
Kingston-on-Thames. She was to appear at the Education Office of that
town on the following Thursday, for an interview with the Committee.
Her heart stood still. She knew she would make the Committee accept
her. Now she was afraid, now that her removal was imminent. Her heart
quivered with fear and reluctance. But underneath her purpose was
fixed.</p>

<p>She passed shadowily through the day, unwilling to tell her news to her
mother, waiting for her father. Suspense and fear were strong upon her.
She dreaded going to Kingston. Her easy dreams disappeared from the
grasp of reality.</p>

<p>And yet, as the afternoon wore away, the sweetness of the dream
returned again. Kingston-on-Thames - there was such sound of dignity to
her. The shadow of history and the glamour of stately progress
enveloped her. The palaces would be old and darkened, the place of
kings obscured. Yet it was a place of kings for her - Richard and Henry
and Wolsey and Queen Elizabeth. She divined great lawns with noble
trees, and terraces whose steps the water washed softly, where the
swans sometimes came to earth. Still she must see the stately, gorgeous
barge of the Queen float down, the crimson carpet put upon the landing
stairs, the gentlemen in their purple-velvet cloaks, bare-headed,
standing in the sunshine grouped on either side waiting.</p>

<p>&quot;Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song.&quot;</p>

<p>Evening came, her father returned home, sanguine and alert and detached
as ever. He was less real than her fancies. She waited whilst he ate
his tea. He took big mouthfuls, big bites, and ate unconsciously with
the same abandon an animal gives to its food.</p>

<p>Immediately after tea he went over to the church. It was
choir-practice, and he wanted to try the tunes on his organ.</p>

<p>The latch of the big door clicked loudly as she came after him, but the
organ rolled more loudly still. He was unaware. He was practising the
anthem. She saw his small, jet-black head and alert face between the
candle-flames, his slim body sagged on the music-stool. His face was so
luminous and fixed, the movements of his limbs seemed strange, apart
from him. The sound of the organ seemed to belong to the very stone of
the pillars, like sap running in them.</p>

<p>Then there was a close of music and silence.</p>

<p>&quot;Father!&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He looked round as if at an apparition. Ursula stood shadowily within
the candle-light.</p>

<p>&quot;What now?&quot; he said, not coming to earth.</p>

<p>It was difficult to speak to him.</p>

<p>&quot;I've got a situation,&quot; she said, forcing herself to speak.</p>

<p>&quot;You've got what?&quot; he answered, unwilling to come out of his mood of
organ-playing. He closed the music before him.</p>

<p>&quot;I've got a situation to go to.&quot;</p>

<p>Then he turned to her, still abstracted, unwilling.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, where's that?&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;At Kingston-on-Thames. I must go on Thursday for an interview with the
Committee.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You must go on Thursday?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>And she handed him the letter. He read it by the light of the candles.</p>

<p>&quot;Ursula Brangwen, Yew Tree Cottage, Cossethay, Derbyshire.</p>

<p>&quot;Dear Madam, You are requested to call at the above offices on Thursday
next, the 10th, at 11.30 a.m., for an interview with the committee,
referring to your application for the post of assistant mistress at the
Wellingborough Green Schools.&quot;</p>

<p>It was very difficult for Brangwen to take in this remote and official
information, glowing as he was within the quiet of his church and his
anthem music.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you needn't bother me with it now, need you?' he said
impatiently, giving her back the letter.</p>

<p>&quot;I've got to go on Thursday,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He sat motionless. Then he reached more music, and there was a rushing
sound of air, then a long, emphatic trumpet-note of the organ, as he
laid his hands on the keys. Ursula turned and went away.</p>

<p>He tried to give himself again to the organ. But he could not. He could
not get back. All the time a sort of string was tugging, tugging him
elsewhere, miserably.</p>

<p>So that when he came into the house after choir-practice his face was
dark and his heart black. He said nothing however, until all the
younger children were in bed. Ursula, however, knew what was brewing.</p>

<p>At length he asked:</p>

<p>&quot;Where's that letter?&quot;</p>

<p>She gave it to him. He sat looking at it. &quot;You are requested to call at
the above offices on Thursday next -  - &quot; It was a cold, official notice
to Ursula herself and had nothing to do with him. So! She existed now
as a separate social individual. It was for her to answer this note,
without regard to him. He had even no right to interfere. His heart was
hard and angry.</p>

<p>&quot;You had to do it behind our backs, had you?&quot; he said, with a sneer.
And her heart leapt with hot pain. She knew she was free - she had
broken away from him. He was beaten.</p>

<p>&quot;You said, 'let her try,'&quot; she retorted, almost apologising to him.</p>

<p>He did not hear. He sat looking at the letter.</p>

<p>&quot;Education Office, Kingston-on-Thames&quot; - and then the typewritten &quot;Miss
Ursula Brangwen, Yew Tree Cottage, Cossethay.&quot; It was all so complete
and so final. He could not but feel the new position Ursula held, as
recipient of that letter. It was an iron in his soul.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said at length, &quot;you're not going.&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula started and could find no words to clamour her revolt.</p>

<p>&quot;If you think you're going dancin' off to th' other side of London,
you're mistaken.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not?&quot; she cried, at once hard fixed in her will to go.</p>

<p>&quot;That's why not,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>And there was silence till Mrs. Brangwen came downstairs.</p>

<p>&quot;Look here, Anna,&quot; he said, handing her the letter.</p>

<p>She put back her head, seeing a typewritten letter, anticipating
trouble from the outside world. There was the curious, sliding motion
of her eyes, as if she shut off her sentient, maternal self, and a kind
of hard trance, meaningless, took its place. Thus, meaningless, she
glanced over the letter, careful not to take it in. She apprehended the
contents with her callous, superficial mind. Her feeling self was shut
down.</p>

<p>&quot;What post is it?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;She wants to go and be a teacher in Kingston-on-Thames, at fifty
pounds a year.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, indeed.&quot;</p>

<p>The mother spoke as if it were a hostile fact concerning some stranger.
She would have let her go, out of callousness. Mrs. Brangwen would
begin to grow up again only with her youngest child. Her eldest girl
was in the way now.</p>

<p>&quot;She's not going all that distance,&quot; said the father.</p>

<p>&quot;I have to go where they want me,&quot; cried Ursula. &quot;And it's a good place
to go to.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you know about the place?&quot; said her father harshly.</p>

<p>&quot;And it doesn't matter whether they want you or not, if your father
says you are not to go,&quot; said the mother calmly.</p>

<p>How Ursula hated her!</p>

<p>&quot;You said I was to try,&quot; the girl cried. &quot;Now I've got a place and I'm
going to go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're not going all that distance,&quot; said her father.</p>

<p>&quot;Why don't you get a place at Ilkeston, where you can live at home?&quot;
asked Gudrun, who hated conflicts, who could not understand Ursula's
uneasy way, yet who must stand by her sister.</p>

<p>&quot;There aren't any places in Ilkeston,&quot; cried Ursula. &quot;And I'd rather go
right away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you'd asked about it, a place could have been got for you in
Ilkeston. But you had to play Miss High-an'-mighty, and go your own
way,&quot; said her father.</p>

<p>&quot;I've no doubt you'd rather go right away,&quot; said her mother, very
caustic. &quot;And I've no doubt you'd find other people didn't put up with
you for very long either. You've too much opinion of yourself for your
good.&quot;</p>

<p>Between the girl and her mother was a feeling of pure hatred. There
came a stubborn silence. Ursula knew she must break it.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, they've written to me, and I s'll have to go,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Where will you get the money from?&quot; asked her father.</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle Tom will give it me,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Again there was silence. This time she was triumphant.</p>

<p>Then at length her father lifted his head. His face was abstracted, he
seemed to be abstracting himself, to make a pure statement.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you're not going all that distance away,&quot; he said. &quot;I'll ask Mr.
Burt about a place here. I'm not going to have you by yourself at the
other side of London.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I've got to go to Kingston,&quot; said Ursula. &quot;They've sent for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They'll do without you,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>There was a trembling silence when she was on the point of tears.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; she said, low and tense, &quot;you can put me off this, but I'm
going to have a place. I'm not going to stop at home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nobody wants you to stop at home,&quot; he suddenly shouted, going livid
with rage.</p>

<p>She said no more. Her nature had gone hard and smiling in its own
arrogance, in its own antagonistic indifference to the rest of them.
This was the state in which he wanted to kill her. She went singing
into the parlour.</p>

<p>&quot;C'EST LA MERE MICHEL QUI A PERDU SON CHAT,
QUI CRI PAR LA FENETRE QU'EST-CE QUI LE LUI RENDRA -  - &quot;</p>

<p>During the next days Ursula went about bright and hard, singing to
herself, making love to the children, but her soul hard and cold with
regard to her parents. Nothing more was said. The hardness and
brightness lasted for four days. Then it began to break up. So at
evening she said to her father:</p>

<p>&quot;Have you spoken about a place for me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I spoke to Mr. Burt.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What did he say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's a committee meeting to-morrow. He'll tell me on Friday.&quot;</p>

<p>So she waited till Friday. Kingston-on-Thames had been an exciting
dream. Here she could feel the hard, raw reality. So she knew that this
would come to pass. Because nothing was ever fulfilled, she found,
except in the hard limited reality. She did not want to be a teacher in
Ilkeston, because she knew Ilkeston, and hated it. But she wanted to be
free, so she must take her freedom where she could.</p>

<p>On Friday her father said there was a place vacant in Brinsley Street
school. This could most probably be secured for her, at once, without
the trouble of application.</p>

<p>Her heart halted. Brinsley Street was a school in a poor quarter, and
she had had a taste of the common children of Ilkeston. They had
shouted after her and thrown stones. Still, as a teacher, she would be
in authority. And it was all unknown. She was excited. The very forest
of dry, sterile brick had some fascination for her. It was so hard and
ugly, so relentlessly ugly, it would purge her of some of her floating
sentimentality.</p>

<p>She dreamed how she would make the little, ugly children love her. She
would be so personal. Teachers were always so hard and impersonal.
There was no vivid relationship. She would make everything personal and
vivid, she would give herself, she would give, give, give all her great
stores of wealth to her children, she would make them so happy, and
they would prefer her to any teacher on the face of the earth.</p>

<p>At Christmas she would choose such fascinating Christmas cards for
them, and she would give them such a happy party in one of the
class-rooms.</p>

<p>The headmaster, Mr. Harby, was a short, thick-set, rather common man,
she thought. But she would hold before him the light of grace and
refinement, he would have her in such high esteem before long. She
would be the gleaming sun of the school, the children would blossom
like little weeds, the teachers like tall, hard plants would burst into
rare flower.</p>

<p>The Monday morning came. It was the end of September, and a drizzle of
fine rain like veils round her, making her seem intimate, a world to
herself. She walked forward to the new land. The old was blotted out.
The veil would be rent that hid the new world. She was gripped hard
with suspense as she went down the hill in the rain, carrying her
dinner-bag.</p>

<p>Through the thin rain she saw the town, a black, extensive mount. She
must enter in upon it. She felt at once a feeling of repugnance and of
excited fulfilment. But she shrank.</p>

<p>She waited at the terminus for the tram. Here it was beginning. Before
her was the station to Nottingham, whence Theresa had gone to school
half an hour before; behind her was the little church school she had
attended when she was a child, when her grandmother was alive. Her
grandmother had been dead two years now. There was a strange woman at
the Marsh, with her Uncle Fred, and a small baby. Behind her was
Cossethay, and blackberries were ripe on the hedges.</p>

<p>As she waited at the tram-terminus she reverted swiftly to her
childhood; her teasing grandfather, with his fair beard and blue eyes,
and his big, monumental body; he had got drowned: her grandmother, whom
Ursula would sometimes say she had loved more than anyone else in the
world: the little church school, the Phillips boys; one was a soldier
in the Life Guards now, one was a collier. With a passion she clung to
the past.</p>

<p>But as she dreamed of it, she heard the tram-car grinding round a bend,
rumbling dully, she saw it draw into sight, and hum nearer. It sidled
round the loop at the terminus, and came to a standstill, looming above
her. Some shadowy grey people stepped from the far end, the conductor
was walking in the puddles, swinging round the pole.</p>

<p>She mounted into the wet, comfortless tram, whose floor was dark with
wet, whose windows were all steamed, and she sat in suspense. It had
begun, her new existence.</p>

<p>One other passenger mounted - a sort of charwoman with a drab, wet coat.
Ursula could not bear the waiting of the tram. The bell clanged, there
was a lurch forward. The car moved cautiously down the wet street. She
was being carried forward, into her new existence. Her heart burned
with pain and suspense, as if something were cutting her living tissue.</p>

<p>Often, oh often the tram seemed to stop, and wet, cloaked people
mounted and sat mute and grey in stiff rows opposite her, their
umbrellas between their knees. The windows of the tram grew more
steamy; opaque. She was shut in with these unliving, spectral people.
Even yet it did not occur to her that she was one of them. The
conductor came down issuing tickets. Each little ring of his clipper
sent a pang of dread through her. But her ticket surely was different
from the rest.</p>

<p>They were all going to work; she also was going to work. Her ticket was
the same. She sat trying to fit in with them. But fear was at her
bowels, she felt an unknown, terrible grip upon her.</p>

<p>At Bath Street she must dismount and change trams. She looked uphill.
It seemed to lead to freedom. She remembered the many Saturday
afternoons she had walked up to the shops. How free and careless she
had been!</p>

<p>Ah, her tram was sliding gingerly downhill. She dreaded every yard of
her conveyance. The car halted, she mounted hastily.</p>

<p>She kept turning her head as the car ran on, because she was uncertain
of the street. At last, her heart a flame of suspense, trembling, she
rose. The conductor rang the bell brusquely.</p>

<p>She was walking down a small, mean, wet street, empty of people. The
school squatted low within its railed, asphalt yard, that shone black
with rain. The building was grimy, and horrible, dry plants were
shadowily looking through the windows.</p>

<p>She entered the arched doorway of the porch. The whole place seemed to
have a threatening expression, imitating the church's architecture, for
the purpose of domineering, like a gesture of vulgar authority. She saw
that one pair of feet had paddled across the flagstone floor of the
porch. The place was silent, deserted, like an empty prison waiting the
return of tramping feet.</p>

<p>Ursula went forward to the teachers' room that burrowed in a gloomy
hole. She knocked timidly.</p>

<p>&quot;Come in!&quot; called a surprised man's voice, as from a prison cell. She
entered the dark little room that never got any sun. The gas was
lighted naked and raw. At the table a thin man in shirt-sleeves was
rubbing a paper on a jellytray. He looked up at Ursula with his narrow,
sharp face, said &quot;Good morning,&quot; then turned away again, and stripped
the paper off the tray, glancing at the violet-coloured writing
transferred, before he dropped the curled sheet aside among a heap.</p>

<p>Ursula watched him fascinated. In the gaslight and gloom and the
narrowness of the room, all seemed unreal.</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't it a nasty morning,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;it's not much of weather.&quot;</p>

<p>But in here it seemed that neither morning nor weather really existed.
This place was timeless. He spoke in an occupied voice, like an echo.
Ursula did not know what to say. She took off her waterproof.</p>

<p>&quot;Am I early?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>The man looked first at a little clock, then at her. His eyes seemed to
be sharpened to needle-points of vision.</p>

<p>&quot;Twenty-five past,&quot; he said. &quot;You're the second to come. I'm first this
morning.&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula sat down gingerly on the edge of a chair, and watched his thin
red hands rubbing away on the white surface of the paper, then pausing,
pulling up a corner of the sheet, peering, and rubbing away again.
There was a great heap of curled white-and-scribbled sheets on the
table.</p>

<p>&quot;Must you do so many?&quot; asked Ursula.</p>

<p>Again the man glanced up sharply. He was about thirty or thirty-three
years old, thin, greenish, with a long nose and a sharp face. His eyes
were blue, and sharp as points of steel, rather beautiful, the girl
thought.</p>

<p>&quot;Sixty-three,&quot; he answered.</p>

<p>&quot;So many!&quot; she said, gently. Then she remembered.</p>

<p>&quot;But they're not all for your class, are they?&quot; she added.</p>

<p>&quot;Why aren't they?&quot; he replied, a fierceness in his voice.</p>

<p>Ursula was rather frightened by his mechanical ignoring of her, and his
directness of statement. It was something new to her. She had never
been treated like this before, as if she did not count, as if she were
addressing a machine.</p>

<p>&quot;It is too many,&quot; she said sympathetically.</p>

<p>&quot;You'll get about the same,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>That was all she received. She sat rather blank, not knowing how to
feel. Still she liked him. He seemed so cross. There was a queer,
sharp, keen-edge feeling about him that attracted her and frightened
her at the same time. It was so cold, and against his nature.</p>

<p>The door opened, and a short, neutral-tinted young woman of about
twenty-eight appeared.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Ursula!&quot; the newcomer exclaimed. &quot;You are here early! My word,
I'll warrant you don't keep it up. That's Mr. Williamson's peg. This is
yours. Standard Five teacher always has this. Aren't you going to take
your hat off?&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Violet Harby removed Ursula's waterproof from the peg on which it
was hung, to one a little farther down the row. She had already
snatched the pins from her own stuff hat, and jammed them through her
coat. She turned to Ursula, as she pushed up her frizzed, flat,
dun-coloured hair.</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't it a beastly morning,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;beastly! And if there's
one thing I hate above another it's a wet Monday morning; - pack of kids
trailing in anyhow-nohow, and no holding 'em -  - &quot;</p>

<p>She had taken a black pinafore from a newspaper package, and was tying
it round her waist.</p>

<p>&quot;You've brought an apron, haven't you?&quot; she said jerkily, glancing at
Ursula. &quot;Oh - you'll want one. You've no idea what a sight you'll look
before half-past four, what with chalk and ink and kids' dirty
feet. - Well, I can send a boy down to mamma's for one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it doesn't matter,&quot; said Ursula.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes - I can send easily,&quot; cried Miss Harby.</p>

<p>Ursula's heart sank. Everybody seemed so cocksure and so bossy. How was
she going to get on with such jolty, jerky, bossy people? And Miss
Harby had not spoken a word to the man at the table. She simply ignored
him. Ursula felt the callous crude rudeness between the two teachers.</p>

<p>The two girls went out into the passage. A few children were already
clattering in the porch.</p>

<p>&quot;Jim Richards,&quot; called Miss Harby, hard and authoritative. A boy came
sheepishly forward.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall you go down to our house for me, eh?&quot; said Miss Harby, in a
commanding, condescending, coaxing voice. She did not wait for an
answer. &quot;Go down and ask mamma to send me one of my school pinas, for
Miss Brangwen - shall you?&quot;</p>

<p>The boy muttered a sheepish &quot;Yes, miss,&quot; and was moving away.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey,&quot; called Miss Harby. &quot;Come here - now what are you going for? What
shall you say to mamma?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A school pina -  - &quot; muttered the boy.</p>

<p>&quot;'Please, Mrs. Harby, Miss Harby says will you send her another school
pinafore for Miss Brangwen, because she's come without one.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, miss,&quot; muttered the boy, head ducked, and was moving off. Miss
Harby caught him back, holding him by the shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you going to say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Please, Mrs. Harby, Miss Harby wants a pinny for Miss Brangwin,&quot;
muttered the boy very sheepishly.</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Brangwen!&quot; laughed Miss Harby, pushing him away. &quot;Here, you'd
better have my umbrella - wait a minute.&quot;</p>

<p>The unwilling boy was rigged up with Miss Harby's umbrella, and set
off.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't take long over it,&quot; called Miss Harby, after him. Then she
turned to Ursula, and said brightly:</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, he's a caution, that lad - but not bad, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; Ursula agreed, weakly.</p>

<p>The latch of the door clicked, and they entered the big room. Ursula
glanced down the place. Its rigid, long silence was official and
chilling. Half-way down was a glass partition, the doors of which were
open. A clock ticked re-echoing, and Miss Harby's voice sounded double
as she said:</p>

<p>&quot;This is the big room - Standard Five-Six-and-Seven. - Here's your
place - Five -  - &quot;</p>

<p>She stood in the near end of the great room. There was a small high
teacher's desk facing a squadron of long benches, two high windows in
the wall opposite.</p>

<p>It was fascinating and horrible to Ursula. The curious, unliving light
in the room changed her character. She thought it was the rainy
morning. Then she looked up again, because of the horrid feeling of
being shut in a rigid, inflexible air, away from all feeling of the
ordinary day; and she noticed that the windows were of ribbed, suffused
glass.</p>

<p>The prison was round her now! She looked at the walls, colour washed,
pale green and chocolate, at the large windows with frowsy geraniums
against the pale glass, at the long rows of desks, arranged in a
squadron, and dread filled her. This was a new world, a new life, with
which she was threatened. But still excited, she climbed into her chair
at her teacher's desk. It was high, and her feet could not reach the
ground, but must rest on the step. Lifted up there, off the ground, she
was in office. How queer, how queer it all was! How different it was
from the mist of rain blowing over Cossethay. As she thought of her own
village, a spasm of yearning crossed her, it seemed so far off, so lost
to her.</p>

<p>She was here in this hard, stark reality - reality. It was queer that
she should call this the reality, which she had never known till
to-day, and which now so filled her with dread and dislike, that she
wished she might go away. This was the reality, and Cossethay, her
beloved, beautiful, wellknown Cossethay, which was as herself unto her,
that was minor reality. This prison of a school was reality. Here,
then, she would sit in state, the queen of scholars! Here she would
realise her dream of being the beloved teacher bringing light and joy
to her children! But the desks before her had an abstract angularity
that bruised her sentiment and made her shrink. She winced, feeling she
had been a fool in her anticipations. She had brought her feelings and
her generosity to where neither generosity nor emotion were wanted. And
already she felt rebuffed, troubled by the new atmosphere, out of
place.</p>

<p>She slid down, and they returned to the teacher's room. It was queer to
feel that one ought to alter one's personality. She was nobody, there
was no reality in herself, the reality was all outside of her, and she
must apply herself to it.</p>

<p>Mr. Harby was in the teachers' room, standing before a big, open
cupboard, in which Ursula could see piles of pink blotting-paper, heaps
of shiny new books, boxes of chalk, and bottles of coloured inks. It
looked a treasure store.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster was a short, sturdy man, with a fine head, and a heavy
jowl. Nevertheless he was good-looking, with his shapely brows and
nose, and his great, hanging moustache. He seemed absorbed in his work,
and took no notice of Ursula's entry. There was something insulting in
the way he could be so actively unaware of another person, so occupied.</p>

<p>When he had a moment of absence, he looked up from the table and said
good-morning to Ursula. There was a pleasant light in his brown eyes.
He seemed very manly and incontrovertible, like something she wanted to
push over.</p>

<p>&quot;You had a wet walk,&quot; he said to Ursula.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I don't mind, I'm used to it,&quot; she replied, with a nervous little
laugh.</p>

<p>But already he was not listening. Her words sounded ridiculous and
babbling. He was taking no notice of her.</p>

<p>&quot;You will sign your name here,&quot; he said to her, as if she were some
child - &quot;and the time when you come and go.&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula signed her name in the time book and stood back. No one took any
further notice of her. She beat her brains for something to say, but in
vain.</p>

<p>&quot;I'd let them in now,&quot; said Mr. Harby to the thin man, who was very
hastily arranging his papers.</p>

<p>The assistant teacher made no sign of acquiescence, and went on with
what he was doing. The atmosphere in the room grew tense. At the last
moment Mr. Brunt slipped into his coat.</p>

<p>&quot;You will go to the girls' lobby,&quot; said the schoolmaster to Ursula,
with a fascinating, insulting geniality, purely official and
domineering.</p>

<p>She went out and found Miss Harby, and another girl teacher, in the
porch. On the asphalt yard the rain was falling. A toneless bell
tang-tang-tanged drearily overhead, monotonously, insistently. It came
to an end. Then Mr. Brunt was seen, bare-headed, standing at the other
gate of the school yard, blowing shrill blasts on a whistle and looking
down the rainy, dreary street.</p>

<p>Boys in gangs and streams came trotting up, running past the master and
with a loud clatter of feet and voices, over the yard to the boys'
porch. Girls were running and walking through the other entrance.</p>

<p>In the porch where Ursula stood there was a great noise of girls, who
were tearing off their coats and hats, and hanging them on the racks
bristling with pegs. There was a smell of wet clothing, a tossing out
of wet, draggled hair, a noise of voices and feet.</p>

<p>The mass of girls grew greater, the rage around the pegs grew steadier,
the scholars tended to fall into little noisy gangs in the porch. Then
Violet Harby clapped her hands, clapped them louder, with a shrill
&quot;Quiet, girls, quiet!&quot;</p>

<p>There was a pause. The hubbub died down but did not cease.</p>

<p>&quot;What did I say?&quot; cried Miss Harby, shrilly.</p>

<p>There was almost complete silence. Sometimes a girl, rather late,
whirled into the porch and flung off her things.</p>

<p>&quot;Leaders - in place,&quot; commanded Miss Harby shrilly.</p>

<p>Pairs of girls in pinafores and long hair stood separate in the porch.</p>

<p>&quot;Standard Four, Five, and Six - fall in,&quot; cried Miss Harby.</p>

<p>There was a hubbub, which gradually resolved itself into three columns
of girls, two and two, standing smirking in the passage. In among the
peg-racks, other teachers were putting the lower classes into ranks.</p>

<p>Ursula stood by her own Standard Five. They were jerking their
shoulders, tossing their hair, nudging, writhing, staring, grinning,
whispering and twisting.</p>

<p>A sharp whistle was heard, and Standard Six, the biggest girls, set
off, led by Miss Harby. Ursula, with her Standard Five, followed after.
She stood beside a smirking, grinning row of girls, waiting in a narrow
passage. What she was herself she did not know.</p>

<p>Suddenly the sound of a piano was heard, and Standard Six set off
hollowly down the big room. The boys had entered by another door. The
piano played on, a march tune, Standard Five followed to the door of
the big room. Mr. Harby was seen away beyond at his desk. Mr. Brunt
guarded the other door of the room. Ursula's class pushed up. She stood
near them. They glanced and smirked and shoved.</p>

<p>&quot;Go on,&quot; said Ursula.</p>

<p>They tittered.</p>

<p>&quot;Go on,&quot; said Ursula, for the piano continued.</p>

<p>The girls broke loosely into the room. Mr. Harby, who had seemed
immersed in some occupation, away at his desk, lifted his head and
thundered:</p>

<p>&quot;Halt!&quot;</p>

<p>There was a halt, the piano stopped. The boys who were just starting
through the other door, pushed back. The harsh, subdued voice of Mr.
Brunt was heard, then the booming shout of Mr. Harby, from far down the
room:</p>

<p>&quot;Who told Standard Five girls to come in like that?&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula crimsoned. Her girls were glancing up at her, smirking their
accusation.</p>

<p>&quot;I sent them in, Mr. Harby,&quot; she said, in a clear, struggling voice.
There was a moment of silence. Then Mr. Harby roared from the distance.</p>

<p>&quot;Go back to your places, Standard Five girls.&quot;</p>

<p>The girls glanced up at Ursula, accusing, rather jeering, fugitive.
They pushed back. Ursula's heart hardened with ignominious pain.</p>

<p>&quot;Forward - march,&quot; came Mr. Brunt's voice, and the girls set off,
keeping time with the ranks of boys.</p>

<p>Ursula faced her class, some fifty-five boys and girls, who stood
filling the ranks of the desks. She felt utterly nonexistent. She had
no place nor being there. She faced the block of children.</p>

<p>Down the room she heard the rapid firing of questions. She stood before
her class not knowing what to do. She waited painfully. Her block of
children, fifty unknown faces, watched her, hostile, ready to jeer. She
felt as if she were in torture over a fire of faces. And on every side
she was naked to them. Of unutterable length and torture the seconds
went by.</p>

<p>Then she gathered courage. She heard Mr. Brunt asking questions in
mental arithmetic. She stood near to her class, so that her voice need
not be raised too much, and faltering, uncertain, she said:</p>

<p>&quot;Seven hats at twopence ha'penny each?&quot;</p>

<p>A grin went over the faces of the class, seeing her commence. She was
red and suffering. Then some hands shot up like blades, and she asked
for the answer.</p>

<p>The day passed incredibly slowly. She never knew what to do, there came
horrible gaps, when she was merely exposed to the children; and when,
relying on some pert little girl for information, she had started a
lesson, she did not know how to go on with it properly. The children
were her masters. She deferred to them. She could always hear Mr.
Brunt. Like a machine, always in the same hard, high, inhuman voice he
went on with his teaching, oblivious of everything. And before this
inhuman number of children she was always at bay. She could not get
away from it. There it was, this class of fifty collective children,
depending on her for command, for command it hated and resented. It
made her feel she could not breathe: she must suffocate, it was so
inhuman. They were so many, that they were not children. They were a
squadron. She could not speak as she would to a child, because they
were not individual children, they were a collective, inhuman thing.</p>

<p>Dinner-time came, and stunned, bewildered, solitary, she went into the
teachers' room for dinner. Never had she felt such a stranger to life
before. It seemed to her she had just disembarked from some strange
horrible state where everything was as in hell, a condition of hard,
malevolent system. And she was not really free. The afternoon drew at
her like some bondage.</p>

<p>The first week passed in a blind confusion. She did not know how to
teach, and she felt she never would know. Mr. Harby came down every now
and then to her class, to see what she was doing. She felt so
incompetent as he stood by, bullying and threatening, so unreal, that
she wavered, became neutral and non-existent. But he stood there
watching with the listening-genial smile of the eyes, that was really
threatening; he said nothing, he made her go on teaching, she felt she
had no soul in her body. Then he went away, and his going was like a
derision. The class was his class. She was a wavering substitute. He
thrashed and bullied, he was hated. But he was master. Though she was
gentle and always considerate of her class, yet they belonged to Mr.
Harby, and they did not belong to her. Like some invincible source of
the mechanism he kept all power to himself. And the class owned his
power. And in school it was power, and power alone that mattered.</p>

<p>Soon Ursula came to dread him, and at the bottom of her dread was a
seed of hate, for she despised him, yet he was master of her. Then she
began to get on. All the other teachers hated him, and fanned their
hatred among themselves. For he was master of them and the children, he
stood like a wheel to make absolute his authority over the herd. That
seemed to be his one reason in life, to hold blind authority over the
school. His teachers were his subjects as much as the scholars. Only,
because they had some authority, his instinct was to detest them.</p>

<p>Ursula could not make herself a favourite with him. From the first
moment she set hard against him. She set against Violet Harby also. Mr.
Harby was, however, too much for her, he was something she could not
come to grips with, something too strong for her. She tried to approach
him as a young, bright girl usually approaches a man, expecting a
little chivalrous courtesy. But the fact that she was a girl, a woman,
was ignored or used as a matter for contempt against her. She did not
know what she was, nor what she must be. She wanted to remain her own
responsive, personal self.</p>

<p>So she taught on. She made friends with the Standard Three teacher,
Maggie Schofield. Miss Schofield was about twenty years old, a subdued
girl who held aloof from the other teachers. She was rather beautiful,
meditative, and seemed to live in another, lovelier world.</p>

<p>Ursula took her dinner to school, and during the second week ate it in
Miss Schofield's room. Standard Three classroom stood by itself and had
windows on two sides, looking on to the playground. It was a passionate
relief to find such a retreat in the jarring school. For there were
pots of chrysanthemums and coloured leaves, and a big jar of berries:
there were pretty little pictures on the wall, photogravure
reproductions from Greuze, and Reynolds's &quot;Age of Innocence&quot;, giving an
air of intimacy; so that the room, with its window space, its smaller,
tidier desks, its touch of pictures and flowers, made Ursula at once
glad. Here at last was a little personal touch, to which she could
respond.</p>

<p>It was Monday. She had been at school a week and was getting used to
the surroundings, though she was still an entire foreigner in herself.
She looked forward to having dinner with Maggie. That was the bright
spot in the day. Maggie was so strong and remote, walking with slow,
sure steps down a hard road, carrying the dream within her. Ursula went
through the class teaching as through a meaningless daze.</p>

<p>Her class tumbled out at midday in haphazard fashion. She did not
realise what host she was gathering against herself by her superior
tolerance, her kindness and her laisseraller. They were gone, and she
was rid of them, and that was all. She hurried away to the teachers'
room.</p>

<p>Mr. Brunt was crouching at the small stove, putting a little rice
pudding into the oven. He rose then, and attentively poked in a small
saucepan on the hob with a fork. Then he replaced the saucepan lid.</p>

<p>&quot;Aren't they done?&quot; asked Ursula gaily, breaking in on his tense
absorption.</p>

<p>She always kept a bright, blithe manner, and was pleasant to all the
teachers. For she felt like the swan among the geese, of superior
heritage and belonging. And her pride at being the swan in this ugly
school was not yet abated.</p>

<p>&quot;Not yet,&quot; replied Mr. Brunt, laconic.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder if my dish is hot,&quot; she said, bending down at the oven. She
half expected him to look for her, but he took no notice. She was
hungry and she poked her finger eagerly in the pot to see if her
brussels sprouts and potatoes and meat were ready. They were not.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you think it's rather jolly bringing dinner?&quot; she said to Mr.
Brunt.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know as I do,&quot; he said, spreading a serviette on a corner of
the table, and not looking at her.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose it is too far for you to go home?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said. Then he rose and looked at her. He had the bluest,
fiercest, most pointed eyes that she had ever met. He stared at her
with growing fierceness.</p>

<p>&quot;If I were you, Miss Brangwen,&quot; he said, menacingly, &quot;I should get a
bit tighter hand over my class.&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula shrank.</p>

<p>&quot;Would you?&quot; she asked, sweetly, yet in terror. &quot;Aren't I strict
enough?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because,&quot; he repeated, taking no notice of her, &quot;they'll get you down
if you don't tackle 'em pretty quick. They'll pull you down, and worry
you, till Harby gets you shifted - that's how it'll be. You won't be
here another six weeks&quot; - and he filled his mouth with food - &quot;if you
don't tackle 'em and tackle 'em quick.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but -  - &quot; Ursula said, resentfully, ruefully. The terror was deep
in her.</p>

<p>&quot;Harby'll not help you. This is what he'll do - he'll let you go on,
getting worse and worse, till either you clear out or he clears you
out. It doesn't matter to me, except that you'll leave a class behind
you as I hope I shan't have to cope with.&quot;</p>

<p>She heard the accusation in the man's voice, and felt condemned. But
still, school had not yet become a definite reality to her. She was
shirking it. It was reality, but it was all outside her. And she fought
against Mr. Brunt's representation. She did not want to realise.</p>

<p>&quot;Will it be so terrible?&quot; she said, quivering, rather beautiful, but
with a slight touch of condescension, because she would not betray her
own trepidation.</p>

<p>&quot;Terrible?&quot; said the man, turning to his potatoes again. &quot;I dunno about
terrible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do feel frightened,&quot; said Ursula. &quot;The children seem so -  - &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; said Miss Harby, entering at that moment.</p>

<p>&quot;Why,&quot; said Ursula, &quot;Mr. Brunt says I ought to tackle my class,&quot; and
she laughed uneasily.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you have to keep order if you want to teach,&quot; said Miss Harby,
hard, superior, trite.</p>

<p>Ursula did not answer. She felt non valid before them.</p>

<p>&quot;If you want to be let to live, you have,&quot; said Mr. Brunt.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if you can't keep order, what good are you?&quot; said Miss Harby.</p>

<p>&quot;An' you've got to do it by yourself,&quot; - his voice rose like the bitter
cry of the prophets. &quot;You'll get no help from anybody.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, indeed!&quot; said Miss Harby. &quot;Some people can't be helped.&quot; And she
departed.</p>

<p>The air of hostility and disintegration, of wills working in
antagonistic subordination, was hideous. Mr. Brunt, subordinate,
afraid, acid with shame, frightened her. Ursula wanted to run. She only
wanted to clear out, not to understand.</p>

<p>Then Miss Schofield came in, and with her another, more restful note.
Ursula at once turned for confirmation to the newcomer. Maggie remained
personal within all this unclean system of authority.</p>

<p>&quot;Is the big Anderson here?&quot; she asked of Mr. Brunt. And they spoke of
some affair about two scholars, coldly, officially.</p>

<p>Miss Schofield took her brown dish, and Ursula followed with her own.
The cloth was laid in the pleasant Standard Three room, there was a jar
with two or three monthly roses on the table.</p>

<p>&quot;It is so nice in here, you have made it different,&quot; said Ursula gaily.
But she was afraid. The atmosphere of the school was upon her.</p>

<p>&quot;The big room,&quot; said Miss Schofield, &quot;ha, it's misery to be in it!&quot;</p>

<p>She too spoke with bitterness. She too lived in the ignominious
position of an upper servant hated by the master above and the class
beneath. She was, she knew, liable to attack from either side at any
minute, or from both at once, for the authorities would listen to the
complaints of parents, and both would turn round on the mongrel
authority, the teacher.</p>

<p>So there was a hard, bitter withholding in Maggie Schofield even as she
poured out her savoury mess of big golden beans and brown gravy.</p>

<p>&quot;It is vegetarian hot-pot,&quot; said Miss Schofield. &quot;Would you like to try
it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should love to,&quot; said Ursula.</p>

<p>Her own dinner seemed coarse and ugly beside this savoury, clean dish.</p>

<p>&quot;I've never eaten vegetarian things,&quot; she said. &quot;But I should think
they can be good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not really a vegetarian,&quot; said Maggie, &quot;I don't like to bring meat
to school.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Ursula, &quot;I don't think I do either.&quot;</p>

<p>And again her soul rang an answer to a new refinement, a new liberty.
If all vegetarian things were as nice as this, she would be glad to
escape the slight uncleanness of meat.</p>

<p>&quot;How good!&quot; she cried.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Miss Schofield, and she proceeded to tell her the receipt.
The two girls passed on to talk about themselves. Ursula told all about
the High School, and about her matriculation, bragging a little. She
felt so poor here, in this ugly place. Miss Schofield listened with
brooding, handsome face, rather gloomy.</p>

<p>&quot;Couldn't you have got to some better place than this?&quot; she asked at
length.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't know what it was like,&quot; said Ursula, doubtfully.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Miss Schofield, and she turned aside her head with a bitter
motion.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it as horrid as it seems?&quot; asked Ursula, frowning lightly, in fear.</p>

<p>&quot;It is,&quot; said Miss Schofield, bitterly. &quot;Ha! - it is hateful!&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula's heart sank, seeing even Miss Schofield in the deadly bondage.</p>

<p>&quot;It is Mr. Harby,&quot; said Maggie Schofield, breaking forth.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think I could live again in the big room - Mr. Brunt's voice
and Mr. Harby - ah -  - &quot;</p>

<p>She turned aside her head with a deep hurt. Some things she could not
bear.</p>

<p>&quot;Is Mr. Harby really horrid?&quot; asked Ursula, venturing into her own
dread.</p>

<p>&quot;He! - why, he's just a bully,&quot; said Miss Schofield, raising her shamed
dark eyes, that flamed with tortured contempt. &quot;He's not bad as long as
you keep in with him, and refer to him, and do everything in his
way - but - it's all so mean! It's just a question of fighting on both
sides - and those great louts -  - &quot;</p>

<p>She spoke with difficulty and with increased bitterness. She had
evidently suffered. Her soul was raw with ignominy. Ursula suffered in
response.</p>

<p>&quot;But why is it so horrid?&quot; she asked, helplessly.</p>

<p>&quot;You can't do anything,&quot; said Miss Schofield. &quot;He's against you on one
side and he sets the children against you on the other. The children
are simply awful. You've got to make them do everything. Everything,
everything has got to come out of you. Whatever they learn, you've got
to force it into them - and that's how it is.&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula felt her heart fail inside her. Why must she grasp all this, why
must she force learning on fifty-five reluctant children, having all
the time an ugly, rude jealousy behind her, ready to throw her to the
mercy of the herd of children, who would like to rend her as a weaker
representative of authority. A great dread of her task possessed her.
She saw Mr. Brunt, Miss Harby, Miss Schofield, all the school-
teachers, drudging unwillingly at the graceless task of compelling many
children into one disciplined, mechanical set, reducing the whole set
to an automatic state of obedience and attention, and then of
commanding their acceptance of various pieces of knowledge. The first
great task was to reduce sixty children to one state of mind, or being.
This state must be produced automatically, through the will of the
teacher, and the will of the whole school authority, imposed upon the
will of the children. The point was that the headmaster and the
teachers should have one will in authority, which should bring the will
of the children into accord. But the headmaster was narrow and
exclusive. The will of the teachers could not agree with his, their
separate wills refused to be so subordinated. So there was a state of
anarchy, leaving the final judgment to the children themselves, which
authority should exist.</p>

<p>So there existed a set of separate wills, each straining itself to the
utmost to exert its own authority. Children will never naturally
acquiesce to sitting in a class and submitting to knowledge. They must
be compelled by a stronger, wiser will. Against which will they must
always strive to revolt. So that the first great effort of every
teacher of a large class must be to bring the will of the children into
accordance with his own will. And this he can only do by an abnegation
of his personal self, and an application of a system of laws, for the
purpose of achieving a certain calculable result, the imparting of
certain knowledge. Whereas Ursula thought she was going to become the
first wise teacher by making the whole business personal, and using no
compulsion. She believed entirely in her own personality.</p>

<p>So that she was in a very deep mess. In the first place she was
offering to a class a relationship which only one or two of the
children were sensitive enough to appreciate, so that the mass were
left outsiders, therefore against her. Secondly, she was placing
herself in passive antagonism to the one fixed authority of Mr. Harby,
so that the scholars could more safely harry her. She did not know, but
her instinct gradually warned her. She was tortured by the voice of Mr.
Brunt. On it went, jarring, harsh, full of hate, but so monotonous, it
nearly drove her mad: always the same set, harsh monotony. The man was
become a mechanism working on and on and on. But the personal man was
in subdued friction all the time. It was horrible - all hate! Must she
be like this? She could feel the ghastly necessity. She must become the
same - put away the personal self, become an instrument, an
abstraction, working upon a certain material, the class, to achieve a
set purpose of making them know so much each day. And she could not
submit. Yet gradually she felt the invincible iron closing upon her.
The sun was being blocked out. Often when she went out at playtime and
saw a luminous blue sky with changing clouds, it seemed just a fantasy,
like a piece of painted scenery. Her heart was so black and tangled in
the teaching, her personal self was shut in prison, abolished, she was
subjugate to a bad, destructive will. How then could the sky be
shining? There was no sky, there was no luminous atmosphere of
out-of-doors. Only the inside of the school was real - hard, concrete,
real and vicious.</p>

<p>She would not yet, however, let school quite overcome her. She always
said. &quot;It is not a permanency, it will come to an end.&quot; She could
always see herself beyond the place, see the time when she had left it.
On Sundays and on holidays, when she was away at Cossethay or in the
woods where the beech-leaves were fallen, she could think of St.
Philip's Church School, and by an effort of will put it in the picture
as a dirty little low-squatting building that made a very tiny mound
under the sky, while the great beech-woods spread immense about her,
and the afternoon was spacious and wonderful. Moreover the children,
the scholars, they were insignificant little objects far away, oh, far
away. And what power had they over her free soul? A fleeting thought of
them, as she kicked her way through the beech-leaves, and they were
gone. But her will was tense against them all the time.</p>

<p>All the while, they pursued her. She had never had such a passionate
love of the beautiful things about her. Sitting on top of the tram-car,
at evening, sometimes school was swept away as she saw a magnificent
sky settling down. And her breast, her very hands, clamoured for the
lovely flare of sunset. It was poignant almost to agnoy, her reaching
for it. She almost cried aloud seeing the sundown so lovely.</p>

<p>For she was held away. It was no matter how she said to herself that
school existed no more once she had left it. It existed. It was within
her like a dark weight, controlling her movement. It was in vain the
high-spirited, proud young girl flung off the school and its
association with her. She was Miss Brangwen, she was Standard Five
teacher, she had her most important being in her work now.</p>

<p>Constantly haunting her, like a darkness hovering over her heart and
threatening to swoop down over it at every moment, was the sense that
somehow, somehow she was brought down. Bitterly she denied unto herself
that she was really a schoolteacher. Leave that to the Violet Harbys.
She herself would stand clear of the accusation. It was in vain she
denied it.</p>

<p>Within herself some recording hand seemed to point mechanically to a
negation. She was incapable of fulfilling her task. She could never for
a moment escape from the fatal weight of the knowledge.</p>

<p>And so she felt inferior to Violet Harby. Miss Harby was a splendid
teacher. She could keep order and inflict knowledge on a class with
remarkable efficiency. It was no good Ursula's protesting to herself
that she was infinitely, infinitely the superior of Violet Harby. She
knew that Violet Harby succeeded where she failed, and this in a task
which was almost a test of her. She felt something all the time wearing
upon her, wearing her down. She went about in these first weeks trying
to deny it, to say she was free as ever. She tried not to feel at a
disadvantage before Miss Harby, tried to keep up the effect of her own
superiority. But a great weight was on her, which Violet Harby could
bear, and she herself could not.</p>

<p>Though she did not give in, she never succeeded. Her class was getting
in worse condition, she knew herself less and less secure in teaching
it. Ought she to withdraw and go home again? Ought she to say she had
come to the wrong place, and so retire? Her very life was at test.</p>

<p>She went on doggedly, blindly, waiting for a crisis. Mr. Harby had now
begun to persecute her. Her dread and hatred of him grew and loomed
larger and larger. She was afraid he was going to bully her and destroy
her. He began to persecute her because she could not keep her class in
proper condition, because her class was the weak link in the chain
which made up the school.</p>

<p>One of the offences was that her class was noisy and disturbed Mr.
Harby, as he took Standard Seven at the other end of the room. She was
taking composition on a certain morning, walking in among the scholars.
Some of the boys had dirty ears and necks, their clothing smelled
unpleasantly, but she could ignore it. She corrected the writing as she
went.</p>

<p>&quot;When you say 'their fur is brown', how do you write 'their'?&quot; she
asked.</p>

<p>There was a little pause; the boys were always jeeringly backward in
answering. They had begun to jeer at her authority altogether.</p>

<p>&quot;Please, miss, t-h-e-i-r&quot;, spelled a lad, loudly, with a note of
mockery.</p>

<p>At that moment Mr. Harby was passing.</p>

<p>&quot;Stand up, Hill!&quot; he called, in a big voice.</p>

<p>Everybody started. Ursula watched the boy. He was evidently poor, and
rather cunning. A stiff bit of hair stood straight off his forehead,
the rest fitted close to his meagre head. He was pale and colourless.</p>

<p>&quot;Who told you to call out?&quot; thundered Mr. Harby.</p>

<p>The boy looked up and down, with a guilty air, and a cunning, cynical
reserve.</p>

<p>&quot;Please, sir, I was answering,&quot; he replied, with the same humble
insolence.</p>

<p>&quot;Go to my desk.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy set off down the room, the big black jacket hanging in dejected
folds about him, his thin legs, rather knocked at the knees, going
already with the pauper's crawl, his feet in their big boots scarcely
lifted. Ursula watched him in his crawling, slinking progress down the
room. He was one of her boys! When he got to the desk, he looked round,
half furtively, with a sort of cunning grin and a pathetic leer at the
big boys in Standard VII. Then, pitiable, pale, in his dejected
garments, he lounged under the menace of the headmaster's desk, with
one thin leg crooked at the knee and the foot struck out sideways his
hands in the low-hanging pockets of his man's jacket.</p>

<p>Ursula tried to get her attention back to the class. The boy gave her a
little horror, and she was at the same time hot with pity for him. She
felt she wanted to scream. She was responsible for the boy's
punishment. Mr. Harby was looking at her handwriting on the board. He
turned to the class.</p>

<p>&quot;Pens down.&quot;</p>

<p>The children put down their pens and looked up.</p>

<p>&quot;Fold arms.&quot;</p>

<p>They pushed back their books and folded arms.</p>

<p>Ursula, stuck among the back forms, could not extricate herself.</p>

<p>&quot;What is your composition about?&quot; asked the headmaster. Every hand shot
up. &quot;The  -  - &quot; stuttered some voice in its eagerness to answer.</p>

<p>&quot;I wouldn't advise you to call out,&quot; said Mr. Harby. He would have a
pleasant voice, full and musical, but for the detestable menace that
always tailed in it. He stood unmoved, his eyes twinkling under his
bushy black eyebrows, watching the class. There was something
fascinating in him, as he stood, and again she wanted to scream. She
was all jarred, she did not know what she felt.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Alice?&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;The rabbit,&quot; piped a girl's voice.</p>

<p>&quot;A very easy subject for Standard Five.&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula felt a slight shame of incompetence. She was exposed before the
class. And she was tormented by the contradictoriness of everything.
Mr. Harby stood so strong, and so male, with his black brows and clear
forehead, the heavy jaw, the big, overhanging moustache: such a man,
with strength and male power, and a certain blind, native beauty. She
might have liked him as a man. And here he stood in some other
capacity, bullying over such a trifle as a boy's speaking out without
permission. Yet he was not a little, fussy man. He seemed to have some
cruel, stubborn, evil spirit, he was imprisoned in a task too small and
petty for him, which yet, in a servile acquiescence, he would fulfil,
because he had to earn his living. He had no finer control over
himself, only this blind, dogged, wholesale will. He would keep the job
going, since he must. And this job was to make the children spell the
word &quot;caution&quot; correctly, and put a capital letter after a full-stop.
So at this he hammered with his suppressed hatred, always suppressing
himself, till he was beside himself. Ursula suffered, bitterly as he
stood, short and handsome and powerful, teaching her class. It seemed
such a miserable thing for him to be doing. He had a decent, powerful,
rude soul. What did he care about the composition on &quot;The Rabbit&quot;? Yet
his will kept him there before the class, threshing the trivial
subject. It was habit with him now, to be so little and vulgar, out of
place. She saw the shamefulness of his position, felt the fettered
wickedness in him which would blaze out into evil rage in the long run,
so that he was like a persistent, strong creature tethered. It was
really intolerable. The jarring was torture to her. She looked over the
silent, attentive class that seemed to have crystallised into order and
rigid, neutral form. This he had it in his power to do, to crystallise
the children into hard, mute fragments, fixed under his will: his brute
will, which fixed them by sheer force.</p>

<p>She too must learn to subdue them to her will: she must. For it was her
duty, since the school was such. He had crystallised the class into
order. But to see him, a strong, powerful man, using all his power for
such a purpose, seemed almost horrible. There was something hideous
about it. The strange, genial light in his eye was really vicious, and
ugly, his smile was one of torture. He could not be impersonal. He
could not have a clear, pure purpose, he could only exercise his own
brute will. He did not believe in the least in the education he kept
inflicting year after year upon the children. So he must bully, only
bully, even while it tortured his strong, wholesome nature with shame
like a spur always galling. He was so blind and ugly and out of place.
Ursula could not bear it as he stood there. The whole situation was
wrong and ugly.</p>

<p>The lesson was finished, Mr. Harby went away. At the far end of the
room she heard the whistle and the thud of the cane. Her heart stood
still within her. She could not bear it, no, she could not bear it when
the boy was beaten. It made her sick. She felt that she must go out of
this school, this torture-place. And she hated the schoolmaster,
thoroughly and finally. The brute, had he no shame? He should never be
allowed to continue the atrocity of this bullying cruelty. Then Hill
came crawling back, blubbering piteously. There was something desolate
about this blubbering that nearly broke her heart. For after all, if
she had kept her class in proper discipline, this would never have
happened, Hill would never have called out and been caned.</p>

<p>She began the arithmetic lesson. But she was distracted. The boy Hill
sat away on the back desk, huddled up, blubbering and sucking his hand.
It was a long time. She dared not go near, nor speak to him. She felt
ashamed before him. And she felt she could not forgive the boy for
being the huddled, blubbering object, all wet and snivelled, which he
was.</p>

<p>She went on correcting the sums. But there were too many children. She
could not get round the class. And Hill was on her conscience. At last
he had stopped crying, and sat bunched over his hands, playing quietly.
Then he looked up at her. His face was dirty with tears, his eyes had a
curious washed look, like the sky after rain, a sort of wanness. He
bore no malice. He had already forgotten, and was waiting to be
restored to the normal position.</p>

<p>&quot;Go on with your work, Hill,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>The children were playing over their arithmetic, and, she knew,
cheating thoroughly. She wrote another sum on the blackboard. She could
not get round the class. She went again to the front to watch. Some
were ready. Some were not. What was she to do?</p>

<p>At last it was time for recreation. She gave the order to cease
working, and in some way or other got her class out of the room. Then
she faced the disorderly litter of blotted, uncorrected books, of
broken rulers and chewed pens. And her heart sank in sickness. The
misery was getting deeper.</p>

<p>The trouble went on and on, day after day. She had always piles of
books to mark, myriads of errors to correct, a heart-wearying task that
she loathed. And the work got worse and worse. When she tried to
flatter herself that the composition grew more alive, more interesting,
she had to see that the handwriting grew more and more slovenly, the
books more filthy and disgraceful. She tried what she could, but it was
of no use. But she was not going to take it seriously. Why should she?
Why should she say to herself, that it mattered, if she failed to teach
a class to write perfectly neatly? Why should she take the blame unto
herself?</p>

<p>Pay day came, and she received four pounds two shillings and one penny.
She was very proud that day. She had never had so much money before.
And she had earned it all herself. She sat on the top of the tram-car
fingering the gold and fearing she might lose it. She felt so
established and strong, because of it. And when she got home she said
to her mother:</p>

<p>&quot;It is pay day to-day, mother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; said her mother, coolly.</p>

<p>Then Ursula put down fifty shillings on the table.</p>

<p>&quot;That is my board,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; said her mother, letting it lie.</p>

<p>Ursula was hurt. Yet she had paid her scot. She was free. She paid for
what she had. There remained moreover thirty-two shillings of her own.
She would not spend any, she who was naturally a spendthrift, because
she could not bear to damage her fine gold.</p>

<p>She had a standing ground now apart from her parents. She was something
else besides the mere daughter of William and Anna Brangwen. She was
independent. She earned her own living. She was an important member of
the working community. She was sure that fifty shillings a month quite
paid for her keep. If her mother received fifty shillings a month for
each of the children, she would have twenty pounds a month and no
clothes to provide. Very well then.</p>

<p>Ursula was independent of her parents. She now adhered elsewhere. Now,
the 'Board of Education' was a phrase that rang significant to her, and
she felt Whitehall far beyond her as her ultimate home. In the
government, she knew which minister had supreme control over Education,
and it seemed to her that, in some way, he was connected with her, as
her father was connected with her.</p>

<p>She had another self, another responsibility. She was no longer Ursula
Brangwen, daughter of William Brangwen. She was also Standard Five
teacher in St. Philip's School. And it was a case now of being Standard
Five teacher, and nothing else. For she could not escape.</p>

<p>Neither could she succeed. That was her horror. As the weeks passed on,
there was no Ursula Brangwen, free and jolly. There was only a girl of
that name obsessed by the fact that she could not manage her class of
children. At week-ends there came days of passionate reaction, when she
went mad with the taste of liberty, when merely to be free in the
morning, to sit down at her embroidery and stitch the coloured silks
was a passion of delight. For the prison house was always awaiting her!
This was only a respite, as her chained heart knew well. So that she
seized hold of the swift hours of the week-end, and wrung the last drop
of sweetness out of them, in a little, cruel frenzy.</p>

<p>She did not tell anybody how this state was a torture to her. She did
not confide, either to Gudrun or to her parents, how horrible she found
it to be a school-teacher. But when Sunday night came, and she felt the
Monday morning at hand, she was strung up tight with dreadful
anticipation, because the strain and the torture was near again.</p>

<p>She did not believe that she could ever teach that great, brutish
class, in that brutal school: ever, ever. And yet, if she failed, she
must in some way go under. She must admit that the man's world was too
strong for her, she could not take her place in it; she must go down
before Mr. Harby. And all her life henceforth, she must go on, never
having freed herself of the man's world, never having achieved the
freedom of the great world of responsible work. Maggie had taken her
place there, she had even stood level with Mr. Harby and got free of
him: and her soul was always wandering in far-off valleys and glades of
poetry. Maggie was free. Yet there was something like subjection in
Maggie's very freedom. Mr. Harby, the man, disliked the reserved woman,
Maggie. Mr. Harby, the schoolmaster, respected his teacher, Miss
Schofield.</p>

<p>For the present, however, Ursula only envied and admired Maggie. She
herself had still to get where Maggie had got. She had still to make
her footing. She had taken up a position on Mr. Harby's ground, and she
must keep it. For he was now beginning a regular attack on her, to
drive her away out of his school. She could not keep order. Her class
was a turbulent crowd, and the weak spot in the school's work.
Therefore she must go, and someone more useful must come in her place,
someone who could keep discipline.</p>

<p>The headmaster had worked himself into an obsession of fury against
her. He only wanted her gone. She had come, she had got worse as the
weeks went on, she was absolutely no good. His system, which was his
very life in school, the outcome of his bodily movement, was attacked
and threatened at the point where Ursula was included. She was the
danger that threatened his body with a blow, a fall. And blindly,
thoroughly, moving from strong instinct of opposition, he set to work
to expel her.</p>

<p>When he punished one of her children as he had punished the boy Hill,
for an offence against himself, he made the punishment extra heavy with
the significance that the extra stroke came in because of the weak
teacher who allowed all these things to be. When he punished for an
offence against her, he punished lightly, as if offences against her
were not significant. Which all the children knew, and they behaved
accordingly.</p>

<p>Every now and again Mr. Harby would swoop down to examine exercise
books. For a whole hour, he would be going round the class, taking book
after book, comparing page after page, whilst Ursula stood aside for
all the remarks and fault-finding to be pointed at her through the
scholars. It was true, since she had come, the composition books had
grown more and more untidy, disorderly, filthy. Mr. Harby pointed to
the pages done before her regime, and to those done after, and fell
into a passion of rage. Many children he sent out to the front with
their books. And after he had thoroughly gone through the silent and
quivering class he caned the worst offenders well, in front of the
others, thundering in real passion of anger and chagrin.</p>

<p>&quot;Such a condition in a class, I can't believe it! It is simply
disgraceful! I can't think how you have been let to get like it! Every
Monday morning I shall come down and examine these books. So don't
think that because there is nobody paying any attention to you, that
you are free to unlearn everything you ever learned, and go back till
you are not fit for Standard Three. I shall examine all books every
Monday -  - &quot;</p>

<p>Then in a rage, he went away with his cane, leaving Ursula to confront
a pale, quivering class, whose childish faces were shut in blank
resentment, fear, and bitterness, whose souls were full of anger and
contempt for her rather than of the master, whose eyes looked at her
with the cold, inhuman accusation of children. And she could hardly
make mechanical words to speak to them. When she gave an order they
obeyed with an insolent off-handedness, as if to say: &quot;As for you, do
you think we would obey you, but for the master?&quot; She sent the
blubbering, caned boys to their seats, knowing that they too jeered at
her and her authority, holding her weakness responsible for what
punishment had overtaken them. And she knew the whole position, so that
even her horror of physical beating and suffering sank to a deeper
pain, and became a moral judgment upon her, worse than any hurt.</p>

<p>She must, during the next week, watch over her books, and punish any
fault. Her soul decided it coldly. Her personal desire was dead for
that day at least. She must have nothing more of herself in school. She
was to be Standard Five teacher only. That was her duty. In school, she
was nothing but Standard Five teacher. Ursula Brangwen must be
excluded.</p>

<p>So that, pale, shut, at last distant and impersonal, she saw no longer
the child, how his eyes danced, or how he had a queer little soul that
could not be bothered with shaping handwriting so long as he dashed
down what he thought. She saw no children, only the task that was to be
done. And keeping her eyes there, on the task, and not on the child,
she was impersonal enough to punish where she could otherwise only have
sympathised, understood, and condoned, to approve where she would have
been merely uninterested before. But her interest had no place any
more.</p>

<p>It was agony to the impulsive, bright girl of seventeen to become
distant and official, having no personal relationship with the
children. For a few days, after the agony of the Monday, she succeeded,
and had some success with her class. But it was a state not natural to
her, and she began to relax.</p>

<p>Then came another infliction. There were not enough pens to go round
the class. She sent to Mr. Harby for more. He came in person.</p>

<p>&quot;Not enough pens, Miss Brangwen?&quot; he said, with the smile and calm of
exceeding rage against her.</p>

<p>&quot;No, we are six short,&quot; she said, quaking.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, how is that?&quot; he said, menacingly. Then, looking over the class,
he asked:</p>

<p>&quot;How many are there here to-day?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fifty-two,&quot; said Ursula, but he did not take any notice, counting for
himself.</p>

<p>&quot;Fifty-two,&quot; he said. &quot;And how many pens are there, Staples?&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula was now silent. He would not heed her if she answered, since he
had addressed the monitor.</p>

<p>&quot;That's a very curious thing,&quot; said Mr. Harby, looking over the silent
class with a slight grin of fury. All the childish faces looked up at
him blank and exposed.</p>

<p>&quot;A few days ago there were sixty pens for this class - now there are
forty-eight. What is forty-eight from sixty, Williams?&quot; There was a
sinister suspense in the question. A thin, ferret-faced boy in a sailor
suit started up exaggeratedly.</p>

<p>&quot;Please, sir!&quot; he said. Then a slow, sly grin came over his face. He
did not know. There was a tense silence. The boy dropped his head. Then
he looked up again, a little cunning triumph in his eyes. &quot;Twelve,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p>&quot;I would advise you to attend,&quot; said the headmaster dangerously. The
boy sat down.</p>

<p>&quot;Forty-eight from sixty is twelve: so there are twelve pens to account
for. Have you looked for them, Staples?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then look again.&quot;</p>

<p>The scene dragged on. Two pens were found: ten were missing. Then the
storm burst.</p>

<p>&quot;Am I to have you thieving, besides your dirt and bad work and bad
behaviour?&quot; the headmaster began. &quot;Not content with being the
worst-behaved and dirtiest class in the school, you are thieves into
the bargain, are you? It is a very funny thing! Pens don't melt into
the air: pens are not in the habit of mizzling away into nothing. What
has become of them then? They must be somewhere. What has become of
them? For they must be found, and found by Standard Five. They were
lost by Standard Five, and they must be found.&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula stood and listened, her heart hard and cold. She was so much
upset, that she felt almost mad. Something in her tempted her to turn
on the headmaster and tell him to stop, about the miserable pens. But
she did not. She could not.</p>

<p>After every session, morning and evening, she had the pens counted.
Still they were missing. And pencils and india-rubbers disappeared. She
kept the class staying behind, till the things were found. But as soon
as Mr. Harby had gone out of the room, the boys began to jump about and
shout, and at last they bolted in a body from the school.</p>

<p>This was drawing near a crisis. She could not tell Mr. Harby because,
while he would punish the class, he would make her the cause of the
punishment, and her class would pay her back with disobedience and
derision. Already there was a deadly hostility grown up between her and
the children. After keeping in the class, at evening, to finish some
work, she would find boys dodging behind her, calling after her:
&quot;Brangwen, Brangwen - Proud-acre.&quot;</p>

<p>When she went into Ilkeston of a Saturday morning with Gudrun, she
heard again the voices yelling after her:</p>

<p>&quot;Brangwen, Brangwen.&quot;</p>

<p>She pretended to take no notice, but she coloured with shame at being
held up to derision in the public street. She, Ursula Brangwen of
Cossethay, could not escape from the Standard Five teacher which she
was. In vain she went out to buy ribbon for her hat. They called after
her, the boys she tried to teach.</p>

<p>And one evening, as she went from the edge of the town into the
country, stones came flying at her. Then the passion of shame and anger
surpassed her. She walked on unheeding, beside herself. Because of the
darkness she could not see who were those that threw. But she did not
want to know.</p>

<p>Only in her soul a change took place. Never more, and never more would
she give herself as individual to her class. Never would she, Ursula
Brangwen, the girl she was, the person she was, come into contact with
those boys. She would be Standard Five teacher, as far away personally
from her class as if she had never set foot in St. Philip's school. She
would just obliterate them all, and keep herself apart, take them as
scholars only.</p>

<p>So her face grew more and more shut, and over her flayed, exposed soul
of a young girl who had gone open and warm to give herself to the
children, there set a hard, insentient thing, that worked mechanically
according to a system imposed.</p>

<p>It seemed she scarcely saw her class the next day. She could only feel
her will, and what she would have of this class which she must grasp
into subjection. It was no good, any more, to appeal, to play upon the
better feelings of the class. Her swift-working soul realised this.</p>

<p>She, as teacher, must bring them all as scholars, into subjection. And
this she was going to do. All else she would forsake. She had become
hard and impersonal, almost avengeful on herself as well as on them,
since the stone throwing. She did not want to be a person, to be
herself any more, after such humiliation. She would assert herself for
mastery, be only teacher. She was set now. She was going to fight and
subdue.</p>

<p>She knew by now her enemies in the class. The one she hated most was
Williams. He was a sort of defective, not bad enough to be so classed.
He could read with fluency, and had plenty of cunning intelligence. But
he could not keep still. And he had a kind of sickness very repulsive
to a sensitive girl, something cunning and etiolated and degenerate.
Once he had thrown an ink-well at her, in one of his mad little rages.
Twice he had run home out of class. He was a well-known character.</p>

<p>And he grinned up his sleeve at this girl-teacher, sometimes hanging
round her to fawn on her. But this made her dislike him more. He had a
kind of leech-like power.</p>

<p>From one of the children she took a supple cane, and this she
determined to use when real occasion came. One morning, at composition,
she said to the boy Williams:</p>

<p>&quot;Why have you made this blot?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Please, miss, it fell off my pen,&quot; he whined out, in the mocking voice
that he was so clever in using. The boys near snorted with laughter.
For Williams was an actor, he could tickle the feelings of his hearers
subtly. Particularly he could tickle the children with him into
ridiculing his teacher, or indeed, any authority of which he was not
afraid. He had that peculiar gaol instinct.</p>

<p>&quot;Then you must stay in and finish another page of composition,&quot; said
the teacher.</p>

<p>This was against her usual sense of justice, and the boy resented it
derisively. At twelve o'clock she caught him slinking out.</p>

<p>&quot;Williams, sit down,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>And there she sat, and there he sat, alone, opposite to her, on the
back desk, looking up at her with his furtive eyes every minute.</p>

<p>&quot;Please, miss, I've got to go an errand,&quot; he called out insolently.</p>

<p>&quot;Bring me your book,&quot; said Ursula.</p>

<p>The boy came out, flapping his book along the desks. He had not written
a line.</p>

<p>&quot;Go back and do the writing you have to do,&quot; said Ursula. And she sat
at her desk, trying to correct books. She was trembling and upset. And
for an hour the miserable boy writhed and grinned in his seat. At the
end of that time he had done five lines.</p>

<p>&quot;As it is so late now,&quot; said Ursula, &quot;you will finish the rest this
evening.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy kicked his way insolently down the passage.</p>

<p>The afternoon came again. Williams was there, glancing at her, and her
heart beat thick, for she knew it was a fight between them. She watched
him.</p>

<p>During the geography lesson, as she was pointing to the map with her
cane, the boy continually ducked his whitish head under the desk, and
attracted the attention of other boys.</p>

<p>&quot;Williams,&quot; she said, gathering her courage, for it was critical now to
speak to him, &quot;what are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>He lifted his face, the sore-rimmed eyes half smiling. There was
something intrinsically indecent about him. Ursula shrank away.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; he replied, feeling a triumph.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing?&quot; she repeated, her heart-beat suffocating her.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; replied the boy, insolently, aggrieved, comic.</p>

<p>&quot;If I speak to you again, you must go down to Mr. Harby,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>But this boy was a match even for Mr. Harby. He was so persistent, so
cringing, and flexible, he howled so when he was hurt, that the master
hated more the teacher who sent him than he hated the boy himself. For
of the boy he was sick of the sight. Which Williams knew. He grinned
visibly.</p>

<p>Ursula turned to the map again, to go on with the geography lesson. But
there was a little ferment in the class. Williams' spirit infected them
all. She heard a scuffle, and then she trembled inwardly. If they all
turned on her this time, she was beaten.</p>

<p>&quot;Please, miss -  - &quot; called a voice in distress.</p>

<p>She turned round. One of the boys she liked was ruefully holding out a
torn celluloid collar. She heard the complaint, feeling futile.</p>

<p>&quot;Go in front, Wright,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>She was trembling in every fibre. A big, sullen boy, not bad but very
difficult, slouched out to the front. She went on with the lesson,
aware that Williams was making faces at Wright, and that Wright was
grinning behind her. She was afraid. She turned to the map again. And
she was afraid.</p>

<p>&quot;Please, miss, Williams -  - &quot; came a sharp cry, and a boy on the back
row was standing up, with drawn, pained brows, half a mocking grin on
his pain, half real resentment against Williams - &quot;Please, miss, he's
nipped me,&quot; - and he rubbed his leg ruefully.</p>

<p>&quot;Come in front, Williams,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>The rat-like boy sat with his pale smile and did not move.</p>

<p>&quot;Come in front,&quot; she repeated, definite now.</p>

<p>&quot;I shan't,&quot; he cried, snarling, rat-like, grinning. Something went
click in Ursula's soul. Her face and eyes set, she went through the
class straight. The boy cowered before her glowering, fixed eyes. But
she advanced on him, seized him by the arm, and dragged him from his
seat. He clung to the form. It was the battle between him and her. Her
instinct had suddenly become calm and quick. She jerked him from his
grip, and dragged him, struggling and kicking, to the front. He kicked
her several times, and clung to the forms as he passed, but she went
on. The class was on its feet in excitement. She saw it, and made no
move.</p>

<p>She knew if she let go the boy he would dash to the door. Already he
had run home once out of her class. So she snatched her cane from the
desk, and brought it down on him. He was writhing and kicking. She saw
his face beneath her, white, with eyes like the eyes of a fish, stony,
yet full of hate and horrible fear. And she loathed him, the hideous
writhing thing that was nearly too much for her. In horror lest he
should overcome her, and yet at the heart quite calm, she brought down
the cane again and again, whilst he struggled making inarticulate
noises, and lunging vicious kicks at her. With one hand she managed to
hold him, and now and then the cane came down on him. He writhed, like
a mad thing. But the pain of the strokes cut through his writhing,
vicious, coward's courage, bit deeper, till at last, with a long
whimper that became a yell, he went limp. She let him go, and he rushed
at her, his teeth and eyes glinting. There was a second of agonised
terror in her heart: he was a beast thing. Then she caught him, and the
cane came down on him. A few times, madly, in a frenzy, he lunged and
writhed, to kick her. But again the cane broke him, he sank with a
howling yell on the floor, and like a beaten beast lay there yelling.</p>

<p>Mr. Harby had rushed up towards the end of this performance.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter?&quot; he roared.</p>

<p>Ursula felt as if something were going to break in her.</p>

<p>&quot;I've thrashed him,&quot; she said, her breast heaving, forcing out the
words on the last breath. The headmaster stood choked with rage,
helpless. She looked at the writhing, howling figure on the floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Get up,&quot; she said. The thing writhed away from her. She took a step
forward. She had realised the presence of the headmaster for one
second, and then she was oblivious of it again.</p>

<p>&quot;Get up,&quot; she said. And with a little dart the boy was on his feet. His
yelling dropped to a mad blubber. He had been in a frenzy.</p>

<p>&quot;Go and stand by the radiator,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>As if mechanically, blubbering, he went.</p>

<p>The headmaster stood robbed of movement or speech. His face was yellow,
his hands twitched convulsively. But Ursula stood stiff not far from
him. Nothing could touch her now: she was beyond Mr. Harby. She was as
if violated to death.</p>

<p>The headmaster muttered something, turned, and went down the room,
whence, from the far end, he was heard roaring in a mad rage at his own
class.</p>

<p>The boy blubbered wildly by the radiator. Ursula looked at the class.
There were fifty pale, still faces watching her, a hundred round eyes
fixed on her in an attentive, expressionless stare.</p>

<p>&quot;Give out the history readers,&quot; she said to the monitors.</p>

<p>There was dead silence. As she stood there, she could hear again the
ticking of the clock, and the chock of piles of books taken out of the
low cupboard. Then came the faint flap of books on the desks. The
children passed in silence, their hands working in unison. They were no
longer a pack, but each one separated into a silent, closed thing.</p>

<p>&quot;Take page 125, and read that chapter,&quot; said Ursula.</p>

<p>There was a click of many books opened. The children found the page,
and bent their heads obediently to read. And they read, mechanically.</p>

<p>Ursula, who was trembling violently, went and sat in her high chair.
The blubbering of the boy continued. The strident voice of Mr. Brunt,
the roar of Mr. Harby, came muffled through the glass partition. And
now and then a pair of eyes rose from the reading-book, rested on her a
moment, watchful, as if calculating impersonally, then sank again.</p>

<p>She sat still without moving, her eyes watching the class, unseeing.
She was quite still, and weak. She felt that she could not raise her
hand from the desk. If she sat there for ever, she felt she could not
move again, nor utter a command. It was a quarter-past four. She almost
dreaded the closing of the school, when she would be alone.</p>

<p>The class began to recover its ease, the tension relaxed. Williams was
still crying. Mr. Brunt was giving orders for the closing of the
lesson. Ursula got down.</p>

<p>&quot;Take your place, Williams,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He dragged his feet across the room, wiping his face on his sleeve. As
he sat down, he glanced at her furtively, his eyes still redder. Now he
looked like some beaten rat.</p>

<p>At last the children were gone. Mr. Harby trod by heavily, without
looking her way, or speaking. Mr. Brunt hesitated as she was locking
her cupboard.</p>

<p>&quot;If you settle Clarke and Letts in the same way, Miss Brangwen, you'll
be all right,&quot; he said, his blue eyes glancing down in a strange
fellowship, his long nose pointing at her.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall I?&quot; she laughed nervously. She did not want anybody to talk to
her.</p>

<p>As she went along the street, clattering on the granite pavement, she
was aware of boys dodging behind her. Something struck her hand that
was carrying her bag, bruising her. As it rolled away she saw that it
was a potato. Her hand was hurt, but she gave no sign. Soon she would
take the tram.</p>

<p>She was afraid, and strange. It was to her quite strange and ugly, like
some dream where she was degraded. She would have died rather than
admit it to anybody. She could not look at her swollen hand. Something
had broken in her; she had passed a crisis. Williams was beaten, but at
a cost.</p>

<p>Feeling too much upset to go home, she rode a little farther into the
town, and got down from the tram at a small tea-shop. There, in the
dark little place behind the shop, she drank her tea and ate bread-
and-butter. She did not taste anything. The taking of tea was just a
mechanical action, to cover over her existence. There she sat in the
dark, obscure little place, without knowing. Only unconsciously she
nursed the back of her hand, which was bruised.</p>

<p>When finally she took her way home, it was sunset red across the west.
She did not know why she was going home. There was nothing for her
there. She had, true, only to pretend to be normal. There was nobody
she could speak to, nowhere to go for escape. But she must keep on,
under this red sunset, alone, knowing the horror in humanity, that
would destroy her, and with which she was at war. Yet it had to be so.</p>

<p>In the morning again she must go to school. She got up and went without
murmuring even to herself. She was in the hands of some bigger,
stronger, coarser will.</p>

<p>School was fairly quiet. But she could feel the class watching her,
ready to spring on her. Her instinct was aware of the class instinct to
catch her if she were weak. But she kept cold and was guarded.</p>

<p>Williams was absent from school. In the middle of the morning there was
a knock at the door: someone wanted the headmaster. Mr. Harby went out,
heavily, angrily, nervously. He was afraid of irate parents. After a
moment in the passage, he came again into school.</p>

<p>&quot;Sturgess,&quot; he called to one of his larger boys. &quot;Stand in front of the
class and write down the name of anyone who speaks. Will you come this
way, Miss Brangwen.&quot;</p>

<p>He seemed vindictively to seize upon her.</p>

<p>Ursula followed him, and found in the lobby a thin woman with a whitish
skin, not ill-dressed in a grey costume and a purple hat.</p>

<p>&quot;I called about Vernon,&quot; said the woman, speaking in a refined accent.
There was about the woman altogether an appearance of refinement and of
cleanliness, curiously contradicted by her half beggar's deportment,
and a sense of her being unpleasant to touch, like something going bad
inside. She was neither a lady nor an ordinary working man's wife, but
a creature separate from society. By her dress she was not poor.</p>

<p>Ursula knew at once that she was Williams' mother, and that he was
Vernon. She remembered that he was always clean, and well-dressed, in a
sailor suit. And he had this same peculiar, half transparent
unwholesomeness, rather like a corpse.</p>

<p>&quot;I wasn't able to send him to school to-day,&quot; continued the woman, with
a false grace of manner. &quot;He came home last night so ill - he was
violently sick - I thought I should have to send for the doctor. - You
know he has a weak heart.&quot;</p>

<p>The woman looked at Ursula with her pale, dead eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; replied the girl, &quot;I did not know.&quot;</p>

<p>She stood still with repulsion and uncertainty. Mr. Harby, large and
male, with his overhanging moustache, stood by with a slight, ugly
smile at the corner of his eyes. The woman went on insidiously, not
quite human:</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes, he has had heart disease ever since he was a child. That is
why he isn't very regular at school. And it is very bad to beat him. He
was awfully ill this morning - I shall call on the doctor as I go back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who is staying with him now, then?&quot; put in the deep voice of the
schoolmaster, cunningly.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I left him with a woman who comes in to help me - and who
understands him. But I shall call in the doctor on my way home.&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula stood still. She felt vague threats in all this. But the woman
was so utterly strange to her, that she did not understand.</p>

<p>&quot;He told me he had been beaten,&quot; continued the woman, &quot;and when I
undressed him to put him to bed, his body was covered with marks - I
could show them to any doctor.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr Harby looked at Ursula to answer. She began to understand. The woman
was threatening to take out a charge of assault on her son against her.
Perhaps she wanted money.</p>

<p>&quot;I caned him,&quot; she said. &quot;He was so much trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry if he was troublesome,&quot; said the woman, &quot;but he must have
been shamefully beaten. I could show the marks to any doctor. I'm sure
it isn't allowed, if it was known.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I caned him while he kept kicking me,&quot; said Ursula, getting angry
because she was half excusing herself, Mr. Harby standing there with
the twinkle at the side of his eyes, enjoying the dilemma of the two
women.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure I'm sorry if he behaved badly,&quot; said the woman. &quot;But I can't
think he deserved beating as he has been. I can't send him to school,
and really can't afford to pay the doctor. - Is it allowed for the
teachers to beat the children like that, Mr. Harby?&quot;</p>

<p>The headmaster refused to answer. Ursula loathed herself, and loathed
Mr. Harby with his twinkling cunning and malice on the occasion. The
other miserable woman watched her chance.</p>

<p>&quot;It is an expense to me, and I have a great struggle to keep my boy
decent.&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula still would not answer. She looked out at the asphalt yard,
where a dirty rag of paper was blowing.</p>

<p>&quot;And it isn't allowed to beat a child like that, I am sure, especially
when he is delicate.&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula stared with a set face on the yard, as if she did not hear. She
loathed all this, and had ceased to feel or to exist.</p>

<p>&quot;Though I know he is troublesome sometimes - but I think it was too
much. His body is covered with marks.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Harby stood sturdy and unmoved, waiting now to have done, with the
twinkling, tiny wrinkles of an ironical smile at the corners of his
eyes. He felt himself master of the situation.</p>

<p>&quot;And he was violently sick. I couldn't possibly send him to school
to-day. He couldn't keep his head up.&quot;</p>

<p>Yet she had no answer.</p>

<p>&quot;You will understand, sir, why he is absent,&quot; she said, turning to Mr.
Harby.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; he said, rough and off-hand. Ursula detested him for his
male triumph. And she loathed the woman. She loathed everything.</p>

<p>&quot;You will try to have it remembered, sir, that he has a weak heart. He
is so sick after these things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the headmaster, &quot;I'll see about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know he is troublesome,&quot; the woman only addressed herself to the
male now - &quot;but if you could have him punished without beating - he is
really delicate.&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula was beginning to feel upset. Harby stood in rather superb
mastery, the woman cringing to him to tickle him as one tickles trout.</p>

<p>&quot;I had come to explain why he was away this morning, sir. You will
understand.&quot;</p>

<p>She held out her hand. Harby took it and let it go, surprised and
angry.</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning,&quot; she said, and she gave her gloved, seedy hand to
Ursula. She was not ill-looking, and had a curious insinuating way,
very distasteful yet effective.</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning, Mr. Harby, and thank you.&quot;</p>

<p>The figure in the grey costume and the purple hat was going across the
school yard with a curious lingering walk. Ursula felt a strange pity
for her, and revulsion from her. She shuddered. She went into the
school again.</p>

<p>The next morning Williams turned up, looking paler than ever, very neat
and nicely dressed in his sailor blouse. He glanced at Ursula with a
half-smile: cunning, subdued, ready to do as she told him. There was
something about him that made her shiver. She loathed the idea of
having laid hands on him. His elder brother was standing outside the
gate at playtime, a youth of about fifteen, tall and thin and pale. He
raised his hat, almost like a gentleman. But there was something
subdued, insidious about him too.</p>

<p>&quot;Who is it?&quot; said Ursula.</p>

<p>&quot;It's the big Williams,&quot; said Violet Harby roughly. &quot;She was here
yesterday, wasn't she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's no good her coming - her character's not good enough for her to
make any trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula shrank from the brutality and the scandal. But it had some
vague, horried fascination. How sordid everything seemed! She felt
sorry for the queer woman with the lingering walk, and those queer,
insidious boys. The Williams in her class was wrong somewhere. How
nasty it was altogether.</p>

<p>So the battle went on till her heart was sick. She had several more
boys to subjugate before she could establish herself. And Mr. Harby
hated her almost as if she were a man. She knew now that nothing but a
thrashing would settle some of the big louts who wanted to play cat and
mouse with her. Mr. Harby would not give them the thrashing if he could
help it. For he hated the teacher, the stuck-up, insolent high-school
miss with her independence.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Wright, what have you done this time?&quot; he would say genially to
the boy who was sent to him from Standard Five for punishment. And he
left the lad standing, lounging, wasting his time.</p>

<p>So that Ursula would appeal no more to the headmaster, but, when she
was driven wild, she seized her cane, and slashed the boy who was
insolent to her, over head and ears and hands. And at length they were
afraid of her, she had them in order.</p>

<p>But she had paid a great price out of her own soul, to do this. It
seemed as if a great flame had gone through her and burnt her sensitive
tissue. She who shrank from the thought of physical suffering in any
form, had been forced to fight and beat with a cane and rouse all her
instincts to hurt. And afterwards she had been forced to endure the
sound of their blubbering and desolation, when she had broken them to
order.</p>

<p>Oh, and sometimes she felt as if she would go mad. What did it matter,
what did it matter if their books were dirty and they did not obey? She
would rather, in reality, that they disobeyed the whole rules of the
school, than that they should be beaten, broken, reduced to this
crying, hopeless state. She would rather bear all their insults and
insolences a thousand times than reduce herself and them to this.
Bitterly she repented having got beside herself, and having tackled the
boy she had beaten.</p>

<p>Yet it had to be so. She did not want to do it. Yet she had to. Oh,
why, why had she leagued herself to this evil system where she must
brutalise herself to live? Why had she become a school-teacher, why,
why?</p>

<p>The children had forced her to the beatings. No, she did not pity them.
She had come to them full of kindness and love, and they would have
torn her to pieces. They chose Mr. Harby. Well then, they must know her
as well as Mr. Harby, they must first be subjugate to her. For she was
not going to be made nought, no, neither by them, nor by Mr. Harby, nor
by all the system around her. She was not going to be put down,
prevented from standing free. It was not to be said of her, she could
not take her place and carry out her task. She would fight and hold her
place in this state also, in the world of work and man's convention.</p>

<p>She was isolated now from the life of her childhood, a foreigner in a
new life, of work and mechanical consideration. She and Maggie, in
their dinner-hours and their occasional teas at the little restaurant,
discussed life and ideas. Maggie was a great suffragette, trusting in
the vote. To Ursula the vote was never a reality. She had within her
the strange, passionate knowledge of religion and living far
transcending the limits of the automatic system that contained the
vote. But her fundamental, organic knowledge had as yet to take form
and rise to utterance. For her, as for Maggie, the liberty of woman
meant something real and deep. She felt that somewhere, in something,
she was not free. And she wanted to be. She was in revolt. For once she
were free she could get somewhere. Ah, the wonderful, real somewhere
that was beyond her, the somewhere that she felt deep, deep inside her.</p>

<p>In coming out and earning her own living she had made a strong, cruel
move towards freeing herself. But having more freedom she only became
more profoundly aware of the big want. She wanted so many things. She
wanted to read great, beautiful books, and be rich with them; she
wanted to see beautiful things, and have the joy of them for ever; she
wanted to know big, free people; and there remained always the want she
could put no name to.</p>

<p>It was so difficult. There were so many things, so much to meet and
surpass. And one never knew where one was going. It was a blind fight.
She had suffered bitterly in this school of St. Philip's. She was like
a young filly that has been broken in to the shafts, and has lost its
freedom. And now she was suffering bitterly from the agony of the
shafts. The agony, the galling, the ignominy of her breaking in. This
wore into her soul. But she would never submit. To shafts like these
she would never submit for long. But she would know them. She would
serve them that she might destroy them.</p>

<p>She and Maggie went to all kinds of places together, to big suffrage
meetings in Nottingham, to concerts, to theatres, to exhibitions of
pictures. Ursula saved her money and bought a bicycle, and the two
girls rode to Lincoln, to Southwell, and into Derbyshire. They had an
endless wealth of things to talk about. And it was a great joy,
finding, discovering.</p>

<p>But Ursula never told about Winifred Inger. That was a sort of secret
side-show to her life, never to be opened. She did not even think of
it. It was the closed door she had not the strength to open.</p>

<p>Once she was broken in to her teaching, Ursula began gradually to have
a new life of her own again. She was going to college in eighteen
months' time. Then she would take her degree, and she would - ah, she
would perhaps be a big woman, and lead a movement. Who knows? - At any
rate she would go to college in eighteen months' time. All that
mattered now was work, work.</p>

<p>And till college, she must go on with this teaching in St. Philip's
School, which was always destroying her, but which she could now
manage, without spoiling all her life. She would submit to it for a
time, since the time had a definite limit.</p>

<p>The class-teaching itself at last became almost mechanical. It was a
strain on her, an exhausting wearying strain, always unnatural. But
there was a certain amount of pleasure in the sheer oblivion of
teaching, so much work to do, so many children to see after, so much to
be done, that one's self was forgotten. When the work had become like
habit to her, and her individual soul was left out, had its growth
elsewhere, then she could be almost happy.</p>

<p>Her real, individual self drew together and became more coherent during
these two years of teaching, during the struggle against the odds of
class teaching. It was always a prison to her, the school. But it was a
prison where her wild, chaotic soul became hard and independent. When
she was well enough and not tired, then she did not hate the teaching.
She enjoyed getting into the swing of work of a morning, putting forth
all her strength, making the thing go. It was for her a strenuous form
of exercise. And her soul was left to rest, it had the time of torpor
in which to gather itself together in strength again. But the teaching
hours were too long, the tasks too heavy, and the disciplinary
condition of the school too unnatural for her. She was worn very thin
and quivering.</p>

<p>She came to school in the morning seeing the hawthorn flowers wet, the
little, rosy grains swimming in a bowl of dew. The larks quivered their
song up into the new sunshine, and the country was so glad. It was a
violation to plunge into the dust and greyness of the town.</p>

<p>So that she stood before her class unwilling to give herself up to the
activity of teaching, to turn her energy, that longed for the country
and for joy of early summer, into the dominating of fifty children and
the transferring to them some morsels of arithmetic. There was a little
absentness about her. She could not force herself into forgetfulness. A
jar of buttercups and fool's-parsley in the window-bottom kept her away
in the meadows, where in the lush grass the moon-daisies were
half-submerged, and a spray of pink ragged robin. Yet before her were
faces of fifty children. They were almost like big daisies in a dimness
of the grass.</p>

<p>A brightness was on her face, a little unreality in her teaching. She
could not quite see her children. She was struggling between two
worlds, her own world of young summer and flowers, and this other world
of work. And the glimmer of her own sunlight was between her and her
class.</p>

<p>Then the morning passed with a strange far-awayness and quietness.
Dinner-time came, when she and Maggie ate joyously, with all the
windows open. And then they went out into St. Philip's churchyard,
where was a shadowy corner under red hawthorn trees. And there they
talked and read Shelley or Browning or some work about &quot;Woman and
Labour&quot;.</p>

<p>And when she went back to school, Ursula lived still in the shadowy
corner of the graveyard, where pink-red petals lay scattered from the
hawthorn tree, like myriad tiny shells on a beach, and a church bell
sometimes rang sonorously, and sometimes a bird called out, whilst
Maggie's voice went on low and sweet.</p>

<p>These days she was happy in her soul: oh, she was so happy, that she
wished she could take her joy and scatter it in armfuls broadcast. She
made her children happy, too, with a little tingling of delight. But to
her, the children were not a school class this afternoon. They were
flowers, birds, little bright animals, children, anything. They only
were not Standard Five. She felt no responsibility for them. It was for
once a game, this teaching. And if they got their sums wrong, what
matter? And she would take a pleasant bit of reading. And instead of
history with dates, she would tell a lovely tale. And for grammar, they
could have a bit of written analysis that was not difficult, because
they had done it before:</p>

<p>&quot;She shall be sportive as a fawn
That wild with glee across the lawn
Or up the mountain springs.&quot;</p>

<p>She wrote that from memory, because it pleased her.</p>

<p>So the golden afternoon passed away and she went home happy. She had
finished her day of school, and was free to plunge into the glowing
evening of Cossethay. And she loved walking home. But it had not been
school. It had been playing at school beneath red hawthorn blossom.</p>

<p>She could not go on like this. The quarterly examination was coming,
and her class was not ready. It irritated her that she must drag
herself away from her happy self, and exert herself with all her
strength to force, to compel this heavy class of children to work hard
at arithmetic. They did not want to work, she did not want to compel
them. And yet, some second conscience gnawed at her, telling her the
work was not properly done. It irritated her almost to madness, and she
let loose all the irritation in the class. Then followed a day of
battle and hate and violence, when she went home raw, feeling the
golden evening taken away from her, herself incarcerated in some dark,
heavy place, and chained there with a consciousness of having done
badly at work.</p>

<p>What good was it that it was summer, that right till evening, when the
corncrakes called, the larks would mount up into the light, to sing
once more before nightfall. What good was it all, when she was out of
tune, when she must only remember the burden and shame of school that
day.</p>

<p>And still, she hated school. Still she cried, she did not believe in
it. Why should the children learn, and why should she teach them? It
was all so much milling the wind. What folly was it that made life into
this, the fulfilling of some stupid, factitious duty? It was all so
made up, so unnatural. The school, the sums, the grammar, the quarterly
examinations, the registers - it was all a barren nothing!</p>

<p>Why should she give her allegiance to this world, and let it so
dominate her, that her own world of warm sun and growing, sap-filled
life was turned into nothing? She was not going to do it. She was not
going to be a prisoner in the dry, tyrannical man-world. She was not
going to care about it. What did it matter if her class did ever so
badly in the quarterly examination. Let it - what did it matter?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when the time came, and the report on her class was bad,
she was miserable, and the joy of the summer was taken away from her,
she was shut up in gloom. She could not really escape from this world
of system and work, out into her fields where she was happy. She must
have her place in the working world, be a recognised member with full
rights there. It was more important to her than fields and sun and
poetry, at this time. But she was only the more its enemy.</p>

<p>It was a very difficult thing, she thought, during the long hours of
intermission in the summer holidays, to be herself, her happy self that
enjoyed so much to lie in the sun, to play and swim and be content, and
also to be a school-teacher getting results out of a class of children.
She dreamed fondly of the time when she need not be a teacher any more.
But vaguely, she knew that responsibility had taken place in her for
ever, and as yet her prime business was to work.</p>

<p>The autumn passed away, the winter was at hand. Ursula became more and
more an inhabitant of the world of work, and of what is called life.
She could not see her future, but a little way off, was college, and to
the thought of this she clung fixedly. She would go to college, and get
her two or three years' training, free of cost. Already she had applied
and had her place appointed for the coming year.</p>

<p>So she continued to study for her degree. She would take French, Latin,
English, mathematics and botany. She went to classes in Ilkeston, she
studied at evening. For there was this world to conquer, this knowledge
to acquire, this qualification to attain. And she worked with
intensity, because of a want inside her that drove her on. Almost
everything was subordinated now to this one desire to take her place in
the world. What kind of place it was to be she did not ask herself. The
blind desire drove her on. She must take her place.</p>

<p>She knew she would never be much of a success as an elementary school
teacher. But neither had she failed. She hated it, but she had managed
it.</p>

<p>Maggie had left St. Philip's School, and had found a more congenial
post. The two girls remained friends. They met at evening classes, they
studied and somehow encouraged a firm hope each in the other. They did
not know whither they were making, nor what they ultimately wanted. But
they knew they wanted now to learn, to know and to do.</p>

<p>They talked of love and marriage, and the position of woman in
marriage. Maggie said that love was the flower of life, and blossomed
unexpectedly and without law, and must be plucked where it was found,
and enjoyed for the brief hour of its duration.</p>

<p>To Ursula this was unsatisfactory. She thought she still loved Anton
Skrebensky. But she did not forgive him that he had not been strong
enough to acknowledge her. He had denied her. How then could she love
him? How then was love so absolute? She did not believe it. She
believed that love was a way, a means, not an end in itself, as Maggie
seemed to think. And always the way of love would be found. But whither
did it lead?</p>

<p>&quot;I believe there are many men in the world one might love - there is not
only one man,&quot; said Ursula.</p>

<p>She was thinking of Skrebensky. Her heart was hollow with the knowledge
of Winifred Inger.</p>

<p>&quot;But you must distinguish between love and passion,&quot; said Maggie,
adding, with a touch of contempt: &quot;Men will easily have a passion for
you, but they won't love you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Ursula, vehemently, the look of suffering, almost of
fanaticism, on her face. &quot;Passion is only part of love. And it seems so
much because it can't last. That is why passion is never happy.&quot;</p>

<p>She was staunch for joy, for happiness, and permanency, in contrast
with Maggie, who was for sadness, and the inevitable passing-away of
things. Ursula suffered bitterly at the hands of life, Maggie was
always single, always withheld, so she went in a heavy brooding sadness
that was almost meat to her. In Ursula's last winter at St. Philip's
the friendship of the two girls came to a climax. It was during this
winter that Ursula suffered and enjoyed most keenly Maggie's
fundamental sadness of enclosedness. Maggie enjoyed and suffered
Ursula's struggles against the confines of her life. And then the two
girls began to drift apart, as Ursula broke from that form of life
wherein Maggie must remain enclosed.</p>
