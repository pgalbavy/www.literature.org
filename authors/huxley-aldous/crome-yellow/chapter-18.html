<p>The nearest Roman Catholic church was upwards of twenty miles
away. Ivor, who was punctilious in his devotions, came down early
to breakfast and had his car at the door, ready to start, by a
quarter to ten. It was a smart, expensive-looking machine, enamelled
a pure lemon yellow and upholstered in emerald green leather.
There were two seats&mdash;three if you squeezed tightly enough&mdash;and
their occupants were protected from wind, dust, and weather by
a glazed sedan that rose, an elegant eighteenth-century hump,
from the midst of the body of the car.</p>

<p>Mary had never been to a Roman Catholic service, thought it would
be an interesting experience, and, when the car moved off through
the great gates of the courtyard, she was occupying the spare
seat in the sedan. The sea-lion horn roared, faintlier, faintlier,
and they were gone.</p>

<p>In the parish church of Crome Mr. Bodiham preached on 1 Kings
vi. 18: "And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops"&mdash;a
sermon of immediately local interest. For the past two years the
problem of the War Memorial had exercised the minds of all those
in Crome who had enough leisure, or mental energy, or party spirit
to think of such things. Henry Wimbush was all for a library&mdash;a
library of local literature, stocked with county histories, old
maps of the district, monographs on the local antiquities, dialect
dictionaries, handbooks of the local geology and natural history.
He liked to think of the villagers, inspired by such reading,
making up parties of a Sunday afternoon to look for fossils and
flint arrow-heads. The villagers themselves favoured the idea
of a memorial reservoir and water supply. But the busiest and
most articulate party followed Mr. Bodiham in demanding something
religious in character&mdash;a second lich-gate, for example, a stained-glass
window, a monument of marble, or, if possible, all three. So far,
however, nothing had been done, partly because the memorial committee
had never been able to agree, partly for the more cogent reason
that too little money had been subscribed to carry out any of
the proposed schemes. Every three or four months Mr. Bodiham preached
a sermon on the subject. His last had been delivered in March;
it was high time that his congregation had a fresh reminder.</p>

<p>"And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops."</p>

<p>Mr. Bodiham touched lightly on Solomon’s temple. From thence
he passed to temples and churches in general. What were the characteristics
of these buildings dedicated to God? Obviously, the fact of their,
from a human point of view, complete uselessness. They were unpractical
buildings "carved with knops." Solomon might have built a library&mdash;indeed,
what could be more to the taste of the world’s wisest man? He
might have dug a reservoir&mdash;what more useful in a parched city
like Jerusalem? He did neither; he built a house all carved with
knops, useless and unpractical. Why? Because he was dedicating
the work to God. There had been much talk in Crome about the proposed
War Memorial. A War Memorial was, in its very nature, a work dedicated
to God. It was a token of thankfulness that the first stage in
the culminating world-war had been crowned by the triumph of righteousness;
it was at the same time a visibly embodied supplication that God
might not long delay the Advent which alone could bring the final
peace. A library, a reservoir? Mr. Bodiham scornfully and indignantly
condemned the idea. These were works dedicated to man, not to
God. As a War Memorial they were totally unsuitable. A lich-gate
had been suggested. This was an object which answered perfectly
to the definition of a War Memorial: a useless work dedicated
to God and carved with knops. One lich-gate, it was true, already
existed. But nothing would be easier than to make a second entrance
into the churchyard; and a second entrance would need a second
gate. Other suggestions had been made. Stained-glass windows,
a monument of marble. Both these were admirable, especially the
latter. It was high time that the War Memorial was erected. It
might soon be too late. At any moment, like a thief in the night,
God might come. Meanwhile a difficulty stood in the way. Funds
were inadequate. All should subscribe according to their means.
Those who had lost relations in the war might reasonably be expected
to subscribe a sum equal to that which they would have had to
pay in funeral expenses if the relative had died while at home.
Further delay was disastrous. The War Memorial must be built at
once. He appealed to the patriotism and the Christian sentiments
of all his hearers.</p>

<p>Henry Wimbush walked home thinking of the books he would present
to the War Memorial Library, if ever it came into existence. He
took the path through the fields; it was pleasanter than the road.
At the first stile a group of village boys, loutish young fellows
all dressed in the hideous ill-fitting black which makes a funeral
of every English Sunday and holiday, were assembled, drearily
guffawing as they smoked their cigarettes. They made way for Henry
Wimbush, touching their caps as he passed. He returned their salute;
his bowler and face were one in their unruffled gravity.</p>

<p>In Sir Ferdinando’s time, he reflected, in the time of his son,
Sir Julius, these young men would have had their Sunday diversions
even at Crome, remote and rustic Crome. There would have been
archery, skittles, dancing&mdash;social amusements in which they would
have partaken as members of a conscious community. Now they had
nothing, nothing except Mr. Bodiham’s forbidding Boys’ Club and
the rare dances and concerts organised by himself. Boredom or
the urban pleasures of the county metropolis were the alternatives
that presented themselves to these poor youths. Country pleasures
were no more; they had been stamped out by the Puritans.</p>

<p>In Manningham’s Diary for 1600 there was a queer passage, he
remembered, a very queer passage. Certain magistrates in Berkshire,
Puritan magistrates, had had wind of a scandal. One moonlit summer
night they had ridden out with their posse and there, among the
hills, they had come upon a company of men and women, dancing,
stark naked, among the sheepcotes. The magistrates and their men
had ridden their horses into the crowd. How self-conscious the
poor people must suddenly have felt, how helpless without their
clothes against armed and booted horsemen! The dancers were arrested,
whipped, gaoled, set in the stocks; the moonlight dance is never
danced again. What old, earthy, Panic rite came to extinction
here? he wondered. Who knows?&mdash;perhaps their ancestors had danced
like this in the moonlight ages before Adam and Eve were so much
as thought of. He liked to think so. And now it was no more. These
weary young men, if they wanted to dance, would have to bicycle
six miles to the town. The country was desolate, without life
of its own, without indigenous pleasures. The pious magistrates
had snuffed out for ever a little happy flame that had burned
from the beginning of time.</p>

<p>He repeated the lines to himself, and was desolated to think
of all the murdered past.</p>
