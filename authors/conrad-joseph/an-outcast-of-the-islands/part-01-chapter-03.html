<p>The opportunity and the temptation were too much for Willems,
and under the pressure of sudden necessity he abused that trust
which was his pride, the perpetual sign of his cleverness and
a load too heavy for him to carry. A run of bad luck at cards,
the failure of a small speculation undertaken on his own account,
an unexpected demand for money from one or another member of the
Da Souza family&mdash;and almost before he was well aware of it he
was off the path of his peculiar honesty. It was such a faint
and ill-defined track that it took him some time to find out how
far he had strayed amongst the brambles of the dangerous wilderness
he had been skirting for so many years, without any other guide
than his own convenience and that doctrine of success which he
had found for himself in the book of life&mdash;in those interesting
chapters that the Devil has been permitted to write in it, to
test the sharpness of men’s eyesight and the steadfastness of
their hearts. For one short, dark and solitary moment he was dismayed,
but he had that courage that will not scale heights, yet will
wade bravely through the mud&mdash;if there be no other road. He applied
himself to the task of restitution, and devoted himself to the
duty of not being found out. On his thirtieth birthday he had
almost accomplished the task&mdash;and the duty had been faithfully
and cleverly performed. He saw himself safe. Again he could look
hopefully towards the goal of his legitimate ambition. Nobody
would dare to suspect him, and in a few days there would be nothing
to suspect. He was elated. He did not know that his prosperity
had touched then its high-water mark, and that the tide was already
on the turn.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards he knew. Mr. Vinck, hearing the rattle of
the door-handle, jumped up from his desk&mdash;where he had been tremulously
listening to the loud voices in the private office&mdash;and buried
his face in the big safe with nervous haste. For the last time
Willems passed through the little green door leading to Hudig’s
sanctum, which, during the past half-hour, might have been taken&mdash;from
the fiendish noise within&mdash;for the cavern of some wild beast.
Willems’ troubled eyes took in the quick impression of men and
things as he came out from the place of his humiliation. He saw
the scared expression of the punkah boy; the Chinamen tellers
sitting on their heels with unmovable faces turned up blankly
towards him while their arrested hands hovered over the little
piles of bright guilders ranged on the floor; Mr. Vinck’s shoulder-blades
with the fleshy rims of two red ears above. He saw the long avenue
of gin cases stretching from where he stood to the arched doorway
beyond which he would be able to breathe perhaps. A thin rope’s
end lay across his path and he saw it distinctly, yet stumbled
heavily over it as if it had been a bar of iron. Then he found
himself in the street at last, but could not find air enough to
fill his lungs. He walked towards his home, gasping.</p>

<p>As the sound of Hudig’s insults that lingered in his ears grew
fainter by the lapse of time, the feeling of shame was replaced
slowly by a passion of anger against himself and still more against
the stupid concourse of circumstances that had driven him into
his idiotic indiscretion. Idiotic indiscretion; that is how he
defined his guilt to himself. Could there be anything worse from
the point of view of his undeniable cleverness? What a fatal aberration
of an acute mind! He did not recognize himself there. He must
have been mad. That’s it. A sudden gust of madness. And now the
work of long years was destroyed utterly. What would become of
him?</p>

<p>Before he could answer that question he found himself in the
garden before his house, Hudig’s wedding gift. He looked at it
with a vague surprise to find it there. His past was so utterly
gone from him that the dwelling which belonged to it appeared
to him incongruous standing there intact, neat, and cheerful in
the sunshine of the hot afternoon. The house was a pretty little
structure all doors and windows, surrounded on all sides by the
deep verandah supported on slender columns clothed in the green
foliage of creepers, which also fringed the overhanging eaves
of the high-pitched roof. Slowly, Willems mounted the dozen steps
that led to the verandah. He paused at every step. He must tell
his wife. He felt frightened at the prospect, and his alarm dismayed
him. Frightened to face her! Nothing could give him a better measure
of the greatness of the change around him, and in him. Another
man&mdash;and another life with the faith in himself gone. He could
not be worth much if he was afraid to face that woman.</p>

<p>He dared not enter the house through the open door of the dining-room,
but stood irresolute by the little work-table where trailed a
white piece of calico, with a needle stuck in it, as if the work
had been left hurriedly. The pink-crested cockatoo started, on
his appearance, into clumsy activity and began to climb laboriously
up and down his perch, calling "Joanna" with indistinct loudness
and a persistent screech that prolonged the last syllable of the
name as if in a peal of insane laughter. The screen in the doorway
moved gently once or twice in the breeze, and each time Willems
started slightly, expecting his wife, but he never lifted his
eyes, although straining his ears for the sound of her footsteps.
Gradually he lost himself in his thoughts, in the endless speculation
as to the manner in which she would receive his news&mdash;and his
orders. In this preoccupation he almost forgot the fear of her
presence. No doubt she will cry, she will lament, she will be
helpless and frightened and passive as ever. And he would have
to drag that limp weight on and on through the darkness of a spoiled
life. Horrible! Of course he could not abandon her and the child
to certain misery or possible starvation. The wife and the child
of Willems. Willems the successful, the smart; Willems the conf
. . . . Pah! And what was Willems now? Willems the. . . . He strangled
the half-born thought, and cleared his throat to stifle a groan.
Ah! Won’t they talk to-night in the billiard-room&mdash;his world,
where he had been first&mdash;all those men to whom he had been so
superciliously condescending. Won’t they talk with surprise, and
affected regret, and grave faces, and wise nods. Some of them
owed him money, but he never pressed anybody. Not he. Willems,
the prince of good fellows, they called him. And now they will
rejoice, no doubt, at his downfall. A crowd of imbeciles. In his
abasement he was yet aware of his superiority over those fellows,
who were merely honest or simply not found out yet. A crowd of
imbeciles! He shook his fist at the evoked image of his friends,
and the startled parrot fluttered its wings and shrieked in desperate
fright.</p>

<p>In a short glance upwards Willems saw his wife come round the
corner of the house. He lowered his eyelids quickly, and waited
silently till she came near and stood on the other side of the
little table. He would not look at her face, but he could see
the red dressing-gown he knew so well. She trailed through life
in that red dressing-gown, with its row of dirty blue bows down
the front, stained, and hooked on awry; a torn flounce at the
bottom following her like a snake as she moved languidly about,
with her hair negligently caught up, and a tangled wisp straggling
untidily down her back. His gaze travelled upwards from bow to
bow, noticing those that hung only by a thread, but it did not
go beyond her chin. He looked at her lean throat, at the obtrusive
collarbone visible in the disarray of the upper part of her attire.
He saw the thin arm and the bony hand clasping the child she carried,
and he felt an immense distaste for those encumbrances of his
life. He waited for her to say something, but as he felt her eyes
rest on him in unbroken silence he sighed and began to speak.</p>

<p>It was a hard task. He spoke slowly, lingering amongst the memories
of this early life in his reluctance to confess that this was
the end of it and the beginning of a less splendid existence.
In his conviction of having made her happiness in the full satisfaction
of all material wants he never doubted for a moment that she was
ready to keep him company on no matter how hard and stony a road.
He was not elated by this certitude. He had married her to please
Hudig, and the greatness of his sacrifice ought to have made her
happy without any further exertion on his part. She had years
of glory as Willems’ wife, and years of comfort, of loyal care,
and of such tenderness as she deserved. He had guarded her carefully
from any bodily hurt; and of any other suffering he had no conception.
The assertion of his superiority was only another benefit conferred
on her. All this was a matter of course, but he told her all this
so as to bring vividly before her the greatness of her loss. She
was so dull of understanding that she would not grasp it else.
And now it was at an end. They would have to go. Leave this house,
leave this island, go far away where he was unknown. To the English
Strait-Settlements perhaps. He would find an opening there for
his abilities&mdash;and juster men to deal with than old Hudig. He
laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>"You have the money I left at home this morning, Joanna?" he
asked. "We will want it all now."</p>

<p>As he spoke those words he thought he was a fine fellow. Nothing
new that. Still, he surpassed there his own expectations. Hang
it all, there are sacred things in life, after all. The marriage
tie was one of them, and he was not the man to break it. The solidity
of his principles caused him great satisfaction, but he did not
care to look at his wife, for all that. He waited for her to speak.
Then he would have to console her; tell her not to be a crying
fool; to get ready to go. Go where? How? When? He shook his head.
They must leave at once; that was the principal thing. He felt
a sudden need to hurry up his departure.</p>

<p>"Well, Joanna," he said, a little impatiently&mdash;-"don’t stand
there in a trance. Do you hear? We must. . . ."</p>

<p>He looked up at his wife, and whatever he was going to add remained
unspoken. She was staring at him with her big, slanting eyes,
that seemed to him twice their natural size. The child, its dirty
little face pressed to its mother’s shoulder, was sleeping peacefully.
The deep silence of the house was not broken, but rather accentuated,
by the low mutter of the cockatoo, now very still on its perch.
As Willems was looking at Joanna her upper lip was drawn up on
one side, giving to her melancholy face a vicious expression altogether
new to his experience. He stepped back in his surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh! You great man!" she said distinctly, but in a voice that
was hardly above a whisper.</p>

<p>Those words, and still more her tone, stunned him as if somebody
had fired a gun close to his ear. He stared back at her stupidly.</p>

<p>"Oh! you great man!" she repeated slowly, glancing right and
left as if meditating a sudden escape. "And you think that I am
going to starve with you. You are nobody now. You think my mamma
and Leonard would let me go away? And with you! With you," she
repeated scornfully, raising her voice, which woke up the child
and caused it to whimper feebly.</p>

<p>"Joanna!" exclaimed Willems.</p>

<p>"Do not speak to me. I have heard what I have waited for all
these years. You are less than dirt, you that have wiped your
feet on me. I have waited for this. I am not afraid now. I do
not want you; do not come near me. Ah-h!" she screamed shrilly,
as he held out his hand in an entreating gesture&mdash;"Ah! Keep off
me! Keep off me! Keep off!"</p>

<p>She backed away, looking at him with eyes both angry and frightened.
Willems stared motionless, in dumb amazement at the mystery of
anger and revolt in the head of his wife. Why? What had he ever
done to her? This was the day of injustice indeed. First Hudig&mdash;and
now his wife. He felt a terror at this hate that had lived stealthily
so near him for years. He tried to speak, but she shrieked again,
and it was like a needle through his heart. Again he raised his
hand.</p>

<p>"Help!" called Mrs. Willems, in a piercing voice. "Help!"</p>

<p>"Be quiet! You fool!" shouted Willems, trying to drown the noise
of his wife and child in his own angry accents and rattling violently
the little zinc table in his exasperation.</p>

<p>From under the house, where there were bathrooms and a tool closet,
appeared Leonard, a rusty iron bar in his hand. He called threateningly
from the bottom of the stairs.</p>

<p>"Do not hurt her, Mr. Willems. You are a savage. Not at all like
we, whites."</p>

<p>"You too!" said the bewildered Willems. "I haven’t touched her.
Is this a madhouse?" He moved towards the stairs, and Leonard
dropped the bar with a clang and made for the gate of the compound.
Willems turned back to his wife.</p>

<p>"So you expected this," he said. "It is a conspiracy. Who’s that
sobbing and groaning in the room? Some more of your precious family.
Hey?"</p>

<p>She was more calm now, and putting hastily the crying child in
the big chair walked towards him with sudden fearlessness.</p>

<p>"My mother," she said, "my mother who came to defend me from
you&mdash;man from nowhere; a vagabond!"</p>

<p>"You did not call me a vagabond when you hung round my neck&mdash;before
we were married," said Willems, contemptuously.</p>

<p>"You took good care that I should not hang round your neck after
we were," she answered, clenching her hands, and putting her face
close to his. "You boasted while I suffered and said nothing.
What has become of your greatness; of our greatness&mdash;you were
always speaking about? Now I am going to live on the charity of
your master. Yes. That is true. He sent Leonard to tell me so.
And you will go and boast somewhere else, and starve. So! Ah!
I can breathe now! This house is mine."</p>

<p>"Enough!" said Willems, slowly, with an arresting gesture.</p>

<p>She leaped back, the fright again in her eyes, snatched up the
child, pressed it to her breast, and, falling into a chair, drummed
insanely with her heels on the resounding floor of the verandah.</p>

<p>"I shall go," said Willems, steadily. "I thank you. For the first
time in your life you make me happy. You were a stone round my
neck; you understand. I did not mean to tell you that as long
as you lived, but you made me&mdash;now. Before I pass this gate you
shall be gone from my mind. You made it very easy. I thank you."</p>

<p>He turned and went down the steps without giving her a glance,
while she sat upright and quiet, with wide-open eyes, the child
crying querulously in her arms. At the gate he came suddenly upon
Leonard, who had been dodging about there and failed to get out
of the way in time.</p>

<p>"Do not be brutal, Mr. Willems," said Leonard, hurriedly. "It
is unbecoming between white men with all those natives looking
on."  Leonard’s legs trembled very much, and his voice wavered
between high and low tones without any attempt at control on his
part. "Restrain your improper violence," he went on mumbling rapidly.
"I am a respectable man of very good family, while you . . . it
is regrettable . . . they all say so . . ."</p>

<p>"What?" thundered Willems. He felt a sudden impulse of mad anger,
and before he knew what had happened he was looking at Leonard
da Souza rolling in the dust at his feet. He stepped over his
prostrate brother-in-law and tore blindly down the street, everybody
making way for the frantic white man.</p>

<p>When he came to himself he was beyond the outskirts of the town,
stumbling on the hard and cracked earth of reaped rice fields.
How did he get there? It was dark. He must get back. As he walked
towards the town slowly, his mind reviewed the events of the day
and he felt a sense of bitter loneliness. His wife had turned
him out of his own house. He had assaulted brutally his brother-in-law,
a member of the Da Souza family&mdash;of that band of his worshippers.
He did. Well, no! It was some other man. Another man was coming
back. A man without a past, without a future, yet full of pain
and shame and anger. He stopped and looked round. A dog or two
glided across the empty street and rushed past him with a frightened
snarl. He was now in the midst of the Malay quarter whose bamboo
houses, hidden in the verdure of their little gardens, were dark
and silent. Men, women and children slept in there. Human beings.
Would he ever sleep, and where? He felt as if he was the outcast
of all mankind, and as he looked hopelessly round, before resuming
his weary march, it seemed to him that the world was bigger, the
night more vast and more black; but he went on doggedly with his
head down as if pushing his way through some thick brambles. Then
suddenly he felt planks under his feet and, looking up, saw the
red light at the end of the jetty. He walked quite to the end
and stood leaning against the post, under the lamp, looking at
the roadstead where two vessels at anchor swayed their slender
rigging amongst the stars. The end of the jetty; and here in one
step more the end of life; the end of everything. Better so. What
else could he do? Nothing ever comes back. He saw it clearly.
The respect and admiration of them all, the old habits and old
affections finished abruptly in the clear perception of the cause
of his disgrace. He saw all this; and for a time he came out of
himself, out of his selfishness&mdash;out of the constant preoccupation
of his interests and his desires&mdash;out of the temple of self and
the concentration of personal thought.</p>

<p>His thoughts now wandered home. Standing in the tepid stillness
of a starry tropical night he felt the breath of the bitter east
wind, he saw the high and narrow fronts of tall houses under the
gloom of a clouded sky; and on muddy quays he saw the shabby,
high-shouldered figure&mdash;the patient, faded face of the weary man
earning bread for the children that waited for him in a dingy
home. It was miserable, miserable. But it would never come back.
What was there in common between those things and Willems the
clever, Willems the successful. He had cut himself adrift from
that home many years ago. Better for him then. Better for them
now. All this was gone, never to come back again; and suddenly
he shivered, seeing himself alone in the presence of unknown and
terrible dangers.</p>

<p>For the first time in his life he felt afraid of the future,
because he had lost his faith, the faith in his own success. And
he had destroyed it foolishly with his own hands!</p>
