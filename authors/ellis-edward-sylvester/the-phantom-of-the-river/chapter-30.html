<p>The heart of Missionary Finley stood still when he saw The Panther
stride from the wood into the open space where the campfire was
burning. He knew that the terrible chieftain and Simon Kenton
had met in mortal combat, and what could the return of the Shawanoe
mean but that the prince of pioneers and rangers had been overthrown
and slain by his implacable enemy?</p>

<p>With a self-possession which surprised even himself, the good
man looked straight into the face of the Indian as he approached,
and, noting its strange expression, said:</p>

<p>"Wa-on-mon has met the white hunter and conquered him."</p>

<p>Three paces away The Panther abruptly halted and stood for several
seconds, looking silently at the missionary. Then he said, in
a low, deliberate voice:</p>

<p>"Wa-on-mon has met the white hunter&mdash;the white hunter has conquered
Wa-on-mon."</p>

<p>Missionary Finley was quick to catch the point of a situation;
but, for a moment, he was dumfounded. Then a suspicion of the
truth flashed upon him.</p>

<p>The good man was too sagacious to question The Panther. A strange,
hitherto impossible condition of affairs existed. It was dangerous
to meddle with them.</p>

<p>Suppressing all evidence of emotion, Finley asked:</p>

<p>"What are the wishes of my brother, the mighty Wa-on-mon?"</p>

<p>"She opens her eyes; she has awakened!"</p>

<p>He pointed to the little captive, who just then looked around,
with a bewildered air, sat up and rubbed her eyes.</p>

<p>"Where is papa? where is mamma?" she asked, looking from one
to the other, and at a loss to comprehend her situation and her
surroundings.</p>

<p>"Take the captive," said The Panther. "No harm shall come to
her and my brother until after they meet their friends."</p>

<p>It was fair notice that the remarkable truce ended at the moment
of the arrival of the missionary and the child among their people.</p>

<p>Again Finley displayed his tact by asking no questions of Wa-on-mon.
Nor did he essay to thank him for his unexpected clemency. He
did not so much as speak to or look at him.</p>

<p>"Come, my child," he said tenderly, extending his hand to Mabel,
"I am going to take you to papa and mamma."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad!" exclaimed the happy one, slipping her hand
into the palm of the missionary.</p>

<p>The warriors standing around and seeing all this must have had
their share, too, of strange emotions, for the experience was
without a parallel with them.</p>

<p>Had the chieftain been any one except The Panther, something
in the nature of a revolt would have been probable; but no one
dared gainsay that fearful leader, who, like Philip, chief of
the Wampanoags, had mortally smitten the warrior that dared to
suggest an opposite policy to that already determined by the sachem.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE MISSIONARY'S TRIUMPH</em>.]</p>

<p>There were looks, but nothing more, as the man, holding the hand
of the child, walked out of the camp, without any appearance of
haste or fright, and disappeared among the trees.</p>

<p>With a heart swelling with gratitude to God for the wonderful
outcome of the strange complication, the good man picked his way
through the forest, still holding the trusting hand within his
own, and comforting her by promises that she should soon see her
father and mother and brother, who were awaiting her coming on
the other side of the river. Like every other member of the company,
she was a-hungered, but there could be no guarantee that she,
like them, would not have to remain so for hours to come.</p>

<p>When the missionary reached the river side, to recross in his
canoe, he found Kenton awaiting him, paddle in hand. The two men
smiled significantly as their eyes met. They silently grasped
hands, and then adjusting themselves in the boat, with Mabel between
them, pushed for the other shore.</p>

<p>And as the graceful craft skimmed the smooth surface of the Ohio
on that beautiful summer morning, a hundred years ago, the ranger
told his story of his encounter with Wa-on-mon, chief of the Shawanoes.</p>

<p>"It took the varmint some time to know what I meant, when I said
he could go; he wouldn't take the life I offered him at first,
but said it belonged to me, and not to him. That bein' so," added
Kenton, with a grin, "I told him as how I could do as I chose
with it, as I throwed it from me."</p>

<p>"It was a surprise to him, indeed," remarked Finley.</p>

<p>"Wal, I should say powerful somewhat. When he made up his mind
at last that bein' as I wasn't going to send him under, he might
as well take what I give him, he done it."</p>

<p>"Did he say anything?"</p>

<p>"Not a word; I thought maybe he'd pick up his knife ag'in, but
he done nothin' of the kind; he didn't even look to where it had
fallen when I knocked it out of his hand, but walked off in the
woods, and that was the last of him. Parson," said the scout,
with a grave expression, looking him calmly in the face, "I want
to ask you a question."</p>

<p>"Why, Simon, my good man, you may ask me anything you choose."</p>

<p>"Where was you when The Panther and me was having our little
argyment?"</p>

<p>"I went directly back to the Shawanoe camp and stayed there till
he returned with word that I might depart with Mabel."</p>

<p>"Sure you wasn't nowhere near us?"</p>

<p>"No nearer than what I have just told you."</p>

<p>The ranger paddled a moment in silence.</p>

<p>"Bein' as you say so, that settles it."</p>

<p>The missionary, who was watching his friend closely, now said:</p>

<p>"Since I have answered your question, Simon, it is right that
I should know why you ask it."</p>

<p>"Wal, it's this: Just as I had The Panther down, and was 'bout
to finish the bus'ness, I heard you speak."</p>

<p>"Heard me speak? And what did I say?"</p>

<p>"'Show him mercy, and mercy shall be shown unto you when you
need it;' so what could I do but let him up?"</p>

<p>The good man understood the incident better than did Kenton himself.</p>

<p>"But," he said, gently, "I have just explained that I was too
far from you for me to make myself heard."</p>

<p>"Whose voice was it, then?"</p>

<p>"The voice of Conscience, Simon, or the whisperings of God. It
may have sounded louder to you just then than usual, but it was
not the first time it has sounded in your ear, reproving you when
you have done wrong, and commending you when you have done right.
Listen and heed what it tells you, Simon, and no matter what comes,
all shall be well with you."</p>

<p>The missionary saw that his words had made a strong impression,
and he was wise in saying no more.</p>

<p>The ranger headed the course for a point that would land them
considerably below where the friends in the flatboat were awaiting
their coming. Finley, after noting the fact, remarked:</p>

<p>"You are doing it on purpose, Simon."</p>

<p>"Of course; some of the varmints are watchin'."</p>

<p>The object, as the reader will perceive, was to make the Shawanoes
believe the fugitives had shifted their position further down
stream. Since Boone was with the latter party, the stratagem,
slight of itself and possibly ineffectual, was readily understood
by them.</p>

<p>When the canoe shot in under the bank on the Ohio side, it was
an eighth of a mile below where the flatboat had been hidden with
the utmost care on the same bank of the river; but there could
be no question that the fugitives had peered out with equal eagerness
of vision, and parents, brother and friends were aware of the
amazing, blessed truth that in that canoe, seated between the
missionary and ranger, was Mabel Ashbridge, she that was lost
and was found, was dead but was alive again.</p>

<p>Finley and Kenton made no mistake as to the situation. The "truce"
was now ended. The Panther was the bitter, relentless enemy that
he was before, eager only for the life of every man, woman and
child connected with the company of fugitives. If little Mabel
fell into his hands again, she would be sacrificed without a throb
of pity. He would do his utmost to prevent the company reaching
the block-house. If its members counted upon his forbearance,
it would be a fatal mistake.</p>

<p>And should he and Kenton again face each other in single-handed
combat, it would be with the same unrelenting ferocity as before.
The episode that had just taken place would be as though it had
never been. How strange that such an encounter did take place
sooner than either white or red combatant dreamed!</p>

<p>When the canoe glided from sight under the screening of the Ohio
shore, Kenton, Finley and the little girl sprang out and made
all haste to where the main party by the flatboat were awaiting
their coming. The sagacious Boone had already formed an inkling
of the truth, and, allowing only a minute or two for the reunion
and exchange of salutations, he insisted that the flight to the
block-house should be resumed and pressed with the utmost vigor
until the post was reached. The large boat could serve them no
longer, and was abandoned where it lay. The masts had been taken
down so as to allow it to pass under the overhanging vegetation,
and, consequently, had it been permitted to make its appearance
on the river, there would have been nothing in its looks to suggest
the facetious name, "Phantom of the River," first applied to it
by Missionary Finley.</p>

<p>It is not required that the particulars of the seven or eight
miles' journey through the wilderness should be given. The Panther
made such persistent attempts to destroy the pioneers that more
than once they were in the gravest peril; but they had an advantage
not possessed before, in that it was impossible to arrange any
ambuscade, for the advanced guard of rangers were too perfect
in their knowledge of woodcraft to lead the whites into any situation
that shut off escape. The Shawanoes knew enough of Kenton, Boone
and their rangers to hold them in respect, and not presume upon
their committing any irretrievable error.</p>

<p>Jim Deane, the only white man that had fallen, was given decent
burial in the shadowy forest while the party were awaiting the
arrival of Kenton and his companions. The missionary paused long
enough to offer up a prayer over the grave, and then, as we have
said, the journey was pressed to the utmost.</p>

<p>And so, at last, the block-house was safely reached, and, for
the time, all danger to our friends was over.</p>

<p><em>THE END</em>.</p>
