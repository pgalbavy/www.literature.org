<p>The next evening, just at dusk, Jasper Jay and old Mr. Crow returned to
Solomon Owl’s house, looking much bedraggled. One of Mr. Crow’s eyes was
almost closed; and Jasper Jay’s crest seemed to have been torn half off
his head.
</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Solomon, as soon as he saw them.
</p><p>“We’ve had three fights,” said Jasper Jay.
</p><p>“Yes! And I’ve whipped him each time!” cried Mr. Crow. “So I must be in
the right. And you’d better decide our dispute in my favor at once.”
</p><p>But Solomon Owl was still in no hurry.
</p><p>“It’s a difficult question to settle,‘ said he. ’I don’t want to make any
mistake. So I shall have to ask you to come back here to-morrow at this
time.”
</p><p>Both Jasper and Mr. Crow seemed disappointed. Although Mr. Crow had won
each fight, he was very weary, for he was older than Jasper Jay.
</p><p>As they went off, Solomon Owl began to feel much pleased with himself.
</p><p>The following evening, at sunset, old Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay visited
Solomon Owl once more. And they looked more battered than ever.
</p><p>“We’ve had three more fights,” said Mr. Crow.
</p><p>“Yes! And I won each time!” Jasper Jay piped up. “So I must be in the
right. And you’d better decide in my favor without any further delay.”
</p><p>Solomon Owl thought deeply for some time.
</p><p>“Maybe I ought to wait until to-morrow——” he began.
</p><p>But his callers both shouted “No!”
</p><p>“Well,” said Solomon, “Mr. Crow has won three fights; and Jasper Jay has
won three. So it is certain that each must be in the wrong.”
</p><p>But that announcement did not satisfy Jasper and Mr. Crow. And they left
the hemlock grove, disputing more loudly than ever.
</p><p>And the next day, at dusk, they came back again.
</p><p>“We’ve had three more fights; and I won!” they both cried at the same
time.
</p><p>“That proves my claim,” said Solomon Owl. “You’re both wrong.”
</p><p>They whispered together for a few minutes.
</p><p>“We don’t like your way of settling disputes,” Mr. Crow remarked shortly.
“But we’ve decided to stop quarreling.”
</p><p>“Good!” said Solomon Owl. “That shows that you are sensible.”
</p><p>“Yes!” replied Jasper. “We’ve decided to stop quarreling and fight <u>you</u>!”
</p><p>“Wait a moment!” said Solomon Owl hastily, as they drew nearer. “I don’t
want my new suit spoiled.” And he ducked inside the hollow tree before
they could reach him.
</p><p>Jasper and Mr. Crow waited and waited. But Solomon Owl did not reappear.
And since his two visitors did not dare follow him into the dark cavern
where he lived, they decided at last that they would go home—and get into
bed.
</p><p>“Let’s take away his sign, anyhow!” Jasper Jay suggested.
</p><p>So they pulled down Solomon’s sign, which said “Disputes Settled Within,”
and they carried it off with them and hid it in some bushes.
</p><p>That same night Solomon Owl hunted for it for a long time. But he never
found it.
</p><p>He decided not to hang out another, for he saw that settling disputes was
a dangerous business.
