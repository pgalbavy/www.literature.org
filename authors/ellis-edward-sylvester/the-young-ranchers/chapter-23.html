<p>Meanwhile Tim Brophy found himself in the hottest quarters of
his life.</p>

<p>Inspired by the same desperate thought of his friend, he strove,
with all the energy he possessed, to widen the space between himself
and his pursuers. Less fleet of foot than they, it took but a
few seconds to show him the hopelessness of the task.</p>

<p>None of the trees was large enough to give protection to his
body, but seeing no rocks that could serve him, he dodged behind
the first trunk that presented itself. This was barely six inches
in diameter, and was no better than nothing at all.</p>

<p>Pausing but a moment, he leaped away again, with that wild, aimless
impulse which comes over one when panic-stricken. The halt, brief
though it was, proved fatal. His pursuer was on his heels, and
the brave youth turned at bay. As if fate was against him, when
he attempted to bring his rifle to a level, he made a slip and
it dropped from his grasp. He had no time to pick it up.</p>

<p>"S'render! s'render!" called his foe in good English, waving
his right hand aloft with his gun grasped in it.</p>

<p>"I'll surrender, ye spalpeen!"</p>

<p>Resorting like a flash to nature's weapons, the Irishman delivered
a blow straight from the shoulder, which sent the Sioux spinning
backward with his feet pointing toward the sky.</p>

<p>Had he been the only foe to contend with, Tim might have saved
himself, for the savage was utterly "knocked out," and the opportunity
to finish him could not have been better.</p>

<p>Tim had his revolver, but in his excitement he forgot the important
fact. He was about to leap upon his prostrate enemy, with the
intention of snatching his gun from him and using it, when the
other two Sioux burst to view.</p>

<p>Without waiting for them to assail him, the youth dashed forward
like a panther at bay.</p>

<p>Before the foremost could elude the assault, he struck him as
fairly as he had hit the other, and he sprawled on his back, with
the breath driven from his body.</p>

<p>But the impetus of his blow carried Tim forward, and, half tripping
in his headlong rush, he fell on his hands and knees. He strove
frantically to save himself, but, before he could struggle to
his feet, the other Sioux dealt him a stroke with the butt of
his gun which laid the fellow helpless on his face.</p>

<p>The skull of the Irishman, however, was tough, and he quickly
recovered, but not before several other warriors appeared on the
scene.</p>

<p>For one moment the young rancher meditated a rush upon them,
and had actually doubled his fists for that purpose, but even
in his fury he perceived the folly of such a course. If he assailed
the Sioux, they would quickly finish him then and there, while
the fact of their having spared his life thus far proved that
they did not intend to put him to instant death.</p>

<p>It was with singular emotions that he recognized among the last
arrivals the Carlisle student Starcus, who had saved his life
the preceding morning by his timely shot when the grizzly bear
was upon him. The presence of the "civilized" youth among the
hostiles told its own story.</p>

<p>"Ye've got me foul," said Tim, looking straight at Starcus as
he spoke; "and now ye may do wid me what ye loikes."</p>

<p>Starcus, knowing the words and look were meant for him, made
no answer, but kept in the background.</p>

<p>He was grim and silent. Who shall say what thoughts were stirring
his heart at that trying moment! He had sat with this youth at
the table of George Starr and his family.</p>

<p>He had partaken of their hospitality, and had claimed to possess
the civilization which he was anxious his own race should adopt,
but here he was, taking part in the pursuit and attack of two
youths who not only had never done him harm, but had always acted
the part of friends toward him.</p>

<p>There was one curious fact (and yet, perhaps it was not so curious
after all) which was evident to the captured youth. The Sioux
admired the brave fight he had made for himself. Trained for ages
to regard physical prowess as above all virtues, the American
race cannot fail to revere it, even when they are the sufferers
therefrom.</p>

<p>The warrior who had first felt the weight of Tim's fist now began
clambering to his feet. He was dazed and bewildered, for the blow
was a terrific one. Landing squarely in his face, it had brought
considerable crimson, which, mingling with the daubs of paint
already there, gave him a frightful appearance.</p>

<p>He assumed the upright posture, and standing uncertainly for
a few seconds, fixed his eyes on the prisoner.</p>

<p>Then grasping the situation, and recognizing him as the individual
that had treated him so harshly, he suddenly emitted a shout,
whipped out his hunting-knife, and rushed at him like a fury.
Tim instantly threw himself into a pugilistic attitude, and no
doubt would have given a good account of himself had he been permitted,
for he was skilled in the art of self-defence, and such a person
always has the advantage over a foe, no matter what his weapon,
provided it is not a firearm.</p>

<p>But the collision did not take place. Three Indians interposed,
restraining the fierce red man; among the foremost being Starcus,
who roughly seized the upraised arm and forced the warrior back
several steps, using some strong words in his own language. The
savage strove to free himself that he might attack the youth,
but he was not permitted, and finally gave up the effort and withdrew
sullenly into the background.</p>

<p>This incident was hardly over, when the second warrior that had
gone down before the young Irishman's prowess also gained his
feet. He looked as if he would very much like to try conclusions
again, with the aid of one of his weapons, but he seemed to think
he could bide his time, and have it out on a more fitting occasion.</p>

<p>The captive was too wise to place a favorable construction on
the interference of Starcus, despite the additional fact of his
kindly offices of the morning. The rest of the Sioux had shown
a wish to take him prisoner, for certainly the chance to bring
him down had been theirs more than once. Actuated by their intense
hatred of the white race, they looked upon sudden death as too
merciful to a foe that had done them so much ill. He had slain
one of their best men, and knocked prostrate two others; no punishment,
therefore, was too cruel to be visited upon him.</p>

<p>While the group stood about the helpless captive they talked
in their own language, without Tim being able to guess the meaning
of a word uttered. He watched the countenances closely, and was
surprised a minute or two later by the appearance of the last
member of the party. He came straggling up as though he felt no
concern in the proceedings. That which interested Tim the most
was the sight of his valued Winchester in the fellow's hand. For
one moment the youth thought he meant to hand it over to him,
but that would have been a stretch of hospitality of which none
of his race could ever be guilty. He did a rare thing for an Indian&mdash;indulged
in a grin of pleasure at the prize which his companions had passed
by to allow it to fall into his possession.</p>

<p>In his trying situation, Tim Brophy could not avoid a feeling
of curiosity concerning Starcus. To him the fellow's conduct was
inexplicable. While his presence among the Sioux was proof that
he was "with them" in thought, intention, and feeling, yet there
was the friendly act of the morning during the struggle with the
grizzly, and his late interference to prevent the warrior from
injuring him, which united to puzzle the captive.</p>

<p>As has been said, he was too wise to build much hope on these
facts, but nevertheless they raised doubts and questions relating
wholly to the future.</p>

<p>Would Starcus continue to hold his present enmity to the people
that had been friendly to him?</p>

<p>While he had been carried away by the frenzy that had driven
so many of his people out of their senses, was not an awakening
likely to take place, when his better nature would resume control?
Could he forget that he had eaten salt with this hapless fellow,
and stand by, without raising hand or voice, when his extremity
should come, as come it must, in a very brief while?</p>

<p>But these were questions that Tim Brophy could not answer; they
must be left for the immediate future.</p>
