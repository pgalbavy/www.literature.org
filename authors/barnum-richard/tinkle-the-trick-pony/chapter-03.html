<p>Dapple Gray, running toward the hole which the horses had made by
pushing against the fence, met Tinkle’s mother going into the swamp.
</p><p>“Oh, my dear lady!” exclaimed the old fire horse, “you must not go in
there! You really must not!”
</p><p>“Why?” asked Tinkle’s mother. “Oh, I’m sure something dreadful has
happened! Tell me what it is. Is Tinkle――Is Tinkle――” and she could not
ask any more.
</p><p>“Now, it isn’t as bad as you think,” said Dapple Gray. “Horses and
ponies have been caught in the swamp before. I remember when I was a
young colt I――”
</p><p>“Oh, is my little Tinkle caught in the bog?” asked his mother.
</p><p>“Yes, I am sorry to say he is, and so are some of the other ponies and
horses――Tinkle’s father among them,” said Dapple Gray. “But don’t be
worried. All they will have to do will be to stay there until we can
get The Man to come with ropes and pull them out. They won’t be a bit
the worse for the adventure after they wash the mud off. Now please
don’t go in there, my dear lady-horse, or you might get stuck too; and
goodness knows there is trouble enough!”
</p><p>“Oh, I am so sorry Tinkle made trouble!” exclaimed his mother. “He is
usually such a good little pony――”
</p><p>“Oh well, boys will be boys!” exclaimed Dapple Gray, or he said
something about like that which meant the same thing. And you all know
how frisky colts are; always kicking up their heels and never knowing
where they are going to land.
</p><p>“Of course Tinkle didn’t do exactly right in running away and making
this trouble,” said Dapple Gray in a kind voice. “But then it will be a
lesson to him, and he won’t do it again, I’m sure.”
</p><p>“I should think once <u>would</u> be enough,” sighed his mother. “But are
you sure I can not do anything to help?”
</p><p>“Not in there,” said Dapple Gray, nodding his head toward the swamp.
“But you can come with me, if you like, and we’ll go to get The Man to
help pull Tinkle and the others out of the swamp.”
</p><p>“Yes, I’ll do that!” whinnied Tinkle’s mother.
</p><p>So she and Dapple Gray ran back to the green meadow.
</p><p>“What is it? What is it?” asked all the other animals that were waiting
by the hole in the fence. These were the horses and the ponies who had
not gone into the swamp.
</p><p>Dapple Gray quickly told them of the trouble. At the same time he said:
</p><p>“Don’t any of you go in there. The ground is too soft now and if a lot
of you horses trample on it that will make it so much the softer, and
The Man and his friends will have trouble getting in with their ropes
and boards. So please keep out.”
</p><p>The horses promised they would, while Dapple Gray and Tinkle’s mother
ran as fast as they could across the meadow. They wanted to get to the
long lane which led to the barn, not far from which was the house where
lived “The Man,” as the horses called Mr. John Carter, the stock dealer.
</p><p>“How are we going to tell him that Tinkle and the others are in the
mire?” asked the pony’s mother. “We can’t talk man-talk, you know.”
</p><p>“Yes, I know,” said Dapple Gray. “But I guess I can find a way to make
him understand. I know what I’ll do,” he said, as he galloped on. “I’ll
pick up a piece of rope in the barn and take it to The Man in my teeth.
He’ll know that means we want him to bring other ropes and get the
horses out of the swamp.”
</p><p>“I hope he will understand,” said Tinkle’s mother.
</p><p>“Oh, I think he will,” replied Dapple Gray, hopefully.
</p><p>As they ran past the barn, the big doors of which were open, the old
fire horse trotted inside. He looked about, and on the floor he saw a
piece of rope. Picking this up in his teeth, Dapple Gray, with Tinkle’s
mother, ran on toward the house. Out in the back yard stood Mr. Carter
talking to some of his hands.
</p><p>“Look!” suddenly called one of the men. “Some of the horses are out of
the meadow. They’re coming here!”
</p><p>“So they are!” ejaculated Mr. Carter. “I wonder what that means.”
</p><p>“And Dapple Gray has a rope in his teeth,” went on the man.
</p><p>“Why, so he has!” exclaimed Mr. Carter. “I wonder what <u>that</u> means.”
</p><p>Right up to where the stock breeder and his men stood ran Dapple Gray
and Tinkle’s mother. The old fire horse stretched out his neck and
shook his head up and down, the rope flapping to and fro. He seemed to
be offering it to Mr. Carter.
</p><p>“Ha! Dapple wants something,” said the stockman. “I wonder what it is.
I wish he could talk.”
</p><p>And then Dapple Gray did something which was almost as good as talking.
He rubbed the rope that was in his mouth against Mr. Carter’s hand,
and then, dropping it at his feet, took hold of the man’s coat in his
teeth. Then the old fire horse began to pull gently, just as often a
dog, when it finds some one in danger, will try to lead somebody to the
place to help.
</p><p>“Why!” cried the surprised Mr. Carter. “I believe Dapple wants me to
come with him.”
</p><p>“That’s what he does!” exclaimed one of the hands.
</p><p>“But what about the rope?” asked another.
</p><p>“Maybe he wants me to bring that, too,” observed the stockman. “I
wonder if anything can have happened to the horses?”
</p><p>“I’ll go and take a look,” offered Mr. Carter’s overseer. He quickly
ran to a place where he could look down into the green meadow.
</p><p>“What is it?” asked Mr. Carter.
</p><p>“All the horses seem to be over near a hole in the fence,” the man
reported. “And some seem to be missing. I don’t see that little pony,
Tinkle, anywhere.”
</p><p>“Whew!” whistled Mr. Carter. “Something certainly has happened. This is
Tinkle’s mother,” he went on, looking at Dapple’s companion.
</p><p>“Wouldn’t it be queer if Tinkle were in trouble, and she had come to
get you to help him?” asked the overseer.
</p><p>And of course you and I know that is just what Tinkle’s mother did
want, but the stockman and his helpers did not know that yet.
</p><p>“I think I see what the trouble is!” suddenly cried Mr. Carter. “Some
of the animals must have broken down the fence and gotten into the
swamp! They’re mired there! We must get ropes and haul them out. Smart
horse, is Dapple to tell me that! I’ll come right away. Come on, men!
Lively now.”
</p><p>The man ran toward the barn for ropes, led by Mr. Carter. Though Dapple
and Tinkle’s mother could not understand what the men said, they knew
that help would soon be carried to Tinkle and the others held fast
in the mud. They trotted along after the men, who were talking among
themselves.
</p><p>Of course horses and ponies understand some man-talk, else how would
they know they are to stop when a man says “Whoa!” or to start when
they hear “Gid-dap!” or to back when told to do so. But it takes a
little time for a horse to get to know these words, just as it does
your dog to know you want him to run toward you when you say: “Come
here!” or go back when you point toward home, and tell him to go there.
</p><p>“Things will be all right now,” said Dapple Gray to Tinkle’s mother,
using horse-talk, of course. “The Man will soon have all the horses and
ponies out of the bog.”
</p><p>“Oh, I’m so glad you thought of a way to tell him,” said Tinkle’s
mother.
</p><p>Taking some ropes and planks out of the barn, Mr. Carter and his men
ran on toward the green meadow. It did not take them long to reach the
broken fence.
</p><p>“Here’s where the rascals got through to the swamp!” cried Mr. Carter.
“I must make the fence much stronger.”
</p><p>Of course he did not know that Tinkle had made all the trouble by first
jumping over the fence. The others had only broken it down to go to
help the boy-pony.
</p><p>“Come on!” cried the stockman. “That bog is a bad place. If they sink
down too far we’ll never be able to get them up again. Come on, I say!”
</p><p>On ran the men with the planks and the ropes. They soon came to the
place where the horses and ponies were mired, as it is called.
</p><p>“Tinkle is in deeper than any of them,” said Mr. Carter. “We must get
him out first.”
</p><p>The men laid down the wide planks. The pieces of wood were so broad
that they did not sink down in the soft mud, any more than wide snow
shoes will sink down when an Indian, or any man, walks on them.
</p><p>Then, standing on the planks, the men put ropes about Tinkle and began
to pull on them. They also laid down planks near him so that when he
got one foot out of the mire he could put it on a plank and it would
not sink down again.
</p><p>After some hard work and much pulling on the ropes, which hurt the
little pony, Tinkle was pulled out of the swamp, and led to firm, dry
ground, back in the meadow.
</p><p>“And now you’d better stay there,” said Mr. Carter. “Don’t try a thing
like this again.”
</p><p>“No indeed, you must never do it again!” said Tinkle’s mother, for she
could tell by Mr. Carter’s voice that he was, in a way, scolding the
pony. “See what a lot of trouble you made your father and me, as well
as Dapple Gray and our other friends,” said Tinkle’s mother.
</p><p>“I――I’m sorry,” said the little pony. “I’m never going to run away
again.”
</p><p>“And see how muddy and dirty you are,” went on his mother. “You had
better go to the brook and wash yourself.”
</p><p>“Oh, let me stay and watch them get my father and the others out of the
swamp,” begged Tinkle, so his mother let him stay.
</p><p>It was not quite so hard to get the others out as it had been to save
Tinkle, for they were not so deep in the mud. But it took Mr. Carter
and his men quite a while. Finally, however, the ponies and the horses
were all saved from the swamp.
</p><p>“And I hope they never get caught that way again,” said the stockman,
while Tinkle and the ponies and the horses hoped the same thing.
</p><p>After the mud was washed off them, the animals were not much worse off
for what had happened. Tinkle was sorry and ashamed for all the trouble
he had caused, and he told the other ponies and his horse-friends so.
</p><p>For some time after this Tinkle lived with his father, mother and
friends in the green meadow. He played with the other children-ponies,
but he did not try to run away again. He did want to have some
adventures, though, and he was soon to have some very strange ones.
</p><p>One day, about a year later, a rich man called at the stock farm to buy
a horse for his carriage. With the man, who was a Mr. Farley, was his
son George, about nine years old.
</p><p>“Yes, I have some good carriage horses,” said Mr. Carter to Mr. Farley.
“Suppose you come down to the meadow and pick out the one you like
best.”
</p><p>“May I come too?” asked George.
</p><p>“Yes, I think so,” answered his father. “The horses won’t kick; will
they?” he questioned.
</p><p>“Oh, not at all,” answered Mr. Carter. “They are all gentle.”
</p><p>So George went with his father to look at the horses. But no sooner had
the little boy caught sight of the ponies than he cried:
</p><p>“Oh, see the little horses. I want one of them. Please, Daddy, buy me a
pony!”
</p><p>“Eh? What’s that? Buy you a pony!” cried his father, half teasing. “Why
you couldn’t ride a pony.”
</p><p>“Oh, yes I could!” said the little boy. “Anyhow I could drive him
hitched to a pony cart.”
</p><p>“But we haven’t a pony cart.”
</p><p>“Well, couldn’t you get one? Oh, please get me a pony, Daddy!”
</p><p>“Ah, um! Well, which one would you want, if you could have one?” asked
Mr. Farley, half in fun.
</p><p>George looked over the ponies who were cropping grass not far away. The
boy’s eyes rested longest on Tinkle, for Tinkle was a pretty pony, with
four white feet and a white star right in the middle of his head.
</p><p>“This is the pony I want!” cried George, and, before his father could
stop him the boy ran straight to Tinkle and put his arms around the
pony’s neck.
