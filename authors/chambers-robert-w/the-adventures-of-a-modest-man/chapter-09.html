<p>Turning to the man behind him Seabury attempted to extract a
little information, and the man was very affable and anxious to
be of help, but all he could do was to nod and utter Teutonic
gutturals through a bushy beard with a deep, buzzing sound, and
Seabury sank back, beaten and dejected.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he muttered to himself, "is the entire Fatherland
travelling on this accursed car! I &mdash;I've half a mind&#11834;"</p>

<p>He stole a doubtful sidelong glance at his blue-eyed neighbor
across the aisle, but she was looking out of her own window this
time, her cheeks buried in the fur of her chinchilla muff.</p>

<p>"And after all," he reflected, "if I ask her, she might turn
out to be of the same nationality." But it was not exactly that
which prevented him.</p>

<p>The train was slowing down; sundry hoarse toots from the locomotive
indicated a station somewhere in the vicinity.</p>

<p>"Plue Pirt Lake! Change heraus f√ºr Bleasant Falley!" shouted
the conductor, opening the forward door. He lingered long enough
to glare balefully at Seabury, then, as nobody apparently cared
either to get out at Blue Bird Lake or change for Pleasant Valley,
he slammed the door and jerked the signal rope; the locomotive
emitted a scornful Teutonic grunt; the train moved forward into
the deepening twilight of the December night.</p>

<p>The snow was now falling more heavily&mdash;it was light enough to
see that&mdash;a fine gray powder sifting down out of obscurity, blowing
past the windows in misty streamers.</p>

<p>The bulky man opposite breathed on the pane, rubbed it with a
thumb like a pincushion, and peered out.</p>

<p>"Der next station iss Beverly," he said.</p>

<p>"The next is Peverly?"</p>

<p>"No, der next iss _B_everly; und der nextest iss Peverly.</p>

<p>"Then, if I am going to Beverly, I get out at the next station,
don't I?" stammered the perplexed young fellow, trying to be polite.</p>

<p>The man became peevish. "Nun, wass ist es?" he growled. "I dell
you Peverly und you say Beverly. Don'd I know vat it iss I say
alretty?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but <em>I</em> don't&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Also, you ged owid vere you tam blease!" retorted the incensed
passenger, and resumed his newspaper, hunching himself around
to present nothing to Seabury except a vast expanse of neck and
shoulder.</p>

<p>Seabury, painfully embarrassed, let it go at that. Probably the
poor man <em>had</em> managed to enunciate the name of the station
properly; no doubt the next stop was Beverly, after all. He was
due there at 6.17. He looked at his watch. It was a quarter past
six already. The next stop <em>must</em> be Beverly&mdash;supposing
the train to be on time.</p>

<p>And already the guttural warning of the locomotive sounded from
the darkness ahead; already he sensed the gritting resistance
of the brakes.</p>

<p>Permitting himself a farewell and perfectly inoffensive glance
across the aisle, he perceived her of the blue eyes and chinchilla
furs preparing for departure; and, what he had not before noticed,
her maid in the seat behind her, gathering a dainty satchel, umbrella,
and suit-case marked C. G.</p>

<p>So she was going to Beverly, too! He hoped she might be bound
for the Christmas Eve frolic at the Austins'. It was perfectly
possible&mdash;in fact, probable.</p>

<p>He was a young man whose optimism colored his personal wishes
so vividly that sometimes what he desired became presently, in
his imagination, a charming and delightful probability. And already
his misgivings concerning the proper name of the next station
had vanished. He <em>wanted</em> Beverly to be the next station,
and already it was, for him. Also, he had quite made up his mind
that she of the chinchillas was bound for the Austins'.</p>

<p>A cynical blast from the locomotive; a jerking pull of brakes,
and, from the forward smoker, entered the fat conductor.</p>

<p>"Beverly! Beverly!" he shouted.</p>

<p>So he, too, had managed to master his <em>P's</em> and <em>B's</em>,
concluded the young man, smiling to himself as he rose, invested
himself with his heavy coat, and picked up his suit-case.</p>

<p>The young lady of the chinchillas had already left the car, followed
by her maid, before he stepped into the aisle ready for departure.</p>

<p>A shadow of misgiving fell upon him when, glancing politely at
his fellow-passenger, he encountered only a huge sneer, and concluded
that the nod of courtesy was superfluous.</p>

<p>Also he hesitated as he passed the fat conductor, who was glaring
at him, mouth agape&mdash;hesitated a moment only, then, realizing
the dreadful possibilities of reopening the subject, swallowed
his question in silence.</p>

<p>"It's <em>got</em> to be Beverly, now," he thought, making his
way to the snowy platform and looking about him for some sign
of a conveyance which might be destined for him. There were several
sleighs and depot-wagons there&mdash;a number of footmen bustling about
in furs.</p>

<p>"I'll just glance at the name of the station to be sure," he
thought to himself, peering up through the thickly descending
snow where the name of the station ought to be. And, as he stepped
out to get a good view, he backed into a fur-robed footman, who
touched his hat in hasty apology.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bailey! Is that you?" said Seabury, relieved to encounter
one of Mrs. Austin's men.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Mr. Seabury, sir! Were you expected&#11834;?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," nodded the young man gayly, abandoning his suit-case
to the footman and following him to a big depot-sleigh.</p>

<p>And there, sure enough, was his lady of the chinchillas, nestling
under the robes to her pretty chin, and her maid on the box with
the coachman&mdash;a strangely fat coachman&mdash;no doubt a new one to
replace old Martin.</p>

<p>When Seabury came up the young lady turned and looked at him,
and he took off his hat politely, and she acknowledged his presence
very gravely and he seated himself decorously, and the footman
swung to the rumble.</p>

<p>Then the chiming silver sleigh-bells rang out through the snow,
the magnificent pair of plumed horses swung around the circle
under the bleared lights of the station and away they speeded
into snowy darkness.</p>

<p>A decent interval of silence elapsed before he considered himself
at liberty to use a traveller's privilege. Then he said something
sufficiently commonplace to permit her the choice of conversing
or remaining silent. She hesitated; she had never been particularly
wedded to silence. Besides, she was scarcely twenty&mdash;much too
young to be wedded to anything. So she said something, with perfect
composure, which left the choice to him. And his choice was obvious.</p>

<p>"I have no idea how far it is; have you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said coolly.</p>

<p>"This is a jolly sleigh," he continued with unimpaired cheerfulness.</p>

<p>She thought it comfortable. And for a while the conversation
clung so closely around the sleigh that it might have been run
over had not he dragged it into another path.</p>

<p>"Isn't it amazing how indifferent railroads are to the convenience
of their passengers?"</p>

<p>She turned her blue eyes on him; there was the faintest glimmer
in their depths.</p>

<p>"I know you saw me running after that train," he said, laughingly
attempting to break the ice.</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. And it amused you, I think."</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows a trifle. "What is there amusing about
that?"</p>

<p>"But you <em>did</em> smile&mdash;at least I thought so."</p>

<p>Evidently she had no comment to offer. She <em>was</em> hard
to talk to. But he tried again.</p>

<p>"The fact is, I never expected to catch your&mdash;that train. It
was only when I saw&mdash;saw"&mdash;he floundered on the verge of saying
"you," but veered off hastily&mdash;"when I saw that brakeman's expression
of tired contempt, I simply sailed through the air like a&mdash;a&mdash;like
a&mdash;one of those&mdash;er you know&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Do you mean kangaroos?" she ventured so listlessly that the
quick flush of chagrin on his face died out again; because it
was quite impossible that such infantine coldness and candour
could be secretly trifling with his dignity.</p>

<p>"It was a long jump," he concluded gayly, "but I did some jumping
at Harvard and I made it and managed to hold on."</p>

<p>"You were very fortunate," she said, smiling for the first time.</p>

<p>And, looking at her, he thought he was; and he admitted it so
blandly that he overdid the part. But he didn't know that.</p>

<p>"I fancy," he continued, "that everybody on that train except
you and I were Germans. Such a type as sat opposite me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Which car were you in?" she asked simply.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;in your car&#11834;"</p>

<p>"In <em>my</em> car?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;er&mdash;yes," he explained; "you were sitting across the aisle,
you know."</p>

<p>"Was I?" she asked with pleasant surprise; "across the aisle
from you?"</p>

<p>He grew red; he had certainly supposed that she had noticed him
enough to identify him again. Evidently she had not. Mistakes
like that are annoying. Every man instinctively supposes himself
enough of an entity to be noticed by a pretty woman.</p>

<p>"I had no end of trouble of finding out where Beverly was," he
said after a minute.</p>

<p>"Oh! And how did you find out?"</p>

<p>"I didn't until I backed into Bailey, yonder.... Do you know
that I had a curious sort of presentiment that I should find you
in this sleigh?"</p>

<p>"That is strange," she said. "When did you have it?"</p>

<p>"In the car&mdash;long before you got off."</p>

<p>She thought it most remarkable&mdash;rather listlessly.</p>

<p>"Those things happen, you know," he went on; "like thinking of
a person you don't expect to see, and looking up and suddenly
seeing that very person walking along."</p>

<p>"How does that resemble your case?" she asked.</p>

<p>It didn't. He realised it even before he began to try to explain
the similarity. It really didn't matter one way or the other;
it was nothing to turn red about, but he was turning. Somehow
or other she managed to say things that never permitted that easy,
graceful flow of language which characterised him in his normal
state. Somehow or other, he felt that he was not doing himself
justice. He could converse well enough with people as a rule.
Something in that topsy-turvy and maddeningly foolish colloquy
with those Germans must have twisted his tongue or unbalanced
his logic.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," he said, "there's no similarity between
the two cases except the basic idea of premonition."</p>

<p>She had been watching him disentangle himself with bright eyes
in which something was sparkling&mdash;perhaps sympathy and perhaps
not. It may have been the glimmer of malice. Perhaps she thought
him just a trifle too ornamental&mdash;for he certainly was a very
good-looking youth&mdash;perhaps something in the entire episode appealed
to her sense of mischief. Probably even she herself could not
explain just why she had thought it funny to see him running for
his train, and later entangling himself in a futile word-fest
with the conductor and the large mottled man.</p>

<p>"So," she said thoughtfully, "you were obsessed by a premonition."</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;er&mdash;exactly obsessed," he said suspiciously. Then his face
cleared. How could anybody be suspicious of such sweetly inquiring
frankness? "You see," he admitted, "that <em>I&mdash;</em>well, I rather
hoped you would be going to the Austins'."</p>

<p>"The <em>Austins'</em>!" she repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes. I &mdash;I couldn't help speculating&#11834;"</p>

<p>"About me?" she asked. "Why should you?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>there was no reason, of course, only I k-kept seeing
you without trying to&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I couldn't help seeing you, could I?"</p>

<p>"Not if you were looking at me," she murmured, pressing her muff
to her face. Perhaps she was cold.</p>

<p>Again it occurred to him that there was something foolish in
her reply. Certainly she was a little difficult to talk to. But
then she was young&mdash;very young and&mdash;close enough to being a beauty
to excuse herself from any overstrenuous claim to intellectuality.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said kindly and patiently, "I did see you, and I did
hope that you were going to the Austins'. And then I bumped into
somebody and there you were. I don't mean," as she raised her
pretty eyebrows&mdash;"mean that you were Bailey. Good Lord, <em>what</em>
is the matter with my tongue!" he said, flushing with annoyance.
"I don't talk this way usually."</p>

<p>"Don't you?" she managed to whisper behind her muff.</p>

<p>"No, I don't. That conductor's jargon seems to have inoculated
me. You will probably not believe it, but I <em>can</em> talk
the English tongue sometimes&#11834;"</p>

<p>She was laughing now&mdash;a clear, delicious, irrepressible little
peal that rang sweetly in the frosty air, harmonising with the
chiming sleigh-bells. And he laughed, too, still uncomfortably
flushed.</p>

<p>"Do you think it would help if we began all over again?" she
asked, looking wickedly at him over her muff. "Let me see&mdash;you
had an obsession which turned into a premonition that bumped Bailey
and you found it wasn't Bailey at all, but a stranger in chinchillas
who was going to&mdash;<em>where</em> did you say she was going? Oh,
to the Austins'! <em>That</em> is clear, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"About as clear as anything that's happened to me to-night,"
he said.</p>

<p>"A snowy night does make a difference," she reflected.</p>

<p>"<em>A&mdash;</em>a difference?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;doesn't it?" she asked innocently.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>in <em>what</em>?"</p>

<p>"In clearness. Things are clearer by daylight?"</p>

<p>"I don't see &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>exactly how&mdash;as a matter of fact
I don't follow you at all," he said desperately. "You say things&mdash;and
they sound all right&mdash;but somehow my answers seem queer. <em>Do</em>
you suppose that German conversation has mentally twisted me?"</p>

<p>Her eyes above the fluffy fur of her muff were bright as stars,
but she did not laugh.</p>

<p>"Suppose," she said, demurely, "that <em>you</em> choose a subject
of conversation and try to make sense of it. If you <em>are</em>
mentally twisted it will be good practice."</p>

<p>"And you will&mdash;you won't say things &mdash;I mean things not
germane to the subject?"</p>

<p>"Did you say German?"</p>

<p>"No, germane."</p>

<p>"Oh! Have <em>I</em> been irrelevant, too?"</p>

<p>"Well, you mixed up mental clarity with snowy nights. Of course
it was a little joke &mdash;I saw that soon enough; I'd have seen
it at once, only I <em>am</em> rather upset and nervous after
that German experience."</p>
