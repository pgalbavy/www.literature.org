<p>Fully realizing the mistake he had made in waiting, the rancher
now did his best to improve the precious time at his disposal.</p>

<p>His own pony had remained obediently near his companion, while
the brush was going on between his master and the Sioux on the
other side of the stream. The former hastily climbed into the
saddle, and taking the reins in hand, looked at his wife.</p>

<p>"Are you ready, Molly?"</p>

<p>"I have been for a long time."</p>

<p>"Come on; keep close to me."</p>

<p>He spoke briskly to his horse, who broke into a swift gallop,
which was imitated so promptly by the other that the couple advanced
abreast toward the wooded section. It was no time for conversation,
and the progress continued in silence.</p>

<p>The snow was now falling thick and fast, and the gloom had deepened
to that extent that they could not see objects more than a hundred
feet away. Both wife and husband continually glanced behind them,
for they were almost certain that the red men were in the act
of crossing the stream at the moment the start was made, and could
not be far to the rear.</p>

<p>True, the fugitives had much in their favor. The keen eyes of
the pursuers could detect their trail in the snowy ground, but
not for long. By and by they might trace it only by dropping down
from their ponies and using the sense of feeling. This would compel
them to proceed carefully, and hold them well to the rear while
the whites were using the occasion to the utmost, and continually
gaining ground. Had the route to Fort Meade been level and unobstructed,
they could have asked nothing more favorable. They would have
forced their ponies to the utmost, and by the time the sun rose
the vengeful red men would be placed hopelessly behind.</p>

<p>The straining vision saw nothing but the darkness and snow in
the direction of the stream already crossed, but they could never
feel relieved of the dreadful fear until safely within the military
post of the Black Hills.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, I see a horse!" was the startling exclamation of Dot,
whom her mother had supposed, because of her stillness and immobility,
to be asleep.</p>

<p>"Where?" demanded her father, grasping his Winchester and looking
affrightedly around.</p>

<p>"Not there," replied the child with a laugh, working her arm
out of its environments, and pointing ahead.</p>

<p>A solitary animal was observed standing as motionless as a statue
a short distance in advance. Apprehensive of some trap by the
Indians, the father brought his pony to a sudden stop, his wife
instantly imitating him, and both peered ahead at the strange
form.</p>

<p>They could see no rider, though there was something on the animal's
back, which might have been a warrior lying flat, so as to protect
his body from the rifle of the white man, or, what was equally
probable, the owner was standing on the ground hidden by the horse,
and awaiting his chance to send in a fatal shot.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Dot, puzzled by the action of her
parents.</p>

<p>"S-h! We are afraid a bad Indian is there."</p>

<p>"Why, can't you see that's Jerry?"</p>

<p>Jerry was the name of the pack pony.</p>

<p>"Of course it is. Why didn't we think of it?" asked the father
the next moment, relieved beyond measure by the discovery.</p>

<p>Jerry seemed to be of the opinion that it was the place of his
friends to make the advances, for he did not stir until they rode
up beside him.</p>

<p>The lazy fellow was found with his load intact. He had been given
all the time he could ask for his journey to this point, and evidently
was a little sulky over the treatment received at the hands, or
rather the foot, of his master, for his head had to be jerked
several times before he faced about, and then it required more
vigorous treatment to force him into a lazy gallop.</p>

<p>Luckily, the greater part of the plain had been crossed before
this reunion took place, and the party had not gone far when the
rancher allowed the animals to drop to a walk. In front loomed
a dark mass, which he recognized as the fringe of the wood observed
from the bank of the stream behind them. Through this it was necessary
to thread their way with extreme care, owing to the darkness and
their unfamiliarity with the ground.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the edge of the wood the fugitives came to a stand-still.</p>

<p>Slipping from his saddle, the rancher brushed away the snow at
his feet and pressed his ear against the ground.</p>

<p>"I can hear nothing of them," he remarked, resuming the upright
posture; "I am quite hopeful that that party will molest us no
more."</p>

<p>"It won't do to count on it," were the wise words of his wife.</p>

<p>"I think you had better dismount and lead your pony," said the
rancher; "we can mount again when through the wood; there will
be less danger from the trees and limbs, and you and Dot must
be cramped from sitting so long."</p>

<p>He helped them to the ground. It was a relief indeed to both,
for they had kept their places on the back of the horse for a
number of hours. Dot yawned, stretched her limbs, and felt as
though nothing would delight her so much as a frolic in the snow.
The thoughtful mother had provided her not only with thick, strong
shoes, but with heavy stockings, leggings, and warm clothing,
with which she was well protected against the storm that was impending
when they left their home.</p>

<p>Nothing could have better shown the childish innocence of her
nature than her action in slyly removing her mittens, stooping
down, packing a wad of snow with her hands and flinging it against
her father's face, with a merry laugh.</p>

<p>"Gracious, Dot! how you startled me!" he said, looking around
at her.</p>

<p>"Did I hurt you?"</p>

<p>"No; but don't speak or laugh so loud, for some of the bad Indians
may be near."</p>

<p>"I forgot about that, but I'm going to hit Jerry, for he is so
lazy he needs it."</p>

<p>And the indolent animal received a tiny whack from the snowy
missile projected by the chubby hand of the child. He seemed to
think, however, that it was no more than a snowflake, for he did
not give even an extra wink of the eye.</p>

<p>The delay was only momentary, when the rancher, with one hand
grasping the bridle-rein and the other parting the limbs and bushes
in front, began groping his way through the growth of timber,
where it was so dark that everyone's eyes were practically useless.</p>

<p>Directly behind the horse walked Dot, with her mother next, leading
her pony, and the pack-horse bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>Ten minutes of this cautious progress and the leader checked
himself with an impatient expression.</p>

<p>"What is it?" called the wife, in a guarded voice.</p>

<p>"Another stream of water."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; I came near tumbling into it, with Dick on top of me;
if he hadn't scented it first I would have done so."</p>

<p>"What is to be done?" asked Mrs. Starr, as grievously disappointed
as her husband.</p>

<p>"I'm blessed if I know; it may be half a mile deep and ten miles
across, with a perpendicular bluff a thousand feet high on the
other side."</p>

<p>Leaving her pony, the wife took the hand of Dot and joined him
where he had halted on the edge of the unknown stream.</p>

<p>"I've made up my mind that we shall do one thing right away,"
he remarked decisively.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Eat supper while we have the chance; Jerry is on hand with the
provisions, and he may be somewhere else in the morning."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that," said the happy Dot, "for I'm awfuller hungry
than I ever was in all my life."</p>

<p>"Then supper it is."</p>
