<p>While Jack Gedney stood on the fallen tree which spanned the
stream, watching the panther’s dying struggles in the water below,
he suddenly learned that its mate was creeping upon him from the
rear.</p>

<p>Jack did not stand still, but the next instant ran across the
log to the solid ground on the other side. There he faced about,
and began re-loading his rifle with the utmost haste, for you
will admit that he had no time to lose.</p>

<p>The young hunter did not lose sight of the brute for a moment
while hurrying the charge into the barrel of his weapon.  He expected
to be attacked before he could ram the bullet home, and he meant
in such an event to club his gun, and using the butt once on the
skull of his foe, draw his hunting knife from his inner pocket,
and then have it out with him.</p>

<p>You will conclude that this was a big contract for a boy only
twelve years old.  So it was indeed, but, like a young pioneer,
he had learned to depend on Heaven and himself, and he awaited
the trial with as much coolness as his father could have done,
even though he knew that the chances were ten to one against winning
in a fight against such a muscular and ferocious beast.</p>

<p>The panther came forward on its slow, soft walk, until one paw
rested on the log along which the lad had run only a moment before.</p>

<p>The animal formed an interesting figure as, placing the second
paw beside the other on the log, he pushed his head forward, so
as to peer over at the dark body drifting down stream.  The action
of the beast lifted his front so that his back sloped down towards
his tail, which for the moment was motionless.  The shoulder-blades
were shoved in two lumps above the line of the neck, which, because
of the nose thrust forward, looked unusually long.</p>

<p>Jack Gedney poured the powder from his horn into the palm of
his left hand at the moment the panther rested both paws on the
log.  He noted the pause of the beast, and his heart leaped with
the hope that there was a possibility of getting his gun loaded
in time.  Leaning his rifle far over, so as to make an inclined
plane, he rapidly brought it up to the perpendicular as the black,
sand-like particles streamed down the barrel.</p>

<p>Next he whipped out a bullet and the little square piece of greased
cloth, shoving both into the muzzle of the weapon.  Still the
panther peered over the log at his lifeless mate.</p>

<p>As the loading of the weapon progressed Jack could hardly control
his excitement.  He snatched out the ramrod with such violence
that it fell from his hand.  Like a flash he stooped, caught it
up, and began shoving the bullet down the tight-fitting bore of
his gun.</p>

<p>He saw the panther move.  With a fierce jamb the bullet was stopped
by the thimbleful of powder nestling in the bottom of the barrel. 
Jack made sure the ball was pressed home when he snatched out
the ramrod and let it fall to the ground: no time now to put it
back in its place.</p>

<p>Only one more step&mdash;to pour the priming into the pan of his weapon.
Jack’s hands trembled as he drew back the iron jaw which gripped
the flint, and dashed some powder into the cavity prepared for
it.  He was overrunning with hope.</p>

<p>The panther, as if satisfied with the last sight of his mate
drifting down stream, turned his head and looked at the sturdy
boy at the other end of the log. He slowly lashed his tail, and
growled savagely, his looks and manners seeming to say&mdash;</p>

<p>"So you’re the young gentleman who has just shot my mate!  Such
being the case, it is my duty to put it out of your power ever
to do anything of the kind again.  I am now going to eat you!"</p>

<p>All four feet were on the bridge, and the frightful beast took
a couple of steps towards his victim.  Then a resounding screech
broke the stillness of the night, and the animal, leaping straight
up in air, rolled back into the water, hardly making another struggle,
for the second bullet of Jack Gedney had entered his neck and
passed straight through his heart.</p>

<p>Stooping to the ground, the youth picked up his ramrod, and,
without moving from the spot, re-charged his weapon.  He did so
with as much coolness as when firing a match with Mr. Burton and
his boys.</p>

<p>"I don’t think there are any more painters near," was his thought;
"but I am ready for them if they will come one at a time, and
far enough apart to give me a chance to load up."</p>

<p>And resting his gun on his shoulder, he took to the path, and
walked steadily homeward.</p>

<p>His father and mother had just sat down to the supper table as
he entered.  The table was of the simplest make, and was without
any cloth covering. Several pine boards rested on four legs&mdash;one
at each corner&mdash;but it was as clean as it could be, and the pewter
tea-pot and few dishes shone brightly enough to serve for mirrors. 
The bread was of dark colour, but sweet and light, and the bacon
might not suit delicate palates, but those who ate of it did so
with a relish as great as though it were roast turkey.</p>

<p>Mr. Gedney took turns with his wife and boy in asking a blessing
upon each meal of which they partook.  He nodded to Jack to signify
that it was his turn, and the boy, closing his eyes, and reverently
bending his head, begged in a few simple words the blessing of
God upon the bounty which He had given them.</p>

<p>"Well," said the father in his cheery voice, as the meal began,
"have you and the boys left any game in the woods for other folk?"</p>

<p>"Will and George had some work to do to-day, and their father
could not spare them.  But they promised to go with me on a hunt
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"How have you spent the day?" asked the mother.</p>

<p>"I helped the boys until near night, and then started for home."</p>

<p>"Then you haven’t had much chance to try your gun?" was the inquiring
remark of the father.</p>

<p>"Not as much as I hoped, but we had a shooting match after dinner."</p>

<p>"A shooting match?  How did you succeed?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Burton beat me."</p>

<p>"He is one of the finest shots in the West; he has actually beaten
<em>me</em> once or twice!  How about the boys?"</p>

<p>"They have never beaten me," was the smiling answer of Jack.</p>

<p>"Nor must they or any one else beat you," added Mr. Gedney, with
a warning shake of his head.  "But haven’t you brought down any
game?"</p>

<p>"Well, I shot a couple of painters on my way home," replied Jack,
in the most indifferent manner, as he buried his big sound teeth
into a slice of bread and butter.</p>

<p>"Did you kill them both?" asked the mother between her sips of
tea.</p>

<p>"Both are so dead that they couldn’t be any deader," was the
reply of Jack.</p>

<p>"After supper you can tell us about it," said the father, showing
no more interest than if they were talking about the "barking"
of a couple of squirrels.</p>

<p>Now, brave and cool as was Jack Gedney, he felt some pride in
his exploit, for it is not often that one is able to kill two
such fierce animals as the American panther without receiving
a scratch himself. But he was not the boy to force his story upon
his friends, and so he finished his meal, and finally sat down
by the broad, cheerful fireplace.</p>

<p>Opposite to him was his father, smoking his pipe, and his mother,
having cleared away the supper things, took up her knitting for
the evening. The only light came from the blazing logs on the
hearth.  This was enough to fill the large room, and render a
candle or lamp unnecessary. The plain calico curtains were not
drawn across the narrow windows, and the latch-string was left
hanging outside, so that any one who chose could enter without
knocking.</p>

<p>Jack waited until asked by his father to tell how it was he came
to kill two "painters."  Then he gave the story as it has been
given to you.</p>

<p>The mother did not stop her knitting during the narration, nor
did the father cease to smoke in his deliberate way, nor ask any
question until it was finished. Then he made some natural inquiries,
and remarked that he did not see how Jack could have done better
than he did.</p>

<p>After this the conversation took a general turn, and lasted perhaps
a couple of hours.  Finally, the latch-string was drawn in, a
chapter read from the Bible, prayer offered up by the father,
after which the little family went to bed. </p>
