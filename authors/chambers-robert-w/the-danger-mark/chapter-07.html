<p>The end of June and of the house party at Roya-Neh was now near
at hand, and both were to close with a moonlight fête and dance
in the forest, invitations having been sent to distant neighbours
who had been entertaining similar gatherings at Iron Hill and
Cloudy Mountain&mdash;the Grays, Beekmans, Ellises, and Grandcourts.</p>

<p>Silks and satins, shoe buckles and powdered hair usually mark
the high tide of imaginative originality among this sort of people.
So it was to be the inevitable Louis <em>XVI </em>fête&mdash;or as
near to it as attenuated, artistic intelligence could manage,
and they altered Duane's very clever and correct sketches to suit
themselves, careless of anachronism, and sent the dainty water-colour
drawings to town in order that those who sweat and sew in the
perfumed ateliers of Fifth Avenue might use them as models.</p>

<p>"The fun&mdash;if there's any in dressing up&mdash;ought to lie in making
your own costumes," observed Duane. But nobody displayed any inclination
to do so. And now, on hurry orders, the sewers in the hot Fifth
Avenue ateliers sewed faster. Silken and satin costumes, paste
jewelry and property small-swords were arriving by express; maids
flew about the house at Roya-Neh, trying on, fussing with lace
and ribbon, bodice and flowered pannier, altering, retrimming,
adjusting. Their mistresses met in one another's bedrooms for
mysterious confabs over head-dress and coiffure, lace scarf, and
petticoat.</p>

<p>As for the men, they surreptitiously tried on their embroidered
coats and breeches, admired themselves in secrecy, and let it
go at that, returning with embarrassed relief to cards, tennis,
and the various forms of amiable idleness to which they were accustomed.
Only Englishmen can masquerade seriously.</p>

<p>Later, however, the men were compelled to pay some semblance
of attention to the general preparations, assemble their foot-gear,
head-gear, stars, orders, sashes, swords, and try them on for
Duane Mallett&mdash;to that young man's unconcealed dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>"You certainly resemble a scratch opera chorus," he observed
after passing in review the sheepish line-up in his room. "Delancy,
you're the limit as a Black Mousquetier&mdash;and, by the way, there
weren't any in the reign of Louis <em>XVI, </em>so perhaps that
evens up matters. Dysart is the only man who looks the real thing&mdash;or
would if he'd remove that monocle. As for Bunny and the Pink 'un,
they ought to be in vaudeville singing la-la-la."</p>

<p>"That's really a compliment to our legs," observed Reggie Wye
to Bunbury Gray, flourishing his property sword and gracefully
performing a <em>pas seul à la Gênée</em>.</p>

<p>Dysart, who had been sullen all day, regarded them morosely.</p>

<p>Scott Seagrave, in his conventional abbé's costume of black and
white, excessively bored, stood by the window trying to catch
a glimpse of the lake to see whether any decent fish were breaking,
while Scott walked around him critically, not much edified by
his costume or the way he wore it.</p>

<p>"You're a sad and self-conscious-looking bunch," he concluded.
"Scott, I suppose you'll insist on wearing your mustache and eyeglasses."</p>

<p>"You bet," said Scott simply.</p>

<p>"All right. And kindly beat it. I want to try on my own plumage
in peace."</p>

<p>So the costumed ones trooped off to their own quarters with the
half-ashamed smirk usually worn by the American male who has persuaded
himself to frivolity. Delancy Grandcourt tramped away down the
hall banging his big sword, jingling his spurs, and flapping his
loose boots. The Pink 'un and Bunbury Gray slunk off into obscurity,
and Scott wandered back through the long hall until a black-and-red
tiger moth attracted his attention, and he forgot his annoying
appearance in frantic efforts to capture the brilliant moth.</p>

<p>Dysart, who had been left alone with Duane in the latter's room,
contemplated himself sullenly in the mirror while Duane, seated
on the window sill, waited for him to go.</p>

<p>"You think I ought to eliminate my eye-glass?" asked Dysart,
still inspecting himself.</p>

<p>"Yes, in deference to the conventional prejudice of the times.
Nobody wore 'em at that period."</p>

<p>"You seem to be a stickler for convention&mdash;of the Louis <em>XVI
</em>sort more than for the <em>XIX </em>century variety," remarked
Dysart with a sneer.</p>

<p>Duane looked up from his bored contemplation of the rug.</p>

<p>"You think I'm unconventional?" he asked with a smile.</p>

<p>"I believe I suggested something of the sort to my wife the other
day."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Duane blandly, "does she agree with you, Dysart?"</p>

<p>"No doubt she does, because your tendencies toward the unconventional
have been the subject of unpleasant comment recently."</p>

<p>"By some of your débutante conquests? You mustn't believe all
they tell you."</p>

<p>"My own eyes and ears are competent witnesses. Do you understand
me now?"</p>

<p>"No. Neither do you. Don't rely on such witnesses, Dysart; they
lack character to corroborate them. Ask your wife to confirm me&mdash;if
you ever find time enough to ask her anything."</p>

<p>"That's a damned impudent thing to say," returned Dysart, staring
at him. A dull red stained his face, then faded.</p>

<p>Duane's eyebrows went up&mdash;just a shade&mdash;yet so insolently that
the other stepped forward, the corners of his mouth white and
twitching.</p>

<p>"I can speak more plainly," he said. "If you can't appreciate
a pleasant hint I can easily accommodate you with the alternative."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment.</p>

<p>"Dysart," said Duane, "what chance do you think you'd have in
landing the&mdash;alternative?"</p>

<p>"That concerns me," said Dysart; and the pinched muscles around
the mouth grew whiter and the man looked suddenly older. Duane
had never before noticed how gray his temples were growing.</p>

<p>He said in a voice under perfect control: "You're right; the
chances you care to take with me concern yourself. As for your
ill-humour, I suppose I have earned it by being attentive to your
wife. What is it you wish; that my hitherto very harmless attentions
should cease?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dysart, and his square jaw quivered.</p>

<p>"Well, they won't. It takes the sort of man you are to strike
classical attitudes. And, absurd as the paradox appears&mdash;and even
taking into consideration your notorious indifference to your
wife and your rather silly reputation as a débutante chaser &mdash;I
do believe, Dysart, that, deep inside of you somewhere, there
is enough latent decency to have inspired this resentment toward
me&mdash;a resentment perfectly natural in any man who acts squarely
toward his wife&mdash;but rather far fetched in your case."</p>

<p>Dysart, pallid, menacing, laid his hand on a chair.</p>

<p>The other laughed.</p>

<p>"As bad as that?" he asked contemptuously. "Don't do it, Dysart;
it isn't in your line. You're only a good-looking, popular, dancing
man; all your deviltry is in your legs, and I'd be obliged if
they'd presently waft you out of my room."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Dysart unsteadily, "that you would make yourself
noisily ridiculous if I knocked your blackguard head off."</p>

<p>"It's only in novels that people are knocked down successfully
and artistically," admitted the other. "In everyday life they
resent it. Yes&mdash;if you do anything hysterical there will be some
sort of a disgraceful noise, I suppose. It's shoot or suit in
these unromantic days, Dysart, otherwise the newspapers laugh
at you."</p>

<p>Dysart's well-shaped fists relaxed, the chair dropped, but even
when he let it go murder danced in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "it's shoot or a suit in these days; you're perfectly
right, Mallett. And we'll let it go at that for the present."</p>

<p>He stood a moment, straight, handsome, his clearly stencilled
eyebrows knitted, watching Duane. Whatever in the man's face and
figure was usually colourless, unaccented, irresolute, disappeared
as he glared rigidly at the other.</p>

<p>For there is no resentment like the resentment of the neglectful,
no jealousy like the jealousy of the faithless.</p>

<p>"To resume, in plain English," he said, "keep away from my wife,
Mallett. You comprehend that, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly. Now get out!"</p>

<p>Dysart hesitated for the fraction of a second longer, as though
perhaps expecting further reply, then turned on his heel and walked
out.</p>

<p>Later, while Duane was examining his own costume preparatory
to trying it on, Scott Seagrave's spectacled and freckled visage
protruded into the room. He knocked as an after-thought.</p>

<p>"Rosalie sent me. She's dressed in all her gimcracks and wants
your expert opinion. I've got to go&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"In her room. I'm going out to the hatchery with Kathleen&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Come and see Rosalie with me, first," said Duane, passing his
arm through Scott's and steering him down the sunny corridor.</p>

<p>When they knocked, Mrs. Dysart admitted them, revealing herself
in full costume, painted and powdered, the blinds pulled down,
and the electric lights burning behind their rosy shades.</p>

<p>"It's my final dress rehearsal," she explained. "Mr. Mallett,
<em>is</em> my hair sufficiently à la Lamballe to suit you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. You're a perfect little porcelain figurette! There's
not an anachronism in you or your make-up. How did you do it?"</p>

<p>"I merely stuck like grim death to your sketches," she said demurely.</p>

<p>Scott eyed her without particular interest. "Very corking," he
said vaguely, "but I've got to go down to the hatchery with Kathleen,
so you won't mind if I leave&#11834;"</p>

<p>He closed the door behind him before anybody could speak. Duane
moved toward the door.</p>

<p>"It's a charming costume," he said, "and most charmingly worn;
your hair is exactly right&mdash;not too much powder, you know&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Where shall I put my patch? Here?"</p>

<p>"Higher."</p>

<p>"Here?"</p>

<p>He came back to the centre of the room where she stood.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, indenting the firm, cool ivory skin with one
finger, "and here. Wear two."</p>

<p>"And my rings&mdash;do you think that my fingers are overloaded?"
She held out her fascinating smooth little hands. He supported
them on his upturned palms and examined the gems critically.</p>

<p>They talked for a few moments about the rings, then: "Thank you
so much," she said, with a carelessly friendly pressure. "How
about my shoes? Are the buckles of the period?"</p>

<p>One of her hands encountered his at hazard, lingered, dropped,
the fingers still linked lightly in his. She bent over, knees
straight, and lifted the hem of her petticoat, displaying her
Louis <em>XVI </em>footwear.</p>

<p>"Shoes and buckles are all right," he said; "faultless, true
to the period&mdash;very fascinating.... I've got to go&mdash;one or two
things to do&#11834;"</p>

<p>They examined the shoes for some time in silence; still bending
over she turned her dainty head and looked around and up at him.
There was a moment's pause, then he kissed her.</p>

<p>"I was afraid you'd do that&mdash;some day," she said, straightening
up and stepping back one pace, so that their linked hands now
hung pendant between them.</p>

<p>"I was sure of it, too," he said. "Now I think I'd better go&mdash;as
all things are en règle, even the kiss, which was classical&mdash;pure
&mdash;Louis <em>XVI.... </em>Besides, Scott was idiot enough
to shut the door. That's Louis <em>XVI, </em>too, but too much
realism is never artistic."</p>

<p>"We could open the door again&mdash;if that's why you're running away
from me."</p>

<p>"What's the use?"</p>

<p>She glanced at the door and then calmly seated herself.</p>

<p>"Do you think that we are together too much?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Hasn't your husband made similar observations?" he replied,
laughing.</p>

<p>"It isn't for him to make them."</p>

<p>"Hasn't he objected?"</p>

<p>"He has suddenly and unaccountably become disagreeable enough
to make me wish he had some real grounds for his excitement!"
she said coolly, and closed her teeth with a little click. She
added, between them: "I'm inclined to give him something real
to howl about."</p>

<p>He said: "You're adrift. Do you know it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I know it. Are you prepared to offer salvage? I'm
past the need of a pilot."</p>

<p>He smiled. "You haven't drifted very far yet&mdash;only as far as
Mallett Harbour. That's usually the first port&mdash;for derelicts.
Anchors are dropped rather frequently there&mdash;but, Rosalie, there's
no safe mooring except in the home port."</p>

<p>Her pretty, flushed face grew very serious as she looked up questioningly.</p>

<p>"Isn't there an anchorage near you, Duane? Are you quite sure?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, dear, I'm not sure. But let me tell you something:
it isn't in me to love again. And that isn't square to you."</p>

<p>After a silence she repeated: "Again? Have you been in love?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Are you embittered? I thought only callow fledglings moped."</p>

<p>"If I were embittered I'd offer free anchorage to all comers.
That's the fledgling idea&mdash;when blighted&mdash;be a 'deevil among the
weemin,'" he said, laughing.</p>

<p>"You have that hospitable reputation now," she persisted, unsmiling.</p>

<p>"Have I? Judge for yourself then&mdash;because no woman I ever knew
cares anything for me now."</p>

<p>"You mean that if any of them had anything intimate to remember
they'd never remain indifferent?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"They'd either hate you or remember you with a certain tenderness."</p>

<p>"Is that what happens?" he asked, amused.</p>

<p>"I think so," she said thoughtfully.... "As for what you said,
you are right, Duane; I am adrift.... You&mdash;or a man like you could
easily board me&mdash;take me in tow. I'm quite sure that something
about me signals a pilot; and that keen eyes and bitter tongues
have noted it. And I don't care. Nor do I know yet what my capabilities
for evil are.... Do you care to&mdash;find out?"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be a square deal to you, Rosalie."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;if I don't care whether it's a square deal or not?"</p>

<p>"Why, dear," he said, covering her nervous, pretty hand with
both of his, "I'd break your heart in a week."</p>

<p>He laughed, dropped her fingers, stepped back to the door, and,
laying his hand on the knob, said evenly:</p>

<p>"That husband of yours is not the sort of man I particularly
take to, but I believe he's about the average if you'd care to
make him so."</p>

<p>She coloured with surprise. Then something in her scornful eyes
inspired him with sudden intuition.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," he said lightly, "you care for him still."</p>

<p>"I can very easily prove the contrary," she said, walking slowly
up to him, close, closer, until the slight tremor of contact halted
her and her soft, irregular breath touched his face.</p>

<p>"What a girl like you needs," he laughed, taking her into his
arms, "is a man to hold her this way&mdash;every now and then, and"&mdash;he
kissed her&mdash;"tell her she is incomparable&mdash;which I cannot truthfully
tell you, dear." He released her at arms' length.</p>

<p>"I don't know whose fault it is," he went on: "I don't know whether
he still really cares for you in spite of his weak peregrinations
to other shrines; but you still care for him. And it's up to you
to make him what he can be&mdash;the average husband. There are only
two kinds, Rosalie, the average and the bad."</p>

<p>She looked straight into his eyes, but the deep, mantling colour
belied her audacity.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she said, "that we haven't&mdash;lived together for
two years?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to know such things," he said gently.</p>

<p>"Well, you do know now. <em>I&mdash;</em>am&mdash;very much alone. You
see I have already become capable of saying anything&mdash;and of doing
it, too."</p>

<p>There came a reckless glimmer into her eyes; she set her teeth&mdash;a
trick of hers; the fresh lips parted slightly under her rapid
breathing.</p>

<p>"Do you think," she said unevenly, "that I'm going on all my
life like this&mdash;without anything more than the passing friendship
of men to balance the example he sets me?"</p>

<p>"No, I think something is bound to happen, Rosalie. May I suggest
what ought to happen?"</p>

<p>She nodded thoughtfully; only the quiver of her lower lip betrayed
the tension of self-control.</p>

<p>"Take him back," he said.</p>

<p>"I no longer care for him."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken."</p>

<p>After a moment she said: "I don't think so; truly I don't. All
consideration for him has died in me. His conduct doesn't matter&mdash;doesn't
hurt me any more&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, it does. He's just a plain ass&mdash;an average ass&mdash;ownerless,
and, like all asses, convinced that he can take care of himself.
Go and put the halter on him again."</p>

<p>"Go&mdash;and&mdash;what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Tether him. You did once. It's up to you; it's usually up to
a woman when a man wanders untethered. What one woman, or a dozen,
can do with a man his wife can do in the same fashion! What won
him in the beginning always holds good until he thinks he has
won you. Then the average man flourishes his heels. He is doing
it. What won him was not you alone, or love, alone; it was his
uncertainty of both that fascinated him. That's what charms him
in others; uncertainty. Many men are that way. It's a sporting
streak in us. If you care for him now&mdash;if you could ever care
for him, take him as you took him first.... Do you want him again?"</p>

<p>She stood leaning against the door, looking down. Much of her
colour had died out.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said.</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;<em>do</em> I?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You think so? Why?"</p>

<p>"Because he's adrift, too. And he's rather weak, rather handsome,
easily influenced&mdash;unjust, selfish, vain, wayward&mdash;just the average
husband. And every wife ought to be able to manage these lords
of creation, and keep them out of harm.... And keep them in love,
Rosalie. And the way to do it is the way you did it first....
Try it." He kissed her gaily, thinking he owed that much to himself.</p>

<p>And through the door which had swung gently ajar, Geraldine Seagrave
saw them, and Rosalie saw her.</p>

<p>For a moment the girl halted, pale and rigid, and her heart seemed
to cease its beating; then, as she passed with averted head, Rosalie
caught Duane's wrists in her jewelled grasp and released herself
with a wrench.</p>

<p>"You've given me enough to think over," she said. "If you want
me to love you, stay&mdash;and close that door&mdash;and we'll see what
happens. If you don't&mdash;you had better go at once, Duane. And leave
my door open&mdash;to see what else fate will send me." She clasped
her hands behind her back, laughing nervously.</p>

<p>"It's like the old child's game&mdash;'open your mouth and close your
eyes and see what God will send you?'&mdash;usually something not at
all resembling the awaited bonbon.... Good-bye, my altruistic
friend&mdash;and thank you for your XXth Century advice, and your Louis
<em>XVI </em>assistance."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he returned smilingly, and sauntered back toward
his room where his own untried finery awaited him.</p>

<p>Ahead, far down the corridor, he caught sight of Geraldine, and
called to her, but perhaps she did not hear him for he had to
put on considerable speed to overtake her.</p>

<p>"In these last few days," he said laughingly, "I seldom catch
a glimpse of you except when you are vanishing into doorways or
down corridors."</p>

<p>She said nothing, did not even turn her head or halt; and, keeping
pace with her, he chatted on amiably about nothing in particular
until she stopped abruptly and looked at him.</p>

<p>"I am in a hurry. What is it you want, Duane?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;nothing," he said in surprise.</p>

<p>"That is less than you ask of&mdash;others." And she turned to continue
her way.</p>

<p>"Is there anything wrong, Geraldine?" he asked, detaining her.</p>

<p>"Is there?" she replied, shaking off his hand from her arm.</p>

<p>"Not as far as I'm concerned."</p>

<p>"Can't you even tell the truth?" she asked with a desperate attempt
to laugh.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," he said. "Evidently something has gone all wrong&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Several things, my solicitous friend; I for one, you for another.
Count the rest for yourself."</p>

<p>"What has happened to you, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>"What has always threatened."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me?"</p>

<p>"No, I will not. So don't try to look concerned and interested
in a matter that regards me alone."</p>

<p>"But what is it that has always threatened you?" he insisted
gently, coming nearer&mdash;too near to suit her, for she backed away
toward the high latticed window through which the sun poured over
the geraniums on the sill. There was a seat under it. Suddenly
her knees threatened to give way under her; she swayed slightly
as she seated herself; a wave of angry pain swept through her
setting lids and lips trembling.</p>

<p>"Now I want you to tell me what it is that you believe has always
threatened you."</p>

<p>"Do you think I'd tell you?" she managed to say. Then her self-possession
returned in a flash of exasperation, but she controlled that,
too, and laughed defiantly, confronting him with pretty, insolent
face uptilted.</p>

<p>"What do you want to know about me? That I'm in the way of being
ultimately damned like all the rest of you?" she said. "Well,
I am. I'm taking chances. Some people take their chances in one
way&mdash;like you and Rosalie; some take them in another&mdash;as I do....
Once I was afraid to take any; now I'm not. Who was it said that
self-control is only immorality afraid?"</p>

<p>"Will you tell me what is worrying you?" he persisted.</p>

<p>"No, but I'll tell you what annoys me if you like."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Fear of notoriety."</p>

<p>"Notoriety?"</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;not for myself&mdash;for my house."</p>

<p>"Is anybody likely to make it notorious?" he demanded, colouring
up.</p>

<p>"Ask yourself.... I haven't the slightest interest in your personal
conduct"&mdash;there was a catch in her voice&mdash;"except when it threatens
to besmirch my own home."</p>

<p>The painful colour gathered and settled under his cheek-bones.</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to leave?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. But you can't without others knowing how and why."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I can&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You are mistaken. I tell you <em>others</em> will know. Some
do know already. And I don't propose to figure with a flaming
sword. Kindly remain in your Eden until it's time to leave&mdash;with
Eve."</p>

<p>"Just as you wish," he said, smiling; and that infuriated her.</p>

<p>"It ought to be as I wish! That much is due me, I think. Have
you anything further to ask, or is your curiosity satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. You say that you think something threatens you? What
is it?"</p>

<p>"Not what threatens <em>you</em>," she said in contempt.</p>

<p>"That is no answer."</p>

<p>"It is enough for you to know."</p>

<p>He looked her hard in the eyes. "Perhaps," he said in a low voice,
"I know more about you than you imagine I do, Geraldine&mdash;<em>since
last April</em>."</p>

<p>She felt the blood leave her face, the tension crisping her muscles;
she sat up very straight and slender among the cushions and defied
him.</p>

<p>"What do you&mdash;think you know?" she tried to sneer, but her voice
shook and failed.</p>

<p>He said: "I'll tell you. For one thing, you're playing fast and
loose with Dysart. He's a safe enough proposition&mdash;but what is
that sort of thing going to arouse in you?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Her voice cleared with an immense relief.
He noted it.</p>

<p>"It's making you tolerant," he said quietly, "familiar with subtleties,
contemptuous of standards. It's rubbing the bloom off you. You
let a man who is married come too close to you&mdash;you betray enough
curiosity concerning him to do it. A drifting woman does that
sort of thing, but why do you cut your cables? Good Lord, Geraldine,
it's a fool business&mdash;permitting a man an intimacy&#11834;"</p>

<p>"More harmless than his wife permits you!" she retorted.</p>

<p>"That is not true."</p>

<p>"You are supposed to lie about such things, aren't you?" she
said, reddening to the temples. "Oh, I am learning your rotten
code, you see&mdash;the code of all these amiable people about me.
You've done your part to instruct me that promiscuous caresses
are men's distraction from ennui; Rosalie evidently is in sympathy
with that form of amusement&mdash;many men and women among whom I live
in town seem to be quite as casual as you are.... I did have standards
once, scarcely knowing what they meant; I clung to them out of
instinct. And when I went out into the world I found nobody paying
any attention to them."</p>

<p>"You are wrong."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not. I go among people and see every standard I set
up, ignored. I go to the theatre and see plays that embody everything
I supposed was unthinkable, let alone unutterable. But the actors
utter everything, and the audience thinks everything&mdash;and sometimes
laughs. I can't do that&mdash;yet. But I'm progressing."</p>

<p>"Geraldine&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Wait!... My friends have taught me a great deal during this
last year&mdash;by word, precept, and example. Things I held in horror
nobody notices enough to condone. Take treachery, for example.
The marital variety is all around me. Who cares, or is even curious
after an hour's gossip has made it stale news? A divorce here,
a divorce there&mdash;some slight curiosity to see who the victims
may marry next time&mdash;that curiosity satisfied&mdash;and so is everybody.
And they go back to their business of money-getting and money-spending&mdash;and
that's what my friends have taught me. Can you wonder that my
familiarity with it all breeds contempt enough to seek almost
any amusement in sheer desperation&mdash;as you do?"</p>

<p>"I have only one amusement," he said.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Painting."</p>

<p>"And your model," she nodded with a short laugh. "Don't forget
her. Your pretences are becoming tiresome, Duane. Your pretty
model, Mrs. Dysart, poses less than you do."</p>

<p>Another wave of heart-sickness and anger swept over her; she
felt the tears burning close to her lids and turned sharply on
him:</p>

<p>"It's all rotten, I tell you&mdash;the whole personnel and routine&mdash;these
people, and their petty vices and their idleness and their money!
I &mdash;I do want to keep myself above it&mdash;clean of it&mdash;but what
am I to do? One can't live without friends. If I don't gamble
I'm left alone; if I don't flirt I'm isolated. If one stands aloof
from everything one's friends go elsewhere. What can I do?"</p>

<p>"Make decent friends. I'm going to."</p>

<p>He bent forward and struck his knee with his closed fist.</p>

<p>"I'm going to," he repeated. "I've waited as long as I can for
you to stand by me. I could have even remained among these harmless
simians if you had cared for me. You're all the friend I need.
But you've become one of them. It isn't in you to take an intelligent
interest in me, or in what I care for. I've stood this sort of
existence long enough. Now I'm all through with it."</p>

<p>She stared. Anger, astonishment, exasperation moved her in turn.
Bitterness unlocked her lips.</p>

<p>"Are you expecting to take Mrs. Dysart with you to your intellectual
solitude?"</p>

<p>"I would if <em>I&mdash;</em>if we cared for each other," he said,
calmly seating himself.</p>

<p>She said, revolted: "Can't you even admit that you are in love
with her? Must I confess that I could not avoid seeing you with
her in her own room&mdash;half an hour since? Will <em>that</em> wring
the truth out of you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, is that what you mean?" he said wearily. "I believe the
door was open.... Well, Geraldine, whatever you saw won't harm
anybody. So come to your own conclusions.... But I wish you were
out of all this&mdash;with your fine insight and your clear intelligence,
and your sweetness&mdash;oh, the chances for happiness you and I might
have had!"</p>

<p>"A slim chance with you!" she said.</p>

<p>"Every chance; perhaps the only chance we'll ever have. And we've
missed it."</p>

<p>"We've missed nothing"&mdash;a sudden and curious tremor set her heart
and pulses beating heavily&mdash;"I tell you, Duane, it doesn't matter
whom people of our sort marry because we'll always sicken of our
bargain. What chance for happiness would I run with such a man
as you? Or you with a girl like me?"</p>

<p>She lay back among the cushions, with a tired little laugh. "We
are like the others of our rotten sort, only less aged, less experienced.
But we have, each of us, our own heritage, our own secret depravity."
She hesitated, reddening, caught his eye, stammered her sentence
to a finish and flinched, crimsoning to the roots of her hair.</p>

<p>He stood up, paced the room for a few moments, came and stood
beside her.</p>

<p>"Once," he said very low, "you admitted that you dare go anywhere
with me. Do you remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Those are your rooms, I believe," pointing to a closed door
far down the south corridor.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Take me there now."</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>cannot do that&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, you can. You must."</p>

<p>"Now? &mdash;Duane."</p>

<p>"Yes, now&mdash;<em>now</em>! I tell you our time is now if it ever
is to be at all. Don't waste words."</p>

<p>"What do you want to say to me that cannot be said here?" she
asked in consternation.</p>

<p>He made no answer, but she found herself on her feet and moving
slowly along beside him, his hand just touching her arm as guide.</p>

<p>"What is it, Duane?" she asked fearfully, as she laid her hand
on the knob and turned to look at his altered face.</p>

<p>He made no answer. She hesitated, shivered, opened the door,
hesitated again, slowly crossed the threshold, turned and admitted
him.</p>

<p>The western sun flooded the silent chamber of rose and gray;
a breeze moved the curtains, noiselessly; the scent of flowers
freshened the silence.</p>

<p>There was a divan piled with silken cushions; he placed several
for her; she stood irresolute for a moment, then, with a swift,
unquiet side glance at him, seated herself.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked, looking up, her face beginning to reflect
the grave concern in his.</p>

<p>"I want you to marry me, Geraldine."</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is <em>that</em> what&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Partly. I want you to love me, too. But I'll attend to that
if you'll marry me&mdash;I'll guarantee that. I &mdash;I will guarantee&mdash;more
than that."</p>

<p>She was still looking up, searching his sombre face. She saw
the muscles tighten along the jaw; saw the grave lines deepening.
A sort of bewildered fear possessed her.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>am not in love with you, Duane." She added hastily,
"I don't trust you either. How could I&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, you do trust me."</p>

<p>"After what you have done to Rosalie&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You know that all is square there. Say so!"</p>

<p>She gazed at the floor, convinced, but not answering.</p>

<p>"Do you believe I love you?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, eyes still on the floor.</p>

<p>"Tell me the truth! Look at me!"</p>

<p>She said with an effort: "You think you care for me.... You believe
you do, I suppose&#11834;"</p>

<p>"And <em>you</em> believe it, too! Give me my chance&mdash;take your
own!"</p>

<p>"<em>My</em> chance?"&mdash;with a flash of anger.</p>

<p>"Yes; take it, and give me mine. I tell you, Geraldine, we are
going to need each other desperately some day. I need you now&mdash;to-morrow
you'll need me more; and the day after, and after that in perilous
days to follow our need will be the greater for these hours wasted&mdash;can't
you understand by this time that we've nothing to hold us steady
through the sort of life we're born to except&mdash;each other&#11834;"</p>

<p>His voice suddenly broke; he dropped down on the couch beside
her, imprisoning her clasped hands on her knees. His emotion,
the break in his voice, excited them both.</p>

<p>"Are you trying to frighten me and take me by storm?" she demanded,
forcing a smile. "What is the matter, Duane? What do you mean
by peril?... You are scaring me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Little Geraldine&mdash;my little comrade! Can't you understand? It
isn't only my selfish desire for you&mdash;it isn't all for myself!
&mdash;I care more for you than that. I love you more deeply than
a mere lover! Must I say more to you? Must I even hurt you? Must
I tell you what I know&mdash;of you?"</p>

<p>"W-what?" she asked, startled.</p>

<p>He looked at her miserably. In his eyes she read a meaning that
terrified her.</p>

<p>"Duane &mdash;I don't&mdash;understand," she faltered.</p>

<p>"Yes you do. Let's face it now!"</p>

<p>"F-face what?" Her voice was only a whisper.</p>

<p>"I can tell you if you'll love me. Will you?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand," she repeated in white-lipped distress.
"Why do you look at me so strangely? And you tell me that <em>I&mdash;</em>know....
What is it that I know? Couldn't you tell me? I am&mdash;" Her voice
failed.</p>

<p>"Dear&mdash;do you remember&mdash;once&mdash;last April that you were&mdash;ill?...
And awoke to find yourself on your own bed?"</p>

<p>"Duane!" It was a cry of terror.</p>

<p>"Dearest! Dearest! Do you think I have not known&mdash;since then&mdash;what
has troubled you&mdash;here&#11834;"</p>

<p>She stared at him in crimsoned horror for an instant, then with
a dry sob, bowed her head and covered her face with desperate
hands. For a moment her whole body quivered, then she collapsed.
On his knees beside her he bent and touched with trembling lips
her arms, her knees, the slim ankles desperately interlocked,
the tips of her white shoes.</p>

<p>"Dearest," he whispered brokenly, "I know &mdash;I know&mdash;believe
me. I have fought through worse, and won out. You said once that
something had died out in me&mdash;while I was abroad. It did not die
of itself, dear. But it left its mark.... You say self-control
is only depravity afraid.... That is true; but I have made my
depravity fear me. I can do what I please with it now; I can tempt
it, laugh at it, silence it. But it cost me something to make
a slave of it&mdash;what you saw in my face is the claw-mark it left
fighting me to the death."</p>

<p>Very straight on his knees beside her he bent again, pressing
her rigid knees with his lips.</p>

<p>"I need you, Geraldine &mdash;I need all that is best in you;
you must love me&mdash;take me as an ally, dear, against all that is
worst in you. I'll love you so confidently that we'll kill it&mdash;you
and I together&mdash;my strength and yours, my bitter and deep understanding
and your own sweet contempt for weakness wherever it may be, even
in yourself."</p>

<p>He touched her; and she shuddered under the light caress, still
bent almost double, and covering her face with both hands. He
bent over her, one knee on the divan.</p>

<p>"Let's pull ourselves together and talk sense, Geraldine," he
said with an effort at lightness.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember that bully little girl who swung her fists
in single combat and uppercut her brother and me whenever her
sense of fairness was outraged? The time has come when you, who
were so fair to others, are going to be fair to yourself by marrying
me&#11834;"</p>

<p>She dropped both hands and stared at him out of wide, tear-wet
eyes.</p>

<p>"Fair to myself&mdash;at your expense, Duane?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean? I love you."</p>

<p>"Am I to let you&mdash;you marry me&mdash;knowing&mdash;what you know? Is that
what you call my sense of fairness?" And, as he attempted to speak:</p>

<p>"Oh, I have thought about it already! &mdash;I must have been
conscious that this would happen some day&mdash;that&mdash;that I was capable
of caring for you&mdash;and it alarmed me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Are you capable of loving me?"</p>

<p>"Duane, you must not ask me that!"</p>

<p>"Tell me!"</p>

<p>But she pushed him back, and they faced each other, her hands
remaining on his shoulders. She strove piteously to endure his
gaze, flinched, strove to push him from her again&mdash;but the slender
hands lay limply against him. So they remained, her hands at intervals
nervously tightening and relaxing on his shoulders, her tearful
breath coming faster, the dark eyes closing, opening, turning
from him, toward him, searching, now in his soul, now in her own,
her self-command slipping from her.</p>

<p>"It is cowardly in me&mdash;if I do it," she said in the ghost of
a voice.</p>

<p>"Do what?"</p>

<p>"Let you risk&mdash;what I m-might become."</p>

<p>"You little saint!"</p>

<p>"Some saints <em>were</em> depraved at first&mdash;weren't they?"
she said without a smile. "Oh, Duane, Duane, to think I could
ever be here speaking to you about&mdash;about the horror that has
happened to me&mdash;looking into your face and giving up my dreadful
secret to you&mdash;laying my very soul naked before you! How can I
look at you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Because I love you. Now give me the right to your lips and heart!"</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Then she tried to smile.</p>

<p>"My&mdash;my lips? <em>I&mdash;</em>thought you took such things&mdash;lightly&#11834;"</p>

<p>She hesitated, glanced up at him, then began to tremble.</p>

<p>"Duane&mdash;if you are in earnest about our&mdash;about an engagement&mdash;promise
me that I may be released if <em>I&mdash;</em>think best&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I might fail&#11834;"</p>

<p>"The more need of me. But you can't fail&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, but if I should, dear. Will you release me? I cannot &mdash;I
will not engage myself to you&mdash;unless you promise to let me go
if I think it best. You know what my word means. Give it back
to me if matters go wrong with me. Will you?"</p>

<p>"But I am going to marry you now!" he said with a short, excited
laugh.</p>

<p>"Now!" she repeated, appalled.</p>

<p>"Certainly, to make sure of you. We don't need a license in this
State. There's a parson at West Gate Village.... I intend to make
sure of you now. You can keep it a secret if you like. When you
return to town we can have everything en règle&mdash;engagement announced,
cards, church wedding, and all that. Meanwhile I'm going to be
sure of you."</p>

<p>"W-when?"</p>

<p>"This afternoon."</p>

<p>His excitement thrilled her; a vivid colour surged over neck
and brow.</p>

<p>"Duane, I did not dream that you cared so much, so truly&mdash;Oh,
I &mdash;I do love you then! &mdash;I love you, Duane! I love
you!"</p>

<p>He drew her suddenly into his arms, close, closer; she lifted
her face; he kissed her; and she gave him her heart with a sob.</p>

<p>"You will wait for m-me, won't you?" she stammered, striving
to keep her reason through the delicious tumult that swept her
senses. "Before I m-marry you I must be quite certain that you
take no risk&#11834;"</p>

<p>She looked up into his steady eyes; a passion of tenderness overwhelmed
her, and her locked arms tightened around his neck.</p>

<p>"Oh," she whispered, "you <em>are</em> the boy I loved so long,
so long ago&mdash;my comrade Duane&mdash;my own little boy! How was I to
know I loved you this way, too? How could I understand!"</p>

<p>Already the glamour of the past was transfiguring the man for
her, changing him back into the lad she had ruled so long ago,
glorifying him&mdash;drawing them together into that golden age where
her ears already caught the far cries and laughter of the past.</p>

<p>Now, her arms around him, she looked at him and looked at him
as though she had not set eyes on him since then.</p>

<p>"Of course, I love you," she said impatiently, as though surprised
and hurt that he or she had ever doubted it. "You always were
mine; you are <em>mine</em>! Nobody else could ever have had you&mdash;no
matter what you did&mdash;or what I did.... And nobody except you could
ever, ever have had me. That is perfectly plain now.... Oh, you&mdash;you
darling"&mdash;she murmured, drawing his face against hers. Tears sprang
to her brown eyes; her mouth quivered.</p>

<p>"You <em>will</em> love me, won't you? Because I'm going quite
mad about you, Duane.... I don't think I know just what I'm saying&mdash;or
what I'm doing."</p>

<p>She drew him closer; he caught her, crushing her in his arms,
and she yielded, clung to him for a moment, drew back in flushed
resistance, still bewildered by her own passion. Then, into her
eyes came that divine beauty which comes but once on earth&mdash;innocence
awakened; and the white lids drooped a little, and the mouth quivered,
surrendering with a sigh.</p>

<p>"You never have, never could love any other man? Say it. I know
it, but&mdash;say it, sweetheart!"</p>

<p>"Only you, Duane."</p>

<p>"Are you happy?"</p>

<p>"I am in heaven."</p>

<p>She closed her eyes&mdash;opening them almost immediately and passing
one hand across his face as though afraid he might have vanished.</p>

<p>"You are there yet," she murmured with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"So are you," he whispered, laughing&mdash;"my little dream girl&mdash;my
little brown-eyed, brown-haired, long-legged, swift-running, hard-hitting&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>do</em> you remember that dreadful blow I gave you when
we were sparring in the library? <em>Did</em> it hurt you, my
darling &mdash;I was sure it did, but you never would admit it.
Tell me now," she coaxed, adorable in her penitence.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes, it did." He laughed under his breath&mdash;"I don't mind
telling you now that it fractured the bridge of my nose."</p>

<p>"What!"&mdash;in horror. "That perfectly delicious straight nose of
yours!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I had it fixed," he said, laughing. "If you deal me no more
vital blows than that I'll never mind&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>deal you a&mdash;a blow, Duane! <em>I</em>!"</p>

<p>"For instance, by not marrying me right away&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Dear &mdash;I can't."</p>

<p>The smile had died out in her eyes and on her lips.</p>

<p>"You know I can't, don't you?" she said tenderly. "You know I've
got to be fair to you." Her face grew graver. "Dear&mdash;when I stop
and try to think&mdash;it dismays me to understand how much in love
with you I am.... Because it is too soon.... It would be safer
to wait before I start to love you&mdash;this way. There is a cowardly
streak in me&mdash;a weak streak&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What blessed nonsense you do talk, don't you?"</p>

<p>"No, dear."</p>

<p>She moved slightly toward him, settling close, as though within
the circle of his arms lay some occult protection.</p>

<p>For a while she lay very close to him, her pale face pressed
against his shoulder, brown eyes remote. Neither spoke. After
a long time she laid her hands on his arms, gently disengaging
them, and, freeing herself, sprang to her feet. A new, lithe and
lovely dignity seemed to possess her&mdash;an exquisite, graceful,
indefinable something which lent a hint of splendour to her as
she turned and looked down at him.</p>

<p>Then, mischievously tender, she stooped and touched her childish
mouth to his&mdash;her cheek, her throat, her hair, her lids, her hands,
in turn all brushed his lips with fragrance&mdash;the very ghost of
contact, the exquisite mockery of caress.</p>

<p>"If you don't go at once," she murmured, "I'll never let you
go at all. Wait&mdash;let me see if anybody is in the corridor&#11834;"</p>

<p>She opened the door and looked out.</p>

<p>"Not a soul," she whispered, "our reputations are still intact.
Good-bye &mdash;I'll put on a fresh gown and meet you in ten minutes!...
Where? Oh, anywhere&mdash;<em>anywhere</em>, Duane. The Lake. Oh, that
is too far away! Wait here on the stairs for me&mdash;that isn't so
far away&mdash;just sit on the stairs until I come. Do you promise?
<em>Truly</em>? Oh, you angel boy!... Yes&mdash;but only one more,
then&mdash;to be quite sure that you won't forget to wait on the stairs
for me...."</p>
