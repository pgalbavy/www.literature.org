<p>Wearied and exhausted, Graham crawled forth from the water, and
lay down a while to rest himself upon the soft, velvety carpet
of grass. Here, overcome by the terrific strain which his system
had undergone, he fell into a deep and lasting sleep. When he
awoke, the day had far advanced, and the sun was already past
the meridian. After fully awakening, and fervently thanking Heaven
for his remarkable preservation and escape, he commenced debating
with himself upon the best course for him to pursue. He was now
alone in the great wilderness, and what step should he next take?
Should he endeavor to hunt up his friend Haverland, or should
he press on in the pursuit of the object which had led him thus
far?</p>

<p>While these questions were yet unanswered, he mechanically cast
his eye up the river, and started as he saw a small canoe coming
round a bend quite a distance from him. He had just time to see
that there were two beings in it, when prudence warned him to
make himself invisible. He stepped behind the trunk of a massive
king of the forest, and watched with eager interest the approach
of the new-comers. The light canoe shot rapidly over the placid
surface of the river, and in a few moments was abreast of him.
He saw that the two occupants were white men, and he scanned their
countenances with deep interest. The stronger of the two was seated
in the center of the light vessel, and dipped the ashen blades
deep into the water at every stroke. The other, seemingly an elder
man, was seated in the stern, and while he controlled the actions
of the other, scanned either shore with the experienced eye of
the frontiersman. Graham believed, though he knew he had been
careful, that his presence was suspected, as the canoe, apparently
without any intent of its occupants, sheered off toward the opposite
shore. He remained concealed until it was directly abreast of
him, when a sudden suspicion flashed over him that one of the
men was Haverland, although it was so long since he had seen him
that it was impossible to satisfy himself upon that point without
a closer view. However, they were white men, and he determined
to risk the probabilities of their being friends. In a subdued
voice, without coming into view himself, he called to them. He
knew he was heard, for the man at the oars halted a second, and
glanced furtively toward the shore; but at a slight sign from
the other, he again bent to them, and they both continued, as
though they suspected no danger.</p>

<p>"Hallo, my friends!" called he, in a louder tone, but still concealing
himself. There was no notice, however, taken of him, save he fancied
a quicker propulsion of the boat forward. He now stepped boldly
forth and called,</p>

<p>"Do not be suspicious; I am a friend."</p>

<p>This brought them to a pause, while the one in the stern spoke.</p>

<p>"We are not satisfied of that; for what business have you here?"</p>

<p>"I might with equal justice put that question to you."</p>

<p>"If you choose to give no answer, we can not wait to bandy words
with you. Go ahead, Haverland."</p>

<p>"Hold! is that Alfred Haverland with you?"</p>

<p>"Suppose it is? What is that to you?"</p>

<p>"He is the man whom, above all others, I wish to see. I am Everard
Graham; and perhaps he remembers the name."</p>

<p>The woodman now turned toward the shore with a stare of wonder.
A minute sufficed.</p>

<p>"It’s he, Ned, sure enough."</p>

<p>With these words he turned the canoe toward shore. A few strokes
sent it up against the bank, and he sprang out and grasped the
hand of his young friend.</p>

<p>"Why, Graham, what in the name of the seven wonders has brought
you here? I forgot, you <em>did</em> promise me a visit somewhere
about this time, but so many other things have transpired, as
to make it slip my mind altogether. And I can assure you, I have
had enough to break the heart of any ordinary mortal," he added,
in a choking voice.</p>

<p>Explanations were then given; and the wonder, gratitude, and
apprehension, that followed Graham’s story, may be imagined. Before
these were given, Haverland introduced his companion, Ned Haldidge.</p>

<p>"Seth promised to bring Ina back," said he, "but I could not
bear to remain idle while he alone was searching for her. This
good friend, here, who has had much experience in the border warfare,
willingly joined me. I suppose you would like to see the mother;
but if you did, you would see a well-nigh broken-hearted one,
and I can not bear to meet her until I have learned more of our
darling daughter."</p>

<p>"And if them cowardly Mohawks don’t rue the day they commenced
their infernal work, then Ned Haldidge is mightily mistaken!"
exclaimed that individual, warmly.</p>

<p>"I don’t know," smiled Graham, "but that with our present number
and present feelings, we might make an open attack upon them,
especially as we have a friend in the camp."</p>

<p>"No, sir; that’ll never do!" replied the hunter, with a shake
of the head. "They can never be overcome in that way. We could
have brought a dozen men with us who could have blown the cowards
to atoms, but ’twouldn’t do."</p>

<p>"You then rely wholly upon stratagem, eh?"</p>

<p>"Nothing else will do with <em>them</em> critters."</p>

<p>"And heaven only knows whether that will," remarked Haverland,
in a desponding tone.</p>

<p>"Ah! don’t give way, Alf, wait till it’s time."</p>

<p>"You must pardon my exhibition of weakness," said he, recovering
himself. "Though I feel the strength of an army in these limbs
of mine, yet I have the heart of a <em>father</em> in this bosom,
and I can do any thing for the recovery of my darling daughter.
Oh! I can hear her screams yet, as she was torn from us on that
night."</p>

<p>Graham and Haldidge remained silent, respecting his deep and
moving grief. Soon the father spoke again, and this time his voice
and manner were changed.</p>

<p>"But why stand we here idle? Is there nothing for us to do? Are
we to remain desponding, when a single effort may save her?"</p>

<p>"That’s just what I’ve been thinking ever since we stopped here,"
replied Haldidge. "I don’t see any use in waiting, especially
when there <em>is</em> use in doing something."</p>

<p>"Let us depart, then. You will accompany us, of course, Graham?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; but I should like to inquire your intentions?" asked
he, pausing on the bank a moment, as the others seated themselves.</p>

<p>"I should think you would remember we can have but one intention,"
answered Haverland, in a tone of slight rebuke.</p>

<p>"That is not exactly what I meant. Of course, I knew your ultimate
intention, but I wished to inquire what course you intended to
pursue."</p>

<p>"Oh, that’s it!" replied Haldidge. "I’ve been considerable among
the redskins of this region, and know that they can be soonest
reached by going down the river some distance further&mdash;several
miles below this bend&mdash;and taking the land."</p>

<p>"But my experience tells me you are mistaken this time. Ina’s
captors are now at no great distance, and the shortest course
to them, you will find, is in a direct line from here, across
the open prairie, the other side the river."</p>

<p>"At any rate, we will cross to the opposite bank; so step in."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. What does that mean?"</p>

<p>As Graham spoke, he pointed quickly up the river. From the position
of the two within the boat, they could discern nothing.</p>

<p>"Jump ashore, quick, and pull the boat out of sight. There’s
something a-foot, and you musn’t be seen," exclaimed Graham excitedly,
in an undertone, as he stooped and grasped the prow of the canoe.
The men sprang ashore, and in an instant the vessel was hauled
up out of sight, while the three made themselves invisible, and
from their hiding-places eagerly watched the river.</p>

<p>The object which had arrested the attention of Graham, was a
second canoe, which was just making its appearance round the bend
above, which had first brought his friends to view. This latter
one was of about the same size, and could be seen to hold either
three or four persons. The dark-tufted heads of the occupants,
rising like statues in the boat, showed unmistakably that they
were Indians.</p>

<p>As it came nearer and nearer, Haldidge whispered there was a
fourth person in the stern, <em>and she was a female</em>! Haverland
and Graham breathed hard, for a wild hope filled the heart of
each, but as the canoe came abreast of them, while they could
plainly distinguish the features of the three savages, they could
not gain a glimpse of the fourth person. She was covered by an
Indian shawl, and her head was bowed low upon her bosom, as though
in deep and painful thought.</p>

<p>"Let us fire and send these three dogs to eternity," whispered
Graham.</p>

<p>Haldidge raised his hand.</p>

<p>"’Twon’t do, there may be others about, and if that other one
is Ina, it may only be the means of her destruction. Alf, do you
think that is her?"</p>

<p>"I can’t tell&mdash;yes, by heaven, ’tis her! Look! she has moved
her shawl. Let us rescue her at once!" exclaimed the father, rising,
and about to start.</p>

<p>"Hold!" imperatively and half angrily commanded Haldidge, "you
will spoil all by your rashness. Don’t you see it is near night?
They are now below us, and we can not get them in such a range
as to insure us each of them. Wait till it is darker, and we will
pursue them. I have a plan which I think can not fail. Just restrain
yourself a short time, and I will bring things about in a manner
that will surprise them as much as it will you."</p>

<p>Haverland sank down again beside the others. The night was now
fast coming on, and in a few minutes the light, birch canoe was
shoved noiselessly into the water, and the three made ready for
the race of life and death.</p>
