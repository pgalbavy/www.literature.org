<p>MASTER MEADOW MOUSE peeped out of the end of his tunnel and gave a faint
squeak. As he watched, he saw Peter Mink's head, on its long neck, flash
out from beneath the overhanging bank of the brook.
</p>
<p>"What are you doing up there?" Master Meadow Mouse called.
</p><p>"Fishing!" said Peter Mink promptly.
</p><p>"Aren't you a long way from the water?" Master Meadow Mouse inquired.
</p><p>"With a pole, one doesn't need to stand right at the water's edge," said
Peter Mink.
</p><p>"But you haven't a pole," Master Meadow Mouse pointed out. "At least, I
can't see that you have one."
</p><p>Peter was greatly surprised--or seemed to be.
</p><p>"I declare!" he said. "I forgot to bring my pole with me. And if you
hadn't reminded me of it I shouldn't have known what was the trouble. I
was wondering why I didn't get any bites." As he spoke he slid down the
lower part of the bank and stretched himself like a cat. But all the
time he was looking at Master Meadow Mouse out of the corner of his eye.
"What are <u>you</u> doing here?" Peter Mink asked pleasantly.
</p><p>"I came to take a swim," Master Meadow Mouse explained.
</p><p>"Have you had it?"
</p><p>"Not yet!" Master Meadow Mouse told him. "And I believe I'll wait till
to-morrow."
</p><p>"The water's fine to-day," said Peter Mink. "I've been in and out of it
forty times."
</p><p>But Master Meadow Mouse wasn't to be persuaded so easily.
</p><p>"I might spoil your fishing if I went in now," he remarked.
</p><p>"I don't care if you do," said Peter Mink. "The pleasure of seeing you
enjoy a swim would more than repay me for the loss of the biggest fish
in this brook."
</p><p>Now, such speeches sounded very strange, coming from the mouth of a
surly rascal like Peter Mink, who was never known to do anybody a good
turn. Master Meadow Mouse pondered over this last statement. There
seemed to be a catch in it somewhere. And he decided, finally, that he
had discovered it.
</p><p>"I didn't know there were any fish in this brook worth catching," he
piped. "They say there were trout here once. But now there's nothing
bigger than a minnow."
</p><p>Peter Mink nodded. "That's the truth," he said. "If this brook has a
fish that's as meaty as you are, I've never seen him."
</p><p>"Ah!" cried Master Meadow Mouse. "You'd far rather catch me than catch a
fish in this pool."
</p><p>Peter Mink grinned at him brazenly.
</p><p>"I won't deny it," he replied.
</p><p>"But you tried to deceive me," Master Meadow Mouse told him. "You
said--when I asked you what you were doing here--you said that you were
fishing."
</p><p>"So I was!" Peter Mink exclaimed with a horrid chuckle. "I was fishing
for mice. And if you'd been a little less careful I'd have caught one,
too."
</p><p>"Good day!" said Master Meadow Mouse. "Good day and good-by!"
</p><p>"Don't say good-by!" Peter Mink corrected. "Say, 'Till we meet again!'"
</p><p>But Master Meadow Mouse had already pulled his head out of sight and
vanished inside his tunnel.
