<p>Three Indians walked leisurely down to the shore of the river,
as though in quest of nothing particular, and stood gesticulating
as they generally do with their whole arms. They were about two
hundred yards above the point where Tim O'Rooney landed, but their
position was such that the canoe might have rested on the surface
of the water without being seen. Sensible of their danger, the
boys at first sight of them withdrew into cover, from which they
cautiously peered out and watched their movements.</p>

<p>"Those must be the three who fired the guns," whispered Elwood.</p>

<p>"Very probably they are; that looks more encouraging, for I do
not see Tim among them."</p>

<p>"Maybe they have slain him and are talking as to where he came
from."</p>

<p>"Heaven! I hope not."</p>

<p>"So do I; but it looks reasonable that they have made away with
him and are now looking for us."</p>

<p>"How did they know he had any friends with him? Then, too, if
they had slain him, would they not have followed his trail straight
down to the water?"</p>

<p>"I didn't think of that. <em>That</em> question makes me more
hopeful than anything else. It does now look somewhat cheering.
But what are they after?"</p>

<p>The Indians were still talking in an excited manner, and more
than once pointed across the river to the island as if there were
something there which claimed their attention. It might be the
boys themselves, or they may have known that one of their race
lay there in dire extremity; but whatever the cause was it boded
no good to the two boys, who were crouching in the bushes and
grass and furtively watching their motions.</p>

<p>The latter were still gazing at them when their hearts were thrilled
by the sight of Tim O'Rooney. The eyes of Elwood chanced to be
fixed upon a small open space, a rod or two from where the canoe
lay, when he saw the Irishman come cautiously into view, and then
pause and look around him. He had an animal slung over his shoulders,
whose weight was sufficient to make him stop and travel with some
difficulty. They saw him turn his head and carefully scrutinize
every suspicious point that was visible, and then he walked slowly
toward the spot where the canoe was concealed. Whether his low
stoop was caused by the weight of his game, or whether it was
a precautionary measure on his part, was difficult to decide.
The boys at once became painfully excited and alarmed.</p>

<p>"They will see him! they will see him!" said Elwood, "and it
will be all over with us. What a pity! when he has got along so
well!"</p>

<p>"Can we not warn him in some manner? The Indians do not know
how near he is, nor does he know how close they are."</p>

<p>"How can we do it?" asked Elwood, who was anxious to give Tim
some warning of his danger. "If we make any sign the Indians will
see us."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; for they are not looking in this direction all
the time, while Tim knows that we are watching him."</p>

<p>"Yes; but he has his hands full to see that the savages do not
find him."</p>

<p>The case looked critical indeed. Tim was nearing the point where
it seemed inevitable that a discovery should take place. He paused
at nearly every step or two, looked behind him and up and down
the river in a manner that showed plainly enough his fear of his
enemies. Elwood Brandon in his eagerness had risen to his feet,
and was looking intently at him, waiting until he should cast
his eye toward the island that he might give him warning. But
the Irishman was so occupied with his enemies that he appeared
to forget the existence of his friends.</p>

<p>Elwood did not remove his gaze, and all at once he saw him raise
his head. Quick as a flash the boy sprung up a foot or two from
the ground and waved his hat toward him.</p>

<p>"Did he see me?" he asked, as he sunk down to the earth again.</p>

<p>"He has paused and is looking toward us."</p>

<p>Tim had caught sight of the signal of the boy, but was uncertain
as to its meaning. The waving of the hat might be supposed as
an act of encouragement than otherwise; but there was something
in the silent, hurried manner of his young friend, united with
the fact that he had been, and was still, in great personal peril,
that arrested his attention and set him to thinking.</p>

<p>"Did the Indians see me?" asked Elwood.</p>

<p>"I can't say positively, as I was looking at Tim at the moment
you made your signal, but they do not seem to act as if they had
discovered us."</p>

<p>"Tim saw me, didn't he? He doesn't know what to make of it."</p>

<p>The Irishman had laid the animal he was carrying upon the ground,
and stood looking toward the inland as if waiting for some further
manifestation before advancing or retreating. Believing the safety
of the entire party demanded it, Elwood begun cautiously rising
to his feet to repeat his warning, when he was quickly caught
by his cousin.</p>

<p>"Down! those Indians are suspicious; they are looking right at
us&mdash;don't stir."</p>

<p>The admonition was not a moment too soon; but while it prevented
discovery on the part of the boys, it rendered the signal already
given the Irishman void and of no effect. Tim, seeing nothing
more of his young friend, concluded that all was right, and lifting
his game to his shoulder continued his descent until he reached
his canoe. This was drawn from its hiding place and launched in
the water, and the animal placed in the rear. Seating himself
carefully in the front, Tim lifted his paddle and began making
his way toward the inland.</p>

<p>"Too bad! too bad!" muttered Elwood, unable to repress his feelings.
"He is coming right out where they will have a fair chance with
their rifles."</p>

<p>"If he would only turn up stream, they would see nothing of him."</p>

<p>"<em>Can't</em> I warn him?"</p>

<p>"No, Elwood, it will make matters worse. Their eyes are fixed
upon us."</p>

<p>Grasping the long oar Tim headed his boat somewhat up stream,
so as not to let it drift by the island, and commenced paddling
across. He had gone twenty rods or thereabouts when he was discovered
by the Indians, and one of them raised his rifle and took aim
at him.</p>

<p>"Quick, Tim, drop down, or you'll be shot!" called out Howard,
forgetful of his own danger in the single hope of saving his friend
from a violent death.</p>

<p>At the same instant that this cry was uttered the terrified boy
saw a puff of smoke issue from the Indian rifle, and simultaneous
with the sharp crack Tim O'Rooney was seen to fall flat in the
canoe.</p>

<p>"He is shot!" called out Elwood.</p>

<p>"It is time then for us to do some of the same kind of business,"
replied Howard, sighting his own gun at the savage upon the shore.
The distance was too great and his skill too slight to guide the
ball with anything like certainty, but it skipped over the water
at their very feet, and so alarmed them that they immediately
dodged back under the shelter of the rocks and trees.</p>

<p>"What is the use?" asked Elwood gloomily. "Poor Tim is killed
and there is no chance for us."</p>

<p>"Look! he is not dead!" whispered Howard.</p>

<p>The head of the Irishman was seen to rise stealthily from the
bottom of the canoe, and to peer around, and then to dash down
again as though fearful of another shot.</p>

<p>"I don't believe he has been struck!" added Howard. "He dropped
down so as to save himself."</p>

<p>"Oh! I hope so, for we need him bad enough. See! he is fixing
the body of the animal so that it shall be between him and the
Indians' guns."</p>

<p>Such was the case. Tim was arranging and placing the carcass
so that it might shield his own body while he managed the paddle.
This completed he turned his face toward his young friends and
called across the water:</p>

<p>"Be aisy, me darlings! The owld bullet come close, but not a
hair of Tim O'Rooney's head was touched, and thanks be to heaven
for it!"</p>
