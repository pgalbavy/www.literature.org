<p>MASTER MEADOW MOUSE was pudgy. His legs were so short and his tail was
so short and his ears were so short that he looked even fatter than he
really was. And goodness knows he was plump enough--especially toward
fall when the corn was ripe.
</p>
<p>He lived in Farmer Green's meadow. And he never harmed anybody. For
Master Meadow Mouse was fat and good-natured.
</p><p>Friendly folk, such as Paddy Muskrat and Billy Woodchuck, liked him
because he was good-natured. They always smiled pleasantly when they
spoke of him. And unfriendly folk, such as Peter Mink and Tommy Fox,
liked him because he was fat. When they mentioned him they always
grinned horribly and licked their lips.
</p><p>Now, it was a pity that in Pleasant Valley, where Farmer Green's meadow
lay, there were many of the fat-loving kind. Not only Peter Mink and
Tommy Fox, but Grumpy Weasel, Solomon Owl, Ferdinand Frog, Henry Hawk
and even Miss Kitty Cat were usually on the watch for Master Meadow
Mouse. Naturally, he soon learned to be on the lookout for them. And if
he hadn't seen them first he would never have grown up to be <u>Mister</u>
Meadow Mouse.
</p><p>In spite of all those enemies, Master Meadow Mouse managed to enjoy life
in Farmer Green's meadow. Usually he found plenty of seeds to eat. He
liked to swim in Broad Brook. And in winter, when the snow was deep, he
made tunnels beneath it, and a nest, too, which was snug and warm under
the thick white blanket that covered it.
</p><p>The only time Master Meadow Mouse was ever known to lose his temper was
when Farmer Green mowed the meadow. Under the high grass Master Meadow
Mouse had been able to run about his well-beaten paths unseen by hawks.
But with the grass cut and raked, leaving only naked stubble, he
couldn't hide even from old Mr. Crow. It was no wonder that he agreed
with Bobby Bobolink's wife. The Bobolink family were so upset by haying
that they moved to Cedar Swamp at the very first clatter of the mowing
machine. And when Master Meadow Mouse bade them good-by Mrs. Bobolink
said to him, "What a shame that Farmer Green should break up a happy
home like ours!" And Master Meadow Mouse remarked that it was very
careless of Farmer Green. "He might have waited till the snow comes, at
least, before cutting the grass," said Master Meadow Mouse.
</p><p>"You'd better move to Cedar Swamp with us," Mrs. Bobolink suggested.
"It's a fine place. I know, for we lived there last fall."
</p><p>But Master Meadow Mouse didn't want to move.
</p><p>"The grass will grow again," he explained. "Farmer Green can't stop the
grass from growing, no matter how often he cuts it." And of course that
was quite true.
</p><p>After haying Master Meadow Mouse had to be more careful than ever. He
knew that the hawks would scan the meadow many times a day in hopes of
catching a glimpse of his reddish-brown back.
</p><p>Luckily he succeeded in dodging them. And he dodged a good many other
fierce rascals long after winter with its snow had descended on Pleasant
Valley. Yet he never complained. He said that danger kept the days--and
nights too--from being dull.
