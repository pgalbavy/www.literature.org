<p>The village of Freekirk Head prospered once Code Schofield, Bijonah
Tanner, and Jed Martin had started the ball rolling. Inside a week
another large consignment of fish arrived. Boughton was ready for it,
and for all that could come, he said, in the next two months.
</p><p>This was music to the ears of Code Schofield and the crack crew of the
<u>Charming Lass</u>, and nine days after they had picked up their mooring
in the little crescent harbor they were off again, salt and
bait-laden, for the Banks, expecting to do a little haddocking if they
failed to load down with cod before they disappeared in October.
</p><p>Seven schooners sailed with him that day, and, at the end of nine
weeks, the <u>Lass</u> weighed anchor and charged home with the first
halibut that had come into Freekirk Head in years. On this trip, when
he was left in peace, Code displayed all the remarkable "nose" for
fish that his father had had before him.
</p><p>And when he had weighed out the last of his halibut Bill Boughton led
him into the little office of the fishstand and offered him a quarter
interest in the business.
</p><p>Thereafter Code was to make only such trips as he could spare time
for, and Pete was to have charge of the <u>Lass</u> on other occasions.
</p><p>He had proved himself worth his salt in the eyes of the whole village,
and Boughton needed some one to do the heavy work, while he collected
most of the profits. This business future, and three thousand dollars
in the bank, led Code one day to send to St. John's for an architect,
and to haggle with Al Green concerning the cost of a piece of land
overlooking the blue bay.
</p><p>The very night that Code and Elsa had their last talk Nat Burns was
smuggled aboard a motor sloop lying in Whale Cove and taken over to
Eastport, where he was turned loose in the United States.
</p><p>Half of the value of the <u>Nettie</u> was eaten up by his debts and damage
settlements, and so, the better to clear the whole matter up, he sold
her at auction inside a week and departed with the remnants of his
cash to parts unknown.
</p><p>Since that time not a word or trace of him had been heard in Freekirk
Head except once. That was when the St. John's paper printed a
photograph of an automobile that made a trip across the Hudson Bay
country.
</p><p>Beside the machine stood a man in furs who was claimed by all who saw
the picture to be Nat Burns. Was he running a trap line in the wilds
with the Indians, or was he a passenger in the car under an assumed
name?
</p><p>Elsa Mallaby did not even wait for the departure of the <u>Charming
Lass</u> on her second voyage before she acted on a determination that
had come to her. She shut up Mallaby House entirely, and, with
Caroline as her companion, started on a trip around the world,
promising to be back in three years.
</p><p>But she did not go on the mystery schooner, nor did anybody ever see
or hear of it again.
</p><p>It soon developed that the government officials were hard after the
boat that had impersonated a gunboat, and would make it very hot both
for owners and crew. Elsa knew this the day she made her final
triumphant dash into Freekirk Head, and that was the reason that the
ship only stayed ten minutes.
</p><p>So quietly and skilfully was the whole thing managed that, in the
excitement of Code's arrest, every one thought Elsa and her sister had
come on the evening boat from St. John's.
</p><p>Not three men in the island would have connected her with this strange
craft, and two of those weren't sure enough of anything to speak above
a whisper. The third was Code Schofield.
</p><p>Captain Foraker took the mystery schooner outside the harbor, pointed
her nose straight south by the compass, and held her there for a
matter of ten days. At the end of that time he was in danger of
pushing Haiti off the map, so he went to Port-au-Prince and sold the
schooner at a bargain to the government, which, at that time, happened
to need a first-class battle-ship. Then Captain Foraker and the crew
divided the money (by Elsa's orders), and returned to the States.
</p><p>It was only after the return from his second cruise that Code paid
attention to Nellie Tanner. Something in him that respected her
trouble and Elsa's confession at the same time had kept his lips
sealed during that short stay at home. But one Sunday after the second
trip they climbed to the crest of the mountain back of the closed
Mallaby House, and Code told her what had been in his heart all these
years.
</p><p>For a while she said nothing. The sun was setting over the distant
Maine coast and the clouds all round the horizon were wonderful masses
of short-lived rainbow texture. The sea was the pink and greenish blue
of floating oil.
</p><p>"You get me a trifle shop-worn," she said at last, laughing
uncertainly.
</p><p>"Then I get you?" He had turned toward her with a flash of boyish
eagerness. One look at her radiant face and shining eyes found the
answer.
</p><p>"Shop-worn?" he said after a while. "Well, so am I, a trifle, but not
in the way you mean. If having the down knocked off one and seeing
things truer and better for it is being shop-worn, then thank God for
the wearing.
</p><p>"It has been a roundabout way for us, little girl, but at last our
paths have met, and from now on, God willing, they shall go together.
Come, I want to show you something."
</p><p>They walked through the woods until they found the place where the
surveyors had laid out the foundation plan for the little house. There
they found an interested couple gravely discussing a near-by
excavation with the aid of a blue-print.
</p><p>Presently the couple turned around, and the lovers clutched each other
in amazement.
</p><p>"Bless me," gasped Code, "if it isn't ma and Pete Ellinwood!"
</p><p><strong>THE END</strong>
