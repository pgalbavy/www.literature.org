<p>That which reached the ears of Jack Carleton, while he stood
in the woods, silent and listening, was a peculiar swashing noise,
which continued a few seconds, followed by the same space of silence&mdash;the
intervals being as regular as the ticking of a huge pendulum.
Accompanying the sound was another, a soft, almost inaudible flow,
such as one hears when standing on the bank of a vast stream of
water.</p>

<p>He knew that both were caused by the sweep of the mighty Mississippi
which was near at hand.  The reason for the first he could not
understand, but that of the latter was apparent.  He had never
looked upon the Father of Waters, but many a time he had rested
along the Ohio and been lulled to sleep by its musical flow, even
while the camp-fires of the hostile red men twinkled on the other
shore.</p>

<p>Manifestly nothing could be done by remaining where he was, and,
in the same guarded manner in which he left the trail a half hour
before, he began picking his way back.  Probably he ran greater
personal risk in following the beaten path, yet he was controlled
by a true hunter's instinct in every movement made.</p>

<p>When he reached the trail, he observed that not only had the
night descended, but the full moon was shining from an almost
unclouded sky.  The trees, crowned with exuberant vegetation,
cast deep shadows, like those of the electric light, and only
here and there did the arrowy moonbeams strike the ground, redolent
with the odors of fresh earth and moldering leaves.</p>

<p>"Some of the warriors may be returning or groping along the trail,"
was the thought of the youth, who glided silently forward, his
senses on the alert.  His misgivings, however, were much less
than when watching the two Shawanoes, for with the dense gloom
of the forest inclosing him on every hand, he felt that the shelter
was not only secure but was of instant avail.</p>

<p>Less than a furlong was passed, when he caught the shimmering
of water.  A few steps further and he stood for the first time
on the bank of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The youth felt those emotions which must come to every one when
he emerges from a vast forest at night and pauses beside one of
the grandest streams of the globe.  At that day its real source
was unknown, but Jack, who was unusually well informed for one
of his years, was aware that it rose somewhere among the snowy
mountains and unexplored regions far to the northward, and that,
after its winding course of hundreds of leagues, during which
it received the volume of many rivers, enormous in themselves,
it debouched into the tropical waters of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>The reflection of the turbid current showed that it was flowing
swiftly.  The dark line of the forest on the other shore appeared
like a solid wall of blackness, while to the north and south the
view ended in the same impenetrable gloom.</p>

<p>Impressed and awed by the scene, the lad saw something which
at first startled him by its resemblance to a man, standing in
the river, with his feet braced against the bottom and his head
and shoulders above the surface.  The current seemed to rush against
his bared breast, from which it was cast back and aside, as though
flung off by a granite rock.  Then the head bowed forward, as
if the strong man sought to bathe his brain in the cooling waters,
that he might be refreshed against the next shock.</p>

<p>A minute's scrutiny was enough to show Jack that the object was
a tree, which, rolling into the river at some point, perhaps hundreds
of miles above, had grown weary of its journey, and, plunging
its feet into the muddy bed of the stream, had, refused to go
further. The fierce current would lift the head several feet with
a splash, but could hold it thus only a part of a minute, when
it would dip for a brief while, to rise again and repeat the action.</p>

<p>The tree was what is known to-day on the Mississippi as a "sawyer,"
and which is so dreaded by the steamers and other craft navigating
the river.  Many a boat striking at full speed against them, have
had their hulls pierced as if by a hundred-pound shell, and have
gone to the bottom like stone.</p>

<p>It was the sound made by the "sawyer" which had puzzled Jack
Carleton before he caught sight of the great river.  He could
not wonder that he had failed to guess the cause of the intermittent
swash which reached him through the woods.</p>

<p>"And we must cross that stream,"  murmured Jack, with half a
shudder, as he looked out upon the prodigious volume rushing southward
like myriads of wild horses; "it seems to me no one can swim to
the other shore, nor can a raft or boat be pushed thither."</p>

<p>The plucky boy would not have felt so distrustful and timid had
the sun been shining overhead.</p>

<p>"Ish dot you, Jack?"</p>

<p>Young Carleton turned his head as if a war hoop had sounded in
his ear.  He fairly bounded feet when he recognized his old friend
at his elbow.  The good-natured German lad was grinning with delight,
as he extended his chubby hand and asked:</p>

<p>"How you vos?"</p>

<p>"Why, Otto!" gasped Jack, slapping his palm against that of his
friend and crushing it as if in a vise.  "I am so glad to see
you."</p>

<p>"So I vos," was the grinning response; "I'm always glad to shake
hands mit myself."</p>

<p>"But," said the other, looking furtively over each shoulder in
turn, "let's move away the trail, where we cannot be seen or heard."</p>

<p>The suggestion was a wise one, and acted upon without delay.
The friends entered the wood, which continued quite open, and
tramped steadily forward with the intention of finding place where
they could start a fire and converse without danger of discovery
by enemies.</p>

<p>The hearts of both were too full for hold their peace while stealing
forward among the trees.</p>

<p>"Otto," said Jack, "where is the colt?"</p>

<p>"I dinks he's purty near New Orleans as soon as dis time."</p>

<p>Young Carleton looked wonderingly toward friend and asked, "What
do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I don't mean vot I don't say and derefore dinks I mean vot I
vos."</p>

<p>"So the colt went into the river?  Where were you?"</p>

<p>"Mit de colt and he vos mit me, so we bot vos mit each other. 
Just feels of me."</p>

<p>Jack reached out his hand and pinched the clothing of his friend
in several places.  It was saturated.</p>

<p>"Ven I valks, de vater in my shoes squishes up to mine ears&mdash;don't
you hear 'em?"</p>

<p>"Why don't you pour it out?"</p>

<p>"I hef done so, tree time already &mdash;I done so again once
more."</p>

<p>And, without ado, the young German threw himself forward on his
hands and head and kicked his feet with a vigor that sent the
moisture in every direction.  Indeed the performance was conducted
with so much ardor that one of the shoes flow off with considerable
violence.  Otto then reversed himself and assumed the upright
posture.</p>

<p>"Mine gracious," he exclaimed, "where didn't dot shoe of mine
went?"</p>

<p>"It just missed my face," replied Jack, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Dot vos lucky," said Otto, beginning to search for his property.</p>

<p>"Yes; it might have hurt me pretty bad."</p>

<p>"I means it vos lucky for de shoe," added Otto, who, in groping
about, stumbled at that moment upon the missing article.  "Bime
by de vater soaks down mine shoes agin and I stands on head and
kicks it out."</p>

<p>But Jack Carleton was anxious to learn what had befallen his
friend since their voluntary separation some hours before, and
so, while they were advancing along the shore, the story was told.</p>

<p>Otto, as he had agreed to do, was riding at a leisurely pace,
when, without the least warning, the sharp crack of a rifle broke
the stillness of, the woods on his right, and the bullet zipped
so close to his forehead that it literally grazed the skin, leaving
a faint mark, which was visible several days afterward.</p>

<p>The lad was never so frightened in all his life.  For a minute
or so he was absolutely speechless, during which the horse, alarmed
in a less degree than he, broke into a trot.  Otto, however, quickly
regained his self-control, and fully realized his danger.  He
did not glance behind him nor to the right or left.  No investigation
was needed convince him of his peril.  He put the horse to a dead
run, first throwing himself forward on his neck so as to offer
the least possible target to his enemies.</p>

<p>Only the single shot was fired, and Jack counted it strange that
the report failed to reach his ears.  When the fugitive had gone
a considerable distance, he ventured to look back.  He thought
he saw several Indians, but it was probably fancy, for had they
observed he was leaving them behind (as would have been the case),
they surely would have appealed to their rifles again.</p>

<p>Otto was in such danger from the overhanging limbs, and was so
fearful that he was running a gauntlet of Indians, that he kept
his head close to the mane of his steed and scarcely looked to
see where they were going.</p>

<p>The awakening came like an electric shock, when the terrified
horse made a tremendous plunge straight out into the river.  The
first notice Otto received was the chilling embrace of the waters
which enveloped him to the ears.  He held his rifle in his right
hand, and, in his desperate efforts to save that, was swept from
the back of the animal, which began swimming composedly down stream,
carrying saddle, blankets and other valuable articles that were
strapped to him back.</p>

<p>Encumbered with his heavy clothing and his gun, young Otto Relstaub
had all he could do to fight his way back to land.  He escaped
shipwreck as by a hair's-breadth, from the sawyer which had attracted
the notice of Jack.</p>

<p>"I vos swimming as hard as nefer vos," he explained, "and had
just got in front of the tree, ven as true as I don't live, it
banged right down on top mit me and nearly knocked out my brains
out.  I grabbed hold of it, when it raised up and frowed me over
its head. Den I gots mad and swims ashore."</p>

<p>Jack laughed, for, though he knew his friend was prone to exaggeration,
he could understand that his experience was similar, in many respects,
to what he had stated.</p>

<p>"After the shore reaches me," continued Otto, "I turns around
free, four times to find where I ain't.  I see de colt going down
stream as fast as if two Indians was on his back sitting and paddling
him mit paddles.  I called to him to come back and explained dot
he would cotch him cold if he didn't stay too long in de vater,
but he makes belief he don't hears me, and I bothers him no more."</p>

<p>"There will be trouble at home when your father finds out the
colt is lost," said Jack Carleton, who knew how harsh the parent
of Otto was; "it must be he returned to land further down."</p>

<p>"Yes; bimeby he comes ashore."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you recover him?"</p>

<p>"'Cause he swims out on de oder side and he would not wait till
I could go back mit de settlements and got mine frens to come
and build one boat.  I vos gone so long dot it vos night ven I
comes back, and ven I sees you I dinks you vos an Indian or maybe
some other loafer."</p>

<p>Jack Carleton was about to reply to this remark when both he
and his friend caught sight the same moment of the star-like twinkle
of a point of light.</p>

<p>While there was nothing specially noteworthy in this, yet both
were impressed by the fact that the light was not only on the
river, but was serving as a signal to some one standing on the
same shore with them.</p>
