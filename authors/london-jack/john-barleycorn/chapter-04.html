My next bout with John Barleycorn occurred when I was seven.  This
time my imagination was at fault, and I was frightened into the
encounter.  Still farming, my family had moved to a ranch on the
bleak sad coast of San Mateo County, south of San Francisco.  It
was a wild, primitive countryside in those days; and often I heard
my mother pride herself that we were old American stock and not
immigrant Irish and Italians like our neighbours.  In all our
section there was only one other old American family.
<P>
One Sunday morning found me, how or why I cannot now remember, at
the Morrisey ranch.  A number of young people had gathered there
from the nearer ranches.  Besides, the oldsters had been there,
drinking since early dawn, and, some of them, since the night
before.  The Morriseys were a huge breed, and there were many
strapping great sons and uncles, heavy-booted, big-fisted, rough-
voiced.
<P>
Suddenly there were screams from the girls and cries of "Fight!"
There was a rush.  Men hurled themselves out of the kitchen.  Two
giants, flush-faced, with greying hair, were locked in each
other's arms.  One was Black Matt, who, everybody said, had killed
two men in his time.  The women screamed softly, crossed
themselves, or prayed brokenly, hiding their eyes and peeping
through their fingers.  But not I.  It is a fair presumption that
I was the most interested spectator.  Maybe I would see that
wonderful thing, a man killed.  Anyway, I would see a man-fight. 
Great was my disappointment.  Black Matt and Tom Morrisey merely
held on to each other and lifted their clumsy-booted feet in what
seemed a grotesque, elephantine dance.  They were too drunk to
fight.  Then the peacemakers got hold of them and led them back to
cement the new friendship in the kitchen.
<P>
Soon they were all talking at once, rumbling and roaring as big-
chested open-air men will, when whisky has whipped their
taciturnity.  And I, a little shaver of seven, my heart in my
mouth, my trembling body strung tense as a deer's on the verge of
flight, peered wonderingly in at the open door and learned more of
the strangeness of men.  And I marvelled at Black Matt and Tom
Morrisey, sprawled over the table, arms about each other's necks,
weeping lovingly.
<P>
The kitchen-drinking continued, and the girls outside grew
timorous.  They knew the drink game, and all were certain that
something terrible was going to happen.  They protested that they
did not wish to be there when it happened, and some one suggested
going to a big Italian rancho four miles away, where they could
get up a dance.  Immediately they paired off, lad and lassie, and
started down the sandy road.  And each lad walked with his
sweetheart--trust a child of seven to listen and to know the love-
affairs of his countryside.  And behold, I, too, was a lad with a
lassie.  A little Irish girl of my own age had been paired off
with me.  We were the only children in this spontaneous affair. 
Perhaps the oldest couple might have been twenty.  There were
chits of girls, quite grown up, of fourteen and sixteen, walking
with their fellows.  But we were uniquely young, this little Irish
girl and I, and we walked hand in hand, and, sometimes, under the
tutelage of our elders, with my arm around her waist.  Only that
wasn't comfortable.  And I was very proud, on that bright Sunday
morning, going down the long bleak road among the sandhills.  I,
too, had my girl, and was a little man.
<P>
The Italian rancho was a bachelor establishment.  Our visit was
hailed with delight.  The red wine was poured in tumblers for all,
and the long dining-room was partly cleared for dancing.  And the
young fellows drank and danced with the girls to the strains of an
accordion.  To me that music was divine.  I had never heard
anything so glorious.  The young Italian who furnished it would
even get up and dance, his arms around his girl, playing the
accordion behind her back.  All of which was very wonderful for
me, who did not dance, but who sat at a table and gazed wide-eyed
at the amazingness of life.  I was only a little lad, and there
was so much of life for me to learn.  As the time passed, the
Irish lads began helping themselves to the wine, and jollity and
high spirits reigned.  I noted that some of them staggered and
fell down in the dances, and that one had gone to sleep in a
corner.  Also, some of the girls were complaining, and wanting to
leave, and others of the girls were titteringly complacent,
willing for anything to happen.
<P>
When our Italian hosts had offered me wine in a general sort of
way, I had declined.  My beer experience had been enough for me,
and I had no inclination to traffic further in the stuff, or in
anything related to it.  Unfortunately, one young Italian, Peter,
an impish soul, seeing me sitting solitary, stirred by a whim of
the moment, half-filled a tumbler with wine and passed it to me. 
He was sitting across the table from me.  I declined.  His face
grew stern, and he insistently proffered the wine.  And then
terror descended upon me--a terror which I must explain.
<P>
My mother had theories.  First, she steadfastly maintained that
brunettes and all the tribe of dark-eyed humans were deceitful. 
Needless to say, my mother was a blonde.  Next, she was convinced
that the dark-eyed Latin races were profoundly sensitive,
profoundly treacherous, and profoundly murderous.  Again and
again, drinking in the strangeness and the fearsomeness of the
world from her lips, I had heard her state that if one offended an
Italian, no matter how slightly and unintentionally, he was
certain to retaliate by stabbing one in the back.  That was her
particular phrase--"stab you in the back."
<P>
Now, although I had been eager to see Black Matt kill Tom Morrisey
that morning, I did not care to furnish to the dancers the
spectacle of a knife sticking in my back.  I had not yet learned
to distinguish between facts and theories.  My faith was implicit
in my mother's exposition of the Italian character.  Besides, I
had some glimmering inkling of the sacredness of hospitality. 
Here was a treacherous, sensitive, murderous Italian, offering me
hospitality.  I had been taught to believe that if I offended him
he would strike at me with a knife precisely as a horse kicked out
when one got too close to its heels and worried it.  Then, too,
this Italian, Peter, had those terrible black eyes I had heard my
mother talk about.  They were eyes different from the eyes I knew,
from the blues and greys and hazels of my own family, from the
pale and genial blues of the Irish.  Perhaps Peter had had a few
drinks.  At any rate, his eyes were brilliantly black and
sparkling with devilry.  They were the mysterious, the unknown,
and who was I, a seven-year-old, to analyse them and know their
prankishness? In them I visioned sudden death, and I declined the
wine half-heartedly.  The expression in his eyes changed.  They
grew stern and imperious as he shoved the tumbler of wine closer.
<P>
What could I do? I have faced real death since in my life, but
never have I known the fear of death as I knew it then.  I put the
glass to my lips, and Peter's eyes relented.  I knew he would not
kill me just then.  That was a relief.  But the wine was not.  It
was cheap, new wine, bitter and sour, made of the leavings and
scrapings of the vineyards and the vats, and it tasted far worse
than beer.  There is only one way to take medicine, and that is to
take it.  And that is the way I took that wine.  I threw my head
back and gulped it down.  I had to gulp again and hold the poison
down, for poison it was to my child's tissues and membranes.
<P>
Looking back now, I can realise that Peter was astounded.  He
half-filled a second tumbler and shoved it across the table. 
Frozen with fear, in despair at the fate which had befallen me, I
gulped the second glass down like the first.  This was too much
for Peter.  He must share the infant prodigy he had discovered. 
He called Dominick, a young moustached Italian, to see the sight. 
This time it was a full tumbler that was given me.  One will do
anything to live.  I gripped myself, mastered the qualms that rose
in my throat, and downed the stuff.
<P>
Dominick had never seen an infant of such heroic calibre.  Twice
again he refilled the tumbler, each time to the brim, and watched
it disappear down my throat.  By this time my exploits were
attracting attention.  Middle-aged Italian labourers, old-country
peasants who did not talk English, and who could not dance with
the Irish girls, surrounded me.  They were swarthy and wild-
looking; they wore belts and red shirts; and I knew they carried
knives; and they ringed me around like a pirate chorus.  And Peter
and Dominick made me show off for them.
<P>
Had I lacked imagination, had I been stupid, had I been stubbornly
mulish in having my own way, I should never have got in this
pickle.  And the lads and lassies were dancing, and there was no
one to save me from my fate.  How much I drank I do not know.  My
memory of it is of an age-long suffering of fear in the midst of a
murderous crew, and of an infinite number of glasses of red wine
passing across the bare boards of a wine-drenched table and going
down my burning throat.  Bad as the wine was, a knife in the back
was worse, and I must survive at any cost.
<P>
Looking back with the drinker's knowledge, I know now why I did
not collapse stupefied upon the table.  As I have said, I was
frozen, I was paralysed, with fear.  The only movement I made was
to convey that never-ending procession of glasses to my lips.  I
was a poised and motionless receptacle for all that quantity of
wine.  It lay inert in my fear-inert stomach.  I was too
frightened, even, for my stomach to turn.  So all that Italian
crew looked on and marvelled at the infant phenomenon that downed
wine with the sang-froid of an automaton.  It is not in the spirit
of braggadocio that I dare to assert they had never seen anything
like it.
<P>
The time came to go.  The tipsy antics of the lads had led a
majority of the soberer-minded lassies to compel a departure.  I
found myself, at the door, beside my little maiden.  She had not
had my experience, so she was sober.  She was fascinated by the
titubations of the lads who strove to walk beside their girls, and
began to mimic them.  I thought this a great game, and I, too,
began to stagger tipsily.  But she had no wine to stir up, while
my movements quickly set the fumes rising to my head.  Even at the
start, I was more realistic than she.  In several minutes I was
astonishing myself.  I saw one lad, after reeling half a dozen
steps, pause at the side of the road, gravely peer into the ditch,
and gravely, and after apparent deep thought, fall into it.  To me
this was excruciatingly funny.  I staggered to the edge of the
ditch, fully intending to stop on the edge.  I came to myself, in
the ditch, in process of being hauled out by several anxious-faced
girls.
<P>
I didn't care to play at being drunk any more.  There was no more
fun in me.  My eyes were beginning to swim, and with wide-open
mouth I panted for air.  A girl led me by the hand on either side,
but my legs were leaden.  The alcohol I had drunk was striking my
heart and brain like a club.  Had I been a weakling of a child, I
am confident that it would have killed me.  As it was, I know I
was nearer death than any of the scared girls dreamed.  I could
hear them bickering among themselves as to whose fault it was;
some were weeping--for themselves, for me, and for the disgraceful
way their lads had behaved.  But I was not interested.  I was
suffocating, and I wanted air.  To move was agony.  It made me
pant harder.  Yet those girls persisted in making me walk, and it
was four miles home.  Four miles! I remember my swimming eyes saw
a small bridge across the road an infinite distance away.  In
fact, it was not a hundred feet distant.  When I reached it, I
sank down and lay on my back panting.  The girls tried to lift me,
but I was helpless and suffocating.  Their cries of alarm brought
Larry, a drunken youth of seventeen, who proceeded to resuscitate
me by jumping on my chest.  Dimly I remember this, and the
squalling of the girls as they struggled with him and dragged him
away.  And then I knew nothing, though I learned afterward that
Larry wound up under the bridge and spent the night there.
<P>
When I came to, it was dark.  I had been carried unconscious for
four miles and been put to bed.  I was a sick child, and, despite
the terrible strain on my heart and tissues, I continually
relapsed into the madness of delirium.  All the contents of the
terrible and horrible in my child's mind spilled out.  The most
frightful visions were realities to me.  I saw murders committed,
and I was pursued by murderers.  I screamed and raved and fought. 
My sufferings were prodigious.  Emerging from such delirium, I
would hear my mother's voice: "But the child's brain.  He will
lose his reason." And sinking back into delirium, I would take the
idea with me and be immured in madhouses, and be beaten by
keepers, and surrounded by screeching lunatics.
<P>
One thing that had strongly impressed my young mind was the talk
of my elders about the dens of iniquity in San Francisco's
Chinatown.  In my delirium I wandered deep beneath the ground
through a thousand of these dens, and behind locked doors of iron
I suffered and died a thousand deaths.  And when I would come upon
my father, seated at table in these subterranean crypts, gambling
with Chinese for great stakes of gold, all my outrage gave vent in
the vilest cursing.  I would rise in bed, struggling against the
detaining hands, and curse my father till the rafters rang.  All
the inconceivable filth a child running at large in a primitive
countryside may hear men utter was mine; and though I had never
dared utter such oaths, they now poured from me, at the top of my
lungs, as I cursed my father sitting there underground and
gambling with long-haired, long-nailed Chinamen.
<P>
It is a wonder that I did not burst my heart or brain that night. 
A seven-year-old child's arteries and nerve-centres are scarcely
fitted to endure the terrific paroxysms that convulsed me.  No one
slept in the thin, frame farm-house that night when John
Barleycorn had his will of me.  And Larry, under the bridge, had
no delirium like mine.  I am confident that his sleep was
stupefied and dreamless, and that he awoke next day merely to
heaviness and moroseness, and that if he lives to-day he does not
remember that night, so passing was it as an incident.  But my
brain was seared for ever by that experience.  Writing now, thirty
years afterward, every vision is as distinct, as sharp-cut, every
pain as vital and terrible, as on that night.
<P>
I was sick for days afterward, and I needed none of my mother's
injunctions to avoid John Barleycorn in the future.  My mother had
been dreadfully shocked.  She held that I had done wrong, very
wrong, and that I had gone contrary to all her teaching.  And how
was I, who was never allowed to talk back, who lacked the very
words with which to express my psychology--how was I to tell my
mother that it was her teaching that was directly responsible for
my drunkenness? Had it not been for her theories about dark eyes
and Italian character, I should never have wet my lips with the
sour, bitter wine.  And not until man-grown did I tell her the
true inwardness of that disgraceful affair.
<P>
In those after days of sickness, I was confused on some points,
and very clear on others.  I felt guilty of sin, yet smarted with
a sense of injustice.  It had not been my fault, yet I had done
wrong.  But very clear was my resolution never to touch liquor
again.  No mad dog was ever more afraid of water than was I of
alcohol.
<P>
Yet the point I am making is that this experience, terrible as it
was, could not in the end deter me from forming John Barleycorn's
cheek-by-jowl acquaintance.  All about me, even then, were the
forces moving me toward him.  In the first place, barring my
mother, ever extreme in her views, it seemed to me all the grown-
ups looked upon the affair with tolerant eyes.  It was a joke,
something funny that had happened.  There was no shame attached. 
Even the lads and lassies giggled and snickered over their part in
the affair, narrating with gusto how Larry had jumped on my chest
and slept under the bridge, how So-and-So had slept out in the
sandhills that night, and what had happened to the other lad who
fell in the ditch.  As I say, so far as I could see, there was no
shame anywhere.  It had been something ticklishly, devilishly
fine--a bright and gorgeous episode in the monotony of life and
labour on that bleak, fog-girt coast.
<P>
The Irish ranchers twitted me good-naturedly on my exploit, and
patted me on the back until I felt that I had done something
heroic.  Peter and Dominick and the other Italians were proud of
my drinking prowess.  The face of morality was not set against
drinking.  Besides, everybody drank.  There was not a teetotaler
in the community.  Even the teacher of our little country school,
a greying man of fifty, gave us vacations on the occasions when he
wrestled with John Barleycorn and was thrown.  Thus there was no
spiritual deterrence.  My loathing for alcohol was purely
physiological.  I didn't like the damned stuff.
