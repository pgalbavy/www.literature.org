<p>TO</p>
<p>My Dear Tommy,</p>

<p>You and I have long cherished an affection for that elemental
type of tale which Americans call the "dime novel" and which we
know as the "shocker"â€”the romance where the incidents defy the
probabilities, and march just inside the borders of the possible.
During an illness last winter I exhausted my store of those aids
to cheerfulness, and was driven to write one for myself. This
little volume is the result, and I should like to put your name
on it in memory of our long friendship, in the days when the wildest
fictions are so much less improbable than the facts.</p>

<p><em>J.B</em>.</p>

<p>Sept. 1915</p>
