<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>That morning and noon had been warm, though the stirrings of
a feeble breeze made weather not flagrantly intemperate; but at
about three o'clock in the afternoon there came out of the southwest
a heat like an affliction sent upon an accursed people, and the
air was soon dead of it. Dripping negro ditch-diggers whooped
with satires praising hell and hot weather, as the tossing shovels
flickered up to the street level, where sluggish male pedestrians
carried coats upon hot arms, and fanned themselves with straw
hats, or, remaining covered, wore soaked handkerchiefs between
scalp and straw. Clerks drooped in silent, big department stores,
stenographers in offices kept as close to electric fans as the
intervening bulk of their employers would let them; guests in
hotels left the lobbies and went to lie unclad upon their beds;
while in hospitals the patients murmured querulously against the
heat, and perhaps against some noisy motorist who strove to feel
the air by splitting it, not troubled by any foreboding that he,
too, that hour next week, might need quiet near a hospital. The
"hot spell" was a true spell, one upon men's spirits; for it was
so hot that, in suburban outskirts, golfers crept slowly back
over the low undulations of their club lands, abandoning their
matches and returning to shelter.</p>

<p>Even on such a day, sizzling work had to be done, as in winter.
There were glowing furnaces to be stoked, liquid metals to be
poured; but such tasks found seasoned men standing to them; and
in all the city probably no brave soul challenged the heat more
gamely than Mrs. Adams did, when, in a corner of her small and
fiery kitchen, where all day long her hired African immune cooked
fiercely, she pressed her husband's evening clothes with a hot
iron. No doubt she risked her life, but she risked it cheerfully
in so good and necessary a service for him. She would have given
her life for him at any time, and both his and her own for her
children.</p>

<p>Unconscious of her own heroism, she was surprised to find herself
rather faint when she finished her ironing. However, she took
heart to believe that the clothes looked better, in spite of one
or two scorched places; and she carried them upstairs to her husband's
room before increasing blindness forced her to grope for the nearest
chair. Then, trying to rise and walk, without having sufficiently
recovered, she had to sit down again; but after a little while
she was able to get upon her feet; and, keeping her hand against
the wall, moved successfully to the door of her own room. Here
she wavered; might have gone down, had she not been stimulated
by the thought of how much depended upon her;&mdash;she made a final
great effort, and floundered across the room to her bureau, where
she kept some simple restoratives. They served her need, or her
faith in them did; and she returned to her work.</p>

<p>She went down the stairs, keeping a still tremulous hand upon
the rail; but she smiled brightly when Alice looked up from below,
where the woodwork was again being tormented with superfluous
attentions.</p>

<p>"Alice, <em>DON'T!" </em>her mother said, commiseratingly. "You
did all that this morning and it looks lovely. What's the use
of wearing yourself out on it? You ought to be lying down, so's
to look fresh for to-night."</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better lie down yourself?" the daughter returned.
"Are you ill, mama?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. What in the world makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"You look pretty pale," Alice said, and sighed heavily. "It makes
me ashamed, having you work so hard&mdash;for me."</p>

<p>"How foolish! I think it's fun, getting ready to entertain a
little again, like this. I only wish it hadn't turned so hot:
I'm afraid your poor father'll suffer&mdash;his things are pretty heavy,
I noticed. Well, it'll do him good to bear something for style's
sake this once, anyhow!"  She laughed, and coming to Alice, bent
down and kissed her. "Dearie,"  she said, tenderly, "wouldn't
you please slip upstairs now and take just a little teeny nap
to please your mother?"</p>

<p>But Alice responded only by moving her head slowly, in token
of refusal.</p>

<p>"Do!" Mrs. Adams urged. "You don't want to look worn out, do
you?"</p>

<p>"I'll <em>LOOK </em>all right," Alice said, huskily. "Do you
like the way I've arranged the furniture now? I've tried all the
different ways it'll go."</p>

<p>"It's lovely," her mother said, admiringly. "I thought the last
way you had it was pretty, too. But you know best; I never knew
anybody with so much taste. If you'd only just quit now, and take
a little rest&#11834;"</p>

<p>"There'd hardly be time, even if I wanted to; it's after five
but I couldn't; really, I couldn't. How do you think we can manage
about Walter&mdash;to see that he wears his evening things, I mean?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams pondered. "I'm afraid he'll make a lot of objections,
on account of the weather and everything. I wish we'd had a chance
to tell him last night or this morning. I'd have telephoned to
him this afternoon except&mdash;well, I scarcely like to call him up
at that place, since your father&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, of course not, mama."</p>

<p>"If Walter gets home late," Mrs. Adams went on, "I'll just slip
out and speak to him, in case Mr. Russell's here before he comes.
I'll just tell him he's got to hurry and get his things on."</p>

<p>"Maybe he won't come home to dinner," Alice suggested, rather
hopefully. "Sometimes he doesn't."</p>

<p>"No; I think he'll be here. When he doesn't come he usually telephones
by this time to say not to wait for him; he's very thoughtful
about that. Well, it really is getting late: I must go and tell
her she ought to be preparing her fillet. Dearie, DO rest a little."</p>

<p>"You'd much better do that yourself," Alice called after her,
but Mrs. Adams shook her head cheerily, not pausing on her way
to the fiery kitchen.</p>

<p>Alice continued her useless labours for a time; then carried
her bucket to the head of the cellar stairway, where she left
it upon the top step; and, closing the door, returned to the "living-room;"
Again she changed the positions of the old plush rocking-chairs,
moving them into the corners where she thought they might be least
noticeable; and while thus engaged she was startled by a loud
ringing of the door-bell. For a moment her face was panic-stricken,
and she stood staring, then she realized that Russell would not
arrive for another hour, at the earliest, and recovering her equipoise,
went to the door.</p>

<p>Waiting there, in a languid attitude, was a young coloured woman,
with a small bundle under her arm and something malleable in her
mouth. "Listen," she said. "You folks expectin' a coloured lady?"</p>

<p>"No," said Alice. "Especially not at the front door."</p>

<p>"Listen," the coloured woman said again. "Listen. Say, listen.
Ain't they another coloured lady awready here by the day? Listen.
Ain't Miz Malena Burns here by the day this evenin'? Say, listen.
This the number house she give ME."</p>

<p>"Are you the waitress?" Alice asked, dismally.</p>

<p>"Yes'm, if Malena here."</p>

<p>"Malena is here," Alice said, and hesitated; but she decided
not to send the waitress to the back door; it might be a risk.
She let her in. "What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Me? I'm name' Gertrude. Miss Gertrude Collamus."</p>

<p>"Did you bring a cap and apron?"</p>

<p>Gertrude took the little bundle from under her arm. "Yes'm. I'm
all fix'."</p>

<p>"I've already set the table," Alice said. "I'll show you what
we want done."</p>

<p>She led the way to the dining-room, and, after offering some
instruction there, received by Gertrude with languor and a slowly
moving jaw, she took her into the kitchen, where the cap and apron
were put on. The effect was not fortunate; Gertrude's eyes were
noticeably bloodshot, an affliction made more apparent by the
white cap; and Alice drew her mother apart, whispering anxiously,</p>

<p>"Do you suppose it's too late to get someone else?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it is," Mrs. Adams said. "Malena says it was hard
enough to get <em>HER! </em>You have to pay them so much that
they only work when they feel like it."</p>

<p>"Mama, could you ask her to wear her cap straighter? Every time
she moves her head she gets it on one side, and her skirt's too
long behind and too short in front&mdash;and oh, I've <em>NEVER </em>seen
such <em>FEET!" </em>Alice laughed desolately. "And she <em>MUST
</em>quit that terrible chewing!"</p>

<p>"Never mind; I'll get to work with her. I'll straighten her out
all I can, dearie; don't worry." Mrs. Adams patted her daughter's
shoulder encouragingly. "Now <em>YOU </em>can't do another thing,
and if you don't run and begin dressing you won't be ready. It'll
only take me a minute to dress, myself, and I'll be down long
before you will. Run, darling! I'll look after everything."</p>

<p>Alice nodded vaguely, went up to her room, and, after only a
moment with her mirror, brought from her closet the dress of white
organdie she had worn the night when she met Russell for the first
time. She laid it carefully upon her bed, and began to make ready
to put it on. Her mother came in, half an hour later, to "fasten"
her.</p>

<p>"I'M all dressed," Mrs. Adams said, briskly. "Of course it doesn't
matter. He won't know what the rest of us even look like: How
could he? I know I'm an old <em>SIGHT, </em>but all I want is
to look respectable. Do I?"</p>

<p>"You look like the best woman in the world; that's all!" Alice
said, with a little gulp.</p>

<p>Her mother laughed and gave her a final scrutiny. "You might
use just a tiny bit more colour, dearie &mdash;I'm afraid the
excitement's made you a little pale. And you <em>MUST </em>brighten
up! There's sort of a look in your eyes as if you'd got in a trance
and couldn't get out. You've had it all day. I must run: your
father wants me to help him with his studs. Walter hasn't come
yet, but I'll look after him; don't worry, And you better <em>HURRY,
</em>dearie, if you're going to take any time fixing the flowers
on the table."</p>

<p>She departed, while Alice sat at the mirror again, to follow
her advice concerning a "tiny bit more colour." Before she had
finished, her father knocked at the door, and, when she responded,
came in. He was dressed in the clothes his wife had pressed; but
he had lost substantially in weight since they were made for him;
no one would have thought that they had been pressed. They hung
from him voluminously, seeming to be the clothes of a larger man.</p>

<p>"Your mother's gone downstairs," he said, in a voice of distress.</p>

<p>"One of the buttonholes in my shirt is too large and I can't
keep the dang thing fastened. <em>I</em> don't know what to do
about it! I only got one other white shirt, and it's kind of ruined:
I tried it before I did this one. Do you s'pose you could do anything?"</p>

<p>"I'll see," she said.</p>

<p>"My collar's got a frayed edge," he complained, as she examined
his troublesome shirt. "It's a good deal like wearing a saw; but
I expect it'll wilt down flat pretty soon, and not bother me long.
I'm liable to wilt down flat, myself, I expect; I don't know as
I remember any such hot night in the last ten or twelve years."
He lifted his head and sniffed the flaccid air, which was laden
with a heavy odour. "My, but that smell is pretty strong!" he
said.</p>

<p>"Stand still, please, papa," Alice begged him. "I can't see what's
the matter if you move around. How absurd you are about your old
glue smell, papa! There isn't a vestige of it, of course."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean glue," he informed her. "I mean cabbage. Is that
fashionable now, to have cabbage when there's company for dinner?"</p>

<p>"That isn't cabbage, papa. It's Brussels sprouts."</p>

<p>"Oh, is it? I don't mind it much, because it keeps that glue
smell off me, but it's fairly strong. I expect you don't notice
it so much because you been in the house with it all along, and
got used to it while it was growing."</p>

<p>"It is pretty dreadful," Alice said. "Are all the windows open
downstairs?"</p>

<p>"I'll go down and see, if you'll just fix that hole up for me."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't," she said. "Not unless you take your shirt
off and bring it to me. I'll have to sew the hole smaller."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I'll go ask your mother to&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No," said Alice. "She's got everything on her hands. Run and
take it off. Hurry, papa; I've got to arrange the flowers on the
table before he comes."</p>

<p>He went away, and came back presently, half undressed, bringing
the shirt. "There's <em>ONE </em>comfort," he remarked, pensively,
as she worked. "I've got that collar off&mdash;for a while, anyway.
I wish I could go to table like this; I could stand it a good
deal better. Do you seem to be making any headway with the dang
thing?"</p>

<p>"I think probably I can&#11834;"</p>

<p>Downstairs the door-bell rang, and Alice's arms jerked with the
shock.</p>

<p>"Golly!" her father said. "Did you stick your finger with that
fool needle?"</p>

<p>She gave him a blank stare. "He's come!"</p>

<p>She was not mistaken, for, upon the little veranda, Russell stood
facing the closed door at last. However, it remained closed for
a considerable time after he rang. Inside the house the warning
summons of the bell was immediately followed by another sound,
audible to Alice and her father as a crash preceding a series
of muffled falls. Then came a distant voice, bitter in complaint.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!" said Adams. "What's that?"</p>

<p>Alice went to the top of the front stairs, and her mother appeared
in the hall below.</p>

<p>"Mama!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams looked up. "It's all right," she said, in a loud whisper.
"Gertrude fell down the cellar stairs. Somebody left a bucket
there, and&#11834;" She was interrupted by a gasp from Alice, and
hastened to reassure her. "Don't worry, dearie. She may limp a
little, but&#11834;"</p>

<p>Adams leaned over the banisters. "Did she break anything?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Hush!" his wife whispered. "No. She seems upset and angry about
it, more than anything else; but she's rubbing herself, and she'll
be all right in time to bring in the little sandwiches. Alice!
Those flowers!"</p>

<p>"I know, mama. But&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Hurry!" Mrs. Adams warned her. "Both of you hurry! I <em>MUST
</em>let him in!"</p>

<p>She turned to the door, smiling cordially, even before she opened
it. "Do come right in, Mr. Russell," she said, loudly, lifting
her voice for additional warning to those above. "I'm SO glad
to receive you informally, this way, in our own little home. There's
a hat-rack here under the stairway," she continued, as Russell,
murmuring some response, came into the hall. "I'm afraid you'll
think it's almost <em>TOO </em>informal, my coming to the door,
but unfortunately our housemaid's just had a little accident&mdash;oh,
nothing to mention! I just thought we better not keep you waiting
any longer. Will you step into our living-room, please?"</p>

<p>She led the way between the two small columns, and seated herself
in one of the plush rocking-chairs, selecting it because Alice
had once pointed out that the chairs, themselves, were less noticeable
when they had people sitting in them. "Do sit down, Mr. Russell;
it's so very warm it's really quite a trial just to stand up!"</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, as he took a seat. "Yes. It is quite warm."
And this seemed to be the extent of his responsiveness for the
moment. He was grave, rather pale; and Mrs. Adams's impression
of him, as she formed it then, was of "a distinguished-looking
young man, really elegant in the best sense of the word, but timid
and formal when he first meets you." She beamed upon him, and
used with everything she said a continuous accompaniment of laughter,
meaningless except that it was meant to convey cordiality. "Of
course we DO have a great deal of warm weather," she informed
him. "I'm glad it's so much cooler in the house than it is outdoors."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "It is pleasanter indoors." And, stopping with
this single untruth, he permitted himself the briefest glance
about the room; then his eyes returned to his smiling hostess.</p>

<p>"Most people make a great fuss about hot weather," she said.
"The only person I know who doesn't mind the heat the way other
people do is Alice. She always seems as cool as if we had a breeze
blowing, no matter how hot it is. But then she's so amiable she
never minds anything. It's just her character. She's always been
that way since she was a little child; always the same to everybody,
high and low. I think character's the most important thing in
the world, after all, don't you, Mr. Russell?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, solemnly; and touched his bedewed white forehead
with a handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Indeed it is," she agreed with herself, never failing to continue
her murmur of laughter. "That's what I've always told Alice; but
she never sees anything good in herself, and she just laughs at
me when I praise her. She sees good in everybody <em>ELSE </em>in
the world, no matter how unworthy they are, or how they behave
toward <em>HER; </em>but she always underestimates herself. From
the time she was a little child she was always that way. When
some other little girl would behave selfishly or meanly toward
her, do you think she'd come and tell me? Never a word to anybody!
The little thing was too proud! She was the same way about school.
The teachers had to tell me when she took a prize; she'd bring
it home and keep it in her room without a word about it to her
father and mother. Now, Walter was just the other way. Walter
would&#11834;" But here Mrs. Adams checked herself, though she increased
the volume of her laughter. "How silly of me!" she exclaimed.
"I expect you know how mothers <em>ARE, </em>though, Mr. Russell.
Give us a chance and we'll talk about our children forever! Alice
would feel terribly if she knew how I've been going on about her
to you."</p>

<p>In this Mrs. Adams was right, though she did not herself suspect
it, and upon an almost inaudible word or two from him she went
on with her topic. "Of course my excuse is that few mothers have
a daughter like Alice. I suppose we all think the same way about
our children, but <em>SOME </em>of us must be right when we feel
we've got the best. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"I'm sure <em>I</em> am!" she laughed. "I'll let the others speak
for themselves." She paused reflectively. "No; I think a mother
knows when she's got a treasure in her family. If she <em>HASN'T
</em>got one, she'll pretend she has, maybe; but if she has, she
knows it. I certainly know <em>I</em> have. She's always been
what people call 'the joy of the household'&mdash;always cheerful,
no matter what went wrong, and always ready to smooth things over
with some bright, witty saying. You must be sure not to <em>TELL
</em>we've had this little chat about her&mdash;she'd just be furious
with me&mdash;but she IS such a dear child! You won't tell her, will
you?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, and again applied the handkerchief to his forehead
for an instant. "No, I'll&#11834;" He paused, and finished lamely:
"I'll&mdash;not tell her."</p>

<p>Thus reassured, Mrs. Adams set before him some details of her
daughter's popularity at sixteen, dwelling upon Alice's impartiality
among her young suitors: "She never could <em>BEAR </em>to hurt
their feelings, and always treated all of them just alike. About
half a dozen of them were just <em>BOUND </em>to marry her! Naturally,
her father and I considered any such idea ridiculous; she was
too young, of course."</p>

<p>Thus the mother went on with her biographical sketches, while
the pale young man sat facing her under the hard overhead light
of a white globe, set to the ceiling; and listened without interrupting.
She was glad to have the chance to tell him a few things about
Alice he might not have guessed for himself, and, indeed, she
had planned to find such an opportunity, if she could; but this
was getting to be altogether too much of one, she felt. As time
passed, she was like an actor who must improvise to keep the audience
from perceiving that his fellow-players have missed their cues;
but her anxiety was not betrayed to the still listener; she had
a valiant soul.</p>

<p>Alice, meanwhile, had arranged her little roses on the table
in as many ways, probably, as there were blossoms; and she was
still at it when her father arrived in the dining-room by way
of the back stairs and the kitchen.</p>

<p>"It's pulled out again," he said. "But I guess there's no help
for it now; it's too late, and anyway it lets some air into me
when it bulges. I can sit so's it won't be noticed much, I expect.
Isn't it time you quit bothering about the looks of the table?
Your mother's been talking to him about half an hour now, and
I had the idea he came on your account, not hers. Hadn't you better
go and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Just a minute." Alice said, piteously. "Do <em>YOU </em>think
it looks all right?"</p>

<p>"The flowers? Fine! Hadn't you better leave 'em the way they
are, though?"</p>

<p>"Just a minute," she begged again. "Just <em>ONE </em>minute,
papa!" And she exchanged a rose in front of Russell's plate for
one that seemed to her a little larger.</p>

<p>"You better come on," Adams said, moving to the door.</p>

<p>"Just <em>ONE </em>more second, papa." She shook her head, lamenting.
"Oh, I wish we'd rented some silver!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because so much of the plating has rubbed off a lot of it. <em>JUST
</em>a second, papa." And as she spoke she hastily went round
the table, gathering the knives and forks and spoons that she
thought had their plating best preserved, and exchanging them
for more damaged pieces at Russell's place. "There!" she sighed,
finally.</p>

<p>"Now I'll come." But at the door she paused to look back dubiously,
over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?"</p>

<p>"The roses. I believe after all I shouldn't have tried that vine
effect; I ought to have kept them in water, in the vase. It's
so hot, they already begin to look a little wilted, out on the
dry tablecloth like that. I believe I'll&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Why, look here, Alice!" he remonstrated, as she seemed disposed
to turn back. "Everything'll burn up on the stove if you keep
on&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, well," she said, "the vase was terribly ugly; I can't do
any better. We'll go in." But with her hand on the door-knob she
paused. "No, papa. We mustn't go in by this door. It might look
as if&#11834;"</p>

<p>"As if what?"</p>

<p>"Never mind," she said. "Let's go the other way."</p>

<p>"I don't see what difference it makes," he grumbled, but nevertheless
followed her through the kitchen, and up the back stairs then
through the upper hallway. At the top of the front stairs she
paused for a moment, drawing a deep breath; and then, before her
father's puzzled eyes, a transformation came upon her.</p>

<p>Her shoulders, like her eyelids, had been drooping, but now she
threw her head back: the shoulders straightened, and the lashes
lifted over sparkling eyes; vivacity came to her whole body in
a flash; and she tripped down the steps, with her pretty hands
rising in time to the lilting little tune she had begun to hum.</p>

<p>At the foot of the stairs, one of those pretty hands extended
itself at full arm's length toward Russell, and continued to be
extended until it reached his own hand as he came to meet her.
"How terrible of me!" she exclaimed. "To be so late coming down!
And papa, too &mdash;I think you know each other."</p>

<p>Her father was advancing toward the young man, expecting to shake
hands with him, but Alice stood between them, and Russell, a little
flushed, bowed to him gravely over her shoulder, without looking
at him; whereupon Adams, slightly disconcerted, put his hands
in his pockets and turned to his wife.</p>

<p>"I guess dinner's more'n ready," he said. "We better go sit down."</p>

<p>But she shook her head at him fiercely, "Wait!" she whispered.</p>

<p>"What for? For Walter?"</p>

<p>"No; he can't be coming," she returned, hurriedly, and again
warned him by a shake of her head. "Be quiet!"</p>

<p>"Oh, well&#11834;" he muttered.</p>

<p>"Sit down!"</p>

<p>He was thoroughly mystified, but obeyed her gesture and went
to the rocking-chair in the opposite corner, where he sat down,
and, with an expression of meek inquiry, awaited events.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Alice prattled on: "It's really not a fault of mine,
being tardy. The shameful truth is I was trying to hurry papa.
He's incorrigible: he stays so late at his terrible old factory&mdash;terrible
new factory, I should say. I hope you don't <em>HATE </em>us for
making you dine with us in such fearful weather! I'm nearly dying
of the heat, myself, so you have a fellow-sufferer, if that pleases
you. Why is it we always bear things better if we think other
people have to stand them, too?" And she added, with an excited
laugh: "<em>SILLY </em>of us, don't you think?"</p>

<p>Gertrude had just made her entrance from the dining-room, bearing
a tray. She came slowly, with an air of resentment; and her skirt
still needed adjusting, while her lower jaw moved at intervals,
though not now upon any substance, but reminiscently, of habit.
She halted before Adams, facing him.</p>

<p>He looked plaintive. "What you want o' me?" he asked.</p>

<p>For response, she extended the tray toward him with a gesture
of indifference; but he still appeared to be puzzled. "What in
the world&#11834;?" he began, then caught his wife's eye, and had
presence of mind enough to take a damp and plastic sandwich from
the tray. "Well, I'll <em>TRY </em>one," he said, but a moment
later, as he fulfilled this promise, an expression of intense
dislike came upon his features, and he would have returned the
sandwich to Gertrude. However, as she had crossed the room to
Mrs. Adams he checked the gesture, and sat helplessly, with the
sandwich in his hand. He made another effort to get rid of it
as the waitress passed him, on her way back to the dining-room,
but she appeared not to observe him, and he continued to be troubled
by it.</p>

<p>Alice was a loyal daughter. "These are delicious, mama," she
said; and turning to Russell, "You missed it; you should have
taken one. Too bad we couldn't have offered you what ought to
go with it, of course, but&#11834;"</p>

<p>She was interrupted by the second entrance of Gertrude, who announced,
"Dinner serve'," and retired from view.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" Adams said, rising from his chair, with relief.
"That's good! Let's go see if we can eat it." And as the little
group moved toward the open door of the dining-room he disposed
of his sandwich by dropping it in the empty fireplace.</p>

<p>Alice, glancing back over her shoulder, was the only one who
saw him, and she shuddered in spite of herself. Then, seeing that
he looked at her entreatingly, as if he wanted to explain that
he was doing the best he could, she smiled upon him sunnily, and
began to chatter to Russell again.</p>
