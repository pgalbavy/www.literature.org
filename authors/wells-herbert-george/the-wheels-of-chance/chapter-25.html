Mr. Hoopdriver conducted the rest of that night's journey with
the same confident dignity as before, and it was chiefly by good
luck and the fact that most roads about a town converge
thereupon, that Chichester was at last attained. It seemed at
first as though everyone had gone to bed, but the Red Hotel still
glowed yellow and warm. It was the first time Hoopdriver bad
dared the mysteries of a 'first-class' hotel.' But that night he
was in the mood to dare anything.
<P>
"So you found your Young Lady at last," said the ostler of the
Red Hotel; for it chanced he was one of those of whom Hoopdriver
had made inquiries in the afternoon.
<P>
"Quite a misunderstanding," said Hoopdriver, with splendid
readiness. "My sister had gone to Bognor But I brought her back
here. I've took a fancy to this place. And the moonlight's simply
dee-vine."
<P>
"We've had supper, thenks, and we're tired," said Mr. Hoopdriver.
"I suppose you won't take anything,--Jessie?" 
<P>
The glory of having her, even as a sister! and to call her Jessie
like that! But he carried it off splendidly, as he felt himself
bound to admit. "Good-night, Sis," he said, "and pleasant dreams.
I'll just 'ave a look at this paper before I turn in." But this
was living indeed! he told himself.
<P>
So gallantly did Mr. Hoopdriver comport himself up to the very
edge of the Most Wonderful Day of all. It had begun early, you
will remember, with a vigil in a little sweetstuff shop next door
to the Angel at Midhurst. But to think of all the things that had
happened since then! He caught himself in the middle of a yawn,
pulled out his watch, saw the time was halfpast eleven, and
marched off, with a fine sense of heroism, bedward.
