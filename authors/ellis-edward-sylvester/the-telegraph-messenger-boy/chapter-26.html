<p>In closing the history of Ben Mayberry, the telegraph messenger
boy, it seems to me I can do no better than by using the words
of the hero himself. The following letter I received only a few
days since. It is the last which has come to hand from Ben, who
writes me regularly, as he has done ever since I was transferred
from the office in Damietta. I should add that the date of the
letter is nine years subsequent to that of his visit to the metropolis
as the guest of Mr. James Willard:</p>

"My Dear Mr. Melville,<br/>
&mdash;I am now in my twenty-fifth year.<br/>
In looking back it seems only a few years ago that you<br/>
called me to you, on the street of my native city, and<br/>
offered to make me general utility boy in the telegraph<br/>
office of Damietta. My mother and I were nearly starving<br/>
at the time, and no kindness could have been more<br/>
appropriate than yours, nor could anyone have shown<br/>
greater tact and wisdom in cultivating the good instincts<br/>
of a ragged urchin, who, otherwise, was likely to go to<br/>
ruin.

</p>
<p>
"You awakened my ambition and incited me to study; you<br/>
impressed upon me the beauty and truth of the declaration<br/>
that there is no royal road to learning; that if I<br/>
expected to attain success in any walk of life it could<br/>
only be done by hard, unremitting, patient work. There are<br/>
many rounds to the ladder, and each must climb them one by<br/>
one.

</p>
<p>
"Good fortune attended me in every respect. It was the<br/>
providence of God which saved me and enabled me to help<br/>
save sweet Dolly when the bridge went down in the storm<br/>
and darkness, and her mother was lost; yet, but for my<br/>
determination to do my best at all times, and never to<br/>
give up so long as I could struggle, I must have<br/>
succumbed.

</p>
<p>
"It was extremely fortunate that I saw the burglars at<br/>
work in the jewelry establishment of Mr. Grandin on that<br/>
memorable night in Damietta. The same stroke of fortune<br/>
might have fallen to any boy, but it was incomplete until<br/>
I was able to bring the leader to the ground with the<br/>
stone which I hurled at him.

</p>
<p>
"It may be said that all these are but mere incidents of<br/>
my history, and possibly I may have magnified their<br/>
importance; but, though my progress was rapid, it never<br/>
could have carried me successfully along without the<br/>
regular, systematic, hard work with which I employed my<br/>
spare hours, when not devoted to exercise. In this world<br/>
that which wins, is work, work, work!

</p>
<p>
"When I was fifteen years old, I was made the manager of<br/>
the office in Damietta, with a larger salary than I was<br/>
entitled to. Three years later, the partiality of Mr.<br/>
Musgrave made me assistant superintendent, and now I have<br/>
been general superintendent of the district for more than<br/>
two years, with a handsome salary, which enables me to<br/>
give my dear mother comforts and elegances of which the<br/>
good lady never dreamed.

</p>
<p>
"I married Dolly shortly after my promotion to the office<br/>
of general superintendent, and the little fellow that is<br/>
learning to lisp 'papa,' you know, has been named after<br/>
you, my old, true, and invaluable friend, to whose counsel<br/>
and kindness I feel I am so much indebted.

</p>
<p>
"Dolly sits at my elbow and continually reminds me that I<br/>
must insist that you come down and spend Christmas with<br/>
us. A chair and plate will be placed at the table for you,<br/>
and you must allow nothing less than Providence itself to<br/>
keep you away.

</p>
<p>
"As ever,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your devoted friend,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ben."
