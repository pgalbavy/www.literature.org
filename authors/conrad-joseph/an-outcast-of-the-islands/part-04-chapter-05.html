<p>Willems turned a little from her and spoke lower.</p>

<p>"Look at that," he said, with an almost imperceptible movement
of his head towards the woman to whom he was presenting his shoulder.
"Look at that! Don’t believe her! What has she been saying to
you? What? I have been asleep. Had to sleep at last. I’ve been
waiting for you three days and nights. I had to sleep some time.
Hadn’t I? I told her to remain awake and watch for you, and call
me at once. She did watch. You can’t believe her. You can’t believe
any woman. Who can tell what’s inside their heads? No one. You
can know nothing. The only thing you can know is that it isn’t
anything like what comes through their lips. They live by the
side of you. They seem to hate you, or they seem to love you;
they caress or torment you; they throw you over or stick to you
closer than your skin for some inscrutable and awful reason of
their own&mdash;which you can never know! Look at her&mdash;and look at
me. At me!&mdash;her infernal work. What has she been saying?"</p>

<p>His voice had sunk to a whisper. Lingard listened with great
attention, holding his chin in his hand, which grasped a great
handful of his white beard. His elbow was in the palm of his other
hand, and his eyes were still fixed on the ground. He murmured,
without looking up&mdash;</p>

<p>"She begged me for your life&mdash;if you want to know&mdash;as if the
thing were worth giving or taking!"</p>

<p>"And for three days she begged me to take yours," said Willems
quickly. "For three days she wouldn’t give me any peace. She was
never still. She planned ambushes. She has been looking for places
all over here where I could hide and drop you with a safe shot
as you walked up. It’s true. I give you my word."</p>

<p>"Your word," muttered Lingard, contemptuously.</p>

<p>Willems took no notice.</p>

<p>"Ah! She is a ferocious creature," he went on. "You don’t know
. . . I wanted to pass the time&mdash;to do something&mdash;to have something
to think about&mdash;to forget my troubles till you came back. And
. . . look at her . . . she took me as if I did not belong to
myself. She did. I did not know there was something in me she
could get hold of. She, a savage. I, a civilized European, and
clever! She that knew no more than a wild animal! Well, she found
out something in me. She found it out, and I was lost. I knew
it. She tormented me. I was ready to do anything. I resisted&mdash;but
I was ready. I knew that too. That frightened me more than anything;
more than my own sufferings; and that was frightful enough, I
assure you."</p>

<p>Lingard listened, fascinated and amazed like a child listening
to a fairy tale, and, when Willems stopped for breath, he shuffled
his feet a little.</p>

<p>"What does he say?" cried out Aissa, suddenly.</p>

<p>The two men looked at her quickly, and then looked at one another.</p>

<p>Willems began again, speaking hurriedly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I tried to do something. Take her away from those people. I
went to Almayer; the biggest blind fool that you ever . . . Then
Abdulla came&mdash;and she went away. She took away with her something
of me which I had to get back. I had to do it. As far as you are
concerned, the change here had to happen sooner or later; you
couldn’t be master here for ever. It isn’t what I have done that
torments me. It is the why. It’s the madness that drove me to
it. It’s that thing that came over me. That may come again, some
day."</p>

<p>"It will do no harm to anybody then, I promise you," said Lingard,
significantly.</p>

<p>Willems looked at him for a second with a blank stare, then went
on&mdash;</p>

<p>"I fought against her. She goaded me to violence and to murder.
Nobody knows why. She pushed me to it persistently, desperately,
all the time. Fortunately Abdulla had sense. I don’t know what
I wouldn’t have done. She held me then. Held me like a nightmare
that is terrible and sweet. By and by it was another life. I woke
up. I found myself beside an animal as full of harm as a wild
cat. You don’t know through what I have passed. Her father tried
to kill me&mdash;and she very nearly killed him. I believe she would
have stuck at nothing. I don’t know which was more terrible! She
would have stuck at nothing to defend her own. And when I think
that it was me&mdash;me &mdash;Willems . . . I hate her. To-morrow
she may want my life. How can I know what’s in her? She may want
to kill me next!"</p>

<p>He paused in great trepidation, then added in a scared tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don’t want to die here."</p>

<p>"Don’t you?" said Lingard, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Willems turned towards Aissa and pointed at her with a bony forefinger.</p>

<p>"Look at her! Always there. Always near. Always watching, watching
. . . for something. Look at her eyes. Ain’t they big? Don’t they
stare? You wouldn’t think she can shut them like human beings
do. I don’t believe she ever does. I go to sleep, if I can, under
their stare, and when I wake up I see them fixed on me and moving
no more than the eyes of a corpse. While I am still they are still.
By God&mdash;she can’t move them till I stir, and then they follow
me like a pair of jailers. They watch me; when I stop they seem
to wait patient and glistening till I am off my guard&mdash;for to
do something. To do something horrible. Look at them! You can
see nothing in them. They are big, menacing&mdash;and empty. The eyes
of a savage; of a damned mongrel, half-Arab, half-Malay. They
hurt me! I am white! I swear to you I can’t stand this! Take me
away. I am white! All white!"</p>

<p>He shouted towards the sombre heaven, proclaiming desperately
under the frown of thickening clouds the fact of his pure and
superior descent. He shouted, his head thrown up, his arms swinging
about wildly; lean, ragged, disfigured; a tall madman making a
great disturbance about something invisible; a being absurd, repulsive,
pathetic, and droll. Lingard, who was looking down as if absorbed
in deep thought, gave him a quick glance from under his eyebrows:
Aissa stood with clasped hands. At the other end of the courtyard
the old woman, like a vague and decrepit apparition, rose noiselessly
to look, then sank down again with a stealthy movement and crouched
low over the small glow of the fire. Willems’ voice filled the
enclosure, rising louder with every word, and then, suddenly,
at its very loudest, stopped short&mdash;like water stops running from
an over-turned vessel. As soon as it had ceased the thunder seemed
to take up the burden in a low growl coming from the inland hills.
The noise approached in confused mutterings which kept on increasing,
swelling into a roar that came nearer, rushed down the river,
passed close in a tearing crash&mdash;and instantly sounded faint,
dying away in monotonous and dull repetitions amongst the endless
sinuosities of the lower reaches. Over the great forests, over
all the innumerable people of unstirring trees&mdash;over all that
living people immense, motionless, and mute&mdash;the silence, that
had rushed in on the track of the passing tumult, remained suspended
as deep and complete as if it had never been disturbed from the
beginning of remote ages. Then, through it, after a time, came
to Lingard’s ears the voice of the running river: a voice low,
discreet, and sad, like the persistent and gentle voices that
speak of the past in the silence of dreams.</p>

<p>He felt a great emptiness in his heart. It seemed to him that
there was within his breast a great space without any light, where
his thoughts wandered forlornly, unable to escape, unable to rest,
unable to die, to vanish&mdash;and to relieve him from the fearful
oppression of their existence. Speech, action, anger, forgiveness,
all appeared to him alike useless and vain, appeared to him unsatisfactory,
not worth the effort of hand or brain that was needed to give
them effect. He could not see why he should not remain standing
there, without ever doing anything, to the end of time. He felt
something, something like a heavy chain, that held him there.
This wouldn’t do. He backed away a little from Willems and Aissa,
leaving them close together, then stopped and looked at both.
The man and the woman appeared to him much further than they really
were. He had made only about three steps backward, but he believed
for a moment that another step would take him out of earshot for
ever. They appeared to him slightly under life size, and with
a great cleanness of outlines, like figures carved with great
precision of detail and highly finished by a skilful hand. He
pulled himself together. The strong consciousness of his own personality
came back to him. He had a notion of surveying them from a great
and inaccessible height.</p>

<p>He said slowly: "You have been possessed of a devil."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Willems gloomily, and looking at Aissa. "Isn’t
it pretty?"</p>

<p>"I’ve heard this kind of talk before," said Lingard, in a scornful
tone; then paused, and went on steadily after a while: "I regret
nothing. I picked you up by the waterside, like a starving cat&mdash;by
God. I regret nothing; nothing that I have done. Abdulla&mdash;twenty
others&mdash;no doubt Hudig himself, were after me. That’s business&mdash;for
them. But that you should . . . Money belongs to him who picks
it up and is strong enough to keep it&mdash;but this thing was different.
It was part of my life. . . . I am an old fool."</p>

<p>He was. The breath of his words, of the very words he spoke,
fanned the spark of divine folly in his breast, the spark that
made him&mdash;the hard-headed, heavy-handed adventurer&mdash;stand out
from the crowd, from the sordid, from the joyous, unscrupulous,
and noisy crowd of men that were so much like himself.</p>

<p>Willems said hurriedly: "It wasn’t me. The evil was not in me,
Captain Lingard."</p>

<p>"And where else confound you! Where else?" interrupted Lingard,
raising his voice. "Did you ever see me cheat and lie and steal?
Tell me that. Did you? Hey? I wonder where in perdition you came
from when I found you under my feet. . . . No matter. You will
do no more harm."</p>

<p>Willems moved nearer, gazing upon him anxiously. Lingard went
on with distinct deliberation&mdash;</p>

<p>"What did you expect when you asked me to see you? What? You
know me. I am Lingard. You lived with me. You’ve heard men speak.
You knew what you had done. Well! What did you expect?"</p>

<p>"How can I know?" groaned Willems, wringing his hands; "I was
alone in that infernal savage crowd. I was delivered into their
hands. After the thing was done, I felt so lost and weak that
I would have called the devil himself to my aid if it had been
any good&mdash;if he hadn’t put in all his work already. In the whole
world there was only one man that had ever cared for me. Only
one white man. You! Hate is better than being alone! Death is
better! I expected . . . anything. Something to expect. Something
to take me out of this. Out of her sight!"</p>

<p>He laughed. His laugh seemed to be torn out from him against
his will, seemed to be brought violently on the surface from under
his bitterness, his self-contempt, from under his despairing wonder
at his own nature.</p>

<p>"When I think that when I first knew her it seemed to me that
my whole life wouldn’t be enough to . . . And now when I look
at her! She did it all. I must have been mad. I was mad. Every
time I look at her I remember my madness. It frightens me. . .
. And when I think that of all my life, of all my past, of all
my future, of my intelligence, of my work, there is nothing left
but she, the cause of my ruin, and you whom I have mortally offended
. . ."</p>

<p>He hid his face for a moment in his hands, and when he took them
away he had lost the appearance of comparative calm and gave way
to a wild distress.</p>

<p>"Captain Lingard . . . anything . . . a deserted island . . .
anywhere . . . I promise . . ."</p>

<p>"Shut up!" shouted Lingard, roughly.</p>

<p>He became dumb, suddenly, completely.</p>

<p>The wan light of the clouded morning retired slowly from the
courtyard, from the clearings, from the river, as if it had gone
unwillingly to hide in the enigmatical solitudes of the gloomy
and silent forests. The clouds over their heads thickened into
a low vault of uniform blackness. The air was still and inexpressibly
oppressive. Lingard unbuttoned his jacket, flung it wide open
and, inclining his body sideways a little, wiped his forehead
with his hand, which he jerked sharply afterwards. Then he looked
at Willems and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"No promise of yours is any good to me. I am going to take your
conduct into my own hands. Pay attention to what I am going to
say. You are my prisoner."</p>

<p>Willems’ head moved imperceptibly; then he became rigid and still.
He seemed not to breathe.</p>

<p>"You shall stay here," continued Lingard, with sombre deliberation.
"You are not fit to go amongst people. Who could suspect, who
could guess, who could imagine what’s in you? I couldn’t! You
are my mistake. I shall hide you here. If I let you out you would
go amongst unsuspecting men, and lie, and steal, and cheat for
a little money or for some woman. I don’t care about shooting
you. It would be the safest way though. But I won’t. Do not expect
me to forgive you. To forgive one must have been angry and become
contemptuous, and there is nothing in me now&mdash;no anger, no contempt,
no disappointment. To me you are not Willems, the man I befriended
and helped through thick and thin, and thought much of . . . You
are not a human being that may be destroyed or forgiven. You are
a bitter thought, a something without a body and that must be
hidden . . . You are my shame."</p>

<p>He ceased and looked slowly round. How dark it was! It seemed
to him that the light was dying prematurely out of the world and
that the air was already dead.</p>

<p>"Of course," he went on, "I shall see to it that you don’t starve."</p>

<p>"You don’t mean to say that I must live here, Captain Lingard?"
said Willems, in a kind of mechanical voice without any inflections.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear me say something I did not mean?" asked Lingard.
"You said you didn’t want to die here&mdash;well, you must live . .
. Unless you change your mind," he added, as if in involuntary
afterthought.</p>

<p>He looked at Willems narrowly, then shook his head.</p>

<p>"You are alone," he went on. "Nothing can help you. Nobody will.
You are neither white nor brown. You have no colour as you have
no heart. Your accomplices have abandoned you to me because I
am still somebody to be reckoned with. You are alone but for that
woman there. You say you did this for her. Well, you have her."</p>

<p>Willems mumbled something, and then suddenly caught his hair
with both his hands and remained standing so. Aissa, who had been
looking at him, turned to Lingard.</p>

<p>"What did you say, Rajah Laut?" she cried.</p>

<p>There was a slight stir amongst the filmy threads of her disordered
hair, the bushes by the river sides trembled, the big tree nodded
precipitately over them with an abrupt rustle, as if waking with
a start from a troubled sleep&mdash;and the breath of hot breeze passed,
light, rapid, and scorching, under the clouds that whirled round,
unbroken but undulating, like a restless phantom of a sombre sea.</p>

<p>Lingard looked at her pityingly before he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have told him that he must live here all his life . . . and
with you."</p>

<p>The sun seemed to have gone out at last like a flickering light
away up beyond the clouds, and in the stifling gloom of the courtyard
the three figures stood colourless and shadowy, as if surrounded
by a black and superheated mist. Aissa looked at Willems, who
remained still, as though he had been changed into stone in the
very act of tearing his hair. Then she turned her head towards
Lingard and shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>"You lie! You lie! . . . White man. Like you all do. You . .
. whom Abdulla made small. You lie!"</p>

<p>Her words rang out shrill and venomous with her secret scorn,
with her overpowering desire to wound regardless of consequences;
in her woman’s reckless desire to cause suffering at any cost,
to cause it by the sound of her own voice&mdash;by her own voice, that
would carry the poison of her thought into the hated heart.</p>

<p>Willems let his hands fall, and began to mumble again. Lingard
turned his ear towards him instinctively, caught something that
sounded like "Very well"&mdash;then some more mumbling&mdash;then a sigh.</p>

<p>"As far as the rest of the world is concerned," said Lingard,
after waiting for awhile in an attentive attitude, "your life
is finished. Nobody will be able to throw any of your villainies
in my teeth; nobody will be able to point at you and say, ‘Here
goes a scoundrel of Lingard’s up-bringing.’ You are buried here."</p>

<p>"And you think that I will stay . . . that I will submit?" exclaimed
Willems, as if he had suddenly recovered the power of speech.</p>

<p>"You needn’t stay here&mdash;on this spot," said Lingard, drily. "There
are the forests&mdash;and here is the river. You may swim. Fifteen
miles up, or forty down. At one end you will meet Almayer, at
the other the sea. Take your choice."</p>

<p>He burst into a short, joyless laugh, then added with severe
gravity&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is also another way."</p>

<p>"If you want to drive my soul into damnation by trying to drive
me to suicide you will not succeed," said Willems in wild excitement.
"I will live. I shall repent. I may escape. . . . Take that woman
away&mdash;she is sin."</p>

<p>A hooked dart of fire tore in two the darkness of the distant
horizon and lit up the gloom of the earth with a dazzling and
ghastly flame. Then the thunder was heard far away, like an incredibly
enormous voice muttering menaces.</p>

<p>Lingard said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don’t care what happens, but I may tell you that without that
woman your life is not worth much&mdash;not twopence. There is a fellow
here who . . . and Abdulla himself wouldn’t stand on any ceremony.
Think of that! And then she won’t go."</p>

<p>He began, even while he spoke, to walk slowly down towards the
little gate. He didn’t look, but he felt as sure that Willems
was following him as if he had been leading him by a string. Directly
he had passed through the wicket-gate into the big courtyard he
heard a voice, behind his back, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think she was right. I ought to have shot you. I couldn’t
have been worse off."</p>

<p>"Time yet," answered Lingard, without stopping or looking back.
"But, you see, you can’t. There is not even that in you."</p>

<p>"Don’t provoke me, Captain Lingard," cried Willems.</p>

<p>Lingard turned round sharply. Willems and Aissa stopped. Another
forked flash of lightning split up the clouds overhead, and threw
upon their faces a sudden burst of light&mdash;a blaze violent, sinister
and fleeting; and in the same instant they were deafened by a
near, single crash of thunder, which was followed by a rushing
noise, like a frightened sigh of the startled earth.</p>

<p>"Provoke you!" said the old adventurer, as soon as he could make
himself heard. "Provoke you! Hey! What’s there in you to provoke?
What do I care?"</p>

<p>"It is easy to speak like that when you know that in the whole
world&mdash;in the whole world &mdash;I have no friend," said Willems.</p>

<p>"Whose fault?" said Lingard, sharply.</p>

<p>Their voices, after the deep and tremendous noise, sounded to
them very unsatisfactory&mdash;thin and frail, like the voices of pigmies&mdash;and
they became suddenly silent, as if on that account. From up the
courtyard Lingard’s boatmen came down and passed them, keeping
step in a single file, their paddles on shoulder, and holding
their heads straight with their eyes fixed on the river. Ali,
who was walking last, stopped before Lingard, very stiff and upright.
He said&mdash;</p>

<p>"That one-eyed Babalatchi is gone, with all his women. He took
everything. All the pots and boxes. Big. Heavy. Three boxes."</p>

<p>He grinned as if the thing had been amusing, then added with
an appearance of anxious concern, "Rain coming."</p>

<p>"We return," said Lingard. "Make ready."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!" ejaculated Ali with precision, and moved on.
He had been quartermaster with Lingard before making up his mind
to stay in Sambir as Almayer’s head man. He strutted towards the
landing-place thinking proudly that he was not like those other
ignorant boatmen, and knew how to answer properly the very greatest
of white captains.</p>

<p>"You have misunderstood me from the first, Captain Lingard,"
said Willems.</p>

<p>"Have I? It’s all right, as long as there is no mistake about
my meaning," answered Lingard, strolling slowly to the landing-place.
Willems followed him, and Aissa followed Willems.</p>

<p>Two hands were extended to help Lingard in embarking. He stepped
cautiously and heavily into the long and narrow canoe, and sat
in the canvas folding-chair that had been placed in the middle.
He leaned back and turned his head to the two figures that stood
on the bank a little above him. Aissa’s eyes were fastened on
his face in a visible impatience to see him gone. Willems’ look
went straight above the canoe, straight at the forest on the other
side of the river.</p>

<p>"All right, Ali," said Lingard, in a low voice.</p>

<p>A slight stir animated the faces, and a faint murmur ran along
the line of paddlers. The foremost man pushed with the point of
his paddle, canted the fore end out of the dead water into the
current; and the canoe fell rapidly off before the rush of brown
water, the stern rubbing gently against the low bank.</p>

<p>"We shall meet again, Captain Lingard!" cried Willems, in an
unsteady voice.</p>

<p>"Never!" said Lingard, turning half round in his chair to look
at Willems. His fierce red eyes glittered remorselessly over the
high back of his seat.</p>

<p>"Must cross the river. Water less quick over there," said Ali.</p>

<p>He pushed in his turn now with all his strength, throwing his
body recklessly right out over the stern. Then he recovered himself
just in time into the squatting attitude of a monkey perched on
a high shelf, and shouted: "Dayong!"</p>

<p>The paddles struck the water together. The canoe darted forward
and went on steadily crossing the river with a sideways motion
made up of its own speed and the downward drift of the current.</p>

<p>Lingard watched the shore astern. The woman shook her hand at
him, and then squatted at the feet of the man who stood motionless.
After a while she got up and stood beside him, reaching up to
his head&mdash;and Lingard saw then that she had wetted some part of
her covering and was trying to wash the dried blood off the man’s
immovable face, which did not seem to know anything about it.
Lingard turned away and threw himself back in his chair, stretching
his legs out with a sigh of fatigue. His head fell forward; and
under his red face the white beard lay fan-like on his breast,
the ends of fine long hairs all astir in the faint draught made
by the rapid motion of the craft that carried him away from his
prisoner&mdash;from the only thing in his life he wished to hide.</p>

<p>In its course across the river the canoe came into the line of
Willems’ sight and his eyes caught the image, followed it eagerly
as it glided, small but distinct, on the dark background of the
forest. He could see plainly the figure of the man sitting in
the middle. All his life he had felt that man behind his back,
a reassuring presence ready with help, with commendation, with
advice; friendly in reproof, enthusiastic in approbation; a man
inspiring confidence by his strength, by his fearlessness, by
the very weakness of his simple heart. And now that man was going
away. He must call him back.</p>

<p>He shouted, and his words, which he wanted to throw across the
river, seemed to fall helplessly at his feet. Aissa put her hand
on his arm in a restraining attempt, but he shook it off. He wanted
to call back his very life that was going away from him. He shouted
again&mdash;and this time he did not even hear himself. No use. He
would never return. And he stood in sullen silence looking at
the white figure over there, lying back in the chair in the middle
of the boat; a figure that struck him suddenly as very terrible,
heartless and astonishing, with its unnatural appearance of running
over the water in an attitude of languid repose.</p>

<p>For a time nothing on earth stirred, seemingly, but the canoe,
which glided up-stream with a motion so even and smooth that it
did not convey any sense of movement. Overhead, the massed clouds
appeared solid and steady as if held there in a powerful grip,
but on their uneven surface there was a continuous and trembling
glimmer, a faint reflection of the distant lightning from the
thunderstorm that had broken already on the coast and was working
its way up the river with low and angry growls. Willems looked
on, as motionless as everything round him and above him. Only
his eyes seemed to live, as they followed the canoe on its course
that carried it away from him, steadily, unhesitatingly, finally,
as if it were going, not up the great river into the momentous
excitement of Sambir, but straight into the past, into the past
crowded yet empty, like an old cemetery full of neglected graves,
where lie dead hopes that never return.</p>

<p>From time to time he felt on his face the passing, warm touch
of an immense breath coming from beyond the forest, like the short
panting of an oppressed world. Then the heavy air round him was
pierced by a sharp gust of wind, bringing with it the fresh, damp
feel of the falling rain; and all the innumerable tree-tops of
the forests swayed to the left and sprang back again in a tumultuous
balancing of nodding branches and shuddering leaves. A light frown
ran over the river, the clouds stirred slowly, changing their
aspect but not their place, as if they had turned ponderously
over; and when the sudden movement had died out in a quickened
tremor of the slenderest twigs, there was a short period of formidable
immobility above and below, during which the voice of the thunder
was heard, speaking in a sustained, emphatic and vibrating roll,
with violent louder bursts of crashing sound, like a wrathful
and threatening discourse of an angry god. For a moment it died
out, and then another gust of wind passed, driving before it a
white mist which filled the space with a cloud of waterdust that
hid suddenly from Willems the canoe, the forests, the river itself;
that woke him up from his numbness in a forlorn shiver, that made
him look round despairingly to see nothing but the whirling drift
of rain spray before the freshening breeze, while through it the
heavy big drops fell about him with sonorous and rapid beats upon
the dry earth. He made a few hurried steps up the courtyard and
was arrested by an immense sheet of water that fell all at once
on him, fell sudden and overwhelming from the clouds, cutting
his respiration, streaming over his head, clinging to him, running
down his body, off his arms, off his legs. He stood gasping while
the water beat him in a vertical downpour, drove on him slanting
in squalls, and he felt the drops striking him from above, from
everywhere; drops thick, pressed and dashing at him as if flung
from all sides by a mob of infuriated hands. From under his feet
a great vapour of broken water floated up, he felt the ground
become soft&mdash;melt under him&mdash;and saw the water spring out from
the dry earth to meet the water that fell from the sombre heaven.
An insane dread took possession of him, the dread of all that
water around him, of the water that ran down the courtyard towards
him, of the water that pressed him on every side, of the slanting
water that drove across his face in wavering sheets which gleamed
pale red with the flicker of lightning streaming through them,
as if fire and water were falling together, monstrously mixed,
upon the stunned earth.</p>

<p>He wanted to run away, but when he moved it was to slide about
painfully and slowly upon that earth which had become mud so suddenly
under his feet. He fought his way up the courtyard like a man
pushing through a crowd, his head down, one shoulder forward,
stopping often, and sometimes carried back a pace or two in the
rush of water which his heart was not stout enough to face. Aissa
followed him step by step, stopping when he stopped, recoiling
with him, moving forward with him in his toilsome way up the slippery
declivity of the courtyard, of that courtyard, from which everything
seemed to have been swept away by the first rush of the mighty
downpour. They could see nothing. The tree, the bushes, the house,
and the fences&mdash;all had disappeared in the thickness of the falling
rain. Their hair stuck, streaming, to their heads; their clothing
clung to them, beaten close to their bodies; water ran off them,
off their heads over their shoulders. They moved, patient, upright,
slow and dark, in the gleam clear or fiery of the falling drops,
under the roll of unceasing thunder, like two wandering ghosts
of the drowned that, condemned to haunt the water for ever, had
come up from the river to look at the world under a deluge.</p>

<p>On the left the tree seemed to step out to meet them, appearing
vaguely, high, motionless and patient; with a rustling plaint
of its innumerable leaves through which every drop of water tore
its separate way with cruel haste. And then, to the right, the
house surged up in the mist, very black, and clamorous with the
quick patter of rain on its high-pitched roof above the steady
splash of the water running off the eaves. Down the plankway leading
to the door flowed a thin and pellucid stream, and when Willems
began his ascent it broke over his foot as if he were going up
a steep ravine in the bed of a rapid and shallow torrent. Behind
his heels two streaming smudges of mud stained for an instant
the purity of the rushing water, and then he splashed his way
up with a spurt and stood on the bamboo platform before the open
door under the shelter of the overhanging eaves&mdash;under shelter
at last!</p>

<p>A low moan ending in a broken and plaintive mutter arrested Willems
on the threshold. He peered round in the half-light under the
roof and saw the old woman crouching close to the wall in a shapeless
heap, and while he looked he felt a touch of two arms on his shoulders.
Aissa! He had forgotten her. He turned, and she clasped him round
the neck instantly, pressing close to him as if afraid of violence
or escape. He stiffened himself in repulsion, in horror, in the
mysterious revolt of his heart; while she clung to him&mdash;clung
to him as if he were a refuge from misery, from storm, from weariness,
from fear, from despair; and it was on the part of that being
an embrace terrible, enraged and mournful, in which all her strength
went out to make him captive, to hold him for ever.</p>

<p>He said nothing. He looked into her eyes while he struggled with
her fingers about the nape of his neck, and suddenly he tore her
hands apart, holding her arms up in a strong grip of her wrists,
and bending his swollen face close over hers, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is all your doing. You . . ."</p>

<p>She did not understand him&mdash;not a word. He spoke in the language
of his people&mdash;of his people that know no mercy and no shame.
And he was angry. Alas! he was always angry now, and always speaking
words that she could not understand. She stood in silence, looking
at him through her patient eyes, while he shook her arms a little
and then flung them down.</p>

<p>"Don’t follow me!" he shouted. "I want to be alone &mdash;I mean
to be left alone!"</p>

<p>He went in, leaving the door open.</p>

<p>She did not move. What need to understand the words when they
are spoken in such a voice? In that voice which did not seem to
be his voice&mdash;his voice when he spoke by the brook, when he was
never angry and always smiling! Her eyes were fixed upon the dark
doorway, but her hands strayed mechanically upwards; she took
up all her hair, and, inclining her head slightly over her shoulder,
wrung out the long black tresses, twisting them persistently,
while she stood, sad and absorbed, like one listening to an inward
voice&mdash;the voice of bitter, of unavailing regret. The thunder
had ceased, the wind had died out, and the rain fell perpendicular
and steady through a great pale clearness&mdash;the light of remote
sun coming victorious from amongst the dissolving blackness of
the clouds. She stood near the doorway. He was there&mdash;alone in
the gloom of the dwelling. He was there. He spoke not. What was
in his mind now? What fear? What desire? Not the desire of her
as in the days when he used to smile . . . How could she know?
. . .</p>

<p>A sigh coming from the bottom of her heart, flew out into the
world through her parted lips. A sigh faint, profound, and broken;
a sigh full of pain and fear, like the sigh of those who are about
to face the unknown: to face it in loneliness, in doubt, and without
hope. She let go her hair, that fell scattered over her shoulders
like a funeral veil, and she sank down suddenly by the door. Her
hands clasped her ankles; she rested her head on her drawn-up
knees, and remained still, very still, under the streaming mourning
of her hair. She was thinking of him; of the days by the brook;
she was thinking of all that had been their love&mdash;and she sat
in the abandoned posture of those who sit weeping by the dead,
of those who watch and mourn over a corpse.</p>
