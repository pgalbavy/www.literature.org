<p><em>NICK RIBSAM </em>and Herbert Watrous could hardly believe
their own senses, and for a second or two looked at each other
and at the cowboys, to make sure they had heard aright.</p>

<p>The youths were lolling near each other, Nick leaning on his
elbow and looking in the broad face of Lattin, who just then was
telling of a scrimmage in which he had had the closest call of
his life while hunting Geronimo, while Herbert sat more erect.</p>

<p>Strubell, as has been told, was lying on his back on the other
side of the camp fire, his hands clasped behind his head, and
resting on his stone pillow. His sombrero lay on his forehead,
in such a way that a part of the rim shaded his eyes, whose view
of the outer world was obtained by gazing down along the front
of his face and chin. He could see his slowly heaving breast,
the cartridge belt, and the one leg crossed over the other and
partly crooked at the knee. Off to the left was the glowing camp
fire, and, by turning his eyes without moving his head, he could
trace a part of the figure of Lattin, who was discoursing for
the entertainment of his young friends.</p>

<p>This was the shape of matters, when the younger cowboy abruptly
checked his narrative, and, looking across the fire at his companion,
warned him not to move on the penalty of instant death, to which
the other, without stirring a muscle or giving any evidence of
alarm, calmly replied that he was aware of his situation, which
was so hopeless that he considered himself the same as dead already.</p>

<p>"Don’t move," added Lattin in a whisper to the boys, "or you
will scare it; keep on talking the same as before, and maybe it
will let him alone."</p>

<p>"What are you referring to?" asked the perplexed Nick.</p>

<p>"There’s a tarantula lying on Arden’s breast; don’t you see it?"</p>

<p>The hideous thing was sitting on the chest of the cowboy, directly
over his heart. Where it had come from no one could say, but probably
the warmth of the fire or that of the body of the Texan had drawn
it to the spot, and it was now making an exploration, on its own
account, ready to inflict its deadly bite on the least provocation.</p>

<p>Strubell was half asleep, when, looking along the front of his
body, he saw the outlines of the spider in the yellow light of
the camp fire. It caused a slight tickling sensation, as it slowly
felt its way forward. He knew its nature the instant he caught
sight of it, and he observed that it was of unusual size and fierceness.
He had seen a comrade die from the bite of a tarantula, which
is held in greater dread than the famous rattlers of Texas, for
it gives no warning of its intentions, which most frequently come
in the form of a nipping bite whose effects are not only fatal
but frightfully rapid.</p>

<p>Arden might have slowly unclasped his hands and given the thing
a quick flirt, but the chances were a thousand to one that, if
he did so, it would bite his finger. If let alone, it might change
its purpose and crawl off into the darkness. It was not likely
to injure him so long as it stayed on the front of his shirt,
for it was hard for it to bite through that. It preferred the
naked surface of the body in order to do its worst.</p>

<p>It could not very well bite the hands, since they remained clasped
behind the Texan’s head. The nearest favorable points were the
neck, where the shirt was open, and the face. If the spider crept
upward, it was evident that it was making for one or the other,
and there seemed no way of checking it, for the first move on
the part of any one of the friends would rouse its anger, and
cause it to bite the man on whose body it was resting. All that
could be done was to do nothing, and pray to Heaven to save the
poor fellow from impending death.</p>

<p>"We mustn’t show by anything we do," said Lattin, "that we are
excited. A quick move—a loud call, or any unusual motion may lead
it to use its teeth. It’s the biggest and ugliest tarantula that
I ever laid eyes on, and if it gives Arden one nip, he’s a goner."</p>

<p>"But it is terrible to sit here and see him die," said Nick,
who was so nervous he found it hard to remain still, while Herbert
trembled as if with a chill.</p>

<p>"It’s all we can do," replied the Texan, who nevertheless kept
a sharp eye on the thing, as if he was meditating some desperate
resort to save his comrade’s life. "We will talk on, as though
nothing has took place out of the usual run, and while we’re at
it we’ll keep an eye on the critter."</p>

<p>"What good will it do to keep an eye on it," was the sensible
question of Nick, "if we do nothing?"</p>

<p>"Leave that to me and don’t either of you stir. You know that
we’re on our way to look after a ranch that Mr. Lord thinks of
buying in New Mexico?"</p>

<p>He paused and gazed at the boys, as if in doubt whether they
understood the matter. They nodded their heads and he continued:</p>

<p>"George Jennings owns the ranch and wants to move east. Last
year he had another in Arizona. It was too small to suit him,
and he came over this way, and now, as I said, wants to get out
of the bus’ness altogether. You know, I s’pose, that they have
warm weather in Arizona at certain times in the year?"</p>

<p>Once more the cowboy checked himself, as if he desired a reply.
He seemed to be looking at the boys, but in reality was watching
the tarantula, which was motionless on the breast of Strubell,
as if he, too, was debating what was best to do.</p>

<p>"I don’t know of any part of the country where they do not have
pretty hot weather in the course of the year," said Nick.</p>

<p>"But Arizona lays over ’em all," said Lattin, as if proud of
the fact; "I’ve seen it day after day there, and night, too, when
the thermometer doesn’t get below a hundred. Wal, it was on one
of them blazing afternoons, that Jennings stretched out on the
floor in his low front room to take a nap. His wife had gone to
San Pedro a couple of days before, under the escort of the two
ranchmen hired by him, and he was looking for ’em back every hour.</p>

<p>"That’s the way it came about that the father was left with his
little gal Mabel, which was only six years old. Jennings loved
that gal more than the apple of his eye, and would give his life
any time to keep her from harm. I b’lieve you’ve a little sister,
Nick, that you think a good deal of?"</p>

<p>"I have, God bless her!" replied Nick, as the moisture crept
in his eyes; "there is nothing I would not do to save her from
suffering and pain."</p>

<p>Again, Lattin seemed to be looking at the countenance of the
honest youth, but in reality his eyes were on the tarantula, and
his right hand was moving slowly down his side toward his revolver
in the belt at his waist.</p>

<p>"That bein’ so, you can understand how much Jennings thought
of his little gal Mabel. Wal, he was in the middle of a nap, when
he jumped to his feet as if he had seen a rattler crawling over
the floor toward him. The reason why he jumped up so quick was
’cause he heard his little gal scream. He went out the door as
if shot from the mouth of a cannon.</p>

<p>"The sight that met the ranchman was enough to set any father
wild. Two of Geronimo’s Apaches, each on a pony, was galloping
off on a dead run. One of them held Mabel in his arms, and the
little gal, at sight of her father, reached out her arms and called
to him to come and take her away from the bad Injun. Don’t you
think that was enough to turn a father’s brain?"</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt of that," replied Nick, shuddering at
the mental picture of his sister Nellie in such an awful situation.</p>

<p>During the momentary pause, Lattin placed his hand on the butt
of his revolver. The tarantula had not stirred more than an inch
since he was seen, but that was in the direction of the Texan’s
face, and his peril was becoming more imminent than before.</p>

<p>"Be careful, boys," said Strubell in his ordinary tones, "the
creature is getting nervous. He is now looking at me, and is coming
a little closer to my face. Don’t try to brush or knock him off:
maybe he’ll hunt for some other pasture, but the chances are against
it."</p>

<p>"All right, Ard," replied Lattin with assumed cheerfulness; "we
see your fix and are prayin’ for you. As I was sayin’, the sight
that met Jennings’ eyes, when he jumped out of his door, was enough
to set any man frantic. He was back into the house again, and
out once more like a flash. He had his Winchester with him this
time, and brought it to his shoulder, but the Apache that had
his little gal was on the watch and held her up in front, so that
the father couldn’t fire without killing his own child. So Jennings
just give one groan and staggered back into the house and almost
fell on to the floor.</p>

<p>"The poor fellow was in a bad fix. The nearest fort was a hundred
miles off, and it was almost as far to San Pedro. The two Apaches
had rode to the ranch on one pony, but, when they went away, the
one that didn’t have the little gal was on the back of Jennings’
horse, and, since his wife and escort was absent, there wasn’t
a single critter on the place.</p>

<p>"The first Apache had got so far off that he was beyond rifle-shot
before Jennings was outdoors. He come out a few minutes later,
and, shading his eyes, looked off across the dusty plain, where
his child had disappeared. He thought the horses which he seen
were growing plainer. They were coming toward him, and he didn’t
know what it meant.</p>

<p>"For a while he didn’t stir, but kept looking closely. Bimeby,
he seen there was but one horseman and he was Sam Ruggles, one
of them that had acted as the escort of Mrs. Jennings when she
went away. He was mounted on his own horse, and leading that of
Mrs. Jennings, who he said would start home the next day.</p>

<p>"‘The country is so open,’ said Sam, ‘that she thought I had
better start at once, so as to give you what help I could with
the cattle—what’s the matter, George?’ he asked, observing the
white face of his friend.</p>

<p>"‘Where did you get my horse?’ asked Jennings, striving hard
to control himself.</p>

<p>"‘Up near the ford,’ said Sam; ‘just as I stopped to let my pony
drink, someone fired at me from the bush, and I dropped out the
saddle to the ground. I wasn’t hurt a bit; it was a dodge of mine
to trick the redskin. The next instant, there was a whoop, and
an Apache galloped out of the bush toward me, sure of another
scalp. Wal,’ added Sam, with a grin, ‘an Apache can mistake, the
same as other folks, and I needn’t give you the partic’lars. Your
horse seemed to think he was at liberty to travel home, and he
went so fast that I didn’t overhaul him till about a mile out.
I was worried thinkin’ something had happened, and was glad enough
to see that everything was right.’ Now that was a big mistake
of Sam, wasn’t it?"</p>

<p>Nick and Herbert turned toward the speaker, as both answered
his odd question, and observed that he now held his revolver in
hand.</p>

<p>"Boys," called poor Strubell, "the tarantula is creeping toward
my face; I guess he means to bite; don’t stir, and if he gets
much closer I’ll make a sweep at him."</p>
