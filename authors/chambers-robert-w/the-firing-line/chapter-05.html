<p>Young Hamil, moving thoughtfully along through the gardens, caught
a glimpse of a group under the palms which halted him for an instant,
then brought him forward, hat off, hand cordially outstretched.</p>

<p>"Awf'lly glad to see you, Virginia; this is very jolly; hello,
Cuyp! How are you, Colonel Vetchen&mdash;oh! how do you do, Mr. Classon!"
as the latter came trotting down the path, twirling a limber walking-stick.</p>

<p>"How-dee-do! How-dee-do!" piped Courtlandt Classon, with a rickety
abandon almost paternal; and, replying literally, Hamil admitted
his excellent physical condition.</p>

<p>Virginia Suydam, reclining in her basket chair, very picturesque
in a broad hat, smiled at him out of her peculiar bluish-green
eyes, while Courtlandt Classon fussed and fussed and patted his
shoulder; an old beau who had toddled about Manhattan in the days
when the town was gay below Bleecker Street, when brownstone was
for the rich alone, when the family horses wore their tails long
and a proud Ethiope held the reins, when Saratoga was the goal
of fashion, and old General Jan Van-der-Duynck pronounced his
own name "Wonnerdink," with profane accompaniment.</p>

<p>They were all most affable &mdash;Van Tassel Cuyp with the automatic
nervous snicker that deepened the furrows from nostril to mouth,
a tall stoop-shouldered man of scant forty with the high colour,
long, nervous nose, and dull eye of Dutch descent; and Colonel
Augustus Magnelius Pietrus Vetchen, scion of an illustrious line
whose ancestors had been colonial governors and judges before
the British flag floated from the New Amsterdam fort. His daughter
was the celebrated beauty, Mrs. Tom O'Hara. She had married O'Hara
and so many incredible millions that people insisted that was
why Colonel Vetchen's eyebrows expressed the acute slant of perpetual
astonishment.</p>

<p>So they were all cordial, for was he not related to the late
General Garret Suydam and, therefore, distantly to them all? And
these men who took themselves and their lineage so seriously,
took Hamil seriously; and he often attempted to appreciate it
seriously, but his sense of humour was too strong. They were all
good people, kindly and harmless snobs; and when he had made his
adieux under the shadow of the white portico, he lingered a moment
to observe the obsolete gallantry with which Mr. Classon and Colonel
Vetchen wafted Virginia up the steps.</p>

<p>Cuyp lingered to venture a heavy pleasantry or two which distorted
his long nose into a series of white-ridged wrinkles, then he
ambled away and disappeared within the abode of that divinity
who shapes our ends, the manicure; and Hamil turned once more
toward the gardens.</p>

<p>The hour was still early; of course too unconventional to leave
cards on the Cardross family, even too early for a business visit;
but he thought he would stroll past the villa, the white walls
of which he had dimly seen the evening before. Besides his Calypso
was there. Alas! for Calypso. Yet his heart tuned up a trifle
as he thought of seeing her so soon again.</p>

<p>And so, a somewhat pensive but wholly attractive and self-confident
young opportunist in white flannels, he sauntered through the
hotel gardens and out along the dazzling shell-road.</p>

<p>No need for him to make inquiries of passing negroes; no need
to ask where the House of Cardross might be found; for although
he had seen it only by starlight, and the white sunshine now transformed
everything under its unfamiliar glare, he remembered his way,
étape by étape, from the foliated iron grille of Whitehall to
the ancient cannon bedded in rusting trunnions; and from that
mass of Spanish bronze, southward under the tall palms, past hedges
of vermilion hibiscus and perfumed oleander, past villa after
villa embowered in purple, white, and crimson flowering vines,
and far away inland along the snowy road until, at the turn, a
gigantic banyan tree sprawled across the sky and the lilac-odour
of china-berry in bloom stole subtly through the aromatic confusion,
pure, sweet, refreshing in all its exquisite integrity.</p>

<p>"Calypso's own fragrance," he thought to himself&mdash;remembering
the intimate perfume of her hair and gown as she passed so near
to him in the lantern light when he had spoken without discretion.</p>

<p>And suddenly the reminiscent humour faded from his eyes and mouth
as he remembered what his aunt had said of this young girl; and,
halting in his tracks, he recalled what she herself had said;
that the harmless liberties another girl might venture to take
with informality, armoured in an assurance above common convention,
she could not venture. And now he knew why.... She had expected
him to learn that she was an adopted daughter; in the light of
his new knowledge he understood that. No doubt it was generally
known. But the child had not expected him to know more than that;
and, her own knowledge of the hopeless truth, plainly enough,
was the key to that note of bitterness which he had detected at
times, and even spoken of&mdash;that curious maturity forced by unhappy
self-knowledge, that apathetic indifference stirred at moments
to a quick sensitive alertness almost resembling self-defence.
She was aware of her own story; that was certain. And the acid
of that knowledge was etching the designs of character upon a
physical adolescence unprepared for such biting reaction.</p>

<p>He was sorry he knew it, feeling ashamed of his own guiltless
invasion of the girl's privacy.</p>

<p>The only reparation possible was to forget it. Like an honourable
card-player who inadvertently sees his opponent's cards, he must
play his hand exactly as he would have in the beginning. And that,
he believed, would be perfectly simple.</p>

<p>Reassured he looked across the lawns toward the Cardross villa,
a big house of coquina cement, very beautiful in its pseudo-Spanish
architecture, red-tiled roofs, cool patias, arcades, and courts;
the formality of terrace, wall, and fountain charmingly disguised
under a riot of bloom and foliage.</p>

<p>The house stood farther away than he had imagined, for here the
public road ended abruptly in a winding hammock-trail, and to
the east the private drive of marl ran between high gates of wrought
iron swung wide between carved coquina pillars.</p>

<p>And the house itself was very much larger than he had imagined;
the starlight had illuminated only a small portion of its white
façade, tricking him; for this was almost a palace&mdash;one of those
fine vigorously designed mansions, so imposing in simplicity,
nicknamed by smug humility&mdash;a "cottage," or "villa."</p>

<p>"By jingo, it's noble!" he exclaimed, the exotic dignity of the
house dawning on him by degrees as he moved forward and the southern
ocean sprang into view, turquoise and amethyst inlaid streak on
streak to the still horizon.</p>

<p>"What a chance!" he repeated under his breath; "what a chance
for the noblest park ever softened into formality! And the untouched
forests beyond!&mdash;and the lagoons!&mdash;and the dunes to the east&mdash;and
the sea! Lord, Lord," he whispered with unconscious reverence,
"what an Eden!"</p>

<p>One of the white-haired, black-skinned children of men&mdash;though
the point is locally disputed&mdash;looked up from the grass where
he squatted gathering ripe fruit under a sapodilla tree; and to
an inquiry:</p>

<p>"Yaas-suh, yaas-suh; Mistuh Cahdhoss in de pomelo g'ove, suh,
feedin' mud-cat to de wile-puss."</p>

<p>"Doing <em>what</em>?"</p>

<p>"Feedin' mud-fish to de wile-cat, de wile lynx-cat, suh." The
aged negro rose, hat doffed, juicy traces of forbidden sapodillas
on his face which he naïvely removed with the back of the blackest
and most grotesquely wrinkled hand Hamil had ever seen.</p>

<p>"Yaas-suh; 'scusin' de 'gator, wile-cat love de mud-fish mostest;
yaas, suh. Ole torm-cat he fish de crick lak he was no 'count
Seminole trash&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment, uncle," interrupted Hamil, smiling; "is that the
pomelo grove? And is that gentleman yonder Mr. Cardross?"</p>

<p>"Yaas-suh."</p>

<p>He stood silent a moment thoughtfully watching the distant figure
through the vista of green leaves, white blossoms, and great clusters
of fruit hanging like globes of palest gold in the sun.</p>

<p>"I think," he said absently, "that I'll step over and speak to
Mr. Cardross.... Thank you, uncle.... What kind of fruit is that
you're gathering?"</p>

<p>"Sappydilla, suh."</p>

<p>Hamil laughed; he had heard that a darky would barter 'possum,
ham-bone, and soul immortal for a ripe sapodilla; he had also
once, much farther northward, seen the distressing spectacle of
Savannah negroes loading a freight car with watermelons; and it
struck him now that it was equally rash to commission this aged
uncle on any such business as the gathering of sapodillas for
family consumption.</p>

<p>The rolling, moist, and guileless eye of the old man whose slightly
pained expression made it plain that he divined exactly what Hamil
had been thinking, set the young man laughing outright.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, uncle," he said; "they're not my sapodillas"; and
he walked toward the pomelo grove, the old man, a picture of outraged
innocence, looking after him, thoughtlessly biting into an enormous
and juicy specimen of the forbidden fruit as he looked.</p>

<p>There was a high fence of woven wire around the grove; through
scented vistas, spotted with sunshine, fruit and blossoms hung
together amid tender foliage of glossy green; palms and palmettos
stood with broad drooping fronds here and there among the citrus
trees, and the brown woody litter which covered the ground was
all starred with fallen flowers.</p>

<p>The gate was open, and as Hamil stepped in he met a well-built,
active man in white flannels coming out; and both halted abruptly.</p>

<p>"I am looking for Mr. Cardross," said the younger man.</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Cardross."</p>

<p>Hamil nodded. "I mean that I am looking for Mr. Cardross, senior&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Cardross, senior."</p>

<p>Hamil gazed at this active gentleman who could scarcely be the
father of married children; and yet, as he looked, the crisp,
thick hair, the clear sun-bronzed skin which had misled him might
after all belong to that type of young-old men less common in
America than in England. And Hamil also realised that his hair
was silvered, not blond, and that neither the hands nor the eyes
of this man were the hands and eyes of youth.</p>

<p>"I am Garret Hamil," he said.</p>

<p>"I recognise you perfectly. I supposed you older&mdash;until my daughter
showed me your picture in the <em>News</em> two weeks ago!"</p>

<p>"I supposed <em>you</em> older&mdash;until this minute."</p>

<p>"I <em>am</em>!"</p>

<p>Looking squarely into each other's faces they laughed and shook
hands.</p>

<p>"When did you come, Mr. Hamil?"</p>

<p>"Last night from Nassau."</p>

<p>"Where are you stopping?"</p>

<p>Hamil told him.</p>

<p>"Your rooms are ready here. It's very good of you to come to
see me at once&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's very good of you to want me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Want you, man alive! Of course I want you! I'm all on edge over
this landscape scheme; I've done nothing since we arrived from
the North but ride over and over the place&mdash;and I've not half
covered it yet. That's the way we'll begin work, isn't it? Knock
about together and get a general idea of the country; isn't that
the best way?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought so. The way to learn a country is to ride over it,
fish over it, shoot over it, sail around it, camp in it&mdash;that's
my notion of thoroughly understanding a region. If you're going
to improve it you've got to care something about it&mdash;begin to
like it&mdash;find pleasure in it, understand it. Isn't that true,
Mr. Hamil?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;in a measure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course it's true," repeated Cardross with his quick engaging
laugh; "if a man doesn't care for a thing he's not fitted to alter
or modify it. I've often thought that those old French landscape
men must have dearly loved the country they made so beautiful&mdash;loved
it intelligently&mdash;for they left so much wild beauty edging the
formality of their creations. Do you happen to remember the Chasse
at Versailles? And that's what I want here! You don't mind my
instructing you in your own profession, do you?"</p>

<p>They both laughed again, apparently qualified to understand one
another.</p>

<p>Cardross said: "I'm glad you're young; I'm glad you've come.
This is going to be the pleasantest winter of my life. There isn't
anything I'd rather do than just this kind of thing&mdash;if you'll
let me tag after you and talk about it. You don't mind, do you?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," said Hamil sincerely.</p>

<p>"We'll probably have rows," suggested Cardross; "I may want vistas
and terraces and fountains where they ought not to be."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you won't," replied Hamil, laughing; "you'll understand
things when I give reasons."</p>

<p>"That's what I want&mdash;reasons. If anybody would only give me reasons!&mdash;but
nobody does. Listen; will you come up to the house with me and
meet my family? And then you'll lunch with them &mdash;I've a
business luncheon at the club&mdash;unfortunately&mdash;but I'll come back.
Meanwhile there'll be somebody to show you about, or you can run
out to the Inlet in one of the motor-boats if you like, or do
anything you like that may amuse you; the main thing is for you
to be amused, to find this place agreeable, to like this kind
of country, to like us. <em>Then</em> you can do good work, Mr.
Hamil."</p>

<p>A grinning negro shuffled up and closed the gate as they left
the grove together and started across the lawn. Cardross, cordial
in his quick, vigorous manner, strolled with his hands in his
coat pockets, planting each white-shod foot firmly as he walked,
frequently turning head and shoulders squarely toward his companion
when speaking.</p>

<p>He must have been over fifty; he did not appear forty; still,
on closer and more detailed inspection Hamil understood how much
his alert, well-made figure had to do with the first impression
of youth. Yet his expression had nothing in it of that shadow
which falls with years&mdash;nothing to show to the world that he had
once taken the world by the throat and wrung a fortune out of
it&mdash;nothing of the hard gravity or the underlying sadness of almost
ruthless success, and the responsibility for it.</p>

<p>Yet, from the first, Hamil had been aware of all that was behind
this unstudied frankness, this friendly vigour. There was a man,
there&mdash;every inch a man, but exactly of what sort the younger
man had not yet decided.</p>

<p>A faded and very stout lady, gowned with elaborate simplicity,
yet somehow suggesting well-bred untidiness, rolled toward them,
propelled in a wheeled-chair by a black servant.</p>

<p>"Dear," said Mr. Cardross, "this is Mr. Hamil." And Mrs. Cardross
offered him her chubby hand and said a little more than he expected.
Then, to her husband, languidly:</p>

<p>"They're playing tennis, Neville. If Mr. Hamil would care to
play there are tennis-shoes belonging to Gray and Acton."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Cardross," said Hamil, "but, as a matter of
fact, I am not yet acclimated."</p>

<p>"You feel a little sleepy?" drawled Mrs. Cardross, maternally
solicitous; "everybody does for the first few days." And to her
husband: "Jessie and Cecile are playing; Shiela must be somewhere
about &mdash;You will lunch with us, Mr. Hamil? There's to be
a tennis luncheon under the oaks&mdash;we'd really like to have you
if you can stay."</p>

<p>Hamil accepted as simply as the invitation was given; Mrs. Cardross
exchanged a few words with her husband in that perfectly natural
drawl which at first might have been mistaken for languid affectation;
then she smiled at Hamil and turned around in her basket chair,
parasol tilted, and the black boy began slowly pedalling her away
across the lawn.</p>

<p>"We'll step over to the tennis-courts," said Cardross, replacing
the straw hat which he had removed to salute his wife; "they're
having a sort of scratch-tournament I believe&mdash;my daughters and
some other young people. I think you'll find the courts rather
pretty."</p>

<p>The grounds were certainly quaint; spaces for four white marl
courts had been cleared, hewn out of the solid jungle which walled
them in with a noble living growth of live oak, cedar, magnolia,
and palmetto. And on these courts a very gay company of young
people in white were playing or applauding the players while the
snowy balls flew across the nets and the resonant blows of the
bats rang out.</p>

<p>And first Mr. Cardross presented Hamil to his handsome married
daughter, Mrs. Acton Carrick, a jolly, freckled, young matron
who showed her teeth when she smiled and shook hands like her
father; and then he was made known to the youngest daughter, Cecile
Cardross, small, plump, and sun-tanned, with ruddy hair and mischief
in every feature.</p>

<p>There was, also, a willowy Miss Staines and a blond Miss Anan,
and a very young Mr. Anan&mdash;a brother&mdash;and a grave and gaunt Mr.
Gatewood and a stout Mr. Ellison, and a number of others less
easy to remember.</p>

<p>"This wholesale introduction business is always perplexing,"
observed Cardross; "but they'll all remember you, and after a
time you'll begin to distinguish them from the shrubbery. No"&mdash;as
Mrs. Carrick asked Hamil if he cared to play&mdash;"he would rather
look on this time, Jessie. Go ahead; we are not interrupting you;
where is Shiela&mdash;"</p>

<p>And Hamil, chancing to turn, saw her, tennis-bat tucked under
one bare arm, emerging from the jungle path; and at the same instant
she caught sight of him. Both little chalked shoes stood stockstill&mdash;for
a second only&mdash;then she came forward, leisurely, continuing to
eat the ripe guava with which she had been occupied.</p>

<p>Cardross, advancing, said: "This is Mr. Hamil, dearest; and,"
to the young man: "My daughter Shiela."</p>

<p>She nodded politely.</p>

<p>"Now I've got to go, Shiela," continued Cardross. "Hamil, you'll
amuse yourself, won't you, until I return after luncheon? Shiela,
Mr. Hamil doesn't care to play tennis; so if you'll find out what
he does care to do&mdash;" He saluted the young people gaily and started
across the lawn where a very black boy with a chair stood ready
to convey him to the village and across the railroad tracks to
that demure little flower-embowered cottage the interior of which
presents such an amazing contrast to the exterior.</p>
