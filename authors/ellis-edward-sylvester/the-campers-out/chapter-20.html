<p>Dick Halliard caught the gleam of the pistol in the hands of
the enraged Bob Budd, but before he could bring it into play the
younger lifted up his bicycle, ran it swiftly a few paces, sprang
up behind, and set his legs to work with desperate energy.</p>

<p>As he did so he remembered he was still in danger. He leaned
as far ahead as he could, like a frontier scout trying to avoid
the shots of a party of Indians. It was well he took the precaution,
for Bob was so beside himself with wrath that he deliberately
pointed the weapon at the fast-disappearing fugitive, and let
fly with three chambers as fast as he could discharge them. It
was not his fault that the bullets sped wide of the mark, for
he tried hard to hit the lad that had handled him so roughly.</p>

<p>Dick glanced over his shoulder, and as he caught sight of the
dim figure in the moonlight he said, with a smile:</p>

<p>"Bob wouldn’t have used his pistol if he wasn’t beside himself
with rage; any way, I think he and the rest of them will let me
alone after this."</p>

<p>Bob Budd stood a full minute after the bicyclist vanished in
the gloom. By that time his anger gave way to a feeling of alarm,
as he reflected on what he had done, or rather tried to do.</p>

<p>He had stopped Dick Halliard on the highway; he had attacked
him without cause, and when he was fleeing had discharged his
pistol at him, doing so with the intention of hitting him with
each cartridge. If Dick chose to prosecute him, what could keep
him out of State prison?</p>

<p>The thought was a startling one, and did not contribute to the
Ranger’s comfort as he picked his way homeward, where, after a
time, he was joined by Jim McGovern, returning from his equally
marked failure to "even up" matters with Dick Halliard.</p>

<p>You may be certain that neither Bob nor Jim had anything truthful
to tell about their meeting with the young man. McGovern stated
that he lost his way, and, finding the hour was so late, decided
to put off his revenge until a more favorable time. He took care
to keep the marks of Bowser’s teeth from the sight of the others,
and he was therefore vexed by no annoying questions.</p>

<p>Bob explained that he had been looking for Dick Halliard, and
wondered that he did not meet him. The news given by his brother
Rangers showed that the doomed youth was elsewhere that evening,
which, the bully added, was mighty lucky for him.</p>

<p>When Wagstaff commented on the bruised appearance of Bob’s face,
he replied that he ran against the trunk of a tree in the woods,
and then he hastened to change the conversation.</p>

<p>"To-morrow we shall have our hunt, boys," he said, with glowing
face, "and here’s success to it!"</p>

<p>The others eagerly joined in the toast, for the reason that they
never refused to join in any toast presented.</p>

<p>"You think we’re going to have good weather?" remarked Tom.</p>

<p>"There’s no doubt of it. I asked old Swipes, Carter, and the
prophets, and they all agree that the weather will be prime for
several days to come."</p>

<p>"If that’s to be the case, the best thing for us to do is to
sleep while we can, so as to be up early in the morning."</p>

<p>The suggestion was so eminently wise that it was adopted without
further delay.</p>

<p>The following morning was one after a hunter’s own heart. The
air was crisp and cool, but not sufficiently so to be chilly,
nor was it mild enough to render oppressive the slight exertion
of walking.</p>

<p>It was too early in the autumn for many of the leaves to fall
from the trees, so that in most places a hunter could see but
a short distance in advance when picking his way through the woods.</p>

<p>The Piketon Rangers were not accustomed to rise with the sun,
and having retired quite late the preceding night, did not rouse
themselves as early as was their intention. But their minds were
so fixed on the expected enjoyment of the hunt that they willingly
put forth the extra exertion needed.</p>

<p>They were in high spirits, for everything was promising, and
the bracing air produced its effect upon them.</p>

<p>"I don’t think there will be any need of our pistols," remarked
Wagstaff, doubtingly, when they were ready to start.</p>

<p>"I generally carry mine at all times," replied Bob Budd, "but
we have got to do some mountain climbing, and will be likely to
find them in the way. I guess we had better leave them."</p>

<p>This settled the question, and the three smaller weapons were
hidden within the tent, in a hollow which Bob’s ingenuity had
fashioned, and where the valuables were not likely to be found
by any prowlers in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>The rifles which Jim and Tom had brought from home were left
at Bob’s house, and he furnished each with a double-barreled shot
gun, as the kind of weapon most likely to be needed, though it
seemed to the city youths that the others were just what was wanted
in the event of meeting bears or deer. They had cause to regret
their choice sooner than they anticipated.</p>

<p>Not the least enthusiastic member of the party was Bob Budd’s
hound Hero, that had all a trained animal’s enjoyment of the hunt,
and who received so few chances of taking part in the sport that
his appetite was at the keenest point.</p>

<p>He darted ahead of the campers, running at his highest speed
for a half-mile in sheer wantonness of spirits, then darting off
at right angles, and finally trotting back to his friends, as
if wondering why they did not make greater haste.</p>

<p>Several times his baying roused the belief on the part of Jim
and Tom that he had struck the trail of some animal, but Bob,
who had been out with him before, shook his head.</p>

<p>"He lets out a peculiar cry when he takes the scent; I’ll know
it the minute I hear it."</p>

<p>"But what makes him yelp <em>now</em>, when there isn’t any game?"
asked Jim.</p>

<p>"Because he can’t help it, just as we sing and shout when we
feel happy and merry."</p>

<p>"There he goes! <em>That</em> means something!" exclaimed Tom,
coming to an abrupt halt to listen to the baying of the hound,
a considerable distance ahead.</p>

<p>But Bob again shook his head.</p>

<p>"Wild animals aint so plenty that they can be scared up as quick
as all that; we must get further up the mountain before we can
look for anything worth shooting."</p>

<p>When Bob was a small boy he had accompanied his uncle on several
hunting expeditions in this part of the world, and he held a bright
recollection of the occasion.</p>

<p>Many years before deer and bears had been plentiful, and he remembered
that his uncle described how the hunt for a deer should be managed
among the mountainous section to the rear of their camp.</p>

<p>That knowledge promised to be of great help to Bob, now that,
after the lapse of so long a time, he had started to hunt over
the same ground.</p>

<p>The course of the party was steadily ascending, and since there
were many rocks and considerable tangled undergrowth in their
way, it was not long before they felt the result of the unusual
exertion.</p>

<p>"Great Cæsar!" exclaimed Tom Wagstaff, dropping down on a log
and panting hard; "this is like a good many other things which
don’t give half as much fun as we expect. Bob, where’s that flask?"</p>

<p>The others were also glad to sit down for a brief rest, and Bob
lost no time in producing the required article, which was applied
to the lips of each in turn with the bottom pointed toward the
sky, and a part of the fiery contents gurgled down their throats.</p>

<p>"Of course it’s tiresome, because it’s all the way up up-hill,"
said Bob, who took of his hat and fanned his flushed face; "but
we’ll soon get as high as we want to go, and then it’ll be plain
sailing."</p>

<p>"It’s easy enough to come down-hill, provided it aint too steep."</p>

<p>"If it gets that way, all a fellow has to do is to lie down and
roll," said Bob; "but I’m hopeful that Hero will start some animal
before we go much further."</p>

<p>The three listened, but though the hound was absent nothing was
heard from him. He evidently was making a "still hunt," but the
moment he struck a scent he was sure to let the young hunters
know.</p>

<p>Whether or not they did their part, there could be no doubt that
the canine would perform his in a creditable manner, for he had
been trained by competent hands that fully understood how to teach
so sagacious an animal.</p>

<p>Having rested themselves, the party pushed up the mountain-side,
until they reached a sort of plateau or table-land, beyond which
it was not necessary to climb further.</p>

<p>By this time the three were pretty well tired out again, and
once more an appeal was made to the stuff in the flask, without
which the hunters felt they could not get along.</p>

<p>Then they indulged in several cigarettes apiece, that and the
drink of alcohol being the worst preparation possible for the
sport in which they were engaged.</p>

<p>"Now," said Bob Budd, "we have only to wait here until Hero starts
the game for us."</p>

<p>"Will it come up in front of us to be shot?" was the natural
inquiry of Tom Wagstaff.</p>

<p>"I shouldn’t have said that ‘we’ are to wait here, but one of
us," Bob hastened to explain. "You’ve noticed that we have been
following a path all the way to this point. Well, it keeps on
over the mountain and down the other side."</p>

<p>"Who made the path?"</p>

<p>"It is a hundred years old, if not older, and was made by wild
animals that came down the mountain to drink from the stream that
makes the mill-pond near our camp. The path branches off into
three forks a quarter of a mile up the mountain, each of the three
having been used by deer, bears, and other wild beasts that used
to be so plentiful in these parts."</p>

<p>"Where are the other paths?"</p>

<p>"This is the middle one; about two hundred yards to the left
is the second, and not quite so far to the right is the third;
now, if Hero starts any game he is sure to take one of these paths
in his flight."</p>

<p>"But suppose the animal is on the other side of Hero," said Jim,
"that is to say, suppose the dog is between us and him?"</p>

<p>"Then he will run the other way, but there’s where Hero will
show his training. He knows as much about hunting as we do."</p>

<p>If Bob had said that the canine knew a great deal more he would
have told the truth.</p>

<p>"If Hero should strike the scent of a deer or bear he would know
in a minute whether he was closer to us than the game, and if
the dog was the closer, he would not bay until he had circled
around and got on the other side, for he knows that if he didn’t
do so the beast would run <em>away</em> instead of <em>toward</em>
us, and his business is to drive him down within our reach."</p>

<p>Tom and Jim were filled with admiration of the brute, whose knowledge
of sporting matters was so extensive.</p>

<p>"I had no idea a pup could be trained to such a fine point,"
remarked Jim, "but I suppose it is the nature of the beast."</p>

<p>"When I was a sweet, innocent little boy," said Bob, disposed
to be facetious, "I came up here with my father and Uncle Jim
to hunt deer. They left me at this spot while father went to the
left and Uncle Jim to the right. I was too small to handle a gun,
and they told me if I saw anything to yell. Well, a very queer
thing happened. A buck and doe were started, and the old fellow
came trotting over this path. He never saw me until I let out
a yell like a wild-cat, when he wheeled off to one side and dashed
through the wood to where father was waiting. He was shot without
trouble, and at the same moment Uncle Jim brought down the doe,
that took the other path."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose there is any likelihood of Hero starting two
to-day?"</p>

<p>"We will be lucky if he starts one, for the animals are very
scarce, and hunters have spent several days roaming over the mountains
without getting a shot."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that to make sure of our sport we should station
ourselves as you did," said Jim; "then if the animal comes down
this side of the mountain, he will be sure to take one of the
three paths, and Tom or you or I will get a shot at him."</p>

<p>"It will be time enough when we hear Hero," replied Bob, "for
he aint likely to start a deer very near us."</p>

<p>The young man’s knowledge of the sport was so much superior to
that of his companions that they naturally deferred to him in
the preliminary arrangements.</p>

<p>"How long ago was it that you had that famous hunt with your
father and uncle?" asked Jim McGovern.</p>

<p>Bob reflected a minute, and replied that it was ten years, if
not more.</p>

<p>"You can see that I was but a sprig of a youngster, though I
was considered unusually smart. If they had given me a gun, and
I had had a chance to kneel down and aim over the rocks, I would
have brought down that buck, for he couldn’t have offered a better
target than at the moment I scared him away."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose," asked Tom Wagstaff, "that any deer have been
over these paths within the past few weeks or months?"</p>

<p>By way of reply Bob stooped down and brushed away the leaves
covering the space of several feet in front, doing it with great
care.</p>

<p>"Look!" said he to the others, who kneeled beside him.</p>

<p>There, sure enough, were the imprints of the small, delicate
hoofs of a deer, the marks being so distinct that there could
be no mistake about their identity.</p>

<p>"But they are under the leaves," said Jim.</p>

<p>"Yes; under the leaves that have fallen this year, but on top
of those that fell last fall; you can see how the rotten leaves
have been pushed down in the ground by the hoofs."</p>

<p>"Then how long since the deer went by?"</p>

<p>"It is so early in the autumn that few leaves have fallen, so
I’m satisfied the game passed within a few days, probably not
more than a week ago."</p>

<p>"If <em>that’s</em> the case," said the gratified Jim, "there
is a much better chance than I suspected for us—"</p>

<p>"<em>Hark!</em>"</p>

<p>The peculiar cry of the hound at that moment rang out on the
autumn air sharp, clear, and distinct.</p>

<p>"He has struck a scent as sure as you’re born!" exclaimed Bob.</p>
