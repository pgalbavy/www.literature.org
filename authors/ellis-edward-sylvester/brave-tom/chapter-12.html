<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>For two weeks Tom Gordon prosecuted his vocation as a newsboy
in the city of New York, by which time he had gained enough experience
to earn his daily bread, but nothing beyond that. Such being the
case, he felt that he was not making a success of his calling,
as there was no reserve fund upon which to draw for clothing or
other necessities.</p>

<p>The greater portion of a month wore by, during which he never
gained the slightest knowledge of the fate of Jim Travers.</p>

<p>Tom went to the morgue, and applied to the police, and, in fact,
used every means at his command to learn something. He occasionally
encountered his friend Patsey, who rendered all the assistance
he could, but it availed nothing.</p>

<p>When the fortnight was up, Tom received an unexpected offer,
that the Irishman, through some acquaintance, secured for him.
It was the opportunity to sell newspapers and periodicals on the
Hudson River Railroad. He was to leave New York in the morning,
"working the train" on the way up to Albany, and come down again
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>This was such a big advance on what he had been doing, that he
joyfully accepted the offer, even though he held not the slightest
intention of following it as a continuous occupation. It would
do very well until he could obtain something more suitable.</p>

<p>The lad found at the end of the first week that he was much better
off than he anticipated. The privilege was conceded to him of
charging double the price for the papers which was asked on the
streets or at the news-stands, and his percentage of profits was
very large.</p>

<p>Tom held his position for a couple of months to the satisfaction
of his employer, and he had accumulated quite a sum, which was
deposited in a savings-bank that wasn't likely to "suspend" for
the benefit of the officers.</p>

<p>Spring had opened, the Hudson was clear of ice, and his business
became quite agreeable.</p>

<p>It happened that he encountered, on several occasions, some of
his former friends of Briggsville, who could not conceal their
surprise at seeing him engaged in selling newspapers.</p>

<p>Tom could not always keep back the flush that stole over his
handsome face at such times. But he began to believe there was
a nobility in honest labor like his, of which he had no right
to feel ashamed.</p>

<p>There were any number of young fellows who envied him his position,
and who were ready to use all sorts of artifices to have him "bounced."
Slanderous reports were carried to his employers, who took measures
to investigate them, reaching the conclusion that Tom was without
a superior in the way of integrity, politeness, and faithfulness.</p>

<p>The tiny gold chain and locket obtained from the drowning girl
in so singular a manner, he preserved with a religious devotion.
It was deposited in the savings-bank, beyond all danger of loss,
and he would have starved to death before consenting to part with
it.</p>

<p>The sweet face within the locket was as vividly fixed in his
memory as if the original were a sister of his, and he never passed
through the train without looking around, in the hope of seeing
the little girl herself.</p>

<p>The only sister which Tom had ever had died in infancy, and there
was something which linked the memory of the two in the tenderest
and most sacred manner.</p>

<p>There were true modesty and manhood in the noble fellow, when
he overheard a visitor in his employer's office relate the incident
of the rescue, without suspecting that the hero stood before him,
and never dropped the slightest intimation that he knew anything
about it.</p>

<p>One bright spring morning Tom was passing through the smoking-car,
when a young man, very flashily dressed, whistled to him, and
asked for a copy of a sporting paper.</p>

<p>Tom had but a single copy left. This he tossed over into the
lap of the applicant in that careless, off-hand style which characterizes
the veteran newsboy.</p>

<p>The purchaser passed over a quarter in coin, and as Tom pulled
out a handful of silver from his pocket, from which to select
the change, the flashy young man said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never mind, sonny; I'll make you a present of that."</p>

<p>"But you have given me five times the price of the paper," said
Tom, thinking there was an error.</p>

<p>"That's all right. When I see a fellow of your style I like to
encourage him."</p>

<p>Tom thanked him and passed on.</p>

<p>The incident would not be worth recording but for the fact that
it was repeated the next day, when the same young man bought a
<em>Herald</em>, and compelled the lad to accept a bright silver
quarter in payment, without allowing him to give any change.</p>

<p>Six times on successive days was this done, and then the liberal
purchaser disappeared from the train.</p>

<p>Aside from the repetition of his favors, it was rather curious
that on each occasion he should have placed a silver quarter in
the palm of Tom.</p>

<p>Each coin was of the same date as that year, and was so bright
and shiny that Tom believed they must have come directly from
the mint. They looked so handsome, indeed, that he determined
to keep them as pocket-pieces, instead of giving them out in change.</p>

<p>There is nothing like actual experience to sharpen a fellow's
wits; and, on the first day the munificent stranger vanished,
a dim suspicion entered the head of Tom that some mischief was
brewing.</p>

<p>That night in New York he examined the coins more minutely than
heretofore. Half an hour later he walked down to the wharf and
threw them into the river.</p>

<p>The whole six were counterfeit. It wasn't safe for any one to
carry such property about him.</p>

<p>Tom was strongly convinced, further, that a job was being "put
up" on him, and he was mightily relieved when thoroughly rid of
them.</p>

<p>That same evening one of his employers sent for him, and told
him that he had received reliable information that he, Thomas
Gordon, was working off counterfeit money on the road.</p>

<p>The boy denied it, of course, but he did not choose to tell all
he knew, for he saw that his own situation was a dangerous one;
but he demanded that the proof should be produced.</p>

<p>There was an officer present, who thereupon searched the lad
for the "queer," but he acknowledged there wasn't a penny on him
which was not sound.</p>

<p>Tom was kept at the office while another officer went to his
lodging-house and ransacked his room. The result was <em>nil</em>.
This rather stumped the detective, who was acting on the charge
of some one else, and he started off, remarking that the business
wasn't done yet, and the best thing the boy could do was to confess.</p>

<p>"I must first have something to confess," replied Tom, who was
excusable for some honest indignation.</p>

<p>"Where is the man who said I was in <em>that</em> business?"</p>

<p>"You'll meet him in the court-room," was the significant reply
of the detective.</p>

<p>"That's just where I'd like to meet him, and you too, but you're
afraid to try it."</p>

<p>"Come, come, young man, you'd better keep a civil tongue in your
head, or I'll jug you as it is. I've enough against you."</p>

<p>"Why don't you do it, then?" was Tom's defiant question; "I've
learned enough during the last few minutes to understand my rights,
and if you think I don't, now's the time to test it."</p>

<p>The officer went out muttering all sorts of things; and Tom,
turning to his employer, his breast heaving with indignation,
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"They have been plotting against me ever since I've been on the
road. They went with all kinds of stories to you, and now they've
been trying to make it appear that I am in the counterfeit business."</p>

<p>"But there must have been something tangible, or that detective
would not have come here with the charge."</p>

<p>"There was something;" and thereupon Tom told the story of the
six shining quarters.</p>

<p>His employer was angered, for he saw through it all; and from
the description of the donor, he recognized a worthless scamp
who had been discharged for stealing some time before Tom went
on the route. The detective was sent for, and the case laid before
him. That night Mr. Dick Horton, who made the charge, was arrested,
and in his rooms were found such proofs against him as a counterfeiter
that, a few months later, he went to Sing Sing for ten years.</p>

<p>For a time succeeding this incident Tom was left undisturbed
in the pursuit of his business, the occurrence becoming pretty
generally known and causing much sympathy for him.</p>

<p>It was about a month subsequent that Tom missed his afternoon
train down the river, and took another, which left later, not
reaching New York till late at night.</p>

<p>[Illustration: It was a fierce drive.]</p>

<p>As there was nothing for him to do, the train being in the hands
of another newsboy, he sat down in the smoking-car, which was
only moderately filled. Directly in front was a man who, he judged
from his dress, was a Texan drover, or some returning Californian
He was leaning back in the corner of his seat, with his mouth
open and his eyes shut, in a way to suggest that he was asleep.</p>

<p>Seated next him was an individual who looked very much like the
Italian who had shoved his head into the door of Tom's room some
months before. This foreigner was watching the Californian&mdash;if
such he was&mdash;as a cat watches a mouse.</p>

<p>"I believe he means to rob him," was Tom's conclusion, who, without
being suspected by the scoundrel, was taking mental notes of the
whole proceeding.</p>

<p>The supposition was confirmed within five minutes, when the Italian,
leaning over toward the other, in an apparently careless manner,
began cautiously inserting his hand into his watch-pocket.</p>

<p>The instant Tom saw this, he bent forward and shook the Californian's
shoulder so vigorously that he started up, and demanded in a gruff
voice what was the matter. The Italian, of course, had withdrawn
his hand like a flash, and was leaning the other way, with his
eyes half-closed, like one sinking into a doze.</p>

<p>"I saw that man there," said Tom, pointing to the Italian, "with
his hand in your pocket, about to steal your watch, and I thought
I'd best let you know."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" demanded the stranger, a giant in stature, as he
laid his immense hand on the shoulder of the other, who started
up as if just aroused from sleep, and protested in broken English
that he was not aware of being seated with the gentleman at all.</p>

<p>His vehement declarations seemed to raise a doubt in the mind
of the Californian, who began an examination of his pockets. He
found everything right, and so declared.</p>

<p>"He was just beginning operations," said Tom in explanation,
"when I woke you."</p>

<p>"Bein' as he ain't took nothin', I won't knock the head off him,"
said the Californian, as he announced himself to be; "but he ain't
any business to look so much like a sneaking dog, so I'll punch
him on general principles."</p>

<p>Whereupon he gave the fellow such a resounding cuff that he flopped
out of the seat, and, scrambling to his feet, hurried out of the
car.</p>

<p>The Californian thanked Tom, and then resumed his nap.</p>

<p>In half an hour Tom found the tobacco-smoke so oppressive that
he rose to go into the next car. On the platform stood the discomfited
Italian, who seemed to be waiting for revenge.</p>

<p>"You lie of me," he muttered, before Tom suspected his danger.
"I show you."</p>

<p>With a quick push he gave the lad a violent shove, thrusting
him entirely off the platform and out upon the ground, fortunately
clear of the rushing wheels.</p>
