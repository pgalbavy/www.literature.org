<p>Mr. Bodiham was sitting in his study at the Rectory. The nineteenth-century
Gothic windows, narrow and pointed, admitted the light grudgingly;
in spite of the brilliant July weather, the room was sombre. Brown
varnished bookshelves lined the walls, filled with row upon row
of those thick, heavy theological works which the second-hand
booksellers generally sell by weight. The mantelpiece, the over-mantel,
a towering structure of spindly pillars and little shelves, were
brown and varnished. The writing-desk was brown and varnished.
So were the chairs, so was the door. A dark red-brown carpet with
patterns covered the floor. Everything was brown in the room,
and there was a curious brownish smell.</p>

<p>In the midst of this brown gloom Mr. Bodiham sat at his desk.
He was the man in the Iron Mask. A grey metallic face with iron
cheek-bones and a narrow iron brow; iron folds, hard and unchanging,
ran perpendicularly down his cheeks; his nose was the iron beak
of some thin, delicate bird of rapine. He had brown eyes, set
in sockets rimmed with iron; round them the skin was dark, as
though it had been charred. Dense wiry hair covered his skull;
it had been black, it was turning grey. His ears were very small
and fine. His jaws, his chin, his upper lip were dark, iron-dark,
where he had shaved. His voice, when he spoke and especially when
he raised it in preaching, was harsh, like the grating of iron
hinges when a seldom-used door is opened.</p>

<p>It was nearly half-past twelve. He had just come back from church,
hoarse and weary with preaching. He preached with fury, with passion,
an iron man beating with a flail upon the souls of his congregation.
But the souls of the faithful at Crome were made of india-rubber,
solid rubber; the flail rebounded. They were used to Mr. Bodiham
at Crome. The flail thumped on india-rubber, and as often as not
the rubber slept.</p>

<p>That morning he had preached, as he had often preached before,
on the nature of God. He had tried to make them understand about
God, what a fearful thing it was to fall into His hands. God&mdash;they
thought of something soft and merciful. They blinded themselves
to facts; still more, they blinded themselves to the Bible. The
passengers on the "Titanic" sang "Nearer my God to Thee" as the
ship was going down. Did they realise what they were asking to
be brought nearer to? A white fire of righteousness, an angry
fire...</p>

<p>When Savonarola preached, men sobbed and groaned aloud. Nothing
broke the polite silence with which Crome listened to Mr. Bodiham&mdash;only
an occasional cough and sometimes the sound of heavy breathing.
In the front pew sat Henry Wimbush, calm, well-bred, beautifully
dressed. There were times when Mr. Bodiham wanted to jump down
from the pulpit and shake him into life,&mdash;times when he would
have liked to beat and kill his whole congregation.</p>

<p>He sat at his desk dejectedly. Outside the Gothic windows the
earth was warm and marvellously calm. Everything was as it had
always been. And yet, and yet...It was nearly four years now since
he had preached that sermon on Matthew xxiv. 7: "For nation shall
rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there
shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers
places." It was nearly four years. He had had the sermon printed;
it was so terribly, so vitally important that all the world should
know what he had to say. A copy of the little pamphlet lay on
his desk&mdash;eight small grey pages, printed by a fount of type that
had grown blunt, like an old dog’s teeth, by the endless champing
and champing of the press. He opened it and began to read it yet
once again.</p>

<p>"‘For nation shall rise up against nation, and kingdom against
kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes,
in divers places.’</p>

<p>"Nineteen centuries have elapsed since Our Lord gave utterance
to those words, and not a single one of them has been without
wars, plagues, famines, and earthquakes. Mighty empires have crashed
in ruin to the ground, diseases have unpeopled half the globe,
there have been vast natural cataclysms in which thousands have
been overwhelmed by flood and fire and whirlwind. Time and again,
in the course of these nineteen centuries, such things have happened,
but they have not brought Christ back to earth. They were ‘signs
of the times’ inasmuch as they were signs of God’s wrath against
the chronic wickedness of mankind, but they were not signs of
the times in connection with the Second Coming.</p>

<p>"If earnest Christians have regarded the present war as a true
sign of the Lord’s approaching return, it is not merely because
it happens to be a great war involving the lives of millions of
people, not merely because famine is tightening its grip on every
country in Europe, not merely because disease of every kind, from
syphilis to spotted fever, is rife among the warring nations;
no, it is not for these reasons that we regard this war as a true
Sign of the Times, but because in its origin and its progress
it is marked by certain characteristics which seem to connect
it almost beyond a doubt with the predictions in Christian Prophecy
relating to the Second Coming of the Lord.</p>

<p>"Let me enumerate the features of the present war which most
clearly suggest that it is a Sign foretelling the near approach
of the Second Advent. Our Lord said that ‘this Gospel of the Kingdom
shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations;
and then shall the end come.’ Although it would be presumptuous
for us to say what degree of evangelisation will be regarded by
God as sufficient, we may at least confidently hope that a century
of unflagging missionary work has brought the fulfilment of this
condition at any rate near. True, the larger number of the world’s
inhabitants have remained deaf to the preaching of the true religion;
but that does not vitiate the fact that the Gospel <em>HAS </em>been
preached ‘for a witness’ to all unbelievers from the Papist to
the Zulu. The responsibility for the continued prevalence of unbelief
lies, not with the preachers, but with those preached to.</p>

<p>"Again, it has been generally recognised that ‘the drying up
of the waters of the great river Euphrates,’ mentioned in the
sixteenth chapter of Revelation, refers to the decay and extinction
of Turkish power, and is a sign of the near approaching end of
the world as we know it. The capture of Jerusalem and the successes
in Mesopotamia are great strides forward in the destruction of
the Ottoman Empire; though it must be admitted that the Gallipoli
episode proved that the Turk still possesses a ‘notable horn’
of strength. Historically speaking, this drying up of Ottoman
power has been going on for the past century; the last two years
have witnessed a great acceleration of the process, and there
can be no doubt that complete desiccation is within sight.</p>

<p>"Closely following on the words concerning the drying up of Euphrates
comes the prophecy of Armageddon, that world war with which the
Second Coming is to be so closely associated. Once begun, the
world war can end only with the return of Christ, and His coming
will be sudden and unexpected, like that of a thief in the night.</p>

<p>"Let us examine the facts. In history, exactly as in St. John’s
Gospel, the world war is immediately preceded by the drying up
of Euphrates, or the decay of Turkish power. This fact alone would
be enough to connect the present conflict with the Armageddon
of Revelation and therefore to point to the near approach of the
Second Advent. But further evidence of an even more solid and
convincing nature can be adduced.</p>

<p>"Armageddon is brought about by the activities of three unclean
spirits, as it were toads, which come out of the mouths of the
Dragon, the Beast, and the False Prophet. If we can identify these
three powers of evil much light will clearly be thrown on the
whole question.</p>

<p>"The Dragon, the Beast, and the False Prophet can all be identified
in history. Satan, who can only work through human agency, has
used these three powers in the long war against Christ which has
filled the last nineteen centuries with religious strife. The
Dragon, it has been sufficiently established, is pagan Rome, and
the spirit issuing from its mouth is the spirit of Infidelity.
The Beast, alternatively symbolised as a Woman, is undoubtedly
the Papal power, and Popery is the spirit which it spews forth.
There is only one power which answers to the description of the
False Prophet, the wolf in sheep’s clothing, the agent of the
devil working in the guise of the Lamb, and that power is the
so-called ‘Society of Jesus.’ The spirit that issues from the
mouth of the False Prophet is the spirit of False Morality.</p>

<p>"We may assume, then, that the three evil spirits are Infidelity,
Popery, and False Morality. Have these three influences been the
real cause of the present conflict? The answer is clear.</p>

<p>"The spirit of Infidelity is the very spirit of German criticism.
The Higher Criticism, as it is mockingly called, denies the possibility
of miracles, prediction, and real inspiration, and attempts to
account for the Bible as a natural development. Slowly but surely,
during the last eighty years, the spirit of Infidelity has been
robbing the Germans of their Bible and their faith, so that Germany
is to-day a nation of unbelievers. Higher Criticism has thus made
the war possible; for it would be absolutely impossible for any
Christian nation to wage war as Germany is waging it.</p>

<p>"We come next to the spirit of Popery, whose influence in causing
the war was quite as great as that of Infidelity, though not,
perhaps, so immediately obvious. Since the Franco-Prussian War
the Papal power has steadily declined in France, while in Germany
it has steadily increased. To-day France is an anti-papal state,
while Germany possesses a powerful Roman Catholic minority. Two
papally controlled states, Germany and Austria, are at war with
six anti-papal states &mdash;England, France, Italy, Russia, Serbia,
and Portugal. Belgium is, of course, a thoroughly papal state,
and there can be little doubt that the presence on the Allies’
side of an element so essentially hostile has done much to hamper
the righteous cause and is responsible for our comparative ill-success.
That the spirit of Popery is behind the war is thus seen clearly
enough in the grouping of the opposed powers, while the rebellion
in the Roman Catholic parts of Ireland has merely confirmed a
conclusion already obvious to any unbiased mind.</p>

<p>"The spirit of False Morality has played as great a part in this
war as the two other evil spirits. The Scrap of Paper incident
is the nearest and most obvious example of Germany’s adherence
to this essentially unchristian or Jesuitical morality. The end
is German world-power, and in the attainment of this end, any
means are justifiable. It is the true principle of Jesuitry applied
to international politics.</p>

<p>"The identification is now complete. As was predicted in Revelation,
the three evil spirits have gone forth just as the decay of the
Ottoman power was nearing completion, and have joined together
to make the world war. The warning, ‘Behold, I come as a thief,’
is therefore meant for the present period&mdash;for you and me and
all the world. This war will lead on inevitably to the war of
Armageddon, and will only be brought to an end by the Lord’s personal
return.</p>

<p>"And when He returns, what will happen? Those who are in Christ,
St. John tells us, will be called to the Supper of the Lamb. Those
who are found fighting against Him will be called to the Supper
of the Great God&mdash;that grim banquet where they shall not feast,
but be feasted on. ‘For,’ as St. John says, ‘I saw an angel standing
in the sun; and he cried in a loud voice, saying to all the fowls
that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together
unto the supper of the Great God; that ye may eat the flesh of
kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men,
and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the
flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.’ All
the enemies of Christ will be slain with the sword of him that
sits upon the horse, ‘and all the fowls will be filled with their
flesh.’ That is the Supper of the Great God.</p>

<p>"It may be soon or it may, as men reckon time, be long; but sooner
or later, inevitably, the Lord will come and deliver the world
from its present troubles. And woe unto them who are called, not
to the Supper of the Lamb, but to the Supper of the Great God.
They will realise then, but too late, that God is a God of Wrath
as well as a God of Forgiveness. The God who sent bears to devour
the mockers of Elisha, the God who smote the Egyptians for their
stubborn wickedness, will assuredly smite them too, unless they
make haste to repent. But perhaps it is already too late. Who
knows but that to-morrow, in a moment even, Christ may be upon
us unawares, like a thief? In a little while, who knows? The angel
standing in the sun may be summoning the ravens and vultures from
their crannies in the rocks to feed upon the putrefying flesh
of the millions of unrighteous whom God’s wrath has destroyed.
Be ready, then; the coming of the Lord is at hand. May it be for
all of you an object of hope, not a moment to look forward to
with terror and trembling."</p>

<p>Mr. Bodiham closed the little pamphlet and leaned back in his
chair. The argument was sound, absolutely compelling; and yet&mdash;it
was four years since he had preached that sermon; four years,
and England was at peace, the sun shone, the people of Crome were
as wicked and indifferent as ever&mdash;more so, indeed, if that were
possible. If only he could understand, if the heavens would but
make a sign! But his questionings remained unanswered. Seated
there in his brown varnished chair under the Ruskinian window,
he could have screamed aloud. He gripped the arms of his chair&mdash;gripping,
gripping for control. The knuckles of his hands whitened; he bit
his lip. In a few seconds he was able to relax the tension; he
began to rebuke himself for his rebellious impatience.</p>

<p>Four years, he reflected; what were four years, after all? It
must inevitably take a long time for Armageddon to ripen to yeast
itself up. The episode of 1914 had been a preliminary skirmish.
And as for the war having come to an end&mdash;why, that, of course,
was illusory. It was still going on, smouldering away in Silesia,
in Ireland, in Anatolia; the discontent in Egypt and India was
preparing the way, perhaps, for a great extension of the slaughter
among the heathen peoples. The Chinese boycott of Japan, and the
rivalries of that country and America in the Pacific, might be
breeding a great new war in the East. The prospect, Mr. Bodiham
tried to assure himself, was hopeful; the real, the genuine Armageddon
might soon begin, and then, like a thief in the night...But, in
spite of all his comfortable reasoning, he remained unhappy, dissatisfied.
Four years ago he had been so confident; God’s intention seemed
then so plain. And now? Now, he did well to be angry. And now
he suffered too.</p>

<p>Sudden and silent as a phantom Mrs. Bodiham appeared, gliding
noiselessly across the room. Above her black dress her face was
pale with an opaque whiteness, her eyes were pale as water in
a glass, and her strawy hair was almost colourless. She held a
large envelope in her hand.</p>

<p>"This came for you by the post," she said softly.</p>

<p>The envelope was unsealed. Mechanically Mr. Bodiham tore it open.
It contained a pamphlet, larger than his own and more elegant
in appearance. "The House of Sheeny, Clerical Outfitters, Birmingham."
He turned over the pages. The catalogue was tastefully and ecclesiastically
printed in antique characters with illuminated Gothic initials.
Red marginal lines, crossed at the corners after the manner of
an Oxford picture frame, enclosed each page of type, little red
crosses took the place of full stops. Mr. Bodiham turned the pages.</p>

<p>"Soutane in best black merino. Ready to wear; in all sizes. Clerical
frock coats. From nine guineas. A dressy garment, tailored by
our own experienced ecclesiastical cutters."</p>

<p>Half-tone illustrations represented young curates, some dapper,
some Rugbeian and muscular, some with ascetic faces and large
ecstatic eyes, dressed in jackets, in frock-coats, in surplices,
in clerical evening dress, in black Norfolk suitings.</p>

<p>"A large assortment of chasubles.</p>

<p>"Rope girdles.</p>

<p>"Sheeny’s Special Skirt Cassocks. Tied by a string about the
waist...When worn under a surplice presents an appearance indistinguishable
from that of a complete cassock...Recommended for summer wear
and hot climates."</p>

<p>With a gesture of horror and disgust Mr. Bodiham threw the catalogue
into the waste-paper basket. Mrs. Bodiham looked at him; her pale,
glaucous eyes reflected his action without comment.</p>

<p>"The village," she said in her quiet voice, "the village grows
worse and worse every day."</p>

<p>"What has happened now?" asked Mr. Bodiham, feeling suddenly
very weary.</p>

<p>"I’ll tell you." She pulled up a brown varnished chair and sat
down. In the village of Crome, it seemed, Sodom and Gomorrah had
come to a second birth.</p>
