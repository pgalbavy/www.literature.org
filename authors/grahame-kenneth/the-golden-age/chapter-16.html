<p>HAROLD told me the main facts of this episode some time later,—in bits
and with reluctance. It was not a recollection he cared to talk about.
The crude blank misery of a moment is apt to leave a dull bruise which
is slow to depart, if it ever do so entirely; and Harold confesses to
a twinge or two, still, at times, like the veteran who brings home a
bullet inside him from martial plains over sea.
</p><p>He knew he was a brute the moment he had done it. Selina had not
meant to worry, only to comfort and assist. But his soul was one raw
sore within him, when he found himself shut up in the schoolroom
after hours, merely for insisting that 7 times 7 amounted to 47. The
injustice of it seemed so flagrant. Why not 47 as much as 49! One
number was no prettier than the other to look at, and it was evidently
only a matter of arbitrary taste and preference, and, anyhow, it
had always been 47 to him, and would be to the end of time. So when
Selina came in out of the sun, leaving the Trappers of the Far West
behind her, and putting off the glory of being an Apache squaw in
order to hear him his tables and win his release, Harold turned on her
venomously, rejected her kindly overtures, and even drove his elbow
into her sympathetic ribs, in his determination to be left alone in the
glory of sulks. The fit passed directly, his eyes were opened, and his
soul sat in the dust as he sorrowfully began to cast about for some
atonement heroic enough to salve the wrong.
</p><p>Of course poor Selina looked for no sacrifice nor heroics whatever; she
didn’t even want him to say he was sorry. If he would only make it up,
she would have done the apologising part herself. But that was not a
boy’s way. Something solid, Harold felt, was due from him; and until
that was achieved, making-up must not be thought of, in order that the
final effect might not be spoilt. Accordingly, when his release came,
and Selina hung about trying to catch his eye, Harold, possessed by
the demon of a distorted motive, avoided her steadily—though he was
bleeding inwardly at every minute of delay—and came to me instead.
Needless to say, I warmly approved his plan. It was so much more
high-toned than just going and making-up tamely, which any one could
do; and a girl who had been jobbed in the ribs by a hostile elbow could
not be expected for a moment to overlook it, without the liniment of an
offering to soothe her injured feelings.
</p><p>‘I know what she wants most,’ said Harold. ‘She wants that set of
tea-things in the toy-shop window, with the red and blue flowers on
’em; she’s wanted it for months, ’cos her dolls are getting big enough
to have real afternoon tea; and she wants it so badly that she won’t
walk that side of the street when we go into the town. But it costs
five shillings!’
</p><p>Then we set to work seriously, and devoted the afternoon to a
realisation of assets and the composition of a Budget that might have
been dated without shame from Whitehall. The result worked out as
follows:—
</p><p>                                                    <u>s.</u> <u>d.</u>
</p><p>    By one uncle, unspent through having been lost
    for nearly a week—turned up at last in the
    straw of the dog-kennel                           2    6
</p><p>    By advance from me on security of next uncle,
    and failing that, to be called in at Christmas    1    0
</p><p>    By shaken out of missionary-box with the help
    of a knife-blade. (They were our own pennies
    and a forced levy)                                0    4
</p><p>    By bet due from Edward, for walking across the
    field where Farmer Larkin’s bull was, and
    Edward bet him twopence he wouldn’t—called
    in with difficulty                                0    2
</p><p>    By advance from Martha, on no security at all,
</p><pre>
    only you mustn’t tell your aunt                   1    0
                                                      ------
                                               Total  5    0</pre>
<p>and at last we breathed again.
</p><p>The rest promised to be easy. Selina had a tea-party at five on the
morrow, with the chipped old wooden tea-things that had served her
successive dolls from babyhood. Harold would slip off directly after
dinner, going alone, so as not to arouse suspicion, as we were not
allowed to go into the town by ourselves. It was nearly two miles to
our small metropolis, but there would be plenty of time for him to go
and return, even laden with the olive-branch neatly packed in shavings.
Besides, he might meet the butcher, who was his friend and would give
him a lift. Then, finally, at five, the rapture of the new tea-service,
descended from the skies; and, retribution made, making-up at last,
without loss of dignity. With the event before us, we thought it a
small thing that twenty-four hours more of alienation and pretended
sulks must be kept up on Harold’s part; but Selina, who naturally
knew nothing of the treat in store for her, moped for the rest of the
evening, and took a very heavy heart to bed.
</p><p>Next day when the hour for action arrived, Harold evaded Olympian
attention with an easy modesty born of long practice, and made off for
the front gate. Selina, who had been keeping her eye upon him, thought
he was going down to the pond to catch frogs, a joy they had planned
to share together, and made after him. But Harold, though he heard her
footsteps, continued sternly on his high mission, without even looking
back; and Selina was left to wander disconsolately among flower-beds
that had lost—for her—all scent and colour. I saw it all, and, although
cold reason approved our line of action, instinct told me we were
brutes.
</p><p>[Illustration: “SHOPS CAME FIRST, OF COURSE.....”]
</p><p>Harold reached the town—so he recounted afterwards—in record time,
having run most of the way for fear the tea-things, which had
reposed six months in the window, should be snapped up by some other
conscience-stricken lacerator of a sister’s feelings; and it seemed
hardly credible to find them still there, and their owner willing to
part with them for the price marked on the ticket. He paid his money
down at once, that there should be no drawing back from the bargain;
and then, as the things had to be taken out of the window and packed,
and the afternoon was yet young, he thought he might treat himself to
a taste of urban joys and the <u>vie de Bohême</u>. Shops came first, of
course, and he flattened his nose successively against the window with
the indiarubber balls in it, and the clock-work locomotive; and against
the barber’s window, with wigs on blocks, reminding him of uncles,
and shaving-cream that looked so good to eat; and the grocer’s
window, displaying more currants than the whole British population
could possibly consume without a special effort; and the window of the
bank, wherein gold was thought so little of that it was dealt about in
shovels. Next there was the market-place, with all its clamorous joys;
and when a runaway calf came down the street like a cannon-ball, Harold
felt that he had not lived in vain. The whole place was so brimful of
excitement that he had quite forgotten the why and the wherefore of
his being there, when a sight of the church clock recalled him to his
better self, and sent him flying out of the town, as he realised he
had only just time enough left to get back in. If he were after his
appointed hour, he would not only miss his high triumph, but probably
would be detected as a transgressor of bounds—a crime before which a
private opinion on multiplication sank to nothingness. So he jogged
along on his homeward way, thinking of many things, and probably
talking to himself a good deal, as his habit was. He had covered
nearly half the distance, when suddenly—a deadly sinking in the pit
of his stomach—a paralysis of every limb—around him a world extinct
of light and music—a black sun and a reeling sky—he had forgotten the
tea-things!
</p><p>It was useless, it was hopeless, all was over and nothing could now
be done. Nevertheless he turned and ran back wildly, blindly, choking
with the big sobs that evoked neither pity nor comfort from a merciless
mocking world around; a stitch in his side, dust in his eyes, and black
despair clutching at his heart. So he stumbled on, with leaden legs
and bursting sides, till—as if Fate had not yet dealt him her last
worst buffet of all—on turning a corner in the road he almost ran under
the wheels of a dog-cart, in which, as it pulled up, was apparent the
portly form of Farmer Larkin, the arch-enemy, at whose ducks he had
been shying stones that very morning!
</p><p>Had Harold been in his right and unclouded senses, he would have
vanished through the hedge some seconds earlier, rather than pain
the farmer by any unpleasant reminiscences which his appearance
might recall; but, as things were, he could only stand and blubber
hopelessly, caring, indeed, little now what further misery might befall
him. The farmer, for his part, surveyed the desolate figure with some
astonishment, calling out in no unfriendly accents, ‘Why, Master
Harold! whatever be the matter? Baint runnin’ away, be ee?’
</p><p>Then Harold, with the unnatural courage born of desperation, flung
himself on the step, and, climbing into the cart, fell in the straw
at the bottom of it, sobbing out that he wanted to go back, go back!
The situation had a vagueness; but the farmer, a man of action rather
than of words, swung his horse round smartly, and they were in the
town again by the time Harold had recovered himself sufficiently to
furnish details. As they drove up to the shop, the woman was waiting at
the door with the parcel; and hardly a minute seemed to have elapsed
since the black crisis, ere they were bowling along swiftly home, the
precious parcel hugged in a close embrace.
</p><p>And now the farmer came out in quite a new and unexpected light.
Never a word did he say of broken fences and hurdles, of trampled
crops and harried flocks and herds. One would have thought the man
had never possessed a head of live stock in his life. Instead, he was
deeply interested in the whole dolorous quest of the tea-things, and
sympathised with Harold on the disputed point in mathematics as if he
had been himself at the same stage of education. As they neared home,
Harold found himself, to his surprise, sitting up and chatting to his
new friend like man to man; and before he was set down at a convenient
gap in the garden hedge, he had promised that when Selina gave her
first public tea-party, little Miss Larkin should be invited to come
and bring her whole sawdust family along with her; and the farmer
appeared as pleased and proud as if he had won a gold medal at the
Agricultural Show, and really, when I heard the story, it began to dawn
upon me that those Olympians must have certain good points, far down in
them, and that I should have to leave off abusing them some day.
</p><p>At the hour of five, Selina, having spent the afternoon searching for
Harold in all his accustomed haunts, sat down disconsolately to tea
with her dolls, who ungenerously refused to wait beyond the appointed
hour. The wooden tea-things seemed more chipped than usual; and the
dolls themselves had more of wax and sawdust, and less of human colour
and intelligence about them, than she ever remembered before. It was
then that Harold burst in, very dusty, his stockings at his heels, and
the channels ploughed by tears still showing on his grimy cheeks; and
Selina was at last permitted to know that he had been thinking of her
ever since his ill-judged exhibition of temper, and that his sulks had
not been the genuine article, nor had he gone frogging by himself. It
was a very happy hostess who dispensed hospitality that evening to a
glassy-eyed stiff-kneed circle; and many a dollish <u>gaucherie</u>, that
would have been severely checked on ordinary occasions, was as much
overlooked as if it had been a birthday.
</p><p>But Harold and I, in what I was afterwards given to understand was our
stupid masculine way, thought all her happiness sprang from possession
of the long-coveted tea-service.
