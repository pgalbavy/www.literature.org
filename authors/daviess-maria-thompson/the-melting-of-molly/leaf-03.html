<p>Men are very strange people. They are like those horrible sums in
algebra that you think about and worry about and cry about and try to
get help from other women about, and then, all of a sudden, X works
itself out into perfectly good sense. Not that I thought much about Mr.
Carter, poor man! When he wasn't right around I felt it best to forget
him as much as I could, but it seems hard for other women to let you
forget either your husband or theirs.
</p><p>I know now that I really never got any older than the poor, foolish,
eighteen-years' child that Aunt Adeline married off "safe", all the time
I was the "refuge" sort of wife. I would sit and listen while the other
wives talked over the men in utter bewilderment and most times terror,
then I would force myself to a little more forgetting and poor Mr.
Carter must have suffered the consequences. But all that was a mild sort
of exasperation to what a widow has to go through with in the matter
of--of, well I think hazing is about the best name to give it.
</p><p>"Molly Carter," said Mrs. Johnson just day before yesterday, after the
white-dress, Judge-Wade episode that Aunt Adeline had gone to all the
friends up and down the street to be consoled about, "if you haven't got
sense enough to appreciate your present blissful condition somebody
ought to operate on your mind."
</p><p>I was tempted to say, "Why not my heart?" I was glad she didn't know
how good that heart did feel under my tucker when the boy brought that
basket of fish from Judge Wade's fishing trip Saturday. I have firmly
determined not to blush any more at the thought of that gorgeous man--at
least outwardly.
</p><p>"Don't you think it is very--very lonely to be a widow, Mrs. Johnson?" I
asked timidly to see what she would say about Mr. Johnson, who is really
lovely, I think. He gives me the gentlest understanding smile when he
meets me on the street of late weeks.
</p><p>"Lonely, <u>lonely</u>, Molly? You talk about the married state exactly
like an old maid. Don't do it--it's foolish, and you will get the lone
notion really fastened in your mind and let some fool man find out that
is how you feel. Then it will be all over with you. I have only one
regret, and it is that if I ever should be a widow Mr. Johnson wouldn't
be here to see how quickly I turned into an old maid, by the grace of
God." Mrs. Johnson sews by assassinating the cloth with the needle, and
as she talked she was mending the sleeve of one of Mr. Johnson's shirts.
</p><p>"I think an old maid is just a woman who has never been in love with a
man who loves her. Lots of them have been married for years," I said,
just as innocently as the soft face of a pan of cream, and went on
darning one of Billy's socks.
</p><p>"Well, be that as it may, they are the blessed members of the women
tribe," she answered, looking at me sharply. "Now I have often told
Mr. Johnson--" but here we were interrupted in what might have been the
rehearsal of a glorious scrap by the appearance of Aunt Bettie Pollard,
and with her came a long, tall, lovely vision of a woman in the most
wonderful close clingy dress and hat that you wanted to eat on sight.
I hated her instantly with the most intense adoration that made me want
to lie down at her feet, and also made me feel like I had gained all the
more than twenty pounds that I have slaved off me and doubled them on
again. I would have liked to lead her that minute into Doctor John's
office and just to have looked at him and said one word--"string-bean!"
Aunt Betty introduced her as Miss Chester from Washington.
</p><p>"Oh, my dear Mrs. Carter, how glad I am to meet you!" she said as she
towered over me in a willowy way, and her voice was lovely and cool
almost to slimness. "I am the bearer of so many gracious messages that
I am anxious to deliver them safely to you. Not six weeks ago I left
Alfred Bennett in Paris and really--really his greetings to you almost
amounted to steamer luggage. He came down to Cherbourg to see me off,
and almost the last thing he said to me was, 'Now, don't fail to see
Mrs. Carter as soon as you get to Hillsboro; and the more you see of her
the more you'll enjoy your visit to Mrs. Pollard.' Isn't he the most
delightful of men?" She asked me the question, but she had the most
wonderful way of seeming to be talking to everybody at one time, so
Mrs. Johnson got in the first answer.
</p><p>"Delightful, nothing! But Al Bennett is a man of sense not to marry
any of the string of women I suppose he's got following him!" she said.
Miss Chester looked at her in a mild kind of wonder, but she went on
murdering Mr. Johnson's shirt-sleeve with the needle without noticing
the glance at all.
</p><p>"Well, well, honey, I don't know about that," said Aunt Bettie as she
fanned and rocked her great, big, darling, fat self in the strong rocker
I always kept in the breezy angle of the porch for her. "Al is not old
enough to have proved himself entirely, and from what I hear--" she
paused with the big hearty smile that she always wears when she begins
to tease or match-make, and she does them both most of her time.
</p><p>But at whom do you suppose she looked? Not me! Miss Chester! That was
cold tub number two for that day, and I didn't react as quickly as I
might, but when I did I was in the proper glow all over. When I revived
and saw the lovely pale blush on her face I felt like a cabbage-rose
beside a tea-bud. I was glad Aunt Adeline came out on the porch just
then so I could go in and tell Judy to bring out the iced tea and cakes.
When I came from the kitchen I stepped into my room and took out one of
Alfred's letters from the desk drawer and opened it at random, as you do
the Bible when you want to decide things, and put my finger down on a
line with my eyes shut This was what it was:
</p><p>  "--and all these years I have walked the world, blindfolded to its
  loveliness with the blackness that came to me when I found that you--"
</p>
<p>I didn't read any more, but shoved it back in a hurry and went on out on
the porch, comforted in a way, but feeling some more in sympathy with
Mrs Johnson than I had before Aunt Bettie and her guest from Washington
had interrupted our algebraic demonstration on the man subject. You
can't always be sure of the right answer to X in any proposition of
life; that is, a woman can't!
</p><p>And, furthermore, I didn't like that next hour much, just as a sample of
life, for instance. Aunt Bettie had got her joining-together humor well
started, and right there before my face she made a present of every nice
man in Hillsboro to that lovely, distinguished, strange girl who could
have slipped through a bucket hoop if she had tried hard. I had to sit
there, listen to the presentations, watch her drink two tall delicious
glasses of tea full of sugar and consume without fear three of Judy's
puffy cakes, while I crumbled mine in secret over the banisters and set
half the glass of tea out of sight behind the wistaria vine.
</p><p>It was bad enough to hear Aunt Bettie just offer her Tom, who, if he is
her own son, is my favorite cousin, but I believe the worst minute I
almost ever faced was when she began on the judge, for I could see from
Aunt Adeline's shoulder beyond Miss Chester how she was enjoying that,
and she added another distinguished ancestor to his pedigree every time
Aunt Bettie paused for breath. I couldn't say a word about the fish and
Aunt Adeline wouldn't! I almost loved Mrs. Johnson when she bit off a
thread viciously and said, "Humph," as she rose to start the tea-party
home.
</p><p>That night I did so many exercises that at last I sank exhausted in a
chair in front of my mirror and put my head down on my arms and cried
the real tears you cry when nobody is looking. I felt terribly old and
ugly and dowdy and--widowed. It couldn't have been jealousy, for I just
love that girl. I want most awfully to hug her very slimness and it
was more what she might think of poor dumpy me than what any man in
Hillsboro, Tennessee, or Paris, France, could possibly feel on the
subject that hurt so hard. But then, looking back on it, I am afraid
that jealousy sheds feathers every night so you won't know him in the
morning, for something made me sit up suddenly with a spark in my eyes
and reach out to the desk for my pencil and check-book. It took me more
than an hour to figure it all up, but I went to bed a happier, though
in prospects a poorer woman.
</p><p>It is strange how spending a man's money makes you feel more congenial
with him and as I sat in the cars on my way to the city early the next
morning I felt nearer to Mr. Carter than I almost ever did, alive or
dead. After this I shall always appreciate and admire him for the way he
made money, since, for the first time in my life, I fully realized what
it could buy. And I bought things!
</p><p>First I went to see Madam Courtier for corsets. I had heard about her
and I knew it meant a fortune. But that didn't matter! She came in and
looked at me for about five minutes without saying a word and then she
ran her hands down and down over me until I could feel the flesh just
crawling off of me. It was delicious!
</p><p>Then she and two girls in puffs and rats came in and did things to a
corset they laced on me that I can't even write down, for I didn't
understand the process, but when I looked in that long glass I almost
dropped on the floor. I wasn't tight and I wasn't stiff and I
looked--I'm too modest to write how lovely I really looked to myself.
I was spellbound with delight.
</p><p>[Illustration: I was spellbound with delight]
</p><p>Next I signed the check for three of those wonders with my head so in
the clouds I didn't know what I was doing, but I came to with a jolt
when the prettiest girl began to get me into that black taffeta bag I
had worn down to the city. I must have shrunk the whole remaining pounds
I had felt obliged to lose for Alfred and Ruth Chester from the horror I
felt when I looked at myself. The girl was really sympathetic and said
with a smile that was true kindness: "Shall I call a taxi for madam and
have it take her to Klein's? They have wonderful gowns by Rene all ready
to be fitted at short notice. Really, madam's figure is such that it
commands a perfect costume now." Men do business well, but when women
enter the field they are geniuses at money extracting. I felt myself
already clothed perfectly when that girl said my figure "commanded" a
proper dress. Of course, Klein pays Madam Courtier a commission for the
customers she passes right on to him. The one for me must have looked to
her like a real estate transaction.
</p><p>I spent three days at the great Klein store, only going to the hotel to
sleep and most of the time I forgot to eat. Madam Rene must have been
Madam Courtier's twin sister in youth, and Madam Telliers in the hat
department was the triplet to them both. When women have genius it
breaks out all over them like measles and they never recover from it;
those women had the confluent kind. But I know that old Rene really
liked me, for when I blushed and asked her if they had a good beauty
doctor in the store she held up her hands and shuddered.
</p><p>"Never, Madam, never <u>pour vous</u>. <u>Ravissant, charmant</u>--it is
to fool. Nevair! _Jamais, jamais de la vie!_" I had to calm her
down and she kissed my hand when we parted.
</p><p>I thought Klein was going to do the same thing or worse when I signed
the check which would be good for a house and lot and motor-car for him,
but he didn't. Only he got even with me by saying: "And I am delighted
that the trousseau is perfectly satisfactory to you, Mrs. Carter."
</p><p>That was an awful shock and I hope I didn't show it as I murmured:
"Perfectly, thank you."
</p><p>The word "trousseau" can be spoken in a woman's presence for many years
with no effect, but it is an awful shock when she first <u>really</u>
hears it. I felt funny all afternoon as I packed those trunks for the
five o'clock train.
</p><p>Yes, the word "trousseau" ought to have a definite surname after it
always and that's why my loyalty dragged poor Mr. Carter out into the
light of my conscience. The thinking of him had a strange effect on me.
I had laid out the dream in dark gray-blue rajah, tailored almost beyond
endurance, to wear home on the train and had thrown the old black
taffeta bag across the chair to give to the hotel maid, but the decision
of the session between conscience and loyalty made me pack the precious
blue wonder and put on once more the black rags of remembrance in a kind
of panic of respect.
</p><p>I would lots rather have bought poor Mr. Carter the monument I have been
planning for months to keep up conversation with Aunt Adeline, than wear
that dress again. I felt conscience reprove me once more with loyalty
looking on in disapproval as I buttoned the old thing up for the last
time, because I really ought to have stayed over a day to buy that
monument, but--to tell the truth I wanted to see Billy so desperately
that his "sleep-place" above my heart hurt as if it might have prickly
heat break out at any minute.
</p><p>So I hurried and stuffed the gray-blue darling in the top tray, lapped
old black taffeta around my waist and belted it in with a black belt off
a new green linen I had made for morning walks, down to the drug store
on the public square, I suppose. That is about the only morning
dissipation in Hillsboro that I can think of, and it all depends on whom
you meet, how much of a dissipation it is.
</p><p>The next thing that happens after you have done a noble deed is, you
either regard it as a reward of virtue or as a punishment for having
been foolish. I felt both ways when Judge Wade came down the car aisle,
looking so much grander than any other man in sight that I don't see how
they stand him ever. At that minute the noble black-taffeta deed felt
foolish, but at the next minute I thanked my lucky stars for it.
</p><p>It is nice to watch for a person to catch sight of you if you feel sure
how they are going to take it and somehow in this case I felt sure. I
was not disappointed, for his smile broke his face up into a joy-laugh.
Off came his hat instantly so I could catch a glimpse of the fascinating
frost over his temples, and with a positive sigh of rapture he subsided
into the seat beside me. I turned with an echo smile all over me when
suddenly his face became grave and considerate, and he looked at me as
all the men in Hillsboro have been doing ever since poor Mr. Carter's
funeral.
</p><p>"Mrs. Carter," he said very kindly, in a voice that pitched me out of
the car window and left me a mile behind on the track, all by myself,
"I wish I had known of your sad errand to town so I could have offered
you some assistance in your selection. You know we have just had our lot
in the cemetery finally arranged and I found the dealers in memorial
stones very confusing in their ideas and designs. Mrs. Henderson just
told my mother of your absence from home last night, and I could only
come down to the city for the day on important business or I would have
arranged to see you. I hope you found something that satisfied you."
</p><p>What's a woman going to say when she has a tombstone thrown in her face
like that? I didn't say anything, but what I thought about Aunt Adeline
filled in a dreadful pause.
</p><p>Perfectly dumb and quiet I sat for an awful space of time and wondered
just what I was going to do. Could a woman lie a monument into her suit
case? It was beyond me at that speaking and the Molly that is ready for
life quick, didn't want to. I shut my eyes, counted three to myself as I
do when I go over into the cold tub, and told him all about it. We both
got a satisfactory reaction and I never enjoyed myself so much as that
before.
</p><p>I understand now why Judge Wade has had so many women martyr themselves
over him and live unhappily ever afterward, as everybody says Henrietta
Mason is doing. He's a very inspiring man and he fairly bristles with
fascinations. Some men are what you call taking and they take you if
they want you, while others are drawing and after you are drawn to them
they will consider the question of taking you. The judge is like that.
</p><p>In the meantime it tingles me up to a very great degree to have a man
use his eyes on me as it is the privilege of only womankind to do, and I
feel that it will be good for his judgeship for me to let him "draw" me
at least a little way. I may get hurt, but I shall at least have an
interesting time of it. I started right then and got results, for he
stopped under the old lilac bush that leans over my side gate and kissed
my hand. Old Lilac shook a laugh of perfume all over us and I believe
signaled the event at the top of his bough to the white clump on the
other side of the garden. I'm glad Aunt Adeline isn't in the flower
fraternity or sorority. Suppose she had seen or heard!
</p><p>And it didn't take many minutes for me to slip into old
summer-before-last--also for the last time inside of those buttons--and
run through the garden, my heart singing, "Billy, Billy," in a perfect
rapture of tune. I ran past the office door and found him in his cot
almost asleep and we had a bear reunion in the rocker by the window that
made us both breathless.
</p><p>"What did you bring me, Molly?" he finally kissed under my right ear.
</p><p>"A real base-ball and bat, lover, and an engine with five cars, a rake
and a spade and a hoe, two blow-guns that pop a new way and something
that squirts water and some other things. Will that be enough?" I hugged
him up anxiously, for sometimes he is hard to please and I might not
have got the very thing he wanted.
</p><p>"Thank you, Molly, all them things is what I want, but you oughter brung
more'n that for three days not being here with me." Did any woman ever
have a more lovely lover than that? I don't know how long I should have
rocked him in the twilight if Doctor John's voice hadn't come across the
hall in command.
</p><p>"Put him down now, Mrs. Molly, and come and say other how-do-you-does,"
he called softly.
</p><p>It was a funny glad-to-see-him I felt as I came into the office where he
was standing over by the window looking out at my garden in its twilight
glow. I think it is wrong for a woman to let her imagination kiss a man
on the back of his neck even if she has known for some time that there
is a little drake-tail lock of hair there just like his own son's. I
gave him my hand and a good deal more of a smile and a blush than I
intended.
</p><p>He very far from kissed the hand; he held it just long enough to turn me
around into the light and give me one long looking-over from head to
feet.
</p><p>"Just where does that corset press you worst?" he asked in the tone of
voice he uses to say "poke out your tongue." So much of my Tennessee
shooting-blood rose to my face that it is a wonder it didn't drip; but I
was cold enough to have hit at forty paces if I had had a shooting-iron
in my hand. As it was the coldness was the only missile that I had, but
I used it to some effect.
</p><p>"I am making a call on a friend, Doctor Moore, and not a consultation
visit to my physician," I said, looking into his face as though I had
never seen him before.
</p><p>"I beg your pardon, Molly," he exclaimed and his face was redder than
mine and then it went white with mortification. I couldn't stand that.
</p><p>"Don't do that way!" I exclaimed, and before I knew it I had taken
hold of his hand and had it in both of mine. "I know I look as if I
was shrunk or laced, but I'm not! I was going to tell you all about
it and show it to you. I'm really inches bigger in the right place and
just--just 'controlled', the woman called it, in the wrong place. Please
feel me and see," and I offered myself to him for examination in the
most regardless way. He's not at all like other people.
</p><p>The blood came back into his face and he laughed as he gave me a little
shake that pushed me away from him. "Don't you ever scare me like that
again, child, or it might be serious," he said in the Billy-and-me tone
of voice that I like some, only--
</p><p>"I never will," I said in a hurry; "I want you to ask me anything in the
world you want to and I'll always do it."
</p><p>"Well, let me take you home through the garden then--and, yes, I believe
I'll stay to break a muffin with Mrs. Henderson. Don't you want to tell
me what a little girl like you did in a big city and--and read me part
of that London letter I saw the postman give Judy this afternoon?"
</p><p>Again I ask myself the question why his friendliness to Alfred Bennett's
letters always makes me so instantly cross.
