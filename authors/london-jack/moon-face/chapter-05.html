<P>
WADE ATSHELER is dead--dead by his own hand. To say that this was entirely
unexpected by the small coterie which knew him, would be to say an untruth;
and yet never once had we, his intimates, ever canvassed the idea. Rather had
we been prepared for it in some incomprehensible subconscious way. Before the
perpetration of the deed, its possibility is remotest from our thoughts; but
when we did know that he was dead, it seemed, somehow, that we had understood
and looked forward to it all the time. This, by retrospective analysis, we
could easily explain by the fact of his great trouble. I use "great trouble"
advisedly. Young, handsome, with an assured position as the right-hand man of
Eben Hale, the great street-railway magnate, there could be no reason for him
to complain of fortune's favors. Yet we had watched his smooth brow furrow and
corrugate as under some carking care or devouring sorrow. We had watched his
thick, black hair thin and silver as green grain under brazen skies and
parching drought. Who can forget, in the midst of the hilarious scenes he
toward the last sought with greater and greater avidity--who can forget, I
say, the deep abstractions and black moods into which he fell? At such times,
when the fun rippled and soared from height to height, suddenly, without rhyme
or reason, his eyes would turn lacklustre, his brows knit, as with clenched
hands and face overshot with spasms of mental pain he wrestled on the edge of
the abyss with some unknown danger.
<P>
He never spoke of his trouble, nor were we indiscreet enough to ask. But it
was just as well; for had we, and had he spoken, our help and strength could
have availed nothing. When Eben Hale died, whose confidential secretary he
was--nay, well-nigh adopted son and full business partner--he no longer came
among us. Not, as I now know, that our company was distasteful to him, but
because his trouble had so grown that he could not respond to our happiness
nor find surcease with us. Why this should be so we could not at the time
understand, for when Eben Hale's will was probated, the world learned that he
was sole heir to his employer's many millions, and it was expressly stipulated
that this great inheritance was given to him without qualification, hitch, or
hindrance in the exercise thereof. Not a share of stock, not a penny of cash,
was bequeathed to the dead man's relatives. As for his direct family, one
astounding clause expressly stated that Wade Atsheler was to dispense to Eben
Hale's wife and sons and daughters whatever moneys his judgement dictated, at
whatever times he deemed advisable. Had there been any scandal in the dead
man's family, or had his sons been wild or undutiful, then there might have
been a glimmering of reason in this most unusual action; but Eben Hale's
domestic happiness had been proverbial in the community, and one would have to
travel far and wide to discover a cleaner, saner, wholesomer progeny of sons
and daughters. While his wife--well, by those who knew her best she was
endearingly termed "The Mother of the Gracchi." Needless to state, this
inexplicable will was a nine day's wonder; but the expectant public was
disappointed in that no contest was made.
<P>
It was only the other day that Eben Hale was laid away in his stately marble
mausoleum. And now Wade Atsheler is dead. The news was printed in this
morning's paper. I have just received through the mail a Ietter from him,
posted, evidently, but a short hour before he hurled himself into eternity.
This letter, which lies before me, is a narrative in his own handwriting,
linking together numerous newspaper clippings and facsimiles of letters. The
original correspondence, he has told me, is in the hands of the police. He has
begged me, also, as a warning to society against a most frightful and
diabolical danger which threatens its very existence, to make public the
terrible series of tragedies in which he has been innocently concerned. I
herewith append the text in full:
<P>
It was in August, 1899, just after my return from my summer vacation, that the
blow fell. We did not know it at the time; we had not yet learned to school
our minds to such awful possibilities. Mr. Hale opened the letter, read it,
and tossed it upon my desk with a laugh. When I had looked it over, I also
laughed, saying, "Some ghastly joke, Mr. Hale, and one in very poor taste."
Find here, my dear John, an exact duplicate of the letter in question.
<P>
OFFICE OF THE M. OF M. August 17, 1899.
<P>
MR. EBEN HALE, Money Baron:
<P>
Dear Sir,--We desire you to realize upon whatever portion of your vast
holdings is necessary to obtain, IN CASH, twenty millions of dollars. This sum
we require you to pay over to us, or to our agents. You will note we do not
specify any given time, for it is not our wish to hurry you in this matter.
You may even, if it be easier for you, pay us in ten, fifteen, or twenty
instalments; but we will accept no single instalment of less than a million.
<P>
Believe us, dear Mr. Hale, when we say that we embark upon this course of
action utterly devoid of animus. We are members of that intellectual
proletariat, the increasing numbers of which mark in red lettering the last
days of the nineteenth century. We have, from a thorough study of economics,
decided to enter upon this business. It has many merits, chief among which may
be noted that we can indulge in large and lucrative operations without
capital. So far, we have been fairly successful, and we hope our dealings with
you may be pleasant and satisfactory.
<P>
Pray attend while we explain our views more fully. At the base of the present
system of society is to be found the property right. And this right of the
individual to hold property is demonstrated, in the last analysis, to rest
solely and wholly upon MIGHT. The mailed gentlemen of William the Conqueror
divided and apportioned England amongst themselves with the naked sword. This,
we are sure you will grant, is true of all feudal possessions. With the
invention of steam and the Industrial Revolution there came into existence the
Capitalist Class, in the modern sense of the word. These capitalists quickly
towered above the ancient nobility. The captains of industry have virtually
dispossessed the descendants of the captains of war. Mind, and not muscle,
wins in to-day's struggle for existence. But this state of affairs is none the
less based upon might. The change has been qualitative. The old-time Feudal
Baronage ravaged the world with fire and sword; the modern Money Baronage
exploits the world by mastering and applying the world's economic forces.
Brain, and not brawn, endures; and those best fitted to survive are the
intellectually and commercially powerful.
<P>
We, the M. of M., are not content to become wage slaves. The great trusts and
business combinations (with which you have your rating) prevent us from rising
to the place among you which our intellects qualify us to occupy. Why? Because
we are without capital. We are of the unwashed, but with this difference: our
brains are of the best, and we have no foolish ethical nor social scruples. As
wage slaves, toiling early and late, and living abstemiously, we could not
save in threescore years--nor in twenty times threescore years--a sum of money
sufficient successfully to cope with the great aggregations of massed capital
which now exist. Nevertheless, we have entered the arena. We now throw down
the gage to the capital of the world. Whether it wishes to fight or not, it
shall have to fight.
<P>
Mr. Hale, our interests dictate us to demand of you twenty millions of
dollars. While we are considerate enough to give you reasonable time in which
to carry out your share of the transaction, please do not delay too long. When
you have agreed to our terms, insert a suitable notice in the agony column of
the "Morning Blazer." We shall then acquaint you with our plan for
transferring the sum mentioned. You had better do this some time prior to
October 1st. If you do not, in order to show that we are in earnest we shall
on that date kill a man on East Thirty-ninth Street. He will be a workingman.
This man you do not know; nor do we. You represent a force in modern society;
we also represent a force--a new force. Without anger or malice, we have
closed in battle. As you will readily discern, we are simply a business
proposition. You are the upper, and we the nether, millstone; this man's life
shall be ground out between. You may save him if you agree to our conditions
and act in time.
<P>
There was once a king cursed with a golden touch. His name we have taken to do
duty as our official seal. Some day, to protect ourselves against competitors,
we shall copyright it.
<P>
We beg to remain,
<P>
THE MINIONS OF MIDAS.
<P>
I leave it to you, dear John, why should we not have laughed over such a
preposterous communication? The idea, we could not but grant, was well
conceived, but it was too grotesque to be taken seriously. Mr. Hale said he
would preserve it as a literary curiosity, and shoved it away in a pigeonhole.
Then we promptly forgot its existence. And as promptly, on the 1st of October,
going over the morning mail, we read the following:
<P>
OFFICE OF THE M. OF M., October 1, 1899.
<P>
MR. EBEN HALE, Money Baron:
<P>
Dear Sir,--Your victim has met his fate. An hour ago, on East Thirty-ninth
Street, a workingman was thrust through the heart with a knife. Ere you read
this his body will be lying at the Morgue. Go and look upon your handiwork.
<P>
On October 14th, in token of our earnestness in this matter, and in case you
do not relent, we shall kill a policeman on or near the corner of Polk Street
and Clermont Avenue.
<P>
Very cordially,
<P>
THE MINIONS OF MIDAS.
<P>
Again Mr. Hale laughed. His mind was full of a prospective deal with a Chicago
syndicate for the sale of all his street railways in that city, and so he went
on dictating to the stenographer, never giving it a second thought. But
somehow, I know not why, a heavy depression fell upon me. What if it were not
a joke, I asked myself, and turned involuntarily to the morning paper. There
it was, as befitted an obscure person of the lower classes, a paltry
half-dozen lines tucked away in a corner, next a patent medicine
advertisement:
<P>
Shortly after five o'clock this morning, on East Thirty-ninth Street, a
laborer named Pete Lascalle, while on his way to work, was stabbed to the
heart by an unknown assailant, who escaped by running. The police have been
unable to discover any motive for the murder.
<P>
"Impossible!" was Mr. Hale's rejoinder, when I had read the item aloud; but
the incident evidently weighed upon his mind, for late in the afternoon, with
many epithets denunciatory of his foolishness, he asked me to acquaint the
police with the affair. I had the pleasure of being laughed at in the
Inspector's private office, although I went away with the assurance that they
would look into it and that the vicinity of Polk and Clermont would be doubly
patrolled on the night mentioned. There it dropped, till the two weeks had
sped by, when the following note came to us through the mail:
<P>
OFFICE OF THE M. OF M. October 15, 1899.
<P>
MR. EBEN HALE, Money Baron:
<P>
Dear Sir,--Your second victim has fallen on schedule time. We are in no hurry;
but to increase the pressure we shall henceforth kill weekly. To protect
ourselves against police interference we shall hereafter inform you of the
event but a little prior to or simultaneously with the deed. Trusting this
finds you in good health,
<P>
We are,
<P>
THE MINIONS OF MIDAS.
<P>
This time Mr. Hale took up the paper, and after a brief search, read to me
this account:
<P>
A DASTARDLY CRIME
<P>
Joseph Donahue, assigned only last night to special patrol duty in the
Eleventh Ward, at midnight was shot through the brain and instantly killed.
The tragedy was enacted in the full glare of the street lights on the corner
of Polk Street and Clermont Avenue. Our society is indeed unstable when the
custodians of its peace are thus openly and wantonly shot down. The police
have so far been unable to obtain the slightest clue.
<P>
Barely had he finished this when the police arrived--the Inspector himself and
two of his keenest sleuths. Alarm sat upon their faces, and it was plain that
they were seriously perturbed. Though the facts were so few and simple, we
talked long, going over the affair again and again. When the Inspector went
away, he confidently assured us that everything would soon be straightened out
and the assassins run to earth. In the meantime he thought it well to detail
guards for the protection of Mr. Hale and myself, and several more to be
constantly on the vigil about the house and grounds. After the lapse of a
week, at one o'clock in the afternoon, this telegram was received:
<P>
OFFICE OF THE M. OF M. October 2I, 1899.
<P>
MR. EBEN HALE, Money Baron:
<P>
Dear Sir,--We are sorry to note how completely you have misunderstood us. You
have seen fit to surround yourself and household with armed guards, as though,
forsooth, we were common criminals, apt to break in upon you and wrest away by
force your twenty millions. Believe us, this is farthest from our intention.
<P>
You will readily comprehend, after a little sober thought, that your life is
dear to us. Do not be afraid. We would not hurt you for the world. It is our
policy to cherish you tenderly and protect you from all harm. Your death means
nothing to us. If it did, rest assured that we would not hesitate a moment in
destroying you. Think this over, Mr. Hale. When you have paid us our price,
there will be need of retrenchment. Dismiss your guards now, and cut down your
expenses.
<P>
Within minutes of the time you receive this a nurse-girl will have been choked
to death in Brentwood Park. The body may be found in the shrubbery lining the
path which leads off to the left from the band-stand.
<P>
Cordially yours,
<P>
THE MINIONS OF MIDAS.
<P>
The next instant Mr. Hale was at the telephone, warning the Inspector of the
impending murder. The Inspector excused himself in order to call up Police
Sub-station F and despatch men to the scene. Fifteen minutes later he rang us
up and informed us that the body had been discovered, yet warm, in the place
indicated. That evening the papers teemed with glaring Jack-the-Strangler
headlines, denouncing the brutality of the deed and complaining about the
laxity of the police. We were also closeted with the Inspector, who begged us
by all means to keep the affair secret. Success, he said, depended upon
silence.
<P>
As you know, John, Mr. Hale was a man of iron. He refused to surrender. But,
oh, John, it was terrible, nay, horrible--this awful something, this blind
force in the dark. We could not fight, could not plan, could do nothing save
hold our hands and wait. And week by week, as certain as the rising of the
sun, came the notification and death of some person, man or woman, innocent of
evil, but just as much killed by us as though we had done it with our own
hands. A word from Mr. Hale and the slaughter would have ceased. But he
hardened his heart and waited, the lines deepening, the mouth and eyes growing
sterner and firmer, and the face aging with the hours. It is needless for me
to speak of my own suffering during that frightful period. Find here the
letters and telegrams of the M. of M., and the newspaper accounts, etc., of
the various murders.
<P>
You will notice also the letters warning Mr. Hale of certain machinations of
commercial enemies and secret manipulations of stock. The M. of M. seemed to
have its hand on the inner pulse of the business and financial world. They
possessed themselves of and forwarded to us information which our agents could
not obtain. One timely note from them, at a critical moment in a certain deal,
saved all of five millions to Mr. Hale. At another time they sent us a
telegram which probably was the means of preventing an anarchist crank from
taking my employer's life. We captured the man on his arrival and turned him
over to the police, who found upon him enough of a new and powerful explosive
to sink a battleship.
<P>
We persisted. Mr. Hale was grit clear through. He disbursed at the rate of one
hundred thousand per week for secret service. The aid of the Pinkertons and of
countless private detective agencies was called in, and in addition to this
thousands were upon our payroll. Our agents swarmed everywhere, in all guises,
penetrating all classes of society. They grasped at a myriad clues; hundreds
of suspects were jailed, and at various times thousands of suspicious persons
were under surveillance, but nothing tangible came to light. With its
communications the M. of M. continually changed its method of delivery. And
every messenger they sent us was arrested forthwith. But these inevitably
proved to be innocent individuals, while their descriptions of the persons who
had employed them for the errand never tallied. On the last day of December we
received this notification:
<P>
OFFICE OF THE M. OF M., December 31, 1899.
<P>
MR. EBEN HALE, Money Baron:
<P>
Dear Sir,--Pursuant of our policy, with which we flatter ourselves you are
already well versed, we beg to state that we shall give a passport from this
Vale of Tears to Inspector Bying, with whom, because of our attentions, you
have become so well acquainted. It is his custom to be in his private office
at this hour. Even as you read this he breathes his last.
<P>
Cordially yours,
<P>
THE MINIONS OF MIDAS.
<P>
I dropped the letter and sprang to the telephone. Great was my relief when I
heard the Inspector's hearty voice. But, even as he spoke, his voice died away
in the receiver to a gurgling sob, and I heard faintly the crash of a falling
body. Then a strange voice hello'd me, sent me the regards of the M. of M.,
and broke the switch. Like a flash I called up the public office of the
Central Police, telling them to go at once to the Inspector's aid in his
private office. I then held the line, and a few minutes later received the
intelligence that he had been found bathed in his own blood and breathing his
last. There were no eyewitnesses, and no trace was discoverable of the
murderer.
<P>
Whereupon Mr. Hale immediately increased his secret service till a quarter of
a million flowed weekly from his coffers. He was determined to win out. His
graduated rewards aggregated over ten millions. You have a fair idea of his
resources and you can see in what manner he drew upon them. It was the
principle, he affirmed, that he was fighting for, not the gold. And it must be
admitted that his course proved the nobility of his motive. The police
departments of all the great cities cooperated, and even the United States
Government stepped in, and the affair became one of the highest questions of
state. Certain contingent funds of the nation were devoted to the unearthing
of the M. of M., and every government agent was on the alert. But all in vain.
The Minions of Midas carried on their damnable work unhampered. They had their
way and struck unerringly.
<P>
But while he fought to the last, Mr. Hale could not wash his hands of the
blood with which they were dyed. Though not technically a murderer, though no
jury of his peers would ever have convicted him, none the less the death of
every individual was due to him. As I said before, a word from him and the
slaughter would have ceased. But he refused to give that word. He insisted
that the integrity of society was assailed; that he was not sufficiently a
coward to desert his post; and that it was manifestly just that a few should
be martyred for the ultimate welfare of the many. Nevertheless this blood was
upon his head, and he sank into deeper and deeper gloom. I was likewise
whelmed with the guilt of an accomplice. Babies were ruthlessly killed,
children, aged men; and not only were these murders local, but they were
distributed over the country. In the middle of February, one evening, as we
sat in the library, there came a sharp knock at the door. On responding to it
I found, Lying on the carpet of the corridor, the following missive:
<P>
OFFICE OF THE M. OF M., February 15, 1900.
<P>
MR. EBEN HALE, Money Baron:
<P>
Dear Sir,--Does not your soul cry out upon the red harvest it is reaping?
Perhaps we have been too abstract in conducting our business. Let us now be
concrete. Miss Adelaide Laidlaw is a talented young woman, as good, we
understand, as she is beautiful. She is the daughter of your old friend, Judge
Laidlaw, and we happen to know that you carried her in your arms when she was
an infant. She is your daughter's closest friend, and at present is visiting
her. When your eyes have read thus far her visit will have terminated.
<P>
Very cordially,
<P>
THE MINIONS OF MIDAS.
<P>
My God! did we not instantly realize the terrible import! We rushed through
the dayrooms--she was not there--and on to her own apartments. The door was
locked, but we crashed it down by hurling ourselves against it. There she lay,
just as she had finished dressing for the opera, smothered with pillows torn
from the couch, the flush of life yet on her flesh, the body still flexible
and warm. Let me pass over the rest of this horror. You will surely remember,
John, the newspaper accounts.
<P>
Late that night Mr. Hale summoned me to him, and before God did pledge me most
solemnly to stand by him and not to compromise, even if all kith and kin were
destroyed.
<P>
The next day I was surprised at his cheerfulness. I had thought he would be
deeply shocked by this last tragedy--how deep I was soon to learn. All day he
was light-hearted and high-spirited, as though at last he had found a way out
of the frightful difficulty. The next morning we found him dead in his bed, a
peaceful smile upon his careworn face--asphyxiation. Through the connivance of
the police and the authorities, it was given out to the world as heart
disease. We deemed it wise to withhold the truth; but little good has it done
us, little good has anything done us.
<P>
Barely had I left that chamber of death, when--but too late--the following
extraordinary letter was received:
<P>
OFFICE OF THE M. of M., February 17, 1900.
<P>
MR. EBEN HALE, Money Baron:
<P>
Dear Sir,--You will pardon our intrusion, we hope, so closely upon the sad
event of day before yesterday; but what we wish to say may be of the utmost
importance to you. It is in our mind that you may attempt to escape us. There
is but one way, apparently, as you have ere this doubtless discovered. But we
wish to inform you that even this one way is barred. You may die, but you die
failing and acknowledging your failure. Note this: WE ARE PART AND PARCEL OF
YOUR POSSESSIONS. WITH YOUR MILLIONS WE PASS DOWN TO YOUR HEIRS AND ASSIGNS
FOREVER.
<P>
We are the inevitable. We are the culmination of industrial and social wrong;.
We turn upon the society that has created us. We are the successful failures
of the age, the scourges of a degraded civilization.
<P>
We are the creatures of a perverse social selection. We meet force with force.
Only the strong shall endure. We believe in the survival of the fittest. You
have crushed your wage slaves into the dirt and you have survived. The
captains of war, at your command, have shot down like dogs your employees in a
score of bloody strikes. By such means you have endured. We do not grumble at
the result, for we acknowledge and have our being in the same natural law. And
now the question has arisen: UNDER THE PRESENT SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT, WHICH OF US
SHALL SURVIVE? We believe we are the fittest. You believe you are the fittest.
We leave the eventuality to time and law.
<P>
Cordially yours,
<P>
THE MINIONS OF MIDAS.
<P>
John, do you wonder now that I shunned pleasure and avoided friends? But why
explain? Surely this narrative will make everything clear. Three weeks ago
Adelaide Laidlaw died. Since then I have waited in hope and fear. Yesterday
the will was probated and made public. Today I was notified that a woman of
the middle class would be killed in Golden Gate Park, in faraway San
Francisco. The despatches in to-night's papers give the details of the brutal
happening--details which correspond with those furnished me in advance.
<P>
It is useless. I cannot struggle against the inevitable. I have been faithful
to Mr. Hale and have worked hard. Why my faithfulness should have been thus
rewarded I cannot understand. Yet I cannot be false to my trust, nor break my
word by compromising. Still, I have resolved that no more deaths shall be upon
my head. I have willed the many millions I lately received to their rightful
owners. Let the stalwart sons of Eben Hale work out their own salvation. Ere
you read this I shall have passed on. The Minions of Midas are all-powerful.
The police are impotent. I have learned from them that other millionnaires
have been likewise mulcted or persecuted--how many is not known, for when one
yields to the M. of M., his mouth is thenceforth sealed. Those who have not
yielded are even now reaping their scarlet harvest. The grim game is being
played out. The Federal Government can do nothing. I also understand that
similar branch organizations have made their appearance in Europe. Society is
shaken to its foundations. Principalities and powers are as brands ripe for
the burning. Instead of the masses against the classes, it is a class against
the classes. We, the guardians of human progress, are being singled out and
struck down. Law and order have failed.
<P>
The officials have begged me to keep this secret. I have done so, but can do
so no longer. It has become a question of public import, fraught with the
direst consequences, and I shall do my duty before I leave this world by
informing it of its peril. Do you, John, as my last request, make this public.
Do not be frightened. The fate of humanity rests in your hand. Let the press
strike off millions of copies; let the electric currents sweep it round the
world; wherever men meet and speak, let them speak of it in fear and
trembling. And then, when thoroughly aroused, let society arise in its might
and cast out this abomination.
<P>
Yours, in long farewell,
WADE ATSHELER.
