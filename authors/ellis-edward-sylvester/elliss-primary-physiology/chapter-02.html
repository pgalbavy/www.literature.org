<p>One of the first things to remember is the need of keeping your
bodies clean. Of course you wash your hands and face as soon as
you rise in the morning, and if necessary through the day, but
that is not enough.</p>

<p>The skin is composed of two layers, the outer or scarf skin and
the inner or true skin. The outer is continually wearing out and
falls from the body in fine scales. The skin is pierced by thousands
upon thousands of pores, or tiny openings, through which a large
part of the waste of the body passes. If these pores are allowed
to become clogged by want of cleanliness, the waste matter enters
the blood and may cause disease and death.</p>

<p>The way to keep the pores open is by bathing or cleanliness.
When the weather is cold, you should bathe at least once a week
at home. The water should be moderately cold. After bathing, rub
yourself from head to foot with a coarse towel until the skin
becomes warm and red. Then dress quickly and do not go out-of-doors
for half an hour.</p>

<p>During summer it is well to bathe every day. Salt water is better
than fresh. Boys are fond of bathing and are inclined to spend
too much time in the water.</p>

<p>Avoid stagnant or impure water. Running streams, ponds into and
from which water continually flows, creeks, rivers, lakes, and
the ocean afford good bathing.</p>

<p>Do not bathe when the body is overheated or you are perspiring
freely, or within two hours of breakfast, dinner or supper. Stay
in as long as it is pleasant, but come out before you begin to
feel chilly.</p>

<p>In entering, it is best to plunge at once under the surface.
If you walk slowly, as many timid people do, until the water gradually
reaches your neck, you leave the brain heated too long. It ought
to be cooled at the first.</p>

<p>After bathing, rub your body dry and dress without delay. Do
not lounge on the shore in your bathing dress. If you do, the
body becomes chilled, and ill results are likely to follow.</p>
