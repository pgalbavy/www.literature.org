<p>With the hostile Iroquois on both sides the Susquehanna, and
the awkward scow near the shore, it will be seen that the situation
of the fugitives, striving to reach the protection of Wilkesbarre,
was not of an encouraging nature. The Mohawk was confident that
he had read the meaning of the waving torch aright, and that if
he expected to reach the shore immediately behind him, it must
be done at once.</p>

<p>The signal light was scarcely extinguished when he rose to a
stooping position, and applied the pole with all the vigor at
his command. It was astonishing to see the speed he was able to
force out of the unwieldy structure. The foam actually curled
away from the bow, and in a few seconds it ran plump against the
bank and stuck fast.</p>

<p>"Now is our time," said Ned, as he caught the hand of Rosa, who
sprang up at the same instant with her brother.</p>

<p>"Yes; it won't do to wait a second," added Jo.</p>

<p>"'Sh! move fast&mdash;don't make noise," put in the Mohawk.</p>

<p>In a twinkling the entire party had landed, and hurried away
from the spot, expecting some of the Iroquois would be there within
a very short time. They were right in this supposition, and were
none too soon in getting away from the place. The Mohawk led the
way directly up stream, keeping close to the shore, but still
leaving enough space between them and the water for the passage
of a number of their enemies.</p>

<p>It was certainly less than three minutes after the landing of
the whites that sounds around them were detected, proving that
the redmen were hastening to the spot. Their failure to be there
when the landing took place seemed to point to the conclusion
that they must have failed to keep track of the craft after receiving
the notification from the allies across the river. The faintest
possible "'Sh!" from the Mohawk apprised his companions that danger
was close, and all came to an instant halt. The sounds of the
Iroquois moving near them were slight, but they told the story
as plainly as if the sunlight revealed every form.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the Indians did not take long to find the
scow that had been abandoned by the fugitives. And when the craft
was discovered it told its own story. The nest was warm, but the
bird had flown. When the Iroquois realized this fact, they exchanged
a few words, which the Mohawk heard and understood, for they were
in his own tongue.</p>

<p>"We have come too late to find the pale faces," said one.</p>

<p>"They have gone," replied another. "They are hiding in the woods,
and we shall not find them till to-morrow."</p>

<p>"They cannot cross the big brook," continued one who seemed to
be the first speaker. "When the sun comes to light up the forest,
then we will take their trail and hunt them to their holes, and
before the sun goes down there shall not be a scalp left but on
the head of the Flower of the Woods."</p>

<p>"And the traitor Lena-Wingo, what shall be done with him?"</p>

<p>"His scalp shall be torn from his head and flung in his face.
Then he shall be taken to the towns of the Iroquois and tied to
a tree, and left till the birds pick out his eyes. The Iroquois
women and children shall dance around him, and laugh till his
eyes are gone."</p>

<p>This was interesting information to the individual referred to,
but it affected him little. He had heard too many such threats
before.</p>

<p>"Lena-Wingo is cunning as the serpent that crawls in the grass,"
continued the Iroquois, who were dissecting him in his own hearing.</p>

<p>"You do not hear him move when he comes for his prey, or steals
away from the warriors that are hunting him."</p>

<p>"But Brandt, the great chieftain, has sworn to take the scalp
of Lena-Wingo, and he will do it, unless the traitor runs away
from so great a warrior, as Brandt says he has run when he heard
that he was hunting for him."</p>

<p>If ever there was an angry Indian, that one was Lena-Wingo, when
he heard these words. The thought of his running away from any
one through fear was a little more than he could stand with composure;
and those who were crouching around him in breathless stillness
were surprised to hear him shift his position and breathe hard,
as though struggling to suppress his emotions. Could they have
seen his face at that moment, distorted as it was by passion,
they would have been frightened at his appearance. His hand clutched
his knife and he was on the point of stealing toward the warrior
who had uttered the irritating untruth, when he seemed to gain
the mastery of himself&mdash;aided no doubt by the fact that at the
same instant his quick ear caught the sound of a paddle, so faint
that no one else heard it. He was on the alert in a second, for
a scheme flashed through his mind with the quickness of lightning.</p>

<p>The faint noise showed that several new-comers had arrived on
the scene, and naturally a change in the current of conversation
followed. The wish of Lena-Wingo was to learn where these later
arrivals came from&mdash;whether from the other shore or whether they
were prowling up and down the bank, where they were now grouped.
To the whites, who could hear every word uttered, the talk of
course was incomprehensible; but the loudness of the tones, as
well as the rapidity and general jangle, led them to believe they
were angry about something that had taken or had failed to take
place, and that had produced a quarrel between them. Such was
the fact, and Lena-Wingo listened to the high words with the hope
that they would lead to blows, in which there would be a good
chance of the one who had slurred his courage receiving his deserts.</p>

<p>Those in the canoe, it seemed, had been stealing up and down
the shore, on the alert to detect the departure of the fugitives,
but, from some cause or other, failed to do their duty, and they
must have been quite a way off at the time the Mohawk put out
his awkward scow. The party on shore were angry because of the
failure, which was certainly a discreditable one, and they were
very ready to accuse their comrades of being "squaws" on the war-path.
The accused were equally ready to charge the others with being
"old women" for permitting the whites to land under their noses,
and to reach cover again. It would be hard to say which of the
companies was most to blame, and, as is the rule at such times,
each berated the other all the more on that account. The prospect
was promising for a deadly quarrel; but one or two in the party
appeared to be cool-headed, and they managed to quiet the rising
storm, much to the regret of the listening Mohawk.</p>

<p>It being clear to all the Iroquois that Lena-Wingo was too cunning
for them, although he had failed in carrying his charge across
the Susquehanna, it was plain that all his enemies could do was
to fix upon a plan to retrieve their own slip. And so, in full
hearing of the leader of the fugitives, they discussed their different
schemes. Lena-Wingo was not long in learning that there were plenty
of his enemies watching both sides of the river, and that it was
to be an undertaking of extreme difficulty for him to cross with
his friends. This did not lessen his determination, but rather
strengthened it, and he inwardly resolved that he himself would
place his three companions on the southeastern shore, if Colonel
Butler had his whole force of Indians and Tories arranged along
the bank to prevent it!</p>

<p>The consultation between the Iroquois lasted all of half an hour,
by which time they had decided what to do. They would all land
and scatter up and down the river's margin, thus covering as much
ground as possible, and watch for the moment when the whites would
come out of their cover again. In other words, they meant to patrol
the beach so vigilantly that it would be out of the power of the
fugitives to leave their hiding-place without detection and capture.</p>
