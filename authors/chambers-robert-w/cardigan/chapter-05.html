<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>To Fonda's Bush it is a good ten miles. I rode Sir William's
great horse, Warlock, who plunged and danced at the slap of my
sword-scabbard on his flanks, and wellnigh shook me from my boots.</p>

<p>"Spare spur, lad! Let him sniff the pistols!" called Sir William,
standing up in the broad hay-wagon to observe me. "He will quiet
when he smells the priming, Michael."</p>

<p>I drew one of my pistols from the holster and allowed Warlock
to sniff it, which he did, arching his neck and pricking forward
two wise ears. After this the horse and I understood each other,
he being satisfied that it was a real officer he bore and no lout
pranked out to shame him before other horses.</p>

<p>The broad flat hay-wagon, well bedded and deep in rye-straw,
was filled with the company on fishing bent; Peter and Esk already
disputing over their lines, red quills, and bob-floats; Silver
Heels, in flowered cotton damask and hair rolled up under a small
hat of straw, always observing me with lowered, uncertain eyes;
Mr. Duncan, in fustian coat and leggings, counting out fish-hooks;
Sir William, in yellow-and-brown buckskin and scarlet-flowered
waistcoat, singing lustily:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"A-Maying!<br/>
A-Maying!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the blackthorn and the broom<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the primrose are in bloom!"

</p>
</div>
<p>Behind the wagon, with punch-jugs swinging on his saddle-bags,
like John Gilpin rode young Bareshanks the Scot, all a-grin; while
upon either side of the wagon two mounted soldiers trotted, rifles
slung and hangers sheathed.</p>

<p>Thus we set out for Fonda's Bush, which is a vast woods, cut
into a hundred arabesques by the Kennyetto, a stream well named,
for in the Indian language it means "Snake-with-its-tail-in-its-mouth,"
and, although it flows for forty miles, the source of it is scarce
half a mile from the mouth, where it empties into the great Vlaie
near to Sir William's hunting-lodge.</p>

<p>In the wagon Sir William turned to the windows and waved his
hat at Mistress Molly, who stood behind the nursery curtains and
kissed her fingers to him. And, as the wagon with its escort rolled
off with slow wheels creaking, Mr. Duncan struck up:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Who hunts, doth oft in danger ride;<br/>
Who hawks, lures oft both far and wide;<br/>
Who uses games, may often prove<br/>
A loser; but who falls in love,<br/>
Is fettered in fond Cupid's snare;<br/>
My angle breeds me no such care."

</p>
</div>
<p>And Sir William and Mr. Duncan ended the song:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"The first men that our Saviour dear<br/>
Did choose to wait upon him here,<br/>
Blest Fishers were,&mdash;"

</p>
</div>
<p>The shrill voices of Esk and Peter joined in, then were hushed
as Silver Heels's dainty song grew from the silence like a fresh
breeze:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"For Courts are full of flattery<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As hath too oft been tried;<br/>
The City full of wantonness,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And both be full of Pride:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then care away,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wend along with me!"

</p>
</div>
<p>So singing on their rye-straw couches, the swaying wagon bore
them over the hilly road, now up, now rattling down-hill among
the stones to ford some ice-clear brook, and away again across
the rolling country, followed by Gillie Bareshanks, stone bottles
flopping, and the trotting soldiers holding their three-cornered
hats on with one hand, bridle-rein in t'other.</p>

<p>I galloped ahead, pistol poised, frowning at woodlands where
I pretended to myself danger might hide, examining all wayfarers
with impartial severity; and I doubt not that, seeing me in full
uniform and armed, my countenance filled them with misgivings;
indeed, some called out to know if the news from Boston was bad,
if the Indians meant mischief hereabouts, or if the highwayman,
Jack Mount, was abroad.</p>

<p>"Plague on your pistols!" shouted Sir William, as I waited at
a ford for the wagon. "Gad! Michael, your desperate deportment
is scaring my tenants along the way! Smile as you gallop, in Heaven's
name! else they'll take you for Jack Mount himself!"</p>

<p>Somewhat mortified by Sir William's roar of laughter, I trotted
on in silence, returning my pistol to its holster, and buckling
the flap.</p>

<p>We now entered the slashings of the forest which is called Fonda's
Bush, "bush" meaning land not yet cleared of woods. The sweet,
moist shadow of the forest cooled me; I made Warlock stop, for
I love to listen and linger in a woodland's quiet.</p>

<p>Here the field-birds which had sung everywhere by the roadside
were silent, as they always are on the borders of deep forests.
Slow hawks sailed along the edge of the woods; out in the clearing
a few finches twittered timidly in the sunshine, but here among
the hushed ranks of giant trees nothing stirred save green leaves.</p>

<p>But the solitude of forest depths is no solitude to those who
know when and where to watch and listen. Faint sounds came to
savant ears: the velvet rustle of a snake brushing its belly over
soft mosses; the padded patter of the fox-hare; the husky quhit!
quhit! of that ashy partridge whose eye is surmounted by a scarlet
patch, and whose flesh is bitter as hemlock. Solitude! Nay, for
the quick furry creatures that haunt water-ways live here, slipping
among bowlders, creeping through crevices; here a mink with eyes
like jet beads; here a whiskered otter peering from a cleft; now
a musk-rat squatting to wash his face; now a red martin thrashing
about in the thick tree-top like a mammoth squirrel at frolic.</p>

<p>If this be solitude, with the stream softly talking in that silly
babble which is a language, too; if this be solitude, with the
shy deer staring and the tiny wood-mouse in the windfall scraping
busily; if this be solitude, then imprison me here, and not in
the cities, where solitude is in men's hearts!</p>

<p>Five miles still lay before us over the moist, springy forest
road, an excellent and carefully constructed thoroughfare which
had been begun by Sir William and designed for a short and direct
route to those healing springs of Saratoga which he loved, twenty-eight
miles northeast of us. But this route had never been continued
east of Fonda's Bush, partly because the winding Kennyetto interfered
too often, demanding to be bridged a dozen times in a mile, partly
because an easier though longer route had been surveyed by the
engineer officers from Albany, and was already roughly marked
as far as the Diamond Hill, from which, in clear weather, the
Saratoga lake may be seen.</p>

<p>The road we travelled, therefore, came to an abrupt end on the
banks of the Kennyetto; and here, in a sunny clearing which was
a sugar-bush lately in use, the wagon and its passengers halted,
and I dismounted, flinging my bridle to one of the soldiers.</p>

<p>"Souse the stone jugs in the stream!" called out Sir William
to young Bareshanks, who came bumping up with his bottles a-knocking
and his hat crammed on his ears.</p>

<p>Peter and Esk wriggled out of the straw, fighting over a red
and blue bob-float, and fell with a thump upon the moss, locked
in conflict. Whereupon Sir William fetched them a clip with his
ivory cane across their buttocks, which brought them up snivelling,
but reconciled.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Duncan had gone to the bank of the stream with
six sharp pegs, all numbered; and presently Sir William joined
him, where they consulted seriously concerning the proper ground,
and took snuff and hummed and hawed with much wagging of heads
and many eye-squints at the sky and water.</p>

<p>At last, the question being settled, Mr. Duncan set the six pegs
ten yards apart and pushed them noiselessly down into the bank,
while Sir William removed his hat and placed in the crown six
bits of birch-bark with numbers written on each.</p>

<p>"Now, then, young wild-cats," he said, frowning at Esk and Peter,
"and you, Felicity, you, too, Mr. Duncan, and Michael, also, come
and draw lots for pegs. Zounds! Peter! Ladies first, sir! Now,
Felicity!"</p>

<p>Silver Heels placed one hand over her eyes and groped in the
hat until her fingers clutched a square of bark. Then she drew
it out.</p>

<p>"Number six!" she said, shyly.</p>

<p>"Last peg to the left," announced Sir William. "Who next? Draw,
Mr. Duncan!"</p>

<p>"Me! Me!" shouted Peter and Esk, charging at the hat and tearing
their numbers from it.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Duncan drew, and then I drew number five.</p>

<p>"Get ready!" commanded Sir William, fumbling with his fish-rod.
"Michael, take care of Felicity!"</p>

<p>Now the rules for a peg-down fishing match are few and simple.
Each contestant must fish from the position which his peg indicates,
and he must not leave his peg to fish elsewhere until the match
is ended. Furthermore, he must fish courteously and with due regard
for his neighbour's rights, employing no unfair means to attract
fish to his own bait or to drive them from his neighbour's. The
contestant securing the largest number of fish is the winner;
he who bags the largest single fish is adjudged worthy of a second
prize; he who secures the choicest individual fish receives a
crown of young oak leaves.</p>

<p>At the words, "Take your stations!" we trooped to our pegs. Silver
Heels was on the extreme left, I next, then Sir William, then
Mr. Duncan, then Peter, and, last of all, Esk.</p>

<p>"Fish!" cried Sir William, and swung his rod from the wrist,
sending a green and gray and scarlet feather-fly out into the
water.</p>

<p>Silver Heels held her hook out to me and I garnished it with
a bit of eel's skin and red flannel. My own line I baited with
angle-worm, and together we cast out into the slow, deep current.</p>

<p>Farther along I heard Esk and Peter cast out with some heedless
splashing, which was the occasion of mutual recrimination until
Sir William silenced them.</p>

<p>Yet almost immediately fat Peter caught a fish, which is like
all Indians. However, it was but a spiny sun-fish with blue and
scarlet and yellow gills. Still it made Peter's score one.</p>

<p>"Does that count?" asked Silver Heels, turning up her nose. "See!
Peter hath another one&mdash;a sun-fish, too! Pooh! Anybody can catch
sun-fish."</p>

<p>"Better catch 'em then," said Sir William, laughing, and drawing
his fly over the water to recover it for another cast.</p>

<p>Splash!&mdash;and Peter had a third sun-fish; and in another moment
Esk jerked a fourth from the water, secured his prize with a scowl
at Peter, and hurriedly rebaited, muttering and breathing thickly.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Duncan's yellow float bobbed under, once, twice, then
bobbed so fast that the water dimpled all around and the little
rings, spreading, succeeded each other so quickly that the wavelets
covered the yellow float.</p>

<p>"A barbel-pout," quoth Mr. Duncan, coolly, and sure enough up
came the bluish-black fish and flapped and squeaked, now on its
white belly, now on its back, grinning with its gummy, whiskered
maw agape and its three dagger fins ready to stab and poison him
who rashly grasped it.</p>

<p>"Silver Heels," said I, politely; "you are having a nibble."</p>

<p>"Oh, so I am!" she cried, and drew a lovely blue and silver frost-fish
to the surface, only to lose it by over-haste, and cry out in
her vexation.</p>

<p>I explained to her how to strike the hook before pulling in,
and she thanked me very modestly. There was a new and humble tone
in her voice, delicate and grateful flattery to me, due, as I
knew perfectly well, to my uniform. Nor did the tribute savour
of any after-sting of jealousy or resentment for my new honours.</p>

<p>She recognized that I had climbed high in a single day, leaving
the rounds of childhood behind forever; and she knew, too, which
I did not, that she also was climbing the ladder very swiftly,
a little behind me now, yet confident, and meaning to rejoin and
pass me ere I dreamed of such a thing.</p>

<p>About this time Sir William hooked and landed a great pink and
white Mohawk chub, which had risen silently from a black pool
and had sucked in his feather-fly.</p>

<p>"Tush!" said Sir William. "I'll not count that!" And with a slack
and a snip! he unhooked the fish, which at once slowly sank back
into the black channel. Whereupon Sir William smoothed out his
fly, and took snuff, singing merrily:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"A-Maying!<br/>
A-Maying!"

</p>
</div>
<p>"You bade <em>us</em> make no noise, sir," spoke up Esk, reproachfully.</p>

<p>"So I did, lad! So I did! But not with thy mouth. Shout all day,
and never a trout budges. Stamp thy feet&mdash;ay, brush but a stone
in passing, and it's farewell, master troutling! Ho! What was
that?"</p>

<p>A spattering and splashing arose from Peter's peg, and all turned
to see the fat little Mohawk dragging a trout from the water and
up the bank, where he fell upon the bouncing fish, whooping like
the savage he was.</p>

<p>"Clearly," mused Sir William, "my eye has lost its cunning, and
my arm its strength. So passes the generation that was born with
me! Heigh-ho! Well done, Peter boy!"</p>

<p>Silver Heels was doomed to ill-fortune. She lost a second frost-fish,
and was ready to weep. So I laid my rod on the bank, leaving the
baited hook in the water, and went over to her, for she seemed
discouraged, having broken her hook and quill.</p>

<p>"Fen dubs!" shouted Peter, from the other end of the line. "You
can't do that, Michael! I'm ahead of you all, and it is not fair!"</p>

<p>"Mind your business," said I, sitting down beside Silver Heels;
and truly enough he did, for, before I was seated, Peter jumped
up, struggling with a fat white perch, which he landed, yelling
and dancing in his vanity.</p>

<p>"Never you mind, Silver Heels," said I, tying a plated hook on
her line, and covering it with a long silvery strip of skin and
pin-feathers from a pullet's neck. "Now do as I say; toss the
bait down stream, so! Now draw it slowly till it spins like a
top."</p>

<p>Ere I could end my instructions I saw the nose of a great gold-green
pike close after her bait.</p>

<p>"Slack!" I whispered. "He has it!"</p>

<p>She held the rod still. There came a twitch, more twitches, but
so gentle you would have vowed 'twas a tender-mouthed minnow lipping
the line.</p>

<p>"He gorged it," I muttered; "strike hard!"</p>

<p>"A log!" wailed Silver Heels, as she felt the rod stagger when
the hook, deeply struck, embedded barb and shank.</p>

<p>But it was no log, for instantly the great fish shot into the
air, and lay a-wallowing and thrashing in mid-stream.</p>

<p>"A chain-pike!" cried Sir William, briskly. "Do you net him,
Michael, else Felicity will take a swim she has not bargained
for!"</p>

<p>I ran to Sir William, who thrust the net at me, and back again
as fast as my legs could move to Silver Heels, who had dropped
the rod and now, sprawling on the moss, lay a-pulling at the line
which was cutting her tender fingers.</p>

<p>"No fair!" bellowed fat Peter, jealously. "Let her bag her own
game as I do! Hi-yi! Another trout!"</p>

<p>But spite of Peter's clamour and Esk's injured howls, I netted
the floundering pike and flung it among the bushes, where young
Bareshanks gaffed it and held it aloft.</p>

<p>There it hung, all spray and green and gold, marked with the
devil's chain pattern; and its wolf-jaws gaping, lined with teeth.</p>

<p>"Oh, Michael," quavered Silver Heels, staring at her captive.
She moved a little nearer to the fish, plucking up her skirts
with her fingers, and bending forward, alarmed, amazed at the
fierce, dripping creature.</p>

<p>"Ugh! There's blood on it!" she whispered, taking fast hold of
my arm.</p>

<p>"Is it not a noble prize!" I urged, eagerly. But she shook her
head and turned away, holding me tightly by the sleeve.</p>

<p>"Are you not proud?" I persisted, irritably. "It is the biggest
fish any have yet caught. You will gain second prize, silly! What's
the matter with you, anyhow!" I added, in a temper.</p>

<p>"I can't help it," she said, tremulously; "I'm not a man, and
it frightens me to kill. I shall fish no more. Ugh&mdash;the blood!&mdash;and
how it quivered when the gillie gaffed it! I could cry my eyes
out for the life I took so lightly!"</p>

<p>I was disgusted and hurt, too, for I had thought to please her.
I drew my sleeve from her fingers, but she only stood there like
a simpleton harping on one string:</p>

<p>"Oh, the brave fish! Oh, the poor brave fish! I hurt it! &mdash;I
saw blood on it, Michael."</p>

<p>"Ninny," said I; "there is blood on your fingers, too, where
the line cut, and you've wiped it on my sleeve!"</p>

<p>She looked at her bleeding fingers in a silly, startled fashion,
then held them out to me so pitifully that I could do no less
than wipe them clean and bind them in my handkerchief, though
it was my best, and flowered and laced at that.</p>

<p>"I don't care," she said, a-pouting at the water; "you told me
that when you shot wild things it saddened you, too."</p>

<p>I pretended not to hear, yet it was true. And in sooth, to this
day I never draw trigger on beast or bird that I do not thrill
with pity.</p>

<p>I know not what fierce, resistless passion it may be that sets
my nostrils quivering like a pointer's when I chase wild things&mdash;what
savage craving drives me on, on, on! till the flash of the gun
and the innocent death leave me standing sad and staring.</p>

<p>Could I but keep from the woods&mdash;but I cannot. And it were vainer
to argue with a hound on a runway, or with the west wind in October,
than with me.</p>

<p>I went to my rod, which I saw nodding its tip in the water, and
found an eel fast to the bait, yet not hooked, so summoned Bareshanks
to rid me of the snaky thing and strolled sulkily over to Sir
William.</p>

<p>The Baronet had enticed and prettily netted a plump lake salmon,
by far the choicest fish taken; so, the match being ended, and
luncheon served under the pines, Silver Heels plaited a wreath
of red-oak, and crowned Sir William for his third prize.</p>

<p>Peter with his motley string of fish, some two dozen brace in
all, and mostly trout at that, clamoured for the first prize,
which was a Barlow-knife like the one Silver Heels had gained
in the foot-race a year ago; and he clutched his prize and straightway
fell a-hacking the wagon till Sir William collared him.</p>

<p>Silver Heels received the other reward, a gold guinea; and she
placed it in her bosom, and kissed Sir William heartily.</p>

<p>"Faith," said the Baronet, "you had best kiss your cousin yonder,
who saved you from a bath in the brook with your pike!"</p>

<p>Silver Heels came up to me, laying both hands on my shoulders,
and held up her lips. I kissed her maliciously and praised her
skill, vowing that she was a very Huron for slaughter, which boorish
jest set her face a sorrowful red.</p>

<p>Meanwhile young Bareshanks had laid a clean cloth upon the moss,
and there was pot-pie and roast capon, and a dish of apples and
gingerbread. Ale, too, and punch chilled in the brook, and small-beer
for the children, with a few drops of wine to drink Sir William's
health.</p>

<p>With a cup of ale in one hand and a slice of cold capon on a
trencher of bread, I munched and drank and rallied Silver Heels
because of her pity for the pike; but she did not like it, yet
ventured no retort, such as was formerly her custom.</p>

<p>Presently, Sir William having done scant justice to pot-pie and
ale, called for his rod and flies, and he and Mr. Duncan lighted
their pipes and strolled off along the stream to lure those small
plump salmon which abound in the Kennyetto's swiftest reaches.</p>

<p>Peter lay on the moss, a-stuffing himself Indian fashion until
it hurt him to eat more, and he howled and licked his gingercake,
lamenting because he could not contain it. So I grasped his heels
and dragged him to the wagon, tossing him up in the straw to lie
like a sucking pig and squeal his fill.</p>

<p>Bareshanks and the soldiers now fell upon the feast, and Silver
Heels and I withdrew to play at stick-knife and watch Esk that
he tumbled not into the water while turning flat rocks for cray-fish.</p>

<p>Seated there on the deep moss at stick-knife with the cold song
of the stream in our ears, we conducted politely as became our
quality, I asking pardon for plaguing her concerning the pike,
she granting pardon and praising my skill in taking such a monster
fish. That glow of amiability which suffuses man when he has fed,
warmed me into a most friendly state of mind, and I permitted
Silver Heels to win at stick-knife, and I drew the peg without
protest.</p>

<p>Fat Peter had fallen asleep; Esk, nipped by a cray-fish, waddled
to the wagon, and rolling himself into a ball like a raccoon,
joined Peter in dreams of surfeit.</p>

<p>In a distant glade the soldiers and young Bareshanks played at
cards; the horses, tethered near, snorted in their feed-bags,
and whisked their tails at the gnats and forest flies.</p>

<p>A hush fell upon the woods, stiller for the gossip of the stream.
Ringed pigeons in the trees overhead made low, melodious love;
far in the forest dusk the hermit-bird sang, but so faint, so
distant, that the whisper of leaves stirring effaced the hymn
of the gray recluse.</p>

<p>"I had not thought that you were so nearly a man to be appointed
cornet of horse," said Silver Heels, digging into the moss with
her knife.</p>

<p>"And you," said I, magnanimously, "are almost a woman." But I
said it from courtesy, not because I believed it.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, indifferently, "maids may wed at sixteen
years."</p>

<p>"Wed!" I repeated, laughing outright.</p>

<p>"Ay. Mother was a bride at sixteen."</p>

<p>I was silent in my effort to digest such an absurd idea. Silver
Heels marry in another year! I looked at the frail yet full arm,
half bared, the slender neck, the round, clear hazel eyes, the
faintly smiling mouth, which was the mouth of a child. Silver
Heels wed? The idea was grotesque. It was also displeasing.</p>

<p>Not to rebuff her with scorn, I said: "Indeed, you are quite
a woman. Perhaps in a year you will be one! Who knows?&mdash;for a
year is such a long, long time, Silver Heels."</p>

<p>"It is a very long time," she admitted.</p>

<p>"And to love, one must be quite old," said I.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true," she conceded, reluctantly; "but not always."</p>

<p>After a silence she said, "Michael, I have a secret."</p>

<p>The mere idea that Silver Heels possessed a secret which she
had not at once revealed to me produced a complicated sensation
in my breast. I was conscious of a sudden and wholly involuntary
respect for Silver Heels, a hearty resentment, and a gnawing curiosity
to learn the secret.</p>

<p>"Will you promise never, never to tell?" she asked, raising her
eager eyes to me.</p>

<p>Again resentment and hurt pride stung me, but curiosity prevailed,
and I promised, with pretended indifference, to soothe my weak
loss of self-respect.</p>

<p>"Well, then," she said, lowering her voice, "I am sure that Mr.
Butler is in love with me."</p>

<p>"Mr. Butler!" I cried out, in angry derision. "Why, he's an old
man! Why, he's nearly thirty!"</p>

<p>Angry incredulity choked me, and I sat scowling at Silver Heels
and striving to reconcile her serious mien with such a tomfool
speech.</p>

<p>"If you shout my secret aloud," she said, "I shall tell you no
more, Micky."</p>

<p>Again, troubled and astonished at her sincerity, I expressed
my disbelief in a growl.</p>

<p>"He keeps me after school hours," she said; "once he would caress
my hand, but I will have none of it. He sometimes speaks of the
future, and certainly does conduct in most romantic manners, vowing
he will wait for me, declaring that I must love him one day, that
I am no longer a child, that he has adored me since I was but
twelve."</p>

<p>"How long has this gone on?" I said, my face cold and twitching
with rage.</p>

<p>"These three months," said Silver Heels, without embarrassment.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and you never told me!"</p>

<p>She shook her head frankly.</p>

<p>"No, you were but a lad, and you could not understand such things."</p>

<p>For a moment I felt so small that I could have yelled aloud my
vexation. What! I too young to be told the secrets of this chit
of a child with her ridiculous airs and pretensions!</p>

<p>"But now that you are become a man," she continued, serenely,
"I thought to tell you of this, because it tries my patience,
yet pleases me, too, sometimes."</p>

<p>Boiling with fury and humiliation, I gave her a piece of my mind.
I said that Mr. Butler was a sneak, a bully, and an old fool in
his dotage to make love to a baby. I told her it did sicken me
to hear of it; that there was no truth in it but vain imaginings,
and that she had best confess to Sir William how this gentleman
school-teacher did teach her his knowledge withal!</p>

<p>She listened, frowning and digging up moss with her knife.</p>

<p>"He is not old," she said, firmly; "thirty years is but a youth's
prime, which you will one day comprehend."</p>

<p>Such condescension wellnigh finished me. I could find neither
tongue nor words to speak my passion.</p>

<p>"He is a gentleman of rank and station," she said, primly. "If
he chooses to protest his solicitous regard for me, I can but
courteously discourage him."</p>

<p>"You little prig!" I exclaimed, grinding my teeth. "I will teach
this fellow Butler to abuse Sir William's confidence!"</p>

<p>"I have your promise not to reveal this," said Silver Heels,
coolly.</p>

<p>I groaned, then remembering that Mr. Butler had partly promised
me a meeting, I caught Silver Heels by both hands and looked at
her earnestly.</p>

<p>"I also have a secret," said I. "Promise me silence, and you
shall share it."</p>

<p>"Truly?" she asked, a little pale.</p>

<p>"Truly, a secret. Promise. Silver Heels."</p>

<p>"I promise," she whispered.</p>

<p>Then I told her of my defiance, of the meeting which Mr. Butler
had half pledged me, and I swore to her that I would kill him,
eye to eye and hilt to hilt; not alone for his contempt and insults
to me, but for Sir William's honour and for the honour of my kinswoman.
Felicity Warren.</p>

<p>"The beast!" I snarled. "That he should come a-suing you without
a word to Sir William! Do gentlemen conduct in such a manner towards
gentlewomen? Now hear me! Do you swear to me upon your oath and
honour never to stay again after school, never to listen to another
word from this sneaking fellow until you are sixteen, never to
receive his addresses until Sir William speaks to you of him?
Swear it! Or I will go straight to Mr. Butler and strike him in
the face!"</p>

<p>"Micky, what are you saying? Sir William knows all this."</p>

<p>Taken aback, I dropped her hands, but in a moment seized them
again.</p>

<p>"Swear!" I repeated, crushing her hands. "I don't care what Sir
William says! Swear it!"</p>

<p>"I swear," she said, faintly. "You are hurting my fingers!"</p>

<p>She drew her hands from mine. Where the fishing-line had cut
a single drop of blood had been squeezed out again.</p>

<p>"First you bind my hand, then you tear it," she said, without
resentment. "It is like all men&mdash;to hurt, to heal, then wound
again."</p>

<p>I scarcely heard her, being occupied with my anger and my designs
against Mr. Butler. Such hatred as I now felt for him I never
had conceived could be cherished towards any living thing. My
right hand itched for a sword-hilt; I longed to see him facing
me as I never had craved for anything in this world or the next.
And to think that Sir William approved it!</p>

<p>Unconsciously we had both risen, and now, side by side, we were
moving slowly along the stream, saying nothing, yet in closer
communion than we had ever been.</p>

<p>Little by little the hot anger cooled in my veins, leaving a
refreshing confidence that all would come right. Such passions
are too powerful for young hearts. Anger and grief heal their
own wounds quickly when life is yet new.</p>

<p>With my sudden, astonished respect for Silver Heels came another
sentiment, a recognition of her rights as an equal, and a strangely
solicitous desire to control and direct her enjoyment of these
rights. It is the instinct of chivalry, latent in the roughest
of us, and which, in extreme youth, first manifests as patronage.
Thus, walking with Silver Heels I unburdened my heart, telling
her that I too had been in love, that the object of my respectful
passion was one Marie Livingston, who would undoubtedly be mine
at some distant date. I revealed my desire to see Silver Heels
suitably plighted, drawing a pleasing portrait of an imaginary
suitor who should fill all requirements.</p>

<p>To this she replied that she, too, had desired a suitor resembling
the highly attractive portrait I had painted for her; that she
found a likeness between that portrait and her secret ideal, and
that she should be very glad to encounter the portrait in the
flesh.</p>

<p>It hurt me a little that she had not recognized in me many of
the traits I had painted for her so carefully, and presently I
disclosed myself as the mysterious original of the portrait.</p>

<p>"You!" she exclaimed, in amazement. Then, not to hurt me, she
said it was quite true that I did resemble her ideal, and only
lacked years and titles and wealth and reputation to make me desirable
for her.</p>

<p>"I believe, also," she said, "that Aunt Molly means that we marry.
Betty says so, and she is wiser than a black cat."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "we can't marry, can we, Silver Heels?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," she said, simply; "there's all those things you lack."</p>

<p>"And all those things which you lack," said I, sharply. "Now,
Marie Livingston&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She is older than I!" cried Silver Heels.</p>

<p>"And those things I lack come with years!" I retorted.</p>

<p>"That is true," she answered; "you are suitable for me excepting
your years, which includes all you ought to be."</p>

<p>"Suppose you wait for me?" I proposed. "If I wed not Marie Livingston,
I will wed you, Silver Heels."</p>

<p>I meant to be generous, but she grew very angry and vowed she
would rather wed young Bareshanks than me.</p>

<p>"I don't care a fig," said I; "I only meant you to be suitably
wed one day, and was even willing to do so myself to save you
from Captain Butler. Anyway I'll kill him next year, so I don't
care whether you marry me or not."</p>

<p>"A sorry match, pardieu!" she snapped, and fell a-laughing. "Michael,
I will warn you now that I mean to wed a gentleman of rank and
wealth, and wear jewels which will blind you! And I shall wed
a gallant gentleman of years, Michael, and scarred with battles&mdash;not
so to disfigure a pleasing countenance, but under his clothes
where none can see&mdash;and I shall be 'my lady!'&mdash;mark me! Michael,
and shall be well patched and powdered as befits my rank! I shall
strive to be very kind to you, Michael."</p>

<p>Her cheeks were aflame, her eyes daring and bright. She picked
up her skirt and mocked me in a curtsey, then marched off, nose
in the wind, to join Sir William and Mr. Duncan, who were returning
along the bank with a few brace of fish.</p>

<p>The sun had dropped low behind the trees ere we were prepared
to depart. Bareshanks brought around my horse, and I mounted without
difficulty this time.</p>

<p>As the wagon moved off Mr. Duncan started a hymn of Watts, which
all joined, the soldiers and young Bareshanks also singing lustily,
it being permitted for servants to aid in holy song.</p>

<p>So among the woods and out into the still country, with the sun
a red ball sinking through saffron mist and the new moon aslant
and dim overhead.</p>

<p>As I rode, the whippoorwill called after me from the darkening
woods; the crickets began from every tuft, and far away I heard
the solitary hermit at vespers in the still pines.</p>

<p>It was night ere the lights of Johnstown glimmered out against
the hill-side where, on the hillock called Mount Johnson, the
candles in our windows spun little rings of fire in the evening
haze.</p>

<p>As we passed through the village, the good people turned to smile
and to doff their hats to Sir William, thinking not less of him
for riding with his flock in the straw-lined wagon, and on they
went; I pulling rein at the blacksmith's, as Warlock had cast
a shoe on the stony way below.</p>

<p>While the smith was at his forge I dismounted and stood in the
fire-glow, stroking Warlock's velvet nose, and watching the fiery
flakes falling from the beaten metal.</p>

<p>And as I stood, musing now on Silver Heels, now on Mr. Butler,
came one a-swaggering by the shop, and bawling loudly a most foolish
lilt:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Diddle diddle dumpling,<br/>
My son John<br/>
Went to bed with one shoe on;<br/>
One shoe off and one shoe on;<br/>
Diddle diddle dumpling,<br/>
My son John!"

</p>
</div>
<p>Perceiving me in full uniform the songster halted and saluted
so cheerfully that I rendered his salute with a smile. He was
drunk but polite; a great fellow, six feet two at least, all buckskin
and swagger and raccoon cap, with tail bobbing to his neck, a
true coureur-de-bois, which is the term for those roaming free-rifles
whose business and conduct will not always bear investigation,
and who live by their wits as well as by their rifles.</p>

<p>"A fine horse, captain," quoth he, with good-natured, drunken
freedom, which is not possible for gentlemen to either ignore
or resent. "A fine horse, sir, and, by your leave, worthy of his
master!" And he stood swaying there heel and toe, with such a
jolly laugh that I laughed too, and asked the news from Canada.</p>

<p>"Canada!" he roared, in his voice of a giant. "I've not sniffed
priest or Jesuit these six months! Do you take me for a Frenchy,
captain?"</p>

<p>At that moment another man who had been pushing his nose against
the window of a bake-shop crossed the street and joined the giant
in buckskin, saluting me carelessly as he came up.</p>

<p>He was short and meagre and weasel-eyed, sharp-muzzled, and dingy
as a summer fox. He was also drunk, yet his mouth was honest,
and I judge not from such things, nor yet by the eye, but by men's
lips and how they rest one upon the other, and how they laugh.</p>

<p>Waiting there for my horse, I paced up and down the doorway,
sometimes glancing at the motley pair in their fringed buckskins,
who were fondly embracing one another, sometimes watching the
towns-people, passing before the lighted windows. There were soldiers
strolling, two by two, lingering at bake-shops to sniff the ovens;
there were traders, come to town to solicit permits from Sir William
for the Canadas. At times the tall, blanketed form of a Mohawk
passed like a spectre with the red forge light running along his
rifle barrel, followed by his squaw, loaded with bags of flour,
or a haunch of salted beef, or a bale of pelts crackling on her
back.</p>

<p>My pair of buckskin birds, loitering before the tavern, had been
observed and mistaken for French trappers by half a dozen soldiers
of the Royal Americans, who were squatting in a row on the tavern
porch, and a volley of chaff was fired at short range.</p>

<p>"Mossoo! Oh, Mossoo! I say, Mossoo! How's Mrs. Parleyvoo and
the little Parleyvoos? What's the price of cat-stew in Canada?
Take that cat-tail off your cap, Mossoo!"</p>

<p>The big ranger gave them a drunken stare, then burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>"Why, it's some of those lobster-backs. Hello! Old red-bellies!
They're going to give another tea-party in Boston, I hear. Didn't
they invite you?"</p>

<p>"Come across the street and we'll give you a tea-party, you damned
Yankee!" cried the soldiers, unbuckling their leather belts and
swinging them.</p>

<p>"Come over here and we'll drum the rogue's march on you!" shouted
the little ranger, planting his legs wide apart and drawing the
ramrod from his long rifle.</p>

<p>A watchman with rattle, pike, and lanthorn came hobbling up,
threatening to sound his call. A group of towns-people gathered
behind him, protesting against the disturbance.</p>

<p>But the two rangers flourished their ramrods and taunted the
soldiers with inquiries which I did not understand at the time,
such as: "How's Bully Tryon and his blood-pudding?" "I learn that
Tommy Gage has the gout; too much Port-Bill; he needs bleeding,
does Tommy Gage!"</p>

<p>Then the big ranger, addressing soldiers, watchman, and towns-people
as "bloody-backs," "cow-rumps," and "scratch-wigs," advised them
all to pickle their heads and sell them in Albany, where cabbage
was much esteemed among the Dutchmen.</p>

<p>"Come up to the barracks and we'll show you what pickling is,"
shouted the soldiers, wrathfully.</p>

<p>"Come out in the woods and I'll show you something to beat pickled
pig!" replied the little ranger, cheerfully.</p>

<p>Behind me I heard the trample of hoofs; the smith was backing
Warlock out into the street. I paid him; he held my stirrup, and
I mounted, walking my horse out between the soldiers, the people,
and the two rangers.</p>

<p>"Come, boys," said I, pleasantly, "this town is no place for
brawls. Let it end here&mdash;do you understand?&mdash;or Sir William shall
learn of it!"</p>

<p>The soldiers had stepped forward to salute, the two rangers laughed
scornfully, flung their rifles over their shoulders, and passed
on into the darkness with noiseless, moccasined stride.</p>

<p>Waiting to see that the crowd dispersed without disorder, far
down the dim street I heard the two rangers break out into a foolish
catch:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Who comes here?<br/>
A grenadier!<br/>
What d'ye lack?<br/>
A pot o' beer!<br/>
Where's your penny?<br/>
I forgot&mdash;<br/>
Get you gone, you red-coat sot!"

</p>
</div>
<p>A most uncomfortable sensation came over me, although I did not
fully understand that "red-coat" was a reproach. But the loose
laughter, the disrespectful tone, the devil-may-care swagger of
these fellows disturbed me. What had they meant by "lobster-back"
and "Tommy Gage" and "Bully Tryon?" Surely they could not have
referred to General Gage of Boston or to our Governor! Did they
mean Sir William's son, John, by their "diddle dumpling?" What
quarrel had they with the King's soldiers? They had been courteous
enough to me, unless they intended their song as an insult.</p>

<p>The blood stung my face; I put Warlock to a gallop and overtook
the pair. They were arm in arm, swaggering along, ogling the towns-people,
jostling the crowd, sometimes mocking the bare shanks of a Highlander,
sometimes hustling an Indian, or tweaking the beard of a Jew peddler,
now doffing their caps to some pretty maid, now digging the ribs
of a sober Quaker, and ever singing of "diddle diddle dumpling"
or of the grenadier and his pot of beer.</p>

<p>Such license and freedom displeased me. I had never before observed
it in our town or among those who came to the Hall. However, I
now saw that I could not with dignity notice either their boorish
gallantry, their mischief, or the songs they were pleased to bawl
out in the street.</p>

<p>I therefore passed them in silence, and, loosening bridle, set
Warlock at a gallop for home.</p>

<p>I did not comprehend it at the time; indeed, the whole matter
passed from my mind ere the lights of the Hall broke out in the
blue night. Yet the scene I had witnessed was my first view of
the unrest which tormented the whole land, the first symptom of
that new fever for which no remedy had yet been found.</p>
