<p>But where was he going?  He began to come out of his trance of
delight and liberty.  Deep within him he felt the steady burning of
shame in the flesh.  As yet he could not bear to think of it.  But
there it was, submerged beneath his attention, the raw, steady-
burning shame.</p>

<p>It behoved him to be intelligent.  As yet he dared not remember
what he had done.  He only knew the need to get away, away from
everything he had been in contact with.</p>

<p>But how?  A great pang of fear went through him.  He could not bear
his shamed flesh to be put again between the hands of authority.
Already the hands had been laid upon him, brutally upon his
nakedness, ripping open his shame and making him maimed, crippled
in his own control.</p>

<p>Fear became an anguish.  Almost blindly he was turning in the
direction of the barracks.  He could not take the responsibility of
himself.  He must give himself up to someone.  Then his heart,
obstinate in hope, became obsessed with the idea of his sweetheart.
He would make himself her responsibility.</p>

<p>Blenching as he took courage, he mounted the small, quick-hurrying
tram that ran out of the town in the direction of the barracks.  He
sat motionless and composed, static.</p>

<p>He got out at the terminus and went down the road.  A wind was
still running.  He could hear the faint whisper of the rye, and the
stronger swish as a sudden gust was upon it.  No one was about.
Feeling detached and impersonal, he went down a field-path between
the low vines.  Many little vine trees rose up in spires, holding
out tender pink shoots, waving their tendrils.  He saw them
distinctly and wondered over them.  In a field a little way off,
men and women were taking up the hay.  The bullock-waggon stood by
on the path, the men in their blue shirts, the women with white
cloths over their heads carried hay in their arms to the cart, all
brilliant and distinct upon the shorn, glowing green acres.  He
felt himself looking out of darkness on to the glamorous, brilliant
beauty of the world around him, outside him.</p>

<p>The Baron's house, where Emilie was maidservant, stood square and
mellow among trees and garden and fields.  It was an old French
grange.  The barracks was quite near.  Bachmann walked, drawn by a
single purpose, towards the courtyard.  He entered the spacious,
shadowy, sun-swept place.  The dog, seeing a soldier, only jumped
and whined for greeting.  The pump stood peacefully in a corner,
under a lime tree, in the shade.</p>

<p>The kitchen door was open.  He hesitated, then walked in, speaking
shyly and smiling involuntarily.  The two women started, but with
pleasure.  Emilie was preparing the tray for afternoon coffee.  She
stood beyond the table, drawn up, startled, and challenging, and
glad.  She had the proud, timid eyes of some wild animal, some
proud animal.  Her black hair was closely banded, her grey eyes
watched steadily.  She wore a peasant dress of blue cotton sprigged
with little red roses, that buttoned tight over her strong maiden
breasts.</p>

<p>At the table sat another young woman, the nursery governess, who
was picking cherries from a huge heap, and dropping them into a
bowl.  She was young, pretty, freckled.</p>

<p>&quot;Good day!&quot; she said pleasantly.  &quot;The unexpected.&quot;</p>

<p>Emilie did not speak.  The flush came in her dark cheek.  She still
stood watching, between fear and a desire to escape, and on the
other hand joy that kept her in his presence.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, bashful and strained, while the eyes of the two
women were upon him.  &quot;I've got myself in a mess this time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; asked the nursery governess, dropping her hands in her lap.
Emilie stood rigid.</p>

<p>Bachmann could not raise his head.  He looked sideways at the
glistening, ruddy cherries.  He could not recover the normal world.</p>

<p>&quot;I knocked Sergeant Huber over the fortifications down into the
moat,&quot; he said.  &quot;It was an accident - but - &quot;</p>

<p>And he grasped at the cherries, and began to eat them, unknowing,
hearing only Emilie's little exclamation.</p>

<p>&quot;You knocked him over the fortifications!&quot; echoed Fr&auml;ulein Hesse in
horror.  &quot;How?&quot;</p>

<p>Spitting the cherry-stones into his hand, mechanically, absorbedly,
he told them.</p>

<p>&quot;Ach!&quot; exclaimed Emilie sharply.</p>

<p>&quot;And how did you get here?&quot; asked Fr&auml;ulein Hesse.</p>

<p>&quot;I ran off,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>There was a dead silence.  He stood, putting himself at the mercy
of the women.  There came a hissing from the stove, and a stronger
smell of coffee.  Emilie turned swiftly away.  He saw her flat,
straight back and her strong loins, as she bent over the stove.</p>

<p>&quot;But what are you going to do?&quot; said Fr&auml;ulein Hesse, aghast.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; he said, grasping at more cherries.  He had come to
an end.</p>

<p>&quot;You'd better go to the barracks,&quot; she said.  &quot;We'll get the Herr
Baron to come and see about it.&quot;</p>

<p>Emilie was swiftly and quietly preparing the tray.  She picked it
up, and stood with the glittering china and silver before her,
impassive, waiting for his reply.  Bachmann remained with his head
dropped, pale and obstinate.  He could not bear to go back.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm going to try to get into France,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but they'll catch you,&quot; said Fr&auml;ulein Hesse.</p>

<p>Emilie watched with steady, watchful grey eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I can have a try, if I could hide till to-night,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Both women knew what he wanted.  And they all knew it was no good.
Emilie picked up the tray, and went out.  Bachmann stood with his
head dropped.  Within himself he felt the dross of shame and
incapacity.</p>

<p>&quot;You'd never get away,&quot; said the governess.</p>

<p>&quot;I can try,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>To-day he could not put himself between the hands of the military.
Let them do as they liked with him to-morrow, if he escaped to-day.</p>

<p>They were silent.  He ate cherries.  The colour flushed bright into
the cheek of the young governess.</p>

<p>Emilie returned to prepare another tray</p>

<p>&quot;He could hide in your room,&quot; the governess said to her.</p>

<p>The girl drew herself away.  She could not bear the intrusion.</p>

<p>&quot;That is all I can think of that is safe from the children,&quot; said
Fr&auml;ulein Hesse.</p>

<p>Emilie gave no answer.  Bachmann stood waiting for the two women.
Emilie did not want the close contact with him.</p>

<p>&quot;You could sleep with me,&quot; Fr&auml;ulein Hesse said to her.</p>

<p>Emilie lifted her eyes and looked at the young man, direct, clear,
reserving herself.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you want that?&quot; she asked, her strong virginity proof against
him.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes - yes - &quot; he said uncertainly, destroyed by shame.</p>

<p>She put back her head.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she murmured to herself.</p>

<p>Quickly she filled the tray, and went out.</p>

<p>&quot;But you can't walk over the frontier in a night,&quot; said Fr&auml;ulein
Hesse.</p>

<p>&quot;I can cycle,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Emilie returned, a restraint, a neutrality, in her bearing.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll see if it's all right,&quot; said the governess.</p>

<p>In a moment or two Bachmann was following Emilie through the square
hall, where hung large maps on the walls.  He noticed a child's
blue coat with brass buttons on the peg, and it reminded him of
Emilie walking holding the hand of the youngest child, whilst he
watched, sitting under the lime tree.  Already this was a long way
off.  That was a sort of freedom he had lost, changed for a new,
immediate anxiety.</p>

<p>They went quickly, fearfully up the stairs and down a long
corridor.  Emilie opened her door, and he entered, ashamed, into
her room.</p>

<p>&quot;I must go down,&quot; she murmured, and she departed, closing the door
softly.</p>

<p>It was a small, bare, neat room.  There was a little dish for holy-
water, a picture of the Sacred Heart, a crucifix, and a prie-Dieu.
The small bed lay white and untouched, the wash-hand bowl of red
earth stood on a bare table, there was a little mirror and a small
chest of drawers.  That was all.</p>

<p>Feeling safe, in sanctuary, he went to the window, looking over the
courtyard at the shimmering, afternoon country.  He was going to
leave this land, this life.  Already he was in the unknown.</p>

<p>He drew away into the room.  The curious simplicity and severity of
the little Roman Catholic bedroom was foreign but restoring to him.
He looked at the crucifix.  It was a long, lean, peasant Christ
carved by a peasant in the Black Forest.  For the first time in his
life, Bachmann saw the figure as a human thing.  It represented a
man hanging there in helpless torture.  He stared at it, closely,
as if for new knowledge.</p>

<p>Within his own flesh burned and smouldered the restless shame.  He
could not gather himself together.  There was a gap in his soul.
The shame within him seemed to displace his strength and his
manhood.</p>

<p>He sat down on his chair.  The shame, the roused feeling of
exposure acted on his brain, made him heavy, unutterably heavy.</p>

<p>Mechanically, his wits all gone, he took off his boots, his belt,
his tunic, put them aside, and lay down, heavy, and fell into a
kind of drugged sleep.</p>

<p>Emilie came in a little while, and looked at him.  But he was sunk
in sleep.  She saw him lying there inert, and terribly still, and
she was afraid.  His shirt was unfastened at the throat.  She saw
his pure white flesh, very clean and beautiful.  And he slept
inert.  His legs, in the blue uniform trousers, his feet in the
coarse stockings, lay foreign on her bed.  She went away.</p>
