<p>It is quite probable that General Yozarro felt himself unequal
to the situation, for he said nothing more. He could plainly be
seen standing out in front of his friends, who, he noted, were
busy at something. They were hoisting the sail of the catboat
and the whole party scrambled aboard, as it was shoved from shore.
Their weight sank the craft low, but it buoyed them safely, and
the smaller craft began its pursuit of the larger one, somewhat
after the manner of a handcar chasing a locomotive.</p>

<p>As before, there was no comparison in their speed, despite the
fact that the tug had slowed down considerably. Major Starland
ordered the Captain to hold their relative position. His contempt
for the ruffian Dictator was so deep that he could not forbear
exulting over him.</p>

<p>The men in the fire room knew that they had no choice except
to obey the orders sent down to them. No responsibility could
attach to them, and the American would visit fearful punishment
upon any disobedience or treachery.</p>

<p>Guzman and Martella came to the upper deck, where Major Starland
was holding converse with Captain Ortega.</p>

<p>"I wish," said the Major, speaking too low for the Captain to
hear him, "you would find out how many are in the boat yonder.
I make it six."</p>

<p>The three gave several minutes to scrutiny and agreed there were
seven, which was more than had been supposed.</p>

<p>"And all are heavily armed, some with pistols and some with swords;
if they should come alongside, they could give us a pretty fight."</p>

<p>Captain Guzman took it upon himself to say:</p>

<p>"General Yozarro and Captain Sepulveda&mdash;if he is there&mdash;are the
biggest cowards in the Atlamalcan army, but the others are fighters.
I know three of them who are worse than tiger cats. They are eager
for a chance to attack us."</p>

<p>"And they should have it, but for two reasons: it will be too
great a trial for my sister. We could beat them off, except for
the danger in our rear."</p>

<p>The two looked inquiringly at the American.</p>

<p>"That Captain at the wheel is one of the bravest of men. He is
devoted to General Yozarro, or at least holds him in fear; the
moment he gained a chance to strike a blow for him he would strike
hard, no matter at what risk to himself."</p>

<p>"He carries no arms; he has no chance."</p>

<p>"He may know where he can lay hand on a weapon; if he attacked
us behind, while we were repelling boarders&mdash;as I am sure he would&mdash;the
jig would be up. So I have ordered him to keep the present distance
between us and their boat. After awhile, we shall pull away from
them."</p>

<p>There was no driving off the uneasiness regarding Captain Ortega.
Starland sauntered over to the pilot house, and, with assumed
carelessness, kept furtive watch of the man. He could see nothing
suspicious in his deportment. He had flung away his cigarette,
and both hands were upon the spokes of the wheel, which now and
then were shifted slightly as cause arose. He peered keenly ahead,
for the bifurcated river has its treacherous places, like our
own Mississippi, and he who guides so large a craft in its current
has need to keep his wits about him. The moonlight gave a fine
view of the broad stream, and the Captain seemed to feel no interest
in anything else.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether he is up to mischief or not," reflected
the American; "if he is, he is mighty sly. Let him try to play
me false and I won't hesitate a minute to shoot him."</p>

<p>The Major looked toward the other boat, which instead of trailing
directly at the rear, was following a parallel course, about half
way between the tug and the southern shore, and some two hundred
yards to the rear. Filled with so many men, the craft looked like
a variegated bouquet floating down the muddy Rio Rubio.</p>

<p>It was the fact that General Yozarro maintained a pursuit which,
in the nature of things, was hopeless, that caused Major Starland
misgiving. It must be that the Dictator was counting upon some
move in his favor by the Captain of the tug, which held the former
to his course, and the latter was biding his time. Studying hard,
the American could think of no scheme which promised the slightest
success in this direction, but none the less, he was convinced
that something was on foot, and that it could be frustrated only
by alertness on his own part.</p>

<p>In this uncomfortable frame of mind, he came down from the upper
deck and followed his two friends forward, where they were leaning
against the pile of wood near the gun. Both were smoking and occasionally
glancing up at the pilot house, as if they too were apprehensive
of the man, whose head and shoulders were in sight. He had resumed
smoking and the tip of his cigarette glowed in the moonlight.</p>

<p>The three stood for a few minutes without speaking, when Martella
straightened up and asked in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Have you noticed, Major, that our speed has increased within
the last few minutes?"</p>

<p>The American looked off over the water and then at the shore,
but could see nothing to enlighten him.</p>

<p>"The other boat is falling behind," said Captain Guzman.</p>

<p>Glancing at the smaller craft, all doubt was instantly removed.
The tug was steadily drawing away from it.</p>

<p>"Captain," he called, looking up at the pilot house; "we are
going too fast; slacken your speed."</p>

<p>"As you please, Se√±or; I beg your pardon."</p>

<p>The signal was sent down to the engineer, who quickly brought
about a diminution in the progress of the tug.</p>

<p>"Probably it was unintentional&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment, all felt a jar through the craft, accompanied
by such a rapid slackening of pace that the three took an involuntary
step forward.</p>

<p>"We've run aground!" exclaimed Starland.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt of it," calmly added Martella.</p>
