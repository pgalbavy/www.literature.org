<p>Almost everybody liked Frisky Squirrel, he was such a happy little
fellow. But there were a few of the forest-people with whom Frisky
never was able to make friends. <u>They</u> were the disagreeable, selfish
kind, who never liked anyone except themselves.
</p>
<p>Freddie Weasel was one of the few with whom Frisky Squirrel never
could have a good time. Frisky often tried to play with him. But their
games always ended in trouble; and I must say that it was not Frisky's
fault.
</p><p>Now, Frisky had often heard it said among his neighbors that no one
had ever caught Freddie Weasel asleep. Indeed, Jimmy Rabbit claimed
that Freddie Weasel never slept at all.
</p><p>That seemed very strange to Frisky. He could hardly believe it. And he
made up his mind that he would watch Freddie Weasel and see whether it
was really true.
</p><p>So one evening, just after sundown, when Frisky met Freddie Weasel in
the woods, he thought it would be a good time to spy upon him. Of
course it wasn't at all a polite thing to do. But Frisky was very
curious. And anyhow, he meant no harm.
</p><p>"Hello, Freddie!" he said, as he came face to face with the sly, slim
chap.
</p><p>"Hello, yourself!" said Freddie Weasel in a disagreeable tone.
</p><p>"Where you going?" Frisky inquired pleasantly enough.
</p><p>"Never you mind," Freddie Weasel answered. "And you'd better keep out
of my way, or I'll bite your head off."
</p><p>Frisky Squirrel didn't know what to say. Very few people--except Jasper
Jay and one or two other quarrelsome forest-folk--had ever spoken to
him like that. So he just stood still and stared.
</p><p>That seemed to make Freddie angrier than ever. He darted toward Frisky
and tried to bite his neck. But Frisky was quick, too. He ran up a tree
before Freddie Weasel could catch him, and smiled at the bad-tempered
fellow.
</p><p>"You'd better go home and take a nap," Frisky told him. "You're
crosser than ever to-day."
</p><p>Freddie looked up at Frisky as if he would just like to get hold of
him for about one second.
</p><p>"I never sleep," he said. "I'm always awake. And some night when
you're dreaming, I'm coming to your house and I'm going to eat you."
And then he hurried away.
</p><p>Frisky Squirrel ran down the tree and dashed after Freddie. He didn't
make any noise at all. And he was careful not to let Freddie see him.
He was going to find out for himself whether Freddie stayed awake all
night.
</p><p>Mrs. Squirrel was worried because Frisky didn't come home. Of course
he ought to have let her know what he was about. But he felt that he
mustn't lose sight of Freddie. And he saw no one at all by whom he
could send word to his mother as to where he was and what he was
doing.
</p><p>Frisky had the busiest sort of time following Freddie. It grew so dark
that it was very hard to see Freddie Weasel as he sneaked along
through the bushes, hunting for small birds that build their nests on
the ground.
</p><p>Freddie Weasel caught several sleeping birds. And Frisky could not
help being sorry for them. He began to feel very guilty for having
teased them, and for having eaten their eggs.
</p><p>Finally it grew so dark that Frisky had just about decided that he
would have to give up spying on Freddie and hurry home, when he saw
Freddie slip into a hole in a bank and vanish.
</p><p>Was Freddie Weasel at last going to bed and to sleep?
