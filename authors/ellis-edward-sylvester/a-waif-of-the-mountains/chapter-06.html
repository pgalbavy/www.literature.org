<p>The group looked at Wade Ruggles in breathless amazement. He
had invited them to the bar to join in celebrating his release
from thralldom; all had filled their glasses and he had raised
his own to his lips, though several noticed that there was only
a small amount of liquid in the tumbler. Then, when every glass
was upraised and there was a general gurgling, he had turned his
glass upside down and spilled every drop on the floor.</p>

<p>Before anyone could think of suitable terms in which to express
his emotions, Wade said, with a smile that rather added than detracted
from his seriousness:</p>

<p>"Pards, never again does a drop of that stuff go down my throat!
I've suffered hell, but I've come out of the flames, and the one
that fetched me through is the little gal which lays asleep in
the next room."</p>

<p>He did not attempt to deliver a temperance lecture to his friends,
nor did they trifle with him. They questioned him closely as to
how he had reached this extraordinary decision, and he gave a
vivid and truthful account of his experience. It made several
of the men thoughtful, but most of them felt dubious about his
persistence in the new path he had laid out for himself.</p>

<p>"You know, boys, whether I've got a will of my own," he quietly
replied; "just wait and see how this thing comes out."</p>

<p>It was noticed that Parson Brush was the most interested inquirer,
and, though he had comparatively little to say, he left the Bower
unusually early. He had begun his system of instruction with Nellie
Dawson, and reported that she was making remarkably good progress.
Had the contrary been the fact, it may be doubted whether it would
have been safe for him to proclaim it.</p>

<p>And now the scene changes. It is the close of a radiant summer
day in the Sierras. Far down in the cañon-like chasm between the
mountainous spurs, nestled the little mining settlement, which
had been christened but a short time before, New Constantinople.
Here and there tiny wounds had been gouged into the ribs of the
mountain walls, and the miners were pecking away with pick and
shovel, deepening the hurts in their quest for the yellow atoms
or dark ore which had been the means of bringing every man thousands
of miles to the spot.</p>

<p>Far up toward the clouds were the towering, craggy peaks, with
many a rent and yawn and table-land and lesser elevation, until,
as if to check the climbing ambition of the prodigious monster,
nature had flung an immense blanket of snow, whose ragged and
torn edges lapped far down the sides of the crests. Ages ago the
chilling blanket was tucked around the mountain tops, there to
remain through the long stretch of centuries to follow.</p>

<p>Down the valley, at the bottom of the winding cañon, the air
palpitated with the fervor of the torrid zone. He who attempted
to plod forward panted and perspired, but a little way up the
mountain side, the cool breath crept downward from the regions
of perpetual ice and snow, through the balsamic pines and cedars,
with a revivifying power that was grateful to all who felt its
life-giving embrace.</p>

<p>The sun hovered in a sky of unclouded azure. It shot its arrows
into the gullies, ravines and gorges, but made no impression on
the frozen covering far up in cloudland itself. Long pointed ravelings
on the lower edge of the mantle showed where some of the snow
had turned to water, which changed again to ice, when the sun
dipped below the horizon.</p>

<p>The miners were pigmies as they toiled in the sides of the towering
mountain walls, where they had toiled for many a day. On the lip
of a projecting crag, half a mile above were three other pigmies,
who neither toiled nor spun. Viewed through a glass, it was seen
that they wore stained feathers in their black hair dangling about
their shoulders, with the blankets wrapped round their forms descending
to their moccasined feet. They were watching in grim silence these
proofs of the invasion of their homes by the children of another
race, and mayhap were conjuring some scheme for driving them back
into the great sea across which they had sailed to occupy the
new land.</p>

<p>One of the Indians was a chieftain. He had come in violent contact
with these hated creatures and he bore on his person the scars
of such meeting. All carried bows and arrows, though others of
their tribe had learned the use of the deadly firearms, which
has played such havoc with the American race.</p>

<p>Suddenly the chief uttered an exclamation. Then drawing an arrow
from the quiver over his shoulder, he fitted it to the string
of his long bow, and pointing downward toward the group of miners,
launched the shaft. Except for the power of gravity, it would
have been a foolhardy effort, but guided by the wisp of feather
twisted around the reed, the missile spun far outward over the
cañon, and dived through the vast reach of space, as if it were
endowed with life and determined to seek out and pierce the intruders.
The black eyes of the three warriors followed the arrow until
it was only a flickering speck, far below them; but, before that
moment arrived, they saw that it was speeding wide of the mark.
When at last, the sharp point struck the flinty rock, and the
missile doubled over upon itself and dropped harmlessly to the
bottom of the cañon, it was at such a distance from the miners,
that they knew nothing of it. They never looked up, nor were they
aware of the futile anger of the red men, who seeing how useless
was everything of that nature, turned about and soon passed from
view.</p>

<p>The incident was typical of the futility of the red man struggling
against his inevitable doom at the hands of his white brother.</p>

<p>Half way between the bottom of the cañon and the lower fringe
of the vast mantle of snow, a waterfall tumbled over the edge
of a rock, and with many a twist and eddy found its way to the
small stream, which rippled along the bottom of the gorge, until
its winding course carried it beyond sight. Now and then a rift
of wind blew aside some of the foam, like a wisp of snow, and
brought the murmur more clearly to the ear of the listener, shutting
out for the time, the faint hollow roar that was wafted from the
region of pines and cedars. It was a picture of lonely grandeur
and desolation, made all the more impressive by the tiny bits
of life, showing in the few spots along the mountain wall.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE TEACHER HAD MARKED ON THE DARK FACE OF
THE ROCK WITH A SPECIES OF CHALK ALL THE LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET.
&</em>mdash;<em>PAGE 71</em>.]</p>

<p>At the rear of the row of cabins, and elevated perhaps fifty
feet above, was the comparatively smooth face of a rock, several
square rods in extent. At the base was abundant footing for two
persons, Parson Brush and Nellie Dawson. The teacher had marked
on the dark face of the rock with a species of chalk, all the
letters large and small of the alphabet. They were well drawn,
for the parson, like others in the settlement, was a man of education,
though his many years of roughing it had greatly rusted his book
knowledge.</p>

<p>Standing to one side of his artistic work, like a teacher of
the olden time, the parson, with a long, trimmed branch in his
hand, pointed at the different letters in turn and patiently waited
for his little pupil to pronounce their names.</p>

<p>It never would have done to make the child keep her feet like
an ordinary mortal. With great labor, three of the miners had
carried a stone of considerable size to the spot, which served
her as a seat, while receiving instruction. It is true that she
never sat still for more than three minutes at a time, but that
was enough to establish the indispensable necessity of a chair.</p>

<p>"You are doing very well, my dear," said the parson, encouragingly;
"you have received only a few lessons, but have mastered the alphabet.
I notice that the 'd's' and 'b's' and 'h's' and 'q's' puzzle you
a little now and then, but you have got them straight, and it
is now time that we took a lesson in spelling."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't do that, Mr. Brush," protested the queen, rising
from the chair, adjusting her skirts and sitting down again; "I
never can spell."</p>

<p>"What is it to spell?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; what is it?"</p>

<p>"I can best answer your question by showing you. Have you ever
seen a cat?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean a pussy?"</p>

<p>"Yes; some folks call it that."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; when we came from where we used to live, &mdash;I guess
it must have been three or four hundred years ago, we brought
my pussy along. Her name was Nellie, the same as mine."</p>

<p>"What became of her?"</p>

<p>"She died," was the sorrowful reply; "I guess she was homesick."</p>

<p>"That was too bad. Now will you tell me what letter that is?"</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Brush, don't you know?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I wish to find out whether you know."</p>

<p>"It is C; anybody knows that."</p>

<p>"And this one?"</p>

<p>"A."</p>

<p>"That is right; now this one?"</p>

<p>"T; I hope you will remember, Mr. Brush, because I don't like
to tell you so often."</p>

<p>The teacher continued to drill her, skipping about and pointing
at the letters so rapidly in turn that he was kept bowing and
straightening up like a jumping-jack. Then, allowing her to rest,
he pronounced the letters in their regular order, giving them
the sounds proper to the word itself. Nellie, who was watching
closely and listening, suddenly exclaimed with glowing face:</p>

<p>"Why, that's 'cat'!"</p>

<p>"Of course; now can you say the letters without looking at them?"</p>

<p>After one or two trials she did it successfully.</p>

<p>"There! you have learned to spell 'cat.' You see how easy it
is."</p>

<p>"Does that spell 'pussy' too?"</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;only 'cat.' After a time you will be able to spell big
words."</p>

<p>"Let me try something else, Mr. Brush."</p>

<p>The next word tackled was 'dog,' which was soon mastered. When
this was accomplished, the teacher paused for a moment. He was
trying to think of another word of three letters, but oddly enough
could not readily do so.</p>

<p>"Ah," he exclaimed, "here is another. Now give me the name of
that letter,"</p>

<p>"D."</p>

<p>"And that?"</p>

<p>"A."</p>

<p>"And that?"</p>

<p>"M."</p>

<p>"Now say them quickly, 'd-a-m;' what is the word?"</p>

<p>"Why, it's 'dam'; O, Mr. Brush, I heard you say that is a bad
word."</p>

<p>The teacher was thunderstruck and stammered:</p>

<p>"I didn't think of that, but there are two kinds of 'dam' and
this one is not a bad word. It means a bank of earth or stones
or wood, that is put up to stop the flow of water."</p>
