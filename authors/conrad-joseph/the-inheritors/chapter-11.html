<p><em>TEN</em></p>

<p>Before noon of the next day I was ascending the stairs of the
new house in which the Duc had his hermitage. There was an air
of secrecy in the broad publicity of the carpeted stairs that
led to his flat; a hush in the atmosphere; in the street itself,
a glorified <em>cul de sac</em> that ran into the bustling life
of the Italiens. It had the sudden sluggishness of a back-water.
One seemed to have grown suddenly deaf in the midst of the rattle.</p>

<p>There was an incredible suggestion of silence&mdash;the silence of
a private detective&mdash;in the mien of the servant who ushered me
into a room. He was the English servant of the theatre&mdash;the English
servant that foreigners affect. The room had a splendour of its
own, not a cheaply vulgar splendour, but the vulgarity of the
most lavish plush and purple kind. The air was heavy, killed by
the scent of exotic flowers, darkened by curtains that suggested
the voluminous velvet backgrounds of certain old portraits. The
Duc de Mersch had carried with him into this place of retirement
the taste of the New Palace, that show-place of his that was the
stupefaction of swarms of honest tourists.</p>

<p>I remembered soon enough that the man was a philanthropist, that
he might be an excellent man of heart and indifferent of taste.
He must be. But I was prone to be influenced by things of this
sort, and felt depressed at the thought that so much of royal
excellence should weigh so heavily in the wrong scale of the balance
of the applied arts. I turned my back on the room and gazed at
the blazing white decorations of the opposite house-fronts.</p>

<p>A door behind me must have opened, for I heard the sounds of
a concluding tirade in a high-pitched voice.</p>

<p>"<em>Et quant à un duc de farce, je ne m'en fiche pas mal, moi</em>,"
it said in an accent curiously compounded of the foreign and the
<em>coulisse</em>. A muttered male remonstrance ensued, and then,
with disconcerting clearness:</p>

<p>"<em>Gr-r-rangeur &mdash;Eschingan&mdash;eh bien&mdash;il entend. Et moi,
j'entends, moi aussi. Tu veux me jouer contre elle. La Grangeur&mdash;pah!
Consoles-toi avec elle, mon vieux. Je ne veux plus de toi. Tu
m'as donné de tes sales rentes Groenlandoises, et je n'ai pas
pu les vendre. Ah, vieux farceur, tu vas voir ce que j'en vais
faire.</em>"</p>

<p>A glorious creature&mdash;a really glorious creature&mdash;came out of
an adjoining room. She was as frail, as swaying as a garden lily.
Her great blue eyes turned irefully upon me, her bowed lips parted,
her nostrils quivered.</p>

<p>"<em>Et quant à vous, M. Grangeur Eschingan,</em>" she began,
"<em>je vais vous donner mon idée à moi ...</em>"</p>

<p>I did not understand the situation in the least, but I appreciated
the awkwardness of it. The world seemed to be standing on its
head. I was overcome; but I felt for the person in the next room.
I did not know what to do. Suddenly I found myself saying:</p>

<p>"I am extremely sorry, madam, but I don't understand French."
An expression of more intense vexation passed into her face&mdash;her
beautiful face. I fancy she wished&mdash;wished intensely&mdash;to give
me the benefit of her "<em>idée à elle</em>." She made a quick,
violent gesture of disgusted contempt, and turned toward the half-open
door from which she had come. She began again to dilate upon the
little weaknesses of the person behind, when silently and swiftly
it closed. We heard the lock click. With extraordinary quickness
she had her mouth at the keyhole: "<em>Peeg, peeg</em>," she enunciated.
Then she stood to her full height, her face became calm, her manner
stately. She glided half way across the room, paused, looked at
me, and pointed toward the unmoving door.</p>

<p>"<em>Peeg, peeg</em>," she explained, mysteriously. I think she
was warning me against the wiles of the person behind the door.
I gazed into her great eyes. "I understand," I said, gravely.
She glided from the room. For me the incident supplied a welcome
touch of comedy. I had leisure for thought. The door remained
closed. It made the Duc a more real person for me. I had regarded
him as a rather tiresome person in whom a pompous philanthropism
took the place of human feelings. It amused me to be called <em>Le
Grangeur</em>. It amused me, and I stood in need of amusement.
Without it I might never have written the article on the Duc.
I had started out that morning in a state of nervous irritation.
I had wanted more than ever to have done with the thing, with
the <em>Hour</em>, with journalism, with everything. But this
little new experience buoyed me up, set my mind working in less
morbid lines. I began to wonder whether de Mersch would funk,
or whether he would take my non-comprehension of the woman's tirades
as a thing assured.</p>

<p>The door at which I had entered, by which she had left, opened.</p>

<p>He must have impressed me in some way or other that evening at
the Churchills. He seemed a very stereotyped image in my memory.
He spoke just as he had spoken, moved his hands just as I expected
him to move them. He called for no modification of my views of
his person. As a rule one classes a man so-and-so at first meeting,
modifies the classification at each subsequent one, and so on.
He seemed to be all affability, of an adipose turn. He had the
air of the man of the world among men of the world; but none of
the unconscious reserve of manner that one expects to find in
the temporarily great. He had in its place a kind of sub-sulkiness,
as if he regretted the pedestal from which he had descended.</p>

<p>In his slow commercial English he apologised for having kept
me waiting; he had been taking the air of this fine morning, he
said. He mumbled the words with his eyes on my waistcoat, with
an air that accorded rather ill with the semblance of portentous
probity that his beard conferred on him. But he set an eye-glass
in his left eye immediately afterward, and looked straight at
me as if in challenge. With a smiling "Don't mention," I tried
to demonstrate that I met him half way.</p>

<p>"You want to interview me," he said, blandly. "I am only too
pleased. I suppose it is about my Arctic schemes that you wish
to know. I will do what I can to inform you. You perhaps remember
what I said when I had the pleasure of meeting you at the house
of the Right Honourable Mr. Churchill. It has been the dream of
my life to leave behind me a happy and contented State&mdash;as much
as laws and organisation can make one. This is what I should most
like the English to know of me." He was a dull talker. I supposed
that philanthropists and state founders kept their best faculties
for their higher pursuits. I imagined the low, receding forehead
and the pink-nailed, fleshy hands to belong to a new Solon, a
latter-day Æneas. I tried to work myself into the properly enthusiastic
frame of mind. After all, it was a great work that he had undertaken.
I was too much given to dwell upon intellectual gifts. These the
Duc seemed to lack. I credited him with having let them be merged
in his one noble idea.</p>

<p>He furnished me with statistics. They had laid down so many miles
of railways, used so many engines of British construction. They
had taught the natives to use and to value sewing-machines and
European costumes. So many hundred of English younger sons had
gone to make their fortunes and, incidentally, to enlighten the
Esquimaux&mdash;so many hundreds of French, of Germans, Greeks, Russians.
All these lived and moved in harmony, employed, happy, free labourers,
protected by the most rigid laws. Man-eating, fetich-worship,
slavery had been abolished, stamped out. The great international
society for the preservation of Polar freedom watched over all,
suggested new laws, modified the old. The country was unhealthy,
but not to men of clean lives&mdash;<em>hominibus bonæ voluntatis</em>.
It asked for no others.</p>

<p>"I have had to endure much misrepresentation. I have been called
names," the Duc said.</p>

<p>The figure of the lady danced before my eyes, lithe, supple&mdash;a
statue endued with the motion of a serpent. I seemed to see her
sculptured white hand pointing to the closed door.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," I said, "but one knows the people that call you names."</p>

<p>"Well, then," he answered, "it is your task to make them know
the truth. Your nation has so much power. If it will only realise."</p>

<p>"I will do my best," I said.</p>

<p>I saw the apotheosis of the Press&mdash;a Press that makes a State
Founder suppliant to a man like myself. For he had the tone of
a deprecating petitioner. I stood between himself and a people,
the arbiter of the peoples, of the kings of the future. I was
nothing, nobody; yet here I stood in communion with one of those
who change the face of continents. He had need of me, of the power
that was behind me. It was strange to be alone in that room with
that man&mdash;to be there just as I might be in my own little room
alone with any other man.</p>

<p>I was not unduly elated, you must understand. It was nothing
to me. I was just a person elected by some suffrage of accidents.
Even in my own eyes I was merely a symbol&mdash;the sign visible of
incomprehensible power.</p>

<p>"I will do my best," I said.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, do," he said, "Mr. Churchill told me how nicely you
can do such things."</p>

<p>I said that it was very kind of Mr. Churchill. The tension of
the conversation was relaxed. The Duc asked if I had yet seen
my aunt.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten her," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, you must see her," he said; "she is a most remarkable lady.
She is one of my relaxations. All Paris talks about her, I can
assure you."</p>

<p>"I had no idea," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, cultivate her," he said; "you will be amused."</p>

<p>"I will," I said, as I took my leave.</p>

<p>I went straight home to my little room above the roofs. I began
at once to write my article, working at high pressure, almost
hysterically. I remember that place and that time so well. In
moments of emotion one gazes fixedly at things, hardly conscious
of them. Afterward one remembers.</p>

<p>I can still see the narrow room, the bare, brown, discoloured
walls, the incongruous marble clock on the mantel-piece, the single
rickety chair that swayed beneath me. I could almost draw the
tortuous pattern of the faded cloth that hid the round table at
which I sat. The ink was thick, pale, and sticky; the pen spluttered.
I wrote furiously, anxious to be done with it. Once I went and
leaned over the balcony, trying to hit on a word that would not
come. Miles down below, little people crawled over the cobbled
street, little carts rattled, little workmen let down casks into
a cellar. It was all very grey, small, and clear.</p>

<p>Through the open window of an opposite garret I could see a sculptor
working at a colossal clay model. In his white blouse he seemed
big, out of all proportion to the rest of the world. Level with
my eyes there were flat lead roofs and chimneys. On one of these
was scrawled, in big, irregular, blue-painted letters: "<em>A
bas Coignet</em>."</p>

<p>Great clouds began to loom into view over the house-tops, rounded,
toppling masses of grey, lit up with sullen orange against the
pale limpid blue of the sky. I stood and looked at all these objects.
I had come out here to think&mdash;thoughts had deserted me. I could
only look.</p>

<p>The clouds moved imperceptibly, fatefully onward, a streak of
lightning tore them apart. They whirled like tortured smoke and
grew suddenly black. Large spots of rain with jagged edges began
to fall on the lead floor of my balcony.</p>

<p>I turned into the twilight of my room and began to write. I can
still feel the tearing of my pen-point on the coarse paper. It
was a hindrance to thought, but my flow of words ignored it, gained
impetus from it, as a stream does at the breaking of a dam.</p>

<p>I was writing a pæan to a great coloniser. That sort of thing
was in the air then. I was drawn into it, carried away by my subject.
Perhaps I let it do so because it was so little familiar to my
lines of thought. It was fresh ground and I revelled in it. I
committed myself to that kind of emotional, lyrical outburst that
one dislikes so much on re-reading. I was half conscious of the
fact, but I ignored it.</p>

<p>The thunderstorm was over, and there was a moist sparkling freshness
in the air when I hurried with my copy to the <em>Hour</em> office
in the Avenue de l'Opéra. I wished to be rid of it, to render
impossible all chance of revision on the morrow.</p>

<p>I wanted, too, to feel elated; I expected it. It was a right.
At the office I found the foreign correspondent, a little cosmopolitan
Jew whose eyebrows began their growth on the bridge of his nose.
He was effusive and familiar, as the rest of his kind.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Granger," was his greeting. I was used to regarding myself
as fallen from a high estate, but I was not yet so humble in spirit
as to relish being called Granger by a stranger of his stamp.
I tried to freeze him politely.</p>

<p>"Read your stuff in the <em>Hour</em>," was his rejoinder; "jolly
good I call it. Been doing old Red-Beard? Let's have a look. Yes,
yes. That's the way&mdash;that's the real thing &mdash;I call it. Must
have bored you to death ... old de Mersch I mean. I ought to have
had the job, you know. My business, interviewing people in Paris.
But <em>I</em> don't mind. Much rather you did it than I. You
do it a heap better."</p>

<p>I murmured thanks. There was a pathos about the sleek little
man&mdash;a pathos that is always present in the type. He seemed to
be trying to assume a deprecating equality.</p>

<p>"Where are you going to-night?" he asked, with sudden effusiveness.
I was taken aback. One is not used to being asked these questions
after five minutes' acquaintance. I said that I had no plans.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, brightening up, "come and have dinner with
me at Breguet's, and look in at the Opera afterward. We'll have
a real nice chat."</p>

<p>I was too tired to frame an adequate excuse. Besides, the little
man was as eager as a child for a new toy. We went to Breguet's
and had a really excellent dinner.</p>

<p>"Always come here," he said; "one meets a lot of swells. It runs
away with a deal of money&mdash;but I don't care to do things on the
cheap, not for the <em>Hour</em>, you know. You can always be
certain when I say that I have a thing from a senator that he
is a senator, and not an old woman in a paper kiosque. Most of
them do that sort of thing, you know."</p>

<p>"I always wondered," I said, mildly.</p>

<p>"That's de Sourdam I nodded to as we came in, and that old chap
there is Pluyvis&mdash;the Affaire man, you know. I must have a word
with him in a minute, if you'll excuse me."</p>

<p>He began to ask affectionately after the health of the excellent
Fox, asked if I saw him often, and so on and so on. I divined
with amusement that was pleasurable that the little man had his
own little axe to grind, and thought I might take a turn at the
grindstone if he managed me well. So he nodded to de Sourdam of
the Austrian embassy and had his word with Pluyvis, and rejoiced
to have impressed me &mdash;I could see him bubble with happiness
and purr. He proposed that we should stroll as far as the paper
kiosque that he patronised habitually&mdash;it was kept by a fellow-Israelite&mdash;a
snuffy little old woman.</p>

<p>I understood that in the joy of his heart he was for expanding,
for wasting a few minutes on a stroll.</p>

<p>"Haven't stretched my legs for months," he explained.</p>

<p>We strolled there through the summer twilight. It was so pleasant
to saunter through the young summer night. There were so many
little things to catch the eyes, so many of the little things
down near the earth; expressions on faces of the passers, the
set of a collar, the quaint foreign tightness of waist of a good
bourgeoise who walked arm in arm with her perspiring spouse. The
gilding on the statue of Joan of Arc had a pleasant littleness
of Philistinism, the arcades of the Rue de Rivoli broke up the
grey light pleasantly too. I remembered a little shop&mdash;a little
Greek affair with a windowful of pinch-beck&mdash;where I had been
given a false five-franc piece years and years ago. The same villainous
old Levantine stood in the doorway, perhaps the fez that he wore
was the same fez. The little old woman that we strolled to was
bent nearly double. Her nose touched her wares as often as not,
her mittened hands sought quiveringly the papers that the correspondent
asked for. I liked him the better for his solicitude for this
forlorn piece of flotsam of his own race.</p>

<p>"Always come here," he exclaimed; "one gets into habits. Very
honest woman, too, you can be certain of getting your change.
If you're a stranger you can't be sure that they won't give you
Italian silver, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know," I answered. I knew, too, that he wished me to purchase
something. I followed the course of her groping hands, caught
sight of the <em>Revue Rouge</em>, and remembered that it contained
something about Greenland. I helped myself to it, paid for it,
and received my just change. I felt that I had satisfied the little
man, and felt satisfied with myself.</p>

<p>"I want to see Radet's article on Greenland," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he explained, once more exhibiting himself in the
capacity of the man who knows, "Radet gives it to them. Rather
a lark, I call it, though you mustn't let old de Mersch know you
read him. Radet got sick of Cochin, and tried Greenland. He's
getting touched by the Whites you know. They say that the priests
don't like the way the Système's playing into the hands of the
Protestants and the English Government. So they set Radet on to
write it down. He's going in for mysticism and all that sort of
thing&mdash;just like all these French jokers are doing. Got deuced
thick with that lot in the F. St. Germain&mdash;some relation of yours,
ain't they? Rather a lark that lot, quite the thing just now,
everyone goes there; old de Mersch too. Have frightful rows sometimes,
such a mixed lot, you see." The good little man rattled amiably
along beside me.</p>

<p>"Seems quite funny to be buying books," he said. "I haven't read
a thing I've bought, not for years."</p>

<p>We reached the Opera in time for the end of the first act&mdash;it
was Aïda, I think. My little friend had a free pass all over the
house. I had not been in it for years. In the old days I had always
seen the stage from a great height, craning over people's heads
in a sultry twilight; now I saw it on a level, seated at my ease.
I had only the power of the Press to thank for the change.</p>

<p>"Come here as often as I can," my companion said; "can't do without
music when it's to be had." Indeed he had the love of his race
for it. It seemed to soften him, to change his nature, as he sat
silent by my side.</p>

<p>But the closing notes of each scene found him out in the cool
of the corridors, talking, and being talked to by anyone that
would vouchsafe him a word.</p>

<p>"Pick up a lot here," he explained.</p>

<p>After the finale we leaned over one of the side balconies to
watch the crowd streaming down the marble staircases. It is a
scene that I never tire of. There is something so fantastically
tawdry in the coloured marble of the architecture. It is for all
the world like a triumph of ornamental soap work; one expects
to smell the odours. And the torrent of humanity pouring liquidly
aslant through the mirror-like light, and the spaciousness....
Yes, it is fantastic, somehow; ironical, too.</p>

<p>I was watching the devious passage of a rather drunken, gigantic,
florid Englishman, wondering, I think, how he would reach his
bed.</p>

<p>"That must be a relation of yours," the correspondent said, pointing.
My glance followed the line indicated by his pale finger. I made
out the glorious beard of the Duc de Mersch, on his arm was an
old lady to whom he seemed to pay deferential attention. His head
was bent on one side; he was smiling frankly. A little behind
them, on the stairway, there was a space. Perhaps I was mistaken;
perhaps there was no space &mdash;I don't know. I was only conscious
of a figure, an indescribably clear-cut woman's figure, gliding
down the way. It had a coldness, a self-possession, a motion of
its own. In that clear, transparent, shimmering light, every little
fold of the dress, every little shadow of the white arms, the
white shoulders, came up to me. The face turned up to meet mine.
I remember so well the light shining down on the face, not a shadow
anywhere, not a shadow beneath the eyebrows, the nostrils, the
waves of hair. It was a vision of light, theatening, sinister.</p>

<p>She smiled, her lips parted.</p>

<p>"You come to me to-morrow," she said. Did I hear the words, did
her lips merely form them? She was far, far down below me; the
air was alive with the rustling of feet, of garments, of laughter,
full of sounds that made themselves heard, full of sounds that
would not be caught.</p>

<p>"You come to me ... to-morrow."</p>

<p>The old lady on the Duc de Mersch's arm was obviously my aunt.
I did not see why I should not go to them to-morrow. It struck
me suddenly and rather pleasantly that this was, after all, my
family. This old lady actually was a connection more close than
anyone else in the world. As for the girl, to all intents and,
in everyone else's eyes, she was my sister. I cannot say I disliked
having her for my sister, either. I stood looking down upon them
and felt less alone than I had done for many years.</p>

<p>A minute scuffle of the shortest duration was taking place beside
me. There were a couple of men at my elbow. I don't in the least
know what they were&mdash;perhaps marquises, perhaps railway employees&mdash;one
never can tell over there. One of them was tall and blond, with
a heavy, bow-shaped red moustache &mdash;Irish in type; the other
of no particular height, excellently groomed, dark, and exemplary.
I knew he was exemplary from some detail of costume that I can't
remember&mdash;his gloves or a strip of silk down the sides of his
trousers&mdash;something of the sort. The blond was saying something
that I did not catch. I heard the words "de Mersch" and "<em>Anglaise</em>,"
and saw the dark man turn his attention to the little group below.
Then I caught my own name mispronounced and somewhat of a stumbling-block
to a high-pitched contemptuous intonation. The little correspondent,
who was on my other arm, started visibly and moved swiftly behind
my back.</p>

<p>"<em>Messieurs</em>," he said in an urgent whisper, and drew
them to a little distance. I saw him say something, saw them pivot
to look at me, shrug their shoulders and walk away. I didn't in
the least grasp the significance of the scene&mdash;not then.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" I asked my returning friend; "were they
talking about me?" He answered nervously.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was about your aunt's Salon, you know. They might have
been going to say something awkward ... one never knows."</p>

<p>"They really <em>do</em> talk about it then?" I said. "I've a
good mind to attend one of their exhibitions."</p>

<p>"Why, of course," he said, "you ought. I really think you <em>ought</em>."</p>

<p>"I'll go to-morrow," I answered.</p>
