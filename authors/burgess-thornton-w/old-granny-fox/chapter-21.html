You'll find as on through life you go<br/>
The thing you want may prove to be<br/>
The very thing you shouldn't have.<br/>
Then seeming loss is gain, you see.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Old Granny Fox.

<p>If ever two folks were mad away through, those two were Granny
and Reddy Fox as they watched Old Man Coyote gobble up the dinner
they had so cleverly stolen from Bowser the Hound. It was bad
enough to lose the dinner, but it was worse to see some one else
eat it after they had worked so hard to get it. "Robber!" snarled
Granny. Old Man Coyote stopped eating long enough to grin.</p>

<p>"Thief! Sneak! Coward!" snarled Reddy. Once more Old Man Coyote
grinned. When that dinner had disappeared down his throat to the
last and smallest crumb, he licked his chops and turned to Granny
and Reddy.</p>

<p>"I'm very much obliged for that dinner," said he pleasantly,
his eyes twinkling with mischief. "It was the best dinner I have
had for a long time. Allow me to say that that trick of yours
was as smart a trick as ever I have seen. It was quite worthy
of a Coyote. You are a very clever old lady, Granny Fox. Now I
hear some one coming, and I would suggest that it will be better
for all concerned if we are not seen about here."</p>

<p>He darted off behind the barn like a gray streak, and Granny
and Reddy followed, for it was true that some one was coming.
You see Bowser the Hound had discovered that something was going
on around the corner of the shed, and he made such a racket that
Mrs. Brown had come out of the house to see what it was all about.
By the time she got around there, all she saw was the empty pan
which had held Bowser's dinner. She was puzzled. How that pan
could be where it was she couldn't understand, and Bowser couldn't
tell her, although he tried his very best. She had been puzzled
about that pan two or three times before.</p>

<p>Old Man Coyote lost no time in getting back home, for he never
felt easy near the home of man in broad daylight. Granny and Reddy
Fox went home too, and there was hate in their hearts,&mdash;hate for
Old Man Coyote. But once they reached home, Old Granny Fox stopped
growling, and presently she began to chuckle.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?" demanded Reddy.</p>

<p>"At the way Old Man Coyote stole that dinner from us," replied
Granny.</p>

<p>"I hate him! He's a sneaking robber!" snapped Reddy.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, Reddy! Tut, tut!" retorted Granny. "Be fair-minded.
We stole that dinner from Bowser the Hound, and Old Man Coyote
stole it from us. I guess he is no worse than we are, when you
come to think it over. Now is he?"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>well, I don't suppose he is, when you put
it that way," Reddy admitted grudgingly.</p>

<p>"And he was smart, very smart, to outwit two such clever people
as we are," continued Granny. "You will have to agree to that."</p>

<p>"Y-e-s," said Reddy slowly. "He was smart enough, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There isn't any but, Reddy," interrupted Granny. "You know the
law of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest. It is everybody
for himself, and anything belongs to one who has the wit or the
strength to take it. We had the wit to take that dinner from Bowser
the Hound, and Old Man Coyote had the wit to take it from us and
the strength to keep it. It was all fair enough, and you know
there isn't the least use in crying over spilled milk, as the
saying is. We simply have got to be smart enough not to let him
fool us again. I guess we won't get any more of Bowser's dinners
for a while. We've got to think of some other way of filling our
stomachs when the hunting is poor. I think if I could have just
one of those fat hens of Farmer Brown's, it would put new strength
into my old bones. All summer I warned you to keep away from that
henyard, but the time has come now when I think we might try for
a couple of those hens."</p>

<p>Reddy pricked up his ears at the mention of fat hens. "I think
so too,"  said he. "When shall we try for one?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning," replied Granny. "Now don't bother me while
I think out a plan."</p>
