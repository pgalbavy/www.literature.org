<p>THE third round of deliveries was finished, and, arrived at his last
evening, Erb, coat and collar off, washed away the traces of work in the
stable pail with the aid of some aggressive soft soap that seemed to have
its own way in everything.  He had brought with him that morning a parcel
of private clothes, and just before going out with the six o’clock turn,
he had changed, and had handed in the corduroy uniform.  A relief to feel
that he no longer wore the brass buttons of servitude; of late they had
seemed to reproach him.  He had driven round the Surrey side with the air
of a sporting gentleman taking out his own horse and trap; the private
clothes helped him to say his good-byes with dignity to all, and
especially to his old enemy, the van foreman.
</p>
<p>“You <u>would</u> go on in your own tin-pot way,” said the van foreman
regretfully, “no matter what I said.  Your case ought to act as a
warnin’.”
</p><p>“To <u>you</u>?”
</p><p>“I <u>should</u> ’ave thought,” said the van foreman, with a wistful air,
“after all that’s passed between us we might as well part good friends,
at any rate.”
</p><p>“Look here, old chap,” said Erb good-temperedly, “_I_ tried to out you,
and <u>you</u> tried to out me; and you’ve got the best of it.  I don’t
complain, but I’m not going to pretend I’m on friendly terms with a man
when I ain’t.”
</p><p>“That’s what I say,” retorted the van foreman argumentatively.  “You’ve
got no discretion.”
</p><p>The manners of William Henry had about them a fine blend of
condescension; the lad came forward from the tail of the van and sat on a
hamper, big with news.  He had been approached that afternoon and
informed that, consequent on the departure of Erb, there would be some
changes, and would he, William Henry, accept the position of junior
porter at fourteen shillings a week.
</p><p>“I shall probably work on from that,” said William Henry, “to some even
higher position, and then on again.  See?  And if ever you want a friend,
Erb—”
</p><p>“I don’t let boys call me Erb.  Mr. Barnes, if you please.”
</p><p>“If I’m a boy,” said William Henry thoughtfully, “I don’t quite see where
you’re going to find your men.  As I was a sayin’, if ever you should be
down in the gutter—and, mind you, there’s unlikelier things than that—you
come to me.  It may be in my power to ’elp you.  And I tell you what you
can do for me in exchange.  You might take the van ’ome to the stables by
yourself, so that I can run round to Rotherhithe New Road and tell my
young lady.”
</p><p>“<u>Your</u> young lady!”
</p><p>“And why not?” demanded William Henry with some indignation.  “We ain’t
all like you.”
</p><p>It gratified Erb, as he parted his hair with an imperfect pocket comb,
and tried to make the obstinate wisp at the back of his head remain flat,
to think that he had the reputation of one who exhibited no sort of
weakness in regard to women; this came in well with his profound attitude
towards the world.  He had had a letter from the tall upper housemaid at
Eaton Square, to which he had sent no reply; indeed, the communication
scarcely demanded an answer, for it furnished only information in regard
to the weather, and a fervent hope that his health had not been impaired
by his presence at the dance; it would not have remained in his memory
but for one sentence, “Her young ladyship has spoken of you once or
twice.”  An incomplete way of conveying a fact: something, of course, to
know that she had referred to him, but it would have been more
interesting to know the precise terms.  He flushed at the appalling
thought that she might have made some humorous comment on his behaviour.
</p><p>Men balanced themselves on the edge of the kerb outside the “Druid’s
Arms,” and whilst a swollen-faced cornet blared patriotic tunes at them
from the opposite side in a ferocious way that permitted of no argument,
some of the youngest tried to do a few steps of a dance.  Two butchers,
affecting to be rivals, chaffed each other derisively in raucous voices,
one demanding to know how the widow was, and, on the second man replying
incautiously, “What widder?” the first explained that he referred to the
widow of the man who bought a joint at the second man’s shop last
Saturday week.  A hoarse-voiced man sold cough tablets for the voice; a
mild, sightless old man, with bootlaces, had an eager little girl with
him, who cried shrilly and commandingly and unceasingly, “Petronise the
belind, petronise the belind, petronise the—”  Boys and girls thrust
bunches of flowers against the noses of passers by; a depressed woman
cried, “Twenty-four comic papers for a punny,” with a catch in her voice
that expressed regret at the small demand for humour.  Erb nodded to the
uniformed men whom he recognised, and, going into the bar, found his
competitor Spanswick.  Always a short, stout man, Spanswick to-night had
every sign of his insufficient neck covered with white collar; Erb was
pleased to see that Spanswick’s tie had rucked up at the back.
</p><p>Spanswick stopped suddenly in the remarks he was making to an interested
group who stood leaning over him in the manner of palm trees, and, coming
away, shook hands publicly and elaborately with Erb, as men in the boxing
ring salute their opponents.
</p><p>“Feeling fit?”
</p><p>“Never better,” said Erb.  “How’s yourself?”
</p><p>“Bit of a cold,” said Spanswick with important reserve; “but otherwise—”
</p><p>If there is time, one would like to explain here Spanswick’s position
amongst the men.  It was of that assured kind that newcomers do not dare
to question, and contemporaries have agreed to respect.  If this ever
exhibited signs of waning, Spanswick would gather an audience together
and beat the bounds of the incident that had made him a man to be treated
with consideration, and the story had been re-told so many times, and so
many improvements and additions had been made to it, that for the sake of
true history the real facts may as well be set down.
</p><p>Spanswick had given way to drink.  To say this meant much, for at the
time the limits set upon the consumption of beer by many of the carmen
was only that fixed by their own capabilities.  Spanswick’s case must
have been exceptional, and, indeed, he was so inclined, not so much to
the bottle, perhaps, as to the quart, that his appearance on the morning
following these carousals was truly deplorable: his strong-minded wife
taking these opportunities to damage his face, with the eventual result
that his van boy and his horse sneered at him openly.  Wherefore Payne
and a man named Kirby and another called Old Jim, decided, in the best
interests of mankind at large, and of Spanswick in particular, that some
steps should be taken, that it was for them to take these steps, and that
the following Friday evening (being pay day) was the time to be selected.
Payne’s idea was this.  They would run Spanswick to earth in one of his
resorts, they would form a ring (or as much of a ring as three could
make) around him, and by wise counsel and urgent illustration force upon
him a recognition of the downward career that was his, and its inevitable
end.  It took some time to arrive at this decision, because Old Jim, who
was not abreast of the times and of modern methods, had a remedy that
included the dropping of the patient in the canal; whilst Kirby had
another proposal.  “Let us set the teetotal chaps on him,” urged Kirby.
Payne’s scheme was adopted, and, the Friday night arriving, the three,
after they had finished work, had a shave and a wash, and put on their
best clothes (Payne himself wore a silk hat of adequate age, but of
insufficient size), and they set out solemnly to take up their
self-appointed duties.
</p><p>“Now,” said Old Jim, “the likeliest place is ‘The World Turned Upside
Down.’”
</p><p>“Pardon me,” said Kirby, with the politeness that comes with the wearing
of Sunday clothes, “pardon me, but ‘The Chequers’ is his ’ouse.”
</p><p>“I thought,” remarked Payne, “the ‘Dun Cow’ was.”
</p><p>“I’m prutty sure I’m right,” said Old Jim.
</p><p>“I’m jolly well certain you’re both wrong,” declared Kirby with emphasis.
</p><p>“Standing here all night arguin’,” decided Payne, “won’t settle the
matter.  Let’s make a start at one of them.”
</p><p>Spanswick was not in “The World Turned Upside Down,” but the three had a
drink there, because it would be notoriously a gross breach of etiquette
to go from a public-house without ordering refreshment; to do this were
to deride the landlord openly, and insinuate libels on his stock.  At the
next place the three went into each bar to make sure, and, having money
in their pockets, it seemed like doing the thing well and completely to
have a drink here in every bar, still discussing the painful case of poor
old Spanny, regretting deeply the curse that liquor brought upon men who
could not use it with discretion.
</p><p>“It’s good servant,” said Old Jim, raising his glass and shutting one eye
in order to see it clearly, “but bad mas’er.  That’s what I always says
about it.  It’s a good mas’r, but—  What I mean to say is it’s a bad
servant—”
</p><p>“Every man,” declared Kirby, attempting to slap the counter, but missing
it, “ought to know where to draw line.”
</p><p>“The chap who don’t,” agreed Payne, “(You’re upsetting your glass, Jim,
old man)—the chap who don’t is like the beas’s of field.”
</p><p>“Worse!” said Old Jim.
</p><p>“No, not worse!” urged Payne obstinately.
</p><p>“Fight you for it,” offered Old Jim.
</p><p>Kirby interfered and made peace, and throughout the evening, wherever
they went in search of Spanswick, it happened that some two of the three
were always quarrelling, whilst the third endeavoured to appease and
conciliate.  They were on the very edge of a triangular dispute in the
last house of call when Payne, sobering himself for a moment, pointed out
to the others that it was closing time, and they must not go to bed
without feeling that something accomplished, something done, had earned a
night’s repose; necessary that they should proceed now with as much
directness as possible to Spanswick’s house, and (if they found him)
there deliver the calculated words of warning, the prepared sentences of
advice.
</p><p>“’Ullo, old man,” said Payne, as the door of Spanswick’s house opened.
“Many ’appy returns day.”
</p><p>“What’s all this?” demanded Spanswick coldly.  “Brought anything with you
in a bottle?”
</p><p>“We’ve brought good ’dvice,” said Old Jim, seating himself on the sill.
“How is it we didn’t see you at any of the places?”
</p><p>“The wife locked up me boots,” replied Spanswick surlily.  “That’s why.
But surely one of you’s got a bottle about him somewheres.  Search!”
</p><p>“We want you, old chap,” said Payne, steadying himself with a hand on
either side of the doorway, “to give up the drink.  ‘Oh that man should
put an en’my into his mouth to steal out his brains.’  Chuck it, my
friend, chuck it, before it is too late.  Shun the flowing bowl, and save
your money to buy harmonium with.”
</p><p>“I’ll harmonium you,” said Spanswick threateningly, “if you don’t all
three of you make yourselves precious scarce.  How dare you come round
here in this disgraceful condition to annoy a sober, honest man?  Go to
your ’omes and take an example by me.  I never saw such a painful
exhibition in all me life.”
</p><p>“How was we to know you’d be sober?” asked Kirby, swaying.
</p><p>Spanswick emphasised the situation by remaining comparatively sober for a
week; a busy week in other ways, for he lost no opportunity of reciting
the incident of his own pure and heroic action, establishing thus a
concrete foundation for the building up of a character that had never
entirely disappeared.
</p><p>(This is the story of carman Spanswick.)
</p><p>One or two men standing at the zinc bar called on Erb to have a drink,
but Erb replied, “Afterwards,” and went up the wooden staircase to the
club room.  There, on the landing, men were consulting in undertones,
which they changed for much louder speech on seeing Erb, commencing to
talk noisily of contests with superiors whom they had, it appeared,
worsted in argument; of fresh young horses that required a somewhat
similar treatment; of trouble in regard to Shuts-up, to water allowances,
to Brought-backs, and other technical matters.  A late colleague of Erb’s
introduced him to those who were strangers, and Erb made quite a
considerable effort to exhibit friendly manners, until a South Western
man, mistaking him for Spanswick, told him some of the things that were
being said about young Barnes, whereupon Erb left and went into the club
room.  In the club room tables had been arranged in something of the
shape of a capital U, and at the base a wooden hammer had been placed and
a decanter and tumbler; sheets of blue foolscap and scarlet blotting
paper gave the room an official, business-like appearance.  Payne was
there in mufti as to coat, in uniform as to waistcoat and corduroy
trousers; he was to be proposed as Chairman, and he stood now with his
face to a Scotch whisky advertisement, his lips moving silently; he
nodded to Erb, and went on with his rehearsal.  Spanswick coming up with
his <u>entourage</u>, took one of the sheets of paper and, with the stump of a
pencil, began to make calculations which were audited, as he went on, by
his friends.  A few of the men marked the special nature of the
proceedings by smoking cigars.  The alert clock on the mantelpiece struck
the half-hour in a sharp, energetic way and hurried on.
</p><p>“I beg to move that Jack Payne do take the chair.”
</p><p>“I beg to second.”
</p><p>“All in favour,” said the first voice.  “On the contrary?  Carried
unanimously and nem. con.  Jack” (turning to Mr. Payne), “in you go.”
</p><p>“In ordinary circs,” said Payne, after he had taken the chair and had
risen to some applause, “I’m perfectly well aware that the proper course
to pursue at an affair like this is for the chair to call on the
secretary to read the minutes of the last meeting.  I know that without
any of you telling me.  But we’re in the position to-night of not ’aving
no secretary and not ’aving no previous meetin’.”
</p><p>The heads around the table nodded agreement.  A gloomy man seated in the
position that a vice-chairman might have occupied half rose and said,
“Mr. Chairman, sir,” and was at once pulled back into his chair by those
near him.
</p><p>“I was never a man,” went on the Chairman, his forehead damp with
nervousness, “to what you may call force me opinions on any body of men.
’Cepting once, and that was at New Cross in ’89.  I forget exactly what
it was about, and I forget who was there, and I forget what I said, but
the entire incident is quite fresh in my memory, and, as I say, that was
the only occasion on which—”
</p><p>“Question, question,” cried the gloomy man at the other end of the room.
His neighbours hushed him into silence.
</p><p>“I’m coming to the question as fast as ever I can.  Few know better than
me how to conduct a meeting of this kind, although I say it p’raps as
shouldn’t, because it sounds like flattery, but it ain’t flattery, it’s
only the truth.  I’ve had it said to me over and over again, not once or
twice, but many times—”
</p><p>“Mr. Chairman, reely,” said the gloomy man, “I must call you to order.
We shall never get the business done this side of Chris’mas if—”
</p><p>“Kindly sed down,” ordered Mr. Payne, in tones of command, “or else
resume your seat; one or the other.  It’s me,” tapping his waistcoat,
“me, sir, that calls people to order, not you.”
</p><p>The gloomy man argued in a loud whisper with his neighbours, and, on
these counselling that he should simmer down, sat back in his chair,
surveying the ceiling, his lips closed determinedly.
</p><p>“First thing is shall we, being all of a trade, form a separate society,
or shall we jolly well do the other thing?  That’s the point.  Now then,
who’s going to give us a start?  You, my friend, of the Great Eastern,
down at the bottom of this left ’and table, you seem to have a lot to
say, p’raps we might give you ten minutes and see whether or not there’s
any sense in you.”
</p><p>The gloomy man affected deafness until this had been explained to him by
those sitting near, on which he told them rather haughtily that he spoke
when he liked, and not when he was called upon.
</p><p>“Then we must throw the ’andkerchief to somebody else.  Spanswick, you
might set the ball a-rolling.  Don’t be longer than you can ’elp.”
</p><p>Erb watched.  The impression that his rival made now would affect the
later decision, and Erb could not help wishing that Spanswick might prove
halting in utterance and clumsy of speech.  Cheers greeted Spanswick;
some of the men looked at Erb, as they slapped the table with the palms
of their hands to see how <u>he</u> took it, and Erb remembered, just in time,
to join in the compliment.  He recovered his hopefulness as soon as
Spanswick spoke, for he noted that his opponent started with great
rapidity of utterance, speaking also overloudly—encouraging facts both.
Spanswick was, of course, urging that they should form a separate
society, but he had no arguments, only hurried expressions of his own
opinion.  Erb, with his eyes on a sheet of foolscap paper, noticed that
the room relaxed its attention; the gloomy man had his watch out, and was
clearly preparing to shout at the appropriate moment, “Time, time!”
Spanswick halted and went over one sentence twice, word for word.  Then
he stopped altogether, and the silent room saw him endeavour to recall
his fleeting memory, saw him take from the inside pocket of his coat the
entire speech and laboriously find the place.
</p><p>“Beg pardon,” cried the gloomy man, starting up, “but is a member
entitled to read—”
</p><p>Spanswick, with now and again an anxious glance at Erb, read the
remainder of his speech in a shamed undertone.  There was but little
cheering when he finished; he was called up again because he had
forgotten to move the resolution.  Four men competed for the honour of
seconding this.
</p><p>“Now then!” said the Chairman, with relish, “let’s go on in a orderly
manner.  First thing is, any amendment?  No amendment?  Vurry well, then!
Now, is there any further remarks?  The subject hasn’t been, if I may say
so, thor’ly threshed out yet, and if—  Thank you!  Friend Barnes will now
address the meeting.”
</p><p>Erb rose with the slight nervousness that he always felt in commencing a
speech.  He began slowly and quietly: the Great Eastern man saw his
chance for an interruption, and shouted, “Let’s ’ear you,” but Erb took
no notice.  They were there, he said, to inaugurate a great work, a work
to which some of them had given a considerable amount of care, and the
scheme was so far advanced that he thought he could place a few details
before them for consideration.  There had been the grave question whether
they should join the general society of London carmen, or whether they
should form an independent society of their own.
</p><p>“On a point of order, sir—” began the gloomy man.
</p><p>“If there is one man,” said Erb, raising his voice, “in this room who is
absolutely ignorant of order it is our Great Eastern friend at the other
end of the room.  A yelping little terrier that runs after a van doesn’t
make the van go faster.”
</p><p>The room, now very crowded with uniformed men, especially near the
doorway, approved this, and the Great Eastern man first looked round for
support from his own colleagues, and, obtaining none, began to take
desperate notes as Erb went on.
</p><p>“I can’t waste time over a man who can only interrupt: I address myself
to you.  First, let me put my friend Spanswick right on a small detail.
He urged that we should work quietly and secretly”—(cheers from
Spanswick’s supporters)—“I disagree!  I fail to see the usefulness of
that.  I think that all we do should be fair and above board, and I say
this because if you combine, and let the railway companies see that you
are combining, you will be treated with greater respect.  See what’s
happened in the case of my own late fellow carmen!  It’s true I was
sacrificed, but let that pass; see what advantages <u>they</u> got, just for
the asking.  They got—”
</p><p>Payne’s watch must have been suddenly affected, for he allowed Erb to
speak for more than the period of ten minutes; no one complained; they
were all too much interested.  When Erb, in a fiery peroration, appealed
to them to extend the recent action and make it general, with a strong
reference to individualism, which they did not understand, and about
which Erb himself was not quite sure, then the supporters of Spanswick
forgot their reticence and cheered with the rest.
</p><p>“And I trust,” added Erb modestly and finally, “that I ’aven’t took up
too much of your time.”
</p><p>The resolution was carried.
</p><p>“Now,” said the Chair, “if any of you thought of standing me a drink, or
even of ’aving one yourself, p’raps you’ll seize the opportunity whilst
the waiters are in the room, and then we can shut them out whilst we go
on to the next bisness.”
</p><p>“Erb!” cried Spanswick along the table, “what’s yours?”
</p><p>It was felt that this was a great piece of strategy on Spanswick’s part,
and Erb’s refusal counted nothing for righteousness; one or two of Erb’s
supporters shook their heads to intimate that this was not diplomacy.
The waiters brought in japanned trays of glasses on their high,
outstretched palms, carrying change everywhere, in their pockets, in
their tweed caps, in a knot in their handkerchiefs, in their mouths.
They completed their work in a few minutes and went, obeying leisurely
the Chairman’s imperious wave of the hammer.
</p><p>“We come, now,” said Payne loudly, “to what I venture to term the
principal item on the agender.  That is, the appointment of seceretary.”
Both Erb and Spanswick showed signs of puzzled astonishment.  “There’s no
less than two suggestions that have been ’anded up: one is that we should
’ave a honery seceretary, which I may explain for the benefit of some,
means one who will perform his services in a honery way: the other is
that we should ’ave a paid seceretary, which means that we should have to
plank down about a ’undred a year, otherwise, two quid a week, and that’d
cover his slight travelling expenses.  There’s a good deal,” added the
Chair impartially, “to be said on both sides, and, at this stage of the
proceedings, I don’t attempt to dictate.  This room’s a bit warmish, and
if you don’t mind me taking off my coat, why, I shall be more comfortable
than what I am at the present moment.”
</p><p>The men around the table imitated example, and, hanging their jackets on
the backs of the chairs, addressed themselves to the new subject.
</p><p>“What?” said the Chair.  “You woke up again?”
</p><p>“I should like to ask,” said the gloomy Great Eastern man, ignoring this
remark, “whether there’s any sense in paying a ’undred pounds a year for
a article that we can get for nothing?  That’s all I want to know.”
</p><p>“Argue the point, my good sir,” urged the Chair, “argue in a speech.”
</p><p>“I’ve said my say,” retorted the other stubbornly.
</p><p>“If it was the self-same article,” said the Chair, shaking his hammer in
a friendly way towards the Great Eastern man, “then I should be with you.
But is it?”  The shirt sleeves rested on the tables; the men began to
show renewed interest.
</p><p>“I asked a plain question, I want a plain answer!”
</p><p>“Oh!” said the Chair, disgustedly, “you go to—well, I won’t say where.
You’ve got no more idea of conducting a meeting than this ’ammer.  Why
don’t someone prepose a resolution?”
</p><p>“Beg—propose,” said a young man desperately, “my friend Spanswick—honery
sec’tary—new society.”
</p><p>“Beg second that,” jerked another youth.
</p><p>“In view of the fac’,” said a South Eastern man, half rising, “that if
you want a thing done well you ought to pay for it, I think we ought to
’ave a man who’ll devote his whole energies to the work.  Therefore, I
beg to suggest Erb Barnes as—as—”
</p><p>“Organisin’ secretary!” whispered a neighbour.
</p><p>“I second that vote—mean to say, resolution.”
</p><p>“Any other names?” asked the Chair.  “Very good then!  Now, I shall ask
these two chaps to kindly retire, in other words, to leave the room, so
as to leave us free to discuss—”
</p><p>“Point of order occurs to me,” interrupted the gloomy Great Eastern man
acutely, “Can they leave the room?”
</p><p>The room watched Erb and Spanswick as the two made their way behind the
chairs to the doorway.  Erb opened the door, and motioned to Spanswick to
go first, but Spanswick, not to be outdone in politeness, declined
absolutely, insisting that Erb should take precedence, and when they
decided to stop the display of courtesy, both blundered out at the same
moment.  As they closed the door behind them they heard several voices
addressing the chair.
</p><p>“Ever gone in for scarlet runners?” asked Spanswick.  “I’ve only got a
little bit of a garden, but I suppose there isn’t another man in
Rotherhithe that grows the scarlet runners I do; people come from far and
near to see ’em.  There’s a good deal of art, mind you, in the stickin’
of ’em.  Sunflowers, too!  I’ve had tremendous luck with my sunflowers.
I believe I could grow most anything in my little back place if it wasn’t
for the cats.  Vurry good plan of dealin’ with cats—”
</p><p>Erb allowed his rival to make conversation whilst he himself considered
the importance of these moments that were passing.  He looked hard at a
picture on the walls of the landing, a picture representing a cheerful
Swiss valley and advertising Somebody’s Ginger Beer; the villagers held
goblets containing (presumably) this beverage, and toasted the
snow-topped mountains at the back.  He forced himself to recognise that
his chances were small; unless he had made a particularly good impression
by his speech he had no chance at all; he would have to commence
to-morrow morning a round of calls on master carmen and on contracting
firms with the obsequious inquiry, “You don’t ’appen to want a hand, I
s’pose?” and receiving the negative reply.  He had obtained a clean
character from the Railway Company, and the Chief had wished him
good-luck, but the information that he was a stirabout would fly round in
advance of him, and all the best places would be on the defensive.  It
might come to driving a cheap coal van, otherwise known as working in the
slate business.  There was an alternative even less agreeable to think
of.  He knew one or two men who had just missed being leaders of labour,
who sometimes opened debates at Clubs, and were paid fairly liberal
expenses, who were sometimes approached by the capitalists to stump
through London in an endeavour to lash working men into a state of
indignation in regard to Foreign Competition, Sugar Bounties, or the
tyranny of Trades Unions, or some other subject for which the capitalists
had affection: these men at times coalesced and, urged by a common
jealousy, denounced some prominent men of their own party, and found
their names mentioned in the opposition journals, the reporters of which
bribed them in order to obtain exclusive information of semi-public
meetings.  Erb told the Swiss valley that it would be long ere he came
down to that.
</p><p>“You take a spade,” exclaimed his companion, “an ornery spade will do,
and you dig it in the garden like so, and what do you find?  Why you
find—”
</p><p>Young Louisa would be disappointed too.  Louisa had been less successful
since the servants’ dance at Eaton Square in cloaking her admiration for
her brother, and the last young man had been dismissed with ignominy
because he showed hesitation in sacrificing his own views on political
subjects and accepting those held by Erb.  If he had not already passed
from the memory of Lady Frances, she might perhaps inquire of Alice the
result of the meeting, and, hearing it, would smile agreeably and push
him away from her thoughts.  To be shown through Bermondsey by an
official in the labour world would be one thing; to be conducted by a
grimy-faced carman was another.  And there was Rosalind—Rosalind—what was
her other name?
</p><p>“Now, in regard to meenure,” said Spanswick dogmatically, “the long and
short of the matter is simply this.”
</p><p>He had found in Southampton Street, Camberwell, on the previous day
(being on the Surrey side round), a painted board on a house announcing
here, “Elocution and Public Speaking Taught!  Pupils prepared for the
Dramatic Stage!  Apply within to Professor Danks!” and it then occurred
to him that this was the address given him by the footman in Eaton
Square.  The front garden was filled with monumental statues belonging to
an undertaker next door, and engraved with names and dates, tombstones
which for some inexplicable reason had not been used.  He had gone up the
uneven pavement from the front gate to the door and had knocked there,
but the door being opened by the tall, bright-eyed girl, plainly and
economically dressed, and with a suggestion of care near to her bright
eyes, he had for some extraordinary reason, muttered “Beg pardon.  Wrong
number!” and had stumbled back to the gate, hot-faced with confusion.  He
knew that his powers of speech lacked refinement, and one or two
finishing lessons would work miracles: he might perhaps learn how to
aspirate without the show of pain and anxiety that he exhibited now when
he endeavoured to observe the trying rule.  The bright-eyed girl, he
remembered, had stood at the doorway looking after him rather
reproachfully.
</p><p>“Of course,” said the injured voice of Spanswick, “if it’s too much
trouble for you to listen, why it isn’t any use me talking.”
</p><p>“Sorry,” he said absently.  “Fact is, I don’t take very much interest in
gardening.”
</p><p>“I was talking about poultry.”
</p><p>“They both come under the same head,” remarked Erb.
</p><p>“I suppose, as a matter of fact, you’re pretty keen on this ’ere job?”
</p><p>“They’re a long time deciding,” said Erb.
</p><p>“I’ve been expectin’,” Spanswick made circles on the landing with his
right foot in a hesitating way, “I’ve been expectin’ that you’d approach
me and ask me to withdraw from the contest.”
</p><p>“What’d be the use of that?”
</p><p>“Well,” said Spanswick in a mysterious whisper, “you know what
Shakespeare says?”
</p><p>“He said a lot.”
</p><p>“You’re a mere kid in these matters,” remarked the other contemptuously,
walking away to the other end of the landing.  “Haven’t you never ’eard
of buying off the opposition?  In the present case, suppose you was to
say, ‘Spanny, old man, is twen’y-five bob any use to you?’ and I should
answer ‘Well, I could do with it,’ and you paid the money over ’ere.”
Spanswick held out one hand.  “And I said, ‘Well, now, come to think of
it, what’s the good of this job to me?  I shan’t make nothing out of it,
unless it is a silver teapot for the missus; I’ll withdraw my nomination
and leave you a clear field.’  See?”
</p><p>“Upon my word,” exclaimed Erb indignantly, “upon my word if you ain’t the
biggest—”
</p><p>“Mind you,” interrupted the other, “I was only putting a suppositious
case.”  The door of the club room opened, and a voice said importantly,
“Spanswick and Barnes, this way, please.”  They turned to obey.  “There
y’are,” said Spanswick reproachfully, “you’ve left it too late.”
</p><p>Looking over the banisters, Erb saw that women-folk had arrived, charged
with the double duty of listening to the coming concert and of conveying
their male relatives home at a reasonable hour.  Louisa’s white young
face glanced up at him with a twitch, and asked anxiously whether it was
all over; Erb replied that, on the contrary, it was just about to begin.
</p><p>“Kindly take your former seats,” said the Chairman importantly.  The
chattering room became quiet as the two men entered, and Payne rapped
with his hammer for silence.  “The voting has come out,” he went on,
looking at some figures on the sheet of foolscap before him, “the voting
has come out 29 on one side and 14 on the other.”
</p><p>The rattle of conversation recommenced.
</p><p>“Less noise there, less noise!” cried the Chair urgently.  “I can’t ’ear
meself talk.”
</p><p>“Wish we couldn’t,” remarked the Great Eastern man from his end of the
table.
</p><p>“Be careful, my friend,” said the Chair warningly.  “Be careful, or else
I shall rule you out of order.  I have the pleasure now of calling on my
friend Erb Barnes.”  The room cheered.  “Order, please, for Erb Barnes.”
</p><p>“What have I got to talk about?” demanded Erb.
</p><p>“Talk about?” echoed the Chair amazedly.  “Talk about?  Why, you’ve got
to acknowledge in a few appropriate words your appointment as paid
organisin’ secretary of the Railway Carmen’s Society.”
