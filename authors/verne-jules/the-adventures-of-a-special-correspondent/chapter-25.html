<P>And I, who wanted &quot;incident,&quot; who feared the weariness of a monotonous voyage
of six thousand kilometres, in the course of which I should not meet with an
impression or emotion worth clothing in type!</P>
<P>I have made another muddle of it, I admit! My lord Faruskiar, of whom I had
made a hero&mdash;by telegraph&mdash;for the readers of the <I>Twentieth. Century</I>.
Decidedly my good intentions ought certainly to qualify me as one of the best
paviers of a road to a certain place you have doubtless heard of.</P>
<P>We are, as I have said, two hundred yards from the valley of the Tjon, so
deep and wide as to require a viaduct from three hundred and fifty to four
hundred feet long. The floor of the valley is scattered over with rocks, and a
hundred feet down. If the train had been hurled to the bottom of that chasm, not
one of us would have escaped alive. This memorable catastrophe&mdash;most interesting
from a reporter&apos;s point of view&mdash;would have claimed a hundred victims. But thanks
to the coolness, energy and devotion of the young Roumanian, we have escaped
this terrible disaster.</P>
<P>All? No! Kinko has paid with his life for the safety of his fellow
passengers.</P>
<P>Amid the confusion my first care was to visit the luggage van, which had
remained uninjured. Evidently if Kinko had survived the explosion he would have
got back into his box and waited till I put myself in communication with
him.</P>
<P>Alas! The coffer is empty&mdash;empty as that of a company which has suspended
payment. Kinko has been the victim of his sacrifice.</P>
<P>And so there has been a hero among our traveling companions, and he was not
this Faruskiar, this abominable bandit hidden beneath the skin of a manager,
whose name I have so stupidly published over the four corners of the globe! It
was this Roumanian, this humble, this little, this poor fellow, whose sweetheart
will wait for him in vain, and whom she will never again see! Well, I will do
him justice! I will tell what he has done. As to his secret, I shall be sorry if
I keep it. If he defrauded the Grand Transasiatic, it is thanks to that fraud
that a whole train has been saved. We were lost, we should have perished in the
most horrible of deaths if Kinko had not been there!</P>
<P>I went back on to the line, my heart heavy, my eyes full of tears.</P>
<P>Assuredly Faruskiar&apos;s scheme&mdash;in the execution of which he had executed his
rival Ki-Tsang&mdash;had been cleverly contrived in utilizing this branch line leading
to the unfinished viaduct. Nothing was easier than to switch off the train if an
accomplice was at the points. And as soon as the signal was given that we were
on the branch, all he had to do was to gain the foot-plate, kill the driver and
stoker, slow the train and get off, leaving the steam on full to work up to full
speed.</P>
<P>And now there could be no doubt that the scoundrels worthy of the most
refined tortures that Chinese practice could devise were hastening down into the
Tjon valley. There, amid the wreck of the train, they expected to find the
fifteen millions of gold and precious stones, and this treasure they could carry
off without fear of surprise when the night enabled them to consummate this
fearful crime. Well! They have been robbed, these robbers, and I hope that they
will pay for their crime with their lives, at the least. I alone know what has
passed, but I will tell the story, for poor Kinko is no more.</P>
<P>Yes! My mind is made up. I will speak as soon as I have seen Zinca Klork. The
poor girl must be told with consideration. The death of her betrothed must not
come upon her like a thunderclap. Yes! To-morrow, as soon as we are at
Pekin.</P>
<P>After all, if I do not say anything about Kinko, I may at least denounce
Faruskiar and Ghangir and the four Mongols. I can say that I saw them go through
the van, that I followed them, that I found they were talking on the gangway,
that I heard the screams of the driver and stoker as they were strangled on the
foot-plate, and that I then returned to the cars shouting: &quot;Back! Back!&quot; or
whatever it was.</P>
<P>Besides, as will be seen immediately, there was somebody else whose just
suspicions had been changed into certainty, who only awaited his opportunity to
denounce Faruskiar.</P>
<P>We are now standing at the head of the train, Major Noltitz, the German
baron, Caterna, Ephrinell, Pan-Chao, Popof, about twenty travelers in all. The
Chinese guard, faithful to their trust, are still near the treasure which not
one of them has abandoned. The rear guard has brought along the tail lamps, and
by their powerful light we can see in what a state the engine is.</P>
<P>If the train, which was then running at enormous velocity, had not stopped
suddenly&mdash;and thus brought about its destruction&mdash;it was because the boiler had
exploded at the top and on the side. The wheels being undamaged, the engine had
run far enough to come gradually to a standstill of itself, and thus the
passengers had been saved a violent shock.</P>
<P>Of the boiler and its accessories only a few shapeless fragments remained.
The funnel had gone, the dome, the steam chest; there was nothing but torn
plates, broken, twisted tubes, split cylinders, and loose connecting rods&mdash;gaping
wounds in the corpse of steel.</P>
<P>And not only had the engine been destroyed, but the tender had been rendered
useless. Its tank had been cracked, and its load of coals scattered over the
line. The luggage-van, curious to relate, had miraculously escaped without
injury.</P>
<P>And looking at the terrible effects of the explosion, I could see that the
Roumanian had had no chance of escape, and had probably been blown to
fragments.</P>
<P>Going a hundred yards down the line I could find no trace of him&mdash;which was
not to be wondered at.</P>
<P>At first we looked on at the disaster in silence; but eventually conversation
began.</P>
<P>&quot;It is only too evident,&quot; said one of the passengers, &quot;that our driver and
stoker have perished in the explosion.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Poor fellows!&quot; said Popof. &quot;But I wonder how the train could have got on the
Nanking branch without being noticed?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The night was very dark,&quot; said Ephrinell, &quot;and the driver could not see the
points.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is the only explanation possible,&quot; said Popof, &quot;for he would have tried
to stop the train, and, on the contrary, we were traveling at tremendous
speed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But,&quot; said Pan-Chao, &quot;how does it happen the Nanking branch was open when
the Tjon viaduct is not finished? Had the switch been interfered with?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Undoubtedly,&quot; said Popof, &quot;and probably out of carelessness.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; said Ephrinell, deliberately. &quot;There has been a crime&mdash;a crime intended
to bring about the destruction of the train and passengers&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And with what object?&quot; asked Popof.</P>
<P>&quot;The object of stealing the imperial treasure,&quot; said Ephrinell. &quot;Do you
forget that those millions would be a temptation to scoundrels? Was it not for
the purpose of robbing the train that we were attacked between Tchertchen and
Tcharkalyk?&quot;</P>
<P>The American could not have been nearer the truth.</P>
<P>&quot;And so,&quot; said Popof, &quot;after Ki-Tsang&apos;s attempt, you think that other
bandits&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>Up to now Major Noltitz had taken no part in the discussion. Now he
interrupted Popof, and in a voice heard by all he asked:</P>
<P>&quot;Where is Faruskiar?&quot;</P>
<P>They all looked about and tried to discover what had become of the manager of
the Transasiatic.</P>
<P>&quot;And where is his friend Ghangir?&quot; asked the major.</P>
<P>There was no reply.</P>
<P>&quot;And where are the four Mongols who were in the rear van?&quot; asked Major
Noltitz.</P>
<P>And none of them presented themselves.</P>
<P>They called my lord Faruskiar a second time.</P>
<P>Faruskiar made no response.</P>
<P>Popof entered the car where this personage was generally to be found.</P>
<P>It was empty.</P>
<P>Empty? No. Sir Francis Trevellyan was calmly seated in his place, utterly
indifferent to all that happened. Was it any business of his? Not at all. Was he
not entitled to consider that the Russo-Chinese railways were the very apex of
absurdity and disorder? A switch opened, nobody knew by whom! A train on the
wrong line! Could anything be more ridiculous than this Russian
mismanagement?</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then!&quot; said Major Noltitz, &quot;the rascal who sent us on to the Nanking
line, who would have hurled us into the Tjon valley, to walk off with the
imperial treasure, is Faruskiar.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Faruskiar!&quot; the passengers exclaimed. And most of them refused to believe
it.</P>
<P>&quot;What!&quot; said Popof. &quot;The manager of the company who so courageously drove off
the bandits and killed their chief Ki-Tsang with his own hand?&quot;</P>
<P>Then I entered on the scene.</P>
<P>&quot;The major is not mistaken. It was Faruskiar who laid this fine trap for
us.&quot;</P>
<P>And amid the general stupefaction I told them what I knew, and what good
fortune had enabled me to ascertain. I told them how I had overheard the plan of
Faruskiar and his Mongols, when it was too late to stop it, but I was silent
regarding the intervention of Kinko. The moment had not come, and I would do him
justice in due time.</P>
<P>To my words there succeeded a chorus of maledictions and menaces.</P>
<P>What! This seigneur Faruskiar, this superb Mongol, this functionary we had
seen at work! No! It was impossible.</P>
<P>But they had to give in to the evidence. I had seen; I had heard; I affirmed
that Faruskiar was the author of this catastrophe in which all our train might
have perished, was the most consummate bandit who had ever disgraced Central
Asia!</P>
<P>&quot;You see, Monsieur Bombarnac,&quot; said Major Noltitz, &quot;that I was not mistaken
in my first suspicion.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is only too true,&quot; I replied, without any false modesty, &quot;that I was
taken in by the grand manners of the abominable rascal.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur Claudius,&quot; said Caterna, &quot;put that into a romance, and see if
anybody believes it likely.&quot;</P>
<P>Caterna was right; but unlikely as it may seem, it was. And, besides, I alone
knew Kinko&apos;s secret. It certainly did seem as though it was miraculous for the
locomotive to explode just on the verge of the abyss.</P>
<P>Now that all danger had disappeared we must take immediate measures for
running back the cars on to the Pekin line.</P>
<P>&quot;The best thing to do is for one of us to volunteer&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will do that,&quot; said Caterna.</P>
<P>&quot;What is he to do?&quot; I asked.</P>
<P>&quot;Go to the nearest station, that of Fuen Choo, and telegraph to Tai-Youan for
them to send on a relief engine.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How far is it to Fuen Choo?&quot; asked Ephrinell.</P>
<P>&quot;About six kilometres to Nanking junction, and about five kilometres beyond
that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Eleven kilometres,&quot; said the major; &quot;that is a matter of an hour and a half
for good walkers. Before three o&apos;clock the engine from Tai-Youan ought to be
here. I am ready to start.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So am I,&quot; said Popof! &quot;I think several of us ought to go. Who knows if we
may not meet Faruskiar and his Mongols on the road?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are right, Popof,&quot; said Major Noltitz, &quot;and we should be armed.&quot;</P>
<P>This was only prudent, for the bandits who ought to be on their way to the
Tjon viaduct could not be very far off. Of course, as soon as they found that
their attempt had failed, they would hasten to get away. How would they dare&mdash;six
strong&mdash;to attack a hundred passengers, including the Chinese guard?</P>
<P>Twelve of us, including Pan-Chao, Caterna, and myself, volunteered to
accompany Major Noltitz. But by common accord we advised Popof not to abandon
the train, assuring him that we would do all that was necessary at Fuen
Choo.</P>
<P>Then, armed with daggers and revolvers&mdash;it was one o&apos;clock in the morning&mdash;we
went along the line to the junction, walking as fast as the very dark night
permitted.</P>
<P>In less than two hours we arrived at Fuen Choo station without adventure.
Evidently Faruskiar had cleared off. The Chinese police would have to deal with
the bandit and his accomplices. Would they catch him? I hoped so, but I
doubted.</P>
<P>At the station Pan-Chao explained matters to the stationmaster, who
telegraphed for an engine to be sent from Tai-Youan to the Nanking line.</P>
<P>At three o&apos;clock, just at daybreak, we returned to wait for the engine at the
junction. Three-quarters of an hour afterwards its whistle announced its
approach, and it stopped at the bifurcation of the lines. We climbed up on to
the tender, and half an hour later had rejoined the train.</P>
<P>The dawn had come on sufficiently for us to be able to see over a
considerable distance. Without saying anything to anybody, I went in search of
the body of my poor Kinko. And I could not find it among the wreck.</P>
<P>As the engine could not reach the front of the train, owing to their being
only a single line, and no turning-table, it was decided to couple it on in the
rear and run backwards to the junction. In this way the box, alas! without the
Roumanian in it, was in the last carriage.</P>
<P>We started, and in half an hour we were on the main line again.</P>
<P>Fortunately it was not necessary for us to return to Tai-Youan, and we thus
saved a delay of an hour and a half. At the junction the engine was detached and
run for a few yards towards Pekin, then the vans and cars, one by one, were
pushed on to the main line, and then the engine backed and the train proceeded,
made up as before the accident. By five o&apos;clock we were on our way across
Petchili as if nothing had happened.</P>
<P>I have nothing to say regarding this latter half of the journey, during which
the Chinese driver&mdash;to do him justice&mdash;in no way endeavored to make up for lost
time. But if a few hours more or less were of no importance to us, it was
otherwise with Baron Weissschnitzerdörfer, who wanted to catch the Yokohama boat
at Tien Tsin.</P>
<P>When we arrived there at noon the steamer had been gone for three-quarters of
an hour; and when the German globetrotter, the rival of Bly and Bisland, rushed
on to the platform, it was to learn that the said steamer was then going out of
the mouths of the Pei-Ho into the open sea.</P>
<P>Unfortunate traveler! We were not astonished when, as Gaterna said, the baron
&quot;let go both broadsides&quot; of Teutonic maledictions. And really he had cause to
curse in his native tongue.</P>
<P>We remained but a quarter of an hour at Tien Tsin. My readers must pardon me
for not having visited this city of five hundred thousand inhabitants, the
Chinese town with its temples, the European quarter in which the trade is
concentrated, the Pei-Ho quays where hundreds of junks load and unload. It was
all Faruskiar&apos;s fault, and were it only for having wrecked my reportorial
endeavors he ought to be hanged by the most fantastic executioner in China.</P>
<P>Nothing happened for the rest of our run. I was very sorry at the thought
that I was not bringing Kinko along with me, and that his box was empty. And he
had asked me to accompany him to Mademoiselle Zinca Klork! How could I tell this
unfortunate girl that her sweetheart would never reach Pekin station?</P>
<P>Everything ends in this world below, even a voyage of six thousand kilometres
on the Grand Transasiatic; and after a run of thirteen days, hour after hour,
our train stopped at the gates of the capital of the Celestial Empire.</P>
