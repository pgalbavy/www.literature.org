<p>The Grill is the club most difficult of access in the world. To be
placed on its rolls distinguishes the new member as greatly as though he
had received a vacant Garter or had been caricatured in “Vanity Fair.”
</p>
<p>Men who belong to the Grill Club never mention that fact. If you were
to ask one of them which clubs he frequents, he will name all save that
particular one. He is afraid if he told you he belonged to the Grill,
that it would sound like boasting.
</p><p>The Grill Club dates back to the days when Shakespeare’s Theatre stood
on the present site of the “Times” office. It has a golden Grill which
Charles the Second presented to the Club, and the original manuscript
of “Tom and Jerry in London,” which was bequeathed to it by Pierce Egan
himself. The members, when they write letters at the Club, still use
sand to blot the ink.
</p><p>The Grill enjoys the distinction of having blackballed, without
political prejudice, a Prime Minister of each party. At the same sitting
at which one of these fell, it elected, on account of his brogue and his
bulls, Quiller, Q. C., who was then a penniless barrister.
</p><p>When Paul Preval, the French artist who came to London by royal command
to paint a portrait of the Prince of Wales, was made an honorary
member--only foreigners may be honorary members--he said, as he signed
his first wine card, “I would rather see my name on that, than on a
picture in the Louvre.”
</p><p>At which Quiller remarked, “That is a devil of a compliment, because
the only men who can read their names in the Louvre to-day have been
dead fifty years.”
</p><p>On the night after the great fog of 1897 there were five members in
the Club, four of them busy with supper and one reading in front of the
fireplace. There is only one room to the Club, and one long table. At
the far end of the room the fire of the grill glows red, and, when the
fat falls, blazes into flame, and at the other there is a broad bow
window of diamond panes, which looks down upon the street. The four men
at the table were strangers to each other, but as they picked at the
grilled bones, and sipped their Scotch and soda, they conversed with
such charming animation that a visitor to the Club, which does
not tolerate visitors, would have counted them as friends of long
acquaintance, certainly not as Englishmen who had met for the first
time, and without the form of an introduction. But it is the etiquette
and tradition of the Grill, that whoever enters it must speak with
whomever he finds there. It is to enforce this rule that there is but
one long table, and whether there are twenty men at it or two, the
waiters, supporting the rule, will place them side by side.
</p><p>For this reason the four strangers at supper were seated together, with
the candles grouped about them, and the long length of the table cutting
a white path through the outer gloom.
</p><p>“I repeat,” said the gentleman with the black pearl stud, “that the days
for romantic adventure and deeds of foolish daring have passed, and that
the fault lies with ourselves. Voyages to the pole I do not catalogue
as adventures. That African explorer, young Chetney, who turned up
yesterday after he was supposed to have died in Uganda, did nothing
adventurous. He made maps and explored the sources of rivers. He was
in constant danger, but the presence of danger does not constitute
adventure. Were that so, the chemist who studies high explosives, or
who investigates deadly poisons, passes through adventures daily. No,
‘adventures are for the adventurous.’ But one no longer ventures. The
spirit of it has died of inertia. We are grown too practical, too just,
above all, too sensible. In this room, for instance, members of this
Club have, at the sword’s point, disputed the proper scanning of one
of Pope’s couplets. Over so weighty a matter as spilled Burgundy on a
gentleman’s cuff, ten men fought across this table, each with his
rapier in one hand and a candle in the other. All ten were wounded. The
question of the spilled Burgundy concerned but two of them. The eight
others engaged because they were men of ‘spirit.’ They were, indeed, the
first gentlemen of the day. To-night, were you to spill Burgundy on
my cuff, were you even to insult me grossly, these gentlemen would not
consider it incumbent upon them to kill each other. They would separate
us, and to-morrow morning appear as witnesses against us at Bow Street.
We have here to-night, in the persons of Sir Andrew and myself, an
illustration of how the ways have changed.”
</p><p>The men around the table turned and glanced toward the gentleman in
front of the fireplace. He was an elderly and somewhat portly person,
with a kindly, wrinkled countenance, which wore continually a smile
of almost childish confidence and good-nature. It was a face which the
illustrated prints had made intimately familiar. He held a book from him
at arm’s-length, as if to adjust his eyesight, and his brows were knit
with interest.
</p><p>[Illustration: 03 The men around the table turned]
</p><p>“Now, were this the eighteenth century,” continued the gentleman with
the black pearl, “when Sir Andrew left the Club to-night I would have
him bound and gagged and thrown into a sedan chair. The watch would not
interfere, the passers-by would take to their heels, my hired bullies
and ruffians would convey him to some lonely spot where we would guard
him until morning. Nothing would come of it, except added reputation to
myself as a gentleman of adventurous spirit, and possibly an essay in
the ‘Tatler,’ with stars for names, entitled, let us say, ‘The Budget
and the Baronet.’”
</p><p>“But to what end, sir?” inquired the youngest of the members. “And
why Sir Andrew, of all persons--why should you select him for this
adventure?”
</p><p>The gentleman with the black pearl shrugged his shoulders.
</p><p>“It would prevent him speaking in the House to-night. The Navy Increase
Bill,” he added gloomily. “It is a Government measure, and Sir Andrew
speaks for it. And so great is his influence and so large his following
that if he does”--the gentleman laughed ruefully--“if he does, it will
go through. Now, had I the spirit of our ancestors,” he exclaimed, “I
would bring chloroform from the nearest chemist’s and drug him in that
chair. I would tumble his unconscious form into a hansom cab, and hold
him prisoner until daylight. If I did, I would save the British taxpayer
the cost of five more battleships, many millions of pounds.”
</p><p>[Illustration: 04 I would tumble his unconscious form into a hansom cab]
</p><p>The gentlemen again turned, and surveyed the baronet with freshened
interest. The honorary member of the Grill, whose accent already had
betrayed him as an American, laughed softly.
</p><p>“To look at him now,” he said, “one would not guess he was deeply
concerned with the affairs of state.”
</p><p>The others nodded silently.
</p><p>“He has not lifted his eyes from that book since we first entered,”
 added the youngest member. “He surely cannot mean to speak to-night.”
</p><p>“Oh, yes, he will speak,” muttered the one with the black pearl moodily.
“During these last hours of the session the House sits late, but when
the Navy bill comes up on its third reading he will be in his place--and
he will pass it.”
</p><p>The fourth member, a stout and florid gentleman of a somewhat sporting
appearance, in a short smoking-jacket and black tie, sighed enviously.
</p><p>“Fancy one of us being as cool as that, if he knew he had to stand up
within an hour and rattle off a speech in Parliament. I ‘d be in a devil
of a funk myself. And yet he is as keen over that book he’s reading as
though he had nothing before him until bedtime.”
</p><p>“Yes, see how eager he is,” whispered the youngest member. “He does
not lift his eyes even now when he cuts the pages. It is probably an
Admiralty Report, or some other weighty work of statistics which bears
upon his speech.”
</p><p>The gentleman with the black pearl laughed morosely.
</p><p>“The weighty work in which the eminent statesman is so deeply
engrossed,” he said, “is called ‘The Great Rand Robbery.’ It is a
detective novel, for sale at all bookstalls.”
</p><p>The American raised his eyebrows in disbelief.
</p><p>“‘The Great Rand Robbery’?” he repeated incredulously. “What an odd
taste!”
</p><p>“It is not a taste, it is his vice,” returned the gentleman with the
pearl stud. “It is his one dissipation. He is noted for it. You, as a
stranger, could hardly be expected to know of this idiosyncrasy. Mr.
Gladstone sought relaxation in the Greek poets, Sir Andrew finds his in
Gaboriau. Since I have been a member of Parliament I have never seen him
in the library without a shilling shocker in his hands. He brings them
even into the sacred precincts of the House, and from the Government
benches reads them concealed inside his hat. Once started on a tale of
murder, robbery, and sudden death, nothing can tear him from it, not
even the call of the division bell, nor of hunger, nor the prayers of
the party Whip. He gave up his country house because when he journeyed
to it in the train he would become so absorbed in his detective
stories that he was invariably carried past his station.” The member of
Parliament twisted his pearl stud nervously, and bit at the edge of his
mustache. “If it only were the first pages of ‘The Rand Robbery’ that
he were reading,” he murmured bitterly, “instead of the last! With such
another book as that, I swear I could hold him here until morning. There
would be no need of chloroform to keep him from the House.”
</p><p>The eyes of all were fastened upon Sir Andrew, and each saw with
fascination that with his forefinger he was now separating the last two
pages of the book. The member of Parliament struck the table softly with
his open palm.
</p><p>“I would give a hundred pounds,” he whispered, “if I could place in his
hands at this moment a new story of Sherlock Holmes--a thousand pounds,”
 he added wildly--“five thousand pounds!”
</p><p>The American observed the speaker sharply, as though the words bore to
him some special application, and then at an idea which apparently had
but just come to him, smiled in great embarrassment.
</p><p>Sir Andrew ceased reading, but, as though still under the influence of
the book, sat looking blankly into the open fire. For a brief space no
one moved until the baronet withdrew his eyes and, with a sudden start
of recollection, felt anxiously for his watch. He scanned its face
eagerly, and scrambled to his feet.
</p><p>The voice of the American instantly broke the silence in a high, nervous
accent.
</p><p>“And yet Sherlock Holmes himself,” he cried, “could not decipher the
mystery which to-night baffles the police of London.”
</p><p>At these unexpected words, which carried in them something of the tone
of a challenge, the gentlemen about the table started as suddenly as
though the American had fired a pistol in the air, and Sir Andrew halted
abruptly and stood observing him with grave surprise.
</p><p>The gentleman with the black pearl was the first to recover.
</p><p>“Yes, yes,” he said eagerly, throwing himself across the table. “A
mystery that baffles the police of London.
</p><p>[Illustration: 05 “My name,” he said, “is Sears.”]
</p><p>“I have heard nothing of it. Tell us at once, pray do--tell us at once.”
</p><p>The American flushed uncomfortably, and picked uneasily at the
tablecloth.
</p><p>“No one but the police has heard of it,” he murmured, “and they only
through me. It is a remarkable crime, to, which, unfortunately, I am the
only person who can bear witness. Because I am the only witness, I
am, in spite of my immunity as a diplomat, detained in London by the
authorities of Scotland Yard. My name,” he said, inclining his head
politely, “is Sears, Lieutenant Ripley Sears of the United States Navy,
at present Naval Attache to the Court of Russia. Had I not been detained
to-day by the police I would have started this morning for Petersburg.”
</p><p>The gentleman with the black pearl interrupted with so pronounced an
exclamation of excitement and delight that the American stammered and
ceased speaking.
</p><p>“Do you hear, Sir Andrew!” cried the member of Parliament jubilantly.
“An American diplomat halted by our police because he is the only
witness of a most remarkable crime--<u>the</u> most remarkable crime, I
believe you said, sir,” he added, bending eagerly toward the naval
officer, “which has occurred in London in many years.”
</p><p>The American moved his head in assent and glanced at the two other
members. They were looking doubtfully at him, and the face of each
showed that he was greatly perplexed.
</p><p>Sir Andrew advanced to within the light of the candles and drew a chair
toward him.
</p><p>“The crime must be exceptional indeed,” he said, “to justify the police
in interfering with a representative of a friendly power. If I were not
forced to leave at once, I should take the liberty of asking you to tell
us the details.”
</p><p>The gentleman with the pearl pushed the chair toward Sir Andrew, and
motioned him to be seated.
</p><p>“You cannot leave us now,” he exclaimed. “Mr. Sears is just about to
tell us of this remarkable crime.”
</p><p>He nodded vigorously at the naval officer and the American, after first
glancing doubtfully toward the servants at the far end of the room,
leaned forward across the table. The others drew their chairs nearer and
bent toward him. The baronet glanced irresolutely at his watch, and with
an exclamation of annoyance snapped down the lid. “They can wait,” he
muttered. He seated himself quickly and nodded at Lieutenant Sears.
</p><p>“If you will be so kind as to begin, sir,” he said impatiently.
</p><p>“Of course,” said the American, “you understand that I understand that
I am speaking to gentlemen. The confidences of this Club are inviolate.
Until the police give the facts to the public press, I must consider you
my confederates. You have heard nothing, you know no one connected with
this mystery. Even I must remain anonymous.”
</p><p>The gentlemen seated around him nodded gravely.
</p><p>“Of course,” the baronet assented with eagerness, “of course.”
</p><p>“We will refer to it,” said the gentleman with the black pearl, “as ‘The
Story of the Naval Attache.’”
</p><p>“I arrived in London two days ago,” said the American, “and I engaged a
room at the Bath Hotel. I know very few people in London, and even the
members of our embassy were strangers to me. But in Hong Kong I had
become great pals with an officer in your navy, who has since retired,
and who is now living in a small house in Rutland Gardens opposite the
Knightsbridge barracks. I telegraphed him that I was in London, and
yesterday morning I received a most hearty invitation to dine with him
the same evening at his house. He is a bachelor, so we dined alone and
talked over all our old days on the Asiatic Station, and of the changes
which had come to us since we had last met there. As I was leaving the
next morning for my post at Petersburg, and had many letters to write,
I told him, about ten o’clock, that I must get back to the hotel, and he
sent out his servant to call a hansom.
</p><p>“For the next quarter of an hour, as we sat talking, we could hear the
cab whistle sounding violently from the doorstep, but apparently with no
result.
</p><p>“‘It cannot be that the cabmen are on strike,’ my friend said, as he
rose and walked to the window.
</p><p>“He pulled back the curtains and at once called to me.
</p><p>“‘You have never seen a London fog, have you?’ he asked. ‘Well, come
here. This is one of the best, or, rather, one of the worst, of them.’ I
joined him at the window, but I could see nothing. Had I not known that
the house looked out upon the street I would have believed that I was
facing a dead wall. I raised the sash and stretched out my head, but
still I could see nothing. Even the light of the street lamps opposite,
and in the upper windows of the barracks, had been smothered in the
yellow mist. The lights of the room in which I stood penetrated the fog
only to the distance of a few inches from my eyes.
</p><p>“Below me the servant was still sounding his whistle, but I could afford
to wait no longer, and told my friend that I would try and find the way
to my hotel on foot. He objected, but the letters I had to write were
for the Navy Department, and, besides, I had always heard that to be out
in a London fog was the most wonderful experience, and I was curious to
investigate one for myself.
</p><p>“My friend went with me to his front door, and laid down a course for me
to follow. I was first to walk straight across the street to the brick
wall of the Knightsbridge Barracks. I was then to feel my way along the
wall until I came to a row of houses set back from the sidewalk. They
would bring me to a cross street. On the other side of this street was
a row of shops which I was to follow until they joined the iron railings
of Hyde Park. I was to keep to the railings until I reached the gates
at Hyde Park Corner, where I was to lay a diagonal course across
Piccadilly, and tack in toward the railings of Green Park. At the end
of these railings, going east, I would find the Walsingham, and my own
hotel.
</p><p>“To a sailor the course did not seem difficult, so I bade my friend
goodnight and walked forward until my feet touched the paving. I
continued upon it until I reached the curbing of the sidewalk. A few
steps further, and my hands struck the wall of the barracks. I turned
in the direction from which I had just come, and saw a square of faint
light cut in the yellow fog. I shouted ‘All right,’ and the voice of
my friend answered, ‘Good luck to you.’ The light from his open door
disappeared with a bang, and I was left alone in a dripping, yellow
darkness. I have been in the Navy for ten years, but I have never known
such a fog as that of last night, not even among the icebergs of Behring
Sea. There one at least could see the light of the binnacle, but last
night I could not even distinguish the hand by which I guided myself
along the barrack wall. At sea a fog is a natural phenomenon. It is as
familiar as the rainbow which follows a storm, it is as proper that
a fog should spread upon the waters as that steam shall rise from a
kettle. But a fog which springs from the paved streets, that rolls
between solid house-fronts, that forces cabs to move at half speed, that
drowns policemen and extinguishes the electric lights of the music hall,
that to me is incomprehensible. It is as out of place as a tidal wave on
Broadway.
</p><p>“As I felt my way along the wall, I encountered other men who were
coming from the opposite direction, and each time when we hailed each
other I stepped away from the wall to make room for them to pass. But
the third time I did this, when I reached out my hand, the wall had
disappeared, and the further I moved to find it the further I seemed
to be sinking into space. I had the unpleasant conviction that at any
moment I might step over a precipice. Since I had set out I had heard
no traffic in the street, and now, although I listened some minutes, I
could only distinguish the occasional footfalls of pedestrians. Several
times I called aloud, and once a jocular gentleman answered me, but only
to ask me where I thought he was, and then even he was swallowed up in
the silence. Just above me I could make out a jet of gas which I guessed
came from a street lamp, and I moved over to that, and, while I tried
to recover my bearings, kept my hand on the iron post. Except for this
flicker of gas, no larger than the tip of my finger, I could distinguish
nothing about me. For the rest, the mist hung between me and the world
like a damp and heavy blanket.
</p><p>“I could hear voices, but I could not tell from whence they came, and
the scrape of a foot moving cautiously, or a muffled cry as some one
stumbled, were the only sounds that reached me.
</p><p>“I decided that until some one took me in tow I had best remain where
I was, and it must have been for ten minutes that I waited by the lamp,
straining my ears and hailing distant footfalls. In a house near me some
people were dancing to the music of a Hungarian band. I even fancied I
could hear the windows shake to the rhythm of their feet, but I could
not make out from which part of the compass the sounds came. And
sometimes, as the music rose, it seemed close at my hand, and again, to
be floating high in the air above my head. Although I was surrounded by
thousands of householders--13--I was as completely lost as though I
had been set down by night in the Sahara Desert. There seemed to be no
reason in waiting longer for an escort, so I again set out, and at once
bumped against a low iron fence. At first I believed this to be an
area railing, but on following it I found that it stretched for a long
distance, and that it was pierced at regular intervals with gates. I was
standing uncertainly with my hand on one of these when a square of light
suddenly opened in the night, and in it I saw, as you see a picture
thrown by a biograph in a darkened theatre, a young gentleman in
evening dress, and back of him the lights of a hall. I guessed from its
elevation and distance from the side-walk that this light must come
from the door of a house set back from the street, and I determined
to approach it and ask the young man to tell me where I was. But in
fumbling with the lock of the gate I instinctively bent my head, and
when I raised it again the door had partly closed, leaving only a narrow
shaft of light. Whether the young man had re-entered the house, or had
left it I could not tell, but I hastened to open the gate, and as I
stepped forward I found myself upon an asphalt walk. At the same instant
there was the sound of quick steps upon the path, and some one rushed
past me. I called to him, but he made no reply, and I heard the gate
click and the footsteps hurrying away upon the sidewalk.
</p><p>[Illustration: 06 A square of light suddenly opened in the night]
</p><p>“Under other circumstances the young man’s rudeness, and his
recklessness in dashing so hurriedly through the mist, would have struck
me as peculiar, but everything was so distorted by the fog that at the
moment I did not consider it. The door was still as he had left it,
partly open. I went up the path, and, after much fumbling, found the
knob of the door-bell and gave it a sharp pull. The bell answered me
from a great depth and distance, but no movement followed from inside
the house, and although I pulled the bell again and again I could hear
nothing save the dripping of the mist about me. I was anxious to be on
my way, but unless I knew where I was going there was little chance
of my making any speed, and I was determined that until I learned my
bearings I would not venture back into the fog. So I pushed the door
open and stepped into the house.
</p><p>“I found myself in a long and narrow hall, upon which doors opened from
either side. At the end of the hall was a staircase with a balustrade
which ended in a sweeping curve. The balustrade was covered with heavy
Persian rugs, and the walls of the hall were also hung with them. The
door on my left was closed, but the one nearer me on the right was open,
and as I stepped opposite to it I saw that it was a sort of reception
or waiting-room, and that it was empty. The door below it was also open,
and with the idea that I would surely find some one there, I walked on
up the hall. I was in evening dress, and I felt I did not look like
a burglar, so I had no great fear that, should I encounter one of the
inmates of the house, he would shoot me on sight. The second door in the
hall opened into a dining-room. This was also empty. One person had
been dining at the table, but the cloth had not been cleared away, and
a nickering candle showed half-filled wineglasses and the ashes of
cigarettes. The greater part of the room was in complete darkness.
</p><p>“By this time I had grown conscious of the fact that I was wandering
about in a strange house, and that, apparently, I was alone in it.
The silence of the place began to try my nerves, and in a sudden,
unexplainable panic I started for the open street. But as I turned,
I saw a man sitting on a bench, which the curve of the balustrade had
hidden from me. His eyes were shut, and he was sleeping soundly.
</p><p>“The moment before I had been bewildered because I could see no one, but
at sight of this man I was much more bewildered.
</p><p>“He was a very large man, a giant in height, with long yellow hair which
hung below his shoulders. He was dressed in a red silk shirt that was
belted at the waist and hung outside black velvet trousers which, in
turn, were stuffed into high black boots. I recognized the costume at
once as that of a Russian servant, but what a Russian servant in his
native livery could be doing in a private house in Knightsbridge was
incomprehensible.
</p><p>“I advanced and touched the man on the shoulder, and after an effort he
awoke, and, on seeing me, sprang to his feet and began bowing rapidly
and making deprecatory gestures. I had picked up enough Russian in
Petersburg to make out that the man was apologizing for having fallen
asleep, and I also was able to explain to him that I desired to see his
master.
</p><p>“He nodded vigorously, and said, ‘Will the Excellency come this way? The
Princess is here.’
</p><p>“I distinctly made out the word ‘princess,’ and I was a good deal
embarrassed. I had thought it would be easy enough to explain my
intrusion to a man, but how a woman would look at it was another matter,
and as I followed him down the hall I was somewhat puzzled.
</p><p>“As we advanced, he noticed that the front door was standing open, and
with an exclamation of surprise, hastened toward it and closed it. Then
he rapped twice on the door of what was apparently the drawing-room.
There was no reply to his knock, and he tapped again, and then timidly,
and cringing subserviently, opened the door and stepped inside. He
withdrew himself at once and stared stupidly at me, shaking his head.
</p><p>“‘She is not there,’ he said. He stood for a moment gazing blankly
through the open door, and then hastened toward the dining-room. The
solitary candle which still burned there seemed to assure him that the
room also was empty. He came back and bowed me toward the drawing-room.
‘She is above,’ he said; ‘I will inform the Princess of the Excellency’s
presence.’
</p><p>“Before I could stop him he had turned and was running up the staircase,
leaving me alone at the open door of the drawing-room. I decided that
the adventure had gone quite far enough, and if I had been able to
explain to the Russian that I had lost my way in the fog, and only
wanted to get back into the street again, I would have left the house on
the instant.
</p><p>“Of course, when I first rang the bell of the house I had no other
expectation than that it would be answered by a parlor-maid who would
direct me on my way. I certainly could not then foresee that I would
disturb a Russian princess in her boudoir, or that I might be thrown out
by her athletic bodyguard. Still, I thought I ought not now to leave
the house without making some apology, and, if the worst should come,
I could show my card. They could hardly believe that a member of an
Embassy had any designs upon the hat-rack.
</p><p>“The room in which I stood was dimly lighted, but I could see that, like
the hall, it was hung with heavy Persian rugs. The corners were filled
with palms, and there was the unmistakable odor in the air of Russian
cigarettes, and strange, dry scents that carried me back to the bazaars
of Vladivostock. Near the front windows was a grand piano, and at the
other end of the room a heavily carved screen of some black wood,
picked out with ivory. The screen was overhung with a canopy of silken
draperies, and formed a sort of alcove. In front of the alcove was
spread the white skin of a polar bear, and set on that was one of those
low Turkish coffee tables. It held a lighted spirit-lamp and two gold
coffee cups. I had heard no movement from above stairs, and it must have
been fully three minutes that I stood waiting, noting these details of
the room and wondering at the delay, and at the strange silence.
</p><p>“And then, suddenly, as my eye grew more used to the half-light, I saw,
projecting from behind the screen as though it were stretched along the
back of a divan, the hand of a man and the lower part of his arm. I
was as startled as though I had come across a footprint on a deserted
island. Evidently the man had been sitting there since I had come into
the room, even since I had entered the house, and he had heard the
servant knocking upon the door. Why he had not declared himself I could
not understand, but I supposed that possibly he was a guest, with no
reason to interest himself in the Princess’s other visitors, or perhaps,
for some reason, he did not wish to be observed. I could see nothing of
him except his hand, but I had an unpleasant feeling that he had been
peering at me through the carving in the screen, and that he still was
doing so. I moved my feet noisily on the floor and said tentatively, ‘I
beg your pardon.’
</p><p>“There was no reply, and the hand did not stir. Apparently the man
was bent upon ignoring me, but as all I wished was to apologize for my
intrusion and to leave the house, I walked up to the alcove and peered
around it. Inside the screen was a divan piled with cushions, and on the
end of it nearer me the man was sitting. He was a young Englishman with
light yellow hair and a deeply bronzed face.
</p><p>“He was seated with his arms stretched out along the back of the divan,
and with his head resting against a cushion. His attitude was one of
complete ease. But his mouth had fallen open, and his eyes were set with
an expression of utter horror. At the first glance I saw that he was
quite dead.
</p><p>“For a flash of time I was too startled to act, but in the same flash I
was convinced that the man had met his death from no accident, that he
had not died through any ordinary failure of the laws of nature. The
expression on his face was much too terrible to be misinterpreted. It
spoke as eloquently as words. It told me that before the end had come he
had watched his death approach and threaten him.
</p><p>“I was so sure he had been murdered that I instinctively looked on the
floor for the weapon, and, at the same moment, out of concern for my
own safety, quickly behind me; but the silence of the house continued
unbroken.
</p><p>“I have seen a great number of dead men; I was on the Asiatic Station
during the Japanese-Chinese war. I was in Port Arthur after the
massacre. So a dead man, for the single reason that he is dead, does not
repel me, and, though I knew that there was no hope that this man was
alive, still for decency’s sake, I felt his pulse, and while I kept my
ears alert for any sound from the floors above me, I pulled open his
shirt and placed my hand upon his heart. My fingers instantly touched
upon the opening of a wound, and as I withdrew them I found them wet
with blood. He was in evening dress, and in the wide bosom of his
shirt I found a narrow slit, so narrow that in the dim light it was
scarcely discernable. The wound was no wider than the smallest blade of
a pocket-knife, but when I stripped the shirt away from the chest and
left it bare, I found that the weapon, narrow as it was, had been long
enough to reach his heart. There is no need to tell you how I felt as I
stood by the body of this boy, for he was hardly older than a boy, or
of the thoughts that came into my head. I was bitterly sorry for this
stranger, bitterly indignant at his murderer, and, at the same time,
selfishly concerned for my own safety and for the notoriety which I saw
was sure to follow. My instinct was to leave the body where it lay, and
to hide myself in the fog, but I also felt that since a succession of
accidents had made me the only witness to a crime, my duty was to make
myself a good witness and to assist to establish the facts of this
murder.
</p><p>“That it might possibly be a suicide, and not a murder, did not disturb
me for a moment. The fact that the weapon had disappeared, and the
expression on the boy’s face were enough to convince, at least me, that
he had had no hand in his own death. I judged it, therefore, of the
first importance to discover who was in the house, or, if they had
escaped from it, who had been in the house before I entered it. I had
seen one man leave it; but all I could tell of him was that he was a
young man, that he was in evening dress, and that he had fled in such
haste that he had not stopped to close the door behind him.
</p><p>“The Russian servant I had found apparently asleep, and, unless he acted
a part with supreme skill, he was a stupid and ignorant boor, and as
innocent of the murder as myself. There was still the Russian princess
whom he had expected to find, or had pretended to expect to find, in the
same room with the murdered man. I judged that she must now be either
upstairs with the servant, or that she had, without his knowledge,
already fled from the house. When I recalled his apparently genuine
surprise at not finding her in the drawing-room, this latter supposition
seemed the more probable. Nevertheless, I decided that it was my duty to
make a search, and after a second hurried look for the weapon among the
cushions of the divan, and upon the floor, I cautiously crossed the hall
and entered the dining-room.
</p><p>“The single candle was still flickering in the draught, and showed only
the white cloth. The rest of the room was draped in shadows. I picked up
the candle, and, lifting it high above my head, moved around the corner
of the table. Either my nerves were on such a stretch that no shock
could strain them further, or my mind was inoculated to horrors, for
I did not cry out at what I saw nor retreat from it. Immediately at my
feet was the body of a beautiful woman, lying at full length upon the
floor, her arms flung out on either side of her, and her white face and
shoulders gleaming dully in the unsteady light of the candle. Around her
throat was a great chain of diamonds, and the light played upon these
and made them flash and blaze in tiny flames. But the woman who wore
them was dead, and I was so certain as to how she had died that without
an instant’s hesitation I dropped on my knees beside her and placed
my hands above her heart. My fingers again touched the thin slit of a
wound. I had no doubt in my mind but that this was the Russian princess,
and when I lowered the candle to her face I was assured that this
was so. Her features showed the finest lines of both the Slav and the
Jewess; the eyes were black, the hair blue-black and wonderfully heavy,
and her skin, even in death, was rich in color. She was a surpassingly
beautiful woman.
</p><p>[Illustration: 07 At my feet was the body of a beautiful woman]
</p><p>“I rose and tried to light another candle with the one I held, but
I found that my hand was so unsteady that I could not keep the wicks
together. It was my intention to again search for this strange dagger
which had been used to kill both the English boy and the beautiful
princess, but before I could light the second candle I heard footsteps
descending the stairs, and the Russian servant appeared in the doorway.
</p><p>“My face was in darkness, or I am sure that at the sight of it he would
have taken alarm, for at that moment I was not sure but that this man
himself was the murderer. His own face was plainly visible to me in the
light from the hall, and I could see that it wore an expression of dull
bewilderment. I stepped quickly toward him and took a firm hold upon his
wrist.
</p><p>“‘She is not there,’ he said. ‘The Princess has gone. They have all
gone.’
</p><p>“‘Who have gone?’ I demanded. ‘Who else has been here?’
</p><p>“‘The two Englishmen,’ he said.
</p><p>“‘What two Englishmen?’ I demanded. ‘What are their names?’
</p><p>“The man now saw by my manner that some question of great moment hung
upon his answer, and he began to protest that he did not know the names
of the visitors and that until that evening he had never seen them.
</p><p>“I guessed that it was my tone which frightened him, so I took my hand
off his wrist and spoke less eagerly.
</p><p>“‘How long have they been here?’ I asked, ‘and when did they go?’
</p><p>“He pointed behind him toward the drawing-room.
</p><p>“‘One sat there with the Princess,’ he said; ‘the other came after I
had placed the coffee in the drawing-room. The two Englishmen talked
together and the Princess returned here to the table. She sat there in
that chair, and I brought her cognac and cigarettes. Then I sat outside
upon the bench. It was a feast day, and I had been drinking. Pardon,
Excellency, but I fell asleep. When I woke, your Excellency was standing
by me, but the Princess and the two Englishmen had gone. That is all I
know.’
</p><p>“I believed that the man was telling me the truth. His fright had
passed, and he was now apparently puzzled, but not alarmed.
</p><p>“‘You must remember the names of the Englishmen,’ I urged. ‘Try to
think. When you announced them to the Princess what name did you give?’
</p><p>“At this question he exclaimed with pleasure, and, beckoning to me,
ran hurriedly down the hall and into the drawing-room. In the corner
furthest from the screen was the piano, and on it was a silver tray. He
picked this up and, smiling with pride at his own intelligence, pointed
at two cards that lay upon it. I took them up and read the names
engraved upon them.”
</p><p>The American paused abruptly, and glanced at the faces about him. “I
read the names,” he repeated. He spoke with great reluctance.
</p><p>“Continue!” cried the Baronet, sharply.
</p><p>“I read the names,” said the American with evident distaste, “and the
family name of each was the same. They were the names of two brothers.
One is well known to you. It is that of the African explorer of whom
this gentleman was just speaking. I mean the Earl of Chetney. The other
was the name of his brother, Lord Arthur Chetney.”
</p><p>The men at the table fell back as though a trapdoor had fallen open at
their feet.
</p><p>“Lord Chetney!” they exclaimed in chorus. They glanced at each other and
back to the American with every expression of concern and disbelief.
</p><p>“It is impossible!” cried the Baronet. “Why, my dear sir, young Chetney
only arrived from Africa yesterday. It was so stated in the evening
papers.”
</p><p>The jaw of the American set in a resolute square, and he pressed his
lips together.
</p><p>“You are perfectly right, sir,” he said, “Lord Chetney did arrive in
London yesterday morning, and yesterday night I found his dead body.”
</p><p>The youngest member present was the first to recover. He seemed much
less concerned over the identity of the murdered man than at the
interruption of the narrative.
</p><p>“Oh, please let him go on!” he cried. “What happened then? You say you
found two visiting cards. How do you know which card was that of the
murdered man?”
</p><p>The American, before he answered, waited until the chorus of
exclamations had ceased. Then he continued as though he had not been
interrupted.
</p><p>“The instant I read the names upon the cards,” he said, “I ran to the
screen and, kneeling beside the dead man, began a search through his
pockets. My hand at once fell upon a card-case, and I found on all
the cards it contained the title of the Earl of Chetney. His watch and
cigarette-case also bore his name. These evidences, and the fact of his
bronzed skin, and that his cheekbones were worn with fever, convinced
me that the dead man was the African explorer, and the boy who had fled
past me in the night was Arthur, his younger brother.
</p><p>“I was so intent upon my search that I had forgotten the servant, and
I was still on my knees when I heard a cry behind me. I turned, and saw
the man gazing down at the body in abject horror.
</p><p>“Before I could rise, he gave another cry of terror, and, flinging
himself into the hall, raced toward the door to the street. I leaped
after him, shouting to him to halt, but before I could reach the hall he
had torn open the door, and I saw him spring out into the yellow fog. I
cleared the steps in a jump and ran down the garden walk but just as
the gate clicked in front of me. I had it open on the instant, and,
following the sound of the man’s footsteps, I raced after him across the
open street. He, also, could hear me, and he instantly stopped running,
and there was absolute silence. He was so near that I almost fancied I
could hear him panting, and I held my own breath to listen. But I could
distinguish nothing but the dripping of the mist about us, and from far
off the music of the Hungarian band, which I had heard when I first lost
myself.
</p><p>“All I could see was the square of light from the door I had left open
behind me, and a lamp in the hall beyond it flickering in the draught.
But even as I watched it, the flame of the lamp was blown violently to
and fro, and the door, caught in the same current of air, closed slowly.
I knew if it shut I could not again enter the house, and I rushed madly
toward it. I believe I even shouted out, as though it were something
human which I could compel to obey me, and then I caught my foot against
the curb and smashed into the sidewalk. When I rose to my feet I was
dizzy and half stunned, and though I thought then that I was moving
toward the door, I know now that I probably turned directly from it;
for, as I groped about in the night, calling frantically for the police,
my fingers touched nothing but the dripping fog, and the iron railings
for which I sought seemed to have melted away. For many minutes I beat
the mist with my arms like one at blind man’s buff, turning sharply in
circles, cursing aloud at my stupidity and crying continually for help.
At last a voice answered me from the fog, and I found myself held in the
circle of a policeman’s lantern.
</p><p>“That is the end of my adventure. What I have to tell you now is what I
learned from the police.
</p><p>“At the station-house to which the man guided me I related what you have
just heard. I told them that the house they must at once find was one
set back from the street within a radius of two hundred yards from
the Knightsbridge Barracks, that within fifty yards of it some one was
giving a dance to the music of a Hungarian band, and that the railings
before it were as high as a man’s waist and filed to a point. With that
to work upon, twenty men were at once ordered out into the fog to search
for the house, and Inspector Lyle himself was despatched to the home of
Lord Edam, Chetney’s father, with a warrant for Lord Arthur’s arrest. I
was thanked and dismissed on my own recognizance.
</p><p>“This morning, Inspector Lyle called on me, and from him I learned the
police theory of the scene I have just described.
</p><p>“Apparently I had wandered very far in the fog, for up to noon to-day
the house had not been found, nor had they been able to arrest Lord
Arthur. He did not return to his father’s house last night, and there is
no trace of him; but from what the police knew of the past lives of the
people I found in that lost house, they have evolved a theory, and their
theory is that the murders were committed by Lord Arthur.
</p><p>“The infatuation of his elder brother, Lord Chetney, for a Russian
princess, so Inspector Lyle tells me, is well known to every one. About
two years ago the Princess Zichy, as she calls herself, and he were
constantly together, and Chetney informed his friends that they were
about to be married. The woman was notorious in two continents, and when
Lord Edam heard of his son’s infatuation he appealed to the police for
her record.
</p><p>“It is through his having applied to them that they know so much
concerning her and her relations with the Chetneys. From the police Lord
Edam learned that Madame Zichy had once been a spy in the employ of the
Russian Third Section, but that lately she had been repudiated by her
own government and was living by her wits, by blackmail, and by her
beauty. Lord Edam laid this record before his son, but Chetney either
knew it already or the woman persuaded him not to believe in it, and the
father and son parted in great anger. Two days later the marquis altered
his will, leaving all of his money to the younger brother, Arthur.
</p><p>“The title and some of the landed property he could not keep from
Chetney, but he swore if his son saw the woman again that the will
should stand as it was, and he would be left without a penny.
</p><p>“This was about eighteen months ago, when apparently Chetney tired of
the Princess, and suddenly went off to shoot and explore in Central
Africa. No word came from him, except that twice he was reported as
having died of fever in the jungle, and finally two traders reached
the coast who said they had seen his body. This was accepted by all
as conclusive, and young Arthur was recognized as the heir to the Edam
millions. On the strength of this supposition he at once began to borrow
enormous sums from the money lenders. This is of great importance, as
the police believe it was these debts which drove him to the murder of
his brother. Yesterday, as you know, Lord Chetney suddenly returned from
the grave, and it was the fact that for two years he had been considered
as dead which lent such importance to his return and which gave rise
to those columns of detail concerning him which appeared in all the
afternoon papers. But, obviously, during his absence he had not tired of
the Princess Zichy, for we know that a few hours after he reached London
he sought her out. His brother, who had also learned of his reappearance
through the papers, probably suspected which would be the house he would
first visit, and followed him there, arriving, so the Russian servant
tells us, while the two were at coffee in the drawing-room. The
Princess, then, we also learn from the servant, withdrew to the
dining-room, leaving the brothers together. What happened one can only
guess.
</p><p>“Lord Arthur knew now that when it was discovered he was no longer the
heir, the money-lenders would come down upon him. The police believe
that he at once sought out his brother to beg for money to cover the
post-obits, but that, considering the sum he needed was several hundreds
of thousands of pounds, Chetney refused to give it him. No one knew
that Arthur had gone to seek out his brother. They were alone. It is
possible, then, that in a passion of disappointment, and crazed with
the disgrace which he saw before him, young Arthur made himself the heir
beyond further question. The death of his brother would have availed
nothing if the woman remained alive. It is then possible that he crossed
the hall, and with the same weapon which made him Lord Edam’s heir
destroyed the solitary witness to the murder. The only other person
who could have seen it was sleeping in a drunken stupor, to which fact
undoubtedly he owed his life. And yet,” concluded the Naval Attache,
leaning forward and marking each word with his finger, “Lord Arthur
blundered fatally. In his haste he left the door of the house open, so
giving access to the first passer-by, and he forgot that when he entered
it he had handed his card to the servant. That piece of paper may yet
send him to the gallows. In the mean time he has disappeared completely,
and somewhere, in one of the millions of streets of this great capital,
in a locked and empty house, lies the body of his brother, and of the
woman his brother loved, undiscovered, unburied, and with their murder
unavenged.”
</p><p>In the discussion which followed the conclusion of the story of the
Naval Attache the gentleman with the pearl took no part. Instead, he
arose, and, beckoning a servant to a far corner of the room, whispered
earnestly to him until a sudden movement on the part of Sir Andrew
caused him to return hurriedly to the table.
</p><p>“There are several points in Mr. Sears’s story I want explained,” he
cried. “Be seated, Sir Andrew,” he begged. “Let us have the opinion of
an expert. I do not care what the police think, I want to know what you
think.”
</p><p>But Sir Henry rose reluctantly from his chair.
</p><p>“I should like nothing better than to discuss this,” he said. “But it
is most important that I proceed to the House. I should have been there
some time ago.” He turned toward the servant and directed him to call a
hansom.
</p><p>The gentleman with the pearl stud looked appealingly at the Naval
Attache. “There are surely many details that you have not told us,” he
urged. “Some you have forgotten.”
</p><p>The Baronet interrupted quickly.
</p><p>“I trust not,” he said, “for I could not possibly stop to hear them.”
</p><p>“The story is finished,” declared the Naval Attache; “until Lord Arthur
is arrested or the bodies are found there is nothing more to tell of
either Chetney or the Princess Zichy.”
</p><p>“Of Lord Chetney perhaps not,” interrupted the sporting-looking
gentleman with the black tie, “but there’ll always be something to tell
of the Princess Zichy. I know enough stories about her to fill a book.
She was a most remarkable woman.” The speaker dropped the end of his
cigar into his coffee cup and, taking his case from his pocket, selected
a fresh one. As he did so he laughed and held up the case that the
others might see it. It was an ordinary cigar-case of well-worn
pig-skin, with a silver clasp.
</p><p>“The only time I ever met her,” he said, “she tried to rob me of this.”
</p><p>The Baronet regarded him closely.
</p><p>“She tried to rob you?” he repeated.
</p><p>[Illustration: 08 The Princess Zichy]
</p><p>“Tried to rob me of this,” continued the gentleman in the black tie,
“and of the Czarina’s diamonds.” His tone was one of mingled admiration
and injury.
</p><p>“The Czarina’s diamonds!” exclaimed the Baronet. He glanced quickly and
suspiciously at the speaker, and then at the others about the table.
But their faces gave evidence of no other emotion than that of ordinary
interest.
</p><p>“Yes, the Czarina’s diamonds,” repeated the man with the black tie.
“It was a necklace of diamonds. I was told to take them to the Russian
Ambassador in Paris who was to deliver them at Moscow. I am a Queen’s
Messenger,” he added.
</p><p>“Oh, I see,” exclaimed Sir Andrew in a tone of relief. “And you say
that this same Princess Zichy, one of the victims of this double murder,
endeavored to rob you of--of--that cigar-case.”
</p><p>“And the Czarina’s diamonds,” answered the Queen’s Messenger
imperturbably. “It’s not much of a story, but it gives you an idea
of the woman’s character. The robbery took place between Paris and
Marseilles.”
</p><p>The Baronet interrupted him with an abrupt movement. “No, no,” he cried,
shaking his head in protest. “Do not tempt me. I really cannot listen. I
must be at the House in ten minutes.”
</p><p>“I am sorry,” said the Queen’s Messenger. He turned to those seated
about him. “I wonder if the other gentlemen--” he inquired tentatively.
There was a chorus of polite murmurs, and the Queen’s Messenger, bowing
his head in acknowledgment, took a preparatory sip from his glass. At
the same moment the servant to whom the man with the black pearl had
spoken, slipped a piece of paper into his hand. He glanced at it,
frowned, and threw it under the table.
</p><p>The servant bowed to the Baronet.
</p><p>“Your hansom is waiting, Sir Andrew,” he said.
</p><p>“The necklace was worth twenty thousand pounds,” began the Queen’s
Messenger. “It was a present from the Queen of England to celebrate--”
 The Baronet gave an exclamation of angry annoyance.
</p><p>“Upon my word, this is most provoking,” he interrupted. “I really ought
not to stay. But I certainly mean to hear this.” He turned irritably to
the servant. “Tell the hansom to wait,” he commanded, and, with an air
of a boy who is playing truant, slipped guiltily into his chair.
</p><p>The gentleman with the black pearl smiled blandly, and rapped upon the
table.
</p><p>“Order, gentlemen,” he said. “Order for the story of the Queen’s
Messenger and the Czarina’s diamonds.”
