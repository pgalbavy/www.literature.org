<p>It was a memorable interview which the explorers held with Haffgo,
king of the mighty Murhapas.</p>

<p>Since Bippo and Pedros were servants, they were not admitted
to an audience with the potentate.  Ziffak conducted the others
into the hut adjoining the palace.  This was his own building,
where his aged mother had charge.  She understood matters from
her son, and the frightened fellows were made to feel that they
were safe for a time from the annoyances and persecutions of the
multitude.</p>

<p>The apartment was an oblong one, being at the front, and was
characteristically furnished.  Instead of the smooth bare ground
which formed the floors of the other buildings, the palace was
entirely covered with the skins of wild animals, gaudily stained. 
The whole looked like a gorgeous, oriental carpet, which was as
soft as down to the tread.</p>

<p>There were no chairs or benches for auditors, for no one presumed
to sit in the presence of majesty.  The walls were hung with the
same species of ornamented furs, set off here and there by spears,
bows and arrows, arranged in fantastic fashion.</p>

<p>At the further end of the apartment, was a platform several feet
high, with a broad seat, covered with still more brilliant peltries,
a footstool, and on each side a vase of magnificent flowers. 
These vases were of native manufacture, beautifully ornamented,
while the flowers were of a radiant loveliness, such as are seen
nowhere outside of tropical countries.  Their delicious fragrance
filled the apartment and affected the strangers the moment the
blanket was pulled aside by Ziffak and they stepped within the
royal reception room.</p>

<p>On each side was a broad open window, without glass, which admitted
enough sunlight to flood the place with illumination.</p>

<p>At the right of the dais or throne, the curtains were draped
so as to serve as a door for the king or any member of the royal
household to enter or withdraw.</p>

<p>On this barbaric throne sat the extraordinary personage known
as King Haffgo, ruler of the warlike Murhapas.</p>

<p>To say the least, his appearance was stunning, if not bewildering.</p>

<p>In the first place, it maybe doubted whether the intrinsic value
of his crown was not the equal of any that can be found to-day
in the monarchical countries of Europe, Asia or Africa.  Its foundation
seemed to be a network of golden wire, in which were set scores
upon scores of diamonds, weighing from five to ten carats apiece,
with a central sun the equal of the great Pitt diamond.  The coruscations
from these brilliants were overwhelming.  As the king moved his
head while speaking, every hue of the rainbow flashed and scintillated,
the rays at times seeming to dart entirely across the room.</p>

<p>In addition, the neck of Haffgo was encircled by a double string
of the same dazzling jewels, of hardly less magnitude; while the
wrist of the right hand, which rested on a large javelin, was
clasped by a golden bracelet of what appeared to be living fire.</p>

<p>The king was dressed in a species of thin cloth, gathered by
a girdle at the waist.  The crimson tint of this garment was relieved
by figures of the sun, moon and stars, of dragons, birds, beasts
and reptiles in gold.  One of his feet was visible, disclosing
a species of sandal such as is seen among the natives of the East
Indies.</p>

<p>Had King Haffgo been encountered anywhere else, he would have
been set down as a European with an unusually fair complexion. 
It bore no liking to that of the African or native Murhapa.  His
skin had none of that chalky, transparent appearance shown by
the Albinos, but was almost pinkish and ruddy.</p>

<p>His bushy hair was not white, but of a decided brown, his eyes
hazel, his nose Roman, with a strong chin and a keen expression,
such as was natural to a man who had reigned an absolute autocrat
all his life.</p>

<p>He was about fifty years of age, but his face was wrinkled like
a man of threescore and more.</p>

<p>King Haffgo was seated on his throne when his visitors were ushered
into his presence, as though he expected and was waiting for them.</p>

<p>The white men were unacquainted with the etiquette prevailing
in this barbaric court, but there are certain ceremonies which
are received as expressive of courtesy and obeisance the world
over.</p>

<p>Ziffak gave no instructions; but, placing himself at the side
of Professor Grimcke on the left, he surveyed his friends with
much curiosity, as if waiting to see how they would conduct themselves.</p>

<p>Grimcke, Long and Ashman removed their hats and bowed slowly,
bending their heads almost to their knees.  Then, as they straightened
up again, the Professor, who took upon himself the duty of spokesman,
said:</p>

<p>"We greet the great King Haffgo, and beg that he will accept
the homage of his brothers from their homes near the great water."</p>

<p>"Why do my brothers come from their homes to hunt out the king
of the Murhapas, when he has not asked them to come?"</p>

<p>These words were uttered almost exactly as given.  The accent
was thick and somewhat broken, but they showed an astonishing
command of the English tongue, and proved that Waggaman and Burkhardt
had found some exceedingly apt pupils among this people.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to give the interview in detail.  There was
a certain stateliness about the manner of the king which was remarkably
becoming.  His guests had prepared themselves, when starting out
on their exploring enterprise, to make friends, by providing a
large supply of gaudy trinkets, such as is always pleasing to
the average savage; but, when they saw the wonderful crown and
diamond ornaments of this autocrat, they were ashamed to let the
baubles in their possession be seen.</p>

<p>They consisted mainly of children's toys; and, since they were
entirely different from anything in the country, Professor Grimcke
finally made bold to offer them, with another low obeisance, to
his majesty.  The latter may have been delighted, but, if so,
he did not allow it to appear in his face or manner.</p>

<p>Fred Ashman handed him two brightly-polished knives, fashioned
somewhat after the familiar Bowie pattern, and, despite his reserve,
it was easy to see that they pleased him more than anything else.</p>

<p>Jared Long's present was a handsomely-carved meerschaum pipe. 
The king was an inveterate smoker, and, even if he didn't do anything
more than nod his head when it was placed in his hand, he ought
to have been very grateful.</p>

<p>Despite the pains which our friends took to win the good will
of King Haffgo, it was apparent to all three that their visit
was not welcome. Waggaman and Burkhardt may not have whispered
anything in his ear about them, but the ruler was thoroughly filled
with a distrust of all white men, the only exceptions being the
ones that were the cause of this distrust.</p>

<p>Being a man of unquestioned native sagacity, it needed nothing
more from his first guests than their accounts of what the other
race was doing in the cities and towns along the sea coasts. 
Any people who builded canoes large enough to cross the awful
waste of waters in quest of diamonds and gold, were sure to seize
the chance to force their way up the Xingu where much more boundless
wealth awaited them.</p>

<p>The famous diamond mines of Brazil were not very far from this
portion of the Matto Grosso, and the pains which the emperors
of Brazil had taken to draw a part of their riches from the earth
was all the proof Haffgo could ask of the rapacity of the nations
which called themselves civilized.</p>

<p>Now, while this remarkable ruler could not always make certain
that no white men should enter his dominions, there remained a
very good chance of preventing such intruders from getting away
again, carrying the glowing accounts of what they had discovered. 
So long as he could maintain this condition of affairs, so long
was he safe; for if he "absorbed" every foreigner ascending the
Xingu, the supply could never exceed the demand.</p>

<p>The King conversed with not only the Professor, but with Long
and Ashman in turn.  They were as deferential as they knew how
to be, but all the same, their sagacity told them he bore them
no good will, and would have been much better pleased had the
Aryks wiped them out before they ascended the rapids.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the interview, which lasted about half an
hour, the King Haffgo informed them they were at liberty to remain
two days in the village, during which they were not to pass outside
its boundaries.  At the expiration of the period named, they would
be allowed to descend the Xingu to their homes, under their pledge
to tell no person what they had seen and learned about the Murhapas.</p>
