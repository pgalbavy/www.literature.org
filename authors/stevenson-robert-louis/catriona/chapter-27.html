<p>I believe it was about the fifth day, and I know at least that
James was in one of his fits of gloom, when I received three letters.
The first was from Alan, offering to visit me in Leyden; the other
two were out of Scotland and prompted by the same affair, which
was the death of my uncle and my own complete accession to my
rights. Rankeillor’s was, of course, wholly in the business view;
Miss Grant’s was like herself, a little more witty than wise,
full of blame to me for not having written (though how was I to
write with such intelligence?) and of rallying talk about Catriona,
which it cut me to the quick to read in her very presence.</p>

<p>For it was of course in my own rooms that I found them, when
I came to dinner, so that I was surprised out of my news in the
very first moment of reading it. This made a welcome diversion
for all three of us, nor could any have foreseen the ill consequences
that ensued. It was accident that brought the three letters the
same day, and that gave them into my hand in the same room with
James More; and of all the events that flowed from that accident,
and which I might have prevented if I had held my tongue, the
truth is that they were preordained before Agricola came into
Scotland or Abraham set out upon his travels.</p>

<p>The first that I opened was naturally Alan’s; and what more natural
than that I should comment on his design to visit me? but I observed
James to sit up with an air of immediate attention.</p>

<p>"Is that not Alan Breck that was suspected of the Appin accident?"
he inquired.</p>

<p>I told him, "Ay," it was the same; and he withheld me some time
from my other letters, asking of our acquaintance, of Alan’s manner
of life in France, of which I knew very little, and further of
his visit as now proposed.</p>

<p>"All we forfeited folk hang a little together," he explained,
"and besides I know the gentleman: and though his descent is not
the thing, and indeed he has no true right to use the name of
Stewart, he was very much admired in the day of Drummossie. He
did there like a soldier; if some that need not be named had done
as well, the upshot need not have been so melancholy to remember.
There were two that did their best that day, and it makes a bond
between the pair of us," says he.</p>

<p>I could scarce refrain from shooting out my tongue at him, and
could almost have wished that Alan had been there to have inquired
a little further into that mention of his birth. Though, they
tell me, the same was indeed not wholly regular.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I had opened Miss Grant’s, and could not withhold
an exclamation.</p>

<p>"Catriona," I cried, forgetting, the first time since her father
was arrived, to address her by a handle, "I am come into my kingdom
fairly, I am the laird of Shaws indeed—my uncle is dead at last."</p>

<p>She clapped her hands together leaping from her seat. The next
moment it must have come over both of us at once what little cause
of joy was left to either, and we stood opposite, staring on each
other sadly.</p>

<p>But James showed himself a ready hypocrite. "My daughter," says
he, "is this how my cousin learned you to behave? Mr. David has
lost a new friend, and we should first condole with him on his
bereavement."</p>

<p>"Troth, sir," said I, turning to him in a kind of anger, "I can
make no such great faces. His death is as blithe news as ever
I got."</p>

<p>"It’s a good soldier’s philosophy," says James. "’Tis the way
of flesh, we must all go, all go. And if the gentleman was so
far from your favour, why, very well! But we may at least congratulate
you on your accession to your estates."</p>

<p>"Nor can I say that either," I replied, with the same heat. "It
is a good estate; what matters that to a lone man that has enough
already? I had a good revenue before in my frugality; and but
for the man’s death—which gratifies me, shame to me that must
confess it!—I see not how anyone is to be bettered by this change."</p>

<p>"Come, come," said he, "you are more affected than you let on,
or you would never make yourself out so lonely. Here are three
letters; that means three that wish you well; and I could name
two more, here in this very chamber. I have known you not so very
long, but Catriona, when we are alone, is never done with the
singing of your praises."</p>

<p>She looked up at him, a little wild at that; and he slid off
at once into another matter, the extent of my estate, which (during
the most of the dinner time) he continued to dwell upon with interest.
But it was to no purpose he dissembled; he had touched the matter
with too gross a hand: and I knew what to expect. Dinner was scarce
ate when he plainly discovered his designs. He reminded Catriona
of an errand, and bid her attend to it. "I do not see you should
be one beyond the hour," he added, "and friend David will be good
enough to bear me company till you return." She made haste to
obey him without words. I do not know if she understood, I believe
not; but I was completely satisfied, and sat strengthening my
mind for what should follow.</p>

<p>The door had scarce closed behind her departure, when the man
leaned back in his chair and addressed me with a good affectation
of easiness. Only the one thing betrayed him, and that was his
face; which suddenly shone all over with fine points of sweat.</p>

<p>"I am rather glad to have a word alone with you," says he, "because
in our first interview there were some expressions you misapprehended
and I have long meant to set you right upon. My daughter stands
beyond doubt. So do you, and I would make that good with my sword
against all gainsayers. But, my dear David, this world is a censorious
place—as who should know it better than myself, who have lived
ever since the days of my late departed father, God sain him!
in a perfect spate of calumnies? We have to face to that; you
and me have to consider of that; we have to consider of that."
And he wagged his head like a minister in a pulpit.</p>

<p>"To what effect, Mr. Drummond?" said I. "I would be obliged to
you if you would approach your point."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," said he, laughing, "like your character, indeed! and
what I most admire in it. But the point, my worthy fellow, is
sometimes in a kittle bit." He filled a glass of wine. "Though
between you and me, that are such fast friends, it need not bother
us long. The point, I need scarcely tell you, is my daughter.
And the first thing is that I have no thought in my mind of blaming
you. In the unfortunate circumstances, what could you do else?
’Deed, and I cannot tell."</p>

<p>"I thank you for that," said I, pretty close upon my guard.</p>

<p>"I have besides studied your character," he went on; "your talents
are fair; you seem to have a moderate competence, which does no
harm; and one thing with another, I am very happy to have to announce
to you that I have decided on the latter of the two ways open."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I am dull," said I. "What ways are these?"</p>

<p>He bent his brows upon me formidably and uncrossed his legs.
"Why, sir," says he, "I think I need scarce describe them to a
gentleman of your condition; either that I should cut your throat
or that you should marry my daughter."</p>

<p>"You are pleased to be quite plain at last," said I.</p>

<p>"And I believe I have been plain from the beginning!" cries he
robustiously. "I am a careful parent, Mr. Balfour; but I thank
God, a patient and deleeborate man. There is many a father, sir,
that would have hirsled you at once either to the altar or the
field. My esteem for your character—"</p>

<p>"Mr. Drummond," I interrupted, "if you have any esteem for me
at all, I will beg of you to moderate your voice. It is quite
needless to rowt at a gentleman in the same chamber with yourself
and lending you his best attention."</p>

<p>"Why, very true," says he, with an immediate change. "And you
must excuse the agitations of a parent."</p>

<p>"I understand you then," I continued—"for I will take no note
of your other alternative, which perhaps it was a pity you let
fall—I understand you rather to offer me encouragement in case
I should desire to apply for your daughter’s hand?"</p>

<p>"It is not possible to express my meaning better," said he, "and
I see we shall do well together."</p>

<p>"That remains to be yet seen," said I. "But so much I need make
no secret of, that I bear the lady you refer to the most tender
affection, and I could not fancy, even in a dream, a better fortune
than to get her."</p>

<p>"I was sure of it, I felt certain of you, David," he cried, and
reached out his hand to me.</p>

<p>I put it by. "You go too fast, Mr. Drummond," said I. "There
are conditions to be made; and there is a difficulty in the path,
which I see not entirely how we shall come over. I have told you
that, upon my side, there is no objection to the marriage, but
I have good reason to believe there will be much on the young
lady’s."</p>

<p>"This is all beside the mark," says he. "I will engage for her
acceptance."</p>

<p>"I think you forget, Mr. Drummond," said I, "that, even in dealing
with myself, you have been betrayed into two-three unpalatable
expressions. I will have none such employed to the young lady.
I am here to speak and think for the two of us; and I give you
to understand that I would no more let a wife be forced upon myself,
than what I would let a husband be forced on the young lady."</p>

<p>He sat and glowered at me like one in doubt and a good deal of
temper.</p>

<p>"So that is to be the way of it," I concluded. "I will marry
Miss Drummond, and that blithely, if she is entirely willing.
But if there be the least unwillingness, as I have reason to fear—marry
her will I never."</p>

<p>"Well well," said he, "this is a small affair. As soon as she
returns I will sound her a bit, and hope to reassure you—"</p>

<p>But I cut in again. "Not a finger of you, Mr. Drummond, or I
cry off, and you can seek a husband to your daughter somewhere
else," said I. "It is I that am to be the only dealer and the
only judge. I shall satisfy myself exactly; and none else shall
anyways meddle—you the least of all."</p>

<p>"Upon my word, sir!" he exclaimed, "and who are you to be the
judge?"</p>

<p>"The bridegroom, I believe," said I.</p>

<p>"This is to quibble," he cried. "You turn your back upon the
fact. The girl, my daughter, has no choice left to exercise. Her
character is gone."</p>

<p>"And I ask your pardon," said I, "but while this matter lies
between her and you and me, that is not so."</p>

<p>"What security have I!" he cried. "Am I to let my daughter’s
reputation depend upon a chance?"</p>

<p>"You should have thought of all this long ago," said I, "before
you were so misguided as to lose her; and not afterwards when
it is quite too late. I refuse to regard myself as any way accountable
for your neglect, and I will be browbeat by no man living. My
mind is quite made up, and come what may, I will not depart from
it a hair’s breadth. You and me are to sit here in company till
her return: upon which, without either word or look from you,
she and I are to go forth again to hold our talk. If she can satisfy
me that she is willing to this step, I will then make it; and
if she cannot, I will not."</p>

<p>He leaped out of his chair like a man stung. "I can spy your
manœuvre," he cried; "you would work upon her to refuse!"</p>

<p>"Maybe ay, and maybe no," said I. "That is the way it is to be,
whatever."</p>

<p>"And if I refuse?" cries he.</p>

<p>"Then, Mr. Drummond, it will have to come to the throat-cutting,"
said I.</p>

<p>What with the size of the man, his great length of arm in which
he came near rivalling his father, and his reputed skill at weapons,
I did not use this word without trepidation, to say nothing at
all of the circumstance that he was Catriona’s father. But I might
have spared myself alarms. From the poorness of my lodging—he
does not seem to have remarked his daughter’s dresses, which were
indeed all equally new to him—and from the fact that I had shown
myself averse to lend, he had embraced a strong idea of my poverty.
The sudden news of my estate convinced him of his error, and he
had made but the one bound of it on this fresh venture, to which
he was now so wedded, that I believe he would have suffered anything
rather than fall to the alternative of fighting.</p>

<p>A little while longer he continued to dispute with me, until
I hit upon a word that silenced him.</p>

<p>"If I find you so averse to let me see the lady by herself,"
said I, "I must suppose you have very good grounds to think me
in the right about her unwillingness."</p>

<p>He gabbled some kind of an excuse.</p>

<p>"But all this is very exhausting to both of our tempers," I added,
"and I think we would do better to preserve a judicious silence."</p>

<p>The which we did until the girl returned, and I must suppose
would have cut a very ridiculous figure had there been any there
to view us.</p>
