<p><em>THE </em>clamber over the roofs of the Rue Ge-rondo on a
cold rainy night had a physical and moral effect on Théophraste.
He had taken cold and was suffering in consequence. From a moral
point of view it had made him change his whole view of these events.
While he had been reading the accounts of these crimes with which
the new Cartouche had been terrifying Paris, he had shown a callous
indifference, but now he commenced to hold himself responsible
for many of the atrocities, and especially for the murder of M.
Houdry, which he had before facetiously blamed on the calf.</p>

<p>He often recalled nocturnal visits by the route he was now following,
and several bloody crimes came back to his memory, disgusting
him, and making him weep bitter tears of useless remorse.</p>

<p>It was, however, too late. In spite of all his sufferings, in
spite of M. de la Nox’s invocations, and the torture they had
submitted him to, Cartouche was not dead.</p>

<p>And that evening, then, like many other criminal evenings, he
led his damned soul over the roofs of Paris. He wept. He cursed
that mysterious, irresistible force, which from the depths of
centuries commanded him to kill. He cursed the influence which
made him kill. He thought of his wife—of Adolphe. He bitterly
regretted the hours of passed happiness between those two beings
so dear to him. He excused them for running away. He pardoned
them for their terror. He resolved never again to trouble their
peaceful days with his bloody incoherencies. "Let me disappear,"
he said to himself. "Let me hide my shame and my original defect
in the midst of the desert. They will forget me. I shall forget
myself. Let me profit by these logical moments, when my brain,
released momentarily from the Other, discusses, weighs, deduces,
and concludes and sees in the present."</p>

<p>It was not Cartouche who spoke, it was Théophraste, who cried
to Cartouche: "Let us fly! Since I love Marceline, let us fly!
Since I love Adolphe, let us fly! One day they will be happy without
me! There is no longer happiness with me! Adieu! adieu! Marceline,
adored woman, faithful wife! Farewell, Adolphe, precious, consoling
friend! Farewell! Théophraste tells you farewell!" He wept. Then
he said aloud: "I come, Cartouche!"</p>

<p>Then he plunged into the darkness, going from gutter to gutter,
from roof to roof, sliding from high walls with safety, protected,
like a somnambulist, by Providence.</p>

<p>And now who is that man who, with his head lowered, his back
curved, his hands in his pockets, swayed like a poor wretch in
the wind and rain which fell profusely all the tedious way? He
followed the road which skirts the railroad. It is a straight
road, bordered by small, weak trees, plain common broom-straw—sad
ornaments for a departmental road—running along the side of the
railroad. Whence comes this man, with his hands in his pockets,
or, rather, this shade of a man? The plain extends to the right
and the left without an undulation, without the rising of a hillock,
without the hollow of a riser. All this can be seen, for this
is not a night scene; it is broad daylight, on the track, straight
on by the side of the road.</p>

<p>Trains pass each other from time to time, local trains, fast
trains, freight trains, rattling along with an occasional ceasing
when one hears in the wind the ting, ting, ting of the bell of
the disks at the station. There is one station before, and one
behind. They are small stations, and are five kilometers apart.
Between the two stations there is a straight double track, but
no viaduct, no tunnel, no bridge, not even a culvert.</p>

<p>As I said before, from whence came the sad shade of a man?</p>

<p>It is Théophraste. He has resolved to fly—no matter where—far
from his wife.</p>

<p>After a night passed from gutter to gutter, not knowing where
to direct his steps, and not caring at all, he goes into a railway
station. He gets into a train without a ticket, gets out of the
train at another station.</p>

<p>How often does it happen that the control registers of railway
stations are badly made on account of the number of travelers.</p>

<p>Behold him, then, on the road at the entrance of a village which
follows the railroad track. And who is it that watches him as
he crosses the threshold of a little house at the entrance of
a village?</p>

<p>Mme. Petito herself!</p>

<p>It was the first time that Mme. Petito had seen M. Longuet since
he cut off the ears of her husband. Upon seeing him, Mme. Petito
became highly indignant, and commenced upbraiding Théophraste.</p>

<p>After all sorts of imprecations—the result of the barbarity of
Théophraste—Mme. Petito informed Théophraste that Signor Petito
had found the treasures of the Chopinettes, that he had put them
in a safe place, and that the treasures were the richest on earth,
treasures which were worth more than two ears. They were as good
as the ears of Signor Petito, and so they were quits.</p>

<p>Théophraste, in the course of this discourse, found it difficult
to say very much, but this did not disturb him. He was glad of
the anger of Mme. Petito, for having furnished him with such valuable
information, and he said: "I have found my treasures, for I have
found Signor Petito again."</p>

<p>Mme. Petito burst into satanic laughter.</p>

<p>"Signor Petito," she exclaimed, "is in the train."</p>

<p>"In which train?"</p>

<p>"In the train which will pass under your very nose! It will carry
my husband beyond the frontier. Get in, then, my dear monsieur;
climb in if you wish to speak to him. But hurry, for he passes
by in an hour, and they do not distribute tickets at the next
station," and her laugh became more satanic still, so much so
that Théophraste almost wished that he was deaf again. He saluted
her and walked away rapidly along the railroad track. When he
was alone he said: "Come, come! I must get some information about
my treasures from Signor Petito himself. But how? He is in the
train which will pass under my nose...</p>
