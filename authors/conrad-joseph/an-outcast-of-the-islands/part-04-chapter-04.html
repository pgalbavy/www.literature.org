<p>When he felt the solid ground of the courtyard under his feet,
Willems pulled himself up in his headlong rush and moved forward
with a moderate gait. He paced stiffly, looking with extreme exactitude
at Lingard’s face; looking neither to the right nor to the left
but at the face only, as if there was nothing in the world but
those features familiar and dreaded; that white-haired, rough
and severe head upon which he gazed in a fixed effort of his eyes,
like a man trying to read small print at the full range of human
vision. As soon as Willems’ feet had left the planks, the silence
which had been lifted up by the jerky rattle of his footsteps
fell down again upon the courtyard; the silence of the cloudy
sky and of the windless air, the sullen silence of the earth oppressed
by the aspect of coming turmoil, the silence of the world collecting
its faculties to withstand the storm. Through this silence Willems
pushed his way, and stopped about six feet from Lingard. He stopped
simply because he could go no further. He had started from the
door with the reckless purpose of clapping the old fellow on the
shoulder. He had no idea that the man would turn out to be so
tall, so big and so unapproachable. It seemed to him that he had
never, never in his life, seen Lingard.</p>

<p>He tried to say&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do not believe . . ."</p>

<p>A fit of coughing checked his sentence in a faint splutter. Directly
afterwards he swallowed&mdash;as it were&mdash;a couple of pebbles, throwing
his chin up in the act; and Lingard, who looked at him narrowly,
saw a bone, sharp and triangular like the head of a snake, dart
up and down twice under the skin of his throat. Then that, too,
did not move. Nothing moved.</p>

<p>"Well," said Lingard, and with that word he came unexpectedly
to the end of his speech. His hand in his pocket closed firmly
round the butt of his revolver bulging his jacket on the hip,
and he thought how soon and how quickly he could terminate his
quarrel with that man who had been so anxious to deliver himself
into his hands&mdash;and how inadequate would be that ending! He could
not bear the idea of that man escaping from him by going out of
life; escaping from fear, from doubt, from remorse into the peaceful
certitude of death. He held him now. And he was not going to let
him go&mdash;to let him disappear for ever in the faint blue smoke
of a pistol shot. His anger grew within him. He felt a touch as
of a burning hand on his heart. Not on the flesh of his breast,
but a touch on his heart itself, on the palpitating and untiring
particle of matter that responds to every emotion of the soul;
that leaps with joy, with terror, or with anger.</p>

<p>He drew a long breath. He could see before him the bare chest
of the man expanding and collapsing under the wide-open jacket.
He glanced aside, and saw the bosom of the woman near him rise
and fall in quick respirations that moved slightly up and down
her hand, which was pressed to her breast with all the fingers
spread out and a little curved, as if grasping something too big
for its span. And nearly a minute passed. One of those minutes
when the voice is silenced, while the thoughts flutter in the
head, like captive birds inside a cage, in rushes desperate, exhausting
and vain.</p>

<p>During that minute of silence Lingard’s anger kept rising, immense
and towering, such as a crested wave running over the troubled
shallows of the sands. Its roar filled his cars; a roar so powerful
and distracting that, it seemed to him, his head must burst directly
with the expanding volume of that sound. He looked at that man.
That infamous figure upright on its feet, still, rigid, with stony
eyes, as if its rotten soul had departed that moment and the carcass
hadn’t had the time yet to topple over. For the fraction of a
second he had the illusion and the fear of the scoundrel having
died there before the enraged glance of his eyes. Willems’ eyelids
fluttered, and the unconscious and passing tremor in that stiffly
erect body exasperated Lingard like a fresh outrage. The fellow
dared to stir! Dared to wink, to breathe, to exist; here, right
before his eyes! His grip on the revolver relaxed gradually. As
the transport of his rage increased, so also his contempt for
the instruments that pierce or stab, that interpose themselves
between the hand and the object of hate. He wanted another kind
of satisfaction. Naked hands, by heaven! No firearms. Hands that
could take him by the throat, beat down his defence, batter his
face into shapeless flesh; hands that could feel all the desperation
of his resistance and overpower it in the violent delight of a
contact lingering and furious, intimate and brutal.</p>

<p>He let go the revolver altogether, stood hesitating, then throwing
his hands out, strode forward&mdash;and everything passed from his
sight. He could not see the man, the woman, the earth, the sky&mdash;saw
nothing, as if in that one stride he had left the visible world
behind to step into a black and deserted space. He heard screams
round him in that obscurity, screams like the melancholy and pitiful
cries of sea-birds that dwell on the lonely reefs of great oceans.
Then suddenly a face appeared within a few inches of his own.
His face. He felt something in his left hand. His throat . . .
Ah! the thing like a snake’s head that darts up and down . . .
He squeezed hard. He was back in the world. He could see the quick
beating of eyelids over a pair of eyes that were all whites, the
grin of a drawn-up lip, a row of teeth gleaming through the drooping
hair of a moustache . . . Strong white teeth. Knock them down
his lying throat . . . He drew back his right hand, the fist up
to the shoulder, knuckles out. From under his feet rose the screams
of sea-birds. Thousands of them. Something held his legs . . .
What the devil . . . He delivered his blow straight from the shoulder,
felt the jar right up his arm, and realized suddenly that he was
striking something passive and unresisting. His heart sank within
him with disappointment, with rage, with mortification. He pushed
with his left arm, opening the hand with haste, as if he had just
perceived that he got hold by accident of something repulsive&mdash;and
he watched with stupefied eyes Willems tottering backwards in
groping strides, the white sleeve of his jacket across his face.
He watched his distance from that man increase, while he remained
motionless, without being able to account to himself for the fact
that so much empty space had come in between them. It should have
been the other way. They ought to have been very close, and .
. . Ah! He wouldn’t fight, he wouldn’t resist, he wouldn’t defend
himself! A cur! Evidently a cur! . . . He was amazed and aggrieved&mdash;profoundly,
bitterly&mdash;with the immense and blank desolation of a small child
robbed of a toy. He shouted&mdash;unbelieving:</p>

<p>"Will you be a cheat to the end?"</p>

<p>He waited for some answer. He waited anxiously with an impatience
that seemed to lift him off his feet. He waited for some word,
some sign; for some threatening stir. Nothing! Only two unwinking
eyes glittered intently at him above the white sleeve. He saw
the raised arm detach itself from the face and sink along the
body. A white clad arm, with a big stain on the white sleeve.
A red stain. There was a cut on the cheek. It bled. The nose bled
too. The blood ran down, made one moustache look like a dark rag
stuck over the lip, and went on in a wet streak down the clipped
beard on one side of the chin. A drop of blood hung on the end
of some hairs that were glued together; it hung for a while and
took a leap down on the ground. Many more followed, leaping one
after another in close file. One alighted on the breast and glided
down instantly with devious vivacity, like a small insect running
away; it left a narrow dark track on the white skin. He looked
at it, looked at the tiny and active drops, looked at what he
had done, with obscure satisfaction, with anger, with regret.
This wasn’t much like an act of justice. He had a desire to go
up nearer to the man, to hear him speak, to hear him say something
atrocious and wicked that would justify the violence of the blow.
He made an attempt to move, and became aware of a close embrace
round both his legs, just above the ankles. Instinctively, he
kicked out with his foot, broke through the close bond and felt
at once the clasp transferred to his other leg; the clasp warm,
desperate and soft, of human arms. He looked down bewildered.
He saw the body of the woman stretched at length, flattened on
the ground like a dark blue rag. She trailed face downwards, clinging
to his leg with both arms in a tenacious hug. He saw the top of
her head, the long black hair streaming over his foot, all over
the beaten earth, around his boot. He couldn’t see his foot for
it. He heard the short and repeated moaning of her breath. He
imagined the invisible face close to his heel. With one kick into
that face he could free himself. He dared not stir, and shouted
down&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let go! Let go! Let go!"</p>

<p>The only result of his shouting was a tightening of the pressure
of her arms. With a tremendous effort he tried to bring his right
foot up to his left, and succeeded partly. He heard distinctly
the rub of her body on the ground as he jerked her along. He tried
to disengage himself by drawing up his foot. He stamped. He heard
a voice saying sharply&mdash;</p>

<p>"Steady, Captain Lingard, steady!"</p>

<p>His eyes flew back to Willems at the sound of that voice, and,
in the quick awakening of sleeping memories, Lingard stood suddenly
still, appeased by the clear ring of familiar words. Appeased
as in days of old, when they were trading together, when Willems
was his trusted and helpful companion in out-of-the-way and dangerous
places; when that fellow, who could keep his temper so much better
than he could himself, had spared him many a difficulty, had saved
him from many an act of hasty violence by the timely and good-humoured
warning, whispered or shouted, "Steady, Captain Lingard, steady."
A smart fellow. He had brought him up. The smartest fellow in
the islands. If he had only stayed with him, then all this . .
. He called out to Willems&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell her to let me go or . . ."</p>

<p>He heard Willems shouting something, waited for awhile, then
glanced vaguely down and saw the woman still stretched out perfectly
mute and unstirring, with her head at his feet. He felt a nervous
impatience that, somehow, resembled fear.</p>

<p>"Tell her to let go, to go away, Willems, I tell you. I’ve had
enough of this," he cried.</p>

<p>"All right, Captain Lingard," answered the calm voice of Willems,
"she has let go. Take your foot off her hair; she can’t get up."</p>

<p>Lingard leaped aside, clean away, and spun round quickly. He
saw her sit up and cover her face with both hands, then he turned
slowly on his heel and looked at the man. Willems held himself
very straight, but was unsteady on his feet, and moved about nearly
on the same spot, like a tipsy man attempting to preserve his
balance. After gazing at him for a while, Lingard called, rancorous
and irritable&mdash;</p>

<p>"What have you got to say for yourself?"</p>

<p>Willems began to walk towards him. He walked slowly, reeling
a little before he took each step, and Lingard saw him put his
hand to his face, then look at it holding it up to his eyes, as
if he had there, concealed in the hollow of the palm, some small
object which he wanted to examine secretly. Suddenly he drew it,
with a brusque movement, down the front of his jacket and left
a long smudge.</p>

<p>"That’s a fine thing to do," said Willems.</p>

<p>He stood in front of Lingard, one of his eyes sunk deep in the
increasing swelling of his cheek, still repeating mechanically
the movement of feeling his damaged face; and every time he did
this he pressed the palm to some clean spot on his jacket, covering
the white cotton with bloody imprints as of some deformed and
monstrous hand. Lingard said nothing, looking on. At last Willems
left off staunching the blood and stood, his arms hanging by his
side, with his face stiff and distorted under the patches of coagulated
blood; and he seemed as though he had been set up there for a
warning: an incomprehensible figure marked all over with some
awful and symbolic signs of deadly import. Speaking with difficulty,
he repeated in a reproachful tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"That was a fine thing to do."</p>

<p>"After all," answered Lingard, bitterly, "I had too good an opinion
of you."</p>

<p>"And I of you. Don’t you see that I could have had that fool
over there killed and the whole thing burnt to the ground, swept
off the face of the earth. You wouldn’t have found as much as
a heap of ashes had I liked. I could have done all that. And I
wouldn’t."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;could&mdash;not. You dared not. You scoundrel!" cried Lingard.</p>

<p>"What’s the use of calling me names?"</p>

<p>"True," retorted Lingard&mdash;"there’s no name bad enough for you."</p>

<p>There was a short interval of silence. At the sound of their
rapidly exchanged words, Aissa had got up from the ground where
she had been sitting, in a sorrowful and dejected pose, and approached
the two men. She stood on one side and looked on eagerly, in a
desperate effort of her brain, with the quick and distracted eyes
of a person trying for her life to penetrate the meaning of sentences
uttered in a foreign tongue: the meaning portentous and fateful
that lurks in the sounds of mysterious words; in the sounds surprising,
unknown and strange.</p>

<p>Willems let the last speech of Lingard pass by; seemed by a slight
movement of his hand to help it on its way to join the other shadows
of the past. Then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have struck me; you have insulted me . . ."</p>

<p>"Insulted you!" interrupted Lingard, passionately. "Who&mdash;what
can insult you . . . you . . ."</p>

<p>He choked, advanced a step.</p>

<p>"Steady! steady!" said Willems calmly. "I tell you I sha’n’t
fight. Is it clear enough to you that I sha’n’t? <em>I&mdash;</em>shall&mdash;not&mdash;lift&mdash;a&mdash;finger."</p>

<p>As he spoke, slowly punctuating each word with a slight jerk
of his head, he stared at Lingard, his right eye open and big,
the left small and nearly closed by the swelling of one half of
his face, that appeared all drawn out on one side like faces seen
in a concave glass. And they stood exactly opposite each other:
one tall, slight and disfigured; the other tall, heavy and severe.</p>

<p>Willems went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"If I had wanted to hurt you&mdash;if I had wanted to destroy you,
it was easy. I stood in the doorway long enough to pull a trigger&mdash;and
you know I shoot straight."</p>

<p>"You would have missed," said Lingard, with assurance. "There
is, under heaven, such a thing as justice."</p>

<p>The sound of that word on his own lips made him pause, confused,
like an unexpected and unanswerable rebuke. The anger of his outraged
pride, the anger of his outraged heart, had gone out in the blow;
and there remained nothing but the sense of some immense infamy&mdash;of
something vague, disgusting and terrible, which seemed to surround
him on all sides, hover about him with shadowy and stealthy movements,
like a band of assassins in the darkness of vast and unsafe places.
Was there, under heaven, such a thing as justice? He looked at
the man before him with such an intensity of prolonged glance
that he seemed to see right through him, that at last he saw but
a floating and unsteady mist in human shape. Would it blow away
before the first breath of the breeze and leave nothing behind?</p>

<p>The sound of Willems’ voice made him start violently. Willems
was saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have always led a virtuous life; you know I have. You always
praised me for my steadiness; you know you have. You know also
I never stole&mdash;if that’s what you’re thinking of. I borrowed.
You know how much I repaid. It was an error of judgment. But then
consider my position there. I had been a little unlucky in my
private affairs, and had debts. Could I let myself go under before
the eyes of all those men who envied me? But that’s all over.
It was an error of judgment. I’ve paid for it. An error of judgment."</p>

<p>Lingard, astounded into perfect stillness, looked down. He looked
down at Willems’ bare feet. Then, as the other had paused, he
repeated in a blank tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"An error of judgment . . ."</p>

<p>"Yes," drawled out Willems, thoughtfully, and went on with increasing
animation: "As I said, I have always led a virtuous life. More
so than Hudig&mdash;than you. Yes, than you. I drank a little, I played
cards a little. Who doesn’t? But I had principles from a boy.
Yes, principles. Business is business, and I never was an ass.
I never respected fools. They had to suffer for their folly when
they dealt with me. The evil was in them, not in me. But as to
principles, it’s another matter. I kept clear of women. It’s forbidden
&mdash;I had no time&mdash;and I despised them. Now I hate them!"</p>

<p>He put his tongue out a little; a tongue whose pink and moist
end ran here and there, like something independently alive, under
his swollen and blackened lip; he touched with the tips of his
fingers the cut on his cheek, felt all round it with precaution:
and the unharmed side of his face appeared for a moment to be
preoccupied and uneasy about the state of that other side which
was so very sore and stiff.</p>

<p>He recommenced speaking, and his voice vibrated as though with
repressed emotion of some kind.</p>

<p>"You ask my wife, when you see her in Macassar, whether I have
no reason to hate her. She was nobody, and I made her Mrs. Willems.
A half-caste girl! You ask her how she showed her gratitude to
me. You ask . . . Never mind that. Well, you came and dumped me
here like a load of rubbish; dumped me here and left me with nothing
to do&mdash;nothing good to remember&mdash;and damn little to hope for.
You left me here at the mercy of that fool, Almayer, who suspected
me of something. Of what? Devil only knows. But he suspected and
hated me from the first; I suppose because you befriended me.
Oh! I could read him like a book. He isn’t very deep, your Sambir
partner, Captain Lingard, but he knows how to be disagreeable.
Months passed. I thought I would die of sheer weariness, of my
thoughts, of my regrets And then . . ."</p>

<p>He made a quick step nearer to Lingard, and as if moved by the
same thought, by the same instinct, by the impulse of his will,
Aissa also stepped nearer to them. They stood in a close group,
and the two men could feel the calm air between their faces stirred
by the light breath of the anxious woman who enveloped them both
in the uncomprehending, in the despairing and wondering glances
of her wild and mournful eyes.</p>
