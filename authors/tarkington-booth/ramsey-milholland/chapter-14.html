<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>That early spring of 1915 the two boys and their friends and
Brethren talked more of the war than they had in the autumn, though
the subject was not an all at absorbing one; for the trenches
in Flanders and France were still of the immense, remote distance.
By no stretch of imagination could these wet trenches be thought
greatly to concern the "frat," the Lumen, or the university. Really
important matters were the doings of the "Track Team," now training
in the "Gym" and on the 'Varsity Field, and, more vital still,
the prospects of the Nine. But in May there came a shock which
changed things for a time.</p>

<p>The <em>Lusitania</em> brought to every American a revelation
of what had lain so deep in his own heart that often he had not
realized it was there. When the Germans hid in the sea and sent
down the great merchant ship, with American babies and their mothers,
and gallantly dying American gentlemen, there came a change even
to girls and boys and professors, until then so preoccupied with
their own little aloof world thousands of miles from the murder.</p>

<p>Fred Mitchell, ever volatile and generous, was one of those who
went quite wild. No orator, he nevertheless made a frantic speech
at the week's "frat meetings," cursing the Germans in the simple
old English words that their performance had demonstrated to be
applicable, and going on to demand that the fraternity prepare
for its own share in the action of the country. "I don't care
<em>how</em> insignificant we few fellows here to-night may seem,"
he cried; "we can do our little, and if everybody in this country's
ready to do their own little, why, that'll be plenty! Brothers,
don't you realize that all <em>over</em> the United States to-night
the people are feeling just the way we are here? Millions and
millions and millions of them! Wherever there's an American he's
<em>with</em> us&mdash;and you bet your bottom dollar there are just
a few more Americans in this country of ours than there are big-mouthed
lobsters like that fellow Linski! I tell you, if Congress only
gives the word, there could be an army of five million men in
this country to-morrow, and those dirty baby-killin' dachshunds
would hear a word or two from your Uncle Samuel! Brothers, I demand
that something be done right here and now, and by us! I move we
telegraph the Secretary of War to-night and offer him a regiment
from this university to go over and help <em>hang</em> their damn
Kaiser."</p>

<p>The motion was hotly seconded and instantly carried. Then followed
a much flustered discussion of the form and phrasing of the proposed
telegram, but, after everything seemed to have been settled, someone
ascertained by telephone that the telegraph company would not
accept messages containing words customarily defined as profane;
so the telegram had to be rewritten. This led to further amendment,
and it was finally decided to address the senators from that state,
instead of the Secretary of War, and thus in a somewhat modified
form the message was finally despatched.</p>

<p>Next day, news of what the "frat" had done made a great stir
in the university; other "frats" sent telegrams, so did the "Barbarians," 
haters of the "frats" but joining them in this; while a small
band of "German-American" students found it their duty to go before
the faculty and report these "breaches of neutrality." They protested
heavily, demanding the expulsion of the "breachers" as disloyal
citizens, therefore unfit students, but suffered a disappointment;
for the faculty itself had been sending telegrams of similar spirit,
addressing not only the senators and congressmen of the state
but the President of the United States. Flabbergasted, the "German-Americans"
retired; they were confused and disgusted by this higher-up outbreak
of unneutrality&mdash;it overwhelmed them that citizens of the United
States should not remain neutral in the dispute between the United
States and Germany. All day the campus was in ferment.</p>

<p>At twilight, Ramsey was walking meditatively on his way to dinner
at the "frat house," across the campus from his apartment at Mrs.
Meig's. Everybody was quiet now, both town and gown; the students
were at their dinners and so were the burghers. Ramsey was late
but did not quicken his thoughtful steps, which were those of
one lost in reverie. He had forgotten that spring-time was all
about him, and, with his head down, walked unregardful of the
new gayeties flung forth upon the air by great clusters of flowering
shrubs, just come into white blossom and lavender.</p>

<p>He was unconscious that somebody behind him, going the same way,
came hastening to overtake him and called his name, "Ramsey! Ramsey
Milholland!" Not until he had been called three times did he realize
that he was being hailed&mdash;and in a girl's voice! By that time,
the girl herself was beside him, and Ramsey halted, quite taken
aback. The girl was Dora Yocum.</p>

<p>She was pale, a little breathless, and her eyes were bright and
severe. "I want to speak to you," she said, quickly. "I want to
ask you about something. Mr. Colburn and Fred Mitchell are the
only people I know in your 'frat' except you, and I haven't seen
either of them to-day, or I'd have asked one of them."</p>

<p>Most uncomfortably astonished, Ramsey took his hands out of his
pockets, picked a leaf from a lilac bush beside the path, and
put the stem of the leaf seriously into a corner of his mouth,
before finding anything to say. "Well&mdash;well, all right," he finally
responded. "I'll tell you&mdash;if it's anything I know about."</p>

<p>"You know about it," said Dora. "That is, you certainly do if
you were at your 'frat' meeting last night. Were you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I was there," Ramsey answered, wondering what in the world
she wanted to know, though he supposed vaguely that it must be
something about Colburn, whom he had several times seen walking
with her. "Of course I couldn't tell you much," he added, with
an afterthought. "You see, a good deal that goes on at a 'frat'
meeting isn't supposed to be talked about."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, smiling faintly, though with a satire that missed
him. "I've been a member of a sorority since September, and I
think I have an idea of what could be told or not told. Suppose
we walk on, if you don't mind. My question needn't embarrass you."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as they slowly went on together, Ramsey was embarrassed.
He felt "queer." They had known each other so long; in a way had
shared so much, sitting daily for years near each other and undergoing
the same outward experiences; they had almost "grown up together,"
yet this was the first time they had ever talked together or walked
together.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" he said. "If you want to ask anything it's all right
for me to tell you&mdash;well, I just as soon, I guess."</p>

<p>"It has nothing to do with the secret proceedings of your 'frat',"
said Dora, primly. "What I want to ask about has been talked of
all over the place to-day. Everyone has been saying it was <em>your</em>
'frat' that sent the first telegram to members of the Government
offering support in case of war with Germany. They say you didn't
even wait until to-day, but sent off a message last night. What
I wanted to ask you was whether this story is true or not?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Ramsey, mildly. "That's what we did."</p>

<p>She uttered an exclamation, a sound of grief and of suspicion
confirmed. "Ah! I was afraid so!"</p>

<p>"'Afraid so'? What's the matter?" he asked, and because she seemed
excited and troubled, he found himself not quite so embarrassed
as he had been at first; for some reason her agitation made him
feel easier. "What was wrong about that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all so shocking and wicked and mistaken!" she cried.
"Even the faculty has been doing it, and half the other 'frats'
and sororities! And it was yours that started it."</p>

<p>"Yes, we did," he said, throughly puzzled. "We're the oldest
'frat' here, and of course"&mdash;he chuckled modestly&mdash;"of course
we think we're the best. Do you mean you believe we ought to've
sat back and let somebody else start it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>no</em>!" she answered, vehemently. "Nobody ought to
have started it! That's the trouble; don't you see? If nobody
had started it none of it might have happened. The rest mightn't
have caught it. It mightn't have got into their heads. A war thought
is the most contagious thought in the world; but if it can be
kept from starting, it can be kept from being contagious. It's
just when people have got into an emotional state, or a state
of smouldering rage, that everybody ought to be so terribly careful
not to think war thoughts or make war speeches&mdash;or send war telegrams!
I thought&mdash;oh, I was so sure I'd convinced Mr. Colburn of all
this, the last time we talked of it! He seemed to understand,
and I was sure he agreed with me." She bit her lip. "He was only
pretending &mdash;I see that now!"</p>

<p>"I guess he must 'a' been," said Ramsey, with admirable simplicity.
"He didn't talk about anything like that last night. He was as
much for it as anybody."</p>

<p>"I've no doubt!"</p>

<p>Ramsey made bold to look at her out of the side of his eye, and
as she was gazing tensely forward he continued his observation
for some time. She was obviously controlling agitation, almost
controlling tears, which seemed to threaten her very wide-open
eyes; for those now fully grown and noticeable eyewinkers of hers
were subject to fluctuations indicating such a threat. She looked
"hurt," and Ramsey was touched; there was something human about
her, then, after all. And if he had put his feeling into words
at the moment, he would have said that he guessed maybe he could
stand this ole girl, for a few minutes sometimes, better than
he'd always thought he could.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "Colburn prob'ly wouldn't want to hurt your
feelings or anything. Colburn&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He? He didn't! I haven't the faintest personal interest in what
he did."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Ramsey. "Well, excuse me; I thought prob'ly you were
sore because he'd jollied you about this pacifist stuff, and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" she said, sharply. "I'm not thinking of his having agreed
with <em>me</em> and fooling <em>me</em> about it. He just wanted
to make a pleasant impression on a girl, and said anything he
thought would please her. I don't care whether he does things
like that or not. What I care about is that the <em>principle</em>
didn't reach him and that he mocked it! I don't care about a petty
treachery to me, personally, but I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fraternal loyalty could not quite brook this. "Brother Colburn
is a perfectly honor'ble man," said Ramsey, solemnly. "He is one
of the most honor'ble men in this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course!" she cried. "Oh, can't I make you understand that
I'm not condemning him for a little flattery to me? I don't care
two straws for his showing that <em>I</em> didn't influence him.
He doesn't interest me, please understand."</p>

<p>Ramsey was altogether perplexed. "Well, I don't see what makes
you go for him so hard, then."</p>

<p>"I don't."</p>

<p>"But you said he was treach&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't <em>condemn</em> him for it," she insisted, despairingly.
"Don't you see the difference? I'm not condemning anybody; I'm
only lamenting.</p>

<p>"What about?</p>

<p>"About all of you that want <em>war</em>!"</p>

<p>"My golly!" Ramsey exclaimed. "You don't think those Dutchmen
were right to drown babies and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! I think they were ghastly murderers! I think they were detestable
and fiendish and monstrous and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, then, my goodness! What do you want?"</p>

<p>"I don't want war!"</p>

<p>"You don't?"</p>

<p>"I want Christianity!" she cried. "I can't think of the Germans
without hating them, and so to-day, when all the world is hating
them, I keep myself from thinking of them as much as I can. Already
half the world is full of war; you want to go to war to make things
right, but it won't; it will only make more war!"</p>

<p>"Well, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you see what you've done, you boys?" she said. "Don't
you see what you've done with your absurd telegram? That started
the rest; they thought they <em>all</em> had to send telegrams
like that."</p>

<p>"Well, the faculty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Even they mightn't have thought of it if it hadn't been for
the first one. Vengeance is the most terrible thought; once you
put it into people's minds that they ought to have it, it runs
away with them."</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't mostly vengeance we're after, at all. There's
a lot more to it than just getting even with&mdash;"</p>

<p>She did not heed him. "You're all blind! You don't see what you're
doing; you don't even see what you've done to this peaceful place
here. You've filled it full of thoughts of fury and killing and
massacre&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, no," said Ramsey. "It was those Dutch did that to us; and,
besides, there's more to it than you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, there isn't," she interrupted. "It's just the old brutal
spirit that nations inherit from the time they were only tribes;
it's the tribe spirit, and an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
tooth. It's those things and the love of fighting&mdash;men have always
loved to fight. Civilization hasn't taken it out of them; men
still have the brute in them that loves to fight!"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said Ramsey. "Americans don't love to fight;
I don't know about other countries, but we don't. Of course, here
and there, there's some fellow that likes to hunt around for scrapes,
but I never saw more than three or four in my life that acted
that way. Of course a football team often has a scrapper or two
on it, but that's different."</p>

<p>"No," she said. "I think you all really love to fight."</p>

<p>Ramsey was roused to become argumentative. "I don't see where
you get the idea. Colburn isn't that way, and back at school there
wasn't a single boy that was anything like that."</p>

<p>"What!" She stopped, and turned suddenly to face him.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he said, stopping, too. Something he said
had startled her, evidently.</p>

<p>"How can you say such a thing?" she cried. "<em>You</em> love
to fight!"</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"You do! You love fighting. You always have loved fighting."</p>

<p>He was dumbfounded. "Why, I never had a fight in my life!"</p>

<p>She cried out in protest of such prevarication.</p>

<p>"Well, I never did," he insisted, mildly.</p>

<p>"Why, you had a fight about <em>me</em>!"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't."</p>

<p>"With Wesley Bender!"</p>

<p>Ramsey chuckled. "<em>That</em> wasn't a fight!"</p>

<p>"It wasn't?"</p>

<p>"Nothing like one. We were just guyin' him about&mdash;about gettin'
slicked up, kind of, because he sat in front of you; and he hit
me with his book strap and I chased him off. Gracious, no; <em>that</em>
wasn't a fight!"</p>

<p>"But you fought Linski only last fall."</p>

<p>Ramsey chuckled again. "That wasn't even as much like a fight
as the one with Wesley. I just told this Linski I was goin' to
give him a punch in the sn&mdash; I just told him to look out because
I was goin' to hit him, and then I did it, and waited to see if
he wanted to do anything about it, and he didn't. That's all there
was to it, and it wasn't any more like fighting than&mdash;than feeding
chickens is."</p>

<p>She laughed dolefully. "It seems to me rather more like it than
that!"</p>

<p>"Well, it wasn't."</p>

<p>They had begun to walk on again, and Ramsey was aware that they
had passed the "frat house," where his dinner was probably growing
cold. He was aware of this, but not sharply or insistently. Curiously
enough, he did not think about it. He had begun to find something
pleasant in the odd interview, and in walking beside a girl, even
though the girl was Dora Yocum. He made no attempt to account
to himself for anything so peculiar.</p>

<p>For a while they went slowly together, not speaking, and without
destination, though Ramsey vaguely took it for granted that Dora
was going somewhere. But she wasn't. They emerged from the part
of the small town closely built about the university and came
out upon a bit of parked land overlooking the river; and here
Dora's steps slowed to an indeterminate halt near a bench beneath
a maple tree.</p>

<p>"I think I'll stay here a while," she said; and as he made no
response, she asked, "Hadn't you better be going back to your
'frat house' for your dinner? I didn't mean for you to come out
of your way with me; I only wanted to get an answer to my question.
You'd better be running back."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stood irresolute, not sure that he wanted his dinner just
then. It would have amazed him to face the fact deliberately that
perhaps he preferred being with Dora Yocum to eating. However,
he faced no such fact, nor any fact, but lingered.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" he said again.</p>

<p>"You'd better go."</p>

<p>"I guess I can get my dinner pretty near any time. I don't&mdash;"
He had a thought. "Did you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did I what?"</p>

<p>"Did you have your dinner before I met you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, aren't you&mdash;"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I don't want any."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't think people have very much appetite to-day and yesterday,"
she said, with the hint of a sad laugh, "all over America."</p>

<p>"No; I guess that's so."</p>

<p>"It's too terrible!" she said. "I can't sit and eat when I think
of the <em>Lusitania</em>&mdash;of all those poor, poor people strangling
in the water&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No; I guess nobody can eat much, if they think about that."</p>

<p>"And of what it's going to bring, if we let it," she went on.
"As if this killing weren't enough, we want to add <em>our</em>
killing! Oh, that's the most terrible thing of all&mdash;the thing
it makes within us! Don't you understand?"</p>

<p>She turned to him appealingly, and he felt queerer than ever.
Dusk had fallen. Where they stood, under the young-leaved maple
tree, there was but a faint lingering of afterglow, and in this
mystery her face glimmered wan and sweet; so that Ramsey, just
then, was like one who discovers an old pan, used in the kitchen,
to be made of chased silver.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't feel much like dinner right now," he said. "We&mdash;we
could sit here awhile on this bench, prob'ly."</p>
