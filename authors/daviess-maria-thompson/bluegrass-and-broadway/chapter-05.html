<p>It may be that in the long life of Mr. Godfrey Vandeford he had passed a
more perturbed evening than that on which he led his protégé, the author
of "The Purple Slipper," to her début under the white lights of
Broadway, but he could not recall the occasion. His grilling had begun
while he waited for his charge to descend in the lobby of the Y. W. C.
A. and it ended--
</p>
<p>"We are delighted to have Miss Adair stay with us while her play is
being rehearsed," a very pleasant young woman, with a trim figure, kind
and wise eyes, and gray-sprinkled hair, remarked to him after she had
whistled the fact of his arrival above. "When such men as you, Mr.
Vandeford, begin to put on clean historical plays, many of our anxieties
will be over. I look on each musical show that appears on Broadway as a
personal enemy."
</p><p>"I am glad indeed, Madam, that we are going to claim you as a friend of
'The Purple Slipper,'" Mr. Vandeford answered, with his most pleasant
smile. Somehow the sight and sound of that executive young woman in
charge of his young author gave him a calmness that he needed, and his
confidence shone in his face.
</p><p>"We are deeply interested in Miss Adair, for we have had influential
letters sent us about her, and of course we are looking forward with
eagerness to seeing her play. She is such a dear child!"
</p><p>The influential letters and the increased warmth in the young woman's
tone in speaking about his author drew Mr. Vandeford still nearer to
her, both in body and in spirit. He leaned slightly against the desk and
smiled again.
</p><p>"May I send you seats for some night the first week of 'The Purple
Slipper'?" he asked, with the greatest deference. And it must be
recorded that in making the offer Mr. Vandeford was not bidding for the
distinction conferred on him in the next few seconds.
</p><p>"That will be delightful," exclaimed the young woman. "And, Mr.
Vandeford, here is a latch-key to the front door, to use to-night if you
and Miss Adair are a little later than midnight in coming home. Remember
to give it to her after you have put her inside the door and tell her to
hang it on the rack opposite the number of her room. There she comes
now!"
</p><p>Mr. Vandeford accepted the latch-key of the Y. W. C. A. with awe and
looked at it as he would have looked at a decoration handed him by the
Metropolitan governors. Then he glanced up and beheld Miss Adair
displaying herself to his new-found friend.
</p><p>"You are very pretty, my dear," she was saying with an affectionate
smile. "Just let me put a pin here in this fold of lace," and expertly
she reefed up the last fold of rose-point that Miss Lindsey had snipped
down in a hurried finish of her remodeling. Strange to say Mr.
Vandeford felt still more further drawn to his young Christian
Association friend.
</p><p>"Now run along, both of you, and have a pleasant evening," she said to
them as she turned to answer the telephone.
</p><p>"That girl is an extremely delightful person," Mr. Vandeford remarked,
while he and Valentine were tucking Miss Adair under the linen robe in
the car.
</p><p>"I'm so glad you are getting used to the Y. W. C. A.," Miss Adair
answered, giving him a delighted smile as he seated himself beside her
while Valentine started the car up the avenue. "Mr. Height said it was
like being forced to go to church in a strange town and getting into
somebody's cozy corner by mistake."
</p><p>"I wish I were married to that girl, to-night," Mr. Vandeford exclaimed
out of the sudden rush of anxiety that had overtaken him by this
fledgling author's mention of his leading man.
</p><p>"Then who would be taking me out, out on Broadway?" asked Miss Adair
with a little laugh that had a more distinctly friendly note in it than
it had before held for him.
</p><p>"Both of us," replied Mr. Vandeford, with an answering laugh that
sounded much too young in his own ears. "You'll need two."
</p><p>"Am I going to have as many dreadful things happen to me to-night as I
was going to have when I met Mr. Corbett and Mr. Benjamin David and Mr.
Height and the other theatrical people? Am I being warned again?" Mr.
Vandeford accepted the teasing and laughed at himself.
</p><p>"My wings are up. Go out and scratch for yourself."
</p><p>"Not very far, though," Miss Adair answered. Mr. Vandeford was not sure
that she moved a fraction of an inch nearer to him, but he hoped so. "I
feel just the same about you as I do about Roger and I like to be going
with you--into--into danger."
</p><p>"Who's Roger?" questioned Mr. Vandeford.
</p><p>"He's my brother, who treats me as you do. It's fun for a woman to be
frightened dreadfully when she is with a man she likes." Again there was
that uncertainty as to whether Miss Adair fluttered a fraction of an
inch in his direction, and for the life of him Mr. Vandeford could not
say whence had flown all the many ways he would have commanded
ordinarily for the finding out if such were the case.
</p><p>"A frightened woman is often rather--rather deadly to a man," he
answered before he could stop himself. The habit of speaking out
directly to Miss Adair was growing on him, he perceived, and it alarmed
him.
</p><p>"Into what danger are you taking me now?" asked Miss Adair with a fluty,
merry laugh.
</p><p>"We are going with Mr. Farraday and Miss Hawtry to see the Big Show and
to the Grove Garden on the roof afterward for supper. Just a slow, usual
sort of an evening, but Denny thought it would be fun for you to see
the Big Show and the Big Feed and the Big Dance by way of initiation,"
Mr. Vandeford answered, with an entire lack of enthusiasm.
</p><p>"I wanted to see what you wanted me to see this first night," Miss Adair
said with the affectionate frankness of six years going on seven. "What
would that be?"
</p><p>"We'll see it to-morrow night," Mr. Vandeford answered her, and this
time the tenderness in his voice surprised him and he considered it
entirely unjustifiable.
</p><p>"Mr. Height was going to take me to see Maude Adams, but I know he'll
put it off again when I tell him that you want me to--"
</p><p>"No, don't! Let Height get Maude Adams out of his system, for Heaven's
sake," snapped Mr. Vandeford, this time in unjustifiable temper.
</p><p>"Why, what is--" Miss Adair was asking of Mr. Vandeford in positive
alarm when Valentine stopped before the blazing doorway of the Big Show.
A functionary seven feet tall opened the door of the car and all but
literally extracted them by force, for he was anxious to repeat the
operation on the occupants of the car chugging behind them.
</p><p>Now, there are many, many fair women born within the state lines of Old
Kentucky who live calm and peaceful lives and die and are buried with no
greater contrast of experience than comes from birth and death, love and
hate, riches and poverty, and they never know the difference; but
occasionally one bursts out of her bonds and flames her beauty over
strange worlds, in foreign embassies, in the courts of St. James or
Petrograd, or in an opera or theater box in New York. When this eruption
occurs many sparks fly. And many sparks from bright eyes were showered
on the author of "The Purple Slipper," who sat calmly unaware in the
left stage-box of the Big Show that August night beside the notorious
Hawtry, Mr. Godfrey Vandeford, and Mr. Dennis Farraday. And of the
sparks no one was more conscious than both Miss Hawtry and Mr.
Vandeford, while big Dennis was in a blissfully ignorant state of mind
like to that of Miss Patricia Adair of Adairville, Kentucky. Though he
had been for about forty-eight hours a producer on the rear side of the
footlights, Mr. Farraday still had the attitude of mind possessed by one
of an audience, and he watched the stage rather than the "front." He
thus failed to get the impression created by his guest from Kentucky,
and blissfully left Mr. Vandeford to deal with her sensations derived
from the show. Mr. Vandeford had his hands full.
</p><p>To Miss Adair the Big Show was a series of mental and moral and artistic
explosions. She sat with delight through the Japanese acrobats and Swiss
quartette of yodelers, and she welcomed pretty, pert little Mazie
Villines with enthusiasm that gradually faded into horror as that artist
flaunted more and more lingerie and "dished the dirt" which the
inebriate playwright, at that moment engaged in "putting pep" into Miss
Adair's own beloved "Purple Slipper," <u>née</u> "The Renunciation of
Rosalind," had supplied. The "dirt" was received by the audience at
large with a hilarious joy that entirely justified the managers of the
Big Show for keeping Mazie busy "dishing."
</p><p>However, all things come to an end, and with a last provocative,
revealing kick Mazie was allowed to depart and give way to a pair of
young dancers who promised to display wares more wholesome.
</p><p>Without knowing why he did it, Mr. Vandeford leaned forward so that his
left ear was within reach of the whisper of Miss Adair's lips as she
turned her head and tilted it like a droopy flower toward his.
</p><p>"I've only seen Sarah Bernhardt and John Drew and Maude Adams and
Mansfield and Joe Jefferson and Arliss and the Coburns, up in
Louisville," she faltered with her eyes questioning his and wide open
with horror.
</p><p>"These next ones aren't so bad, and we'll go before any more come on
that--that you won't like," he whispered in return. He had glanced
through the program and seen that the climax would be an exhibition of
jungle courtship by one of America's most notorious women and her
partner, done to extreme negroid melody.
</p><p>"Thank you," she murmured as she turned to watch the willowy youth and
maid go through some very beautiful movements of the dance that was
entirely unobjectionable. In two minutes she had turned her face,
beaming with pleasure, so that Mr. Vandeford could see that all was well
with her; and ten minutes later she giggled out loud at the repartee of
two black-faced artists.
</p><p>During the respite that his knowledge of the numbers on the program gave
him, Mr. Vandeford did more of his peculiar brand of thinking, and
reached a diplomatic conclusion. By the intermission, which came just
before the jungle "big number" to give late comers time to gather in for
their salacious feast, he was ready to act.
</p><p>"Miss Adair and I are going to get a breath of air," he announced.
</p><p>"But the big number is next, and she might miss it," objected Miss
Hawtry, with solicitude for Miss Adair's pleasure. Mr. Vandeford had
thought past just that objection delivered by Miss Hawtry, and he knew
that in no way must he seem to be shielding the author of "The Purple
Slipper" from the salaciousness that gave Miss Hawtry great joy. If he
went too far in any act of comparative analysis he would bring danger
upon "The Purple Slipper," with whose fate Miss Adair's was one.
</p><p>"We'll be back in plenty of time," he lied.
</p><p>"Be sure!" Miss Hawtry commanded, and then turned to devote herself to
Mr. Farraday, who was laying himself out to salve what he thought must
be her pain at the loss of his beloved friend. The Violet had soon
caught his attitude toward her, and was encouraging his chivalry in
every way possible by the most pensive of poses as the generous
deserted. Such a situation is all to a woman's advantage if she knows
how to work it, and Miss Hawtry possessed that knowledge.
</p><p>"Van ought to have a medical degree for operating young girls' eyes
open, and making them see rose-colored for a while," she said with a
good-humored smile and a soft little sigh, as she raised her Irish eyes
in all their softness to Mr. Farraday's.
</p><p>To this insinuation, founded on an implied lie as far as the Hawtry was
concerned, Mr. Farraday made no reply, but turned to greet with fitting
applause the great dancer, on whose account one of the American artistic
bright lights had been extinguished forever, and in ten seconds was
inwardly thanking Vandeford for extracting Miss Adair before she had
felt the blighting smirch of the big number. While Mr. Farraday watched
the exhibition before him, Mr. Vandeford was amusing the child of their
joint solicitude by letting her look at the white lights. While waiting
at the curb before the Big Show for the large dignitary in uniform to
summon Valentine, he had directed that worthy to have a message sent in
to Miss Hawtry that they would join her at supper. Then upon the arrival
of his car, he had carefully inserted Miss Adair before he had said to
the puzzled Valentine:
</p><p>"Drive slowly down around the circle and down Broadway, so that you can
come back just while the theater crowd is on."
</p><p>Some instinct had led Mr. Vandeford to choose exactly the panacea to
soothe Miss Adair's shock--the lights of Broadway.
</p><p>"It's like fairy-land," she gasped, as they rolled down past
Forty-seventh Street. "Oh, look at the kitten chasing the spool, all in
electric lights!"
</p><p>"Wait a minute, and I'll show you an eagle flop his wings," promised Mr.
Vandeford, and he was surprised that he seemed for the first time to
feel the actual glory of the electric signs on his great Broadway, which
is as much of an all-American institution as the shipyards in Brooklyn.
</p><p>"All the world is on fire, and everybody is going to it," Miss Adair
exclaimed, as Valentine made his return just as the theaters were
pouring their crowds out into the seething maelstrom of the great
scintillating cañon. She watched as the big car stood motionless before
a stream of humanity that poured across its front wheels and then
bounded forward as blue-coated arms stemmed the tide on the edges of
both sidewalks for a few brief minutes in which they were allowed to
progress to a street beyond, where they were again halted, wedged in
with other impatient, purring cars.
</p><p>In a limousine next her Miss Adair saw a boy in a top hat, with white
gloves upon his hands, smother in an eager and unabashed embrace a
white-shouldered girl, whose arms went around his neck regardless of
"mother" assiduously looking the other way. In a car on the other side a
richly garbed gentleman dozed upon his cushions in triumphant inebriety.
Also, while she and Vandeford waited, she saw a guardian spinster shoo
a bevy of school-girls across in front of the cars, and turn in the
middle of the street to reprove a college boy for a laughing word tossed
to the combined bevy, while the blue arms on both sidewalks waved her
into haste so that they might unleash their restrained monster motors.
Everywhere protective men had women's arms fastened within their own and
were shoving through the throng, while other men and women jostled along
by themselves, or in companies of twos and threes, with laughing good
nature. Fakirs were crying many wares, and in and out squirmed newsboys
calling war extras in words that seemed to imply that New York was being
shelled from the sea, but did not make that exact statement.
</p><p>"It's all the world, and I'm a part of it," Miss Adair again said, and
Mr. Vandeford was again surprised at himself that he was not surprised
to find tears glinting in the sea-gray eyes raised to his.
</p><p>"<u>This</u> is the Big Show," he said with a little answering thrill in his
own voice, as the enormity of the scene he had witnessed night after
night broke on him for the first time.
</p><p>"They all live here and sleep here and eat here and work here
and--and--love here," she said softly, and smiled, for again the
limousine with the embracing lovers had paused by the side of
Valentine's car, and the embrace still held.
</p><p>"No, the sleepers and eaters and workers of New York were in bed long
ago. Everybody you see here in this push has his or her vital wires
connected up at Squeedunck, Illinois, or Zanesville, Indiana or--"
</p><p>"Or in Adairville, Kentucky," Miss Adair added with a laugh.
</p><p>"No, you belong--anywhere. Creative people ought to have no--no home
wires," Mr. Vandeford answered, and there was a queer sadness in his
voice that he did not himself understand. "People with messages must
have masses to hand them to. That's why you came, and, I suppose, must
stay."
</p><p>"Yes," answered Miss Adair, "I want to stay--if you'll let me."
</p><p>"I can't do otherwise," Mr. Vandeford answered her. Then he turned and
looked her full in her serious eyes. "But if you stay you will have to
accept broad standards, or suffer."
</p><p>"That Mazie woman?"
</p><p>"Maybe worse."
</p><p>She sat silent until, a few moments later, Valentine drew up again at
the curb before the Big Show, which had been out long enough to disperse
most of its crowd, and was now receiving supper guests for the Garden
Grove above.
</p><p>"I'm going to stay--with you--and 'The Purple Slipper,'" she announced,
as he reached into the car for her and swung her to the pavement.
</p><p>"Goes!" he answered, with mingled emotions, which he could not have
analyzed.
</p><p>Miss Adair was as good as her word. She accepted the reveling crowd of
the garden, looked upon the abandon of drinking women and men, with
only a slightly hunted expression in her eyes, and with her slim white
hands applauded Simone when that artist made most audacious slings of
her supple body in its scant clothing. She beamed upon the dancer when,
as Mrs. Trevor, she came, at Mr. Farraday's invitation, to have a glass
of champagne with them, and she quailed only once, when a band of
extremely young girls, clothed in filmy garments, took tiny
search-lights and went merrily hunting among the tables of laughing men
and women after the lights had been put out for the sport. Her horror at
observing Mr. Vandeford, who sat between her and the narrow aisle take
various moneys from his pocket to defend himself from successive
hunters, made her pale, and the moment the lights were flashed on again
she rose to go.
</p><p>"Wonder what they'll do next," muttered Mr. Farraday, as he helped her
into her wrap. Mr. Vandeford was not looking at his author or speaking.
Once when he had put his hand in his pocket to get out a coin for one
of the teasing girls with her search-light he had felt the Y. W. C. A.
latch-key there, and it had short-circuited him entirely.
</p><p>"I know you are tired. It takes some time to get the New York pace, but
you'll strike it. I think I'll stay to see the next Folly with Mr.
Farraday," he heard the Violet saying to Miss Adair, and still
short-circuited, he went with his calm young author down to the car. The
hour was one-thirty, and a moon had climbed the heights of the Broadway
cañon. Valentine, with some sort of psychic direction, went across
Central Park and down wide, clean, silent, and dimly lighted Fifth
Avenue. Both Mr. Vandeford and Miss Adair were silent, and he was not
aware that she was crying until just before they turned into her side
street.
</p><p>"They were so young, those girls, and they--they didn't want to--to do
that," she said with little catches in her beautiful, slurring,
Blue-grass voice.
</p><p>"Maybe they didn't; but they wouldn't go back now, not one," he answered
her.
</p><p>She was silenced, and stood quiet beside him as he opened the door of
the big, gloomy, protective building, with the key the woman of another
world than his had intrusted to him.
</p><p>"I know," she said at last, as she held out her hand to him. And because
it trembled ever so slightly and was cold, he put his warm lips to it
for a second before he handed her into a great international safety. He
remembered the key, but he didn't give it to her. Somehow he wanted it
himself. He liked the feel of it in his pocket.
</p><p>"Wish I had Denny locked up in the Christian association!" he growled to
himself as Valentine whirled him home.
</p><p>Just at that exact moment Mr. Dennis Farraday sat in Miss Violet
Hawtry's Louis Quinze parlor at the Claridge, engaged in tenderly and
awkwardly patting that star's sobbing white shoulder, as she lay on
just such a couch as Manon Lescaut probably had had for just such
scenes.
</p><p>"I don't blame him at all," sobbed Miss Hawtry, provocatively, with the
art of long practice both on the stage and off. "My kind always loses to
hers when the time comes."
</p><p>"Don't!" pleaded Mr. Farraday. It was all he could or was willing to
plead at that moment.
</p><p>"But I want to make good in this play for him and her--and you--before I
go out of his life forever. I want to repay him with--with both money
and happiness. He made me an artist." With these words Miss Hawtry made
an acknowledgment of the truth that she herself really believed to be
untrue, because she saw that to praise Mr. Vandeford was the best way to
blind Mr. Farraday while she approached him in that blindness. She knew
that his loyalty to his David would be a barrier unless she used it as a
ladder.
</p><p>"My God! How--how great women are!" was the immediate and hoped-for
response she drew from the big Jonathan.
</p><p>"My art must fill my life now. Only there will be--friendship. You make
me see that by the comfort of your kindness." Miss Hawtry laid her
flushed cheek in the hollow of good Dennis's big warm hand. The moment
was tense, but Hawtry had timed her line a little too far ahead, and it
failed to get across. The prey was as embarrassed as a girl and, with
another brotherly pat, arose to go.
</p><p>"You'll always let me do anything I can, won't you?" he asked as he
looked down upon her for a second, then took a considerate departure.
</p><p>"Boob!" muttered Hawtry to herself, as she rose and rang for Susette.
</p><p>There are in this little old world many men like Dennis Farraday; only
none of its inhabitants admit their existence.
</p><p>After the evening of the introduction of its author to Broadway, things
spun fast and furiously in the business of producing "The Purple
Slipper," and during the whirlwind of the day Miss Adair sat either in
her own private office or in the chair beside Mr. Vandeford, and reveled
in the excitement, and in the evenings did other revelings. She had her
evening with Mr. Height under the spell of Barrie and Maude Adams, and
Mr. Vandeford swore under his breath when she reported to him that they
had gone to the concert on the roof of the Waldorf for an hour, and had
got back to her abiding-place in time not to need the latch-key, which
still reposed in his pocket. He knew Gerald Height, and he was puzzled
and alarmed at this wary approach.
</p><p>Mrs. Farraday came to town, and the dinner-party in her staid, old
Washington Square home, with himself and Miss Lindsey and Miss Adair as
guests, was like a day's vacation for Mr. Vandeford. Also, he got a
complete off-guard picture of Miss Adair as he would see her in
Adairville, Kentucky, for she and the beautiful and stately Mrs.
Farraday spoke the same language and had the same forms.
</p><p>"My dear child, you positively must come up to Westchester for this
week-end! Matilda Van Tyne is going to come for the first blooming of
the rhododendrons in the West Marsh, and I feel sure that she must have
known your mother in some of her visits to Lexington. She must see you
and hear all about the play. Now, Dennis, make all the arrangements."
Mrs. Farraday gave her commands as a queen is accustomed to deliver
them.
</p><p>"May I go?" Miss Adair asked of Mr. Vandeford, her shining gray eyes
raised to his with deference and confidence as usual.
</p><p>"You may," answered Mr. Vandeford, aware that Mrs. Farraday's keen eyes
of the world were fixed upon him in a speculative way. "The rehearsals
will begin at eleven on Monday, and you can be back in plenty of time."
</p><p>"And, Miss Lindsey, will you come, too, with Miss Adair?" Mrs. Farraday
surprised both her son and Mr. Vandeford by asking the young Westerner
with the greatest graciousness. It was evident that the young leading
lady had put herself across with the grand dame, and both Mr. Vandeford
and Mr. Farraday rejoiced.
</p><p>"Oh, thank you, Mrs. Farraday, but I have made a professional engagement
for Saturday evening. I am going to do a monologue stunt to fill in at
the Colonial," Miss Lindsey answered, with pleasure at the invitation
shining in her dark eyes.
</p><p>"Then Dennis can drive down on Sunday and bring you back in time for tea
and to see the sunset on the rhododendrons." Mrs. Farraday further
surprised her son and Mr. Vandeford by giving this command the
imperiousness with which she was accustomed to issue her
much-sought-after invitations.
</p><p>"Great!" exclaimed Mr. Farraday, with the same sort of eager kindness
shining in his eyes as Miss Lindsey had met when he had asked her if
beefsteak and mushrooms would be the thing for her starvation. The
memory of that day made Miss Lindsey's eyes dim as she accepted the
invitation, though she had had hope of a last minute chance to do a
little Sunday "stunt" for Keith somewhere in subway New York. And Miss
Lindsey needed the money, for a hundred dollars doesn't go far in New
York even when carried in the pocket of a gown donned in the Y. W. C.
A.; but she needed the rhododendrons and the tea more than she needed
the material things that the extra fifty picked up at Keith's would have
purchased.
</p><p>"Thank you, Mrs. Farraday, it would be--be 'great' to come that way,"
Miss Lindsey answered. Both Mr. Vandeford and Mr. Farraday, as well as
Miss Adair, were struck with the sudden beauty that illumined Miss
Lindsey's dark face as she smiled and quoted Mr. Farraday in her
acceptance of his mother's invitation.
</p><p>"Is or is not little Lindsey a beauty, Denny?" asked Mr. Vandeford, as
they drove up-town in the Surreness after depositing the girls at their
nunnery.
</p><p>"I was just wondering," answered Mr. Farraday. "I'm mighty glad she made
such a hit with the mater."
</p><p>"And I'm mighty glad I'm going to lose the author of 'The Purple
Slipper' into the wilds of Westchester and the rhododendrons, while I
extract her play from Howard and slash it myself and help Rooney to
mutilate it further," said Mr. Vandeford.
</p><p>"Of course you are going to the mater's with Miss Lindsey and me for
tea, per usual?" asked Mr. Farraday.
</p><p>"Can't do it. Got to work on 'The Purple Slipper' while you people
frolic. Good-night!" With which refusal and taunt Mr. Vandeford left Mr.
Farraday at the door of his apartment-house.
</p><p>Mr. Farraday looked at his watch as he started away from the curb, found
the hour to be eleven o'clock, wabbled the machine first to the right
and then to the left, and finally turned down-town, in which direction
the Claridge reared its twelve stories of masonry at the corner of
Forty-fourth and Sixth.
</p><p>At about that minute these were the remarks exchanged through the open
door that connected two little cell-like rooms at the Y. W. C. A.:
</p><p>"Aren't you going to bed right away? I'm so sleepy that I'm brushing my
face instead of my hair," Miss Adair called to Miss Lindsey. A desperate
and continual desire for sleep is the pest that haunts the rural visitor
to New York and Miss Adair's young health was easily its prey. She did
not readily learn to run on nerves.
</p><p>"You go to bed; but I've got to let the hem of my tailored linen down
two inches, so it will brush against those rhododendrons as a lady's
should, and sew up the opening in the neck of my chiffon blouse an inch
and a half, so I won't spill any of Mrs. Farraday's tea down it.
Good-night!" It goes to say that when Greek meets Vandal or the East
meets the West, dents occur.
</p><p>And, as Mrs. Farraday had commanded, the rhododendron party at West
Marsh came to pass, to the vast enjoyment of all present, though Mr.
Vandeford's absence was a deprivation to the entire company. And that
night their friendly hearts would have ached if they had been able to
get a vision of his strenuosity. Godfrey Vandeford, Theatrical Producer,
was in full action, and chips from "The Purple Slipper" were flying in
all directions.
</p><p>In his bedroom in the Seventy-third Street apartment, Mr. Vandeford was
stripped for the fray--to his silk pajamas--and he lay stretched upon
his fumed-oak bed, with both reading-lights turned on full blaze. In his
hands was the manuscript of "The Purple Slipper," which Mazie Villines
had literally torn from under the hands of Grant Howard to deliver to
Mr. Vandeford on Saturday afternoon, just a day later than the time set
for its deliverance.
</p><p>"My check and Grant's down, or no play," she had said upon entering Mr.
Vandeford's apartment at about the setting of the Saturday sun. "He's
off for a two week's d.t., and I gotter take care of him. Twelve-fifty
is the way to write it."
</p><p>"Six hundred, and not a cent more without Grant's signature," answered
Mr. Vandeford. Mr. Adolph Meyers, who was listening to the conversation
from the hall from which he had ushered Miss Villines into Mr.
Vandeford's library, set a spring-lock on the entrance door of the
apartment, and entered the library unobtrusively.
</p><p>"Twelve-fifty, you old dollar-skinner!" averred the vaudeville star,
with a nasty little laugh.
</p><p>"Don't try to pull off a hold-up, Mazie. It won't work. It's Grant's
money," said Mr. Vandeford, with an icy calmness in his voice. And as
she spoke he looked at Mr. Adolph Meyers, who answered the look with
perfect comprehension.
</p><p>"Then you'll get the manuscript when hell freezes over or your wad
loosens," she again laughed, and this time turned toward the door with
the square manila portfolio under her arm.
</p><p>An interested spectator could not have said afterward just how it did
happen that in half a second the manila portfolio was in the hands of
Mr. Adolph Meyers, who also bore upon his left cheek a long and
profusely bleeding scratch.
</p><p>"Here's your check, child, and keep a good grip on Grant, so he can't
get started toward East River as he did last time," Mr. Vandeford said
as he handed an already prepared check to the enraged girl. She was dumb
for a second, no longer.
</p><p>"I was going to leave it for five hundred, you old white-skinned bluffer
with your goose-grease, strong arm," she finally blurted out, and in a
twinkling of her bright eyes her good-nature had returned. "Say, that is
some play now, and I wish you'd let me play a dance girl at that
dinner-party. I'd do it refined." There was a queer little appeal in the
mobile young face. "I'd like to doll up like a lady."
</p><p>"I'll think that over, Mazie," answered Mr. Vandeford. "A song and dance
from you might go all right."
</p><p>"Gimme a call, will you? I'll be on the job with my guzzler for a week
now. I got to get him past, for he's some meal-ticket when times is
dull." As Mazie disposed of the check in her stocking, a degree of
affectionate anxiety for the condition of Mr. Grant Howard showed in her
face for the fraction of a second, then disappeared as she looked at Mr.
Adolph Meyers.
</p><p>"Come on and get my wad from where I've put it, if you dare, Dolph," she
challenged, then laughed, as the imperturbable Mr. Meyers both ignored
and showed her to the door with all courtesy.
</p><p>And as he lay on his bed reading over the Howard manuscript of "The
Purple Slipper," which had just returned to him after a twenty-four hour
overhauling and annotation for action by Mr. William Rooney, the stage
director with the top price, Mr. Vandeford said to Mr. Adolph Meyers,
who sat at a table beside the bed, taking down and inserting notes into
the manuscript as they sprang from Mr. Vandeford's brain, almost before
they got past his lips:
</p><p>"No wonder Mazie could see herself in this show, Pops! Grant has pepped
it up almost to her standard. Whee-ugh!" With this whistle Mr. Vandeford
turned page twenty of the first act and handed it over to Mr. Meyers,
who began to devour it with eyes that took in almost the whole page at a
glance.
</p><p>"It is a snap-shot of Miss Hawtry he has made, Mr. Vandeford, sir. Mr.
Howard has never done better."
</p><p>"Yes, that's what he intended to do, but I'm going to clean it out a
bit. Run an insert of the scene on page five to seven and a half out of
Miss Adair's manuscript. It is just as good and a little--little
more--say, Pops, cut out seven lines on page fourteen from the second
down, and take this from me instead." Mr. Vandeford closed his eyes and
dictated a bit of dialogue between two of the minor characters of "The
Purple Slipper," which cleared up a point Mr. Howard and Mr. Rooney and
the original author had all left at loose ends. As he dictated, Mr.
Meyers wrote on the blank page opposite the lines, and made some
cabalistic signs for insertion.
</p><p>Slowly they progressed through the first act, Mr. Vandeford reading from
two manuscripts and reconciling Mr. Howard's shaky, pen annotations, Mr.
Rooney's blue-pencil, action directions, and Miss Adair's original
wanderings from the point with many brilliant returns in quaint
dialogue.
</p><p>"That child has got more brains and uses them less than would seem
possible," growled Mr. Vandeford, as he with a few deft lines near the
close of the second act got the heroine off the stage and out of an
impossible situation in which Miss Adair had involved her.
</p><p>"It is that her characters talk with interest, but act in awkwardness,
Mr. Vandeford, sir. Another good play can be written by Miss Adair,"
Mr. Meyers said as he put in two lines and a cross star sign.
</p><p>"God forbid!" ejaculated Mr. Vandeford, in all sincerity. "Here, Pops,
get this first act down to those girls waiting in the office. Did you
get two for all night, so one could get out the parts? You know Rooney
will expect a reading to-morrow before he begins rehearsals."
</p><p>"It is three girls now waiting at the office for the night, and a
messenger in your hall, Mr. Vandeford, sir," answered Mr. Meyers as he
gathered up his annotated pages, put them into a new manila portfolio,
and rose to take them to the A. D. T. boy asleep on the floor in the
hall.
</p><p>"We haven't rushed in a manuscript like this since 'Dear Geraldine,'
have we, Pops?" asked Mr. Vandeford, as he picked up the second act.
"It's just nine o'clock, and those girls ought to get through by three
A. M. Don't let Steinberg charge up twelve hours on you."
</p><p>"It will be at eight that they are still working, Mr. Vandeford, sir,
and night type-writing means much money," Mr. Meyers answered, as he
departed with his package.
</p><p>"At that we'd better get busy to feed it to 'em," Mr. Vandeford said, as
he picked up and began to dig into the pages.
</p><p>For the three hours ensuing he and his henchman worked with never a
hitch in their growls and scratches and muttered exchanges. Then, as
they came close to the climax of the last act, Mr. Vandeford sat up from
his pillows, which were heated almost beyond endurance with his night
lights and his tousled head, and gave forth a roar.
</p><p>"I'll be hanged if I'll let that scene between Rosalind and her lover go
with that filthy twist that Howard has given it! The words are almost
the original, but what will Hawtry make of what he's put into it?"
</p><p>"It will be the worst she makes," answered Mr. Meyers. "But it is for
pep very good, Mr. Vandeford, sir, and can be tried out."
</p><p>"That's right, Pops. I wonder if I am a Broadway producer or--or the
czar of a young ladies' seminary," Mr. Vandeford growled as he lay down,
and again went to work.
</p><p>"It is that Miss Adair will not understand it until Miss Hawtry is at
work, and before that all may be dead," Mr. Meyers consoled, as he, too,
fell upon "The Purple Slipper."
</p><p>At two-thirty the now soggy A. D. T. received the last manila envelope
to deliver to the busy girls down in Mr. Vandeford's office, and that
distinguished producer was stretched out on his bed in cool darkness
while Mr. Meyers was in a subway nodding his way up to his humble room
on One Hundred and Sixteenth Street.
</p><p>"If I live through seeing her past the reading of the blamed thing
to-morrow, I'll be stronger than I think I am," Mr. Vandeford murmured
as he felt the calmness of sleep fall upon him.
