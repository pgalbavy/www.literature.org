<p>The automobile with the constable and two prisoners sped down
the road, aiming to stride the main highway leading northward
to Augusta. It was a good run, but the machine ought to make it
before night closed in, for the days were long and the course
was favorable. The officer could have boarded the <em>Gardiner</em>
at one of the stopping places and made the journey by water, but
nothing was to be gained by so doing.</p>

<p>The chauffeur slowed down and honked as he drew near the turn
in the roadway. Just then he saw another auto coming from the
north and curving about to enter the road leading to Charmount.
It was similar to the car in which our friends were riding and
held only one passenger who sat beside the chauffeur, the rear
seat being empty.</p>

<p>Something in the appearance of the former struck Alvin as familiar.
He was middle-aged, neatly dressed, with sandy mustache and slightly
stooping shoulders. He looked sharply at the youth as the machines
drew nearer. A moment before they came opposite, he called out:</p>

<p>"Hello, Alvin! where are you going? Gabe, what's up?"</p>

<p>The latter query was addressed to the constable, the two being
old acquaintances. Each ordered his chauffeur to stop, and they
obeyed, with the machines side by side.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that Chester, who was the first to recognize
the man, called to his companion:</p>

<p>"It's Mr. Keyes Richards from Boothbay Harbor. He used to own
the Squirrel Inn, but has shifted over to Mouse Island."</p>

<p>"How do you, do, Mr. Richards?" saluted Alvin. "We are glad to
meet you."</p>

<p>"But I say what are you doing in this part of the world?" continued
the puzzled Richards.</p>

<p>"Ask <em>him</em>," replied Alvin, jerking his head toward the
officer behind him.</p>

<p>"Where did you pick up your passengers, Gabe?" inquired the other
of the officer, who was somewhat puzzled by the turn matters were
taking.</p>

<p>"Do you know them?" was his question.</p>

<p>"Well, rather; they're particular friends of mine; they are staying
for the summer on Southport. Are you kidnapping them?"</p>

<p>"That's what he is doing," Chester took upon himself to reply.</p>

<p>Alvin, feeling the humor of the scene, clasped his hands and
rolled his eyes toward heaven:</p>

<p>"Oh save us, kind sir! Save us, for he means to eat us up, and
then hang us and burn us at the stake. May I not rush to your
loving arms, Mr. Richards, before it is too late?"</p>

<p>Richards was more mystified than ever. He didn't know what to
make of it all. He kept his gaze upon his old friend the officer,
and waited for him to speak. The constable's face had turned crimson,
for he was beginning to suspect the truth.</p>

<p>"You have heard of the robbery of the post office at Rockledge,
Keyes?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I look for news of something of the kind every few days.
What has that to do with my young friends being in a position
that looks as if they are your prisoners?"</p>

<p>"Banet Raymond tells me that that robbery was done by three men
wearing yachting suits. These two are dressed that way and they
admit they had another chap with them, but he's run off, so I
arrested them on suspicion&mdash;what in thunder are you laughing at?"</p>

<p>Keyes Richards had thrown back his head and his laughter might
have been heard half a mile away. As soon as he could speak, he
said:</p>

<p>"So you took those two youngsters for burglars of the post office
at Rockledge! The joke is on you, Gabe, and I'll make sure all
your friends hear of it. Haw! haw! haw!"</p>

<p>The poor officer squirmed and asked sullenly:</p>

<p>"How should I know who they were? I never saw 'em before."</p>

<p>"You've had enough experience to judge a little by looks; your
own small amount of sense ought to tell you better than this."</p>

<p>"That's what I did go by. Don't you think that they look like
a couple of desperate criminals?"</p>

<p>And the officer turned his head, scrutinized the youth at his
side and then leaned over and squinted at Alvin, as if he saw
both for the first time. Chester felt sympathy for the man, and
waiting for Richards to recover from his renewed outburst said:</p>

<p>"We must be hard looking fellows, for every one in the crowd
who saw us leave Charmount agreed that we were a couple of villains."</p>

<p>"And one woman thought lynching wasn't too good for us."</p>

<p>"Well, Gabe, do you intend to carry them to Augusta?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, now that you vouch for them&mdash;unless they want
to go there," he added.</p>

<p>"Can you take us with you, Mr. Richards?"</p>

<p>"I am on my way to Charmount to board the boat for Boothbay.
I shall be glad to have your company."</p>

<p>"Have we your permission, officer?" asked Alvin, looking round
at their guardian, as he partly rose to his feet.</p>

<p>The constable was uneasy. Moving about in his seat, he asked:</p>

<p>"I say, young men, you haven't any hard feelings agin me?"</p>

<p>Keyes Richards overheard the question and his waggishness could
not be repressed.</p>

<p>"You boys have a clear case against Gabe; you ought to have no
trouble in soaking him for ten or twenty thousand dollars damages."</p>

<p>"Is that a fact?" asked Alvin, pausing in stepping from one car
to another, as if suddenly impressed by the idea.</p>

<p>"Gabe owns one of the finest farms in Lincoln county; you will
have no trouble at all to get it from him."</p>

<p>The officer would have been scared almost out of his wits had
he not caught the wink of Richards and the responsive smile of
Alvin. The sympathetic youth replied:</p>

<p>"It is all right, officer, though we should have felt different
if you had put those handcuffs on us. We have had a little fun
and don't mind it. Good-by."</p>

<p>Each boy shook hands with the grim fellow, who was vastly relieved
by their good will.</p>

<p>"You know we have to take chances now and then, but I always
try to do my duty regardless of consequences."</p>

<p>"You have a hard job before you, Gabe, but I hope you will win;
no one deserves it more," said Richards.</p>

<p>And the parties separated in the best of humor.</p>

<p>The run to Charmount was quickly made. Nearly all who saw the
departure of the officer with the prisoners witnessed their return
in the company of Keyes H. Richards, who was well known to nearly
everybody from Augusta to the mouth of the Kennebec. He saluted
a number of persons and the chauffeur who had brought him to that
point circled his machine about, and skimmed off after the fleeing
constable, who must have been many miles up the road by that time.</p>

<p>It was some minutes before the little group could understand
the turn of affairs. Alvin lifted his cap to the woman who had
thought that he and his companion deserved lynching and said:</p>

<p>"If you feel that we should be executed we are here to receive
our sentence."</p>

<p>She stared at the impudent youngster, sniffed and flirted away
without reply. The tennis player who insisted that the looks of
the lads proved their villainy did not at first quite grasp the
situation. He aimlessly patted his hip with his racquet and looked
and wondered. Alvin with his winsome grin addressed him:</p>

<p>"We are unlucky that our faces give us away, but it can't be
helped. The constable became so disgusted with us that he turned
his prisoners over to Mr. Richards."</p>

<p>"Does he know you?" asked the other unabashed.</p>

<p>"It looks that way, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt he was the third burglar who stuck up the Rockledge
post office. You are all tarred with the same stick. However,
I'll promise to drop in on you if they send you to Atlanta to
keep company with Uncle Sam's guests&mdash;for I intend to make a business
trip South next month."</p>

<p>"Are you sure it is solely on <em>business</em>?" was the pointed
inquiry of Chester.</p>

<p>"That is the present outlook, but if this post office robbing
industry picks up a little more, you and I might join hands and
whack up."</p>

<p>"Chester, we aren't making much here," said Alvin. "Suppose we
pay our respects to the pert young lady who rattles the telegraph
key."</p>

<p>They walked into the little building, while Richards stayed outside
and explained that the fathers of the boys owned about half the
city of New York and most of the railway lines westward to the
Rocky Mountains; that they would probably buy Southport, Squirrel,
Outer Heron and a number of other islands by the close of next
season; that their sons were two of the finest-grained young gentlemen
that had ever honored Maine with a visit; that young Landon was
the owner of the prettiest motor boat ever seen in those waters,
and that it was stolen exactly as they had described, and he was
going to give them all the help he could in recovering it. If
any one of his listeners wished to earn a handsome reward, all
he had to do was to find the boat. Suffice it to say, the story
of Mr. Richards made a sensation, and Alvin and Chester became
objects of profounder interest than when they were prisoners charged
with the crime of robbing a post office.</p>

<p>The young heroes never heard anything of these amazing yarns,
for they had entered the telegraph office to see the bright-eyed
operator who had had her fling at them. She glanced up from her
table as she finished clicking off a message, and remarked:</p>

<p>"Out on bail I suppose; the next thing no doubt, you will skip."</p>

<p>"Would you blame us?" asked Alvin. "The punishment for that sort
of thing is pretty severe."</p>

<p>"Ten or twenty years, I believe."</p>

<p>"Something like that, with considerable off for good behavior."</p>

<p>"You're not likely to get any allowance for <em>that</em>&mdash;there's
your boat!" she exclaimed, as the hoarse whistle of a steamer
sounded from the river. Alvin would have liked to make appropriate
reply to this irony, but really he had no time to think one up.
He and his chum hurried out, merely calling good-by to her.</p>
