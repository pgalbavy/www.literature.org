<p>Forgetting for a moment all else but the joy of his presence, she held
out both hands with a glad little cry.
</p><p>"Kearn!"
</p><p>He took her hands in his, but released them after the merest touch, and
in the hungry wistfulness of his gaze there was no answering gladness.
</p><p>"Miss Murdaugh, I have an explanation to make for my disobedience of
your injunction," he said stiffly.  "I have deliberately followed you
here, but it is only that I may put you in possession of certain facts
which are of moment to you.  Will you forgive me if I intrude upon you
for an hour?"
</p><p>The brightness faded, and she bowed her head in silence.  She had
forgotten his duplicity and the cold-blooded mercenary game he had
played, but the memory of it returned with his first words.
Passionately she wished that she might never have learned the truth!
He would have played the game to the last round, he would have been
kind at least, and she might have lived on in her fool's paradise.
Then a wave of contempt swept over her for her own cowardice and she
straightened.
</p><p>"I am very glad to see you."  Her tones were gravely conventional.  "If
you have followed me out here, as you say, to render me a service it
must be one for which I shall be deeply grateful, Mr. Thode.  I am
staying at the Palace Hotel and if you will walk there with me we can
talk, secure from intrusion.  How did you know I was here?"
</p><p>"Winthrop North told me of the sudden change in your plans for the
future, and that he knew where you had gone when you left the
Halsteads.  I made a hurried trip West and there discovered what I have
now to tell you."  He spoke slowly as if weighing each word.  "I went
back to New York to see you, but could only learn that you had
disappeared.  However, since you had not gone to Limasito, it occurred
to me that you must be here, in an attempt possibly to prove your
identity."
</p><p>"And what you have to tell me bears on that?" Willa asked.
</p><p>"It does, most conclusively.  Starr Wiley must have had a very vital
motive in getting you out of the way, for his story was a lie from
start to finish; his papers a deliberate forgery!"
</p><p>"If you have proof of that, Mr. Thode, you have indeed rendered me a
service I can never repay!" she cried.  "Once more I am in your debt!"
</p><p>"My news does not surprise you?" he asked, with a quick glance at her
face.
</p><p>"No.  I have suspected it from the moment Starr Wiley announced his
discovery, for he had threatened me with it in advance; had tried to
bargain with me, in fact."  Willa paused.  "I had intended to go on
from here to the Flathead Lake country in Montana and then to Arizona
in an effort to establish what you have discovered.  I am anxious to
know how you stumbled upon the truth."
</p><p>It was only when they had reached the little hotel sitting-room and
established themselves before the replenished stove that Kearn Thode
enlightened her.
</p><p>"You may remember, Miss Murdaugh, that I knew Starr Wiley before I met
him again in Limasito, and that knowledge alone would have impelled me
to distrust at sight any claims which he might produce, no matter what
their nature," he began.  "When Winthrop North told me that our friend
had been the means of proving you were not the granddaughter of Giles
Murdaugh, I doubted, and when I learned the name which Gentleman Geoff
was supposed to have signed to the adoption papers with the trapper, I
knew the whole thing was a frame-up.  Gentleman Geoff's name was not
Abercrombie."
</p><p>"How do you know that?" Willa asked, amazed.
</p><p>"He told me the truth himself, just a little while before he died,"
Thode responded.  "I gave him my word to keep his confidence, but now
in your interest I know that he would have me speak.  He was Geoffrey
Rendell, of a fine old family, university bred and with a brilliant
future before him, if he had so chosen.  I have traced as much of his
career as anyone can ever know now and I will never betray the reason
for his ultimate choice, but you may rest assured that his nickname was
no label of chance or whim.  He was a gentleman always in the truest,
finest sense of the word."
</p><p>"Nothing could ever make me doubt that for an instant," Willa said with
glowing eyes.  "There could have been nothing discreditable in his past
and he was a clean sportsman in the life he chose, square and
philosophical; a game loser, a generous winner!  Poor Dad!  Mr. Thode,
tell me how you succeeded in learning the truth."
</p><p>"When I was convinced that trickery was at work I persuaded Winthrop to
let me see and photograph the adoption agreement.  With that as a basis
I went straight to Pima, in Graham County, Arizona, where Frank
Hillery, the trapper, had died and Wiley professed to have run across
his papers.  Hillery died only seven or eight months ago, you know, and
it wasn't difficult to find out all about him.
</p><p>"He landed there in the spring of nineteen four, and opened a little
store with general merchandise.  He was still keeping it when he was
stricken with typhoid last year and died.  I readily found the widow
who had kept house for him all those years and interviewed his friends.
His long sojourn in the wilds evidently had their reaction when he
settled down in civilization once more, for he became exceedingly
garrulous, and his friends were familiar with every detail of his past
life.  His favorite narrative was of the coming of Gentleman Geoff with
you to his cabin; of the death of his own little daughter and of
Gentleman Geoff's long illness and subsequent gratitude and generosity
to him.  Your foster father, in recognition of his hospitality and
care, had given him sufficient money to start in business, and Hillery
never forgot it.  When he died he left no papers except a brief will,
and his old trunks and boxes remained undisturbed in the attic, until
about three months ago when a strange young man appeared in Pima."
</p><p>Thode paused and Willa caught her breath.  She had momentarily
forgotten the narrator himself in her interest in his story, and the
quick color came and went in her cheeks.  It seemed to the young
engineer that she bloomed like a splendid rose in the homely, bare
little room and the wistfulness deepened in his eyes, but he went on in
a sternly impersonal voice:
</p><p>"The man was Wiley, under an assumed name, of course.  He posed as a
nephew of the dead man, and when the beneficiaries found he had no
intention of attempting to dispute the will, being wealthy himself,
they gladly made friends with him and told him all they knew of his
late uncle.
</p><p>"Wiley went to board with the widow, and it seemed only natural that he
should want to go through his uncle's effects.  The widow gave him free
access to the attic, and it was there, in one of those boxes, that he
professed to find the packet of papers which he afterward produced.
Undoubtedly the marriage-certificate and the maps were genuine; only
the article of adoption had been added.  He left soon after, and
nothing further was known of him there.
</p><p>"When I learned that much, I, too, went to board with the widow and
learned every detail of Wiley's stay.  One of Hillery's oldest friends
had a son who had gone to the bad and was serving a term for highway
robbery in a prison near Phoenix.  I found that Wiley had taken a great
interest in the lad and paid him more than one visit, promising to use
his influence to have him pardoned.  I went to Phoenix, talked with
this prisoner and a few others, and incidentally looked over the
records.
</p><p>"I discovered that Wiley had interested himself particularly in an
ex-forger whose term had expired at about that period, and it was
understood that Wiley had provided him with a new start in life.  I
hunted up this man--it wasn't hard for he had bought a ranch and was
trying to go straight--and under threat of arrest obtained his written
confession.
</p><p>"The money for the fresh start was the price Wiley had paid for the
execution of the false document.  I have the confession here in my bag,
and I will show it to you later.  It is absolutely conclusive proof.
Miss Murdaugh, I may be an accessory after the fact, but I felt sure
you would not want the forger punished, and I gave him time to sell out
his ranch and disappear.  I am under the impression that he has gone to
Canada to enlist, and if so----"
</p><p>Willa shook her head.
</p><p>"No.  I don't believe he had any idea of the purpose to which the
document would be put, or its far-reaching effects, and if he has gone
to war, his punishment is on the knees of the gods."
</p><p>"Exactly.  He did not know.  The name of Murdaugh wasn't mentioned in
it if you remember, only those of Hillery and the supposed Abercrombie."
</p><p>"'Abercrombie!'" repeated Willa meditatively.  "I wonder how Wiley came
to add that?"
</p><p>"I finally solved that.  Wiley wanted to add clinching verisimilitude
to the document and took a long shot.  Like many another amateur
criminal, he overreached himself, and that one fact, you see, led to
the whole discovery.  He must have followed Gentleman Geoff's trail
through his wanderings from Topaz Gulch, seeking a loop-hole to prove
you were not the baby originally adopted, and when he came upon the
story which was told to him in Missoula, Montana, of Gentleman Geoff's
illness in the trapper's cabin on Flathead Lake, one can easily see how
the whole scheme popped into his head.  There were the two men and two
little girls of the same age, isolated far from civilization for a long
winter.  One child dies, the other departs with Gentleman Geoff.  What
more simple than to arrange for a plausible substitution of the
children?  Gentleman Geoff being dead, the only possible obstacle could
be in the person of the other member of that lonely quartette, Frank
Hillery, the trapper.  We know now how Wiley traced him and overcame
that difficulty.
</p><p>"Wiley's efforts culminated in Arizona, but mine only began there.  I
traced him back step by step on the trail he had come, following
Hillery, and in Missoula I learned more of Gentleman Geoff.  Wiley must
have learned there what I did, that Gentleman Geoff's last name was
known to be Abercrombie, but Wiley didn't investigate deeply enough.
</p><p>"I did.  I found that Gentleman Geoff Abercrombie had a most unsavory
name there as a crooked gambler and card-sharp----  No, Miss Murdaugh,
please don't protest!"
</p><p>Willa had turned upon him with flashing eyes.
</p><p>"He had operated several gambling-casinos for brief, abruptly
terminated periods in Idaho and Montana, keeping about two jumps ahead
of a lynching posse most of the time and was last heard of in New
Mexico five years ago, when the Blue Chip was in full blast in
Limasito.  In other words, there were two Gentleman Geoffs!  The second
must have been a cheap swindler and card-sharp, who learned of your
foster father's fame as a square gambler throughout the West and sought
to profit by it.  His operations were on such a small, petty scale,
however, that it is no wonder the story of his exploits never reached
the ears of the real Gentleman Geoff.  Your title to your name is
assured now, Miss Murdaugh."
</p><p>"And you have done all this for me!" Willa mused, then turned her level
direct gaze upon him.  "Why, Mr. Thode?"
</p><p>"Because I promised the man who brought you up and cared for you always
that I would do what I could to further the duty he had assumed and so
splendidly carried on," Thode responded simply.  "When he lay dying, he
told me that, although you yourself did not know it, you were of
different blood and caste from your associates in Limasito.  His own
words were that you were born a lady and must go back to your own."
</p><p>"Dad said that?"  Willa's lips quivered.  "I learned to-day that he was
in love with my mother always, and she had told him her whole story.  I
have found a friend here, too, Mr. Thode, a poor woman who is
frightfully maimed from saving my life in the fire which killed my
mother.  I--I have a scar from it which she recognized and so there is
another witness to my identity, but without the valuable proof you have
brought me I would still have found it almost impossible to offset the
evidence of that false document.  I cannot thank you for all that you
have done and I still cannot quite understand----"
</p><p>"It was for Gentleman Geoff," he reminded her courteously but coldly.
"I had given him my word and I meant to keep it to the utmost of my
ability.  My task, I think, is almost completed."
</p><p>Willa drew back, in wretched indecision.  If only it had not been for
that hideously betraying letter which Angie had put in her hands how
clear the way would be before her!  If the testimony offered of his
mercenary motives in making love to her had been verbal she would have
scorned it, no matter who swore to its truth, but his intent was made
plain in his own writing and could not be gainsaid.
</p><p>"You will not let me offer you my thanks," she murmured.  "But I am
indeed grateful.  Can we not at least be friends, Mr. Thode?  I--I
regret that bitter, angry letter I sent to you, but I had learned
something which hurt me deeply.  Won't you be magnanimous enough to
forget it and let us go on as if nothing had occurred?"
</p><p>"I shall be glad to be your friend and serve you in any way that I can,
Miss Murdaugh," he responded dryly.  "I have something further to tell
you which I think concerns you closely.  Are you aware that Starr Wiley
and his partner, Harrington Chase, have purchased from Tia Juana Reyes
the property known as the Lost Souls lease and are already issuing
stock and developing the well?"
</p><p>Willa rose slowly to her feet, staring at him as if she could not
believe the evidence of her own ears.
</p><p>"You--you cannot mean it!" she gasped.  "It cannot be true; there is a
mistake somewhere!  Please, say that again, Mr. Thode!"
</p><p>He told her all that he had learned in New York, and she listened
breathlessly, her varying color concentrated in two vivid burning spots
upon her cheeks.  A steady light deepened, too, in her eyes, and when
he had finished his story he looked at her in unconcealed amazement.
Far from being down-cast and distressed, she seemed to his
half-incredulous gaze to be triumphant, but she only remarked quietly:
</p><p>"This is news indeed, Mr. Thode, but it simplifies everything.  The
stakes I have played for since I left Limasito are in my hands at last.
I cannot explain now, but you will learn the whole truth very soon.
Starr Wiley and his partner are still in New York?"
</p><p>"No.  They have both gone down to Limasito, to inspect developments on
the well.  In the society column of a belated newspaper which reached
me yesterday, I read that two of the principal stock-holders, Mason
North and your cousin, Ripley Halstead, together with their families,
had gone also in a private car to Mexico.  You will return to New York
now, will you not?"
</p><p>Willa's eyes sparkled dangerously and she clenched her little hands.
</p><p>"I--I have some arrangements to make here; I must provide for Klondike
Kate's future, and obtain her deposition.  She was my mother's friend,
who recognized me.  Then, Mr. Thode, I shall leave, but not for New
York.  I, too, am going to Mexico!  I want to see the Lost Souls well
and learn from Tia Juana's own lips the story of its transfer."
</p><p>"I shall be down there myself," Thode announced, rising.  "If you
recall our conversation when we met again in New York you will remember
that I told you of my own ambition to find Tia Juana and try to obtain
possession of the Lost Souls lease.  You know how the map was stolen
from me in the beginning, but I am not sure yet that I have been
beaten?"
</p><p>"What do you mean?" Willa asked.  "And why do you think that your news
about the sale of the well concerns me closely?"
</p><p>"I have only one answer to both questions," rejoined Thode.  "Knowing
Starr Wiley, I believe that trickery and fraud are at the bottom of his
acquisition of the well, and it concerns you because your cousin,
Ripley Halstead, has invested a large part of your inheritance in it.
If fraud is connected with the transaction by which Wiley gained
possession of it, I mean to expose him on this count as well as his
conspiracy against you.  I had set my heart on the Lost Souls venture,
like an over-confident young fool!  I even wrote to my employer after
you had gone and I discovered that Tia Juana was Juana Reyes, the owner
of the Pool, that I had only to find her to win her consent----"
</p><p>"You wrote----what?"  Willa rose slowly to her feet, her rich color
ebbing.
</p><p>"I wrote that except for Trevino, the Mexican who sold her the lease,
no one there knew her real name, and it wouldn't matter to them if they
did.--They wouldn't have connected old Tia Juana, of that tumble-down
shack in the zapote grove, with the Juana Reyes who could afford to buy
the Trevino hacienda, you see.  I also said, if I remember, that she
was the undoubted owner of almost boundless wealth and when I had gone
after her and won her consent to selling a half-interest in the Pool
itself----"
</p><p>"Oh!" Willa cried, wincing as if he had struck her a blow.  "You wrote
that about Tia Juana!  And I--I--oh, how blind I was!  How wickedly,
cruelly blind!"
</p><p>"Now it is I who do not understand."  He shrugged.  "What does it
matter, anyway?  I never succeeded in finding Tia Juana or in something
else which was of even more moment to me.  Gentleman Geoff trusted me,
however, and I have fulfilled that trust.  Now I am free to take up my
own fight again."
</p><p>Willa held out her hand timidly.
</p><p>"You will allow me to wish you luck, even if I may not thank you?" she
asked.  "I--I have much to explain and you much to forgive, but we
shall meet again in Mexico."
</p><p>He bowed formally.
</p><p>"It appears to be inevitable.  Fate seems to compel me to ignore your
request that I obliterate myself from the scene," he added whimsically.
"I will try not to intrude upon you more than I must, however, Miss
Murdaugh."
</p><p>"Yes!" she responded softly.  "In spite of my blindness and your pride,
fate seems to have appointed you to the permanent job of knight-errant
to the maiden in distress, hasn't it, Mr. Duenna?"
</p><p>When the door had closed behind him, she stood quite still in the
middle of the floor where he had left her.  That letter, that
portentous letter which Angie had spitefully put into her willing,
credulous hands had referred to Tia Juana, not to herself.  How plain
it all was, now, and how ruthlessly, unjustly she had driven him from
her!  And he?  He had repaid her flouting of him by tireless devotion
and a measureless service!  Ah, but she would make amends!
</p><p>Then a whimsical, tender light flooded her face.  Cinderella had come
into her own again; the prince had found her and fitted on the slipper
just when she had been most sure that he had gone from her forever!  He
was a very haughty and hurt and angry prince, to be sure, but there had
been that in his eyes which told her that she might win him back
despite the bitter misunderstanding.  The old fairy tale was coming
true, after all!
