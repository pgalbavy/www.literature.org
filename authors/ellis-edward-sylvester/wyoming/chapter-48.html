<p>A most unexpected piece of good fortune had befallen our friends,
in the appearance of Dick Durkee, with his six sturdy companions,
all armed and ready for an encounter with the Tories and Iroquois.</p>

<p>Learning that young Fred Godfrey had been a lieutenant in the
Continental army, they insisted on putting themselves under him,
at least so long as they were engaged in hostilities.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the youth, "I will accept the responsibility,
because I know I have brave men to lead; but the work will be
short."</p>

<p>As every minute was precious, and there was no saying what form
of cruelty the captors of the fugitives might inflict, the plan
was speedily arranged.</p>

<p>The camp was so near, that they expected to reach it within ten
minutes, after which the question between them and the Senecas
would be decided in one-fifth of that time.</p>

<p>They were on the eve of starting in Indian file, when a furious
threshing was heard, and a panting form plunged directly among
them, stopping abruptly with an exclamation of fear, when he saw
the figures around him.</p>

<p>"Can any of you gentlemen tell me whether this is Wilkesbarre
or Stroudsburg?" he asked, recoiling as if uncertain whether he
was with friends or foes.</p>

<p>"Why, Habakkuk," said Godfrey in return; "why, are you in such
a hurry that you can't stop?"</p>

<p>"Well, well, well," muttered the terrified New Englander, recognizing
his friend; "I was on my way to Stroudsburg, and didn't expect
to meet you here, leftenant; what's up?"</p>

<p>"What has caused you to take such a sudden start?"</p>

<p>"I got the chance and I took it; I thought, from the rate I was
going, that I ought to be pretty well nigh there by this time."</p>

<p>"The journey is still before you; but, when I left the vicinity
of the camp, you were a prisoner."</p>

<p>Habakkuk was loath to explain the strange cause of his presence
in the woods, but, finding he was among friends, he finally told
the story.</p>

<p>His listeners of course were astonished, for it seemed incredible
that Jake Golcher should do anything of the kind.</p>

<p>"Since he sent you out to take me back," said Lieutenant Godfrey,
"you must keep your word and produce me before him."</p>

<p>"But, leftenant, such a pledge ain't binding on one, is it?"</p>

<p>"It is when I help you carry it out, and that is precisely what
I will do."</p>

<p>The New Englander was amazed, as well he might be, and Fred,
not wishing to trifle with the poor fellow, who had been so buffeted
by good and ill fortune during the day, explained how the plan
could be executed without risk to him.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that Habakkuk took kindly to the project, even
then, but in the presence of Durkee and his woodmen, he could
not well refuse.</p>

<p>He was assured that he would be well taken care of, and, as time
was valuable, the company started without delay.</p>

<p>Where every one understood the necessity of silence, they moved
along like so many phantoms.</p>

<p>Gravity Gimp's knowledge was so thorough, that even in the gloom,
relieved only now and then by a few beams of moonlight, he recognized
the landmarks, and gave great help to Godfrey, who more than once
was at fault.</p>

<p>After progressing in this labored manner for some distance they
came upon a well-beaten path, where it was much easier to travel
than in the unbroken wood.</p>

<p>They had not far to go, and were beginning to slacken their speed,
when all were startled by hearing some one approaching from the
front. Each man noiselessly stepped out of the path, and, with
their guns grasped, awaited the issue.</p>

<p>The first supposition was that they were Indians, and, excepting
through fear of complicating matters in camp, the strangers would
have been assailed at once.</p>

<p>But at the very moment the two forms, as they proved to be, were
immediately opposite, one of them was heard to speak:</p>

<p>"By gracious! Jim, this is the most dangerous latitude I ever
was in."</p>

<p>This expression identified them, and Fred spoke in a guarded
voice:</p>

<p>"Hold on, friends; don't be alarmed."</p>

<p>Naturally the strangers were frightened, and showed a disposition
to break into headlong flight, but Durkee and his comrades quickly
stepped into the path and surrounded them.</p>

<p>By the time this was done, the couple realized they were among
friends, and they made themselves known.</p>

<p>They were two men who were in the Wilkesbarre Fort during the
battle and massacre of the afternoon, and they had come up the
eastern shore of the river to learn whether they could be of any
help to the numerous fugitives at Wyoming.</p>

<p>They soon found it was too late to do much good, but they lingered
in the vicinity and exchanged shots with several parties of Tories
and Indians.</p>

<p>They prowled around after dark, when they saw matters going so
ill that they concluded there would be no safety in returning
to Wilkesbarre, where a panic had probably set in. They were now
on their way to Stroudsburg, which was a haven of hope to so many
fugitives in that flaming day and the following one.</p>

<p>They gladly agreed to join the rescuers, and, as each had a good
rifle and ammunition, they were a most desirable re-enforcement.</p>
