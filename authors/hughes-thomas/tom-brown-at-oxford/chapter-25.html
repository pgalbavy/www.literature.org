<p>The end of the academic year was now at hand, and Oxford was
beginning to put on her gayest clothing. The college gardeners
were in a state of unusual activity, and the lawns and flower-beds
which form such exquisite settings to many of the venerable grey,
gabled buildings, were as neat and as bright as hands could make
them. Cooks, butlers and their assistants were bestirring themselves
in kitchen and buttery, under the direction of bursars jealous
of the fame of their houses, in the preparation of the abundant
and solid fare with which Oxford is wont to entertain all comers.
Everything the best of its kind, no stint but no nonsense, seems
to be the wise rule which the University hands down and lives
up to in these matters. However we may differ as to her degeneracy
in other departments, all who have ever visited her will admit
that in this of hospitality she is still a great national teacher,
acknowledging and preaching by example the fact, that eating and
drinking are important parts of man's life, which are to be allowed
their due prominence, and not thrust into a corner, but are to
be done soberly and thankfully, in the sight of God and man. The
coaches were bringing in heavy loads of visitors; carriages of
all kinds were coming in from the neighbouring counties; and lodgings
in the High-street were going up to fabulous prices.</p>

<p>In one of these High-street lodgings, on the evening of the Saturday
before Commemoration, Miss Winter and her cousin are sitting.
They have been in Oxford during the greater part of the day, having
posted up from Englebourn; but they have only just come in, for
the younger lady is still in her bonnet, and Miss Winter's lies
on the table. The windows are wide open, and Miss Winter is sitting
at one of them; while her cousin is busied in examining the furniture
and decorations of their temporary home, now commenting upon these,
now pouring out praises of Oxford.</p>

<p>"Isn't it too charming? I never dreamt that any town could be
so beautiful. Don't you feel wild about it, Katie?"</p>

<p>"It is the queen of towns, dear. But I know it well, you see,
so that I can't be quite so enthusiastic as you."</p>

<p>"Oh, those dear gardens! what was the name of those ones with
the targets up, where they were shooting? Don't you remember?"</p>

<p>"New College Gardens, on the old city wall, you mean?"</p>

<p>"No, no. They were nice and sentimental. I should like to go
and sit and read poetry there. But I mean the big ones, the gorgeous,
princely ones, with wicked old Bishop Laud's gallery looking into
them."</p>

<p>"Oh! St. John's, of course."</p>

<p>"Yes, St. John's. Why do you hate Laud so, Katie?"</p>

<p>"I don't hate him, dear. He was a Berkshire man, you know. But
I think he did a great deal of harm to the Church."</p>

<p>"How did you think my new silk looked in the garden? How lucky
I brought it, wasn't it? I shouldn't have liked to have been in
nothing but muslin. They don't suit here; you want something richer
amongst the old buildings, and on the beautiful velvety turf of
the gardens. How do you think I looked?"</p>

<p>"You looked like a queen, dear; or a lady-in-waiting, at least."</p>

<p>"Yes, a lady-in-waiting on Henrietta Maria. Didn't you hear one
of the gentlemen say that she was lodged in St. John's when Charles
marched to relieve Gloucester? Ah! Can't you fancy her sweeping
about the gardens, with her ladies following her, and Bishop Laud
walking just a little behind her, and talking in a low voice about&mdash;let
me see&mdash;something very important?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary, where has your history gone? He was Archbishop, and
was safely locked up in the Tower."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps he was; then he couldn't be with her, of course.
How stupid of you to remember, Katie. Why can't you make up your
mind to enjoy yourself when you come out for a holiday?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't enjoy myself any the more for forgetting dates,"
said Katie, laughing.</p>

<p>"Oh, you would though; only try. But let me see, it can't be
Laud. Then it shall be that cruel drinking old man, with the wooden
leg made of gold, who was governor of Oxford when the king was
away. He must be hobbling along after the queen in a buff coat
and breastplate, holding his hat with a long drooping white feather
in his hand.</p>

<p>"But you wouldn't like it at all, Mary; it would be too serious
for you. The poor queen would be too anxious for gossip, and you
ladies-in-waiting would be obliged to walk after her without saying
a word."</p>

<p>"Yes, that would be stupid. But then she would have to go away
with the old governor to write dispatches; and some of the young
officers with long hair and beautiful lace sleeves, and large
boots, whom the king had left behind, wounded, might come and
walk perhaps, or sit in the sun in the quiet gardens."</p>

<p>Mary looked over her shoulder with the merriest twinkle in her
eye, to see how her steady cousin would take this last picture.
"The college authorities would never allow that," she said quietly,
still looking out the window; "if you wanted beaus, you must have
had them in black gowns."</p>

<p>"They would have been jealous of the soldiers, you think? Well,
I don't mind; the black gowns are very pleasant, only a little
stiff. But how do you think my bonnet looked.</p>

<p>"Charmingly, but when are you going to have done looking in the
glass? You don't care for the buildings, I believe, a bit. Come
and look at St. Mary's; there is such a lovely light on the steeple!"</p>

<p>"I'll come directly, but I must get these flowers right. I'm
sure there are too many in this trimming."</p>

<p>Mary was trying her new bonnet on over and over again before
the mantel-glass, and pulling out and changing the places of the
blush-rose buds with which it was trimmed. Just then a noise of
wheels, accompanied by a merry tune on a cornopean, came in from
the street.</p>

<p>"What's that, Katie?" she cried, stopping her work for a moment.</p>

<p>"A coach coming up from Magdalen Bridge. I think it is a cricketing
party coming home."</p>

<p>"Oh, let me see," and she tripped across to the window, bonnet
in hand, and stood beside her cousin. And, then, sure enough,
a coach covered with cricketers returning from a match drove past
the window. The young ladies looked out at first with great curiosity;
but, suddenly finding themselves the mark for a whole coach load
of male eyes, shrank back a little before the cricketers had passed
on towards the "Mitre." As the coach passed out of sight, Mary
gave a pretty toss of her head, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, they don't want for assurance, at any rate. I think they
needn't have stared so."</p>

<p>"It was our fault," said Katie; "we shouldn't have been at the
window. Besides, you know you are to be a lady-in-waiting on Henrietta
Maria up here, and of course you must get used to being stared
at."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, but that was to be by young gentlemen wounded in the
wars, in lace ruffles, as one sees them in pictures. That's a
very different thing from young gentlemen in flannel trousers
and straw hats, driving up the High street on coaches. I declare
one of them had the impudence to bow as if he knew you."</p>

<p>"So he does. That was my cousin."</p>

<p>"Your cousin! Ah, I remember. Then he must be my cousin, too."</p>

<p>"No, not at all. He is no relation of yours."</p>

<p>"Well I sha'n't break my heart. But is he a good partner?"</p>

<p>"I should say, yes. But I hardly know. We used to be a great
deal together as children, but papa has been such an invalid lately."</p>

<p>"Ah, I wonder how uncle is getting on at the Vice-Chancellor's.
Look, it is past eight by St. Mary's. When were we to go?"</p>

<p>"We were asked for nine."</p>

<p>"Then we must go and dress. Will it be very slow and stiff, Katie?
I wish we were going to something not quite so grand."</p>

<p>"You'll find it very pleasant, I dare say."</p>

<p>"There won't be any dancing, though, I know, will there?"</p>

<p>"No; I should think certainly not."</p>

<p>"Dear me! I hope there will be some young men there &mdash;I
shall be so shy, I know, if there are nothing but wise people.
How do you talk to a Regius Professor, Katie? It must be awful."</p>

<p>"He will probably be at least as uncomfortable as you, dear,"
said Miss Winter, laughing, and rising from the window; "let us
go and dress."</p>

<p>"Shall I wear my best gown? &mdash;What shall I put in my hair?"</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened, and the maid-servant introduced
Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>It was the St. Ambrose drag which had passed along shortly before,
bearing the eleven home from a triumphant match. As they came
over Magdalen Bridge, Drysdale, who had returned to Oxford as
a private gentleman after his late catastrophe, which he had managed
to keep a secret from his guardian, and was occupying his usual
place on the box, called out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, boys, keep your eyes open, there must be plenty of lionesses
about;" and thus warned, the whole load, including the cornopean
player, were on the look-out for lady visitors, profanely called
lionesses, all the way up the street. They had been gratified
by the sight of several walking in the High Street or looking
out of the windows, before they caught sight of Miss Winter and
her cousin. The appearance of these young ladies created a sensation.</p>

<p>"I say, look! up there in that first floor."</p>

<p>"By George, they're something like."</p>

<p>"The sitter for choice."</p>

<p>"No, no, the standing-up one; she looks so saucy."</p>

<p>"Hello, Brown, do you know them?"</p>

<p>"One of them is my cousin," said Tom, who had just been guilty
of the salutation which, as we saw, excited the indignation of
the younger lady.</p>

<p>"What luck! &mdash;You'll ask me to meet them&mdash;when shall it
be? To-morrow at breakfast, I vote."</p>

<p>"I say, you'll introduce me before the ball on Monday? promise
now," said another.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I shall see anything of them," said Tom; "I
shall just leave a pasteboard, but I'm not in the humour to be
dancing about lionizing."</p>

<p>A storm of indignation arose at this speech; the notion that
any of the fraternity who had any hold on lionesses, particularly
if they were pretty, should not use it to the utmost for the benefit
of the rest, and the glory and honor of the college, was revolting
to the undergraduate mind. So the whole body escorted Tom to the
door of the lodgings, impressing upon him the necessity of engaging
both his lionesses for every hour of every day in St. Ambrose's,
and left him not till they had heard him ask for the young ladies,
and seen him fairly on his way upstairs. They need not have taken
so much trouble, for in his secret soul he was no little pleased
at the appearance of creditable ladies, more or less belonging
to him, and would have found his way to see them quickly and surely
enough without any urging. Moreover, he had been really fond of
his cousin, years before, when they had been boy and girl together.</p>

<p>So they greeted one another very cordially, and looked one another
over as they shook hands, to see what changes time had made. He
makes his changes rapidly enough at that age, and mostly for the
better, as the two cousins thought. It was nearly three years
since they had met, and then he was a fifth-form boy and she a
girl in the school-room. They were both conscious of a strange
pleasure in meeting again, mixed with a feeling of shyness and
wonder whether they should be able to step back into their old
relations.</p>

<p>Mary looked on demurely, really watching them, but ostensibly
engaged on the rosebud trimming. Presently Miss Winter turned
to her and said, "I don't think you two ever met before; I must
introduce you, I suppose;&mdash;my cousin Tom, my cousin Mary."</p>

<p>"Then we must be cousins, too," said Tom, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"No, Katie says not," she answered.</p>

<p>"I don't mean to believe her, then," said Tom; "but what are
you going to do now, to-night? Why didn't you write and tell me
you were coming?"</p>

<p>"We have been so shut up lately, owing to papa's bad health,
that I really had almost forgotten that you were at Oxford."</p>

<p>"By the bye," said Tom, "where is uncle?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he is dining at the Vice-Chancellor's, who is an old college
friend of his. We have only been up here three or four hours,
and it has done him so much good. I am so glad we spirited him
up to coming."</p>

<p>"You haven't made any engagements yet, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Indeed we have; I can't tell how many. We came in time for luncheon
in Balliol. Mary and I made it our dinner, and we have been seeing
sights ever since, and have been asked to go to I don't know how
many luncheons and breakfasts."</p>

<p>"What, with a lot of dons, I suppose?" said Tom, spitefully;
"you won't enjoy Oxford, then; they'll bore you to death."</p>

<p>"There now, Katie; that is just what I was afraid of," joined
in Mary; "you remember we didn't hear a word about balls all the
afternoon."</p>

<p>"You haven't got your tickets for the balls, then?" said Tom,
brightening up.</p>

<p>"No, how shall we get them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can manage that, I've no doubt."</p>

<p>"Stop; how are we to go? Papa will never take us."</p>

<p>"You needn't think about that; anybody will chaperone you. Nobody
cares about that sort of thing at Commemoration."</p>

<p>"Indeed I think you had better wait till I have talked to papa."</p>

<p>"Then all the tickets will be gone," said Tom. "You must go.
Why shouldn't I chaperone you? I know several men whose sisters
are going with them."</p>

<p>"No, that will scarcely do, I'm afraid. But really, Mary, we
must go and dress."</p>

<p>"Where are you going, then?" said Tom.</p>

<p>"To an evening party at the Vice-Chancellor's; we are asked for
nine o'clock, and the half hour has struck."</p>

<p>"Hang the dons; how unlucky that I didn't know before! Have you
any flowers, by the way?"</p>

<p>"Not one."</p>

<p>"Then I will try to get you some by the time you are ready. May
I?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, pray, do," said Mary. "That's capital, Katie, isn't
it? Now I shall have some thing to put in my hair; I couldn't
think what I was to wear."</p>

<p>Tom took a look at the hair in question, and then left them and
hastened out to scour the town for flowers, as if his life depended
on success. In the morning he would probably have resented as
insulting, or laughed at as wildly improbable, the suggestion
that he would be so employed before night.</p>

<p>A double chair was drawn up opposite the door when he came back,
and the ladies were coming down into the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"Oh look, Katie! What lovely flowers! How very kind of you."</p>

<p>Tom surrendered as much of his burden as that young lady's little
round white hands could clasp, to her, and deposited the rest
on the table.</p>

<p>"Now, Katie, which shall I wear&mdash;this beautiful white rose all
by itself, or a wreath of these pansies? Here, I have a wire;
I can make them up in a minute." She turned to the glass, and
held the rich cream-white rose against her hair, and then turning
on Tom, added, "What do you think?"</p>

<p>"I thought fern would suit your hair better than anything else,"
said Tom; "and so I got these leaves," and he picked out two slender
fern-leaves.</p>

<p>"How very kind of you! Let me see, how do you mean? Ah! I see;
it will be charming;" and so saying, she held the leaves one in
each hand to the sides of her head, and then floated about the
room for needle and thread, and with a few nimble stitches fastened
together the simple green crown, which her cousin put on for her,
making the points meet above her forehead. Mary was wild with
delight at the effect, and full of thanks to Tom as he helped
them hastily to tie up bouquets, and then, amidst much laughing,
they squeezed into the wheel chair together (as the fashions of
that day allowed two young ladies to do), and went off to their
party, leaving a last injuction on him to go up and put the rest
of the flowers in water, and to call directly after breakfast
the next day.</p>

<p>He obeyed his orders, and pensively arranged the rest of the
flowers in the china ornaments on the mantle-piece, and in a soup
plate which he got and placed in the middle of the table, and
then spent some minutes examining a pair of gloves and other small
articles of women's gear which lay scattered about the room. The
gloves particularly attracted him, and he flattened them out and
laid them on his own large brown hand, and smiled at the contrast,
and took further unjustifiable liberties with them; after which
he returned to college and endured much banter as to the time
his call had lasted, and promised to engage his cousins as he
called them, to grace some festivities in St. Ambrose's at their
first spare moment.</p>

<p>The next day, being Show Sunday, was spent by the young ladies
in a ferment of spiritual and other dissipation. They attended
morning service at eight at the cathedral; breakfasted at a Merton
fellow's, from whence they adjourned to University sermon. Here
Mary, after two or three utterly ineffectual attempts to understand
what the preacher was meaning, soon relapsed into an examination
of the bonnets present, and the doctors and proctors on the floor,
and the undergraduates in the gallery. On the whole, she was,
perhaps, better employed than her cousin, who knew enough of religious
party strife to follow the preacher, and was made very uncomfortable
by his discourse, which consisted of an attack upon the recent
publications of the most eminent and best men in the University.
Poor Miss Winter came away with a vague impression of the wickedness
of all persons who dare to travel out of beaten tracks, and that
the most unsafe state of mind in the world is that which inquires
and aspires, and cannot be satisfied with the regulation draught
of spiritual doctors in high places. Being naturally of a reverent
turn of mind, she tried to think that the discourse had done her
good. At the same time she was somewhat troubled by the thought
that somehow the best men in all times of which she had read seemed
to her to be just those whom the preacher was in fact denouncing,
although in words he had praised them as the great lights of the
Church. The words which she had heard in one of the lessons kept
running in her head, "Truly ye bear witness that ye do allow the
deeds of your fathers, for they indeed killed them, but ye build
their sepulchres." But she had little leisure to think on the
subject, and, as her father praised the sermon as a noble protest
against the fearful tendencies of the day to Popery and Pantheism,
smothered the questionings of her own heart as well as she could,
and went off to luncheon in a common room; after which her father
retired to their lodgings, and she and her cousin were escorted
to afternoon service at Magdalen, in achieving which last feat
they had to encounter a crush only to be equaled by that at the
pit entrance to the opera on a Jenny Lind night. But what will
not a delicately nurtured British lady go through when her mind
is bent either on pleasure or duty?</p>

<p>Poor Tom's feelings throughout the day may be more easily conceived
than described. He had called according to order, and waited at
their lodgings after breakfast. Of course they did not arrive.
He had caught a distant glimpse of them in St. Mary's, but had
not been able to approach. He had called again in the afternoon
unsuccessfully, so far as seeing them was concerned; but he had
found his uncle at home, lying upon the sofa. At first he was
much dismayed by this rencontre, but, recovering his presence
mind, he proceeded, I regret to say, to take the length of the
old gentleman's foot, by entering into a minute and sympathizing
in quiry into the state of his health. Tom had no faith whatever
in his uncle's ill-health, and believed&mdash;as many persons of robust
constitution are too apt to do when brought face to face with
nervous patients&mdash;that he might shake off the whole of his maladies
at any time by a resolute effort, so that his sympathy was all
a sham, though, perhaps, one may pardon it, considering the end
in view, which was that of persuading the old gentleman to entrust
the young ladies to his nephew's care for that evening in the
Long Walk; and generally to look upon his nephew, Thomas Brown,
as his natural prop and supporter in the University, whose one
object in life just now would be to take trouble off his hands,
and who was of that rare and precocious steadiness of character
that he might be as safely trusted as a Spanish duenna. To a very
considerable extent the victim fell into the toils. He had many
old friends at the colleges, and was very fond of good dinners,
and long sittings afterwards. This very evening he was going to
dine at St. John's, and had been much troubled at the idea of
having to leave the unrivalled old port of that learned house
to escort his daughter and niece to the Long Walk. Still he was
too easy and good-natured not to wish that they might get there,
and did not like the notion of their going with perfect strangers.
Here was a compromise. His nephew was young, but still he was
a near relation, and in fact it gave the poor old man a plausible
excuse for not exerting himself as he felt he ought to do, which
was all he ever required for shifting his responsibilities and
duties upon other shoulders.</p>

<p>So Tom waited quietly till the young ladies came home, which
they did just before hall-time. Mr. Winter was getting impatient.
As soon as they arrived he started for St. John's, after advising
them to remain at home for the evening, as they looked quite tired
and knocked up; but if they resolved to go to the Long Walk, his
nephew would escort them.</p>

<p>"How can Uncle Robert say we look so tired?" said Mary, consulting
the glass on the subject; "I feel quite fresh. Of course, Katie,
you mean to go to the Long Walk?"</p>

<p>"I hope you will go," said Tom; "I think you owe me some amends.
I came here according to order this morning, and you were not
in, and I have been trying to catch you ever since."</p>

<p>"We couldn't help it," said Miss Winter; "indeed we have not
had a minute to ourselves all day. I was very sorry to think that
we should have brought you here for nothing this morning."</p>

<p>"But about the Long Walk, Katie?"</p>

<p>"Well, don't you think we have done enough for to-day? I should
like to have tea and sit quietly at home, as papa suggested."</p>

<p>"Do you feel very tired, dear?" said Mary, seating herself by
her cousin on the sofa, and taking her hand.</p>

<p>"No, dear, I only want a little quiet and a cup of tea."</p>

<p>"Then let us stay here quietly till it is time to start. When
ought we to get to the Long Walk?"</p>

<p>"About half-past seven," said Tom; "you shouldn't be much later
than that."</p>

<p>"There you see, Katie, we shall have two hours' perfect rest.
You shall lie upon the sofa, and I will read to you, and then
we shall go on all fresh again."</p>

<p>Miss Winter smiled and said, "Very well." She saw that her cousin
was bent on going, and she could deny her nothing.</p>

<p>"May I send you in anything from college?" said Tom; "you ought
to have something more than tea, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Oh no, thank you. We dined in the middle of the day."</p>

<p>"Then I may call you about seven o'clock," said Tom, who had
come unwillingly to the conclusion that he had better leave them
for the present.</p>

<p>"Yes, and mind you come in good time; we mean to see the whole
sight, remember. We are country cousins."</p>

<p>"You must let me call you cousin then, just for the look of the
thing."</p>

<p>"Certainly, just for the look of the thing, we will be cousins
till further notice."</p>

<p>"Well, you and Tom seem to get on together, Mary," said Miss
Winter, as they heard the front door close. "I'm learning a lesson
from you, though I doubt whether I shall ever be able to put it
in practice. What a blessing it must be not to be shy!"</p>

<p>"Are you shy, then?" said Mary, looking at her cousin with a
playful loving smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, dreadfully. It is positive pain to me to walk into a room
where there are people I do not know."</p>

<p>"But I feel that too. I'm sure, now, you were much less embarrassed
than I last night at the Vice Chancellor's. I quite envied you,
you seemed so much at your ease."</p>

<p>"Did I? I would have given anything to be back here quietly.
But it is not the same thing with you. You have no real shyness,
or you would never have got on so fast with my cousin."</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't feel at all shy with him," said Mary, laughing.
"How lucky it is that he found us out so soon. I like him so much.
There is a sort of way about him, as if he couldn't help himself.
I am sure one could turn him round one's finger. Don't you think
so?"</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that. But he always was soft-hearted, poor
boy. But he isn't a boy any longer. You must take care, Mary.
Shall we ring for tea?"</p>
