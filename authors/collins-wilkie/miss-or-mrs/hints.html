<h3>First Hint</h3>

(Derived from Lady Winwood's Card-Rack.)
<P>
"Sir Joseph Graybrooke and Miss Graybrooke request the honor of
Lord and Lady Winwood's company to dinner, on Wednesday, February
10, at half-past seven o'clock. To meet Mr. and Mrs. Launcelot
Linzie on their return."

<h3>Second Hint</h3
<P>
(Derived from a recent Money Article in morning Newspaper.)
<P>
"We are requested to give the fullest contradiction to
unfavorable rumors lately in circulation respecting the firm of
Pizzituti, Turlington, and Branca. Some temporary derangement in
the machinery of the business was undoubtedly produced in
consequence of the sudden death of the lamented managing partner,
Mr. Turlington, by the accidental discharge of a revolver which
he was examining. Whatever temporary obstacles may have existed
are now overcome. We are informed, on good authority, that the
well-known house of Messrs. Bulpit Brothers has an interest in
the business, and will carry it on until further notice."
