<p>On a late-summer evening in New York the atmosphere surrounding a
certain corner table at Shandy's cheap restaurant in Fourteenth Street
was stirred by a sense of excitement.
</p><p>The corner table in question was the favourite meeting place of a group
of young men of the G. Selden type, who usually took possession of it at
dinner time--having decided that Shandy's supplied more decent food
for fifty cents, or even for twenty-five, than was to be found at other
places of its order. Shandy's was “about all right,” they said to each
other, and patronised it accordingly, three or four of them generally
dining together, with a friendly and adroit manipulation of “portions”
 and “half portions” which enabled them to add variety to their bill of
fare.
</p><p>The street outside was lighted, the tide of passers-by was less full and
more leisurely in its movements than it was during the seething, working
hours of daylight, but the electric cars swung past each other with
whiz and clang of bell almost unceasingly, their sound being swelled, at
short intervals, by the roar and rumbling rattle of the trains dashing
by on the elevated railroad. This, however, to the frequenters of
Shandy's, was the usual accompaniment of every-day New York life and was
regarded as a rather cheerful sort of thing.
</p><p>This evening the four claimants of the favourite corner table had met
together earlier than usual. Jem Belter, who “hammered” a typewriter at
Schwab's Brewery, Tom Wetherbee, who was “in a downtown office,” Bert
Johnson, who was “out for the Delkoff,” and Nick Baumgarten, who having
for some time “beaten” certain streets as assistant salesman for the
same illustrious machine, had been recently elevated to a “territory” of
his own, and was therefore in high spirits.
</p><p>“Say!” he said. “Let's give him a fine dinner. We can make it between
us. Beefsteak and mushrooms, and potatoes hashed brown. He likes them.
Good old G. S. I shall be right glad to see him. Hope foreign travel has
not given him the swell head.”
</p><p>“Don't believe it's hurt him a bit. His letter didn't sound like it.
Little Georgie ain't a fool,” said Jem Belter.
</p><p>Tom Wetherbee was looking over the letter referred to. It had been
written to the four conjointly, towards the termination of Selden's
visit to Mr. Penzance. The young man was not an ardent or fluent
correspondent; but Tom Wetherbee was chuckling as he read the epistle.
</p><p>“Say, boys,” he said, “this big thing he's keeping back to tell us when
he sees us is all right, but what takes me is old George paying a visit
to a parson. He ain't no Young Men's Christian Association.”
</p>
<p>Bert Johnson leaned forward, and looked at the address on the letter
paper.
</p><p>“Mount Dunstan Vicarage,” he read aloud. “That looks pretty swell,
doesn't it?” with a laugh. “Say, fellows, you know Jepson at the office,
the chap that prides himself on reading such a lot? He said it reminded
him of the names of places in English novels. That Johnny's the biggest
snob you ever set your tooth into. When I told him about the lord fellow
that owns the castle, and that George seemed to have seen him, he nearly
fell over himself. Never had any use for George before, but just you
watch him make up to him when he sees him next.”
</p><p>People were dropping in and taking seats at the tables. They were all of
one class. Young men who lived in hall bedrooms. Young women who worked
in shops or offices, a couple here and there, who, living far uptown,
had come to Shandy's to dinner, that they might go to cheap seats in
some theatre afterwards. In the latter case, the girls wore their best
hats, had bright eyes, and cheeks lightly flushed by their sense of
festivity. Two or three were very pretty in their thin summer dresses
and flowered or feathered head gear, tilted at picturesque angles over
their thick hair. When each one entered the eyes of the young men at the
corner table followed her with curiosity and interest, but the glances
at her escort were always of a disparaging nature.
</p><p>“There's a beaut!” said Nick Baumgarten. “Get onto that pink stuff
on her hat, will you. She done it because it's just the colour of her
cheeks.”
</p><p>They all looked, and the girl was aware of it, and began to laugh and
talk coquettishly to the young man who was her companion.
</p><p>“I wonder where she got Clarence?” said Jem Belter in sarcastic allusion
to her escort. “The things those lookers have fastened on to them gets
ME.”
</p><p>“If it was one of US, now,” said Bert Johnson. Upon which they broke
into simultaneous good-natured laughter.
</p><p>“It's queer, isn't it,” young Baumgarten put in, “how a fellow always
feels sore when he sees another fellow with a peach like that? It's just
straight human nature, I guess.”
</p><p>The door swung open to admit a newcomer, at the sight of whom Jem Belter
exclaimed joyously: “Good old Georgie! Here he is, fellows! Get on to
his glad rags.”
</p><p>“Glad rags” is supposed to buoyantly describe such attire as, by its
freshness or elegance of style, is rendered a suitable adornment for
festive occasions or loftier leisure moments. “Glad rags” may mean
evening dress, when a young gentleman's wardrobe can aspire to splendour
so marked, but it also applies to one's best and latest-purchased garb,
in contradistinction to the less ornamental habiliments worn every day,
and designated as “office clothes.”
</p><p>G. Selden's economies had not enabled him to give himself into the hands
of a Bond Street tailor, but a careful study of cut and material, as
spread before the eye in elegant coloured illustrations in the windows
of respectable shops in less ambitious quarters, had resulted in the
purchase of a well-made suit of smart English cut. He had a nice young
figure, and looked extremely neat and tremendously new and clean, so
much so, indeed, that several persons glanced at him a little admiringly
as he was met half way to the corner table by his friends.
</p><p>“Hello, old chap! Glad to see you. What sort of a voyage? How did you
leave the royal family? Glad to get back?”
</p><p>They all greeted him at once, shaking hands and slapping him on the
back, as they hustled him gleefully back to the corner table and made
him sit down.
</p><p>“Say, garsong,” said Nick Baumgarten to their favourite waiter, who came
at once in answer to his summons, “let's have a porterhouse steak, half
the size of this table, and with plenty of mushrooms and potatoes hashed
brown. Here's Mr. Selden just returned from visiting at Windsor Castle,
and if we don't treat him well, he'll look down on us.”
</p><p>G. Selden grinned. “How have you been getting on, Sam?” he said, nodding
cheerfully to the man. They were old and tried friends. Sam knew all
about the days when a fellow could not come into Shandy's at all, or
must satisfy his strong young hunger with a bowl of soup, or coffee and
a roll. Sam did his best for them in the matter of the size of portions,
and they did their good-natured utmost for him in the affair of the
pooled tip.
</p><p>“Been getting on as well as can be expected,” Sam grinned back. “Hope
you had a fine time, Mr. Selden?”
</p><p>“Fine! I should smile! Fine wasn't in it,” answered Selden. “But I'm
looking forward to a Shandy porterhouse steak, all the same.”
</p><p>“Did they give you a better one in the Strawnd?” asked Baumgarten, in
what he believed to be a correct Cockney accent.
</p><p>“You bet they didn't,” said Selden. “Shandy's takes a lot of beating.”
 That last is English.
</p><p>The people at the other tables cast involuntary glances at them. Their
eager, hearty young pleasure in the festivity of the occasion was a
healthy thing to see. As they sat round the corner table, they produced
the effect of gathering close about G. Selden. They concentrated their
combined attention upon him, Belter and Johnson leaning forward on their
folded arms, to watch him as he talked.
</p><p>“Billy Page came back in August, looking pretty bum,” Nick Baumgarten
began. “He'd been painting gay Paree brick red, and he'd spent more
money than he'd meant to, and that wasn't half enough. Landed dead
broke. He said he'd had a great time, but he'd come home with rather a
dark brown taste in his mouth, that he'd like to get rid of.”
</p><p>“He thought you were a fool to go off cycling into the country,” put in
Wetherbee, “but I told him I guessed that was where he was 'way off. I
believed you'd had the best time of the two of you.”
</p><p>“Boys,” said Selden, “I had the time of my life.” He said it almost
solemnly, and laid his hand on the table. “It was like one of those
yarns Bert tells us. Half the time I didn't believe it, and half the
time I was ashamed of myself to think it was all happening to me and
none of your fellows were in it.”
</p><p>“Oh, well,” said Jem Belter, “luck chases some fellows, anyhow. Look at
Nick, there.”
</p><p>“Well,” Selden summed the whole thing up, “I just FELL into it where
it was so deep that I had to strike out all I knew how to keep from
drowning.”
</p><p>“Tell us the whole thing,” Nick Baumgarten put in; “from beginning to
end. Your letter didn't give anything away.”
</p><p>“A letter would have spoiled it. I can't write letters anyhow. I wanted
to wait till I got right here with you fellows round where I could
answer questions. First off,” with the deliberation befitting such an
opening, “I've sold machines enough to pay my expenses, and leave some
over.”
</p><p>“You have? Gee whiz! Say, give us your prescription. Glad I know you,
Georgy!”
</p><p>“And who do you suppose bought the first three?” At this point, it
was he who leaned forward upon the table--his climax being a thing to
concentrate upon. “Reuben S. Vanderpoel's daughter--Miss Bettina! And,
boys, she gave me a letter to Reuben S., himself, and here it is.”
</p><p>He produced a flat leather pocketbook and took an envelope from an inner
flap, laying it before them on the tablecloth. His knowledge that they
would not have believed him if he had not brought his proof was founded
on everyday facts. They would not have doubted his veracity, but
the possibility of such delirious good fortune. What they would have
believed would have been that he was playing a hilarious joke on
them. Jokes of this kind, but not of this proportion, were common
entertainments.
</p><p>Their first impulse had been towards an outburst of laughter, but even
before he produced his letter a certain truthful seriousness in his look
had startled them. When he laid the envelope down each man caught his
breath. It could not be denied that Jem Belter turned pale with emotion.
Jem had never been one of the lucky ones.
</p><p>“She let me read it,” said G. Selden, taking the letter from its
envelope with great care. “And I said to her: 'Miss Vanderpoel, would
you let me just show that to the boys the first night I go to Shandy's?'
I knew she'd tell me if it wasn't all right to do it. She'd know I'd
want to be told. And she just laughed and said: 'I don't mind at all. I
like “the boys.” Here is a message to them. “Good luck to you all.”'”
</p><p>“She said that?” from Nick Baumgarten.
</p><p>“Yes, she did, and she meant it. Look at this.”
</p><p>This was the letter. It was quite short, and written in a clear,
definite hand.
</p>
<p>“DEAR FATHER: This will be brought to you by Mr. G. Selden, of whom I
have written to you. Please be good to him.
</p><p>“Affectionately,
</p><p><strong>“BETTY.”</strong>
</p>
<p>Each young man read it in turn. None of them said anything just at
first. A kind of awe had descended upon them--not in the least awe of
Vanderpoel, who, with other multi-millionaires, were served up each week
with cheerful neighbourly comment or equally neighbourly disrespect, in
huge Sunday papers read throughout the land--but awe of the unearthly
luck which had fallen without warning to good old G. S., who lived like
the rest of them in a hall bedroom on ten per, earned by tramping the
streets for the Delkoff.
</p><p>“That girl,” said G. Selden gravely, “that girl is a winner from
Winnersville. I take off my hat to her. If it's the scheme that some
people's got to have millions, and others have got to sell Delkoffs,
that girl's one of those that's entitled to the millions. It's all right
she should have 'em. There's no kick coming from me.”
</p><p>Nick Baumgarten was the first to resume wholly normal condition of mind.
</p><p>“Well, I guess after you've told us about her there'll be no kick
coming from any of us. Of course there's something about you that royal
families cry for, and they won't be happy till they get. All of us boys
knows that. But what we want to find out is how you worked it so that
they saw the kind of pearl-studded hairpin you were.”
</p><p>“Worked it!” Selden answered. “I didn't work it. I've got a good bit of
nerve, but I never should have had enough to invent what happened--just
HAPPENED. I broke my leg falling off my bike, and fell right into
a whole bunch of them--earls and countesses and viscounts and
Vanderpoels. And it was Miss Vanderpoel who saw me first lying on the
ground. And I was in Stornham Court where Lady Anstruthers lives--and
she used to be Miss Rosalie Vanderpoel.”
</p><p>“Boys,” said Bert Johnson, with friendly disgust, “he's been up to his
neck in 'em.”
</p><p>“Cheer up. The worst is yet to come,” chaffed Tom Wetherbee.
</p><p>Never had such a dinner taken place at the corner table, or, in fact,
at any other table at Shandy's. Sam brought beefsteaks, which were
princely, mushrooms, and hashed brown potatoes in portions whose
generosity reached the heart. Sam was on good terms with Shandy's
carver, and had worked upon his nobler feelings. Steins of lager beer
were ventured upon. There was hearty satisfying of fine hungers. Two of
the party had eaten nothing but one “Quick Lunch” throughout the day,
one of them because he was short of time, the other for economy's
sake, because he was short of money. The meal was a splendid thing. The
telling of the story could not be wholly checked by the eating of food.
It advanced between mouthfuls, questions being asked and details given
in answers. Shandy's became more crowded, as the hour advanced. People
all over the room cast interested looks at the party at the corner
table, enjoying itself so hugely. Groups sitting at the tables nearest
to it found themselves excited by the things they heard.
</p><p>“That young fellow in the new suit has just come back from Europe,” said
a man to his wife and daughter. “He seems to have had a good time.”
</p><p>“Papa,” the daughter leaned forward, and spoke in a low voice, “I heard
him say 'Lord Mount Dunstan said Lady Anstruthers and Miss Vanderpoel
were at the garden party.' Who do you suppose he is?”
</p><p>“Well, he's a nice young fellow, and he has English clothes on, but he
doesn't look like one of the Four Hundred. Will you have pie or vanilla
ice cream, Bessy?”
</p><p>Bessy--who chose vanilla ice cream--lost all knowledge of its flavour
in her absorption in the conversation at the next table, which she could
not have avoided hearing, even if she had wished.
</p><p>“She bent over the bed and laughed--just like any other nice girl--and
she said, 'You are at Stornham Court, which belongs to Sir Nigel
Anstruthers. Lady Anstruthers is my sister. I am Miss Vanderpoel.' And,
boys, she used to come and talk to me every day.”
</p><p>“George,” said Nick Baumgarten, “you take about seventy-five bottles of
Warner's Safe Cure, and rub yourself all over with St. Jacob's Oil. Luck
like that ain't HEALTHY!”
</p><p>. . . . .
</p><p>Mr. Vanderpoel, sitting in his study, wore the interestedly grave look
of a man thinking of absorbing things. He had just given orders that a
young man who would call in the course of the evening should be brought
to him at once, and he was incidentally considering this young man, as
he reflected upon matters recalled to his mind by his impending
arrival. They were matters he had thought of with gradually increasing
seriousness for some months, and they had, at first, been the result of
the letters from Stornham, which each “steamer day” brought. They had
been of immense interest to him--these letters. He would have found them
absorbing as a study, even if he had not deeply loved Betty. He read in
them things she did not state in words, and they set him thinking.
</p><p>He was not suspected by men like himself of concealing an imagination
beneath the trained steadiness of his exterior, but he possessed more
than the world knew, and it singularly combined itself with powers of
logical deduction.
</p><p>If he had been with his daughter, he would have seen, day by day, where
her thoughts were leading her, and in what direction she was developing,
but, at a distance of three thousand miles, he found himself asking
questions, and endeavouring to reach conclusions. His affection for
Betty was the central emotion of his existence. He had never told
himself that he had outgrown the kind and pretty creature he had married
in his early youth, and certainly his tender care for her and pleasure
in her simple goodness had never wavered, but Betty had given him a
companionship which had counted greatly in the sum of his happiness.
Because imagination was not suspected in him, no one knew what she stood
for in his life. He had no son; he stood at the head of a great
house, so to speak--the American parallel of what a great house is in
non-republican countries. The power of it counted for great things, not
in America alone, but throughout the world. As international intimacies
increased, the influence of such houses might end in aiding in the
making of history. Enormous constantly increasing wealth and huge
financial schemes could not confine their influence, but must reach far.
The man whose hand held the lever controlling them was doing well when
he thought of them gravely. Such a man had to do with more than his own
mere life and living. This man had confronted many problems as the years
had passed. He had seen men like himself die, leaving behind them the
force they had controlled, and he had seen this force--controlled no
longer--let loose upon the world, sometimes a power of evil, sometimes
scattering itself aimlessly into nothingness and folly, which wrought
harm. He was not an ambitious man, but--perhaps because he was not
only a man of thought, but a Vanderpoel of the blood of the first
Reuben--these were things he did not contemplate without restlessness.
When Rosy had gone away and seemed lost to them, he had been glad when
he had seen Betty growing, day by day, into a strong thing. Feminine
though she was, she sometimes suggested to him the son who might have
been his, but was not. As the closeness of their companionship increased
with her years, his admiration for her grew with his love. Power left in
her hands must work for the advancement of things, and would not be idly
disseminated--if no antagonistic influence wrought against her. He had
found himself reflecting that, after all was said, the marriage of such
a girl had a sort of parallel in that of some young royal creature,
whose union might make or mar things, which must be considered. The man
who must inevitably strongly colour her whole being, and vitally mark
her life, would, in a sense, lay his hand upon the lever also. If he
brought sorrow and disorder with him, the lever would not move steadily.
Fortunes such as his grow rapidly, and he was a richer man by millions
than he had been when Rosalie had married Nigel Anstruthers. The memory
of that marriage had been a painful thing to him, even before he
had known the whole truth of its results. The man had been a common
adventurer and scoundrel, despite the facts of good birth and the air of
decent breeding. If a man who was as much a scoundrel, but cleverer--it
would be necessary that he should be much cleverer--made the best of
himself to Betty----! It was folly to think one could guess what a
woman--or a man, either, for that matter--would love. He knew Betty, but
no man knows the thing which comes, as it were, in the dark and claims
its own--whether for good or evil. He had lived long enough to see
beautiful, strong-spirited creatures do strange things, follow strange
gods, swept away into seas of pain by strange waves.
</p><p>“Even Betty,” he had said to himself, now and then. “Even my Betty. Good
God--who knows!”
</p><p>Because of this, he had read each letter with keen eyes. They were long
letters, full of detail and colour, because she knew he enjoyed them.
She had a delightful touch. He sometimes felt as if they walked the
English lanes together. His intimacy with her neighbours, and her
neighbourhood, was one of his relaxations. He found himself thinking of
old Doby and Mrs. Welden, as a sort of soporific measure, when he lay
awake at night. She had sent photographs of Stornham, of Dunholm Castle,
and of Dole, and had even found an old engraving of Lady Alanby in her
youth. Her evident liking for the Dunholms had pleased him. They were
people whose dignity and admirableness were part of general knowledge.
Lord Westholt was plainly a young man of many attractions. If the two
were drawn to each other--and what more natural--all would be well.
He wondered if it would be Westholt. But his love quickened a sagacity
which needed no stimulus. He said to himself in time that, though she
liked and admired Westholt, she went no farther. That others paid court
to her he could guess without being told. He had seen the effect she had
produced when she had been at home, and also an unexpected letter to his
wife from Milly Bowen had revealed many things. Milly, having noted Mrs.
Vanderpoel's eager anxiety to hear direct news of Lady Anstruthers, was
not the person to let fall from her hand a useful thread of connection.
She had written quite at length, managing adroitly to convey all that
she had seen, and all that she had heard. She had been making a visit
within driving distance of Stornham, and had had the pleasure of meeting
both Lady Anstruthers and Miss Vanderpoel at various parties. She was so
sure that Mrs. Vanderpoel would like to hear how well Lady Anstruthers
was looking, that she ventured to write. Betty's effect upon the county
was made quite clear, as also was the interested expectation of her
appearance in town next season. Mr. Vanderpoel, perhaps, gathered more
from the letter than his wife did. In her mind, relieved happiness and
consternation were mingled.
</p><p>“Do you think, Reuben, that Betty will marry that Lord Westholt?” she
rather faltered. “He seems very nice, but I would rather she married an
American. I should feel as if I had no girls at all, if they both lived
in England.”
</p><p>“Lady Bowen gives him a good character,” her husband said, smiling. “But
if anything untoward happens, Annie, you shall have a house of your own
half way between Dunholm Castle and Stornham Court.”
</p><p>When he had begun to decide that Lord Westholt did not seem to be the
man Fate was veering towards, he not unnaturally cast a mental eye over
such other persons as the letters mentioned. At exactly what period his
thought first dwelt a shade anxiously on Mount Dunstan he could not have
told, but he at length became conscious that it so dwelt. He had begun
by feeling an interest in his story, and had asked questions about him,
because a situation such as his suggested query to a man of affairs.
Thus, it had been natural that the letters should speak of him. What she
had written had recalled to him certain rumours of the disgraceful
old scandal. Yes, they had been a bad lot. He arranged to put a
casual-sounding question or so to certain persons who knew English
society well. What he gathered was not encouraging. The present
Lord Mount Dunstan was considered rather a surly brute, and lived a
mysterious sort of life which might cover many things. It was bad blood,
and people were naturally shy of it. Of course, the man was a pauper,
and his place a barrack falling to ruin. There had been something rather
shady in his going to America or Australia a few years ago.
</p><p>Good looking? Well, so few people had seen him. The lady, who was
speaking, had heard that he was one of those big, rather lumpy men, and
had an ill-tempered expression. She always gave a wide berth to a man
who looked nasty-tempered. One or two other persons who had spoken of
him had conveyed to Mr. Vanderpoel about the same amount of vaguely
unpromising information. The episode of G. Selden had been interesting
enough, with its suggestions of picturesque contrasts and combinations.
Betty's touch had made the junior salesman attracting. It was a good
type this, of a young fellow who, battling with the discouragements of
a hard life, still did not lose his amazing good cheer and patience, and
found healthy sleep and honest waking, even in the hall bedroom. He had
consented to Betty's request that he would see him, partly because he
was inclined to like what he had heard, and partly for a reason which
Betty did not suspect. By extraordinary chance G. Selden had seen Mount
Dunstan and his surroundings at close range. Mr. Vanderpoel had liked
what he had gathered of Mount Dunstan's attitude towards a personality
so singularly exotic to himself. Crude, uneducated, and slangy, the
junior salesman was not in any degree a fool. To an American father with
a daughter like Betty, the summing-up of a normal, nice-natured, common
young denizen of the United States, fresh from contact with the
effete, might be subtly instructive, and well worth hearing, if it was
unconsciously expressed. Mr. Vanderpoel thought he knew how, after
he had overcome his visitor's first awkwardness--if he chanced to be
self-conscious--he could lead him to talk. What he hoped to do was to
make him forget himself and begin to talk to him as he had talked to
Betty, to ingenuously reveal impressions and points of view. Young men
of his clean, rudimentary type were very definite about the things they
liked and disliked, and could be trusted to reveal admiration, or lack
of it, without absolute intention or actual statement. Being elemental
and undismayed, they saw things cleared of the mists of social prejudice
and modification. Yes, he felt he should be glad to hear of Lord Mount
Dunstan and the Mount Dunstan estate from G. Selden in a happy moment of
unawareness.
</p><p>Why was it that it happened to be Mount Dunstan he was desirous to hear
of? Well, the absolute reason for that he could not have explained,
either. He had asked himself questions on the subject more than once.
There was no well-founded reason, perhaps. If Betty's letters had spoken
of Mount Dunstan and his home, they had also described Lord Westholt
and Dunholm Castle. Of these two men she had certainly spoken more fully
than of others. Of Mount Dunstan she had had more to relate through the
incident of G. Selden. He smiled as he realised the importance of the
figure of G. Selden. It was Selden and his broken leg the two men had
ridden over from Mount Dunstan to visit. But for Selden, Betty might not
have met Mount Dunstan again. He was reason enough for all she had said.
And yet----! Perhaps, between Betty and himself there existed the thing
which impresses and communicates without words. Perhaps, because
their affection was unusual, they realised each other's emotions. The
half-defined anxiety he felt now was not a new thing, but he confessed
to himself that it had been spurred a little by the letter the last
steamer had brought him. It was NOT Lord Westholt, it definitely
appeared. He had asked her to be his wife, and she had declined his
proposal.
</p><p>“I could not have LIKED a man any more without being in love with him,”
 she wrote. “I LIKE him more than I can say--so much, indeed, that I
feel a little depressed by my certainty that I do not love him.”
</p><p>If she had loved him, the whole matter would have been simplified. If
the other man had drawn her, the thing would not be simple. Her father
foresaw all the complications--and he did not want complications for
Betty. Yet emotions were perverse and irresistible things, and the
stronger the creature swayed by them, the more enormous their power.
But, as he sat in his easy chair and thought over it all, the
one feeling predominant in his mind was that nothing mattered but
Betty--nothing really mattered but Betty.
</p><p>In the meantime G. Selden was walking up Fifth Avenue, at once touched
and exhilarated by the stir about him and his sense of home-coming. It
was pretty good to be in little old New York again. The hurried pace of
the life about him stimulated his young blood. There were no street cars
in Fifth Avenue, but there were carriages, waggons, carts, motors, all
pantingly hurried, and fretting and struggling when the crowded state
of the thoroughfare held them back. The beautifully dressed women in
the carriages wore no light air of being at leisure. It was evident that
they were going to keep engagements, to do things, to achieve objects.
</p><p>“Something doing. Something doing,” was his cheerful self-congratulatory
thought. He had spent his life in the midst of it, he liked it, and it
welcomed him back.
</p><p>The appointment he was on his way to keep thrilled him into an uplifted
mood. Once or twice a half-nervous chuckle broke from him as he tried to
realise that he had been given the chance which a year ago had seemed
so impossible that its mere incredibleness had made it a natural subject
for jokes. He was going to call on Reuben S. Vanderpoel, and he was
going because Reuben S. had made an appointment with him.
</p><p>He wore his London suit of clothes and he felt that he looked pretty
decent. He could only do his best in the matter of bearing. He always
thought that, so long as a fellow didn't get “chesty” and kept his head
from swelling, he was all right. Of course he had never been in one of
these swell Fifth Avenue houses, and he felt a bit nervous--but Miss
Vanderpoel would have told her father what sort of fellow he was, and
her father was likely to be something like herself. The house, which had
been built since Lady Anstruthers' marriage, was well “up-town,” and was
big and imposing. When a manservant opened the front door, the square
hall looked very splendid to Selden. It was full of light, and of rich
furniture, which was like the stuff he had seen in one or two special
shop windows in Fifth Avenue--places where they sold magnificent
gilded or carven coffers and vases, pieces of tapestry and marvellous
embroideries, antiquities from foreign palaces. Though it was quite
different, it was as swell in its way as the house at Mount Dunstan,
and there were gleams of pictures on the walls that looked fine, and no
mistake.
</p><p>He was expected. The man led him across the hall to Mr. Vanderpoel's
room. After he had announced his name he closed the door quietly and
went away. Mr. Vanderpoel rose from an armchair to come forward to meet
his visitor. He was tall and straight--Betty had inherited her slender
height from him. His well-balanced face suggested the relationship
between them. He had a steady mouth, and eyes which looked as if they
saw much and far.
</p><p>“I am glad to see you, Mr. Selden,” he said, shaking hands with
him. “You have seen my daughters, and can tell me how they are. Miss
Vanderpoel has written to me of you several times.”
</p><p>He asked him to sit down, and as he took his chair Selden felt that he
had been right in telling himself that Reuben S. Vanderpoel would be
somehow like his girl. She was a girl, and he was an elderly man of
business, but they were like each other. There was the same kind of
straight way of doing things, and the same straight-seeing look in both
of them.
</p><p>It was queer how natural things seemed, when they really happened to a
fellow. Here he was sitting in a big leather chair and opposite to him
in its fellow sat Reuben S. Vanderpoel, looking at him with friendly
eyes. And it seemed all right, too--not as if he had managed to “butt
in,” and would find himself politely fired out directly. He might have
been one of the Four Hundred making a call. Reuben S. knew how to make
a man feel easy, and no mistake. This G. Selden observed at once, though
he had, in fact, no knowledge of the practical tact which dealt with
him. He found himself answering questions about Lady Anstruthers and
her sister, which led to the opening up of other subjects. He did not
realise that he began to express ingenuous opinions and describe things.
His listener's interest led him on, a question here, a rather pleased
laugh there, were encouraging. He had enjoyed himself so much during his
stay in England, and had felt his experiences so greatly to be rejoiced
over, that they were easy to talk of at any time--in fact, it was even a
trifle difficult not to talk of them--but, stimulated by the look which
rested on him, by the deft word and ready smile, words flowed readily
and without the restraint of self-consciousness.
</p><p>“When you think that all of it sort of began with a robin, it's queer
enough,” he said. “But for that robin I shouldn't be here, sir,” with a
boyish laugh. “And he was an English robin--a little fellow not half the
size of the kind that hops about Central Park.”
</p><p>“Let me hear about that,” said Mr. Vanderpoel.
</p><p>It was a good story, and he told it well, though in his own junior
salesman phrasing. He began with his bicycle ride into the green
country, his spin over the fine roads, his rest under the hedge during
the shower, and then the song of the robin perched among the fresh wet
leafage, his feathers puffed out, his red young satin-glossed breast
pulsating and swelling. His words were colloquial enough, but they
called up the picture.
</p><p>“Everything sort of glittering with the sunshine on the wet drops, and
things smelling good, like they do after rain--leaves, and grass, and
good earth. I tell you it made a fellow feel as if the whole world was
his brother. And when Mr. Rob. lit on that twig and swelled his red
breast as if he knew the whole thing was his, and began to let them
notes out, calling for his lady friend to come and go halves with him, I
just had to laugh and speak to him, and that was when Lord Mount Dunstan
heard me and jumped over the hedge. He'd been listening, too.”
</p><p>The expression Reuben S. Vanderpoel wore made it an agreeable thing to
talk--to go on. He evidently cared to hear. So Selden did his best,
and enjoyed himself in doing it. His style made for realism and brought
things clearly before one. The big-built man in the rough and shabby
shooting clothes, his way when he dropped into the grass to sit beside
the stranger and talk, certain meanings in his words which conveyed to
Vanderpoel what had not been conveyed to G. Selden. Yes, the man
carried a heaviness about with him and hated the burden. Selden quite
unconsciously brought him out strongly.
</p><p>“I don't know whether I'm the kind of fellow who is always making
breaks,” he said, with his boy's laugh again, “but if I am, I never made
a worse one than when I asked him straight if he was out of a job, and
on the tramp. It showed what a nice fellow he was that he didn't get hot
about it. Some fellows would. He only laughed--sort of short--and said
his job had been more than he could handle, and he was afraid he was
down and out.”
</p><p>Mr. Vanderpoel was conscious that so far he was somewhat attracted by
this central figure. G. Selden was also proving satisfactory in the
matter of revealing his excellently simple views of persons and things.
</p><p>“The only time he got mad was when I wouldn't believe him when he told
me who he was. I was a bit hot in the collar myself. I'd felt sorry for
him, because I thought he was a chap like myself, and he was up against
it. I know what that is, and I'd wanted to jolly him along a bit. When
he said his name was Mount Dunstan, and the place belonged to him,
I guessed he thought he was making a joke. So I got on my wheel and
started off, and then he got mad for keeps. He said he wasn't such a
damned fool as he looked, and what he'd said was true, and I could go
and be hanged.”
</p><p>Reuben S. Vanderpoel laughed. He liked that. It sounded like decent
British hot temper, which he had often found accompanied honest British
decencies.
</p><p>He liked other things, as the story proceeded. The picture of the huge
house with the shut windows, made him slightly restless. The concealed
imagination, combined with the financier's resentment of dormant
interests, disturbed him. That which had attracted Selden in the
Reverend Lewis Penzance strongly attracted himself. Also, a man was a
good deal to be judged by his friends. The man who lived alone in the
midst of stately desolateness and held as his chief intimate a high-bred
and gentle-minded scholar of ripe years, gave, in doing this, certain
evidence which did not tell against him. The whole situation meant
something a splendid, vivid-minded young creature might be moved
by--might be allured by, even despite herself.
</p><p>There was something fantastic in the odd linking of incidents--Selden's
chance view of Betty as she rode by, his next day's sudden resolve to
turn back and go to Stornham, his accident, all that followed seemed, if
one were fanciful--part of a scheme prearranged
</p><p>“When I came to myself,” G. Selden said, “I felt like that fellow in the
Shakespeare play that they dress up and put to bed in the palace when
he's drunk. I thought I'd gone off my head. And then Miss Vanderpoel
came.” He paused a moment and looked down on the carpet, thinking. “Gee
whiz! It WAS queer,” he said.
</p><p>Betty Vanderpoel's father could almost hear her voice as the rest was
told. He knew how her laugh had sounded, and what her presence must
have been to the young fellow. His delightful, human, always satisfying
Betty!
</p><p>Through this odd trick of fortune, Mount Dunstan had begun to see her.
Since, through the unfair endowment of Nature--that it was not wholly
fair he had often told himself--she was all the things that desire could
yearn for, there were many chances that when a man saw her he must long
to see her again, and there were the same chances that such an one as
Mount Dunstan might long also, and, if Fate was against him, long with
a bitter strength. Selden was not aware that he had spoken more fully of
Mount Dunstan and his place than of other things. That this had been the
case, had been because Mr. Vanderpoel had intended it should be so. He
had subtly drawn out and encouraged a detailed account of the time
spent at Mount Dunstan vicarage. It was easily encouraged. Selden's
affectionate admiration for the vicar led him on to enthusiasm. The
quiet house and garden, the old books, the afternoon tea under the
copper beech, and the long talks of old things, which had been so new to
the young New Yorker, had plainly made a mark upon his life, not likely
to be erased even by the rush of after years.
</p><p>“The way he knew history was what got me,” he said. “And the way you got
interested in it, when he talked. It wasn't just HISTORY, like you learn
at school, and forget, and never see the use of, anyhow. It was things
about men, just like yourself--hustling for a living in their way, just
as we're hustling in Broadway. Most of it was fighting, and there are
mounds scattered about that are the remains of their forts and camps.
Roman camps, some of them. He took me to see them. He had a little old
pony chaise we trundled about in, and he'd draw up and we'd sit and
talk. 'There were men here on this very spot,' he'd say, 'looking
out for attack, eating, drinking, cooking their food, polishing their
weapons, laughing, and shouting--MEN--Selden, fifty-five years before
Christ was born--and sometimes the New Testament times seem to us so far
away that they are half a dream.' That was the kind of thing he'd say,
and I'd sometimes feel as if I heard the Romans shouting. The country
about there was full of queer places, and both he and Lord Dunstan knew
more about them than I know about Twenty-third Street.”
</p><p>“You saw Lord Mount Dunstan often?” Mr. Vanderpoel suggested.
</p><p>“Every day, sir. And the more I saw him, the more I got to like
him. He's all right. But it's hard luck to be fixed as he is--that's
stone-cold truth. What's a man to do? The money he ought to have to keep
up his place was spent before he was born. His father and his eldest
brother were a bum lot, and his grandfather and great-grandfather
were fools. He can't sell the place, and he wouldn't if he could.
Mr. Penzance was so fond of him that sometimes he'd say things. But,”
 hastily, “perhaps I'm talking too much.”
</p><p>“You happen to be talking about questions I have been greatly interested
in. I have thought a good deal at times of the position of the holders
of large estates they cannot afford to keep up. This special instance is
a case in point.”
</p><p>G. Selden felt himself in luck again. Reuben S., quite evidently, found
his subject worthy of undivided attention. Selden had not heartily liked
Lord Mount Dunstan, and lived in the atmosphere surrounding him, looking
about him with sharp young New York eyes, without learning a good deal.
</p><p>He had seen the practical hardship of the situation, and laid it bare.
</p><p>“What Mr. Penzance says is that he's like the men that built things
in the beginning--fought for them--fought Romans and Saxons and
Normans--perhaps the whole lot at different times. I used to like to
get Mr. Penzance to tell stories about the Mount Dunstans. They were
splendid. It must be pretty fine to look back about a thousand years and
know your folks have been something. All the same its pretty fierce to
have to stand alone at the end of it, not able to help yourself, because
some of your relations were crazy fools. I don't wonder he feels mad.”
</p><p>“Does he?” Mr. Vanderpoel inquired.
</p><p>“He's straight,” said G. Selden sympathetically. “He's all right. But
only money can help him, and he's got none, so he has to stand and stare
at things falling to pieces. And--well, I tell you, Mr. Vanderpoel, he
LOVES that place--he's crazy about it. And he's proud--I don't mean he's
got the swell-head, because he hasn't--but he's just proud. Now, for
instance, he hasn't any use for men like himself that marry just for
money. He's seen a lot of it, and it's made him sick. He's not that
kind.”
</p><p>He had been asked and had answered a good many questions before he went
away, but each had dropped into the talk so incidentally that he had
not recognised them as queries. He did not know that Lord Mount Dunstan
stood out a clearly defined figure in Mr. Vanderpoel's mind, a figure to
be reflected upon, and one not without its attraction.
</p><p>“Miss Vanderpoel tells me,” Mr. Vanderpoel said, when the interview was
drawing to a close, “that you are an agent for the Delkoff typewriter.”
</p><p>G. Selden flushed slightly.
</p><p>“Yes, sir,” he answered, “but I didn't----”
</p><p>“I hear that three machines are in use on the Stornham estate, and that
they have proved satisfactory.”
</p><p>“It's a good machine,” said G. Selden, his flush a little deeper.
</p><p>Mr. Vanderpoel smiled.
</p><p>“You are a business-like young man,” he said, “and I have no doubt you
have a catalogue in your pocket.”
</p><p>G. Selden was a business-like young man. He gave Mr. Vanderpoel one
serious look, and the catalogue was drawn forth.
</p><p>“It wouldn't be business, sir, for me to be caught out without it,” he
said. “I shouldn't leave it behind if I went to a funeral. A man's got
to run no risks.”
</p><p>“I should like to look at it.”
</p><p>The thing had happened. It was not a dream. Reuben S. Vanderpoel,
clothed and in his right mind, had, without pressure being exerted upon
him, expressed his desire to look at the catalogue--to examine it--to
have it explained to him at length.
</p><p>He listened attentively, while G. Selden did his best. He asked a
question now and then, or made a comment. His manner was that of a
thoroughly composed man of business, but he was remembering what Betty
had told him of the “ten per,” and a number of other things. He saw
the flush come and go under the still boyish skin, he observed that G.
Selden's hand was not wholly steady, though he was making an effort not
to seem excited. But he was excited. This actually meant--this thing so
unimportant to multi-millionaires--that he was having his “chance,” and
his young fortunes were, perhaps, in the balance.
</p><p>“Yes,” said Reuben S., when he had finished, “it seems a good,
up-to-date machine.”
</p><p>“It's the best on the market,” said G. Selden, “out and out, the best.”
</p><p>“I understand you are only junior salesman?”
</p><p>“Yes, sir. Ten per and five dollars on every machine I sell. If I had a
territory, I should get ten.”
</p><p>“Then,” reflectively, “the first thing is to get a territory.”
</p><p>“Perhaps I shall get one in time, if I keep at it,” said Selden
courageously.
</p><p>“It is a good machine. I like it,” said Mr. Vanderpoel. “I can see a
good many places where it could be used. Perhaps, if you make it known
at your office that when you are given a good territory, I shall
give preference to the Delkoff over other typewriting machines, it
might--eh?”
</p><p>A light broke out upon G. Selden's countenance--a light radiant and
magnificent. He caught his breath. A desire to shout--to yell--to whoop,
as when in the society of “the boys,” was barely conquered in time.
</p><p>“Mr. Vanderpoel,” he said, standing up, “I--Mr. Vanderpoel--sir--I feel
as if I was having a pipe dream. I'm not, am I?”
</p><p>“No,” answered Mr. Vanderpoel, “you are not. I like you, Mr. Selden. My
daughter liked you. I do not mean to lose sight of you. We will begin,
however, with the territory, and the Delkoff. I don't think there will
be any difficulty about it.”
</p><p>. . . . .
</p><p>Ten minutes later G. Selden was walking down Fifth Avenue, wondering
if there was any chance of his being arrested by a policeman upon the
charge that he was reeling, instead of walking steadily. He hoped he
should get back to the hall bedroom safely. Nick Baumgarten and Jem
Bolter both “roomed” in the house with him. He could tell them both.
It was Jem who had made up the yarn about one of them saving Reuben S.
Vanderpoel's life. There had been no life-saving, but the thing had come
true.
</p><p>“But, if it hadn't been for Lord Mount Dunstan,” he said, thinking it
over excitedly, “I should never have seen Miss Vanderpoel, and, if it
hadn't been for Miss Vanderpoel, I should never have got next to Reuben
S. in my life. Both sides of the Atlantic Ocean got busy to do a good
turn to Little Willie. Hully gee!”
</p><p>In his study Mr. Vanderpoel was rereading Betty's letters. He felt that
he had gained a certain knowledge of Lord Mount Dunstan.
