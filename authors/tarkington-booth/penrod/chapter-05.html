<p>"Penrod!" Mrs. Lora Rewbush stood in the doorway, indignantly
gazing upon a Child Sir Lancelot mantled to the heels. "Do you
know that you have kept an audience of five hundred people waiting
for ten minutes?"  She, also, detained the five hundred while
she spake further.</p>

<p>"Well," said Penrod contentedly, as he followed her toward the
buzzing stage, "I was just sitting there thinking."</p>

<p>Two minutes later the curtain rose on a medieval castle hall
richly done in the new stage-craft made in Germany and consisting
of pink and blue cheesecloth. The Child King Arthur and the Child
Queen Guinevere were disclosed upon thrones, with the Child Elaine
and many other celebrities in attendance; while about fifteen
Child Knights were seated at a dining-room table round, which
was covered with a large Oriental rug, and displayed (for the
knights' refreshment) a banquet service of silver loving-cups
and trophies, borrowed from the Country Club and some local automobile
manufacturers.</p>

<p>In addition to this splendour, potted plants and palms have seldom
been more lavishly used in any castle on the stage or off.</p>

<p>The footlights were aided by a "spot-light" from the rear of
the hall; and the children were revealed in a blaze of glory.</p>

<p>A hushed, multitudinous "<em>O-OH" </em>of admiration came from
the decorous and delighted audience. Then the children sang feebly:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Chuldrun of the Tabul Round,<br/>
Lit-tul knights and ladies we.<br/>
Let our voy-siz all resound<br/>
Faith and hope and charitee!"

</p>
</div>
<p>The Child King Arthur rose, extended his sceptre with the decisive
gesture of a semaphore, and spake:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Each littul knight and lady born<br/>
Has noble deeds TO perform<br/>
In <em>THEE </em>child-world of shivullree,<br/>
No matter how small his share may be.<br/>
Let each advance and tell in turn<br/>
What claim has each to knighthood earn."

</p>
</div>
<p>The Child Sir Mordred, the villain of this piece, rose in his
place at the table round, and piped the only lines ever written
by Mrs. Lora Rewbush which Penrod Schofield could have pronounced
without loathing. Georgie Bassett, a really angelic boy, had been
selected for the role of Mordred. His perfect conduct had earned
for him the sardonic sobriquet, "The Little Gentleman," among
his boy acquaintances. (Naturally he had no friends.) Hence the
other boys supposed that he had been selected for the wicked Mordred
as a reward of virtue. He declaimed serenely:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"I hight Sir Mordred the Child, and I teach<br/>
Lessons of selfishest evil, and reach<br/>
Out into darkness.  Thoughtless, unkind,<br/>
And ruthless is Mordred, and unrefined."

</p>
</div>
<p>The Child Mordred was properly rebuked and denied the accolade,
though, like the others, he seemed to have assumed the title already.
He made a plotter's exit. Whereupon Maurice Levy rose, bowed,
announced that he highted the Child Sir Galahad, and continued
with perfect sang-froid:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"I am the purest of the pure.<br/>
I have but kindest thoughts each day.<br/>
I give my riches to the poor,<br/>
And follow in the Master's way."

</p>
</div>
<p>This elicited tokens of approval from the Child King Arthur,
and he bade Maurice "stand forth" and come near the throne, a
command obeyed with the easy grace of conscious merit.</p>

<p>It was Penrod's turn. He stepped back from his chair, the table
between him and the audience, and began in a high, breathless
monotone:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"I hight Sir Lancelot du Lake, the Child,<br/>
Gentul-hearted, meek, and mild.<br/>
What though I'm <em>BUT </em>a littul child,<br/>
Gentul-heartud, meek, and mild,<br/>
I do my share though but&mdash;though but&#11834;"

</p>
</div>
<p>Penrod paused and gulped. The voice of Mrs. Lora Rewbush was
heard from the wings, prompting irritably, and the Child. Sir
Lancelot repeated:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"I do my share though but&mdash;though but a tot,<br/>
I pray you knight Sir Lancelot!"

</p>
</div>
<p>This also met the royal favour, and Penrod was bidden to join
Sir Galahad at the throne. As he crossed the stage, Mrs. Schofield
whispered to Margaret:</p>

<p>"That boy! He's unpinned his mantle and fixed it to cover his
whole costume. After we worked so hard to make it becoming!"</p>

<p>"Never mind; he'll have to take the cape off in a minute," returned
Margaret. She leaned forward suddenly, narrowing her eyes to see
better. "What IS that thing hanging about his left ankle?" she
whispered uneasily. "How queer! He must have got tangled in something."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Mrs. Schofield, in alarm.</p>

<p>"His left foot. It makes him stumble. Don't you see? It looks&mdash;it
looks like an elephant's foot!"</p>

<p>The Child Sir Lancelot and the Child Sir Galahad clasped hands
before their Child King. Penrod was conscious of a great uplift;
in a moment he would have to throw aside his mantle, but even
so he was protected and sheltered in the human garment of a man.
His stage-fright had passed, for the audience was but an indistinguishable
blur of darkness beyond the dazzling lights. His most repulsive
speech (that in which he proclaimed himself a "tot") was over
and done with; and now at last the small, moist hand of the Child
Sir Galahad lay within his own. Craftily his brown fingers stole
from Maurice's palm to the wrist. The two boys declaimed in concert:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"We are two chuldrun of the Tabul Round<br/>
Strewing kindness all a-round.<br/>
With love and good deeds striving ever for the best,<br/>
May our littul efforts e'er be blest.<br/>
Two littul hearts we offer.  See<br/>
United in love, faith, hope, and char<br/>
&mdash;OW!"

</p>
</div>
<p>The conclusion of the duet was marred. The Child Sir Galahad
suddenly stiffened, and, uttering an irrepressible shriek of anguish,
gave a brief exhibition of the contortionist's art. ("HE'S <em>TWISTIN'
MY WRIST! DERN YOU, LEGGO</em>!")</p>

<p>The voice of Mrs. Lora Rewbush was again heard from the wings;
it sounded bloodthirsty. Penrod released his victim; and the Child
King Arthur, somewhat disconcerted, extended his sceptre and,
with the assistance of the enraged prompter, said:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Sweet child-friends of the Tabul Round,<br/>
In brotherly love and kindness abound,<br/>
Sir Lancelot, you have spoken well,<br/>
Sir Galahad, too, as clear as bell.<br/>
So now pray doff your mantles gay.<br/>
You shall be knighted this very day."

</p>
</div>
<p>And Penrod doffed his mantle.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, a thick and vasty gasp came from the audience,
as from five hundred bathers in a wholly unexpected surf. This
gasp was punctuated irregularly, over the auditorium, by imperfectly
subdued screams both of dismay and incredulous joy, and by two
dismal shrieks. Altogether it was an extraordinary sound, a sound
never to be forgotten by any one who heard it. It was almost as
unforgettable as the sight which caused it; the word "sight" being
here used in its vernacular sense, for Penrod, standing unmantled
and revealed in all the medieval and artistic glory of the janitor's
blue overalls, falls within its meaning.</p>

<p>The janitor was a heavy man, and his overalls, upon Penrod, were
merely oceanic. The boy was at once swaddled and lost within their
blue gulfs and vast saggings; and the left leg, too hastily rolled
up, had descended with a distinctively elephantine effect, as
Margaret had observed. Certainly, the Child Sir Lancelot was at
least a sight.</p>

<p>It is probable that a great many in that hall must have had,
even then, a consciousness that they were looking on at History
in the Making. A supreme act is recognizable at sight: it bears
the birthmark of immortality. But Penrod, that marvellous boy,
had begun to declaim, even with the gesture of flinging off his
mantle for the accolade:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"I first, the Child Sir Lancelot du Lake,<br/>
Will volunteer to knighthood take,<br/>
And kneeling here before your throne<br/>
I vow to&#11834;"

</p>
</div>
<p>He finished his speech unheard. The audience had recovered breath,
but had lost self-control, and there ensued something later described
by a participant as a sort of cultured riot.</p>

<p>The actors in the "pageant" were not so dumfounded by Penrod's
costume as might have been expected. A few precocious geniuses
perceived that the overalls were the Child Lancelot's own comment
on maternal intentions; and these were profoundly impressed: they
regarded him with the grisly admiration of young and ambitious
criminals for a jail-mate about to be distinguished by hanging.
But most of the children simply took it to be the case (a little
strange, but not startling) that Penrod's mother had dressed him
like that&mdash;which is pathetic. They tried to go on with the "pageant."</p>

<p>They made a brief, manful effort. But the irrepressible outbursts
from the audience bewildered them; every time Sir Lancelot du
Lake the Child opened his mouth, the great, shadowy house fell
into an uproar, and the children into confusion. Strong women
and brave girls in the audience went out into the lobby, shrieking
and clinging to one another. Others remained, rocking in their
seats, helpless and spent. The neighbourhood of Mrs. Schofield
and Margaret became, tactfully, a desert. Friends of the author
went behind the scenes and encountered a hitherto unknown phase
of Mrs. Lora Rewbush; they said, afterward, that she hardly seemed
to know what she was doing. She begged to be left alone somewhere
with Penrod Schofield, for just a little while.</p>

<p>They led her away.</p>
