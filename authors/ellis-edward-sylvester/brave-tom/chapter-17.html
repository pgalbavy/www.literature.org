<p>The meeting between Tom Gordon and Jim Travers was one of the
most joyous character.</p>

<p>As soon as the fugitive recognized his old friend, he uttered
a cry of delight, and rushing forward, threw his arms around his
neck, and the latter responded with a regular shout of happiness.</p>

<p>Then they laughed and asked and answered questions for some ten
minutes, both in such a flutter of excitement, that their stock
of knowledge was scarcely increased in the least.</p>

<p>By the time they got down to their sober senses, Jim awoke to
the fact that a couple of bad men were after him, and were likely
to pursue him across the threshold of the farmer's home.</p>

<p>There was no one present during the affecting interview between
the lads excepting the kind host, and he was so touched by the
joy of his guests that he more than once drew his hand across
his face in a very expressive manner.</p>

<p>When Jim explained his peril, telling how it was he escaped to
this place, the farmer said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You may bid farewell to all earthly fear while you're here with
me. The old woman is over to one of the neighbors', and there
ain't no one home but me; howsomever, I'm equal to any two."</p>

<p>Just then the gate was heard to shut, and the farmer stepped
hurriedly to the window and looked out.</p>

<p>"Yes, there's two men coming up the path."</p>

<p>"They're after me," said the frightened Jim; "let me run out
through the back way; I can get away from them."</p>

<p>"You won't do any such thing," was the resolute reply of the
old man, while he compressed his lips, and his eyes flashed resolutely.</p>

<p>"This is <em>my</em> home, and the law says it is my castle;
and if any man attempts to cross that threshold against my orders,
on his head be the consequences."</p>

<p>By way of making matters consistent, he stepped briskly into
the next room; and when he returned, which was in the course of
three seconds, he held a loaded double-barreled gun in his grasp.</p>

<p>"It's well to have something like this to sorter emphasize what
you say, you know&mdash;hello!"</p>

<p>The scoundrels were at the door, and a resounding knock was heard.</p>

<p>"Come in," called back the old man, who stood in the room, gun
in hand.</p>

<p>Instead of opening the door, the criminals on the outside knocked
again, their evident purpose being to gain an advantage by bringing
some one to them.</p>

<p>"Come in!"</p>

<p>This was uttered in a tone that could be heard a hundred yards,
and those who were applying for admission could not pretend to
be ignorant of such a lusty welcome as that.</p>

<p>The latch was lifted, the door shoved inward, and there the two
sailors stood, each with a revolver in hand, looking into the
room, but neither venturing to step over the threshold.</p>

<p>We have stated where the farmer stood, and what his pose meant.</p>

<p>Tom Gordon was nearly recovered from his fractured leg, and he,
too, had risen from his chair with his pistol in hand. He told
Jim to get as near him&mdash;or rather behind him&mdash;as he could, and
if there was to be any shooting, why, he would take a hand.</p>

<p>The sailors could not fail to take in the fact that the three
were on their mettle, and something more than a summons was necessary
to bring them to terms.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want?" asked the farmer, in a voice like a
growl, while he lowered upon them in the most ominous style.</p>

<p>"We want that boy," replied Bob, the sailor, pointing his pistol
at the fellow, whose heart beat a little faster when he found
himself confronted by such danger.</p>

<p>"Do you want to go with them?" asked the farmer of the boy.</p>

<p>"No; they mean to kill me; they've tried it already, and you
can see that my clothes are still wet from jumping into the river
to swim away from them."</p>

<p>"He belongs to us. We don't wish to hurt him; but he must go
with us. If he refuses, we shall take him, and it will be bad
for you."</p>

<p>"It will, eh?" muttered the farmer, a peculiar click, click,
where his hand grasped the gun, showing that he was cocking the
weapon, so as to be ready for business. "It will, eh? Now I'll
give you just two seconds and a half to take yourselves out of
my sight, and if you don't, I'll empty both barrels of this gun
into you."</p>

<p>"Let me know when you're going to shoot, Mr. Pitcairn," said
Tom, also cocking his revolver, "because I want to join in."</p>

<p>The sailors, with some muttered imprecations, wheeled about and
took themselves off, leaving the three masters of the field.</p>

<p>This danger removed, the boys sat down, and while the farmer
went out to attend to some work about the premises, they talked
coolly and sensibly over the past and future.</p>

<p>Tom was almost entirely recovered from the hurt to his leg, and
expected to leave the house in the course of a few days.</p>

<p>He had written to and received a letter from his employers, notifying
him that his situation was gone and there was none to give him.</p>

<p>So his future was as uncertain as that of Jim, who had not received
a penny since leaving home the winter before, and who had not
the remotest idea as to what he should do.</p>

<p>Jim had a small sum of money with him, and his other clothes
were still preserved by his friend.</p>

<p>As Tom was the owner of some extra garments, these were donned
by the fellow who had received such a ducking; and, as the room
was pleasantly warm, he experienced no inconvenience from his
bath.</p>

<p>Tom had also quite a sum in the savings-bank, and though he was
reluctant to call upon it, yet there was enough to provide both
against any want.</p>

<p>Tom said Farmer Pitcairn was a kind man, and thought he should
be paid something for his entertainment of the wounded boy, as
was manifestly his due; yet he would treat them as well without
the slightest compensation.</p>

<p>When the farmer came in, and the case was laid before him, he
said that he could make use of Jim at once, and of Tom as soon
as he should be able to go around, and they might remain on the
farm as long as they chose.</p>

<p>The life of a young farmer was not very attractive to either
of the lads, but they concluded to fall back on it until they
could find some more agreeable opening.</p>

<p>There was some fear that the two sailors would show themselves
again and make trouble, but nothing more of them was ever seen.</p>

<p>When Jim related the story of his abduction, Tom and Mr. Pitcairn
boiled with indignation, and insisted on a prosecution of the
scoundrels, including Mr. Hornblower, who could easily be reached
by the strong arm of the law.</p>

<p>On mature reflection, however, the scheme was abandoned.</p>

<p>Jim made himself as useful as he could; and being unusually bright
and quick to learn, he disappointed the farmer with his readiness
in picking up the hundreds of mysterious little things which make
up the farmer's life.</p>

<p>He learned to milk the cows, to drive the plow, to ride the most
fractious horses, and to break the fiery young colts; he knew
precisely how to look after the horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, fowls,
and everything at night and in the morning.</p>

<p>As Tom regained the use of his limb, he joined him in this pursuit
of knowledge, which had a great many pleasant features about it.</p>

<p>They became expert in the use of the gun, and as one of the neighbors
owned a rifle which he was willing to lend, they practiced until
they grew quite skillful in the use of that weapon.</p>

<p>The pistol afforded another branch of the science of projectiles,
and, as the revolver was an unusually good one, they also became
remarkably expert in the use of that little "bulldog."</p>

<p>Jim visited the city a short time after his arrival at the farmer's,
and brought back all the property belonging to himself and Tom,
as well as the money deposited in the savings-bank.</p>

<p>This latter move was one of the best they ever made. Two days
after, the bank in which the deposit was made went to pieces,
the depositors, consisting mainly of the poorer classes of people,
losing all, while the officers retired with plethoric pockets
to wait till the storm should blow over.</p>

<p>During these beautiful days the lads held long and earnest conferences
as to what they should do, for they had reached an age wherein
there was little time to spare.</p>

<p>They discussed the plan of learning some useful trade, and decided
to do so; but, after several attempts to secure the opportunity,
all resulting in failure, they gave it up, concluding that the
fates had not intended them for such a life. They could not bring
themselves down to the plan of remaining farmers all their days.</p>

<p>Tom would have liked to become a lawyer, and Jim inclined to
the profession of medicine; but being without friends to secure
the openings, they were compelled to give them the go-by, for
the present at least. Another occupation seemed peculiarly attractive
to them; that was one where each could make use of his skill in
penmanship, something in the way of clerical work. In the pursuit
of this phantom they learned the rather mournful fact that every
such situation in the United States has from ten to a hundred
applicants.</p>

<p>The boys became well satisfied that Farmer Pitcairn was allowing
them to remain with him under the pretense of work, when the real
truth was that they were more of a hindrance than a help. This
knowledge made them uncomfortable, and caused them to resolve
that it should not continue.</p>

<p>The spring wore along until the mild summer came, and still the
boys remained with Farmer Pitcairn.</p>
