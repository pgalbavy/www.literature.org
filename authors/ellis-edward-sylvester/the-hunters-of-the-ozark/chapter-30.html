<p>That ride of Terry Clark on the back of the buffalo bull was
one which he could never forget had he wished to do so, which
of course he did not. The first thrill, when the beast dashed
off on a dead run, and the wind began blowing by the ears of the
lad, was that of pleasure. He was having an exciting ride, and,
as good fortune would have it, the animal was bearing him straight
along the trail toward the camp in the Ozarks.</p>

<p>"If the baste will show enough consideration for me," thought
the lad, "to kape up his coorse for twinty miles or so, he will
give me a good lift toward raichin' the folks, though sorry I
am that I haven't Fred alongside or rather behind me."</p>

<p>The bull being on a run, his progress consisted of a series of
quick jumps, which jarred the rider so much that had he not kept
a good grip upon the shaggy mane, he would have been unseated.
The hair of the animal was so long that he was able to make his
hold secure, though he had a constant fear that he would stumble,
in which case the rider was sure to take a tremendous header that
was likely to break his neck.</p>

<p>Terry could feel the throb, as it may be called, of the engine.
His position was such that his heels touched the body close to
the shoulders of the bull. At that point there was an alternate
swelling and sinking of the muscles, as the animal alighted on
his feet and leaped away again, which Terry felt as plainly as
if he had held his open hand on the shoulder. Then, too, the bull
had a peculiar sidelong motion, as though some of his muscles
occasionally got out of "gear," and the action of the hind legs
did not "dovetail," so to speak, with that of the fore legs.</p>

<p>Nothing escaped the eye of Terry during those exciting minutes.
He thought the head of the bull was held unusually low, but he
noticed the short, thick horns, curving outward and then coming
over until they ended within a few inches of each other, and he
was sure that amid the dusty frontispiece of the immense area
of skull bone he could see where his useless bullet had struck
and glanced off; once or twice he caught a whiff of the breath
of the buffalo, redolent with the not unpleasant odor of grass,
and now and then he could hear his fierce snort. It seemed to
Terry that the animal turned his head partly to one side as if
to get a view of the strange creature on his back. Doubtless such
was the fact, and, after each sight, it seemed that he bounded
away with more terror than before.</p>

<p>Brief as was the time taken by the bull in galloping across the
prairie, it allowed Terry to see every thing. As soon as he felt
sure of retaining his seat, he glanced at the other animals, all
of which were galloping in the same direction as the bull. Some
of them were so fleet that they passed him, but he retained his
place near the middle of the herd.</p>

<p>The buffalo, or properly the bison, is a stupid animal, but a
peculiar fact about the small drove amid which Terry Clark was
riding was that a number noticed him and in their way tried to
push him off. They would dash up beside the bull with head lowered,
and rub their horns against him in the effort to reach the rider
and unseat him.</p>

<p>"The only way in which ye can do that," said Terry, when he saw
what they were trying to do, "is to climb up and take a saat behind
me. Thin, if ye'll lock yer arms about me nick ye may persuade
me to stip down, but ye can't do much while on the ground."</p>

<p>The buffaloes were too dull of intellect to realize their helplessness
in this respect, and they continued crowding close to the bull
until they must have caused him some discomfort. This crowding
was of such a marked character that, as you will remember, it
was noticed by Fred Linden as far off as he stood.</p>

<p>Once or twice the rider had one of his feet slightly jammed,
but he was able to lift it out of danger without imperiling his
position. The dust caused by the hoofs of the animals did not
rise until his steed had passed beyond, so that he suffered nothing
therefrom and every thing in front was in plain view. The speed
of the beast, however, caused some inconvenience, for the wind
made him blink, and it was only by half closing his eyes that
he could peer out between the lids and see clearly.</p>

<p>Before the other side of the prairie was reached, Terry Clark
began asking himself the natural and important question, &mdash;How
is this to end?</p>

<p>The same theories that I have mentioned as occurring to Fred
Linden passed through his brain also. If the bull should dash
among the trees at that headlong pace, the rider could not retain
his place for more than a minute or two; if he was wounded enough
to cause him to give out and fall to the ground, he would be trampled
upon by those behind and Terry of course would share his fate.</p>

<p>Brief as was the time given for thought, the youth considered
a half dozen plans. He glanced over his shoulder and was alarmed
to see how many animals were in the rear of him. He asked himself
whether he could not slip backward, grasp the swinging tail, and
dropping to the ground, keep his feet while he held fast to the
caudal appendage, and pulling the other way, act as a brake upon
the progress of the animal until all the others had passed on.
Then he would "release brakes," and allow the bull to continue
his career as suited himself.</p>

<p>But he was compelled to admit that the plan was not feasible.
The bull was going at such a pace that the rider would be sure
to lose his balance the moment he struck the ground, and, though
he might still hold fast to the tail and retard the progress of
the beast, he was sure of getting in the way of his heels.</p>

<p>"If his tail was a little longer," reflected Terry, "I would
try the same, but I'm afeard I would git mixed up with his hind
hoofs and things wouldn't be agraaable."</p>

<p>So that plan was abandoned.</p>

<p>"If he goes in among the trees, I'll lean forward on me face
until he knocks out his brains&mdash;that is, if he has any&mdash;whin I'll
dismount."</p>

<p>That was all well enough if the bull should happen to follow
the programme, but the prospect of his doing so was too remote
to afford much comfort to the youth.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll kaap erict like a gintleman," he concluded, "and
as soon as a chance comes for me to jump off, I'll go."</p>

<p>Terry had no thought but that the buffaloes would dash among
the trees and continue their flight in the same headlong fashion,
as long as they could; but, to his amazement, the head of the
drove suddenly swerved to the left and the bull followed.</p>

<p>"Be the powers, but this will never do," was his conclusion;
"this perarie may raach all the way to the Gulf of Mexico, and
the bull doesn't act as if he meant to stop before he raaches
there; I'm goin' to make other arrangements."</p>

<p>He kept his seat until the drove had gone several hundred yards
with unabated speed. So far as he could judge, the bull was holding
his own with the rest: whatever wound he had received was of no
account, so far as its immediate effect was seen. The others continued
crowding up as before, but Terry did not mind them. He yelled
and shook his head in the hope of frightening them off so as to
give him the room he wished in order to make his venture, but
they did not mind him. The odd crackling of their hoofs, the rattling
of their horns as they struck together, and their occasional bellowing,
made a din amid which no shout that he could raise would gain
any consideration whatever.</p>

<p>"There's one thing sartin," said Terry, compressing his lips
and showing by his action that he had made up his mind to end
the business one way or the other. "I'm tired of this crowd, and
I ain't goin' to spind any more time with it."</p>

<p>Between him and the wood were seven or eight buffaloes, crowding
close in their idiotic fashion, as though to push off the rider.
Terry recalled the day, early in spring, when he ran rapidly across
the creek near his home, by stepping upon the surging masses of
ice, one after the other, and leaping off again before they had
time to respond to his weight. He resolved to try something of
the kind.</p>

<p>Holding fast to the wiry mane with his hands, he drew his feet
up under him, balanced himself a moment, then straightened up,
and, turning quickly, stepped upon the back of the bull that was
immediately alongside. Before that creature could know what had
been done, the pressure was removed and the weight of the lad
was borne by a cow which was his next neighbor.</p>

<p>Terry Clark ran as nimbly as a monkey across the backs of the
intervening buffaloes, until his foot rested on the one nearest
the wood. A slight slip at the moment of stepping upon his back
disconcerted him so that he could not recover himself. His intention
was to land on the ground with his face in the same direction
he was going. Then, even if he could not keep his feet, he could
run with such speed that his fall would not hurt him; but unfortunately
as he struck the ground he faced the other way, and before he
could check himself, he went over backward with such force that
he was knocked senseless.</p>

<p>After all, the fall may be considered a fortunate one, for he
was not seriously hurt and soon recovered himself. He had received
a severe shock, but in a short time he sat up and stared about
him. Recalling what had taken place, he looked in the direction
of the herd of buffaloes. None of them was in sight, but a dark
heap a short distance away showed where the bull on which he had
ridden had given out and fallen to the ground. He was wounded
more seriously than at first seemed to be the case. Had Terry
stayed on his back a few brief minutes longer, he would have gone
down with him and been trampled to death by the hoofs of those
in the rear.</p>

<p>"I think I'm all here, as me cousin used to remark after he had
enj'yed himself at Donnybrook Fair," said Terry, rising carefully
to his feet, swinging his arms and kicking out his legs. He had
been violently jarred, and he was alarmed by a dizziness that
caused him to sit down again. But he recovered quickly, and soon
was as well as ever. He turned to the left and passed among the
trees, where, despite the coolness of the day, he felt the relief
of the shade thus afforded him.</p>

<p>"I s'pose Fred will be jealous whin he finds out what a foine
ride I have had," he added, his old sense of humor coming back;
"but all he has to do is to catch a buffalo bull and git on his
back: but I don't think he'll forgit the same right away."</p>

<p>Looking over the prairie, he saw the figure of his friend walking
in almost a direct line toward him, though he was so far off that
he was not distinctly visible, partly because of the dust which
still lingered in the air.</p>

<p>Fred's encounter with the Winnebago horsemen had taken place
and ended while Terry lay senseless on the ground, so that the
latter had no suspicion of the exciting occurrence.</p>

<p>Terry ought to have walked out on the plain, swung his hat and
cheered his friend; but that would have been contrary to his nature.
He kept out of sight among the trees, until Fred was quite close,
when he broke into vigorous whistling.</p>

<p>Fred heard the familiar sound, stopped short, looked about him
and then burst into laughter as he saw his comrade. The next moment
they ran together, shook hands and mutually congratulated each
other, as you will admit they had full warrant in doing.</p>
