<p>The letter which was delivered to Warren Starr by his mortally
wounded hound not only gave that young man definite news of the
alarming events in the neighborhood of his home, but has conveyed
to the reader the cause of the abrupt change in his plans and
of the stirring incidents which led to the hasty flight of the
Starr family from their ranch on the north of the Big Cheyenne
River.</p>

<p>As stated in the note, it was Tim Brophy, the young Irishman,
who made the discovery in time to prevent the family being overwhelmed
and massacred. While Jared Plummer, the lank New Englander, rode
to the westward to look after some strays, Tim galloped north
to attend to the main herd, which was supposed to be cropping
the abundant grass in the neighborhood of several small streams
and tributaries of the main river.</p>

<p>Tim had been in the employ of Mr. Starr for three years, and
had spent most of his life in the West, so that he had fully learned
the lesson which such an experience should teach everyone. He
knew of the impending trouble among the Indian tribes, and was
always on the alert. It was not long, therefore, before he came
upon signs which told him something was amiss.</p>

<p>In the corner of a natural clearing, near one of the small streams,
he discovered a dozen of the cattle lying dead. It was not necessary
for him to dismount and examine the ground to learn the cause
of such slaughter. The footprints of ponies near by, the bullet
wounds, and other indications answered the question that came
to his lips at the first glimpse of the cruel butchery.</p>

<p>"The spalpeens!" he exclaimed wrath-fully. "They niver had a
better friend than Mr. Starr, and that's the shtyle in which they
pays him for the same. Worrah, worrah, but it's too bad!"</p>

<p>Riding cautiously to the top of the next elevation, the young
rancher saw other sights which filled him with greater indignation
and resentment. A half mile to the northward the entire herd of
cattle, numbering several hundreds, were scurrying over the plain
in a wild panic. The figures of several Sioux bucks galloping
at their heels, swinging their arms and shouting, so as to keep
up and add to the affright, left no doubt that Mr. Starr's fine
drove of cattle was gone beyond recovery. The result of months
of toil, expense, and trouble were vanishing as they sometimes
do before the resistless sweep of the cyclone.</p>

<p>The blue eyes of the Celt flashed, as he sat in the saddle and
contemplated the exasperating raid. Nothing would have pleased
him better than to dash with several companions after the marauders
and force them to a reckoning for the outrage. But eager as he
was for such an affray, he was too wise to try it alone. There
were five or six of the horsemen, and he was no match for them.</p>

<p>Besides this, a more alarming discovery broke upon him within
a minute after observing the stampede. From the clump of wood
on his right, along the edge of the stream, only a few hundred
yards away, he detected the faint smoke of a camp-fire. The Sioux
were there.</p>

<p>The sight so startled Tim that he wheeled his pony short around
and withdrew behind the elevation he had just ascended, fearing
he had already been observed by the red men.</p>

<p>Such undoubtedly would have been the fact had any of the turbulent
Sioux been on guard, but the occasion was one of those rare ones
in which the warriors acted upon the theory that no such precaution
was needed, since no possible danger could threaten them.</p>

<p>Suspecting the truth, Tim dropped hastily from his pony and stole
along the edge of the stream, until he reached a point which gave
him a sight of the miscreants, and at the same time afforded him
tolerably fair protection.</p>

<p>The scene was calculated to inspire anything but pleasant feelings
in a spectator. Fully a score of young warriors were squatted
in a circle, listening to the harangue of one of their number,
who had wrought himself into a furious passion. He was swinging
his arms, shouting and leaping about like a lunatic, and rising
to a pitch which not only threatened to throw him into a paroxysm,
but was imparting itself to his listeners. Some of them were smoking,
but showing at the same time an excitement which is generally
believed to be foreign to the American race. They were all bucks,
and eager to be led upon the warpath. There was not an old or
middle-aged man among them.</p>

<p>The eavesdropper was not able to understand their words, but
the gestures left no doubt of their fearful meaning. The speaker
pointed in the direction of the home of the Starrs so often, and
indulged in so much action to which the others signified full
assent, that it was beyond dispute that they meant to attack the
house and slay the inmates. Knowing all about these, and the resistance
they were likely to meet, they would wait until night before bursting
upon them.</p>

<p>Tim Brophy was sagacious enough to grasp almost on the instant
the full nature of the awful peril. He saw that accident, or rather
Providence, had given to him the secret which revealed that only
by prompt action could the lives of his friends be saved. There
was no saying how long the council, if such it may be called,
would last, and he did not care to know.</p>

<p>Nothing could show the intense absorption of the fierce Sioux
in the outrage they had determined to commit more than the fact
that a white man rose up in full view only a few hundred yards
away, without his presence being detected. Such being the case,
it was easy for Tim to withdraw from the immediate vicinity of
the gathering, steal round to where his pony was cropping the
grass, and mount again.</p>

<p>He rode carefully forward, keeping the elevation between him
and the camp of the hostiles, until convinced it was safe, when
he struck his horse into a run and sped away as if for life.</p>

<p>A few minutes sufficed to take him to the house, where the unsuspicious
folk looked up in wonder at his haste and agitation. Mr. Starr
was sitting near the window reading a newspaper, his little girl
Dot was playing with her doll on the floor, and the wife was busy
with her household duties.</p>

<p>It took but a few minutes for Tim to tell the news. Jared Plummer
had not yet come in, and there could be no guessing as to what
additional facts he would give them.</p>

<p>Like his employ√©, the rancher was quick to grasp the situation.
The only possible safety was in flight, and no time was to be
lost.</p>

<p>The building, with its broad, flat roof, its many windows and
insecure portions, was in no condition for successful defence,
where the small garrison could not guard one-half the weak points.
The assailants could readily fire it, and it would burn like so
much touchwood. Flight, therefore, was the one and only thing
to be thought of.</p>

<p>It was yet comparatively early in the afternoon, and those on
the ranch had noted the signs of the approaching snowstorm. The
husband directed his wife to make her preparations few and simple,
and to waste no time. It was idle to bewail the necessity which
compelled them to leave so many precious articles behind. Life
was dearer than all, and the courageous helpmate proved herself
equal to the occasion. She gathered the articles of clothing they
were likely to need, filled several bags with the provisions in
the house, and announced that she was ready.</p>

<p>There was a horse each for the father, mother, and Tim Brophy,
while a fourth, a small, tough pony, was laden with the bag of
provisions, extra clothing, and a few articles deemed indispensable.
These were brought round to the front, and in much less time than
would be supposed the little cavalcade was ready to move.</p>

<p>Despite the belief of Brophy that no attack would be made until
after darkness had closed,&mdash;a belief shared by Mr. Starr,&mdash;the
rancher was fearful that his home would be placed under surveillance
while daylight lasted, and that the intended flight would be discovered
before it began. In such an event, the family could only fight
it out to the desperate end, and that they would do so admits
of no doubt.</p>
