TURNING from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning, 
I made the best of my way to Fleet-street, and there got a late hack- 
ney chariot and drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden. In 
those times a bed was always to be got there at any hour of the 
night, and the chamberlain, letting me in at his ready wicket, 
lighted the candle next in order on his shelf, and showed me 
straight into the bedroom next in order on his list. It was a sort of 
vault on the ground floor at the back, with a despotic monster of a 
four-post bedstead in it, straddling over the whole place, putting 
one of his arbitrary legs into the fire-place and another into the 
doorway, and squeezing the wretched little washing-stand in quite 
a Divinely Righteous manner. 

<p>As I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me 
in, before he left me, the good old constitutional rush-light of 
those virtuous days -- an object like the ghost of a walking-cane, 
which instantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing 
could ever be lighted at, and which was placed in solitary confine- 
ment at the bottom of a high tin tower, perforated with round holes 
that made a staringly wide-awake pattern on the walls. When I had 
got into bed, and lay there footsore, weary, and wretched, I found 
that I could no more close my own eyes than I could close the eyes 
of this foolish Argus. And thus, in the gloom and death of the 
night, we stared at one another. 

<p>What a doleful nightl How anxious, how dismal, how long! 
There was an inhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot 
dust; and, as I looked up into the corners of the tester over my 
head, I thought what a number of blue-bottle flies from the but- 
chers', and earwigs from the market, and grubs from the country, 
must be holding on up there, lying by for next summer. This led 
me to speculate whether any of them ever tumbled down, and then 
I fancied that I felt light falls on my fuce -- a disagreeable turn of 
thought, suggesting other and more objectionable approaches up 
my back. When I had lain awake a little while, those extraordinary 
voices with which silence teems, began to make themselves audible. 
The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little washing-stand 
ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the chest of 
drawers. At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired a 
new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I saw 
written, DONT GO HOME. 

<p>Whatever night-funcies and night-noises crowded on me, they 
never warded offthis DONT GO HOME. It plaited itself into what- 
ever I thought of, as a bodily pain would have done. Not long be- 
fore, I had read in the newspapers, how a gentleman unknown had 
come to the Hummums in the night, and had gone to bed, and had 
destroyed himself, and had been found in the morning weltering in 
blood. It came into my head that he must have occupied this very 
vault of mine, and I got out of bed to assure myself that there were 
no red marks about; then opened the door to look out into the 
passages, and cheer myself with the companionship of a distant 
light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. But all this 
time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home, 
and when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, 
were questions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have 
supposed there could be no more room in it for any other theme. 
Even when I thought of Estella, and how we had parted that day 
for ever, and when I recalled all the circumstances of our parting 
and all her looks and tones, and the action of her fingers while she 
knitted -- even then I was pursuing, here and there and everywhere, 
the caution Don't go home. When at last I dozed, in sheer exhaus- 
tion of mind and body, it became a vast shadowy verb which I had 
to conjugate. Imperative mood, present tense: Do not thou go 
home, let him not go home, let us not go home, do not ye or you go 
home, let not them go home. Then, potentially: I may not and I 
cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, and should 
not go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, and rolled 
over on the pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall 
again. 

<p>I had left directions that I was to be called at seven; for it was 
plain that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and 
equally plain that this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments, 
only, could be taken. It was a relief to get out of the room where 
the night had been so miserable, and I needed no second knocking 
at the door to startle me from my uneasy bed. 

<p>The Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o'clock. 
The little servant happening to be entering the fortress with two 
hot rolls, I passed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge, 
in her company, and so came without announcement into the 
presence of Wemmick as he was making tea for himself and the 
Aged. An open door afforded a perspective view of the Aged in 
bed. 

<p>`Halloa, Mr Pip !'  said Wemmick. `You did come home, 
then?' 

<p>`Yes,' I returned; `but I didn't go home.' 

<p>`That's all right,' said he, rubbing his hands. `I left a note for you 
at each of the Temple gates, on the chance. Which gate did you 
come to?' 

<p>I told him. 

<p>`I'll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy 
the notes,' said Wemmick; `it's a good tule never to leave docu- 
mentary evidence if you can help it, because you don't know when 
it may be put in. I'm going to take a liberty with you. -- <I>Would</I> you 
mind toasting this sausage for the Aged P.?' 

<p>I said I should be delighted to do it. 

<p>`Then you can go about your work, Mary Anne,' said Wemmick 
to the little servant; `which leaves us to ourselves, don't you see, 
Mr Pip?' he added, winking, as she disappeared. 

<p>I thanked him for his friendship and caution, and our discourse 
proceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Aged's sausage and he 
buttered the crumb of the Aged's roll. 

<p>`Now, Mr Pip, you know,' said Wemmick, `you and I 
understand one another. We are in our private and personal 
capacities, and we have been engaged in a confidential transaction 
before today. Official sentiments are one thing. We are extra 
official.' 

<p>I cordially assented. I was so very nervous, that I had already 
lighted the Aged's sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow 
it out. 

<p>`I accidentally heard, yesterday morning,' said Wemmick, 
`being in a certain place where I once took you -- even between you 
and me, it's as well not to mention names when avoidable --' 

<p>`Much better not,' said I. `I understand you.' 

<p>`I heard there by chance, yesterday morning,' said Wemmick, 
`that a certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and not 
unpossessed of portable property -- I don't know who it may really 
be -- we won't name this person --' 

<p>`Not necessary,' said I. 

<p>`-- had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a 
good many people go, not always in gratification of their own in- 
clinations, and not quite irrespective of the government ex- 
pense -- 

<p>In watching his face, I made quite a firework of the Aged's saus- 
age, and greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wem- 
mick's; for which I apologized. 

<p>`- by disappearing from such place, and being no more heard of 
thereabouts. From which,' said Wemmick, `conjectures had been 
raised and theories formed. I also heard that you at your chambers 
in Garden-court, Temple, had been watched, and might be watched 
again.' 

<p>`By whom?' said I. 

<p>`I wouldn't go into that,' said Wemmick, evasively, `it might 
clash with official responsibilities. I heard it, as I have in my time 
heard other curious things in the same place. I don't tell it you on 
information received. I heard it.' 

<p>He took the toasting-fork and sausage from me as he spoke, and 
set forth the Aged's breakfast neatly on a little tray. Previous to 
placing it before him, he went into the Aged's room with a clean 
white cloth, and tied the same under the old gentleman's chin, and 
propped him up, and put his nightcap on one side, and gave him 
quite a rakish air. Then, he placed his breakfast before him with 
great care, and said, `All right, ain't you, Aged P.?' To which the 
cheerful Aged replied, `All right, John, my boy, all right!' As there 
seemed to be a tacit understanding that the Aged was not in a pre- 
sentable state, and was therefore to be considered invisible, I made 
a pretence of being in complete ignorance of these proceedings. 

<p>`This watching of me at my chambers (which I have once had 
reason to suspect),' I said to Wemmick when he came back, `is 
inseparable from the person to whom you have adverted; is it?' 

<p>Wemmick looked very serious. `I couldn't undertake to say that, 
of my own knowledge. I mean, I couldn't undertake to say it was 
at first. But it either is, or it will be, or it's in great danger of being.' 

<p>As I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from 
saying as much as he could, and as I knew with thankfulness to 
him how far out of his way he went to say what he did, I could not 
press him. But I told him, after a little meditation over the fire, that 
I would like to ask him a question, subject to his answering or not 
answering, as he deemed right, and sure that his course would be 
right. He paused in his breakfast, and crossing his arms, and pinch- 
ing his shirt-sleeves (his notion of indoor comfort was to sit with- 
out any coat), he nodded to me once, to put my question. 

<p>`You have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is 
Compeyson? ' 

<p>He answered with one other nod. 

<p>`Is he living?' 

<p>One other nod. 

<p>`Is he in London?' 

<p>He gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office 
exceedingly, gave me one last nod, and went on with his break- 
fast. 

<p>`Now ' said Wemmick, `questioning being over;' which he 
emphasized and repeated for my guidance; `I come to what I did, 
after hearing what I heard. I went to Garden-court to find you; not 
finding you, I went to Clarriker's to find Mr Herbert.' 

<p>`And him you found?' said I, with great anxiety. 

<p>`And him I found. Without mentioning any names or going 
into any details, I gave him to understand that if he was aware 
of anybody -- Tom, Jack, or Richard -- being about the chambers, 
or about the immediate neighbourhood, he had better get 
Tom, Jack, or Richard, out of the way while you were out of 
the way.' 

<p>`He would be greatly puzzled what to do?' 

<p>`He <I>was</I> puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave him 
my opinion that it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or 
Richard, too far out of the way at present. Mr Pip, I'll tell you 
something. Under existing circumstances there is no place like a 
great city when you are once in it. Don't break cover too soon. 
Lie close. Wait till things slacken, before you try the open, even 
for foreign air.' 

<p>I thanked him for his valuable advice, and asked him what Her- 
bert had done? 

<p>`Mr Herbert,' said Wemmick, `after being all of a heap for half 
an hour, struck out a plan. He mentioned to me as a secret, that he 
is courting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a 
bedridden Pa. Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies 
a-bed in a bow-window where he can see the ships sail up and 
down the river. You are acquainted with the young lady, most 
probably?' 

<p>`Not personally,' said I. 

<p>The truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive com- 
panion who did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first 
proposed to present me to her, she had received the proposal with 
such very moderate warmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged 
to confide the state of the case to me, with a view to the lapse of a 
little time before I made her acquaintance. When I had begun to 
advance Herbert's prospects by stealth, I had been able to bear this 
with cheerful philosophy; he and his affianced, for their part, had 
naturally not been very anxious to introduce a third person into 
their interviews; and thus, although I was assured that I had risen 
in Clara's esteem, and although the young lady and I had long 
regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by Herbert, I 
had never seen her. However, I did not trouble Wemmick with 
these particulars. 

<p>`The house with the bow-window,' said Wemmick, `being by 
the river-side, down the Pool there between Limehouse and Green- 
wich, and being kept, it seems, by a very respectable widow who 
has a furnished upper floor to let, Mr Herbert put it to me, what did 
I think of that as a temporary tenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard ? 
Now, I thought very well of it, for three reasons l'll give you. That 
is to say. Firstly. It's altogether out of all your beats, and is well 
away from the usual heap of streets great and small. Secondly. 
Without going near it yourself, you could always hear of the safety 
of Tom, Jack, or Richard, through Mr Herbert. Thirdly. After a 
while and when it might be prudent, if you should want to slip 
Tom, Jack, or Richard, on board a foreign packet-boat, there he 
is -- ready.' 

<p>Much comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick 
again and again, and begged him to proceed. 

<p>`Well, sir! Mr Herbert threw himself into the business with a 
will, and by nine o'clock last night he housed Tom, Jack, or 
Richard -- whichever it may be -- you and I don't want to know -- 
quite successfully. At the old lodgings it was understood that he 
was summoned to Dover, and in fact he was taken down the Dover 
road and cornered out of it. Now, another great advantage of all 
this, is, that it was done without you, and when, if any one was 
concerning himself about your movements, you must be known to 
be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged. This di- 
verts suspicion and confuses it; and for the same reason I recom- 
mended that even if you came back last night, you should not go 
home. lt brings in more confusion, and you want confusion.' 

<p>Wemmick, having finished his breakfast, here looked at his 
watch, and began to get his coat on. 

<p>`And now, Mr Pip,' said he, with his hands still in the aleeves, `I 
have probably done the most I can do; but if I can ever do more -- 
from a Walworth point of view, and in a strictly private and per- 
sonal capacity -- I shall be glad to do it. Here's the address. There 
can be no harm in your going here to-night and seeing for yourself 
that all is well with Tom, Jack, or Richard, before you go home -- 
which is another reason for your not going home last night. But 
after you have gone home, don't go back here. You are very wel- 
come, I am sure, Mr Pip;' his hands were now out of his sleeves, 
and I was shaking them; `and let me finally impress one important 
point upon you.' He laid his hands upon my shoulders, and added 
in a solemn whisper: `Avail yourself of this evening to lay hold of 
his portable property. You don't know what may happen to him. 
Don't let anything happen to the portable property.' 

<p>Quite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this 
point, I forbore to try. 

<p>`Time's up,' said Wemmick, `and I must be off. If you had 
nothing more pressing to do than to keep here till dark, that's what 
I should advise. You look very much worried, and it would do you 
good to have a perfectly quiet day with the Aged -- he'll be up pre- 
sently -- and a little bit of -- you remember the pig?' 

<p>`Of course,' said I. 

<p>`Well; and a little bit of <I>him.</I> That sausage you toasted was his, 
and he was in all respects a first-rater. Do try him, if it is only for 
old acquaintance sake. Good-bye, Aged Parent!' in a cheery shout. 

<p>`All right, John; all right, my boyl' piped the old man from 
within. 

<p>I soon fell asleep before Wemmick's fire, and the Aged and I en- 
joyed one another's society by falling asleep before it more or less 
all day. We had loin of pork for dinner, and greens grown on the es- 
tate, and I nodded at the Aged with a good intention whenever I 
failed to do it drowsily. When it was quite dark, I left the Aged 
preparing the fire for toast; and I inferred from the number of tea- 
cups, as well as from his glances at the two little doors in the wall, 
that Miss Skiffins was expected.
