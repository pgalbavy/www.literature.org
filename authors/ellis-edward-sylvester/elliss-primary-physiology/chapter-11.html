<p>You are provided by nature with about four hundred muscles. Every
one has its special use. They are fastened to the bones, which
can only be moved by them. The principal muscles are shown in
the figure on page 45.</p>

<p>The muscles are generally found in pairs, so that when motion
is produced in one direction, another muscle or group of muscles
causes motion in the opposite direction.</p>

<em>VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY MUSCLES</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>A voluntary muscle is one which you can control; an involuntary
muscle is not subject to your will. Thus, when you move your hand
or foot, it is done by a voluntary muscle. Your heart beats without
any will of your own, and is therefore, controlled by involuntary
muscles.</p>

<em>STRENGTH OF MUSCLES</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>A well-developed man can drag a little less than his own weight
over a level surface, while a draught-horse can draw only two-thirds.
The horse, therefore, is relatively weaker than man. There are
some insects, however, which are able to move nearly fifty times
their own weight.</p>

<p>From what you have learned about the importance of exercise,
you will understand how necessary it is that every muscle should
be trained. In no other way can you preserve sound, rugged health.</p>

<p>
<em>HYGIENE OF THE MUSCLES</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>When the muscles are properly used, they become large, firm,
and dark red in color. Such use of them causes the skin to act
freely, while the brain is made vigorous and the digestion improved.
It is the best medicine in the world. You must be careful not
to strain or overwork your muscles, as it is very hurtful. Your
strength must be built up by moderate, careful, and regular exercise.</p>

<p>The muscles need not only exercise to make them strong, but a
constant supply of good, pure blood. You must eat wholesome food,
in proper quantities, at regular intervals.</p>

<p>You must take plenty of exercise in the sunlight. The blood and
the muscles demand the light and the heat of the sun to make them
strong.</p>

<em>EFFECTS OF EXERCISE</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>The effect of exercise upon the muscles may be clearly seen in
the arm of the blacksmith; in the foot and leg of the walker;
in the fingers of the pianist; and in the hand and fore-arm of
the skillful penman.</p>

<p>  How many muscles have you? How are the bones moved?</p>

<p>  How are the muscles generally found? In what manner do they
work?</p>

<p>  What is a voluntary muscle? An involuntary one? Illustrate
the   difference.</p>

<p>  Compare the strength of a well-developed man with that of a
horse.   What is said of some insects?</p>

<p>  Why should the muscles he trained? What is the result?</p>

<p>  What kind of medicine is such exercise? How must your strength
be   built up?</p>

<p>  What do the muscles need beside exercise?</p>

<p>  Where should the exercise be taken?</p>

<p>  Show some of the effects. </p>
