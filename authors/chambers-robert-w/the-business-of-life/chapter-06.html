<p>When the sombre morning broke at last, Jacqueline awoke, sprang
from her bed, and fluttered away about her dressing as blithely
as an April linnet in a hurry.</p>

<p>She had just time to breakfast and catch her train, with the
help of heaven and a taxicab, and she managed to do it about the
same moment that Desboro, half a hundred miles away, glanced out
of his dressing-room window and saw the tall trees standing like
spectres in the winter fog, and the gravel on the drive shining
wet and muddy through melting snow. But he turned to the mirror
again, whistling a gay air, and twisted his necktie into a smarter
knot. Then he went out to the greenhouses and snipped off enough
carnations to make a great sheaf of clove-scented blossoms for
Jacqueline's room; and after that he proceeded through the other
sections of the fragrant glass galleries, cutting, right and left,
whatever he considered beautiful enough to do her fresh, young
beauty honour.</p>

<p>At the station, he saw her standing on the platform of the drawing-room
car as the train thundered in, veil and raincoat blowing, just
as he had seen her there the first time she arrived at Silverwood
station.</p>

<p>The car steps were sheathed in ice; she had already ventured
down a little way when he reached her and offered aid; and she
permitted him to swing her to the cinder-strewn ground.</p>

<p>"Are you really here!" he exclaimed, oblivious of interested
glances from trainmen and passengers.</p>

<p>They exchanged an impulsive hand-clasp. Both were unusually animated.</p>

<p>"Are you well?" she asked, as though she had been away for months.</p>

<p>"Yes. Are you? It's perfectly fine of you to come"&mdash;still retaining
her hand&mdash;"I wonder if you know how glad I am to see you! I wonder
if you really do!"</p>

<p>She started to say something, hesitated, blushed, then their
hands parted, and she answered lightly:</p>

<p>"What a very cordial welcome for a business girl on a horrid
day! You mustn't spoil me, Mr. Desboro."</p>

<p>"I was afraid you might not come," he said; and indiscreet impulse
prompted her to answer, as she had first answered him there on
the platform two weeks ago:</p>

<p>"Do you suppose that mere weather could have kept me away from
the famous Desboro collection?"</p>

<p>The charming malice in her voice, the delightful impertinence
of her reply, so obviously at variance with fact, enchanted him.
She was conscious of its effect on him, and, already slightly
excited, ventured to laugh at her own thrust as though challenging
his self-conceit to believe that she had even grazed herself with
the two-edged weapon.</p>

<p>"Do I count for absolutely nothing?" he said.</p>

<p>"Do you flatter yourself that I returned to see <em>you</em>?"</p>

<p>"Let me believe it for just one second."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt that you will secretly and triumphantly believe
it all the time."</p>

<p>"If I dared&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Is that sort of courage lacking in you, Mr. Desboro? I have
heard otherwise. And how long are we going to remain here on this
foggy platform?"</p>

<p>Here was an entirely new footing; but in the delightful glow
of youthful indiscretion she still maintained her balance lightly,
mockingly.</p>

<p>"Please tell me," she said, as they entered the car, and he drew
the big fur robe around her, "just how easily you believe in your
own overpowering attractions. Do women encourage you in such modest
faith in yourself? Or are you merely created that way?"</p>

<p>"The house has been a howling wilderness without you," he said.
"I admit <em>my</em> loneliness, anyway."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> admit nothing. Besides, I wasn't."</p>

<p>"Is that true?"</p>

<p>She laughed tormentingly, eyes and cheeks brilliant, now undisguisedly
on guard&mdash;her first acknowledgment that in this man she condescended
to divine the hereditary adversary.</p>

<p>"I mean to punish," said her eyes.</p>

<p>"What an attack from a clear sky on a harmless young man," he
said, at last.</p>

<p>"No, an attack from the fog on an insufferable egoist&mdash;an ambush,
Mr. Desboro. And I thought a little sword-play might do your complacent
wits a service. Has it?"</p>

<p>"But you begin by a dozen thrusts, then beat down my guard, and
cuff me about with blade and pommel&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I had to. Now, does your vanity believe that my return to Silverwood
was influenced by your piteous appeal over the wire&mdash;and your
bad temper, too?"</p>

<p>"No," he said solemnly.</p>

<p>"Well, then! I came here partly to put my notes in better shape
for Mr. Sissly, partly to clear up odds and ends and leave him
a clear field to plow&mdash;in your persistent company," she added,
with such engaging malice that even the name of Sissly, which
he hated, made him laugh.</p>

<p>"You won't do that," he said confidently.</p>

<p>"Do what, Mr. Desboro?"</p>

<p>"Turn me over to anything named Sissly."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I will&mdash;you and your celebrated collection! Of course
you <em>could</em> go South, but, judging from your devotion to
the study of ancient armour&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You don't mean it, do you?"</p>

<p>"What? About your devotion?"</p>

<p>"No, about Sissly."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. Listen to me, Mr. Desboro. I made up my mind that
sleighing, and skating, and luncheon and tea, and&mdash;<em>you</em>,
are not good for a busy girl's business career. I'm going to be
very practical and very frank with you. I don't belong here except
on business, and you make it so pleasant and unbusinesslike for
me that my conscience protests. You see, if the time I now take
to lunch with you, tea with you, skate, sleigh, talk, listen,
in your very engaging company is properly employed, I can attend
to yards and yards of business in town. And I'm going to. I mean
it, please," as he began to smile.</p>

<p>His smile died out. He said, quietly:</p>

<p>"Doesn't our friendship count for anything?"</p>

<p>She looked at him; shrugged her shoulders:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Desboro," she said pleasantly, "does it, <em>really</em>?"</p>

<p>The blue eyes were clear and beautiful, and a little grave; only
the upcurled corners of her mouth promised anything.</p>

<p>The car drew up at the house; she sprang out and ran upstairs
to her room. He heard her in animated confab with Mrs. Quant for
a few minutes, then she came down in her black business gown,
with narrow edges of lawn at collar and cuffs, and the bright
lock already astray on her cheek. A white carnation was tucked
into her waist; the severe black of her dress, as always, made
her cheeks and lips and golden hair more brilliant by contrast.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, "for my notes. And what are you going to do
while I'm busy?"</p>

<p>"Watch you, if I may. You've heard about the proverbial cat?"</p>

<p>"Care killed it, didn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but it had a good look at the Queen first."</p>

<p>A smile touched her eyes and lips&mdash;a little wistfully.</p>

<p>"You know, Mr. Desboro, that I like to waste time with you. Flatter
your vanity with that confession. And even if things were&mdash;different&mdash;but
they couldn't ever be&mdash;and I must work very hard if I'm ever going
to have any leisure in my old age. But come to the library for
this last day, and smoke as usual. And you may talk to amuse me,
if you wish. Don't mind if I'm too busy to answer your folly in
kind."</p>

<p>They went together to the library; she placed the mass of notes
in front of her and began to sort them&mdash;turned for a second and
looked around at him with adorable malice, then bent again to
the task before her.</p>

<p>"Miss Nevers!"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"You will come to Silverwood again, won't you?"</p>

<p>She wrote busily with a pencil.</p>

<p>"Won't you?"</p>

<p>She made some marginal notes and he looked at the charming profile
in troubled silence.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "She turned leisurely.... 'Did you say anything
recently, Mr. Desboro?'"]</p>

<p>About ten minutes later she turned leisurely, tucking up the
errant strand of hair with her pencil:</p>

<p>"Did you say anything recently, Mr. Desboro?"</p>

<p>"Out of the depths, yes. The voice in the wilderness as usual
went unheeded. I wished to explain to you how we might give up
our skating and sleighing and everything except the bare necessities&mdash;and
you could still come to Silverwood on business&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What are the 'bare necessities'?"</p>

<p>"Your being here is one&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Answer me seriously, please."</p>

<p>"Food, then. We must eat."</p>

<p>She conceded that much.</p>

<p>"We've got to motor to and from the station!"</p>

<p>She admitted that, too.</p>

<p>"Those," he pointed out, "are the bare necessities. We can give
up everything else."</p>

<p>She sat looking at him, playing absently with her pencil. After
a while, she turned to her desk again, and, bending over it, began
to make meaningless marks with her pencil on the yellow pad.</p>

<p>"What is the object," she said, "of trying to make me forget
that I wouldn't be here at all except on business?"</p>

<p>"Do you think of that every minute?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>must."</p>

<p>"It isn't necessary."</p>

<p>"It is imperative, Mr. Desboro&mdash;and you know it."</p>

<p>She wrote steadily for a while, strapped a bundle of notes with
an elastic band, laid it aside, and turned around, resting her
arm on the back of the chair. Blue eyes level with his, she inspected
him curiously. And, if the tension of excitement still remained,
all her high spirits and the indiscreet impulses of a gay self-confidence
had vanished. But curiosity remained&mdash;the eternal, insatiable
curiosity of the young.</p>

<p>How much did this man really mean of what he said to her? What
did his liking for her signify other than the natural instinct
of an idle young man for any pretty girl? What was he going to
do about it? For she seemed to be conscious that, sooner or later,
somewhere, sometime, he would do something further about it.</p>

<p>Did he mean to make love to her sometime? Was he doing it now?
It resembled the preliminaries; she recognised them&mdash;had been
aware of them almost from the very first.</p>

<p>Men had made love to her before&mdash;men in her own world, men in
his world. She had learned something since her father died&mdash;not
a great deal; perhaps more from hearsay than from experience.
But some unpleasant knowledge had been acquired at first hand;
two clients of her father's had contributed, and a student, named
Harroun, and an amateur of soft paste statuettes, the Rev. Bertie
Dawley.</p>

<p>Innocently and wholesomely equipped to encounter evil, cool and
clear eyed mistress of herself so far, she had felt, with happy
contempt, that her fate was her own to control, and had wondered
what the word "temptation" could mean to any woman.</p>

<p>What Cynthia had admitted made her a little wiser, but still
incredulous. Cold, hunger, debts, loneliness&mdash;these were not enough,
as Cynthia herself had said. Nor, after all, was Cynthia's liking
for Cairns. Which proved conclusively that woman is the arbiter
of her own destiny.</p>

<p>Desboro, one knee crossed over the other, sat looking into the
fire, which burned in the same fireplace where he had recently
immolated the frivolous souvenirs of the past.</p>

<p>Perhaps some gay ghost of that scented sacrifice took shape for
a moment in the curling smoke, for he suddenly frowned and passed
his hand over his eyes in boyish impatience.</p>

<p>Something&mdash;the turn of his head and shoulders&mdash;the shape of them&mdash;she
did not know what&mdash;seemed to set her heart beating loudly, ridiculously,
without any apparent reason on earth. Too much surprised to be
disturbed, she laid her slim hand on her breast, then against
her throat, till her pulses grew calmer.</p>

<p>Resting her chin on her arm, she gazed over her shoulder into
the fire. He had laid another log across the flames; she watched
the bark catch fire, dully conscious, now, that her ideas were
becoming as irresponsible and as reasonless as the sudden stirring
of her heart had been.</p>

<p>For she was thinking how odd it would be if, like Cynthia, she
too, ever came to care about a man of Desboro's sort. She'd see
to it that she didn't; that was all. There were other men. Better
still, there were to be no men; for her mind fastidiously refused
to consider the only sort with whom she felt secure&mdash;her intellectual
inferiors whose moral worthiness bored her to extinction.</p>

<p>Musing there, half turned on her chair, she saw Desboro rise,
still looking intently into the fire, and stand so, his well-made,
graceful figure, in silhouette, edged with the crimson glow.</p>

<p>"What do you see in it, Mr. Desboro?"</p>

<p>He turned instantly and came over to her:</p>

<p>"A bath of flames would be very popular," he said, "if burning
didn't hurt. I was just thinking about it&mdash;how to invent&#11834;"</p>

<p>She quoted: "'But I was thinking of a plan to dye one's whiskers
green.'"</p>

<p>He said: "I suppose you think me as futile as that old man 'a-settin'
on a gate.'"</p>

<p>"Your pursuits seem to be about as useful as his."</p>

<p>"Why should I pursue things? I don't want 'em."</p>

<p>"You are hopeless. There is pleasure even in pursuit of anything,
no matter whether you ever attain it or not. I will never attain
wisdom, but it's a pleasure to pursue it."</p>

<p>"It's a pleasure even to pursue pleasure&mdash;and it's the only pleasure
in pleasure," he said, so gravely that for a moment she thought
with horror that he was trying to be precious. Then the latent
glimmer in his eyes set them laughing, and she rose and went over
to the sofa and curled up in one corner, abandoning all pretense
of industry.</p>

<p>"Once," she said, "I knew a poet who emitted such precious thoughts.
He was the funniest thing; he had the round, pale, ancient eyes
of an African parrot, a pasty countenance, and a derby hat resting
on top of a great bunch of colourless curly hair. And that's the
way <em>he</em> talked, Mr. Desboro!"</p>

<p>He seated himself on the other arm of the sofa:</p>

<p>"Did you adore him?"</p>

<p>"At first. He was a celebrity. He did write some pretty things."</p>

<p>"What woke you up?"</p>

<p>She blushed.</p>

<p>"I thought so," observed Desboro.</p>

<p>"Thought what?"</p>

<p>"That he came out of his trance and made love to you."</p>

<p>"How did you know? Wasn't it dreadful! And he'd always told me
that he had never experienced an emotion except when adoring the
moon. He was a very dreadful young man&mdash;perfectly horrid in his
ideas&mdash;and I sent him about his business very quickly; and I remember
being a little frightened and watching him from the window as
he walked off down the street in his soiled drab overcoat and
the derby hat on his frizzly hair, and his trousers too high on
his ankles&#11834;"</p>

<p>Desboro was so immensely amused at the picture she drew that
her pretty brows unbent and she smiled, too.</p>

<p>"What did he want of you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I didn't fully understand at the time&#11834;" she hesitated, then,
with an angry blush: "He asked me to go to Italy with him. And
he said he couldn't marry me because he had already espoused the
moon!"</p>

<p>Desboro's laughter rang through the old library; and Jacqueline
was not quite certain whether she liked the way he took the matter
or not.</p>

<p>"I know him," said Desboro. "I've seen him about town kissing
women's hands, in company with a larger and fatter one. Isn't
his name Munger?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>"Certainly. And the fat one's name is Waudle. They were a hot
team at fashionable literary stunts&mdash;the Back Alley Club, you
know."</p>

<p>"No, I don't know."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's just silly; a number of fashionable and wealthy young
men and women pin on aprons, now and then, and paint and model
lumps of wet clay in several severely bare studios over some unfragrant
stables. They proudly call it The Back Alley Club."</p>

<p>"Why do you sneer at it?"</p>

<p>"Because it isn't the real thing. It's a strutting ground for
things like Munger and Waudle, and all the rag-tag that is always
sniffing and snuffling at the back doors of the fine arts."</p>

<p>"At least," she said, "they sniff."</p>

<p>He said, good-humouredly: "Yes, and I don't even do that. Is
that what you mean?"</p>

<p>She considered him: "Haven't you any profession?"</p>

<p>"I'm a farmer."</p>

<p>"Why aren't you busy with it, then?"</p>

<p>"I have been, disastrously. There was a sickening deficit this
autumn."</p>

<p>She said, with pretty scorn: "I'll wager I could make your farm
pay."</p>

<p>He smiled lazily, and indulgently. After a moment he said:</p>

<p>"So the spouse of the moon wanted you to go to Italy with him?"</p>

<p>She nodded absently: "A girl meets queer men in the world."</p>

<p>"Did you ever meet any others?"</p>

<p>She looked up listlessly: "Yes, several."</p>

<p>"As funny as the poet?"</p>

<p>"If you call him funny."</p>

<p>"I wonder who they were," he mused.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of the Reverend Bertie Dawley?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"He was one."</p>

<p>"<em>That</em> kind?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. He collects soft paste figurines; he was a client of
father's; but I found very soon that I couldn't go near him. He
has a wife and children, too, and he keeps sending his wife to
call on me. You know he's a good-looking young man, too, and I
liked him; but I never dreamed&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Sure," he said, disgusted at his own sex&mdash;with the exception
of himself.</p>

<p>"That seems to be the way of it," she said thoughtfully. "You
can't be friends with men; they all annoy you sooner or later
in one way or another!"</p>

<p>"Annoy you? Do you mean make love to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> don't; do I?"</p>

<p>She bent her head and sat playing with the petals of the white
carnation drooping on her breast.</p>

<p>"No," she said calmly. "You don't annoy me."</p>

<p>"Would it seriously annoy you if I did make love to you some
day?" he asked, lightly.</p>

<p>Instinct was whispering hurriedly to her: "Here it is at last.
Do something about it, and do it quick!" She waited until her
heart beat more regularly, then:</p>

<p>"You couldn't annoy&mdash;make love&mdash;to a girl you really don't care
for. That is very simple, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Suppose I did care for you."</p>

<p>She looked up at him with troubled eyes, then lowered them to
the blossom from which her fingers were detaching petal after
petal.</p>

<p>"If you did really care, you wouldn't tell me, Mr. Desboro."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because it would not be fair to me." A flush of anger&mdash;or she
thought it was, brightened her cheeks. "This is nonsense," she
said abruptly. "And I'll tell you another thing; I can't come
here again. You know I can't. We talk foolishness&mdash;don't you know
it? And there's another reason, anyway."</p>

<p>"What reason?"</p>

<p>"The <em>real</em> reason," she said, clenching both hands. "You
know what it is and so do <em>I&mdash;</em>and&mdash;and I'm tired of pretending
that the truth isn't true."</p>

<p>"What is the truth?"</p>

<p>She had turned her back on him and was staring out of the windows
into the mist.</p>

<p>"The truth is," she answered deliberately, "that you and I can
not be friends."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because we can't be! Because&mdash;men are always men. There isn't
any way for men and women to be friends. Forgive me for saying
it. But it is quite true. A business woman in your employment&mdash;can't
forget that a real friendship with you is impossible. That is
why, from the very beginning, I wanted it to be purely a matter
of business between us. I didn't really wish to skate with you,
or do anything of that kind with you. I'd rather not lunch with
you; I &mdash;I had rather you drew the line&mdash;and let me draw
it clearly, cleanly, and without mistake&mdash;as I draw it between
myself and my employees. If you wish, I can continue to come here
on that basis until my work is finished. Otherwise, I shall not
come again."</p>

<p>Her back was still toward him.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said, bluntly.</p>

<p>She heard him rise and walk toward the door; sat listening without
turning her head, already regretting what she had said. And now
she became conscious that her honesty with herself and with him
had been a mistake, entailing humiliation for her&mdash;the humiliation
of letting him understand that she couldn't afford to care for
him, and that she did already. She had thought of him first, and
of herself last&mdash;had conceded a hopeless situation in order that
her decision might not hurt his vanity.</p>

<p>It had been a bad mistake. And now he might be thinking that
she had tried to force him into an attitude toward herself which
she could not expect, or &mdash;God knew what he might be thinking.</p>

<p>Dismayed and uncertain, she stood up nervously as he reëntered
the room and came toward her, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"I'm going to town," he said pleasantly. "I won't bother you
any more. Remain; come and go as you like without further fear
of my annoying you. The servants are properly instructed. They
will be at your orders. I'm sorry &mdash;I meant to be more agreeable.
Good-bye, Miss Nevers."</p>

<p>She laid her hand in his, lifelessly, then withdrew it. Dumb,
dreadfully confused, she looked up at him; then, as he turned
coolly away, an inarticulate sound of protest escaped her lips.
He halted and turned around.</p>

<p>"It isn't fair&mdash;what you are doing &mdash;Mr. Desboro."</p>

<p>"What else is there to do?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask me? Why must the burden of decision always rest
with me?"</p>

<p>"But my decision is that I had better go. I can't remain here
without&mdash;annoying you."</p>

<p>"Why can't you remain here as my employer? Why can't we enjoy
matter-of-fact business relations? I ask no more than that &mdash;I
want no more. I am afraid you think I do expect more&mdash;that I expect
friendship. It is impossible, unsuitable&mdash;and I don't even wish
for it&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I do," he said.</p>

<p>"How can we be friends, from a social standpoint? There is nothing
to build on, no foundation&mdash;nothing for friendship to subsist
on&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Could you and I meet anywhere in the world and become <em>less</em>
than friends?" he asked. "Tell me honestly. It is impossible,
and you and I both know it."</p>

<p>And, as she made no reply: "Friends&mdash;more than friends, possibly;
never less. And you know it, and so do I," he said under his breath.</p>

<p>She turned sharply toward the window and looked out across the
foggy hills.</p>

<p>"If that is what you believe, Mr. Desboro, perhaps you had better
go."</p>

<p>"Do you send me?"</p>

<p>"Always the decision seems to lie with me. Why do you not decide
for yourself?"</p>

<p>"I will; and for you, too, if you will let me relieve you of
the burden."</p>

<p>"I can carry my own burdens."</p>

<p>Her back was still toward him. After a moment she rested her
head against the curtained embrasure, as though tired.</p>

<p>He hesitated; there were good impulses in him, but he went over
to her, and scarcely meaning to, put one arm lightly around her
waist.</p>

<p>She laid her hands over her face, standing so, golden head lowered
and her heart so violent that she could scarcely breathe.</p>

<p>"Jacqueline."</p>

<p>A scarcely perceptible movement of her head, in sign that she
listened.</p>

<p>"Are we going to let anything frighten us?" He had not meant
to say that, either. He was adrift, knew it, and meant to drop
anchor in a moment. "Tell me honestly," he added, "don't you want
us to be friends?"</p>

<p>She said, her hands still over her face:</p>

<p>"I didn't know how much I wanted it. I don't see, even now, how
it can be. Your own friends are different. But I'll try&mdash;if you
wish it."</p>

<p>"I do wish it. Why do you think my friends are so different from
you? Because some happen to be fashionable and wealthy and idle?
Besides, a man has many different kinds of friends&#11834;"</p>

<p>She thought to herself: "But he never forgets to distinguish
between them. And here it is at last&mdash;almost. And I &mdash;I do
care for him! And here I am&mdash;like Cynthia&mdash;asking myself to pardon
him."</p>

<p>She looked up at him out of her hands, a little pale, then down
at his arm, resting loosely around her waist.</p>

<p>"Don't hold me so, please," she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Of course not." But instead he merely took her slender hands
between his own, which were not very steady, and looked her straight
in the eyes. Such men can do it, somehow. Besides, he really meant
to control himself and cast anchor in a moment or two.</p>

<p>"Will you trust me with your friendship?" he said.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>seem to be doing it. I don't exactly understand
what I am doing. Would you answer me one question?"</p>

<p>"If I can, Jacqueline."</p>

<p>"Then, friendship <em>is</em> possible between a man and a woman,
isn't it?" she insisted wistfully.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"What! Why don't you know? It's merely a matter of mutual interest
and respect, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I've heard so."</p>

<p>"Then isn't a friendship between us possible without anything
threatening to spoil it? Isn't it to be just a matter of enjoying
together what interests each? Isn't it? Because I don't mind waiving
social conditions that can't be helped, and conventions that we
simply can't observe."</p>

<p>"Yes, you wonderful girl," he said under his breath, meaning
to anchor at once. But he drifted on.</p>

<p>"You know," she said, forcing a little laugh, "I <em>am</em>
rather wonderful, to be so honest with a man like you. There's
so much about you that I don't care for."</p>

<p>He laughed, enchanted, still retaining her hands between his
own, the palms joined together, flat.</p>

<p>"You're so wonderful," he said, "that you make the most wonderful
masterpiece in the Desboro collection look like a forgery."</p>

<p>She strove to speak lightly again: "Even the gilding on my hair
is real. You didn't think so once, did you?"</p>

<p>"You're all real. You are the most real thing I've ever seen
in the world!"</p>

<p>She tried to laugh: "You mustn't believe that I've never before
been real when I've been with you. And I may not be real again,
for a long time. Make the most of this moment of expansive honesty,
Mr. Desboro. I'll remember presently that you are an hereditary
enemy."</p>

<p>"Have I ever acted that part?"</p>

<p>"Not toward me."</p>

<p>He reddened: "Toward whom?"</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, with sudden impatience, "do you suppose I have
any illusions concerning the sort of man you are? But what do
I care, as long as you are nice to me?" she laughed, more confidently.
"Men!" she repeated. "I know something about them! And, knowing
them, also, I nevertheless mean to make a friend of one of them.
Do you think I'll succeed?"</p>

<p>He smiled, then bent lightly and kissed her joined hands.</p>

<p>"Luncheon is served," came the emotionless voice of Farris from
the doorway. Their hands fell apart; Jacqueline blushed to her
hair and gave Desboro a lovely, abashed look.</p>

<p>She need not have been disturbed. Farris had seen such things
before.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>That evening, Desboro went back to New York with her and took
her to her own door in a taxicab.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure you can't dine with me?" he asked again,
as they lingered on her doorstep.</p>

<p>"I could&mdash;but&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But you won't!"</p>

<p>One of her hands lay lightly on the knob of the partly open door,
and she stood so, resting and looking down the dark street toward
the distant glare of electricity where Broadway crossed at right
angles.</p>

<p>"We have been together all day, Mr. Desboro. I'd rather not dine
with you&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>"Are you going to dine all alone up there?" glancing aloft at
the lighted windows above the dusky old shop.</p>

<p>"Yes. Besides, you and I have wasted so much time to-day that
I shall go down stairs to the office and do a little work after
dinner. You see a girl always has to pay for her transgressions."</p>

<p>"I'm terribly sorry," he said contritely. "Don't work to-night!"</p>

<p>"Don't be sorry. I've really enjoyed to-day's laziness. Only
it mustn't be like this to-morrow. And anyway, I knew I'd have
to make it up to-night."</p>

<p>"I'm terribly sorry," he said again, almost tenderly.</p>

<p>"But you mustn't be, Mr. Desboro. It was worth it&#11834;"</p>

<p>He looked up, surprised, flushing with emotion; and the quick
colour in her cheeks responded. They remained very still, and
confused, and silent, as fire answered fire; suddenly aware how
fast they had been drifting.</p>

<p>She turned, nervously, pushed open the door, and entered the
vestibule; he held the door ajar for her while she fitted her
key with unsteady fingers.</p>

<p>"So&mdash;thank you," she said, half turning around, "but I won't
dine with you&mdash;to-night."</p>

<p>"Then, perhaps, to-morrow&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don't come into town with me to-morrow, Mr. Desboro."</p>

<p>"I'm coming in anyway."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"There's an affair&mdash;a kind of a dance. There are always plenty
of things to take me into town in the evenings."</p>

<p>"Is that why you came in to-night?" She knew she should not have
said it.</p>

<p>He hesitated, then, with a laugh: "I came in to town because
it gave me an hour longer with you. Are you going to send me away
now?" And her folly was answered in kind.</p>

<p>She said, confused and trying to smile: "You say things that
you don't mean. Evening, for us, must always mean 'good-night.'"</p>

<p>"Why, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"Because. Also, it is my hour of freedom. You wouldn't take that
away from me, would you?"</p>

<p>"What do you do in the evenings?"</p>

<p>"Sew, read, study, attend to the thousand wretched little details
which concern my small household. And, sometimes, when I have
wasted the day, I make it up at night. Because, whether I have
enjoyed it or not, this day <em>has</em> been wasted."</p>

<p>"But sometimes you dine out and go to the theatre and to dances
and things?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said gravely. "But you know there is no meeting ground
there for us, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't you ask me to something?"</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;I could. But you wouldn't care for the people. You
know it. They are not like the people to whom you are accustomed.
They would only bore you."</p>

<p>"So do many people I know."</p>

<p>"Not in the same way. Why do you ask me? You know it is better
not." She added smilingly: "There is neither wealth nor fashion
nor intellectual nor social distinction to be expected among my
friends&#11834;"</p>

<p>She hesitated, and added quietly: "You understand that I am not
criticising them. I am merely explaining them to you. Otherwise,
I'd ask you to dinner with a few people &mdash;I can only have
four at a time, my dining room is so small&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Ask me, Jacqueline!" he insisted.</p>

<p>She shook her head; but he continued to coax and argue until
she had half promised. And now she stood, facing him irresolutely,
conscious of the steady drift that was forcing her into uncharted
channels with this persuasive pilot who seemed to know no more
of what lay ahead of them than did she.</p>

<p>But there was to be no common destination; she understood that.
Sooner or later she must turn back toward the harbour they had
left so irresponsibly together, her brief voyage over, her last
adventure with this man ended for all time.</p>

<p>And now, as the burden of decision still seemed to rest upon
her, she offered him her hand, saying good-night; and he took
it once more and held it between both of his. Instantly the impending
constraint closed in upon them; his face became grave, hers serious,
almost apprehensive.</p>

<p>"You have&mdash;have made me very happy," he said. "Do you know it,
Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>A curious lassitude was invading her; she leaned sideways against
the door frame, as though tired, and stood so, one hand abandoned
to him, gazing into the lamp-lit street.</p>

<p>"Good-night, dear," he whispered.</p>

<p>"Good-night."</p>

<p>She still gazed into the lamp-lit darkness beyond him, her hand
limp in his; and he saw her blue eyes, heavy lidded and dreamy,
and the strand of hair curling gold against her cheek.</p>

<p>When he kissed her, she dropped her head, covering her face with
her forearm, not otherwise stirring&mdash;as though the magic pageant
of her fate which had been gathering for two weeks had begun to
move at last, passing vision-like through her mind with a muffled
uproar&mdash;sweeping on, on, brilliant, disarrayed, timed by the deafening
beating of her heart.</p>

<p>Dully she realised that it was here at last&mdash;all that she had
dreaded&mdash;if dread be partly made of hope!</p>

<p>"Are you crying?" he said, unsteadily.</p>

<p>She lifted her face from her arm, like a dazed child awaking.</p>

<p>"You darling," he whispered.</p>

<p>Eyes remote, she stood watching unseen things in the darkness
beyond him.</p>

<p>"Must I go, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You are very tired, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You won't sit up and work, will you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Will you go straight to bed?"</p>

<p>She nodded slowly, yielding to him as he drew her into his arms.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, then?" he asked under his breath.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And the next day, and the next, and next, and&mdash;always, Jacqueline?"
he demanded, almost fiercely.</p>

<p>After a moment she slowly turned her head and looked at him.
There was no answer, and no question in her gaze, only the still,
expressionless clairvoyance of a soul that sees but does not heed.</p>

<p>There was no misunderstanding in her eyes, nothing wistful, nothing
afraid or hurt&mdash;nothing of doubt. What had happened to others
in the world was happening now to her. She understood it; that
was all&mdash;as though the millions of her sisters who had passed
that way had left to her the dread legacy of familiarity with
the smooth, wide path they had trodden since time began on earth.
And here it was, at last! Her own calmness surprised her.</p>

<p>He detained her for another moment in a swift embrace; inert,
unresponsive, she stood looking down at the crushed gardenia in
his buttonhole, dully conscious of being bruised. Then he let
her go; her hand fell from his arm; she turned and faced the familiar
stairs and mounted them.</p>

<p>Dinner waited for her; whether she ate or not, she could not
afterward remember. About eleven o'clock, she rose wearily from
the bed where she had been lying, and began to undress.</p>

</div>
<p>As for Desboro, he had gone straight to his rooms very much excited
and unbalanced by the emotions of the moment.</p>

<p>He was a man not easily moved to genuine expression. Having acquired
certain sorts of worldly wisdom in a career more or less erratic,
experience had left him unconvinced and even cynical&mdash;or he thought
it had.</p>

<p>But now, for the moment, all that lay latent in him of that impetuous
and heedless vigour which may become strength, if properly directed,
was awakening. Every recurring memory of her had already begun
to tamper with his self-control; for the emotions of the moments
just ended had been confusingly real; and, whatever they were
arousing in him, now clamoured for some sort of expression.</p>

<p>The very thought of her, now, began to act on him like some freshening
perfume alternately stimulating and enervating. He made the effort
again and again, and could not put her from his mind, could not
forget the lowered head and the slender, yielding grace of her,
and her fragrance, and her silence.</p>

<p>Dressing in his rooms, growing more restless every moment, he
began to walk the floor like some tormented thing that seeks alleviation
in purposeless activity.</p>

<p>He said, half aloud, to himself:</p>

<p>"I can't go on this way. This is damn foolish! I've got to find
out where it's landing me. It will land her, too&mdash;somewhere. I'd
better keep away from her, go off somewhere, get out, stop seeing
her, stop remembering her!&mdash;if she's what I think she is."</p>

<p>Scowling, he went to the window and jerked aside the curtain.
Across the street, the Olympian Club sparkled with electricity.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he muttered. "What a tempest in a teapot! What the
devil's the matter with me? Can't I kiss a girl now and then and
keep my senses?"</p>

<p>It seemed that he couldn't, in the present instance, for after
he had bitten the amber stem of his pipe clean through, he threw
the bowl into the fireplace. It had taken him two years to colour
it.</p>

<p>"Idiot!" he said aloud. "What are you sorry about? You know damn
well there are only two kinds of women, and it's up to them what
sort they are&mdash;not up to any man who ever lived! What are you
sorry for? For her?"</p>

<p>He stared across the street at the Olympian Club. He was expected
there.</p>

<p>"If she only wasn't so&mdash;so expressionless and&mdash;silent about it.
It's like killing something that lets you do it. That's a crazy
thing to think of!"</p>

<p>Suddenly he found he had a fight on his hands. He had never had
one like it; didn't know exactly what to do, except to repeat
over and over:</p>

<p>"It isn't square&mdash;it isn't square. She knows it, too. She's frightened.
She knows it isn't square. There's nothing ahead but hell to pay!
She knows it. And she doesn't defend herself. There <em>are</em>
only two kinds of women. It <em>is</em> up to them, too. But it's
like killing something that lets you kill it. Good God! What a
damn fool I am!"</p>

<p>Later he repeated it. Later still he found himself leaning over
his desk, groping blindly about for a pen, and cursing breathlessly
as though he had not a moment to lose.</p>

<p>He wrote:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"<em>DEAR LITTLE JACQUELINE: I'</em>m not going to see you again. Where the<br/>
fool courage to write this comes from I don't know. But you will<br/>
now learn that there is nothing to me after all&mdash;not even enough of<br/>
positive and negative to make me worth forgiveness. And so I let it<br/>
go at that. Good-bye.

</p>
</div>
<p>  "<em>DESBORO</em>."</p>

<p>In the same half blind, half dazed way, cursing something all
the while, he managed to seal, stamp, and direct the letter, and
get himself out of the house with it.</p>

<p>A club servant at the Olympian mailed it; he continued on his
way to the dining room, and stumbled into a chair between Cairns
and Reggie Ledyard, who were feasting noisily and unwisely with
Stuyvesant Van Alstyne; and the racket and confusion seemed to
help him. He was conscious of laughing and talking and drinking
a great deal&mdash;conscious, too, of the annoyance of other men at
other tables. Finally, one of the governors came over and very
pleasantly told him to shut up or go elsewhere.</p>

<p>They all went, with cheerfulness unimpaired by gubernatorial
admonition. There was a large dinner dance for debutantes at the
Barkley's. This function they deigned to decorate with their presence
for a while, Cairns and Van Alstyne behaving well enough, considering
the manners of the times; Desboro, a dull fire smouldering in
his veins, wandered about, haunted by a ghost whose soft breath
touched his cheek.</p>

<p>His manners were good when he chose; they were always faultless
when he was drunk. Perfectly steady on his legs, very pale, and
a trifle over polite, the drunker he was the more courtly he invariably
became, measuredly graceful, in speech reticent. Only his pallor
and the lines about his mouth betrayed the tension.</p>

<p>Later, one or two men familiar with the house strolled into the
distant billiard room and discovered him standing there looking
blankly into space.</p>

<p>Ledyard, bad tempered when he had dined too well, announced that
he had had enough of that debutante party:</p>

<p>"Look at 'em," he said to Desboro. "Horrible little fluffs just
out of the incubator&mdash;with their silly brains and rotten manners,
and their 'Bunny Hugs' and 'Turkey Trots' and 'Dying Chickens,'
and the champagne flaming in their baby cheeks! Why, their mothers
are letting 'em dance like <em>filles de Brasserie</em>! Men used
to know where to go for that sort of thing&#11834;"</p>

<p>Cairns, balancing gravely on heels and toes, waved one hand comprehensively.</p>

<p>"Problem was," he said, "how to keep the young at home. Bunny
Hug solves it. See? All the comforts of the Tenderloin at home.
Tha's 'splaination."</p>

<p>"Come on to supper," said Ledyard. "Your Blue Girl will be there,
Jim."</p>

<p>"By all means," said Desboro courteously. "My car is entirely
at your disposal." But he made no movement.</p>

<p>"Come to supper," insisted Ledyard.</p>

<p>"Commer supper," echoed Cairns gravely. "Whazzer mazzer? Commer
supper!"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Desboro, "could give me greater pleasure." He
rose, bowed courteously to Ledyard, included Cairns in a graceful
salute, and reseated himself.</p>

<p>Ledyard lost his temper and began to shout at him.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for my inexcusable absent-mindedness," said
Desboro, getting slowly onto his feet once more. With graceful
precision, he made his way to his hostess and took faultless leave
of her, Cairns and Ledyard attempting vainly to imitate his poise,
urbanity and self-possession.</p>

<p>The icy air of the street did Cairns good and aided Ledyard.
So they got themselves out across the sidewalk and ultimately
into Desboro's town car, which was waiting, as usual.</p>

<p>"Little bunny-hugging, bread-and-butter beasts," muttered Ledyard
to himself. "Lord! Don't they want us to draw the line between
them and the sort we're to meet at supper?"</p>

<p>"They're jus' fools," said Cairns. "No harm in 'em! And I'm not
going to supper. I'll take you there an' go'me!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with <em>you</em>?" demanded Ledyard.</p>

<p>"No &mdash;I'm through, that's all. You 'sult nice li'l debutantes.
Rotten bad taste. Nice li'l debbys."</p>

<p>"Come on, you jinx!"</p>

<p>"That girl in blue. Will she be there&mdash;the one who does the lute
solo in 'The Maid of Shiraz'?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but she's crazy about Desboro."</p>

<p>"I waive all pretension to the charming condescension of that
very lovely young lady, and cheerfully concede your claims," said
Desboro, raising his hat and wrecking it against the roof of the
automobile.</p>

<p>"As you wish, dear friend. But why so suddenly the solitary recluse?"</p>

<p>"A personal reason, I assure you."</p>

<p>"I see," remarked Ledyard. "And what may be the name and quality
of this personal reason? And is she a blonde?"</p>

<p>Desboro shrugged his polite impatience. But when the others got
out at the Santa Regina he followed. Cairns was inclined to shed
a few tears over Ledyard's insults to the "debbys."</p>

<p>"Sure," said the latter, soothingly. "The brimming beaker for
you, dear friend, and it will pass away. Hark! I hear the fairy
feetsteps of a houri!" as they landed from the elevator and encountered
a group of laughing, bright-eyed young girls in the hallway, seeking
the private supper room.</p>

<p>One of them was certainly the girl in blue. The others appeared
to Desboro as merely numerous and, later, exceedingly noisy. But
noise and movement seemed to make endurable the dull pain thudding
ceaselessly in his heart. Music and roses, flushed faces, the
ringing harmony of crystal and silver, and the gaiety <em>à diable</em>
of the girl beside him would ease it&mdash;<em>must</em> ease it, somehow.
For it had to be first eased, then killed. There was no sense,
no reason, no excuse for going on this way&mdash;enduring such a hurt.
And just at present the remedy seemed to lie in a gay uproar and
many brilliant lights, and in the tinted lips of the girl beside
him, babbling nonsense while her dark eyes laughed, promising
all they laughed at&mdash;if he cared to ask an answer to the riddle.</p>

<p>But he never asked it.</p>

<p>Later somebody offered a toast to Desboro, but when they looked
around for him in the uproar, glasses aloft, he had disappeared.</p>
