<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>One keen, sunny afternoon in autumn, a certain Indian youth executed
a war dance among the foothills to the east of the Rocky Mountains.
The only spectator of the fantastic performance was a superb black
stallion, who, so far as can be judged, found a good deal of entertainment
in the sight. It was long before the days of kodaks and their
snapshots, which add so much to our enjoyment of everyday incidents.</p>

<p>Although Deerfoot did not waste any time, it took him a fortnight
to thread his way through that immense range which ribs the western
part of our continent. After using the last of the crimson berries
that benefited his sprain so much, he spent several hours in hunting
for the herb; but search high and low as much as he might, he
not only failed to find it, but was never able to discover the
fruit in any part of the West.</p>

<p>On the morning following his first encampment in the mountain
pass he found himself strong enough, by using care, to walk upon
the hurt ankle. He was too wise to push matters too fast, which
fact, added to his perfect physical condition and the effect of
the herb, carried him swiftly along the road to recovery. At the
end of a week not a trace of lameness remained. He was cured.</p>

<p>His prudence restrained him until he emerged from the mountain
proper into the foothills, when, knowing he was as strong as ever,
he indulged in the exuberant outburst. Leaving his blanket upon
the back of Whirlwind, but holding his rifle in one hand, Deerfoot
leaped into the air, spun around first on one foot and then the
other, sent his shapely legs flying seemingly in a dozen different
directions at the same moment, swung his arms, bent his body,
cavorted and made contortions that would have honored a professional
acrobat. Not only that, but he punctuated the extravagant display
by a series of whoops such as had nerved the Shawanoe warriors
many a time to rush into battle.</p>

<p>All this time Whirlwind stood calmly watching the performance.
It is reasonable to believe he was interested, and had he possessed
the power of laughter he would have thrown back his head and "cracked
his sides" at the sight. What a pity that George and Victor Shelton
could not have peeped out from some concealment. They would have
remembered the picture all their lives.</p>

<p>Only by this grotesque exercise could the young Shawanoe find
vent for his overflowing spirits. There is nothing in all the
world that can take the place of physical vigor and health&mdash;a
truth which unnumbered thousands do not realize until too late.
Temperance, right living, obedience to the laws of hygiene, and
a clear conscience, never fail to bring their reward and to give
to this life a foretaste of the blessed one to come.</p>

<p>Deerfoot had chosen an open space, walled in by rocks, boulders
and stunted undergrowth for his physical outburst. When the performance
had gone on for some time, he danced up to the side of Whirlwind
and planted one of his feet against his ribs so sharply that the
stallion was forced back for a step. Instantly he wheeled, partly
reared and struck at his insulter, but he was so afraid of hitting
him that the blow was awkward and missed the Shawanoe by a goodly
distance. As he dropped on his feet, Deerfoot darted under his
belly and repeated the blow from the other side. The white teeth
of the steed snapped within a few inches of the shoulder of the
youth, who slapped the nose before it could be withdrawn.</p>

<p>Whirlwind wheeled to face his master, who landed lightly on his
back and pounded his sides with his heels. The contest recalled
that other struggle between the two, months before on the prairie,
when it was a battle royal indeed. But the great difference lay
in the fact that the present one was good-natured on both sides,
and it is easy to believe that the stallion wished the youth to
prove himself once again his master. An intelligent animal loves
to obey him who has proved his superiority.</p>

<p>There is no telling all that was done by the Shawanoe. He sharply
pinched the glossy hide. He griped the nostrils of the steed as
if to shut off his breath, but was too considerate to continue
this long, since the horse seems unable to breathe through his
mouth. He placed his hand and forearm over the eyes of Whirlwind
as if he meant to play blind-man's buff with him. He yanked the
forelock and reproached him as being of no account.</p>

<p>The stallion did his part in the way of defense and retaliation,
but he was continually handicapped by his dread of hurting his
master. And yet it would seem that, recalling that other conflict,
he ought to have had no such apprehension, for he had done his
best on that occasion to kill the Indian youth, who was not harmed
at all, and overcame the creature that possessed ten times his
strength.</p>

<p>Whirlwind showed signs of fatigue before Deerfoot did. A comparatively
clear path stretched in front. Dropping from the back of the horse,
the Shawanoe challenged him to a race. Bounding off at his highest
bent, the youth dashed across the country with the speed of the
wind. He ran as he did when on the second half of his race with
Ralph Genther.</p>

<p>Ah, Whirlwind had him now! No danger of hurting his audacious
master, except so far as his feelings were concerned, and the
stallion did not spare them. Despite the favorable ground, more
than one boulder or bunch of matted undergrowth had to be leaped,
and the two went over them like a couple of flying birds. But
the steed steadily drew away from the fleet Shawanoe, who at the
end of two or three hundred yards, finding himself hopelessly
to the rear, gave up.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is only a child when he races with Whirlwind; have
mercy on him."</p>

<p>Hearing his call, the steed ceased his running, wheeled about
and waited for his master to come up. Deerfoot patted him affectionately
and vaulted upon his back, happy as he could be over the triumph
of his matchless animal that was as well pleased as he.</p>

<p>The journey through the Rocky Mountains was accompanied by many
interesting experiences which cannot be dwelt upon. It need hardly
be said that so peerless a hunter as the young Shawanoe never
lacked for food. That region is still a royal one for game, and
it was such to a more marked degree a century ago. Antelope, deer,
bison and the famous Rocky Mountain sheep were often seen, and
when Deerfoot felt the need of the food it was simple sport to
obtain it.</p>

<p>One day, while walking in front of Whirlwind, he came upon an
enormous grizzly bear that seemed disposed to dispute their way.
The stallion trembled with fear, but his master soothed him and
prepared for a desperate fight. Deerfoot never killed an animal
in wantonness, and, though he did not doubt that he could overcome
this colossal terror, he preferred to make a detour of the broad
pass and leave him undisputed monarch of the solitude.</p>

<p>But, if the youth showed mercy to animals, he was not so considerate
of reptiles&mdash;especially when they crawled the earth. He detested
a serpent with unspeakable disgust, and believed he was doing
good work in reducing, as opportunity presented, the noxious pests.
His experience with the rattlesnake which caused his wrenched
ankle did not lessen this hatred of the species. When, therefore,
a warning rattle told him one afternoon that he had disturbed
another of the venomous things beside the path, his enmity flared
up. No fear of the Shawanoe being caught unawares, as when climbing
the wall of the ca√±on, for he had slain too many of the reptiles
in his distant home not to understand their nature. Whirlwind,
like all of his kind, had a mortal dread of every species of serpents,
and he showed his timidity the moment the locust-like whirring
sounded from the bush at the side of the path the two were following.</p>

<p>Deerfoot caught sight of the hideous reptile, which was evidently
gliding over the earth when it detected his approach. It instantly
threw itself into coil, and with its flat triangular head upraised
and slowly oscillating back and forth, waited for the intruder
to come within reach of its deadly fangs.</p>

<p>Deerfoot uttered an expression of astonishment, for it was the
largest specimen upon which he had ever looked, and he had seen
many of enormous size. He stood for a few minutes, surveying the
horrible thing, a single bite from which would have been fatal
to man or animal.</p>

<p>It would have been easy to clip off its head with a rifle shot
from where he stood, but he scorned to waste powder and ball upon
its species. Three stones, almost the size of his fist, did the
work effectually. When no semblance of life remained, Deerfoot
approached nigh enough to count the rattles. They were twenty-eight
in number. The time was near for serpents and bears to take to
winter quarters, and the fate of this extraordinary <em>crotalus</em>
forcibly illustrated the truth that delays are often dangerous.</p>

<p>Several times on the road, Deerfoot met those of his own race.
Sometimes they were warriors riding their ponies, and again they
were on foot. The Indian seems to be migratory by nature, and
many of these families were shifting their homes, apparently in
obedience to the yearning for change which is not confined to
uncivilized people alone. It is worthy of note that the Shawanoe
not once had any trouble with these strangers. They were hospitable
and made their meaning known by the universal sign language. Whirlwind
could not fail to draw much admiration, and Deerfoot saw more
than one envious eye cast on the stallion. It may have been due
to the Shawanoe's caution and tact that no attempt was made to
rob him of his treasure.</p>

<p>Winter was near, and, though only one or two flurries of snow
were encountered, the temperature often sank below the freezing
point. Soon after entering the foothills a driving storm of sleet
set in which stopped progress on the part of the Shawanoe and
his horse. The youth sought out the most sheltered nook he could
find among the rocks and kept a fire going. While he felt no discomfort
himself, his companion suffered considerably. He often slept on
his feet, but now and then lay down. Deerfoot compelled him to
share his blanket, and this, with the warmth of the blaze, did
much to make the steed comfortable. It was difficult at times
for him to obtain grazing, and Deerfoot gave him aid, as he did
months before, when suffering from his lamed knee.</p>

<p>Several days later the youth left the side of the stallion and
climbed to the top of a rocky elevation, which commanded an extensive
view in every direction. His eye had roved over the expanse but
a few minutes when it rested on an Indian village that lay a dozen
miles to the northeast. Adjusting the spyglass he carefully studied
the collection of tepees, which numbered about a hundred, scattered
over several acres. At the rear stretched a forest, and in front
flowed a large, winding stream that eventually found its outlet
in some of the tributaries of the Missouri.</p>

<p>The question with the Shawanoe was whether or not this was the
village he was seeking. Since he had never seen it before, and
since it was the custom of all Indian tribes to locate near running
water, he could not make certain on that point from the description
given by Mul-tal-la.</p>

<p>The glass was an excellent one, and through its aid he could
discern the figures of people moving aimlessly hither and thither.
He saw two men enter a canoe, formed from a hollowed log, and
paddle to the other side of the stream, where they stepped out
and advanced into a rocky wood. He thought one of these warriors
carried a gun and the other a bow, but could not assure himself
on that point. At the rear of the village, in a large open space,
fully a score of boys and girls were playing with as much vigor
as if they were civilized. They seemed to have a ball that was
knocked to and fro and chased by the happy contestants, who often
tumbled over one another and again were piled up like so many
foot-ball players.</p>

<p>Knowing he might gaze and speculate for hours without gaining
any certain knowledge, Deerfoot was about to lower his instrument
when he observed three horsemen emerging from the settlement and
riding in Indian file toward him. He decided to go forward and
meet them, for they could give the information he was so anxious
to obtain.</p>

<p>Within the following hour the Shawanoe, riding Whirlwind, came
face to face with the horsemen, whom he recognized from their
dress and general appearance as Blackfeet. He saluted and addressed
them in their own tongue, causing manifest surprise. They replied
to his signs and expressions of good-will and checked their animals
to hear what he had to say. Let us interpret the conversation
with more than usual freedom.</p>

<p>"Do my brothers belong to the Blackfoot tribe of red men?" asked
Deerfoot.</p>

<p>"We are of that tribe," replied the one who acted as leader.</p>

<p>"I come from the Shawanoes, who live a long way toward the rising
sun."</p>

<p>"Why does the Shawanoe travel so far from the lodges of his people?"</p>

<p>"I am seeking friends who are with the Blackfeet. They left many
moons ago, but parted company with me in the land of the Nez Perces.
I am trying to join them. They are two pale-faced lads who have
as their guide a good Blackfoot, Mul-tal-la, that has made the
long journey to the home of the Shawanoes."</p>

<p>Upon hearing these words the latter turned his head and spoke
for several minutes to his companions, but his words were so low
that Deerfoot could not overhear them.</p>

<p>"Is Mul-tal-la in the home of my brothers?"</p>

<p>"No," was the response. "He does not live there."</p>

<p>"Where does he live?"</p>

<p>Instead of directly answering this question the Blackfoot leader
said:</p>

<p>"He lives in another village. What is the name of his chief?"</p>

<p>"He told me it was Taggarak."</p>

<p>"He is the great war chief of the Blackfeet. There is no sachem
or chief like him. His arm is powerful and has slain many Assiniboines
and Nez Perces and Shoshones."</p>

<p>"The words of my brothers were told to me long ago by Mul-tal-la.
I am sure they are true. Where shall I seek Taggarak?"</p>

<p>The Blackfoot pointed to the northwest.</p>

<p>"Ride that way till night comes and the sun is again overhead,
and he will look upon the village of Taggarak and the home of
Mul-tal-la."</p>

<p>This was acceptable information, but a vague fear caused Deerfoot
to inquire further.</p>

<p>"Have my brothers seen Mul-tal-la since he came home from his
long journey?"</p>

<p>"No; we have heard that he has come back, but he did not bring
his comrade with him."</p>

<p>"Have my brothers met the pale-faced youths who went to the village
of Taggarak?"</p>

<p>"No; we have not seen them, nor have we heard of them."</p>

<p>This was discomforting news, for it would seem that if tidings
had come of the return of Mul-tal-la, something also would have
been said of his companions, who belonged to another race. Deerfoot
asked only a few more questions, when he bade the Blackfeet good-bye
and set out to hunt the village of the war chief Taggarak, where,
if all had gone well, he would meet Mul-tal-la and the brothers,
George and Victor Shelton.</p>
