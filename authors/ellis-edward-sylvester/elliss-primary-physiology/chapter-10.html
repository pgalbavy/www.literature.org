<p>The following method is recommended by Marshall Hall, a very
high authority on all such questions:</p>

<p>"Treat the patient instantly on the spot, in the open air, freely
exposing the face, neck, and chest to the breeze except in very
cold weather.</p>

<p>"In order to clear the throat, place the patient gently on the
face, with one wrist under the forehead, that all fluid, and the
tongue itself, may fall forward, and leave the entrance into the
windpipe free.</p>

<p>"To excite respiration, turn the patient slightly on his side,
and apply some irritating or stimulating agent to the nostrils,
such as hartshorn.</p>

<p>"Make the face warm by brisk friction: then dash cold water upon
it.</p>

<p>"If not successful, lose no time; but, to imitate respiration,
place the patient on his face, and turn the body gently, but completely
on the side, and a little beyond; then again on the face, and
so on, alternately.</p>

<p>"Repeat these movements deliberately and perseveringly, fifteen
times only in a minute. (When the patient lies on the thorax,
this cavity is compressed by the weight of the body, and expiration
takes place. When he is turned on the side, this pressure is removed,
and inspiration occurs.)</p>

<p>"When the prone position is resumed, make a uniform and efficient
pressure along the spine, removing the pressure immediately, before
rotation on the side. (The pressure augments the expiration; the
rotation commences inspiration.) Continue these measures.</p>

<p>"Rub the limbs upward, with firm pressure and with energy. (The
object being the return of venous blood to the heart.)</p>

<p>"Substitute for the patient's wet clothing, if possible, such
other clothing as can be instantly procured, each by-stander supplying
a coat or cloak, etc. Meantime, and from time to time, to excite
inspiration, let the surface of the body be slapped briskly with
the hand.</p>

<p>"Rub the body briskly till it is dry and warm, then dash cold
water upon it, and repeat the rubbing.</p>

<p>"Avoid the immediate removal of the patient, as it involves a
dangerous loss of time; also, the use of bellows, or any forcing
instrument; also, the warm bath and all rough treatment."</p>

<p>  Describe the first step recommended by Marshall Hall in the
case of   asphyxia from drowning, chloroform, coal-gas, etc.</p>

<p>  How would you clear the throat?</p>

<p>  How is respiration or breathing excited?</p>

<p>  What should be done to the face?</p>

<p>  If not successful in reviving the patient, what should be done
to   excite respiration?</p>

<p>  How often should this movement be repeated?</p>

<p>  Explain how respiration is produced by this proceeding.</p>

<p>  What is the next step? Explain its meaning.</p>

<p>  What should be done with the limbs? What is the object?</p>

<p>  What of the patient's wet clothing? What should be done from
time to   time?</p>

<p>  What else is recommended to be done?</p>

<p>  What should be avoided?</p>

<p>  Now, give every step to be taken in resuscitating persons by
Hall's   method. </p>
