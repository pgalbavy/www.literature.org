<P>
On the following morning Mr. Coulson received what he termed his
mail from America. Locked in his room on the fifth floor of the
hotel, he carefully perused the contents of several letters. A
little later he rang and ordered his bill. At four o'clock he
left the Gare du Nord for London.
<P>
Like many other great men, Mr. Coulson was not without his
weakness. He was brave, shrewd, and far-seeing. He enjoyed
excellent health, and he scarcely knew the meaning of the word
nerves. Nevertheless he suffered from seasickness. The first
thing he did, therefore, when aboard the boat at Boulogne, was to
bespeak a private cabin. The steward to whom he made his
application shook his head with regret. The last two had just
been engaged. Mr. Coulson tried a tip, and then a larger tip,
with equal lack of success. He was about to abandon the effort
and retire gloomily to the saloon, when a man who had been
standing by, wrapped in a heavy fur overcoat, intervened.
<P>
"I am afraid, sir," he said, "that it is I who have just secured
the last cabin. If you care to share it with me, however, I shall
be delighted. As a matter of fact, I use it very little myself.
The night has turned out so fine that I shall probably promenade
all the time."
<P>
"If you will allow me to divide the expense," Mr. Coulson
replied, "I shall be exceedingly obliged to you, and will accept
your offer. I am, unfortunately, a bad sailor."
<P>
"That is as you will, sir," the gentleman answered. "The amount
is only trifling."
<P>
The night was a bright one, but there was a heavy sea running,
and even in the harbor the boat was rocking. Mr. Coulson groaned
as he made his way across the threshold of the cabin.
<P>
"I am going to have a horrible time," he said frankly. "I am
afraid you'll repent your offer before you've done with me."
<P>
His new friend smiled.
<P>
"I have never been seasick in my life," he said, "and I only
engage a cabin for fear of wet weather. A fine night like this I
shall not trouble you, so pray be as ill as you like."
<P>
"It's nothing to laugh at," Mr. Coulson remarked gloomily.
<P>
"Let me give you a little advice," his friend said, "and I can
assure you that I know something of these matters, for I have
been on the sea a great deal. Let me mix you a stiff brandy and
soda. Drink it down and eat only a dry biscuit. I have some
brandy of my own here."
<P>
"Nothing does me any good," Mr. Coulson groaned.
<P>
"This," the stranger remarked, producing a flask from his case
and dividing the liquor into equal parts, "may send you to sleep.
If so, you'll be across before you wake up. "Here's luck!"
<P>
Mr. Coulson drained his glass. His companion was in the act of
raising his to his lips when the ship gave a roll, his elbow
caught the back of a chair, and the tumbler slipped from his
fingers.
<P>
"It's of no consequence," he declared, ringing for the steward.
"I'll go into the smoking room and get a drink. I was only going
to have some to keep you company. As a matter of fact, I prefer
whiskey."
<P>
Mr. Coulson sat down upon the berth. He seemed indisposed for
speech.
<P>
"I'll leave you now, then," his friend said, buttoning his coat
around him. "You lie flat down on your back, and I think you'll
find yourself all right."
<P>
"That brandy," Mr. Coulson muttered, "was infernally--- strong."
<P>
His companion smiled and went out. In a quarter of an hour he
returned and locked the door. They were out in the Channel now,
and the boat was pitching heavily. Mr. James B. Coulson, however,
knew nothing of it. He was sleeping like one who wakes only for
the Judgment Day. Over his coat and waistcoat the other man's
fingers travelled with curious dexterity. The oilskin case in
which Mr. Coulson was in the habit of keeping his private
correspondence was reached in a very few minutes. The stranger
turned out the letters and read them, one by one, until he came
to the one he sought. He held it for a short time in his hand,
looked at the address with a faint smile, and slipped his fingers
lightly along the gummed edge of the envelope.
<P>
"No seal," he said softly to himself. "My friend Mr. Coulson
plays the game of travelling agent to perfection."
<P>
He glided out of the cabin with the letter in his hand. In about
ten minutes he returned. Mr. Coulson was still sleeping. He
replaced the letter, pressing down the envelope carefully.
<P>
"My friend," he whispered, looking down upon Mr. Coulson's uneasy
figure, "on the whole, I have been perhaps a little premature. I
think you had better deliver this document to its proper
destination. If only there was to have been a written answer, we
might have met again! It would have been most interesting."
<P>
He slipped the oilskin case back into the exact position in which
he had found it, and watched his companion for several minutes in
silence. Then he went to his dressing bag and from a phial mixed
a little draught. Lifting the sleeping man's head, he forced it
down his throat.
<P>
"I think," he said, "I think, Mr. Coulson, that you had better
wake up."
<P>
He unlocked the door and resumed his promenade of the deck. In
the bows he stood for some time, leaning with folded arms against
a pillar, his eyes fixed upon the line of lights ahead. The great
waves now leaped into the moonlight, the wind sang in the rigging
and came booming across the waters, the salt spray stung his
cheeks. High above his head, the slender mast, with its Marconi
attachment, swang and dived, reached out for the stars, and fell
away with a shudder. The man who watched, stood and dreamed until
the voyage was almost over. Then he turned on his heel and went
back to see how his cabin companion was faring.
<P>
Mr. Coulson was sitting on the edge of his bunk. He had awakened
with a terrible headache and a sense of some hideous
indiscretion. It was not until he had examined every paper in his
pocket and all his money that he had begun to feel more
comfortable. And in the meantime he had forgotten altogether to
be seasick.
<P>
"Well, how has the remedy worked?" the stranger inquired.
<P>
Mr. Coulson looked him in the face. Then he drew a short breath
of relief. He had been indiscreet, but he had alarmed himself
unnecessarily. There was nothing about the appearance of the
quiet, dark little man, with the amiable eyes and slightly
foreign manner, in the least suspicious.
<P>
"It's given me a brute of a headache," he declared, "but I
certainly haven't been seasick up till now, and I must say I've
never crossed before without being ill."
<P>
The stranger laughed soothingly.
<P>
"That brandy and soda would keep you right." He said. "When we
get to Folkestone, you'll be wanting a supper basket. Make
yourself at home. I don't need the cabin. It's a glorious night
outside. I shouldn't have come in at all except to see how you
were getting on."
<P>
"How long before we are in?" Mr. Coulson asked.
<P>
"About a quarter of an hour," was the answer. "I'll come for you,
if you like. Have a few minute's nap if you feel sleepy."
<P>
Mr. Coulson got up.
<P>
"Not I!" he said. "I am going to douse my head in some cold
water. That must have been the strongest brandy and soda that was
ever brewed, to send me off like that."
<P>
His friend laughed as he helped him out on to the deck.
<P>
"I shouldn't grumble at it, if I were you," he said carelessly.
"It saved you from a bad crossing."
<P>
Mr. Coulson washed his face and hands in the smoking room
lavatory, and was so far recovered, even, as to be able to drink
a cup of coffee before they reached the harbor. At Folkestone he
looked everywhere for his friend, but in vain. At Charing Cross
he searched once more. The little dark gentleman, with the
distinguished air and the easy, correct speech, who had mixed his
brandy and soda, had disappeared.
<P>
"And I owe the little beggar for half that cabin," Mr. Coulson
thought with a sensation of annoyance. "I wonder where he's
hidden himself!"
