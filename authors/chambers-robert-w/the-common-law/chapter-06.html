<p>Neville had begun to see less and less of Valerie West. When
she first returned from the country in September she had come
to the studio and had given him three or four mornings on the
portrait which he had begun during the previous summer. But the
painting of it involved him in difficulties entirely foreign to
him&mdash;difficulties born of technical timidity of the increasing
and inexplicable lack of self-confidence. And deeply worried,
he laid it aside, A dull, unreasoning anxiety possessed him. Those
who had given him commissions to execute were commencing to importune
him for results. He had never before disappointed any client.
Valerie could be of very little service to him in the big mural
decorations which, almost in despair, he had abruptly started.
Here and there, in the imposing compositions designed for the
Court House, a female figure, or group of figures, was required,
but, in the main, male figures filled the preliminary cartoons&mdash;great
law-givers and law-defenders of all ages and all lands, in robes
and gowns of silks; in armour, in skins, in velvet and ermine&mdash;men
wearing doublet, jack-coat, pourpoint; men in turban and caftan,
men covered with mail of all kinds&mdash;armour of leather, of fibre,
of lacquer, of quilted silk, of linked steel, Milanaise, iron
cuirass; the emblazoned panoply of the Mongol paladins; Timour
Melek's greaves of virgin gold; men of all nations and of all
ages who fashioned or executed human law, from Moses to Caesar,
from Mohammed to Genghis Kahn and the Golden Emperor, from Charlemagne
to Napoleon, and down through those who made and upheld the laws
in the Western world, beginning with Hiawatha, creator of the
Iroquois Confederacy&mdash;the Great League.</p>

<p>His studio was a confusion of silks, cut velvets, tapestries,
embroideries, carpets of the East, lay figures glittering with
replicas of priceless armour. Delicate fabrics trailed over chair
and floor almost under foot; inlaid and gem-hilted weapons, illuminated
missals, glass-cased papyri, gilded zones, filets, girdles, robes
of fur, hoods, wallets, helmets, hats, lay piled up, everywhere
in methodical disorder. And into and out of the studio passed
male models of all statures, all ages, venerable, bearded men,
men in their prime, men with the hard-hammered features and thick,
sinewy necks of gladiators, men slender and pallid as dreaming
scholars, youths that might have worn the gold-red elf-locks and
the shoulder cloak of Venice, youth chiselled in a beauty as dark
and fierce as David wore when the mailed giant went crashing earthward
under the smooth round pebble from his sling.</p>

<p>Valerie's turn in this splendid panoply was soon over. Even had
she been so inclined there was, of course, no place for her to
visit now, no place to sit and watch him among all these men.
After hours, once or twice, she came in to tea&mdash;to gossip a little
with the old-time ease, and barter with him epigram for jest,
nonsense for inconsequence. Yet, subtly&mdash;after she had gone home&mdash;she
felt the effort. Either he or she had imperceptibly changed; she
knew not which was guilty; but she knew.</p>

<p>Besides, she herself was now in universal demand&mdash;and in the
furor of her popularity she had been, from the beginning, forced
to choose among a very few with whom she personally felt herself
at ease, and to whom she had become confidently accustomed. Also,
from the beginning, she had not found it necessary to sit undraped
for many&mdash;a sculptor or two&mdash;Burleson and Gary Graves &mdash;Sam
Ogilvy with his eternal mermaidens, Querida&mdash;nobody else. The
other engagements had been for costume or, at most, for head and
shoulders. Illustrators now clamoured for her in modish garments
of the moment&mdash;in dinner gown, ball gown, afternoon, carriage,
motor, walking, tennis, golf, riding costumes; poster artists
made her pretty features popular; photographs of her in every
style of indoor and outdoor garb decorated advertisements in the
backs of monthly magazines. She was seen turning on the water
in model bathtubs, offering the admiring reader a box of bonbons,
demurely displaying a brand of hosiery, recommending cold cream,
baked beans, railroad routes, tooth powder, and real-estate on
Long Island.</p>

<p>Her beauty, the innocent loveliness of her features, her dainty
modest charm, the enchanting outline and mould of her figure were
beginning to make her celebrated. Already people about town&mdash;at
the play, in the park, on avenue and street, in hotels and restaurants,
were beginning to recognise her, follow her with approving or
hostile eyes, turn their heads to watch her.</p>

<p>Theatrical agents wrote her, making attractive offers for an
engagement where showgirls were the ornamental caryatids which
upheld the three tottering unities along Broadway. She also had
chances to wear very wonderful model gowns for next season at
the Countess of Severn's new dressmaking, drawing-rooms whither
all snobdom crowded and shoved to get near the trade-marked coronet,
and where bewildering young ladies strolled haughtily about all
day long, displaying to agitated Gotham the most startling gowns
in the extravagant metropolis.</p>

<p>She had other opportunities, too&mdash;such as meeting several varieties
of fashionable men of various ages&mdash;gentlemen prominently identified
with the arts and sciences&mdash;the art of killing time and the science
of enjoying the assassination. And some of these assorted gentlemen
maintained extensive stables and drove tandems, spikes, and fours;
and some were celebrated for their yachts, or motors, or prima-donnas,
or business acumen, or charitable extravagances.... Yes, truly,
Valerie West was beginning to have many opportunities in this
generously philanthropic world. And she was making a great deal
of money&mdash;for her&mdash;but nothing like what she might very easily
have made. And she knew it, young as she was. For it does not
take very long to learn about such things when a girl is attempting
to earn her living in this altruistic world.</p>

<p>"She'll spread her wings and go one of these days," observed
Archie Allaire to Rita Tevis, who was posing as Psyche for one
of his clever, thinly brushed, high-keyed studies very much after
the manner and palette of Chaplin when they resembled neither
Chartrain nor Zier, nor any other artist temporarily in vogue.
For he was an adaptable man, facile, adroit, a master navigator
in trimming sail to the fitful breeze of popular favour. And his
work was in great demand.</p>

<p>"She'll be decorating the tonneau of some big touring car with
crested panels&mdash;and there'll be a bunch of orchids in the crystal
holder, and a Chow dog beside her, defying the traffic squad&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, she won't!" snapped Rita. "She's as likely to do that as
she is to dine with you again."</p>

<p>Allaire, caught off his guard, scowled with unfeigned annoyance.
Repeated essays to ingratiate himself with Valerie had finally
resulted in a dinner at the Astor, and in her firm, polite, but
uncompromising declination of all future invitations from him,
either to sit for him or beside him under any circumstances and
any conditions whatever.</p>

<p>"So that's your opinion, is it, Rita?" he inquired, keeping his
light-blue eyes and his thin wet brush busy on his canvas. "Well,
sister, take it from muh, she thinks she's the big noise in the
Great White Alley; but they're giving her the giggle behind her
back."</p>

<p>"That giggle may be directed at you, Archie," observed Rita,
scornfully; "you're usually behind her back, you know, hoisting
the <em>C.Q.D</em>."</p>

<p>"Which is all right, too," he said, apparently undisturbed; "but
when she goes to Atlantic City with Querida&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is an utter falsehood," retorted Rita, calmly. "Whoever
told you that she went there with Querida, lied."</p>

<p>"You think so?"</p>

<p>"I know so! She went alone."</p>

<p>"Then we'll let it go at that," said Allaire so unpleasantly
that Rita took fiery offence.</p>

<p>"There is not a man living who has the right to look sideways
at Valerie West! Everybody knows it &mdash;Neville, Querida, Sam,
John Burleson&mdash;even you know it! If a man or two has touched her
finger tips&mdash;her waist&mdash;her lips, perhaps&mdash;no man has obtained
more than that of her&mdash;dared more than that! I have never heard
that any man has ever even ventured to offend her ears, unless"&mdash;she
added with malice, "that is the reason that she accepts no more
invitations from you and your intimate friends."</p>

<p>Allaire managed to smile and continue to paint. But later he
found use for his palette knife&mdash;which was unusual in a painter
as clever as he and whose pride was in his technical skill with
materials used and applied <em>premier coup</em>.</p>

<p>With October came the opening of many theatres; a premature gaiety
animated the hotels and restaurants; winter fabrics, hats, furs,
gowns, appeared in shops; the glittering windows along Fifth Avenue
reflected more limousines and fewer touring bodies passing. Later
top hats reappeared on street and in lobby; and when the Opera
reopened, Long Island, Jersey, and Westchester were already beginning
to pour in cityward, followed later by Newport, Lenox, and Bar
Harbour. The police put on their new winter uniforms; furs were
displayed in carriages, automobiles, and theatres; the beauty
of the florist's windows became mellower, richer, and more splendid;
the jewellery in the restaurants more gorgeous. Gotham was beginning
to be its own again, jacked up by the Horse Show, the New Theatre,
and the Opera; and by that energetic Advertising Trust Company
with its branches, dependencies, and mergers, which is called
Society, and which is a matter of eternal vigilance and desperate
business instead of the relaxation of cultivated security in an
accepted and acceptable order of things.</p>

<p>Among other minor incidents, almost local in character, the Academy
and Society of American Artists opened its doors. And the exhibition
averaged as well as it ever will, as badly as it ever had averaged.
Allaire showed two portraits of fashionable women, done, this
time, in the manner of Zorn, and quite as clever on the streaky
surface. Sam Ogilvy proudly displayed another mermaid &mdash;Rita
in_ the tub&mdash;and two babies from photographs and "chic"&mdash;very
bad; but as usual it was very quickly marked sold.</p>

<p>Annan had a portrait of his sister Alice, poorly painted and
even recognised by some of her more intimate friends. Clive Gail
offered one of his marines&mdash;waves splashing and dashing all over
the canvas so realistically that women instinctively stepped back
and lifted their skirts, and men looked vaguely around for a waiter&mdash;at
least Ogilvy said so. As for Neville, he had a single study to
show&mdash;a full length&mdash;just the back and head and the soft contour
of limbs melting into a luminously sombre background&mdash;a masterpiece
in technical perfection, which was instantly purchased by a wise
and Western millionaire, and which left the public staring but
unmoved.</p>

<p>But it was José Querida who dominated the whole show, flooding
everything with the splendour of his sunshine so that all else
in the same room looked cold or tawdry or washed out. His canvas,
with its superbly vigorous drawing, at once became the sensation
of the exhibition. Sunday supplements reproduced it with a photograph
of Querida looking amiably at a statuette of Venus which he held
in his long, tapering fingers; magazines tried to print it in
two colours, in three, in dozens, and made fireworks of it to
Querida's inwardly suppressed agony, and their own satisfaction.
Serious young men wrote "appreciations" about it; serious young
women published instructive discourses concerning it in the daily
papers. Somebody in the valuable columns of the <em>Tribune</em>
inquired whether Querida's painting was meant to be symbolical;
somebody in the <em>Nation</em> said yes; somebody in the <em>Sun</em>
said no; somebody in something or other explained its psychological
subtleties; somebody in something else screamed, "bosh!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile the discussion was a god-send to fashionable diners-out
and to those cultivated leaders of society who prefer to talk
through the Opera and philharmonic.</p>

<p>In what the educated daily press calls the "world of art" and
the "realm of literature," Querida's picture was discussed intelligently
and otherwise, but it <em>was</em> discussed&mdash;from the squalid
table d'hôte, where unmanicured genius punctures the air with
patois and punches holes in it with frenzied thumbs, to quiet,
cultivated homes, where community of taste restricts the calling
lists&mdash;from the noisy studio, where pianos and girls make evenings
lively, to the austere bare boards or the velvet elegance of studios
where authority and preciousness, and occasionally attainment,
reside, and sometimes do not.</p>

<p>Neville was busy, but not too busy to go about in the evening
among his own kind, and among other kinds, too. This unexpected
resurgance within him of the social instinct, he made no attempt
to account for to others or to himself. He had developed a mental
and physical restlessness, which was not yet entirely nervous,
but it had become sufficiently itching to stir him out of fatigue
when the long day's work had ended&mdash;enough to drive him out of
the studio&mdash;at first merely to roam about at hazard through the
livelier sections of the city. But to the lonely, there is no
lonelier place than a lively one; and the false brilliancy and
gaiety drove him back upon himself and into his lair again, where
for a while he remained meditating amid the sombre menace of looming
canvases and the heavy futility of dull-gold hangings, and the
mischievous malice of starlight splintering into a million incandescent
rainbow rays through the sheet of glass above.</p>

<p>Out of this, after some days, he emerged, set in motion by his
increasing restlessness. And it shoved him in the direction of
his kind once more&mdash;and in the direction of other kinds.</p>

<p>He dined at his sister's in Seventy-ninth Street near Madison
Avenue; he dined with the Grandcourts on Fifth Avenue; he decorated
a few dances, embellished an opera box now and then, went to Lakewood
and Tuxedo for week ends, rode for a few days at Hot Springs,
frequented his clubs, frequented Stephanie, frequented Maxim's.</p>

<p>And all the while it seemed to him as though he were temporarily
enduring something which required patience, which could not last
forever, which must one day end in a great change, a complete
transformation for himself, of himself, of the world around him
and of his aim and hope and purpose in living. At moments, too,
an odd sensation of expectancy came over him&mdash;the sense of waiting,
of suppressed excitement. And he could not account for it.</p>

<p>Perhaps it concerned the finishing of his great mural frieze
for the Court House&mdash;that is, the completion of the section begun
in September. For, when it was done, and cleared out of his studio,
and had been set in its place, framed by the rose and gold of
marble and ormolu, a heavy reaction of relief set in, leaving
him listless and indifferent at first, then idle, disinclined
to begin the companion frieze; then again restless, discontented,
tired, and lonely in that strange solitude which seemed to be
growing wider and wider around him in rings of silence. Men praised
and lauded the great frieze; and he strove to respond, to believe
them&mdash;to believe in the work and in himself&mdash;strove to shake off
the terrible discouragement invading him, lurking always near
to reach out and touch him, slinking at his heels from street
to street, from room to room, skulking always just beyond the
shadows that his reading lamp cast.</p>

<p>Without envy, yet with profound sadness, he stood and faced the
splendour of Querida's canvas. He had gone to Querida and taken
him by both of his thin, olive-skinned hands, and had praised
the work with a heart clean of anything unworthy. And Querida
had laughed and displayed his handsome teeth, and returned compliment
for compliment.... And Neville had seen, on his dresser, a photograph
of Valerie, signed in her long, girlish, angular hand&mdash;"To José
from Valerie"; and the date was of mid-winter.</p>

<p>Christmas came; he sent Valerie some furs and a note, and, before
he went to Aiken to spend the holidays with his father and mother,
he tried to get her on the telephone&mdash;tried half a dozen times.
But she was either busy with business or with pleasure somewhere
or other&mdash;and he never found her at home; so he went South without
hearing from her.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Querida had laughed ... and returned compliment
for compliment."]</p>

<p>After he arrived, it is true, he received from her a cigarette
case and a very gay and frank Christmas greeting&mdash;happy and untroubled
apparently, brimming with gossip, inconsequences, and nonsense.
In it she thanked him for his letter and his gift, hoped he was
happy with his parents, and expressed an almost conventional desire
to see him on his return.</p>

<p>Then his parents came back to New York with him. Two days before
New Year's Day they went to Spindrift House instead of sailing
for Egypt, where for some years now they had been accustomed to
spend the winters shivering at Shepherd's. And he and his sister
and brother-in-law and Stephanie dined together that evening.
But the plans they made to include him for a New Year's Eve home
party remained uncertain as far as he was concerned. He was vague&mdash;could
not promise&mdash;he himself knew not why. And they ceased to press
him.</p>

<p>"You're growing thin and white," said Lily. "I believe you're
getting painter's colic."</p>

<p>"House painters acquire that," he said, smiling. "I'm not a member
of their union yet."</p>

<p>"Well, you must use as much white lead as they do on those enormous
canvases of yours. Why don't you start on a trip around the world,
Louis?"</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>Later, after he had taken his leave, the suggestion reoccurred
to him. He took enough trouble to think about it the next morning;
sent out his servant to amass a number of folders advertising
world girdling tours of various attractions, read them while lunching,
and sat and pondered. Why not? It might help. Because he certainly
began to need help. He had gone quite stale. Querida was right;
he ought to lie fallow. No ground could yield eternally without
rest. Querida was clever enough to know that; and he had been
stupid enough to ignore it&mdash;even disbelieve it, contemptuous of
precept and proverb and wise saw, buoyed above apprehension by
consciousness and faith in his own inexhaustible energy.</p>

<p>And, after all, something really seemed to have happened to him.
He almost admitted it now for the first time&mdash;considered the proposition
silently, wearily, without any definite idea of analysing it,
without even the desire to solve it.</p>

<p>Somehow, at some time, he had lost pleasure in his powers, faith
in his capacity, desire for the future. What had satisfied him
yesterday, to-day became contemptible. Farther than ever, farther
than the farthest, stars receded the phantoms of the great Masters.
What they believed and endured and wrought and achieved seemed
now not only hopelessly beyond any comprehension or attainment
of his, but even beyond hope of humble discipleship.</p>

<p>And always, horribly, like an obsession, was creeping over him
in these days the conviction of some similarity between his work
and the thin, clear, clever brush-work of Allaire&mdash;with all its
mastery of ways and means, all its triumph over technical difficulties,
all its tricks and subtle appeals, and its falsity, and its glamour.</p>

<p>Reflection, retrospection sickened him. It was snowing and growing
late when he wrote to a steamship agent making inquiries and asking
for plans of staterooms.</p>

<p>Then he had tea, alone there in the early winter dusk, with the
firelight playing over Gladys who sat in the full heat of the
blaze, licking her only kitten, embracing its neck with one maternal
paw.</p>

<p>He dressed about six, intending to dine somewhere alone that
New Year's Eve. The somewhere, as usual, ended at the Syrinx Club&mdash;or
rather at the snowy portal&mdash;for there he collided with Samuel
Strathclyde Ogilvy and Henry Knickerbocker Annan, and was seized
and compelled to perform with them on the snowy sidewalk, a kind
of round dance resembling a pow-wow, which utterly scandalised
the perfectly respectable club porter, and immensely interested
the chauffeurs of a row of taxicabs in waiting.</p>

<p>"Come! Let up! This isn't the most dignified performance I ever
assisted at," he protested.</p>

<p>"Who said it was dignified?" demanded Ogilvy. "We're not hunting
for dignity. Harry and I came here in a hurry to find an undignified
substitute for John Burleson. You're the man!"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Annan, "you're the sort of cheerful ass we
need in our business. Come on! Some of these taxis belong to us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where do you want me to go, you crazy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now be nice, Louis," he said, soothingly; "play pretty and don't
kick and scream. Burleson was going with us to see the old year
out at the Cafe Gigolette, but he's got laryngitis or some similar
species of pip&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want to go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've got to, dear friend. We've engaged a table for six&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Six!"</p>

<p>"Sure, dearie. In the college of experience coeducation is a
necessary evil. Step lively, son!"</p>

<p>"Who is going?"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'Me lord, the taxi waits.'"]</p>

<p>"One dream, one vision, one hallucination&mdash;" he wafted three
kisses from his gloved finger tips in the general direction of
Broadway&mdash;"and you, and Samuel, and I. Me lord, the taxi waits!"</p>

<p>"Now, Harry, I'm not feeling particularly cheerful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you will, dear friend; you will soon be feeling the Fifty-seven
Varieties of cheerfulness. All kinds of society will be at the
Gigolette&mdash;good, bad, fashionable, semi-fashionable&mdash;all imbued
with the intellectual and commendable curiosity to see somebody
'start something.' And," he added, modestly, "Sam and I are going
to see what can be accomplished&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No; I won't go&mdash;"</p>

<p>But they fell upon him and fairly slid him into a taxi, beckoning
two other similar vehicles to follow in procession.</p>

<p>"Now, dearie," simpered Sam, "don't you feel better?"</p>

<p>Neville laughed and smoothed out the nap of his top hat.</p>

<p>They made three stops at three imposing looking apartment hotels
between Sixth Avenue and Broadway &mdash;The Daisy, The Gwendolyn,
The Sans Souci&mdash;where negro porters and hallboys were gorgeously
conspicuous and the clerk at the desk seemed to be unusually popular
with the guests. And after every stop there ensued a shifting
of passengers in the taxicabs, until Neville found himself occupying
the rear taxi in the procession accompanied by a lively young
lady in pink silk and swansdown&mdash;a piquant face and pretty figure,
white and smooth and inclined to a plumpness so far successfully
contended with by her corset maker.</p>

<p>"I have on my very oldest gown," she explained with violet-eyed
animation, patting her freshly dressed hair with two smooth little
hands loaded with diamonds and turquoises. "I'm afraid somebody
will start something and then they'll throw confetti, and somebody
will think it's funny to aim champagne corks at you. So I've come
prepared," she added, looking up at him with a challenge to deny
her beauty. "By the way," she said, "I'm Mazie Gray. Nobody had
the civility to tell you, did they?"</p>

<p>"They said something.... I'm Louis Neville," he replied, smiling.</p>

<p>"Are you?" she laughed. "Well, you may take it from mother that
you're as cute as your name, Louis. Who was it they had all framed
up to give me my cues? That big Burleson gentleman who'd starve
if he had to laugh for a living, wasn't it? Can you laugh, child?"</p>

<p>"A few, Mazie. It is my only Sunday accomplishment."</p>

<p>"Dearie," she added, correcting him.</p>

<p>"It is my only accomplishment, dearie."</p>

<p>"That will be about all&mdash;for a beginning!" She laughed as the
cab stopped at the red awning and Neville aided her to descend.</p>

<p>Steps, vestibules, stairs, cloak-rooms were crowded with jolly,
clamouring throngs flourishing horns, canes, rattles, and dusters
decked with brilliant ribbons. Already some bore marks of premature
encounters with confetti and cocktails.</p>

<p>Waiters and head-waiters went gliding and scurrying about, assigning
guests to tables reserved months in advance. Pages in flame-coloured
and gold uniforms lifted the silken rope that stretched its barrier
between the impatient crowd and the tables; managers verified
offered credentials and escorted laughing parties to spaces bespoken.</p>

<p>Two orchestras, relieving each other, fiddled and tooted continuously;
great mounds of flowers, smilax, ropes of evergreens, multi-tinted
electroliers made the vast salon gay and filled it with perfume.</p>

<p>Even in the beginning it was lively enough though not yet boisterous
in the city where all New York was dining and preparing for eventualities;
the eventualities being that noisy mid-winter madness which seizes
the metropolis when the birth of the New Year is imminent.</p>

<p>It is a strange evolution, a strange condition, a state of mind
not to be logically accounted for. It is not accurate to say that
the nicer people, the better sort, hold aloof; because some of
them do not. And in this uproarious carnival the better sort are
as likely to misbehave as are the worse; and they have done it,
and do it, and probably will continue to say and do and tolerate
and permit inanities in themselves and in others that, at other
moments, they would regard as insanities&mdash;and rightly.</p>

<p>Around every table, rosily illuminated, laughter rang. White
throats and shoulders glimmered, jewels sparkled, the clear crystalline
shock of glasses touching glasses rang continual accompaniment
to the music and the breezy confusion of voices.</p>

<p>Here and there, in premonition of the eventual, the comet-like
passage of streaming confetti was blocked by bare arms upflung
to shield laughing faces; arms that flashed with splendid jewels
on wrist and finger.</p>

<p>Neville, coolly surveying the room, recognised many, responding
to recognition with a laugh, a gesture, or with glass uplifted.</p>

<p>"Stop making goo-goos," cried Mazie, dropping her hand over his
wrist. "Listen, and I'll be imprudent enough to tell you the very
latest toast&mdash;" She leaned nearer, opening her fan with a daring
laugh; but Ogilvy wouldn't have it.</p>

<p>"This is no time for single sentiment!" he shouted. "Everybody
should be perfectly plural to-night&mdash;everything should be plural,
multiple, diffuse, all embracing, general, polydipsiatic, polygynyatic,
polyandryatic!"</p>

<p>[Illustration: Mazie Gray.]</p>

<p>"What's polyandryatic?" demanded Mazie in astonishment.</p>

<p>"It means everybody is everybody else's! I'm yours and you're
mine but everybody else owns us and we own everybody."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted Annan. "Hear&mdash;hear! Where is the fair and total
stranger who is going to steal the first kiss from me? Somebody
count three before the rush begins&mdash;"</p>

<p>A ball of roses struck him squarely on the mouth; a furious shower
of confetti followed. For a few moments the volleys became general,
then the wild interchange of civilities subsided, and the cries
of laughter died away and were lost in the loud animated hum which
never ceased under the gay uproar of the music.</p>

<p>When they played the barcarole from Contes d'Hoffman everybody
sang it and rose to their feet cheering the beautiful prima donna
with whom the song was so closely identified, and who made one
of a gay group at a flower-smothered table.</p>

<p>And she rose and laughingly acknowledged the plaudits; but they
wouldn't let her alone until she mounted her chair and sang it
in solo for them; and then the vast salon went wild.</p>

<p>Neville, surveying the vicinity, recognised people he never dreamed
would have appeared in such a place&mdash;here a celebrated architect
and his pretty wife entertaining a jolly party, there a well-known
lawyer and somebody else's pretty wife; and there were men well
known at fashionable clubs and women known in fashionable sets,
and men and women characteristic of quieter sets, plainly a little
uncertain and surprised to find themselves there. And he recognised
assorted lights of the "profession," masculine and feminine; and
one or two beautiful meteors that were falling athwart the underworld,
leaving fading trails of incandescence in their jewelled wake.</p>

<p>The noise began to stun him; he laughed and talked and sang with
the others, distinguishing neither his own voice nor the replies.
For the tumult grew as the hour advanced toward midnight, gathering
steadily in strength, in license, in abandon.</p>

<p>And now, as the minute hands on the big gilded clock twitched
nearer and nearer to midnight, the racket became terrific, swelling,
roaring into an infernal din as the raucous blast of horns increased
in the streets outside and the whistles began to sound over the
city from Westchester to the Bay, from Long Island to the Palisades.</p>

<p>Sheer noise, stupefying, abominable, incredible, unending, greeted
the birth of the New Year; they were dancing in circles, singing,
cheering amid the crash of glasses. Table-cloths, silken gowns,
flowers were crushed and trampled under foot; flushed faces looked
into strange faces, laughing; eyes strange to other eyes smiled;
strange hands exchanged clasps with hands unknown; the whirl had
become a madness.</p>

<p>And, suddenly, in its vortex, Neville saw Valerie West. Somebody
had set her on a table amid the silver and flowers and splintered
crystal. Her face was flushed, eyes and mouth brilliant, her gown
almost torn from her left shoulder and fluttering around the lovely
arm in wisps and rags of silk and lace. Querida supported her
there.</p>

<p>They pelted her with flowers and confetti, and she threw roses
back at everybody, snatching her ammunition from a great basket
which Querida held for her.</p>

<p>Ogilvy and Annan saw her and opened fire on her with a cheer,
and she recognised them and replied with volleys of rosebuds&mdash;was
in the act of hurling her last blossom&mdash;caught sight of Neville
where he stood with Mazie on a chair behind him, her arms resting
on his shoulders. And the last rose dropped from her hand.</p>

<p>Querida turned, too, inquiringly; recognised Neville; and for
a second his olive cheeks reddened; then with a gay laugh he passed
his arm around Valerie and, coolly facing the bombardment of confetti
and flowers, swung her from the table to the floor.</p>

<p>A furious little battle of flowers began at his own table, but
Neville was already lost in the throng, making his way toward
the door, pelted, shouldered, blocked, tormented&mdash;but, indifferent,
unresponsive, forcing his path to the outer air.</p>

<p>Once or twice voices called his name, but he scarcely heard them.
Then a hand caught at his; and a breathless voice whispered:</p>

<p>"Are you going?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, dully.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I've had enough&mdash;of the New Year."</p>

<p>Breathing fast, the colour in her face coming and going, she
stood, vivid lips parted, regarding him. Then, in a low voice:</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were to be here, Louis."</p>

<p>"Nor I. It was an accident."</p>

<p>"Who was the&mdash;girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What girl?"</p>

<p>"She stood behind you with her hands on your shoulders."</p>

<p>"How the devil do I know," he said, savagely&mdash;"her name's Mazie&mdash;something&mdash;or&mdash;other."</p>

<p>"Did you bring her?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Did Querida bring <em>you</em>?" he asked, insolently.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "And the last rose dropped from her hand."]</p>

<p>She looked at him in a confused, bewildered way&mdash;laid her hand
on his sleeve with an impulse as though he had been about to strike
her.</p>

<p>He no longer knew what he was doing in the sudden surge of unreasoning
anger that possessed him; he shook her hand from his sleeve and
turned.</p>

<p>And the next moment, on the stairs, she was beside him again,
slender, pale, close to his shoulder, descending the great staircase
beside him, one white-gloved hand resting lightly within his arm.</p>

<p>Neither spoke. At the cloak-room she turned and looked at him&mdash;stood
a moment slowly tearing the orchids from her breast and dropping
the crushed petals underfoot.</p>

<p>A maid brought her fur coat&mdash;his gift; a page brought his own
coat and hat.</p>

<p>"Will you call a cab?"</p>

<p>He turned and spoke to the porter. Then they waited, side by
side, in silence.</p>

<p>When the taxicab arrived he turned to give the porter her address,
but she had forestalled him. And he entered the narrow vehicle;
and they sat through the snowy journey in utter silence until
the cab drew up at his door.</p>

<p>Then he said: "Are you not going home?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>They descended, stood in the falling snow while he settled with
the driver, then entered the great building, ascended in the elevator,
and stepped out at his door.</p>

<p>He found his latch-key; the door swung slowly open on darkness.</p>
