"I'm the Poet of White Horse Vale, sir,<br/>
With liberal notions under my cap."<br/>
&mdash;Ballad

</p>
</div>
<p>The Browns have become illustrious by the pen of Thackeray and
the pencil of Doyle, within the memory of the young gentlemen
who are now matriculating at the universities. Notwithstanding
the well-merited but late fame which has now fallen upon them,
any one at all acquainted with the family must feel that much
has yet to be written and said before the British nation will
be properly sensible of how much of its greatness it owes to the
Browns. For centuries, in their quiet, dogged, homespun way, they
have been subduing the earth in most English counties, and leaving
their mark in American forests and Australian uplands. Wherever
the fleets and armies of England have won renown, there stalwart
sons of the Browns have done yeomen's work. With the yew bow and
cloth-yard shaft at Cressy and Agincourt&mdash;with the brown bill
and pike under the brave Lord Willoughby&mdash;with culverin and demi-culverin
against Spaniards and Dutchmen&mdash;with hand-grenade and sabre, and
musket and bayonet, under Rodney and St. Vincent, Wolfe and Moore,
Nelson and Wellington, they have carried their lives in their
hands, getting hard knocks and hard work in plenty&mdash;which was
on the whole what they looked for, and the best thing for them&mdash;and
little praise or pudding, which indeed they, and most of us, are
better without. Talbots and Stanleys, St. Maurs, and such-like
folk, have led armies and made laws time out of mind; but those
noble families would be somewhat astounded&mdash;if the accounts ever
came to be fairly taken&mdash;to find how small their work for England
has been by the side of that of the Browns.</p>

<p>These latter, indeed, have, until the present generation, rarely
been sung by poet, or chronicled by sage. They have wanted their
sacer vates, having been too solid to rise to the top by themselves,
and not having been largely gifted with the talent of catching
hold of, and holding on tight to, whatever good things happened
to be going&mdash;the foundation of the fortunes of so many noble families.
But the world goes on its way, and the wheel turns, and the wrongs
of the Browns, like other wrongs, seem in a fair way to get righted.
And this present writer, having for many years of his life been
a devout Brown-worshipper, and, moreover, having the honour of
being nearly connected with an eminently respectable branch of
the great Brown family, is anxious, so far as in him lies, to
help the wheel over, and throw his stone on to the pile.</p>

<p>However, gentle reader, or simple reader, whichever you may be,
lest you should be led to waste your precious time upon these
pages, I make so bold as at once to tell you the sort of folk
you'll have to meet and put up with, if you and I are to jog on
comfortably together. You shall hear at once what sort of folk
the Browns are&mdash;at least my branch of them; and then, if you don't
like the sort, why, cut the concern at once, and let you and I
cry quits before either of us can grumble at the other.</p>

<p>In the first place, the Browns are a fighting family. One may
question their wisdom, or wit, or beauty, but about their fight
there can be no question. Wherever hard knocks of any kind, visible
or invisible, are going; there the Brown who is nearest must shove
in his carcass. And these carcasses, for the most part, answer
very well to the characteristic propensity: they are a squareheaded
and snake-necked generation, broad in the shoulder, deep in the
chest, and thin in the flank, carrying no lumber. Then for clanship,
they are as bad as Highlanders; it is amazing the belief they
have in one another. With them there is nothing like the Browns,
to the third and fourth generation. "Blood is thicker than water,"
is one of their pet sayings. They can't be happy unless they are
always meeting one another. Never were such people for family
gatherings; which, were you a stranger, or sensitive, you might
think had better not have been gathered together. For during the
whole time of their being together they luxuriate in telling one
another their minds on whatever subject turns up; and their minds
are wonderfully antagonistic, and all their opinions are downright
beliefs. Till you've been among them some time and understand
them, you can't think but that they are quarrelling. Not a bit
of it. They love and respect one another ten times the more after
a good set family arguing bout, and go back, one to his curacy,
another to his chambers, and another to his regiment, freshened
for work, and more than ever convinced that the Browns are the
height of company.</p>

<p>This family training, too, combined with their turn for combativeness,
makes them eminently quixotic. They can't let anything alone which
they think going wrong. They must speak their mind about it, annoying
all easy-going folk, and spend their time and money in having
a tinker at it, however hopeless the job. It is an impossibility
to a Brown to leave the most disreputable lame dog on the other
side of a stile. Most other folk get tired of such work. The old
Browns, with red faces, white whiskers, and bald heads, go on
believing and fighting to a green old age. They have always a
crotchet going, till the old man with the scythe reaps and garners
them away for troublesome old boys as they are.</p>

<p>And the most provoking thing is, that no failures knock them
up, or make them hold their hands, or think you, or me, or other
sane people in the right. Failures slide off them like July rain
off a duck's back feathers. Jem and his whole family turn out
bad, and cheat them one week, and the next they are doing the
same thing for Jack; and when he goes to the treadmill, and his
wife and children to the workhouse, they will be on the lookout
for Bill to take his place.</p>

<p>However, it is time for us to get from the general to the particular;
so, leaving the great army of Browns, who are scattered over the
whole empire on which the sun never sets, and whose general diffusion
I take to be the chief cause of that empire's stability; let us
at once fix our attention upon the small nest of Browns in which
our hero was hatched, and which dwelt in that portion of the royal
county of Berks which is called the Vale of White Horse.</p>

<p>Most of you have probably travelled down the Great Western Railway
as far as Swindon. Those of you who did so with their eyes open
have been aware, soon after leaving the Didcot station, of a fine
range of chalk hills running parallel with the railway on the
left-hand side as you go down, and distant some two or three miles,
more or less, from the line. The highest point in the range is
the White Horse Hill, which you come in front of just before you
stop at the Shrivenham station. If you love English scenery, and
have a few hours to spare, you can't do better, the next time
you pass, than stop at the Farringdon Road or Shrivenham station,
and make your way to that highest point. And those who care for
the vague old stories that haunt country-sides all about England,
will not, if they are wise, be content with only a few hours'
stay; for, glorious as the view is, the neighbourhood is yet more
interesting for its relics of bygone times. I only know two English
neighbourhoods thoroughly, and in each, within a circle of five
miles, there is enough of interest and beauty to last any reasonable
man his life. I believe this to be the case almost throughout
the country, but each has a special attraction, and none can be
richer than the one I am speaking of and going to introduce you
to very particularly, for on this subject I must be prosy; so
those that don't care for England in detail may skip the chapter.</p>

<p>O young England! young England! you who are born into these racing
railroad times, when there's a Great Exhibition, or some monster
sight, every year, and you can get over a couple of thousand miles
of ground for three pound ten in a five-weeks' holiday, why don't
you know more of your own birthplaces? You're all in the ends
of the earth, it seems to me, as soon as you get your necks out
of the educational collar, for midsummer holidays, long vacations,
or what not&mdash;going round Ireland, with a return ticket, in a fortnight;
dropping your copies of Tennyson on the tops of Swiss mountains;
or pulling down the Danube in Oxford racing boats. And when you
get home for a quiet fortnight, you turn the steam off, and lie
on your backs in the paternal garden, surrounded by the last batch
of books from Mudie's library, and half bored to death. Well,
well! I know it has its good side. You all patter French more
or less, and perhaps German; you have seen men and cities, no
doubt, and have your opinions, such as they are, about schools
of painting, high art, and all that; have seen the pictures of
Dresden and the Louvre, and know the taste of sour krout. All
I say is, you don't know your own lanes and woods and fields.
Though you may be choke-full of science, not one in twenty of
you knows where to find the wood-sorrel, or bee-orchis, which
grow in the next wood, or on the down three miles off, or what
the bog-bean and wood-sage are good for. And as for the country
legends, the stories of the old gable-ended farmhouses, the place
where the last skirmish was fought in the civil wars, where the
parish butts stood, where the last highwayman turned to bay, where
the last ghost was laid by the parson, they're gone out of date
altogether.</p>

<p>Now, in my time, when we got home by the old coach, which put
us down at the cross-roads with our boxes, the first day of the
holidays, and had been driven off by the family coachman, singing
"Dulce Domum" at the top of our voices, there we were, fixtures,
till black Monday came round. We had to cut out our own amusements
within a walk or a ride of home. And so we got to know all the
country folk and their ways and songs and stories by heart, and
went over the fields and woods and hills, again and again, till
we made friends of them all. We were Berkshire, or Gloucestershire,
or Yorkshire boys; and you're young cosmopolites, belonging to
all countries and no countries. No doubt it's all right; I dare
say it is. This is the day of large views, and glorious humanity,
and all that; but I wish back-sword play hadn't gone out in the
Vale of White Horse, and that that confounded Great Western hadn't
carried away Alfred's Hill to make an embankment.</p>

<p>But to return to the said Vale of White Horse, the country in
which the first scenes of this true and interesting story are
laid. As I said, the Great Western now runs right through it,
and it is a land of large, rich pastures bounded by ox-fences,
and covered with fine hedgerow timber, with here and there a nice
little gorse or spinney, where abideth poor Charley, having no
other cover to which to betake himself for miles and miles, when
pushed out some fine November morning by the old Berkshire. Those
who have been there, and well mounted, only know how he and the
stanch little pack who dash after him&mdash;heads high and sterns low,
with a breast-high scent&mdash;can consume the ground at such times.
There being little ploughland, and few woods, the Vale is only
an average sporting country, except for hunting. The villages
are straggling, queer, old-fashioned places, the houses being
dropped down without the least regularity, in nooks and out-of-the-way
corners, by the sides of shadowy lanes and footpaths, each with
its patch of garden. They are built chiefly of good gray stone,
and thatched; though I see that within the last year or two the
red-brick cottages are multiplying, for the Vale is beginning
to manufacture largely both bricks and tiles. There are lots of
waste ground by the side of the roads in every village, amounting
often to village greens, where feed the pigs and ganders of the
people; and these roads are old-fashioned, homely roads, very
dirty and badly made, and hardly endurable in winter, but still
pleasant jog-trot roads running through the great pasture-lands,
dotted here and there with little clumps of thorns, where the
sleek kine are feeding, with no fence on either side of them,
and a gate at the end of each field, which makes you get out of
your gig (if you keep one), and gives you a chance of looking
about you every quarter of a mile.</p>

<p>One of the moralists whom we sat under in our youth&mdash;was it the
great Richard Swiveller, or Mr. Stiggins&mdash;says, "We are born in
a vale, and must take the consequences of being found in such
a situation." These consequences I, for one, am ready to encounter.
I pity people who weren't born in a vale. I don't mean a flat
country; but a vale&mdash;that is, a flat country bounded by hills.
The having your hill always in view if you choose to turn towards
him&mdash;that's the essence of a vale. There he is for ever in the
distance, your friend and companion. You never lose him as you
do in hilly districts.</p>

<p>And then what a hill is the White Horse Hill! There it stands
right up above all the rest, nine hundred feet above the sea,
and the boldest, bravest shape for a chalk hill that you ever
saw. Let us go up to the top of him, and see what is to be found
there. Ay, you may well wonder and think it odd you never heard
of this before; but wonder or not, as you please, there are hundreds
of such things lying about England, which wiser folk than you
know nothing of, and care nothing for. Yes, it's a magnificent
Roman camp, and no mistake, with gates and ditch and mounds, all
as complete as it was twenty years after the strong old rogues
left it. Here, right up on the highest point, from which they
say you can see eleven counties, they trenched round all the table-land,
some twelve or fourteen acres, as was their custom, for they couldn't
bear anybody to overlook them, and made their eyrie. The ground
falls away rapidly on all sides. Was there ever such turf in the
whole world? You sink up to your ankles at every step, and yet
the spring of it is delicious. There is always a breeze in the
"camp," as it is called; and here it lies, just as the Romans
left it, except that cairn on the east side, left by her Majesty's
corps of sappers and miners the other day, when they and the engineer
officer had finished their sojourn there, and their surveys for
the ordnance map of Berkshire. It is altogether a place that you
won't forget, a place to open a man's soul, and make him prophesy,
as he looks down on that great Vale spread out as the garden of
the Lord before him, and wave on wave of the mysterious downs
behind, and to the right and left the chalk hills running away
into the distance, along which he can trace for miles the old
Roman road, "the Ridgeway" ("the Rudge," as the country folk call
it), keeping straight along the highest back of the hills&mdash;such
a place as Balak brought Balaam to, and told him to prophesy against
the people in the valley beneath. And he could not, neither shall
you, for they are a people of the Lord who abide there.</p>

<p>And now we leave the camp, and descend towards the west, and
are on the Ashdown. We are treading on heroes. It is sacred ground
for Englishmen&mdash;more sacred than all but one or two fields where
their bones lie whitening. For this is the actual place where
our Alfred won his great battle, the battle of Ashdown ("Aescendum"
in the chroniclers), which broke the Danish power, and made England
a Christian land. The Danes held the camp and the slope where
we are standing&mdash;the whole crown of the hill, in fact. "The heathen
had beforehand seized the higher ground," as old Asser says, having
wasted everything behind them from London, and being just ready
to burst down on the fair Vale, Alfred's own birthplace and heritage.
And up the heights came the Saxons, as they did at the Alma. "The
Christians led up their line from the lower ground. There stood
also on that same spot a single thorn-tree, marvellous stumpy
(which we ourselves with our very own eyes have seen)." Bless
the old chronicler! Does he think nobody ever saw the "single
thorn-tree" but himself? Why, there it stands to this very day,
just on the edge of the slope, and I saw it not three weeks since&mdash;an
old single thorn-tree, "marvellous stumpy." At least, if it isn't
the same tree it ought to have been, for it's just in the place
where the battle must have been won or lost&mdash;"around which, as
I was saying, the two lines of foemen came together in battle
with a huge shout. And in this place one of the two kings of the
heathen and five of his earls fell down and died, and many thousands
of the heathen side in the same place." * After which crowning
mercy, the pious king, that there might never be wanting a sign
and a memorial to the country-side, carved out on the northern
side of the chalk hill, under the camp, where it is almost precipitous,
the great Saxon White Horse, which he who will may see from the
railway, and which gives its name to the Vale, over which it has
looked these thousand years and more.</p>

</div>
<p>Right down below the White Horse is a curious deep and broad
gully called "the Manger," into one side of which the hills fall
with a series of the most lovely sweeping curves, known as "the
Giant's Stairs." They are not a bit like stairs, but I never saw
anything like them anywhere else, with their short green turf,
and tender bluebells, and gossamer and thistle-down gleaming in
the sun and the sheep-paths running along their sides like ruled
lines.</p>

<p>The other side of the Manger is formed by the Dragon's Hill,
a curious little round self-confident fellow, thrown forward from
the range, utterly unlike everything round him. On this hill some
deliverer of mankind &mdash;St. George, the country folk used
to tell me&mdash;killed a dragon. Whether it were St. George, I cannot
say; but surely a dragon was killed there, for you may see the
marks yet where his blood ran down, and more by token the place
where it ran down is the easiest way up the hillside.</p>

<p>Passing along the Ridgeway to the west for about a mile, we come
to a little clump of young beech and firs, with a growth of thorn
and privet underwood. Here you may find nests of the strong down
partridge and peewit, but take care that the keeper isn't down
upon you; and in the middle of it is an old cromlech, a huge flat
stone raised on seven or eight others, and led up to by a path,
with large single stones set up on each side. This is Wayland
Smith's cave, a place of classic fame now; but as Sir Walter has
touched it, I may as well let it alone, and refer you to "Kenilworth"
for the legend.</p>

<p>The thick, deep wood which you see in the hollow, about a mile
off, surrounds Ashdown Park, built by Inigo Jones. Four broad
alleys are cut through the wood from circumference to centre,
and each leads to one face of the house. The mystery of the downs
hangs about house and wood, as they stand there alone, so unlike
all around, with the green slopes studded with great stones just
about this part, stretching away on all sides. It was a wise Lord
Craven, I think, who pitched his tent there.</p>

<p>Passing along the Ridgeway to the east, we soon come to cultivated
land. The downs, strictly so called, are no more. Lincolnshire
farmers have been imported, and the long, fresh slopes are sheep-walks
no more, but grow famous turnips and barley. One of these improvers
lives over there at the "Seven Barrows" farm, another mystery
of the great downs. There are the barrows still, solemn and silent,
like ships in the calm sea, the sepulchres of some sons of men.
But of whom? It is three miles from the White Horse&mdash;too far for
the slain of Ashdown to be buried there. Who shall say what heroes
are waiting there? But we must get down into the Vale again, and
so away by the Great Western Railway to town, for time and the
printer's devil press, and it is a terrible long and slippery
descent, and a shocking bad road. At the bottom, however, there
is a pleasant public; whereat we must really take a modest quencher,
for the down air is provocative of thirst. So we pull up under
an old oak which stands before the door.</p>

<p>"What is the name of your hill, landlord?"</p>

<p>"Blawing <em>STWUN </em>Hill, sir, to be sure."</p>

<p>[<em>READER. "</em>Stuym?"</p>

<p><em>AUTHOR: "</em>Stone, stupid&mdash;the Blowing Stone."]</p>

<p>"And of your house? I can't make out the sign."</p>

<p>"Blawing Stwun, sir," says the landlord, pouring out his old
ale from a Toby Philpot jug, with a melodious crash, into the
long-necked glass.</p>

<p>"What queer names!" say we, sighing at the end of our draught,
and holding out the glass to be replenished.</p>

<p>"Bean't queer at all, as I can see, sir," says mine host, handing
back our glass, "seeing as this here is the Blawing Stwun, his
self," putting his hand on a square lump of stone, some three
feet and a half high, perforated with two or three queer holes,
like petrified antediluvian rat-holes, which lies there close
under the oak, under our very nose. We are more than ever puzzled,
and drink our second glass of ale, wondering what will come next.
"Like to hear un, sir?" says mine host, setting down Toby Philpot
on the tray, and resting both hands on the "Stwun." We are ready
for anything; and he, without waiting for a reply, applies his
mouth to one of the ratholes. Something must come of it, if he
doesn't burst. Good heavens! I hope he has no apoplectic tendencies.
Yes, here it comes, sure enough, a gruesome sound between a moan
and a roar, and spreads itself away over the valley, and up the
hillside, and into the woods at the back of the house, a ghost-like,
awful voice. "Um do say, sir," says mine host, rising purple-faced,
while the moan is still coming out of the Stwun, "as they used
in old times to warn the country-side by blawing the Stwun when
the enemy was a-comin', and as how folks could make un heered
then for seven mile round; leastways, so I've heered Lawyer Smith
say, and he knows a smart sight about them old times." We can
hardly swallow Lawyer Smith's seven miles; but could the blowing
of the stone have been a summons, a sort of sending the fiery
cross round the neighbourhood in the old times? What old times?
Who knows? We pay for our beer, and are thankful.</p>

<p>"And what's the name of the village just below, landlord?"</p>

<p>"Kingstone Lisle, sir."</p>

<p>"Fine plantations you've got here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; the Squire's 'mazing fond of trees and such like."</p>

<p>"No wonder. He's got some real beauties to be fond of. Good-day,
landlord."</p>

<p>"Good-day, sir, and a pleasant ride to 'ee."</p>

<p>And now, my boys, you whom I want to get for readers, have you
had enough? Will you give in at once, and say you're convinced,
and let me begin my story, or will you have more of it? Remember,
I've only been over a little bit of the hillside yet&mdash;what you
could ride round easily on your ponies in an hour. I'm only just
come down into the Vale, by Blowing Stone Hill; and if I once
begin about the Vale, what's to stop me? You'll have to hear all
about Wantage, the birthplace of Alfred, and Farringdon, which
held out so long for Charles the First (the Vale was near Oxford,
and dreadfully malignant&mdash;full of Throgmortons, Puseys, and Pyes,
and such like; and their brawny retainers). Did you ever read
Thomas Ingoldsby's "Legend of Hamilton Tighe"? If you haven't,
you ought to have. Well, Farringdon is where he lived, before
he went to sea; his real name was Hamden Pye, and the Pyes were
the great folk at Farringdon. Then there's Pusey. You've heard
of the Pusey horn, which King Canute gave to the Puseys of that
day, and which the gallant old squire, lately gone to his rest
(whom Berkshire freeholders turned out of last Parliament, to
their eternal disgrace, for voting according to his conscience),
used to bring out on high days, holidays, and bonfire nights.
And the splendid old cross church at Uffington, the Uffingas town.
How the whole countryside teems with Saxon names and memories!
And the old moated grange at Compton, nestled close under the
hillside, where twenty Marianas may have lived, with its bright
water-lilies in the moat, and its yew walk, "the cloister walk,"
and its peerless terraced gardens. There they all are, and twenty
things beside, for those who care about them, and have eyes. And
these are the sort of things you may find, I believe, every one
of you, in any common English country neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Will you look for them under your own noses, or will you not?
Well, well, I've done what I can to make you; and if you will
go gadding over half Europe now, every holidays, I can't help
it. I was born and bred a west-country man, thank God! a Wessex
man, a citizen of the noblest Saxon kingdom of Wessex, a regular
"Angular Saxon," the very soul of me adscriptus glebae. There's
nothing like the old country-side for me, and no music like the
twang of the real old Saxon tongue, as one gets it fresh from
the veritable chaw in the White Horse Vale; and I say with "Gaarge
Ridler," the old west-country yeoman,&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

"Throo aall the waarld owld Gaarge would bwoast,<br/>

</div>
<p>Here, at any rate, lived and stopped at home Squire Brown, <em>J.P.
</em>for the county of Berks, in a village near the foot of the
White Horse range. And here he dealt out justice and mercy in
a rough way, and begat sons and daughters, and hunted the fox,
and grumbled at the badness of the roads and the times. And his
wife dealt out stockings, and calico shirts, and smock frocks,
and comforting drinks to the old folks with the "rheumatiz," and
good counsel to all; and kept the coal and clothes' clubs going,
for yule-tide, when the bands of mummers came round, dressed out
in ribbons and coloured paper caps, and stamped round the Squire's
kitchen, repeating in true sing-song vernacular the legend of
St. George and his fight, and the ten-pound doctor, who plays
his part at healing the Saint&mdash;a relic, I believe, of the old
Middle-age mysteries. It was the first dramatic representation
which greeted the eyes of little Tom, who was brought down into
the kitchen by his nurse to witness it, at the mature age of three
years. Tom was the eldest child of his parents, and from his earliest
babyhood exhibited the family characteristics in great strength.
He was a hearty, strong boy from the first, given to fighting
with and escaping from his nurse, and fraternizing with all the
village boys, with whom he made expeditions all round the neighbourhood.
And here, in the quiet old-fashioned country village, under the
shadow of the everlasting hills, Tom Brown was reared, and never
left it till he went first to school, when nearly eight years
of age, for in those days change of air twice a year was not thought
absolutely necessary for the health of all her Majesty's lieges.</p>

<p>I have been credibly informed, and am inclined to believe, that
the various boards of directors of railway companies, those gigantic
jobbers and bribers, while quarrelling about everything else,
agreed together some ten years back to buy up the learned profession
of medicine, body and soul. To this end they set apart several
millions of money, which they continually distribute judiciously
among the doctors, stipulating only this one thing, that they
shall prescribe change of air to every patient who can pay, or
borrow money to pay, a railway fare, and see their prescription
carried out. If it be not for this, why is it that none of us
can be well at home for a year together? It wasn't so twenty years
ago, not a bit of it. The Browns didn't go out of the country
once in five years. A visit to Reading or Abingdon twice a year,
at assizes or quarter sessions, which the Squire made on his horse
with a pair of saddle-bags containing his wardrobe, a stay of
a day or two at some country neighbour's, or an expedition to
a county ball or the yeomanry review, made up the sum of the Brown
locomotion in most years. A stray Brown from some distant county
dropped in every now and then; or from Oxford, on grave nag, an
old don, contemporary of the Squire; and were looked upon by the
Brown household and the villagers with the same sort of feeling
with which we now regard a man who has crossed the Rocky Mountains,
or launched a boat on the Great Lake in Central Africa. The White
Horse Vale, remember, was traversed by no great road&mdash;nothing
but country parish roads, and these very bad. Only one coach ran
there, and this one only from Wantage to London, so that the western
part of the Vale was without regular means of moving on, and certainly
didn't seem to want them. There was the canal, by the way, which
supplied the country-side with coal, and up and down which continually
went the long barges, with the big black men lounging by the side
of the horses along the towing-path, and the women in bright-coloured
handkerchiefs standing in the sterns steering. Standing I say,
but you could never see whether they were standing or sitting,
all but their heads and shoulders being out of sight in the cozy
little cabins which occupied some eight feet of the stern, and
which Tom Brown pictured to himself as the most desirable of residences.
His nurse told him that those good-natured-looking women were
in the constant habit of enticing children into the barges, and
taking them up to London and selling them, which Tom wouldn't
believe, and which made him resolve as soon as possible to accept
the oft-proffered invitation of these sirens to "young master"
to come in and have a ride. But as yet the nurse was too much
for Tom.</p>

<p>Yet why should I, after all, abuse the gadabout propensities
of my countrymen? We are a vagabond nation now, that's certain,
for better for worse. I am a vagabond; I have been away from home
no less than five distinct times in the last year. The Queen sets
us the example: we are moving on from top to bottom. Little dirty
Jack, who abides in Clement's Inn gateway, and blacks my boots
for a penny, takes his month's hop-picking every year as a matter
of course. Why shouldn't he? I'm delighted at it. I love vagabonds,
only I prefer poor to rich ones. Couriers and ladies'-maids, imperials
and travelling carriages, are an abomination unto me; I cannot
away with them. But for dirty Jack, and every good fellow who,
in the words of the capital French song, moves about,</p>

<p>on his own back, why, good luck to them, and many a merry roadside
adventure, and steaming supper in the chimney corners of roadside
inns, Swiss chalets, Hottentot kraals, or wherever else they like
to go. So, having succeeded in contradicting myself in my first
chapter (which gives me great hopes that you will all go on, and
think me a good fellow notwithstanding my crotchets), I shall
here shut up for the present, and consider my ways; having resolved
to "sar' it out," as we say in the Vale, "holus bolus" just as
it comes, and then you'll probably get the truth out of me.</p>
