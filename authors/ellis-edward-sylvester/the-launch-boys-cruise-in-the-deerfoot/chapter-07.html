<p>"Well, here we are!"</p>

<p>It was Captain Alvin Landon who uttered the exclamation as the
three came to a halt on the shore at the point nearest the moorings
of the gasoline launch <em>Deerfoot</em>, left there the night
before.</p>

<p>She made a pretty picture, with her graceful lines, shining varnish,
polished brass work and cleanliness everywhere. The steersman
in the cockpit was guarded by a wind-shield of thick glass. At
the stern floated a flag displaying an anchor surrounded by a
circle of stars with the stripes as shown in our national emblem.
At the bow flew a burgee or small swallow-tailed flag of blue
upon which was the word <em>Deerfoot</em> in gold. The bunting
was always taken in when the boat lay up for the night, but in
daytime and in clear weather it was displayed on the launch.</p>

<p>Not only could one sleep with some comfort on such a craft by
using the convertible seats, but food could be prepared on an
oil stove. In cruising, however, among the numerous islands and
bays, it was so easy to go ashore for an excellent meal that Captain
Landon followed the rule.</p>

<p>The water was so deep close to land that the three easily sprang
aboard, the Captain being last in order to cast off the line that
held the boat in place. It was the first time that Mike Murphy
had ever placed foot on a craft of that nature. While Chester
hustled about, Alvin quickly joining him, he gaped around in silent
amazement. He felt that in his ignorance of everything the best
course for him was to do nothing without the advice of his young
friends. He sank down gingerly on one of the seats and watched
them.</p>

<p>He saw the Captain thrust the switch plug into place, though
with no idea of what he meant by doing so, while Chester took
a peep into the gasoline tank in the stern. Then Alvin opened
the hinged deck which covered the big six cylinder motor, climbed
forward to the fly-wheel, and swung it back and forth until it
circled over. Instantly there followed a smooth whirr, and he
closed the forward deck over the motor and took his seat behind
the wind-shield where he grasped the wheel which, as on an automobile,
controlled the steering gear. The control lever, as has been stated,
was on his left. Alvin pushed this forward until the clutch took
hold, and with a churning of the screw at the stern the boat moved
ahead and quickly attained a good degree of speed. The wind was
so slight that the surface of the water was scarcely rippled,
and no motion could be felt except the vibration of the powerful
engine.</p>

<p>The bow and stern lines having been neatly coiled down and everything
being adjusted, with Captain Alvin seated and loosely grasping
the steering wheel, the two mates took their places behind him,
prepared to enjoy the outing to the full. Youth, high health,
with every surrounding circumstance favorable&mdash;what can bring
more happiness to a human being? They come to us only once and
let us make the most of them.</p>

<p>"Is it permitted to spake to the man at the wheel?" called Mike
to the Captain, who, looking over his shoulder, nodded his head.</p>

<p>"So long as you speak good sense."</p>

<p>"Which the same is what I does always; why couldn't ye take a
run over to Ireland this morning, now that ye are headed that
way?"</p>

<p>"It's worth thinking about, but we shall have to wait till another
time. Better become acquainted with a part of the Maine coast
first."</p>

<p>The launch was speeding to the northeast in the direction of
Squirrel Island, which has long been one of the most popular of
summer resorts. This beautiful spot is not quite a mile long and
has a varied scenery that surprises every one who visits the place.
The deep water around the wharf is as clear as crystal, so that
at high tide one can look down and see clearly the rocky bottom
twenty feet below. The coast abounds with prodigious rocks tumbled
together by some stupendous convulsion of nature and against which
the waves dash with amazing power during a storm, and throw the
spray high in air and far inland. There are shady woods of balsam
and fir where one may stroll in the cool twilight over the velvet
carpet, meandering along the bewitching "Lover's Walk," with which
nearly every section is provided, or threading his way through
the dense bushes which brush him lovingly as he follows the faintly
marked paths. Overhead, when the crow sentinels catch sight of
him, they caw their warnings to their comrades. There are shadowy
glens, gaping fissures, whose corresponding faces show that at
some remote age they were split apart by a terrific upheaval,
a gray barn with its threshing machine and air of quiet country
life, rows of neat cottages, a little white wooden church, perched
like a rooster gathering himself and about to crow and flap his
wings, the Casino, smooth, grassy slopes, and at the northern
end of the island, the roomy Squirrel Inn, crowded with visitors
attracted by the cool and bracing air, from the opening to the
close of summer.</p>

<p>Our young friends had no intention of calling there, but, circling
to the westward of the island, headed for Boothbay Harbor nestling
three miles to the northward. A number of girls loitering on the
broad porch of the hotel and a group playing tennis waved their
handkerchiefs; the young Captain answered with a tooting of his
whistle, and Mike Murphy rising to his feet swung his cap over
his head.</p>

<p>To the right stretched Linekin Bay, to the head of Linekin Neck,
beyond which courses the Damariscotta River, bristling with islets,
picturesque and beautiful beyond compare. Captain Landon turned
slightly to the left, still heading with unabated speed for Boothbay
Harbor. He saw coming toward him a little steamer from whose bow
the water spread in a foaming wake. It was the craft which makes
regular trips between Boothbay Harbor and Squirrel Island through
the summer season, stopping at other places when passengers wish
it. One of these is Spruce Point, where little parties often go
ashore over the rickety dock, and, striking into the shady woods,
follow the winding path along the rocky coast known as the "Indian
Trail," for more than two miles, when, after passing Mount Pisgah
and crossing a long bridge, they find themselves in the town of
which I have spoken.</p>

<p>As the two boats rapidly approached, passing within a short distance
of each other, the head and shoulders of the captain of the <em>Nellie
G.</em> showed in the pilot-house. He was a tall, handsome man
with dark whiskers, who, when saluted by the <em>Deerfoot</em>,
reached up and pulled the whistle cord of his own craft. Every
one knows Captain Williams of Bowdoinham and is glad to see him
turn an honest penny each summer. His boat, one of the prettiest
in those waters, had been built wholly by himself, and the name
painted in big letters on the front of the wheelhouse is that
of his wife.</p>

<p>To the left and almost touching Southport is Capitol Island,
a little nearer, Burnt, and then Mouse, all as picturesque as
they can be. The pathway arched with trees completely shades the
sloping walk that leads to the hotel on Mouse Island. A government
light on Burnt Island throws out its warning rays at momentary
intervals through the night. When fog settles down, the light
gives place to a tolling bell.</p>

<p>Entering the broad harbor, our friends saw a score or more of
vessels grouped around at anchor, or moored at the wharves. There
was a magnificent yacht, the property of a multimillionaire of
national reputation; another luxurious craft, the representative
of a Boston club, a five-masted schooner, veteran ships, two of
which had voyaged from the other side of the world, a decayed
and rotting hull near the long bridge, where it tipped a little
to one side in the mud, and was wholly under water when the tide
was in, as it had been for years. An excursion steamer from Bath
was just arriving, while others were taking on passengers for
some of the towns not far off.</p>

<p>Alvin, having slowed down by lessening the amount of gas admitted
to the cylinders with the throttle lever on the wheel, rounded
to at one of the floats, where a man who had noted his approach
caught the loop of rope tossed to him and slipped it over the
mooring pile set in place for that purpose. The steersman pulled
the control lever back to the vertical position, releasing the
propeller shaft from connection with the motor. A further pull
backward threw in the reverse gear, and the launch came to rest
beside the float and the lever was returned to the vertical position.</p>

<p>"I'll look after it while you are gone," he said and Alvin nodded.
Captain and crew then attended to stopping the motor by turning
the switch to the "off" position, putting out fenders to avoid
scratching, making bow and stern lines fast to deck cleats and
putting everything in shipshape order.</p>

<p>The three then climbed the steps to the upper level, passed the
storehouses and ascended the moderate hill to the principal street
of the well-known town of Boothbay Harbor. There was little that
was noteworthy in the rather long avenue, lined with the usual
stores, a bank and amusement hall and a number of pretty residences,
and I should make no reference to it except for an incident that
befell the visitors.</p>

<p>Having gone to the end of the street, that is, until the eastern
terminal gave way to the open country, they turned about to retrace
their steps to the boat, for it was much more pleasant to be skimming
over the water. The temperature at Boothbay Harbor is generally
five or ten degrees higher than at Squirrel Island.</p>

<p>The three sauntered along, pausing now and then to look into
the store windows, admiring the displays of Indian trinkets offered
for sale, and approached the corner where they were to turn down
the hill to the wharf. At that moment they saw a man of dark complexion,
with a big mustache, and accompanied by a large lad, both in yachting
costume, come out of Hodgdon's store, which is devoted to the
sale of hats, caps, boots, shoes, clothing and other necessities.
The two took the opposite course, following the main street in
the direction of the ball grounds.</p>

<p>Neither Alvin nor Chester did more than glance at the couple,
for there was nothing unusual in their appearance, but Mike started.</p>

<p>"Did ye obsarve thim?" he asked, lowering his voice.</p>

<p>"Yes; but there are plenty others on the street that are as interesting."</p>

<p>"Come wid me," whispered Mike, "say nothing."</p>

<p>He whisked into the store, his wondering companions at his heels.
They left the situation to him.</p>

<p>"Will ye oblige me by saying whither the two that has just passed
out bought anything of ye?" asked Mike of the rotund, smiling
clerk, who, hesitating a moment, answered:</p>

<p>"The younger one bought a yachting cap, or rather traded one
for his old straw hat, for which I allowed him a nickel, which
is all it's worth and more too, I'm beginning to think."</p>

<p>He held up the dilapidated headgear which he caught up from under
the counter.</p>

<p>"Do ye recognize the same?" asked Mike, in a whisper of Alvin.</p>

<p>"Can it be possible!" exclaimed the young Captain.</p>

<p>"It's the identycal hat I wore last night whin we had our ilegant
shindy!"</p>
