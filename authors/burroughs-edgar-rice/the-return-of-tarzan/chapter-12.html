<article class="w3-container w3-justify">

Let us go back a few months to the little, windswept
platform of a railway station in northern Wisconsin.
The smoke of forest fires hangs low over the surrounding
landscape, its acrid fumes smarting the eyes of a little
party of six who stand waiting the coming of the train
that is to bear them away toward the south.
<P>
Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, his hands clasped beneath the tails
of his long coat, paces back and forth under the ever-watchful
eye of his faithful secretary, Mr. Samuel T. Philander.
Twice within the past few minutes he has started absent-mindedly
across the tracks in the direction of a near-by swamp, only to
be rescued and dragged back by the tireless Mr. Philander.
<P>
Jane Porter, the professor's daughter, is in strained and
lifeless conversation with William Cecil Clayton and Tarzan
of the Apes.  Within the little waiting room, but a bare
moment before, a confession of love and a renunciation had
taken place that had blighted the lives and happiness of two
of the party, but William Cecil Clayton, Lord Greystoke, was
not one of them.
<P>
Behind Miss Porter hovered the motherly Esmeralda.  She, too,
was happy, for was she not returning to her beloved Maryland?
Already she could see dimly through the fog of smoke the murky
headlight of the oncoming engine.  The men began to gather up
the hand baggage.  Suddenly Clayton exclaimed.
<P>
"By Jove!  I've left my ulster in the waiting-room," and
hastened off to fetch it.
<P>
"Good-bye, Jane," said Tarzan, extending his hand.
"God bless you!"
<P>
"Good-bye," replied the girl faintly.  "Try to forget me--no,
not that--I could not bear to think that you had forgotten me."
<P>
"There is no danger of that, dear," he answered.  "I wish
to Heaven that I might forget.  It would be so much easier
than to go through life always remembering what might have been.
You will be happy, though; I am sure you shall--you must be.
You may tell the others of my decision to drive my car on
to New York--I don't feel equal to bidding Clayton good-bye.
I want always to remember him kindly, but I fear that I am
too much of a wild beast yet to be trusted too long with
the man who stands between me and the one person in all
the world I want."
<P>
As Clayton stooped to pick up his coat in the waiting
room his eyes fell on a telegraph blank lying face down
upon the floor.  He stooped to pick it up, thinking it
might be a message of importance which some one had dropped.
He glanced at it hastily, and then suddenly he forgot his
coat, the approaching train--everything but that terrible
little piece of yellow paper in his hand.  He read it twice
before he could fully grasp the terrific weight of meaning
that it bore to him.
<P>
When he had picked it up he had been an English nobleman,
the proud and wealthy possessor of vast estates--a moment
later he had read it, and he knew that he was an untitled
and penniless beggar.  It was D'Arnot's cablegram to
Tarzan, and it read:
<P>
<P>
Finger prints prove you Greystoke.  Congratulations.
                                                      D'ARNOT.
<P>
<P>
He staggered as though he had received a mortal blow.
Just then he heard the others calling to him to hurry--the
train was coming to a stop at the little platform.
Like a man dazed he gathered up his ulster.  He would tell
them about the cablegram when they were all on board the train.
Then he ran out upon the platform just as the engine whistled
twice in the final warning that precedes the first rumbling
jerk of coupling pins.  The others were on board, leaning out
from the platform of a Pullman, crying to him to hurry.
Quite five minutes elapsed before they were settled in their
seats, nor was it until then that Clayton discovered that
Tarzan was not with them.
<P>
"Where is Tarzan?" he asked Jane Porter.  "In another car?"
<P>
"No," she replied; "at the last minute he determined to
drive his machine back to New York.  He is anxious to see
more of America than is possible from a car window.  He is
returning to France, you know."
<P>
Clayton did not reply.  He was trying to find the right words
to explain to Jane Porter the calamity that had befallen him
--and her.  He wondered just what the effect of his knowledge
would be on her.  Would she still wish to marry him--to be
plain Mrs. Clayton?  Suddenly the awful sacrifice which one
of them must make loomed large before his imagination.
Then came the question:  Will Tarzan claim his own?  The ape-man
had known the contents of the message before he calmly denied
knowledge of his parentage!  He had admitted that Kala, the ape,
was his mother!  Could it have been for love of Jane Porter?
<P>
There was no other explanation which seemed reasonable.
Then, having ignored the evidence of the message, was it not
reasonable to assume that he meant never to claim his birthright?
If this were so, what right had he, William Cecil Clayton, to
thwart the wishes, to balk the self-sacrifice of this
strange man?  If Tarzan of the Apes could do this thing to
save Jane Porter from unhappiness, why should he, to whose
care she was intrusting her whole future, do aught to
jeopardize her interests?
<P>
And so he reasoned until the first generous impulse to
proclaim the truth and relinquish his titles and his estates
to their rightful owner was forgotten beneath the mass of
sophistries which self-interest had advanced.  But during the
balance of the trip, and for many days thereafter, he was
moody and distraught.  Occasionally the thought obtruded
itself that possibly at some later day Tarzan would regret
his magnanimity, and claim his rights.
<P>
Several days after they reached Baltimore Clayton
broached the subject of an early marriage to Jane.
<P>
"What do you mean by early?" she asked.
<P>
"Within the next few days.  I must return to England at
once--I want you to return with me, dear."
<P>
"I can't get ready so soon as that," replied Jane.  "It will
take a whole month, at least."
<P>
She was glad, for she hoped that whatever called him to
England might still further delay the wedding.  She had made
a bad bargain, but she intended carrying her part loyally
to the bitter end--if she could manage to secure a temporary
reprieve, though, she felt that she was warranted in doing so.
His reply disconcerted her.
<P>
"Very well, Jane," he said.  "I am disappointed, but I shall let
my trip to England wait a month; then we can go back together."
<P>
But when the month was drawing to a close she found still
another excuse upon which to hang a postponement, until at
last, discouraged and doubting, Clayton was forced to go
back to England alone.
<P>
The several letters that passed between them brought Clayton
no nearer to a consummation of his hopes than he had been
before, and so it was that he wrote directly to Professor
Porter, and enlisted his services.  The old man had always
favored the match.  He liked Clayton, and, being of an old
southern family, he put rather an exaggerated value on the
advantages of a title, which meant little or nothing to
his daughter.
<P>
Clayton urged that the professor accept his invitation to
be his guest in London, an invitation which included the
professor's entire little family--Mr. Philander, Esmeralda,
and all.  The Englishman argued that once Jane was there, and
home ties had been broken, she would not so dread the step
which she had so long hesitated to take.
<P>
So the evening that he received Clayton's letter Professor Porter
announced that they would leave for London the following week.
<P>
But once in London Jane Porter was no more tractable than she
had been in Baltimore.  She found one excuse after another,
and when, finally, Lord Tennington invited the party to cruise
around Africa in his yacht, she expressed the greatest delight
in the idea, but absolutely refused to be married until they
had returned to London.  As the cruise was to consume a year
at least, for they were to stop for indefinite periods at
various points of interest, Clayton mentally anathematized
Tennington for ever suggesting such a ridiculous trip.
<P>
It was Lord Tennington's plan to cruise through the
Mediterranean, and the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean, and
thus down the East Coast, putting in at every port that
was worth the seeing.
<P>
And so it happened that on a certain day two vessels passed
in the Strait of Gibraltar.  The smaller, a trim white
yacht, was speeding toward the east, and on her deck sat a
young woman who gazed with sad eyes upon a diamondstudded
locket which she idly fingered.  Her thoughts were far
away, in the dim, leafy fastness of a tropical jungle--and
her heart was with her thoughts.
<P>
She wondered if the man who had given her the beautiful
bauble, that had meant so much more to him than the
intrinsic value which he had not even known could ever
have meant to him, was back in his savage forest.
<P>
And upon the deck of the larger vessel, a passenger steamer
passing toward the east, the man sat with another young
woman, and the two idly speculated upon the identity of the
dainty craft gliding so gracefully through the gentle swell of
the lazy sea.
<P>
When the yacht had passed the man resumed the conversation
that her appearance had broken off.
<P>
"Yes," he said, "I like America very much, and that means,
of course, that I like Americans, for a country is only what
its people make it.  I met some very delightful people while I
was there.  I recall one family from your own city, Miss
Strong, whom I liked particularly--Professor Porter and
his daughter."
<P>
"Jane Porter!" exclaimed the girl.  "Do you mean to tell me
that you know Jane Porter?  Why, she is the very best friend
I have in the world.  We were little children together--we have
known each other for ages."
<P>
"Indeed!" he answered, smiling.  "You would have difficulty
in persuading any one of the fact who had seen either of you."
<P>
"I'll qualify the statement, then," she answered, with a laugh.
"We have known each other for two ages--hers and mine.
But seriously we are as dear to each other as sisters,
and now that I am going to lose her I am almost heartbroken."
<P>
"Going to lose her?" exclaimed Tarzan.  "Why, what do you mean?
Oh, yes, I understand.  You mean that now that she is married
and living in England, you will seldom if ever see her."
<P>
"Yes," replied she; "and the saddest part of it all is that
she is not marrying the man she loves.  Oh, it is terrible.
Marrying from a sense of duty!  I think it is perfectly wicked,
and I told her so.  I have felt so strongly on the subject that
although I was the only person outside of blood relations
who was to have been asked to the wedding I would not let
her invite me, for I should not have gone to witness the
terrible mockery.  But Jane Porter is peculiarly positive.
She has convinced herself that she is doing the only honorable
thing that she can do, and nothing in the world will ever
prevent her from marrying Lord Greystoke except Greystoke
himself, or death."
<P>
"I am sorry for her," said Tarzan.
<P>
"And I am sorry for the man she loves," said the girl, "for
he loves her.  I never met him, but from what Jane tells me
he must be a very wonderful person.  It seems that he was
born in an African jungle, and brought up by fierce,
anthropoid apes.  He had never seen a white man or woman
until Professor Porter and his party were marooned on the
coast right at the threshold of his tiny cabin.  He saved them
from all manner of terrible beasts, and accomplished the
most wonderful feats imaginable, and then to cap the climax
he fell in love with Jane and she with him, though she never
really knew it for sure until she had promised herself to
Lord Greystoke."
<P>
"Most remarkable," murmured Tarzan, cudgeling his brain for
some pretext upon which to turn the subject.  He delighted
in hearing Hazel Strong talk of Jane, but when he was the
subject of the conversation he was bored and embarrassed.
But he was soon given a respite, for the girl's mother
joined them, and the talk became general.
<P>
The next few days passed uneventfully.  The sea was quiet.
The sky was clear.  The steamer plowed steadily on toward the
south without pause.  Tarzan spent quite a little time with
Miss Strong and her mother.  They whiled away their hours
on deck reading, talking, or taking pictures with Miss
Strong's camera.  When the sun had set they walked.
<P>
One day Tarzan found Miss Strong in conversation with a
stranger, a man he had not seen on board before.  As he
approached the couple the man bowed to the girl and turned
to walk away.
<P>
"Wait, Monsieur Thuran," said Miss Strong; "you must meet
Mr. Caldwell.  We are all fellow passengers, and should
be acquainted."
<P>
The two men shook hands.  As Tarzan looked into the eyes
of Monsieur Thuran he was struck by the strange familiarity
of their expression.
<P>
"I have had the honor of monsieur's acquaintance in the
past, I am sure," said Tarzan, "though I cannot recall the
circumstances."
<P>
Monsieur Thuran appeared ill at ease.
<P>
"I cannot say, monsieur," he replied.  "It may be so.  I have
had that identical sensation myself when meeting a stranger."
<P>
"Monsieur Thuran has been explaining some of the mysteries
of navigation to me," explained the girl.
<P>
Tarzan paid little heed to the conversation that ensued--he
was attempting to recall where he had met Monsieur Thuran before.
That it had been under peculiar circumstances he was positive.
Presently the sun reached them, and the girl asked Monsieur
Thuran to move her chair farther back into the shade.
Tarzan happened to be watching the man at the time,
and noticed the awkward manner in which he handled
the chair--his left wrist was stiff.  That clew was
sufficient--a sudden train of associated ideas did the rest.
<P>
Monsieur Thuran had been trying to find an excuse to
make a graceful departure.  The lull in the conversation
following the moving of their position gave him an opportunity
to make his excuses.  Bowing low to Miss Strong, and inclining
his head to Tarzan, he turned to leave them.
<P>
"Just a moment," said Tarzan.  "If Miss Strong will pardon me
I will accompany you.  I shall return in a moment, Miss Strong."
<P>
Monsieur Thuran looked uncomfortable.  When the two men had
passed out of the girl's sight, Tarzan stopped, laying a
heavy hand on the other's shoulder.
<P>
"What is your game now, Rokoff?" he asked.
<P>
"I am leaving France as I promised you," replied the other,
in a surly voice.
<P>
"I see you are," said Tarzan; "but I know you so well
that I can scarcely believe that your being on the same boat
with me is purely a coincidence.  If I could believe it the
fact that you are in disguise would immediately disabuse
my mind of any such idea."
<P>
"Well," growled Rokoff, with a shrug, "I cannot see what you
are going to do about it.  This vessel flies the English flag.
I have as much right on board her as you, and from the
fact that you are booked under an assumed name I imagine
that I have more right."
<P>
"We will not discuss it, Rokoff.  All I wanted to say to
you is that you must keep away from Miss Strong--she is a
decent woman."
<P>
Rokoff turned scarlet.
<P>
"If you don't I shall pitch you overboard," continued Tarzan.
"Do not forget that I am just waiting for some excuse."
Then he turned on his heel, and left Rokoff standing
there trembling with suppressed rage.
<P>
He did not see the man again for days, but Rokoff was
not idle.  In his stateroom with Paulvitch he fumed and
swore, threatening the most terrible of revenges.
<P>
"I would throw him overboard tonight," he cried, "were I
sure that those papers were not on his person.  I cannot
chance pitching them into the ocean with him.  If you were
not such a stupid coward, Alexis, you would find a way to
enter his stateroom and search for the documents."
<P>
Paulvitch smiled.  "You are supposed to be the brains of this
partnership, my dear Nikolas," he replied.  "Why do you not
find the means to search Monsieur Caldwell's stateroom--eh?"
<P>
Two hours later fate was kind to them, for Paulvitch, who
was ever on the watch, saw Tarzan leave his room without
locking the door.  Five minutes later Rokoff was stationed
where he could give the alarm in case Tarzan returned, and
Paulvitch was deftly searching the contents of the ape-
man's luggage.
<P>
He was about to give up in despair when he saw a coat
which Tarzan had just removed.  A moment later he grasped an
official envelope in his hand.  A quick glance at its contents
brought a broad smile to the Russian's face.
<P>
When he left the stateroom Tarzan himself could not have
told that an article in it had been touched since he left
it--Paulvitch was a past master in his chosen field.
When he handed the packet to Rokoff in the seclusion of
their stateroom the larger man rang for a steward, and
ordered a pint of champagne.
<P>
"We must celebrate, my dear Alexis," he said.
<P>
"It was luck, Nikolas," explained Paulvitch.  "It is evident
that he carries these papers always upon his person--just
by chance he neglected to transfer them when he changed
coats a few minutes since.  But there will be the deuce to
pay when he discovers his loss.  I am afraid that he will
immediately connect you with it.  Now that he knows that
you are on board he will suspect you at once."
<P>
"It will make no difference whom he suspects--after to-night,"
said Rokoff, with a nasty grin.
<P>
After Miss Strong had gone below that night Tarzan stood
leaning over the rail looking far out to sea.  Every night he
had done this since he had come on board--sometimes he
stood thus for an hour.  And the eyes that had been watching
his every movement since he had boarded the ship at
Algiers knew that this was his habit.
<P>
Even as he stood there this night those eyes were on him.
Presently the last straggler had left the deck.  It was
a clear night, but there was no moon--objects on deck
were barely discernible.
<P>
From the shadows of the cabin two figures crept stealthily
upon the ape-man from behind.  The lapping of the waves
against the ship's sides, the whirring of the propeller,
the throbbing of the engines, drowned the almost soundless
approach of the two.
<P>
They were quite close to him now, and crouching low, like
tacklers on a gridiron.  One of them raised his hand and
lowered it, as though counting off seconds--one--two--three!
As one man the two leaped for their victim.  Each grasped a
leg, and before Tarzan of the Apes, lightning though he was,
could turn to save himself he had been pitched over the low
rail and was falling into the Atlantic.
<P>
Hazel Strong was looking from her darkened port across
the dark sea.  Suddenly a body shot past her eyes from
the deck above.  It dropped so quickly into the dark waters
below that she could not be sure of what it was--it might
have been a man, she could not say.  She listened for some
outcry from above--for the always-fearsome call, "Man overboard!"
but it did not come.  All was silence on the ship above--all
was silence in the sea below.
<P>
The girl decided that she had but seen a bundle of refuse
thrown overboard by one of the ship's crew, and a moment
later sought her berth.
