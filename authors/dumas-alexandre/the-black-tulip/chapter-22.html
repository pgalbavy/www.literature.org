<P>The night passed away very sweetly for Cornelius, although 
in great agitation. Every instant he fancied he heard the 
gentle voice of Rosa calling him. He then started up, went 
to the door, and looked through the grating, but no one was 
behind it, and the lobby was empty.</P>
<P>Rosa, no doubt, would be watching too, but, happier than he, 
she watched over the tulip; she had before her eyes that 
noble flower, that wonder of wonders. which not only was 
unknown, but was not even thought possible until then.</P>
<P>What would the world say when it heard that the black tulip 
was found, that it existed and that it was the prisoner Van 
Baerle who had found it?</P>
<P>How Cornelius would have spurned the offer of his liberty in 
exchange for his tulip!</P>
<P>Day came, without any news; the tulip was not yet in flower.</P>
<P>The day passed as the night. Night came, and with it Rosa, 
joyous and cheerful as a bird.</P>
<P>&quot;Well?&quot; asked Cornelius.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, all is going on prosperously. This night, without any 
doubt, our tulip will be in flower.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And will it flower black?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Black as jet.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Without a speck of any other colour.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Without one speck.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good Heavens! my dear Rosa, I have been dreaming all night, 
in the first place of you,&quot; (Rosa made a sign of 
incredulity,) &quot;and then of what we must do.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, and I will tell you now what I have decided on. The 
tulip once being in flower, and it being quite certain that 
it is perfectly black, you must find a messenger.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If it is no more than that, I have a messenger quite 
ready.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is he safe?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;One for whom I will answer,  -  he is one of my lovers.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I hope not Jacob.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, be quiet, it is the ferryman of Loewestein, a smart 
young man of twenty-five.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;By Jove!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Be quiet,&quot; said Rosa, smiling, &quot;he is still under age, as 
you have yourself fixed it from twenty-six to twenty-eight.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In fine, do you think you may rely on this young man?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As on myself; he would throw himself into the Waal or the 
Meuse if I bade him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, Rosa, this lad may be at Haarlem in ten hours; you 
will give me paper and pencil, and, perhaps better still, 
pen and ink, and I will write, or rather, on second 
thoughts, you will, for if I did, being a poor prisoner, 
people might, like your father, see a conspiracy in it. You 
will write to the President of the Horticultural Society, 
and I am sure he will come.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But if he tarries?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, let us suppose that he tarries one day, or even two; 
but it is impossible. A tulip-fancier like him will not 
tarry one hour, not one minute, not one second, to set out 
to see the eighth wonder of the world. But, as I said, if he 
tarried one or even two days, the tulip will still be in its 
full splendour. The flower once being seen by the President, 
and the protocol being drawn up, all is in order; you will 
only keep a duplicate of the protocol, and intrust the tulip 
to him. Ah! if we had been able to carry it ourselves, Rosa, 
it would never have left my hands but to pass into yours; 
but this is a dream, which we must not entertain,&quot; continued 
Cornelius with a sigh, &quot;the eyes of strangers will see it 
flower to the last. And above all, Rosa, before the 
President has seen it, let it not be seen by any one. Alas! 
if any one saw the black tulip, it would be stolen.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Did you not tell me yourself of what you apprehended from 
your lover Jacob? People will steal one guilder, why not a 
hundred thousand?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I shall watch; be quiet.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But if it opened whilst you were here?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The whimsical little thing would indeed be quite capable of 
playing such a trick,&quot; said Rosa.</P>
<P>&quot;And if on your return you find it open?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, Rosa, whenever it opens, remember that not a moment 
must be lost in apprising the President.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And in apprising you. Yes, I understand.&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa sighed, yet without any bitter feeling, but rather like 
a woman who begins to understand a foible, and to accustom 
herself to it.</P>
<P>&quot;I return to your tulip, Mynheer van Baerle, and as soon as 
it opens I will give you news, which being done the 
messenger will set out immediately.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Rosa, Rosa, I don't know to what wonder under the sun I 
shall compare you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Compare me to the black tulip, and I promise you I shall 
feel very much flattered. Good night, then, till we meet 
again, Mynheer Cornelius.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, say 'Good night, my friend.'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good night, my friend,&quot; said Rosa, a little consoled.</P>
<P>&quot;Say, 'My very dear friend.'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, my friend  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very dear friend, I entreat you, say 'very dear,' Rosa, 
very dear.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very dear, yes, very dear,&quot; said Rosa, with a beating 
heart, beyond herself with happiness.</P>
<P>&quot;And now that you have said 'very dear,' dear Rosa, say also 
'most happy': say 'happier and more blessed than ever man 
was under the sun.' I only lack one thing, Rosa.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And that is?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your cheek,  -  your fresh cheek, your soft, rosy cheek. Oh, 
Rosa, give it me of your own free will, and not by chance. 
Ah!&quot;</P>
<P>The prisoner's prayer ended in a sigh of ecstasy; his lips 
met those of the maiden,  -  not by chance, nor by stratagem, 
but as Saint-Preux's was to meet the lips of Julie a hundred 
years later.</P>
<P>Rosa made her escape.</P>
<P>Cornelius stood with his heart upon his lips, and his face 
glued to the wicket in the door.</P>
<P>He was fairly choking with happiness and joy. He opened his 
window, and gazed long, with swelling heart, at the 
cloudless vault of heaven, and the moon, which shone like 
silver upon the two-fold stream flowing from far beyond the 
hills. He filled his lungs with the pure, sweet air, while 
his brain dwelt upon thoughts of happiness, and his heart 
overflowed with gratitude and religious fervour.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh Thou art always watching from on high, my God,&quot; he 
cried, half prostrate, his glowing eyes fixed upon the 
stars: &quot;forgive me that I almost doubted Thy existence 
during these latter days, for Thou didst hide Thy face 
behind the clouds, and wert for a moment lost to my sight, O 
Thou merciful God, Thou pitying Father everlasting! But 
to-day, this evening, and to-night, again I see Thee in all 
Thy wondrous glory in the mirror of Thy heavenly abode, and 
more clearly still in the mirror of my grateful heart.&quot;</P>
<P>He was well again, the poor invalid; the wretched captive 
was free once more.</P>
<P>During part of the night Cornelius, with his heart full of 
joy and delight, remained at his window, gazing at the 
stars, and listening for every sound.</P>
<P>Then casting a glance from time to time towards the lobby, 
 - </P>
<P>&quot;Down there,&quot; he said, &quot;is Rosa, watching like myself, and 
waiting from minute to minute; down there, under Rosa's 
eyes, is the mysterious flower, which lives, which expands, 
which opens, perhaps Rosa holds in this moment the stem of 
the tulip between her delicate fingers. Touch it gently, 
Rosa. Perhaps she touches with her lips its expanding 
chalice. Touch it cautiously, Rosa, your lips are burning. 
Yes, perhaps at this moment the two objects of my dearest 
love caress each other under the eye of Heaven.&quot;</P>
<P>At this moment, a star blazed in the southern sky, and shot 
through the whole horizon, falling down, as it were, on the 
fortress of Loewestein.</P>
<P>Cornelius felt a thrill run through his frame.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah!&quot; he said, &quot;here is Heaven sending a soul to my flower.&quot;</P>
<P>And as if he had guessed correctly, nearly at that very 
moment the prisoner heard in the lobby a step light as that 
of a sylph, and the rustling of a gown, and a well-known 
voice, which said to him,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Cornelius, my friend, my very dear friend, and very happy 
friend, come, come quickly.&quot;</P>
<P>Cornelius darted with one spring from the window to the 
door, his lips met those of Rosa, who told him, with a kiss, 
 - </P>
<P>&quot;It is open, it is black, here it is.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How! here it is?&quot; exclaimed Cornelius.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, yes, we ought indeed to run some little risk to give a 
great joy; here it is, take it.&quot;</P>
<P>And with one hand she raised to the level of the grating a 
dark lantern, which she had lit in the meanwhile, whilst 
with the other she held to the same height the miraculous 
tulip.</P>
<P>Cornelius uttered a cry, and was nearly fainting.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh!&quot; muttered he, &quot;my God, my God, Thou dost reward me for 
my innocence and my captivity, as Thou hast allowed two such 
flowers to grow at the grated window of my prison!&quot;</P>
<P>The tulip was beautiful, splendid, magnificent; its stem was 
more than eighteen inches high; it rose from out of four 
green leaves, which were as smooth and straight as iron 
lance-heads; the whole of the flower was as black and 
shining as jet.</P>
<P>&quot;Rosa,&quot; said Cornelius, almost gasping, &quot;Rosa, there is not 
one moment to lose in writing the letter.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is written, my dearest Cornelius,&quot; said Rosa.</P>
<P>&quot;Is it, indeed?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Whilst the tulip opened I wrote it myself, for I did not 
wish to lose a moment. Here is the letter, and tell me 
whether you approve of it.&quot;</P>
<P>Cornelius took the letter, and read, in a handwriting which 
was much improved even since the last little note he had 
received from Rosa, as follows:  - </P>
<P>&quot;Mynheer President,  -  The black tulip is about to open, 
perhaps in ten minutes. As soon as it is open, I shall send 
a messenger to you, with the request that you will come and 
fetch it in person from the fortress at Loewestein. I am the 
daughter of the jailer, Gryphus, almost as much of a captive 
as the prisoners of my father. I cannot, therefore, bring to 
you this wonderful flower. This is the reason why I beg you 
to come and fetch it yourself.</P>
<P>&quot;It is my wish that it should be called Rosa Barlaensis.</P>
<P>&quot;It has opened; it is perfectly black; come, Mynheer 
President, come.</P>
<P>&quot;I have the honour to be your humble servant,</P>
<P>&quot;Rosa Gryphus.</P>
<P>&quot;That's it, dear Rosa, that's it. Your letter is admirable! 
I could not have written it with such beautiful simplicity. 
You will give to the committee all the information that will 
be required of you. They will then know how the tulip has 
been grown, how much care and anxiety, and how many 
sleepless nights, it has cost. But for the present not a 
minute must be lost. The messenger! the messenger!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What's the name of the President?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Give me the letter, I will direct it. Oh, he is very well 
known: it is Mynheer van Systens, the burgomaster of 
Haarlem; give it to me, Rosa, give it to me.&quot;</P>
<P>And with a trembling hand Cornelius wrote the address,  - </P>
<P>&quot;To Mynheer Peter van Systens, Burgomaster, and President of 
the Horticultural Society of Haarlem.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And now, Rosa, go, go,&quot; said Cornelius, &quot;and let us implore 
the protection of God, who has so kindly watched over us 
until now.&quot; </P></article>
