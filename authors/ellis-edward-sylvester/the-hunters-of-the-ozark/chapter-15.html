<p>"We are on our way to the camp in the Ozarks," said Fred Linden;
"and am I mistaken in believing that you will go with us all the
way?"</p>

<p>"Such is the wish of Deerfoot," replied the Shawanoe, whereat
Terry Clark gave signs of breaking out again; but at a warning
look from Fred he restrained himself.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot loves the Hunters of the Ozark; he has promised to
make them a visit; he will do so with his friends that he has
found in the woods, and who forget to keep their guns loaded."</p>

<p>"No use!" exclaimed Terry, bounding in the air, striking his
heels together, and flinging his hat aloft with a loud whoop;
"I must give gintle exprission to me emotions, even though it
makes a war with England."</p>

<p>The others showed no objection to this harmless ebullition, and
he speedily became quiet again.</p>

<p>Had Fred Linden been intimately acquainted with Deerfoot, he
would have noticed that he was not entirely at ease. Now and then
he darted glances about him, as though he half expected the appearance
of some unwelcome person. The glances were so quick and furtive
that neither Fred nor Terry noticed them.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot," said Fred, the three still standing; "we have concluded
that there isn't a better place along the trail for a camp."</p>

<p>To the surprise of the boys, he shook his head in dissent.</p>

<p>"Why, this is where father and the rest spent the night when
they last went this way."</p>

<p>He nodded to signify that he agreed with them.</p>

<p>"There were three of them, and they had their horses, that could
not be well hid; when my brothers go into camp for the night,
they should take a place where all who went by would not see them."</p>

<p>It struck the others as curious that the Shawanoe should talk
in that fashion, when they could not see any cause for alarm;
but they had enough faith in him to accept his judgment on such
an important matter. He added:</p>

<p>"Come with Deerfoot and he will show his brothers where they
may slumber in peace."</p>

<p>Without any more explanation the Shawanoe moved down the bank
of the brook, following a course parallel to the flow of the water,
the other two keeping at his heels. He did not look around until
he had gone more than a hundred yards. Then it was that the little
party found itself in a rocky section, with a rough cavern on
their right&mdash;that is, the bowlders and rocks were jumbled together
in such a fashion that there was some resemblance to a cave. The
chief merit of the place, however, was the privacy that it afforded,
rather than the strength as a means of defense against an enemy.</p>

<p>"This suits very well," said Fred, taking in all the points at
a glance; "here is a rocky bed on which we can start a fire, and
the other rocks and bowlders will keep off the wind, if there
happens to be any; the water is handy, if we should need it, and
it is certain that we are not as likely to be seen here as where
we first selected."</p>

<p>"Deerfut," said Terry, who was nosing about, "I obsarve ashes
here, as though somebody had been ahead of us."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot built a fire but a few moons ago, and staid over night."</p>

<p>"If it was good enough for ye, I can stand it," said Terry, "which
is the remark me uncle made when the Duke of Argyle asked him
to stay to dinner."</p>

<p>The boys unfastened the bundles from their backs and prepared
to spend the night where they were. The blankets were spread on
the flinty floor, and Deerfoot, setting down his gun beside theirs,
helped to gather the wood with which to keep a fire burning. The
three were so active that it took but a short time to collect
all that was needed. This was thrown into one pile, from which
it could be withdrawn as wanted.</p>

<p>I must give you a better idea of the spot where the three decided
to spend their first night in the woods together. They had walked
northward from the trail, and, so far as they could see, the country
was of the most broken nature, though the abundance of trees and
undergrowth did not permit an extended view. Two masses of stone
rose to the height of a dozen feet, and were separated by about
the same distance. These rough walls extended back to a distance
of three or four yards, where they came against a similar formation.
Thus, as may be said, there were three sides to an inclosure,
that part facing the brook being entirely open. On top of these
supports were tumbled an irregular mass of bowlders and rocks
which formed the roof. The latter had so many openings that it
was as well ventilated as the roof of the house about which the
Arkansas Traveler tells us.</p>

<p>The rear part of the cavern, if it may be allowed that name,
was stone, while the front was earth. Near the center, Deerfoot
had kindled his fire when he staid there, the smoke finding ready
escape through the openings above. Such a fire might give some
warmth were it needed, but the blaze was so well hidden by the
surrounding walls that it was not likely to be seen by any one
passing no nigher than fifty feet: therein lay the reason why
it was selected by Deerfoot.</p>

<p>After piling up the fuel for the night, the youths threw some
branches on the ground, near the rear of the cavern, and then
spread their blankets over them. The Shawanoe carried no blanket
with him, so it was expected that he would share the couch of
his friends.</p>

<p>While the three were busying themselves in this manner, Fred
Linden was disturbed by a suspicion that had been growing from
the moment Deerfoot expressed dissatisfaction with the spot selected
for their camp. This suspicion was that the young Indian had a
fear of something to which, as yet, he had made no reference.</p>

<p>I have already shown that it was not generally considered a dangerous
business in which the hunters of Ozark engaged. The rough, outdoor
life sometimes brought with it hardships, and occasionally sufferings,
but chief among the dangers was not that from Indians. It was
known that now and then the red men fired spiteful shots at the
invaders of their hunting grounds (as was the case with Michael
Clark, the father of Terence), but in this section of the west
that particular peril was deemed less than that which threatened
from wild beasts. There was no instance of the hunters having
been molested on their way to and from the trapping regions: why
then this special caution of Deerfoot?</p>

<p>Fred Linden, while turning these thoughts over in his mind, gave
but the one answer&mdash;<em>the Winnebago</em>. He was an intruder
in that part of Louisiana, and he had shown by his acts how ready
he was to shed the blood of innocent white persons. It was not
a supposition merely that this fierce warrior had companions.
The keen eyes of Deerfoot had discovered the proofs that there
were a half dozen, at least, with him, and from whom he separated
for a short time while he entered into the "side speculation"
with Brindle and her bell; so it will be seen that Fred Linden
was not only right in his suspicion that the Wolf had to do with
the unrest of Deerfoot, but that the latter possessed good cause
for his misgiving.</p>

<p>The Winnebagos, having drifted so far away from their own hunting
grounds into this part of the world, were either going further
from home, or were on their way back. Had the Wolf behaved himself,
the band would have gone and come without the knowledge of any
of the pioneers, unless there was a chance meeting in the wood,
when it is not likely that any harm would have resulted.</p>

<p>But one of the Winnebagos was struck in the face by a white boy,
while a young Indian, a friend of the latter, having "got the
drop" on the Wolf, had taken his gun from him. In other words,
the crime of assault and robbery had been committed.</p>

<p>Would the rest of the Winnebagos pocket the outrage and meekly
withdraw from the country?</p>

<p>That, it would be seen, was the all important question, upon
which great events, as affecting the friends in whom we are interested,
hinged.</p>

<p>It was in violation of the nature of the American race that any
member thereof should refuse to resent an indignity, when there
was a chance of doing so. The Winnebagos had the best of reasons
for believing that, by prowling around the settlement, or along
the trail leading thereto, they would soon gain an opportunity
to wipe out the disgrace put upon the Wolf, and, if not able to
get back the gun that had been taken from him, would be able to
procure another.</p>

<p>The fact that this valuable weapon was carried in the hands of
a boy, who had started to tramp through the woods to a point a
hundred miles off, and that it was not at all impossible that
the Winnebagos found, or would find it out, gave emphasis to the
cause of Deerfoot's uneasiness.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that, while Terry Clark never once took
this view of the situation, it occurred to his friend Fred, who
waited for the Shawanoe to make some reference to it.</p>

<p>"He knows best, and if he doesn't choose to say any thing about
it, there is no call for me to do so."</p>

<p>The shadows of night were creeping through the wood when the
fire was started, and the smoke began stealing upward through
the openings in the rocky roof.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot," said Fred, when the fire crackled brightly, "the
rule is, that a party in camp like this, must have some one on
guard while the others sleep. I don't know as there is any need
now, but if you think so, let Terry and me do it, for we are not
in need of sleep."</p>

<p>The Shawanoe looked at him intently for a moment as though he
would read his thoughts, and then quietly said:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot will be sentinel to-night!"</p>
