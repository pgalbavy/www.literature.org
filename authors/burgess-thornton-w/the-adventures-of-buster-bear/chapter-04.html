Getting even just for spite<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Doesn't always pay.<br/>
Fact is, it is very apt<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To work the other way.

<p>That is just how it came about that Little Joe Otter furnished
Buster Bear with the best breakfast he had had for a long time.
He didn't mean to do it. Oh, my, no! The truth is, he thought
all the time that he was preventing Buster Bear from getting a
breakfast. You see he wasn't well enough acquainted with Buster
to know that Buster is quite as smart as he is, and perhaps a
little bit smarter. Spite and selfishness were at the bottom of
it. You see Little Joe and Billy Mink had had all the fishing
in the Laughing Brook to themselves so long that they thought
no one else had any right to fish there. To be sure Bobby Coon
caught a few little fish there, but they didn't mind Bobby. Farmer
Brown's boy fished there too, sometimes, and this always made
Little Joe and Billy Mink very angry, but they were so afraid
of him that they didn't dare do anything about it. But when they
discovered that Buster Bear was a fisherman, they made up their
minds that something had got to be done. At least, Little Joe
did.</p>

<p>"He'll try it again to-morrow morning," said Little Joe. "I'll
keep watch, and as soon as I see him coming, I'll drive out all
the fish, just as I did to-day. I guess that'll teach him to let
our fish alone."</p>

<p>So the next morning Little Joe hid before daylight close by the
little pool where Buster Bear had given him such a fright. Sure
enough, just as the Jolly Sunbeams began to creep through the
Green Forest, he saw Buster Bear coming straight over to the little
pool. Little Joe slipped into the water and chased all the fish
out of the little pool, and stirred up the mud on the bottom so
that the water was so muddy that the bottom couldn't be seen at
all. Then he hurried down to the next little pool and did the
same thing.</p>

<p>Now Buster Bear is very smart. You know he had guessed the day
before who had spoiled his fishing. So this morning he only went
far enough to make sure that if Little Joe were watching for him,
as he was sure he would be, he would see him coming. Then, instead
of keeping on to the little pool, he hurried to a place way down
the Laughing Brook, where the water was very shallow, hardly over
his feet, and there he sat chuckling to himself. Things happened
just as he had expected. The frightened fish Little Joe chased
out of the little pools up above swam down the Laughing Brook,
because, you know, Little Joe was behind them, and there was nowhere
else for them to go. When they came to the place where Buster
was waiting, all he had to do was to scoop them out on to the
bank. It was great fun. It didn't take Buster long to catch all
the fish he could eat. Then he saved a nice fat trout and waited.</p>

<p>By and by along came Little Joe Otter, chuckling to think how
he had spoiled Buster Bear's fishing. He was so intent on looking
behind him to see if Buster was coming that he didn't see Buster
waiting there until he spoke.</p>

<p>"I'm much obliged for the fine breakfast you have given me,"
said Buster in his deepest, most grumbly-rumbly voice. "I've saved
a fat trout for you to make up for the one I ate yesterday. I
hope we'll go fishing together often."</p>

<p>Then he went off laughing fit to kill himself. Little Joe couldn't
find a word to say. He was so surprised and angry that he went
off by himself and sulked. And Billy Mink, who had been watching,
ate the fat trout.</p>
