A PEASANT found an Eagle captured in a trap, and much admiring
the bird, set him free.  The Eagle did not prove ungrateful to
his deliverer, for seeing the Peasant sitting under a wall which
was not safe, he flew toward him and with his talons snatched a
bundle from his head.  When the Peasant rose in pursuit, the
Eagle let the bundle fall again.  Taking it up, the man returned
to the same place, to find that the wall under which he had been
sitting had fallen to pieces; and he marveled at the service
rendered him by the Eagle.
