<p><em>MARCELINE </em>got up as much to hide her feelings as to
find out if the nickel-plated revolver was in its usual place
in the drawer. Upon her return she was greatly agitated, and told
them that the revolver had been removed.</p>

<p>Théophraste advised her to calm herself, saying there was nothing
of importance in that; and he proceeded to read about the crime
in the Rue du Bac, saying that the journalist who wrote the narrative
was more intelligent, and had made his report more interesting
than the first one.</p>

<p>"However," said he, "there are a few inaccuracies and omissions
in his narrative. According to him one is led to think that Cartouche
indulged in amorous proceedings with Mme. de Bithigne after supper.
However, such a thing should not be allowed to get abroad, as
no such thing happened. He had no other intention than to take
supper with the lady.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear Marceline, if I had intended otherwise, my reputation
would have suffered, and Mme. la Maréchale de Boufflers would
have scorned me when I met her on July 13th, 1721.</p>

<p>"These gentlemen also relate that I outraged Mme. la Maréchale
de Boufflers. This is all wrong. I am very fond of her on account
of her intellect, and our intercourse was most polite, as well
as virtuous. If they had only studied more, these journalists
would have known that Madame in 1721 was over sixty years old,
and I dare say Cartouche knew many younger women to play such
tricks on."</p>

<p>Théophraste then took up the paper:</p>

<p>"‘The history of the Rue du Bac is much more simple. The Prefect
of Police had received a note which ran: "If you dare, come and
find me; I am always at the inn in the Rue du Bac, with Bernard."
It was signed "Cartouche." The thing had occurred after Mme. de
Bithigne had told her story. The Prefect thought over his case
and laid his plans.</p>

<p>"‘That same evening, a quarter of an hour after midnight, half
a dozen policemen raided the tavern in the Rue du Bac. They were
met on the stairs by a man, who, although still young, had perfectly
white hair. He was endowed with almost superhuman strength, and,
on seeing the police, he picked up a chair near by and started
striking them. Three of them were stunned, and the others only
just had time to drag the prostrated bodies of their companions
into the street to prevent them from being burned by a fire started
on the first landing by this man with white hair. The man saved
himself by jumping from roof to roof over spaces more than thirty
feet high.</p>

<p>"‘The new Cartouche,’ continued Théophraste, amid the scared
silence of Marceline and M. Le-camus, ‘the new Cartouche has taken
possession of the Rue Guenegaud. Several days ago they found in
a vault-like passage there under the floor the body of a young
doctor, who had been active at the death of Mme. de Bardinoldi,
the mystery of which had baffled the police and press. The police
had not confided to any one the fact that pinned to the young
doctor’s tunic was a card on which some one had written in pencil:
"We will meet each other in the other world, M. de Traneuse."
This was without doubt a crime of the new Cartouche, for the old
one did in fact assassinate at this place an engineer named Traneuse.
Cartouche had knocked him on the head with a stick, and the young
doctor had had his skull fractured with a blunt instrument.’"</p>

<p>Théophraste laid down the paper, and, looking at Adolphe and
Marceline, remarked that they both looked as if they were expecting
a like catastrophe.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear Adolphe," said he, "it is ridiculous for you to
be angry at such pleasantries. I take the opportunity of telling
you that I often frequent the Rue Guenegaud. That history of M.
de Traneuse was to me the beginning of one of the prettiest farces
that ever I played with M. d’Argenson’s spies. Following the death
of M. de Traneuse (who had allowed some very improper talk about
me), I was followed by two patrols of the guard, who covered me
and rendered all resistance impossible. But they were ignorant
that I was Cartouche, and satisfied themselves by conducting me
to the Ford l’Avegne, which was the easiest prison in Paris. In
this prison they put debtors, drunks, and disorderly people, and
the people who have not paid their fines. They were sure that
they had taken Cartouche on the 10th of January, but on the evening
of the 9th Cartouche had made his escape, and took the direction
of his police. It was time, for everybody was now searching the
streets of Paris.</p>

<p>"My dear Marceline, and my dear Adolphe, you look as if you were
at a funeral. That article does not lose its quota of a certain
amount of wit. At first I thought it only the jest of a cheap
journalist, but I see now that it is very serious, believe me.
Wait for the history of the calf! Ah! We have not done yet with
the affair of the Petits Augustines! Listen!"</p>

<p>Théophraste picked up his paper, adjusted his gold spectacles,
and began again:</p>

<p>"‘That which was the most extraordinary in this adventure was
that several times during light days they have been on the point
of capturing this modern Cartouche, and that he always escaped
just as the other did, by way of the chimneys. History teaches
us that the true Cartouche designed on the 11th of June, 1721,
to sack the Hotel Desmarets, Rue des Petits Augustines. It was
one of his men, Le Ratichon, who had given him the idea. But Cartouche
and Le Ratichon had been imprisoned by the police. As soon as
Cartouche was in the house, the bailiffs hastened there and the
place was invaded. He tranquilly closed the doors of the salons
and extinguished the lights, undressed himself, climbed into the
chimney, descended by another way into the kitchen, where he found
a scullion, killed the scullion, disguised himself with the dead
man’s clothes, and went out in fine form from the hotel, killing
two bailiffs with two pistol shots because they asked him news
of Cartouche. Well, what will you say when you know that our Cartouche
was surrounded the day before yesterday in a confectioner’s shop
in a quarter of the Augustines, escaped by the chimney, after
having put on over all his effects, to prevent soiling them, the
pastry cook’s blouse, which had been found on the roofs, also
his pantaloons. As to the pastry cook, they found him half buried
in his bake oven. But, before putting him there, as a humane precaution,
the murderer, Cartouche, had assassinated him.’ "</p>

<p>Here Théophraste, interrupting himself again, cried:</p>

<p>"Previously, previously. I had previously assassinated him....
But why do you fly into the corners? Are you afraid? Let us see,
my dear Adolphe, my dear Marceline, a little coolness— you will
need it for the history of the calf."</p>
