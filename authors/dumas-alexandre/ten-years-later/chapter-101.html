<P>At the very time M. de Baisemeaux was showing Aramis the
prisoners in the Bastile, a carriage drew up at Madame de
Belliere's door, and, at that still early hour, a young
woman alighted, her head muffled in a silk hood. When the
servants announced Madame Vanel to Madame de Belliere, the
latter was engaged, or rather was absorbed, in reading, a
letter, which she hurriedly concealed. She had hardly
finished her morning toilette, her maid being still in the
next room. At the name  - -at the footsteps of Marguerite
Vanel  -  Madame de Belliere ran to meet her. She fancied she
could detect in her friend's eyes a brightness which was
neither that of health nor of pleasure. Marguerite embraced
her, pressed her hands, and hardly allowed her time to
speak. &quot;Dearest,&quot; she said, &quot;have you forgotten me? Have you
quite given yourself up to the pleasures of the court?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have not even seen the marriage fetes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What are you doing with yourself, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am getting ready to leave for Belliere.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For Belliere?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are becoming rustic in your tastes, then; I delight to
see you so disposed. But you are pale.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, I am perfectly well.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So much the better; I was becoming uneasy about you. You do
not know what I have been told.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;People say so many things.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, but this is very singular.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How well you know how to excite curiosity, Marguerite.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I was afraid of vexing you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Never; you have yourself always admired me for my evenness
of temper.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, it is said that  -  no, I shall never be able to
tell you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do not let us talk about it, then,&quot; said Madame de
Belliere, who detected the ill-nature that was concealed by
all these prefaces, yet felt the most anxious curiosity on
the subject.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, my dear marquise, it is said that, for some
time past, you no longer continue to regret Monsieur de
Belliere as you used to.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is an ill-natured report, Marguerite. I do regret and
shall always regret, my husband; but it is now two years
since he died. I am only twenty-eight years old, and my
grief at his loss ought not always to control every action
and thought of my life. You, Marguerite, who are the model
of a wife, would not believe me if I were to say so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why not? Your heart is so soft and yielding.&quot; she said,
spitefully.</P>
<P>&quot;Yours is so too, Marguerite, and yet I did not perceive
that you allowed yourself to be overcome by grief when your
heart was wounded.&quot; These words were in direct allusion to
Marguerite's rupture with the superintendent, and were also
a veiled but direct reproach made against her friend's
heart.</P>
<P>As if she only awaited this signal to discharge her shaft,
Marguerite exclaimed, &quot;Well, Elise, it is said you are in
love.&quot; And she looked fixedly at Madame de Belliere, who
blushed against her will.</P>
<P>&quot;Women never escape slander,&quot; replied the marquise, after a
moment's pause.</P>
<P>&quot;No one slanders you, Elise.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What!  -  people say that I am in love, and yet they do not
slander me!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In the first place, if it be true, it is no slander, but
simply a scandal-loving report. In the next place  -  for you
did not allow me to finish what I was saying  -  the public
does not assert that you have abandoned yourself to this
passion. It represents you, on the contrary, as a virtuous
but loving woman, defending yourself with claws and teeth,
shutting yourself up in your own house as in a fortress; in
other respects, as impenetrable as that of Danae,
notwithstanding Danae's tower was made of brass.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are witty, Marguerite,&quot; said Madame de Belliere,
angrily.</P>
<P>&quot;You always flatter me, Elise. In short, however you are
reported to be incorruptible and unapproachable. You cannot
decide whether the world is calumniating you or not; but
what is it you are musing about while I am speaking to you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; you are blushing and do not answer me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I was trying,&quot; said the marquise, raising her beautiful
eyes brightened with an indication of growing temper, &quot;I was
trying to discover to what you could possibly have alluded,
you who are so learned in mythological subjects in comparing
me to Danae.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You were trying to guess that?&quot; said Marguerite, laughing.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; do you not remember that at the convent, when we were
solving our problems in arithmetic  -  ah! what I have to
tell you is learned also, but it is my turn  -  do you not
remember, that if one of the terms were given, we were to
find out the other? Therefore do you guess now?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I cannot conjecture what you mean.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And yet nothing is more simple. You pretend that I am in
love, do you not?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So it is said.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well, it is not said, I suppose, that I am in love
with an abstraction. There must surely be a name mentioned
in this report.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly, a name is mentioned.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well; it is not surprising, then, that I should try to
guess this name, since you do not tell it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My dear marquise, when I saw you blush, I did not think you
would have to spend much time in conjectures.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It was the word Danae which you used that surprised me.
Danae means a shower of gold, does it not?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is to say that the Jupiter of Danae changed himself
into a shower of gold for her.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My lover, then, he whom you assign me  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I beg your pardon; I am your friend, and assign you no
one.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That may be; but those who are ill disposed towards me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you wish to hear the name?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have been waiting this half hour for it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, you shall hear it. Do not be shocked; he is a
man high in power.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good,&quot; said the marquise, as she clenched her hands like a
patient at the approach of the knife.</P>
<P>&quot;He is a very wealthy man,&quot; continued Marguerite; &quot;the
wealthiest, it may be. In a word, it is  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>The marquise closed her eyes for a moment.</P>
<P>&quot;It is the Duke of Buckingham,&quot; said Marguerite, bursting
into laughter. This perfidy had been calculated with extreme
ability; the name that was pronounced, instead of the name
which the marquise awaited, had precisely the same effect
upon her as the badly sharpened axes that had hacked,
without destroying, Messieurs de Chalais and De Thou upon
the scaffold. She recovered herself, however, and said, &quot;I
was perfectly right in saying you were a witty woman, for
you are making the time pass away most agreeably. This joke
is a most amusing one, for I have never seen the Duke of
Buckingham.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Never?&quot; said Marguerite, restraining her laughter.</P>
<P>&quot;I have never even left my own house since the duke has been
at Paris.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh!&quot; resumed Madame Vanel, stretching out her foot towards
a paper which was lying on the carpet near the window; &quot;it
is not necessary for people to see each other, since they
can write.&quot; The marquise trembled, for this paper was the
envelope of the letter she was reading as her friend had
entered, and was sealed with the superintendent's arms. As
she leaned back on the sofa on which she was sitting, Madame
de Belliere covered the paper with the thick folds of her
large silk dress, and so concealed it.</P>
<P>&quot;Come, Marguerite, tell me, is it to tell me all these
foolish reports that you have come to see me so early in the
day?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, I came to see you, in the first place, and to remind
you of those habits of our earlier days, so delightful to
remember, when we used to wander about together at
Vincennes, and, sitting beneath an oak, or in some sylvan
shade, used to talk of those we loved, and who loved us.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you propose that we should go out together now?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My carriage is here, and I have three hours at my
disposal.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am not dressed yet, Marguerite; but if you wish that we
should talk together, we can, without going to the woods of
Vincennes, find in my own garden here, beautiful trees,
shady groves, a greensward covered with daisies and violets,
the perfume of which can be perceived from where we are
sitting.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I regret your refusal, my dear marquise, for I wanted to
pour out my whole heart into yours.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I repeat again, Marguerite, my heart is yours just as much
in this room, or beneath the lime-trees in the garden here,
as it would be under the oaks in the wood yonder.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is not the same thing for me. In approaching Vincennes,
marquise, my ardent aspirations approach nearer to that
object towards which they have for some days past been
directed.&quot; The marquise suddenly raised her head. &quot;Are you
surprised, then, that I am still thinking of Saint-Mande?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of Saint-Mande?&quot; exclaimed Madame de Belliere; and the
looks of both women met each other like two resistless
swords.</P>
<P>&quot;You, so proud!&quot; said the marquise, disdainfully.</P>
<P>&quot;I, so proud!&quot; replied Madame Vanel. &quot;Such is my nature. I
do not forgive neglect  -  I cannot endure infidelity. When I
leave any one who weeps at my abandonment, I feel induced
still to love him; but when others forsake me and laugh at
their infidelity, I love distractedly.&quot;</P>
<P>Madame de Belliere could not restrain an involuntary
movement.</P>
<P>&quot;She is jealous,&quot; said Marguerite to herself.</P>
<P>&quot;Then,&quot; continued the marquise, &quot;you are quite enamored of
the Duke of Buckingham  -  I mean of M. Fouquet?&quot; Elise felt
the allusion, and her blood seemed to congeal in her heart.
&quot;And you wished to go to Vincennes,  -  to Saint-Mande,
even?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I hardly know what I wished: you would have advised me
perhaps.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In what respect?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You have often done so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Most certainly I should not have done so in the present
instance, for I do not forgive as you do. I am less loving,
perhaps; when my heart has been once wounded, it remains so
always.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But M. Fouquet has not wounded you,&quot; said Marguerite Vanel,
with the most perfect simplicity.</P>
<P>&quot;You perfectly understand what I mean. M. Fouquet has not
wounded me; I do not know of either obligation or injury
received at his hands, but you have reason to complain of
him. You are my friend, and I am afraid I should not advise
you as you would like.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! you are prejudging the case.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The sighs you spoke of just now are more than indications.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You overwhelm me,&quot; said the young woman suddenly, as if
collecting her whole strength, like a wrestler preparing for
a last struggle; &quot;you take only my evil dispositions and my
weaknesses into calculation, and do not speak of my pure and
generous feelings. If, at this moment, I feel instinctively
attracted towards the superintendent, if I even make an
advance to him, which, I confess, is very probable, my
motive for it is, that M. Fouquet's fate deeply affects me,
and because he is, in my opinion, one of the most
unfortunate men living.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah!&quot; said the marquise, placing her hand upon her heart,
&quot;something new, then, has occurred?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you not know it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am utterly ignorant of everything about him,&quot; said Madame
de Belliere, with the poignant anguish that suspends thought
and speech, and even life itself.</P>
<P>&quot;In the first place, then, the king's favor is entirely
withdrawn from M. Fouquet, and conferred on M. Colbert.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So it is stated.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is very clear, since the discovery of the plot of
Belle-Isle.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I was told that the discovery of the fortifications there
had turned out to M. Fouquet's honor.&quot;</P>
<P>Marguerite began to laugh in so cruel a manner that Madame
de Belliere could at that moment have delightedly plunged a
dagger in her bosom. &quot;Dearest,&quot; continued Marguerite, &quot;there
is no longer any question of M. Fouquet's honor; his safety
is concerned. Before three days are passed the ruin of the
superintendent will be complete.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Stay,&quot; said the marquise, in her turn smiling, &quot;that is
going a little too fast.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I said three days, because I wish to deceive myself with a
hope; but probably the catastrophe will be complete within
twenty-four hours.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why so?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For the simplest of all reasons,  -  that M. Fouquet has no
more money.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In matters of finance, my dear Marguerite, some are without
money to-day, who to-morrow can procure millions.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That might be M. Fouquet's case when he had two wealthy and
clever friends who amassed money for him, and wrung it from
every possible or impossible source; but those friends are
dead.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Money does not die, Marguerite; it may be concealed, but it
can be looked for, bought and found.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You see things on the bright side, and so much the better
for you. It is really very unfortunate that you are not the
Egeria of M. Fouquet; you might now show him the source
whence he could obtain the millions which the king asked him
for yesterday.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Millions!&quot; said the marquise, in terror.</P>
<P>&quot;Four  -  an even number.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Infamous!&quot; murmured Madame de Belliere, tortured by her
friend's merciless delight.</P>
<P>&quot;M. Fouquet, I should think, must certainly have four
millions,&quot; she replied, courageously.</P>
<P>&quot;If he has those which the king requires to-day,&quot; said
Marguerite, &quot;he will not, perhaps, possess those which the
king will demand in a month or so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The king will exact money from him again, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No doubt; and that is my reason for saying that the ruin of
poor M. Fouquet is inevitable. Pride will induce him to
furnish the money, and when he has no more, he will fall.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is true,&quot; said the marquise, trembling; &quot;the plan is a
bold one; but tell me, does M. Colbert hate M. Fouquet so
very much?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I think he does not like him. M. Colbert is powerful; he
improves on close acquaintance, he has gigantic ideas, a
strong will, and discretion, he will rise.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He will be superintendent?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is probable. Such is the reason, my dear marquise, why I
felt myself impressed in favor of that poor man, who once
loved, and even adored me; and why, when I see him so
unfortunate, I forgive his infidelity which I have reason to
believe he also regrets; and why, moreover, I should not
have been disinclined to afford him some consolation, or
some good advice; he would have understood the step I had
taken, and would have thought kindly of me for it. It is
gratifying to be loved, you know. Men value love more highly
when they are no longer blinded by its influence.&quot;</P>
<P>The marquise, bewildered and overcome by these cruel
attacks, which had been calculated with the greatest nicety
and precision, hardly knew what answer to return; she even
seemed to have lost all power of thought. Her perfidious
friend's voice had assumed the most affectionate tone; she
spoke as a woman, but concealed the instincts of a wolf.</P>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot; said Madame de Belliere, who had a vague hope that
Marguerite would cease to overwhelm a vanquished enemy, &quot;why
do you not go and see M. Fouquet?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Decidedly, marquise, you have made me reflect. No, it would
be unbecoming for me to make the first advance. M. Fouquet
no doubt loves me, but he is too proud. I cannot expose
myself to an affront.... besides I have my husband to
consider. You tell me nothing? Very well, I shall consult M.
Colbert on the subject.&quot; Marguerite rose smilingly, as
though to take leave, but the marquise had not the strength
to imitate her. Marguerite advanced a few paces, in order
that she might continue to enjoy the humiliating grief in
which her rival was plunged, and then said, suddenly,  - 
&quot;You do not accompany me to the door, then?&quot; The marquise
rose, pale and almost lifeless, without thinking of the
envelope, which had occupied her attention so greatly at the
commencement of the conversation, and which was revealed at
the first step she took. She then opened the door of her
oratory, and without even turning her head towards
Marguerite Vanel, entered it, closing the door after her.
Marguerite said, or rather muttered a few words, which
Madame de Belliere did not even hear. As soon, however, as
the marquise had disappeared, her envious enemy, not being
able to resist the desire to satisfy herself that her
suspicions were well founded, advanced stealthily towards it
like a panther and seized the envelope. &quot;Ah!&quot; she said,
gnashing her teeth, &quot;it was indeed a letter from M. Fouquet
she was reading when I arrived,&quot; and then darted out of the
room. During this interval, the marquise, having arrived
behind the rampart, as it were, of her door, felt that her
strength was failing her; for a moment she remained rigid,
pale and motionless as a statue, and then, like a statue
shaken on its base by an earthquake, tottered and fell
inanimate on the carpet. The noise of the fall resounded at
the same moment as the rolling of Marguerite's carriage
leaving the hotel.</P></div>
