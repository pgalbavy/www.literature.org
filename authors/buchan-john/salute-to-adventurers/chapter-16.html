<p>'Twas the same high summer weather through which I had ridden
a fortnight ago with a dull heart on my way to the duel. Now Grey
rode by my side, and my spirits were as light as a bird's. I had
forgotten the grim part of the enterprise, the fate that might
await me, the horrors we should certainly witness. I thought only
of the joys of movement into new lands with tried companions.
These last months I had borne a pretty heavy weight of cares.
Now that was past. My dispositions completed, the thing was in
the hands of God, and I was free to go my own road. Mocking-birds
and thrushes cried in the thickets, squirrels flirted across the
path, and now and then a shy deer fled before us. There come moments
to every man when he is thankful to be alive, and every breath
drawn is a delight; so at that hour I praised my Maker for His
good earth, and for sparing me to rejoice in it.</p>

<p>Grey had met me with a certain shyness; but as the sun rose and
the land grew bright he, too, lost his constraint, and fell into
the same happy mood. Soon we were smiling at each other in the
frankest comradeship, we two who but the other day had carried
ourselves like game-cocks. He had forgotten his fine manners and
his mincing London voice, and we spoke of the outland country
of which he knew nothing, and of the hunting of game of which
he knew much, exchanging our different knowledges, and willing
to learn from each other. Long ere we had reached York Ferry I
had found that there was much in common between the Scots trader
and the Virginian cavalier, and the chief thing we shared was
youth.</p>

<p>Mine, to be sure, was more in the heart, while Grey wore his
open and fearless. He plucked the summer flowers and set them
in his hat. He was full of catches and glees, so that he waked
the echoes in the forest glades. Soon I, too, fell to singing
in my tuneless voice, and I answered his "My lodging is on the
cold ground" with some Scots ballad or a song of Davie Lindsay.
I remember how sweetly he sang Colonel Lovelace's ode to Lucasta,
writ when going to the wars:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"True, a new mistress now I chase,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first foe in the field;<br/>
&nbsp;And with a stronger faith embrace<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sword, a horse, a shield."

</p>
<p>
"Yet this inconstancy is such<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As thou too shalt adore:<br/>
&nbsp;I could not love thee, dear, so much,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loved I not Honour more."

</p>
</div>
<p>I wondered if that were my case&mdash;if I rode out for honour, and
not for the pure pleasure of the riding. And I marvelled more
to see the two of us, both lovers of one lady and eager rivals,
burying for the nonce our feuds, and with the same hope serving
the same cause.</p>

<p>We slept the night at Aird's store, and early the next morning
found Ringan. A new Ringan indeed, as unlike the buccaneer I knew
as he was unlike the Quaker. He was now the gentleman of Breadalbane,
dressed for the part with all the care of an exquisite. He rode
a noble roan, in his Spanish belt were stuck silver-hafted pistols,
and a long sword swung at his side. When I presented Grey to him,
he became at once the cavalier, as precise in his speech and polite
in his deportment as any Whitehall courtier. They talked high
and disposedly of genteel matters, and you would have thought
that that red-haired pirate had lived his life among proud lords
and high-heeled ladies. That is ever the way of the Highlander.
He alters like a clear pool to every mood of the sky, so that
the shallow observer might forget how deep the waters are.</p>

<p>Presently, when we had ridden into the chestnut forests of the
Mattaponey, he began to forget his part. Grey, it appeared, was
a student of campaigns, and he and Ringan were deep in a discussion
of Conde's battles, in which both showed surprising knowledge.
But the glory of the weather and of the woodlands, new as they
were to a seafarer, set his thoughts wandering, and he fell to
tales of his past which consorted ill with his former decorum.
There was a madcap zest in his speech, something so merry and
wild, that Grey, who had fallen back into his Tidewater manners,
became once more the careless boy. We stopped to eat in a glade
by a slow stream, and from his saddle-bags Ringan brought out
strange delicacies. There were sugared fruits from the Main, and
orange sirop from Jamaica, and a kind of sweet punch made by the
Hispaniola Indians. As we ate and drank he would gossip about
the ways of the world; and though he never mentioned his own doings,
there was such an air of mastery about him as made him seem the
centre figure of his tales, I could see that Grey was mightily
captivated, and all afternoon he plied him with questions, and
laughed joyously at his answers. As we camped that night, while
Grey was minding his horse Ringan spoke of him to me.</p>

<p>"I like the lad, Andrew. He has the makings of a very proper
gentleman, and he has the sense to be young. What I complain of
in you is that you're desperate old. I wonder whiles if you ever
were a laddie. For me, though I'm ten years the elder of the pair
of you, I've no more years than your friend, and I'm a century
younger than you. That's the Highland way. There's that in our
blood that keeps our eyes young though we may be bent double.
With us the heart is aye leaping till Death grips us. To my mind
it's a lovable character that I fain would cherish. If I couldn't
sing on a spring morning or say a hearty grace over a good dinner
I'd be content to be put away in a graveyard."</p>

<p>And that, I think, is the truth. But at the time I was feeling
pretty youthful, too, though my dour face and hard voice were
a bad clue to my sentiments.</p>

<p>Next day on the Rappahannock we found Shalah, who had gone on
to warn the two men I proposed to enlist. One of them, Donaldson,
was a big, slow-spoken, middle-aged farmer, the same who had been
with Bacon in the fight at Occaneechee Island. He just cried to
his wife to expect him back when she saw him, slung on his back
an old musket, cast a long leg over his little horse, and was
ready to follow. The other, the Frenchman Bertrand, was a quiet,
slim gentleman, who was some kin to the murdered D'Aubignys. I
had long had my eye on him, for he was very wise in woodcraft,
and had learned campaigning under old Turenne. He kissed his two
children again and again, and his wife clung to his arms. There
were tears in the honest fellow's eyes as he left, and I thought
all the more of him, for he is the bravest man who has most to
risk. I mind that Ringan consoled the lady in the French tongue,
which I did not comprehend, and would not be hindered from getting
out his saddle-bags and comforting the children with candied plums.
He had near as grave a face as Bertrand when we rode off, and
was always looking back to the homestead. He spoke long to the
Frenchman in his own speech, and the sad face of the latter began
to lighten.</p>

<p>I asked him what he said.</p>

<p>"Just that he was the happy man to have kind hearts to weep for
him. A fine thing for a landless, childless fellow like me to
say! But it's gospel truth, Andrew. I told him that his bairns
would be great folks some day, and that their proudest boast would
be that their father had ridden on this errand. Oh, and all the
rest of the easy consolations. If it had been me, I would not
have been muckle cheered. It's well I never married, for I would
not have had the courage to leave my fireside."</p>

<p>We were now getting into a new and far lovelier country. The
heavy forests and swamps which line the James and the York had
gone, and instead we had rolling spaces of green meadowland, and
little hills which stood out like sentinels of the great blue
chain of mountains that hung in the west. Instead of the rich
summer scents of the Tidewater, we had the clean, sharp smell
of uplands, and cool winds relieved the noontide heat. By and
by we struck the Rapidan, a water more like our Scots rivers,
flowing in pools and currents, very different from the stagnant
reaches of the Pamunkey. We were joined for a little bit by two
men from Stafford county, who showed us the paths that horses
could travel.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon that we reached a broad meadow hemmed
in by noble cedars. I knew without telling that we were come to
the scene of the tragedy, and with one accord we fell silent.
The place had been well looked after, for a road had been made
through the woods, and had been carried over marshy places on
a platform of cedar piles. Presently we came to a log fence with
a gate, which hung idly open. Within was a paddock, and beyond
another fence, and beyond that a great pile of blackened timber.
The place was so smiling and homelike under the westering sun
that one looked to see a trim steading with the smoke of hearth
fires ascending, and to hear the cheerful sounds of labour and
of children's voices. Instead there was this grim, charred heap,
with the light winds swirling the ashes.</p>

<p>Every man of us uncovered his head as he rode towards the melancholy
place. I noticed a little rosary, which had been carefully tended,
but horses had ridden through it, and the blossoms were trailing
crushed on the ground. There was a flower garden too, much trampled,
and in one corner a little stream of water had been led into a
pool fringed with forget-me-nots. A tiny water-wheel was turning
in the fall, a children's toy, and the wheel still turned, though
its owners had gone. The sight of that simple thing fairly brought
my heart to my mouth.</p>

<p>That inspection was a gruesome business. One of the doorposts
of the house still stood, and it was splashed with blood. On the
edge of the ashes were some charred human bones. No one could
tell whose they were, perhaps a negro's, perhaps the little mistress
of the water-wheel. I looked at Ringan, and he was smiling, but
his eyes were terrible. The Frenchman Bertrand was sobbing like
a child.</p>

<p>We took the bones, and made a shallow grave for them in the rosary.
We had no spades, but a stake did well enough to dig a resting-place
for those few poor remains. I said over them the Twenty-third
Psalm: "<em>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow
of death, I will fear no evil; for Thou art with me; Thy rod and
Thy staff shall comfort me</em>."</p>

<p>Then suddenly our mood changed. Nothing that we could do could
help the poor souls whose bones lay among the ashes. But we could
bring their murderers to book, and save others from a like fate.</p>

<p>We moved away from the shattered place to the ford in the river
where the road ran north. There we looked back. A kind of fury
seized me as I saw that cruel defacement. In a few hours we ourselves
should be beyond the pale, among those human wolves who were so
much more relentless than any beasts of the field. As I looked
round our little company, I noted how deep the thing had bitten
into our souls. Ringan's eyes still danced with that unholy blue
light. Grey was very pale, and his jaw was set grimly. Bertrand
had ceased from sobbing, and his face had the far-away wildness
of the fanatic, such a look as his forbears may have worn at the
news of St. Bartholomew. The big man Donaldson looked puzzled
and sombre. Only Shalah stood impassive and aloof, with no trace
of feeling on the bronze of his countenance.</p>

<p>"This is the place for an oath," I said. "We are six men against
an army, but we fight for a holy cause. Let us swear to wipe out
this deed of blood in the blood of its perpetrators. God has made
us the executors of His judgments against horrid cruelty."</p>

<p>We swore, holding our hands high, that, when our duty to the
dominion was done, we should hunt down the Cherokees who had done
this deed till no one of them was left breathing. At that moment
of tense nerves, no other purpose would have contented us.</p>

<p>"How will we find them?" quoth Ringan. "To sift a score of murderers
out of a murderous nation will be like searching the ocean for
a wave."</p>

<p>Then Shalah spoke.</p>

<p>"The trail is ten suns old, but I can follow it. The men were
of the Meebaw tribe by this token." And he held up a goshawk's
feather. "The bird that dropped that lives beyond the peaks of
Shubash. The Meebaw are quick hunters and gross eaters, and travel
slow. We will find them by the Tewawha."</p>

<p>"All in good time," I said. "Retribution must wait till we have
finished our task. Can you find the Meebaw men again?"</p>

<p>"Yea," said Shalah, "though they took wings and flew over the
seas I should find them."</p>

<p>Then we hastened away from that glade, none speaking to the other.
We camped an hour's ride up the river, in a place secure against
surprises in a crook of the stream with a great rock at our back.
We were outside the pale now, and must needs adopt the precautions
of a campaign; so we split the night into watches, I did my two
hours sentry duty at that dead moment of the dark just before
the little breeze which is the precursor of dawn, and I reflected
very soberly on the slender chances of our returning from this
strange wild world and its cruel mysteries.</p>
