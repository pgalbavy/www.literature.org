<p>Deerfoot did not interrupt the Blackfoot while he was relating
the legend of the Spirit Circle. He listened attentively. He had
heard many such myths among his own people, and once they impressed
him, but he had come to look upon them as idle tales not worth
a thought. Instead of commenting upon the rude beauty of the story
that had been told to his friend many years before, he asked the
practical question:</p>

<p>"What has the Spirit Circle to do with Deerfoot and Taggarak?"</p>

<p>"It is the law among the Blackfeet that when our war chief Taggarak
wills to punish some great criminal he sends him to the Spirit
Circle, where he must walk around it without food or drink till
he drops down and dies."</p>

<p>"Has anyone ever done that?" asked the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>"Yes; more than once. Not many moons ago a warrior killed his
father, mother and child in a fit of rage. The only punishment
that fitted such an awful crime was that of the Spirit Circle.
Three warriors took the man there and started him round the path;
they took turns in watching, and made sure that he had no food
nor water, and was kept moving till he could move no longer. He
fell down, and they stood near until he breathed his last; then
they came back to Taggarak and told him what had been done."</p>

<p>"My brother has not yet shown what his words have to do with
Deerfoot and Taggarak."</p>

<p>"Let my brother have patience and he shall know. Deerfoot remembers
the rock from whose top he first caught sight of Mul-tal-la, whose
brother was coming to this village, riding on Whirlwind?"</p>

<p>As he spoke the Blackfoot pointed to the east. Deerfoot nodded.
The meeting place was a half mile beyond the open space on which
the athletic contests had been held that day.</p>

<p>"It is the command of Taggarak that the Shawanoe shall meet him
there to-morrow, when the sun climbs the mountain tops. He must
bring only his hunting knife and come alone; the chief will do
the same. When they face each other, Taggarak will give the Shawanoe
the choice of dying by his hand or at the Spirit Circle."</p>

<p>"Did Taggarak say <em>that</em> to my brother?"</p>

<p>"That is his command. He has heard that the Shawanoe is making
squaws of his warriors; he therefore gives him his choice of deaths."</p>

<p>Victor Shelton sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"See here, Mul-tal-la," he said, excitedly; "do you tell us that
the chief Taggarak makes the condition that he and Deerfoot are
each to use only his knife as a weapon?"</p>

<p>The Blackfoot gravely nodded his head.</p>

<p>"And that neither is to have a friend with him?"</p>

<p>"So Taggarak wills."</p>

<p>"That isn't the way people fight duels. George and I must be
on hand when Deerfoot gets into a scrape like that."</p>

<p>"But it cannot be."</p>

<p>"My brothers will stay here till Deerfoot comes back to them,"
quietly remarked the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>"But how are we to know that Taggarak won't play some trick on
us? He may have half a dozen of his warriors hiding among the
bushes or rocks, so as to help him kill Deerfoot."</p>

<p>For the first time in the interview Mul-tal-la smiled.</p>

<p>"Taggarak never breaks his word. He might do as my brothers say
if he thought there was need of it. He doesn't believe the Shawanoe
will be more than a child in his hands when the two stand in front
of each other."</p>

<p>"He might have thought that yesterday, or at any time before
the games to-day, but after he saw Deerfoot perform he must have
some doubt."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot did not fight. Taggarak knows naught of his skill in
doing that, even though he has been told he killed a grizzly bear
in a fair struggle. He would feel ashamed if he asked for any
help against the Shawanoe."</p>

<p>Deerfoot calmly rose to his feet. Those who looked up at him
noted a peculiar flash of his dark eyes that was not often seen,
and, when seen, told of the hidden fires he was holding in subjection.
He raised his hand for silence.</p>

<p>"Let Deerfoot speak. He knows where the rock is that Taggarak
says shall be the meeting place between him and me. His command
shall be obeyed. Deerfoot will be there, with only his knife to
defend himself. He has said he does not fear the Blackfoot chieftain.
Let my brothers speak of something else."</p>

<p>The boys and even Mul-tal-la were so full of the theme that it
was hard for them to talk or think of anything beside. They would
have questioned the Shawanoe as to his plans and intentions, but
he would not permit. The hour was growing late, and the Blackfoot
remained but a short time, when he bade all good-night and passed
out of the tepee.</p>

<p>Respecting the mood of Deerfoot, neither Victor nor George made
any further reference to the momentous morrow. They disrobed and
stretched out on their soft couches, while the Shawanoe, taking
his Bible from the bosom of his hunting shirt, reclined on one
elbow&mdash;his favorite attitude at such times&mdash;so that the light
fell on the printed page. He read in his low, musical voice until,
suspecting the truth, he paused and looked across at the brothers.
Both were asleep. He smiled, read awhile longer to himself and
then joined them in the land of dreams, sinking into slumber as
quickly as they, and within the ten minutes following his own
prayer.</p>

<p>The morning dawned dull, chilly and clouded, with threats of
snow in the air. The Shawanoe was the first to awake, and busied
himself in his usual noiseless fashion with renewing the fire
and preparing the morning meal from the antelope meat, of which
enough was on hand to last for several meals. The salt and pepper
brought by the boys from home had been used up long before, and
they had accustomed themselves to get on without the condiments
which seem so much of a necessity with us.</p>

<p>The breakfast was eaten with the usual deliberation, none of
the three speaking of the event that was impending, though the
brothers were full of it. When Deerfoot arose, drew his knife
from his girdle, carefully inspected it and then shoved it back
in place and glanced across the room to where his rifle was leaning
in one corner, Victor could keep silence no longer.</p>

<p>"You know what faith we have in you, Deerfoot, but we are anxious,
and shall be in distress until we see you back again."</p>

<p>"Why are my brothers troubled?" calmly asked the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>"We can't help believing Taggarak will use treachery, for he
must know he isn't certain to win when he attacks you."</p>

<p>"Nothing can make him believe the truth till it comes to him.
He will take no warriors with him. Deerfoot is in no danger. Let
my brothers smile and be glad."</p>

<p>"I wish I could grin, but it's too hard work," was the doleful
response of Victor, the face of his brother showing that he felt
the same.</p>

<p>Deerfoot warmly shook hands with each in turn, such being his
usual custom, stooped and drew the flap aside and passed from
sight. Enough of the Blackfeet were astir to notice him moving
at a moderate pace past the lodges toward the clearing at the
rear of the village. He greeted all in their own language, and
did not show by anything in his manner that he had any important
matter in hand. He stealthily glanced here and there, on the lookout
for Taggarak, but saw nothing of him. Perhaps the chief had already
gone to the scene of the hostile meeting; perhaps he had not yet
set out, for the hour was early, or, what was more likely, he
had taken another route. Of one thing Deerfoot was certain: the
chief had told no one of what was coming, except Mul-tal-la, who
bore the message to the youth. When the two combatants should
meet, no human eye must witness the terrific combat.</p>

<p>The sagacious Shawanoe had decided to follow a certain line that
may impress you as singular for him to adopt. It seemed like undue
confidence when he declared that he had no fear of the man who
was certainly the most fearful fighter of the whole Blackfoot
tribe. Modest as he was by nature, Deerfoot was too intelligent
not to understand his decisive superiority, as compared with any
of his own or of the white race. That superiority had been proved
too often to leave any doubt in his mind. Moreover, with his youth
and high health, he was aware that these remarkable powers were
not declining, but rather increasing, and ought to increase for
a dozen or more years to come.</p>

<p>The American Indian, as a rule, does not show excessive muscular
development. Arms and legs are wanting in those ridged bunches
of sinew which often bulge out all over our athletes. And yet
more than one red man has displayed prodigious strength. Deerfoot
believed he was stronger than Taggarak, despite his own light,
graceful figure, which made him a dusky Adonis.</p>

<p>He knew that possibly he was mistaken in this respect, but there
could be no doubt on another point: he was much quicker of movement
than the iron-limbed Taggarak. The open space would give full
freedom to both, and this quickness would not be hampered at all
during the fight between them. Moreover, Deerfoot was an unerring
judge of distance, and knew on the instant when to dodge and when
to strike. Therefore he feared not, but with that old Adamic strain
in his nature, really yearned for the battle.</p>

<p>It has long been the custom of Indians, when facing each other
in mortal strife, to resort to taunts and insults. If a foe can
be driven into anger, while his tormentor keeps cool, the latter
has the victory half won. Deerfoot could not stifle a feeling
of resentment over the contemptuous behavior of Taggarak toward
him. Instead of contenting himself with merely challenging the
Shawanoe to mortal combat, he sent him word that all that was
left for him to do was to choose between two methods of shuffling
off the mortal coil. It was to be the Spirit Circle or by the
knife of the Blackfoot. This scornful treatment of the youth angered
him, and it was one of the reasons why he decided to adopt a policy
which in other circumstances he would have considered beneath
a true warrior.</p>
