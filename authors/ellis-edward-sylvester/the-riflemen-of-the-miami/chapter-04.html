Be set forever in disgrace<br/>
The glory of the red-man's race,<br/>
If from the foe we turn our face,<br/>
Or safety seek in flight!<br/>

<p>Laughlin's signal of danger was accompanied by a meaning motion
up the creek, intended to direct the attention of the settlers
to that point. Looking in the direction indicated, they saw what
at first appeared nothing but a mere log or stump floating on
the water, but what, upon a closer inspection, it was evident,
had a deeper significance than that. It was near the center of
the current, drifting slowly downward, impelled certainly by nothing
more than the force of the stream itself. As it came nearer, it
proved to be three trees, partly trimmed of their branches, and
secured together, a contrivance in the formation of which the
hand of man most surely must have been concerned.</p>

<p>"Some Injin deviltry!" muttered the older Smith, as he lay on
his face with the other settlers. "It'll be dangerous to be too
curious. Jest keep an eye on the concern, from where you lie,
and if you see a top-knot, blaze away."</p>

<p>At this moment, a low whistle from the scouts on the opposite
bank warned all that this was no time for carelessness; and ceasing
their whispered remarks, the men turned their whole attention
toward the object in question. The children were all lying down
in the wagon, and the women crouched so low that no stray shot
could reach them. The greatest worriment was over the oxen. As
they stood, lazily chewing their cuds, their horns and eyes could
be plainly seen from the creek, so that any foes concealed in
the raft could shoot one or all of them, and thus inflict an irreparable
injury upon the whites. Although it was possible that such an
occurrence might take place, yet it was hardly probable the shots
would be expended upon such "small" game.</p>

<p>When directly opposite the settlers, the logs in question underwent
a most searching scrutiny from both shores, the result of which
was the conviction that no human being was nearer the suspicious
object than those engaged in scrutinizing it. Whatever had been
the intention of the Indians&mdash;for Indians undoubtedly they were
who had formed the raft&mdash;they had declined to risk their own persons
upon it, as it drifted down the current. This was so plain, that
Laughlin called out:</p>

<p>"You needn't be skeart, boys, there's no Injin <em>thar</em>;
so jest drive in and cross."</p>

<p>"Take another look first," cried out one of the settlers. "There
are Indians <em>somewhere</em> in these parts, for those trees
never grew together like that."</p>

<p>The advice of the settler was so sensible and timely, that Laughlin
and Smith acted upon it at once, withdrawing some yards from the
stream and proceeding some distance up it, with the same caution
that had characterized all their movements. The result of this
reconnoissance was the same as the other. If there were any savages
at all in the vicinity, they were so carefully concealed that
the skill of the two whites could avail nothing in discovering
them. This being reported, preparations were resumed for crossing.</p>

<p>It should be remarked, that the creek, a short distance above
the fording-place, made a bend, thus limiting the view of the
whites considerably. This being the case, the other son of Smith
stationed himself at this curve, to give notice of the approach
of any danger. Every thing being in readiness, the oxen were driven
into the water, which was accomplished very easily, as all four
were thirsty.</p>

<p>The progress was necessarily slow, the wheels of the wagon sinking
so deep in the muddy bottom that the united efforts of the four
powerful oxen were barely able to move it. The deepest portion
was passed ere one-third of the stream was crossed, the men being
compelled to place their hands to the wheels to keep them moving.</p>

<p>It was at this moment, and just as the wagon-body raised several
inches from the water, that an exclamation from young Smith startled
all. Looking toward him, they saw him raise his rifle and fire
at something in the creek, and then fall flat on his face. The
next moment a raft, precisely similar to the first, came in view,
floating somewhat nearer the left bank, so that it would pass
between the shore and the wagon, provided the latter remained
stationary.</p>

<p>"There are Injins on that," called out Smith from his hiding-place.
"I seen their top-knots."</p>

<p>The whites understood their peril at once. The oxen were lashed
and goaded, until they slipped on their faces in their efforts
to pull the wagon forward, while the men caught the wheels and
turned them round and round without moving the wagon a particle.
All depended upon reaching the shore before the Indians could
come upon them, for, beyond a doubt, there were Indians concealed
upon the raft which was so rapidly nearing them. For a dozen feet
or so the wagon moved readily; but at this point it sunk below
the hubs, and the united strength of men and oxen utterly failed
to move it&mdash;this, too, occurring when the position was such that
the approaching raft must pass so close as almost to touch it!</p>

<p>"No use, boys," called out Mr. Smith. "Get your rifles ready
for the imps."</p>

<p>Most of the men had placed their guns in the wagon while toiling
at the wheels, and they now caught them and stood on the defensive.
As yet, nothing could be seen of the savages who were concealed
upon the raft, but a moment later, the logs swerved over toward
the shore which the settlers had just left. Thus it was plain
that the Indians, seeing the true state of affairs, were as anxious
to avoid the collision as the whites had been. The water being
shallow, they were able to place their feet upon the bottom, and
thus move the raft readily. As is generally the case, the courage
of the whites increased in proportion as they discovered that
of the Indians diminishing, and the proposal was made by one to
wade over to the contrivance and demolish it. The better sense
of the others, however, prevailed, and they maintained the defensive
only.</p>

<p>As the raft came down-stream, it continued veering over to the
shore so much, that if it passed the wagon at all, it would do
so by a safe distance. All at once, as the expectant settlers
were looking at it with the most acute attention, some one called
out:</p>

<p>"Look <em>under</em> the concern."</p>

<p>All, of course, did so, and all distinctly saw in the clear water,
directly under the raft, some ten or twelve human feet walking
along on the bottom. Not only the feet themselves, but the legs,
as far up as the knees, could be seen, and they formed a most
curious sight mixing promiscuously together, as it seemed, while
moving forward. The raft thus had the appearance of some great
aquatic monster, whose ridged back floated on the surface, while
his feet traversed the bottom. The bodies of the Indians, of course,
were above the current; but being prone, the logs being arranged
for that especial purpose, they were effectually concealed from
view.</p>

<p>In a moment, the raft floated over that portion of the river
which had been muddied by the passage of the wagon, and the feet
of the Indians became invisible. When they had crossed it, they
were too far down to be seen, and thus the logs went onward, moving
so much faster than the current that they left a wake behind them.</p>

<p>"All together now&mdash;once more!" said the older Smith, catching
hold of one of the wheels. The others did the same, and the oxen
having had sufficient rest the combined strength of all started
the wagon, and a few moments later it went up the bank on dry
land and entered the woods.</p>

<p>With a want of foresight that was unaccountable, the settlers
had failed to pay any further attention to the raft after it was
fairly below them. Perhaps it was the recollection of this that
led the elder Smith and one of his friends to walk down to the
bank and look for it. They descried it, lying against their own
side of the creek, not more than two hundred yards distant, and,
at the very moment their eyes rested upon it, they caught a shadowy
glimpse of an Indian, as he flitted noiselessly from it into the
wood. As they waited and saw no more, they rightly judged that
he was the last one, the others having landed entirely unobserved.</p>

<p>"That looks bad," said Smith, "we are not done with the rascals
yet."</p>

<p>At this moment son Jim, who was still on the other side of the
creek, called out that eight Indians had landed, and were stealing
up the river bank to attack the party. His words were heard, and
every man dropped on his face in the wood, and with loaded rifles
waited the assault. They had scarcely done so when the sharp explosion
of several guns broke the stillness, and the two foremost oxen,
with a wild bellow of agony, sunk to the ground and died. The
brutes behind them imitated their motion, although operated upon
solely by their own sense of weariness. They thus unconsciously
did the wisest thing possible under the circumstances, as the
shots that were afterward fired passed harmlessly over them.</p>

<p>For the space of twenty minutes after this incident, a perfect
silence reigned in the wood. These twenty minutes were occupied
by the Shawnees in getting in a position to pick off the settlers.
The latter could see them dodging from tree to tree, and coming
closer and closer every moment. Emboldened by their immunity thus
far, they became more incautious, until several exposed themselves
so plainly that the elder Smith and one of the settlers fired
precisely at the same moment, each one shooting a savage dead.
A whole volley was returned, several bullets cutting the shrubbery
and bushes over the heads of the settlers, while others passed
through the wagon-covering, evidently fired with intent against
the women and children in it. These shots accomplished nothing,
as the latter kept their heads below the top of the heavy oaken
sides, which were proof against the best rifle ever discharged.</p>

<p>The two shots of the settlers for a time created a sort of panic
with the Indians. They retreated far more rapidly than they had
come up, and in a few moments were invisible. The whites were
too well versed in Indian ways and strategy to take this as a
genuine retreat, knowing that in a few moments they would return
more furious than ever.</p>

<p>There was an advantage in favor of the settlers of which, up
to this moment, they had not been aware. Some fifty yards below
them was an open space over forty feet in width, across which
the Shawnees hurried pell mell into the cover beyond. Here they
were reinforced by some half-dozen Indians of their own tribe,
who had been in the vicinity and had been attracted by the sound
of firing. The assailants now numbered about a dozen, and confident
in their strength, made ready for the final attack.</p>

<p>All this time young Smith, upon the opposite side of the creek,
was engaged in watching the Shawnees as well as he could from
his covert. He now called out to the whites that they were about
to advance again, and that he would pick off one at least as they
passed across the open space referred to. A moment later, the
crack of his rifle showed that he had kept his word and that the
crisis of the contest was upon them.</p>

<p>Young Smith had fired just at the moment the foremost Indian
came in view. The other had advanced to a point about half way
across the opening, when five spouts of flame burst from the thick
shrubbery upon the opposite side of the creek; there was the simultaneous
report of as many rifles, and five messengers of death went tearing
among the Shawnees, mangling, killing and scattering them like
chaff in the whirlwind.</p>

<p>"<em>The Riflemen of the Miami!</em>" shouted Laughlin, in a
delirium of joy, springing to his feet and swinging his cap over
his head. All eyes, in a transport of pleasure, were turned toward
the spot where the thin, blueish smoke of their rifles was rising,
but for a few moments nothing was seen. At the expiration of that
time, the manly form of Lewis Dernor rose to view, and, with a
nod of recognition, he stepped into the stream and commenced wading
across, closely followed by young Smith, who, up to the moment
of the discharge of the rifles, had no more suspicion the hunters
were in the vicinity than had the Shawnees themselves.</p>

<p>It scarcely need be said that the welcome which the settlers
extended to the hunter was of the most hearty and genuine kind.
Through his instrumentality they felt they all had been saved
from massacre at the hands of the Shawnees.</p>

<p>"But where are your men?" asked several.</p>

<p>"Upon the opposite side. They will cross over shortly."</p>

<p>"And will they accompany us?"</p>

<p>"They will not leave you until you have reached your destination."</p>

<p>"The Indians will not trouble us again?"</p>

<p>"No, I think not; but the boys can go with you as well as not,
and I make this arrangement as a sort of compensation for my failure
to keep my appointment."</p>

<p>"Your absence did excite much wonder, but you came up in the
nick of time, most certainly."</p>

<p>"Sego, unconsciously, was the cause of our delay. He was absent
at the time I reached the Miami. We could have come on without
him, of course; but, as I was pretty sure a large body of Indians
were going to attack you, I thought it best not to come until
we were all together."</p>

<p>The Rifleman spoke with such sadness that all noticed it and
felt great curiosity to know the cause. There was but one who
dared to question him, the elder Smith, and he at once called
him aside.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Lew?" he asked. "I never saw you act so odd.
Come, out with it."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's nothing the matter with me," replied Dernor, his
very manner showing an increase of his embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Yes, now, I know there is. Let's hear it."</p>

<p>The bronzed face of the hunter took a deeper hue as he asked:</p>

<p>"Is she &mdash;Edith with you?"</p>

<p>"Of course she is," laughed Smith, a dim, vague idea of his meaning
beginning to make its way through his brain.</p>

<p>"To tell the truth, then, Smith, there is one man of ours that
I <em>must</em> prevent from seeing her."</p>

<p>Smith looked up in amazement. Lewis proceeded:</p>

<p>"The distance from here to the settlement toward which you are
journeying is not more than forty miles. Let me take Edith and
make that journey alone. I have traveled the ground often enough,
and I will lead her through the woods safely and much sooner than
you can perform the same journey. This is the only favor I have
ever asked or expect to ask of you. Don't refuse it.</p>

<p>"Why, my heavens! who intended to refuse it? Take her? Of course
you may, provided she is willing, for where could she be safer
than in the charge of Lew Dernor? Nowhere, I cac'late."</p>

<p>"You please tell her that it is <em>necessary</em>, then, will
you?"</p>

<p>Old Smith hastened away, and told Edith Sudbury that her own
safety demanded that she should place herself under the care of
the hunter, who would conduct her safely to the settlement. She
exhibited some natural hesitation at first, but having perfect
confidence both in Smith, who so long had acted the part of father
toward her, and in Dernor, who had manifested such interest in
her welfare, she made her preparations. Smith simply stated to
the others that this singular proceeding was imperatively necessary,
and requested them not to refer to it in the presence of the other
hunters.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the four remaining Riflemen stepped into
the stream, and commenced wading across. As they did so, Edith
Sudbury and the hunter plunged into the forest, and commenced
their eventful journey to the settlement.</p>
