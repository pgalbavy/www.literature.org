<p>Two white men had set out to do whatever lay in their power to
rescue little Mabel Ashbridge from the hands of the Shawanoes,
and their policy was diametrically opposed to each other.</p>

<p>Simon Kenton, it may be said, had but one law&mdash;that of fighting
fire with fire. Against cunning, woodcraft and daring he would
array precisely the same weapons. In short, he knew of no other
method, and would have laughed to scorn any different line of
procedure, with the single exception of its attempt by the one
man who now resorted to it.</p>

<p>Mr. Finley, the missionary, knowing the futility of the course
laid down by Kenton, Boone and those of his calling, determined
to go directly into the camp of The Panther, and try to induce
the fiery chieftain to surrender the little girl to her friends.</p>

<p>What task could be more hopeless?</p>

<p>The unquenchable hatred of Wa-on-mon toward all who belonged
to the Caucasian race has been learned long ago by the reader.
He belonged to the most untamable of his people, and had proven
a continual stumbling-block in the path of the missionary. He
shut his ears resolutely against the pleadings of the good man,
and forbade him to speak to him of the God who taught gentleness,
charity, love and the forgiveness of enemies.</p>

<p>And yet, as Finley told Jethro Juggens, he had hunted with The
Panther, slept in his lodge and trusted his life in his hands
many times, and under ordinary circumstances would not hesitate
to do so again.</p>

<p>But those were periods when comparative peace reigned on the
frontier, and the missionary, like many others of his sacred calling,
found little trouble in passing back and forth among the Shawanoes,
Wyandots, Pottawatomies, Delawares and other tribes. Indeed, many
converts were gained, as was shown in the case of the Moravian
Indians.</p>

<p>When hostilities broke out, however, and the fierce red men daubed
their faces with paint and rushed upon the war-path, the missionaries
were wise enough to leave them alone and keep out of the way until
the tempest had passed.</p>

<p>War was coming again, of that there could be no doubt, and on
its threshold, at its very opening, Wa-on-mon, the tiger-like
chief, known even among his own people as The Panther, had been
subjected to an indignity at the hands of the pale-faces, such
as in his life had never been put upon him before. He had been
flung down, struck repeatedly, bound and kept a prisoner for many
hours.</p>

<p>Then escaping by the usual weapon of the red man&mdash;treachery&mdash;he
had laid a cunning ambuscade for the destruction of the large
party of pioneers and rangers. The scheme had miscarried, and
several of the foremost of the Shawanoe warriors had fallen before
their deadly fire.</p>

<p>The only panacea for this terrific chagrin was the capture of
the single small child attached to the families of the settlers.
She, the tender little flower, had been plucked by the merciless
chieftain, and none knew better than he what sweet revenge could
be secured through her upon the older ones.</p>

<p>Yes; she was in his power, and it was beyond the ability of any
one to take her from him.</p>

<p>And lo! at this moment, the man who preached humility and love
and gentleness and forgiveness of enemies was on the way to the
camp of The Panther to ask him to return the captive to her friends.</p>

<p>Missionary Finley did not need to be reminded of all this, and
it must be confessed that he would not have ventured upon the
attempt, so utter did he consider its hopelessness, but for an
extraordinary suggestion that Daniel Boone whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>This suggestion foreshadowed a complication, as among the possibilities,
from which a diversion might be created in favor of little Mabel
Ashbridge; but the possibility was so remote that the missionary
did not deem it right to awaken false hopes in the hearts of the
parents and brother by making known the scheme that had taken
shape in the most veteran of all pioneers.</p>

<p>Aside from all this was the fearful risk run personally by Finley,
in thus venturing into the hostile camp while, as may be said,
the echoes of the rifle shots were still lingering among the trees.
The chances were that, from The Panther down, there was not one
who would not shoot the missionary the instant he could draw bead
on him.</p>

<p>But this was a feature of the business that gave Finley the least
concern. It must not be supposed, however, that he was a reckless
man, who acted on the principle that Providence would take care
of him without the putting forth of any effort on his part. He
was a practical believer in the doctrine that God helps them that
help themselves.</p>

<p>When he paddled from the side of the flatboat, therefore, in
the cause, he put forth as much care and skill as Kenton or Boone
himself would have done.</p>

<p>Glancing over his shoulder, he noted the moment when the dim
outline of the wooded shore loomed to view. Then, the swinging
of his arms ceased for a few seconds while he peered off in the
gloom and listened. Nothing was seen or heard to cause misgiving,
or to show that any one had detected his approach.</p>

<p>"From what Kenton told me, the Shawanoes have a larger canoe
hidden somewhere along the bank. It has not yet appeared among
these sad troubles, but it must have a part to play, and I fear
it will be used to carry the warriors to the other side that they
may hurry my friends on their way to the block-house."</p>

<p>He did not cross the river in a direct line, but headed so far
up stream that his canoe became diagonal. His intention was to
strike the shore above Rattlesnake Gulch, thus keeping clear,
as he hoped, of the canoe with the warriors who might be making
ready to embark on it. At the same time, he was assured that he
would thus shorten the path to the campfire, where he expected
to find The Panther.</p>

<p>Still watching and listening, the missionary edged his way up
stream, until he had gone as far as he wished, bearing off so
that only the keenest eye of suspicion would have noticed his
presence from the shore. Then, turning the prow straight toward
land, he sent it skimming, like a swallow, over the surface by
means of a half-dozen powerful strokes, ducking his head as it
glided among the overhanging limbs, and its nose slid up the bank.
He was out of the little craft in a twinkling, and drawing it
still further so as to hold it secure, he set out, rifle in hand,
to meet Wa-on-mon, chief of the Shawanoes.</p>

<p>It need not be repeated that the missionary comprehended the
danger into which he was running, but, aside from the personal
intrepidity that distinguished him through life, he was controlled
and impelled by the highest of all motives that can direct the
conduct of men&mdash;the desire to please God.</p>

<p>Careful meditation over what had taken place convinced him that
it was his duty to enter the camp of the hostiles; and, with that
conviction, ended everything in the nature of hesitation.</p>

<p>Having landed, it remained for him to find The Panther. There
might be some persons, in the place of the reverend gentleman,
who would have conceived it the proper thing to enter the hostile
camp without carrying anything in the nature of a weapon; it may
be said, indeed, that his errand was in the nature of a flag of
truce, in which that course was demanded.</p>

<p>But Mr. Finley understood too well the nature of the people with
whom he was dealing to attempt anything of that nature. Such sentimentality
would be wasted. Besides he conceived it to be quite likely that
he might be called upon to defend himself, in which event the
gun would come in "mighty handy."</p>

<p>Engaged on the business described, the messenger did not add
to his peril by trying to steal noiselessly up to camp, though
the act might have been possible.</p>

<p>"I must advance openly," was his thought, "when near the camp,
and it is better I should do so from the first."</p>

<p>It was hard work picking his course through the dense and tangled
undergrowth, but, quite confident of the right direction to take,
he pushed on until the gleam of a light apprised him that no mistake
had been made.</p>

<p>And then, when within sight of The Panther and his ferocious
party, and half suspecting he was already under the eye of some
dusky sentinel, the missionary came to a halt, and, kneeling in
the solemn depths of the woods, spent several minutes in prayer.</p>

<p>The sound of a rustling near him did not hasten the end of his
devotions. When he had asked his Heavenly Father for all that
was in his mind, he rose to his feet and resumed his advance upon
the camp.</p>

<p>He knew he was followed, and that every step was watched, and
it was then that his own manner of procedure saved him. The Shawanoe
must have reasoned that no scout or person with hostile purpose
would act thus recklessly, and, though the dusky sentinel followed
and watched his course until the messenger came within the circle
of firelight, yet no harm was offered him.</p>

<p>Probably, by that time the Indian recognized the visitor as the
white man with such strange views, and so different in his words
and conduct from most of those of his race. If so, he must have
wondered at the temerity of the individual in entering the camp
of The Panther at so critical a time.</p>

<p>While yet some rods distant the missionary recognized the chieftain,
standing among his group of warriors, in excited conversation.
The back of Wa-on-mon was toward him, so that he did not observe
the white man; but he was quick to note the looks in the faces
of the others, and the general turning of eyes in one direction.
The chief also wheeled, and, to his astonishment, saw the man
of God approaching him.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the expression that overspread the painted
countenance of The Panther. He was angered at this intrusion of
a white man into his council of war, as it may be called. A muttered
exclamation escaped him, which those near interpreted as an utterance
of impatience that the visitor had been permitted to come even
thus far. He must have been identified long before, and, in accordance
with Indian custom, should have been shot or cut down ere he could
disturb the chieftain and his cabinet.</p>

<p>But here he was, showing no more hesitation than had marked his
course from the moment he left the side of the flatboat.</p>

<p>Mr. Finley, clad in his partly civilized costume, and with his
gun grasped in his left hand, walked forward, neither timidly
nor with an assumption of confidence it was impossible for him
to feel. He was not only too well aware of the situation himself,
but knew the Shawanoes could not be deceived by any such pretence
on his part.</p>

<p>Wa-on-mon had leaned his rifle against the fallen tree upon which
the three warriors were sitting when he first came up, so that
he stood with arms folded and in an attitude of natural and unconscious
grace, glancing from one painted countenance to another, as he
asked a question or listened to whatever they chose to say to
him.</p>

<p>It was evident that these were the most trusted of his warriors,
for while the consultation was going on, no one ventured near.
They may be considered as making up the chieftain's cabinet, and
when they were in session all other business had to wait.</p>

<p>The missionary was quick to note the expression on the face of
the terrible Wa-on-mon. He had seen a look there not so long before
which told more plainly than words that he was welcome, but that
time had passed.</p>

<p>Mr. Finley advanced with the same dignified step to the chief,
and, making a half-military salute, said in Shawanoe:</p>

<p>"I greet my brother Wa-on-mon, in whose lodge I have slept in
safety when there was no other place to lay my head."</p>

<p>As he spoke he extended his hand, but The Panther, with his serpent
eyes fixed upon the face of his visitor, made no motion to unfold
his arms. He continued to scowl, and his lips remained mute.</p>

<p>This was embarrassing to a certain extent, though the missionary
knew the cause. He continued, in the same gentle persuasive voice.</p>

<p>"Why does Wa-on-mon frown when he looks upon his pale-faced brother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is not my brother," interrupted The Panther, with a scowl
and look of indescribable fierceness. "He is a dog, and he shall
die!"</p>
