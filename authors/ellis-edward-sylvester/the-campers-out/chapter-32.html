<p>When the terrific roar of waters reached the ears of the three
Piketon Rangers in their tent, McGovern and Wagstaff started at
headlong speed up the right side of the valley toward higher ground,
the former succeeding in saving himself with the help of Dick
Halliard, while the latter lost his life.</p>

<p>Bob Budd turned the opposite way, impelled only by the wild desire
to escape, with little hope of doing so. But fortune was kinder
to him than to his companions. Had they followed his footsteps
they would have been saved with little difficulty, for the ground
on that side was not only freer from undergrowth, but rose so
much more rapidly than that on the opposite slope that his efforts
kept him ahead of the torrent, and he struck the level ground
where it was untouched by the flood.</p>

<p>But Bob was in a panic, and instead of waiting to see how his
friends made out, he broke into a run that was never stopped until,
panting and tired, he could barely stand. He was near his own
home, and sat down to reflect upon the situation.</p>

<p>He was clear of one danger, but he believed he was in another
equally to be dreaded. In fact, although he repressed all signs
of the agitation at the time, he was as uncomfortable as can be
imagined while talking with his companions before the giving way
of the mill-dam.</p>

<p>He believed that Dick Halliard was sure to make known his attack
on him. It was so flagrant in its nature that imprisonment was
inevitable, for when he came to think over the matter he lost
his faith in a triumphant alibi. He knew that Dick Halliard’s
simple assertion would outweigh all the perjuries he and his companions
could utter.</p>

<p>It was a fearful prospect, and Bob felt he could not face it.
There was but one escape that presented itself—that was flight.</p>

<p>Everything pointed to this as a successful recourse. The people
would believe he was drowned in the flood, as he believed Wagstaff
and McGovern had already been, and therefore they would not dream
of looking elsewhere. If he could get out of the neighborhood
without being recognized he would be safe.</p>

<p>He resolved to do so. Knowing that his uncle was absent, he managed
to climb into the rear of his own home without discovery. Making
his way to his room without disturbing any one, he changed his
clothing, putting on a slouch hat, which could be pulled down
over his face so as to hide most of his features. Then, drawing
up the collar of his coat, he sneaked out again by the way he
had entered without his presence having been suspected by his
aunt or any of the servants.</p>

<p>Bob always had abundance of money at command, so no inconvenience
was likely to result from lack of funds. It was three miles to
the nearest railroad station, but the walk was not a trying one
on this cool night in autumn, and he easily made it.</p>

<p>Luck was certainly with the young scapegrace on that eventful
evening. The hour was so late that he encountered only one person
on the road. He was an old farmer, so tipsy that he would not
have recognized his own mother in broad daylight. He paid no attention
to the solitary figure on the highway, with his slouch hat drawn
far down over his face and his collar about his ears, as though
it were midwinter.</p>

<p>Reaching the station just as the night express was starting,
he leaped upon the rear platform without stopping to purchase
a ticket, and thus escaped another danger of recognition. He saw
no one in the car that he knew, and the conductor who collected
his fare was also a stranger.</p>

<p>Thus Bob succeeded in getting away from Piketon without a living
person suspecting the fact.</p>

<p>Arriving in the metropolis he went to the Astor House, where
he registered under an assumed name. He had been in New York before,
and breathed somewhat freely, believing that the great city offered
better facilities for concealment from the authorities than can
be found in the fastnesses of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>Conscience makes cowards of us all, and Bob could never feel
perfectly secure. He feared every stranger whom he encountered
on the streets and who looked sharply at him was an officer that
suspected his identity and was meditating his arrest.</p>

<p>Even when he read in the papers the account of the disaster at
Piketon, and saw the name of Wagstaff and himself as the two worthy
young men that were drowned, he failed to obtain the consolation
that might have been expected. He was known to a good many in
New York, and feared he could not keep his secret much longer.</p>

<p>In this distressful state he dispatched a messenger boy to the
home of Jim McGovern, with the request that he would come to a
certain room at the Astor House to meet a person on important
business. Bob did not send a note or give his name, so that when
the wondering Jim presented himself at the famous hostelry, it
was without the remotest suspicion of whom he was to meet.</p>

<p>Possibly the amazement of McGovern may be imagined when he stood
in the presence of the former captain of the Piketon Rangers and
listened to his story.</p>

<p>"I have a great mind to sail for Europe," he said, after making
the facts known.</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"Because I’ll never be safe as long as I’m on this side of the
Atlantic; my attack on Dick Halliard will send me to prison for
twenty years."</p>

<p>The frightened Bob now gave Jim a truthful account of his stopping
young Halliard on the highway and shooting at him.</p>

<p>"Have you told your uncle and aunt that you are here?" asked
McGovern, without referring to the incident, which, of course,
he heard for the first time.</p>

<p>"Gracious, no!" replied the startled Bob; "I wouldn’t do it for
the world."</p>

<p>"Don’t you think you can trust them?"</p>

<p>"I know they would do anything for me, but it is too risky; they
would be sure to drop some hint that would let the cat out of
the bag."</p>

<p>"You needn’t be afraid of that; haven’t you reflected, Bob, how
distressed they are over your supposed death?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is so, but I don’t know how it can be helped; you
see how I am fixed."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, and before I can agree to stand by you I must
insist that you write a letter to your uncle, Captain Jim, and
let him know that the thousand dollars he has offered for the
recovery of your body is safe. You can ask that until he hears
from you again he and Aunt Ruth shall let no one one suspect you
are alive. You know he believes in you, and you have only to say
that you have important reasons for the request, and they will
be sure to respect it."</p>

<p>"I wish I could feel as certain about that as you do," said Bob,
who was made uncomfortable by the words of his friend.</p>

<p>"I am certain, and I can’t feel much sympathy for you as long
as you show yourself indifferent to the feelings of your best
friends."</p>

<p>"That’s queer talk for you, Jim; you didn’t think much about
the feelings of your folks when you and Tom run away from home."</p>

<p>"I trust I am a different person from what I was then," said
Jim, his face flushing.</p>

<p>Bob looked at him curiously, but did not speak the thought which
came into his mind at that moment.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, with a sigh, "if you insist so strongly, why,
I’ll do it."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"In the course of a day or two."</p>

<p>"I want you to do it <em>now</em>, while I am in this room."</p>

<p>"But where’s the hurry, Jim?" asked Bob, impatiently; "I don’t
see why things need be rushed in the style you want."</p>

<p>"Do it to oblige me, Bob, and then I have something to say to
you which is of importance and which will please you."</p>

<p>"Let me hear it now," said Bob, brightening up with expectancy.</p>

<p>"You sha’n’t hear a word till after the letter is written."</p>

<p>The task was distasteful to young Budd, and he held off for awhile
longer, but Jim would not let up. He was determined that the letter
should be written in his presence and before he went away.</p>

<p>Seeing there was no escape, Bob turned to the stand containing
writing material, and addressed a brief note to his uncle, giving
him the important information that he had not suffered the slightest
inconvenience from the flood that drowned one of his companions
and came mighty near carrying off the other.</p>

<p>The main portion of the letter was taken up with an emphatic
request of his uncle and aunt not to give the slightest hint of
what they had learned until they heard further from him.</p>

<p>This letter was sealed and directed.</p>

<p>"Let me have it," said Jim.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"I will drop it in the letter box as I go out."</p>

<p>"Well, you beat the bugs," laughed Bob, passing the missive over
to him; "now, what have you to tell me?"</p>

<p>It may be added that Bob Budd’s letter promptly reached the astounded
Captain, who found it hard to keep the joyful news to himself,
but he managed to do so, as did his wife, who went into hysterics
when the news was first broken to her.</p>

<p>But, as a means of averting suspicion, the Captain immediately
doubled the reward offered for the recovery of the body of his
nephew. He smiled grimly as he did so, and looked upon the matter
as a capital joke; but then some people do entertain peculiar
ideas as to what constitutes a joke.</p>
