<p>IN <em>THE </em>mean time, the situation of our friends in Wolf
Ravine was becoming perilous to the last degree.</p>

<p>Before going to work, on the morning of the steam man's excursion
to the mountains, Baldy Bicknell made a reconnoissance of the
ravine, to assure himself that there was no danger of being suddenly
overwhelmed, while delving for the precious yellow sand.</p>

<p>He saw abundant signs of Indians having recently visited the
place, but he concluded there were none in the immediate vicinity,
and that comparatively little risk was run in the boy making his
wished-for visit to the mountains in the west.</p>

<p>Through the center of the ravine ran a small stream of water,
hardly of enough volume to be used for washing gold without a
dam being created. It looked as if this had once been the head
of a large stream, and that the golden sand had been drifted to
this spot, by the force of the powerful current.</p>

<p>The auriferous particles were scattered over the entire breadth
of the ravine, for the distance of several hundred feet, being
found in the richest deposits between the ledges and rocks, in
the bottom of the channel, where, as may well be supposed, it
was no easy matter to obtain.</p>

<p>A short distance back of the 'diggings,' where the vast masses
of rocks assumed curiously grotesque forms, the miners discovered
a rude cave, where they at once established their headquarters.
A tiny stream ran through the bottom of it, and with a little
placing of the close bowlders, they speedily put it in the best
condition of defense.</p>

<p>It was almost entirely surrounded by trees, there was one spot
where a thin man, like Hopkins or Baldy, could draw his body through
and climb a luxuriant cottonwood, whose top have a wide view of
the surrounding plain.</p>

<p>The day passed away without any signs of Indians, Baldy occasionally
ascending the side of the ravine, and scanning the plains in every
direction, on the constant lookout for the insidious approach
of their enemies.</p>

<p>Just before nightfall, while all three were at work, a rifle
was discharged, and the bullet was imbedded in the tough oaken
handle of the spade with which the trapper was digging.</p>

<p>'Whar in thunder did that come from?' he demanded, dropping the
implement, catching up the rifle, and glaring savagely about him.</p>

<p>But neither of the others could answer him, and climbing up the
bank, he looked fiercely around for some evidence of the whereabouts
of his treacherous foe.</p>

<p>The latter remained invisible, but several hundred yards down
the ravine, he caught a glimpse of enough Indians dodging hither
and thither to satisfy him that there was quite a formidable force
in the valley.</p>

<p>Giving the alarm to his companions, all three withdrew within
the cave, not the less willingly, as it was very near their usual
quitting time.</p>

<p>'Begorrah! and what'll becoom of the shtame mian and the boy?'
inquired Mickey, as he hastily obeyed orders.</p>

<p>'Jerusalem!' exclaimed the Yankee, in great trepidation, 'if
he isn't warned, they'll catch him sure, and then what'll become
of us? We'll have to walk all the way hum.'</p>

<p>As the best means of communicating with him, the trapper climbed
through the narrow opening, and to the top of the tree, where
he ensconced himself, just as the steam man uttered its interrogative
whistle.</p>

<p>The trapper, as we have shown in another place, replied by pantomime,
not wishing to discover his whereabouts to the enemy, as he had
a dim idea that this means of egress might possibly prove of some
use to him, in the danger that was closing around them.</p>

<p>When Johnny Brainerd recognized his signal, and beat a retreat,
Baldy began a cautious descent to his cave again. At this time
it was already growing dark, and he had to feel his way down again.</p>

<p>And so it came about, that not until he had reached the lowest
limb, did his trained ear detest a slight rustling on the ground
beneath. Supposing it to be either Mickey or Ethan, he continued
his descent, merely glancing below. But at that moment something
suspicious caught his eye, and peering down more carefully, he
discovered a crouching Indian, waiting with drawn knife until
he should come within his reach.</p>

<p>The trapper was no coward, and had been in many a hand to-hand
tussle before; but there was something in the character of the
danger which would have made it more pleasant for him to hesitate
awhile until he could learn its precise dimensions; but time was
too precious, and the next moment, he had dropped directly by
the side of the red-skin.</p>

<p>The latter intended to make the attack, but without waiting for
him, Baldy sprung like a panther upon him and bore him to the
earth. There was a silent but terrific struggle for a few moments,
but the prodigious activity and rower of the trapper prevailed,
and when he withdrew from the grasp of the Indian, the latter
was as dead as a door nail. The struggle had been so short that
neither Mickey nor Ethan knew anything of it, until Baldy dropped
down among them, and announced what had taken place.</p>

<p>'Jerusalem! have they come as close as that?' asked the Yankee
in considerable terror.</p>

<p>'Skulp me, if they ain't all around us!' was the reply of the
hunter.</p>

<p>'How we ar' to git out o' hyar, ar' a hard thing to tell j'ist
now.'</p>

<p>'It's meself that thinks the rid gentlemin have a love fur us,
as me mither obsarved, when she cracked the head of me father,'
remarked Mickey, who had seated himself upon the ground with all
the indifference of an unconcerned spectator.</p>

<p>It was so dark in their cave-like home that they could not see
each other's faces, and could only catch a sort of twilight glimpse
of their forms when they passed close to each other.</p>

<p>It would have made their quarters more pleasant had they struck
a light, but it was too dangerous a proceeding, and no one thought
of it. They could only keep on the alert, and watch for the movement
of their enemies.</p>

<p>The latter, beyond all doubt, were in the immediate vicinity,
and inspired as they were by hate of the most vindictive kind,
would not allow an opportunity to pass of doing all the harm in
their power.</p>

<p>The remains of their food was silently eaten in the darkness,
when Baldy said:</p>

<p>'Do yer stay hyar whar ye be till I come back'</p>

<p>'Where might ye be going naow?' inquired Hopkins.</p>

<p>'I'm goin' outside to see what the reds are doin', and to see
whether thar's a chance fur 'em to gobble us up hull.'</p>

<p>'Do yees mind and take care of y'urself, as me mither cautioned
me when I went a shparkin',' said Mickey, who naturally felt some
apprehension, when he saw the trapper on the point of leaving
them at such a dangerous time.</p>

<p>'Yes. Baldy, remember that my fate is wrapped up in yours,' added
the Yankee, whose sympathies were probably excited to a still
greater extent.</p>

<p>'Never mind about Baldy; he has been in such business too often
not to know how to take care of himself.'</p>

<p>'How long do you expect to begone?'' inquired Ethan.</p>

<p>'Mebbe all night, if thar ain't much danger. Ef I find the varments
ar' too thick I'll stay by yer, and if they ain't I'll leave fur
several hours. Leastways, whatever I do, you'll be sure to look
out for the skunks.'</p>

<p>With this parting admonition, the trapper withdrew.</p>

<p>In going out, he made his exit by the same entrance by which
all had come in. He proceeded with great caution, for none knew
better than he the danger of a single misstep. He succeeded, after
considerable time, in reaching a portion of the valley so shrouded
in gloom that he was able to advance without fear of discovery.</p>

<p>He thoroughly reconnoitered every part of the ravine in the immediate
vicinity of the cave, but could discover nothing of the Indians,
and he concluded that they were some distance away.</p>

<p>Having assured himself of this, the trapper cautiously ascended
the side of the ravine, until he reached the open prairie, when
he lost no time in leaving the dangerous place behind him.</p>

<p>He had no intention, however, of deserting his friends, but had
simply gone in quest of the steam man. He comprehended the difficulty
under which they all labored, so long as they were annoyed in
this manner by the constant attacks of the savages, and he had
an idea that the invention of the dwarfed Johnny Brainerd could
be turned to a good account in driving the miscreants away so
thoroughly that they would remain away for a long enough time
for them to accomplish something in the way of gathering the wealth
lying all about them.</p>

<p>He recalled the direction which he had seen the puffing giant
take, and he bent his steps accordingly, with only a faint hope
of meeting him without searching the entire night for him. Baldy
was shrewd enough to reason that as the boy would wish some water
for his engine, he would remain in the immediate vicinity of the
river until at least that want could be supplied.</p>

<p>Acting on this supposition, he made his way to the river bank,
and followed so closely to the water that its moonlit surface
was constantly visible to him.</p>

<p>The night was still, and, as he moved silently along, he often
paused and listened, hoping to hear the familiar rattle of the
wheels, as the youngster sped over the prairie.</p>

<p>Without either party knowing it, he passed within a few yards
of Duff McIntosh, the huge trapper, whom he had known so intimately
years before.</p>

<p>But had he been aware of the fact, he would only have turned
further aside, to avoid him; for, when the two trappers, several
years previous, separated, they had been engaged in a deadly quarrel,
which came near resulting fatally to both.</p>

<p>At length the faint rattle of the wheels caught his ear, and
he bent his steps toward the point where he judged the steam man
to be. </p>
