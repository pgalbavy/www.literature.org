<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Captain Bergen was so affected by the joyful awakening to the
fact that his long, dismal sojourn on the lonely island in the
Pacific had reached the end at last, and by the belief that now
he would be carried as rapidly as wind and sail could take him
to his beloved New England again, that his mind was unsettled
and he behaved in a way that pained, as much as it astonished,
his companion.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as such was the fact, Mr. Storms hoped that it would
be accepted as an explanation of the strange utterances in which
he had indulged, for he believed that the cupidity of the young
man had already been excited, and a most unfortunate complication
threatened.</p>

<p>"You will excuse the excitement of my friend," said he to Sanders,
"though mine is nearly as great; but he had almost settled into
the belief that we were doomed to perish in this desolate spot,
and the reaction caused by your joyous tidings is too much for
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right!" was the cheery response. "I understand
how that is. But, begging pardon, I believe you have another companion?"</p>

<p>Fred looked so earnestly at the figure of Inez Hawthorne, standing
a short distance off, that his meaning could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>"It is I who should beg your pardon," said Storms, in turn, beckoning
to Inez to approach; "but we were so much interested in you that
we forgot her for the time."</p>

<p>While the girl was approaching the group, Captain Bergen turned
about, and without a word, walked slowly away in the direction
of the cabin, his manner showing still more clearly than ever
that his mind was unbalanced&mdash;a fact which caused Storms great
discomfort. Aside from his love for the good, honest man, he saw
that he had already imperiled, and was likely still further to
imperil, their great possessions by his rambling, and yet significant,
talk.</p>

<p>The pearls still lay some distance away, buried in the sand in
their canvas bags, and must be procured before leaving the island.</p>

<p>Since the captain had already awakened suspicion respecting the
truth, the difficulty of getting the prizes away without detection
was immeasurably increased, while the likelihood of his making
still further disclosures remained.</p>

<p>Storms was fearful that this sudden movement on the part of Bergen
meant something of the kind, but the situation was such that he
could not interfere, and all he could do during the few minutes
remaining of the trying interview, was to keep a furtive watch,
so far as possible, upon the movements of the captain.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sanders," said the mate, "this is Inez Hawthorne&mdash;a little
girl who became a companion of ours through no fault of hers or
of either of us. She has been here during the three years we have
spent on the island, and though she has stood it so much better
than we, she is fully as anxious to get away. Inez, this is Mr.
Fred Sanders, who has come to take us off."</p>

<p>The handsome young fellow doffed his hat and bowed with a certain
grace and deferential regard in his manner, which led Storms,
who was narrowly watching him, to suspect that he was of high
birth and had moved in good circles before he had made his d√©but
in this strange part of the world. Inez possessed the same charming
simplicity which had distinguished her in her earlier years, though
she was more reserved, as was natural with her. She extended her
hand to Sanders, who gave it a gentle pressure, while he said:</p>

<p>"When I saw the signal fluttering up there I suspected there
were persons here who wanted help, but I never dreamed that we
should find you."</p>

<p>"And why not me as well as any one else?" asked Inez, with a
smile. "Is there any reason why I shouldn't have misfortune the
same as other persons? If there is any such rule, I have never
heard of it."</p>

<p>"I know of none; but shipwreck, as a general thing&mdash;and certainly
in the case of your companions&mdash;has been a great injury to them.
They look emaciated and ill, and the captain is surely injured
in the mind. But you&mdash;why&mdash;well, never mind."</p>

<p>Fred laughed and broke down, for he really meant to say nothing
that could be construed into flattery or impertinence. There was
an air of goodness and refinement about the girl which compelled
the respect, for the time at least, of the wild youth.</p>

<p>"I am so glad you have come," said Inez, without commenting upon
his last words; "for though I have been as cheerful as I could,
it has been mainly on account of the captain and Mr. Storms. I
saw how dejected they were, and tried to cheer them as best I
could."</p>

<p>"Which was very kind in you. But, thank heaven! it is all over
now, and I hope we shall soon bear you away from this place, that
no doubt has become so detestable in your eyes that you never
want to see it again."</p>

<p>"I cannot say how dreadful it is and how much I dislike it. The
ship which ought to have taken us away as it brought us, was broken
to pieces on the beach, and the mutineers, who thirsted for our
lives, were drowned when almost in reach, as may be said, of the
shore."</p>

<p>Here was some more unexpected information that greatly interested
Fred Sanders, who began to think he would get at all the facts
by interviewing each member of the little company.</p>

<p>Mr. Storms heard the remark of Inez; but, while he regretted
it&mdash;on the ground that it might raise some more uncomfortable
suspicions&mdash;he did not care particularly, for the sad story was
one that could easily be told, and upon which he was ready for
cross-examination. But what more interested him at that moment
was the fact that Captain Bergen just then reached the cabin,
and, instead of stopping within, passed on beyond.</p>

<p>The conclusion of Storms was natural that he had gone to the
upper part of the island to dig up the pearls; in which case,
in his peculiar mental condition, he would, most likely, lose
them all. This would never do, and the mate excused himself, saying:</p>

<p>"I am a little uneasy respecting the captain, and I will leave
you two here while I look after him."</p>

<p>Fred Sanders saluted him, and told the truth when he said he
would forgive his departure with pleasure; with which the ragged
mate went hurrying after the ragged captain.</p>

<p>"Won't you step on board the proa for a little while?" asked
Fred, who was rather tired of standing on the sand under the palm-trees.
"As it is to be your dwelling-place for a few days, you may like
to select your apartments."</p>

<p>Inez said she would be glad to do so, and Fred uttered some sharp
exclamation, which caused both of the dusky natives to spring
to their feet and hasten to the side of the proa nearest the shore,
where they waited the chance to help her aboard. Inez noticed
that the islanders were muscular, athletic fellows, with such
a peculiar appearance that she could not avoid staring at them
for a few seconds. Each was fully six feet in height&mdash;an unusual
stature among the South Sea Islanders&mdash;and their breasts, arms
and legs were tattooed with all sorts of figures and representations.
Since these portions of their anatomy were uncovered, the singular
ornamentation was very prominent.</p>

<p>They had the curious tattooing on their cheeks, noses and foreheads,
so that their appearance was repellent. Besides this, their teeth
were black, their noses large and flat, and their mouths wider
than there was any necessity for. Their heads were bare, and,
indeed, were furnished by nature with all the covering they could
need. The hair was very long, but frizzly, so that as it curled
up about their ears and crowns, it formed an immense bushy screen,
which gave their heads prodigious size. Their hands and feet were
very large, and it would have been hard, in short, to discover
anything in their looks that could attract a person toward them.
Surveying them dispassionately, one could not help suspecting
they belonged to a tribe of cannibals.</p>

<p>However, Inez did not show any repulsion which she might have
felt, but stepping close to the proa took the extended hand, and
sprang lightly aboard of the strange craft. The natives immediately
withdrew, leaving the young captain, as he appeared to be, to
conduct the fair visitor around the "ship," whose dimensions did
not require much time to investigate.</p>

<p>Fred explained that the proa was a vessel peculiar to the Indian
and Central Pacific oceans, and that it could sail with great
swiftness, going either forward or backward with equal readiness.
It is a favorite boat used for inter-communication between hundreds
of the islands of the South Seas, and the Malays employ them in
a different form for their piratical expeditions. They owe their
swiftness mainly to the fact that they stand so high out of the
water, are very narrow, and present such a large surface to the
wind.</p>

<p>"They are good for short voyages," said Fred, "but I shouldn't
want to start for New York or Liverpool in one of them."</p>

<p>"How long will it take us to reach the island from which you
came?" asked Inez.</p>

<p>"If we start early to-morrow morning, with a good wind, we ought
to be there at the end of two days."</p>

<p>This was shorter time than he had given Mate Storms, but he was
now striving to speak the truth.</p>

<p>"And suppose we are overtaken by one of those terrible tempests
which sometimes visit this part of the world?"</p>

<p>"We cannot escape the risk, no matter where we are. The storm
that would sink a proa might cause a seventy-four to founder,
and the only way you can shun danger is to stay here all your
life. I hardly think that such is your wish, Miss Inez."</p>

<p>"No; I am as anxious to leave as are Mr. Storms and the captain.
Indeed, I think I am more so, for I understand that they expect
to wait until to-morrow morning, while if I had my wish I would
start this very hour."</p>

<p>"We are at the disposal of yourself and friends," Sanders courteously
responded; "but the reason for delay is that thereby we expect
to be compelled to spend but a single night on the voyage, while
if we started now we should have two."</p>
