<P>
Persons possessed of sluggish livers and tender hearts find two
serious drawbacks to the enjoyment of a cruise at sea. It is
exceedingly difficult to get enough walking exercise; and it is
next to impossible (where secrecy is an object) to make love
without being found out. Reverting for the moment to the latter
difficulty only, life within the narrow and populous limits of a
vessel may be defined as essentially life in public. From morning
to night you are in your neighbor's way, or your neighbor is in
your way. As a necessary result of these conditions, the rarest
of existing men may be defined as the man who is capable of
stealing a kiss at sea without discovery. An inbred capacity for
stratagem of the finest sort; inexhaustible inventive resources;
patience which can flourish under superhuman trials; presence of
mind which can keep its balance victoriously under every possible
stress of emergency--these are some of the qualifications which
must accompany Love on a cruise, when Love embarks in the
character of a contraband commodity not duly entered on the
papers of the ship.
<P>
Having established a Code of Signals which enabled them to
communicate privately, while the eyes and ears of others were
wide open on every side of them, Natalie and Launce were next
confronted by the more serious difficulty of finding a means of
meeting together at stolen interviews on board the yacht.
Possessing none of those precious moral qualifications already
enumerated as the qualifications of an accomplished lover at sea,
Launce had proved unequal to grapple with the obstacles in his
way. Left to her own inventive resources, Natalie had first
suggested the young surgeon's medical studies as Launce's
unanswerable excuse for shutting himself up at intervals in the
lower regions, and had then hit on the happy idea of tearing her
trimmings, and condemning herself to repair her own carelessness,
as the all-sufficient reason for similar acts of self-seclusion
on her side. In this way the lovers contrived, while the innocent
ruling authorities were on deck, to meet privately below them, on
the neutral ground of the main cabin; and there, by previous
arrangement at the breakfast-table, they were about to meet
privately now.
<P>
Natalie's door was, as usual on these occasions, the first that
opened; for this sound reason, that Natalie's quickness was the
quickness to be depended on in case of accident.
<P>
She looked up at the sky-light. There were the legs of the two
gentlemen and the skirts of her aunt visible (and stationary) on
the lee side of the deck. She advanced a few steps and listened.
There was a pause in the murmur of the voices above. She looked
up again. One pair of legs (not her father's) had disappeared.
Without an instant's hesitation, Natalie darted back to her own
door, just in time to escape Richard Turlington descending the
cabin stairs. All he did was to go to one of the drawers under
the main-cabin book-case and to take out a map, ascending again
immediately to the deck. Natalie's guilty conscience rushed
instantly, nevertheless, to the conclusion that Richard suspected
her. When she showed herself for the second time, instead of
venturing into the cabin, she called across it in a whisper,
<P>
"Launce!"
<P>
Launce appeared at his door. He was peremptorily checked before
he could cross the threshold.
<P>
"Don't stir a step! Richard has been down in the cabin! Richard
suspects us!"
<P>
"Nonsense! Come out."
<P>
"Nothing will induce me, unless you can find some other place
than the cabin."
<P>
Some other place? How easy to find it on land! How apparently
impossible at sea! There was the forecastle (full of men) at one
end of the vessel. There was the sail room (full of sails) at the
other. There was the ladies' cabin (used as the ladies'
dressing-room; inaccessible, in that capacity, to every male
human being on board). Was there any disposable inclosed space to
be found amidships? On one side there were the sleeping berths of
the sailing-master and his mate (impossible to borrow _them_). On
the other side was the steward's store-room. Launce considered
for a moment. The steward's store-room was just the thing!
<P>
"Where are you going?" asked Natalie, as her lover made straight
for a closed door at the lower extremity of the main cabin.
<P>
"To speak to the steward, darling. Wait one moment, and you will
see me again."
<P>
Launce opened the store-room door, and discovered, not the
steward, but his wife, who occupied the situation of stewardess
on board the vessel. The accident was, in this case, a lucky one.
Having stolen several kisses at sea, and having b een discovered
(in every case) either by the steward or his wife, Launce felt no
difficulty in prefacing his request to be allowed the use of the
room by the plainest allusion to his relations with Natalie. He
could count on the silence of the sympathizing authorities in
this region of the vessel, having wisely secured them as
accomplices by the usual persuasion of the pecuniary sort. Of the
two, however, the stewardess, as a woman, was the more likely to
lend a ready ear to Launce's entreaties in his present emergency.
After a faint show of resistance, she consented, not only to
leave the room, but to keep her husband out of it, on the
understanding that it was not to be occupied for more than ten
minutes. Launce made the signal to Natalie at one door, while the
stewardess went out by the other. In a moment more the lovers
were united in a private room. Is it necessary to say in what
language the proceedings were opened? Surely not! There is an
inarticulate language of the lips in use on these occasions in
which we are all proficient, though we sometimes forget it in
later life. Natalie seated herself on a locker. The tea, sugar,
and spices were at her back, a side of bacon swung over her head,
and a net full of lemons dangled before her face. It might not be
roomy, but it was snug and comfortable.
<P>
"Suppose they call for the steward?" she suggested. ("Don't,
Launce!")
<P>
"Never mind. We shall be safe enough if they do. The steward has
only to show himself on deck, and they will suspect nothing."
<P>
"Do be quiet, Launce! I have got dreadful news to tell you. And,
besides, my aunt will expect to see me with my braid sewn on
again."
<P>
She had brought her needle and thread with her. Whipping up the
skirt of her dress on her knee, she bent forward over it, and set
herself industriously to the repair of the torn trimming. In this
position her lithe figure showed charmingly its firm yet easy
line. The needle, in her dexterous brown fingers, flew through
its work. The locker was a broad one; Launce was able to seat
himself partially behind her. In this position who could have
resisted the temptation to lift up her great knot of
broadly-plaited black hair, and to let the warm, dusky nape of
her neck disclose itself to view? Who, looking at it, could fail
to revile the senseless modern fashion of dressing the hair,
which hides the double beauty of form and color that nestles at
the back of a woman's neck? From time to time, as the interview
proceeded, Launce's lips emphasized the more important words
occurring in his share of the conversation on the soft, fragrant
skin which the lifted hair let him see at intervals. In Launce's
place, sir, you would have done it too.
<P>
"Now, Natalie, what is the news?"
<P>
"He has spoken to papa, Launce."
<P>
"Richard Turlington?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"D--n him!"
<P>
Natalie started. A curse addressed to the back of your neck,
instantly followed by a blessing in the shape of a kiss, is a
little trying when you are not prepared for it.
<P>
"Don't do that again, Launce! It was while you were on deck
smoking, and when I was supposed to be fast asleep. I opened the
ventilator in my cabin door, dear, and I heard every word they
said. He waited till my aunt was out of the way, and he had got
papa all to himself, and then he began it in that horrible,
downright voice of his--'Graybrooke! how much longer am I to
wait?'"
<P>
"Did he say that?"
<P>
"No more swearing, Launce! Those were the words. Papa didn't
understand them. He only said (poor dear!)--'Bless my soul,
Richard, what do you want?' Richard soon explained himself. 'Who
could he be waiting for--but Me?' Papa said something about my
being so young. Richard stopped his mouth directly. 'Girls were
like fruit; some ripened soon, and some ripened late. Some were
women at twenty, and some were women at sixteen. It was
impossible to look at me, and not see that I was like a new being
after my two months at sea,' and so on and so on. Papa behaved
like an angel. He still tried to put it off. 'Plenty of time,
Richard, plenty of time.' 'Plenty of time for _her_' (was the
wretch's answer to that); 'but not for _me_. Think of all I have
to offer her' (as if I cared for his money!); 'think how long I
have looked upon her as growing up to be my wife' (growing up for
_him_--monstrous!), 'and don't keep me in a state of uncertainty,
which it gets harder and harder for a man in my position to
endure!' He was really quite eloquent. His voice trembled. There
is no doubt, dear, that he is very, very fond of me."
<P>
"And you feel flattered by it, of course?"
<P>
"Don't talk nonsense. I feel a little frightened at it, I can
tell you."
<P>
"Frightened? Did _you_ notice him this morning?"
<P>
"I? When?"
<P>
"When your father was telling that story about the man
overboard."
<P>
"No. What did he do? Tell me, Launce."
<P>
"I'll tell you directly. How did it all end last night? Did your
father make any sort of promise?"
<P>
"You know Richard's way; Richard left him no other choice. Papa
had to promise before he was allowed to go to bed."
<P>
"To let Turlington marry you?"
<P>
"Yes; the week after my next birthday."
<P>
"The week after next Christmas-day?"
<P>
"Yes. Papa is to speak to me as soon as we are at home again, and
my married life is to begin with the New Year."
<P>
"Are you in earnest, Natalie? Do you really mean to say it has
gone as far as that?"
<P>
"They have settled everything. The splendid establishment we are
to set up, the great income we are to have. I heard papa tell
Richard that half his fortune should go to me on my wedding-day.
It was sickening to hear how much they made of Money, and how
little they thought of Love. What am I to do, Launce?"
<P>
"That's easily answered, my darling. In the first place, you are
to make up your mind not to marry Richard Turlington--"
<P>
"Do talk reasonably. You know I have done all I could. I have
told papa that I can think of Richard as a friend, but not as a
husband. He only laughs at me, and says, 'Wait a little, and you
will alter your opinion, my dear.' You see Richard is everything
to him; Richard has always managed his affairs, and has saved him
from losing by bad speculations; Richard has known me from the
time when I was a child; Richard has a splendid business, and
quantities of money. Papa can't even imagine that I can resist
Richard. I have tried my aunt; I have told her he is too old for
me. All she says is, 'Look at your father; he was much older than
your mother, and what a happy marriage theirs was.' Even if I
said in so many words, 'I won't marry Richard,' what good would
it do to us? Papa is the best and dearest old man in the world;
but oh, he is so fond of money! He believes in nothing else. He
would be furious--yes, kind as he is, he would be furious--if I
even hinted that I was fond of _you_. Any man who proposed to
marry me--if he couldn't match the fortune that I should bring
him by a fortune of his own--would be a lunatic in papa's eyes.
He wouldn't think it necessary to answer him; he would ring the
bell, and have him shown out of the house. I am exaggerating
nothing, Launce; you know I am speaking the truth. There is no
hope in the future--that I can see--for either of us.
<P>
"Have you done, Natalie? I have something to say on my side if
you have."
<P>
"What is it?"
<P>
"If things go on as they are going on now, shall I tell you how
it will end? It will end in your being Turlington's wife."
<P>
"Never!"
<P>
"So you say now; but you don't know what may happen between this
and Christmas-day. Natalie, there is only one way of making sure
that you will never marry Richard. Marry _me_."
<P>
"Without papa's consent?"
<P>
"Without saying a word to anybody till it's done."
<P>
"Oh, Launce! Launce!"
<P>
"My darling, every word you have said proves there is no other
way. Think of it, Natalie, think of it."
<P>
There was a pause. Natalie dropped her needle and thread, and hid
her face in her hands. "If my poor mother was only alive," she
said; "if I only had an elder sister to advise me, and to take my
part."
<P>
She was evidently hesitating. Launce took a man's advantage of
her indecision. He pressed her without mercy.
<P>
"Do you love me?" he whispered, with his lips close to her ear.
<P>
"You know I do, dearly."
<P>
"Put it out of Richa rd's power to part us, Natalie."
<P>
"Part us? We are cousins: we have known each other since we were
both children. Even if he proposed parting us, papa wouldn't
allow it."
<P>
"Mark my words, he _will_ propose it. As for your father, Richard
has only to lift his finger and your father obeys him. My love,
the happiness of both our lives is at stake. "He wound his arm
round her, and gently drew her head back on his bosom " Other
girls have done it, darling," he pleaded, "why shouldn't you?"
<P>
The effort to answer him was too much for her. She gave it up. A
low sigh fluttered through her lips. She nestled closer to him,
and faintly closed her eyes. The next instant she started up,
trembling from head to foot, and looked at the sky-light. Richard
Turlington's voice was suddenly audible on deck exactly above
them.
<P>
"Graybrooke, I want to say a word to you about Launcelot Linzie."
<P>
Natalie's first impulse was to fly to the door. Hearing Launce's
name on Richard's lips, she checked herself. Something in
Richard's tone roused in her the curiosity which suspends fear.
She waited, with her hand in Launce's hand.
<P>
"If you remember," the brassy voice went on, "I doubted the
wisdom of taking him with us on this cruise. You didn't agree
with me, and, at your express request, I gave way. I did wrong.
Launcelot Linzie is a very presuming young man."
<P>
Sir Joseph's answer was accompanied by Sir Joseph's mellow laugh.
<P>
"My dear Richard! Surely you are a little hard on Launce?"
<P>
"You are not an observant man, Graybrooke. I am. I see signs of
his presuming with all of us, and especially with Natalie. I
don't like the manner in which he speaks to her and looks at her.
He is unduly familiar; he is insolently confidential. There must
be a stop put to it. In my position, my feelings ought to be
regarded. I request you to check the intimacy when we get on
shore."
<P>
Sir Joseph's next words were spoken more seriously. He expressed
his surprise.
<P>
"My dear Richard, they are cousins, they have been playmates from
childhood. How _can_ you think of attaching the slightest
importance to anything that is said or done by poor Launce?"
<P>
There was a good-humored contempt in Sir Joseph's reference to
"poor Launce" which jarred on his daughter. He might almost have
been alluding to some harmless domestic animal. Natalie's color
deepened. Her hand pressed Launce's hand gently.
<P>
Turlington still persisted.
<P>
"I must once more request--seriously request--that you will check
this growing intimacy. I don't object to your asking him to the
house when you ask other friends. I only wish you (and expect
you) to stop his 'dropping in,' as it is called, any hour of the
day or evening when he may have nothing to do. Is that understood
between us?"
<P>
"If you make a point of it, Richard, of course it's understood
between us."
<P>
Launce looked at Natalie, as weak Sir Joseph consented in those
words.
<P>
"What did I tell you?" he whispered.
<P>
Natalie hung her head in silence. There was a pause in the
conversation on deck. The two gentlemen walked away slowly toward
the forward part of the vessel.
<P>
Launce pursued his advantage.
<P>
"Your father leaves us no alternative," he said. "The door will
be closed against me as soon as we get on shore. If I lose you,
Natalie, I don't care what becomes of me. My profession may go to
the devil. I have nothing left worth living for."
<P>
"Hush! hush! don't talk in that way!"
<P>
Launce tried the soothing influence of persuasion once more.
<P>
"Hundreds and hundreds of people in our situation have married
privately--and have been forgiven afterward," he went on. "I
won't ask you to do anything in a hurry. I will be guided
entirely by your wishes. All I want to quiet my mind is to know
that you are mine. Do, do, do make me feel sure that Richard
Turlington can't take you away from me."
<P>
"Don't press me, Launce." She dropped on the locker. "See!" she
said. "It makes me tremble only to think of it!"
<P>
"Who are you afraid of, darling? Not your father, surely?"
<P>
"Poor papa! I wonder whether he would be hard on me for the first
time in his life?" She stopped; her moistening eyes looked up
imploringly in Launce's face. "Don't press me!" she repeated
faintly. "You know it's wrong. We should have to confess it-- and
then what would happen?" She paused again. Her eyes wandered
nervously to the deck. Her voice dropped to its lowest tones.
"Think of Richard!" she said, and shuddered at the terrors which
that name conjured up. Before it was possible to say a quieting
word to her, she was again on her feet. Richard's name had
suddenly recalled to her memory Launce's mysterious allusion, at
the outset of the interview, to the owner of the yacht. "What was
that you said about Richard just now?" she asked. "You saw
something (or heard something) strange while papa was telling his
story. What was it?"
<P>
"I noticed Richard's face, Natalie, when your father told us that
the man overboard was not one of the pilot-boat's crew. He turned
ghastly pale. He looked guilty--"
<P>
"Guilty? Of what?"
<P>
"He was present--I am certain of it--when the sailor was thrown
into the sea. For all I know, he may have been the man who did
it."
<P>
Natalie started back in horror.
<P>
"Oh, Launce! Launce! that is too bad. You may not like Richard--
you may treat Richard as your enemy. But to say such a horrible
thing of him as that-- It's not generous. It's not like _you_."
<P>
"If you had seen him, you would have said it too. I mean to make
inquiries--in your father's interests as well as in ours. My
brother knows one of the Commissioners of Police, and my brother
can get it done for me. Turlington has not always been in the
Levant trade--I know that already."
<P>
"For shame, Launce! for shame!"
<P>
The footsteps on deck were audible coming back. Natalie sprang to
the door leading into the cabin. Launce stopped her, as she laid
her hand on the lock. The footsteps went straight on toward the
stern of the vessel. Launce clasped both arms round her. Natalie
gave way.
<P>
"Don't drive me to despair!" he said. "This is my last
opportunity. I don't ask you to say at once that you will marry
me, I only ask you to think of it. My darling! my angel! will you
think of it?"
<P>
As he put the question, they might have heard (if they had not
been too completely engrossed in each other to listen) the
footsteps returning--one pair of footsteps only this time.
Natalie's prolonged absence had begun to surprise her aunt, and
had roused a certain vague distrust in Richard's mind. He walked
back again along the deck by himself. He looked absently in the
main cabin as he passed it. The store-room skylight came next. In
his present frame of mind, would he look absently into the
store-room too?
<P>
"Let me go!" said Natalie.
<P>
Launce only answered, "Say yes," and held her as if he would
never let her go again.
<P>
At the same moment Miss Lavinia's voice rose shrill from the deck
calling for Natalie. There was but one way of getting free from
him. She said, "I'll think of it." Upon that, he kissed her and
let her go.
<P>
The door had barely closed on her when the lowering face of
Richard Turlington appeared on a level with the side of the sky-
light, looking down into the store-room at Launce.
<P>
"Halloo!" he called out roughly. "What are you doing in the
steward's room?"
<P>
Launce took up a box of matches on the dresser. "I'm getting a
light," he answered readily.
<P>
"I allow nobody below, forward of the main cabin, without my
leave. The steward has permitted a breach of discipline on board
my vessel. The steward will leave my service."
<P>
"The steward is not to blame."
<P>
"I am the judge of that. Not you."
<P>
Launce opened his lips to reply. An outbreak between the two men
appeared to be inevitable, when the sailing-master of the yacht
joined his employer on deck, and directed Turlington's attention
to a question which is never to be trifled with at sea, the
question of wind and tide.
<P>
The yacht was then in the Bristol Channel, at the entrance to
Bideford Bay. The breeze, fast freshening, was also fast changing
the direction from which it blew. The favorable tide had barely
three hours more to run.
<P>
"The wind's shifting, sir," said the sailing-master. "I'm afraid
we shan't get round the point this tide, unless we lay her off on
the other tack."
<P>
Turlington shook his head.
<P>
"There are letters waiting for me at Bideford," he said. "We have
lost two days in the calm. I must send ashore to the post-office,
whether we lose the tide or not."
<P>
The vessel held on her course. Off the port of Bideford, the boat
was sent ashore to the post-office, the yacht standing off and
on, waiting the appearance of the letters. In the shortest time
in which it was possible to bring them on board the letters were
in Turlington's hands.
<P>
The men were hauling the boat up to the davits, the yacht was
already heading off from the land, when Turlington startled
everybody by one peremptory word--"Stop!"
<P>
He had thrust all his letters but one into the pocket of his
sailing jacket, without reading them. The one letter which he had
opened he held in his closed hand. Rage was in his staring eyes,
consternation was on his pale lips.
<P>
"Lower the boat!" he shouted; "I must get to London to-night." He
stopped Sir Joseph, approaching him with opened mouth. "There's
no time for questions and answers. I must get back." He swung
himself over the side of the yacht, and addressed the
sailing-master from the boat. "Save the tide if you can; if you
can't, put them ashore to-morrow at Minehead or Watchet--wherever
they like." He beckoned to Sir Joseph to lean over the bulwark,
and hear something he had to say in private. "Remember what I
told you about Launcelot Linzie!" he whispered fiercely. His
parting look was for Natalie. He spoke to her with a strong
constraint on himself, as gently as he could. "Don't be alarmed;
I shall see you in London." He seated himself in the boat and
took the tiller. The last words they heard him say were words
urging the men at the oars to lose no time. He was invariably
brutal with the men. "Pull, you lazy beggars!" he exclaimed, with
an oath. "Pull for your lives!"
