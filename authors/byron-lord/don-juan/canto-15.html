Ah!<br/>
&mdash;What should follow slips from my reflection;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever follows ne'ertheless may be<br/>
As <em>à propos</em> of hope or retrospection,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As though the lurking thought had follow'd free.<br/>
All present life is but an interjection,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An 'Oh!' or 'Ah!' of joy or misery,<br/>
Or a 'Ha! ha!' or 'Bah!'&mdash;a yawn, or 'Pooh!'<br/>
Of which perhaps the latter is most true.

</p>
<p>
But, more or less, the whole 's a syncope<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a singultus&mdash;emblems of emotion,<br/>
The grand antithesis to great ennui,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherewith we break our bubbles on the ocean,&mdash;<br/>
That watery outline of eternity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or miniature at least, as is my notion,<br/>
Which ministers unto the soul's delight,<br/>
In seeing matters which are out of sight.

</p>
<p>
But all are better than the sigh supprest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Corroding in the cavern of the heart,<br/>
Making the countenance a masque of rest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And turning human nature to an art.<br/>
Few men dare show their thoughts of worst or best;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissimulation always sets apart<br/>
A corner for herself; and therefore fiction<br/>
Is that which passes with least contradiction.

</p>
<p>
Ah! who can tell? Or rather, who can not<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, without telling, passion's errors?<br/>
The drainer of oblivion, even the sot,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath got blue devils for his morning mirrors:<br/>
What though on Lethe's stream he seem to float,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He cannot sink his tremors or his terrors;<br/>
The ruby glass that shakes within his hand<br/>
Leaves a sad sediment of Time's worst sand.

</p>
<p>
And as for love&mdash;O love!<br/>
&mdash;We will proceed.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lady Adeline Amundeville,<br/>
A pretty name as one would wish to read,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Must perch harmonious on my tuneful quill.<br/>
There 's music in the sighing of a reed;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There 's music in the gushing of a rill;<br/>
There 's music in all things, if men had ears:<br/>
Their earth is but an echo of the spheres.

</p>
<p>
The Lady Adeline, right honourable;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And honour'd, ran a risk of growing less so;<br/>
For few of the soft sex are very stable<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In their resolves&mdash;alas! that I should say so!<br/>
They differ as wine differs from its label,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When once decanted;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;I presume to guess so,<br/>
But will not swear: yet both upon occasion,<br/>
Till old, may undergo adulteration.

</p>
<p>
But Adeline was of the purest vintage,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The unmingled essence of the grape; and yet<br/>
Bright as a new Napoleon from its mintage,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or glorious as a diamond richly set;<br/>
A page where Time should hesitate to print age,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And for which Nature might forego her debt&mdash;<br/>
Sole creditor whose process doth involve in 't<br/>
The luck of finding every body solvent.

</p>
<p>
O Death! thou dunnest of all duns! thou daily<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Knockest at doors, at first with modest tap,<br/>
Like a meek tradesman when, approaching palely,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some splendid debtor he would take by sap:<br/>
But oft denied, as patience 'gins to fail, he<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Advances with exasperated rap,<br/>
And (if let in) insists, in terms unhandsome,<br/>
On ready money, or 'a draft on Ransom.'

</p>
<p>
Whate'er thou takest, spare a while poor Beauty!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She is so rare, and thou hast so much prey.<br/>
What though she now and then may slip from duty,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The more 's the reason why you ought to stay.<br/>
Gaunt Gourmand! with whole nations for your booty,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You should be civil in a modest way:<br/>
Suppress, then, some slight feminine diseases,<br/>
And take as many heroes as Heaven pleases.

</p>
<p>
Fair Adeline, the more ingenuous<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where she was interested (as was said),<br/>
Because she was not apt, like some of us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To like too readily, or too high bred<br/>
To show it (points we need not now discuss)&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would give up artlessly both heart and head<br/>
Unto such feelings as seem'd innocent,<br/>
For objects worthy of the sentiment.

</p>
<p>
Some parts of Juan's history, which Rumour,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That live gazette, had scatter'd to disfigure,<br/>
She had heard; but women hear with more good humour<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such aberrations than we men of rigour:<br/>
Besides, his conduct, since in England, grew more<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Strict, and his mind assumed a manlier vigour;<br/>
Because he had, like Alcibiades,<br/>
The art of living in all climes with ease.

</p>
<p>
His manner was perhaps the more seductive,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he ne'er seem'd anxious to seduce;<br/>
Nothing affected, studied, or constructive<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of coxcombry or conquest: no abuse<br/>
Of his attractions marr'd the fair perspective,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To indicate a Cupidon broke loose,<br/>
And seem to say, 'Resist us if you can'-<br/>
Which makes a dandy while it spoils a man.

</p>
<p>
They are wrong&mdash;that 's not the way to set about it;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As, if they told the truth, could well be shown.<br/>
But, right or wrong, Don Juan was without it;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, his manner was his own alone;<br/>
Sincere he was&mdash;at least you could not doubt it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In listening merely to his voice's tone.<br/>
The devil hath not in all his quiver's choice<br/>
An arrow for the heart like a sweet voice.

</p>
<p>
By nature soft, his whole address held off<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspicion: though not timid, his regard<br/>
Was such as rather seem'd to keep aloof,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To shield himself than put you on your guard:<br/>
Perhaps 't was hardly quite assured enough,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But modesty 's at times its own reward,<br/>
Like virtue; and the absence of pretension<br/>
Will go much farther than there 's need to mention.

</p>
<p>
Serene, accomplish'd, cheerful but not loud;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Insinuating without insinuation;<br/>
Observant of the foibles of the crowd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet ne'er betraying this in conversation;<br/>
Proud with the proud, yet courteously proud,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So as to make them feel he knew his station<br/>
And theirs:&mdash;without a struggle for priority,<br/>
He neither brook'd nor claim'd superiority.

</p>
<p>
That is, with men: with women he was what<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They pleased to make or take him for; and their<br/>
Imagination 's quite enough for that:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So that the outline 's tolerably fair,<br/>
They fill the canvas up&mdash;and 'verbum sat.'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If once their phantasies be brought to bear<br/>
Upon an object, whether sad or playful,<br/>
They can transfigure brighter than a Raphael.

</p>
<p>
Adeline, no deep judge of character,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was apt to add a colouring from her own:<br/>
'T is thus the good will amiably err,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And eke the wise, as has been often shown.<br/>
Experience is the chief philosopher,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But saddest when his science is well known:<br/>
And persecuted sages teach the schools<br/>
Their folly in forgetting there are fools.

</p>
<p>
Was it not so, great Locke? and greater Bacon?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Socrates? And thou, Diviner still,<br/>
Whose lot it is by man to be mistaken,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thy pure creed made sanction of all ill?<br/>
Redeeming worlds to be by bigots shaken,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How was thy toil rewarded? We might fill<br/>
Volumes with similar sad illustrations,<br/>
But leave them to the conscience of the nations.

</p>
<p>
I perch upon an humbler promontory,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst life's infinite variety:<br/>
With no great care for what is nicknamed glory,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But speculating as I cast mine eye<br/>
On what may suit or may not suit my story,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And never straining hard to versify,<br/>
I rattle on exactly as I 'd talk<br/>
With any body in a ride or walk.

</p>
<p>
I don't know that there may be much ability<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shown in this sort of desultory rhyme;<br/>
But there 's a conversational facility,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which may round off an hour upon a time.<br/>
Of this I 'm sure at least, there 's no servility<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In mine irregularity of chime,<br/>
Which rings what 's uppermost of new or hoary,<br/>
Just as I feel the 'Improvvisatore.'

</p>
<p>
'Omnia vult belle Matho dicere&mdash;dic aliquando<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Et bene, dic neutrum, dic aliquando male.'<br/>
The first is rather more than mortal can do;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The second may be sadly done or gaily;<br/>
The third is still more difficult to stand to;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth we hear, and see, and say too, daily.<br/>
The whole together is what I could wish<br/>
To serve in this conundrum of a dish.

</p>
<p>
A modest hope&mdash;but modesty 's my forte,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And pride my feeble:&mdash;let us ramble on.<br/>
I meant to make this poem very short,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But now I can't tell where it may not run.<br/>
No doubt, if I had wish' to pay my court<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To critics, or to hail the setting sun<br/>
Of tyranny of all kinds, my concision<br/>
Were more;&mdash;but I was born for opposition.

</p>
<p>
But then 't is mostly on the weaker side;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So that I verily believe if they<br/>
Who now are basking in their full-blown pride<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were shaken down, and 'dogs had had their day,'<br/>
Though at the first I might perchance deride<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their tumble, I should turn the other way,<br/>
And wax an ultra-royalist in loyalty,<br/>
Because I hate even democratic royalty.

</p>
<p>
I think I should have made a decent spouse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I had never proved the soft condition;<br/>
I think I should have made monastic vows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But for my own peculiar superstition:<br/>
'Gainst rhyme I never should have knock'd my brows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor broken my own head, nor that of Priscian,<br/>
Nor worn the motley mantle of a poet,<br/>
If some one had not told me to forego it.

</p>
<p>
But 'laissez aller'&mdash;knights and dames I sing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as the times may furnish. 'T is a flight<br/>
Which seems at first to need no lofty wing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Plumed by Longinus or the Stagyrite:<br/>
The difficultly lies in colouring<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Keeping the due proportions still in sight)<br/>
With nature manners which are artificial,<br/>
And rend'ring general that which is especial.

</p>
<p>
The difference is, that in the days of old<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Men made the manners; manners now make men&mdash;<br/>
Pinn'd like a flock, and fleeced too in their fold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least nine, and a ninth beside of ten.<br/>
Now this at all events must render cold<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your writers, who must either draw again<br/>
Days better drawn before, or else assume<br/>
The present, with their common-place costume.

</p>
<p>
We 'll do our best to make the best on 't:<br/>
&mdash;March!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;March, my Muse! If you cannot fly, yet flutter;<br/>
And when you may not be sublime, be arch,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or starch, as are the edicts statesmen utter.<br/>
We surely may find something worth research:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Columbus found a new world in a cutter,<br/>
Or brigantine, or pink, of no great tonnage,<br/>
While yet America was in her non-age.

</p>
<p>
When Adeline, in all her growing sense<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Juan's merits and his situation,<br/>
Felt on the whole an interest intense,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Partly perhaps because a fresh sensation,<br/>
Or that he had an air of innocence,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is for innocence a sad temptation,&mdash;<br/>
As women hate half measures, on the whole,<br/>
She 'gan to ponder how to save his soul.

</p>
<p>
She had a good opinion of advice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all who give and eke receive it gratis,<br/>
For which small thanks are still the market price,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even where the article at highest rate is:<br/>
She thought upon the subject twice or thrice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And morally decided, the best state is<br/>
For morals, marriage; and this question carried,<br/>
She seriously advised him to get married.

</p>
<p>
Juan replied, with all becoming deference,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He had a predilection for that tie;<br/>
But that, at present, with immediate reference<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To his own circumstances, there might lie<br/>
Some difficulties, as in his own preference,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that of her to whom he might apply:<br/>
That still he 'd wed with such or such a lady,<br/>
If that they were not married all already.

</p>
<p>
Next to the making matches for herself,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And daughters, brothers, sisters, kith or kin,<br/>
Arranging them like books on the same shelf,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There 's nothing women love to dabble in<br/>
More (like a stock-holder in growing pelf)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than match-making in general: 't is no sin<br/>
Certes, but a preventative, and therefore<br/>
That is, no doubt, the only reason wherefore.

</p>
<p>
But never yet (except of course a miss<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unwed, or mistress never to be wed,<br/>
Or wed already, who object to this)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was there chaste dame who had not in her head<br/>
Some drama of the marriage unities,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Observed as strictly both at board and bed<br/>
As those of Aristotle, though sometimes<br/>
They turn out melodrames or pantomimes.

</p>
<p>
They generally have some only son,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some heir to a large property, some friend<br/>
Of an old family, some gay Sir john,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or grave Lord George, with whom perhaps might end<br/>
A line, and leave posterity undone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless a marriage was applied to mend<br/>
The prospect and their morals: and besides,<br/>
They have at hand a blooming glut of brides.

</p>
<p>
From these they will be careful to select,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For this an heiress, and for that a beauty;<br/>
For one a songstress who hath no defect,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For t' other one who promises much duty;<br/>
For this a lady no one can reject,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose sole accomplishments were quite a booty;<br/>
A second for her excellent connections;<br/>
A third, because there can be no objections.

</p>
<p>
When Rapp the Harmonist embargo'd marriage<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In his harmonious settlement (which flourishes<br/>
Strangely enough as yet without miscarriage,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it breeds no more mouths than it nourishes,<br/>
Without those sad expenses which disparage<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What Nature naturally most encourages)&mdash;<br/>
Why call'd he 'Harmony' a state sans wedlock?<br/>
Now here I 've got the preacher at a dead lock.

</p>
<p>
Because he either meant to sneer at harmony<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or marriage, by divorcing them thus oddly.<br/>
But whether reverend Rapp learn'd this in Germany<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or no, 't is said his sect is rich and godly,<br/>
Pious and pure, beyond what I can term any<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ours, although they propagate more broadly.<br/>
My objection 's to his title, not his ritual,<br/>
Although I wonder how it grew habitual.

</p>
<p>
But Rapp is the reverse of zealous matrons,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who favour, malgre Malthus, generation&mdash;<br/>
Professors of that genial art, and patrons<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the modest part of propagation;<br/>
Which after all at such a desperate rate runs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That half its produce tends to emigration,<br/>
That sad result of passions and potatoes&mdash;<br/>
Two weeds which pose our economic Catos.

</p>
<p>
Had Adeline read Malthus? I can't tell;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish she had: his book 's the eleventh commandment,<br/>
Which says, 'Thou shalt not marry,' unless well:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This he (as far as I can understand) meant.<br/>
'T is not my purpose on his views to dwell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor canvass what so 'eminent a hand' meant;<br/>
But certes it conducts to lives ascetic,<br/>
Or turning marriage into arithmetic.

</p>
<p>
But Adeline, who probably presumed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That Juan had enough of maintenance,<br/>
Or separate maintenance, in case 't was doom'd&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As on the whole it is an even chance<br/>
That bridegrooms, after they are fairly groom'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May retrograde a little in the dance<br/>
Of marriage (which might form a painter's fame,<br/>
Like Holbein's 'Dance of Death'&mdash;but 't is the same);&mdash;

</p>
<p>
But Adeline determined Juan's wedding<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In her own mind, and that 's enough for woman:<br/>
But then, with whom? There was the sage Miss Reading,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Raw, Miss Flaw, Miss Showman, and Miss Knowman.<br/>
And the two fair co-heiresses Giltbedding.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She deem'd his merits something more than common:<br/>
All these were unobjectionable matches,<br/>
And might go on, if well wound up, like watches.

</p>
<p>
There was Miss Millpond, smooth as summer's sea,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That usual paragon, an only daughter,<br/>
Who seem'd the cream of equanimity<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till skimm'd&mdash;and then there was some milk and water,<br/>
With a slight shade of blue too, it might be,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the surface; but what did it matter?<br/>
Love 's riotous, but marriage should have quiet,<br/>
And being consumptive, live on a milk diet.

</p>
<p>
And then there was the Miss Audacia Shoestring,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A dashing demoiselle of good estate,<br/>
Whose heart was fix'd upon a star or blue string;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But whether English dukes grew rare of late,<br/>
Or that she had not harp'd upon the true string,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By which such sirens can attract our great,<br/>
She took up with some foreign younger brother,<br/>
A Russ or Turk&mdash;the one 's as good as t' other.

</p>
<p>
And then there was&mdash;but why should I go on,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the ladies should go off?&mdash;there was<br/>
Indeed a certain fair and fairy one,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the best class, and better than her class,&mdash;<br/>
Aurora Raby, a young star who shone<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er life, too sweet an image for such glass,<br/>
A lovely being, scarcely form'd or moulded,<br/>
A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded;

</p>
<p>
Rich, noble, but an orphan; left an only<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Child to the care of guardians good and kind;<br/>
But still her aspect had an air so lonely!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood is not water; and where shall we find<br/>
Feelings of youth like those which overthrown lie<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By death, when we are left, alas! behind,<br/>
To feel, in friendless palaces, a home<br/>
Is wanting, and our best ties in the tomb?

</p>
<p>
Early in years, and yet more infantine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In figure, she had something of sublime<br/>
In eyes which sadly shone, as seraphs' shine.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All youth&mdash;but with an aspect beyond time;<br/>
Radiant and grave&mdash;as pitying man's decline;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mournful&mdash;but mournful of another's crime,<br/>
She look'd as if she sat by Eden's door.<br/>
And grieved for those who could return no more.

</p>
<p>
She was a Catholic, too, sincere, austere,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as her own gentle heart allow'd,<br/>
And deem'd that fallen worship far more dear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps because 't was fallen: her sires were proud<br/>
Of deeds and days when they had fill'd the ear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of nations, and had never bent or bow'd<br/>
To novel power; and as she was the last,<br/>
She held their old faith and old feelings fast.

</p>
<p>
She gazed upon a world she scarcely knew,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As seeking not to know it; silent, lone,<br/>
As grows a flower, thus quietly she grew,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And kept her heart serene within its zone.<br/>
There was awe in the homage which she drew;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her spirit seem'd as seated on a throne<br/>
Apart from the surrounding world, and strong<br/>
In its own strength&mdash;most strange in one so young!

</p>
<p>
Now it so happen'd, in the catalogue<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Adeline, Aurora was omitted,<br/>
Although her birth and wealth had given her vogue<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the charmers we have already cited;<br/>
Her beauty also seem'd to form no clog<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Against her being mention'd as well fitted,<br/>
By many virtues, to be worth the trouble<br/>
Of single gentlemen who would be double.

</p>
<p>
And this omission, like that of the bust<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Brutus at the pageant of Tiberius,<br/>
Made Juan wonder, as no doubt he must.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This he express'd half smiling and half serious;<br/>
When Adeline replied with some disgust,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And with an air, to say the least, imperious,<br/>
She marvell'd 'what he saw in such a baby<br/>
As that prim, silent, cold Aurora Raby?'

</p>
<p>
Juan rejoin'd&mdash;'She was a Catholic,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore fittest, as of his persuasion;<br/>
Since he was sure his mother would fall sick,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Pope thunder excommunication,<br/>
If-' But here Adeline, who seem'd to pique<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Herself extremely on the inoculation<br/>
Of others with her own opinions, stated&mdash;<br/>
As usual&mdash;the same reason which she late did.

</p>
<p>
And wherefore not? A reasonable reason,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If good, is none the worse for repetition;<br/>
If bad, the best way 's certainly to tease on,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And amplify: you lose much by concision,<br/>
Whereas insisting in or out of season<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Convinces all men, even a politician;<br/>
Or&mdash;what is just the same&mdash;it wearies out.<br/>
So the end 's gain'd, what signifies the route?

</p>
<p>
Why Adeline had this slight prejudice&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For prejudice it was&mdash;against a creature<br/>
As pure as sanctity itself from vice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the added charm of form and feature,<br/>
For me appears a question far too nice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Adeline was liberal by nature;<br/>
But nature 's nature, and has more caprices<br/>
Than I have time, or will, to take to pieces.

</p>
<p>
Perhaps she did not like the quiet way<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With which Aurora on those baubles look'd,<br/>
Which charm most people in their earlier day:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For there are few things by mankind less brook'd,<br/>
And womankind too, if we so may say,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than finding thus their genius stand rebuked,<br/>
Like 'Anthony's by Caesar,' by the few<br/>
Who look upon them as they ought to do.

</p>
<p>
It was not envy<br/>
&mdash;Adeline had none;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her place was far beyond it, and her mind.<br/>
It was not scorn&mdash;which could not light on one<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose greatest fault was leaving few to find.<br/>
It was not jealousy, I think: but shun<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the 'ignes fatui' of mankind.<br/>
It was not&mdash;but 't is easier far, alas!<br/>
To say what it was not than what it was.

</p>
<p>
Little Aurora deem'd she was the theme<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such discussion. She was there a guest;<br/>
A beauteous ripple of the brilliant stream<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of rank and youth, though purer than the rest,<br/>
Which flow'd on for a moment in the beam<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Time sheds a moment o'er each sparkling crest.<br/>
Had she known this, she would have calmly smiled&mdash;<br/>
She had so much, or little, of the child.

</p>
<p>
The dashing and proud air of Adeline<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Imposed not upon her: she saw her blaze<br/>
Much as she would have seen a glow-worm shine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then turn'd unto the stars for loftier rays.<br/>
Juan was something she could not divine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Being no sibyl in the new world's ways;<br/>
Yet she was nothing dazzled by the meteor,<br/>
Because she did not pin her faith on feature.

</p>
<p>
His fame too,&mdash;for he had that kind of fame<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which sometimes plays the deuce with womankind,<br/>
A heterogeneous mass of glorious blame,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Half virtues and whole vices being combined;<br/>
Faults which attract because they are not tame;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Follies trick'd out so brightly that they blind:&mdash;<br/>
These seals upon her wax made no impression,<br/>
Such was her coldness or her self-possession.

</p>
<p>
Juan knew nought of such a character&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;High, yet resembling not his lost Haidee;<br/>
Yet each was radiant in her proper sphere:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The island girl, bred up by the lone sea,<br/>
More warm, as lovely, and not less sincere,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Nature's all: Aurora could not be,<br/>
Nor would be thus:&mdash;the difference in them<br/>
Was such as lies between a flower and gem.

</p>
<p>
Having wound up with this sublime comparison,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Methinks we may proceed upon our narrative,<br/>
And, as my friend Scott says, 'I sound my warison;'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott, the superlative of my comparative&mdash;<br/>
Scott, who can paint your Christian knight or Saracen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Serf, lord, man, with such skill as none would share it, if<br/>
There had not been one Shakspeare and Voltaire,<br/>
Of one or both of whom he seems the heir.

</p>
<p>
I say, in my slight way I may proceed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To play upon the surface of humanity.<br/>
I write the world, nor care if the world read,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least for this I cannot spare its vanity.<br/>
My Muse hath bred, and still perhaps may breed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More foes by this same scroll: when I began it, I<br/>
Thought that it might turn out so&mdash;now I know it,<br/>
But still I am, or was, a pretty poet.

</p>
<p>
The conference or congress (for it ended<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As congresses of late do) of the Lady<br/>
Adeline and Don Juan rather blended<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some acids with the sweets&mdash;for she was heady;<br/>
But, ere the matter could be marr'd or mended,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The silvery bell rang, not for 'dinner ready,<br/>
But for that hour, call'd half-hour, given to dress,<br/>
Though ladies' robes seem scant enough for less.

</p>
<p>
Great things were now to be achieved at table,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With massy plate for armour, knives and forks<br/>
For weapons; but what Muse since Homer 's able<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(His feasts are not the worst part of his works)<br/>
To draw up in array a single day-bill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of modern dinners? where more mystery lurks,<br/>
In soups or sauces, or a sole ragout,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than witches, bches, or physicians, brew.

</p>
<p>
There was a goodly 'soupe a la bonne femme,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though God knows whence it came from; there was, too,<br/>
A turbot for relief of those who cram,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Relieved with 'dindon a la Parigeux;'<br/>
There also wasthe sinner that I am!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How shall I get this gourmand stanza through?-<br/>
'Soupe a la Beauveau,' whose relief was dory,<br/>
Relieved itself by pork, for greater glory.

</p>
<p>
But I must crowd all into one grand mess<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or mass; for should I stretch into detail,<br/>
My Muse would run much more into excess,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than when some squeamish people deem her frail.<br/>
But though a 'bonne vivante,' I must confess<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her stomach 's not her peccant part; this tale<br/>
However doth require some slight refection,<br/>
Just to relieve her spirits from dejection.

</p>
<p>
Fowls 'a la Conde,' slices eke of salmon,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With 'sauces Genevoises,' and haunch of venison;<br/>
Wines too, which might again have slain young Ammon&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A man like whom I hope we shan't see many soon;<br/>
They also set a glazed Westphalian ham on,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereon Apicius would bestow his benison;<br/>
And then there was champagne with foaming whirls,<br/>
As white as Cleopatra's melted pearls.

</p>
<p>
Then there was God knows what 'a l'Allemande,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'A l'Espagnole,' 'timballe,' and 'salpicon'-<br/>
With things I can't withstand or understand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though swallow'd with much zest upon the whole;<br/>
And 'entremets' to piddle with at hand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently to lull down the subsiding soul;<br/>
While great Lucullus' Robe triumphal muffles<br/>
(There 's fame) young partridge fillets, deck'd with truffles.

</p>
<p>
What are the fillets on the victor's brow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To these? They are rags or dust. Where is the arch<br/>
Which nodded to the nation's spoils below?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the triumphal chariots' haughty march?<br/>
Gone to where victories must like dinners go.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Farther I shall not follow the research:<br/>
But oh! ye modern heroes with your cartridges,<br/>
When will your names lend lustre e'en to partridges?

</p>
<p>
Those truffles too are no bad accessaries,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow'd by 'petits puits d'amour'&mdash;a dish<br/>
Of which perhaps the cookery rather varies,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So every one may dress it to his wish,<br/>
According to the best of dictionaries,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which encyclopedize both flesh and fish;<br/>
But even sans 'confitures,' it no less true is,<br/>
There 's pretty picking in those 'petits puits.'

</p>
<p>
The mind is lost in mighty contemplation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of intellect expanded on two courses;<br/>
And indigestion's grand multiplication<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Requires arithmetic beyond my forces.<br/>
Who would suppose, from Adam's simple ration,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That cookery could have call'd forth such resources,<br/>
As form a science and a nomenclature<br/>
From out the commonest demands of nature?

</p>
<p>
The glasses jingled, and the palates tingled;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The diners of celebrity dined well;<br/>
The ladies with more moderation mingled<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the feast, pecking less than I can tell;<br/>
Also the younger men too: for a springald<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't, like ripe age, in gormandize excel,<br/>
But thinks less of good eating than the whisper<br/>
(When seated next him) of some pretty lisper.

</p>
<p>
Alas! I must leave undescribed the gibier,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The salmi, the consomme, the puree,<br/>
All which I use to make my rhymes run glibber<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than could roast beef in our rough John Bull way:<br/>
I must not introduce even a spare rib here,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Bubble and squeak' would spoil my liquid lay:<br/>
But I have dined, and must forego, Alas!<br/>
The chaste description even of a 'becasse;'

</p>
<p>
And fruits, and ice, and all that art refines<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From nature for the service of the gout&mdash;<br/>
Taste or the gout,&mdash;pronounce it as inclines<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your stomach! Ere you dine, the French will do;<br/>
But after, there are sometimes certain signs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which prove plain English truer of the two.<br/>
Hast ever had the gout? I have not had it&mdash;<br/>
But I may have, and you too, reader, dread it.

</p>
<p>
The simple olives, best allies of wine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Must I pass over in my bill of fare?<br/>
I must, although a favourite 'plat' of mine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Spain, and Lucca, Athens, every where:<br/>
On them and bread 't was oft my luck to dine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The grass my table-cloth, in open-air,<br/>
On Sunium or Hymettus, like Diogenes,<br/>
Of whom half my philosophy the progeny is.

</p>
<p>
Amidst this tumult of fish, flesh, and 'fowl,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And vegetables, all in masquerade,<br/>
The guests were placed according to their roll,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But various as the various meats display'd:<br/>
Don Juan sat next 'an l'Espagnole'-<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No damsel, but a dish, as hath been said;<br/>
But so far like a lady, that 't was drest<br/>
Superbly, and contain'd a world of zest.

</p>
<p>
By some odd chance too, he was placed between<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora and the Lady Adeline&mdash;<br/>
A situation difficult, I ween,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For man therein, with eyes and heart, to dine.<br/>
Also the conference which we have seen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was not such as to encourage him to shine;<br/>
For Adeline, addressing few words to him,<br/>
With two transcendent eyes seem'd to look through him.

</p>
<p>
I sometimes almost think that eyes have ears:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This much is sure, that, out of earshot, things<br/>
Are somehow echoed to the pretty dears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of which I can't tell whence their knowledge springs.<br/>
Like that same mystic music of the spheres,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which no one bears, so loudly though it rings,<br/>
'T is wonderful how oft the sex have heard<br/>
Long dialogues&mdash;which pass'd without a word!

</p>
<p>
Aurora sat with that indifference<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which piques a preux chevalier&mdash;as it ought:<br/>
Of all offences that 's the worst offence,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which seems to hint you are not worth a thought.<br/>
Now Juan, though no coxcomb in pretence,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was not exactly pleased to be so caught;<br/>
Like a good ship entangled among ice,<br/>
And after so much excellent advice.

</p>
<p>
To his gay nothings, nothing was replied,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or something which was nothing, as urbanity<br/>
Required. Aurora scarcely look'd aside,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor even smiled enough for any vanity.<br/>
The devil was in the girl! Could it be pride?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or modesty, or absence, or inanity?<br/>
Heaven knows? But Adeline's malicious eyes<br/>
Sparkled with her successful prophecies,

</p>
<p>
And look'd as much as if to say, 'I said it;'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A kind of triumph I 'll not recommend,<br/>
Because it sometimes, as I have seen or read it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Both in the case of lover and of friend,<br/>
Will pique a gentleman, for his own credit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring what was a jest to a serious end:<br/>
For all men prophesy what is or was,<br/>
And hate those who won't let them come to pass.

</p>
<p>
Juan was drawn thus into some attentions,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Slight but select, and just enough to express,<br/>
To females of perspicuous comprehensions,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he would rather make them more than less.<br/>
Aurora at the last (so history mentions,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though probably much less a fact than guess)<br/>
So far relax'd her thoughts from their sweet prison,<br/>
As once or twice to smile, if not to listen.

</p>
<p>
From answering she began to question; this<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With her was rare: and Adeline, who as yet<br/>
Thought her predictions went not much amiss,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Began to dread she'd thaw to a coquette&mdash;<br/>
So very difficult, they say, it is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep extremes from meeting, when once set<br/>
In motion; but she here too much refined&mdash;<br/>
Aurora's spirit was not of that kind.

</p>
<p>
But Juan had a sort of winning way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A proud humility, if such there be,<br/>
Which show'd such deference to what females say,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if each charming word were a decree.<br/>
His tact, too, temper'd him from grave to gay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And taught him when to be reserved or free:<br/>
He had the art of drawing people out,<br/>
Without their seeing what he was about.

</p>
<p>
Aurora, who in her indifference<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Confounded him in common with the crowd<br/>
Of flatterers, though she deem'd he had more sense<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than whispering foplings, or than witlings loud&mdash;<br/>
Commenced (from such slight things will great commence)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To feel that flattery which attracts the proud<br/>
Rather by deference than compliment,<br/>
And wins even by a delicate dissent.

</p>
<p>
And then he had good looks;&mdash;that point was carried<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nem. con. amongst the women, which I grieve<br/>
To say leads oft to crim. con. with the married&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A case which to the juries we may leave,<br/>
Since with digressions we too long have tarried.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now though we know of old that looks deceive,<br/>
And always have done, somehow these good looks<br/>
Make more impression than the best of books.

</p>
<p>
Aurora, who look'd more on books than faces,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was very young, although so very sage,<br/>
Admiring more Minerva than the Graces,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially upon a printed page.<br/>
But Virtue's self, with all her tightest laces,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Has not the natural stays of strict old age;<br/>
And Socrates, that model of all duty,<br/>
Own'd to a penchant, though discreet, for beauty.

</p>
<p>
And girls of sixteen are thus far Socratic,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But innocently so, as Socrates;<br/>
And really, if the sage sublime and Attic<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At seventy years had phantasies like these,<br/>
Which Plato in his dialogues dramatic<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Has shown, I know not why they should displease<br/>
In virgins&mdash;always in a modest way,<br/>
Observe; for that with me 's a 'sine qua.'

</p>
<p>
Also observe, that, like the great Lord Coke<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(See Littleton), whene'er I have express'd<br/>
Opinions two, which at first sight may look<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Twin opposites, the second is the best.<br/>
Perhaps I have a third, too, in a nook,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or none at all&mdash;which seems a sorry jest:<br/>
But if a writer should be quite consistent,<br/>
How could he possibly show things existent?

</p>
<p>
If people contradict themselves, can I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Help contradicting them, and every body,<br/>
Even my veracious self?<br/>
&mdash;But that 's a lie:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I never did so, never will&mdash;how should I?<br/>
He who doubts all things nothing can deny:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Truth's fountains may be clear&mdash;her streams are muddy,<br/>
And cut through such canals of contradiction,<br/>
That she must often navigate o'er fiction.

</p>
<p>
Apologue, fable, poesy, and parable,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are false, but may he render'd also true,<br/>
By those who sow them in a land that 's arable.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is wonderful what fable will not do!<br/>
'T is said it makes reality more bearable:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But what 's reality? Who has its clue?<br/>
Philosophy? No: she too much rejects.<br/>
Religion? Yes; but which of all her sects?

</p>
<p>
Some millions must be wrong, that 's pretty dear;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it may turn out that all were right.<br/>
God help us! Since we have need on our career<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep our holy beacons always bright,<br/>
'T is time that some new prophet should appear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or old indulge man with a second sight.<br/>
Opinions wear out in some thousand years,<br/>
Without a small refreshment from the spheres.

</p>
<p>
But here again, why will I thus entangle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Myself with metaphysics? None can hate<br/>
So much as I do any kind of wrangle;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, such is my folly, or my fate,<br/>
I always knock my head against some angle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;About the present, past, or future state.<br/>
Yet I wish well to Trojan and to Tyrian,<br/>
For I was bred a moderate Presbyterian.

</p>
<p>
But though I am a temperate theologian,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And also meek as a metaphysician,<br/>
Impartial between Tyrian and Trojan,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As Eldon on a lunatic commission&mdash;<br/>
In politics my duty is to show John<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull something of the lower world's condition.<br/>
It makes my blood boil like the springs of Hecla,<br/>
To see men let these scoundrel sovereigns break law.

</p>
<p>
But politics, and policy, and piety,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are topics which I sometimes introduce,<br/>
Not only for the sake of their variety,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But as subservient to a moral use;<br/>
Because my business is to dress society,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And stuff with sage that very verdant goose.<br/>
And now, that we may furnish with some matter all<br/>
Tastes, we are going to try the supernatural.

</p>
<p>
And now I will give up all argument;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And positively henceforth no temptation<br/>
Shall 'fool me to the top up of my bent:'-<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I' ll begin a thorough reformation.<br/>
Indeed, I never knew what people meant<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By deeming that my Muse's conversation<br/>
Was dangerous;<br/>
&mdash;I think she is as harmless<br/>
As some who labour more and yet may charm less.

</p>
<p>
Grim reader! did you ever see a ghost?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No; but you have heard<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;I understand&mdash;be dumb!<br/>
And don't regret the time you may have lost,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For you have got that pleasure still to come:<br/>
And do not think I mean to sneer at most<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these things, or by ridicule benumb<br/>
That source of the sublime and the mysterious:&mdash;<br/>
For certain reasons my belief is serious.

</p>
<p>
Serious? You laugh;&mdash;you may: that will I not;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My smiles must be sincere or not at all.<br/>
I say I do believe a haunted spot<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Exists&mdash;and where? That shall I not recall,<br/>
Because I 'd rather it should be forgot,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Shadows the soul of Richard' may appal.<br/>
In short, upon that subject I 've some qualms very<br/>
Like those of the philosopher of Malmsbury.

</p>
<p>
The night (I sing by night&mdash;sometimes an owl,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And now and then a nightingale) is dim,<br/>
And the loud shriek of sage Minerva's fowl<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rattles around me her discordant hymn:<br/>
Old portraits from old walls upon me scowl&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to heaven they would not look so grim;<br/>
The dying embers dwindle in the grate&mdash;<br/>
I think too that I have sate up too late:

</p>
<p>
And therefore, though 't is by no means my way<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To rhyme at noon&mdash;when I have other things<br/>
To think of, if I ever think<br/>
&mdash;I say<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel some chilly midnight shudderings,<br/>
And prudently postpone, until mid-day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Treating a topic which, alas! but brings<br/>
Shadows;&mdash;but you must be in my condition<br/>
Before you learn to call this superstition.
