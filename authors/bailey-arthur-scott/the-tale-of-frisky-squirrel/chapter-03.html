<p>One day Frisky Squirrel was playing in the woods when he came upon a
chestnut bur which had lain upon the ground all winter. And in a
twinkling Frisky had picked the nut from inside it and popped it into
his mouth. Then he started home to show his mother what he had found.
</p>
<p>But on the way home Frisky began to feel hungry. Just carrying that
nut inside his cheek was a little more than he could stand. And he
decided that he would eat the nut at once, and <u>tell</u> his mother about
it, instead of <u>showing</u> it to her.
</p><p>So Frisky hopped up on the top of a broad, flat rock. And sitting down
right in the center of it, he began to gnaw at the chestnut. He was so
busy and so interested in what he was doing that before he knew it the
rock began to move. It moved so slowly that it was not until it
started to climb a little hummock, and nearly tipped Frisky over on
his back, that he noticed what was happening.
</p><p>At first Frisky thought he must be dreaming. He nipped himself with
his sharp teeth to make sure that he was awake. And when he saw that
the rock was really walking right away with him he forgot all about
eating the chestnut. He let it fall out of his paws and roll away; for
he had never seen a rock move like that before.
</p><p>It was very exciting, though Frisky had never traveled so slowly
before. You see, whenever he went anywhere he always hurried as if he
had the most important business to attend to. But it was quite
different with that rock. It crawled along just as if it didn't care
whether it ever got anywhere or not.
</p><p>For a long time Frisky clung there. Now and then he almost slipped off
as the rock tilted. But it never tipped quite over; and Frisky managed
to stick on. And then, at last, he decided that he had better hop off
onto the ground, for he noticed that the rock was moving straight
toward the river. It went down the bank at a faster pace. And Frisky
leaped off just in time to escape a wetting, for the next moment the
rock dropped splash! into the water.
</p><p>Frisky Squirrel waited on the shore and watched it, with eyes wide
open with astonishment. He had expected to see it sink to the bottom
of the river. But the rock swam away as easily as you please. That was
the strangest part of it all--a rock which could not only walk, but
could swim as well!
</p><p>Frisky turned about and ran for home as fast as he could jump. This
time he certainly did have important business. He had such a strange
thing to tell his mother! He reached home quite out of breath. And as
soon as he could, he told Mrs. Squirrel what he had seen.
</p><p>That good lady did not know what to think. She had always found her
son to be truthful. But this was certainly a queer story. She lay
awake a long time that night thinking about the matter. And early the
next morning she took Frisky and set out for Swift River. Frisky led
her to the very spot where the stone had swum away.
</p><p>"There it is! There it is now!" he cried, as they paused upon the bank
and he pointed down toward the water's edge.
</p><p>When Mrs. Squirrel saw what Frisky was pointing at she no longer
wondered.
</p><p>"It's a mud turtle!" she exclaimed. "You had a ride on a mud turtle
and you never knew it." She smiled, because she was amused; and
because she was happy, too. For she knew that Frisky had told the
truth.
