<P>
Mr. Pengarth was loth to depart. He felt that all pretext for lingering was
gone, that he had outstayed his welcome. Yet he found himself desperately
striving for some excuse to prolong an interview which was to all effects and
purposes concluded.
<P>
"I will do my best, Sir Wingrave," he said, reverting to the subject of their
interview, "to study Miss Lundy's interests in every way. I will also see that
she has the letter you have left for her within eight days from now. But if
you could see you way to leave some sort of address so that I should have a
chance of communicating with you, if necessary, I should assume my
responsibilities with a lighter heart."
<P>
Wingrave gave vent to a little gesture of annoyance.
<P>
"My dear sir," he said, "surely I have been explicit enough. I have told you
that, within a week from now, I shall be practically dead. I shall never
return to England--you will never see me again. I have given life here a fair
trial, and found it a failure. I am going to make a new experiment--and it is
going to be in an unexplored country. You could not reach me there through the
post. You, I think, would scarcely car to follow me. Let it go at that."
<P>
Mr. Pengarth took up his bag with a sigh.
<P>
"Sir Wingrave," he said, "I am a simple man, and life with me has always been
a very simple affair. I recognize the fact, of course, that I am not in a
position to judge or to understand the mental attitude of one who, like
yourself, has suffered and passed through great crises. But I cannot help
wishing that you could find it possible to try, for a time, the quiet life of
a countryman in this beautiful home of yours."
<P>
Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
"Mr. Pengarth," he said, "no two men are born alike into this world. Some are
blessed with a contented mind, some are wanderers by destiny. You will forgive
me if I do not discuss the matter with you more fully. My journey, wherever
and whatever it is, is inevitable."
<P>
Mr. Pengarth was braver than he had ever been in his life.
<P>
"Sir Wingrave," he said, "there is one journey which we must all take in God's
good time. But the man who starts before he is called finds no welcome at the
end. The greatest in life are those who are content to wait!"
<P>
"I am not in the least disposed to doubt it, Mr. Pengarth," Wingrave said
calmly. "Now I must really send you away."
<P>
So Mr. Pengarth went, but Wingrave was not long destined to remain in
solitude. There was a sound of voices in the hall, Morrison's protesting,
another insistent. Then the door opened, and Wingrave looked up with darkening
face, which did not lighten when he recognized the intruder.
<P>
"Aynesworth!" he exclaimed, "what are you doing here? What do you want with
me?"
<P>
"Five minutes," Aynesworth answered, "and I mean to have it. You may as well
tell your man to take his hand off my shoulder."
<P>
Wingrave nodded to Morrison.
<P>
"You can go," he said. "Come back when I ring."
<P>
They were alone! Aynesworth threw down his hat and crossed the room until he
was within a few feet of Wingrave.
<P>
"Well, sir?"
<P>
Aynesworth laughed a little unnaturally.
<P>
"I had to come," he said. "It is humiliating, but the discipline is good for
me! I was determined to come and see once more the man who has made an utter
and complete fool of me."
<P>
Wingrave eyed him coldly.
<P>
"If you would be good enough to explain," he began.
<P>
"Oh, yes, I'll explain," Aynesworth answered. "I engaged myself to you as
secretary, didn't I, and I told you the reason at the time? I wanted to make a
study of you. I wanted to trace the effect of your long period of isolation
upon your subsequent actions. I entered upon my duties--how you must have
smiled at me behind my back! Never was a man more completely and absolutely
deceived. I lived with you, was always by your side, I was there professedly
to study your actions and the method of them. And yet you found it a perfectly
simple matter to hoodwink me whenever you chose!"
<P>
"In what respect?" Wingrave asked calmly.
<P>
"Every respect!" Aynesworth answered. "Let me tell you two things which
happened to me yesterday. I met a young New York stockbroker, named Nesbitt,
in London, and in common with all London, I suppose, by this time, I learnt
the secret of all those anonymous contributions to the hospitals and other
charitable causes during the last year."
<P>
"Go on," Wingrave said.
<P>
"I have come here on purpose to tell you what I think you are," Aynesworth
said. "You are the greatest hypocrite unhanged. You affect to hate your
fellows and to love evil-doers. You deceived the whole world, and you deceived
me. I know you now for what you are. You conceived your evil plans, but when
the time came for carrying them out, you funked it every time. You had that
silly little woman on the steamer in your power, and you yourself, behind your
own back, released her with that Marconigram to her husband, sent by yourself.
You brought the boy Nesbitt face to face with ruin, and to his face you
offered him no mercy. Behind his back you employ a lawyer to advance him your
own money to pay your own debt. You decline to give a single penny away in
charity and, as stealthily as possible, you give away in one year greater sums
than any other man has ever parted with. You decline to help the poor little
orphan child of the village organist, and secretly you have her brought up in
your own home, and stop the sale of your pictures for the sake of the child
whom you had only once contemptuously addressed. Can you deny any one of these
things?"
<P>
"No!" Wingrave answered quietly, "I cannot."
<P>
"And I thought you a strong man," Aynesworth continued, aggrieved and
contemptuous. "I nearly went mad with fear when I heard that it was you who
were the self-appointed guardian of Juliet Lundy. I looked upon this as one
more, the most diabolical of all your schemes!"
<P>
Wingrave rose to his feet, still and grave.
<P>
"Aynesworth," he said, "this interview does not interest me. Let us bring it
to an end. I admit that I have made a great failure of my life. I admit that I
have failed in realizing the ambitions I once confided to you. I came out from
prison with precisely those intentions, and I was conscious of nothing in
myself or my nature to prevent my carrying them out. It seems that I was
mistaken. I admit all this, but I do not admit your right to force yourself
into my presence and taunt me with my failure. You served me well enough, but
you were easily hoodwinked, and our connection is at an end. I have only one
thing to say to you. I am leaving this part of the world altogether. I shall
not return. That child has some foolish scruples about taking any more of my
money. That arises through your confounded interference. She is poor, almost
in want. If you should fail her now--"
<P>
Aynesworth interrupted with a hoarse little laugh.
<P>
"Wingrave," he said, "are you playing the simpleton? If Juliet will not take
your money, why should she take mine?"
<P>
Wingrave came out from his place. He was standing now between Aynesworth and
the door.
<P>
"Aynesworth," he said, "do I understand that you are not going to marry the
child?"
<P>
"I? Certainly not!" Aynesworth answered.
<P>
Wingrave remained quite calm, but there was a terrible light in his eyes.
<P>
"Now, for the first time, Aynesworth," he said, "I am glad that you are here.
We are going to have a complete understanding before you leave this room.
Juliet Lundy, as my ward, was, I believe, contented and happy. It suited you
to disturb our relations, and your excuse for doing so was that you loved her.
You took her away from me, and now you say that you do not intend to marry
her. Be so good as to tell me what the devil you do mean!"
<P>
Aynesworth laughed a little bitterly.
<P>
"You must excuse me," he said, "but a sense of humor was always my undoing,
and this reversal of our positions is a little odd, isn't it? I am not going
to marry Juliet Lundy because she happens not to care for me in that way at
all. My appearance is scarcely that of a joyous lover, is it?"
<P>
Wingrave eyed him more closely. Aynesworth had certainly fallen away from the
trim and carefully turned out young man of a few months back. He was paler,
too, and looked older.
<P>
"I do not understand this," Wingrave said.
<P>
"I do!" Aynesworth answered bitterly. "There is someone else?"
<P>
"Someone whom I do not know about?" Wingrave said, frowning heavily. "Who is
he, Aynesworth?"
<P>
Aynesworth shrugged his shoulders. He said nothing. Wingrave came a step
nearer to him.
<P>
"You may as well tell me." he said quietly, "for I shall postpone my journey
until I know the whole truth."
<P>
"It is not my secret," Aynesworth answered. "Ask her yourself!"
<P>
"Very well," Wingrave declared, "I will. I shall return to London tonight."
<P>
"It is not necessary," Aynesworth remarked.
<P>
Wingrave started.
<P>
"You mean that she is here?" he exclaimed.
<P>
Aynesworth drew him towards the window.
<P>
"Come," he said, "you shall ask her now."
<P>
Wingrave hesitated for a moment. An odd nervousness seemed to have taken
possession of him.
<P>
"I do not understand this, Aynesworth," he said. "Why is she here?"
<P>
"Go and ask her your question," Aynesworth said. "Perhaps you will understand
then."
<P>
Wingrave went down the path which led to the walled garden and the sea. The
tall hollyhocks brushed against his knees; the air, as mild as springtime, was
fragrant with the perfume of late roses. Wingrave took no note of these
things. Once more he seemed to see coming up the path the little black-frocked
child, with the pale face and the great sad eyes; it was she indeed who rose
so swiftly from the hidden seat. Then Wingrave stopped short for he felt
stirring within him all the long repressed madness of his unlived manhood. It
was the weakness against which he had fought so long and so wearily,
triumphant now, so that his heart beat like a boy's, and the color flamed into
his cheeks. And all the time she was coming nearer, and he saw that the child
had become a woman, and it seemed to him that all the joy of life was alight
in her face, and the one mysterious and wonderful secret of her sex was
shining softly out of her eager eyes. So that, after all, when they met,
Wingrave asked her no questions. She came into his arms with all the graceful
and perfect naturalness of a child who has wandered a little away from home .
. . .
<P>
"I am too old for you, dear," he said presently, as they wandered about the
garden, "much too old."
<P>
"Age," she answered softly, "what is that? What have we to do with the years
that are past? It is the years to come only which we need consider, and to
think of them makes me almost tremble with happiness. You are much too rich
and too wonderful a personage for a homeless orphan like me; but," she added,
tucking her arm through his with a contented little sigh, "I have you, and I
shall not let you go!"
