<p>
Nothing so difficult as a beginning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In poesy, unless perhaps the end;<br/>
For oftentimes when Pegasus seems winning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The race, he sprains a wing, and down we tend,<br/>
Like Lucifer when hurl'd from heaven for sinning;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sin the same, and hard as his to mend,<br/>
Being pride, which leads the mind to soar too far,<br/>
Till our own weakness shows us what we are.

</p>
<p>
But Time, which brings all beings to their level,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sharp Adversity, will teach at last<br/>
Man,&mdash;and, as we would hope,&mdash;perhaps the devil,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That neither of their intellects are vast:<br/>
While youth's hot wishes in our red veins revel,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We know not this&mdash;the blood flows on too fast;<br/>
But as the torrent widens towards the ocean,<br/>
We ponder deeply on each past emotion.

</p>
<p>
As boy, I thought myself a clever fellow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wish'd that others held the same opinion;<br/>
They took it up when my days grew more mellow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And other minds acknowledged my dominion:<br/>
Now my sere fancy 'falls into the yellow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaf,' and Imagination droops her pinion,<br/>
And the sad truth which hovers o'er my desk<br/>
Turns what was once romantic to burlesque.

</p>
<p>
And if I laugh at any mortal thing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is that I may not weep; and if I weep,<br/>
'T is that our nature cannot always bring<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Itself to apathy, for we must steep<br/>
Our hearts first in the depths of Lethe's spring,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere what we least wish to behold will sleep:<br/>
Thetis baptized her mortal son in Styx;<br/>
A mortal mother would on Lethe fix.

</p>
<p>
Some have accused me of a strange design<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the creed and morals of the land,<br/>
And trace it in this poem every line:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't pretend that I quite understand<br/>
My own meaning when I would be very fine;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fact is that I have nothing plann'd,<br/>
Unless it were to be a moment merry,<br/>
A novel word in my vocabulary.

</p>
<p>
To the kind reader of our sober clime<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This way of writing will appear exotic;<br/>
Pulci was sire of the half-serious rhyme,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sang when chivalry was more Quixotic,<br/>
And revell'd in the fancies of the time,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;True knights, chaste dames, huge giants, kings despotic:<br/>
But all these, save the last, being obsolete,<br/>
I chose a modern subject as more meet.

</p>
<p>
How I have treated it, I do not know;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps no better than they have treated me<br/>
Who have imputed such designs as show<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not what they saw, but what they wish'd to see:<br/>
But if it gives them pleasure, be it so;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a liberal age, and thoughts are free:<br/>
Meantime Apollo plucks me by the ear,<br/>
And tells me to resume my story here.

</p>
<p>
Young Juan and his lady-love were left<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To their own hearts' most sweet society;<br/>
Even Time the pitiless in sorrow cleft<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With his rude scythe such gentle bosoms; he<br/>
Sigh'd to behold them of their hours bereft,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though foe to love; and yet they could not be<br/>
Meant to grow old, but die in happy spring,<br/>
Before one charm or hope had taken wing.

</p>
<p>
Their faces were not made for wrinkles, their<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure blood to stagnate, their great hearts to fail;<br/>
The blank grey was not made to blast their hair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But like the climes that know nor snow nor hail<br/>
They were all summer: lightning might assail<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And shiver them to ashes, but to trail<br/>
A long and snake-like life of dull decay<br/>
Was not for them&mdash;they had too little day.

</p>
<p>
They were alone once more; for them to be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus was another Eden; they were never<br/>
Weary, unless when separate: the tree<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut from its forest root of years&mdash;the river<br/>
Damm'd from its fountain&mdash;the child from the knee<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And breast maternal wean'd at once for ever,&mdash;<br/>
Would wither less than these two torn apart;<br/>
Alas! there is no instinct like the heart&mdash;

</p>
<p>
The heart&mdash;which may be broken: happy they!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrice fortunate! who of that fragile mould,<br/>
The precious porcelain of human clay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Break with the first fall: they can ne'er behold<br/>
The long year link'd with heavy day on day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all which must be borne, and never told;<br/>
While life's strange principle will often lie<br/>
Deepest in those who long the most to die.

</p>
<p>
'Whom the gods love die young,' was said of yore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And many deaths do they escape by this:<br/>
The death of friends, and that which slays even more&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of friendship, love, youth, all that is,<br/>
Except mere breath; and since the silent shore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Awaits at last even those who longest miss<br/>
The old archer's shafts, perhaps the early grave<br/>
Which men weep over may be meant to save.

</p>
<p>
Haidee and Juan thought not of the dead&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavens, and earth, and air, seem'd made for them:<br/>
They found no fault with Time, save that he fled;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw not in themselves aught to condemn:<br/>
Each was the other's mirror, and but read<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy sparkling in their dark eyes like a gem,<br/>
And knew such brightness was but the reflection<br/>
Of their exchanging glances of affection.

</p>
<p>
The gentle pressure, and the thrilling touch,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The least glance better understood than words,<br/>
Which still said all, and ne'er could say too much;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A language, too, but like to that of birds,<br/>
Known but to them, at least appearing such<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As but to lovers a true sense affords;<br/>
Sweet playful phrases, which would seem absurd<br/>
To those who have ceased to hear such, or ne'er heard,&mdash;

</p>
<p>
All these were theirs, for they were children still,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And children still they should have ever been;<br/>
They were not made in the real world to fill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A busy character in the dull scene,<br/>
But like two beings born from out a rill,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A nymph and her beloved, all unseen<br/>
To pass their lives in fountains and on flowers,<br/>
And never know the weight of human hours.

</p>
<p>
Moons changing had roll'd on, and changeless found<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those their bright rise had lighted to such joys<br/>
As rarely they beheld throughout their round;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And these were not of the vain kind which cloys,<br/>
For theirs were buoyant spirits, never bound<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By the mere senses; and that which destroys<br/>
Most love, possession, unto them appear'd<br/>
A thing which each endearment more endear'd.

</p>
<p>
O beautiful! and rare as beautiful<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But theirs was love in which the mind delights<br/>
To lose itself when the old world grows dull,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And we are sick of its hack sounds and sights,<br/>
Intrigues, adventures of the common school,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its petty passions, marriages, and flights,<br/>
Where Hymen's torch but brands one strumpet more,<br/>
Whose husband only knows her not a wh&mdash;re.

</p>
<p>
Hard words; harsh truth; a truth which many know.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;The faithful and the fairy pair,<br/>
Who never found a single hour too slow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What was it made them thus exempt from care?<br/>
Young innate feelings all have felt below,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which perish in the rest, but in them were<br/>
Inherent&mdash;what we mortals call romantic,<br/>
And always envy, though we deem it frantic.

</p>
<p>
This is in others a factitious state,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An opium dream of too much youth and reading,<br/>
But was in them their nature or their fate:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No novels e'er had set their young hearts bleeding,<br/>
For Haidee's knowledge was by no means great,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Juan was a boy of saintly breeding;<br/>
So that there was no reason for their loves<br/>
More than for those of nightingales or doves.

</p>
<p>
They gazed upon the sunset; 't is an hour<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear unto all, but dearest to their eyes,<br/>
For it had made them what they were: the power<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of love had first o'erwhelm'd them from such skies,<br/>
When happiness had been their only dower,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And twilight saw them link'd in passion's ties;<br/>
Charm'd with each other, all things charm'd that brought<br/>
The past still welcome as the present thought.

</p>
<p>
I know not why, but in that hour to-night,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as they gazed, a sudden tremor came,<br/>
And swept, as 't were, across their hearts' delight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the wind o'er a harp-string, or a flame,<br/>
When one is shook in sound, and one in sight;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus some boding flash'd through either frame,<br/>
And call'd from Juan's breast a faint low sigh,<br/>
While one new tear arose in Haidee's eye.

</p>
<p>
That large black prophet eye seem'd to dilate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And follow far the disappearing sun,<br/>
As if their last day! of a happy date<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With his broad, bright, and dropping orb were gone;<br/>
Juan gazed on her as to ask his fate&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt a grief, but knowing cause for none,<br/>
His glance inquired of hers for some excuse<br/>
For feelings causeless, or at least abstruse.

</p>
<p>
She turn'd to him, and smiled, but in that sort<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which makes not others smile; then turn'd aside:<br/>
Whatever feeling shook her, it seem'd short,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And master'd by her wisdom or her pride;<br/>
When Juan spoke, too&mdash;it might be in sport&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this their mutual feeling, she replied&mdash;<br/>
'If it should be so,&mdash;but&mdash;it cannot be&mdash;<br/>
Or I at least shall not survive to see.'

</p>
<p>
Juan would question further, but she press'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His lip to hers, and silenced him with this,<br/>
And then dismiss'd the omen from her breast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Defying augury with that fond kiss;<br/>
And no doubt of all methods 't is the best:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people prefer wine&mdash;'t is not amiss;<br/>
I have tried both; so those who would a part take<br/>
May choose between the headache and the heartache.

</p>
<p>
One of the two, according to your choice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Woman or wine, you 'll have to undergo;<br/>
Both maladies are taxes on our joys:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But which to choose, I really hardly know;<br/>
And if I had to give a casting voice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For both sides I could many reasons show,<br/>
And then decide, without great wrong to either,<br/>
It were much better to have both than neither.

</p>
<p>
Juan and Haidee gazed upon each other<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With swimming looks of speechless tenderness,<br/>
Which mix'd all feelings, friend, child, lover, brother,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All that the best can mingle and express<br/>
When two pure hearts are pour'd in one another,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And love too much, and yet can not love less;<br/>
But almost sanctify the sweet excess<br/>
By the immortal wish and power to bless.

</p>
<p>
Mix'd in each other's arms, and heart in heart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did they not then die?&mdash;they had lived too long<br/>
Should an hour come to bid them breathe apart;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Years could but bring them cruel things or wrong;<br/>
The world was not for them, nor the world's art<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For beings passionate as Sappho's song;<br/>
Love was born with them, in them, so intense,<br/>
It was their very spirit&mdash;not a sense.

</p>
<p>
They should have lived together deep in woods,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unseen as sings the nightingale; they were<br/>
Unfit to mix in these thick solitudes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Call'd social, haunts of Hate, and Vice, and Care:<br/>
How lonely every freeborn creature broods!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweetest song-birds nestle in a pair;<br/>
The eagle soars alone; the gull and crow<br/>
Flock o'er their carrion, just like men below.

</p>
<p>
Now pillow'd cheek to cheek, in loving sleep,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Haidee and Juan their siesta took,<br/>
A gentle slumber, but it was not deep,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever and anon a something shook<br/>
Juan, and shuddering o'er his frame would creep;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Haidee's sweet lips murmur'd like a brook<br/>
A wordless music, and her face so fair<br/>
Stirr'd with her dream, as rose-leaves with the air.

</p>
<p>
Or as the stirring of a deep dear stream<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within an Alpine hollow, when the wind<br/>
Walks o'er it, was she shaken by the dream,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystical usurper of the mind&mdash;<br/>
O'erpowering us to be whate'er may seem<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Good to the soul which we no more can bind;<br/>
Strange state of being! (for 't is still to be)<br/>
Senseless to feel, and with seal'd eyes to see.

</p>
<p>
She dream'd of being alone on the sea-shore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chain'd to a rock; she knew not how, but stir<br/>
She could not from the spot, and the loud roar<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew, and each wave rose roughly, threatening her;<br/>
And o'er her upper lip they seem'd to pour,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until she sobb'd for breath, and soon they were<br/>
Foaming o'er her lone head, so fierce and high&mdash;<br/>
Each broke to drown her, yet she could not die.

</p>
<p>
Anon&mdash;she was released, and then she stray'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the sharp shingles with her bleeding feet,<br/>
And stumbled almost every step she made;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And something roll'd before her in a sheet,<br/>
Which she must still pursue howe'er afraid:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was white and indistinct, nor stopp'd to meet<br/>
Her glance nor grasp, for still she gazed, and grasp'd,<br/>
And ran, but it escaped her as she clasp'd.

</p>
<p>
The dream changed:&mdash;in a cave she stood, its walls<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were hung with marble icicles, the work<br/>
Of ages on its water-fretted halls,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where waves might wash, and seals might breed and lurk;<br/>
Her hair was dripping, and the very balls<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her black eyes seem'd turn'd to tears, and mirk<br/>
The sharp rocks look'd below each drop they caught,<br/>
Which froze to marble as it fell,&mdash;she thought.

</p>
<p>
And wet, and cold, and lifeless at her feet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale as the foam that froth'd on his dead brow,<br/>
Which she essay'd in vain to clear (how sweet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were once her cares, how idle seem'd they now!),<br/>
Lay Juan, nor could aught renew the beat<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his quench'd heart; and the sea dirges low<br/>
Rang in her sad ears like a mermaid's song,<br/>
And that brief dream appear'd a life too long.

</p>
<p>
And gazing on the dead, she thought his face<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Faded, or alter'd into something new&mdash;<br/>
Like to her father's features, till each trace&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More like and like to Lambro's aspect grew&mdash;<br/>
With all his keen worn look and Grecian grace;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And starting, she awoke, and what to view?<br/>
O! Powers of Heaven! what dark eye meets she there?<br/>
'T is&mdash;'t is her father's&mdash;fix'd upon the pair!

</p>
<p>
Then shrieking, she arose, and shrieking fell,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With joy and sorrow, hope and fear, to see<br/>
Him whom she deem'd a habitant where dwell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The ocean-buried, risen from death, to be<br/>
Perchance the death of one she loved too well:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear as her father had been to Haidee,<br/>
It was a moment of that awful kind&mdash;<br/>
I have seen such&mdash;but must not call to mind.

</p>
<p>
Up Juan sprung to Haidee's bitter shriek,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And caught her falling, and from off the wall<br/>
Snatch'd down his sabre, in hot haste to wreak<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Vengeance on him who was the cause of all:<br/>
Then Lambro, who till now forbore to speak,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiled scornfully, and said, 'Within my call,<br/>
A thousand scimitars await the word;<br/>
Put up, young man, put up your silly sword.'

</p>
<p>
And Haidee clung around him; 'Juan, 't is&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is Lambro&mdash;'t is my father! Kneel with me&mdash;<br/>
He will forgive us&mdash;yes&mdash;it must be&mdash;yes.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O! dearest father, in this agony<br/>
Of pleasure and of pain&mdash;even while I kiss<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy garment's hem with transport, can it be<br/>
That doubt should mingle with my filial joy?<br/>
Deal with me as thou wilt, but spare this boy.'

</p>
<p>
High and inscrutable the old man stood,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm in his voice, and calm within his eye&mdash;<br/>
Not always signs with him of calmest mood:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He look'd upon her, but gave no reply;<br/>
Then turn'd to Juan, in whose cheek the blood<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft came and went, as there resolved to die;<br/>
In arms, at least, he stood, in act to spring<br/>
On the first foe whom Lambro's call might bring.

</p>
<p>
'Young man, your sword;' so Lambro once more said:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan replied, 'Not while this arm is free.'<br/>
The old man's cheek grew pale, but not with dread,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And drawing from his belt a pistol, he<br/>
Replied, 'Your blood be then on your own head.'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then look'd dose at the flint, as if to see<br/>
'T was fresh&mdash;for he had lately used the lock&mdash;<br/>
And next proceeded quietly to cock.

</p>
<p>
It has a strange quick jar upon the ear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That cocking of a pistol, when you know<br/>
A moment more will bring the sight to bear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon your person, twelve yards off, or so;<br/>
A gentlemanly distance, not too near,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have got a former friend for foe;<br/>
But after being fired at once or twice,<br/>
The ear becomes more Irish, and less nice.

</p>
<p>
Lambro presented, and one instant more<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had stopp'd this Canto, and Don Juan's breath,<br/>
When Haidee threw herself her boy before;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stern as her sire: 'On me,' she cried, 'let death<br/>
Descend&mdash;the fault is mine; this fatal shore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He found&mdash;but sought not. I have pledged my faith;<br/>
I love him<br/>
&mdash;I will die with him: I knew<br/>
Your nature's firmness&mdash;know your daughter's too.'

</p>
<p>
A minute past, and she had been all tears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tenderness, and infancy; but now<br/>
She stood as one who champion'd human fears&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale, statue-like, and stern, she woo'd the blow;<br/>
And tall beyond her sex, and their compeers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She drew up to her height, as if to show<br/>
A fairer mark; and with a fix'd eye scann'd<br/>
Her father's face&mdash;but never stopp'd his hand.

</p>
<p>
He gazed on her, and she on him; 't was strange<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How like they look'd! the expression was the same;<br/>
Serenely savage, with a little change<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the large dark eye's mutual-darted flame;<br/>
For she, too, was as one who could avenge,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If cause should be&mdash;a lioness, though tame.<br/>
Her father's blood before her father's face<br/>
Boil'd up, and proved her truly of his race.

</p>
<p>
I said they were alike, their features and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their stature, differing but in sex and years;<br/>
Even to the delicacy of their hand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There was resemblance, such as true blood wears;<br/>
And now to see them, thus divided, stand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In fix'd ferocity, when joyous tears<br/>
And sweet sensations should have welcomed both,<br/>
Show what the passions are in their full growth.

</p>
<p>
The father paused a moment, then withdrew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His weapon, and replaced it; but stood still,<br/>
And looking on her, as to look her through,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Not I,' he said, 'have sought this stranger's ill;<br/>
Not I have made this desolation: few<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would bear such outrage, and forbear to kill;<br/>
But I must do my duty&mdash;how thou hast<br/>
Done thine, the present vouches for the past.

</p>
<p>
'Let him disarm; or, by my father's head,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His own shall roll before you like a ball!'<br/>
He raised his whistle, as the word he said,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And blew; another answer'd to the call,<br/>
And rushing in disorderly, though led,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And arm'd from boot to turban, one and all,<br/>
Some twenty of his train came, rank on rank;<br/>
He gave the word,&mdash;'Arrest or slay the Frank.'

</p>
<p>
Then, with a sudden movement, he withdrew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His daughter; while compress'd within his clasp,<br/>
'Twixt her and Juan interposed the crew;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain she struggled in her father's grasp&mdash;<br/>
His arms were like a serpent's coil: then flew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon their prey, as darts an angry asp,<br/>
The file of pirates; save the foremost, who<br/>
Had fallen, with his right shoulder half cut through.

</p>
<p>
The second had his cheek laid open; but<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The third, a wary, cool old sworder, took<br/>
The blows upon his cutlass, and then put<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His own well in; so well, ere you could look,<br/>
His man was floor'd, and helpless at his foot,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the blood running like a little brook<br/>
From two smart sabre gashes, deep and red&mdash;<br/>
One on the arm, the other on the head.

</p>
<p>
And then they bound him where he fell, and bore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan from the apartment: with a sign<br/>
Old Lambro bade them take him to the shore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where lay some ships which were to sail at nine.<br/>
They laid him in a boat, and plied the oar<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until they reach'd some galliots, placed in line;<br/>
On board of one of these, and under hatches,<br/>
They stow'd him, with strict orders to the watches.

</p>
<p>
The world is full of strange vicissitudes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And here was one exceedingly unpleasant:<br/>
A gentleman so rich in the world's goods,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Handsome and young, enjoying all the present,<br/>
Just at the very time when he least broods<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On such a thing is suddenly to sea sent,<br/>
Wounded and chain'd, so that he cannot move,<br/>
And all because a lady fell in love.

</p>
<p>
Here I must leave him, for I grow pathetic,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Moved by the Chinese nymph of tears, green tea!<br/>
Than whom Cassandra was not more prophetic;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For if my pure libations exceed three,<br/>
I feel my heart become so sympathetic,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That I must have recourse to black Bohea:<br/>
'T is pity wine should be so deleterious,<br/>
For tea and coffee leave us much more serious,

</p>
<p>
Unless when qualified with thee, Cogniac!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Naiad of the Phlegethontic rill!<br/>
Ah! why the liver wilt thou thus attack,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And make, like other nymphs, thy lovers ill?<br/>
I would take refuge in weak punch, but rack<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(In each sense of the word), whene'er I fill<br/>
My mild and midnight beakers to the brim,<br/>
Wakes me next morning with its synonym.

</p>
<p>
I leave Don Juan for the present, safe&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not sound, poor fellow, but severely wounded;<br/>
Yet could his corporal pangs amount to half<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those with which his Haidee's bosom bounded?<br/>
She was not one to weep, and rave, and chafe,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then give way, subdued because surrounded;<br/>
Her mother was a Moorish maid, from Fez,<br/>
Where all is Eden, or a wilderness.

</p>
<p>
There the large olive rains its amber store<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In marble fonts; there grain, and flower, and fruit,<br/>
Gush from the earth until the land runs o'er;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But there, too, many a poison-tree has root,<br/>
And midnight listens to the lion's roar,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And long, long deserts scorch the camel's foot,<br/>
Or heaving whelm the helpless caravan;<br/>
And as the soil is, so the heart of man.

</p>
<p>
Afric is all the sun's, and as her earth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her human day is kindled; full of power<br/>
For good or evil, burning from its birth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moorish blood partakes the planet's hour,<br/>
And like the soil beneath it will bring forth:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beauty and love were Haidee's mother's dower;<br/>
But her large dark eye show'd deep Passion's force,<br/>
Though sleeping like a lion near a source.

</p>
<p>
Her daughter, temper'd with a milder ray,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like summer clouds all silvery, smooth, and fair,<br/>
Till slowly charged with thunder they display<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Terror to earth, and tempest to the air,<br/>
Had held till now her soft and milky way;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But overwrought with passion and despair,<br/>
The fire burst forth from her Numidian veins,<br/>
Even as the Simoom sweeps the blasted plains.

</p>
<p>
The last sight which she saw was Juan's gore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he himself o'ermaster'd and cut down;<br/>
His blood was running on the very floor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where late he trod, her beautiful, her own;<br/>
Thus much she view'd an instant and no more,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her struggles ceased with one convulsive groan;<br/>
On her sire's arm, which until now scarce held<br/>
Her writhing, fell she like a cedar fell'd.

</p>
<p>
A vein had burst, and her sweet lips' pure dyes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were dabbled with the deep blood which ran o'er;<br/>
And her head droop'd as when the lily lies<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'ercharged with rain: her summon'd handmaids bore<br/>
Their lady to her couch with gushing eyes;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of herbs and cordials they produced their store,<br/>
But she defied all means they could employ,<br/>
Like one life could not hold, nor death destroy.

</p>
<p>
Days lay she in that state unchanged, though chill&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With nothing livid, still her lips were red;<br/>
She had no pulse, but death seem'd absent still;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No hideous sign proclaim'd her surely dead;<br/>
Corruption came not in each mind to kill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All hope; to look upon her sweet face bred<br/>
New thoughts of life, for it seem'd full of soul&mdash;<br/>
She had so much, earth could not claim the whole.

</p>
<p>
The ruling passion, such as marble shows<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When exquisitely chisell'd, still lay there,<br/>
But fix'd as marble's unchanged aspect throws<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the fair Venus, but for ever fair;<br/>
O'er the Laocoon's all eternal throes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever-dying Gladiator's air,<br/>
Their energy like life forms all their fame,<br/>
Yet looks not life, for they are still the same.

</p>
<p>
She woke at length, but not as sleepers wake,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather the dead, for life seem'd something new,<br/>
A strange sensation which she must partake<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perforce, since whatsoever met her view<br/>
Struck not on memory, though a heavy ache<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay at her heart, whose earliest beat still true<br/>
Brought back the sense of pain without the cause,<br/>
For, for a while, the furies made a pause.

</p>
<p>
She look'd on many a face with vacant eye,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On many a token without knowing what;<br/>
She saw them watch her without asking why,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And reck'd not who around her pillow sat;<br/>
Not speechless, though she spoke not; not a sigh<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Relieved her thoughts; dull silence and quick chat<br/>
Were tried in vain by those who served; she gave<br/>
No sign, save breath, of having left the grave.

</p>
<p>
Her handmaids tended, but she heeded not;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her father watch'd, she turn'd her eyes away;<br/>
She recognized no being, and no spot,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;However dear or cherish'd in their day;<br/>
They changed from room to room&mdash;but all forgot&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentle, but without memory she lay;<br/>
At length those eyes, which they would fain be weaning<br/>
Back to old thoughts, wax'd full of fearful meaning.

</p>
<p>
And then a slave bethought her of a harp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The harper came, and tuned his instrument;<br/>
At the first notes, irregular and sharp,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On him her flashing eyes a moment bent,<br/>
Then to the wall she turn'd as if to warp<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her thoughts from sorrow through her heart re-sent;<br/>
And he begun a long low island song<br/>
Of ancient days, ere tyranny grew strong.

</p>
<p>
Anon her thin wan fingers beat the wall<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In time to his old tune; he changed the theme,<br/>
And sung of love; the fierce name struck through all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her recollection; on her flash'd the dream<br/>
Of what she was, and is, if ye could call<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be so being; in a gushing stream<br/>
The tears rush'd forth from her o'erclouded brain,<br/>
Like mountain mists at length dissolved in rain.

</p>
<p>
Short solace, vain relief!&mdash;thought came too quick,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And whirl'd her brain to madness; she arose<br/>
As one who ne'er had dwelt among the sick,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And flew at all she met, as on her foes;<br/>
But no one ever heard her speak or shriek,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although her paroxysm drew towards its dose;&mdash;<br/>
Hers was a phrensy which disdain'd to rave,<br/>
Even when they smote her, in the hope to save.

</p>
<p>
Yet she betray'd at times a gleam of sense;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing could make her meet her father's face,<br/>
Though on all other things with looks intense<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She gazed, but none she ever could retrace;<br/>
Food she refused, and raiment; no pretence<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Avail'd for either; neither change of place,<br/>
Nor time, nor skill, nor remedy, could give her<br/>
Senses to sleep&mdash;the power seem'd gone for ever.

</p>
<p>
Twelve days and nights she wither'd thus; at last,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a groan, or sigh, or glance, to show<br/>
A parting pang, the spirit from her past:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And they who watch'd her nearest could not know<br/>
The very instant, till the change that cast<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her sweet face into shadow, dull and slow,<br/>
Glazed o'er her eyes&mdash;the beautiful, the black&mdash;<br/>
O! to possess such lustre&mdash;and then lack!

</p>
<p>
She died, but not alone; she held within<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A second principle of life, which might<br/>
Have dawn'd a fair and sinless child of sin;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But closed its little being without light,<br/>
And went down to the grave unborn, wherein<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Blossom and bough lie wither'd with one blight;<br/>
In vain the dews of Heaven descend above<br/>
The bleeding flower and blasted fruit of love.

</p>
<p>
Thus lived&mdash;thus died she; never more on her<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall sorrow light, or shame. She was not made<br/>
Through years or moons the inner weight to bear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which colder hearts endure till they are laid<br/>
By age in earth: her days and pleasures were<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Brief, but delightful&mdash;such as had not staid<br/>
Long with her destiny; but she sleeps well<br/>
By the sea-shore, whereon she loved to dwell.

</p>
<p>
That isle is now all desolate and bare,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its dwellings down, its tenants pass'd away;<br/>
None but her own and father's grave is there,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And nothing outward tells of human clay;<br/>
Ye could not know where lies a thing so fair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No stone is there to show, no tongue to say<br/>
What was; no dirge, except the hollow sea's,<br/>
Mourns o'er the beauty of the Cyclades.

</p>
<p>
But many a Greek maid in a loving song<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighs o'er her name; and many an islander<br/>
With her sire's story makes the night less long;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Valour was his, and beauty dwelt with her:<br/>
If she loved rashly, her life paid for wrong&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A heavy price must all pay who thus err,<br/>
In some shape; let none think to fly the danger,<br/>
For soon or late Love is his own avenger.

</p>
<p>
But let me change this theme which grows too sad,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And lay this sheet of sorrows on the shelf;<br/>
I don't much like describing people mad,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For fear of seeming rather touch'd myself&mdash;<br/>
Besides, I 've no more on this head to add;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And as my Muse is a capricious elf,<br/>
We 'll put about, and try another tack<br/>
With Juan, left half-kill'd some stanzas back.

</p>
<p>
Wounded and fetter'd, 'cabin'd, cribb'd, confined,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some days and nights elapsed before that he<br/>
Could altogether call the past to mind;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he did, he found himself at sea,<br/>
Sailing six knots an hour before the wind;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The shores of Ilion lay beneath their lee&mdash;<br/>
Another time he might have liked to see 'em,<br/>
But now was not much pleased with Cape Sigaeum.

</p>
<p>
There, on the green and village-cotted hill, is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Flank'd by the Hellespont and by the sea)<br/>
Entomb'd the bravest of the brave, Achilles;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They say so (Bryant says the contrary):<br/>
And further downward, tall and towering still, is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The tumulus&mdash;of whom? Heaven knows! 't may be<br/>
Patroclus, Ajax, or Protesilaus&mdash;<br/>
All heroes, who if living still would slay us.

</p>
<p>
High barrows, without marble or a name,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A vast, untill'd, and mountain-skirted plain,<br/>
And Ida in the distance, still the same,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And old Scamander (if 't is he) remain;<br/>
The situation seems still form'd for fame&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A hundred thousand men might fight again<br/>
With case; but where I sought for Ilion's walls,<br/>
The quiet sheep feeds, and the tortoise crawls;

</p>
<p>
Troops of untended horses; here and there<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some little hamlets, with new names uncouth;<br/>
Some shepherds (unlike Paris) led to stare<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment at the European youth<br/>
Whom to the spot their school-boy feelings bear;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A turk, with beads in hand and pipe in mouth,<br/>
Extremely taken with his own religion,<br/>
Are what I found there&mdash;but the devil a Phrygian.

</p>
<p>
Don Juan, here permitted to emerge<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From his dull cabin, found himself a slave;<br/>
Forlorn, and gazing on the deep blue surge,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'ershadow'd there by many a hero's grave;<br/>
Weak still with loss of blood, he scarce could urge<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A few brief questions; and the answers gave<br/>
No very satisfactory information<br/>
About his past or present situation.

</p>
<p>
He saw some fellow captives, who appear'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be Italians, as they were in fact;<br/>
From them, at least, their destiny he heard,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which was an odd one; a troop going to act<br/>
In Sicily (all singers, duly rear'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In their vocation) had not been attack'd<br/>
In sailing from Livorno by the pirate,<br/>
But sold by the impresario at no high rate.

</p>
<p>
By one of these, the buffo of the party,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan was told about their curious case;<br/>
For although destined to the Turkish mart, he<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still kept his spirits up&mdash;at least his face;<br/>
The little fellow really look'd quite hearty,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bore him with some gaiety and grace,<br/>
Showing a much more reconciled demeanour,<br/>
Than did the prima donna and the tenor.

</p>
<p>
In a few words he told their hapless story,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, 'Our Machiavellian impresario,<br/>
Making a signal off some promontory,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail'd a strange brig<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Corpo di Caio Mario!<br/>
We were transferr'd on board her in a hurry,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a Single scudo of salario;<br/>
But if the Sultan has a taste for song,<br/>
We will revive our fortunes before long.

</p>
<p>
'The prima donna, though a little old,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And haggard with a dissipated life,<br/>
And subject, when the house is thin, to cold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Has some good notes; and then the tenor's wife,<br/>
With no great voice, is pleasing to behold;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Last carnival she made a deal of strife<br/>
By carrying off Count Cesare Cicogna<br/>
From an old Roman princess at Bologna.

</p>
<p>
'And then there are the dancers; there 's the Nini,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With more than one profession, gains by all;<br/>
Then there 's that laughing slut the Pelegrini,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She, too, was fortunate last carnival,<br/>
And made at least five hundred good zecchini,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But spends so fast, she has not now a paul;<br/>
And then there 's the Grotesca&mdash;such a dancer!<br/>
Where men have souls or bodies she must answer.

</p>
<p>
'As for the figuranti, they are like<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of all that tribe; with here and there<br/>
A pretty person, which perhaps may strike,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest are hardly fitted for a fair;<br/>
There 's one, though tall and stiffer than a pike,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet has a sentimental kind of air<br/>
Which might go far, but she don't dance with vigour;<br/>
The more 's the pity, with her face and figure.

</p>
<p>
'As for the men, they are a middling set;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The musico is but a crack'd old basin,<br/>
But being qualified in one way yet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May the seraglio do to set his face in,<br/>
And as a servant some preferment get;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His singing I no further trust can place in:<br/>
From all the Pope makes yearly 't would perplex<br/>
To find three perfect pipes of the third sex.

</p>
<p>
'The tenor's voice is spoilt by affectation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the bass, the beast can only bellow;<br/>
In fact, he had no singing education,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An ignorant, noteless, timeless, tuneless fellow;<br/>
But being the prima donna's near relation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who swore his voice was very rich and mellow,<br/>
They hired him, though to hear him you 'd believe<br/>
An ass was practising recitative.

</p>
<p>
''T would not become myself to dwell upon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My own merits, and though young<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;I see, Sir&mdash;you<br/>
Have got a travell'd air, which speaks you one<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom the opera is by no means new:<br/>
You 've heard of Raucocanti?<br/>
&mdash;I 'm the man;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The time may come when you may hear me too;<br/>
You was not last year at the fair of Lugo,<br/>
But next, when I 'm engaged to sing there&mdash;do go.

</p>
<p>
'Our baritone I almost had forgot,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A pretty lad, but bursting with conceit;<br/>
With graceful action, science not a jot,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice of no great compass, and not sweet,<br/>
He always is complaining of his lot,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Forsooth, scarce fit for ballads in the street;<br/>
In lovers' parts his passion more to breathe,<br/>
Having no heart to show, he shows his teeth.'

</p>
<p>
Here Raucocanti's eloquent recital<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was interrupted by the pirate crew,<br/>
Who came at stated moments to invite all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The captives back to their sad berths; each threw<br/>
A rueful glance upon the waves (which bright all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From the blue skies derived a double blue,<br/>
Dancing all free and happy in the sun),<br/>
And then went down the hatchway one by one.

</p>
<p>
They heard next day&mdash;that in the Dardanelles,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for his Sublimity's firman,<br/>
The most imperative of sovereign spells,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which every body does without who can,<br/>
More to secure them in their naval cells,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady to lady, well as man to man,<br/>
Were to be chain'd and lotted out per couple,<br/>
For the slave market of Constantinople.

</p>
<p>
It seems when this allotment was made out,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There chanced to be an odd male, and odd female,<br/>
Who (after some discussion and some doubt,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the soprano might be deem'd to be male,<br/>
They placed him o'er the women as a scout)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were link'd together, and it happen'd the male<br/>
Was Juan,&mdash;who, an awkward thing at his age,<br/>
Pair'd off with a Bacchante blooming visage.

</p>
<p>
With Raucocanti lucklessly was chain'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The tenor; these two hated with a hate<br/>
Found only on the stage, and each more pain'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With this his tuneful neighbour than his fate;<br/>
Sad strife arose, for they were so cross-grain'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of bearing up without debate,<br/>
That each pull'd different ways with many an oath,<br/>
'Arcades ambo,' id est&mdash;blackguards both.

</p>
<p>
Juan's companion was a Romagnole,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But bred within the March of old Ancona,<br/>
With eyes that look'd into the very soul<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(And other chief points of a 'bella donna'),<br/>
Bright&mdash;and as black and burning as a coal;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And through her dear brunette complexion shone<br/>
Great wish to please&mdash;a most attractive dower,<br/>
Especially when added to the power.

</p>
<p>
But all that power was wasted upon him,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For sorrow o'er each sense held stern command;<br/>
Her eye might flash on his, but found it dim;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And though thus chain'd, as natural her hand<br/>
Touch'd his, nor that&mdash;nor any handsome limb<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(And she had some not easy to withstand)<br/>
Could stir his pulse, or make his faith feel brittle;<br/>
Perhaps his recent wounds might help a little.

</p>
<p>
No matter; we should ne'er too much enquire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But facts are facts: no knight could be more true,<br/>
And firmer faith no ladye&mdash;love desire;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We will omit the proofs, save one or two:<br/>
'T is said no one in hand 'can hold a fire<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By thought of frosty Caucasus;' but few,<br/>
I really think; yet Juan's then ordeal<br/>
Was more triumphant, and not much less real.

</p>
<p>
Here I might enter on a chaste description,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Having withstood temptation in my youth,<br/>
But hear that several people take exception<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At the first two books having too much truth;<br/>
Therefore I 'll make Don Juan leave the ship soon,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the publisher declares, in sooth,<br/>
Through needles' eyes it easier for the camel is<br/>
To pass, than those two cantos into families.

</p>
<p>
'T is all the same to me; I 'm fond of yielding,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore leave them to the purer page<br/>
Of Smollett, Prior, Ariosto, Fielding,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who say strange things for so correct an age;<br/>
I once had great alacrity in wielding<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My pen, and liked poetic war to wage,<br/>
And recollect the time when all this cant<br/>
Would have provoked remarks which now it shan't.

</p>
<p>
As boys love rows, my boyhood liked a squabble;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this hour I wish to part in peace,<br/>
Leaving such to the literary rabble:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether my verse's fame be doom'd to cease<br/>
While the right hand which wrote it still is able,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or of some centuries to take a lease,<br/>
The grass upon my grave will grow as long,<br/>
And sigh to midnight winds, but not to song.

</p>
<p>
Of poets who come down to us through distance<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of time and tongues, the foster-babes of Fame,<br/>
Life seems the smallest portion of existence;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where twenty ages gather o'er a name,<br/>
'T is as a snowball which derives assistance<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From every flake, and yet rolls on the same,<br/>
Even till an iceberg it may chance to grow;<br/>
But, after all, 't is nothing but cold snow.

</p>
<p>
And so great names are nothing more than nominal,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And love of glory 's but an airy lust,<br/>
Too often in its fury overcoming all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would as 't were identify their dust<br/>
From out the wide destruction, which, entombing all,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaves nothing till 'the coming of the just'-<br/>
Save change: I 've stood upon Achilles' tomb,<br/>
And heard Troy doubted; time will doubt of Rome.

</p>
<p>
The very generations of the dead<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are swept away, and tomb inherits tomb,<br/>
Until the memory of an age is fled,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, buried, sinks beneath its offspring's doom:<br/>
Where are the epitaphs our fathers read?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save a few glean'd from the sepulchral gloom<br/>
Which once-named myriads nameless lie beneath,<br/>
And lose their own in universal death.

</p>
<p>
I canter by the spot each afternoon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where perish'd in his fame the hero-boy,<br/>
Who lived too long for men, but died too soon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For human vanity, the young De Foix!<br/>
A broken pillar, not uncouthly hewn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But which neglect is hastening to destroy,<br/>
Records Ravenna's carnage on its face,<br/>
While weeds and ordure rankle round the base.

</p>
<p>
I pass each day where Dante's bones are laid:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A little cupola, more neat than solemn,<br/>
Protects his dust, but reverence here is paid<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the bard's tomb, and not the warrior's column.<br/>
The time must come, when both alike decay'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The chieftain's trophy, and the poet's volume,<br/>
Will sink where lie the songs and wars of earth,<br/>
Before Pelides' death, or Homer's birth.

</p>
<p>
With human blood that column was cemented,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With human filth that column is defiled,<br/>
As if the peasant's coarse contempt were vented<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To show his loathing of the spot he soil'd:<br/>
Thus is the trophy used, and thus lamented<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should ever be those blood-hounds, from whose wild<br/>
Instinct of gore and glory earth has known<br/>
Those sufferings Dante saw in hell alone.

</p>
<p>
Yet there will still be bards: though fame is smoke,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its fumes are frankincense to human thought;<br/>
And the unquiet feelings, which first woke<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Song in the world, will seek what then they sought;<br/>
As on the beach the waves at last are broke,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus to their extreme verge the passions brought<br/>
Dash into poetry, which is but passion,<br/>
Or at least was so ere it grew a fashion.

</p>
<p>
If in the course of such a life as was<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At once adventurous and contemplative,<br/>
Men, who partake all passions as they pass,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquire the deep and bitter power to give<br/>
Their images again as in a glass,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And in such colours that they seem to live;<br/>
You may do right forbidding them to show 'em,<br/>
But spoil (I think) a very pretty poem.

</p>
<p>
O! ye, who make the fortunes of all books!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Benign Ceruleans of the second sex!<br/>
Who advertise new poems by your looks,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your 'imprimatur' will ye not annex?<br/>
What! must I go to the oblivious cooks,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those Cornish plunderers of Parnassian wrecks?<br/>
Ah! must I then the only minstrel be,<br/>
Proscribed from tasting your Castalian tea!

</p>
<p>
What! can I prove 'a lion' then no more?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A ball-room bard, a foolscap, hot-press darling?<br/>
To bear the compliments of many a bore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sigh, 'I can't get out,' like Yorick's starling;<br/>
Why then I 'll swear, as poet Wordy swore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Because the world won't read him, always snarling),<br/>
That taste is gone, that fame is but a lottery,<br/>
Drawn by the blue-coat misses of a coterie.

</p>
<p>
O! 'darkly, deeply, beautifully blue,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As some one somewhere sings about the sky,<br/>
And I, ye learned ladies, say of you;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They say your stockings are so (Heaven knows why,<br/>
I have examined few pair of that hue);<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue as the garters which serenely lie<br/>
Round the Patrician left-legs, which adorn<br/>
The festal midnight, and the levee morn.

</p>
<p>
Yet some of you are most seraphic creatures&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But times are alter'd since, a rhyming lover,<br/>
You read my stanzas, and I read your features:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And&mdash;but no matter, all those things are over;<br/>
Still I have no dislike to learned natures,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For sometimes such a world of virtues cover;<br/>
I knew one woman of that purple school,<br/>
The loveliest, chastest, best, but&mdash;quite a fool.

</p>
<p>
Humboldt, 'the first of travellers,' but not<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The last, if late accounts be accurate,<br/>
Invented, by some name I have forgot,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As well as the sublime discovery's date,<br/>
An airy instrument, with which he sought<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To ascertain the atmospheric state,<br/>
By measuring 'the intensity of blue:'<br/>
O, Lady Daphne! let me measure you!

</p>
<p>
But to the narrative:<br/>
&mdash;The vessel bound<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With slaves to sell off in the capital,<br/>
After the usual process, might be found<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At anchor under the seraglio wall;<br/>
Her cargo, from the plague being safe and sound,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were landed in the market, one and all,<br/>
And there with Georgians, Russians, and Circassians,<br/>
Bought up for different purposes and passions.

</p>
<p>
Some went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For one Circassian, a sweet girl, were given,<br/>
Warranted virgin; beauty's brightest colours<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had deck'd her out in all the hues of heaven:<br/>
Her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who bade on till the hundreds reach'd eleven;<br/>
But when the offer went beyond, they knew<br/>
'T was for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.

</p>
<p>
Twelve negresses from Nubia brought a price<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which the West Indian market scarce would bring;<br/>
Though Wilberforce, at last, has made it twice<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What 't was ere Abolition; and the thing<br/>
Need not seem very wonderful, for vice<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is always much more splendid than a king:<br/>
The virtues, even the most exalted, Charity,<br/>
Are saving&mdash;vice spares nothing for a rarity.

</p>
<p>
But for the destiny of this young troop,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How some were bought by pachas, some by Jews,<br/>
How some to burdens were obliged to stoop,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And others rose to the command of crews<br/>
As renegadoes; while in hapless group,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoping no very old vizier might choose,<br/>
The females stood, as one by one they pick'd 'em,<br/>
To make a mistress, or fourth wife, or victim:

</p>
<p>
All this must be reserved for further song;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Also our hero's lot, howe'er unpleasant<br/>
(Because this Canto has become too long),<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Must be postponed discreetly for the present;<br/>
I 'm sensible redundancy is wrong,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But could not for the muse of me put less in 't:<br/>
And now delay the progress of Don Juan,<br/>
Till what is call'd in Ossian the fifth Juan.
