<p>The daring escape of the prisoner did not tend to improve the
temper of Capt. Asbury, and he indulged in a number of emphatic
expressions, during which Monteith Sterry was dignified enough
to hold his peace.</p>

<p>But the leader of the stockmen quickly recovered his self-poise
and accepted the matter as one of the peculiar incidents liable
to take place at any time.</p>

<p>His version of the difficulty with the rustlers differed from
that given by Vesey. They rode up to the house, not knowing who
dwelt there, and were received with a shot, which, fortunately,
did no damage. Duke Vesey was at the rear, near the structure
in which the horses were stabled, when he hurriedly mounted and
dashed off, just as he had recently done. He did not make a fight
like his companion, who, as was represented, stood his ground.
He was repeatedly summoned to surrender, but paid no heed to it,
and it became a choice whether to shoot him down or allow him
to empty the saddles.</p>

<p>While Sterry could not feel so well disposed toward Vesey after
hearing this account, he did not regret the part he had acted,
and he was also suspicious that Capt. Asbury had tinged his version
with a little romance.</p>

<p>The incident itself was of small moment, but the consequences
were likely to be far-reaching and important. One of the rustlers
had fallen and his companion had escaped. His story of the fight
would place the blame wholly upon the stockmen and inflame the
feeling between the rustlers and ranchmen, already at a dangerous
intensity.</p>

<p>Capt. Asbury was out with his men for the purpose of arresting
several of the most notorious of the offenders against the law.
Those rustlers were sufficiently powerful to make trouble. If
they were given time to organize they could sweep the captain
and his little party from the earth. There was reason to believe
they would do that very thing, now that Duke Vesey was at liberty
to spread his account of the last outrage.</p>

<p>Capt. Asbury held a brief consultation with his men, all, including
Sterry, taking part. The consensus of opinion was that they ought
to effect a junction with some of the larger parties of stockmen
known to be abroad, or withdraw to some safe point like Buffalo,
Riverside, or the nearest military station.</p>

<p>Ira Inman, Larch Cadmus and the others were on the "war-path,"
and at no great distance. Morning would probably find them in
sight, if the stockmen should stay where they were.</p>

<p>Capt. Asbury decided to ride to the westward, in the hope of
effecting a junction with friends or of reaching a point where
they would be secure against their assailants.</p>

<p>The night was well advanced, but their horses had done comparatively
little travelling and were capable of a good deal more. The captain
took the lead, holding only occasional converse with his men as
he swung along at an easy pace; but he, like the rest, was on
the lookout for danger, which was liable to approach from any
point of the compass.</p>

<p>A marked change showed itself in the temperature. The weather,
as will be remembered, had been unusually mild earlier in the
evening, but it now became sharp and chilly, as though the breath
from the snowy mountain crests was wafted down upon them.</p>

<p>In a valley-like depression, an hour later, where there was an
abundance of grass, beside a flowing stream of water, the party
went into camp, with a couple of their number on guard, just as
they would have done if in a hostile country&mdash;which in point of
fact was the case.</p>

<p>The night passed, however, without any disturbance, and all were
astir before sunrise. The men were provided with several days'
rations, while the succulent grass afforded the animals all the
food they needed, so there was no trouble on that score.</p>

<p>Capt. Asbury and Monteith Sterry mounted their horses and rode
to the crest of the nearest elevation, which was fully 100 feet
in height and commanded a wide sweep of country. The morning was
clear and bright, and the first glance they cast to the northward
revealed a stirring sight. A horseman was less than a half-mile
away, and riding at headlong speed, as if in the extremity of
mortal fright.</p>

<p>"What can it mean?" asked the puzzled leader; "no one is pursuing
him, and I see no cause for his panic."</p>

<p>"I suspect," replied Sterry, thoughtfully, "that he is a messenger
bringing important tidings to you."</p>
