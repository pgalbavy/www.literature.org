<p><em>THE </em>excitement in relation to the Frontier Angel and
the lost Marian, was greatly increased by two circumstances, that
occurred on the day following the return of Peterson. It had been
determined, as the reader has already learned, by Dingle, that
he should start to the Shawnee towns in search of tidings of Marian.
In this dangerous undertaking it was agreed that Peterson should
join him. The latter, having undergone considerable toil and fatigue,
was compelled to remain over night by the commander, in order
to be prepared for what was before him.</p>

<p>Shortly after the sun had risen, and while the two scouts were
preparing to start upon their expedition, the sentinel on the
platform of the block-house reported an Indian canoe visible,
far up the Ohio. The scouts including Abbot, Mansfield, Jenkins,
and several others instantly ascended the platform to view the
suspicious object. It was at a great distance&mdash;so great that it
resembled a duck, or something similar, slowly swimming the river.
It was not crossing, as first supposed, but coming down stream,
and would if it continued, pass by the settlement.</p>

<p>"Hello!" exclaimed Dingle, "there comes another one right behind
it. What does that mean? Looks qu'ar I declar'."</p>

<p>Our friends continued gazing at the two canoes now visible with
an intense interest. The last one had just rounded a bend in the
river, and followed in the wake of the first. Whether it was in
pursuit or not was impossible to tell at the great distance; but,
<em>if</em> so, their progress was so similar, that they seemed
like moving automata, connected with each other under the water,
and propelled by the same power. They kept the center of the current,
in a direct line with each other, and moved steadily and rapidly
as could be easily seen even at the distance they were away. They
did not swerve a foot from a straight line, as seemingly anxious
were they to hurry forward.</p>

<p>"Can't you make anything of it?" asked Mansfield.</p>

<p>"I can see their paddles shinin' in the water," replied Dingle,
"and &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>think&mdash;" he added, speaking slowly with
his eyes fixed upon the canoes&mdash;"I think&mdash;yes, &mdash;I know there
is only one in the first boat and there is&mdash;yes, two in the last.
It is a race, sure as thunder!" he exclaimed, standing and looking
around upon the others.</p>

<p>"Perhaps only a friendly one, between a couple of Indian canoes,"
suggested Abbot.</p>

<p>"We don't have such races on the 'Hio this time of year," replied
the ranger with a quiet smile.</p>

<p>It was certainly singular that the same suspicion should enter
the heads of all at the same time, and yet not one mention it,
until it grew into a certainty. All continued watching the canoes,
until it was evident that one person was pursued by a couple,
and that the race was a most determined one upon both sides.</p>

<p>"Freeze me to death on a stump!" suddenly exclaimed Peterson,
"if that person in the first canoe ain't that <em>Frontier Angel</em>,
then shoot me!"</p>

<p>"That's so," added Dingle, "and the one as is chasin' of her
is our old friend Mr. McGable and an Injin!"</p>

<p>Several, as said, had entertained suspicions that the mysterious
Frontier Angel was in the first canoe, but not one, save Dingle,
had any idea that it could be the notorious renegade in pursuit.
Even as it was, the commander of the post refused to believe he
would venture so soon within sight of the block-house.</p>

<p>"It's him," continued the ranger with complete assurance, "I
never was mistaken 'bout him, you can bet a powerful heap on that."</p>

<p>"If so, you are standing here and going to see our best friend
captured," said the commander in a tone of severe rebuke.</p>

<p>"She ain't agwine to be captured," coolly replied Dingle. "I
guess McGable and his Shawnee will have to take a few instructions
in rowing of the canoe, afore they'll stand a chance to cotch
the Frontier Angel."</p>

<p>"Can he not shoot her?" asked the commander more sternly than
before. "Dingle, you and Peterson hurry into the wood to her assistance,
for she will need it. Shoot that McGable, and I will give each
of you twenty pounds a piece, besides reporting you to the general."</p>

<p>"He <em>can</em> shoot," said Dingle to himself. "Come, boys,
let's hurry. We orter started long ago, and we might've stood
some chance. He can kill her now ef he takes a notion afore we
can draw bead on him."</p>

<p>The two, accompanied by Mansfield, hurried out to the gate, were
permitted to pass out by a man stationed there, and away they
sped across the clearing and into the wood, as fast as their legs
could carry them.</p>

<p>"Foller me!" called Dingle, ducking his head and plunging through
the bushes with a wonderful celerity, while Mansfield and Peterson
strung along behind him with equal fleetness.</p>

<p>In the meantime, those upon the platform were watching the canoe
with intense and painful interest.</p>

<p>"The old rapscallion is gainin' on the beautiful angel," remarked
Jenkins, excitedly. "Oh, if I was only where I could get my grasp
on that feller's throat, I'd choke him to death in five seconds!
Oh! oh! oh! wouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"No; I do not think he has gained at all upon her," remarked
Abbot. "At any rate, the race cannot be continued much longer,
for they will soon be nigh enough to run into danger. If we could
only hit them with the swivel," he added, looking toward the commander.</p>

<p>The latter shook his head.</p>

<p>"The swivel is only to be used in cases of great emergency. We
did not use it when the Shawnees made the night attack, because
we could get along without its aid. Besides, it is not loaded
with a single ball, but filled with slugs, bullets, and bits of
iron, so as to do as much destruction as possible upon an enemy
nigh at hand. No; the firing of the swivel, however well aimed,
could effect no good purpose."</p>

<p>"I wonder at the presumption and daring of McGable," said Abbot,
turning his gaze once more up the river. "They say he only differs
from Simon Girty in point of cowardice. His heart is as black,
but his face is often white with fear. But this looks like bravery,
to see him venture so nigh the spot which he knows is so dangerous
to him."</p>

<p>"He won't come much nigher. I only hope that Dingle will get
him within range of that rifle of his. It is all folly to undertake
to capture him. If we should secure him, he would manage to get
off again through the help of that fool of a Jenkins."</p>

<p>The commander did not notice that the individual he referred
to stood directly behind, and was gazing completely dumbfounded
at him. Had he known it, he would not have cared, for the thought
of the foolish escape of the renegade was ever a source of irritation
to him, and he took no pains to conceal his opinion of Jenkins'
cowardice. But this was the first time the latter had heard him
speak thus, and, as said, he was astonished in no small degree.</p>

<p>"Why, didn't I tell you how it was? how the Old Boy carried him
off, and I fought like blazes to stop him, but happened to have
one of my fainting fits just then. Think you'd believe a feller
when he tells the truth."</p>

<p>"I do," dryly rejoined the commander.</p>

<p>"I tell you," said Abbot, excitedly, "if McGable comes much further
he will surely run against Dingle's bullet. He is so eager he
does not seem to notice where he is running to. Look how that
Shawnee pulls!"</p>

<p>"And they are gaining upon her as sure as the world. She is wearied
and well-nigh tired out. Heavens! it is too much to stand here
and witness that," exclaimed the commander, half beside himself.
"Why, in the name of heaven, don't Dingle shoot him? He would
have been nigh enough if he had only walked. I cannot comprehend
it!"</p>

<p>"Look! McGable is going to shoot!"</p>

<p>"It cannot be&mdash;yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that instant, a bright flash was seen to flame out in the
front of the rear canoe, a thin wreath of smoke curled upward,
and a moment after, the faint report of the renegade's rifle was
heard.</p>

<p>"Is she hit? Curse it, where is Dingle?" exclaimed the commander,
fidgeting and moving about as though unable to contain himself.</p>

<p>"She is wounded, but not killed. See! she is coming in to shore."</p>

<p>The canoe of the Frontier Angel was now hurrying in toward the
Kentucky shore, swiftly followed by that of the renegade. She
had approached so nigh as to be hidden to the view of those at
the block-house, but was still at a considerable distance. It
was at this moment that the Indian accompanying McGable dropped
his paddle, rose to his feet, and had the gun already at his shoulder,
when two simultaneous reports were heard, and he threw his arms
wildly over his head and sprang headlong into the river, upsetting
the canoe at the same time. McGable, who was a most excellent
swimmer, dove deep and came up a long way from the canoe, whose
bottom formed a black spot on the surface. His head hardly appeared
before it sank again, and Dingle and Peterson really believed
he was drowning. But it was only a feint of the wary wretch. His
head was descried still farther down-stream, when it finally disappeared
altogether. But, after a while, he was seen to rise too far away
to be within rifle-range, and walked away in the forest.</p>

<p>The reason of his escaping all the shots of the whites was this.
In the hurry of departure, Mansfield had never once thought of
taking his rifle with him, so that there were really but two shots.
Dingle and Peterson had hurried to their utmost, notwithstanding
the remark of the commander, who was not so situated as to be
able rightly to judge of duration. Upon coming in view, they both
raised their guns together and took aim at the form of the renegade.
That instant the savage rose and aimed at the Frontier Angel.
His immediate death could only save her; there was no time for
consultation, so that one might accomplish this. The danger was
too imminent, and, naturally enough, they both fired together.
The canoe instantly upset, and the skillful manner in which the
renegade effected his own escape has already been shown.</p>

<p>Our three friends remained watching for his reappearance, until
it was made at a great distance down-stream. This, of course,
was a considerable time after the shooting of the Indian, and
during the interval their attention had never once been directed
to the Frontier Angel. Now, as they turned to look for her, she
was nowhere to be seen. Remembering the point toward which she
was hastening, they searched along the shore, and, at last, found
her canoe, pulled high upon the bank and secreted beneath the
bushes, but there were no signs of her. A careful examination
of the canoe and the ground around, failed to show the least sign
of blood, so that they were compelled to the joyful belief that
she had escaped the shot of McGable without being even wounded.</p>

<p>How this could be, the two rangers were at a loss to tell, for
the renegade was so close at hand, and the object was so well-presented,
that even an ordinary marksman could scarcely have failed.</p>

<p>"That settles the matter," said Dingle, compressing his lips
and shaking his head; "that's the second time he's tried to kill
her and couldn't do it. I s'pose some will say she ain't a <em>sperit</em>
now&mdash;but you needn't tell Dick Dingle so."</p>

<p>"Nor Jim Peterson," added that individual himself.</p>

<p>"There ain't even a trail of her, and she ain't nowhere about
<em>h'yer</em>&mdash;she's <em>gone up</em>, she has. You might shoot
at her all day, and not hurt her. H'yers as don't undertake any
such foolery as to warn her&mdash;'cause why? thar ain't no need of
it. She ain't in danger, and never was or will be."</p>

<p>"Wonder why she don't kill that devil McGable?" remarked Peterson,
leaning on his rifle and gazing meditatively down the river.</p>

<p>"She'll give it to him <em>awful</em> 'fore he gets through&mdash;see
ef she don't. His time ain't come yet."</p>

<p>Some further time was spent in similar remarks, when the three
set out for the block-house. It was the intention of Dingle and
Peterson to start for the Shawnee towns, but the commander instructed
them to remain over until the next morning, when, if nothing unusual
happened, they would be allowed to pursue their journey. The rangers
were not very unwilling to this, as the sky gave appearance of
another storm, and the adventure with McGable had its effect upon
them.</p>

<p>The morrow came, but the rangers went not, and it was ordered
that they never should again.</p>
