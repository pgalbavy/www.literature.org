<p>
Albert's uncle was out on his bicycle as usual.  After the day when
we became Canterbury Pilgrims and were brought home in the dog-cart
with red wheels by the lady he told us was his long-lost
grandmother he had known years ago in India, he spent not nearly so
much of his time in writing, and he used to shave every morning
instead of only when requisite, as in earlier days.  And he was
always going out on his bicycle in his new Norfolk suit.  We are
not so unobserving as grown-up people make out.  We knew well
enough he was looking for the long-lost.  And we jolly well wished
he might find her.  Oswald, always full of sympathy with
misfortune, however undeserved, had himself tried several times to
find the lady.  So had the others.  But all this is what they call
a digression; it has nothing to do with the dragon's teeth I am now
narrating.</p>

<p>It began with the pig dying - it was the one we had for the circus,
but it having behaved so badly that day had nothing to do with its
illness and death, though the girls said they felt remorse, and
perhaps if we hadn't made it run so that day it might have been
spared to us.  But Oswald cannot pretend that people were right
just because they happen to be dead, and as long as that pig was
alive we all knew well enough that it was it that made us run - and
not us it.</p>

<p>The pig was buried in the kitchen garden.  Bill, that we made the
tombstone for, dug the grave, and while he was away at his dinner
we took a turn at digging, because we like to be useful, and
besides, when you dig you never know what you may turn up.  I knew
a man once that found a gold ring on the point of his fork when he
was digging potatoes, and you know how we found two half-crowns
ourselves once when we were digging for treasure.</p>

<p>Oswald was taking his turn with the spade, and the others were
sitting on the gravel and telling him how to do it.</p>

<p>'Work with a will,' Dicky said, yawning.</p>

<p>Alice said, 'I wish we were in a book.  People in books never dig
without finding something.  I think I'd rather it was a secret
passage than anything.'</p>

<p>Oswald stopped to wipe his honest brow ere replying.</p>

<p>'A secret's nothing when you've found it out.  Look at the secret
staircase.  It's no good, not even for hide-and-seek, because of
its squeaking.  I'd rather have the pot of gold we used to dig for
when we were little.'  It was really only last year, but you seem
to grow old very quickly after you have once passed the prime of
your youth, which is at ten, I believe.</p>

<p>'How would you like to find the mouldering bones of Royalist
soldiers foully done to death by nasty Ironsides?'Noel asked, with
his mouth full of plum.</p>

<p>'If they were really dead it wouldn't matter,' Dora said.  'What
I'm afraid of is a skeleton that can walk about and catch at your
legs when you're going upstairs to bed.'
'Skeletons can't walk,' Alice said in a hurry; 'you know they
can't, Dora.'</p>

<p>And she glared at Dora till she made her sorry she had said what
she had.  The things you are frightened of, or even those you would
rather not meet in the dark, should never be mentioned before the
little ones, or else they cry when it comes to bed-time, and say it
was because of what you said.</p>

<p>'We shan't find anything.  No jolly fear,' said Dicky.</p>

<p>And just then my spade I was digging with struck on something hard,
and it felt hollow.  I did really think for one joyful space that
we had found that pot of gold.  But the thing, whatever it was,
seemed to be longish; longer, that is, than a pot of gold would
naturally be.  And as I uncovered it I saw that it was not at all
pot-of-gold-colour, but like a bone Pincher has buried.  So Oswald
said - </p>

<p>'It IS the skeleton.'</p>

<p>The girls all drew back, and Alice said, 'Oswald, I wish you
wouldn't.'</p>

<p>A moment later the discovery was unearthed, and Oswald lifted it
up, with both hands.</p>

<p>'It's a dragon's head,' Noel said, and it certainly looked like it.</p>

<p>It was long and narrowish and bony, and with great yellow teeth
sticking in the jaw.</p>

<p>Bill came back just then and said it was a horse's head, but H. O.
and Noel would not believe it, and Oswald owns that no horse he has
ever seen had a head at all that shape.</p>

<p>But Oswald did not stop to argue, because he saw a keeper who
showed me how to set snares going by, and he wanted to talk to him
about ferrets, so he went off and Dicky and Denny and Alice with
him.  Also Daisy and Dora went off to finish reading Ministering
Children.  So H. O. and Noel were left with the bony head.  They
took it away.</p>

<p>The incident had quite faded from the mind of Oswald next day.  But
just before breakfast Noel and H. O. came in, looking hot and
anxious.  They had got up early and had not washed at all - not even
their hands and faces.  Noel made Oswald a secret signal.  All the
others saw it, and with proper delicate feeling pretended not to
have.</p>

<p>When Oswald had gone out with Noel and H. O. in obedience to the
secret signal, Noel said - </p>

<p>'You know that dragon's head yesterday?'</p>

<p>'Well?' Oswald said quickly, but not crossly - the two things are
quite different.</p>

<p>'Well, you know what happened in Greek history when some chap sowed
dragon's teeth?'</p>

<p>'They came up armed men,' said H. O., but Noel sternly bade him
shut up, and Oswald said 'Well,' again.  If he spoke impatiently it
was because he smelt the bacon being taken in to breakfast.</p>

<p>'Well,' Noel went on, 'what do you suppose would have come up if
we'd sowed those dragon's teeth we found yesterday?'</p>

<p>'Why, nothing, you young duffer,' said Oswald, who could now smell
the coffee.  'All that isn't History it's Humbug.  Come on in to
brekker.'</p>

<p>'It's NOT humbug,' H. O. cried, 'it is history.  We DID sow - '</p>

<p>'Shut up,' said Noel again.  'Look here, Oswald.  We did sow those
dragon's teeth in Randall's ten-acre meadow, and what do you think
has come up?'</p>

<p>'Toadstools I should think,' was Oswald's contemptible rejoinder.</p>

<p>'They have come up a camp of soldiers,' said Noel - ARMED MEN.  So
you see it WAS history.  We have sowed army-seed, just like Cadmus,
and it has come up.  It was a very wet night.  I daresay that
helped it along.'</p>

<p>Oswald could not decide which to disbelieve - his brother or his
ears.  So, disguising his doubtful emotions without a word, he led
the way to the bacon and the banqueting hall.</p>

<p>He said nothing about the army-seed then, neither did Noel and H.
O. But after the bacon we went into the garden, and then the good
elder brother said - </p>

<p>'Why don't you tell the others your cock-and-bull story?'</p>

<p>So they did, and their story was received with warm expressions of
doubt.  It was Dicky who observed - </p>

<p>'Let's go and have a squint at Randall's ten-acre, anyhow.  I saw
a hare there the other day.'</p>

<p>We went.  It is some little way, and as we went, disbelief reigned
superb in every breast except Noel's and H. O.'s, so you will see
that even the ready pen of the present author cannot be expected to
describe to you his variable sensations when he got to the top of
the hill and suddenly saw that his little brothers had spoken the
truth.  I do not mean that they generally tell lies, but people
make mistakes sometimes, and the effect is the same as lies if you
believe them.</p>

<p>There WAS a camp there with real tents and soldiers in grey and red
tunics.  I daresay the girls would have said coats.  We stood in
ambush, too astonished even to think of lying in it, though of
course we know that this is customary.  The ambush was the wood on
top of the little hill, between Randall's ten-acre meadow and
Sugden's Waste Wake pasture.</p>

<p>'There would be cover here for a couple of regiments,' whispered
Oswald, who was, I think, gifted by Fate with the far-seeingness of
a born general.</p>

<p>Alice merely said 'Hist', and we went down to mingle with the
troops as though by accident, and seek for information.</p>

<p>The first man we came to at the edge of the camp was cleaning a
sort of cauldron thing like witches brew bats in.</p>

<p>We went up to him and said, 'Who are you?  Are you English, or are
you the enemy?'</p>

<p>'We're the enemy,' he said, and he did not seem ashamed of being
what he was.  And he spoke English with quite a good accent for a
foreigner.</p>

<p>'The enemy!' Oswald echoed in shocked tones.  It is a terrible
thing to a loyal and patriotic youth to see an enemy cleaning a pot
in an English field, with English sand, and looking as much at home
as if he was in his foreign fastnesses.</p>

<p>The enemy seemed to read Oswald's thoughts with deadly
unerringness.  He said - </p>

<p>'The English are somewhere over on the other side of the hill. 
They are trying to keep us out of Maidstone.'</p>

<p>After this our plan of mingling with the troops did not seem worth
going on with.  This soldier, in spite of his unerringness in
reading Oswald's innermost heart, seemed not so very sharp in other
things, or he would never have given away his secret plans like
this, for he must have known from our accents that we were Britons
to the backbone.  Or perhaps (Oswald thought this, and it made his
blood at once boil and freeze, which our uncle had told us was
possible, but only in India), perhaps he thought that Maidstone was
already as good as taken and it didn't matter what he said.  While
Oswald was debating within his intellect what to say next, and how
to say it so as to discover as many as possible of the enemy's dark
secrets, Noel said - </p>

<p>'How did you get here?  You weren't here yesterday at tea-time.'</p>

<p>The soldier gave the pot another sandy rub, and said - </p>

<p>'I daresay it does seem quick work - the camp seems as if it had
sprung up in the night, doesn't it? - like a mushroom.'</p>

<p>Alice and Oswald looked at each other, and then at the rest of us. 
The words 'sprung up in the night' seemed to touch a string in
every heart.</p>

<p>'You see,' whispered Noel, 'he won't tell us how he came here. 
NOW, is it humbug or history?'</p>

<p>Oswald, after whisperedly requesting his young brother to dry up
and not bother, remarked, 'Then you're an invading army?'</p>

<p>'Well,' said the soldier, 'we're a skeleton battalion, as a matter
of fact, but we're invading all right enough.'</p>

<p>And now indeed the blood of the stupidest of us froze, just as the
quick-witted Oswald's had done earlier in the interview.  Even H.
O. opened his mouth and went the colour of mottled soap; he is so
fat that this is the nearest he can go to turning pale.  Denny
said, 'But you don't look like skeletons.'</p>

<p>The soldier stared, then he laughed and said, 'Ah, that's the
padding in our tunics.  You should see us in the grey dawn taking
our morning bath in a bucket.'  It was a dreadful picture for the
imagination.  A skeleton, with its bones all loose most likely,
bathing anyhow in a pail.  There was a silence while we thought it
over.</p>

<p>Now, ever since the cleaning-cauldron soldier had said that about
taking Maidstone, Alice had kept on pulling at Oswald's jacket
behind, and he had kept on not taking any notice.  But now he could
not stand it any longer, so he said - </p>

<p>'Well, what is it?'</p>

<p>Alice drew him aside, or rather, she pulled at his jacket so that
he nearly fell over backwards, and then she whispered, 'Come along,
don't stay parlaying with the foe.  He's only talking to you to
gain time.'</p>

<p>'What for?' said Oswald.</p>

<p>'Why, so that we shouldn't warn the other army, you silly,' Alice
said, and Oswald was so upset by what she said, that he forgot to
be properly angry with her for the wrong word she used.</p>

<p>'But we ought to warn them at home,' she said - ' suppose the Moat
House was burned down, and all the supplies commandeered for the
foe?'</p>

<p>Alice turned boldly to the soldier.  'DO you burn down farms?' she
asked.</p>

<p>'Well, not as a rule,' he said, and he had the cheek to wink at
Oswald, but Oswald would not look at him.  'We've not burned a farm
since - oh, not for years.'</p>

<p>'A farm in Greek history it was, I expect,' Denny murmured. 
'Civilized warriors do not burn farms nowadays,' Alice said
sternly, 'whatever they did in Greek times.  You ought to know
that.'</p>

<p>The soldier said things had changed a good deal since Greek times.</p>

<p>So we said good morning as quickly as we could: it is proper to be
polite even to your enemy, except just at the moments when it has
really come to rifles and bayonets or other weapons.</p>

<p>The soldier said 'So long!' in quite a modern voice, and we
retraced our footsteps in silence to the ambush - I mean the wood. 
Oswald did think of lying in the ambush then, but it was rather
wet, because of the rain the night before, that H. O. said had
brought the army-seed up.  And Alice walked very fast, saying
nothing but 'Hurry up, can't you!' and dragging H. O. by one hand
and Noel by the other.  So we got into the road.</p>

<p>Then Alice faced round and said, 'This is all our fault.  If we
hadn't sowed those dragon's teeth there wouldn't have been any
invading army.'</p>

<p>I am sorry to say Daisy said, 'Never mind, Alice, dear.  WE didn't
sow the nasty things, did we, Dora?'</p>

<p>But Denny told her it was just the same.  It was WE had done it, so
long as it was any of us, especially if it got any of us into
trouble.  Oswald was very pleased to see that the Dentist was
beginning to understand the meaning of true manliness, and about
the honour of the house of Bastable, though of course he is only a
Foulkes.  Yet it is something to know he does his best to learn.</p>

<p>If you are very grown-up, or very clever, I daresay you will now
have thought of a great many things.  If you have you need not say
anything, especially if you're reading this aloud to anybody.  It's
no good putting in what you think in this part, because none of us
thought anything of the kind at the time.</p>

<p>We simply stood in the road without any of your clever thoughts,
filled with shame and distress to think of what might happen owing
to the dragon's teeth being sown.  It was a lesson to us never to
sow seed without being quite sure what sort it is.  This is
particularly true of the penny packets, which sometimes do not come
up at all, quite unlike dragon's teeth.</p>

<p>Of course H. O. and Noel were more unhappy than the rest of us. 
This was only fair.</p>

<p>'How can we possibly prevent their getting to Maidstone?' Dickie
said.  'Did you notice the red cuffs on their uniforms?  Taken from
the bodies of dead English soldiers, I shouldn't wonder.'</p>

<p>'If they're the old Greek kind of dragon's-teeth soldiers, they
ought to fight each other to death,' Noel said; 'at least, if we
had a helmet to throw among them.'</p>

<p>But none of us had, and it was decided that it would be of no use
for H. O. to go back and throw his straw hat at them, though he
wanted to.  Denny said suddenly - </p>

<p>'Couldn't we alter the sign-posts, so that they wouldn't know the
way to Maidstone?'</p>

<p>Oswald saw that this was the time for true generalship to be shown.</p>

<p>He said - </p>

<p>'Fetch all the tools out of your chest - Dicky go too, there's a
good chap, and don't let him cut his legs with the saw.'  He did
once, tumbling over it.  'Meet us at the cross-roads, you know,
where we had the Benevolent Bar.  Courage and dispatch, and look
sharp about it.'</p>

<p>When they had gone we hastened to the crossroads, and there a great
idea occurred to Oswald.  He used the forces at his command so ably
that in a very short time the board in the field which says 'No
thoroughfare.  Trespassers will be prosecuted' was set up in the
middle of the road to Maidstone.  We put stones, from a heap by the
road, behind it to make it stand up.</p>

<p>Then Dicky and Denny came back, and Dicky shinned up the sign-post
and sawed off the two arms, and we nailed them up wrong, so that it
said 'To Maidstone' on the Dover Road, and 'To Dover' on the road
to Maidstone.  We decided to leave the Trespassers board on the
real Maidstone road, as an extra guard.</p>

<p>Then we settled to start at once to warn Maidstone.</p>

<p>Some of us did not want the girls to go, but it would have been
unkind to say so.  However, there was at least one breast that felt
a pang of joy when Dora and Daisy gave out that they would rather
stay where they were and tell anybody who came by which was the
real road.</p>

<p>'Because it would be so dreadful if someone was going to buy pigs
or fetch a doctor or anything in a hurry and then found they had
got to Dover instead of where they wanted to go to,' Dora said. 
But when it came to dinner-time they went home, so that they were
entirely out of it.  This often happens to them by some strange
fatalism.</p>

<p>We left Martha to take care of the two girls, and Lady and Pincher
went with us.  It was getting late in the day, but I am bound to
remember no one said anything about their dinners, whatever they
may have thought.  We cannot always help our thoughts.  We happened
to know it was roast rabbits and currant jelly that day.</p>

<p>We walked two and two, and sang the 'British Grenadiers' and
'Soldiers of the queen' so as to be as much part of the British
Army as possible.  The Cauldron-Man had said the English were the
other side of the hill.  But we could not see any scarlet anywhere,
though we looked for it as carefully as if we had been fierce
bulls.</p>

<p>But suddenly we went round a turn in the road and came plump into
a lot of soldiers.  Only they were not red-coats.  They were
dressed in grey and silver.  And it was a sort of furzy-common
place, and three roads branching out.  The men were lying about,
with some of their belts undone, smoking pipes and cigarettes.</p>

<p>'It's not British soldiers,' Alice said.  'Oh dear, oh dear, I'm
afraid it's more enemy.  You didn't sow the army-seed anywhere
else, did you, H. O. dear?'</p>

<p>H. O. was positive he hadn't.  'But perhaps lots more came up where
we did sow them,' he said; 'they're all over England by now very
likely. <span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> don't know how many men can grow out of one dragon's
tooth.'</p>

<p>Then Noel said, 'It was my doing anyhow, and I'm not afraid,' and
he walked straight up to the nearest soldier, who was cleaning his
pipe with a piece of grass, and said - </p>

<p>'Please, are you the enemy?' The man said - </p>

<p>'No, young Commander-in-Chief, we're the English.'</p>

<p>Then Oswald took command.  'Where is the General?' he said.</p>

<p>'We're out of generals just now, Field-Marshal,' the man said, and
his voice was a gentleman's voice.  'Not a single one in stock.  We
might suit you in majors now  - and captains are quite cheap. 
Competent corporals going for a song.  And we have a very nice
colonel, too quiet to ride or drive.'</p>

<p>Oswald does not mind chaff at proper times.  But this was not one.</p>

<p>'You seem to be taking it very easy,' he said with disdainful
expression.</p>

<p>'This IS an easy,' said the grey soldier, sucking at his pipe to
see if it would draw.</p>

<p>'I suppose YOU don't care if the enemy gets into Maidstone or not!'
exclaimed Oswald bitterly.  'If I were a soldier I'd rather die
than be beaten.'</p>

<p>The soldier saluted.  'Good old patriotic sentiment' he said,
smiling at the heart-felt boy.</p>

<p>But Oswald could bear no more.  'Which is the Colonel?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Over there - near the grey horse.'</p>

<p>'The one lighting a cigarette?' H. O. asked.</p>

<p>'Yes - but I say, kiddie, he won't stand any jaw.  There's not an
ounce of vice about him, but he's peppery.  He might kick out. 
You'd better bunk.'</p>

<p>'Better what?' asked H. O.</p>

<p>'Bunk, bottle, scoot, skip, vanish, exit,' said the soldier.</p>

<p>'That's what you'd do when the fighting begins,' said H. O. He is
often rude like that - but it was what we all thought, all the same.</p>

<p>The soldier only laughed.</p>

<p>A spirited but hasty altercation among ourselves in whispers ended
in our allowing Alice to be the one to speak to the Colonel.  It
was she who wanted to.  'However peppery he is he won't kick a
girl,' she said, and perhaps this was true.</p>

<p>But of course we all went with her.  So there were six of us to
stand in front of the Colonel.  And as we went along we agreed that
we would salute him on the word three.  So when we got near, Dick
said, 'One, two, three', and we all saluted very well - except H.
O., who chose that minute to trip over a rifle a soldier had left
lying about, and was only saved from falling by a man in a cocked
hat who caught him deftly by the back of his jacket and stood him
on his legs.</p>

<p>'Let go, can't you,' said H. O. 'Are you the General?'</p>

<p>Before the Cocked Hat had time to frame a reply, Alice spoke to the
Colonel.  I knew what she meant to say, because she had told me as
we threaded our way among the resting soldiery.  What she really
said was - </p>

<p>'Oh, how CAN you!'</p>

<p>'How can I WHAT?' said the Colonel, rather crossly.</p>

<p>'Why, SMOKE?' said Alice.</p>

<p>'My good children, if you're an infant Band of Hope, let me
recommend you to play in some other backyard,' said the Cock-Hatted
Man.</p>

<p>H. O. said, 'Band of Hope yourself' - but no one noticed it.</p>

<p>'We're NOT a Band of Hope,' said Noel.  'We're British, and the man
over there told us you are.  And Maidstone's in danger, and the
enemy not a mile off, and you stand SMOKING.'  Noel was standing
crying, himself, or something very like it.</p>

<p>'It's quite true,' Alice said.</p>

<p>The Colonel said, 'Fiddle-de-dee.'</p>

<p>But the Cocked-Hatted Man said, 'What was the enemy like?'
We told him exactly.  And even the Colonel then owned there might
be something in it.</p>

<p>'Can you show me the place where they are on the map?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Not on the map, we can't,' said Dicky - 'at least, I don't think
so, but on the ground we could.  We could take you there in a
quarter of an hour.'</p>

<p>The Cocked-Hatted One looked at the Colonel, who returned his
scrutiny, then he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>'Well, we've got to do something,' he said, as if to himself. 
'Lead on, Macduff.'</p>

<p>The Colonel roused his soldiery from their stupor of pipes by words
of command which the present author is sorry he can't remember.</p>

<p>Then he bade us boys lead the way.  I tell you it felt fine,
marching at the head of a regiment.  Alice got a lift on the
Cocked-Hatted One's horse.  It was a red-roan steed of might,
exactly as if it had been in a ballad.  They call a grey-roan a
'blue' in South Africa, the Cocked-Hatted One said.</p>

<p>We led the British Army by unfrequented lanes till we got to the
gate of Sugden's Waste Wake pasture.  Then the Colonel called a
whispered halt, and choosing two of us to guide him, the dauntless
and discerning commander went on, on foot, with an orderly.  He
chose Dicky and Oswald as guides.  So we led him to the ambush, and
we went through it as quietly as we could.  But twigs do crackle
and snap so when you are reconnoitring, or anxious to escape
detection for whatever reason.</p>

<p>Our Colonel's orderly crackled most.  If you're not near enough to
tell a colonel by the crown and stars on his shoulder-strap, you
can tell him by the orderly behind him, like 'follow my leader'.</p>

<p>'Look out!' said Oswald in a low but commanding whisper, 'the
camp's down in that field.  You can see if you take a squint
through this gap.'</p>

<p>The speaker took a squint himself as he spoke, and drew back,
baffled beyond the power of speech.  While he was struggling with
his baffledness the British Colonel had his squint.  He also drew
back, and said a word that he must have known was not right - at
least when he was a boy.</p>

<p>'I don't care,' said Oswald, 'they were there this morning.  White
tents like mushrooms, and an enemy cleaning a cauldron.'</p>

<p>'With sand,' said Dicky.</p>

<p>'That's most convincing,' said the Colonel, and I did not like the
way he said it.</p>

<p>'I say,' Oswald said, 'let's get to the top corner of the
ambush - the wood, I mean.  You can see the crossroads from there.'</p>

<p>We did, and quickly, for the crackling of branches no longer
dismayed our almost despairing spirits.</p>

<p>We came to the edge of the wood, and Oswald's patriotic heart
really did give a jump, and he cried, 'There they are, on the Dover
Road.'</p>

<p>Our miscellaneous signboard had done its work.</p>

<p>'By Jove, young un, you're right!  And in quarter column, too!
We've got em on toast - on toast - egad!' I never heard anyone not in
a book say 'egad' before, so I saw something really out of the way
was indeed up.</p>

<p>The Colonel was a man of prompt and decisive action.  He sent the
orderly to tell the Major to advance two companies on the left
flank and take cover.  Then we led him back through the wood the
nearest way, because he said he must rejoin the main body at once. 
We found the main body very friendly with Noel and H. O. and the
others, and Alice was talking to the Cocked-Hatted One as if she
had known him all her life.</p>

<p>'I think he's a general in disguise,' Noel said.  'He's been giving
us chocolate out of a pocket in his saddle.'</p>

<p>Oswald thought about the roast rabbit then - and he is not ashamed
to own it - yet he did not say a word.  But Alice is really not a
bad sort.  She had saved two bars of chocolate for him and Dicky. 
Even in war girls can sometimes be useful in their humble way.</p>

<p>The Colonel fussed about and said, 'Take cover there!' and
everybody hid in the ditch, and the horses and the Cocked Hat, with
Alice, retreated down the road out of sight.  We were in the ditch
too.  It was muddy - but nobody thought of their boots in that
perilous moment.  It seemed a long time we were crouching there. 
Oswald began to feel the water squelching in his boots, so we held
our breath and listened.  Oswald laid his ear to the road like a
Red Indian.  You would not do this in time of peace, but when your
country is in danger you care but little about keeping your ears
clean.  His backwoods' strategy was successful.  He rose and dusted
himself and said - 
'They're coming!'</p>

<p>It was true.  The footsteps of the approaching foe were now to be
heard quite audibly, even by ears in their natural position.  The
wicked enemy approached.  They were marching with a careless
swaggeringness that showed how little they suspected the horrible
doom which was about to teach them England's might and supremeness.</p>

<p>Just as the enemy turned the corner so that we could see them, the
Colonel shouted - 
'Right section, fire!' and there was a deafening banging.</p>

<p>The enemy's officer said something, and then the enemy got confused
and tried to get into the fields through the hedges.  But all was
vain.  There was firing now from our men, on the left as well as
the right.  And then our Colonel strode nobly up to the enemy's
Colonel and demanded surrender.  He told me so afterwards.  His
exact words are only known to himself and the other Colonel.  But
the enemy's Colonel said, 'I would rather die than surrender,' or
words to that effect.</p>

<p>Our Colonel returned to his men and gave the order to fix bayonets,
and even Oswald felt his manly cheek turn pale at the thought of
the amount of blood to be shed.  What would have happened can never
now be revealed.  For at this moment a man on a piebald horse came
clattering over a hedge - as carelessly as if the air was not full
of lead and steel at all.  Another man rode behind him with a lance
and a red pennon on it.  I think he must have been the enemy's
General coming to tell his men not to throw away their lives on a
forlorn hope, for directly he said they were captured the enemy
gave in and owned that they were.  The enemy's Colonel saluted and
ordered his men to form quarter column again.  I should have
thought he would have had about enough of that myself.</p>

<p>He had now given up all thought of sullen resistance to the bitter
end.  He rolled a cigarette for himself, and had the foreign cheek
to say to our Colonel - </p>

<p>'By Jove, old man, you got me clean that time!  Your scouts seem to
have marked us down uncommonly neatly.'</p>

<p>It was a proud moment when our Colonel laid his military hand on
Oswald's shoulder and said - </p>

<p>'This is my chief scout' which were high words, but not undeserved,
and Oswald owns he felt red with gratifying pride when he heard
them.</p>

<p>'So you are the traitor, young man,' said the wicked Colonel, going
on with his cheek.</p>

<p>Oswald bore it because our Colonel had, and you should be generous
to a fallen foe, but it is hard to be called a traitor when you
haven't.</p>

<p>He did not treat the wicked Colonel with silent scorn as he might
have done, but he said - </p>

<p>'We aren't traitors.  We are the Bastables and one of us is a
Foulkes.  We only mingled unsuspected with the enemy's soldiery and
learned the secrets of their acts, which is what Baden-Powell
always does when the natives rebel in South Africa; and Denis
Foulkes thought of altering the sign-posts to lead the foe astray. 
And if we did cause all this fighting, and get Maidstone threatened
with capture and all that, it was only because we didn't believe
Greek things could happen in Great Britain and Ireland, even if you
sow dragon's teeth, and besides, some of us were not as e a out
sowing them.'</p>

<p>Then the Cocked-Hatted One led his horse and walked with us and
made us tell him all about it, and so did the Colonel.  The wicked
Colonel listened too, which was only another proof of his cheek.</p>

<p>And Oswald told the tale in the modest yet manly way that some
people think he has, and gave the others all the credit they
deserved.  His narration was interrupted no less than four times by
shouts of 'Bravo!' in which the enemy's Colonel once more showed
his cheek by joining.  By the time the story was told we were in
sight of another camp.  It was the British one this time.  The
Colonel asked us to have tea in his tent, and it only shows the
magnanimosity of English chivalry in the field of battle that he
asked the enemy's Colonel too.  With his usual cheek he accepted. 
We were jolly hungry.</p>

<p>When everyone had had as much tea as they possibly could, the
Colonel shook hands with us all, and to Oswald he said - </p>

<p>'Well, good-bye, my brave scout.  I must mention your name in my
dispatches to the War Office.'</p>

<p>H. O. interrupted him to say, 'His name's Oswald Cecil Bastable,
and mine is Horace Octavius.'  I wish H. O. would learn to hold his
tongue.  No one ever knows Oswald was christened Cecil as well, if
he can possibly help it.  YOU didn't know it till now.</p>

<p>'Mr Oswald Bastable,' the Colonel went on - he had the decency not
to take any notice of the 'Cecil' -'you would be a credit to any
regiment.  No doubt the War Office will reward you properly for
what you have done for your country.  But meantime, perhaps, you'll
accept five shillings from a grateful comrade-in-arms.'  Oswald
felt heart-felt sorry to wound the good Colonel's feelings, but he
had to remark that he had only done his duty, and he was sure no
British scout would take five bob for doing that.  'And besides,'
he said, with that feeling of justice which is part of his young
character, 'it was the others just as much as me.'</p>

<p>'Your sentiments, Sir,' said the Colonel who was one of the
politest and most discerning colonels I ever saw, 'your sentiments
do you honour.  But, Bastables all, and - and non-Bastables' (he
couldn't remember Foulkes; it's not such an interesting name as
Bastable, of course) -'at least you'll accept a soldier's pay?'</p>

<p>'Lucky to touch it, a shilling a day!' Alice and Denny said
together.  And the Cocked-Hatted Man said something about knowing
your own mind and knowing your own Kipling.</p>

<p>'A soldier,' said the Colonel, 'would certainly be lucky to touch
it.  You see there are deductions for rations.  Five shillings is
exactly right, deducting twopence each for six teas.'</p>

<p>This seemed cheap for the three cups of tea and the three eggs and
all the strawberry jam and bread-and-butter Oswald had had, as well
as what the others ate, and Lady's and Pincher's teas, but I
suppose soldiers get things cheaper than civilians, which is only
right.</p>

<p>Oswald took the five shillings then, there being no longer any
scruples why he should not.</p>

<p>Just as we had parted from the brave Colonel and the rest we saw a
bicycle coming.  It was Albert's uncle.  He got off and said - </p>

<p>'What on earth have you been up to?  What were you doing with those
volunteers?'</p>

<p>We told him the wild adventures of the day, and he listened, and
then he said he would withdraw the word volunteers if we liked.</p>

<p>But the seeds of doubt were sown in the breast of Oswald.  He was
now almost sure that we had made jolly fools of ourselves without
a moment's pause throughout the whole of this eventful day.  He
said nothing at the time, but after supper he had it out with
Albert's uncle about the word which had been withdrawn.</p>

<p>Albert's uncle said, of course, no one could be sure that the
dragon's teeth hadn't come up in the good old-fashioned way, but
that, on the other hand, it was barely possible that both the
British and the enemy were only volunteers having a field-day or
sham fight, and he rather thought the Cocked-Hatted Man was not a
general, but a doctor.  And the man with a red pennon carried
behind him MIGHT have been the umpire.</p>

<p>Oswald never told the others a word of this.  Their young breasts
were all panting with joy because they had saved their country; and
it would have been but heartless unkindness to show them how silly
they had been.  Besides, Oswald felt he was much too old to have
been so taken in - if he HAD been.  Besides, Albert's uncle did say
that no one could be sure about the dragon's teeth.</p>

<p>The thing that makes Oswald feel most that, perhaps, the whole
thing was a beastly sell, was that we didn't see any wounded.  But
he tries not to think of this.  And if he goes into the army when
he grows up, he will not go quite green.  He has had experience of
the arts of war and the tented field.  And a real colonel has
called him 'Comrade-in-Arms', which is exactly what Lord Roberts
called his own soldiers when he wrote home about them.</p>
