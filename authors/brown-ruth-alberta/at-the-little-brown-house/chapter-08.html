<p>"Merry Christmas, Gail, Faith, Hope, Charity, Allee! Merry Christmas,
everyone! My stocking has <em>something</em> in it, I can see
from here. Wake up! Wake up! I want to look at my presents!"</p>

<p>A drop of something hot struck the tip of Gail's nose, and she
opened her sleepy eyes to find a white-robed, shivering figure
shaking her vigorously with one hand, while in the other was a
tiny, flickering candle, which dribbled hot wax prodigally as
it was tipped about with reckless abandon by the excited pleader.</p>

<p>"What are you doing with that lighted candle?" demanded Gail,
digging the wax off her nose and dodging another drop. "Put it
out before you set the house on fire. It isn't morning yet. It
can't be! I have hardly slept at all."</p>

<p>"The clock struck a long time ago," insisted Peace with chattering
teeth, "and I counted much as five."</p>

<p>"Five o'clock!" protested Gail. "Oh, surely not! Well, if it
is that time, I suppose you can get up. Seems awfully quiet for
that hour, though." The older sister began the process of dressing,
and in a few moments all six girls were gathered around the roaring
fire in the kitchen, excitedly examining the contents of their
stockings, which Gail had painstakingly filled with homemade gifts
and a little cheap candy from the village store,&mdash;her one Christmas
extravagance.</p>

<p>"Mittens!" cried Peace, investigating the first package her excited
hand drew forth. "You knit them, didn't you, Gail? I saw Mrs.
Grinnell teaching you how. Mine are red. Have you got some, Cherry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, blue; and Allee's are pink. Aren't they pretty?"</p>

<p>"Just see my lovely knit slippers," cried Hope, throwing her
arms about Gail's neck and hugging her with a vim. "Where did
you get all the yarn, sister?"</p>

<p>"I found a lot in the attic," replied the oldest girl, smiling
happily at the children's appreciation of her labor; but she did
not explain that a gorgeous, moth-eaten, old afghan had been raveled
to provide all those pretty things.</p>

<p>"What is in your stocking, Faith?"</p>

<p>The girl held up a dainty white waist, but said never a word,
for she recognized that Gail's patient fingers had re-fashioned
for her one of the dear mother's hoarded treasures, and her heart
was too full for utterance.</p>

<p>"I've got some handkerchiefs," called Peace again, "and a ribbon&mdash;if
I only had some hair to tie with it! It's too wide for a band,
and that's all I can wear&mdash;here's an apple, a penwiper and some
candy. You've got pretty nearly the same c'lection, haven't you,
Cherry, and so have Hope and Allee. I wonder how Mrs. Grinnell
happened to give me a hair-ribbon when she knows that my hair
ain't long enough to tie back."</p>

<p>"How do you know Mrs. Grinnell gave it to you?" demanded Gail,
too astonished to reprove her.</p>

<p>"I was in there one day when she had been to Martindale, and
the ribbons happened to be on the table all unwrapped. This was
one of them. Now, Gail, see what Santa Claus has brought you.
There's at least one thing, 'cause&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cherry clapped her hand over her younger sister's mouth, and
began to giggle. So did Gail, when she drew forth from her stocking
a bulky potato pig with toothpicks for legs, match-heads for eyes
and a dry woodbine tendril for a tail.</p>

<p>"Who in the world made that?" she laughed, tears close to the
surface, for she had expected nothing this Christmas day.</p>

<p>"Mr. Strong," gulped Peace, dancing with delight at her sister's
evident surprise. "Look at his back! We put a saddle on the old
porker. Isn't that cute? It's a spandy new dollar with this year's
date on it. See?"</p>

<p>Gail turned the curious animal over, and sure enough, there was
a bright, shining Goddess of Liberty, skilfully sunk in the pig's
potato back.</p>

<p>Swallowing back the lump in her throat, which threatened to choke
her, Gail whispered, "Where did you get it, dear? The money, I
mean."</p>

<p>"We took up a c'lection," was the startling answer.</p>

<p>"A collection!" echoed Gail.</p>

<p>"Yes. You know last Sunday was Home Mission day, and the money
was to be sent to poor ministers' families on the pioneer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean frontier," corrected Hope.</p>

<p>"Well, whatever ear it was," continued Peace, serenely; "and
that made me wonder why folks never took up c'lections for poor
ministers' families right here among them. I asked Mr. Strong
about it, and he said we would take up another c'lection straight
away, and buy a Christmas present for a 'hero minister's hero
mother-daughter.' He made me learn those words; and we got a dollar
in ten cent pieces without half trying. I 'spect we could have
raised a fortune if we'd had more time, but this was on our way
home from school yesterday. We couldn't find anything pretty enough
to buy here at the village, and it was too late to go to Martindale
for it, so we changed the dimes into a dollar and put it in the
potato pig. He said it ought to be a shining white angel, but
I told him right away that we had angels enough in this family
already, and he better make a horse. That is what he tried to
do, but it looked so much like a pig when he got done that I pulled
off the string tail and mane and put on a pig's tail, and he said
it did look better. You are to use the money for your very own
self and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The clock began to strike. One&mdash;two &mdash;That was all.</p>

<p>"Mercy me!" ejaculated Peace, staring at the accusing faces of
her sisters. "I truly did hear that clock strike as much as five
a long time ago."</p>

<p>"No doubt you did," laughed sunny Hope. "It struck midnight and
you woke up in the middle of the count."</p>

<p>"Let's go back to bed," suggested Gail, anxious to be alone with
her tumultuous thoughts; and to her surprise no dissenting voice
was raised, although as she crept once more beneath the covers
of her cot, she heard Peace say decidedly, "I sha'n't take off
<em>my</em> clothes again. Once a day is enough for any <em>huming</em>
being to dress. Do you s'pose Santa will come again while we sleep?"</p>

<p>It was daylight before they woke from their second nap, and as
Peace flew out of bed once more, she cried in delight, "Oh, it's
snowing again! Now it will seem like Christmas sure! Let's clean
off the walks before breakfast. Gail won't let us eat our candy
yet."</p>

<p>She made short work of her toilette, threw on her wraps and was
out of doors almost before Cherry had opened her eyes; but the
next moment she came stumbling back into the house with the wild
yell "Girls, girls, Santa Claus did come again, and left a tre-men-jus
big mince pie on the porch &mdash;I picked a teenty hole in the
top to see for sure if 'twas mincemeat&mdash;and a bundle of something
else. Hurry up, I can't wait to open it! Oh, the paper fell off,
and it's shoes&mdash;tennis slippers in the winter! Think of it! That
is worse than Mrs. Grinnell's hair-ribbon, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Peace!" cried Gail in shocked tones, entering the kitchen with
the rest of the family at her heels. "You should be <em>grateful</em>
for the presents people give you and not poke fun at them."</p>

<p>"I am grateful, Gail, truly. I ain't poking fun at them, honest,
though they <em>are</em> funny presents for this time of the year.
I s'pose, maybe, my hair will get long enough for a ribbon sometime,
though Mrs. Strong says it is too curly to grow fast. And when
summer comes, we can wear these slippers, if they aren't too small.
They look awful little already. These are marked for Allee, and
here are mine, and those are Cherry's. There aren't any for the
rest of you. I s'pose the pie is for you. You're lucky. I would
rather have the pie than the shoes."</p>

<p>"Oh, Peace!"</p>

<p>"Well, wouldn't you? There is someone at the front door."</p>

<p>Gail disappeared through the hall to answer the knock, and Peace,
with her new shoes in her hand, slipped out of the kitchen door.
"Just as I thought," she muttered to herself. "Mr. Hardman brought
them over. He thinks they will make up for that money he never
paid us last summer, but they won't. He can just have his old
shoes right back again!"</p>

<p>Out to the barn she marched, hunted up a scrap of paper and a
pencil left there for just such emergencies, laboriously scribbled
a note, which she tied to the slippers, and deposited the bundle
on the Hartman steps, where he found it when he came out to sweep
paths. "Well, I swan," he exclaimed, half in anger, half amused,
as he picked tip the rejected shoes, "if she hasn't trotted them
slippers back! Peace, of course. Let's see what she says." Carefully
he untied the little slip and read:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Here are your shoes. Im greatful but this is the rong seesun for<br/>
them. By summer they will be to small as they aint very big now. Ive<br/>
got over wanting tenis shoes anyhow. The muny you owe us would have<br/>
come in handier. Peace Greenfield."

</p>
</div>
<p>He tucked the note in his pocket, dropped the shoes on the kitchen
mantle, and went chuckling about his morning work. Hardly had
he finished his numerous tasks, when he was surprised to see Peace
coming slowly up the path, with eyes down-cast and face an uncomfortable
red. She knocked lightly, as if hoping no one would hear, and
looked disappointed when he opened the door.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas, Peace. Come in, come right in," he said cordially,
his eyes gleaming with, amusement. "What can I do for you this
morning?"</p>

<p>"Give me back the shoes I left on your porch," she answered,
in tones so low he could hardly hear. "Gail said I must come over
and get them and ipologize for being so rude. She says it is very
rude to return Christmas presents like that. If you meant them
for a present, why, that's different; but I thought likely it
was our pay for picking strawberries last summer. Now, which was
it, a present or our pay?" The old, independent, confident spirit
asserted itself once more in the little breast, and Peace raised
her eyes to his with disconcerting frankness.</p>

<p>"Well, well," stammered the man, hardly knowing what to say.
"Suppose they are a Christmas present, will you accept and wear
'em?"</p>

<p>"When it comes summer time, if I haven't outgrown them. My feet
are getting big fast."</p>

<p>"But if they are in pay for the strawberry picking, you won't
take them? Is that it?"</p>

<p>"I s'pose I will have to take them after Gail's lecture," Peace
sighed dismally, "but I'll never put 'em on&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>Delighted with her candor and rebel spirit, he said, after a
brief pause, "Well, now, I mean them for a Christmas present,
Peace, and I'd like mighty well for you to wear them. If they
are too small, come next summer, I will get them changed for you.
Will you take them?"</p>

<p>"<em>Y&mdash;</em>e&mdash;s."</p>

<p>"And be friends?"</p>

<p>Peace hesitated. "Friends are square with each other, ain't they?"</p>

<p>"I reckon they are."</p>

<p>"Then I don't see how we can be friends," she said firmly.</p>

<p>"Why not?" His face was blank with surprise; and his wife, who
had been a silent spectator of the scene, laughed outright.</p>

<p>"'Cause you owe us a dollar and a half for picking strawberries
last summer, and if you don't pay it, you ain't square with us,
are you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I swan!" he mumbled. Then he, too, laughed, and thrusting
his hand into his pocket, drew out a handful of silver. "Here
are six silver quarters, a dollar and fifty cents. That settles
our account, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And I've treated you on the square?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you will come sit on my lap?"</p>

<p>"I don't s'pose it will do any hurt," she answered grudgingly,
for she had not yet adjusted herself to this new friendship with
her one-time enemy, but she went to him slowly and permitted to
lift her to his knee.</p>

<p>"There, now," he said, settling her comfortably. "That's more
like it! Now that I have settled my account with you, tell me
what you are going to do about the money you owe me?"</p>

<p>"Dave!" interposed little Mrs. Hartman, but he laughingly waved
her aside.</p>

<p>"What money that I owe you?" gasped poor Peace, the rosy color
dying from her face.</p>

<p>"Didn't you dump twenty boxes of my strawberries into the chicken
yard last summer?"</p>

<p>"<em>Y&mdash;</em>e&mdash;s."</p>

<p>"Those berries sold for twenty cents a box. Twenty times twenty
is four dollars. You spoiled four dollars' worth of berries, Peace
Greenfield. Are you being square with me?"</p>

<p>The child sat dumb with despair, and seeing the tragedy in the
great, brown eyes, Mrs. Hartman again said, remonstratingly, "Dave!"</p>

<p>"Hush, Myra Ann," he commanded. "This is between Peace and me.
If we are to be friends, we must be square with each other, you
know."</p>

<p>There was a desperate struggle, and then Peace laid the shining
quarters back in his hand, saying bravely, "Here's my first payment.
I haven't the rest now, but if you will wait until I earn it,
I'll pay it all back. I will have Hope figure up just how much
I owe you, so's I will know for sure. Can you wait? Maybe you
will let me pick strawberries next summer until I get it paid
up. Will you? 'Cause what money I get this winter I'd like to
give to Gail for a coat. She has to wear Faith's jacket now whenever
she goes anywhere, and, of course, two people can't wear one coat
at the same time."</p>

<p>"No, they can't," he answered soberly, with a suspicion of a
tremble in his voice. "Is that what you meant to do with this
money?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Gail got a dollar for Christmas, and I thought this would
'most make enough to buy a good coat for her. She needs one dreadfully."</p>

<p>Mr. Hartman slipped the money into the grimy fist again, cleared
his throat and then said, "Now, I've got a plan. You keep this
dollar and fifty cents for your work last summer, and when the
strawberries are ripe again, we'll see about your picking some
more to pay for the spoiled ones. Is that all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes," cried Peace, giving a delighted little jump. "You aren't
near bad, are you?"</p>

<p>"I hope not," he replied with a queer laugh. "Can you give me
a kiss, do you suppose?"</p>

<p>"If you will skin me a rabbit," she answered promptly.</p>

<p>"If I'll what?" he yelled in amazement, almost dropping her from
his lap.</p>

<p>"Skin me a rabbit. Winkum and Blinkum are starving to death &mdash;Faith
says so&mdash;and they really don't seem as fat as when Bryan gave
them to me; so if we can save them by eating them up, we better
do it. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Well, now, that might be a good idea," he answered slowly, for
he regarded rabbits as a nuisance, and was not anxious to see
any such pests in his neighborhood. "Stewed rabbit makes a pretty
good dish, too."</p>

<p>"That's what I had heard. Will you skin them for me?"</p>

<p>"Yep, any time you say so."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll get them now and we will have them for dinner."</p>

<p>She was off like a flash before he could say another word, returning
almost immediately with the squirming rabbits in her apron, and
he dressed them carefully. By the time the long process was finished
her face was very sober, and she offered no objections when he
claimed two kisses instead of one as his reward, but gathering
up the hapless bunnies, she departed for home.</p>

<p>"Here's our Christmas dinner, Gail," she announced, dumping her
burden onto the cluttered kitchen table. "I wish it had been chicken,
but Mr. Hartman says stewed rabbit is real good."</p>

<p>"Where did you get these?" demanded Gail, surmising the truth.</p>

<p>"They are Winkum and Blinkum. Mr. Hartman undressed them for
me. I got my shoes back, and here's the strawberry money for your
new coat, Gail." As clearly as possible she made her explanations,
and went away to put up the tennis slippers, leaving dismayed
Gail to face the unique situation.</p>

<p>"What can I do?" she cried, almost in tears.</p>

<p>"Get yourself a new coat, if you can find one for the price,"
answered Faith, listlessly scrubbing a panful of turnips for dinner.</p>

<p>"I don't mean the coat. I had scarcely thought of the money.
I mean the rabbits."</p>

<p>"Cook them! People eat rabbits."</p>

<p>"But these were pets."</p>

<p>"They are dead now. You might as well use them as to throw them
away. We have no turkey or chicken for dinner."</p>

<p>Gail shivered, but obediently cut up the rabbits and put them
on the stove to cook, mentally resolving not to eat a bite of
them herself.</p>

<p>The morning hours flew rapidly by, the dinner was done at last,
and the hungry girls were scrambling into their chairs when Faith
cried sharply, "Hope, you have set seven plates!"</p>

<p>Instinctively each heart thought of the absent member, gone from
them since the last Christmas Day, and Gail reached over to remove
the extra dishes, when Hope stopped her by saying, "Teacher read
us a beautiful poem of how some people always set a place for
the Christ Child on His birthday, hoping that He would come in
person to celebrate the day with them, and I thought it was such
a pretty idea that&mdash;I &mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," said Gail gently. "We will leave the extra plate
there."</p>

<p>"It does seem queer, doesn't it, that we have big dinners on
Christmas Day 'cause it is Christ's birthday, and then we never
give Him a dish," observed Peace, passing her plate for a helping.</p>

<p>"Did the Christ Child come?" asked Allee eagerly. "In the story,
I mean."</p>

<p>"Not in the way they looked for Him," answered Hope. "But a little
beggar child came. Some of the family were going to send it out
into the kitchen to eat with the servants, but one little boy
insisted that it should have the empty chair they had set for
the Christ Child. So the ragged beggar was pushed up to the table
and fed all he wanted. When the dinner was over, a great shining
light filled the room and Christ appeared to tell them that in
feeding the little beggar they had entertained Him. It was all
written out in rhyme and was <em>so</em> pretty. What is the matter,
Gail? You aren't eating anything."</p>

<p>The other sisters paused to look at the older girl's plate, and
Gail's sensitive face flushed crimson, but before she could offer
any explanation, Peace abruptly dropped her knife and fork, pushed
her dishes from her, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Why, what ails you, child?" cried Faith, who herself had scarcely
touched the dinner before her.</p>

<p>"I can't be a <em>carnival</em> and eat my bunnies," sobbed Peace.
"I'd as soon have a slab of kitten."</p>

<p>"That's just the way I feel," said Cherry, and no one laughed
at Peace's rendering of <em>cannibal</em>.</p>

<p>In the midst of this scene there was a knock at the kitchen door,
but before anyone could answer, Mrs. Grinnell rustled in, bearing
in her arms a huge platter of roast turkey, which she set down
upon the table with the remark, "It was that lonesome at home
I just couldn't eat my dinner all by myself, so I brought it over
to see if you didn't want me for company."</p>

<p>"You aren't a ragged beggar," Peace spoke up through her tears,
before the others had recovered from their surprise; "but I guess
you'll do. You can have the chair we set for Jesus."</p>

<p>Gail explained, while the platter of stewed rabbit was being
removed, and once more dinner was begun. The turkey was done to
a turn, the dressing was flavored just right and filled with walnuts
and oysters, the vegetables had never tasted better, the biscuits
were as light as a feather, Mrs. Strong's cranberry sauce had
jelled perfectly, and the Hartman mince-pie was a miracle of pastry.
The seven diners did the meal full justice, and when at last the
appetites were satisfied, the table looked as if a foraging party
had descended upon it.</p>

<p>"That was quite a dinner," remarked Peace, as she pushed her
chair back from the table. "If I had just known it was going to
happen, Mr. Hartman needn't have skinned the rabbits. There is
a whole platter full of Winkum and Blinkum left, and it's all
wasted. Mercy me, what a shame!"</p>

<p>She went out into the kitchen and surveyed the rejected delicacy
with mournful eyes. Then a new idea occurred to her, and, with
no thought of irreverence, she murmured to herself, "I don't believe
the Christ Child would have cared whether He had turkey or rabbit
for dinner. I'm going over and get that <em>passle</em> of half-starved
German kids to eat this up."</p>

<p>Throwing Gail's faded shawl over her head, she ran across the
snowy fields to the old tumble-down house on the next road, where
the new family lived. The children were at play in the yard&mdash;seven
in all, and none of them larger than Hope&mdash;but at sight of her
they came forward hand in hand, jabbering such queer gibberish
that Peace could not understand a word.</p>

<p>"Come over to my house and have some dinner," she invited them,
but not one of them moved a step. "We've got a whole platter of
stewed rabbit," she urged, but they only stared uncomprehendingly.
"Perhaps you have had your dinner. Are you hungry?"</p>

<p>"Hungry," suddenly said the oldest boy, putting one hand to his
mouth and the other on his stomach. "Ja, sehr hungrig."</p>

<p>Peace was delighted with the pantomime method of making herself
understood, and imitating his motions, she pointed to the little
brown house and beckoned.</p>

<p>"Ja, ja," cried the chorus of seven, their faces beaming with
pleasure, "wir kommen." And they quickly followed her across the
snow to the kitchen door.</p>

<p>"Gail, I have brought the Christ Child," she announced, as she
ushered the ragged, hungry brood into the house. "I thought it
was a pity to waste all that salt and pepper you used in fixing
up Winkum and Blinkum, so I invited these ragged beggars over
to eat it up."</p>

<p>Mrs. Grinnell gasped her surprise and consternation. Faith exclaimed
angrily, "Peace Greenfield!" But Gail, with never a chiding word,
sprang to the table and began clearing away the soiled dishes,
while Hope ran for clean plates; and in short order the seven
little towheads were hovering around the platter of stewed rabbit
and creamed potatoes, revelling in a feast such as they had never
known before; nor did they stop eating until every scrap of food
had vanished. Then they rose, bowing and smiling, and trying in
their own tongue to thank their hostesses for the grand dinner.</p>

<p>Peace was captivated with their quaint manners and reverent attitude,
and when they had backed out of the door, she went with them to
the gate, kissing her hand to them as they disappeared down the
road, still calling over their shoulders, "Du bist das Christkind!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what they are saying," she murmured, "but it makes
me feel like flapping my wings and crowing." She leaped to her
tall gatepost to give vent to her jubilant feelings, but tumbled
quickly to the ground again without stopping to crow. "Abigail
Greenfield!" she shouted, racing for the house. "See what was
on the gatepost,&mdash;a nenvelope with money in it, and on the outside
it says, 'Christmas greetings to the Six Sisters.' Now will you
believe someone lost it? It ain't Mr. Strong's writing, though.
Maybe the Christ Child brought it. Oh, Gail, do you s'pose He
did?"</p>
