<p>For two years, Lingard, who had thrown himself body and soul
into the great enterprise, had lived in the long intoxication
of slowly preparing success. No thought of failure had crossed
his mind, and no price appeared too heavy to pay for such a magnificent
achievement. It was nothing less than bringing Hassim triumphantly
back to that country seen once at night under the low clouds and
in the incessant tumult of thunder. When at the conclusion of
some long talk with Hassim, who for the twentieth time perhaps
had related the story of his wrongs and his struggle, he lifted
his big arm and shaking his fist above his head, shouted: "We
will stir them up. We will wake up the country!" he was, without
knowing it in the least, making a complete confession of the idealism
hidden under the simplicity of his strength. He would wake up
the country! That was the fundamental and unconscious emotion
on which were engrafted his need of action, the primitive sense
of what was due to justice, to gratitude, to friendship, the sentimental
pity for the hard lot of Immada&mdash;poor child&mdash;the proud conviction
that of all the men in the world, in his world, he alone had the
means and the pluck "to lift up the big end" of such an adventure.</p>

<p>Money was wanted and men were wanted, and he had obtained enough
of both in two years from that day when, pistols in his belt and
a cabbage-leaf hat on head, he had unexpectedly, and at early
dawn, confronted in perfect silence that mysterious Belarab, who
himself was for a moment too astounded for speech at the sight
of a white face.</p>

<p>The sun had not yet cleared the forests of the interior, but
a sky already full of light arched over a dark oval lagoon, over
wide fields as yet full of shadows, that seemed slowly changing
into the whiteness of the morning mist. There were huts, fences,
palisades, big houses that, erected on lofty piles, were seen
above the tops of clustered fruit trees, as if suspended in the
air.</p>

<p>Such was the aspect of Belarab's settlement when Lingard set
his eyes on it for the first time. There were all these things,
a great number of faces at the back of the spare and muffled-up
figure confronting him, and in the swiftly increasing light a
complete stillness that made the murmur of the word "Marhaba"
(welcome), pronounced at last by the chief, perfectly audible
to every one of his followers. The bodyguards who stood about
him in black skull-caps and with long-shafted lances, preserved
an impassive aspect. Across open spaces men could be seen running
to the waterside. A group of women standing on a low knoll gazed
intently, and nothing of them but the heads showed above the unstirring
stalks of a maize field. Suddenly within a cluster of empty huts
near by the voice of an invisible hag was heard scolding with
shrill fury an invisible young girl:</p>

<p>"Strangers! You want to see the strangers? O devoid of all decency!
Must I so lame and old husk the rice alone? May evil befall thee
and the strangers! May they never find favour! May they be pursued
with swords! I am old. I am old. There is no good in strangers!
O girl! May they burn."</p>

<p>"Welcome," repeated Belarab, gravely, and looking straight into
Lingard's eyes.</p>

<p>Lingard spent six days that time in Belarab's settlement. Of
these, three were passed in observing each other without a question
being asked or a hint given as to the object in view. Lingard
lounged on the fine mats with which the chief had furnished a
small bamboo house outside a fortified enclosure, where a white
flag with a green border fluttered on a high and slender pole
but still below the walls of long, high-roofed buildings, raised
forty feet or more on hard-wood posts.</p>

<p>Far away the inland forests were tinted a shimmering blue, like
the forests of a dream. On the seaward side the belt of great
trunks and matted undergrowth came to the western shore of the
oval lagoon; and in the pure freshness of the air the groups of
brown houses reflected in the water or seen above the waving green
of the fields, the clumps of palm trees, the fenced-in plantations,
the groves of fruit trees, made up a picture of sumptuous prosperity.</p>

<p>Above the buildings, the men, the women, the still sheet of water
and the great plain of crops glistening with dew, stretched the
exalted, the miraculous peace of a cloudless sky. And no road
seemed to lead into this country of splendour and stillness. One
could not believe the unquiet sea was so near, with its gifts
and its unending menace. Even during the months of storms, the
great clamour rising from the whitened expanse of the Shallows
dwelt high in the air in a vast murmur, now feeble now stronger,
that seemed to swing back and forth on the wind above the earth
without any one being able to tell whence it came. It was like
the solemn chant of a waterfall swelling and dying away above
the woods, the fields, above the roofs of houses and the heads
of men, above the secret peace of that hidden and flourishing
settlement of vanquished fanatics, fugitives, and outcasts.</p>

<p>Every afternoon Belarab, followed by an escort that stopped outside
the door, entered alone the house of his guest. He gave the salutation,
inquired after his health, conversed about insignificant things
with an inscrutable mien. But all the time the steadfast gaze
of his thoughtful eyes seemed to seek the truth within that white
face. In the cool of the evening, before the sun had set, they
talked together, passing and repassing between the rugged pillars
of the grove near the gate of the stockade. The escort away in
the oblique sunlight, followed with their eyes the strolling figures
appearing and vanishing behind the trees. Many words were pronounced,
but nothing was said that would disclose the thoughts of the two
men. They clasped hands demonstratively before separating, and
the heavy slam of the gate was followed by the triple thud of
the wooden bars dropped into iron clamps.</p>

<p>On the third night, Lingard was awakened from a light sleep by
the sound of whispering outside. A black shadow obscured the stars
in the doorway, and a man entering suddenly, stood above his couch
while another could be seen squatting&mdash;a dark lump on the threshold
of the hut.</p>

<p>"Fear not. I am Belarab," said a cautious voice.</p>

<p>"I was not afraid," whispered Lingard. "It is the man coming
in the dark and without warning who is in danger."</p>

<p>"And did you not come to me without warning? I said 'welcome'&mdash;it
was as easy for me to say 'kill him.'"</p>

<p>"You were within reach of my arm. We would have died together,"
retorted Lingard, quietly.</p>

<p>The other clicked his tongue twice, and his indistinct shape
seemed to sink half-way through the floor.</p>

<p>"It was not written thus before we were born," he said, sitting
cross-legged near the mats, and in a deadened voice. "Therefore
you are my guest. Let the talk between us be straight like the
shaft of a spear and shorter than the remainder of this night.
What do you want?"</p>

<p>"First, your long life," answered Lingard, leaning forward toward
the gleam of a pair of eyes, "and then&mdash;your help."</p>
