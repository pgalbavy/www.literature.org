<p>Two friends were seated in the private office of Rowland &amp;
Starland, Montgomery Street, San Francisco, not long ago, discussing
a subject in which both were much interested.</p>

<p>Each gentleman was past three-score, but they were well preserved,
of rugged health, well to do and prosperous. They had got on for
many years without so much as a shadow of difference between them.
They had made the tour of Europe together, had engaged in many
an outing and now as the evening of life was drawing on, they
took matters with that complacency and comfort which was creditable
to their good sense and which was warranted by their circumstances.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Starland, the junior partner, removed his cigar, leaned
back in his chair, and, looking kindly into the face of his friend,
said:</p>

<p>"Teddy, you came to California a number of years before I did."</p>

<p>The other, who was in a reminiscent mood, smoked in silence for
a minute or so, looking up to the ceiling, and, when he replied,
it was as if communing with himself:</p>

<p>"Yes; it is close upon half a century. How times flies! I was
a small boy, and I often wonder how it was Providence took such
good care of me."</p>

<p>"True, you were a young lad, but you had the best of companions."</p>

<p>"That is hardly correct, so far at least as one was concerned.
When I left home in the East to join my father, who had come to
California ahead of me, my companion was an Irishman named Micky
McGuigan, who was as green as I."</p>

<p>"I have heard you speak of another comrade&mdash;a four-footed one."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, our dog Towser, one of the most faithful and intelligent
brutes that ever lived. He died long ago of old age and I have
showed my gratitude and love for his memory by placing a monument
over his remains. Micky&mdash;peace to the memory of the good fellow&mdash;has
also rested in the tomb for years, and it was not long after that
my good father followed him,&mdash;so of all my companions on my first
coming to the Pacific coast, not one remains."</p>

<p>"You could hardly have passed safely through the many dangers
without the help of others," suggested Mr. Starland.</p>

<p>"I admit that. No braver man than Micky McGuigan ever lived.
He had the traditional Irishman's love of a fight and he got plenty
of it. But, Tom, our perils began, as you know, before we touched
foot in California. Off the southern coast our steamer, the <em>Western
Star</em>, was sunk in a collision. Teddy and I were left on the
uninhabited coast (so far as white people are concerned), without
so much as even a gun or pistol. Finding ourselves marooned, we
struck into the interior, stole a couple of guns and some ammunition
(what's the use of denying it at this late day?) from some Indians,
and then went it blindly."</p>

<p>"I recall something of a partnership you made with an experienced
miner."</p>

<p>"Yes; good fortune brought us together, and it was a lucky thing
indeed for us that we were picked up by Jo Harman, who piloted
us through no end of dangers. We spent weeks in hunting for gold
in what was then one of the wildest regions in the world."</p>

<p>"How did you make out?"</p>

<p>"We picked up a few particles, just enough to keep hope alive,
but, in the end, had to give it up and take our chances in the
diggings like the rest of the fortune hunters."</p>

<p>"Well, Teddy, we have proved that there are other ways of getting
treasure than by digging in the earth for it."</p>

<p>"Yes, though it takes digging in any circumstances, and we had
as hard times, at the beginning, as any of those who now dwell
on Nob Hill."</p>

<p>From the above brief conversation, you will recall the principal
character whom you met in the story of "Teddy and Towser." The
lad who passed through more than one trying adventure had become
a man well along in middle life. After settling in California,
he made it his home. He married a lady of Spanish descent, to
whom a single child was born, &mdash;Warrenia, now a miss almost
out of her teens. Although Mr. Starland was younger than his partner
and married later in life, his son Jack was several years the
elder of the daughter of Mr. Rowland.</p>

<p>Since these two young people have much to do in the chapters
that follow, the reader must be given a clear understanding of
them and their peculiar relation to each other.</p>

<p>While the parents had been partners in prosperity, they were
also united in affliction, for each had lost his wife by death,
when the children were small. Neither married again, for they
had loved their life companions too deeply and profoundly to think
seriously of trying to replace them.</p>

<p>Another minor but curious coincidence must be noted. Years after
the marriage of the partners, Mr. Starland employed a Spanish
priest to trace the genealogy of his wife, who felt a strong curiosity
in the matter. In doing so, he discovered that several generations
earlier, during the time of the Spanish settlement of the Southwest,
the ancestors of Mrs. Starland and Mrs. Rowland were related.
This was surprising but peculiarly pleasing to both families.
Because of this remote relationship, so triturated indeed that
it had really vanished into nothingness, Jack Starland and Warrenia
Rowland called themselves cousins.</p>

<p>It was just like the headstrong, impulsive, mischievous youth
to go still further. He hinted that the priest had not told the
whole truth, having been bribed to suppress it by the father of
Warrenia, for mysterious reasons, which he dared not divulge.
What did this young hopeful do but insist that he and Warrenia
were brother and sister! The idea, grotesquely impossible on the
face of it, caused no end of merriment and ridicule, but Jack
stubbornly maintained his claim. He declared further that the
real name of Warrenia was the same as his own,&mdash;that is Starland.
He often addressed her as Miss Starland, and she, with her fun-loving
disposition, pretended to agree with him. When together, they
almost invariably spoke to or of each other as brother and sister,
and there were not lacking those who believed they were actually
thus related.</p>

<p>The odd whim gave the parents no little amusement and they too
at times humored it. The very absurdity of the fancy gave it its
comicality.</p>

<p>You can understand how deeply each parent loved his child. Nothing
seemed more natural than that the son and daughter should become
man and wife when they grew up, though neither father as yet had
made any reference to such an event which would have been pleasing
to both and eminently fit in every respect.</p>

<p>Jack and Warrenia grew to maturity as if they really were brother
and sister. She was sent East to attend one of the most famous
young ladies' schools in the country. Jack was on the point of
entering Harvard, when he received an appointment to West Point.
There under the strict regulations he gained few opportunities
of seeing his "sister." When he did so, it was when she and some
of her classmates, under proper chaperonage visited the model
military institution on the banks of the Hudson.</p>

<p>Jack was graduated in time to take part in our war with Spain.
He won a fine reputation at San Juan Hill, and would have received
his well merited promotion, but when a Major by brevet, he resigned
to become interested in his father's business, which was growing
to a degree that new blood and vigor were required for its full
development.</p>
