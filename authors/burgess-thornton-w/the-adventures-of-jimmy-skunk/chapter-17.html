<p>Hardly had Jimmy Skunk entered the hole under Farmer Brown's
henhouse, following close on the heels of Unc' Billy Possum, than
along came Bowser the Hound, sniffing and sniffing in a way that
made Unc' Billy nervous. When Bowser reached that hole, of course
he smelled the tracks of Unc' Billy and Jimmy, and right away
he became excited. He began to dig. Goodness, how he did make
the dirt fly! All the time he whined with eagerness.</p>

<p>Unc' Billy wasted no time in squeezing through a hole in the
floor way over in one corner, a hole that Farmer Brown's boy had
intended to nail a board over long before. Unc' Billy knew that
Bowser couldn't get through that, even if he did manage to dig
his way under the henhouse. Once through that and fairly in the
henhouse, Unc' Billy drew a long breath. He felt safe for the
time being, anyway, and he didn't propose to worry over the future.</p>

<p>Jimmy Skunk hurried after Unc' Billy. It wasn't fear that caused
Jimmy to hurry. No, indeed, it wasn't fear. He had been startled
by the unexpectedness of Bowser's appearance. It was this that
had caused him to struggle to be first through that hole under
the henhouse. But once through, he had felt a bit ashamed that
he had been so undignified. He wasn't afraid of Bowser. He was
sorely tempted to turn around and send Bowser about his business,
as he knew he very well could. But he thought better of it. Besides,
Unc' Billy was already through that hole in the floor, and Jimmy
didn't for a minute forget what had brought him there. He had
come for eggs, and so had Unc' Billy. It would never do to let
Unc' Billy be alone up there for long. So Jimmy Skunk did what
he very seldom does&mdash;hurried. Yes, Sir, he hurried after Unc'
Billy Possum. He meant to make sure of his share of the eggs he
was certain were up there.</p>

<p>There was a row of nesting boxes along one side close to the
floor. Above these was another row and above these a third row.
Jimmy doesn't climb, but Unc' Billy is a famous climber.</p>

<p>"I'll take these lower nests," said Jimmy, and lifted his tail
in a way that made Unc' Billy nervous.</p>

<p>"All right," replied Unc' Billy promptly. "All right, Brer Skunk.
It's just as yo' say."</p>

<p>With this, Unc' Billy scrambled up to the next row of nests.
Jimmy grinned and started to look in the lower nests. He took
his time about it, for that is Jimmy's way. There was nothing
in the first one and nothing in the second one and nothing in
the third one. This was disappointing, to say the least, and Jimmy
began to move a little faster. Meanwhile Unc' Billy had hurried
from one nest to another in the second row with no better success.
By the time Jimmy was half-way along his row Unc' Billy bad begun
on the upper row, and the only eggs he had found were hard china
nest-eggs put there by Farmer Brown's boy to tempt the hens to
lay in those particular nests. Disappointment was making Unc'
Billy lose his temper. Each time he peeped in a nest and saw one
of those china eggs, he hoped it was a real egg, and each time
when he found it wasn't he grew angrier.</p>

<p>At last he so lost his temper that when he found another of those
eggs he angrily kicked it out of the nest. Now it happened that
Jimmy Skunk was just underneath. Down fell that hard china egg
squarely on Jimmy Skunk's head. For just a minute Jimmy saw stars.
At least, he thought he did. Then he saw the egg, and knew that
Unc' Billy had knocked it down, and that it was this that had
hit him. Jimmy was sore at heart because he had found no eggs,
and now he had a bump on the head that also was sore. Jimmy Skunk
lost his temper, a thing he rarely does.</p>
