<p>O'Rooney stood with rifle grasped, while young Munson ran toward
him from the centre of the cave, exclaiming in his excited tones:</p>

<p>"There's another man back yonder! I saw him and spoke to him!"</p>

<p>"Did ye ax him anything, and did he make a sensible reply?" demanded
the Irishman, whose concern was by no means equal to that of the
lad.</p>

<p>"He made no answer at all, nor did he seem to take any notice
of me."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's a ghost walking round the cave, on the same errand
as meself. But whist now; where is he, that I may go and ax him
the state of his health?"</p>

<p>The lad turned to lead the way, while Mickey followed close at
his heels, his gun ready to be used at an instant's warning, while
Fred kept glancing over his shoulder, to make sure that his friend
was not falling too far in the rear.</p>

<p>It seemed that, while the man was engaged in his exploration,
the lad had ventured upon a little prowling expedition of his
own. During this he made the startling discovery that some one
else was in the cave, and he dashed off at once: to notify his
friend and guide.</p>

<p>Fred walked some distance further, still holding the torch above
his head and peering into the gloom ahead and on either hand,
as though in doubt as to whether he was on the right track or
not. All at once he stopped with a start of surprise, and, pointing
some distance ahead and upon the ground, said:</p>

<p>"There he is!"</p>

<p>Following the direction indicated, Mickey saw the figure of a
man stretched out upon the ground, face downward, as though asleep.</p>

<p>"You ain't afeard of a dead spalpeen?" demanded Mickey, with
a laugh. "You might have knowed from his shtyle that he's as dead
as poor Thompson was when Lone Wolf made a call on him."</p>

<p>"How do you know he's dead?" asked Fred, whose terror was not
lessened by the word of his friend.</p>

<p>"'Cause he couldn't have stretched out that way, and kept it
up all the time we've been fooling round here. If ye entertain
any doubt, I'll prove it. Let me have your torch."</p>

<p>Taking it from the lad's trembling hand, he walked to the figure,
stooped down, and, taking it by the shoulder, turned it over upon
its back. The result was rather startling even to such a brave
man as Mickey. It was not a dead man which the two looked down
upon, but practically a skeleton&mdash;the remains of an individual,
who, perhaps, had been dead for years. Some strange property of
the air had dessicated the flesh, leaving the face bare and staring,
while the garments seemed scarcely the worse for their long exposure.</p>

<p>Another noticeable feature was the fact that the clothing of
the remains showed that not only was he a white man, but also
that he was not a hunter or frontier character, such as were about
the only ones found in that section of the country. The coat,
vest, and trousers were of fine dark cloth, and the boots were
of thin, superior leather. The cap was gone. It was just such
a dress as is encountered every day in our public streets.</p>

<p>Mickey O'Rooney contemplated the figure for a time in silence.
He was surprised and puzzled. Where could this person have come
from? There was nothing about his dress to show that he belonged
to the military service, else it might have been supposed that
he was some officer who had wandered away from his post, and had
been caught in the same fashion as had the man and boy.</p>

<p>"Are there any more around here?" asked Mickey, in a subdued
tone, peering off into the gloom.</p>

<p>Fred passed slowly round in a circle, gradually widening out,
until he had passed over quite an area, but without discovering
anything further.</p>

<p>"There isn't any one else near us. If there is, he is in some
other part of the cave."</p>

<p>"How came ye to find this fellow?"</p>

<p>"I was walking along, never thinking of anything of the kind,
when I came near stepping upon the body. I was never more scared
in my life."</p>

<p>"That's the way wid some of yees&mdash;ye're more affrighted at a
dead man than a live one. Let's see whether he has left anything
that ye can identify him by."</p>

<p>Upon examining further, a silver-mounted revolver was found beneath
the body. It was untarnished, and seemingly as good as the day
it was completed. When Mickey came to look at it more closely,
he found that only one barrel had been discharged, all the others
being loaded.</p>

<p>This fact aroused a suspicion, and, looking again at the head,
a round hole, such as would have been made only by a bullet, was
found in the very centre of the forehead. There could be but little
doubt, then, that this man, whoever he was, had wandered about
the cavern until famished, and, despairing of any escape, had
deliberately sent himself out of the world by means of the weapon
at his command. But who was he?</p>

<p>Laying the handsome pistol aside, Mickey continued the search,
anxious to find something that would throw light upon the history
of the man. It was probable that he had a rifle&mdash;but it was not
to be found, and, perhaps, had vanished, as had that of Fred Munson.
It was more likely that something would be found in his pockets
that would throw some light upon the question; and the Irishman,
having undertaken the job, went through it to the end.</p>

<p>It was not the pleasantest occupation in the world to ransack
the clothing of a skeleton, and he who was doing it could not
help reflecting as he did so that it looked very much like a desecration
and a robbing of the dead. To his great disappointment, however,
he failed to discover anything which would give the slightest
clue. It looked as if the man had purposely destroyed all such
articles before destroying himself, and, after a thorough search,
Mickey was compelled to give up the hunt.</p>

<p>Five chambers of the revolver, as has been said, were still loaded,
and, after replacing the caps, the new owner was confident they
were good for that number of shots.</p>

<p>"Here," said he, handing the weapon to the boy; "your rifle is
gone, and you may as well take charge of this. It may come as
handy as a shillelah in a scrimmage, so ye does hold on to the
same."</p>

<p>Fred took it rather gingerly, for he did not fancy the idea of
going off with property taken from a dead man, but he suffered
his friend to pursuade him, and the arrangement was made.</p>

<p>In the belief that there might be others somewhere around, Mickey
spent an hour or two longer in an exploration of the cave, with
the single purpose of looking for bodies. They approached the
ravine in which Fred had dropped his gun. The Irishman leaped
across, torch in hand, and prosecuted his search along that side;
but they were compelled to give over after a time and conclude
that only a single individual had preceded them in the cave.</p>

<p>"Where he came from must iver remain a mystery," said Mickey.
"He hasn't been the kind of chaps you find in this part of the
world; but whoever he was, it must have been his luck to drop
through the skylight, just as we did. He must have found the wood
here and kindled a fire. Then he wint tramping round, looking
for some place to find his way out, and kept it up till he made
up his mind it was no use Then he acted like a gintleman who prefarred
to be shot to starving, and, finding nobody around to 'tend to
the business, done it himself."</p>

<p>"Can't we bury him, Mickey?"</p>

<p>"He's buried already."</p>

<p>The Irishman meant nothing especial in his reply, but there was
a deep significance about it which sent a shudder through his
hearer from head to foot. Yes, the stranger was buried, and in
the same grave with him were Mickey O'Rooney and Fred Munson.</p>

<p>The speaker saw the effect his words had produced, and attempted
to remove their sting.</p>

<p>"It looks very much to me as if the man had n't done anything
but thramp, thramp, without thrying any way of getting out, and
then had keeled over and give up."</p>

<p>"What could he do, Mickey?"</p>

<p>"Could n't he have jumped into the stream, and made a dive? He
stood a chance of coming up outside, and if he had n't, he would
have been as well off as he is now."</p>

<p>"Is that what <em>you</em> mean to do?"</p>

<p>"I will, before I'd give up as he did; but it's meself that thinks
there's some other way of finding our way. Bring me gun along,
and come with me!"</p>

<p>Mickey carried the torch, because he wished to use it himself.
He led the way back to where the stream disappeared from view,
and there he made another careful examination, his purpose being
different from what it had been in the first place. He stooped
over and peered at the dark walls, noting the width of the stream
and the contour of the bank, as well as the level of the land
on the right. Evidently he had some scheme which he was considering.</p>

<p>He said nothing, but spent fully a half hour in his self-imposed
task, during which Fred stood in the background, trying to make
out what he was driving at. He saw that Mickey was so intently
occupied that he was scarcely conscious of the presence of any
one else, and he did not attempt to disturb him. Suddenly the
Celt roused himself from his abstraction, and, turning to the
expectant lad, abruptly asked:</p>

<p>"Do you know, me laddy, that it is dinner-time?"</p>

<p>"I feel as though it was, but we have no means of judging the
time, being as neither of us carries a watch."</p>

<p>"Come on," added the Irishman, leading in the direction of the
camp-fire. "I'm sorry I didn't bring my watch wid me, but the
trouble was, I was afeard that it might tire out my horse, for
it was of goodly size. The last time it got out of order, it took
a blacksmith in the owld country nearly a week to mend it. It
was rather large, but it would have been handy. Whenever we wanted
to cook anything, we could have used the case for a stew-pan,
or we could have b'iled eggs in the same, and when we started
our hotel at New Boston, it would have done for a gong. It was
rather tiresome to wind up nights, as the key didn't give you
much leverage, and if your hold happened to slip, you was likely
to fall down and hurt yersilf. But here we are, as Jimmy O'Donovan
said when he j'ined his father and mother in jail."</p>
