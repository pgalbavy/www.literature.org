<P>
 The next day Sir Joseph Graybrooke, Sir Joseph's lawyer, Mr.
Dicas (highly respectable and immensely rich), and Richard
Turlington were assembled in the library at Muswell Hill, to
discuss the question of Natalie's marriage settlement.
<P>
After the usual preliminary phrases had been exchanged, Sir
Joseph showed some hesitation in openly approaching the question
which the little party of three had met to debate. He avoided his
lawyer's eye; and he looked at Turlington rather uneasily.
<P>
"Richard," he began at last, "when I spoke to you about your
marriage, on board the yacht, I said I would give my daughter--"
Either his courage or his breath failed him at that point. He was
obliged to wait a moment before he could go on.
<P>
"I said I would give my daughter half my fortune on her
marriage," he resumed. "Forgive me, Richard. I can't do it!"
<P>
Mr. Dicas, waiting for his instructions, laid down his pen and
looked at Sir Joseph's son-in-law elect. What would Mr.
Turlington say?
<P>
He said nothing. Sitting opposite the window, he rose when Sir
Joseph spoke, and placed himself at the other side of the table,
with his back to the light.
<P>
"My eyes are weak this morning," he said, in an unnaturally low
tone of voice. "The light hurts them."
<P>
He could find no more plausible excuse than that for concealing
his face in shadow from the scrutiny of the two men on either
side of him. The continuous moral irritation of his unhappy
courtship--a courtship which had never advanced beyond the frigid
familiarity of kissing Natalie's hand in the presence of others--
had physically deteriorated him. Even _his_ hardy nerves began to
feel the long strain of suspicion that had been laid
unremittingly on them for weeks past. His power of self-control--
he knew it himself--was not to be relied on. He could hide his
face: he could no longer command it.
<P>
"Did you hear what I said, Richard?"
<P>
"I heard. Go on."
<P>
Sir Joseph proceeded, gathering confidence as he advanced.
<P>
"Half my fortune!" he repeated. "It's parting with half my life;
it's saying good-by forever to my dearest friend! My money has
been such a comfort to me, Richard; such a pleasant occupation
for my mind. I know no reading so interesting and so instructive
as the reading of one's Banker's Book. To watch the outgoings on
one side," said Sir Joseph, with a gentle and pathetic solemnity,
"and the incomings on the other--the sad lessening of the balance
at one time, and the cheering and delightful growth of it at
another--what absorbing reading! The best novel that ever was
written isn't to be mentioned in a breath with it. I can not,
Richard, I really can _not_, see my nice round balance shrink up
to half the figure that I have been used to for a lifetime. It
may be weak of me," proceeded Sir Joseph, evidently feeling that
it was not weak of him at all, "but we all have our tender place,
and my Banker's Book is mine. Besides, it isn't as if you wanted
it. If you wanted it, of course--but you don't want it. You are a
rich man; you are marrying my dear Natalie for love, not for
money. You and she and my grandchildren will have it all at my
death. It _can_ make no difference to you to wait a few years
till the old man's chair at the fireside is empty. Will you say
the fourth part, Richard, instead of the half? Twenty thousand,"
pleaded Sir Joseph, piteously. "I can bear twenty thousand off.
For God's sake don't ask me for more!"
<P>
The lips of the lawyer twisted themselves sourly into an ironical
smile. He was quite as fond of his money as Sir Joseph. He ought
to have felt for his client; but rich men have no sympathy with
one another. Mr. Dicas openly despised Sir Joseph.
<P>
There was a pause. The robin-redbreasts in the shrubbery outside
must have had prodigious balances at their bankers; they hopped
up on the window-sill so fearlessly; they looked in with so
little respect at the two rich men.
<P>
"Don't keep me in suspense, Richard," proceeded Sir Joseph.
"Speak out. Is it yes or no?"
<P>
Turlington struck his hand excitedly on the table, and burst out
on a sudden with the answer which had been so strangely delayed.
<P>
"Twenty thousand with all my heart!" he said. "On this condition,
Graybrooke, that every farthing of it is settled on Natalie, and
on her children after her. Not a half-penny to me!" he cried
magnanimously, in his brassiest tones. "Not a half- penny to me!"
<P>
Let no man say the rich are heartless. Sir Joseph seized his
son-in-law's hand in silence, and burst into tears.
<P>
Mr. Dicas, habitually a silent man, uttered the first two words
that had escaped him since the business began. "Highly
creditable," he said, and took a note of his instructions on the
spot.
<P>
From that point the business of the settlement flowed smoothly on
to its destined end. Sir Joseph explained his views at the
fullest length, and the lawyer's pen kept pace with him.
Turlington, remaining in his place at the table, restricted
himself to a purely passive part in the proceedings. He answered
briefly when it was absolutely necessary to speak, and he agreed
with the two elders in everything. A man has no attention to
place at the disposal of other people when he stands at a crisis
in his life. Turlington stood at that crisis, at the trying
moment when Sir Joseph's unexpected proposal pressed instantly
for a reply. Two merciless alternatives confronted him. Either he
must repay the borrowed forty thousand pounds on the day when
repayment was due, or he must ask Bulpit Brothers to grant him an
extension of time, and so inevitably provoke an examination into
the fraudulent security deposited with the firm, which could end
in but one way. His last, literally his last chance, after Sir
Joseph had diminished the promised dowry by one half, was to
adopt the high-minded tone which became his position, and to
conceal the truth until he could reveal it to his father-in-law
in the privileged character of Natalie's husband. "I owe forty
thousand pounds, sir, in a fortnight's time, and I have not got a
farthing of my own. Pay for me, or you will see your son-in-
law's name in the Bankrupt's List." For his daughter's sake--who
could doubt it?--Sir Joseph would produce the money. The one
thing needful was to be married in time. If either by accident or
treachery Sir Joseph was led into deferring the appointed day, by
so much as a fortnight only, the fatal "call" would come, and the
firm of Pizzituti, Turlington & Branca would appear in the
Gazette.
<P>
So he reasoned, standing on the brink of the terrible discovery
which was soon to reveal to him that Natalie was the wife of
another man.
<P>
"Richard!"
<P>
"Mr. Turlington!"
<P>
He started, and roused his attention to present things. Sir
Joseph on one side, and the lawyer on the other, were both
appealing to him, and both regarding him with looks of amazement.
<P>
"Have you done with the settlement?" he asked.
<P>
"My dear Richard, we have done with it long since, " replied Sir
Joseph. "Have you really not heard what I have been saying for
the last quarter of an hour to good Mr. Dicas here? What _can_
you have been thinking of?"
<P>
Turlington did not attempt to answer the question. "Am I
interested," he asked, "in what you have been saying to Mr.
Dicas?"
<P>
"You shall judge for yourself," answered Sir Joseph,
mysteriously; "I have been giving Mr. Dicas his instructions for
making my Will. I wish the Will and the Marriage-Settlement to be
executed at the same time. Read the instructions, Mr. Dicas."
<P>
Sir Joseph's contemplated Will proved to have two merits--it was
simple and it was short. Excepting one or two trifling legacies
to distant relatives, he had no one to think of (Miss Lavinia
being already provided for) but his daughter and the children who
might be born of her marriage. In its various provisions, made
with these two main objects in view, the Will followed the
precedents established in such cases. It differed in no important
respect from the tens of thousands of other wills made under
similar circumstances. Sir Joseph's motive in claiming special
attention for it still remained unexplained, when Mr. Dicas
reached the clause devoted to the appointment of executors and
trustees; and announced that this portion of the document was
left in blank.
<P>
"Sir Joseph Graybrooke, are you prepared to name the persons whom
you appoint?" asked the lawyer.
<P>
Sir Joseph rose, apparently for the purpose of giving special
importance to the terms in which he answered his lawyer's
question.
<P>
"I appoint," he said, "as sole executor and trustee--Richard
Turlington."
<P>
It was no easy matter to astonish Mr. Dicas. Sir Joseph's reply
absolutely confounded him. He looked across the table at his
client and delivered himself on this special occasion of as many
as three words.
<P>
"Are you mad?" he asked.
<P>
Sir Joseph's healthy complexion slightly reddened. "I never was
in more complete possession of myself, Mr. Dicas, than at this
moment."
<P>
Mr. Dicas was not to be silenced in that way.
<P>
"Are you aware of what you do," persisted the lawyer, "if you
appoint Mr. Turlington as sole executor and trustee? You put it
in the power of your daughter's husband, sir, to make away with
every farthing of your money after your death."
<P>
Turlington had hitherto listened with an appearance of interest
in the proceedings, which he assumed as an act of politeness. To
his view, the future was limited to the date at which Bulpit
Brothers had a right to claim the repayment of their loan. The
Will was a matter of no earthly importance to him, by comparison
with the infinitely superior interest of the Marriage. It was
only when the lawyer's brutally plain language forced his
attention to it that the question of his pecuniary interest in
his father-in-law's death assumed its fit position in his mind.
<P>
_His_ color rose; and _he_ too showed that he was offended by
what Mr. Dicas had just said.
<P>
"Not a word, Richard! Let me speak for you as well as for
myself," said Sir Joseph. "For seven years past," he continued,
turning to the lawyer, "I have been accustomed to place the most
unlimited trust in Richard Turlington. His disinterested advice
has enabled me largely to increase my income, without placing a
farthing of the principal in jeopardy. On more than one occasion,
I have entreated him to make use of my money in his business. He
has invariably refused to do so. Even his bitterest enemies, sir,
have been obliged to acknowledge that my interests were safe when
committed to his care. Am I to begin distrusting him, now that I
am about to give him my daughter in marriage? Am I to leave it on
record that I doubt him for the first time--when my Will is
opened after my death? No! I can confide the management of the
fortune which my child will inherit after me to no more competent
or more honorable hands than the hands of the man who is to marry
her. I maintain my appointment, Mr. Dicas! I persist in placing
the whole responsibility under my Will in my son-in-law's care."
<P>
Turlington attempted to speak. The lawyer attempted to speak. Sir
Joseph--with a certain simple dignity which had its effect on
both of them--declined to hear a word on either side. "No,
Richard! as long as I am alive this is my business, not yours.
No, Mr. Dicas! I understand that it is your business to protest
professionally. You have protested. Fill in the blank space as I
have told you. Or leave the instructions on the table, and I will
send for the nearest solicitor to complete them in your place."
<P>
Those words placed the lawyer's position plainly before him. He
had no choice but to do as he was bid, or to lose a good client.
He did as he was bid, and grimly left the room
<P>
Sir Joseph, with old-fashioned politeness, followed him as far as
the hall. Returning to the library to say a few friendly words
before finally dismissing the subject of the Will, he found
himself seized by the arm, and dragged without ceremony, in
Turlington's powerful grasp, to the window.
<P>
"Richard!" he exclaimed, "what does this mean?"
<P>
"Look!" cried the other, pointing through the window to a grassy
walk in the grounds, bounded on either side by shrubberies, and
situated at a little distance from the house. "Who is that man?--
quick! before we lose sight of him--the man crossing there from
one shrubbery to the other?" Sir Joseph failed to recognize the
figure before it disappeared. Turlington whispered fiercely,
close to his ear--"Launcelot Linzie!"
<P>
In perfect good faith Sir Joseph declared that the man could not
possibly have been Launce. Turlington's frenzy of jealous
suspicion was not to be so easily calmed. He asked significantly
for Natalie. She was reported to be walking in the grounds. "I
knew it!" he said, with an oath--and hurried out into the grounds
to discover the truth for himself.
<P>
Some little time elapsed before he came back to the house. He had
discovered Natalie--alone. Not a sign of Launce had rewarded his
search. For the hundredth time he had offended Natalie. For the
hundredth time he was compelled to appeal to the indulgence of
her father and her aunt. "It won't happen again," he said,
sullenly penitent. "You will find me quite another man when I
have got you all at my house in the country. Mind!" he burst out,
with a furtive look, which expressed his inveterate distrust of
Natalie and of every one about her. "Mind! it's settled that you
all come to me in Somersetshire, on Monday next." Sir Joseph
answered rather dryly that it was settled. Turlington turned to
leave the room--and suddenly came back. "It's understood," he
went on, addressing Miss Lavinia, "that the seventh of next month
is the date fixed for the marriage. Not a day later!" Miss
Lavinia replied, rather dryly on her side, "Of course, Richard;
not a day later. "He muttered, "All right" and hurriedly left
them.
<P>
Half an hour afterward Natalie came in, looking a little
confused.
<P>
"Has he gone?" she asked, whispering to her aunt.
<P>
Relieved on this point, she made straight for the library--a room
which she rarely entered at that or any other period of the day.
Miss Lavinia followed her, curious to know what it meant. Natalie
hurried to the window, and waved her handkerchief-- evidently
making a signal to some one outside. Miss Lavinia instantly
joined her, and took her sharply by the hand.
<P>
"Is it possible, Natalie?" she asked. "Has Launcelot Linzie
really been here, unknown to your father or to me?"
<P>
"Where is the harm if he has?" answered Natalie, with a sudden
outbreak of temper. "Am I never to see my cousin again, because
Mr. Turlington happens to be jealous of him?"
<P>
She suddenly turned away her head. The rich color flowed over her
face and neck. Miss Lavinia, proceeding sternly with the
administration of the necessary reproof, was silenced midway by a
new change in her niece's variable temper. Natalie burst into
tears. Satisfied with this appearance of sincere contrition, the
old lady consented to overlook what had happened; and, for this
occasion only, to keep her niece's secret. They would all be in
Somersetshire, she remarked, before any more breaches of
discipline could be committed. Richard had fortunately made no
disco veries; and the matter might safely be trusted, all things
considered, to rest where it was.
<P>
Miss Lavinia might possibly have taken a less hopeful view of the
circumstances, if she had known that one of the men-servants at
Muswell Hill was in Richard Turlington's pay, and that this
servant had seen Launce leave the grounds by the back-garden
gate.
