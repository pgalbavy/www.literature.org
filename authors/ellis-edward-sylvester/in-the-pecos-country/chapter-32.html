<p>The direct result of this exchange of shots was to make the two
parties more cautious. Mickey and Fred kept further away from
the camp-fire, which they suffered to die out gradually. There
was really no need fot it, and, since its presence meant danger,
it was only prudent to dispense with it altogether.</p>

<p>For fully a half hour not the slightest movement or disturbance
at the opening betrayed the presence of any one there, although
there could be no doubt that their enemies were within call.</p>

<p>"I can't see what they can gain by loafing around them parts,
as the lassies used to obsarve in the ould country when any of
the laddies tried to cut me out wid 'em. They need n't watch for
us to come out that way, for there ain't much danger of our trying
to steal out of that hole&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Holloa! Look there!" exclaimed Fred, in considerable excitement;
"some of them are coming down to catch us."</p>

<p>Mickey had already noticed that something unusual was up, and,
just as the lad spoke, the figure of what seemed to be a man blocked
up the opening, and then began slowly descending, as if supported
by a rope, with which his friends were lowering him into the lower
room. His form was swathed with a blanket, and there was a certain
majesty in the slowly sinking figure, which would have been very
impressive but for the fact that it was hardly started when the
thin cord by which it was suspended began to twist and untwist,
causing the form to revolve forward and backward in a way that
was fatal to dignity.</p>

<p>On the impulse of the moment, the Irishman had raised his gun
to fire the moment his eyes rested upon the figure. But he restrained
himself, not a little puzzled to guess the meaning of such a proceeding.
The man, as they believed him to be, was slowly lowered, until
something like a dozen feet below the opening, where those who
had him in charge seemed to think was the proper place to hold
him on exhibition for a time.</p>

<p>"Are you going to shoot?" asked the boy, who did not understand
the delay.</p>

<p>"What's the use?" he asked, with an expression of disgust.</p>

<p>"Why, it will stop the man coming down on us."</p>

<p>"Man, do ye say? He ain't any more a man than me gun is."</p>

<p>"What, then, can he be?"</p>

<p>"He's a blanket that they've twisted up so as to look as though
it is gathered about the shoulders of an Apache. It's easy to
see that there's nothing in it from the way it swings around,
as though it was a little toy; and, be the same token, that little
cord which holds him aloft is no thicker than a darning-needle.
Why they are thrying such a simple thrick is more than I can tell."</p>

<p>"I think I know," said Fred. "They've dropped him down to find
out whether we're on the watch or not. If we didn't pay any attention
to it, they would think that neither of us was on the look-out,
and they would send some others down to scalp us."</p>

<p>"Be the powers, me laddy, I b'lave ye are right!" exclaimed Mickey,
admiringly. "That's just the plan of the spalpeens, by which towken,
I'll tip him a shot."</p>

<p>With this he raised his rifle, and, sighting rather carelessly,
fired. The shot, which was aimed at the roll of blanket, missed
it altogether and cut the string which held it suspended in mid-air.</p>

<p>The next moment there was a dull thump upon the sand, and the
package lay at the feet of the Irishman, who gave it a kick to
make sure of its nature. It rebounded several feet, the resistance
to the blow showing that there was nothing more than the simple
blanket, and then he stooped over and examined it more closely
by the sense of touch.</p>

<p>"'Twas very kind of the spalpeens to furnish us with a blanket
that saams as good as this, though the weather ain't so cold that
we naad it just now; but sometimes the rain comes and the northers
blow, and then a chap is mighty glad to have seech a convanient
article about. 'Twas very kind I say."</p>

<p>The result of the little experiment upon the part of the Apaches,
it was apparent, was not satisfactory to them. The boy was right
in his surmise of its purpose; but it cannot be supposed that
they counted upon losing the blanket under any circumstances.
It was a costly and beautiful one, such as are made by the Indians
of the southwest, and it was new enough to be clean, so that the
two fugitives had secured a prize. At all events, the Apaches
must have concluded that the people below were keeping watch and
ward so well that no one could descend into the cave without danger
of being perforated by a rifle ball.</p>

<p>Shortly after this occurrence it began to grow dark above, but
the cause was obvious. The day was drawing to a close. Darkness,
only less profound than that within the cave below, was enwrapping
the surface above.</p>

<p>As soon as the night had fairly descended, Mickey O'Rooney, handling
a small torch with great care, made his way once more to the puzzling
outlet of the underground stream. The inspection satisfied him
of the accuracy of his theory. Not the slightest tinge of light
relieved the impenetrable gloom. Mickey considered this strong
proof that it was but a short distance to the free air outside,
and his courage rose very nearly to the sticking point of making
the experiment then and there.</p>

<p>"But we both naad sleep," he mused, as he threw down his torch,
and made his way back by the dull glare of the expiring camp-fire.
"We both lost considerable last night, and a chap can't kaap reg'lar
hours any more than he can when he's coorting three lassies at
the same time, and thrying to kaap aich from suspecting it. I
faal as though we shall have something lively to do to-morrow,
and so we'd better gain all the slumber we kin."</p>

<p>When he reached the camp, he found the lad anxiously awaiting
his return. They had signaled to each other several times, but
the presence of the danger overhead rendered the boy more uneasy
than usual when they were apart.</p>

<p>"Have ye observed nothing?" asked Mickey, in an undertone.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all."</p>

<p>"It's too dark I know, to see, but mebbe yees have heerd something
to tell ye that the spalpeens are up there still."</p>

<p>"You may be sure I listened all I know how, but everything has
kept as still as the grave. I haven't heard the fall of a pebble
even. What do you think the Indians mean to do?"</p>

<p>"Well it's hard to tell. It fooks as though they didn't think
we fell in, but had come down on purpose, and had some way of
getting out as easy, and they're on the look out for us."</p>

<p>"Maybe, Mickey, there's some other way of coming in, that we
haven't been able to find."</p>

<p>"I hoped so a while ago, but I've guv it up. If them spalpeens
knowed of any other way, what do they mean by fooling around that
place up there, where they're likely to get shot if they show
themselves, and they're likely to lose the best blankets they've
got?"</p>

<p>Fred did not feel competent to answer this question, and so he
was forced to believe that Mickey was right in his conclusion
that there was no other way of entering the cave than by the skylight
above.</p>

<p>"Which the same thing being the case, I propose that we thry
and see how the new blanket answers for a bed. Begorrah! but its
fine, as me mither used to say when she run her hands over the
head of me dad, and felt the lumps made by the shillelah."</p>

<p>And, having spread the blanket out in the dark-ness, he rubbed
his hands over its velvety surface, admiring its wonderful texture.
The texture is such that water can be carried in these Apache
blankets with as much certainty as in a metal vessel. But Fred
protested against both lying down to sleep at the same time. He
thought it likely that the Apaches meant to visit the cave during
the night; but his friend laughed his fears to scorn, assuring
him that there could be no danger at all. In view of the reception
tendered the blanket, the Apaches would take it for granted that
the parties beneath were too vigilant to permit anyone to steal
a march upon them.</p>

<p>Mickey at once attested his sincerity by stretching out upon
the inviting couch, and Fred concluded at last to join him. It
was not long before the Irishman was sound asleep, but the lad
lay awake a long time, looking reflectively up at the spot where
he knew the opening to be,&mdash;the opening which had been the means
of letting himself and comrade down into that dismal retreat of
solitude,&mdash;and wondering what their enemies were doing.</p>

<p>"They must know that I am here. Lone Wolf will punish them if
they don't keep me, so I am sure they will do all they can to
catch me again. I wish I was certain that there was no way of
getting in but through that up there, and then I could sleep too,
but I feel too scared to do it now."</p>

<p>This anxiety kept him awake a long time after Mickey became unconscious;
but, as hour after hour passed and the stillness remained unbroken,
his fears were gradually dissipated and a feeling of drowsiness
began stealing over him.</p>

<p>Before consciousness entirely departed, he turned upon his side,
that being the posture he generally assumed when asleep. As he
made the movement and his ear was placed against the blanket,
which in its turn rested upon the ground, he heard something which
aroused his suspicions instantly and he raised his head. But when
he rested on his hands, with his shoulders thrown up, he could
hear nothing at all. The earth was a better conductor of sound
than the atmosphere, which accounted for what at first seemed
curious.</p>

<p>The boy applied his ear as before, and again he heard the noise,
faintly, but distinctly; As the eye was of no use, he pressed
his head against the blanket and listened. Several minutes were
occupied in this manner, and then he said, in an undertone:</p>

<p>"I know what it is!&mdash;it is somebody walking as softly as he can.
There is another way of getting into this cavern, and those Apaches
have found it out. They've got inside and are hunting for us!"</p>
