<p><em>THEOPHRASTE, </em>the next day, seemed to have forgotten
all the incidents of the night before, or at least to attach very
little importance to them.</p>

<p>As to Marceline, she was far too agitated to make any direct
mention of it. However, she knew Adolphe would be calling at noon
and she was resolved to find out the cause of Théophraste’s actions
before he came so that she could tell Adolphe the best to act.
The thing that struck her most was Théophraste’s sudden show of
courage and strength. Before he had shown excessive lack of courage,
and he was naturally physically weak. Suddenly, to be seized with
all the nerve necessary to meet a burglar and then to have the
strength to gag and bind him and cut off his ears, was unnatural.
He had always recoiled from the sight of blood, and here he was
fairly reveling in it. What could all this mean? He had suddenly
turned from a quiet, inoffensive citizen to a ghoul.</p>

<p>It was with these thoughts that she approached Théophraste and
demanded an explanation. He at first was loath to tell her, but
her entreaties prevailed, and he eventually told her that it was
the spirit of Cartouche that had seized him and forced him to
do these horrible actions. He told her with a sort of bravado
that there had been more than one hundred and fifty assassinations
laid to his account.</p>

<p>Marceline was in a terrible state of mind and shrank from him.
She declared that nothing in the world would make her live with
him. She would apply for a divorce. She thought she had married
an honest man, and now she had discovered him to be a thief and
murderer. Here were enough grounds for a separation, and she declared
her intention of securing it.</p>

<p>At this Théophraste became very melancholy, and entreated her
to think of his side of the calamity. He told her how necessary
her help was to him, and with Adolphe’s and her assistance he
thought he could throw off this evil influence. By this time he
had become quite rational, and they decided to consult Adolphe,
and if necessary, have him live with them.</p>

<p>Marceline readily acquiesced in this suggestion. Adolphe arrived
about 1 o’clock, and she took him into the sitting-room and was
soon in earnest and animated council with him. Théophraste went
into his office and waited anxiously for them to join him. After
some time they returned, and Marceline insisted that Théophraste
should do all that Adolphe should ask of him, which he readily
consented to do, having confidence in his friend.</p>

<p>Later on in the afternoon Théophraste and Adolphe went for a
walk into the city. Théophraste immediately began asking questions
as to Adolphe’s progress in the search for the treasures. He,
however, was in no mood to tell much. Marceline’s story of the
night before had driven all thoughts of the treasure out of his
head, and he answered somewhat abruptly that nothing of importance
had been found, and that he must think of Théophraste’s health
first, before taking any further steps.</p>

<p>It was obvious to Théophraste that Adolphe was evading the subject,
and he was determined to find out more of the matter.</p>

<p>He felt that Adolphe had more information, and so pressed him
to speak. Adolphe then told how he had discovered that after the
war most of the soldiers who had been serving with Cartouche had
been discharged, and were left with no means of livelihood, and
so, recognizing him as having the talent of a leader, they formed
themselves into a party of bandits, and placed him at their head.
At this time the police force of Paris was quite inadequate to
cope with the many crimes; therefore Cartouche and his comrades
resolved to turn their attention to this. He divided his men into
troops, and gave them each a quarter, to guard over which he placed
an intelligent lieutenant. When anybody was found out after curfew
he was politely accosted and requested to turn over a sum of money,
or if he had no money on him, to part with his coat. In exchange
for this he was given a pass which entitled him to walk through
Paris in perfect security at any time he pleased. He would have
nothing to fear from Cartouche’s men. If he showed any resistance
he was immediately killed. Cartouche had the clergy on his side,
and was often able to make good use of them. One priest named
Le Ratichon, was even hanged for him.</p>

<p>On reaching the Hotel de Ville, Adolphe stopped and asked Théophraste
if he cared to cross the Place de l’Hotel de Ville.</p>

<p>He answered, "If you wish, certainly we will."</p>

<p>"Have you often crossed the place?" said Adolphe.</p>

<p>"Yes, very often," replied Théophraste.</p>

<p>"And nothing unusual has happened? Is there any place in Paris
which you have some difficulty in passing?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, of course not. What is there to hinder me from going
anywhere?"</p>

<p>However, Adolphe’s look made him reflect, and then he recalled
having several times walked up the Place de l’Ordson, and when
in front of the Institute he changed his mind and retraced his
steps. He accounted for this rather by his absent-mindedness than
by anything unusual. He recalled that he had never passed through
the Rue Mazarine or crossed the Pont-Neuf. Neither had he crossed
the Petit Pont. He had always turned at the corner of the Rue
Ville du Temple, near the house with the grated windows.</p>

<p>"Why," Adolphe asked, "can’t you pass these places?"</p>

<p>"I think it is because the paving stones are red; and I dislike
that color."</p>

<p>"You remember the Place de Grere?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. It was there that the pillory and scaffold were erected.
The wheel was placed there on execution days in front of the Rue
Vanniere. There was the old coal harbor. I never passed that place
without counselling my comrades to avoid the wheel. However, I
will wager not one profited by it."</p>

<p>"Nor you either," said Adolphe. "It was there that you suffered
the final torment. It was there that you were racked and expired
by the tortures of the wheel."</p>
