<p> We slipped out to sea quietly at dusk, and all through the night
everything went well.  The breeze was gusty; a southerly blow
was making up.  It was fair wind for our course.  Now and then
Dominic slowly and rhythmically struck his hands together a few
times, as if applauding the performance of the <em>Tremolino</em>. 
The balancelle hummed and quivered as she flew along, dancing
lightly under our feet.</p>

<p>At daybreak I pointed out to Dominic, amongst the several sail
in view running before the gathering storm, one particular vessel. 
The press of canvas she carried made her loom up high, end-on,
like a gray column standing motionless directly in our wake.</p>

<p>"Look at this fellow, Dominic," I said.  "He seems to be in a
hurry."</p>

<p>The Padrone made no remark, but, wrapping his black cloak close
about him, stood up to look.  His weather-tanned face, framed
in the hood, had an aspect of authority and challenging force,
with the deep-set eyes gazing far away fixedly, without a wink,
like the intent, merciless, steady eyes of a sea-bird.</p>

<p>"<em>Chi va piano va sano</em>," he remarked at last, with a
derisive glance over the side, in ironic allusion to our own tremendous
speed.</p>

<p>The <em>Tremolino</em> was doing her best, and seemed to hardly
touch the great burst of foam over which she darted.  I crouched
down again to get some shelter from the low bulwark.  After more
than half an hour of swaying immobility expressing a concentrated,
breathless watchfulness, Dominic sank on the deck by my side. 
Within the monkish cowl his eyes gleamed with a fierce expression
which surprised me.  All he said was:</p>

<p>"He has come out here to wash the new paint off his yards, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"What?" I shouted, getting up on my knees.  "Is she the guardacosta?"</p>

<p>The perpetual suggestion of a smile under Dominic’s piratical
moustaches seemed to become more accentuated—quite real, grim,
actually almost visible through the wet and uncurled hair.  Judging
by that symptom, he must have been in a towering rage.  But I
could also see that he was puzzled, and that discovery affected
me disagreeably.  Dominic puzzled! For a long time, leaning against
the bulwark, I gazed over the stern at the gray column that seemed
to stand swaying slightly in our wake always at the same distance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dominic, black and cowled, sat cross-legged on the
deck, with his back to the wind, recalling vaguely an Arab chief
in his burnuss sitting on the sand.  Above his motionless figure
the little cord and tassel on the stiff point of the hood swung
about inanely in the gale. At last I gave up facing the wind and
rain, and crouched down by his side.  I was satisfied that the
sail was a patrol craft.  Her presence was not a thing to talk
about, but soon, between two clouds charged with hail-showers,
a burst of sunshine fell upon her sails, and our men discovered
her character for themselves.  From that moment I noticed that
they seemed to take no heed of each other or of anything else. 
They could spare no eyes and no thought but for the slight column-shape
astern of us.  Its swaying had become perceptible.  For a moment
she remained dazzlingly white, then faded away slowly to nothing
in a squall, only to reappear again, nearly black, resembling
a post stuck upright against the slaty background of solid cloud. 
Since first noticed she had not gained on us a foot.</p>

<p>"She will never catch the <em>Tremolino</em>," I said exultingly.</p>

<p>Dominic did not look at me.  He remarked absently, but justly,
that the heavy weather was in our pursuer’s favour.  She was three
times our size. What we had to do was to keep our distance till
dark, which we could manage easily, and then haul off to seaward
and consider the situation. But his thoughts seemed to stumble
in the darkness of some not-solved enigma, and soon he fell silent. 
We ran steadily, wing-and-wing.  Cape San Sebastian nearly ahead
seemed to recede from us in the squalls of rain, and come out
again to meet our rush, every time more distinct between the showers.</p>

<p>For my part I was by no means certain that this <em>gabelou</em>
(as our men alluded to her opprobriously) was after us at all. 
There were nautical difficulties in such a view which made me
express the sanguine opinion that she was in all innocence simply
changing her station.  At this Dominic condescended to turn his
head.</p>

<p>"I tell you she is in chase," he affirmed moodily, after one
short glance astern.</p>

<p>I never doubted his opinion.  But with all the ardour of a neophyte
and the pride of an apt learner I was at that time a great nautical
casuist.</p>

<p>"What I can’t understand," I insisted subtly, "is how on earth,
with this wind, she has managed to be just where she was when
we first made her out.  It is clear that she could not, and did
not, gain twelve miles on us during the night.  And there are
other impossibilities. . . ."</p>

<p>Dominic had been sitting motionless, like an inanimate black
cone posed on the stern deck, near the rudder-head, with a small
tassel fluttering on its sharp point, and for a time he preserved
the immobility of his meditation.  Then, bending over with a short
laugh, he gave my ear the bitter fruit of it.  He understood everything
now perfectly.  She was where we had seen her first, not because
she had caught us up, but because we had passed her during the
night while she was already waiting for us, hove-to, most likely,
on our very track.</p>

<p>"Do you understand—already?" Dominic muttered in a fierce undertone.
"Already!  You know we left a good eight hours before we were
expected to leave, otherwise she would have been in time to lie
in wait for us on the other side of the Cape, and"—he snapped
his teeth like a wolf close to my face—"and she would have had
us like—that."</p>

<p>I saw it all plainly enough now.  They had eyes in their heads
and all their wits about them in that craft.  We had passed them
in the dark as they jogged on easily towards their ambush with
the idea that we were yet far behind.  At daylight, however, sighting
a balancelle ahead under a press of canvas, they had made sail
in chase.  But if that was so, then—</p>

<p>Dominic seized my arm.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!  She came out on an information—do you see, it?—on
information. . . . We have been sold—betrayed.  Why?  How?  What
for?  We always paid them all so well on shore. . . . No!  But
it is my head that is going to burst."</p>

<p>He seemed to choke, tugged at the throat button of the cloak,
jumped up open-mouthed as if to hurl curses and denunciation,
but instantly mastered himself, and, wrapping up the cloak closer
about him, sat down on the deck again as quiet as ever.</p>

<p>"Yes, it must be the work of some scoundrel ashore," I observed.</p>

<p>He pulled the edge of the hood well forward over his brow before
he muttered:</p>

<p>"A scoundrel. . . . Yes. . . . It’s evident."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "they can’t get us, that’s clear."</p>

<p>"No," he assented quietly, "they cannot."</p>

<p>We shaved the Cape very close to avoid an adverse current.  On
the other side, by the effect of the land, the wind failed us
so completely for a moment that the <em>Tremolino’s</em> two great
lofty sails hung idle to the masts in the thundering uproar of
the seas breaking upon the shore we had left behind.  And when
the returning gust filled them again, we saw with amazement half
of the new mainsail, which we thought fit to drive the boat under
before giving way, absolutely fly out of the bolt-ropes.  We lowered
the yard at once, and saved it all, but it was no longer a sail;
it was only a heap of soaked strips of canvas cumbering the deck
and weighting the craft.  Dominic gave the order to throw the
whole lot overboard.</p>

<p>I would have had the yard thrown overboard, too, he said, leading
me aft again, "if it had not been for the trouble.  Let no sign
escape you," he continued, lowering his voice, "but I am going
to tell you something terrible.  Listen: I have observed that
the roping stitches on that sail have been cut!  You hear?  Cut
with a knife in many places.  And yet it stood all that time. 
Not enough cut.  That flap did it at last.  What matters it? 
But look! there’s treachery seated on this very deck.  By the
horns of the devil! seated here at our very backs.  Do not turn,
signorine."</p>

<p>We were facing aft then.</p>

<p>"What’s to be done?" I asked, appalled.</p>

<p>"Nothing.  Silence!  Be a man, signorine."</p>

<p>"What else?" I said.</p>

<p>To show I could be a man, I resolved to utter no sound as long
as Dominic himself had the force to keep his lips closed.  Nothing
but silence becomes certain situations.  Moreover, the experience
of treachery seemed to spread a hopeless drowsiness over my thoughts
and senses.  For an hour or more we watched our pursuer surging
out nearer and nearer from amongst the squalls that sometimes
hid her altogether.  But even when not seen, we felt her there
like a knife at our throats.  She gained on us frightfully.  And
the <em>Tremolino</em>, in a fierce breeze and in much smoother
water, swung on easily under her one sail, with something appallingly
careless in the joyous freedom of her motion.  Another half-hour
went by.  I could not stand it any longer.</p>

<p>"They will get the poor barky," I stammered out suddenly, almost
on the verge of tears.</p>

<p>Dominic stirred no more than a carving.  A sense of catastrophic
loneliness overcame my inexperienced soul.  The vision of my companions
passed before me.  The whole Royalist gang was in Monte Carlo
now, I reckoned.  And they appeared to me clear-cut and very small,
with affected voices and stiff gestures, like a procession of
rigid marionettes upon a toy stage.  I gave a start.  What was
this?  A mysterious, remorseless whisper came from within the
motionless black hood at my side.</p>

<p>"<em>Il faul la tuer</em>."</p>

<p>I heard it very well.</p>

<p>"What do you say, Dominic?" I asked, moving nothing but my lips.</p>

<p>And the whisper within the hood repeated mysteriously, "She must
be killed."</p>

<p>My heart began to beat violently.</p>

<p>"That’s it," I faltered out.  "But how?"</p>

<p>"You love her well?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Then you must find the heart for that work too.  You must steer
her yourself, and I shall see to it that she dies quickly, without
leaving as much as a chip behind."</p>

<p>"Can you?" I murmured, fascinated by the black hood turned immovably
over the stern, as if in unlawful communion with that old sea
of magicians, slave-dealers, exiles and warriors, the sea of legends
and terrors, where the mariners of remote antiquity used to hear
the restless shade of an old wanderer weep aloud in the dark.</p>

<p>"I know a rock," whispered the initiated voice within the hood
secretly. "But—caution!  It must be done before our men perceive
what we are about. Whom can we trust now?  A knife drawn across
the fore halyards would bring the foresail down, and put an end
to our liberty in twenty minutes. And the best of our men may
be afraid of drowning.  There is our little boat, but in an affair
like this no one can be sure of being saved."</p>

<p>The voice ceased.  We had started from Barcelona with our dinghy
in tow; afterwards it was too risky to try to get her in, so we
let her take her chance of the seas at the end of a comfortable
scope of rope.  Many times she had seemed to us completely overwhelmed,
but soon we would see her bob up again on a wave, apparently as
buoyant and whole as ever.</p>

<p>"I understand," I said softly.  "Very well, Dominic.  When?"</p>

<p>"Not yet.  We must get a little more in first," answered the
voice from the hood in a ghostly murmur.</p>
