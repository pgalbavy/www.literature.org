<P>They proceeded silently to the centre of the Place, but as
at this very moment the moon had just emerged from behind a
cloud, they thought they might be observed if they remained
on that spot and therefore regained the shade of the
lime-trees.</P>
<P>There were benches here and there; the four gentlemen
stopped near them; at a sign from Athos, Porthos and
D'Artagnan sat down, the two others stood in front of them.</P>
<P>After a few minutes of silent embarrassment, Athos spoke.</P>
<P>&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he said, &quot;our presence here is the best proof
of former friendship; not one of us has failed the others at
this rendezvous; not one has, therefore, to reproach
himself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hear me, count,&quot; replied D'Artagnan; &quot;instead of making
compliments to each other, let us explain our conduct to
each other, like men of right and honest hearts.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I wish for nothing more; have you any cause of complaint
against me or Monsieur d'Herblay? If so, speak out,&quot;
answered Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;I have,&quot; replied D'Artagnan. &quot;When I saw you at your
chateau at Bragelonne, I made certain proposals to you which
you perfectly understood; instead of answering me as a
friend, you played with me as a child; the friendship,
therefore, that you boast of was not broken yesterday by the
shock of swords, but by your dissimulation at your castle.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;D'Artagnan!&quot; said Athos, reproachfully.</P>
<P>&quot;You asked for candor and you have it. You ask what I have
against you; I tell you. And I have the same sincerity to
show you, if you wish, Monsieur d'Herblay; I acted in a
similar way to you and you also deceived me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Really, monsieur, you say strange things,&quot; said Aramis.
&quot;You came seeking me to make to me certain proposals, but
did you make them? No, you sounded me, nothing more. Very
well what did I say to you? that Mazarin was contemptible
and that I wouldn't serve Mazarin. But that is all. Did I
tell you that I wouldn't serve any other? On the contrary, I
gave you to understand, I think, that I adhered to the
princes. We even joked very pleasantly, if I remember
rightly, on the very probable contingency of your being
charged by the cardinal with my arrest. Were you a party
man? There is no doubt of that. Well, why should not we,
too, belong to a party? You had your secret and we had ours;
we didn't exchange them. So much the better; it proves that
we know how to keep our secrets.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do not reproach you, monsieur,&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;'tis
only because Monsieur de la Fere has spoken of friendship
that I question your conduct.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And what do you find in it that is worthy of blame?&quot; asked
Aramis, haughtily.</P>
<P>The blood mounted instantly to the temples of D'Artagnan,
who arose, and replied:</P>
<P>&quot;I consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of Jesuits.&quot;</P>
<P>On seeing D'Artagnan rise, Porthos rose also; these four men
were therefore all standing at the same time, with a
menacing aspect, opposite to each other.</P>
<P>Upon hearing D'Artagnan's reply, Aramis seemed about to draw
his sword, when Athos prevented him.</P>
<P>&quot;D'Artagnan,&quot; he said, &quot;you are here to-night, still
infuriated by yesterday's adventure. I believed your heart
noble enough to enable a friendship of twenty years to
overcome an affront of a quarter of an hour. Come, do you
really think you have anything to say against me? Say it
then; if I am in fault I will avow the error.&quot;</P>
<P>The grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed
to have still its ancient influence, whilst that of Aramis,
which had become harsh and tuneless in his moments of
ill-humor, irritated him. He answered therefore:</P>
<P>&quot;I think, monsieur le comte, that you had something to
communicate to me at your chateau of Bragelonne, and that
gentleman&quot;  -  he pointed to Aramis  -  &quot;had also something to
tell me when I was in his convent. At that time I was not
concerned in the adventure, in the course of which you have
so successfully estopped me! However, because I was prudent
you must not take me for a fool. If I had wished to widen
the breach between those whom Monsieur d'Herblay chooses to
receive with a rope ladder and those whom he receives with a
wooden ladder, I could have spoken out.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What are you meddling with?&quot; cried Aramis, pale with anger,
suspecting that D'Artagnan had acted as a spy on him and had
seen him with Madame de Longueville.</P>
<P>&quot;I never meddle save with what concerns me, and I know how
to make believe that I haven't seen what does not concern
me; but I hate hypocrites, and among that number I place
musketeers who are abbes and abbes who are musketeers; and,&quot;
he added, turning to Porthos &quot;here's a gentleman who's of
the same opinion as myself.&quot;</P>
<P>Porthos, who had not spoken one word, answered merely by a
word and a gesture.</P>
<P>He said &quot;yes&quot; and he put his hand on his sword.</P>
<P>Aramis started back and drew his. D'Artagnan bent forward,
ready either to attack or to stand on his defense.</P>
<P>Athos at that moment extended his hand with the air of
supreme command which characterized him alone, drew out his
sword and the scabbard at the same time, broke the blade in
the sheath on his knee and threw the pieces to his right.
Then turning to Aramis:</P>
<P>&quot;Aramis,&quot; he said, &quot;break your sword.&quot;</P>
<P>Aramis hesitated.</P>
<P>&quot;It must be done,&quot; said Athos; then in a lower and more
gentle voice, he added. &quot;I wish it.&quot;</P>
<P>Then Aramis, paler than before, but subdued by these words,
snapped the serpent blade between his hands, and then
folding his arms, stood trembling with rage.</P>
<P>These proceedings made D'Artagnan and Porthos draw back.
D'Artagnan did not draw his sword; Porthos put his back into
the sheath.</P>
<P>&quot;Never!&quot; exclaimed Athos, raising his right hand to Heaven,
&quot;never! I swear before God, who seeth us, and who, in the
darkness of this night heareth us, never shall my sword
cross yours, never my eye express a glance of anger, nor my
heart a throb of hatred, at you. We lived together, we
loved, we hated together; we shed, we mingled our blood
together, and too probably, I may still add, that there may
be yet a bond between us closer even than that of
friendship; perhaps there may be the bond of crime; for we
four, we once did condemn, judge and slay a human being whom
we had not any right to cut off from this world, although
apparently fitter for hell than for this life. D'Artagnan, I
have always loved you as my son; Porthos, we slept six years
side by side; Aramis is your brother as well as mine, and
Aramis has once loved you, as I love you now and as I have
ever loved you. What can Cardinal Mazarin be to us, to four
men who compelled such a man as Richelieu to act as we
pleased? What is such or such a prince to us, who fixed the
diadem upon a great queen's head? D'Artagnan, I ask your
pardon for having yesterday crossed swords with you; Aramis
does the same to Porthos; now hate me if you can; but for my
own part, I shall ever, even if you do hate me, retain
esteem and friendship for you. I repeat my words, Aramis,
and then, if you desire it, and if they desire it, let us
separate forever from our old friends.&quot;</P>
<P>There was a solemn, though momentary silence, which was
broken by Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;I swear,&quot; he said, with a calm brow and kindly glance, but
in a voice still trembling with recent emotion, &quot;I swear
that I no longer bear animosity to those who were once my
friends. I regret that I ever crossed swords with you,
Porthos; I swear not only that it shall never again be
pointed at your breast, but that in the bottom of my heart
there will never in future be the slightest hostile
sentiment; now, Athos, come.&quot;</P>
<P>Athos was about to retire.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! no! no! do not go away!&quot; exclaimed D'Artagnan, impelled
by one of those irresistible impulses which showed the
nobility of his nature, the native brightness of his
character; &quot;I swear that I would give the last drop of my
blood and the last fragment of my limbs to preserve the
friendship of such a friend as you, Athos  -  of such a man
as you, Aramis.&quot; And he threw himself into the arms of
Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;My son!&quot; exclaimed Athos, pressing him in his arms.</P>
<P>&quot;And as for me,&quot; said Porthos, &quot;I swear nothing, but I'm
choked. Forsooth! If I were obliged to fight against you, I
think I should allow myself to be pierced through and
through, for I never loved any one but you in the wide
world;&quot; and honest Porthos burst into tears as he embraced
Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;My friends,&quot; said Athos, &quot;this is what I expected from such
hearts as yours. Yes, I have said it and I now repeat it:
our destinies are irrevocably united, although we now pursue
divergent roads. I respect your convictions, and whilst we
fight for opposite sides, let us remain friends. Ministers,
princes, kings, will pass away like mountain torrents; civil
war, like a forest flame; but we  -  we shall remain; I have
a presentiment that we shall.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, &quot;let us still be musketeers, and
let us retain as our battle-standard that famous napkin of
the bastion St. Gervais, on which the great cardinal had
three fleurs-de-lis embroidered.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Be it so,&quot; cried Aramis. &quot;Cardinalists or Frondeurs, what
matters it? Let us meet again as capital seconds in a duel,
devoted friends in business, merry companions in our ancient
pleasures.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And whenever,&quot; added Athos, &quot;we meet in battle, at this
word, `Place Royale!' let us put our swords into our left
hands and shake hands with the right, even in the very lust
and music of the hottest carnage.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You speak charmingly,&quot; said Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;And are the first of men!&quot; added D'Artagnan. &quot;You excel us
all.&quot;</P>
<P>Athos smiled with ineffable pleasure.</P>
<P>&quot;'Tis then all settled. Gentlemen, your hands; are we not
pretty good Christians?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Egad!&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;by Heaven! yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We should be so on this occasion, if only to be faithful to
our oath,&quot; said Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, I'm ready to do what you will,&quot; cried Porthos; &quot;even to
swear by Mahomet. Devil take me if I've ever been so happy
as at this moment.&quot;</P>
<P>And he wiped his eyes, still moist.</P>
<P>&quot;Has not one of you a cross?&quot; asked Athos.</P>
<P>Aramis smiled and drew from his vest a cross of diamonds,
which was hung around his neck by a chain of pearls. &quot;Here
is one,&quot; he said.</P>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot; resumed Athos, &quot;swear on this cross, which, in spite
of its magnificent material, is still a cross; swear to be
united in spite of everything, and forever, and may this
oath bind us to each other, and even, also, our descendants!
Does this oath satisfy you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; said they all, with one accord.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, traitor!&quot; muttered D'Artagnan, leaning toward Aramis
and whispering in his ear, &quot;you have made us swear on the
crucifix of a Frondeuse.&quot;</P></div>
