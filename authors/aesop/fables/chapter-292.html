THE HARES, oppressed by their own exceeding timidity and weary of
the perpetual alarm to which they were exposed, with one accord
determined to put an end to themselves and their troubles by
jumping from a lofty precipice into a deep lake below.  As they
scampered off in large numbers to carry out their resolve, the
Frogs lying on the banks of the lake heard the noise of their
feet and rushed helter-skelter to the deep water for safety.  On
seeing the rapid disappearance of the Frogs, one of the Hares
cried out to his companions:  "Stay, my friends, do not do as you
intended; for you now see that there are creatures who are still
more timid than ourselves."
