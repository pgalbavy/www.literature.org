He was startled by a cough close at hand.
<P>
He turned sharply, and peering, saw a small,
hunched-up figure sitting a couple of yards off in the
shadow of the enclosure.
<P>
"Have ye any news? " asked the high-pitched 
wheezy voice of a very old man.
<P>
Graham hesitated." None," he said.
<P>
"I stay here till the lights come again," said the old
man." These blue scoundrels are everywhere--
everywhere."
<P>
Graham's answer was inarticulate assent. He tried
to see the old man but the darkness hid his face. He
wanted very much to respond, to talk, but he did not
know how to begin.
<P>
"Dark and damnable," said the old man suddenly.
"Dark and damnable. Turned out of my room among 
all these dangers."                      
<P>
"That's hard," ventured Graham. "That's hard on
you."
<P>
"Darkness. An old man lost in the darkness. And
all the world gone mad. War and fighting. The
police beaten and rogues abroad. Why don't they
bring some negroes to protect us? . . . No more
dark passages for me. I fell over a dead man."
<P>
"You're safer with company," said the old man, "if
it's company of the right sort," and peered frankly.
He rose suddenly and came towards Graham.
<P>
Apparently the scrutiny was satisfactoy. The old
man sat down as if relieved to be no longer alone.
"Eh!" he said, "but this is a terrible time! War and
fighting, and the dead Iying there--men, strong men,
dying in the dark. Sons! I have three sons. God
knows where they are tonight."
<P>
The voice ceased. Then repeated quavering: "God
knows where they are tonight."
<P>
Graham stood revolving a question that should not
betray his ignorance. Again the old man's voice
ended the pause.
<P>
"This Ostrog will win," he said. "He will win. And
what the world will be like under him no one can
tell. My sons are under the wind-vanes, all three.
One of my daughters-in-law was his mistress for a
while. His mistress! Were not common people.
Though they've sent me to wander tonight and take
my chance. . . . I knew what was going on. Before 
most people. But this darkness! And to fall
over a dead body suddenly in the dark!"
<P>
His wheezy breathing could be heard.
<P>
"Ostrog!" said Graham.
<P>
"The greatest Boss the world has ever seen," said
the voice.
<P>
Graham ransacked his mind. "The Council has few
friends among the people," he hazarded.
<P>
"Few friends. And poor ones at that. They've
had their time. Eh! They should have kept to the
clever ones. But twice they held election. And
Ostrog. And now it has burst out and nothing can
stay it, nothing can stay it. Twice they rejected
Ostrog--Ostrog the Boss. I heard of his rages at
the time--he was terrible. Heaven save them! For
nothing on earth can now, he has raised the Labour
Companies upon them. No one else would have
dared. All the blue canvas armed and marching! He
will go through with it. He will go through."
<P>
He was silent for a little while. "This Sleeper," he
said, and stopped.  
<P>
"Yes," said Graham. "Well?"
<P>
The senile voice sank to a confidential whisper, the
dim, pale face came close. "The real Sleeper--"
<P>
"Yes," said Graham.
<P>
"Died years ago."
<P>
"What? " said Graham, sharply.
<P>
"Years ago. Died. Years ago."
<P>
"You don't say so!" said Graham.
<P>
"I do. I do say so. He died. This Sleeper who's
woke up--they changed in the night. A poor,
drugged insensible creature. But I mustn't tell all I
know. I mustn't tell all I know."
<P>
For a little while he muttered inaudibly. His secret
was too much for him. "I don't know the ones that
put him to sleep--that was before my time--but I
know the man who injected the stimulants and woke
him again. It was ten to one--wake or kill. Wake
or kill. Ostrog's way."
<P>
Graham was so astonished at these things that he
had to interrupt, to make the old man repeat his
words, to re-question vaguely, before he was sure of
the meaning and folly of what he heard. And his
awakening had not been natural! Was that an old
man's senile superstition, too, or had it any truth in it?
Feeling in the dark corners of his memory, he presently 
came on something that might conceivably be
an impression of some such stimulating effect. It
dawned upon him that he had happened upon a lucky
encounter, that at last he might learn something of
the new age. The old man wheezed a while and spat,
and then the piping, reminiscent voice resumed:
<P>
"The first time they rejected him. I've followed
it all."
<P>
"Rejected whom?" said Graham. "The Sleeper?"
<P>
"Sleeper? No. Ostrog. He was terrible--terrible! 
And he was promised then, promised certainly
the next time. Fools they were--not to be more
afraid of him. Now all the city's his millstone, and
such as we dust ground upon it. Dust ground upon
it. Until he set to work--the workers cut each other's
throats, and murdered a Chinaman or a Labour policeman 
at times, and left the rest of us in peace. Dead
bodies! Robbing! Darkness! Such a thing hasn't
been this gross of years. Eh!--but 'tis ill on small
folks when the great fall out! It's ill."
<P>
"Did you say--there had not been what?--for
a gross of years? "
<P>
"Eh?" said the old man.
<P>
The old man said something about clipping his
words, and made him repeat this a third time. "Fighting 
and slaying, and weapons in hand, and fools bawling 
freedom and the like," said the old man. "Not in
all my life has there been that. These are like the old
days--for sure--when the Paris people broke out--
three gross of years ago. That's what I mean hasn't
been. But it's the world's way. It had to come back.
I know. I know. This five years Ostrog has been
working, and there has been trouble and trouble, and
hunger and threats and high talk and arms. Blue canvas 
and murmurs. No one safe. Everything sliding
and slipping. And now here we are! Revolt and
fighting, and the Council come to its end."
<P>
"You are rather well-informed on these things,"
said Graham.
<P>
"I know what I hear. It isn't all Babble Machine
with me."             
<P>
"No," said Graham, wondering what Babble
Machine might be. "And you are certain this Ostrog
--you are certain Ostrog organised this rebellion and
arranged for the waking of the Sleeper? Just to assert
himself--because he was not elected to the Council?
<P>
"Everyone knows that, I should think," said the old
man. "Except--just fools. He meant to be master
somehow. In the Council or not. Everyone who
knows anything knows that. And here we are with
dead bodies Iying in the dark! Why, where have you
been if you haven't heard all about the trouble
between Ostrog and the Verneys? And what do you
think the troubles are about? The Sleeper? Eh?
You think the Sleeper's real and woke of his own
accord--eh? "
<P>
"I'm a dull man, older than I look, and forgetful,"
said Graham." Lots of things that have happened--
especially of late years--. If I was the Sleeper, to tell
you the truth, I couldn't know less about them."
<P>
"Eh!" said the voice." Old, are you? You don't
sound so very old! But its not everyone keeps his
memory to my time of life--truly. But these 
notorious things! But you're not so old as me--not
nearly so old as me. Well! I ought not to judge
other men by myself, perhaps. I'm young--for so
old a man. Maybe you're old for so young."
<P>
"That's it," said Graham. "And I've a queer history. 
I know very little. And history! Practically I
know no history. The Sleeper and Julius Caesar are
all the same to me. It's interesting to hear you talk
of these things."
<P>
"I know a few things," said the old man. "I know
a thing or two. But--. Hark!"
<P>
The two men became silent, listening. There was
heavy thud, a concussion that made their seat shiver.
The passers-by stopped, shouted to one another. The
old man was full of questions; he shouted to a man
who passed near. Graham, emboldened by his example, 
got up and accosted others. None knew what had
happened.
<P>
He returned to the seat and found the old man
muttering vague interrogations in an undertone. For
a while they said nothing to one another.
<P>
The sense of this gigantic struggle, so near and yet
so remote oppressed Graham's imagination. Was
this old man right, was the report of the people right,
and were the revolutionaries winning? Or were they
all in error, and were the red guards driving all before
them? At any time the flood of warfare might pour
into this silent quarter of the city and seize upon him
again. It behooved him to learn all he could while
there was time. He turned suddenly to the old man
with a question and left it unsaid. But his motion
moved the old man to speech again.
<P>
"Eh! but how things work together!" said the old
man." This Sleeper that all the fools put their trust
in! I've the whole history of it--I was always a good
one for histories. When I was a boy - I'm that old--
I used to read printed books. You'd hardly think it.
Likely you've seen none--they rot and dust so--and
the Sanitary Company burns them to make ashlarite.
But they were convenient in their dirty way. Oh I
learnt a lot. These new-fangled Babble Machines--
they don't seem new-fangled to you, eh?--they're
easy to hear, easy to forget. But I've traced all the
Sleeper business from the first."
<P>
"You will scarcely believe it," said Graham slowly,
"I'm so ignorant--I've been so preoccupied in my
own little affairs, my circumstances have been so odd
--I know nothing of this Sleeper's history. Who
was he?"
<P>
"Eh!" said the old man. "I know. I know. He
was a poor nobody, and set on a playful woman, poor
soul! And he fell into a trance. There's the old
things they had, those brown things--silver photo-
graphs--still showing him as he lay, a gross and a
half years ago--a gross and a half of years."
<P>
"Set on a playful woman, poor soul," said Graham
softly to himself, and then aloud, "Yes--well! go on."
<P>
"You must know he had a cousin named Warming
a solitary man without children, who made a big fortune 
speculating in roads--the first Eadhamite roads.
But surely you've heard? No? Why? He bought
all the patent rights and made a big company. In
those days there were grosses of grosses of separate
businesses and business companies. Grosses of
grosses! His roads killed the railroads--the old
things--in two dozen years; he bought up and Eadhaillited' 
the tracks. And because he didn't want to
break up his great property or let in shareholders, he
left it all to the Sleeper, and put it under a Board of
Trustees that he had picked and trained. He knew
then the Sleeper wouldn't wake, that he would go on
sleeping, sleeping till he died. He knew that quite
well! And plump! a man in the United States, who
had lost two sons in a boat accident, followed that up
with another great bequest. His trustees found themselves 
with a dozen myriads of lions'-worth or more
of property at the very beginning."
<P>
"What was his name?"
<P>
"Graham."
<P>
"No, I mean--that American's."
<P>
"Isbister."
<P>
"Isbister!" cried Graham. "Why, I don't even
know the name."
<P>
"Of course not," said the old man. "Of course not.
People don't learn much in the schools nowadays.
But I know all about him. He was a rich American
who went from England, and he left the Sleeper even
more than Warming. How he made it? That I don't
know. Something about pictures by machinery. But
he made it and left it, and so the Council had its start.
It was just a council of trustees at first."
<P>
"And how did it grow?"
<P>
"Eh!--but you're not up to things. Money
attracts money--and twelve brains are better than
one. They played it cleverly. They worked politics 
with money, and kept on adding to the money by
working currency and tariffs. They grew--they
grew. And for years the twelve trustees hid the 
growing of the Sleeper's estate, under double names and
company titles and all that. The Council spread by
title deed, mortgage, share, every political party,
every newspaper, they bought. If you listen to the old
stories you will see the Council growing and growing
Billions and billions of lions at last--the Sleeper's
estate. And all growing out of a whim--out of this
Warming's will, and an accident to Isbister's sons.
<P>
"Men are strange," said the old man. "The strange,
thing to me is how the Council worked together so
long. As many as twelve. But they worked in cliques
from the first. And they've slipped back. In my
young days speaking of the Council was like an ignorant 
man speaking of God. We didn't think they could
do wrong. We didn't know of their women and all
that! Or else I've got wiser.
<P>
"Men are strange," said the old man. "Here are
you, young and ignorant, and me--sevendy years old,
and I might reasonably be forgetting--explaining it
all to you short and clear.
<P>
"Sevendy," he said, "sevendy, and I hear and see--
hear better than I see. And reason clearly, and keep
myself up to all the happenings of things. Sevendy!
<P>
"Life is strange. I was twaindy before Ostrog was
a baby. I remember him long before he'd pushed his
way to the head of the Wind Vanes Control. I've
seen many changes. Eh! I've worn the blue. And at
last I've come to see this crush and darkness and
tumult and dead men carried by in heaps on the ways.
And all his doing! All his doing! "
<P>
His voice died away in scarcely articulate praises of
Ostrog
<P>
Graham thought. "Let me see," he said, "if I have
it right."
<P>
He extended a hand and ticked off points upon his
fingers. "The Sleeper has been asleep--"
<P>
"Changed," said the old man.
<P>
"Perhaps. And meanwhile the Sleeper's property
grew in the hands of Twelve Trustees, until it
swallowed up nearly all the great ownership of the
world. The Twelve Trustees--by virtue of this property 
have become virtually masters of the world.
Because they are the paying power--just as the old
English Parliament used to be--"
<P>
"Eh!" said the old man. "That's so--that's a
good comparison. You're not so--"
<P>
"And now this Ostrog--has suddenly revolutionised 
the world by waking the Sleeper--whom no one
but the superstitious, common people had ever dreamt
would wake again--raising the Sleeper to claim his
property from the Council, after all these years."
<P>
The old man endorsed this statement with a cough.
"It's strange," he said, "to meet a man who learns
these things for the first time tonight."
<P>
"Aye," said Graham, "it's strange."
<P>
"Have you been in a Pleasure City?" said the old
man. "All my life I've longed--" He laughed.
"Even now," he said, "I could enjoy a little fun.
Enjoy seeing things, anyhow. "He mumbled a 
sentence Graham did not understand.
<P>
"The Sleeper--when did he awake?" said Graham
suddenly.
<P>
"Three days ago."
<P>
"Where is he? "
<P>
"Ostrog has him. He escaped from the Council not
four hours ago. My dear sir, where were you at the
time? He was in the hall of the markets--where the
fighting has been. All the city was screaming about
it. All the Babble Machines! Everywhere it was
shouted. Even the fools who speak for the Council
were admitting it. Everyone was rushing off to see
him--everyone was getting arms. Were you drunk
or asleep? And even then! But you're joking!
Surely you're pretending. It was to stop the shouting
of the Babble Machines and prevent the people gathering 
that they turned off the electricity--and put this
damned darkness upon us. Do you mean to say--? "
<P>
"I had heard the Sleeper was rescued," said Graham.
"But--to come back a minute. Are you sure
Ostrog has him?"
<P>
"He won't let him go," said the old man.
<P>
"And the Sleeper. Are you sure he is not genuine?
I have never heard--"
<P>
"So all the fools think. So they think. As if there
wasn't a thousand things that were never heard. I
know Ostrog too well for that. Did I tell you? In
a way I'm a sort of relation of Ostrog's. A sort of
relation. Through my daughter-in-law."
<P>
"I suppose--"
<P>
"Well? "
<P>
"I suppose there's no chance of this Sleeper asserting 
himself. I suppose he's certain to be a puppet--
in Ostrog's hands or the Council's, as soon as the
struggle is over."
<P>
"In Ostrog's hands--certainly. Why shouldn't he
be a puppet? Look at his position. Everything done
for him, every pleasure possible. Why should he want
to assert himself? "
<P>
"What are these Pleasure Cities?" said Graham,
abruptly.
<P>
The old man made him repeat the question. When
at last he was assured of Graham's words, he nudged
him violently. "That's too much," said he. "You're
poking fun at an old man. I've been suspecting you
know more than you pretend."
<P>
"Perhaps I do," said Graham. "But no! why
should I go on acting? No, I do not know what a
Pleasure City is."
<P>
The old man laughed in an intimate way.
<P>
"What is more, I do not know how to read your letters, 
I do not know what money you use, I do not
know what foreign countries there are. I do not know
where I am. I cannot count. I do not know
where to get food, nor drink, nor shelter."
<P>
"Come, come," said the old man, "if you had a
glass of drink, now, would you put it in your ear or
your eye?"
<P>
"I want you to tell me all these things."
<P>
"He, he! Well, gentlemen who dress in silk must
have their fun." A withered hand caressed Graham's
arm for a moment." Silk. Well, well! But, all the
same, I wish I was the man who was put up as the
Sleeper. He'll have a fine time of it. All the pomp
and pleasure. He's a queer looking face. When they
used to let anyone go to see him, I've got tickets and
been. The image of the real one, as the photographs
show him, this substitute used to be. Yellow. But
he'll get fed up. It's a queer world. Think of the luck
of it. The luck of it. I expect he'll be sent to Capri.
It's the best fun for a greener."
<P>
His cough overtook him again. Then he began
mumbling enviously of pleasures and strange delights.
"The luck of it, the luck of it! All my life I've been in
London, hoping to get my chance."
<P>
"But you don't know that the Sleeper died," said
Graham, suddenly.                                            J
<P>
The old man made him repeat his words.
<P>
"Men don't live beyond ten dozen. It's not in the
order of things," said the old man. "I'm not a fool.
Fools may believe it, but not me."
<P>
Graham became angry with the old man's assurance.
"Whether you are a fool or not," he said, "it happens
you are wrong about the Sleeper."
<P>
"Eh? "
<P>
"You are wrong about the Sleeper. I haven't told
you before, but I will tell you now. You are wrong
about the Sleeper."
<P>
"How do you know? I thought you didn't know
anything--not even about Pleasure Cities."
<P>
Graham paused.
<P>
"You don't know," said the old man. "How are
you to know? It's very few men--"
<P>
"I __am__ the Sleeper."
<P>
He had to repeat it.
<P>
There was a brief pause. "There's a silly thing to
say, sir, if you'll excuse me. It might get you into
trouble in a time like this," said the old man.
Graham, slightly dashed, repeated his assertion.
<P>
"I was saying I was the Sleeper. That years and
years ago I did, indeed, fall asleep, in a little 
stonebuilt village, in the days when there were hedgerows,
and villages, and inns, and all the countryside cut up
into little pieces, little fields. Have you never heard
of those days? And it is I--I who speak to you--
who awakened again these four days since."
<P>
"Four days since!--the Sleeper! But they've got
the Sleeper. They have him and they won't let him
go. Nonsense! You've been talking sensibly enough
up to now. I can see it as though I was there. There
will be Lincoln like a keeper just behind him; they
won't let him go about alone. Trust them. You're a
queer fellow. One of these fun pokers. I see now why
you have been clipping your words so oddly, but--"
<P>
He stopped abruptly, and Graham could see his
gesture.
<P>
"As if Ostrog would let the Sleeper run about
alone! No, you're telling that to the wrong man 
altogether. Eh! as if I should believe. What's your
game? And besides, we've been talking of the
Sleeper."
<P>
Graham stood up." Listen," he said. "I am the
Sleeper."
<P>
"You're an odd man," said the old man, "to sit
here in the dark, talking clipped, and telling a lie of
that sort. But--"
<P>
Graham's exasperation fell to laughter. "It is 
preposterous," he cried. "Preposterous. The dream
must end. It gets wilder and wilder. Here am I--in
this damned twilight--I never knew a dream in twilight 
before--an anachronism by two hundred years
and trying to persuade an old fool that I am myself,
and meanwhile-- Ugh! "
<P>
He moved in gusty irritation and went striding. In
a moment the old man was pursuing him. "Eh! but
don't go!" cried the old man. "I'm an old fool, I
know. Don't go. Don't leave me in all this darkness."
<P>
Graham hesitated, stopped. Suddenly the folly of
telling his secret flashed into his mind.
<P>
"I didn't mean to offend you--disbelieving you,"
said the old man coming near. "It's no manner of
harm. Call yourself the Sleeper if it pleases you.
'Tis a foolish trick "
<P>
Graham hesitated, turned abruptly and went on his
way.
<P>
For a time he heard the old man's hobbling pursuit
and his wheezy cries receding. But at last the darkness 
swallowed him, and Graham saw him no more.
