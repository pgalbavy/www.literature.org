<p>You will remember that Alvin Landon and Chester Haynes landed
at Sawyer Island and made their way to the lower end of Barter
Island, where they failed to find the stolen launch. The point
which had caught the attention of Mike Murphy was several miles
distant, on the other side of Sheepscot Bay and half as far from
the landing at Isle of Springs.</p>

<p>While failure attended the efforts of the couple, it now looked
as if good fortune had marked Mike Murphy for its own. He waited
at Isle of Springs until the <em>Nahanada</em> resumed her way
to Boothbay Harbor, when he looked around for some means of getting
to the point on Westport which deeply interested him.</p>

<p>Among the loungers he noticed an elderly man, stoop-shouldered,
thin, without coat or waistcoat, a scraggly tuft of whiskers on
his chin, thumbs thrust behind the lower part of his suspenders
in front, and solely occupied in chewing tobacco and frequently
irrigating the immediately surrounding territory.</p>

<p>"The top of the day to ye!" said Mike, with a military salute.
"Will yer engagements allow ye to take me on a little v'yage?"</p>

<p>The old fellow's stare showed that he did not catch the meaning
of the question.</p>

<p>"Are you axing me to take you out in a boat?" he queried in turn;
"for if you be, I may say that that's 'bout my size. Where do
you want to be tooken?"</p>

<p>Mike pointed across the river.</p>

<p>"You mean Jewett Cove, huh?" said the other.</p>

<p>After a little further talk, Mike found that the place named
was a half mile north of his destination. He explained where he
wished to be landed.</p>

<p>"Sartinly, of course. I kin take you thar, though it's a powerful
row; thar ain't enough breeze to make a sail of any use, and I
don't own a motor boat like some folks round here as is putting
on airs. Yas; I'll take you thar; when do you want to start?"</p>

<p>"As soon as ye can git ready&mdash;but howld on! How much do ye mean
to charge for a little row like that?"</p>

<p>"A little row!" repeated the old man scornfully. "Do you want
me to bring you back?"</p>

<p>"Begorrah! I niver thought of that; I haven't made up me mind,
and ye haven't answered my respictful question."</p>

<p>The other chewed vigorously, spat and finally said:</p>

<p>"It's worth twenty-five cents to take you 'cross and fifteen
more to bring you back."</p>

<p>Mike was astonished. Although his funds were running low, his
natural generosity would not be denied.</p>

<p>"I will pay ye half a dollar to row me over and if ye bring me
back it will be another fifty cints&mdash;but I'm not certain as to
me coming back."</p>

<p>The trip might prove a failure. In fact the more Mike pondered
the more probable seemed such a result. At the wharf a wise precaution
occurred to him.</p>

<p>"Being as there's no saying whin I return, it will be wise for
me to take along a snack of food. So bide ye here till I procure
the same."</p>

<p>He hurried to the nearest grocery store where he bought a couple
of sandwiches and was back in a few minutes.</p>

<p>"I should think" grinned the boatman in an attempt to be facetious,
"that the best place to carry them things is inside."</p>

<p>"Ye're right and ye can make up yer mind that's where they will
find a lodging place by and by. I'm riddy."</p>

<p>The old man bent to his oars and headed across the Sheepscot,
leaving the islet of Whittom on the south, and aiming for a point
due west of Isle of Springs. It was, as he had declared, a long
and hard row, but those muscles had been toughened by years of
toil and seemed tireless. The swaying was slow but as steady as
clockwork, and Mike sitting in the stern admired the rower, who
paused only once and then for but a moment in which to wrench
off with his yellow teeth a chew of tobacco from the plug which
he carried in his pocket.</p>

<p>The shore in front was covered with a vigorous growth of fir,
which, as is so general in Maine, found root to the very water's
edge. The ground sloped upward, but the height was moderate. Mike
had been half inclined to direct the boatman to row directly into
the little bay. This would be the quickest way to decide whether
the <em>Deerfoot</em> was there, but he deemed it wiser to make
a stealthy approach. He wished to descend upon the thieves without
any notice. Besides, if they learned his purpose, they were likely,
as he well knew, to elude him, as they could readily do.</p>

<p>Standing on the shore, he turned to the old man:</p>

<p>"As I obsarved, I'm not sure whether I'll be coming this way
agin. Would ye mind waiting here for three or four days till the
quistion is settled?"</p>

<p>His face was so serious that the other thought he was in earnest.
Mike hastened to explain:</p>

<p>"Tarry until ye obsarve a motor launch comin' out of the cove;
whin ye see the same, ye may go home; all ye have to mind is to
wait and obsarve for mesilf."</p>

<p>The boatman nodded and Mike departed. He moved along the inlet,
which was a great deal broader and deeper than the one visited
by Alvin and Chester later on the same day. He had to thread his
way for two or three hundred yards through the woods where there
was no path, before turning the bend which until then hid the
boat from sight. He was still advancing, all the time in sight
of the sweep of water, when he stopped with the sudden exclamation:</p>

<p>"Woorah, now! but doesn't that beat all creation!"</p>

<p>Good cause indeed had he for excitement, for he saw the stolen
<em>Deerfoot</em> not more than fifty feet away. It was his good
fortune to find it with less than a tenth of the labor and pains
vainly taken by his friends.</p>

<p>He stood for some minutes studying the beautiful model, whose
name he read in artistic letters on the bow. The picture was one
to delight, and it expresses only a small part of his emotions
to say that he was delighted beyond measure.</p>

<p>No person was to be seen on board, and he cautiously pushed on
until he came to the margin of the water. The boat was moored
by a line looped about the small trunk of a tree, that seemed
to be leaning out from the bank as if bending its head for that
purpose, and by the anchor line made fast to the bow. The craft
was as motionless and silent as a tomb.</p>

<p>Quickly succeeding the thrill of pleasure was that of hot rage
against those who had stolen the boat. He was more eager to meet
them than to take possession of the property. But if on board
they would be in sight, for though it was possible for two or
three persons to find cramped quarters for sleep, they would not
avail themselves of such unless driven by necessity.</p>

<p>"They have gone away fur a bit," was the conclusion of Mike,
who the next minute stepped lightly aboard.</p>

<p>"It strikes me that this isn't the best place to linger, as Tim
Hurley said whin the lion jumped out of the cage after him. It
isn't mesilf that has kept an eye on Captain Alvin fur the past
few days without larning how to handle a motor boat."</p>

<p>Whoever had withdrawn the switch plug had left it lying on the
seat used by the steersman. Mike thrust it in place, and going
down into the engine compartment gave a powerful swing to the
heavy fly-wheel. Instantly the engine responded in the way with
which he had become familiar. He seated himself, grasped the steering
wheel and having pushed the control lever forward waited for the
beautiful craft to shoot forward. But though the screw revolved
furiously the boat did not advance a foot.</p>

<p>"That's mighty qu'ar," he muttered, staring about him. "What's
hendering the cratur?"</p>

<p>Still puzzled and with some misgiving, he pulled over the reversing
lever. Instantly the boat drew back, but only for a pace or two
when it halted again, with the prow swinging gently to one side.
Then the lever was moved forward and on the instant the craft
made a dive, only to fetch up so abruptly that Mike came nigh
pitching from his seat.</p>

<p>He rose and anxiously peered around. The explanation suddenly
broke upon him.</p>

<p>"Arrah, I might have knowed I'd forgot something, as Dennis Tiernan
remarked whin he landed in Ameriky and found he had lift his wife
behind in Ireland."</p>

<p>Shutting off the power, Mike sprang ashore, uncoiled the rope
from the trunk and tossed it aboard. He sprang after it and after
taking in the anchor, set the screw revolving again.</p>

<p>There was no trouble now. The <em>Deerfoot</em> curved out into
the bay, and sped forward with arrowy swiftness. Feeling himself
master of the situation, Mike's heart rose with blissful anticipation.</p>

<p>"It's the aisiest thing in the world to run a motor boat like
the <em>Deerfut</em>. All ye have to do is to turn on the power
and kaap things right. Phwat the dickens is <em>that</em>?"</p>

<p>A stone weighing more than a pound whizzed in front of his face,
missing his pug nose by a half inch, and splashed into the bay
beyond. He whirled his head around to learn the meaning and instantly
learned it. Two well-dressed young men were standing on the shore
at the spot where the boat had been moored. One of them had hurled
the missile which missed Mike so narrowly, and the other was in
the act of letting fly with the other. Had not Mike ducked he
would have caught it fair and square.</p>

<p>"Bring that boat back, you thief, and take a pounding!" shouted
one as he stooped to find another stone.</p>

<p>"Begorrah, and that's what I'll do mighty quick!" called back
Mike, shifting the wheel so that the boat began a wide sweeping
curve that would speedily bring her to land again. "If ye'll wait
there foive minutes ye may enj'y the most hivenly shindy of yer
lives."</p>

<p>How he yearned to get within reach of the miscreants, who stopped
their bombardment as if as eager as he for the encounter!</p>

<p>"Have patience, ye spalpeens, and I'll accommodate ye!" called
back Mike, heading straight for the pair.</p>
