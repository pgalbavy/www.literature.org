<p>There was a fairly efficient fire department at the Havens’ hangar, and
by the time Jimmie was out of his bunk, rolling his chums out on the
floor, two streams of water were playing upon the flames.
</p><p>Contrary to the expectation of the incendiaries, there had been several
workmen busy about the office building packing provisions into the
smallest space possible and tying oiled silk tents and clothing for
transportation on the flying machines. Consequently when the fire burst
out at the hangar there was little delay in getting out the firemen.
</p><p>There were thousands of dollars’ worth of property in and about the
office building and hangar, and Mr. Havens not only maintained an
efficient corps of fire fighters but also kept his possessions there
well insured. The fire was extinguished before any damage had been done
except to one wall of the hangar.
</p><p>After the danger was entirely over Mr. Havens and the three boys
gathered in the private room of the office building for the purpose of
discussing the situation. It was easy to see that the boys were all
greatly excited, and that Mr. Havens was decidedly angry.
</p><p>“You see how it is, boys,” the latter said, “you’ll have to fight the
Phillips and Mendosa gang from now until the two murderers are placed in
the electric chair. I fully believe that it was the intention of their
accomplices to not only destroy the aeroplanes but to cause your death.
It is a desperate gang to battle with.”
</p><p>While the boys talked, laying plans for their guidance while journeying
across the continent, Hilton, one of the night-watchmen, knocked softly
on the door and then looked in with a frightened face.
</p><p>“What is it?” asked Havens.
</p><p>“I presume, sir,” the night-watchman answered, “that you heard the shot?
It might have been heard a mile, I think, sir.”
</p><p>“We heard nothing of the kind,” replied Mr. Havens, rather anxiously.
“Tell us something about it.”
</p><p>“It was just after the fire was extinguished,” Hilton replied. “We were
standing by the door of the little fire-apparatus house when we saw a
man sneaking through the shrubbery to the west of the hangar. He turned
and ran the minute he saw that he was discovered, but we caught him—a
measly little dried up kind of a man, with a face like a monkey.”
</p><p>“Where is he now?” asked Havens.
</p><p>“Why, that’s what I came in to tell you about,” Hilton continued,
fumbling with his hat, which he held in front of him with both hands.
“When we caught him, we took him back to the engine-house and began
asking him questions, believing, of course, that it was he who had made
all the trouble.”
</p><p>“And what did he say?” demanded Havens, excitedly.
</p><p>For a moment it seemed that the solution of the fire mystery was at
hand. It was probable that the man caught sneaking about the hangar had
either been responsible for the blaze or had witnessed the act of
incendiarism. They all waited anxiously for Hilton’s reply.
</p><p>“Well, sir,” continued the night-watchman, “we stood him up agin’ the
wall by the engine-house door and tried to frighten him into answering
our questions. He was scared all right!”
</p><p>“But what did he say?” repeated Havens, impatiently.
</p><p>“He didn’t say anything,” was the reply, “and I’ll tell you why he
didn’t say anything. He was under the strong light of the electric in
the ceiling of the engine-house. We were all gathered about him, but
none of us stood in front. Before he could say a word in answer to our
questions, a shot came from out of the darkness and he just crumpled
down on the floor. We thought he was dead.”
</p><p>“Did one of my men shoot him?” asked Havens, angrily.
</p><p>“No, sir,” replied Hilton. “Your men were all gathered in the
engine-house. The shot came from a point south of the hangar.”
</p><p>“Is the man dead?”
</p><p>“That’s what we can’t exactly make out, sir,” the night-watchman
answered. “He lies perfectly still, but sometimes we think we can detect
a flutter of breath at his lips. No, sir, you may be sure that none of
your men shot the fellow.”
</p><p>“Who did shoot him, then?” demanded Jimmie, excitedly.
</p><p>“Wait a moment,” said Havens addressing the night-watchman. “Don’t offer
any theories. Tell us the facts in the case, and then go and see that
the man is not permitted to escape.”
</p><p>“I have told you all I know, sir,” answered Hilton. “It’s just as I tell
you. He was in the strong light near the engine-room door, and a shot
came out of the darkness and he dropped. Your men were all in the
engine-room at the time it happened.”
</p><p>“That’s all!” Havens said, abruptly. “See that the fellow is given every
attention, and also that he does not escape. Perhaps you would better
summon a surgeon. Use the ’phone in the engine-house.”
</p><p>Hilton bowed and turned away, grumbling that workmen were always blamed
for everything that took place, whether they were guilty or not. Mr.
Havens and the boys sat watching each other with astonishment showing in
their eyes for at least a minute after the departure of the
night-watchman. Havens was the first to speak.
</p><p>“What do you make of that, boys?” he asked.
</p><p>“It seems to me to be a problem easy of solution,” Ben answered. “The
men who planned the destruction of the building and the death of those
sleeping in it employed this man to do their dirty work. He set fire to
the building, but didn’t get away in time. The captured man is
undoubtedly a fellow not to be trusted, so the chief incendiary shot him
in order to close his lips.”
</p><p>“It strikes me,” Mr. Havens said, with a laugh, “that you ought to make
a pretty good detective. In my opinion, you have grasped the situation
exactly.”
</p><p>“Oh, Ben is the only original Sherlock Holmes,” laughed Jimmie. “Give
him a piece of rock and a blade of grass and he’ll tell you how the
world was made! He’s got the deduction stunt down to cases!”
</p><p>“You bet he has!” laughed Carl. “Don’t you remember how he figured out
the Devil’s Pool down in Mexico?”
</p><p>“I guess you all had a hand in that Devil’s Pool proposition,” laughed
Ben. “But, honest, now,” he continued, “don’t you think the man was shot
in order to prevent his snitching on his friends?”
</p><p>“He certainly was!” answered Mr. Havens. “And now,” he continued, rising
from his chair and moving toward the door, “it remains for us to
determine whether he is dead. If he is dead, that settles the matter so
far as we’re concerned. If he isn’t, he may be induced by the use of the
third degree to betray his accomplices.”
</p><p>“Huh!” laughed Jimmie. “I wouldn’t put a sheep-stealing dog through the
third degree! They tried it on me once,” he continued, “when they found
me sleeping in a dry goods box in an alley near where a burglary had
been committed. They kept me without sleep or food for two days and two
nights, though they had all I knew about the case the first minute.”
</p><p>“You’re right about the cops,” Carl laughed. “When I write a book
descriptive of the criminal classes in the United States, I’m going to
give the police the place of honor in the book. If anybody should ask
you, you just say that the leading criminal class in the United States
revolves around police headquarters.”
</p><p>Havens smiled at the natural enmity of street boys for the police and
opened the door. As he did so Hilton again made his appearance in the
outer office.
</p><p>“The surgeon will be here directly,” he reported.
</p><p>“How’s the patient?” asked Havens.
</p><p>“Still unconscious,” was the reply, “though he seems to be breathing a
little easier. He’s bleeding pretty badly, though.”
</p><p>“You remain here and watch the office until we come back,” directed
Havens, and in company with the three boys he turned toward the building
where the fire-fighting apparatus was stored.
</p><p>When they reached the place they found the figure of an undersized,
wrinkled-faced man of fifty or more lying on the brick floor of the
room. There was a pool of blood in view, and a wound in the head showed
its source.
</p><p>Half a dozen men were gathered about the still figure, all looking
excited and anxious. Havens bent down and lifted the head from the
floor.
</p><p>“That wound,” he decided, “is by no means a fatal one. In fact, I can’t
understand why he should lie for such a long time in this condition. The
bullet merely cut the scalp, it seems to me. Any of you people ever see
him before?” he asked in a moment.
</p><p>The men shook their heads.
</p><p>“Have you examined his clothing for marks of identification?” asked
Havens, then. “He may have letters or something about him which will
disclose his name and address.”
</p><p>“No, sir,” one of the men answered. “We never thought of that. At
least,” he went on with a shamefaced grin, “I thought of it just as you
came in but, to tell you the truth, I didn’t care to touch him.”
</p><p>Jimmie bent down and ran his fingers hastily through the pockets in the
clothing of the unconscious man.
</p><p>“Not a thing!” he said presently. “Not even a lead pencil or a pocket
knife! The fellow probably left his card case at home,” he added with a
chuckle. “We’ll have to get his number in some other way.”
</p><p>While they stood talking at the door of the engine-house, a surgeon
residing at a village not far away came hastily into the circle of
light. After speaking most respectfully to the millionaire and nodding
carelessly to the boys, he proceeded to make an examination of the
injured man. Havens and the lads stood by waiting anxiously for his
decision.
</p><p>If the man was really likely to die from his wound, that would end all
hope of learning from him the names of those associated with him in the
crime. If the fellow would soon recover, then a clue to the whole chain
forged by the friends of the murderers for the destruction of the boys
might be discovered.
</p><p>“Well?” asked Havens as the surgeon lifted his face in a moment.
</p><p>Instead of answering directly, the surgeon sniffed the air.
</p><p>“You’ve had a fire here?” he questioned.
</p><p>“Never mind the fire now,” said Havens, impatiently. “Give me your
opinion of this man’s condition. Is his wound fatal?”
</p><p>“It is my duty,” said the surgeon, with assumed dignity, “to report this
case to the police instantly. But,” he continued, with a subservient bow
in the direction of the millionaire, “I’ll give you all the information
I can before sending word to the county authorities.”
</p><p>“Holy smoke!” shouted Jimmie. “Why don’t you give it, then?”
</p><p>“Yes, why don’t you give it?” added Carl. “What are you waiting for?”
</p><p>The surgeon regarded the two boys with a glance cold enough to crack the
lenses in his eye glasses and turned back to the millionaire.
</p><p>“The man is not fatally injured,” he announced, with a great deal of
added dignity. “In fact, I can’t understand why he lies so long in this
condition. It can be accounted for, however, on the theory that the
bullet in passing along the surface of the skull drove a splinter of
bone into the brain. In that case, no recovery can reasonably be
expected until after a delicate operation has been performed.”
</p><p>“Well,” Havens decided in a moment, “do you know where there is a
hospital to which the man may be taken immediately?”
</p><p>“There are plenty in New York city, of course,” suggested the surgeon.
</p><p>“But,” returned Havens, “I don’t want him taken to New York city, or
even placed in the custody of the officers of Westchester county. My
desire is that you have him placed in a private hospital and make him
your special charge until you receive different instructions. I have
reasons of my own, of course, for taking this course, all of which you
shall know in due time. Will you do it?”
</p><p>The surgeon replied that he should be most happy to oblige the
millionaire, and in a short time the wounded man was reposing on a cot
in a private room in a private hospital not far from Long Island sound.
</p><p>“And now, boys,” Mr. Havens said after a short time, “the machines are
packed, it only remains for you to take your seats and beat the friends
of Phillips and Mendosa to the Pacific coast.”
