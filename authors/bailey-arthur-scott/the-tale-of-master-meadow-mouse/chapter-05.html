<p>MASTER MEADOW MOUSE had come to Black Creek to enjoy his first swim in
its dark, sluggish water. But when he arrived on the bank he changed his
mind about swimming there that day. For whom should he see but Ferdinand
Frog, sitting on a rock at the edge of the creek.
</p>
<p>For once Master Meadow Mouse was ready to take his mother's advice. She
had told him to beware of Ferdinand Frog and never, never, never to
enter the water when that pleasant gentleman was in it.
</p><p>Ferdinand Frog proved to be as agreeable as ever. When he caught sight
of Master Meadow Mouse Mr. Frog bade him a hearty good morning in a
deep voice which was vastly different from the tiny squeak of the small
person on the bank.
</p><p>"You've come for a swim--haven't you?" said Ferdinand Frog.
</p><p>Master Meadow Mouse admitted that he <u>had</u> intended to swim. But he
explained that the water looked wetter than usual and he thought he'd
wait till another day. "Besides," he added, "the sun has gone under a
cloud and my suit wouldn't dry quickly enough."
</p><p>"Come right in and have your swim!" Mr. Frog urged him. "You can change
your clothes as soon as you get home."
</p><p>"Oh, no--I can't," said Master Meadow Mouse.
</p><p>"Why not?" Mr. Frog asked him.
</p><p>"Because I haven't any more!"
</p><p>"Now, that's a pity," Ferdinand Frog told him. "A handsome youngster
like you ought to have a best suit to wear on special occasions."
</p><p>Master Meadow Mouse looked interested.
</p><p>"I'd like a nice new suit," he replied. "But where am I going to get
it?"
</p><p>"You've come to the right place!" Mr. Frog cried. "Maybe you didn't know
that I'm a tailor. I'll make you a new suit myself!"
</p><p>"That's very kind of you," said Master Meadow Mouse a bit doubtfully.
"But I don't know how I could pay you."
</p><p>The tailor laughed merrily.
</p><p>"Don't you worry about that!" he exclaimed. "I'll get my pay somehow.
And now you must come to my shop at once. I want to take your measure."
</p><p>Mr. Meadow Mouse shook his head.
</p><p>"No!" he told Mr. Frog. "I'm not going to your shop. I'm not going a
single step nearer to you than I am now. I've taken <u>your</u> measure
already, Mr. Frog. I know your game. And you can't catch me that way."
</p><p>For once Ferdinand Frog forgot to laugh. He was so surprised that his
mouth fell wide open as he stared at Master Meadow Mouse.
</p><p>He had an enormous mouth. Master Meadow Mouse shivered slightly as he
looked down Mr. Frog's throat.
</p><p>The tailor closed his mouth almost immediately. For a huge pickerel came
nosing among the lily pads. And spying Mr. Frog, he at once darted
towards him.
</p><p>Mr. Frog swam off in great haste.
</p><p>"That Pickerel person," said Mr. Meadow Mouse aloud, "means to take Mr.
Frog's measure if he can."
