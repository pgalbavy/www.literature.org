<p>Detective Pendar instantly whisked out of the path, among the
undergrowth and under the trees, where he was invisible to one
a foot away. He had heard a faint footfall and the sound was repeated
more distinctly when some one leaped across the rivulet and came
up the gentle declivity. The officer had gone beyond sight of
this open space and the point where the stranger must pass him
was shrouded in darkness.</p>

<p>The watcher would have willed it otherwise, for it was important
that he should gain a glimpse of the other, but time did not permit,
since Pendar could not know how far he would have to hurry over
the trail in order to reach such a favorable spot. The trunk of
the tree beside which he stood was no more motionless than he.
The straining vision saw nothing, but the keen sense of hearing
located the stranger as clearly as if at high noon. He passed
by like one who had no thought of hiding his progress and the
soft footsteps speedily died out.</p>

<p>Before they did so, the officer was back in the path and stealing
after him. Fear of detection caused the detective to linger farther
in the rear than he wished, but if he erred at all, it was wise
that it should be on the side of prudence. Because of the fact
named, Pendar lost several chances of getting a sight of the man.
The pursuer had decided to wait until the cabin was reached.</p>

<p>That was sooner than he expected, for when he thought he was
a considerable way from it he came upon the clearing which had
been described to him by Harvey Hamilton. One annoying part of
the discovery was that he had lingered too long, for the individual
passed through the door in the same moment that Pendar recognized
his location. That which he saw told nothing of the form that
crossed the threshold and was hidden by the closing of the door.</p>

<p>"Well, here I am," was the thought of our friend, "and I must
decide what to do next."</p>

<p>It might have occurred to any one in his situation, that, inasmuch
as he had definitely located the kidnappers, he should hasten
back to Chesterton, summon several plucky men whom he had mentally
selected two days before, and rush the place, showing scant mercy
to the two Italians in town if they ventured to interfere.</p>

<p>But had he discovered the headquarters of the gang?</p>

<p>This question Simmons Pendar asked himself while standing on
the edge of the clearing, and staring at the faintly outlined
cabin on the other side. Although scarcely a shadow of doubt remained,
he felt that that shadow must be removed. He would make further
investigation before returning to the hotel.</p>

<p>It was comparatively early in the evening. There were not enough
moon-rays to show the face of his watch, but it could not be ten
o’clock. A light was burning within the structure, whose interior
was hidden by a curtain drawn across each of the two windows,—one
on either side of the door. All was silent, and the peering eyes
detected no sign of life on the outside.</p>

<p>It was not to be supposed that the abductors of little Grace
Hastings would maintain a guard at the cabin itself. Their pickets
were at a distance, and unless they gave timely notice of the
approach of danger, it would be fatal to the plans of the criminals.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether they keep a dog," was the thought which held
the watcher motionless for a little while; "if they do, he’ll
play the mischief with me."</p>

<p>Could he have been assured that a canine was on watch, the detective
would not have dared to go a step nearer the dwelling, but would
have made all haste to Chesterton and arranged for his raid, since
discovery at this stage of the game would be the end of hope.</p>

<p>"It strikes me that if they have a dog on guard, he ought to
have discovered me by this time—Thunderation! there he comes now!"</p>

<p>A canine as large as a wolf came trotting across the clearing,
heading directly for Simmons Pendar. It was useless to run, for
the terrible brute would have been at his heels in an instant.
He laid his hand on his revolver.</p>

<p>"If he attacks, I’ll shoot him and then the fat will be in the
fire."</p>

<p>While the dog was several paces away and after Pendar had drawn
his weapon from his hip pocket, he spoke in soothing tones to
him. The animal did not bark or growl, but seemed to be pleased
by his friendly greeting. He came on, and the man never used his
persuasive powers more skilfully. He called him all the pet names
he could think of, and when the brute was within reach, reached
out and patted his head.</p>

<p>To his pleased astonishment, he completely won the good will
of the dog, which wagged his bushy tail so energetically that
it swayed his haunches. He whined, snuffed about the man’s knees,
and then abruptly raised one of his big paws, which the eavesdropper
was instant to seize and shake.</p>

<p>"Bully for you!" exclaimed Pendar in a guarded voice; "I don’t
know that your owner would be pleased with your performance, but
I’m mighty sure I am."</p>

<p>He petted him a few minutes longer, when the canine turned about
and trotted back to the house. There he scratched upon the door
and whined until it was opened from within and he passed out of
sight.</p>

<p>"Considered from my point of view," said the detective grimly,
"that dog is a model guardian of a house, but those who expect
vigilance from him probably hold a different opinion."</p>

<p>Nothing could be gained by remaining where he was, for all he
could see was the shadowy outline of a tumble-down log cabin and
a few scattered outbuildings. It was necessary to gain a look
at the interior. The cheap faded curtains at the front windows
shut out any view, but he was hopeful of success from the rear.
He made a careful circuit of the building, keeping at a goodly
distance until he reached a point opposite to that which he had
first held. Then he began stealing forward. Before doing so, he
noticed that neither of the rear windows possessed anything in
the nature of a curtain. He had only to come close to them to
see everything in the room where the light was burning.</p>

<p>Now that the dog was out of the way, even with his friendly disposition,
the detective felt no apprehension, unless there might be some
one on guard—a thing improbable—or a member of the company should
draw near from the direction followed by himself.</p>

<p>The yellow rays of a tallow candle, aided by the moonlight, which
had partial sway on this side of the cabin, made the task easy
for Pendar. He crept steadily forward until under one of the windows,
when he rose to his feet, just far enough to peer over the sill.
Even before doing so, he was troubled by a misgiving. Something
in all this experience was out of keeping with the character of
a band of kidnappers.</p>

<p>The detective’s position could not have been more favorable,
for the face of no one was turned toward the window, where he
might have been discovered. What he saw was this:</p>

<p>Evidently the evening meal had been kept waiting to so late an
hour in order to accommodate the last arrival, who was an old
man, seated at the head of a plain deal table without cover, and
with only several of the plainest dishes of food. Opposite at
the farther end, sat the wife, a bulky, gray-haired, slatternly
woman, presiding over the teapot and a few of the minor articles
of food. The huge dog was sleeping on the floor near the hearth.
On the side of the table, with her back toward the wall, sat a
little girl, probably five or six years old, eating from a bowl
of bread and milk. She was continually chattering, so that her
profile was often shown to Pendar, whose heart sank within him
upon the first good look at her features.</p>

<p>She was not Grace Hastings. The detective carried a cabinet picture
of the stolen child with whose face he was as familiar as with
that of his own child. It showed a chubby, comely little girl,
with abundant curly hair, almost black. The one before him had
straight, scant yellow hair and her face was thin, as if from
recent illness. It would be hard to picture two children of tender
years so different in appearance.</p>

<p>Something in the looks of the head of the family was familiar,
and it took the officer but a few moments to identify him. You
will recall Uncle Tommy, the famous local prophet, who told Harvey
Hamilton what kind of weather to expect, when he descended at
Chesterton. The man was Uncle Tommy and the others were his wife
and child, or possibly a grandchild.</p>

<p>Detective Pendar gave utterance to a forceful exclamation, for
he was filled with rage and chagrin. He would have made affidavit
a few minutes before, and at any time after his talk with the
young aviator, that he had located the headquarters of the gang
of kidnappers, with the recovery of the stolen child only a question
of a few hours.</p>

<p>He had failed utterly. He had reconnoitered the home of a plain,
simple-minded inhabitant, who lived in poverty in this cabin,
and was as innocent of stealing a child as Harvey Hamilton himself.</p>

<p>A faint hope held Pendar where he was for a brief while longer.
It might be that the abductors had made their home in this cabin,
whose owner and wife were under their domination and employ. But
brief reflection showed the officer that no supposition could
be more preposterous. He backed from the window, careless now
whether discovered or not, threaded his course to the trail over
which he had come with so much care, and started on his return
to Chesterton.</p>

<p>"Josh Billings once said it is so easy for a man to be a fool
that he can do so without knowing it. The difference in my case
is that I know it; I’m mighty glad that none of the boys will
ever hear of it."</p>

<p>Bitter as were his reflections they brightened as he strode over
the trail, to the highway leading to the hotel. Something like
hope returned to him.</p>

<p>"I have reason to believe that the gang is somewhere in that
big stretch of woods. Young Hamilton mistook the building, which
can’t be far off. I have learned enough to be sure on that point."</p>

<p>But there was no escaping the terrifying truth that the time
which remained for him to work out any scheme he might formulate
was reduced to hours instead of days. If by midnight of the next
day he was still confronted by failure, he was pledged to board
the westward bound train with his bag containing fifty thousand
dollars, and to throw it off at a point that had been so clearly
described that there could be no mistaking it.</p>

<p>"It looks as if that is all that’s left," he muttered in the
bitterness of spirit, "it’s an infernal shame, but I see little
hope of any other issue." </p>
