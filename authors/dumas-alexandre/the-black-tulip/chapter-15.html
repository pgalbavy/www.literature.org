<P>Gryphus was followed by the mastiff.</P>
<P>The turnkey took the animal round the jail, so that, if 
needs be, he might recognize the prisoners.</P>
<P>&quot;Father,&quot; said Rosa, &quot;here is the famous prison from which 
Mynheer Grotius escaped. You know Mynheer Grotius?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, yes, that rogue Grotius, a friend of that villain 
Barneveldt, whom I saw executed when I was a child. Ah! so 
Grotius; and that's the chamber from which he escaped. Well, 
I'll answer for it that no one shall escape after him in my 
time.&quot;</P>
<P>And thus opening the door, he began in the dark to talk to 
the prisoner.</P>
<P>The dog, on his part, went up to the prisoner, and, 
growling, smelled about his legs just as though to ask him 
what right he had still to be alive, after having left the 
prison in the company of the Recorder and the executioner.</P>
<P>But the fair Rosa called him to her side.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, my master,&quot; said Gryphus, holding up his lantern to 
throw a little light around, &quot;you see in me your new jailer. 
I am head turnkey, and have all the cells under my care. I 
am not vicious, but I'm not to be trifled with, as far as 
discipline goes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My good Master Gryphus, I know you perfectly well,&quot; said 
the prisoner, approaching within the circle of light cast 
around by the lantern.</P>
<P>&quot;Halloa! that's you, Mynheer van Baerle,&quot; said Gryphus. 
&quot;That's you; well, I declare, it's astonishing how people do 
meet.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, yes; and it's really a great pleasure to me, good 
Master Gryphus, to see that your arm is doing well, as you 
are able to hold your lantern with it.&quot;</P>
<P>Gryphus knitted his brow. &quot;Now, that's just it,&quot; he said, 
&quot;people always make blunders in politics. His Highness has 
granted you your life; I'm sure I should never have done 
so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't say so,&quot; replied Cornelius; &quot;why not?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because you are the very man to conspire again. You learned 
people have dealings with the devil.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nonsense, Master Gryphus. Are you dissatisfied with the 
manner in which I have set your arm, or with the price that 
I asked you?&quot; said Cornelius, laughing.</P>
<P>&quot;On the contrary,&quot; growled the jailer, &quot;you have set it only 
too well. There is some witchcraft in this. After six weeks, 
I was able to use it as if nothing had happened, so much so, 
that the doctor of the Buytenhof, who knows his trade well, 
wanted to break it again, to set it in the regular way, and 
promised me that I should have my blessed three months for 
my money before I should be able to move it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And you did not want that?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I said, 'Nay, as long as I can make the sign of the cross 
with that arm' (Gryphus was a Roman Catholic), 'I laugh at 
the devil.'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But if you laugh at the devil, Master Gryphus, you ought 
with so much more reason to laugh at learned people.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, learned people, learned people! Why, I would rather 
have to guard ten soldiers than one scholar. The soldiers 
smoke, guzzle, and get drunk; they are gentle as lambs if 
you only give them brandy or Moselle, but scholars, and 
drink, smoke, and fuddle  -  ah, yes, that's altogether 
different. They keep sober, spend nothing, and have their 
heads always clear to make conspiracies. But I tell you, at 
the very outset, it won't be such an easy matter for you to 
conspire. First of all, you will have no books, no paper, 
and no conjuring book. It's books that helped Mynheer 
Grotius to get off.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I assure you, Master Gryphus,&quot; replied Van Baerle, &quot;that if 
I have entertained the idea of escaping, I most decidedly 
have it no longer.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, well,&quot; said Gryphus, &quot;just look sharp: that's what I 
shall do also. But, for all that, I say his Highness has 
made a great mistake.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not to have cut off my head? thank you, Master Gryphus.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Just so, look whether the Mynheer de Witt don't keep very 
quiet now.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's very shocking what you say now, Master Gryphus,&quot; 
cried Van Baerle, turning away his head to conceal his 
disgust. &quot;You forget that one of those unfortunate gentlemen 
was my friend, and the other my second father.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, but I also remember that the one, as well as the 
other, was a conspirator. And, moreover, I am speaking from 
Christian charity.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, indeed! explain that a little to me, my good Master 
Gryphus. I do not quite understand it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, if you had remained on the block of Master 
Harbruck  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You would not suffer any longer; whereas, I will not 
disguise it from you, I shall lead you a sad life of it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you for the promise, Master Gryphus.&quot;</P>
<P>And whilst the prisoner smiled ironically at the old jailer, 
Rosa, from the outside, answered by a bright smile, which 
carried sweet consolation to the heart of Van Baerle.</P>
<P>Gryphus stepped towards the window.</P>
<P>It was still light enough to see, although indistinctly, 
through the gray haze of the evening, the vast expanse of 
the horizon.</P>
<P>&quot;What view has one from here?&quot; asked Gryphus.</P>
<P>&quot;Why, a very fine and pleasant one,&quot; said Cornelius, looking 
at Rosa.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, yes, too much of a view, too much.&quot;</P>
<P>And at this moment the two pigeons, scared by the sight and 
especially by the voice of the stranger, left their nest, 
and disappeared, quite frightened in the evening mist.</P>
<P>&quot;Halloa! what's this?&quot; cried Gryphus.</P>
<P>&quot;My pigeons,&quot; answered Cornelius.</P>
<P>&quot;Your pigeons,&quot; cried the jailer, &quot;your pigeons! has a 
prisoner anything of his own?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why, then,&quot; said Cornelius, &quot;the pigeons which a merciful 
Father in Heaven has lent to me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So, here we have a breach of the rules already,&quot; replied 
Gryphus. &quot;Pigeons! ah, young man, young man! I'll tell you 
one thing, that before to-morrow is over, your pigeons will 
boil in my pot.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;First of all you should catch them, Master Gryphus. You 
won't allow these pigeons to be mine! Well, I vow they are 
even less yours than mine.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Omittance is no acquittance,&quot; growled the jailer, &quot;and I 
shall certainly wring their necks before twenty-four hours 
are over: you may be sure of that.&quot;</P>
<P>Whilst giving utterance to this ill-natured promise, Gryphus 
put his head out of the window to examine the nest. This 
gave Van Baerle time to run to the door, and squeeze the 
hand of Rosa, who whispered to him,  - </P>
<P>&quot;At nine o'clock this evening.&quot;</P>
<P>Gryphus, quite taken up with the desire of catching the 
pigeons next day, as he had promised he would do, saw and 
heard nothing of this short interlude; and, after having 
closed the window, he took the arm of his daughter, left the 
cell, turned the key twice, drew the bolts, and went off to 
make the same kind promise to the other prisoners.</P>
<P>He had scarcely withdrawn, when Cornelius went to the door 
to listen to the sound of his footsteps, and, as soon as 
they had died away, he ran to the window, and completely 
demolished the nest of the pigeons.</P>
<P>Rather than expose them to the tender mercies of his 
bullying jailer, he drove away for ever those gentle 
messengers to whom he owed the happiness of having seen Rosa 
again.</P>
<P>This visit of the jailer, his brutal threats, and the gloomy 
prospect of the harshness with which, as he had before 
experienced, Gryphus watched his prisoners,  -  all this was 
unable to extinguish in Cornelius the sweet thoughts, and 
especially the sweet hope, which the presence of Rosa had 
reawakened in his heart.</P>
<P>He waited eagerly to hear the clock of the tower of 
Loewestein strike nine.</P>
<P>The last chime was still vibrating through the air, when 
Cornelius heard on the staircase the light step and the 
rustle of the flowing dress of the fair Frisian maid, and 
soon after a light appeared at the little grated window in 
the door, on which the prisoner fixed his earnest gaze.</P>
<P>The shutter opened on the outside.</P>
<P>&quot;Here I am,&quot; said Rosa, out of breath from running up the 
stairs, &quot;here I am.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, my good Rosa.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are then glad to see me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Can you ask? But how did you contrive to get here? tell 
me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Now listen to me. My father falls asleep every evening 
almost immediately after his supper; I then make him lie 
down, a little stupefied with his gin. Don't say anything 
about it, because, thanks to this nap, I shall be able to 
come every evening and chat for an hour with you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, I thank you, Rosa, dear Rosa.&quot;</P>
<P>Saying these words, Cornelius put his face so near the 
little window that Rosa withdrew hers.</P>
<P>&quot;I have brought back to you your bulbs.&quot;</P>
<P>Cornelius's heart leaped with joy. He had not yet dared to 
ask Rosa what she had done with the precious treasure which 
he had intrusted to her.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, you have preserved them, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Did you not give them to me as a thing which was dear to 
you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, but as I have given them to you, it seems to me that 
they belong to you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They would have belonged to me after your death, but, 
fortunately, you are alive now. Oh how I blessed his 
Highness in my heart! If God grants to him all the happiness 
that I have wished him, certainly Prince William will be the 
happiest man on earth. When I looked at the Bible of your 
godfather Cornelius, I was resolved to bring back to you 
your bulbs, only I did not know how to accomplish it. I had, 
however, already formed the plan of going to the 
Stadtholder, to ask from him for my father the appointment 
of jailer of Loewestein, when your housekeeper brought me 
your letter. Oh, how we wept together! But your letter only 
confirmed me the more in my resolution. I then left for 
Leyden, and the rest you know.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What, my dear Rosa, you thought, even before receiving my 
letter, of coming to meet me again?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If I thought of it,&quot; said Rosa, allowing her love to get 
the better of her bashfulness, &quot;I thought of nothing else.&quot;</P>
<P>And, saying these words, Rosa looked so exceedingly pretty, 
that for the second time Cornelius placed his forehead and 
lips against the wire grating; of course, we must presume 
with the laudable desire to thank the young lady.</P>
<P>Rosa, however, drew back as before.</P>
<P>&quot;In truth,&quot; she said, with that coquetry which somehow or 
other is in the heart of every young girl, &quot;I have often 
been sorry that I am not able to read, but never so much so 
as when your housekeeper brought me your letter. I kept the 
paper in my hands, which spoke to other people, and which 
was dumb to poor stupid me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So you have often regretted not being able to read,&quot; said 
Cornelius. &quot;I should just like to know on what occasions.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Troth,&quot; she said, laughing, &quot;to read all the letters which 
were written to me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, you received letters, Rosa?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;By hundreds.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But who wrote to you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who! why, in the first place, all the students who passed 
over the Buytenhof, all the officers who went to parade, all 
the clerks, and even the merchants who saw me at my little 
window.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And what did you do with all these notes, my dear Rosa?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Formerly,&quot; she answered, &quot;I got some friend to read them to 
me, which was capital fun, but since a certain time  -  well, 
what use is it to attend to all this nonsense?  -  since a 
certain time I have burnt them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Since a certain time!&quot; exclaimed Cornelius, with a look 
beaming with love and joy.</P>
<P>Rosa cast down her eyes, blushing. In her sweet confusion, 
she did not observe the lips of Cornelius, which, alas! only 
met the cold wire-grating. Yet, in spite of this obstacle, 
they communicated to the lips of the young girl the glowing 
breath of the most tender kiss.</P>
<P>At this sudden outburst of tenderness, Rosa grew very pale, 
 -  perhaps paler than she had been on the day of the 
execution. She uttered a plaintive sob, closed her fine 
eyes, and fled, trying in vain to still the beating of her 
heart.</P>
<P>And thus Cornelius was again alone.</P>
<P>Rosa had fled so precipitately, that she completely forgot 
to return to Cornelius the three bulbs of the Black Tulip. </P></article>
