<p>At the end of a week George and Victor Shelton had become full-fledged
Blackfoot citizens. Several causes united to bring about this
pleasant state of affairs. In the first place, the boys used tact
and good sense. If the attention they drew to themselves became
annoying at times they did not allow their new friends to see
it. They played with the dusky youths, and were not sorry to find
plenty no older than they who could outrun and outjump them. It
was too cold to go in swimming, but one day when George and Victor
were crossing the stream in front of the village with three other
lads, one of whom was their young friend Smiler, heir apparent
to the Blackfoot throne, the overloaded canoe suddenly sank below
its gunwales, and all had to swim through the icy waters to shore.
Every one of the three arrived first, and Smiler beat them all,
though in this instance I cannot help suspecting that the two
young Blackfeet favored the prince, but they beat the brothers
fairly.</p>

<p>When the weather was good there were sometimes as many as fifty
lads playing on the common or cleared space at the rear of the
village. They indulged in a species of foot-ball, like the modern
game, which was marked by the roughest kind of play. In violence
it sometimes approached our own foot-ball, and blows were often
given and received in the fierce rushing.</p>

<p>On a certain forenoon, in a particularly exciting contest, one
of the players landed a blow on the side of Victor's head, which
sent him sprawling to earth. His quick temper flashed into a flame,
and he leaped up with doubled fists and made for the offender,
who coolly awaited him. A warning cry from George recalled his
brother to his senses, and, instead of attacking his assailant,
he laughingly plunged into the melee, which went on as merrily
as before.</p>

<p>When five Indian youths invited their guests to go on a hunt
the boys took their rifles, but their hosts carried only bows
and arrows. On the return of the tired party at nightfall they
brought the choice portions of three antelopes, two of which were
slain by the youthful Blackfeet, while the one that George Shelton
had brought down received also an effective thrust from an arrow.
The dusky hunters "guyed" the palefaces who could not do as well
as they with their primitive weapons, even though the fire spouted
from the iron tubes and the balls that could not be seen by the
eye carried death farther than did the missiles launched by the
natives. George and Victor took it all in good part, and did not
resent the taunts that were numerous.</p>

<p>Another strong contributing cause to the popularity of the Shelton
boys was Mul-tal-la, He was home but a short time when everyone
in the village knew of the generous hospitality he had received
from the boys and their friends. This appeal to the gratitude
of the Blackfeet produced the best effect. Mul-tal-la and the
messengers, Spink and Jiggers, had something to add, and their
stories of the remarkable young Shawanoe roused much curiosity
to see him and witness some of the exploits of which he was said
to be capable.</p>

<p>Chief Taggarak did not return until nearly a week after the arrival
of the brothers, and then he kept much to himself. He was reserved
and gloomy, and though George and Victor caught several glimpses
of him, and though they continued to make much of his two boys,
for the younger moved about the settlement as freely as the elder,
the great war chief ignored the presence of the visitors until
he had been at home for several days.</p>

<p>One afternoon, after the return of a party from a hunt, Mul-tal-la
appeared at the lodge of George and Victor with word that the
chief wished them to come before him for a talk. The boys knew
so little of the Blackfoot tongue that Mul-tal-la was to act as
interpreter.</p>

<p>"What does he wish with us?" asked George, who, like Victor,
felt some misgiving as to the object of this command.</p>

<p>"Mul-tal-la does not know, but his brothers need have no fear."</p>

<p>"What did he say to you?" asked Victor.</p>

<p>"Only that he wished to see and talk with you. Come with me."</p>

<p>It was about the middle of the afternoon when the lads, under
the lead of their dusky friend, threaded their way among the tepees
to one near the middle of the village, which might be considered
the royal residence. This structure differed from the others in
that it was double the capacity of an ordinary lodge, that one
side consisted of a broad face of rock, that it was in the shape
of a square, supported at two corners by upright poles, the rock
serving as the remaining support. The fire was always kindled
against the base of this mass of stone, an opening just above
serving as an outlet for the smoke.</p>

<p>When the visitors arrived Taggarak was alone, seated at one side
of the large apartment, with a small fire burning in its usual
place. His royal consort and two children were excluded from the
conference.</p>

<p>The war chief was about forty years of age, and his face showed
him to be a man of exceptional ability and mental strength. It
was easy to understand the iron will with which he ruled the turbulent
and warlike Blackfeet. He had thrown aside his blanket and sat
in a close-fitting shirt of deerskin, with girdle at the waist,
and with leggings and moccasins.</p>

<p>Taggarak was not a handsome Indian, but he was of striking mien.
His long black hair, without ornament of any kind, dangled about
his shoulders; his mouth was broad; his nose well formed; his
eyes black and piercing, rather small, and seemed to glitter with
fire from under his eyebrows. His cheek-bones were prominent,
the chin square and firm, and the expression of the countenance
stern to the last degree. Wrinkles already showed in his low,
wide forehead and at the corners of his eyes. There were two scars
on one cheek, and his arms and body, had they been uncovered,
would have revealed many more, for Taggarak was a mighty warrior,
who had beaten down many foes in single combat, and had eagerly
risked his life in resisting the desperate raids made against
his tribe, or in pushing invasions among others of his own race.
Unlike many of his own people, he never was vain enough to wear
the scalp-lock, nor did he disfigure his face with paint. When
he went upon the warpath his enemies speedily found it out, without
any such childish notices.</p>

<p>Mul-tal-la led the way into the imperial wigwam, the brothers
closely following. The three respectfully saluted the chief, who
looked keenly at them as they entered, and, without returning
their greeting, pointed to a pile of furs on the farther side
of the lodge, where the callers seated themselves, removed their
caps, and awaited the pleasure of the great man.</p>

<p>[Illustration: An Ominous Interview.]</p>

<p>You will be better pleased with a free translation of the conversation,
remembering that Mul-tal-la acted as the mouthpiece of the chief
and the boys, though the latter had picked up enough knowledge
of the tongue to catch the meaning of a good many of the words
spoken by Taggarak, who, of course, knew nothing of English.</p>

<p>"My sons have come a long way from the land of the rising sun.
Why did they leave their friends to make so long a journey?"</p>

<p>"We loved Mul-tal-la, and wished to look upon the great and good
chieftain Taggarak, of whom Mul-tal-la said many words of praise."</p>

<p>This reply was made by Victor, and was duly filtrated through
the interpreter, who was pleased with the words so flattering
to himself. It must be admitted that when Victor tried his hand
he showed himself a promising student of diplomacy.</p>

<p>George thought it well to add his answer:</p>

<p>"Hunters told us of the great land that lay toward the setting
sun, and we longed to look upon it, as Mul-tal-la and his friend
longed to look upon the country where we make our home."</p>

<p>"When do my sons go back to their dwelling place?"</p>

<p>"The snows will be deep in the mountains for many moons; the
palefaces will perish if they try to labor through them. They
will wait till the sun melts the snows, and the buds come on the
trees and the singing of the birds trembles in the air. They will
be glad to do this if the great Taggarak is not displeased to
have them stay among his people."</p>

<p>This had the sound of a hint for an invitation. Being such, however,
it failed of its purpose, for the chieftain ignored it. Perhaps
he did not think it worth the trouble to tell the youths they
were welcome; that was to be assumed from the hospitality already
shown them.</p>

<p>"Taggarak has heard of a wonderful warrior who came from the
land of the rising sun. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"He has a horse that he loved, which was lost, and he is searching
for him."</p>

<p>"There are many horses among the Blackfeet; he could have one
of them."</p>

<p>"But there is none like the black stallion of Deerfoot."</p>

<p>"Where did the warrior get him!"</p>

<p>"The stallion was the leader of a drove of wild horses. Deerfoot
sought him out and conquered him without saddle or bridle or the
help of anyone."</p>

<p>This statement seemed so incredible that Mul-tal-la felt it necessary
to add his own statement that the words of the pale-faced lad
were true, for he had seen the exploit of the Shawanoe with his
own eyes. Even then it is to be feared the chieftain refused to
believe the story.</p>

<p>"Are all the Shawanoes like this warrior!"</p>

<p>"There is none like him," was the reply of Victor Shelton, whose
full answer was faithfully translated to Chief Taggarak. "The
Shawanoes, nor Wyandots, nor Chippewas, nor Nez Perces, nor Shoshones,
nor Assiniboines, nor any tribe are as great as the Blackfeet.
Had Deerfoot been a member of any of them, he would have been
the greatest among them all, with the exception of the mighty
Taggarak, whom no one can equal."</p>

<p>Ah, but this youth from the Buckeye State was sly. He looked
at the rigid coppery countenance of the chieftain as these words
were interpreted to him. The youth thought he detected a sparkle
of the small black eyes, but I fear it was only fancy.</p>

<p>"Why is he called Deerfoot?"</p>

<p>"The palefaces gave him that name because no deer can run as
fast as he."</p>

<p>"My sons speak with a double tongue," said the chief, frowning.</p>

<p>"They might in the presence of anyone but Taggarak, but to him
they use only a single tongue. Let the great chieftain wait and
see Deerfoot for himself."</p>

<p>Unquestionably Victor was advancing fast along the path of diplomacy.</p>

<p>"When will the Shawanoe be with the Blackfeet, who wait to welcome
him?"</p>

<p>"We hope not many suns will set before he comes; but he has had
a long way to journey, and may have to slay other warriors that
are not willing to let Deerfoot have his steed."</p>

<p>"The Shawanoe may fall and never see his paleface brothers again."</p>

<p>"We have no fear of that," airily replied George. The next question
of Taggarak was as startling as unexpected:</p>

<p>"Does the Shawanoe teach the religion of the red men or that
of the palefaces?"</p>

<p>The brothers looked significantly at each other as Mul-tal-la
translated these words, but Victor scarcely hesitated in his reply.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot teaches the religion that he believes is true. It is
of a Great Spirit, who wishes his children to live in friendship
with one another; not to make war; to show mercy to all; to be
forgiving and do what they can to make other people happy. Such
is the wish of the Great Spirit. Deerfoot lives according to that
faith, and we believe in it, and try to do as he does."</p>

<p>The chief looked steadily in the face of the youth while he was
speaking, though he did not understand a syllable until it was
properly rendered by Mul-tal-la. Victor gazed as unflinchingly
into the fierce countenance before him, while uttering the noble
sentiments. His self-respect forbade any shrinking on his part
when such a question was put to him. As the interpreter waited
for him to finish, Victor added:</p>

<p>"Tell him exactly what I said."</p>

<p>"And that the answer is from both of us," added George.</p>

<p>Mul-tal-la obeyed, but carefully refrained from saying that he,
too, had accepted the new religion, and that the warriors who
acted as messengers were pondering over it, and had spoken to
some of their comrades on the momentous theme. It is not for us
to censure the red man if he was cautious, for, if need be, he
was ready to die for the truth.</p>

<p>The thin lips of Taggarak curled with scorn when he caught the
full meaning of the reply of the youth. His patience was gone.</p>

<p>"The Shawanoe does not belong to the tribe of Taggarak. My sons,
the palefaces, are of another race; they may believe any lies
they choose, for it is naught to Taggarak. But none of Taggarak's
people shall believe it! And if the Shawanoe seeks to turn them
from the faith of their fathers, the Shawanoe shall die! My sons
will tell the Shawanoe what Taggarak has said, that when he comes
among the Blackfeet he shall live. Taggarak has spoken, and my
sons may go. They will not forget the words of Taggarak."</p>
