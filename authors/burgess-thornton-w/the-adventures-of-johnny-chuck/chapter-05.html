<p>Johnny Chuck was unhappy. Here it was the glad springtime, when
everybody is supposed to be the very happiest, and Johnny Chuck
was unhappy. Why was he unhappy? Well, he hardly knew himself.
He had slept comfortably all the long winter. He had awakened
very, very hungry, but now he had plenty to eat. All about him
the birds were singing or busily at work building new homes. And
still Johnny Chuck felt unhappy. It was dreadful to feel this
way and not have any good reason for it.</p>

<p>One bright morning Johnny Chuck sat on his door-step watching
Drummer the Woodpecker building a new home in the old apple-tree.
Drummer's red head flew back and forth, back and forth, and his
sharp bill cut out tiny bits of wood. It was slow work; it was
hard work. But Drummer seemed happy, very happy indeed. It was
watching Drummer that started Johnny Chuck to thinking about his
own home. He had always thought it a very nice home. He had built
it just as he wanted it. From the doorstep he could look in all
directions over the Green Meadows. It had a front door and a hidden
back door. Yes, it was a very nice home indeed.</p>

<p>But now, all of a sudden, Johnny Chuck became dissatisfied with
his home. It was too near the Lone Little Path. Too many people
knew where it was. It wasn't big enough. The front door ought
to face the other way. Dear me, what a surprising lot of faults
a discontented heart can find with things that have always been
just right! It was so with Johnny Chuck. That house in which he
had spent so many happy days, which had protected him from all
harm, of which he had been so proud when he first built it, was
now the meanest house in the world. If other people had new houses,
why shouldn't he? The more he thought about it, the more dissatisfied
and discontented he became and of course the more unhappy. You
know one cannot be dissatisfied and discontented and happy at
the same time.</p>

<p>Now dissatisfied and discontented people are not at all pleasant
to have around. Johnny Chuck had always been one of the best natured
of all the little meadow people, and everybody liked him. So Jimmy
Skunk didn't know quite what to make of it, when he came down
the Lone Little Path and found Johnny Chuck so out of sorts that
he wouldn't even answer when spoken to.</p>

<p>Jimmy Skunk was feeling very good-natured himself. He had just
had a fine breakfast of fat beetles and he was at peace with all
the world. So he sat down beside Johnny Chuck and began to talk,
just as if Johnny Chuck was his usual good-natured self.</p>

<p>"It's a fine day," said Jimmy Skunk.</p>

<p>Johnny Chuck just sniffed.</p>

<p>"You're looking very fine," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>Johnny just scowled.</p>

<p>"I think you've got the best place on the Green Meadows for a
house,"  said Jimmy, pretending to admire the view.</p>

<p>Johnny scowled harder than ever.</p>

<p>"And such a splendid house!" said Jimmy. "I wish I had one like
it."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you like it! You can have the old thing!" snapped Johnny
Chuck.</p>

<p>"What's that?" demanded Jimmy Skunk, opening his eyes very wide.</p>

<p>"I said that you can have it. I'm going to move," replied Johnny
Chuck.</p>

<p>Now he really hadn't thought of moving until that very minute.
And he didn't know why he had said it. But he had said it, and
because he is an obstinate little fellow he stuck to it.</p>

<p>"When can I move in?" asked Jimmy Skunk, his eyes twinkling.</p>

<p>"Right away, if you want to," replied Johnny Chuck, and swaggered
off down the Lone Little Path, leaving Jimmy Skunk to stare after
him as if he thought Johnny Chuck had suddenly gone crazy, as
indeed he did.</p>
