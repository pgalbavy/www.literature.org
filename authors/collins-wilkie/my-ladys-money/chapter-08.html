<P>
ON the day after Isabel's departure, diligent Mr. Troy set forth
for the Head Office in Whitehall to consult the police on the
question of the missing money. He had previously sent information
of the robbery to the Bank of England, and had also advertised
the loss in the daily newspapers.
<P>
The air was so pleasant, and the sun was so bright, that he
determined on proceeding to his destination on foot. He was
hardly out of sight of his own offices when he was overtaken by a
friend, who was also walking in the direction of Whitehall. This
gentleman was a person of considerable worldly wisdom and
experience; he had been officially associated with cases of
striking and notorious crime, in which Government had lent its
assistance to discover and punish the criminals. The opinion of a
person in this position might be of the greatest value to Mr.
Troy, whose practice as a solicitor had thus far never brought
him into collision with thieves and mysteries. He accordingly
decided, in Isabel's interests, on confiding to his friend the
nature of his errand to the police. Concealing the name, but
concealing nothing else, he described what had happened on the
previous day at Lady Lydiard's house, and then put the question
plainly to his companion.
<P>
"What would you do in my place?"
<P>
"In your place," his friend answered quietly, "I should not waste
time and money in consulting the police."
<P>
"Not consult the police!" exclaimed Mr. Troy in amazement.
"Surely, I have not made myself understood? I am going to the
Head Office; and I have got a letter of introduction to the chief
inspector in the detective department. I am afraid I omitted to
mention that?"
<P>
"It doesn't make any difference," proceeded the other, as coolly
as ever. "You have asked for my advice, and I give you my advice.
Tear up your letter of introduction, and don't stir a step
further in the direction of Whitehall."
<P>
Mr. Troy began to understand. "You don't believe in the detective
police?" he said.
<P>
"Who _can_ believe in them, who reads his newspaper and remembers
what he reads?" his friend rejoined. "Fortunately for the
detective department, the public in general forgets what it
reads. Go to your club, and look at the criminal history of our
own time, recorded in the newspapers. Every crime is more or less
a mystery. You will see that the mysteries which the police
discover are, almost without exception, mysteries made penetrable
by the commonest capacity, through the extraordinary stupidity
exhibited in the means taken to hide the crime. On the other
hand, let the guilty man or woman be a resolute and intelligent
person, capable of setting his (or her) wits fairly against the
wits of the police--in other words, let the mystery really _be_ a
mystery--and cite me a case if you can (a really difficult and
perplexing case) in which the criminal has not escaped. Mind! I
don't charge the police with neglecting their work. No doubt they
do their best, and take the greatest pains in following the
routine to which they have been trained. It is their misfortune,
not their fault, that there is no man of superior intelligence
among them--I mean no man who is capable, in great emergencies,
of placing himself above conventional methods, and following a
new way of his own. There have been such men in the police--men
naturally endowed with that faculty of mental analysis which can
decompose a mystery, resolve it into its component parts, and
find the clue at the bottom, no matter how remote from ordinary
observation it may be. But those men have died, or have retired.
One of them would have been invaluable to you in the case you
have just mentioned to me. As things are, unless you are wrong in
believing in the young lady's innocence, the person who has
stolen that bank-note will be no easy person to find. In my
opinion, there is only one man now in London who is likely to be
of the slightest assistance to you--and he is not in the police."
<P>
"Who is he?" asked Mr. Troy.
<P>
"An old rogue, who was once in your branch of the legal
profession," the friend answered. "You may, perhaps, remember the
name: they call him 'Old Sharon.' "
<P>
"What! The scoundrel who was struck off the Roll of Attorneys,
years since? Is he still alive?"
<P>
"Alive and prospering. He lives in a court or lane running out of
Long Acre, and he offers advice to persons interested in
recovering missing objects of any sort. Whether you have lost
your wife, or lost your cigar-case, Old Sharon is equally useful
to you. He has an inbred capacity for reading the riddle the
right way in cases of mystery, great or small. In short, he
possesses exactly that analytical faculty to which I alluded just
now. I have his address at my office, if you think it worth while
to try him."
<P>
"Who can trust such a man?" Mr. Troy objected. "He would be sure
to deceive me."
<P>
"You are entirely mistaken. Since he was struck off the Rolls Old
Sharon has discovered that the straight way is, on the whole, the
best way, even in a man's own interests. His consultation fee is
a guinea; and he gives a signed estimate beforehand for any
supplementary expenses that may follow. I can tell you (this is,
of course, strictly between ourselves) that the authorities at my
office took his advice in a Government case that puzzled the
police. We approached him, of course, through persons who were to
be trusted to represent us, without betraying the source from
which their instructions were derived; and we found the old
rascal's advice well worth paying for. It is quite likely that he
may not succeed so well in your case. Try the police, by all
means; and, if they fail, why, there is Sharon as a last resort."
<P>
This arrangement commended itself to Mr. Troy's professional
caution. He went on to Whitehall, and he tried the detective
police.
<P>
They at once adopted the obvious conclusion to persons of
ordinary capacity--the conclusion that Isabel was the thief.
<P>
Acting on this conviction, the authorities sent an experienced
woman from the office to Lady Lydiard's house, to examine the
poor girl's clothes and ornaments before they were packed up and
sent after her to her aunt's. The search led to nothing. The only
objects of any value that were discovered had been presents from
Lady Lydiard. No jewelers' or milliners' bills were among the
papers found in her desk. Not a sign of secret extravagance in
dress was to be seen anywhere. Defeated so far, the police
proposed next to have Isabel privately watched. There might be a
prodigal lover somewhere in the background, with ruin staring him
in the face unless he could raise five hundred pounds. Lady
Lydiard (who had only consented to the search under stress of
persuasive argument from Mr. Troy) resented this ingenious idea
as an insult. She declared that if Isabel was watched the girl
should know of it instantly from her own lips. The police
listened with perfect resignation and decorum, and politely
shifted their ground. A certain suspicion (they remarked) always
rested in cases of this sort on the servants. Would her Ladyship
obje ct to private inquiries into the characters and proceedings
of the servants? Her Ladyship instantly objected, in the most
positive terms. Thereupon the "Inspector" asked for a minute's
private conversation with Mr. Troy. "The thief is certainly a
member of Lady Lydiard's household," this functionary remarked,
in his politely-positive way. "If her Ladyship persists in
refusing to let us make the necessary inquiries, our hands are
tied, and the case comes to an end through no fault of ours. If
her Ladyship changes her mind, perhaps you will drop me a line,
sir, to that effect. Good-morning."
<P>
So the experiment of consulting the police came to an untimely
end. The one result obtained was the expression of purblind
opinion by the authorities of the detective department which
pointed to Isabel, or to one of the servants, as the undiscovered
thief. Thinking the matter over in the retirement of his own
office--and not forgetting his promise to Isabel to leave no
means untried of establishing her innocence--Mr. Troy could see
but one alternative left to him. He took up his pen, and wrote to
his friend at the Government office. There was nothing for it now
but to run the risk, and try Old Sharon.
