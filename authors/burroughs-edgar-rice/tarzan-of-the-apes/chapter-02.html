Nor did they have long to wait, for the next morning as
Clayton was emerging on deck for his accustomed walk before
breakfast, a shot rang out, and then another, and another.
<P>
The sight which met his eyes confirmed his worst fears.
Facing the little knot of officers was the entire motley crew
of the Fuwalda, and at their head stood Black Michael.
<P>
At the first volley from the officers the men ran for shelter,
and from points of vantage behind masts, wheel-house and
cabin they returned the fire of the five men who represented
the hated authority of the ship.
<P>
Two of their number had gone down before the captain's
revolver.  They lay where they had fallen between the
combatants.  But then the first mate lunged forward upon his
face, and at a cry of command from Black Michael the mutineers
charged the remaining four.  The crew had been able to muster
but six firearms, so most of them were armed with boat
hooks, axes, hatchets and crowbars.
<P>
The captain had emptied his revolver and was reloading as
the charge was made.  The second mate's gun had jammed,
and so there were but two weapons opposed to the mutineers
as they bore down upon the officers, who now started to give
back before the infuriated rush of their men.
<P>
Both sides were cursing and swearing in a frightful manner,
which, together with the reports of the firearms and the
screams and groans of the wounded, turned the deck of the
Fuwalda to the likeness of a madhouse.
<P>
Before the officers had taken a dozen backward steps the
men were upon them.  An ax in the hands of a burly Negro
cleft the captain from forehead to chin, and an instant later
the others were down: dead or wounded from dozens of
blows and bullet wounds.
<P>
Short and grisly had been the work of the mutineers of the
Fuwalda, and through it all John Clayton had stood leaning
carelessly beside the companionway puffing meditatively upon
his pipe as though he had been but watching an indifferent
cricket match.
<P>
As the last officer went down he thought it was time that
he returned to his wife lest some members of the crew find
her alone below.
<P>
Though outwardly calm and indifferent, Clayton was inwardly
apprehensive and wrought up, for he feared for his wife's
safety at the hands of these ignorant, half-brutes into
whose hands fate had so remorselessly thrown them.
<P>
As he turned to descend the ladder he was surprised to see
his wife standing on the steps almost at his side.
<P>
"How long have you been here, Alice?"
<P>
"Since the beginning," she replied.  "How awful, John.  Oh,
how awful!  What can we hope for at the hands of such as those?"
<P>
"Breakfast, I hope," he answered, smiling bravely in an
attempt to allay her fears.
<P>
"At least," he added, "I'm going to ask them.  Come with
me, Alice.  We must not let them think we expect any but
courteous treatment."
<P>
The men had by this time surrounded the dead and wounded
officers, and without either partiality or compassion
proceeded to throw both living and dead over the sides of
the vessel.  With equal heartlessness they disposed of their
own dead and dying.
<P>
Presently one of the crew spied the approaching Claytons,
and with a cry of:  "Here's two more for the fishes," rushed
toward them with uplifted ax.
<P>
But Black Michael was even quicker, so that the fellow
went down with a bullet in his back before he had taken a
half dozen steps.
<P>
With a loud roar, Black Michael attracted the attention of
the others, and, pointing to Lord and Lady Greystoke, cried:
<P>
"These here are my friends, and they are to be left alone.
D'ye understand?
<P>
"I'm captain of this ship now, an' what I says goes," he
added, turning to Clayton.  "Just keep to yourselves, and
nobody'll harm ye," and he looked threateningly on his fellows.
<P>
The Claytons heeded Black Michael's instructions so well
that they saw but little of the crew and knew nothing of the
plans the men were making.
<P>
Occasionally they heard faint echoes of brawls and quarreling
among the mutineers, and on two occasions the vicious
bark of firearms rang out on the still air.  But Black Michael
was a fit leader for this band of cutthroats, and, withal held
them in fair subjection to his rule.
<P>
On the fifth day following the murder of the ship's officers,
land was sighted by the lookout.  Whether island or mainland,
Black Michael did not know, but he announced to Clayton
that if investigation showed that the place was habitable he
and Lady Greystoke were to be put ashore with their belongings.
<P>
"You'll be all right there for a few months," he explained,
"and by that time we'll have been able to make an inhabited
coast somewhere and scatter a bit.  Then I'll see that yer
gover'ment's notified where you be an' they'll soon send a man-
o'war to fetch ye off.
<P>
"It would be a hard matter to land you in civilization without
a lot o' questions being asked, an' none o' us here has any
very convincin' answers up our sleeves."
<P>
Clayton remonstrated against the inhumanity of landing
them upon an unknown shore to be left to the mercies of
savage beasts, and, possibly, still more savage men.
<P>
But his words were of no avail, and only tended to anger
Black Michael, so he was forced to desist and make the best
he could of a bad situation.
<P>
About three o'clock in the afternoon they came about off a
beautiful wooded shore opposite the mouth of what appeared
to be a land-locked harbor.
<P>
Black Michael sent a small boat filled with men to sound
the entrance in an effort to determine if the Fuwalda
could be safely worked through the entrance.
<P>
In about an hour they returned and reported deep water
through the passage as well as far into the little basin.
<P>
Before dark the barkentine lay peacefully at anchor upon
the bosom of the still, mirror-like surface of the harbor.
<P>
The surrounding shores were beautiful with semitropical
verdure, while in the distance the country rose from the
ocean in hill and tableland, almost uniformly clothed by
primeval forest.
<P>
No signs of habitation were visible, but that the land might
easily support human life was evidenced by the abundant bird
and animal life of which the watchers on the Fuwalda's deck
caught occasional glimpses, as well as by the shimmer of a
little river which emptied into the harbor, insuring fresh
water in plenitude.
<P>
As darkness settled upon the earth, Clayton and Lady
Alice still stood by the ship's rail in silent contemplation of
their future abode.  From the dark shadows of the mighty forest
came the wild calls of savage beasts--the deep roar of the
lion, and, occasionally, the shrill scream of a panther.
<P>
The woman shrank closer to the man in terror-stricken
anticipation of the horrors lying in wait for them in the awful
blackness of the nights to come, when they should be alone
upon that wild and lonely shore.
<P>
Later in the evening Black Michael joined them long
enough to instruct them to make their preparations for landing
on the morrow.  They tried to persuade him to take them
to some more hospitable coast near enough to civilization so
that they might hope to fall into friendly hands.  But no pleas,
or threats, or promises of reward could move him.
<P>
"I am the only man aboard who would not rather see ye
both safely dead, and, while I know that's the sensible way to
make sure of our own necks, yet Black Michael's not the
man to forget a favor.  Ye saved my life once, and in return
I'm goin' to spare yours, but that's all I can do.
<P>
"The men won't stand for any more, and if we don't get ye
landed pretty quick they may even change their minds about
giving ye that much show.  I'll put all yer stuff ashore with ye
as well as cookin' utensils an' some old sails for tents, an'
enough grub to last ye until ye can find fruit and game.
<P>
"With yer guns for protection, ye ought to be able to live
here easy enough until help comes.  When I get safely hid
away I'll see to it that the British gover'ment learns about
where ye be; for the life of me I couldn't tell 'em exactly
where, for I don't know myself.  But they'll find ye all right."
<P>
After he had left them they went silently below, each
wrapped in gloomy forebodings.
<P>
Clayton did not believe that Black Michael had the slightest
intention of notifying the British government of their
whereabouts, nor was he any too sure but that some treachery
was contemplated for the following day when they should
be on shore with the sailors who would have to accompany
them with their belongings.
<P>
Once out of Black Michael's sight any of the men might strike
them down, and still leave Black Michael's conscience clear.
<P>
And even should they escape that fate was it not but to be
faced with far graver dangers?  Alone, he might hope to survive
for years; for he was a strong, athletic man.
<P>
But what of Alice, and that other little life so soon to be
launched amidst the hardships and grave dangers of a primeval world?
<P>
The man shuddered as he meditated upon the awful gravity,
the fearful helplessness, of their situation.  But it was a
merciful Providence which prevented him from foreseeing
the hideous reality which awaited them in the grim depths of
that gloomy wood.
<P>
Early next morning their numerous chests and boxes were
hoisted on deck and lowered to waiting small boats for
transportation to shore.
<P>
There was a great quantity and variety of stuff, as the
Claytons had expected a possible five to eight years' residence
in their new home.  Thus, in addition to the many necessities
they had brought, there were also many luxuries.
<P>
Black Michael was determined that nothing belonging to
the Claytons should be left on board.  Whether out of
compassion for them, or in furtherance of his own self-interests,
it would be difficult to say.
<P>
There was no question but that the presence of property of a
missing British official upon a suspicious vessel would have been
a difficult thing to explain in any civilized port in the world.
<P>
So zealous was he in his efforts to carry out his intentions
that he insisted upon the return of Clayton's revolvers to him
by the sailors in whose possession they were.
<P>
Into the small boats were also loaded salt meats and biscuit,
with a small supply of potatoes and beans, matches, and
cooking vessels, a chest of tools, and the old sails which
Black Michael had promised them.
<P>
As though himself fearing the very thing which Clayton
had suspected, Black Michael accompanied them to shore,
and was the last to leave them when the small boats, having
filled the ship's casks with fresh water, were pushed out
toward the waiting Fuwalda.
<P>
As the boats moved slowly over the smooth waters of the
bay, Clayton and his wife stood silently watching their
departure--in the breasts of both a feeling of impending
disaster and utter hopelessness.
<P>
And behind them, over the edge of a low ridge, other eyes
watched--close set, wicked eyes, gleaming beneath shaggy brows.
<P>
As the Fuwalda passed through the narrow entrance to the
harbor and out of sight behind a projecting point, Lady Alice
threw her arms about Clayton's neck and burst into uncontrolled sobs.
<P>
Bravely had she faced the dangers of the mutiny; with heroic
fortitude she had looked into the terrible future; but now
that the horror of absolute solitude was upon them, her
overwrought nerves gave way, and the reaction came.
<P>
He did not attempt to check her tears.  It were better that
nature have her way in relieving these long-pent emotions, and
it was many minutes before the girl--little more than a child
she was--could again gain mastery of herself.
<P>
"Oh, John," she cried at last, "the horror of it.  What are we
to do?  What are we to do?"
<P>
"There is but one thing to do, Alice," and he spoke as quietly
as though they were sitting in their snug living room at home,
"and that is work.  Work must be our salvation.  We must not
give ourselves time to think, for in that direction lies madness.
<P>
"We must work and wait.  I am sure that relief will come,
and come quickly, when once it is apparent that the Fuwalda
has been lost, even though Black Michael does not keep his
word to us."
<P>
"But John, if it were only you and I," she sobbed, "we
could endure it I know; but--"
<P>
"Yes, dear," he answered, gently, "I have been thinking of
that, also; but we must face it, as we must face whatever
comes, bravely and with the utmost confidence in our ability
to cope with circumstances whatever they may be.
<P>
"Hundreds of thousands of years ago our ancestors of the
dim and distant past faced the same problems which we must
face, possibly in these same primeval forests.  That we are
here today evidences their victory.
<P>
"What they did may we not do?  And even better, for are
we not armed with ages of superior knowledge, and have we
not the means of protection, defense, and sustenance which
science has given us, but of which they were totally ignorant?
What they accomplished, Alice, with instruments and weapons
of stone and bone, surely that may we accomplish also."
<P>
"Ah, John, I wish that I might be a man with a man's
philosophy, but I am but a woman, seeing with my heart rather
than my head, and all that I can see is too horrible, too
unthinkable to put into words.
<P>
"I only hope you are right, John.  I will do my best to be a
brave primeval woman, a fit mate for the primeval man."
<P>
Clayton's first thought was to arrange a sleeping shelter for
the night; something which might serve to protect them from
prowling beasts of prey.
<P>
He opened the box containing his rifles and ammunition,
that they might both be armed against possible attack while
at work, and then together they sought a location for their
first night's sleeping place.
<P>
A hundred yards from the beach was a little level spot,
fairly free of trees; here they decided eventually to build a
permanent house, but for the time being they both thought it
best to construct a little platform in the trees out of reach of
the larger of the savage beasts in whose realm they were.
<P>
To this end Clayton selected four trees which formed a
rectangle about eight feet square, and cutting long branches
from other trees he constructed a framework around them,
about ten feet from the ground, fastening the ends of the
branches securely to the trees by means of rope, a quantity
of which Black Michael had furnished him from the hold of
the Fuwalda.
<P>
Across this framework Clayton placed other smaller
branches quite close together.  This platform he paved with
the huge fronds of elephant's ear which grew in profusion
about them, and over the fronds he laid a great sail folded
into several thicknesses.
<P>
Seven feet higher he constructed a similar, though lighter
platform to serve as roof, and from the sides of this he
suspended the balance of his sailcloth for walls.
<P>
When completed he had a rather snug little nest, to which
he carried their blankets and some of the lighter luggage.
<P>
It was now late in the afternoon, and the balance of the
daylight hours were devoted to the building of a rude ladder
by means of which Lady Alice could mount to her new home.
<P>
All during the day the forest about them had been filled with
excited birds of brilliant plumage, and dancing, chattering
monkeys, who watched these new arrivals and their wonderful
nest building operations with every mark of keenest interest
and fascination.
<P>
Notwithstanding that both Clayton and his wife kept a
sharp lookout they saw nothing of larger animals, though on
two occasions they had seen their little simian neighbors
come screaming and chattering from the near-by ridge, casting
frightened glances back over their little shoulders, and
evincing as plainly as though by speech that they were fleeing
some terrible thing which lay concealed there.
<P>
Just before dusk Clayton finished his ladder, and, filling a
great basin with water from the near-by stream, the two
mounted to the comparative safety of their aerial chamber.
<P>
As it was quite warm, Clayton had left the side curtains
thrown back over the roof, and as they sat, like Turks, upon
their blankets, Lady Alice, straining her eyes into the darkening
shadows of the wood, suddenly reached out and grasped
Clayton's arms.
<P>
"John," she whispered, "look!  What is it, a man?"
<P>
As Clayton turned his eyes in the direction she indicated,
he saw silhouetted dimly against the shadows beyond, a great
figure standing upright upon the ridge.
<P>
For a moment it stood as though listening and then turned
slowly, and melted into the shadows of the jungle.
<P>
"What is it, John?"
<P>
"I do not know, Alice," he answered gravely, "it is too
dark to see so far, and it may have been but a shadow cast by
the rising moon."
<P>
"No, John, if it was not a man it was some huge and grotesque
mockery of man.  Oh, I am afraid."
<P>
He gathered her in his arms, whispering words of courage
and love into her ears.
<P>
Soon after, he lowered the curtain walls, tying them securely
to the trees so that, except for a little opening toward
the beach, they were entirely enclosed.
<P>
As it was now pitch dark within their tiny aerie they lay
down upon their blankets to try to gain, through sleep, a
brief respite of forgetfulness.
<P>
Clayton lay facing the opening at the front, a rifle and a
brace of revolvers at his hand.
<P>
Scarcely had they closed their eyes than the terrifying cry
of a panther rang out from the jungle behind them.  Closer
and closer it came until they could hear the great beast
directly beneath them.  For an hour or more they heard it
sniffing and clawing at the trees which supported their platform,
but at last it roamed away across the beach, where Clayton
could see it clearly in the brilliant moonlight--a great, handsome
beast, the largest he had ever seen.
<P>
During the long hours of darkness they caught but fitful
snatches of sleep, for the night noises of a great jungle
teeming with myriad animal life kept their overwrought nerves
on edge, so that a hundred times they were startled to
wakefulness by piercing screams, or the stealthy moving of
great bodies beneath them.
