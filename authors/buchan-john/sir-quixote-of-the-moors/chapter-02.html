<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I dropped wearily from my horse and stumbled forward to the door.
'Twas close shut, but rays of light came through the chinks at
the foot, and the great light in the further window lit up the
ground for some yards. I knocked loudly with my sword-hilt. Stillness
seemed to reign within, save that from some distant room a faint
sound of men's voices was brought. A most savory smell stole out
to the raw air and revived my hunger with hopes of supper.</p>

<p>Again I knocked, this time rudely, and the door rattled on its
hinges. This brought some signs of life from within. I could hear
a foot on the stone floor of a passage, a bustling as of many
folk running hither and thither, and a great barking of a sheep-dog.
Of a sudden the door was flung open, a warm blaze of light rushed
forth, and I stood blinking before the master of the house.</p>

<p>He was a tall, grizzled man of maybe fifty years, thin, with
a stoop in his back that all hill-folk have, and a face brown
with sun and wind. I judged him fifty, but he may have been younger
by ten years, for in that desert men age the speedier. His dress
was dirty and ragged in many places, and in one hand he carried
a pistol, which he held before him as if for protection. He stared
at me for a second.</p>

<p>"Wha are ye that comes dirlin' here on sic a nicht?" said he,
and I give his speech as I remember it. As he uttered the words,
he looked me keenly in the face, and I felt his thin, cold glance
piercing to the roots of my thoughts. I liked the man ill, for,
what with his lean figure and sour countenance, he was far different
from the jovial, well-groomed fellows who will give you greeting
at any wayside inn from Calais to Bordeaux.</p>

<p>"You ask a strange question, and one little needing answer. If
a man has wandered for hours in bog-holes, he will be in no mind
to stand chaffering at inn doors. I seek a night's lodging for
my horse and myself."</p>

<p>"It's little we can give you, for it's a bare, sinfu' land,"
said he, "but such as I ha'e ye're welcome to. Bide a minute,
and I'll bring a licht to tak' ye to the stable."</p>

<p>He was gone down the passage for a few seconds, and returned
with a rushlight encased against the wind in a wicker covering.
The storm made it flicker and flare till it sent dancing shadows
over the dark walls of the house. The stable lay round by the
back end, and thither poor Saladin and his master stumbled over
a most villainous rough ground. The place, when found, was no
great thing to boast of&mdash;a cold shed, damp with rain, with blaffs
of wind wheezing through it; and I was grieved to think of my
horse's nightly comfort. The host snatched from a rack a truss
of hay, which by its smell was old enough, and tossed it into
the manger. "There ye are, and it's mair than mony a Christian
gets in thae weary days."</p>

<p>Then he led the way back into the house. We entered a draughty
passage with a window at one end, broken in part, through which
streamed the cold air. A turn brought me into a little square
room, where a fire flickered and a low lamp burned on the table.
'Twas so home-like and peaceful that my heart went out to it,
and I thanked my fate for the comfortable lodging I had chanced
on. Mine host stirred the blaze and bade me strip off my wet garments.
He fetched me an armful of rough homespuns, but I cared little
to put them on, so I e'en sat in my shirt and waited on the drying
of my coat. My mother's portrait, the one by Grizot, which I have
had set in gold and wear always near my heart, dangled to my lap,
and I took this for an evil omen. I returned it quick to its place,
the more so because I saw the landlord's lantern-jaw close at
the sight, and his cold eyes twinkle. Had I been wise, too, I
would have stripped my rings from my fingers ere I began this
ill-boding travel, for it does not behoove a gentleman to be sojourning
among beggars with gold about him.</p>

<p>"Have ye come far the day?" the man asked, in his harsh voice.
"Ye're gey-like splashed wi' dirt, so I jalouse ye cam ower the
<em>Angels Ladder</em>."</p>

<p>"Angel's ladder!" quoth I, "devil's ladder I call it! for a more
blackguardly place I have not clapped eyes on since I first mounted
horse."</p>

<p>"<em>Angel's Ladder</em> they call it," said the man, to all
appearance never heeding my words, "for there, mony a year syne,
an holy man of God, one Ebenezer Clavershaws, preached to a goodly
gathering on the shining ladder seen by the patriarch Jacob at
Bethel, which extended from earth to heaven. 'Twas a rich discourse,
and I have it still in my mind."</p>

<p>"'Twas more likely to have been a way to the Evil One for me.
Had I but gone a further step many a time, I should have been
giving my account ere this to my Maker. But a truce to this talk.
'Twas not to listen to such that I came here; let me have supper,
the best you have, and a bottle of whatever wine you keep in this
accursed place. Burgundy is my choice."</p>

<p>"Young man," the fellow said gravely, looking at me with his
unpleasing eyes, "you are one who loves the meat that perisheth
rather than the unsearchable riches of God's grace. Oh, be warned
while yet there is time. You know not the delights of gladsome
communion wi' Him, which makes the moss-hags and heather-bushes
more fair than the roses of Sharon or the balmy plains of Gilead.
Oh, be wise and turn, for now is the accepted time, now is the
day of salvation!"</p>

<p><em>Sacr√©!</em> what madman have I fallen in with, thought I,
who talks in this fashion. I had heard of the wild deeds of those
in our own land who call themselves Huguenots, and I was not altogether
without fear. But my appetite was keen, and my blood was never
of the coolest.</p>

<p>"Peace with your nonsense, sirrah," I said sternly; "what man
are you who come and prate before your guests, instead of fetching
their supper? Let me have mine at once, and no more of your Scripture."</p>

<p>As I spoke, I looked him angrily in the face, and my bearing
must have had some effect upon him, for he turned suddenly and
passed out.</p>

<p>A wench appeared, a comely slip of a girl, with eyes somewhat
dazed and timorous, and set the table with viands. There was a
moor-fowl, well-roasted and tasty to the palate, a cut of salted
beef, and for wine, a bottle of French claret of excellent quality.
'Twas so much in excess of my expectation, that I straightway
fell into a good humor, and the black cloud of dismay lifted in
some degree from my wits. I filled my glass and looked at it against
the fire-glow, and dreamed that 'twas an emblem of the after course
of my life. Who knew what fine things I might come to yet, though
now I was solitary in a strange land?</p>

<p>The landlord came in and took away the remnants himself. He looked
at me fixedly more than once, and in his glance I read madness,
greed, and hatred. I feared his look, and was glad to see him
leave, for he made me feel angry and a little awed. However, thought
I, 'tis not the first time I have met a churlish host, and I filled
my glass again.</p>

<p>The fire bickered cheerily, lighting up the room and comforting
my cold skin. I drew my chair close and stretched out my legs
to the blaze, till in a little, betwixt heat and weariness, I
was pleasantly drowsy. I fell to thinking of the events of the
day and the weary road I had traveled; then to an earlier time,
when I first came to Scotland, and my hopes were still unbroken.
After all this I began to mind me of the pleasant days in France;
for, though I had often fared ill enough there, all was forgotten
but the good fortune; and I had soon built out of my brain a France
which was liker Paradise than anywhere on earth. Every now and
then a log would crackle or fall, and so wake me with a start,
for the fire was of that sort which is common in hilly places&mdash;a
great bank of peat with wood laid athwart. Blue, pungent smoke
came out in rings and clouds, which smelt gratefully in my nostrils
after the black out-of-doors.</p>

<p>By and by, what with thinking of the past, what with my present
comfort, and what with an ever hopeful imagination, my prospects
came to look less dismal. 'Twas true that I was here in a most
unfriendly land with little money and no skill of the country.
But Scotland was but a little place, after all. I must come to
Leith in time, where I could surely meet a French skipper who
would take me over, money or no. You will ask, whoever may chance
to read this narrative, why, in Heaven's name, I did not turn
and go back to Ayr, the port from which I had come? The reason
is not far to seek. The whole land behind me stank in my nostrils,
for there dwelt Quentin Kennedy, and there lay the scene of my
discomfiture and my sufferings. Faugh! the smell of that wretched
moor road is with me yet. So, with thinking one way and another,
I came to a decision to go forward in any case, and trust to God
and my own good fortune. After this I must have ceased to have
any thoughts, and dropped off snugly to sleep.</p>

<p>I wakened, at what time I know not, shivering, with a black fire
before my knees. The room was black with darkness, save where
through a chink in the window-shutter there came a gleam of pale
moonlight. I sprang up in haste and called for a servant to show
me to my sleeping room, but the next second I could have wished
the word back, for I feared that no servant would be awake and
at hand. To my mind there seemed something passing strange in
thus leaving a guest to slumber by the fire.</p>

<p>To my amazement, the landlord himself came to my call, bearing
a light in his hand. I was reasonably surprised, for though I
knew not the hour of the night, I judged from the state of the
fire that it must have been far advanced. "I had fallen asleep,"
I said, in apology, "and now would finish what I have begun. Show
me my bed."</p>

<p>"It'll be a dark nicht and a coorse, out-bye," said the man,
as he led the way solemnly from the room, up a rickety stair,
down a mirk passage to a chamber which, from the turnings of the
house, I guessed to be facing the east. 'Twas a comfortless place,
and ere I could add a word I found the man leaving the room with
the light. "You'll find your way to bed in the dark," quoth he,
and I was left in blackness.</p>

<p>I sat down on the edge of the bed, half-stupid with sleep, my
teeth chattering with the cold, listening to the gusts of wind
battering against the little window. 'Faith! thought I, this is
the worst entertainment I ever had, and I have made trial of many.
Yet I need not complain, for I have had a good fire and a royal
supper, and my present dis-comfort is due in great part to my
own ill habit of drowsiness. I rose to undress, for my bones were
sore after the long day's riding, when, by some chance, I moved
forward to the window and opened it to look on the night.</p>

<p>'Twas wintry weather outside, though but the month of August.
The face of the hills fronting me were swathed in white mist,
which hung low even to the banks of the stream. There was a great
muttering in the air of swollen water, for the rain had ceased,
and the red waves were left to roll down the channel to the lowlands
and make havoc of meadow and steading. The sky was cumbered with
clouds, and no clear light of the moon came through; but since
'twas nigh the time of the full moon the night was not utterly
dark.</p>

<p>I lingered for maybe five minutes in this posture, and then I
heard that which made me draw in my head and listen the more intently.
A thud of horses' hoofs on the wet ground came to my ear. A second,
and it was plainer, the noise of some half-dozen riders clearly
approaching the inn. 'Twas a lonesome place, and I judged it strange
that company should come so late.</p>

<p>I flung myself on the bed in my clothes, and could almost have
fallen asleep as I was, so weary was my body. But there was that
in my mind which forbade slumber, a vague uneasiness as of some
ill approaching, which it behooved me to combat. Again and again
I tried to drive it from me as mere cowardice, but again it returned
to vex me. There was nothing for it but that I should lie on my
back and bide what might come.</p>

<p>Then again I heard a sound, this time from a room beneath. 'Twas
as if men were talking softly, and moving to and fro. My curiosity
was completely aroused, and I thought it no shame to my soldierly
honor to slip from my room and gather what was the purport of
their talk. At such a time, and in such a place, it boded no good
for me, and the evil face of the landlord was ever in my memory.
The staircase creaked a little as it felt my weight, but it had
been built for heavier men, and I passed it in safety. Clearly
the visitors were in the room where I had supped.</p>

<p>"Will we ha'e muckle wark wi' him, think ye?" I heard one man
ask.</p>

<p>"Na, na," said another, whom I knew for mine host, "he's a foreigner,
a man frae a fremt land, and a' folk ken they're little use. Forbye,
I had stock o' him mysel', and I think I could mak' his bit ribs
crack thegither. He'll no' be an ill customer to deal wi'."</p>

<p>"But will he no' be a guid hand at the swird? There's no yin
o' us here muckle at that."</p>

<p>"Toots," said another, "we'll e'en get him intil a corner, where
he'll no git leave to stir an airm."</p>

<p>I had no stomach for more. With a dull sense of fear I crept
back to my room, scarce heeding in my anger whether I made noise
or not. Good God! thought I, I have traveled by land and sea to
die in a moorland alehouse by the hand of common robbers! My heart
grew hot at the thought of the landlord, for I made no doubt but
it was my jewels that had first set his teeth. I loosened my sword
in its scabbard; and now I come to think of it,'twas a great wonder
that it had not been taken away from me while I slept. I could
only guess that the man had been afraid to approach me before
the arrival of his confederates. I gripped my sword-hilt; ah,
how often had I felt its touch under kindlier circumstances&mdash;when
I slew the boar in the woods at Belmont, when I made the Sieur
de Biran crave pardon before my feet, when <em>I-&</em>mdash;But
peace with such memories! At all events, if Jean de Rohaine must
die among ruffians, unknown and forgotten, he would finish his
days like a gentleman of courage. I prayed to God that I might
only have the life of the leader.</p>

<p>But this world is sweet to all men, and as I awaited death in
that dark room, it seemed especially fair to live. I was but in
the prime of my age, on the near side of forty, hale in body,
a master of the arts and graces. Were it not passing hard that
I should perish in this wise? I looked every way for a means of
escape. There was but one&mdash;the little window which looked upon
the ground east of the inn. 'Twas just conceivable that a man
might leap it and make his way to the hills, and so baffle his
pursuers. Two thoughts deterred me; first, that I had no horse
and could not continue my journey; second, that in all likelihood
there would be a watch set below. My heart sank within me, and
I ceased to think.</p>

<p>For, just at that moment, I heard a noise below as of men leaving
the room. I shut my lips and waited. Here, I concluded, is death
coming to meet me. But the next moment the noise had stopped,
and 'twas evident that the conclave was not yet closed. 'Tis a
strange thing, the mind of man, for I, who had looked with despair
at my chances a minute agone, now, at the passing of this immediate
danger, plucked up heart, clapped my hat on my head, and opened
the window.</p>

<p>The night air blew chill, but all seemed silent below. So, very
carefully I hung over the ledge, gripped the sill with my hands,
swung my legs into the air, and dropped. I lighted on a tussock
of grass and rolled over on my side, only to recover myself in
an instant and rise to my feet, and, behold, at my side, a tall
man keeping sentinel on horseback.</p>

<p>At this the last flicker of hope died in my bosom. The man never
moved or spake, but only stared fixedly at me. Yet there was that
in his face and bearing which led me to act as I did.</p>

<p>"If you are a man of honor," I burst out, "though you are engaged
in an accursed trade, dismount and meet me in combat. Your spawn
will not be out for a little time, and the night is none so dark.
If I must die, I would die at least in the open air, with my foe
before me."</p>

<p>My words must have found some answering chord in the man's breast,
for he presently spoke, and asked me my name and errand in the
countryside. I told him in a dozen words, and at my tale he shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I am in a great mind," says he, "to let you go. I am all but
sick of this butcher work, and would fling it to the winds at
a word. 'Tis well enough for the others, who are mongrel bred,
but it ill becomes a man of birth like me, who am own cousin to
the Maxwells o' Drurie."</p>

<p>He fell for a very little time into a sort of musing, tugging
at his beard like a man in perplexity. Then he spoke out suddenly:</p>

<p>"See you yon tuft of willows by the water? There's a space behind
it where a horse and man might stand well concealed. There is
your horse," and he pointed to a group of horses standing tethered
by the roadside; "lead him to the place I speak of, and trust
to God for the rest. I will raise a scare that you're off the
other airt, and, mind, that whenever you see the tails o' us,
you mount and ride for life in the way I tell you. You should
win to Drumlanrig by morning, where there are quieter folk. Now,
mind my bidding, and dae't before my good will changes."</p>

<p>"May God do so to you in your extremity! If ever I meet you on
earth I will repay you for your mercy. But a word with you. Who
is that man?" and I pointed to the house.</p>

<p>The fellow laughed dryly. "It's easy seen you're no acquaint
here, or you would ha'e heard o' Long Jock o' the Hirsel. There's
mony a man would face the devil wi' a regiment o' dragoons at
his back, that would flee at a glint from Jock's een. You're weel
quit o' him. But be aff afore the folk are stirring."</p>

<p>I needed no second bidding, but led Saladin with all speed to
the willows, where I made him stand knee-deep in the water within
cover of the trees, while I crouched by his side. 'Twas none too
soon, for I was scarce in hiding when I heard a great racket in
the house, and the sound of men swearing and mounting horse. There
was a loud clattering of hoofs, which shortly died away, and left
the world quiet, save for the broil of the stream and the loud
screaming of moorbirds.</p>
