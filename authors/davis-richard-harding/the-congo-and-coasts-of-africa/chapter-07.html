<p>Were a man picked up on a flying carpet and dropped without warning
into Lorenço Marquez, he might guess for a day before he could make
up his mind where he was, or determine to which nation the place
belonged.
</p>
<p>If he argued from the adobe houses with red-tiled roofs and walls of
cobalt blue, the palms, and the yellow custom-house, he might think
he was in Santiago; the Indian merchants in velvet and gold
embroideries seated in deep, dark shops which breathe out dry,
pungent odors, might take him back to Bombay; the Soudanese and
Egyptians in long blue night-gowns and freshly ironed fezzes would
remind him of Cairo; the dwarfish Portuguese soldiers, of Madeira,
Lisbon, and Madrid, and the black, bare-legged policemen in khaki
with great numerals on their chests, of Benin, Sierra Leone, or
Zanzibar. After he had noted these and the German, French, and
English merchants in white duck, and the Dutch man-of-warsmen, who
look like ship's stewards, the French marines in coal-scuttle
helmets, the British Jack-tars in their bare feet, and the native
Kaffir women, each wrapped in a single, gorgeous shawl with a black
baby peering from beneath her shoulder-blades, he would decide, by
using the deductive methods of Sherlock Holmes, that he was in the
Midway of the Chicago Fair.
</p><p>Several hundred years ago Da Gama sailed into Delagoa Bay and
founded the town of Lorenço Marquez, and since that time the
Portuguese have always felt that it is only due to him and to
themselves to remain there. They have great pride of race, and they
like the fact that they possess and govern a colony. So, up to the
present time, in spite of many temptations to dispose of it, they
have made the ownership of Delagoa Bay an article of their national
religion. But their national religion does not require of them to
improve their property. And to-day it is much as it was when the
sails of Da Gama's fleet first stirred its poisonous vapors.
</p><p>The harbor itself is an excellent one and the bay is twenty-two
miles along, but there is only one landing-pier, and that such a
pier as would be considered inconsistent with the dignity of the
Larchmont Yacht Club. To the town itself Portugal has been content
to contribute as her share the gatherers of taxes, collectors of
customs and dispensers of official seals. She is indifferent to the
fact that the bulk of general merchandise, wine, and machinery that
enter her port is brought there by foreigners. She only demands that
they buy her stamps. Her importance in her own colony is that of a
toll-gate at the entrance of a great city.
</p><p>Lorenço Marquez is not a spot which one would select for a home.
When I was first there, the deaths from fever were averaging fifteen
a day, and men who dined at the club one evening were buried
hurriedly before midnight, and when I returned in the winter months,
the fever had abated, but on the night we arrived twenty men were
robbed. The fact that we complained to the police about one of the
twenty robberies struck the commandant as an act of surprising and
unusual interest. We gathered from his manner that the citizens of
Lorenço Marquez look upon being robbed as a matter too personal and
selfish with which to trouble the police. It was perhaps credulous
of us, as our hotel was liberally labelled with notices warning its
patrons that "Owing to numerous robberies in this hotel, our guests
will please lock their doors." This was one of three hotels owned by
the same man. One of the others had been described to us as the
"tough" hotel, and at the other, a few weeks previous, a friend had
found a puff-adder barring his bedroom door. The choice was somewhat
difficult.
</p><p>On her way from Lorenço Marquez to Beira our ship, the <u>Kanzlar</u>,
kept close to the shore, and showed us low-lying banks of yellow
sand and coarse green bushes. There was none of the majesty of
outline which reaches from Table Bay to Durban, none of the blue
mountains of the Colony, nor the deeply wooded table-lands and great
inlets of Kaffraria. The rocks which stretch along the southern
coast and against which the waves break with a report like the
bursting of a lyddite shell, had disappeared, and along Gazaland and
the Portuguese territory only swamps and barren sand-hills
accompanied us in a monotonous yellow line. From the bay we saw
Beira as a long crescent of red-roofed houses, many of them of four
stories with verandas running around each story, like those of the
summer hotels along the Jersey coast. It is a town built upon the
sands, with a low stone breakwater, but without a pier or jetty, the
lack of which gives it a temporary, casual air as though it were
more a summer resort than the one port of entry for all Rhodesia. It
suggested Coney Island to one, and to others Asbury Park and the
board-walk at Atlantic City. When we found that in spite of her
Portuguese flags and naked blacks, Beira reminded us of nothing
except an American summer-resort, we set to discovering why this
should be, and decided it was because, after the red dust of the
Colony and the Transvaal, we saw again stretches of white sand, and
instead of corrugated zinc, flimsy houses of wood, which you felt
were only opened for the summer season and which for the rest of
the year remained boarded up against driven sands and equinoctial
gales. Beira need only to have added to her "Sea-View" and "Beach"
hotels, a few bathing-suits drying on a clothes-line, a tin-type
artist, and a merry-go-round, to make us feel perfectly at home.
Beira being the port on the Indian Ocean which feeds Mashonaland and
Matabeleland and the English settlers in and around Buluwayo and
Salisbury, English influence has proclaimed itself there in many
ways. When we touched, which was when the British soldiers were
moving up to Rhodesia, the place, in comparison with Lorenço
Marquez, was brisk, busy, and clean. Although both are ostensibly
Portuguese, Beira is to Lorenço Marquez what the cleanest street of
Greenwich Village, of New York City, is to "Hell's Kitchen" and the
Chinese Quarter. The houses were well swept and cool, the shops were
alluring, the streets were of clean shifting white sand, and the
sidewalks, of gray cement, were as well kept as a Philadelphia
doorstep. The most curious feature of Beira is her private tram-car
system. These cars run on tiny tracks which rise out of the sand
and extend from one end of the town to the other, with branch lines
running into the yards of shops and private houses. The motive power
for these cars is supplied by black boys who run behind and push
them. Their trucks are about half as large as those on the hand-cars
we see flying along our railroad tracks at home, worked by gangs of
Italian laborers. On some of the trucks there is only a bench,
others are shaded by awnings, and a few have carriage-lamps and
cushioned seats and carpets. Each of them is a private conveyance;
there is not one which can be hired by the public. When a merchant
wishes to go down town to the port, his black boys carry his private
tram-car from his garden and settle it on the rails, the merchant
seats himself, and the boys push him and his baby-carriage to
whatever part of the city he wishes to go. When his wife is out
shopping and stops at a store the boys lift her car into the sand in
order to make a clear track for any other car which may be coming
behind them. One would naturally suppose that with the tracks and
switch-boards and sidings already laid, the next step would be to
place cars upon them for the convenience of the public, but this is
not the case, and the tracks through the city are jealously reserved
for the individuals who tax themselves five pounds a year to extend
them and to keep them in repair. After the sleds on the island of
Madeira these private street-cars of Beira struck me as being the
most curious form of conveyance I had ever seen.
</p><p> [Illustration: Going Visiting in Her Private Tram-car at Beira.]
</p><p>Beira was occupied by the Companhia de Mozambique with the idea of
feeding Salisbury and Buluwayo from the north, and drawing away some
of the trade which at that time was monopolized by the merchants of
Cape Town and Durban. But the tse-tse fly belt lay between Beira on
the coast and the boundary of the Chartered Company's possessions,
and as neither oxen nor mules could live to cross this, it was
necessary, in order to compete with the Cape-Buluwayo line, to build
a railroad through the swamp and jungle. This road is now in
operation. It is two hundred and twenty miles in length, and in the
brief period of two months, during the long course of its progress
through the marshes, two hundred of the men working on it died of
fever. Some years ago, during a boundary dispute between the
Portuguese and the Chartered Company, there was a clash between the
Portuguese soldiers and the British South African police. How this
was settled and the honor of the Portuguese officials satisfied,
Kipling has told us in the delightful tale of "Judson and the
Empire." It was off Beira that Judson fished up a buoy and anchored
it over a sand-bar upon which he enticed the Portuguese gunboat. A
week before we touched at Beira, the Portuguese had rearranged all
the harbor buoys, but, after the casual habits of their race, had
made no mention of the fact. The result was that the <u>Kanzlar</u> was
hung up for twenty-four hours. We tried to comfort ourselves by
thinking that we were undoubtedly occupying the same mud-bank which
had been used by the strategic Judson to further the course of
empire.
</p><p>The <u>Kanzlar</u> could not cross the bar to go to Chinde, so the
<u>Adjutant</u>, which belongs to the same line and which was created for
these shallow waters, came to the <u>Kanzlar</u>, bringing Chinde with
her. She brought every white man in the port, and those who could
not come on board our ship remained contentedly on the <u>Adjutant</u>,
clinging to her rail as she alternately sank below, or was tossed
high above us. For three hours they smiled with satisfaction as
though they felt that to have escaped from Chinde, for even that
brief time, was sufficient recompense for a thorough ducking and the
pains of sea-sickness. On the bridge of the <u>Adjutant</u>, in white
duck and pith helmets, were the only respectable members of Chinde
society. We knew that they were the only respectable members of
Chinde society, because they told us so themselves. On her lower
deck she brought two French explorers, fully dressed for the part as
Tartarin of Tarascon might have dressed it in white havelocks and
gaiters buckled up to the thighs, and clasping express rifles in new
leather cases. From her engine-room came stokers from Egypt, and
from her forward deck Malays in fresh white linen, Mohammedans in
fez and turban, Portuguese officials, chiefly in decorations, Indian
coolies and Zanzibari boys, very black and very beautiful, who wound
and unwound long blue strips of cotton about their shoulders, or
ears, or thighs as the heat, or the nature of the work of unloading
required. Among these strange peoples were goats, as delicately
colored as a meerschaum pipe, and with the horns of our red deer,
strange white oxen with humps behind the shoulders, those that are
exhibited in cages at home as "sacred buffalo," but which here are
only patient beasts of burden, and gray monkeys, wildcats, snakes
and crocodiles in cages addressed to "Hagenbeck, Hamburg." The
freight was no less curious; assegais in bundles, horns stretching
for three feet from point to point, or rising straight, like
poignards; skins, ground-nuts, rubber, and heavy blocks of bees-wax
wrapped in coarse brown sacking, and which in time will burn before
the altars of Roman Catholic churches in Italy, Spain, and France.
</p><p>People of the "Bromide" class who run across a friend from their own
city in Paris will say, "Well, to think of meeting <u>you</u> here. How
small the world is after all!" If they wish a better proof of how
really small it is, how closely it is knit together, how the
existence of one canning-house in Chicago supports twenty stores in
Durban, they must follow, not the missionary or the explorers, not
the punitive expeditions, but the man who wishes to buy, and the man
who brings something to sell. Trade is what has brought the
latitudes together and made the world the small department store it
is, and forced one part of it to know and to depend upon the other.
</p><p>The explorer tells you, "I was the first man to climb Kilamajaro."
"I was the first to cut a path from the shores of Lake Nyassa into
the Congo Basin." He even lectures about it, in front of a wet sheet
in the light of a stereopticon, and because he has added some miles
of territory to the known world, people buy his books and learned
societies place initials after his distinguished name. But before
his grandfather was born and long before he ever disturbed the
waters of Nyassa the Phoenicians and Arabs and Portuguese and men
of his own time and race had been there before him to buy ivory,
both white and black, to exchange beads and brass bars and
shaving-mirrors for the tusks of elephants, raw gold, copra, rubber,
and the feathers of the ostrich. Statesmen will modestly say that a
study of the map showed them how the course of empire must take its
way into this or that undiscovered wilderness, and that in
consequence, at their direction, armies marched to open these tracts
which but for their prescience would have remained a desert. But
that was not the real reason. A woman wanted three feathers to wear
at Buckingham Palace, and to oblige her a few unimaginative traders,
backed by a man who owned a tramp steamer, opened up the East Coast
of Africa; another wanted a sealskin sacque, and fleets of ships
faced floating ice under the Northern Lights. The bees of the Shire
Riverway help to illuminate the cathedrals of St. Peters and Notre
Dame, and back of Mozambique thousands of rubber-trees are being
planted to-day, because, at the other end of the globe, people want
tires for their automobiles; and because the fashionable ornament of
the natives of Swaziland is, for no reason, no longer blue-glass
beads, manufacturers of beads in Switzerland and Italy find
themselves out of pocket by some thousands and thousands of pounds.
</p><p>The traders who were making the world smaller by bringing cotton
prints to Chinde to cover her black nakedness, her British Majesty's
consul at that port, and the boy lieutenant of the paddle-wheeled
gunboat which patrols the Zambesi River, were the gentlemen who
informed me that they were the only respectable members of Chinde
society. They came over the side with the gratitude of sailors whom
the <u>Kanzlar</u> might have picked up from a desert island, where they
had been marooned and left to rot. They observed the gilded glory of
the <u>Kanzlar</u> smoking-room, its mirrors and marble-topped tables,
with the satisfaction and awe of the California miner, who found all
the elegance of civilization in the red plush of a Broadway omnibus.
The boy-commander of the gunboat gazed at white women in the saloon
with fascinated admiration.
</p><p>"I have never," he declared, breathlessly, "I have never seen so
many beautiful women in one place at the same time! I'd forgotten
that there were so many white people in the world."
</p><p>"If I stay on board this ship another minute I shall go home," said
Her Majesty's consul, firmly. "You will have to hold me. It's coming
over me--I feel it coming. I shall never have the strength to go
back." He appealed to the sympathetic lieutenant. "Let's desert
together," he begged.
</p><p> [Illustration: One-half of the Street Cleaning Department of
 Mozambique.]
</p><p>In the swamps of the East Coast the white exiles lay aside the
cloaks and masks of crowded cities. They do not try to conceal their
feelings, their vices, or their longings. They talk to the first
white stranger they meet of things which in the great cities a man
conceals even from his room-mate, and men they would not care to
know, and whom they would never meet in the fixed social pathways of
civilization, they take to their hearts as friends. They are too few
to be particular, they have no choice, and they ask no questions. It
is enough that the white man, like themselves, is condemned to
exile. They do not try to find solace in the thought that they are
the "foretrekkers" of civilization, or take credit to themselves
because they are the path-finders and the pioneers who bear the heat
and burden of the day. They are sorry for themselves, because they
know, more keenly than any outsider can know, how good is the life
they have given up, and how hard is the one they follow, but they do
not ask anyone else to be sorry. They would be very much surprised
if they thought you saw in their struggle against native and
Portuguese barbarism, fever, and savage tribes, a life of great good
and value, full of self-renunciation, heroism, and self-sacrifice.
</p><p>On the day they boarded the <u>Kanzlar</u> the pains of nostalgia were
sweeping over the respectable members of Chinde society like waves
of nausea, and tearing them. With a grim appreciation of their own
condition, they smiled mockingly at the ladies on the quarter-deck,
as you have seen prisoners grin through the bars; they were even
boisterous and gay, but their gayety was that of children at recess,
who know that when the bell rings they are going back to the desk.
</p><p>A little English boy ran through the smoking-room, and they fell
upon him, and quarrelled for the privilege of holding him on their
knees. He was a shy, coquettish little English boy, and the
boisterous, noisy men did not appeal to him. To them he meant home
and family and the old nursery, papered with colored pictures from
the Christmas <u>Graphic</u>. His stout, bare legs and tangled curls and
sailor's hat, with "H.M.S. Mars" across it, meant all that was clean
and sweet-smelling in their past lives.
</p><p>"I'll arrest you for a deserter," said the lieutenant of the
gunboat. "I'll make the consul send you back to the <u>Mars</u>." He held
the boy on his knee fearfully, handling him as though he were some
delicate and precious treasure that might break if he dropped it.
</p><p>The agent of the Oceanic Development Company, Limited, whose
business in life is to drive savage Angonis out of the jungle, where
he hopes in time to see the busy haunts of trade, begged for the boy
with eloquent pleading.
</p><p>"You've had the kiddie long enough now," he urged. "Let me have him.
Come here, Mr. Mars, and sit beside me, and I'll give you fizzy
water--like lemon-squash, only nicer." He held out a wet bottle of
champagne alluringly.
</p><p>"No, he is coming to his consul," that youth declared. "He's coming
to his consul for protection. You are not fit characters to
associate with an innocent child. Come to me, little boy, and do not
listen to those degraded persons." So the "innocent child" seated
himself between the consul and the chartered trader, and they patted
his fat calves and red curls and took his minute hands in their
tanned fists, eying him hungrily, like two cannibals. But the little
boy was quite unconscious and inconsiderate of their hunger, and,
with the cruelty of children, pulled himself free and ran away.
</p><p>"He was such a nice little kiddie," they said, apologetically, as
though they felt they had been caught in some act of weakness.
</p><p>"I haven't got a card with me; I haven't needed one for two years,"
said the lieutenant, genially. "But fancy your knowing Sparks! He
has the next station to mine; I'm at one end of the Shire River and
he's at the other; he patrols from Fort Johnson up to the top of the
lake. I suppose you've heard him play the banjo, haven't you? That's
where we hit it off--we're both terribly keen about the banjo. I
suppose if it wasn't for my banjo, I'd go quite off my head down
here. I know Sparks would. You see, I have these chaps at Chinde to
talk to, and up at Tete there's the Portuguese governor, but Sparks
has only six white men scattered along Nyassa for three hundred
miles."
</p><p>I had heard of Sparks and the six white men. They grew so lonely
that they agreed to meet once a month at some central station and
spend the night together, and they invited Sparks to attend the
second meeting. But when he arrived he found that they had organized
a morphine club, and the only six white men on Lake Nyassa were
sitting around a table with their sleeves rolled up, giving
themselves injections. Sparks told them it was a "disgusting
practice," and put back to his gunboat. I recalled the story to the
lieutenant, and he laughed mournfully.
</p><p>"Yes," he said; "and what's worse is that we're here for two years
more, with all this fighting going on at the Cape and in China.
Still, we have our banjos, and the papers are only six weeks old,
and the steamer stops once every month."
</p><p> [Illustration: Custom House, Zanzibar.]
</p><p>Fortunately there were many bags of bees-wax to come over the side,
so we had time in which to give the exiles the news of the outside
world, and they told us of their present and past lives: of how one
as an American filibuster had furnished coal to the Chinese Navy;
how another had sold "ready to wear" clothes in a New York
department store, and another had been attaché at Madrid, and
another in charge of the forward guns of a great battle-ship. We
exchanged addresses and agreed upon the restaurant where we would
meet two years hence to celebrate their freedom, and we emptied many
bottles of iced-beer, and the fact that it was iced seemed to affect
the exiles more than the fact that it was beer.
</p><p>But at last the ship's whistle blew with raucous persistence. It was
final and heartless. It rang down the curtain on the mirage which
once a month comes to mock Chinde with memories of English villages,
of well-kept lawns melting into the Thames, of London asphalt and
flashing hansoms. With a jangling of bells in the engine-room the
mirage disappeared, and in five minutes to the exiles of Chinde the
<u>Kanzlar</u> became a gray tub with a pennant of smoke on the horizon
line.
</p><p>I have known some men for many years, smoked and talked with them
until improper hours of the morning, known them well enough to
borrow their money, even their razors, and parted from them with
never a pang. But when our ship abandoned those boys to the unclean
land behind them, I could see them only in a blurred and misty
group. We raised our hats to them and tried to cheer, but it was
more of a salute than a cheer. I had never seen them before, I shall
never meet them again--we had just burned signals as our ships
passed in the night--and yet, I must always consider among the
friends I have lost, those white-clad youths who are making the ways
straight for others through the dripping jungles of the Zambesi,
"the only respectable members of Chinde Society."[A]
</p><p>[Footnote A: NOTE--I did not lose the white-clad youths. The
lieutenant now is the commander of a cruiser, and the consul, a
consul-general; and they write me that the editor of the Chinde
newspaper, on his editorial page, has complained that he, also,
should be included among the respectable members of Chinde Society.
He claims his absence at Tete, at the time of the visit of the
<u>Kanzlar</u>, alone prevented his social position being publicly
recognized. That justice may be done, he, now, is officially, though
tardily, created a member of Chinde's respectable society. R.H.D.]
</p><p>The profession of the slave-trader, unless it be that of his
contemporary, the pirate preying under his black flag, is the one
which holds you with the most grewsome and fascinating interest. Its
inhumanity, its legends of predatory expeditions into unknown
jungles of Africa, the long return marches to the Coast, the
captured blacks who fall dead in the trail, the dead pulling down
with their chains those who still live, the stifling holds of the
slave-ships, the swift flights before pursuing ships-of-war, the
casting away, when too closely chased, of the ship's cargo, and the
sharks that followed, all of these come back to one as he walks the
shore-wall of Mozambique. From there he sees the slave-dhows in the
harbor, the jungles on the mainland through which the slaves came by
the thousands, and still come one by one, and the ancient palaces of
the Portuguese governors, dead now some hundreds of years, to whom
this trade in human agony brought great wealth, and no loss of
honor.
</p><p> [Illustration: Chain-gangs of Petty Offenders Outside of Zanzibar.]
</p><p>Mozambique in the days of her glory was, with Zanzibar, the great
slave-market of East Africa, and the Portuguese and the Arabs who
fattened on this traffic built themselves great houses there, and a
fortress capable, in the event of a siege, of holding the garrison
and all the inhabitants as well. To-day the slave-trade brings to
those who follow it more of adventure than of financial profit, but
the houses and the official palaces and the fortress still remain,
and they are, in color, indescribably beautiful. Blue and pink and
red and light yellow are spread over their high walls, and have been
so washed and chastened by the rain and sun, that the whole city has
taken on the faint, soft tints of a once brilliant water-color. The
streets themselves are unpeopled, empty and strangely silent. Their
silence is as impressive as their beauty. In the heat of the day,
which is from sunrise to past sunset, you see no one, you hear no
footfall, no voices, no rumble of wheels or stamp of horses' hoofs.
The bare feet of the native, who is the only human being who dares
to move abroad, makes no sound, and in Mozambique there are no
carriages and no horses. Two bullock-carts, which collect scraps and
refuse from the white staring streets, are the only carts in the
city, and with the exception of a dozen 'rikshas are the only
wheeled vehicles the inhabitants have seen.
</p><p>I have never visited a city which so impressed one with the fact
that, in appearance, it had remained just as it was four hundred
years before. There is no decay, no ruins, no sign of disuse; it is,
on the contrary, clean and brilliantly beautiful in color, with
dancing blue waters all about it, and with enormous palms moving
above the towering white walls and red tiled roofs, but it is a city
of the dead. The open-work iron doors, with locks as large as
letter-boxes, are closed, the wooden window-shutters are barred, and
the wares in the shops are hidden from the sidewalk by heavy
curtains. There is a park filled with curious trees and with flowers
of gorgeous color, but the park is as deserted as a cemetery; along
the principal streets stretch mosaic pavements formed of great
blocks of white and black stone, they look like elongated
checker-boards, but no one walks upon them, and though there are
palaces painted blue, and government buildings in Pompeiian red, and
churches in chaste gray and white, there are no sentries to guard
the palaces, nor no black-robed priests enter or leave the
churches. They are like the palaces of a theatre, set on an empty
stage, and waiting for the actors. It will be a long time before the
actors come to Mozambique. It is, and will remain, a city of the
fifteenth century. It is now only a relic of a cruel and barbarous
period, when the Portuguese governors, the "gentlemen adventurers,"
and the Arab slave-dealers, under its blue skies, and hidden within
its barred and painted walls, led lives of magnificent debauchery,
when the tusks of ivory were piled high along its water-front, and
the dhows at anchor reeked with slaves, and when in the
market-place, where the natives now sit bargaining over a bunch of
bananas or a basket of dried fish, their forefathers were themselves
bought and sold.
</p><p>In the five hundred years in which he has claimed the shore line of
East Africa from south of Lorenço Marquez to north of Mozambique,
and many hundreds of miles inland, the Portuguese has been the dog
in the manger among nations. In all that time he has done nothing to
help the land or the people whom he pretends to protect, and he
keeps those who would improve both from gaining any hold or
influence over either. It is doubtful if his occupation of the East
Coast can endure much longer. The English and the Germans now
surround him on every side. Even handicapped as they are by the lack
of the seaports which he enjoys, they have forced their way into the
country which lies beyond his and which bounds his on every side.
They have opened up this country with little railroads, with lonely
lengths of telegraph wires, and with their launches and gunboats
they have joined, by means of the Zambesi and Chinde Rivers, new
territories to the great Indian Ocean. His strip of land, which bars
them from the sea, is still unsettled and unsafe, its wealth
undeveloped, its people untamed. He sits at his café at the coast
and collects custom-dues and sells stamped paper. For fear of the
native he dares not march five miles beyond his sea-port town, and
the white men who venture inland for purposes of trade or to
cultivate plantations do so at their own risk, he can promise them
no protection.
</p><p>The land back of Mozambique is divided into "holdings," and the rent
of each holding is based upon the number of native huts it
contains. The tax per hut is one pound a year, and these holdings
are leased to any Portuguese who promises to pay the combined taxes
of all the huts. He also engages to cut new roads, to keep those
already made in repair, and to furnish a sufficient number of police
to maintain order. The lessees of these holdings have given rise to
many and terrible scandals. In the majority of cases, the lessee,
once out of reach of all authority and of public opinion, and
wielding the power of life and death, becomes a tyrant and
task-master over his district, taxing the natives to five and ten
times the amount which each is supposed to furnish, and treating
them virtually as his bondsmen. Up along the Shire River, the
lessees punish the blacks by hanging them from a tree by their
ankles and beating their bare backs with rhinoceros hide, until, as
it has been described to me by a reputable English resident, the
blood runs in a stream over the negro's shoulders, and forms a pool
beneath his eyes.
</p><p> [Illustration: The Ivory on the Right, Covered Only with Sacking,
 Is Ready for Shipment to Boston, U.S.A.]
</p><p>You hear of no legitimate enterprise fostered by these lessees, of
no development of natural resources, but, instead, you are told
tales of sickening cruelty, and you can read in the consular
reports others quite as true; records of heartless treatment of
natives, of neglect of great resources, and of hurried snatching at
the year's crop and a return to the Coast, with nothing to show of
sustained effort or steady development. The incompetence of Portugal
cannot endure. Now that England has taken the Transvaal from the
Boer, she will find the seaport of Lorenço Marquez too necessary to
her interests to much longer leave it in the itching palms of the
Portuguese officials. Beira she also needs to feed Rhodesia, and the
Zambesi and Chinde Rivers to supply the British Central African
Company. Farther north, the Germans will find that if they mean to
make German Central Africa pay, they must control the seaboard. It
seems inevitable that, between the two great empires, the little
kingdom of Portugal will be crowded out, and having failed to
benefit either herself or anyone else on the East Coast, she will
withdraw from it, in favor of those who are fitter to survive her.
</p><p>There is no more interesting contrast along the coast of East
Africa than that presented by the colonies of England, Germany, and
Portugal. Of these three, the colonies of the Englishmen are, as one
expects to find them, the healthiest, the busiest, and the most
prosperous. They thrive under your very eyes; you feel that they
were established where they are, not by accident, not to gratify a
national vanity or a ruler's ambition, but with foresight and with
knowledge, and with the determination to make money; and that they
will increase and flourish because they are situated where the
natives and settlers have something to sell, and where the men can
bring, in return, something the natives and colonials wish to buy.
Port Elizabeth, Durban, East London, and Zanzibar belong to this
prosperous class, which gives good reason for the faith of those who
founded them.
</p><p>On the other hand, as opposed to these, there are the settlements of
the Portuguese, rotten and corrupt, and the German settlements of
Dar Es Salaam and Tanga which have still to prove their right to
exist. Outwardly, to the eye, they are model settlements. Dar Es
Salaam, in particular, is a beautiful and perfectly appointed
colonial town. In the care in which it is laid out, in the
excellence of its sanitary arrangements, in its cleanliness, and in
the magnificence of its innumerable official residences, and in
their sensible adaptability to the needs of the climate, one might
be deceived into believing that Dar Es Salaam is the beautiful
gateway of a thriving and busy colony. But there are no ramparts of
merchandise along her wharves, no bulwarks of strangely scented
bales blocking her water-front; no lighters push hurriedly from the
shore to meet the ship, although she is a German ship, or to receive
her cargo of articles "made in Germany." On the contrary, her
freight is unloaded at the English ports, and taken on at English
ports. And the German traders who send their merchandise to Hamburg
in her hold come over the side at Zanzibar, at Durban, and at Aden,
where the English merchants find in them fierce competitors. There
is nothing which goes so far to prove the falsity of the saying that
"trade follows the flag" as do these model German colonies with
their barracks, governor's palace, officers' clubs, public pleasure
parks, and with no trade; and the English colonies, where the German
merchants remain, and where, under the English flag, they grow
steadily rich. The German Emperor, believing that colonies are a
source of strength to an empire, rather than the weakness that they
are, has raised the German flag in Central East Africa, but the
ships of the German East African Company, subsidized by him, carry
their merchandize to the English ports, and his German subjects
remain where they can make the most money. They do not move to those
ports where the flag of their country would wave over them.
</p><p>Dar Es Salaam, although it lacks the one thing needful to make it a
model settlement, possesses all the other things which are needful,
and many which are pure luxuries. Its residences, as I have said,
have been built after the most approved scientific principles of
ventilation and sanitation. In no tropical country have I seen
buildings so admirably adapted to the heat and climatic changes and
at the same time more in keeping with the surrounding scenery. They
are handsome, cool-looking, white and clean, with broad verandas,
high walls, and false roofs under which currents of air are lured in
spite of themselves. The residences are set back along the high bank
which faces the bay. In front of them is a public promenade, newly
planted shade-trees arch over it, and royal palms reach up to it
from the very waters of the harbor. At one end of this semicircle
are the barracks of the Soudanese soldiers, and at the other is the
official palace of the governor. Everything in the settlement is
new, and everything is built on the scale of a city, and with the
idea of accommodating a great number of people. Hotels and cafés,
better than any one finds in the older settlements along the coast,
are arranged on the water-front, and there is a church capable of
seating the entire white population at one time. If the place is to
grow, it can do so only through trade, and when trade really comes
all these palaces and cafés and barracks which occupy the entire
water-front will have to be pushed back to make way for warehouses
and custom-house sheds. At present it is populated only by
officials, and, I believe, twelve white women.
</p><p> [Illustration: The Late Sultan of Zanzibar in His State Carriage.]
</p><p>You feel that it is an experiment, that it has been sent out like a
box of children's building blocks, and set up carefully on this
beautiful harbor. All that Dar Es Salaam needs now is trade and
emigrants. At present it is a show place, and might be exhibited at
a world's fair as an example of a model village.
</p><p>In writing of Zanzibar I am embarrassed by the knowledge that I am
not an unprejudiced witness. I fell in love with Zanzibar at first
sight, and the more I saw of it the more I wanted to take my luggage
out of the ship's hold and cable to my friends to try and have me
made Vice-Consul to Zanzibar through all succeeding administrations.
</p><p>Zanzibar runs back abruptly from a white beach in a succession of
high white walls. It glistens and glares, and dazzles you; the sand
at your feet is white, the city itself is white, the robes of the
people are white. It has no public landing-pier. Your rowboat is run
ashore on a white shelving beach, and you face an impenetrable mass
of white walls. The blue waters are behind you, the lofty
fortress-like façade before you, and a strip of white sand is at
your feet.
</p><p>And while you are wondering where this hidden city may be, a kind
resident takes you by the hand and pilots you through a narrow crack
in the rampart, along a twisting fissure between white-washed walls
where the sun cannot reach, past great black doorways of carved oak,
and out suddenly into the light and laughter and roar of Zanzibar.
</p><p>In the narrow streets are all the colors of the Orient, gorgeous,
unshaded, and violent; cobalt blue, greens, and reds on framework,
windows, and doorways; red and yellow in the awnings and curtains of
the bazaars, and orange and black, red and white, yellow, dark blue,
and purple, in the long shawls of the women. It is the busiest, and
the brightest and richest in color of all the ports along the East
African coast. Were it not for its narrow streets and its towering
walls it would be a place of perpetual sunshine. Everybody is either
actively busy, or contentedly idle. It is all movement, noise, and
glitter, everyone is telling everyone else to make way before him;
the Indian merchants beseech you from the open bazaars; their
children, swathed in gorgeous silks and hung with jewels and
bangles, stumble under your feet, the Sultan's troops assail you
with fife and drum, and the black women, wrapped below their bare
shoulders in the colors of the butterfly, and with teeth and brows
dyed purple, crowd you to the wall. Outside the city there are long
and wonderful roads between groves of the bulky mango-tree of
richest darkest green and the bending palm, shading deserted palaces
of former Sultans, temples of the Indian worshippers, native huts,
and the white-walled country residences and curtained verandas of
the white exiles. It is absurd to write them down as exiles, for it
is a Mohammedan Paradise to which they have been exiled.
</p><p>The exiles themselves will tell you that the reason you think
Zanzibar is a paradise, is because you have your steamer ticket in
your pocket. But that retort shows their lack of imagination, and a
vast ingratitude to those who have preceded them. For the charm of
Zanzibar lies in the fact that while the white men have made it
healthy and clean, have given it good roads, good laws, protection
for the slaves, quick punishment for the slave-dealers, and a firm
government under a benign and gentle Sultan, they have done all of
this without destroying one flash of its local color, or one throb
of its barbaric life, which is the showy, sunshiny, and sumptuous
life of the Far East. The good things of civilization are there, but
they are unobtrusive, and the evils of civilization appear not at
all, the native does not wear a derby hat with a kimona, as he does
in Japan, nor offer you souvenirs of Zanzibar manufactured in
Birmingham; Reuter's telegrams at the club and occasional steamers
alone connect his white masters with the outer world, and so
infrequent is the visiting stranger that the local phrase-book for
those who wish to converse in the native tongue is compiled chiefly
for the convenience of midshipmen when searching a slave-dhow.
</p><p> [Illustration: H.S.H. Hamud bin Muhamad bin Said, the Late Sultan
 of Zanzibar.]
</p><p>Zanzibar is an "Arabian Nights" city, a comic-opera capital, a most
difficult city to take seriously. There is not a street, or any
house in any street, that does not suggest in its architecture and
decoration the untrammelled fancy of the scenic artist. You feel
sure that the latticed balconies are canvas, that the white adobe
walls are supported from behind by braces, that the sunshine is a
carbon light, that the chorus of boatmen who hail you on landing
will reappear immediately costumed as the Sultan's body-guard, that
the women bearing water-jars on their shoulders will come on in the
next scene as slaves of the harem, and that the national anthem will
prove to be Sousa's Typical Tune of Zanzibar.
</p><p>Several hundred years ago the Sultans of Zanzibar grew powerful and
wealthy through exporting slaves and ivory from the mainland. These
were not two separate industries, but one was developed by the other
and was dependent upon it. The procedure was brutally simple. A
slave-trader, having first paid his tribute to the Sultan, crossed
to the mainland, and marching into the interior made his bargain
with one of the local chiefs for so much ivory, and for so many men
to carry it down to the coast. Without some such means of transport
there could have been no bargain, so the chief who was anxious to
sell would select a village which had not paid him the taxes due
him, and bid the trader help himself to what men he found there.
Then would follow a hideous night attack, a massacre of women and
children, and the taking prisoners of all able-bodied males. These
men, chained together in long lines, and each bearing a heavy tooth
of ivory upon his shoulder, would be whipped down to the coast. It
was only when they had carried the ivory there, and their work was
finished, that the idea presented itself of selling them as well as
the ivory. Later, these bearers became of equal value with the
ivory, and the raiding of native villages and the capture of men and
women to be sold into slavery developed into a great industry. The
industry continues fitfully to-day, but it is carried on under great
difficulties, and at a risk of heavy punishments. What is called
"domestic slavery" is recognized on the island of Zanzibar, the vast
clove plantations which lie back of the port employing many hundreds
of these domestic slaves. It is not to free these from their slight
bondage that the efforts of those who are trying to suppress the
slave-trade is to-day directed, but to prevent others from being
added to their number. What slave-trading there is at present is by
Arabs and Indians. They convey the slaves in dhows from the mainland
to Madagascar, Arabia, or southern Persia, and to the Island of
Pemba, which lies north of Zanzibar, and only fifteen miles from the
mainland. If a slave can be brought this short distance in safety he
can be sold for five hundred dollars; on the mainland he is not
worth more than fifteen dollars. The channels, and the mouths of
rivers, and the little bays opening from the Island of Pemba are
patrolled more or less regularly by British gunboats, and junior
officers in charge of a cutter and a crew of half a dozen men, are
detached from these for a few months at a time on "boat service." It
seems to be an unprofitable pursuit, for one officer told me that
during his month of boat service he had boarded and searched three
hundred dhows, which is an average of ten a day, and found slaves on
only one of them. But as, on this occasion, he rescued four slaves,
and the slavers, moreover, showed fight, and wounded him and two of
his boat's crew, he was more than satisfied.
</p><p>The trade in ivory, which has none of these restrictions upon it,
still flourishes, and the cool, dark warerooms of Zanzibar are
stored high with it. In a corner of one little cellar they showed
us twenty-five thousand dollars worth of these tusks piled up as
carelessly as though they were logs in a wood-shed. One of the most
curious sights in Zanzibar is a line of Zanzibari boys, each
balancing a great tusk on his shoulder, worth from five hundred to
two thousand dollars, and which is unprotected except for a piece of
coarse sacking.
</p><p> [Illustration: A German "Factory" at Tanga, the Store Below, the
 Living Apartments Above.]
</p><p>The largest exporters of ivory in the world are at Zanzibar, and
though probably few people know it, the firm which carries on this
business belongs to New York City, and has been in the ivory trade
with India and Africa from as far back as the fifties. In their
house at Zanzibar they have entertained every distinguished African
explorer, and the stories its walls have heard of native wars,
pirate dhows, slave-dealers, the English occupation, and terrible
marches through the jungles of the Congo, would make valuable and
picturesque history. The firm has always held a semi-official
position, for the reason that the United States Consul at Zanzibar,
who should speak at least Swahili and Portuguese, is invariably
chosen for the post from a drug-store in Yankton, Dakota, or a
post-office in Canton, Ohio. Consequently, on arriving at Zanzibar
he becomes homesick, and his first official act is to cable his
resignation, and the State Department instructs whoever happens to
be general manager of the ivory house to perform the duties of
acting-consul. So, the ivory house has nearly always held the eagle
of the consulate over its doorway. The manager of the ivory house,
who at the time of our visit was also consul, is Harris Robbins
Childs. Mr. Childs is well known in New York City, is a member of
many clubs there, and speaks at least five languages. He understands
the native tongue of Zanzibar so well that when the Prime Minister
of the Sultan took us to the palace to pay our respects, Childs
talked the language so much better than did the Sultan's own Prime
Minister that there was in consequence much joking and laughing. The
Sultan then was a most dignified, intelligent, and charming old
gentleman. He was popular both with his own people, who loved him
with a religious fervor, and with the English, who unobtrusively
conducted his affairs.
</p><p>There have been sultans who have acted less wisely than does Hamud
bin Muhamad bin Said. A few years ago one of these, Said Khaled,
defied the British Empire as represented by several gunboats, and
dared them to fire on his ship of war, a tramp steamer which he had
converted into a royal yacht. The gunboats were anchored about two
hundred yards from the palace, which stands at the water's edge, and
at the time agreed upon, they sank the Sultan's ship of war in the
short space of three minutes, and in a brief bombardment destroyed
the greater part of his palace. The ship of war still rests where
she sank, and her topmasts peer above the water only three hundred
yards distant from the windows of the new palace. They serve as a
constant warning to all future sultans.
</p><p>The new palace is of somewhat too modern architecture, and is not
nearly as dignified as are the massive white walls of the native
houses which surround it. But within it is a fairy palace, hung with
silk draperies, tapestries, and hand-painted curtains; the floors
are covered with magnificent rugs from Persia and India, and the
reception-room is crowded with treasures of ebony, ivory, lacquer
work, and gold and silver. There were two thrones made of silver
dragons, with many scales, and studded with jewels. The Sultan did
not seem to mind our openly admiring his treasures, and his
attendants, who stood about him in gorgeous-colored silks heavy with
gold embroideries, were evidently pleased with the deep impression
they made upon the visitors. The Sultan was very gentle and
courteous and human, especially in the pleasure he took over his son
and heir, who then was at school in England, and who, on the death
of his father, succeeded him. He seemed very much gratified when we
suggested that there was no better training-place for a boy than an
English public school; as Americans, he thought our opinion must be
unprejudiced. Before he sent us away, he gave Childs, and each of
us, a photograph of himself, one of which is reproduced in this
book.
</p><p>Our next port was the German settlement of Tanga. We arrived there
just as a blood-red sun was setting behind great and gloomy
mountains. The place itself was bathed in damp hot vapors, and
surrounded even to the water's edge by a steaming jungle. It was
more like what we expected Africa to be than was any other place we
had visited, and the proper touch of local color was supplied by a
trader, who gave as his reason for leaving us so early in the
evening that he needed sleep, as on the night before at his camp
three lions had kept him awake until morning.
</p><p> [Illustration: Soudanese Soldiers Under a German Officer Outside of
 Tanga.]
</p><p>The bubonic plague prevented our landing at other ports. We saw them
only through field-glasses from the ship's side, so that there is,
in consequence, much that I cannot write of the East Coast of
Africa. But the trip, which allows one merely to nibble at the
Coast, is worth taking again when the bubonic plague has passed
away. It was certainly worth taking once. If I have failed to make
that apparent, the fault lies with the writer. It is certainly not
the fault of the East Coast, not the fault of the Indian Ocean, that
"sets and smiles, so soft, so bright, so blooming blue," or of the
exiles and "remittance men," or of the engineers who are building
the railroad from Cape Town to Cairo, or of any lack of interest
which the East Coast presents in its problem of trade, of conquest,
and of, among nations, the survival of the fittest.
