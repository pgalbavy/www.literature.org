<p>When Peace awoke to her surroundings again, she was lying in
the gorgeously draped bed of the Flag Room with old Dr. Coates
bending over her, and she startled the worthy gentleman by asking
in sprightly tones, "Well, Doctor, how are you? It's been a long
time since you've been to call on me, isn't it? Do you think I
have cracked a rib?"</p>

<p>"No, little girl," he answered soberly, but his wrinkled old
face brightened visibly at the sound of her cheery voice. "I <em>think</em>
you have put a kink in your back."</p>

<p>"Will it be all right soon?"</p>

<p>"We hope so, curly pate."</p>

<p>"By tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"O, dear, no! Not for&mdash;days." He could not bring himself to tell
her that it might be weeks before he could even determine how
badly the little back was hurt.</p>

<p>"Mercy!" she wailed in consternation, for bed held no charms
for that active body. "And must I stay in bed all that while?"</p>

<p>"My dear child," he answered gravely, "do you realize that you
are the luckiest girl in seven counties tonight?"</p>

<p>"How?" she asked curiously, forgetting her lament in her wonder
at his words.</p>

<p>"It's a miracle that you were not killed outright."</p>

<p>"Well, Johnny dared me."</p>

<p>"And you couldn't pass up a dare?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Well, now my girlie must take her medicine."</p>

<p>Peace looked startled. "I didn't 'xpect to fall," she murmured,
and two tears glistened in her big brown eyes.</p>

<p>The doctor relented. "There, there, little one," he comforted,
"don't feel badly. We'll soon have you up and about&mdash;<em>perhaps</em>,"
he added under his breath.</p>

<p>So he left her smiling and cheerful, but his own heart was heavy
as he descended the stairs after the long examination was ended,
a pall of anxiety hung over the whole household when the door
closed behind his broad back. Peace crippled perhaps for life,
perhaps never to walk without crutches again! It was too dreadful
to be true. Peace,&mdash;their gay little butterfly! Peace, whose feet
seemed like wings! They never walked, but danced along with the
lightness of a fairy, tripping, flitting, never still. What a
calamity!</p>

<p>"But Dr. Coates says it is too soon to know for certain yet,"
Hope reminded them, trying to find a ray of encouragement to cheer
the anxious household, and they seized upon that straw with desperation,
gradually taking heart once more, and trying to shake off the
dreadful fear that Peace would never romp or dance about the house
again.</p>

<p>And it really seemed as if the white-haired physician's fears
were groundless; for after the first few days when the slightest
touch made the little sufferer whimper with pain, she seemed to
get better. The soreness wore away, the drawn lines around the
mouth smoothed themselves out, the rosy color came back to the
round cheeks and the sound of the well-known laughter floated
from room to room. Peace was undoubtedly better, and even Dr.
Coates forgot to look grave as he came and went on his professional
calls.</p>

<p>"She is doing nicely?" the worried President asked him anxiously
two weeks after the accident.</p>

<p>"Splendidly!" the doctor answered with his bluff heartiness.
"Far better than I had dared hope. If she continues to improve
as rapidly as she has been doing, we will have her on her feet
again in a month or two."</p>

<p>"A month or two!" gasped Peace, when Allee, who had chanced to
overhear the old physician's words, repeated them to the restless
invalid. "Why, I 'xpected he'd let me up next week <em>anyway</em>!"</p>

<p>"The back is a very delicate organism," quoted Cherry grandly,
always ready to display her small store of knowledge, though she
really meant to bring comfort to this dismayed sister. "When it
is once injured, it requires a long time to grow strong again.
Wouldn't you rather spend two or three months in bed than to hobble
about on crutches all the rest of your life?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, Doctor thought at first that you would never be able to
walk without 'em." Now that Peace seemed well on the road to recovery,
the secret fear which had haunted the household ever since the
night of the accident took shape in words, and for the first time
the invalid learned what a fate had been prophesied for her.</p>

<p>"<em>Without crutches?</em>" she half whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Peace lay silent for a long moment while the awfulness of those
words burned themselves into her brain. Then with a shudder she
said aloud, "That's a mighty big thankful, ain't it? &mdash;To
think I don't have to limp along with crutches! But, oh dear,
two months in bed is <em>such</em> a long time to wait! Whatever
will I do with myself? My feet are just <em>itching</em> to wiggle.
I've been here two weeks now, and it seems two years. Two months
means <em>eight whole weeks</em>!"</p>

<p>The voice rose to a tragic wail, and Grandma Campbell, hearing
the commotion, hurried across the hall to discover the cause.
She glanced reprovingly at the two culprits when the tale of woe
had been poured into her ears with fresh laments from the small
victims; but instead of scolding, as remorseful Cherry and Allee
expected her to do, she smiled sympathetically, even cheerfully
at the tragic face on the pillow, and asked, "Supposing you were
a little tenement-house girl, cooped up in a tiny, stifling kitchen,
with the steamy smell of hot soapsuds always in the air, and you
had to lie all day, week in and week out, with not a book nor
a toy to help while away the long hours. With not even a glimpse
of the world outside to make you forget for a time the cruelly
aching back&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, Grandma, not <em>really</em>?" interrupted Peace, for something
in the sound of the gentle voice told her that this was no imaginary
picture which was being drawn. "Is there such a little girl?"</p>

<p>The white head nodded soberly.</p>

<p>"Isn't there even any <em>sunshine</em> there?" The brown eyes
glanced wistfully out of the window, beside which the swan bed
had been drawn, and gloated in the beautiful April sunlight which
was already coaxing the grass into its brilliant green dress.</p>

<p>"Not a gleam," answered the woman sadly. "The buildings are jammed
so closely together, and the windows are so small that not a ray
of sunlight can penetrate a quarter part of the musty, dingy little
rooms."</p>

<p>"Is that <em>here</em>&mdash;in Martindale?" inquired Cherry in shocked
tones.</p>

<p>"Yes, on the North Side."</p>

<p>"What is the little girl's name?" asked Allee, awed into whispers
by this sad recital.</p>

<p>"Sadie Wenzell."</p>

<p>"How old is she?" was the next question.</p>

<p>"Just the age of Peace."</p>

<p>"O, a little girl!" exclaimed Cherry. "Will she ever get well
again?"</p>

<p>The sweet-faced woman hesitated an instant. How could she tell
the eager listeners that long neglect had made poor Sadie's case
well-nigh hopeless? Then she answered slowly, "We are giving her
every possible chance now, dearies. The Aid Society found her
by accident, and got her into the Children's Ward of the City
Hospital. She cried with happiness because the bed was so soft
and white and clean; and when the nurse carries up her breakfast
or dinner, it is hard to persuade the little thing to eat,&mdash;she
is so charmed with the dainty appearance of the tray."</p>

<p>"Oh-h!" whispered the three voices in awed chorus.</p>

<p>"Didn't she have anything to eat in her own house?" ventured
Allee.</p>

<p>"Nothing but dry bread and greasy soup all the five years she
has laid there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Five years!" repeated Peace in horrified accents. "Without any
sunshine and green grass and flowers! O, I sh'd think she'd have
<em>died</em> before this! Didn't she ever go to school and play
with other children?"</p>

<p>"Before she fell from the fire-escape&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was she hurt in a fire?" interrupted Cherry with interest.</p>

<p>"No, there was no fire, but the fire-escape was her only playground,
for her mother would not let her run the streets with the other
ragamuffins of the tenements; and one day she fell and crushed
her hip. But before that, she had attended a free kindergarten
around the corner and learned her alphabet. Her mother has a little
education, and she has managed to find time to teach Sadie how
to read, but that is all the child knows of school."</p>

<p>"O," sighed Peace, with a sudden yearning for the rambling old
school-house, the high-ceilinged rooms, her low seat by the window,
and even stern Miss Phelps, "what a lot she has missed! Here I'm
feeling bad 'cause school will be out 'fore I am up again, if
I have to stay in bed two months longer, and I'll be way behind
my classes. But Sadie has never had a chance to go to school at
all."</p>

<p>"Yes, dearie, you see how much you have to be thankful for, even
if it is two months before you can get out of doors again by yourself.
Until now, Sadie never knew what flowers looked like growing in
the ground. I sent her a pot of your hyacinths when the Aid made
their monthly visit to the Hospital, and Mrs. Cheever was just
telling me that the child could not believe they were really alive.
It is so sad to find one cheated out of so much in life."</p>

<p>"Isn't there something else I can send her of mine?" Peace anxiously
inquired. "I've got so much and she hasn't anything. These puzzles
are so stale I don't want to see 'em again and those books&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Suppose you make some scrapbooks to amuse her with at first,"
suggested Mrs. Campbell hastily, for when the missionary spirit
seized this restless, active body, it never ceased working until
she had given away not only all her own treasures, but all those
belonging to her sisters which chanced to fall into her hands.</p>

<p>"Scrapbooks!" cried Peace scornfully. "No one but babies cares
for them. Why, even Allee hasn't been int'rested in such things
for ages."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell smiled inwardly at Peace's contempt, but gently
persisted, "Sadie is too weak to hold heavy books yet, dearie.
The puzzles <em>might</em> amuse her, but she tires so easily
that I know some small cambric scrapbooks would prove a boon to
her just now. I agree with you that she would soon grow weary
of looking at mere pictures; but I found some very unique and
helpful little books in the attic the other day which might give
you some ideas. Ned Meadows made them one summer for his own amusement
while he was confined to his bed with a broken leg. He cut up
a lot of old magazines and pasted the articles which interested
him into some ancient notebooks Grandpa Campbell had lying around
the house. He was always on the lookout for items concerning electricity,
and one book was filled from cover to cover with bits of such
news. Another contained nothing but jokes which had helped him
laugh away a good many minutes; and still another was used for
anecdotes of famous men, with perhaps a photograph or caricature
to illustrate the little stories. He spent hours cutting and pasting
just for his own pleasure and amusement; but without realizing
it, he also stored away much useful knowledge in his brain while
he was waiting impatiently for the leg to mend. Don't you think
that would make an interesting play for you?"</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;s," replied Peace dutifully but doubtfully. She was not
as fond of reading as were her sisters, and though her grandmother's
plan <em>sounded</em> interesting when it concerned someone else,
she had her misgivings as to its success when applied to herself.</p>

<p>"Then let's begin at once," cried Mrs. Campbell, trying to look
intensely eager, as she noted the lack of enthusiasm in the round,
cherubic face on the pillow. "We will make our books of cambric,
because that will be of lighter weight than paper, and I have
stacks of old magazines filled with short stories and bright sayings.
Cherry, will you please bring me my scissors from the work-basket
and that roll of colored cambric on the top shelf in the hall
closet? Allee, wouldn't you like to run down to the barn and ask
Jud to bring us those old 'Companions' from the loft? Here comes
Hope. Just in time, dearie, to fetch us the paste from the library
and the pinking iron which Gussie was using last evening. We probably
won't get as far as pasting anything today, as it is so nearly
night now, but we will have everything ready for the time we shall
need it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell bustled briskly about, settling the invalid in
a more comfortable position, arranging the light bed table where
it would be most convenient for Peace to reach, and collecting
the other necessary material for the "scrapbook brigade," as she
laughingly called it, when Cherry, Hope, Allee and Jud came marching
upstairs again, each bringing a contribution to aid in the good
cause. All looked so eagerly enthusiastic and anxious to lend
a hand that in spite of herself, Peace began to feel a thrill
of interest tingle through her veins, and promptly began snipping
up the pages which Jud dumped on a chair beside her bed. Mrs.
Campbell cut the colored cloth into neat squares, Allee pinked
the edges, and Cherry stitched them into tiny books with card-board
covers to protect the pictures and stories so soon to be pasted
on their pages. Everyone had a task of her own, and the dinner-bell
rang before anyone had tired of this new play. Indeed, it was
with actual reluctance that Peace surrendered her shears and saw
her cluttered table cleared away for the night.</p>

<p>"If it would only last!" sighed Mrs. Campbell, as she related
the day's events to the little family gathered around the table
for the evening meal. "But she is not contented with anything
long, and will soon weary of this as she has of everything else."</p>

<p>"Then we must get our heads together and be ready with something
new just as soon as we see her interest is flagging. Gail, you
are the oldest. We will let you have the honor of first turn."</p>

<p>"All right, Grandpa," smiled Gail. "I will do my best." But it
was really Gussie who accidentally found the next diversion after
an unexpected and tragic ending of the scrapbook brigade.</p>

<p>Cutting, sorting, arranging and pasting proved an amusing occupation
for several days, owing to the contagious enthusiasm of the other
members of the household, who were constantly bringing in some
bright little story, quaint anecdote or interesting bit of information
to add to Peace's rapidly growing collection. At one time Mrs.
Campbell would suddenly appear on the threshold with her hands
filled with colored plates from some magazine article relating
to birds or bees, plants or other nature study. Again Faith would
bring in a bundle of laughable incidents gleaned from the "funny"
pages of popular magazines; or Allee would lay a carefully trimmed
bunch of short poems gathered from children's publications upon
the white counterpane of Peace's bed. And once Hope triumphantly
displayed a thick package of beautiful illustrations for articles
already clipped out for pasting.</p>

<p>"Where did you get them?" Peace demanded.</p>

<p>"Miss Page gave them to me when I happened to mention what you
were doing," answered Hope, her face glowing with animation as
she tenderly turned the pictures one by one for Peace to see.</p>

<p>"How did she happen to have so many?"</p>

<p>"She used them in her English classes when they were studying
about Lowell and Hawthorne and Longfellow. See, here is one that
illustrates 'The Children's Hour,' and here is another of 'Snow
Bound.' This is a beautiful picture of Hawthorne's birthplace,
and here is 'Old Ironsides.' You don't know much about some of
the men yet because you haven't had their poems in school; but
you've got stories about everyone of them for your scrapbooks,
and if the pictures don't fit, we will hunt up some other articles
that will go with them."</p>

<p>Peace sighed, opened her mouth as if to protest, then closed
it again; but a rebellious look crept into the brown eyes; and
had Hope been less enthusiastic over her latest contribution to
the scrapbook fund, she might have noticed the determined set
of the expressive mouth, and suspected that something unusual
was brewing under the brown curls.</p>

<p>As it was, no one but Peace was prepared for the host of children
that marched up the President's front door steps the following
afternoon, armed with paste-pots, brushes and scissors, and wearing
big pinafores over their school dresses. Each demanded to see
the invalid, and when ushered into the Flag Room was promptly
set to work sticking pictures onto cambric pages.</p>

<p>"This can hardly be a coincidence," thought Mrs. Campbell, assailed
by a sudden suspicion when patient Marie had shown the tenth visitor
up the winding stairs. "Here come three in one bunch. Yes, they
are turning in at the gate. Peace&mdash;"</p>

<p>The brown eyes glanced up from under their long lashes, and reading
in the gentle, old face the unspoken question, Peace calmly announced,
"Grandma, these are the Gleaners and their friends. They've come
to help me stick scrapbooks. You 'member you said they might have
their next meeting at our house?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but that's more than a week off yet," stammered the amazed
lady.</p>

<p>"The <em>reg'lar</em> meeting day is," Peace agreed, "but I was
just swamped under with work, so I coaxed Miss Edith to call a
special meeting just a-purpose to stick. They've all brung their
own glue and stuff. All we need now is more tables. I was awfully
afraid there wouldn't be many come, and I'm so deathly tired of
hacking and reading and sorting and pasting all by my lonesome,
that for two cents I'd dump the whole business right into the
river, Sadie Wenzell or no Sadie Wenzell."</p>

<p>"Why, Peace!" murmured the surprised woman in shocked tones.</p>

<p>"Well, I would," the small rebel persisted. "Just as soon as
I get one bunch of papers snipped up, in comes Jud with a bigger
pile, or the girls lug up a lot of truck. I've read till I'm dizzy
and cross-eyed, and my wits are worn out trying to 'member all
they've seen and heard. I've learned so much <em>inflammation</em>
that it will be <em>months</em> before there's any space for any
more to sink in. What do you s'pose Sadie's going to do with it
all? There are a dozen scrapbooks all made and enough stuff cut
to fill a dozen more. There goes the bell again. That must be
Miss Edith. I know her ring."</p>

<p>Abashed at this unlooked-for outbreak, and musing over the abrupt
ending of her cherished plans, Mrs. Campbell hastily withdrew
and went to meet the superintendent, whose voice could be heard
in cheery greeting from the hall below.</p>

<p>Just fifteen girls put in appearance at the President's house
that afternoon, and for two hours they worked like beavers under
the direction of the small tyrant in bed. Then Peace abruptly
commanded, "Lay down your brushes now and clear up. It's most
dinner time and this room must look all right when Grandpa gets
here. Grandma, will you please bring in the prize?"</p>

<p>"The prize?" echoed Mrs. Campbell in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Why, yes. It's that box of bonbons on your shelf. I asked Grandpa
to get it for me two days ago."</p>

<p>"Did&mdash;did he know what you wanted it for?" she queried.</p>

<p>"I don't s'pose he did ezackly," the child confessed. "But I
was so afraid no one would want to paste pictures bad enough to
come out today, that I promised 'freshments for all and a prize
for the one who made the best book and Evelyn's got it. Evelyn,
you better open up the box and treat the rest of us. A choc'lit
drop would taste pretty good after working so hard. Gussie'll
be up d'reckly with the 'reshments. I told her to make a whale
of a batch of cookies and gallons of lemonade. We need something
after finishing that job. But we've got most of the stuff stuck
in somewhere and the books are plumb full. I'm so glad!"</p>

<p>And indeed Peace was right. Scarcely a scrap remained of the
huge pile of pictures and clippings which had littered table,
dresser and bed a few moments before the scrapbook brigade began
to congregate; but more than twenty neatly pasted scrapbooks stood
stacked in the corner to dry, and Peace was content.</p>
