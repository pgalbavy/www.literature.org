<p>Farmer Brown's boy tramped through the Green Forest, whistling
merrily. He always whistles when he feels light-hearted, and he
always feels light-hearted when he goes fishing. You see, he is
just as fond of fishing as is Little Joe Otter or Billy Mink or
Buster Bear. And now he was making his way through the Green Forest
to the Laughing Brook, sure that by the time he had followed it
down to the Smiling Pool he would have a fine lot of trout to
take home. He knew every pool in the Laughing Brook where the
trout love to hide, did Farmer Brown's boy, and it was just the
kind of a morning when the trout should be hungry. So he whistled
as he tramped along, and his whistle was good to hear.</p>

<p>When he reached the first little pool he baited his hook very
carefully and then, taking the greatest care to keep out of sight
of any trout that might be in the little pool, he began to fish.
Now Farmer Brown's boy learned a long time ago that to be a successful
fisherman one must have a great deal of patience, so though he
didn't get a bite right away as he had expected to, he wasn't
the least bit discouraged. He kept very quiet and fished and fished,
patiently waiting for a foolish trout to take his hook. But he
didn't get so much as a nibble. "Either the trout have lost their
appetite or they have grown very wise," muttered Farmer Brown's
boy, as after a long time he moved on to the next little pool.</p>

<p>There the same thing happened. He was very patient, very, very
patient, but his patience brought no reward, not so much as the
faintest kind of a nibble. Farmer Brown's boy trudged on to the
next pool, and there was a puzzled frown on his freckled face.
Such a thing never had happened before. He didn't know what to
make of it. All the night before he had dreamed about the delicious
dinner of fried trout he would have the next day, and now&mdash;well,
if he didn't catch some trout pretty soon, that splendid dinner
would never be anything but a dream.</p>

<p>"If I didn't know that nobody else comes fishing here, I should
think that somebody had been here this very morning and caught
all the fish or else frightened them so that they are all in hiding,"
said he, as he trudged on to the next little pool. "I never had
such bad luck in all my life before. Hello! What's this?"</p>

<p>There, on the bank beside the little pool, were the heads of
three trout. Farmer Brown's boy scowled down at them more puzzled
than ever. "Somebody <em>has</em> been fishing here, and they
have had better luck than I have," thought he. He looked up the
Laughing Brook and down the Laughing Brook and this way and that
way, but no one was to be seen. Then he picked up one of the little
heads and looked at it sharply. "It wasn't cut off with a knife;
it was bitten off!" he exclaimed. "I wonder now if Billy Mink
is the scamp who has spoiled my fun."</p>

<p>Thereafter he kept a sharp lookout for signs of Billy Mink, but
though he found two or three more trout heads, he saw no other
signs and he caught no fish. This puzzled him more than ever.
It didn't seem possible that such a little fellow as Billy Mink
could have caught or frightened all the fish or have eaten so
many. Besides, he didn't remember ever having known Billy to leave
heads around that way. Billy sometimes catches more fish than
he can eat, but then he usually hides them. The farther he went
down the Laughing Brook, the more puzzled Farmer Brown's boy grew.
It made him feel very queer. He would have felt still more queer
if he had known that all the time two other fishermen who had
been before him were watching him and chuckling to themselves.
They were Little Joe Otter and Buster Bear.</p>
