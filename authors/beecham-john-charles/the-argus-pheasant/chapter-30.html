<p>Peter Gross had just concluded an account of his administration in
Bulungan to Governor-General Van Schouten at the latter's <u>paleis</u> in
Batavia. The governor-general was frowning.
</p><p>"So! <u>mynheer</u>," he exclaimed gruffly. "This is not a very happy report
you have brought me."
</p><p>Peter Gross bent his head.
</p><p>"No census, not a cent of taxes paid, piracy, murders, my
<u>controlleurs</u>--God knows where they are, the whole province in revolt.
This is a nice kettle of fish."
</p><p>Sachsen glanced sympathetically at Peter Gross. The lad he loved so well
sat with bowed head and clenched hands, lines of suffering marked his
face, he had grown older, oh, so much older, during those few sorry
months since he had so confidently declared his policies for the
regeneration of the residency in this very room. The governor was
speaking again.
</p><p>"You said you would find Mynheer de Jonge's murderer for me," Van
Schouten rasped. "Have you done that?"
</p><p>"Yes, your excellency. It was Kapitein Van Slyck who planned the deed,
and Cho Seng who committed the act, pricked him with a upas thorn while
he slept, as I told your excellency. Here are my proofs. A statement
made by Mynheer Muller to Captain Carver and Lieutenant Banning before
he died, and a statement made by Koyala to me." He gave the governor the
documents. The latter scanned them briefly and laid them aside.
</p><p>"How did Muller come to his death?" he demanded.
</p><p>"Like a true servant of the state, fighting in defense of the fort,"
Peter Gross replied. "A splinter of a shell struck him in the body."
</p><p>"H-m!" the governor grunted. "I thought he was one of these traitors,
too."
</p><p>"He expiated his crimes two weeks ago at Fort Wilhelmina, your
excellency."
</p><p>"And Cho Seng?" the governor demanded. "Is he still alive?"
</p><p>"He fell on his own dagger." Peter Gross described the incident. "It was
not the dagger thrust that killed him," he explained. "That made only a
flesh wound. But the dagger point had been dipped in a cobra's venom."
Softly he added: "He always feared that he would die from a snake's
poison."
</p><p>"It is the judgment of God," Van Schouten pronounced solemnly. He looked
at Peter Gross sharply.
</p><p>"Now this Koyala," he asked, "where is she?"
</p><p>"I do not know. In the hills, among her own people, I think. She will
not trouble you again."
</p><p>The governor stared at his resident. Gradually the stern lines of his
face relaxed and a quaintly humorous glint came into his eyes.
</p><p>"So, Mynheer Gross, the woman deceived you?" he asked sharply.
</p><p>Peter Gross made no reply. The governor's eyes twinkled. He suddenly
brought down his fist on the table with a resounding bang.
</p><p>"_Donder en bliksem!_" he exclaimed, "I cannot find fault with you for
that. The fault is mine. I should have known better. Why, when I was
your age, a pretty woman could strip the very buttons from my dress
coat--dammit, Mynheer Gross, you must have had a heart of ice to
withstand her so long."
</p><p>He flourished a highly colored silk handkerchief and blew his nose
lustily.
</p><p>"So you are forgiven on that count, Mynheer Gross. Now for the other. It
appears that by your work you have created a much more favorable feeling
toward us among many of the natives. The hill Dyaks did not rise against
us as they have always done before, and some of the coast Dyak tribes
were loyal. That buzzard, Lkath, stayed in his lair. Furthermore, you
have solved the mysteries that have puzzled us for years and the
criminals have been muzzled. Lastly, you were the honey that attracted
all these piratical pests into Bulungan harbor where Kapitein Enckel was
able to administer them a blow that will sweep those seas clear of this
vermin for years to come, I believe. You have not done so badly after
all, Mynheer Gross. Of course, you and your twenty-five men might have
come to grief had not Sachsen, here, heard reports that caused me to
send the <u>Prins Lodewyk</u> post-haste to Bulungan, but we will overlook
your too great confidence on the score of your youth." He chuckled. "Now
as to the future."
</p><p>He paused and looked smilingly into the eyes that looked so gratefully
into his.
</p><p>"What say you to two more years at Bulungan, <u>mynheer</u>, to straighten
out affairs there, work out your policies, and finish what you have so
ably begun?"
</p><p>"Your excellency is too good," Peter Gross murmured brokenly.
</p><p>"Good!" Van Schouten snapped. "<u>Donder en bliksem, mynheer</u>, it is only
that I know a man when I see him. Can you go back next week?"
</p><p>"Yes, your excellency."
</p><p>"Then see that you do. And see to it that those devils send me some rice
this year when the tax falls due or I will hang them all in the good,
old-fashioned way."
