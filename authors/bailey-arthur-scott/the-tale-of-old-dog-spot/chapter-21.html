<p>The crash and blare of the circus band came nearer and nearer. Johnnie
Green craned his neck out of the carryall, as it stood at the side of
Main Street, and tried to get a glimpse of the parade.
</p>
<p>Old dog Spot did not howl again, but stole out beside the bays and
looked up the street too.
</p><p>Soon a man with a tall, shiny hat on his head rode a proud, prancing
horse around a corner. And behind him six more horses with gay plumes on
their bridles made a wide turn as they swung into view. On top of the
high red wagon that they drew sat the band, all in red suits and
playing away like mad.
</p><p>Spot couldn't help whining. Although the bandsmen were playing the
liveliest air they knew, music always made Spot sad. And he was glad
when the band wagon had passed on.
</p><p>Other wagons, blazoned with red and gold, followed.
</p><p>Old dog Spot's hair began to rise along his back and he sniffed,
growling. He had noticed a strange mixture of the queerest odors. He
didn't know, for a moment, whether to run away or not.
</p><p>"Oh, see the tiger!" Johnnie Green shouted. "And the lions! And the
monkeys! And the bear!"
</p><p>"<u>See</u> them!" Spot yelped. "I say, <u>smell</u> them!"
</p><p>He felt better when the animals in their cages had gone creaking past.
And he forgot his uneasiness as he watched dozens of horses, ridden by
folk whose bespangled clothes glittered in the sunlight.
</p><p>Then came a funny man in a little, two-wheeled cart, driving a donkey.
This was the clown. He bowed and smiled to everybody, right and left,
and even threw kisses at some of the girls. His painted face, his
bag-like clothes, and his odd little round, pointed hat made Johnnie
Green laugh. And to Johnnie's great delight, when the clown saw Spot he
whistled.
</p><p>Old Spot was all for dashing out into the street. But Farmer Green
wouldn't let him do that. Spot had to be content with barking at the
clown.
</p><p>Then a man on a brisk little horse came down the street. He had a big
voice. And he kept using it all the time, shouting so everybody would
be sure to hear, "Look out for your bosses! The elephants are coming!"
</p><p>And they came. The elephants came. When Spot saw their huge forms
plodding down Main Street he dived beneath the carryall again and
shivered until the last one had passed along.
</p><p>The bays stirred restlessly as the elephants neared them. And the
younger of the pair snorted with fear.
</p><p>Farmer Green talked to them in a soothing voice and told them there
wasn't any danger. But nobody thought of talking to old dog Spot. Every
one forgot about him. And he was just as badly frightened as the bays,
especially when a terrible tooting and screeching burst forth.
</p><p>Spot jumped almost out of his skin.
</p><p>"Sakes alive!" he howled. "What awful voices the elephants have!"
</p><p>"The steam calliope!" Johnnie Green cried. "And that's the end of the
parade."
