As agents-provocateurs, not alone were we able to travel a great
deal, but our very work threw us in contact with the proletariat
and with our comrades, the revolutionists.  Thus we were in both
camps at the same time, ostensibly serving the Iron Heel and
secretly working with all our might for the Cause.  There were many
of us in the various secret services of the Oligarchy, and despite
the shakings-up and reorganizations the secret services have
undergone, they have never been able to weed all of us out.
<P>
Ernest had largely planned the First Revolt, and the date set had
been somewhere early in the spring of 1918.  In the fall of 1917 we
were not ready; much remained to be done, and when the Revolt was
precipitated, of course it was doomed to failure.  The plot of
necessity was frightfully intricate, and anything premature was
sure to destroy it.  This the Iron Heel foresaw and laid its
schemes accordingly.
<P>
We had planned to strike our first blow at the nervous system of
the Oligarchy.  The latter had remembered the general strike, and
had guarded against the defection of the telegraphers by installing
wireless stations, in the control of the Mercenaries.  We, in turn,
had countered this move.  When the signal was given, from every
refuge, all over the land, and from the cities, and towns, and
barracks, devoted comrades were to go forth and blow up the
wireless stations.  Thus at the first shock would the Iron Heel be
brought to earth and lie practically dismembered.
<P>
At the same moment, other comrades were to blow up the bridges and
tunnels and disrupt the whole network of railroads.  Still further,
other groups of comrades, at the signal, were to seize the officers
of the Mercenaries and the police, as well as all Oligarchs of
unusual ability or who held executive positions.  Thus would the
leaders of the enemy be removed from the field of the local battles
that would inevitably be fought all over the land.
<P>
Many things were to occur simultaneously when the signal went
forth.  The Canadian and Mexican patriots, who were far stronger
than the Iron Heel dreamed, were to duplicate our tactics.  Then
there were comrades (these were the women, for the men would be
busy elsewhere) who were to post the proclamations from our secret
presses.  Those of us in the higher employ of the Iron Heel were to
proceed immediately to make confusion and anarchy in all our
departments.  Inside the Mercenaries were thousands of our
comrades.  Their work was to blow up the magazines and to destroy
the delicate mechanism of all the war machinery.  In the cities of
the Mercenaries and of the labor castes similar programmes of
disruption were to be carried out.
<P>
In short, a sudden, colossal, stunning blow was to be struck.
Before the paralyzed Oligarchy could recover itself, its end would
have come.  It would have meant terrible times and great loss of
life, but no revolutionist hesitates at such things.  Why, we even
depended much, in our plan, on the unorganized people of the abyss.
They were to be loosed on the palaces and cities of the masters.
Never mind the destruction of life and property.  Let the abysmal
brute roar and the police and Mercenaries slay.  The abysmal brute
would roar anyway, and the police and Mercenaries would slay
anyway.  It would merely mean that various dangers to us were
harmlessly destroying one another.  In the meantime we would be
doing our own work, largely unhampered, and gaining control of all
the machinery of society.
<P>
Such was our plan, every detail of which had to be worked out in
secret, and, as the day drew near, communicated to more and more
comrades.  This was the danger point, the stretching of the
conspiracy.  But that danger-point was never reached.  Through its
spy-system the Iron Heel got wind of the Revolt and prepared to
teach us another of its bloody lessons.  Chicago was the devoted
city selected for the instruction, and well were we instructed.
<P>
Chicago* was the ripest of all--Chicago which of old time was the
city of blood and which was to earn anew its name.  There the
revolutionary spirit was strong.  Too many bitter strikes had been
curbed there in the days of capitalism for the workers to forget
and forgive.  Even the labor castes of the city were alive with
revolt.  Too many heads had been broken in the early strikes.
Despite their changed and favorable conditions, their hatred for
the master class had not died.  This spirit had infected the
Mercenaries, of which three regiments in particular were ready to
come over to us en masse.
<P>
<P>
* Chicago was the industrial inferno of the nineteenth century A.D.
A curious anecdote has come down to us of John Burns, a great
English labor leader and one time member of the British Cabinet.
In Chicago, while on a visit to the United States, he was asked by
a newspaper reporter for his opinion of that city.  "Chicago," he
answered, "is a pocket edition of hell."  Some time later, as he
was going aboard his steamer to sail to England, he was approached
by another reporter, who wanted to know if he had changed his
opinion of Chicago.  "Yes, I have," was his reply.  "My present
opinion is that hell is a pocket edition of Chicago."
<P>
<P>
Chicago had always been the storm-centre of the conflict between
labor and capital, a city of street-battles and violent death, with
a class-conscious capitalist organization and a class-conscious
workman organization, where, in the old days, the very school-
teachers were formed into labor unions and affiliated with the hod-
carriers and brick-layers in the American Federation of Labor.  And
Chicago became the storm-centre of the premature First Revolt.
<P>
The trouble was precipitated by the Iron Heel.  It was cleverly
done.  The whole population, including the favored labor castes,
was given a course of outrageous treatment.  Promises and
agreements were broken, and most drastic punishments visited upon
even petty offenders.  The people of the abyss were tormented out
of their apathy.  In fact, the Iron Heel was preparing to make the
abysmal beast roar.  And hand in hand with this, in all
precautionary measures in Chicago, the Iron Heel was inconceivably
careless.  Discipline was relaxed among the Mercenaries that
remained, while many regiments had been withdrawn and sent to
various parts of the country.
<P>
It did not take long to carry out this programme--only several
weeks.  We of the Revolution caught vague rumors of the state of
affairs, but had nothing definite enough for an understanding.  In
fact, we thought it was a spontaneous spirit of revolt that would
require careful curbing on our part, and never dreamed that it was
deliberately manufactured--and it had been manufactured so
secretly, from the very innermost circle of the Iron Heel, that we
had got no inkling.  The counter-plot was an able achievement, and
ably carried out.
<P>
I was in New York when I received the order to proceed immediately
to Chicago.  The man who gave me the order was one of the
oligarchs, I could tell that by his speech, though I did not know
his name nor see his face.  His instructions were too clear for me
to make a mistake.  Plainly I read between the lines that our plot
had been discovered, that we had been countermined.  The explosion
was ready for the flash of powder, and countless agents of the Iron
Heel, including me, either on the ground or being sent there, were
to supply that flash.  I flatter myself that I maintained my
composure under the keen eye of the oligarch, but my heart was
beating madly.  I could almost have shrieked and flown at his
throat with my naked hands before his final, cold-blooded
instructions were given.
<P>
Once out of his presence, I calculated the time.  I had just the
moments to spare, if I were lucky, to get in touch with some local
leader before catching my train.  Guarding against being trailed, I
made a rush of it for the Emergency Hospital.  Luck was with me,
and I gained access at once to comrade Galvin, the surgeon-in-
chief.  I started to gasp out my information, but he stopped me.
<P>
"I already know," he said quietly, though his Irish eyes were
flashing.  "I knew what you had come for.  I got the word fifteen
minutes ago, and I have already passed it along.  Everything shall
be done here to keep the comrades quiet.  Chicago is to be
sacrificed, but it shall be Chicago alone."
<P>
"Have you tried to get word to Chicago?" I asked.
<P>
He shook his head.  "No telegraphic communication.  Chicago is shut
off.  It's going to be hell there."
<P>
He paused a moment, and I saw his white hands clinch.  Then he
burst out:
<P>
"By God! I wish I were going to be there!"
<P>
"There is yet a chance to stop it," I said, "if nothing happens to
the train and I can get there in time.  Or if some of the other
secret-service comrades who have learned the truth can get there in
time."
<P>
"You on the inside were caught napping this time," he said.
<P>
I nodded my head humbly.
<P>
"It was very secret," I answered.  "Only the inner chiefs could
have known up to to-day.  We haven't yet penetrated that far, so we
couldn't escape being kept in the dark.  If only Ernest were here.
Maybe he is in Chicago now, and all is well."
<P>
Dr. Galvin shook his head.  "The last news I heard of him was that
he had been sent to Boston or New Haven.  This secret service for
the enemy must hamper him a lot, but it's better than lying in a
refuge."
<P>
I started to go, and Galvin wrung my hand.
<P>
"Keep a stout heart," were his parting words.  "What if the First
Revolt is lost?  There will be a second, and we will be wiser then.
Good-by and good luck.  I don't know whether I'll ever see you
again.  It's going to be hell there, but I'd give ten years of my
life for your chance to be in it."
<P>
The Twentieth Century* left New York at six in the evening, and was
supposed to arrive at Chicago at seven next morning.  But it lost
time that night.  We were running behind another train.  Among the
travellers in my Pullman was comrade Hartman, like myself in the
secret service of the Iron Heel.  He it was who told me of the
train that immediately preceded us.  It was an exact duplicate of
our train, though it contained no passengers.  The idea was that
the empty train should receive the disaster were an attempt made to
blow up the Twentieth Century.  For that matter there were very few
people on the train--only a baker's dozen in our car.
<P>
<P>
* This was reputed to be the fastest train in the world then.  It
was quite a famous train.
<P>
<P>
"There must be some big men on board," Hartman concluded.  "I
noticed a private car on the rear."
<P>
Night had fallen when we made our first change of engine, and I
walked down the platform for a breath of fresh air and to see what
I could see.  Through the windows of the private car I caught a
glimpse of three men whom I recognized.  Hartman was right.  One of
the men was General Altendorff; and the other two were Mason and
Vanderbold, the brains of the inner circle of the Oligarchy's
secret service.
<P>
It was a quiet moonlight night, but I tossed restlessly and could
not sleep.  At five in the morning I dressed and abandoned my bed.
<P>
I asked the maid in the dressing-room how late the train was, and
she told me two hours.  She was a mulatto woman, and I noticed that
her face was haggard, with great circles under the eyes, while the
eyes themselves were wide with some haunting fear.
<P>
"What is the matter?" I asked.
<P>
"Nothing, miss; I didn't sleep well, I guess," was her reply.
<P>
I looked at her closely, and tried her with one of our signals.
She responded, and I made sure of her.
<P>
"Something terrible is going to happen in Chicago," she said.
"There's that fake* train in front of us.  That and the troop-
trains have made us late."
<P>
<P>
* False.
<P>
<P>
"Troop-trains?" I queried.
<P>
She nodded her head.  "The line is thick with them.  We've been
passing them all night.  And they're all heading for Chicago.  And
bringing them over the air-line--that means business.
<P>
"I've a lover in Chicago," she added apologetically.  "He's one of
us, and he's in the Mercenaries, and I'm afraid for him."
<P>
Poor girl.  Her lover was in one of the three disloyal regiments.
<P>
Hartman and I had breakfast together in the dining car, and I
forced myself to eat.  The sky had clouded, and the train rushed on
like a sullen thunderbolt through the gray pall of advancing day.
The very negroes that waited on us knew that something terrible was
impending.  Oppression sat heavily upon them; the lightness of
their natures had ebbed out of them; they were slack and absent-
minded in their service, and they whispered gloomily to one another
in the far end of the car next to the kitchen.  Hartman was
hopeless over the situation.
<P>
"What can we do?" he demanded for the twentieth time, with a
helpless shrug of the shoulders.
<P>
He pointed out of the window.  "See, all is ready.  You can depend
upon it that they're holding them like this, thirty or forty miles
outside the city, on every road."
<P>
He had reference to troop-trains on the side-track.  The soldiers
were cooking their breakfasts over fires built on the ground beside
the track, and they looked up curiously at us as we thundered past
without slackening our terrific speed.
<P>
All was quiet as we entered Chicago.  It was evident nothing had
happened yet.  In the suburbs the morning papers came on board the
train.  There was nothing in them, and yet there was much in them
for those skilled in reading between the lines that it was intended
the ordinary reader should read into the text.  The fine hand of
the Iron Heel was apparent in every column.  Glimmerings of
weakness in the armor of the Oligarchy were given.  Of course,
there was nothing definite.  It was intended that the reader should
feel his way to these glimmerings.  It was cleverly done.  As
fiction, those morning papers of October 27th were masterpieces.
<P>
The local news was missing.  This in itself was a masterstroke.  It
shrouded Chicago in mystery, and it suggested to the average
Chicago reader that the Oligarchy did not dare give the local news.
Hints that were untrue, of course, were given of insubordination
all over the land, crudely disguised with complacent references to
punitive measures to be taken.  There were reports of numerous
wireless stations that had been blown up, with heavy rewards
offered for the detection of the perpetrators.  Of course no
wireless stations had been blown up.  Many similar outrages, that
dovetailed with the plot of the revolutionists, were given.  The
impression to be made on the minds of the Chicago comrades was that
the general Revolt was beginning, albeit with a confusing
miscarriage in many details.  It was impossible for one uninformed
to escape the vague yet certain feeling that all the land was ripe
for the revolt that had already begun to break out.
<P>
It was reported that the defection of the Mercenaries in California
had become so serious that half a dozen regiments had been
disbanded and broken, and that their members with their families
had been driven from their own city and on into the labor-ghettos.
And the California Mercenaries were in reality the most faithful of
all to their salt!  But how was Chicago, shut off from the rest of
the world, to know?  Then there was a ragged telegram describing an
outbreak of the populace in New York City, in which the labor
castes were joining, concluding with the statement (intended to be
accepted as a bluff*) that the troops had the situation in hand.
<P>
<P>
* A lie.
<P>
<P>
And as the oligarchs had done with the morning papers, so had they
done in a thousand other ways.  These we learned afterward, as, for
example, the secret messages of the oligarchs, sent with the
express purpose of leaking to the ears of the revolutionists, that
had come over the wires, now and again, during the first part of
the night.
<P>
"I guess the Iron Heel won't need our services," Hartman remarked,
putting down the paper he had been reading, when the train pulled
into the central depot.  "They wasted their time sending us here.
Their plans have evidently prospered better than they expected.
Hell will break loose any second now."
<P>
He turned and looked down the train as we alighted.
<P>
"I thought so," he muttered.  "They dropped that private car when
the papers came aboard."
<P>
Hartman was hopelessly depressed.  I tried to cheer him up, but he
ignored my effort and suddenly began talking very hurriedly, in a
low voice, as we passed through the station.  At first I could not
understand.
<P>
"I have not been sure," he was saying, "and I have told no one.  I
have been working on it for weeks, and I cannot make sure.  Watch
out for Knowlton.  I suspect him.  He knows the secrets of a score
of our refuges.  He carries the lives of hundreds of us in his
hands, and I think he is a traitor.  It's more a feeling on my part
than anything else.  But I thought I marked a change in him a short
while back.  There is the danger that he has sold us out, or is
going to sell us out.  I am almost sure of it.  I wouldn't whisper
my suspicions to a soul, but, somehow, I don't think I'll leave
Chicago alive.  Keep your eye on Knowlton.  Trap him.  Find out.  I
don't know anything more.  It is only an intuition, and so far I
have failed to find the slightest clew."  We were just stepping out
upon the sidewalk.  "Remember," Hartman concluded earnestly.  "Keep
your eyes upon Knowlton."
<P>
And Hartman was right.  Before a month went by Knowlton paid for
his treason with his life.  He was formally executed by the
comrades in Milwaukee.
<P>
All was quiet on the streets--too quiet.  Chicago lay dead.  There
was no roar and rumble of traffic.  There were not even cabs on the
streets.  The surface cars and the elevated were not running.  Only
occasionally, on the sidewalks, were there stray pedestrians, and
these pedestrians did not loiter.  They went their ways with great
haste and definiteness, withal there was a curious indecision in
their movements, as though they expected the buildings to topple
over on them or the sidewalks to sink under their feet or fly up in
the air.  A few gamins, however, were around, in their eyes a
suppressed eagerness in anticipation of wonderful and exciting
things to happen.
<P>
From somewhere, far to the south, the dull sound of an explosion
came to our ears.  That was all.  Then quiet again, though the
gamins had startled and listened, like young deer, at the sound.
The doorways to all the buildings were closed; the shutters to the
shops were up.  But there were many police and watchmen in
evidence, and now and again automobile patrols of the Mercenaries
slipped swiftly past.
<P>
Hartman and I agreed that it was useless to report ourselves to the
local chiefs of the secret service.  Our failure so to report would
be excused, we knew, in the light of subsequent events.  So we
headed for the great labor-ghetto on the South Side in the hope of
getting in contact with some of the comrades.  Too late!  We knew
it.  But we could not stand still and do nothing in those ghastly,
silent streets.  Where was Ernest?  I was wondering.  What was
happening in the cities of the labor castes and Mercenaries?  In
the fortresses?
<P>
As if in answer, a great screaming roar went up, dim with distance,
punctuated with detonation after detonation.
<P>
"It's the fortresses," Hartman said.  "God pity those three
regiments!"
<P>
At a crossing we noticed, in the direction of the stockyards, a
gigantic pillar of smoke.  At the next crossing several similar
smoke pillars were rising skyward in the direction of the West
Side.  Over the city of the Mercenaries we saw a great captive war-
balloon that burst even as we looked at it, and fell in flaming
wreckage toward the earth.  There was no clew to that tragedy of
the air.  We could not determine whether the balloon had been
manned by comrades or enemies.  A vague sound came to our ears,
like the bubbling of a gigantic caldron a long way off, and Hartman
said it was machine-guns and automatic rifles.
<P>
And still we walked in immediate quietude.  Nothing was happening
where we were.  The police and the automobile patrols went by, and
once half a dozen fire-engines, returning evidently from some
conflagration.  A question was called to the fireman by an officer
in an automobile, and we heard one shout in reply: "No water!
They've blown up the mains!"
<P>
"We've smashed the water supply," Hartman cried excitedly to me.
"If we can do all this in a premature, isolated, abortive attempt,
what can't we do in a concerted, ripened effort all over the land?"
<P>
The automobile containing the officer who had asked the question
darted on.  Suddenly there was a deafening roar.  The machine, with
its human freight, lifted in an upburst of smoke, and sank down a
mass of wreckage and death.
<P>
Hartman was jubilant.  "Well done! well done!" he was repeating,
over and over, in a whisper.  "The proletariat gets its lesson to-
day, but it gives one, too."
<P>
Police were running for the spot.  Also, another patrol machine had
halted.  As for myself, I was in a daze.  The suddenness of it was
stunning.  How had it happened?  I knew not how, and yet I had been
looking directly at it.  So dazed was I for the moment that I was
scarcely aware of the fact that we were being held up by the
police.  I abruptly saw that a policeman was in the act of shooting
Hartman.  But Hartman was cool and was giving the proper passwords.
I saw the levelled revolver hesitate, then sink down, and heard the
disgusted grunt of the policeman.  He was very angry, and was
cursing the whole secret service.  It was always in the way, he was
averring, while Hartman was talking back to him and with fitting
secret-service pride explaining to him the clumsiness of the
police.
<P>
The next moment I knew how it had happened.  There was quite a
group about the wreck, and two men were just lifting up the wounded
officer to carry him to the other machine.  A panic seized all of
them, and they scattered in every direction, running in blind
terror, the wounded officer, roughly dropped, being left behind.
The cursing policeman alongside of me also ran, and Hartman and I
ran, too, we knew not why, obsessed with the same blind terror to
get away from that particular spot.
<P>
Nothing really happened then, but everything was explained.  The
flying men were sheepishly coming back, but all the while their
eyes were raised apprehensively to the many-windowed, lofty
buildings that towered like the sheer walls of a canyon on each
side of the street.  From one of those countless windows the bomb
had been thrown, but which window?  There had been no second bomb,
only a fear of one.
<P>
Thereafter we looked with speculative comprehension at the windows.
Any of them contained possible death.  Each building was a possible
ambuscade.  This was warfare in that modern jungle, a great city.
Every street was a canyon, every building a mountain.  We had not
changed much from primitive man, despite the war automobiles that
were sliding by.
<P>
Turning a corner, we came upon a woman.  She was lying on the
pavement, in a pool of blood.  Hartman bent over and examined her.
As for myself, I turned deathly sick.  I was to see many dead that
day, but the total carnage was not to affect me as did this first
forlorn body lying there at my feet abandoned on the pavement.
"Shot in the breast," was Hartman's report.  Clasped in the hollow
of her arm, as a child might be clasped, was a bundle of printed
matter.  Even in death she seemed loath to part with that which had
caused her death; for when Hartman had succeeded in withdrawing the
bundle, we found that it consisted of large printed sheets, the
proclamations of the revolutionists.
<P>
"A comrade," I said.
<P>
But Hartman only cursed the Iron Heel, and we passed on.  Often we
were halted by the police and patrols, but our passwords enabled us
to proceed.  No more bombs fell from the windows, the last
pedestrians seemed to have vanished from the streets, and our
immediate quietude grew more profound; though the gigantic caldron
continued to bubble in the distance, dull roars of explosions came
to us from all directions, and the smoke-pillars were towering more
ominously in the heavens.
