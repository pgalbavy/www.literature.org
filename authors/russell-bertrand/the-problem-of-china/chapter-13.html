<p>China, like Italy and Greece, is frequently misjudged by persons
of culture because they regard it as a museum. The preservation
of ancient beauty is very important, but no vigorous forward-looking
man is content to be a mere curator. The result is that the best
people in China tend to be Philistines as regards all that is
pleasing to the European tourist. The European in China, quite
apart from interested motives, is apt to be ultra-conservative,
because he likes everything distinctive and non-European. But
this is the attitude of an outsider, of one who regards China
as a country to be looked at rather than lived in, as a country
with a past rather than a future. Patriotic Chinese naturally
do not view their country in this way; they wish their country
to acquire what is best in the modern world, not merely to remain
an interesting survival of a by-gone age, like Oxford or the Yellowstone
Park. As the first step to this end, they do all they can to promote
higher education, and to increase the number of Chinese who can
use and appreciate Western knowledge without being the slaves
of Western follies. What is being done in this direction is very
interesting, and one of the most hopeful things happening in our
not very cheerful epoch.</p>

<p>There is first the old traditional curriculum, the learning by
rote of the classics without explanation in early youth, followed
by a more intelligent study in later years. This is exactly like
the traditional study of the classics in this country, as it existed,
for example, in the eighteenth century. Men over thirty, even
if, in the end, they have secured a thoroughly modern education,
have almost all begun by learning reading and writing in old-fashioned
schools. Such schools still form the majority, and give most of
the elementary education that is given. Every child has to learn
by heart every day some portion of the classical text, and repeat
it out loud in class. As they all repeat at the same time, the
din is deafening. (In Peking I lived next to one of these schools,
so I can speak from experience.) The number of people who are
taught to read by these methods is considerable; in the large
towns one finds that even coolies can read as often as not. But
writing (which is very difficult in Chinese) is a much rarer accomplishment.
Probably those who can both read and write form about five per
cent, of the population.</p>

<p>The establishment of normal schools for the training of teachers
on modern lines, which grew out of the edict of 1905 abolishing
the old examination system and proclaiming the need of educational
reform, has done much, and will do much more, to transform and
extend elementary education. The following statistics showing
the increase in the number of schools, teachers, and students
in China are taken from Mr. Tyau's <em>China Awakened</em>, p.
4:&mdash;</p>

<p>Number of Schools       42,444     59,796    128,048    134,000
Number of Teachers     185,566    200,000    326,417    326,000
Number of Students   1,625,534  3,849,554  4,269,197  4,500,000</p>

<p>Considering that the years concerned are years of revolution
and civil war, it must be admitted that the progress shown by
these figures is very remarkable.</p>

<p>There are schemes for universal elementary education, but so
far, owing to the disturbed condition of the country and the lack
of funds, it has been impossible to carry them out except in a
few places on a small scale. They would, however, be soon carried
out if there were a stable government.</p>

<p>The traditional classical education was, of course, not intended
to be only elementary. The amount of Chinese literature is enormous,
and the older texts are extremely difficult to understand. There
is scope, within the tradition, for all the industry and erudition
of the finest renaissance scholars. Learning of this sort has
been respected in China for many ages. One meets old scholars
of this type, to whose opinions, even in politics, it is customary
to defer, although they have the innocence and unworldliness of
the old-fashioned don. They remind one almost of the men whom
Lamb describes in his essay on Oxford in the Vacation&mdash;learned,
lovable, and sincere, but utterly lost in the modern world, basing
their opinions of Socialism, for example, on what some eleventh-century
philosopher said about it. The arguments for and against the type
of higher education that they represent are exactly the same as
those for and against a classical education in Europe, and one
is driven to the same conclusion in both cases: that the existence
of specialists having this type of knowledge is highly desirable,
but that the ordinary curriculum for the average educated person
should take more account of modern needs, and give more instruction
in science, modern languages, and contemporary international relations.
This is the view, so far as I could discover, of all reforming
educationists in China.</p>

<p>The second kind of higher education in China is that initiated
by the missionaries, and now almost entirely in the hands of the
Americans. As everyone knows, America's position in Chinese education
was acquired through the Boxer indemnity. Most of the Powers,
at that time, if their own account is to be believed, demanded
a sum representing only actual loss and damage, but the Americans,
according to their critics, demanded (and obtained) a vastly larger
sum, of which they generously devoted the surplus to educating
Chinese students, both in China and at American universities.
This course of action has abundantly justified itself, both politically
and commercially; a larger and larger number of posts in China
go to men who have come under American influence, and who have
come to believe that America is the one true friend of China among
the Great Powers.</p>

<p>One may take as typical of American work three institutions of
which I saw a certain amount: Tsing-Hua College (about ten miles
from Peking), the Peking Union Medical College (connected with
the Rockefeller Hospital), and the so-called Peking University.</p>

<p>Tsing-Hua College, delightfully situated at the foot of the Western
hills, with a number of fine solid buildings,[97] in a good American
style, owes its existence entirely to the Boxer indemnity money.
It has an atmosphere exactly like that of a small American university,
and a (Chinese) President who is an almost perfect reproduction
of the American College President. The teachers are partly American,
partly Chinese educated in America, and there tends to be more
and more of the latter. As one enters the gates, one becomes aware
of the presence of every virtue usually absent in China: cleanliness,
punctuality, exactitude, efficiency. I had not much opportunity
to judge of the teaching, but whatever I saw made me think that
the institution was thorough and good. One great merit, which
belongs to American institutions generally, is that the students
are made to learn English. Chinese differs so profoundly from
European languages that even with the most skilful translations
a student who knows only Chinese cannot understand European ideas;
therefore the learning of some European language is essential,
and English is far the most familiar and useful throughout the
Far East.</p>

<p>The students at Tsing-Hua College learn mathematics and science
and philosophy, and broadly speaking, the more elementary parts
of what is commonly taught in universities. Many of the best of
them go afterwards to America, where they take a Doctor's degree.
On returning to China they become teachers or civil servants.
Undoubtedly they contribute greatly to the improvement of their
country in efficiency and honesty and technical intelligence.</p>

<p>The Rockefeller Hospital is a large, conspicuous building, representing
an interesting attempt to combine something of Chinese beauty
with European utilitarian requirements. The green roofs are quite
Chinese, but the walls and windows are European. The attempt is
praiseworthy, though perhaps not wholly successful. The hospital
has all the most modern scientific apparatus, but, with the monopolistic
tendency of the Standard Oil Company, it refuses to let its apparatus
be of use to anyone not connected with the hospital. The Peking
Union Medical College teaches many things besides medicine &mdash;English
literature, for example&mdash;and apparently teaches them well. They
are necessary in order to produce Chinese physicians and surgeons
who will reach the European level, because a good knowledge of
some European language is necessary for medicine as for other
kinds of European learning. And a sound knowledge of scientific
medicine is, of course, of immense importance to China, where
there is no sort of sanitation and epidemics are frequent.</p>

<p>The so-called Peking University is an example of what the Chinese
have to suffer on account of extra-territoriality. The Chinese
Government (so at least I was told) had already established a
university in Peking, fully equipped and staffed, and known as
the Peking University. But the Methodist missionaries decided
to give the name "Peking University" to their schools, so the
already existing university had to alter its name to "Government
University." The case is exactly as if a collection of old-fashioned
Chinamen had established themselves in London to teach the doctrine
of Confucius, and had been able to force London University to
abandon its name to them. However, I do not wish to raise the
question of extra-territoriality, the more so as I do not think
it can be abandoned for some years to come, in spite of the abuses
to which it sometimes gives rise.</p>

<p>Returned students (<em>i.e.</em> students who have been at foreign
universities) form a definite set in China.[98] There is in Peking
a "Returned Students' Club," a charming place. It is customary
among Europeans to speak ill of returned students, but for no
good reason. There are occasionally disagreements between different
sections; in particular, those who have been only to Japan are
not regarded quite as equals by those who have been to Europe
or America. My impression was that America puts a more definite
stamp upon a student than any other country; certainly those returning
from England are less Anglicized than those returning from the
United States are Americanized. To the Chinaman who wishes to
be modern and up-to-date, skyscrapers and hustle seem romantic,
because they are so unlike his home. The old traditions which
conservative Europeans value are such a mushroom growth compared
to those of China (where authentic descendants of Confucius abound)
that it is useless to attempt that way of impressing the Chinese.
One is reminded of the conversation in <em>Eothen</em> between
the English country gentleman and the Pasha, in which the Pasha
praises England to the refrain: "Buzz, buzz, all by steam; whir,
whir, all on wheels," while the Englishman keeps saying: "Tell
the Pasha that the British yeoman is still, thank God, the British
yeoman."</p>

<p>Although the educational work of the Americans in China is on
the whole admirable, nothing directed by foreigners can adequately
satisfy the needs of the country. The Chinese have a civilization
and a national temperament in many ways superior to those of white
men. A few Europeans ultimately discover this, but Americans never
do. They remain always missionaries&mdash;not of Christianity, though
they often think that is what they are preaching, but of Americanism.
What is Americanism? "Clean living, clean thinking, and pep,"
I think an American would reply. This means, in practice, the
substitution of tidiness for art, cleanliness for beauty, moralizing
for philosophy, prostitutes for concubines (as being easier to
conceal), and a general air of being fearfully busy for the leisurely
calm of the traditional Chinese. Voltaire&mdash;that hardened old cynic&mdash;laid
it down that the true ends of life are "<em>aimer et penser</em>."
Both are common in China, but neither is compatible with "pep."
The American influence, therefore, inevitably tends to eliminate
both. If it prevailed it would, no doubt, by means of hygiene,
save the lives of many Chinamen, but would at the same time make
them not worth saving. It cannot therefore be regarded as wholly
and altogether satisfactory.</p>

<p>The best Chinese educationists are aware of this, and have established
schools and universities which are modern but under Chinese direction.
In these, a certain proportion of the teachers are European or
American, but the spirit of the teaching is not that of the <em>Y.M.C.A.
</em>One can never rid oneself of the feeling that the education
controlled by white men is not disinterested; it seems always
designed, unconsciously in the main, to produce convenient tools
for the capitalist penetration of China by the merchants and manufacturers
of the nation concerned. Modern Chinese schools and universities
are singularly different: they are not hotbeds of rabid nationalism
as they would be in any other country, but institutions where
the student is taught to think freely, and his thoughts are judged
by their intelligence, not by their utility to exploiters. The
outcome, among the best young men, is a really beautiful intellectual
disinterestedness. The discussions which I used to have in my
seminar (consisting of students belonging to the Peking Government
University) could not have been surpassed anywhere for keenness,
candour, and fearlessness. I had the same impression of the Science
Society of Nanking, and of all similar bodies wherever I came
across them. There is, among the young, a passionate desire to
acquire Western knowledge, together with a vivid realization of
Western vices. They wish to be scientific but not mechanical,
industrial but not capitalistic. To a man they are Socialists,
as are most of the best among their Chinese teachers. They respect
the knowledge of Europeans, but quietly put aside their arrogance.
For the present, the purely Chinese modern educational institutions,
such as the Peking Government University, leave much to be desired
from the point of view of instruction; there are no adequate libraries,
the teaching of English is not sufficiently thorough, and there
is not enough mental discipline. But these are the faults of youth,
and are unimportant compared with the profoundly humanistic attitude
to life which is formed in the students. Most of the faults may
be traced to the lack of funds, because the Government&mdash;loved
by the Powers on account of its weakness&mdash;has to part with all
its funds to the military chieftains who fight each other and
plunder the country, as in Europe&mdash;for China must be compared
with Europe, not with any one of the petty States into which Europe
is unhappily divided.</p>

<p>The students are not only full of public spirit themselves, but
are a powerful force in arousing it throughout the nation. What
they did in 1919, when Versailles awarded Shangtung to Japan,
is well told by Mr. Tyau in his chapter on "The Student Movement."
And what they did was not merely political. To quote Mr. Tyau
(p. 146):&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Having aroused the nation, prevented the signature of the<br/>
Versailles Treaty and assisted the merchants to enforce the<br/>
Japanese boycott, the students then directed their energies to<br/>
the enlightenment of their less educated brothers and sisters.<br/>
For instance, by issuing publications, by popular lectures<br/>
showing them the real situation, internally as well as<br/>
externally; but especially by establishing free schools and<br/>
maintaining them out of their own funds. No praise can be too<br/>
high for such self-sacrifice, for the students generally also<br/>
teach in these schools. The scheme is endorsed everywhere with<br/>
the greatest enthusiasm, and in Peking alone it is estimated that<br/>
fifty thousand children are benefited by such education.

</p>
</div>
<p>One thing which came as a surprise to me was to find that, as
regards modern education under Chinese control, there is complete
equality between men and women. The position of women in Peking
Government University is better than at Cambridge. Women are admitted
to examinations and degrees, and there are women teachers in the
university. The Girls' Higher Normal School in Peking, where prospective
women teachers are taught, is a most excellent and progressive
institution, and the spirit of free inquiry among the girls would
horrify most British head mistresses.</p>

<p>There is a movement in favour of co-education, especially in
elementary education, because, owing to the inadequate supply
of schools, the girls tend to be left out altogether unless they
can go to the same school as the boys. The first time I met Professor
and Mrs. Dewey was at a banquet in Chang-sha, given by the Tuchun.
When the time came for after-dinner speeches, Mrs. Dewey told
the Tuchun that his province must adopt co-education. He made
a statesmanlike reply, saying that the matter should receive his
best consideration, but he feared the time was not ripe in Hunan.
However, it was clear that the matter was within the sphere of
practical politics. At the time, being new to China and having
imagined China a somewhat backward country, I was surprised. Later
on I realized that reforms which we only talk about can be actually
carried out in China.</p>

<p>Education controlled by missionaries or conservative white men
cannot give what Young China needs. After throwing off the native
superstitions of centuries, it would be a dismal fiasco to take
on the European superstitions which have been discarded here by
all progressive people. It is only where progressive Chinese themselves
are in control that there is scope for the renaissance spirit
of the younger students, and for that free spirit of sceptical
inquiry by which they are seeking to build a new civilization
as splendid as their old civilization in its best days.</p>

<p>While I was in Peking, the Government teachers struck, not for
higher pay, but for pay, because their salaries had not been paid
for many months. Accompanied by some of the students, they went
on a deputation to the Government, but were repulsed by soldiers
and policemen, who clubbed them so severely that many had to be
taken to hospital. The incident produced such universal fury that
there was nearly a revolution, and the Government hastened to
come to terms with the teachers with all possible speed. The modern
teachers have behind them all that is virile, energetic, and public-spirited
in China; the gang of bandits which controls the Government has
behind it Japanese money and European intrigue. America occupies
an intermediate position. One may say broadly that the old traditional
education, with the military governors and the British and Japanese
influence, stands for Conservatism; America and its commerce and
its educational institutions stand for Liberalism; while the native
modern education, practically though not theoretically, stands
for Socialism. Incidentally, it alone stands for intellectual
freedom.</p>

<p>The Chinese are a great nation, incapable of permanent suppression
by foreigners. They will not consent to adopt our vices in order
to acquire military strength; but they are willing to adopt our
virtues in order to advance in wisdom. I think they are the only
people in the world who quite genuinely believe that wisdom is
more precious than rubies. That is why the West regards them as
uncivilized.</p>

<p><em>FOOTNOTES</em>:</p>

<p>[Footnote 97: It should be said that one sees just as fine buildings
in purely Chinese institutions, such as Peking Government University
and Nanking Teachers' Training College.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 98: Mr. Tyau (op. cit. p. 27) quotes from <em>Who's
Who of American Returned Students</em>, a classification of the
occupations of 596 Chinese who have returned from American universities.
The larger items are: In education, 38 as administrators and 197
as teachers; in Government service, 129 in executive offices (there
are also three members of Parliament and four judges); 95 engineers;
35 medical practitioners (including dentists); 60 in business;
and 21 social and religious workers. It is estimated that the
total number of Chinese holding university degrees in America
is 1,700, and in Great Britain 400 <em>(ib.).</em> This disproportion
is due to the more liberal policy of America in the matter of
the Boxer indemnity. In 1916 there were 292 Chinese university
students in Great Britain, and Mr. Tyau (p. 28) gives a classification
of them by their subjects. The larger groups are: Medicine, 50;
law and economics, 47; engineering, 42; mining, 22; natural science
(including chemistry and geology, which are classified separately),
19.]</p>
