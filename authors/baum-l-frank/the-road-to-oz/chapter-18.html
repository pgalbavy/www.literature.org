The others now came up, and the Tin Woodman greeted the Lion and the
Tiger cordially.  Button-Bright yelled with fear when Dorothy first
took his hand and led him toward the great beasts; but the girl
insisted they were kind and good, and so the boy mustered up courage
enough to pat their heads; after they had spoken to him gently and he
had looked into their intelligent eyes his fear vanished entirely
and he was so delighted with the animals that he wanted to keep close
to them and stroke their soft fur every minute.
<P>
As for the shaggy man, he might have been afraid if he had met the
beasts alone, or in any other country, but so many were the marvels in;
the Land of Oz that he was no longer easily surprised, and Dorothy's
friendship for the Lion and Tiger was enough to assure him they were
safe companions.  Toto barked at the Cowardly Lion in joyous greeting,
for he knew the beast of old and loved him, and it was funny to see
how gently the Lion raised his huge paw to pat Toto's head.  The
little dog smelled of the Tiger's nose, and the Tiger politely shook
paws with him; so they were quite likely to become firm friends.
<P>
Tik-tok and Billina knew the beasts well, so merely bade them good day
and asked after their healths and inquired about the Princess Ozma.
<P>
Now it was seen that the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger were
drawing behind them a splendid golden chariot, to which they were
harnessed by golden cords.  The body of the chariot was decorated on
the outside with designs in clusters of sparkling emeralds, while
inside it was lined with a green and gold satin, and the cushions of
the seats were of green plush embroidered in gold with a crown,
underneath which was a monogram.
<P>
"Why, it's Ozma's own royal chariot!" exclaimed Dorothy.
<P>
"Yes," said the Cowardly Lion; "Ozma sent us to meet you here, for
she feared you would be weary with your long walk and she wished you
to enter the City in a style becoming your exalted rank."
<P>
"What!" cried Polly, looking at Dorothy curiously.  "Do you belong to
the nobility?"
<P>
"Just in Oz I do," said the child, "'cause Ozma made me a Princess,
you know.  But when I'm home in Kansas I'm only a country girl, and
have to help with the churning and wipe the dishes while Aunt Em
washes 'em.  Do you have to help wash dishes on the rainbow, Polly?"
<P>
"No, dear," answered Polychrome, smiling.
<P>
"Well, I don't have to work any in Oz, either," said Dorothy.  "It's
kind of fun to be a Princess once in a while; don't you think so?"
<P>
"Dorothy and Polychrome and Button-Bright are all to ride in the
chariot," said the Lion.  "So get in, my dears, and be careful not to
mar the gold or put your dusty feet on the embroidery."
<P>
Button-Bright was delighted to ride behind such a superb team, and he
told Dorothy it made him feel like an actor in a circus.  As the
strides of the animals brought them nearer to the Emerald City
every one bowed respectfully to the children, as well as to the Tin
Woodman, Tik-tok, and the shaggy man, who were following behind.
<P>
The Yellow Hen had perched upon the back of the chariot, where she
could tell Dorothy more about her wonderful chickens as they rode.
And so the grand chariot came finally to the high wall surrounding the
City, and paused before the magnificent jewel-studded gates.
<P>
These were opened by a cheerful-looking little man who wore green
spectacles over his eyes.  Dorothy introduced him to her friends as
the Guardian of the Gates, and they noticed a big bunch of keys
suspended on the golden chain that hung around his neck.  The chariot
passed through the outer gates into a fine arched chamber built in
the thick wall, and through the inner gates into the streets of the
Emerald City.
<P>
Polychrome exclaimed in rapture at the wondrous beauty that met her
eyes on every side as they rode through this stately and imposing
City, the equal of which has never been discovered, even in Fairyland.
Button-Bright could only say "My!" so amazing was the sight; but his
eyes were wide open and he tried to look in every direction at the
same time, so as not to miss anything.
<P>
The shaggy man was fairly astounded at what he saw, for the graceful
and handsome buildings were covered with plates of gold and set with
emeralds so splendid and valuable that in any other part of the world
any one of them would have been worth a fortune to its owner.  The
sidewalks were superb marble slabs polished as smooth as glass, and
the curbs that separated the walks from the broad street were also set
thick with clustered emeralds.  There were many people on these
walks--men, women and children--all dressed in handsome garments of
silk or satin or velvet, with beautiful jewels.  Better even than
this: all seemed happy and contented, for their faces were smiling and
free from care, and music and laughter might be heard on every side.
<P>
"Don't they work at all?" asked the shaggy man.
<P>
"To be sure they work," replied the Tin Woodman; "this fair city
could not be built or cared for without labor, nor could the fruit and
vegetables and other food be provided for the inhabitants to eat.  But
no one works more than half his time, and the people of Oz enjoy their
labors as much as they do their play."
<P>
"It's wonderful!" declared the shaggy man.  "I do hope Ozma will let
me live here."
<P>
The chariot, winding through many charming streets, paused before a
building so vast and noble and elegant that even Button-Bright guessed
at once that it was the Royal Palace.  Its gardens and ample grounds
were surrounded by a separate wall, not so high or thick as the wall
around the City, but more daintily designed and built all of green
marble.  The gates flew open as the chariot appeared before them, and
the Cowardly Lion and Hungry Tiger trotted up a jeweled driveway to
the front door of the palace and stopped short.
<P>
"Here we are!" said Dorothy, gaily, and helped Button-Bright from the
chariot.  Polychrome leaped out lightly after them, and they were
greeted by a crowd of gorgeously dressed servants who bowed low as the
visitors mounted the marble steps.  At their head was a pretty little
maid with dark hair and eyes, dressed all in green embroidered with
silver.  Dorothy ran up to her with evident pleasure, and exclaimed:
<P>
"O, Jellia Jamb! I'm so glad to see you again.  Where's Ozma?"
<P>
"In her room, your Highness," replied the little maid demurely, for
this was Ozma's favorite attendant.  "She wishes you to come to her as
soon as you have rested and changed your dress, Princess Dorothy.  And
you and your friends are to dine with her this evening."
<P>
"When is her birthday, Jellia?" asked the girl.
<P>
"Day after to-morrow, your Highness."
<P>
"And where's the Scarecrow?"
<P>
"He's gone into the Munchkin country to get some fresh straw to stuff
himself with, in honor of Ozma's celebration," replied the maid.  "He
returns to the Emerald City to-morrow, he said."
<P>
By this time, Tok-tok, the Tin Woodman, and the shaggy man had arrived
and the chariot had gone around to the back of the palace, Billina
going with the Lion and Tiger to see her chickens after her absence
from them.  But Toto stayed close beside Dorothy.
<P>
"Come in, please," said Jellia Jamb; "it shall be our pleasant duty
to escort all of you to the rooms prepared for your use."
<P>
The shaggy man hesitated.  Dorothy had never known him to be ashamed
of his shaggy looks before, but now that he was surrounded by so much
magnificence and splendor the shaggy man felt sadly out of place.
<P>
Dorothy assured him that all her friends were welcome at Ozma's
palace, so he carefully dusted his shaggy shoes with his shaggy
handkerchief and entered the grand hall after the others.
<P>
Tik-tok lived at the Royal Palace and the Tin Woodman always had the
same room whenever he visited Ozma, so these two went at once to
remove the dust of the journey from their shining bodies.  Dorothy
also had a pretty suite of rooms which she always occupied when in the
Emerald City; but several servants walked ahead politely to show the
way, although she was quite sure she could find the rooms herself.
She took Button-Bright with her, because he seemed too small to be
left alone in such a big palace; but Jellia Jamb herself ushered the
beautiful Daughter of the Rainbow to her apartments, because it was
easy to see that Polychrome was used to splendid palaces and was
therefore entitled to especial attention.
