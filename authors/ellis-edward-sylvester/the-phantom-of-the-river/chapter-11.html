<p>Deane had rapidly regained control of his senses during the past
few minutes. The open air, the continued action of his body and
the growing consciousness of the imminent peril of the company,
combined to give him mastery over the insidious enemy that he
had taken into his mouth to steal away his brains.</p>

<p>By this time, too, his friends were convinced that he was not
talking at random, and that when he spoke of the "fort" near at
hand he had ground for his words.</p>

<p>"Wal, Jim," remarked Hastings, in a low voice, as the party gathered
closely around the fellow in the gloom; "I guess you understand
matters better than you did a few minutes ago. Take the lead and
we'll follow, but don't forget that a feller's eyes ain't of much
use to him just now."</p>

<p>"I, I think I've got my bearings; the river off here to the left
is how fur away?"</p>

<p>"Something like a hundred yards&mdash;a little more I reckon."</p>

<p>"That's what I thought, and Rattlesnake Gulch is right ahead.
Wal, in a straight line down the slope toward the river is a lot
of limbs, brush and stones that we got together some months ago,
when the varmints cornered us, or wiped us nearly all out. If
we're going to make a halt, that's the place for us."</p>

<p>"Go ahead, then, for it won't be long afore the varmints will
notice we have stopped."</p>

<p>The ranger&mdash;he paddled no longer&mdash;took charge of matters with
the assurance of one who feels himself master of the situation.
As they advanced, the ground inclined downward to the river. The
wood was quite open, but considerable undergrowth appeared, through
which it was impossible even for the rangers to make their way
in the darkness without some rustling, which was almost certain
to betray their movements to the Indians.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, they had not far to go to their destination.
Hastings, who was but a pace or two behind Deane, became conscious
at the end of a few minutes that he had stopped.</p>

<p>"Here we are," whispered the guide; "pass the word back for 'em
to look out they don't stumble, for things are rough round here."</p>

<p>Not only did the leader of the company notify his own men, who
were instant to understand the situation, but they assisted the
Ashbridges and Altmans into the exceedingly rude fortification.
The utmost care was used, but, in spite of all, there were several
stumbles, and more than one hasty exclamation at the accident.</p>

<p>When matters became clear to all, as they soon did, it was learned
that they were now upon the spot where Hastings and his companions
made their last stand when attacked by The Panther and his Shawanoes,
some months before. Foreseeing the desperate struggle at hand,
the scouts had seized the brief time at their command to throw
up some intrenchments.</p>

<p>An ash that had been splintered by lightning gave much help,
and laid the foundation, as may be said, of the fortification.
The trunk had been wrenched off a dozen feet above ground, leaving
the stump, with its hundreds of needle-like points, projecting
upward. The fragments of several large limbs were of help, and
a prostrate tree, some yards away, was of incalculable benefit,
even though the trunk was less than a foot in diameter.</p>

<p>Then there were a few boulders and large stones scattered around.
Ordinarily, a dozen men would hesitate to try to move them, but,
with the energy of desperation, these had been tumbled into place,
and served their part well.</p>

<p>The conclusion of all this haste and effort to throw up a protection
around themselves was, that a very primitive and broken fortification
extended in an irregular circle from the splintered tree, right
and left, until it enclosed a space thirty feet across at its
largest diameter. It was not a complete circle, however, but formed
three-fourths of one. The side toward the river was left open,
so as to preserve the means of retreat if the worst came.</p>

<p>The worst did come, as has been intimated, and through this opening
the few defenders that were left, after the resistless assault
of The Panther and his warriors, dashed in the supreme effort
to save their lives. Such is an imperfect description of the "fort"
into which the pioneers were conducted, when the time arrived
for them to essay no further concealment of their intention to
leave Rattlesnake Gulch wholly to itself.</p>

<p>Fifteen or twenty minutes were used by the fugitives, as they
may be considered, in "locating" themselves. In other words, they
improved the time in learning, so far as possible, their immediate
surroundings, and the best means of defence against the Shawanoes,
that were certain to leave them but a short time to themselves.</p>

<p>Above all things, it was necessary that Hastings and his men
should know this, and, with the help of Deane, the knowledge was
soon acquired. Finally, Hastings stationed his men in their proper
positions, and then conducted the others to a spot near the splintered
ash. He made sure that all were near him, and that each heard
every word he spoke, though he guarded the utterances with a care
that would have shut them from a listening Shawanoe a rod away.</p>

<p>"You understand, my friends, that this place is only a makeshift;
we're powerful lucky that Jim got sober in time to find it for
us. This is the safest spot, and here the women and children will
stay till we leave."</p>

<p>"And when is that likely to be?" asked Mr. Altman.</p>

<p>"I can't say till Kenton gets back; he'll be here afore long."</p>

<p>"Suppose anything happens to him and Boone?" suggested Mr. Ashbridge.</p>

<p>"Something like that has been said afore; Boone and Kenton are
always having something happen to them, but that both of 'em should
slip up and not show themselves agin&mdash;why, that sort of thing
can't be."</p>

<p>"It might take place," remarked young Ashbridge, whose faith
in the two great pioneers equaled that of Hastings, "but it is
so unlikely that it isn't worth considering it. As I understand
it, we have to wait here until Kenton comes back."</p>

<p>"You've hit it, younker, to a dot. You folks can see that a chap's
eyes ain't of much account, so you must all make the best use
of your ears."</p>

<p>"I can see a little," said Agnes Altman, "and I shall believe
that our eyes are almost as likely as our ears to help us."</p>

<p>"You've got a wise head on your shoulders," said the ranger,
admiringly. "About all that you folks need to remember is, that
the varmints are all around us, and where there's one of 'em,
he's sure to try some trick. Look out for him."</p>

<p>"Surely, Mr. Hastings, you don't mean that Mr. Altman and my
son shall all stay in this spot, merely to keep company with our
families, when every man is needed to guard the approaches to
this enclosure."</p>

<p>"Wal, I'll own that was my idea, but we can turn you to use if
you say so."</p>

<p>"We do say so, most decidedly," Mr. Altman was quick to remark.</p>

<p>"Come with me."</p>

<p>Thereupon, the leader of the rangers gave Mr. Altman, Ashbridge,
and the son their several stations. Each had his rifle, and was
simply to do his utmost to guard against the insidious approach
of the Shawanoes, who, if they had not already located them, were
certain to do so very soon.</p>

<p>The instructions of Hastings to his men was, that the moment
they discovered an Indian they should wait only long enough to
make sure of no mistake, and then shoot to kill.</p>

<p>"Every varmint counts at a time like this," he said, significantly,
"and if any one is lucky enough to drop The Panther, it'll be
worth a dozen warriors."</p>

<p>When all the male members were placed, they were crouching behind
boulders, limbs, and ridges of dirt in the irregular three-quarter
circle, and separated from each other by a space varying from
two yards to a distance twice as great.</p>

<p>Whether intentional or otherwise, Hastings stationed George Ashbridge
immediately on the left of Agnes Altman, while her mother, Mrs.
Ashbridge, and Mabel were near at hand. The lovers were so close,
indeed, that there was little risk in their exchanging a whispered
word or two at intervals. When either raised his or her head,
the other could catch the faint outlines of the loved one.</p>

<p>While the temporary refuge was a most fortunate thing for the
distressed fugitives, it had several features which caused uneasiness
to Hastings and his experienced rangers. Although the moon soon
appeared in the sky, its light was treacherous and uncertain,
because of the skurrying clouds. Sometimes an object would be
visible for a number of rods on the river, and then it took a
pair of keen eyes to identify a canoe at half that distance.</p>

<p>More serious, however, than all was the west wind. This blew
steadily, and with considerable force, directly upon the river.
It sighed among the trees, and so stirred the branches that the
rustling was continuous. Thus it afforded a diversion that was
wholly in favor of the Indians, for, without taking any special
precaution, they could approach as near as they chose to the fortification,
with little, if any, fear of detection.</p>

<p>That they would be quick to turn this to account was certain.</p>

<p>Hastings had not forgotten to impress his friends with the fact
that they were awaiting the coming of Simon Kenton, and incidentally
of Daniel Boone. Each, when he did appear, would do so with the
noiselessness of The Panther himself, and too great care could
not he taken to guard against mistaking them for enemies.</p>

<p>There really was little, if any, danger of this, since all understood
the situation, and would run no risk of harming their friends.
Furthermore, Kenton and Boone were sure to give timely notice
of their coming by means of signals which every one of the rangers
would understand.</p>

<p>The sleep of most of the men had been broken and scant during
the past twenty-four hours, but the situation was so strained
that there was no danger of any one falling asleep until the peril
passed. If any one thing was certain, it was that the watch within
that rough circle would be unremitting and vigilant while it lasted.</p>

<p>Mabel Ashbridge laid her head on the lap of her mother, who like
Mrs. Altman, sat with her back against the splintered ash, and
with little appreciation of the fearful shadow that rested upon
all, soon sank into unconsciousness. The mothers were so nervous
and unstrung that though they occasionally shut their eyes, the
slumber was fitful and brief.</p>

<p>But among all the party there was none more alert than Agnes
Altman. She had not yet quite forgiven herself for her weakness
in showing mercy to the imprisoned Panther the night before, when
he came within a hair of slaying her beloved George Ashbridge,
and, without hinting her intention to any one, she determined
that, with the help of heaven, she would do something to erase
that criminal imprudence, as she viewed it, on her part.</p>

<p>It may have been this resolution, supplemented by her own consummate
faculties of sight and vision, or, more properly, it was both,
that brought to her a knowledge of peril before it was suspected
by any one of the rangers, or even by George Ashbridge, who, as
may be said, was at her elbow.</p>

<p>Agnes was seated on the leaves, the same as her mother, and with
her back resting against a boulder, which rose a few inches above
her head. In this posture she closed her eyes. They could be of
no use to her, and by shutting them she was able to concentrate
her faculties into the single one of listening; upon that alone
she now placed her dependence.</p>

<p>And seated thus, and listening with absorbing intensity, she
speedily became aware of a startling fact; some one was directly
on the other side of the boulder, and separated by no more than
three feet from her.</p>

<p>That that some one was a Shawanoe Indian was as certain as that
her name was Agnes Altman.</p>
