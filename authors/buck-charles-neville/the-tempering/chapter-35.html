<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was almost a relief to Anne when she stood on the platform of the
dingy little station and waved her farewell to Boone, leaving for the
state capitol and his new duties. Of course, as she turned back to the
squalid vistas of the coal-mining town, a sinking loneliness assailed
her heart, but for Boone's safety she felt a blessed and compensating
security.
</p>
<p>Her father's recovery was slow and his convalescence tedious, and Anne's
diversion came in tramping the frost-sparkling hills and planning the
future that seemed as far away and dream-vague as the smoky mists on the
horizon rim.
</p><p>One morning as she walked briskly beyond the town she encountered an old
man who, after the simple and kindly custom of the hills, "stopped and
made his manners."
</p><p>"Howdy, ma'am," he began. "Hit's a tol'able keen an' nippy mornin',
hain't hit?"
</p><p>"Keen but fine," she smilingly replied, as her eyes lit with interest
for so pronounced a type. Had she seen him on the stage as representing
his people, she would have called the make-up a gross exaggeration. He
was tall and loose-jointed, and his long hair and beard fell in barbaric
raggedness about a face seamed with deep lines. But his eyes were shrewd
and bold, and he carried himself with a sort of innate dignity despite
the threadbare poorness of patched trousers and hickory shirt, and he
tramped the snowy hills coatless with ankles innocent of socks. The long
hickory with which he tapped the ground as he walked might have been the
staff of a biblical pilgrim, and they chatted affably until he reached
the question inevitable in all wayside meetings among hillmen.
</p><p>"My name's Cyrus Spradling, ma'am. What mout your'n be?"
</p><p>"Anne Masters," she told him. "My father is the superintendent of the
coal mine here."
</p><p>She was unprepared for the sudden and baleful transformation of face and
manner that swept over him with the announcement. A moment before he had
been affable, and her own eyes had sparkled delightedly at the
mother-wit of his observations and the quaint idiom and metaphor of his
speech. Now, in an instant, he stiffened into affronted rigidity, and
made no effort to conceal the black, almost malignant, wave of hostility
that usurped the recent mildness of his eyes.
</p><p>"Ye're ther same one that used ter be Boone Wellver's gal," he declared
scornfully; and the girl, accustomed to local idiosyncrasies, flushed
less at the direct personality of the statement than at the accusing
note of its delivery.
</p><p>"Used to be?" The question was the only response that for the instant of
surprise came to her mind.
</p><p>Cyrus Spradling spat on the ground as his staff beat a tattoo.
</p><p>"Wa'al, thet war y'ars back, an' ye hain't nuver wedded with him yit."
The old man stood there actually trembling with a rage induced by
something at which she had no means of guessing.
</p><p>She, too, drew herself up with a sudden stiffness and would have turned
away, but he was prompter.
</p><p>"Hit 'pears like no woman won't hev him! I reckon I don't blame 'em
none, nuther. I disgusts ther feller my own self," and before she could
gather any key to the extraordinary incident, he had gone trudging on,
mumbling the while into his unshaven beard.
</p><p>Anne walked perplexedly homeward, and out of it all she could winnow
only one kernel of comprehensible detail. Obviously she had met an enemy
of Boone's, and yet she had heard Mr. McCalloway speak with warmth of
the neighbourly kindness of Cyrus Spradling.
</p><p>When she entered the house her father was sitting before the hearth,
somewhat emaciated after his tedious convalescence, and his eyes
followed her with a wistful dependence as she measured his medicine and
rearranged the pillows at his back.
</p><p>When, finally, she, too, drew a chair close to the blaze, the man said
seriously:
</p><p>"When your mother was your age, Anne, you had been born."
</p><p>To this statistical announcement, the obvious response being denied by
kindness, she made no answer. Perhaps she could not help reflecting had
her mother been more deliberate, many years of discontent might have
been escaped.
</p><p>"My family has little to thank me for," observed Masters at last, with a
candour that the daughter found embarrassing. "Conversely, I dare say, I
have little claim to expect much--and yet even life's derelicts are
subject to human emotions."
</p><p>"For instance, Daddy?"
</p><p>"Tom Wallifarro stands pretty close to his allotment of three score and
ten," came the thoughtful answer. "Neither your mother nor I is exactly
young. It would be a comfort to think of you as settled, with your own
life plans drawn and arranged."
</p><p>The girl smiled up at him from her low chair. "Daddy," she said softly,
"you know what I'm waiting for. You're the one person of my own blood
that I can take into full confidence, because you're the only one who
doesn't think of my life as a piece of cloth to be cut and fitted to
Morgan's measure, whether it suits me or not. You've never said much,
but I've known you were on my side."
</p><p>For the first time in her memory her father was not immediately
responsive. His hand falling on her bright head rested there with a
dubious touch, and his eyes were irresolutely clouded.
</p><p>"I wonder, dear," he said slowly, "whether, after all, I don't agree
with the others--in part, at least. All my life I've been an insurgent,
scorning the caution of the provident, and paying a beastly stiff price
for my mutiny against smugly accepted rules of the game."
</p><p>"A woman has only one life to share," she answered firmly. "It's not
exactly insurgency to insist on loving the man."
</p><p>After a little he inquired, "You <u>are</u> fond of Morgan, though, aren't
you? If there were no Boone Wellver, for instance, you might even love
him, mightn't you?"
</p><p>"There is a Boone, though." She spoke quietly but with a finality that
seemed to close the doors upon discussion, and a silence followed.
</p><p>Finally, however, Larry Masters cleared his throat in an embarrassed
fashion. "I spoke a while back of wanting to see you protected in the
shelter of a home. Since we've embarked on the subject, I'm going to
tell you something more. A certain truth has been carefully withheld
from you, and I believe you ought to know it."
</p><p>"What truth?" Her eyes widened a little, and the man shifted his
position uneasily.
</p><p>"The true realization of how deeply we all stand in Tom Wallifarro's
debt," he made blunt response.
</p><p>"I've always known," she hastily declared, "that he's been a fairy
godfather, and given me things--luxurious things--that mother's income
couldn't run to."
</p><p>Larry Masters laughed with a shade of bitterness.
</p><p>"Your mother has never had any income, Anne. As for myself, there's
never been a time since you were a baby when I could make buckle and
tongue meet. That's the whole ugly truth. House-rent, clothes, food,
education, everything, necessities as well as comforts, livelihood as
well as luxuries--the whole lot and parcel have come to my wife and my
daughter from the generous hand of Tom Wallifarro. But for that, God
knows what their lives would have been."
</p><p>Anne Masters rose and stood unsteadily on the rag rug before the stone
flaggings of the hearth.
</p><p>"You mean ... that we ... have ... been actual dependents on his
kindness--that we've just been ... charity ... parasites?"
</p><p>The girl's hands came to her bosom and a shiver ran through her. The
warm flood of colour left her cheeks, and her eyes were deep with
chagrined amazement.
</p><p>The man did not answer the questions, and she went on with another:
</p><p>"Do you mean ... for I must know ... that we've lived as we have on
nothing but ... generous charity?... That he's been paying all these
years what it cost ... to raise me properly ... for his son?"
</p><p>"Hold on, Anne--" The convalescent raised an admonitory hand. "There's
danger of doing people who love you a grave injustice. Tom Wallifarro
would go to his grave with his lips sealed, though torture were used to
open them, before he would seek to coerce you or make you unhappy. If
you've never been told the facts, it was because he preferred that there
should be no burdensome sense of obligation."
</p><p>"But always," Anne insisted faintly, as though oppressed by poignant
physical pain, "he has done these things ... with the one ... idea ...
that I was to be ... his son's wife."
</p><p>"I should rather say," quietly amended Larry Masters, "with that dream
and hope."
</p><p>"And, Mother," she asked, in a strangely strained voice, "Mother has
assured him that ... when the time comes ... she could ... deliver the
goods?"
</p><p>Larry had seen Anne in childhood transports of passion, but never before
cold and white in such a stillness of wrath as that which transformed
her now. Her eyes made him feel the accomplice in some monstrous traffic
upon his daughter's womanhood, and it was difficult to remain complacent
under her cross-examining.
</p><p>"Your mother has had the same dream and hope. If the marriage was not
repugnant to you, I dare say it would take cavilling to criticize it."
</p><p>"You don't see, then ..."--the girl felt suddenly faint and dizzy as she
moved a little to the side and leaned inertly against the wall--"you
don't see that the very chivalry of Uncle Tom's conduct ... enslaves me
a ... hundred times ... more strongly ... than a cruder effort to force
me? You don't see that ... he's paid for me ... and that if Boone came
today ... with a marriage license ... I couldn't marry him ... without
feeling that I must buy ... myself back first?"
</p><p>"That, of course, my dear, is a morbid and distorted view."
</p><p>"Is it? Haven't I eaten the food and worn out the clothes and acquired
the education that were all only items of an investment for Morgan's
future? Haven't I used these payments made on that investment only to
take them away from him and give them to some one else? I haven't even
been given the chance of protest against these chains of damnable
kindness."
</p><p>"You seem, my dear, to have given your heart to Boone, and that settles
it, I suppose. I might wish it otherwise--Tom and your mother may still
cling to the other hope, but--"
</p><p>"You say I've given my heart to Boone," she interrupted fiercely, "but I
find that it wasn't mine to give. I find that I wasn't a free agent. I
had already been mortgaged and remortgaged for things not only used by
me but by my mother, and--" She paused, and Masters added with a twisted
smile of chagrin,
</p><p>"Yes--and your father."
</p><p>"But how about Boone?" she demanded. "What of the debt owed to him? Did
they have the right to barter off his happiness as well as mine?"
</p><p>"Tom Wallifarro," her father gravely reminded her, "has been a
benefactor to Boone. Tom Wallifarro has not complained. Moreover, the
wounds of youth are not quite so fatal as they seem when one suffers
them. If they were, few men would live to middle-age. I dare say Boone
would survive even if he lost you."
</p><p>Anne's brain was dizzy and stunned. Mortification and wretchedness were
blurring the focus of her vision, and this suggestion that after all she
was exaggerating her importance in Boone Wellver's life seemed the
dictum she could not allow to pass unchallenged. With an instinctive
lashing out of her hot emotions she pitched the battle on that single
issue, an issue which seemed to determine whether after all she was
fighting in fairness and clean conscience for independence, or only
clinging to a selfishness that trod toward its gratification on the
happiness of others.
</p><p>"Prove that to me," she retorted in the same cold fury. "Prove that he
doesn't need me and that I'm thinking only of myself, and I'll marry
anybody you say. I'll obediently deliver myself over and say, 'Here's
your marriageable asset. Do what you like with it.'"
</p><p>Her words had not been torrential, but glacially cold and hard under the
congealing pressure of indignation, but now the tone broke into
something like a sob, as she declared:
</p><p>"Boone has had only one girl in his life. His whole scheme has been
built about me. Show me that a love like that is only a whim, and I'll
agree that this chattel idea of marriage is as good as any other, and
I'll submit to it."
</p><p>Swiftly Larry Masters repressed a smile. Anne, he reflected, did not
realize how often that refurbished fiction has been retailed as an axiom
by young hearts in equinox.
</p><p>"Why did you smile, Father?" she demanded militantly, and he shook his
heed.
</p><p>"I was only reflecting," he assured her, "that every girl thinks that of
every man she loves."
</p><p>"Do you know of anything to disprove it in the present case?"
</p><p>"Since you ask," he made hesitant reply, "I did hear some
unsubstantiated rumours hereabouts that he had proposed and been
rejected by a mountain girl--Cyrus Spradling's daughter."
</p><p>Cyrus Spradling's daughter! At the name, Anne saw again the lank
mountaineer of the loose joints and the uncombed hair, who this morning
had parted from her mumbling maledictions against Boone.
</p><p>He had been a mystery then. Now his name falling into the conversation
like a shell that has found its range, had the demoralizing force of an
explosion. Her belief was no weathervane to veer lightly, but the bruise
on her heart was sensitive even to the touch of a breeze, and it was
freshly sore.
</p><p>"Who--ever told you that," she asseverated in slow syllables, "was a
liar. I'd gamble my life on it." Then having made her confession of
faith in those staunch terms, she illogically demanded, "When was this
alleged affair?"
</p><p>"Just after he finished college, I believe. I can't be quite sure."
</p><p>"At that time," said Anne Masters, "and before that, and after that,
Boone loved me. It was no divided or vacillating love. I'm so sure of
him that I'm perfectly willing to stake everything on it. I'm willing,
if I'm wrong, even to pay off my mortgage!"
</p><p>"Since you take that view," said her father, "I'm sorry to have repeated
the story. I hadn't regarded it as so damning, myself. Young men
sometimes love more than once without forfeiting all human respect. You
might ask Boone about it? I don't fancy he'd lie to you."
</p><p>"I will ask him," she vehemently declared, "and if there's any atom of
truth in it--and I know there isn't--I don't care whom I marry or what
happens afterwards! As to Uncle Tom, I don't think I can go on another
day being his charity child."
</p><p>"If you don't, you'll break his heart," her father told her, in a voice
of urgent persuasiveness. "For the present, at least, you must regard
what I've told you as Masonically confidential."
</p><p>"Why?"
</p><p>"Because he would see himself as having hurt you where he sought only to
be a loving magician with a wand of kindness, and I'm not the man to
injure him like that." He hesitated, and the climax of his statement
came with explosive suddenness. "Good God, Anne, he's just saved me from
disgrace."
</p><p>Then came the story of Colonel Wallifarro's latest benefaction, and at
the end of it the girl pressed her hands to temples that were hot.
</p><p>"I think," she said falteringly, "I'll go out for a while where the air
is fresher. It's very close in here."
</p><p>The door closed silently, almost stealthily, behind her, and Masters
thought she walked with the noiseless care of one moving in a chamber of
death.
