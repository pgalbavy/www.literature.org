<p>Jack Carleton fixed his eyes on his cap, wondering how near the
Sank could come to it. Feeling some misgiving, he took several
more steps backward, until he was fully five yards from the pendant
headgear.</p>

<p><em>Twang</em> went the bow-string, and the next instant something
flashed so close to the eyes of the youth that he winked and flirted
his head backward. The arrow had missed his nose by less than
an inch!</p>

<p>"Well, that's the greatest shooting I ever saw!" exclaimed Jack,
when he turned and saw where the missile, after clipping some
leaves near at hand, had fallen to the ground. "Hold on!" he called,
with a gesture which the Sauk understood, "if you are going to
try it again, aim at <em>me</em>; then I'll be safe."</p>

<p>Hay-uta was as much astonished as he&mdash;so much so, indeed, that
he stood staring, neither smiling nor making any move to launch
another shaft. Jack ran and picked up the arrow that had been
discharged, for the quiver was not full and Deerfoot had none
to throw away.</p>

<p>When the youth rejoined the warrior, the latter handed him the
bow, as though glad to be relieved of it, but seeing he had done
no harm, he made a successful attempt to grin.</p>

<p>"Hay-uta, you are not to be blamed because you ain't half as
handsome nor smart as other folks; it is no fault of yours if
nature made you a fool; you are entitled to pity; but if you want
to learn something about handling a bow just study <em>my</em>
style."</p>

<p>The reason Jack Carleton talked in this fashion was because he
knew the one whom he addressed could not understand a word of
what was said. Nevertheless, Hay-uta looked upon his actions with
interest; for, feeling assured that the shot could not be as bad
as his, the chances were that it would be much better.</p>

<p>Conscious of what was expected of him, the young Kentuckian (who
could not repress a smile over the performance of the Sauk), did
his utmost to make a shot which would command the admiration of
the only spectator with whom he was favored.</p>

<p>"I'm in a peculiar situation," reflected the youth, as he fitted
the same arrow to the string, "for I am to try to hit a target
which I don't want to hit. I don't suppose there's much danger,
but I would like to beat Hay-uta."</p>

<p>The latter walked to the stump of the limb on which hung the
cap, but he showed his wisdom by dodging behind the trunk of a
tree large enough to shield his body. Jack laughed when he observed
him peeping timidly from behind this cover.</p>

<p>"I'll point a little to one side of my cap," reflected the youth,
"and if I elevate my aim a little, as Deerfoot does, I ought to
come pretty near it."</p>

<p>His manner of discharging the bow was similar to that of the
Sauk. He slowly drew back his right hand, whose thumb and forefinger
inclosed the arrow and string, until his strength was at the highest
tension, when he let go.</p>

<p>The aim could not have been improved, for it was a "bull's eye".
The flint-pointed shaft tore its way through the top of the cap,
which was carried off its support and dropped to the ground with
the feathered part of the missile sticking in the air.</p>

<p>Hay-uta ran from behind the tree, picked up the target with the
head of the arrow tangled in it, and held up the two in view of
the young Kentuckian, who viewed them with dismay.</p>

<p>"Great CÃ¦sar!" he exclaimed, "I believe I've ruined my cap!"</p>

<p>But as that which had been done could not be undone, he put on
the best face possible. He waved his hand and nodded his head,
as though he was not unduly proud over his own success.</p>

<p>"That's the way I always manage those things," he said, loftily,
"put it up again."</p>

<p>The Sauk saw what he meant and replaced the cap, from which he
first drew the destructive arrow, with a good deal of recklessness
as it seemed to the owner, who plainly caught the gleam of daylight
through the top, when it slightly oscillated for a moment on its
perch.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose another shot will hurt it much, so I'll send
this one right in the track of the first; then Hay-uta will know
that my skill is next to Deerfoot's, and it won't be necessary
to do any more shooting with this plagued bow."</p>

<p>The second missile was launched with more care than the first,
Jack doing his very best to make a center shot; but the result
was astounding: the arrow impinged against the tree behind which
the Sauk had shrunk, chipped away a piece of the bark, and skipped
off at a sharp angle, just as did the glancing missile which slew
the ancient king of England, when hunting in the forest.</p>

<p>It looked to the amateur as if Hay-uta, when he thrust his face
from behind the trunk was grinning to an extent that endangered
his ears. Nothing could have been more eloquent than his gesture,
when he pointed to the untouched cap, then at the tree from which
the bark had been chipped, and then with a still more overwhelming
smile indicated the spot where the erratic arrow lay at rest.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton flung the bow to the ground (as if it were to blame
for his miserable work), but he could not help laughing when the
Sauk brought back cap and arrows, and gravely handed them to him.</p>

<p>"If there was any chance of my hitting the mark," said the youth
to himself, "I might lead him to believe I missed it on purpose,
but likely enough my third shot would be wilder than the second,
so I'll resign my commission."</p>

<p>A brief examination of his cap showed that the shaft had inflicted
a ragged rent, but when the strong material was pushed and doubled
together, a good deal of the air was prevented from entering through
the opening. The arrows were replaced in the quiver, the bow unstrung,
and the two "shook themselves together", as the expression goes.</p>

<p>The forenoon was well along and the air promised to be warmer
than on the previous day, though, where the shade was so abundant,
it could not be oppressive.</p>

<p>It was not likely that any thing would be seen of Deerfoot until
he chose to present himself to them, but, as if in obedience to
the same impulse, the two moved toward the river-bank, which was
close at hand.</p>

<p>Jack allowed the Sauk to keep in advance, for he did not mean
to make any observation for himself. They were only a few paces
apart when the lad caught the gleam of water among the trees in
front and stopped, while the warrior stepped to the edge with
the guarded step he always used at such times. While the surface
of the river was partially visible when looking through the limbs,
yet the undergrowth almost shut off the view if one stepped down
the sloping bank. Just as he had done many times before, the Sauk
reached his right hand forward and parted the vegetation, so as
to clear the way in front.</p>

<p>A glance was enough; near the middle of the river and almost
opposite where they stood was an Indian canoe containing six Pawnees,
two of whom were paddling the boat straight for the bank on which
the Sauk and young Kentuckian had been practicing archery.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton saw that his friend had made some discovery, and
he stepped quickly to his side. He did not heed the warning gesture
of Hay-uta, and it took only a few seconds to learn the whole
truth. Both moved back, allowing the leaves to close again. The
Sauk then lay flat on his face and the lad did the same; in that
posture neither could be detected by any parties on the river.</p>

<p>It was noteworthy that, although the Pawnees were using no special
caution in crossing the river, and though they were but a few
rods distant, yet the swinging of their paddles and the advance
of the canoe were so noiseless that Hay-uta and Jack only discovered
them, as may be said, by accident.</p>

<p>Without taking time to consider the significance of the proceeding,
the friends on shore must needs use great care to avoid a dangerous
complication. If the Pawnees should learn where they were, the
chances were ten to one that they would either kill or capture
both.</p>

<p>There was good ground, however, to hope that delicate as was
the situation of our friends they were likely to escape. Although
nearly opposite to the Sauk, when he first saw the party, and
heading as they were for the spot where he stood, yet the swift
current carried the boat downward, so that it was sure to land
a distance below. The footprints made by Jack Carleton, Hay-uta
and Deerfoot did not lie in that direction, and, therefore, the
peril was at its minimum, unless some impulse should lead the
Pawnees to turn and move up stream. It remained to be seen whether
that would be the case.</p>

<p>The two, therefore, lay still, listening and peering into the
shrubbery and undergrowth which grew between them and the margin
of the river. The straining ear was able to catch the faint sound
of a ripple against the prow of the heavy laden canoe, and once
or twice the dip of the paddle was heard. Then the Pawnee who
was the leader said something in the guttural voice peculiar to
his race, and one of his warriors answered.</p>

<p>All this was a relief to the couple, for it was proof that no
one in the canoe suspected the truth, they had no thought that
two of the parties whom, most probably, they were seeking, were
anywhere near them.</p>

<p>The soft rippling sound which occasionally came to the watchers
showed that the canoe was drifting with the current and that it
would land at a point fully fifty feet below. Hay-uta and Jack
ventured to raise their heads a few inches, and, as they did so,
caught a glimpse of the boat and its occupants, as it ran sharply
against the bank and the warriors began stepping out.</p>

<p>This was a critical moment, and lowering their heads, they pressed
the ground as closely as they could. Jack half wished that some
car of Juggernaut might roll over them, so as to flatten them
still more.</p>

<p>The grunting of voices was plainly heard, while the Indians stood
close to the boat and discussed some question. Had Jack and his
companion raised their heads, as they did a few minutes before,
they would have seen every one of them. The Sauk did elevate his
nose, just enough to gain an indistinct view of the nearest Pawnee,
but the youthful Kentuckian lay with his ear against the ground.
Soft as were the footfalls of their enemies, the sound reached
him through the better conducting medium of the earth.</p>

<p>"Suppose the Pawnees <em>do</em> come this way&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>This was the question which, presented itself to the youth, and
which, naturally enough, caused him misgiving, for, beyond all
doubt, the peril was critical. If the Pawnees moved up stream,
nothing could save the two from discovery, and it then would be
two against six&mdash;all brave and well armed. The former could make
no stand before a force three times as strong as they, and their
situation could scarcely be improved by flight. Grave as was the
crisis, it was rendered still graver by the fact that Jack and
Hay-uta could not talk to each other. At such a time, a perfect
understanding must exist between the members of the weaker force,
and I have shown that in the present instance, that was impossible.</p>

<p>"Ah, if Deerfoot were only here," was the prayer that trembled
on Jack Carleton's lips more than once, while he lay on the ground
listening to the grumble of voices so close at hand.</p>

<p>"It was queer on his part any way," added the youth, following
the line of thought forced upon him; "just when we need him the
most he is gone; the Sauk is a good fellow, but he can't compare
with Deerfoot. Helloa!" he muttered, noticing a movement on the
part of Hay-uta, "something is up."</p>
