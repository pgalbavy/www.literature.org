<p>Sir Daniel and his men lay in and about Kettley that night, warmly
quartered and well patrolled. But the Knight of Tunstall was one who
never rested from money-getting; and even now, when he was on the brink
of an adventure which should make or mar him, he was up an hour after
midnight to squeeze poor neighbours. He was one who trafficked greatly
in disputed inheritances; it was his way to buy out the most unlikely
claimant, and then, by the favour he curried with great lords about the
king, procure unjust decisions in his favour; or, if that was too
roundabout, to seize the disputed manor by force of arms, and rely on
his influence and Sir Oliver's cunning in the law to hold what he had
snatched. Kettley was one such place; it had come very lately into his
clutches; he still met with opposition from the tenants; and it was to
overawe discontent that he had led his troops that way.
</p><p>By two in the morning, Sir Daniel sat in the inn room, close by the
fireside, for it was cold at that hour among the fens of Kettley. By his
elbow stood a pottle of spiced ale. He had taken off his visored
headpiece, and sat with his bald head and thin, dark visage resting on
one hand, wrapped warmly in a sanguine-coloured cloak. At the lower end
of the room about a dozen of his men stood sentry over the door or lay
asleep on benches; and somewhat nearer hand, a young lad, apparently of
twelve or thirteen, was stretched in a mantle on the floor. The host of
the Sun stood before the great man.
</p><p>"Now, mark me, mine host," Sir Daniel said, "follow but mine orders, and
I shall be your good lord ever. I must have good men for head boroughs,
and I will have Adam-a-More high constable; see to it narrowly. If other
men be chosen, it shall avail you nothing; rather it shall be found to
your sore cost. For those that have paid rent to Walsingham I shall take
good measure--you among the rest, mine host."
</p><p>"Good knight," said the host, "I will swear upon the cross of Holywood I
did but pay to Walsingham upon compulsion. Nay, bully knight, I love not
the rogue Walsinghams; they were as poor as thieves, bully knight. Give
me a great lord like you. Nay; ask me among the neighbours, I am stout
for Brackley."
</p><p>"It may be," said Sir Daniel, drily. "Ye shall then pay twice."
</p><p>The innkeeper made a horrid grimace; but this was a piece of bad luck
that might readily befall a tenant in these unruly times, and he was
perhaps glad to make his peace so easily.
</p><p>"Bring up yon fellow, Selden!" cried the knight.
</p><p>And one of his retainers led up a poor, cringing old man, as pale as a
candle, and all shaking with the fen fever.
</p><p>"Sirrah," said Sir Daniel, "your name?"
</p><p>[Illustration: <u>"Now, mark me, mine host," Sir Daniel said, "follow but
mine orders, and I shall be your good lord ever"</u>]
</p><p>"An't please your worship," replied the man, "my name is
Condall--Condall of Shoreby, at your good worship's pleasure."
</p><p>"I have heard you ill reported on," returned the knight. "Ye deal in
treason, rogue; ye trudge the country leasing; y'are heavily suspicioned
of the death of severals. How, fellow, are ye so bold? But I will bring
you down."
</p><p>"Right honourable and my reverend lord," the man cried, "here is some
hodge-podge, saving your good presence. I am but a poor private man, and
have hurt none."
</p><p>"The under-sheriff did report of you most vilely," said the knight.
"'Seize me,' saith he, 'that Tyndal of Shoreby.'"
</p><p>"Condall, my good lord; Condall is my poor name," said the unfortunate.
</p><p>"Condall or Tyndal, it is all one," replied Sir Daniel, coolly. "For, by
my sooth, y'are here, and I do mightily suspect your honesty. If ye
would save your neck, write me swiftly an obligation for twenty pound."
</p><p>"For twenty pound, my good lord!" cried Condall. "Here is midsummer
madness! My whole estate amounteth not to seventy shillings."
</p><p>"Condall or Tyndal," returned Sir Daniel, grinning, "I will run my peril
of that loss. Write me down twenty, and when I have recovered all I may,
I will be good lord to you, and pardon you the rest."
</p><p>"Alas! my good lord, it may not be; I have no skill to write," said
Condall.
</p><p>"Well-a-day!" returned the knight. "Here, then, is no remedy. Yet I
would fain have spared you, Tyndal, had my conscience suffered. Selden,
take me this old shrew softly to the nearest elm, and hang me him
tenderly by the neck, where I may see him at my riding. Fare ye well,
good Master Condall, dear Master Tyndal; y'are post-haste for Paradise;
fare ye then well!"
</p><p>"Nay, my right pleasant lord," replied Condall, forcing an obsequious
smile, "an ye be so masterful, as doth right well become you, I will
even, with all my poor skill, do your good bidding."
</p><p>"Friend," quoth Sir Daniel, "ye will now write two-score. Go to! y'are
too cunning for a livelihood of seventy shillings. Selden, see him write
me this in good form, and have it duly witnessed."
</p><p>And Sir Daniel, who was a very merry knight, none merrier in England,
took a drink of his mulled ale, and lay back, smiling.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the boy upon the floor began to stir, and presently sat up
and looked about him with a scare.
</p><p>"Hither," said Sir Daniel; and as the other rose at his command and came
slowly towards him, he leaned back and laughed outright. "By the rood!"
he cried, "a sturdy boy!"
</p><p>The lad flushed crimson with anger, and darted a look of hate out of his
dark eyes. Now that he was on his legs, it was more difficult to make
certain of his age. His face looked somewhat older in expression, but it
was as smooth as a young child's; and in bone and body he was unusually
slender, and somewhat awkward of gait.
</p><p>"Ye have called me, Sir Daniel," he said. "Was it to laugh at my poor
plight?"
</p><p>"Nay, now, let laugh," said the knight. "Good shrew, let laugh, I pray
you. An ye could see yourself, I warrant ye would laugh the first."
</p><p>"Well," cried the lad, flushing, "ye shall answer this when ye answer
for the other. Laugh while yet ye may!"
</p><p>"Nay, now, good cousin," replied Sir Daniel, with some earnestness,
"think not that I mock at you, except in mirth, as between kinsfolk and
singular friends. I will make you a marriage of a thousand pounds, go
to! and cherish you exceedingly. I took you, indeed, roughly, as the
time demanded; but from henceforth I shall ungrudgingly maintain and
cheerfully serve you. Ye shall be Mrs. Shelton--Lady Shelton, by my
troth! for the lad promiseth bravely. Tut! ye will not shy for honest
laughter; it purgeth melancholy. They are no rogues who laugh, good
cousin. Good mine host, lay me a meal now for my cousin, Master John.
Sit ye down, sweetheart, and eat."
</p><p>"Nay," said Master John, "I will break no bread. Since ye force me to
this sin, I will fast for my soul's interest. But, good mine host, I
pray you of courtesy give me a cup of fair water; I shall be much
beholden to your courtesy indeed."
</p><p>"Ye shall have a dispensation, go to!" cried the knight. "Shalt be well
shriven, by my faith! Content you, then, and eat."
</p><p>But the lad was obstinate, drank a cup of water, and, once more wrapping
himself closely in his mantle, sat in a far corner, brooding.
</p><p>In an hour or two, there rose a stir in the village of sentries
challenging and the clatter of arms and horses; and then a troop drew up
by the inn door, and Richard Shelton, splashed with mud, presented
himself upon the threshold.
</p><p>"Save you, Sir Daniel," he said.
</p><p>"How! Dickie Shelton!" cried the knight; and at the mention of Dick's
name the other lad looked curiously across. "What maketh Bennet Hatch?"
</p><p>"Please you, sir knight, to take cognisance of this packet from Sir
Oliver, wherein are all things fully stated," answered Richard,
presenting the priest's letter. "And please you farther, ye were best
make all speed to Risingham; for on the way hither we encountered one
riding furiously with letters, and by his report, my Lord of Risingham
was sore bested, and lacked exceedingly your presence."
</p><p>"How say you? Sore bested?" returned the knight. "Nay, then, we will
make speed sitting down, good Richard. As the world goes in this poor
realm of England, he that rides softliest rides surest. Delay, they say,
begetteth peril; but it is rather this itch of doing that undoes men;
mark it, Dick. But let me see, first, what cattle ye have brought.
Selden, a link here at the door!"
</p><p>And Sir Daniel strode forth into the village street, and, by the red
glow of a torch, inspected his new troops. He was an unpopular neighbour
and an unpopular master; but as a leader in war he was well beloved by
those who rode behind his pennant. His dash, his proved courage, his
forethought for the soldiers' comfort, even his rough gibes, were all to
the taste of the bold blades in jack and salet.
</p><p>"Nay, by the rood!" he cried, "what poor dogs are these? Here be some
as crooked as a bow, and some as lean as a spear. Friends, ye shall ride
in the front of the battle; I can spare you, friends. Mark me this old
villain on the piebald! A two-year mutton riding on a hog would look
more soldierly! Ha! Clipsby, are ye there, old rat? Y'are a man I could
lose with a good heart; ye shall go in front of all, with a bull's eye
painted on your jack, to be the better butt for archery; sirrah, ye
shall show me the way."
</p><p>"I will show you any way, Sir Daniel, but the way to change sides,"
returned Clipsby, sturdily.
</p><p>Sir Daniel laughed a guffaw.
</p><p>"Why, well said!" he cried. "Hast a shrewd tongue in thy mouth, go to! I
will forgive you for that merry word. Selden, see them fed, both man and
brute."
</p><p>The knight re-entered the inn.
</p><p>"Now, friend Dick," he said, "fall to. Here is good ale and bacon. Eat,
while that I read."
</p><p>Sir Daniel opened the packet, and as he read his brow darkened. When he
had done he sat a little, musing. Then he looked sharply at his ward.
</p><p>"Dick," said he, "y' have seen this penny rhyme?"
</p><p>The lad replied in the affirmative.
</p><p>"It bears your father's name," continued the knight; "and our poor shrew
of a parson is, by some mad soul, accused of slaying him."
</p><p>"He did most eagerly deny it," answered Dick.
</p><p>"He did?" cried the knight, very sharply. "Heed him not. He has a loose
tongue; he babbles like a jack-sparrow. Some day, when I may find the
leisure, Dick, I will myself more fully inform you of these matters.
There was one Duckworth shrewdly blamed for it; but the times were
troubled, and there was no justice to be got."
</p><p>"It befell at the Moat House?" Dick ventured, with a beating at his
heart.
</p><p>"It befell between the Moat House and Holywood," replied Sir Daniel,
calmly; but he shot a covert glance, black with suspicion, at Dick's
face. "And now," added the knight, "speed you with your meal; ye shall
return to Tunstall with a line from me."
</p><p>Dick's face fell sorely.
</p><p>"Prithee, Sir Daniel," he cried, "send one of the villains! I beseech
you let me to the battle. I can strike a stroke, I promise you."
</p><p>"I misdoubt it not," replied Sir Daniel, sitting down to write. "But
here, Dick, is no honour to be won. I lie in Kettley till I have sure
tidings of the war, and then ride to join me with the conqueror. Cry not
on cowardice; it is but wisdom, Dick; for this poor realm so tosseth
with rebellion, and the king's name and custody so changeth hands, that
no man may be certain of the morrow. Toss-pot and Shuttle-wit run in,
but my Lord Good-Counsel sits o' one side, waiting."
</p><p>With that, Sir Daniel, turning his back to Dick, and quite at the
farther end of the long table, began to write his letter, with his mouth
on one side, for this business of the Black Arrow stuck sorely in his
throat.
</p><p>Meanwhile, young Shelton was going on heartily enough with his
breakfast, when he felt a touch upon his arm, and a very soft voice
whispering in his ear.
</p><p>"Make not a sign, I do beseech you," said the voice, "but of your
charity tell me the straight way to Holywood. Beseech you, now, good
boy, comfort a poor soul in peril and extreme distress, and set me so
far forth upon the way to my repose."
</p><p>"Take the path by the windmill," answered Dick, in the same tone; "it
will bring you to Till Ferry; there inquire again."
</p><p>And without turning his head, he fell again to eating. But with the tail
of his eye he caught a glimpse of the young lad called Master John
stealthily creeping from the room.
</p><p>"Why," thought Dick, "he is as young as I. 'Good boy' doth he call me?
An I had known, I should have seen the varlet hanged ere I had told him.
Well, if he goes through the fen, I may come up with him and pull his
ears."
</p><p>Half an hour later, Sir Daniel gave Dick the letter, and bade him speed
to the Moat House. And, again, some half an hour after Dick's departure,
a messenger came, in hot haste, from my Lord of Risingham.
</p><p>"Sir Daniel," the messenger said, "ye lose great honour, by my sooth!
The fight began again this morning ere the dawn, and we have beaten
their van and scattered their right wing. Only the main battle standeth
fast. An we had your fresh men, we should tilt you them all into the
river. What, sir knight! Will ye be the last? It stands not with your
good credit."
</p><p>"Nay," cried the knight, "I was but now upon the march. Selden, sound me
the tucket. Sir, I am with you on the instant. It is not two hours since
the more part of my command came in, sir messenger. What would ye have?
Spurring is good meat, but yet it killed the charger. Bustle, boys!"
</p><p>By this time the tucket was sounding cheerily in the morning, and from
all sides Sir Daniel's men poured into the main street and formed before
the inn. They had slept upon their arms, with chargers saddled, and in
ten minutes five-score men-at-arms and archers, cleanly equipped and
briskly disciplined, stood ranked and ready. The chief part were in Sir
Daniel's livery, murrey and blue, which gave the greater show to their
array. The best armed rode first; and away out of sight, at the tail of
the column, came the sorry reinforcement of the night before. Sir Daniel
looked with pride along the line.
</p><p>"Here be the lads to serve you in a pinch," he said.
</p><p>"They are pretty men, indeed," replied the messenger. "It but augments
my sorrow that ye had not marched the earlier."
</p><p>"Well," said the knight, "what would ye? The beginning of a feast and
the end of a fray, sir messenger"; and he mounted into his saddle. "Why!
how now!" he cried. "John! Joanna! Nay, by the sacred rood! where is
she? Host, where is that girl?"
</p><p>"Girl, Sir Daniel?" cried the landlord. "Nay, sir, I saw no girl."
</p><p>"Boy, then, dotard!" cried the knight. "Could ye not see it was a wench?
She in the murrey-coloured mantle--she that broke her fast with water,
rogue--where is she?"
</p><p>"Nay, the saints bless us! Master John, ye called him," said the host.
"Well, I thought none evil. He is gone. I saw him--her--I saw her in the
stable a good hour agone; 'a was saddling a grey horse."
</p><p>"Now, by the rood!" cried Sir Daniel, "the wench was worth five hundred
pound to me and more."
</p><p>"Sir knight," observed the messenger, with bitterness, "while that ye
are here, roaring for five hundred pounds, the realm of England is
elsewhere being lost and won."
</p><p>"It is well said," replied Sir Daniel. "Selden, fall me out with six
cross-bowmen; hunt me her down. I care not what it cost; but, at my
returning, let me find her at the Moat House. Be it upon your head. And
now, sir messenger, we march."
</p><p>And the troop broke into a good trot, and Selden and his six men were
left behind upon the street of Kettley, with the staring villagers.
