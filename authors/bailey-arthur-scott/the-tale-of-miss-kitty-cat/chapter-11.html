<p>THERE wasn't a bird on the farm that didn't dislike Miss Kitty Cat. And
there was only one bird family that didn't live in dread of her. That
was the Wren family. And they had a good reason for feeling safe from
Miss Kitty.
</p>
<p>Miss Kitty Cat always spluttered whenever she unbent herself enough to
talk with anybody about Rusty Wren and his busy little wife, who had
their home in the cherry tree outside Farmer Green's window.
</p><p>"The Wrens needn't feel so proud of their house," Miss Kitty Cat
sometimes said. "It's nothing but an old syrup can. And I know for a
fact that Mrs. Bluebird looked at it last spring when she was hunting
for a home. And she said she wouldn't live in such a place. I heard her
tell her husband so."
</p><p>Now, the reason why Mr. and Mrs. Wren liked their house and the reason
why Miss Kitty Cat didn't were one and the same: Miss Kitty couldn't get
inside it. The mouth of the syrup can, which the Wren family used for a
door, was no bigger than a quarter of a dollar. It was entirely too
small for Miss Kitty Cat, though it was big enough to admit Rusty Wren
and his plump wife.
</p><p>Miss Kitty said everything she could to persuade the Wren family to
build themselves a nest in a crotch of the tree, like other birds.
</p><p>"I'm sure," she told them, "you'd like such a home much better than
this. There's no reason why you shouldn't be as fashionable as everybody
else. You wouldn't have to look for a place to build. There's room
enough right in this old cherry tree for a hundred happy homes if
anybody wanted to build them."
</p><p>"We like our house," Rusty Wren said.
</p><p>"I wouldn't move, even if he wanted to," Mrs. Wren declared.
</p><p>"Maybe you'd move because he <u>doesn't</u> want to," Miss Kitty Cat
suggested.
</p><p>But Mrs. Wren shook her head in a most decided way.
</p><p>"No!" she said. "I'm satisfied with my house. And our neighbors would be
far better off if they built as we do, inside a snug sort of box."
</p><p>"You'll never know what you're missing," Miss Kitty remarked, "if you
don't try an open nest sometime. Now, only yesterday I visited Jolly
Robin's family over in the orchard. And their youngsters certainly did
look beautiful. But you keep yours hidden inside that old syrup can
where nobody can see them. It's a shame that the public can't have a
chance to admire such fine nestlings as you must have in there."
</p><p>Miss Kitty Cat was sitting under the cherry tree. And she looked up and
smiled most agreeably at Mrs. Wren.
</p><p>Rusty Wren looked thoughtful.
</p><p>"There's something in what she says," he whispered to his wife. "It is
too bad not to let the neighbors admire the finest nestlings in Pleasant
Valley."
</p><p>"You know they say a cat may look at a king," Miss Kitty simpered.
"Well, a fortnight ago I went over to the pine woods and had a look at a
Ruby Crowned Kinglet's family. So it seems only fair that I shouldn't
be denied a look at your little wrenlets."
