<p>It is probable that he got the truth out of her, perhaps all
of it. That will remain a matter of doubt; Cora's evidence, if
she gave it, not being wholly trustworthy in cases touching herself.
But she felt no need of mentioning to any one that she had seen
her former lover that day. He had gone before the return of Enfield,
Mr. Trumble's assistant, who was a little later than usual, it
happened; and the extreme nervousness and preoccupation exhibited
by Cora in telling Enfield of his employer's new plans were attributed
by the cashier to the natural agitation of a lady about to wed
in a somewhat unusual (though sensible) manner.</p>

<p>It is the more probable that she told Ray the whole truth, because
he already knew something of Corliss's record abroad. On the dusty
desk in Ray's own office lay a letter, received that morning from
the American Consul at Naples, which was luminous upon that subject,
and upon the probabilities of financial returns for the investment
of a thousand dollars in the alleged oil-fields of Basilicata.</p>

<p>In addition, Cora had always found it very difficult to deceive
Vilas: he had an almost perfect understanding of a part of her
nature; she could never far mislead him about herself. With her,
he was intuitive and jumped to strange, inconsistent, true conclusions,
as women do. He had the art of reading her face, her gestures;
he had learned to listen to the tone of her voice more than to
what she said. In his cups, too, he had fitful but almost demoniac
inspirations for hidden truth.</p>

<p>And, remembering that Cora always "got even," it remains finally
to wonder if she might not have told him everything at the instance
of some shadowy impulse in that direction. There may have been
a luxury in whatever confession she made; perhaps it was not entirely
forced from her, and heaven knows how she may have coloured it.
There was an elusive, quiet satisfaction somewhere in her subsequent
expression; it lurked deep under the surface of the excitement
with which she talked to Enfield of her imminent marital abduction
of his small boss.</p>

<p>Her agitation, a relic of the unknown interview just past, simmered
down soon, leaving her in a becoming glow of colour, with slender
threads of moisture brilliantly outlining her eyelids. Mr. Enfield,
a young, well-favoured and recent importation from another town,
was deliciously impressed by the charm of the waiting lady. They
had not met; and Enfield wondered how Trumble had compassed such
an enormous success as this; and he wished that he had seen her
before matters had gone so far. He thought he might have had a
chance. She seemed pleasantly interested in him, even as it was&mdash;and
her eyes were wonderful, with their swift, warm, direct little
plunges into those of a chance comrade of the moment. She went
to the window, in her restlessness, looking down upon the swarming
street below, and the young man, standing beside her, felt her
shoulder most pleasantly though very lightly&mdash;in contact with
his own, as they leaned forward, the better to see some curiosity
of advertising that passed. She turned her face to his just then,
and told him that he must come to see her: the wedding journey
would be long, she said, but it would not be forever.</p>

<p>Trumble bounded in, shouting that everything was attended to,
except instructions to Enfield, whom he pounded wildly upon the
back. He began signing papers; a stenographer was called from
another room of his offices; and there was half an hour of rapid-fire.
Cora's bag came, and she gave the bearer the note for Laura; another
bag was brought for Wade; and both bags were carried down to the
automobile the bridegroom had left waiting in the street. Last,
came a splendid cluster of orchids for the bride to wear, and
then Wade, with his arm about her, swept her into the corridor,
and the stirred Enfield was left to his own beating heart, and
the fresh, radiant vision of this startling new acquaintance:
the sweet mystery of the look she had thrown back at him over
his employer's shoulder at the very last. "Do not forget <em>me</em>!"
it had seemed to say. "We shall come back&mdash;some day."</p>

<p>The closed car bore the pair to the little grim marriage-shop
quickly enough, though they were nearly run down by a furious
police patrol automobile, at a corner near the Richfield Hotel.
Their escape was by a very narrow margin of safety, and Cora closed
her eyes. Then she was cross, because she had been frightened,
and commanded Wade cavalierly to bid the driver be more careful.</p>

<p>Wade obeyed sympathetically. "Of course, though, it wasn't altogether
his fault," he said, settling back, his arm round his lady's waist.
"It's an outrage for the police to break their own rules that
way. I guess they don't need to be in a hurry any more than <em>we</em>
do!"</p>

<p>The Justice made short work of it.</p>

<p>As they stood so briefly before him, there swept across her vision
the memory of what she had always prophesied as her wedding:&mdash;a
crowded church, "The Light That Breathed O'er Eden" from an unseen
singer; then the warm air trembling to the Lohengrin march; all
heads turning; the procession down the aisle; herself appearing&mdash;climax
of everything&mdash;a delicious and brilliant figure: graceful, rosy,
shy, an imperial prize for the groom, who in these foreshadowings
had always been very indistinct. The picture had always failed
in outline there: the bridegroom's nearest approach to definition
had never been clearer than a composite photograph. The truth
is, Cora never in her life wished to be married.</p>

<p>But she was.</p>
