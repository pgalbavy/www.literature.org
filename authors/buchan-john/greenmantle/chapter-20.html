<p>This chapter is the tale that Peter told me—long after, sitting
beside a stove in the hotel at Bergen, where we were waiting for
our boat.</p>

<p>He climbed on the roof and shinned down the broken bricks of
the outer wall. The outbuilding we were lodged in abutted on a
road, and was outside the proper <em>enceinte</em> of the house.
At ordinary times I have no doubt there were sentries, but Sandy
and Hussin had probably managed to clear them off this end for
a little. Anyhow he saw nobody as he crossed the road and dived
into the snowy fields.</p>

<p>He knew very well that he must do the job in the twelve hours
of darkness ahead of him. The immediate front of a battle is a
bit too public for anyone to lie hidden in by day, especially
when two or three feet of snow make everything kenspeckle. Now
hurry in a job of this kind was abhorrent to Peter’s soul, for,
like all Boers, his tastes were for slowness and sureness, though
he could hustle fast enough when haste was needed. As he pushed
through the winter fields he reckoned up the things in his favour,
and found the only one the dirty weather. There was a high, gusty
wind, blowing scuds of snow but never coming to any great fall.
The frost had gone, and the lying snow was as soft as butter.
That was all to the good, he thought, for a clear, hard night
would have been the devil.</p>

<p>The first bit was through farmlands, which were seamed with little
snow-filled water-furrows. Now and then would come a house and
a patch of fruit trees, but there was nobody abroad. The roads
were crowded enough, but Peter had no use for roads. I can picture
him swinging along with his bent back, stopping every now and
then to sniff and listen, alert for the foreknowledge of danger.
When he chose he could cover country like an antelope.</p>

<p>Soon he struck a big road full of transport. It was the road
from Erzerum to the Palantuken pass, and he waited his chance
and crossed it. After that the ground grew rough with boulders
and patches of thorn-trees, splendid cover where he could move
fast without worrying. Then he was pulled up suddenly on the bank
of a river. The map had warned him of it, but not that it would
be so big.</p>

<p>It was a torrent swollen with melting snow and rains in the hills,
and it was running fifty yards wide. Peter thought he could have
swum it, but he was very averse to a drenching. "A wet man makes
too much noise," he said, and besides, there was the off-chance
that the current would be too much for him. So he moved up stream
to look for a bridge.</p>

<p>In ten minutes he found one, a new-made thing of trestles, broad
enough to take transport wagons. It was guarded, for he heard
the tramp of a sentry, and as he pulled himself up the bank he
observed a couple of long wooden huts, obviously some kind of
billets. These were on the near side of the stream, about a dozen
yards from the bridge. A door stood open and a light showed in
it, and from within came the sound of voices.... Peter had a sense
of hearing like a wild animal, and he could detect even from the
confused gabble that the voices were German.</p>

<p>As he lay and listened someone came over the bridge. It was an
officer, for the sentry saluted. The man disappeared in one of
the huts. Peter had struck the billets and repairing shop of a
squad of German sappers.</p>

<p>He was just going ruefully to retrace his steps and try to find
a good place to swim the stream when it struck him that the officer
who had passed him wore clothes very like his own. He, too, had
had a grey sweater and a Balaclava helmet, for even a German officer
ceases to be dressy on a mid-winter’s night in Anatolia. The idea
came to Peter to walk boldly across the bridge and trust to the
sentry not seeing the difference.</p>

<p>He slipped round a corner of the hut and marched down the road.
The sentry was now at the far end, which was lucky, for if the
worst came to the worst he could throttle him. Peter, mimicking
the stiff German walk, swung past him, his head down as if to
protect him from the wind.</p>

<p>The man saluted. He did more, for he offered conversation. The
officer must have been a genial soul.</p>

<p>"It’s a rough night, Captain," he said in German. "The wagons
are late. Pray God, Michael hasn’t got a shell in his lot. They’ve
begun putting over some big ones."</p>

<p>Peter grunted good night in German and strode on. He was just
leaving the road when he heard a great halloo behind him.</p>

<p>The real officer must have appeared on his heels, and the sentry’s
doubts had been stirred. A whistle was blown, and, looking back,
Peter saw lanterns waving in the gale. They were coming out to
look for the duplicate.</p>

<p>He stood still for a second, and noticed the lights spreading
out south of the road. He was just about to dive off it on the
north side when he was aware of a difficulty. On that side a steep
bank fell to a ditch, and the bank beyond bounded a big flood.
He could see the dull ruffle of the water under the wind.</p>

<p>On the road itself he would soon be caught; south of it the search
was beginning; and the ditch itself was no place to hide, for
he saw a lantern moving up it. Peter dropped into it all the same
and made a plan. The side below the road was a little undercut
and very steep. He resolved to plaster himself against it, for
he would be hidden from the road, and a searcher in the ditch
would not be likely to explore the unbroken sides. It was always
a maxim of Peter’s that the best hiding-place was the worst, the
least obvious to the minds of those who were looking for you.</p>

<p>He waited until the lights both in the road and the ditch came
nearer, and then he gripped the edge with his left hand, where
some stones gave him purchase, dug the toes of his boots into
the wet soil and stuck like a limpet. It needed some strength
to keep the position for long, but the muscles of his arms and
legs were like whipcord.</p>

<p>The searcher in the ditch soon got tired, for the place was very
wet, and joined his comrades on the road. They came along, running,
flashing the lanterns into the trench, and exploring all the immediate
countryside.</p>

<p>Then rose a noise of wheels and horses from the opposite direction.
Michael and the delayed wagons were approaching. They dashed up
at a great pace, driven wildly, and for one horrid second Peter
thought they were going to spill into the ditch at the very spot
where he was concealed. The wheels passed so close to the edge
that they almost grazed his fingers. Somebody shouted an order
and they pulled up a yard or two nearer the bridge. The others
came up and there was a consultation.</p>

<p>Michael swore he had passed no one on the road.</p>

<p>"That fool Hannus has seen a ghost," said the officer testily.
"It’s too cold for this child’s play."</p>

<p>Hannus, almost in tears, repeated his tale. "The man spoke to
me in good German," he cried.</p>

<p>"Ghost or no ghost he is safe enough up the road," said the officer.
"Kind God, that was a big one!" He stopped and stared at a shell-burst,
for the bombardment from the east was growing fiercer.</p>

<p>They stood discussing the fire for a minute and presently moved
off. Peter gave them two minutes’ law and then clambered back
to the highway and set off along it at a run. The noise of the
shelling and the wind, together with the thick darkness, made
it safe to hurry.</p>

<p>He left the road at the first chance and took to the broken country.
The ground was now rising towards a spur of the Palantuken, on
the far slope of which were the Turkish trenches. The night had
begun by being pretty nearly as black as pitch; even the smoke
from the shell explosions, which is often visible in darkness,
could not be seen. But as the wind blew the snow-clouds athwart
the sky patches of stars came out. Peter had a compass, but he
didn’t need to use it, for he had a kind of "feel" for landscape,
a special sense which is born in savages and can only be acquired
after long experience by the white man. I believe he could smell
where the north lay. He had settled roughly which part of the
line he would try, merely because of its nearness to the enemy.
But he might see reason to vary this, and as he moved he began
to think that the safest place was where the shelling was hottest.
He didn’t like the notion, but it sounded sense.</p>

<p>Suddenly he began to puzzle over queer things in the ground,
and, as he had never seen big guns before, it took him a moment
to fix them. Presently one went off at his elbow with a roar like
the Last Day. These were Austrian howitzers—nothing over eight-inch,
I fancy, but to Peter they looked like leviathans. Here, too,
he saw for the first time a big and quite recent shell-hole, for
the Russian guns were searching out the position. He was so interested
in it all that he poked his nose where he shouldn’t have been,
and dropped plump into the pit behind a gun-emplacement.</p>

<p>Gunners all the world over are the same—shy people, who hide
themselves in holes and hibernate and mortally dislike being detected.</p>

<p>A gruff voice cried "<em>Wer da</em>?" and a heavy hand seized
his neck.</p>

<p>Peter was ready with his story. He belonged to Michael’s wagon-team
and had been left behind. He wanted to be told the way to the
sappers’ camp. He was very apologetic, not to say obsequious.</p>

<p>"It is one of those Prussian swine from the Marta bridge," said
a gunner. "Land him a kick to teach him sense. Bear to your right,
mannikin, and you will find a road. And have a care when you get
there, for the Russkoes are registering on it."</p>

<p>Peter thanked them and bore off to the right. After that he kept
a wary eye on the howitzers, and was thankful when he got out
of their area on to the slopes up the hill. Here was the type
of country that was familiar to him, and he defied any Turk or
Boche to spot him among the scrub and boulders. He was getting
on very well, when once more, close to his ear, came a sound like
the crack of doom.</p>

<p>It was the field-guns now, and the sound of a field-gun close
at hand is bad for the nerves if you aren’t expecting it. Peter
thought he had been hit, and lay flat for a little to consider.
Then he found the right explanation, and crawled forward very
warily.</p>

<p>Presently he saw his first Russian shell. It dropped half a dozen
yards to his right, making a great hole in the snow and sending
up a mass of mixed earth, snow, and broken stones. Peter spat
out the dirt and felt very solemn. You must remember that never
in his life had he seen big shelling, and was now being landed
in the thick of a first-class show without any preparation. He
said he felt cold in his stomach, and very wishful to run away,
if there had been anywhere to run to. But he kept on to the crest
of the ridge, over which a big glow was broadening like sunrise.
He tripped once over a wire, which he took for some kind of snare,
and after that went very warily. By and by he got his face between
two boulders and looked over into the true battle-field.</p>

<p>He told me it was exactly what the predikant used to say that
Hell would be like. About fifty yards down the slope lay the Turkish
trenches—they were dark against the snow, and now and then a black
figure like a devil showed for an instant and disappeared. The
Turks clearly expected an infantry attack, for they were sending
up calcium rockets and Very flares. The Russians were battering
their line and spraying all the hinterland, not with shrapnel,
but with good, solid high-explosives. The place would be as bright
as day for a moment, all smothered in a scurry of smoke and snow
and debris, and then a black pall would fall on it, when only
the thunder of the guns told of the battle.</p>

<p>Peter felt very sick. He had not believed there could be so much
noise in the world, and the drums of his ears were splitting.
Now, for a man to whom courage is habitual, the taste of fear—naked,
utter fear—is a horrible thing. It seems to wash away all his
manhood. Peter lay on the crest, watching the shells burst, and
confident that any moment he might be a shattered remnant. He
lay and reasoned with himself, calling himself every name he could
think of, but conscious that nothing would get rid of that lump
of ice below his heart.</p>

<p>Then he could stand it no longer. He got up and ran for his life.</p>

<p>But he ran forward.</p>

<p>It was the craziest performance. He went hell-for-leather over
a piece of ground which was being watered with <em>H.E., </em>but
by the mercy of heaven nothing hit him. He took some fearsome
tosses in shell-holes, but partly erect and partly on all fours
he did the fifty yards and tumbled into a Turkish trench right
on top of a dead man.</p>

<p>The contact with that body brought him to his senses. That men
could die at all seemed a comforting, homely thing after that
unnatural pandemonium. The next moment a crump took the parapet
of the trench some yards to his left, and he was half buried in
an avalanche.</p>

<p>He crawled out of that, pretty badly cut about the head. He was
quite cool now and thinking hard about his next step. There were
men all around him, sullen dark faces as he saw them when the
flares went up. They were manning the parapets and waiting tensely
for something else than the shelling. They paid no attention to
him, for I fancy in that trench units were pretty well mixed up,
and under a bad bombardment no one bothers about his neighbour.
He found himself free to move as he pleased. The ground of the
trench was littered with empty cartridge-cases, and there were
many dead bodies.</p>

<p>The last shell, as I have said, had played havoc with the parapet.
In the next spell of darkness Peter crawled through the gap and
twisted among some snowy hillocks. He was no longer afraid of
shells, any more than he was afraid of a veld thunderstorm. But
he was wondering very hard how he should ever get to the Russians.
The Turks were behind him now, but there was the biggest danger
in front.</p>

<p>Then the artillery ceased. It was so sudden that he thought he
had gone deaf, and could hardly realize the blessed relief of
it. The wind, too, seemed to have fallen, or perhaps he was sheltered
by the lee of the hill. There were a lot of dead here also, and
that he couldn’t understand, for they were new dead. Had the Turks
attacked and been driven back? When he had gone about thirty yards
he stopped to take his bearings. On the right were the ruins of
a large building set on fire by the guns. There was a blur of
woods and the debris of walls round it. Away to the left another
hill ran out farther to the east, and the place he was in seemed
to be a kind of cup between the spurs. Just before him was a little
ruined building, with the sky seen through its rafters, for the
smouldering ruin on the right gave a certain light. He wondered
if the Russian firing-line lay there.</p>

<p>Just then he heard voices—smothered voices—not a yard away and
apparently below the ground. He instantly jumped to what this
must mean. It was a Turkish trench—a communication trench. Peter
didn’t know much about modern warfare, but he had read in the
papers, or heard from me, enough to make him draw the right moral.
The fresh dead pointed to the same conclusion. What he had got
through were the Turkish support trenches, not their firing-line.
That was still before him.</p>

<p>He didn’t despair, for the rebound from panic had made him extra
courageous. He crawled forward, an inch at a time, taking no sort
of risk, and presently found himself looking at the parados of
a trench. Then he lay quiet to think out the next step.</p>

<p>The shelling had stopped, and there was that queer kind of peace
which falls sometimes on two armies not a quarter of a mile distant.
Peter said he could hear nothing but the far-off sighing of the
wind. There seemed to be no movement of any kind in the trench
before him, which ran through the ruined building. The light of
the burning was dying, and he could just make out the mound of
earth a yard in front. He began to feel hungry, and got out his
packet of food and had a swig at the brandy flask. That comforted
him, and he felt a master of his fate again. But the next step
was not so easy. He must find out what lay behind that mound of
earth.</p>

<p>Suddenly a curious sound fell on his ears. It was so faint that
at first he doubted the evidence of his senses. Then as the wind
fell it came louder. It was exactly like some hollow piece of
metal being struck by a stick, musical and oddly resonant.</p>

<p>He concluded it was the wind blowing a branch of a tree against
an old boiler in the ruin before him. The trouble was that there
was scarcely enough wind now for that in this sheltered cup.</p>

<p>But as he listened he caught the note again. It was a bell, a
fallen bell, and the place before him must have been a chapel.
He remembered that an Armenian monastery had been marked on the
big map, and he guessed it was the burned building on his right.</p>

<p>The thought of a chapel and a bell gave him the notion of some
human agency. And then suddenly the notion was confirmed. The
sound was regular and concerted—dot, dash, dot—dash, dot, dot.
The branch of a tree and the wind may play strange pranks, but
they do not produce the longs and shorts of the Morse Code.</p>

<p>This was where Peter’s intelligence work in the Boer War helped
him. He knew the Morse, he could read it, but he could make nothing
of the signalling. It was either in some special code or in a
strange language.</p>

<p>He lay still and did some calm thinking. There was a man in front
of him, a Turkish soldier, who was in the enemy’s pay. Therefore
he could fraternize with him, for they were on the same side.
But how was he to approach him without getting shot in the process?
Again, how could a man send signals to the enemy from a firing-line
without being detected? Peter found an answer in the strange configuration
of the ground. He had not heard a sound until he was a few yards
from the place, and they would be inaudible to men in the reserve
trenches and even in the communication trenches. If somebody moving
up the latter caught the noise, it would be easy to explain it
naturally. But the wind blowing down the cup would carry it far
in the enemy’s direction.</p>

<p>There remained the risk of being heard by those parallel with
the bell in the firing trenches. Peter concluded that that trench
must be very thinly held, probably only by a few observers, and
the nearest might be a dozen yards off. He had read about that
being the French fashion under a big bombardment.</p>

<p>The next thing was to find out how to make himself known to this
ally. He decided that the only way was to surprise him. He might
get shot, but he trusted to his strength and agility against a
man who was almost certainly wearied. When he had got him safe,
explanations might follow.</p>

<p>Peter was now enjoying himself hugely. If only those infernal
guns kept silent he would play out the game in the sober, decorous
way he loved. So very delicately he began to wriggle forward to
where the sound was.</p>

<p>The night was now as black as ink around him, and very quiet,
too, except for soughings of the dying gale. The snow had drifted
a little in the lee of the ruined walls, and Peter’s progress
was naturally very slow. He could not afford to dislodge one ounce
of snow. Still the tinkling went on, now in greater volume. Peter
was in terror lest it should cease before he got his man.</p>

<p>Presently his hand clutched at empty space. He was on the lip
of the front trench. The sound was now a yard to his right, and
with infinite care he shifted his position. Now the bell was just
below him, and he felt the big rafter of the woodwork from which
it had fallen. He felt something else—a stretch of wire fixed
in the ground with the far end hanging in the void. That would
be the spy’s explanation if anyone heard the sound and came seeking
the cause.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the darkness before him and below was the man, not
a yard off. Peter remained very still, studying the situation.
He could not see, but he could feel the presence, and he was trying
to decide the relative position of the man and bell and their
exact distance from him. The thing was not so easy as it looked,
for if he jumped for where he believed the figure was, he might
miss it and get a bullet in the stomach. A man who played so risky
a game was probably handy with his firearms. Besides, if he should
hit the bell, he would make a hideous row and alarm the whole
front.</p>

<p>Fate suddenly gave him the right chance. The unseen figure stood
up and moved a step, till his back was against the parados. He
actually brushed against Peter’s elbow, who held his breath.</p>

<p>There is a catch that the Kaffirs have which would need several
diagrams to explain. It is partly a neck hold, and partly a paralysing
backward twist of the right arm, but if it is practised on a man
from behind, it locks him as sure as if he were handcuffed. Peter
slowly got his body raised and his knees drawn under him, and
reached for his prey.</p>

<p>He got him. A head was pulled backward over the edge of the trench,
and he felt in the air the motion of the left arm pawing feebly
but unable to reach behind.</p>

<p>"Be still," whispered Peter in German; "I mean you no harm. We
are friends of the same purpose. Do you speak German?"</p>

<p>"<em>Nein</em>," said a muffled voice.</p>

<p>"English?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the voice.</p>

<p>"Thank God," said Peter. "Then we can understand each other.
I’ve watched your notion of signalling, and a very good one it
is. I’ve got to get through to the Russian lines somehow before
morning, and I want you to help me. I’m English—a kind of English,
so we’re on the same side. If I let go your neck, will you be
good and talk reasonably?"</p>

<p>The voice assented. Peter let go, and in the same instant slipped
to the side. The man wheeled round and flung out an arm but gripped
vacancy.</p>

<p>"Steady, friend," said Peter; "you mustn’t play tricks with me
or I’ll be angry."</p>

<p>"Who are you? Who sent you?" asked the puzzled voice.</p>

<p>Peter had a happy thought. "The Companions of the Rosy Hours,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Then are we friends indeed," said the voice. "Come out of the
darkness, friend, and I will do you no harm. I am a good Turk,
and I fought beside the English in Kordofan and learned their
tongue. I live only to see the ruin of Enver, who has beggared
my family and slain my twin brother. Therefore I serve the <em>Muscov
ghiaours</em>."</p>

<p>"I don’t know what the Musky Jaws are, but if you mean the Russians
I’m with you. I’ve got news for them which will make Enver green.
The question is, how I’m to get to them, and that is where you
shall help me, my friend."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"By playing that little tune of yours again. Tell them to expect
within the next half-hour a deserter with an important message.
Tell them, for God’s sake, not to fire at anybody till they’ve
made certain it isn’t me."</p>

<p>The man took the blunt end of his bayonet and squatted beside
the bell. The first stroke brought out a clear, searching note
which floated down the valley. He struck three notes at slow intervals.
For all the world, Peter said, he was like a telegraph operator
calling up a station.</p>

<p>"Send the message in English," said Peter.</p>

<p>"They may not understand it," said the man.</p>

<p>"Then send it any way you like. I trust you, for we are brothers."</p>

<p>After ten minutes the man ceased and listened. From far away
came the sound of a trench-gong, the kind of thing they used on
the Western Front to give the gas-alarm.</p>

<p>"They say they will be ready," he said. "I cannot take down messages
in the darkness, but they have given me the signal which means
‘Consent’."</p>

<p>"Come, that is pretty good," said Peter. "And now I must be moving.
You take a hint from me. When you hear big firing up to the north
get ready to beat a quick retreat, for it will be all up with
that city of yours. And tell your folk, too, that they’re making
a bad mistake letting those fool Germans rule their land. Let
them hang Enver and his little friends, and we’ll be happy once
more."</p>

<p>"May Satan receive his soul!" said the Turk. "There is wire before
us, but I will show you a way through. The guns this evening made
many rents in it. But haste, for a working party may be here presently
to repair it. Remember there is much wire before the other lines."</p>

<p>Peter, with certain directions, found it pretty easy to make
his way through the entanglement. There was one bit which scraped
a hole in his back, but very soon he had come to the last posts
and found himself in open country. The place, he said, was a graveyard
of the unburied dead that smelt horribly as he crawled among them.
He had no inducements to delay, for he thought he could hear behind
him the movement of the Turkish working party, and was in terror
that a flare might reveal him and a volley accompany his retreat.</p>

<p>From one shell-hole to another he wormed his way, till he struck
an old ruinous communication trench which led in the right direction.
The Turks must have been forced back in the past week, and the
Russians were now in the evacuated trenches. The thing was half
full of water, but it gave Peter a feeling of safety, for it enabled
him to get his head below the level of the ground. Then it came
to an end and he found before him a forest of wire.</p>

<p>The Turk in his signal had mentioned half an hour, but Peter
thought it was nearer two hours before he got through that noxious
entanglement. Shelling had made little difference to it. The uprights
were all there, and the barbed strands seemed to touch the ground.
Remember, he had no wire-cutter; nothing but his bare hands. Once
again fear got hold of him. He felt caught in a net, with monstrous
vultures waiting to pounce on him from above. At any moment a
flare might go up and a dozen rifles find their mark. He had altogether
forgotten about the message which had been sent, for no message
could dissuade the ever-present death he felt around him. It was,
he said, like following an old lion into bush when there was but
one narrow way in, and no road out.</p>

<p>The guns began again—the Turkish guns from behind the ridge—and
a shell tore up the wire a short way before him. Under cover of
the burst he made good a few yards, leaving large portions of
his clothing in the strands. Then, quite suddenly, when hope had
almost died in his heart, he felt the ground rise steeply. He
lay very still, a star-rocket from the Turkish side lit up the
place, and there in front was a rampart with the points of bayonets
showing beyond it. It was the Russian hour for stand-to.</p>

<p>He raised his cramped limbs from the ground and shouted "Friend!
English!"</p>

<p>A face looked down at him, and then the darkness again descended.</p>

<p>"Friend," he said hoarsely. "English."</p>

<p>He heard speech behind the parapet. An electric torch was flashed
on him for a second. A voice spoke, a friendly voice, and the
sound of it seemed to be telling him to come over.</p>

<p>He was now standing up, and as he got his hands on the parapet
he seemed to feel bayonets very near him. But the voice that spoke
was kindly, so with a heave he scrambled over and flopped into
the trench. Once more the electric torch was flashed, and revealed
to the eyes of the onlookers an indescribably dirty, lean, middle-aged
man with a bloody head, and scarcely a rag of shirt on his back.
The said man, seeing friendly faces around him, grinned cheerfully.</p>

<p>"That was a rough trek, friends," he said; "I want to see your
general pretty quick, for I’ve got a present for him."</p>

<p>He was taken to an officer in a dug-out, who addressed him in
French, which he did not understand. But the sight of Stumm’s
plan worked wonders. After that he was fairly bundled down communication
trenches and then over swampy fields to a farm among trees. There
he found staff officers, who looked at him and looked at his map,
and then put him on a horse and hurried him eastwards. At last
he came to a big ruined house, and was taken into a room which
seemed to be full of maps and generals.</p>

<p>The conclusion must be told in Peter’s words.</p>

<p>"There was a big man sitting at a table drinking coffee, and
when I saw him my heart jumped out of my skin. For it was the
man I hunted with on the Pungwe in ’98—him whom the Kaffirs called
‘Buck’s Horn’, because of his long curled moustaches. He was a
prince even then, and now he is a very great general. When I saw
him, I ran forward and gripped his hand and cried, ‘<em>Hoe gat
het, Mynheer</em>?’ and he knew me and shouted in Dutch, ‘Damn,
if it isn’t old Peter Pienaar!’ Then he gave me coffee and ham
and good bread, and he looked at my map.</p>

<p>"‘What is this?’ he cried, growing red in the face.</p>

<p>"‘It is the staff-map of one Stumm, a German <em>skellum</em>
who commands in yon city,’ I said.</p>

<p>"He looked at it close and read the markings, and then he read
the other paper which you gave me, Dick. And then he flung up
his arms and laughed. He took a loaf and tossed it into the air
so that it fell on the head of another general. He spoke to them
in their own tongue, and they, too, laughed, and one or two ran
out as if on some errand. I have never seen such merrymaking.
They were clever men, and knew the worth of what you gave me.</p>

<p>"Then he got to his feet and hugged me, all dirty as I was, and
kissed me on both cheeks.</p>
