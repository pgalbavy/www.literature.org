<p><em>THE </em>next day, at lunch, she asked her father what it
meant, though she did not mention Dan; and she brought out a crackling
chuckle from that old bit of hickory, now brittle and almost sapless,
but still serviceable.</p>

<p>"Means a bank wants its money back; that’s all," he said. "There’s
plenty of reasons why a bank wants money—same as anybody else."</p>

<p>"But suppose I’d borrowed of a bank and was a good customer,
and the bank knew I had plenty of property to cover the loan,
would the First National, for instance, ever worry me to pay it,
if they knew I only needed a little time to get all I owed it?"</p>

<p>"Not unless we thought you mightn’t be as able to pay us as well
later on as when we ask for it," the old man answered. "You’d
be all right as long as the First stood by you. The First’ll protect
a customer long as anybody; and the others all follow our lead.
What in time’s the matter with you? You plannin’ to borrow money?
Geemunently! I should think you’d be able to put up with what
you get out o’ me!"</p>

<p>His voice cracked into falsetto, as it often did nowadays; but
the vehemence that cracked it was not intended to be serious;
he was in a jocular mood; and the conversation reassured her,
for he was one of the directors of the "First"; and if Dan were
really in difficulties and the bank meant to increase them, she
thought her father would have seized upon the occasion to speak
of it triumphantly. Indeed, he had once angrily instructed her
to wait for such an occasion. "You just wait till the time comes!"
he had said. "You sit there crowin’ over me because I used to
prophesy Dan Oliphant was never goin’ to amount to anything, and
you claim all this noise and gas proves he <em>has</em>! You just
wait till the day comes when I get the chance to crow over <em>you</em>,
miss! You’ll hear me!"</p>

<p>She was convinced that he wouldn’t have missed the chance to
crow. Nevertheless a little of her uneasiness remained, and was
still with her, two weeks later, when she went with Harlan to
the concert of the new symphony orchestra, on an evening so drenched
with rain that she inquired with some anxiety if his car was amphibious.</p>

<p>"If it can’t swim I’m afraid we won’t get there," she said, as
they set off upon the splashing avenue. "Judging by the windows,
we aren’t in an automobile, but in one of those tanks that take
pictures of ocean life for the movies. I’m not sure it’s a tank
though; the old avenue has turned into a river, and perhaps we’re
in a side-wheel steamboat. I’m afraid this’ll be bad for your
attendance. You’ll have a big deficit to make up in reward for
your struggle to make us an artistic people."</p>

<p>There was to be no deficit, however, she discovered, as they
went to their seats in the theatre Harlan’s committee had taken
for the concert;—interest in the new organization and in the coming
of the renowned Venable had been stronger than the fear of a wetting.
The place was being rapidly filled, and, glancing about her, Martha
saw "almost everybody and a great many others," she said.</p>

<p>Not far away from where she and Harlan sat, Lena was in a box
with George McMillan. The other seats in the box were vacant;
and Lena, sitting close to the velvet rail, and wearing as a contrast
to her own whiteness a Parisian interpretation of Spanish passion,
in black jet and jet-black, was the most conspicuous figure in
the theatre. She leaned back in her chair, her brilliant eyes
upon the stage, though there was nothing there except a piano
and a small forest of music stands; and Martha thought she looked
excited—music was evidently a lively stimulant for her. Her brother,
not quite so much within the public view, and possibly wishing
his sister were less vividly offered to that view, appeared to
the observing Martha as somewhat depressed and nervous. There
was no conversation between the brother and sister, though he
glanced at Lena from time to time, from the side of his eye.</p>

<p>Martha wondered where Dan was. He would prefer a concert by Sousa’s
Band to the French and Russian programme set for this evening,
she knew; but the opening of "the Symphony" was in its way a civic
occasion; one for which the credit was in some part due to his
brother; and she had expected him to be there. "Isn’t Dan coming?"
she asked Harlan.</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"Do you think he’s worried about business lately, Harlan?"</p>

<p>"No, I don’t think he ever worries about anything."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you’re wrong!" she said quickly. "You don’t know him;
a man can’t sacrifice everything to just one object in life, as
he has, all these years, and not worry about it. I know your mother
worries about <em>him</em>. She says he never takes any care of
himself, and it’s beginning to tell on him. But I mean are there
any—any rumours around town that he’s in some sort of business
difficulty, or anything like that?"</p>

<p>"No; I think not. At least I haven’t heard of anything like that
being more prevalent with him than usual. He’s always up and down,
either up to his neck or riding on the crest—that’s his way, and
I don’t believe he’d enjoy himself otherwise. The only thing he
could talk about when I saw him yesterday at home was his new
house. It’s finished at last; and they’re going to move into it.
Mother’s sold our old place, you know, and the wrecking will begin
next week. Pleasant for you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I’m trying to get father to go, too," she said. "He’s terribly
obstinate, but with the house on the other side of us rebuilt
into an apartment, and now your mother’s to be torn down, he’ll
have to give in. We’ll have to move out to northern Ornaby like
everybody else. You’ll have to come, too, Harlan."</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said. "I’ve been waiting a good many years for
that invitation. May I make an appointment with your father for
to-morrow morning?"</p>

<p>She laughed, blushed, and touched his coat sleeve with her folded
fan of black feathers. "Hush! People will hear you!"</p>

<p>"You fear it may be suspected that I’m still serious in my intentions?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" she said again. "I mean we’re about to hear some serious
music, and it’s no time for nonsense."</p>

<p>Harlan was obedient; he said no more, but brightened as he listened
to the serious music;—her tone had been kind and he hoped that
he was not mistaken in thinking he detected something a little
self-conscious in it. He was no eager lover now; his bachelorhood
was pleasant to him; and he could be content with it; but as Martha
leaned forward to listen he looked sidelong at her and felt that
he had been right and wise to wish for no other woman. They had
been companions for so long, and understood each other so well,
marriage would be no disturbing change for either of them. He
was assured of happiness in it, if he could persuade her, and
something in the way she had just spoken to him made him almost
sure that he was about to persuade her at last.</p>

<p>After the first suite by the orchestra the great Venable appeared,
making his way among the seated musicians and coming forward with
an air of affability operatic in its sweeping expressiveness—a
pale, handsome, black-haired man of grand dimensions. He needed
no costume other than his black clothes and shapely ampleness
of white front to make him seem, not an actual man, but a figure
from romantic drama, a dweller in enchanted palaces and the master
of heroic passions.</p>

<p>"I’ve always wanted to see one of those splendid, big, statuesque
opera or concert people at home," Martha whispered to her escort.
"I’ve never been near them except when they moved on the grand
scale, like this. It would be an experience to see a man like
that eat an egg—I can’t imagine it at all. Do you suppose he could?"</p>

<p>A moment later, when he began to sing, she was sure he couldn’t;
and as the magnificent instrument in his throat continued in operation,
he carried her to such thrilling grandeurs of feeling that she
could not even imagine herself eating an egg, or eating anything,
or ever again doing anything commonplace—for while he sang she,
too, dwelt in enchanted palaces, moved on the grand scale, and
knew only heroic emotions.</p>

<p>But when he had finished the encore he was generous enough to
add to this part of his programme, and had left the stage, she
underwent a reaction not unusual after such stimulations. "It’s
a great voice and he’s a great artist, if I’m equal to knowing
either," she said. "But there’s something about that man—I don’t
know what, except it all seems to end in being about himself.
It’s so personal, somehow. I’m positive he made every woman in
the whole audience wish that he were singing just for her alone.
I don’t think music ought to be like that, unless perhaps sometimes
when it’s a love-song, and those things he sang weren’t supposed
to——" She broke off suddenly, as her glance wandered. "There’s
Dan. He got here, after all."</p>

<p>Dan was coming down the outer aisle to the box where Lena sat;
and with him was the younger Sam Kohn, the two having just entered
the theatre after the business conference that had detained them.
Sam was talking hurriedly and earnestly in husky whispers, which
he emphasized with many quick gestures; but he left his tall companion
at the curtains of the latter’s box.</p>

<p>"See you right after the show," he said, and then went slowly
to the series of boxes occupied by his father and brother and
their families, while Dan, who looked sallow and tired, Martha
thought, stared after him for a moment, then moved forward and
seated himself beside George McMillan. Lena gave her husband the
greeting of a slightly lifted eyebrow, shown to him in profile;
but McMillan leaned toward him and whispered an anxious question.</p>

<p>"It’s all right," Dan said. "Sam Kohn’s got his father’s promise
to hold out against ’em. They want every inch of Ornaby I’ve got
left—that’s what they’ve really been after a long time. I’d like
to see anybody get Ornaby away from me! They want the Four, too,
and they think they’ve got both; but they won’t get either. The
Kohns’ll play it through on my——"</p>

<p>But Lena stopped this inappropriate talk of mere business. She
made a slight gesture with her lovely little bare arm, her fingers
flashing impatient sparks; and Dan was silent. He remained so
throughout the rest of the concert, listening with an expression
not unamiable, though at times his big face, lately grown flaccid
and heavier, fell into the shapings that indicate drowsiness;
and once or twice his glance was vaguely troubled, happening to
rest upon the white contours of his wife’s shoulders;—her glittering
black scarf had fallen as she leaned forward when the godlike
baritone came out again.</p>

<p>"That fellow looks kind of soft-soapy, but he’s got a crackin’
good voice," was Dan’s placid comment, at the conclusion of the
last encore of the final number. Venable was withdrawing from
the stage, and most of the audience were getting on their wraps;
but an admiring and avaricious gallery demanded more of the charmer,
and clapped on. He stopped, shook his head, smilingly; then made
his last bow profoundly and obliquely, with a shift of his large
eyes in the same direction. "Not bowin’ to <em>us</em>, is he?"
Dan inquired, surprised. "I don’t know him."</p>

<p>"I do," Lena said, "I told you the other day I used to know him.
I’m going around to speak to him."</p>

<p>"I can’t wait, I’m afraid. Sam Kohn’s lookin’ for me in the lobby
now, and he and I got to have a talk with his father. You take
the car, Lena—I’ll leave it in front for you, and I’ll get Sam
to drive me home from old man Kohn’s. I’ll have to hurry."</p>

<p>McMillan was looking at his sister darkly and steadily. "I’ll
see to Lena," he said. "I’ll go with her wherever she wants to
go, and then I’ll take her home."</p>

<p>Lena laughed airily. "Why, no; it isn’t necessary. You’d better
go with Dan."</p>

<p>"No; I believe I’d better go with you, Lena."</p>

<p>"Can’t wait for you to settle it," Dan said. "It’s pretty important
I don’t miss Sam. I may be out fairly late, Lena. Good-night."
And, leaving the brother and sister confronting each other, before
they moved toward the stage door behind the boxes, he hurried
out to the lobby, where Sam Kohn seized his arm.</p>

<p>"I’ll take you over to papa’s in my car, Dan," he said. "I been
talkin’ some more to the old man durin’ the show. He’ll stick,
all right, as a favour to me, because I put it to him pretty stiff
that you’re my old friend, and what you’ve done for this town
has made money for Kohn &amp; Sons, and’s bound to make more in
the future, besides; and I told him anyhow, by golly, he just
had to! Well, he says he’ll stick, and he’ll do it, Dan; but he
ain’t none too sure he can carry them old shellbacks with him.
He ain’t never been any pessimist about anything, Dan, but he
thinks they see a chance to clean up if they call you. He’s afraid
he can’t stop ’em from doin’ it, Dan."</p>

<p>Dan frowned angrily. "Well—let ’em call! They can’t break me!
I’ll <em>make</em> it, all right, Sam—I’ve been through these
things before."</p>

<p>Sam’s voice had shown some emotion, but now it became tremulous
with sympathy and with anger. "That bunch of old shellbacks, they
haven’t got sense enough to see what a man like you means to their
own business in the long run. They haven’t got any what you call
vision, as it were. They belong to the old generation, the bunch
of old back numbers! Honest, they make me sick as a cat, Dan."</p>

<p>He was still thus abusing the shellbacks when he and his friend
passed out of the theatre, and were almost swept from their feet
by squalls of chilling rain before they could get into his car.
He did all the talking, an unusual thing for Dan to allow a companion
to do. Always before, when misfortune had threatened, he had been
jauntily voluble.</p>

<p>He did not come home until one o’clock, but there was a light
in the library, and, going in, he found his mother reading "In
Memoriam." She had begun to stoop after her husband’s death, and
her hair had lost its last touch of gray; it was all white now,
so that even to the glamouring eyes of her son she had come to
be a little, fragile old lady; but her good will to all the world
still looked forth through the thick glass of her spectacles.</p>

<p>"Why, mother! You oughtn’t to be up this late!"</p>

<p>"I just got to reading——" she explained. "I like to read on a
rainy night. Did you lock the front door?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Isn’t Lena in?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Mr. McMillan brought her home an hour ago. Yes; <em>she’s</em>
in."</p>

<p>Dan laughed, noting her emphasis. "‘<em>She</em> is?’" he repeated.
"Well, then we’re <em>all</em> in. Who else is left to come in?"
He went to her and patted her shoulder. "I believe you were sitting
up for me. Don’t you know better?"</p>

<p>"I might be anxious about you, such a bad night, Dan," she said.
"I don’t like to pester you, but you ought to take some regular
exercise. You never <em>have</em> taken any; and you eat your
meals just anytime you happen to get a minute or two. I do think
you’ve been looking pretty run-down lately; but I wasn’t sitting
up for you—not exactly, that is. I mean I was really sitting up
for somebody else."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>She smiled apologetically. "Of course I know young people are
different nowadays, and it isn’t a grandmother’s place to interfere;
but I am afraid it was a mistake, your getting Henry that car."</p>

<p>"You don’t mean to tell me he’s not in the house?"</p>

<p>"I’m afraid so. After the rest of you had gone he said he believed
he’d go for a drive in his car. I said he mustn’t think of it
on such a night, but he laughed, and I couldn’t get him to pay
any attention. I was hoping to hear him come in before you did.
Perhaps you’d better——"</p>

<p>"Yes," Dan said, as he strode into the hall. "I think I had." </p>
