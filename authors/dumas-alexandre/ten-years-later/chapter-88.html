<P>Nothing further interrupted the journey. Under a pretext
that was little remarked, M. de Wardes went forward in
advance of the others. He took Manicamp with him, for his
equable and dreamy disposition acted as a counterpoise to
his own. It is a subject of remark, that quarrelsome and
restless characters invariably seek the companionship of
gentle, timorous dispositions, as if the former sought, in
the contrast, a repose for their own ill-humor, and the
latter a protection for their weakness. Buckingham and
Bragelonne admitting De Guiche into their friendship, in
concert with him, sang the praises of the princess during
the whole of the journey. Bragelonne had, however, insisted
that their three voices should be in concert, instead of
singing in solo parts, as De Guiche and his rival seemed to
have acquired a dangerous habit of investigation. This style
of harmony pleased the queen-mother exceedingly, but it was
not perhaps so agreeable to the young princess, who was an
incarnation of coquetry, and who, without any fear as far as
her own voice was concerned, sought opportunities of so
perilously distinguishing herself. She possessed one of
those fearless and incautious dispositions that find
gratification in an excess of sensitiveness of feeling, and
for whom, also, danger has a certain fascination. And so her
glances, her smiles, her toilette, an inexhaustible armory
of weapons of offense. were showered on the three young men
with overwhelming force; and, from her well-stored arsenal
issued glances, kindly recognitions, and a thousand other
little charming attentions which were intended to strike at
long range the gentlemen who formed the escort, the
townspeople, the officers of the different cities she passed
through, pages, populace, and servants; it was wholesale
slaughter, a general devastation. By the time Madame arrived
at Paris, she had reduced to slavery about a hundred
thousand lovers: and brought in her train to Paris half a
dozen men who were almost mad about her, and two who were,
indeed, literally out of their minds. Raoul was the only
person who divined the power of this woman's attraction, and
as his heart was already engaged, he arrived in the capital
full of indifference and distrust. Occasionally during the
journey he conversed with the queen of England respecting
the power of fascination which Madame possessed, and the
mother, whom so many misfortunes and deceptions had taught
experience, replied: &quot;Henrietta was sure to be illustrious
in one way or another, whether born in a palace or born in
obscurity; for she is a woman of great imagination,
capricious and self-willed.&quot; De Wardes and Manicamp, in
their self-assumed character of courtiers, had announced the
princess's arrival. The procession was met at Nanterre by a
brilliant escort of cavaliers and carriages. It was Monsieur
himself, followed by the Chevalier de Lorraine and by his
favorites, the latter being themselves followed by a portion
of the king's military household, who had arrived to meet
his affianced bride. At St. Germain, the princess and her
mother had changed their heavy traveling carriage, somewhat
impaired by the journey, for a light, richly decorated
chariot drawn by six horses with white and gold harness.
Seated in this open carriage, as though upon a throne, and
beneath a parasol of embroidered silk, fringed with
feathers, sat the young and lovely princess, on whose
beaming face were reflected the softened rose-tints which
suited her delicate skin to perfection. Monsieur, on
reaching the carriage, was struck by her beauty; he showed
his admiration in so marked a manner that the Chevalier de
Lorraine shrugged his shoulders as he listened to his
compliments, while Buckingham and De Guiche were almost
heart-broken. After the usual courtesies had been rendered,
and the ceremony completed, the procession slowly resumed
the road to Paris. The presentations had been carelessly
made, and Buckingham, with the rest of the English
gentlemen, had been introduced to Monsieur, from whom they
had received but very indifferent attention. But, during
their progress, as he observed that the duke devoted himself
with his accustomed earnestness to the carriage-door, he
asked the Chevalier de Lorraine, his inseparable companion,
&quot;Who is that cavalier?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He was presented to your highness a short while ago; it is
the handsome Duke of Buckingham.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, yes, I remember.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Madame's knight,&quot; added the favorite, with an inflection of
the voice which envious minds can alone give to the simplest
phrases.</P>
<P>&quot;What do you say?&quot; replied the prince.</P>
<P>&quot;I said `Madame's knight.'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Has she a recognized knight, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;One would think you can judge of that for yourself; look,
only, how they are laughing and flirting. All three of
them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you mean by all three?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you not see that De Guiche is one of the party?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I see. But what does that prove?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That Madame has two admirers instead of one.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thou poison the simplest thing!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I poison nothing. Ah! your royal highness's mind is
perverted. The honors of the kingdom of France are being
paid to your wife and you are not satisfied.&quot;</P>
<P>The Duke of Orleans dreaded the satirical humor of the
Chevalier de Lorraine whenever it reached a certain degree
of bitterness, and he changed the conversation abruptly.
&quot;The princess is pretty,&quot; said he, very negligently, as if
he were speaking of a stranger.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the chevalier, in the same tone.</P>
<P>&quot;You say `yes' like a `no.' She has very beautiful black
eyes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, but small.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is so, but they are brilliant. She is tall, and of a
good figure.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I fancy she stoops a little, my lord?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do not deny it. She has a noble appearance.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, but her face is thin.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I thought her teeth beautiful.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They can easily be seen, for her mouth is large enough.
Decidedly, I was wrong, my lord; you are certainly handsomer
than your wife.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But do you think me as handsome as Buckingham?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly, and he thinks so, too; for look, my lord, he is
redoubling his attentions to Madame to prevent your effacing
the impression he has made.&quot;</P>
<P>Monsieur made a movement of impatience, but as he noticed a
smile of triumph pass across the chevalier's lips, he drew
up his horse to a foot-pace. &quot;Why,&quot; said he, &quot;should I
occupy myself any longer about my cousin? Do I not already
know her? Were we not brought up together? Did I not see her
at the Louvre when she was quite a child?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A great change has taken place in her since then, prince.
At the period you allude to, she was somewhat less
brilliant, and scarcely so proud, either. One evening,
particularly, you may remember, my lord, the king refused to
dance with her, because he thought her plain and badly
dressed!&quot;</P>
<P>These words made the Duke of Orleans frown. It was by no
means flattering for him to marry a princess of whom, when
young, the king had not thought much. He would probably have
retorted, but at this moment De Guiche quitted the carriage
to join the prince. He had remarked the prince and the
chevalier together, and full of anxious attention he seemed
to try and guess the nature of the remarks which they had
just exchanged. The chevalier, whether he had some
treacherous object in view, or from imprudence, did not take
the trouble to dissimulate. &quot;Count,&quot; he said, &quot;you're a man
of excellent taste.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you for the compliment,&quot; replied De Guiche; &quot;but why
do you say that?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I appeal to his highness.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No doubt of it,&quot; said Monsieur, &quot;and Guiche knows perfectly
well that I regard him as a most finished cavalier.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, since that is decided, I resume. You have been in the
princess's society, count, for the last eight days, have you
not?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied De Guiche, coloring in spite of himself.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, tell us frankly, what do you think of her
personal appearance?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of her personal appearance?&quot; returned De Guiche, stupefied.</P>
<P>&quot;`Yes; of her appearance, of her mind, of herself, in fact.&quot;</P>
<P>Astounded by this question, De Guiche hesitated answering.</P>
<P>&quot;Come, come, De Guiche,&quot; resumed the chevalier, laughingly,
&quot;tell us your opinion frankly; the prince commands it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; said the prince, &quot;be frank.&quot;</P>
<P>De Guiche stammered out a few unintelligible words.</P>
<P>&quot;I am perfectly well aware,&quot; returned Monsieur, &quot;that the
subject is a delicate one, but you know you can tell me
everything. What do you think of her?&quot;</P>
<P>In order to avoid betraying his real thoughts, De Guiche had
recourse to the only defense which a man taken by surprise
really has, and accordingly told an untruth. &quot;I do not find
Madame,&quot; he said, &quot;either good or bad looking, yet rather
good than bad looking.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What! count,&quot; exclaimed the chevalier, &quot;you who went into
such ecstasies and uttered so many exclamations at the sight
of her portrait.&quot;</P>
<P>De Guiche colored violently. Very fortunately his horse,
which was slightly restive, enabled him by a sudden plunge
to conceal his agitation. &quot;What portrait!&quot; he murmured,
joining them again. The chevalier had not taken his eyes off
him.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, the portrait. Was not the miniature a good likeness?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do not remember. I had forgotten the portrait; it quite
escaped my recollection.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And yet it made a very marked impression upon you,&quot; said
the chevalier.</P>
<P>&quot;That is not unlikely.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is she witty, at all events?&quot; inquired the duke.</P>
<P>&quot;I believe so, my lord.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is M. de Buckingham witty, too?&quot; said the chevalier.</P>
<P>&quot;I do not know.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My own opinion is, that he must be,&quot; replied the chevalier,
&quot;for he makes Madame laugh, and she seems to take no little
pleasure in his society, which never happens to a clever
woman when in the company of a simpleton.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of course, then, he must be clever,&quot; said De Guiche,
simply.</P>
<P>At this moment Raoul opportunely arrived, seeing how De
Guiche was pressed by his dangerous questioner, to whom he
addressed a remark, and in that way changed the
conversation. The entree was brilliant and joyous.</P>
<P>The king, in honor of his brother, had directed that the
festivities should be on a scale of the greatest possible
magnificence. Madame and her mother alighted at the Louvre,
where, during their exile, they had so gloomily submitted to
obscurity, misery, and privations of every description. That
palace, which had been so inhospitable a residence for the
unhappy daughter of Henry IV., the naked walls, the uneven
floorings, the ceilings matted with cobwebs, the vast
dilapidated chimney-places, the cold hearths on which the
charity extended to them by parliament hardly permitted a
fire to glow, was completely altered in appearance. The
richest hangings and the thickest carpets, glistening
flagstones and pictures, with their richly gilded frames; in
every direction could be seen candelabra, mirrors, and
furniture and fittings of the most sumptuous character; in
every direction, also, were guards of the proudest military
bearing, with floating plumes, crowds of attendants and
courtiers in the ante-chambers and upon the staircases. In
the courtyards, where the grass had formerly been allowed to
luxuriate, as if the ungrateful Mazarin had thought it a
good idea to let the Parisians perceive that solitude and
disorder were, with misery and despair, the fit
accompaniments of fallen monarchy, the immense courtyards,
formerly silent and desolate, were now thronged with
courtiers whose horses were pacing and prancing to and fro.
The carriages were filled with young and beautiful women,
who awaited the opportunity of saluting, as she passed, the
daughter of that daughter of France who, during her
widowhood and exile, had sometimes gone without wood for her
fire, and bread for her table, whom the meanest attendants
at the chateau had treated with indifference and contempt.
And so, Madame Henrietta once more returned to the Louvre,
with her heart more swollen with bitter recollections than
her daughter's, whose disposition was fickle and forgetful,
with triumph and delight. She knew but too well this
brilliant reception was paid to the happy mother of a king
restored to his throne, a throne second to none in Europe,
while the worse than indifferent reception she had before
met with was paid to her, the daughter of Henry IV., as a
punishment for having been unfortunate. After the princesses
had been installed in their apartments and had rested, the
gentlemen who had formed their escort, having, in like
manner, recovered from their fatigue, they resumed their
accustomed habits and occupations. Raoul began by setting
off to see his father, who had left for Blois. He then tried
to see M. d'Artagnan, who, however, being engaged in the
organization of a military household for the king, could not
be found anywhere. Bragelonne next sought out De Guiche, but
the count was occupied in a long conference with his tailors
and with Manicamp, which consumed his whole time. With the
Duke of Buckingham he fared still worse, for the duke was
purchasing horses after horses, diamonds upon diamonds. He
monopolized every embroiderer, jeweler, and tailor that
Paris could boast of. Between De Guiche and himself a
vigorous contest ensued, invariably a courteous one, in
which, in order to insure success, the duke was ready to
spend a million; while the Marechal de Grammont had only
allowed his son sixty thousand francs. So Buckingham laughed
and spent his money. Guiche groaned in despair, and would
have shown it more violently, had it not been for the advice
De Bragelonne gave him.</P>
<P>&quot;A million!&quot; repeated De Guiche daily; &quot;I must submit. Why
will not the marechal advance me a portion of my patrimony?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because you would throw it away,&quot; said Raoul.</P>
<P>&quot;What can that matter to him? If I am to die of it, I shall
die of it, and then I shall need nothing further.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But what need is there to die?&quot; said Raoul.</P>
<P>&quot;I do not wish to be conquered in elegance by an
Englishman.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My dear count,&quot; said Manicamp, &quot;elegance is not a costly
commodity, it is only a very difficult accomplishment.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, but difficult things cost a good deal of money, and I
have only got sixty thousand francs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A very embarrassing state of things, truly,&quot; said De
Wardes; &quot;even if you spent as much as Buckingham there is
only nine hundred and forty thousand francs difference.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Where am I to find them?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Get into debt.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am in debt already.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A greater reason for getting further.&quot;</P>
<P>Advice like this resulted in De Guiche becoming excited to
such an extent that he committed extravagances where
Buckingham only incurred expenses. The rumor of this
extravagant profuseness delighted the hearts of all the
shopkeepers in Paris, from the hotel of the Duke of
Buckingham to that of the Comte de Grammont nothing but
miracles was attempted. While all this was going on, Madame
was resting herself, and Bragelonne was engaged in writing
to Mademoiselle de la Valliere. He had already dispatched
four letters, and not an answer to any one of them had been
received, when, on the very morning fixed for the marriage
ceremony, which was to take place in the chapel at the
Palais-Royal, Raoul, who was dressing, heard his valet
announce M. de Malicorne. &quot;What can this Malicorne want with
me?&quot; thought Raoul; and then said to his valet, &quot;Let him
wait.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is a gentleman from Blois,&quot; said the valet.</P>
<P>&quot;Admit him at once,&quot; said Raoul, eagerly.</P>
<P>Malicorne entered as brilliant as a star, and wearing a
superb sword at his side. After having saluted Raoul most
gracefully, he said: &quot;M. de Bragelonne, I am the bearer of a
thousand compliments from a lady to you.&quot;</P>
<P>Raoul colored. &quot;From a lady,&quot; said he, &quot;from a lady of
Blois?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, monsieur; from Mademoiselle de Montalais.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you, monsieur; I recollect you now,&quot; said Raoul. &quot;And
what does Mademoiselle de Montalais require of me?&quot;</P>
<P>Malicorne drew four letters from his pocket, which he
offered to Raoul.</P>
<P>&quot;My own letters, is it possible?&quot; he said, turning pale; &quot;my
letters, and the seals unbroken?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur, your letters did not find at Blois the person to
whom they were addressed, and so they are now returned to
you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Mademoiselle de la Valliere has left Blois, then?&quot;
exclaimed Raoul.</P>
<P>&quot;Eight days ago.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Where is she, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In Paris.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How was it known that these letters were from me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Mademoiselle de Montalais recognized your handwriting and
your seal,&quot; said Malicorne.</P>
<P>Raoul colored and smiled. &quot;Mademoiselle de Montalais is
exceedingly amiable,&quot; he said; &quot;she is always kind and
charming.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Always, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Surely she could give me some precise information about
Mademoiselle de la Valliere. I never could find her in this
immense city.&quot;</P>
<P>Malicorne drew another packet from his pocket.</P>
<P>&quot;You may possibly find in this letter what you are anxious
to learn.&quot;</P>
<P>Raoul hurriedly broke the seal. The writing was that of
Mademoiselle Aure, and inclosed were these words:  -  &quot;Paris,
Palais-Royal. The day of the nuptial blessing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What does this mean?&quot; inquired Raoul of Malicorne; &quot;you
probably know.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For pity's sake, tell me, then.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Impossible, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why so?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because Mademoiselle Aure has forbidden me to do so.&quot;</P>
<P>Raoul looked at his strange visitor, and remained silent;  - 
&quot;At least, tell me whether it is fortunate or unfortunate.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That you will see.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are very severe in your reservations.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Will you grant me a favor, monsieur?&quot; said Malicorne.</P>
<P>&quot;In exchange for that you refuse me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Precisely.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have the greatest desire to see the ceremony, and I have
no ticket to admit me, in spite of all the steps I have
taken to secure one. Could you get me admitted &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do me this kindness, then, I entreat.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Most willingly, monsieur; come with me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am exceedingly indebted to you, monsieur,&quot; said
Malicorne.</P>
<P>&quot;I thought you were a friend of M. de Manicamp.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am, monsieur; but this morning I was with him as he was
dressing, and I let a bottle of blacking fall over his new
dress, and he flew at me sword in hand, so that I was
obliged to make my escape. That is the reason I could not
ask him for a ticket. He wanted to kill me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I can well believe it,&quot; laughed Raoul. &quot;I know Manicamp is
capable of killing a man who has been unfortunate enough to
commit the crime you have to reproach yourself with, but I
will repair the mischief as far as you are concerned. I will
but fasten my cloak, and shall then be ready to serve you,
not only as a guide, but as your introducer, too.&quot;</P></article>
