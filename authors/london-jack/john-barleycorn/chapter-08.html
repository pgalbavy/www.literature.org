We met by appointment, early Monday morning, to complete the deal,
in Johnny Heinhold's "Last Chance "--a saloon, of course, for the
transactions of men.  I paid the money over, received the bill of
sale, and French Frank treated.  This struck me as an evident
custom, and a logical one--the seller, who receives, the money, to
wet a piece of it in the establishment where the trade was
consummated.  But, to my surprise, French Frank treated the house. 
He and I drank, which seemed just; but why should Johnny Heinhold,
who owned the saloon and waited behind the bar, be invited to
drink? I figured it immediately that he made a profit on the very
drink he drank.  I could, in a way, considering that they were
friends and shipmates, understand Spider and Whisky Bob being
asked to drink; but why should the longshoremen, Bill Kelley and
Soup Kennedy, be asked?
<P>
Then there was Pat, the Queen's brother, making a total of eight
of us.  It was early morning, and all ordered whisky.  What could
I do, here in this company of big men, all drinking whisky?
"Whisky," I said, with the careless air of one who had said it a
thousand times.  And such whisky! I tossed it down.  A-r-r-r-gh! I
can taste it yet.
<P>
And I was appalled at the price French Frank had paid--eighty
cents.  EIGHTY CENTS!  It was an outrage to my thrifty soul. 
Eighty cents--the equivalent of eight long hours of my toil at the
machine, gone down our throats, and gone like that, in a
twinkling, leaving only a bad taste in the mouth.  There was no
discussion that French Frank was a waster.
<P>
I was anxious to be gone, out into the sunshine, out over the
water to my glorious boat.  But all hands lingered.  Even Spider,
my crew, lingered.  No hint broke through my obtuseness of why
they lingered.  I have often thought since of how they must have
regarded me, the newcomer being welcomed into their company
standing at bar with them, and not standing for a single round of
drinks.
<P>
French Frank, who, unknown to me, had swallowed his chagrin since
the day before, now that the money for the Razzle Dazzle was in
his pocket, began to behave curiously toward me.  I sensed the
change in his attitude, saw the forbidding glitter in his eyes,
and wondered.  The more I saw of men, the queerer they became. 
Johnny Heinhold leaned across the bar and whispered in my ear s
"He's got it in for you.  Watch out."
<P>
I nodded comprehension of his statement, and acquiescence in it,
as a man should nod who knows all about men.  But secretly I was
perplexed.  Heavens! How was I, who had worked hard and read books
of adventure, and who was only fifteen years old, who had not
dreamed of giving the Queen of the Oyster Pirates a second
thought, and who did not know that French Frank was madly and
Latinly in love with her--how was I to guess that I had done him
shame? And how was I to guess that the story of how the Queen had
thrown him down on his own boat, the moment I hove in sight, was
already the gleeful gossip of the water-front? And by the same
token, how was I to guess that her brother Pat's offishness with
me was anything else than temperamental gloominess of spirit?
<P>
Whisky Bob got me aside a moment.  "Keep your eyes open," he
muttered.  "Take my tip.  French Frank's ugly.  I'm going up river
with him to get a schooner for oystering.  When he gets down on
the beds, watch out.  He says he'll run you down.  After dark, any
time he's around, change your anchorage and douse your riding
light.  Savve?"
<P>
Oh, certainly, I savve'd.  I nodded my head, and, as one man to
another, thanked him for his tip; and drifted back to the group at
the bar.  No; I did not treat.  I never dreamed that I was
expected to treat.  I left with Spider, and my ears burn now as I
try to surmise the things they must have said about me.
<P>
I asked Spider, in an off-hand way, what was eating French Frank. 
"He's crazy jealous of you," was the answer.  "Do you think so?" I
said, and dismissed the matter as not worth thinking about.
<P>
But I leave it to any one--the swell of my fifteen-years-old
manhood at learning that French Frank, the adventurer of fifty,
the sailor of all the seas of all the world, was jealous of me--
and jealous over a girl most romantically named the Queen of the
Oyster Pirates.  I had read of such things in books, and regarded
them as personal probabilities of a distant maturity.  Oh, I felt
a rare young devil, as we hoisted the big mainsail that morning,
broke out anchor, and filled away close-hauled on the three-mile
beat to windward out into the bay.
<P>
Such was my escape from the killing machine-toil, and my
introduction to the oyster pirates.  True, the introduction had
begun with drink, and the life promised to continue with drink. 
But was I to stay away from it for such reason? Wherever life ran
free and great, there men drank.  Romance and Adventure seemed
always to go down the street locked arm in arm with John
Barleycorn.  To know the two, I must know the third.  Or else I
must go back to my free library books and read of the deeds of
other men and do no deeds of my own save slave for ten cents an
hour at a machine in a cannery.
<P>
No; I was not to be deterred from this brave life on the water by
the fact that the water-dwellers had queer and expensive desires
for beer and wine and whisky.  What if their notions of happiness
included the strange one of seeing me drink? When they persisted
in buying the stuff and thrusting it upon me, why, I would drink
it.  It was the price I would pay for their comradeship.  And I
didn't have to get drunk.  I had not got drunk the Sunday
afternoon I arranged to buy the Razzle Dazzle, despite the fact
that not one of the rest was sober.  Well, I could go on into the
future that way, drinking the stuff when it gave them pleasure
that I should drink it, but carefully avoiding over-drinking.
