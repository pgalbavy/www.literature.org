<p>"The folks will leave the house," said Tom Wagstaff, "about half-past
seven, and there will be no one home but me and Maggie, the girl.
I’ll be up in my room and Maggie down-stairs. When I lean out
the window and wave my hand I want you, Jim, to fire two or three
charges out of your revolver through the winders of the dining-room."</p>

<p>"What for?" asked the startled Jim.</p>

<p>"Wait, and I’ll tell you; the noise of the pistol and the breaking
of the glass will scare Maggie half to death: she will run out
of the house, and you and Billy must then slip inside, hurry up-stairs,
tie me to the bed-post, and put a gag in my mouth. I’ll have all
the money and jewelry ready in a handkerchief, and you can scoot
with it. Maggie will run down to the Hall and tell father and
mother, and they’ll hurry home and be so scared they won’t know
what to do. They’ll untie me, and I’ll pretend I’m almost dead,
and they’ll call in the police, and when I come to, I’ll have
a story to tell about robbers with masks on their faces, and all
that sort of thing, and they’ll hunt for ’em, and never smell
a mouse. What do you think of it, fellers?"</p>

<p>It was a scheme which, in its vicious cunning, was worthy of
older scamps than these three young school-boys; but their minds
were poisoned by pernicious reading, and they eagerly entered
into its spirit. Everything promised success, and Tom, the originator
of the plan, found his companions as eager as himself to lend
a hand in carrying it out.</p>

<p>It seemed as if fate had arranged to help the boys. When the
three climbed over the fence again into the highway, and separated
to their homes, Tom, in order that there should be no miscarriage
of the programme, took pains to be particularly ugly and impudent
to his parents. His kind-hearted father was disposed at first
to recall the threat made in the morning that his son should not
go with the rest to the concert in the Town Hall, but he was so
irritated by the behavior of the lad that he not only carried
out his threat, but was on the point of chastising him before
leaving home.</p>

<p>It followed, therefore, that when eight o’clock came, the condition
of the household was just what Tom prophesied and wished. Maggie,
the hired girl, was busy at her duties below-stairs, when he stole
softly to the upper story and began his work of ransacking the
bureau-drawers. He found considerable jewelry belonging to his
mother and sisters, besides over seventy dollars in money which
his father had left within easy reach.</p>

<p>All this was gathered into a handkerchief, which was securely
tied and placed on a chair beside the window, where the gas was
burning at full head. Then, everything being in readiness, he
quietly raised the window and looked out.</p>

<p>The night was dark, without any moon, and even his keen eyes
could detect nothing among the dense trees which surrounded the
fine residence of his father. But, when he whistled, there was
a reply from under the branches which he recognized as coming
from his allies, who were on the lookout.</p>

<p>Tom waved his hand, lowered the sash, and stepped back from the
window.</p>

<p>Maggie was singing below-stairs and, with that exception, everything
was still. His heart beat fast as he knew that the opening of
the drama, as it may be called, was at hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly the sharp report of a pistol rang out on the night,
followed by a second and third shot, mingled with the crash and
jingle of glass. Jim McGovern was doing his part with unquestioned
promptness.</p>

<p>The singing of Maggie ceased as if she were paralyzed by the
shock; but with the third report her scream pierced every nook
in the building, and she was heard running to and fro as if in
blind terror. She would have dashed up-stairs to escape, but a
noise on the rear porch caused her to believe the burglars were
about entering the building, and she was certain to be killed
if she remained.</p>

<p>Through the front door she went in the darkness, her screams
stilled through fear that the dreaded beings would be guided by
them; and, recovering her senses somewhat when she reached the
street, she hurried in the direction of the Town Hall to acquaint
Mr. and Mrs. Wagstaff with the awful goings-on at home.</p>

<p>Billy Waylett and Jim McGovern were on the watch, and the moment
she vanished they entered through the rear door, which remained
unlocked, and hastened up-stairs to the room where the gas was
burning and from which Tom had signalled to them.</p>

<p>"Quick, fellers!" he said, as they burst into the apartment,
"father will soon be back."</p>

<p>"Where’s the rope?" asked Jim.</p>

<p>"There on the chair."</p>

<p>"What’s that handkerchief for?"</p>

<p>"The money and jewelry is in it; tie me first and then hurry
out with that, and take good care of it till to-morrow, when we
will fix things; hurry up!"</p>

<p>Billy had the rope in hand, and both boys set to work to bind
the young rogue to the bed-post. Since the victim gave all the
aid he could, the task was completed with less delay and difficulty
than would have been supposed.</p>

<p>This was due also to the preparations which Tom had made for
the business. A strong bed-cord, cut in several pieces, was at
hand. His wrists were bound together behind his back; then his
ankles were joined, and finally the longest piece of rope was
wound several times around his waist and made fast to the bed-post.
This rendered him helpless, and he could not have released himself
had his life been at stake.</p>

<p>But the shrewd boy knew that something more must be done. Though
tied securely, his mouth was at command, and it was to be expected
that he would use his voice with the fullest power the moment
his captors left him alone.</p>

<p>But with all the cunning displayed by Tom, and with all his perfect
preparations in other respects, and after having referred to the
necessity of the gagging operation, he had forgotten to be ready
for it.</p>

<p>"What shall we put in your mouth?" asked Jim, pausing and looking
round after the binding was finished.</p>

<p>"Golly! I forgot all about that," was the reply.</p>

<p>Billy darted to the bureau and caught up a large hair-brush.</p>

<p>"How’ll this do?" he asked, holding it up to view.</p>

<p>"It won’t do at all," was the disgusted reply; "it’s too big
for my mouth."</p>

<p>"I don’t know ’bout that; you’ve got the biggest mouth in school."</p>

<p>"We’ll take a sheet off the bed," said Jim, beginning to tug
at the coverlets.</p>

<p>"What’s the matter with you?" asked Tom; "do you think you can
cram a whole sheet in my mouth?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"’Cause you can’t; that’s the reason."</p>

<p>"I have it," exclaimed Billy, running to the corner of the room
and catching up a porcelain cuspidor; "this will just fit. Open
your mouth, Tom, and give me a chance."</p>

<p>But at this juncture, when the perplexity threatened to upset
everything, Billy Waylett solved the difficulty by whisking out
his linen pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Now you’re talking," remarked the pleased Tom; "why didn’t we
think of that before?"</p>

<p>It was curious, indeed, that they did not, and it was curious,
too, in view of the cunning shown in other directions, that all
three forgot a precaution which ought to have occurred to them.</p>

<p>A handkerchief was just the thing to be used to seal the mouth
of the victim, but it should have come from the pocket of Tom
Wagstaff instead of from Billy Waylett’s.</p>

<p>Perhaps had the boys felt that abundance of time was at command,
they would have thought of this necessity; but they were well
aware that Maggie, the servant, was making good speed to the Town
Hall, and that Mr. Wagstaff would not let the grass grow under
his feet on his way home. Besides, too, the screams of the girl
were likely to bring others to the spot before the coming of the
owner of the house. The boys, therefore, had not a minute to throw
away, and they did not idle their time.</p>

<p>The twisted handkerchief was pushed between the open jaws of
the victim, like the bit in a horse’s mouth, and then knotted
and tied behind his head. Billy, who took charge of this little
job, was not over-gentle, and more than once the victim protested.
Little heed, however, was paid to him, and his words were but
feeble mumblings when sifted through the meshes of the handkerchief.</p>

<p>"There! I guess that’ll do," said Billy, stepping back and surveying
his work; "how do you feel, Tommy?"</p>

<p>The latter nodded his head, mumbled, and tried to speak. He was
urging them to leave, but his words were unintelligible.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jim had picked up the other handkerchief, tied at the
corners, and was surprised to find how heavy it was. It contained
much valuable property.</p>

<p>The boys were reminded of their remissness by the sound of voices
on the outside. Neighbors were at hand.</p>

<p>"We’re caught; it’s too late; what shall we do?" gasped Jim,
dropping the handkerchief with its precious contents.</p>

<p>"They will hang us for bigamy," replied Billy, turning pale and
trembling in every limb.</p>

<p>Tom Wagstaff tried hard to utter a few words, and was struggling
to free himself, but succeeded in neither attempt.</p>

<p>"Come on!" whispered Jim, catching up his load again; "they haven’t
got in, and we may have a chance."</p>

<p>He whisked through the open door, and scurried down the carpeted
stairs, with Billy so close on his heels that both narrowly escaped
bumping and rolling to the bottom.</p>

<p>The voices were louder, and it looked as if the youngsters were
caught.</p>

<p>And such would have been the case, but for the timidity of the
parties out-doors. They had been drawn thither by the out-cries
of the servant, and were convinced that some fearful tragedy was
going on, or had been completed within the dwelling.</p>

<p>These people were unarmed, and it was only natural that they
should shrink from entering where several desperate men were supposed
to be at bay. They consulted with each other and decided to await
the arrival of re-enforcements.</p>

<p>This was the golden opportunity of the young scamps. The rear
door was ajar and they noiselessly drew it inward far enough to
allow them to pass through.</p>

<p>Before venturing forth they peeped out in the darkness. They
could see nothing, though, for that matter, there might have been
a dozen persons within a few feet without being visible; but the
room in which the lads stood was also without a light, so that
the advantage was equal.</p>

<p>The sound of the voices showed that the new arrivals were at
the front, and the way was open for the flight of the amateur
burglars, who still hesitated, afraid that men were lying in wait
to nab them.</p>

<p>More than likely they would have tarried too long, but for a
movement on the part of the newcomers. They were increasing so
fast that they became courageous, and one of them pushed open
the front door.</p>

<p>The creaking of its hinges and the tramping in the adjoining
room spurred Jim and Billy, who hesitated no longer. Through the
door they stole on tip-toe, and a few steps took them across the
porch to the soft ground, where the soft earth gave back no sound.
The trees, too, seemed to spread their protecting branches over
them, and inspired them with such courage that, after hurrying
a few rods, they came to a stop and looked back and listened.</p>

<p>"By George! that was the luckiest thing that ever happened to
us!" whispered Jim McGovern, with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"That’s so," assented his companion; "I thought we was goners
sure, and we come mighty nigh it."</p>

<p>"I wonder whether that gag is too tight in Tom’s mouth?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not; can’t he breathe through his nose?"</p>

<p>"But mebbe he has a cold."</p>

<p>"That won’t make any difference, for he knows how to breathe
through his ears; Tom’s too smart to die yet. Besides, if he <em>is</em>
dead, it’s too late for us to help him; them folks are upstairs
by this time, and they’ll get the handkerchief out of his mouth
in a jiffy, unless, mebbe, he has swallowed it."</p>

<p>"I say, Billy," said Jim, "this thing in my hand weighs more
than a ton!"</p>

<p>"It must have lots of gold in it; shall I help you carry it?"</p>

<p>"No, I can manage it; but what shall we do with the thing? It
won’t do to take it home, for our folks might find it."</p>

<p>"We’ll bury it under that stump back of our barn."</p>

<p>"Is that a good place?"</p>

<p>"There aint any better in the world, for nobody wouldn’t think
of looking there for it."</p>

<p>"I seen our dog Bowser pawing under the stump the other day."</p>

<p>"But he wasn’t pawing for money; we’ll hide it there till we’re
ready to use it."</p>

<p>The two moved off, when they heard another cry from the house
behind them. They recognized it as the voice of Mrs. Wagstaff,
who had arrived on the scene with her husband, and was probably
overcome at sight of the woful plight of her boy.</p>
