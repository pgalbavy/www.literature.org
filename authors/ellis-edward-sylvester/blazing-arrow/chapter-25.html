<p>The paint on the face of the Shawanoe could not hide the astonishment
caused by the words of Wharton Edwards. Despite the askew brain,
the Indian was wonderfully shrewd in some respects.</p>

<p>"Go after dem&mdash;den be killed."</p>

<p>"Why will we be killed?"</p>

<p>"Shaw'noe wait for dem&mdash;bimeby dey shoot&mdash;both fall off horse
&mdash;Shaw'noe take scalp&mdash;you go dere&mdash;take your scalp."</p>

<p>"Arqu-wao," said the distressed youth, stepping in front of the
red man, "those horses are ridden by my father and mother; they
are on their way to the settlement; we started out to come home
with them; we must save them; we will do so or die with them."</p>

<p>These words, uttered with a depth of feeling hard to describe,
were understood by the Shawanoe. He comprehended on the instant
that the couple on horseback were so far along the trail that
it was impossible for the two boys on foot to overtake them. Such
was the fact concerning the elder of the two, but he probably
would have changed his mind had he been aware of the fleetness
of the younger one.</p>

<p>"Me catch dem," he hastened to say; "horse walk &mdash;Arqu-wao
run faster den horse&mdash;he hurry&mdash;tell dem&mdash;me do that?"</p>

<p>The rising inflection showed that he only awaited the word to
start off like the wind, but young Edwards was in a distressing
quandary. The revelations of the last few minutes pointed to the
loyalty of this strange being. He had certainly started them along
the trail toward the block-house, as he had promised, and there
was every reason to believe that he would have soon landed them
there but for this unexpected check. Nevertheless the youths could
not free themselves from the suspicion that the whole proceeding
was a part of a deep laid scheme for their own overthrow.</p>

<p>If he should be told to hurry back over the path and do his best
to warn the parents of their peril, he would pass beyond reach
of the boys, and consequently beyond any punishment they could
visit upon him for his treachery.</p>

<p>But what should be done?</p>

<p>True, Wharton could have run, too, and there was little doubt
that he was fully the equal of the guide, since he had vanquished
the champion runner of his tribe.</p>

<p>He turned his head and asked Larry in a low voice for his advice,
stating the project that had come into his mind. Larry urged him
to carry it out.</p>

<p>"Ye can travel as fast as him, and ye can shoot him if he tries
his tricks."</p>

<p>"But it will separate you and me."</p>

<p>"I'll follow as fast as I can go; I can't run like ye, but I'm
sure that if there's any fighting to be done I'll be on hand in
time to give some help."</p>

<p>"Go 'mong trees&mdash;hide quick &mdash;Shawanoe coming."</p>

<p>It was Arqu-wao who uttered these words, with every evidence
of agitation. He made quick gestures, and was so urgent that he
compelled instant obedience.</p>

<p>Wharton and Larry sprang out of the path, and each darting behind
the trunk of a large tree, peered cautiously out to learn the
cause of the sudden alarm of their guide.</p>

<p>They saw nothing, but his actions were singular. Instead of remaining
where he was, he took a number of short, quick steps, which carried
him several rods farther toward the block-house. Then he halted
as suddenly as a soldier in obedience to the command of his officer.</p>

<p>"Sh! look out! there they are!" whispered Wharton to his friend,
but a few paces away.</p>

<p>Several flickering objects, seen through the trees, revealed
themselves to be three Shawanoes in their war paint, striding
along the trail as though they were runners from the block-house
to the settlement. In fact their gait was a loping trot until
they slowed down on seeing Arqu-wao.</p>

<p>There could be no mistaking them for runners, for not only did
their war paint forbid this, but with feelings that can be imagined
the youth recognized the leader as Blazing Arrow, the savage who
hated the white people with an intensity beyond imagination.</p>

<p>"This will settle the question about Arqu-wao," thought Wharton,
"for he now has our lives in his hands; if he tells the truth
to Blazing Arrow, and joins him and the rest, they will separate
and shoot us down in spite of all we can do."</p>

<p>This was the situation, and a few brief minutes must determine
the fate of the boys, who, in the event of betrayal, were doomed.
Hardly daring to look around the bark of the trees, they could
only wait and prepare themselves for the issue of the conference.</p>

<p>They saw Blazing Arrow stride forward, and, halting in front
of Arqu-wao, address him in tones so loud that they were plainly
heard by the listeners, who, however, could form no idea of their
meaning.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the fierce warrior gesticulated as if angry.
If so, the one to whom he spoke showed no fear of him. He answered
in a voice as loud, and with more gestures, the other two warriors
remaining in the background and leaving all to their leader.</p>

<p>Blazing Arrow made a threatening gesture, placing his right hand
on the knife at his girdle. Arqu-wao withdrew a couple of steps
and whipped an arrow from his quiver. Possessing no other weapon
than the bow, he made ready to use that. Not once, so far as the
boys could see, did he show a sign of quailing.</p>

<p>It was evident that, desperate as might be the resistance he
offered, he was helpless, inasmuch as each of the three warriors
possessed a loaded rifle, and he could have been shot down in
a twinkling; but he was ready to fight for his life.</p>

<p>Blazing Arrow moderated his manner. His hand slipped from the
weapon at his waist, and he talked in a lower voice. Arqu-wao
stepped a little closer and responded in kind. Neither one of
the others so much as opened his mouth.</p>

<p>Blazing Arrow pointed down to the ground several times, and it
looked as if he were discussing the hoofprints which showed so
plainly at their very feet.</p>

<p>A thrill of admiration shot through Wharton Edwards, for at that
moment he read the meaning of Arqu-wao's strategy on discovering
the approach of the Shawanoes. He had hurried forward a short
way, so that when the meeting took place nothing would be visible
of the footprints made by the boys. They would reveal themselves,
as a matter of course, farther along the trail, but Blazing Arrow
was not likely to make as diligent search there as at the spot
where the interview took place.</p>

<p>"I believe he is honest after all," was the conclusion of Wharton,
when this thought came to him. "I wonder whether, if we have a
fight, he will help us or Blazing Arrow? I don't see why he should
be such a friend to us, when he tried to kill us a short time
ago."</p>

<p>There was plenty to occupy the minds of the boys during the few
minutes they shrank behind the trees in such suspense, not knowing
the instant when they would be called upon to fight for their
lives.</p>

<p>They asked themselves that, if the hoofprints in the trail had
been made by the horses of Mr. Edwards and his wife, how was it
that they had got by Blazing Arrow and his companions without
detection? It was not to be supposed that they had been permitted
to do so for the purpose of drawing them into a trap, for there
was no call for such a course. Three Indians, crouching in ambush,
could shoot a man and his wife from their horses without the slightest
danger to themselves, or, if they chose, they could have slain
the man and made the woman captive.</p>

<p>It looked as if, by some strange turn of events, the couple had
slipped by undiscovered.</p>

<p>The conference continued but a few minutes. After the outburst
of Blazing Arrow, he did not show any more excitement. He exchanged
some words with Arqu-wao, and then waved him aside. The fellow
obeyed rather sullenly, and the three Shawanoes resumed their
walk in the direction of the falls.</p>

<p>It was a dangerous proceeding for the boys to watch them as they
drew near their hiding-place. Larry did not do so, but shrank
as close as he could against the trunk of a tree, fearful of betraying
himself, and trying to shift his position, as they moved along,
so as to prevent any part of his body being seen by any of the
roving glances of the party.</p>

<p>Fully aware of the danger, Wharton could not help yielding to
his curiosity to that extent that he had kept an eye on Blazing
Arrow, even when he was at the nearest point of the trail. He
studied the ugly countenance, smeared with paint, and the irregular
profile of each warrior in turn as he filed past. Not one of them
looked down at the ground, but their eyes seemed to be fixed on
the farthest point of the trail which was in their field of vision,
as though they were expecting some one to reveal himself.</p>

<p>Had they looked down at the ground they must have discovered
the footprints of the boys, and what then?</p>

<p>Arqu-wao, rather curiously, held the same position which has
already been described; his left side was toward the boys, and
also toward the vanishing group of his people. It was the attitude
he would have taken had he intended to use his bow and arrow,
and, after what had occurred, the boys could not believe he thought
of injury to them. Beyond all question he had allowed the best
opportunity to overcome them pass. Having done that, it seemed
idle to suspect him any longer.</p>

<p>The only "fly in the ointment" was the explanation of the sudden
friendship on the part of the strange being. He had been caught
in the very act of an attempt to slay the boys, as he would have
been glad to do, when they paddled away with his canoe. They,
in turn, after sparing his life, had partially disarmed him, and
then compelled him by threats to act the part of a guide.</p>

<p>The motive of gratitude which sometimes influences the American
Indian (and just as frequently does not) could hardly be expected
to crystallize at such brief notice into a sentiment strong enough
to lead the red man to risk his life so soon for them; and yet,
admitting that he was true to his pledge, no other explanation
of Arqu-wao's course was possible.</p>
