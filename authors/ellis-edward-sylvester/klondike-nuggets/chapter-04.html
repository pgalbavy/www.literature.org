<p>It was late in the day that the little steamer arrived at Dyea,
which was found to be a village with one log store, a number of
movable tents, and without any wharf, the beach being so flat
that at high water the tide reaches a half mile or more inland.
To guard against losing any of their supplies, Tim McCabe told
his friends that it would be necessary to unload them themselves.</p>

<p>"From this p'int," said he, "we must hoe our own row; under hiven
we must depind on oursilves. Hardman, lind a hand there, and step
lively."</p>

<p>To the astonishment of the youths, the man took hold and wrought
with right good will. Jeff looked at Tim queerly as he pointed
out the different articles, he himself, as may be said, overlooking
the job; but the conclusion was that the Irishman had promised
him a small amount for his help. When, however, the task was finished
Tim came to the group, and while Hardman, with shamefaced expression,
remained in the background, he said with that simplicity which
any one would find hard to resist:</p>

<p>"You see poor Hardman is in bad luck; he hain't any outfit, and
wants to go to the gold fields, but will have to git some one
to stake him. Obsarving the same, I made bowld to remark that
it would give me frind Jiff the highest plisure to do it for him,
not forgetting to obsarve that I knew his company would be agreeable
to the byes, and he will be of great hilp to the same."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blessed!" exclaimed the old miner, removing his hat
and mopping his forehead with his big red handkerchief. Then he
turned half way round and looked steadily at the fellow, who was
standing with his head down.</p>

<p>"Poor dog! let him come along, but if he makes any trouble, I'll
hold you responsible, Tim."</p>

<p>"And I'll be happy to take charge of the same 'sponsibility,
and if he don't toe the mark, it's mesilf that will make him.
Do you hear that, Ike?" he roared, turning fiercely toward the
fellow, who started, and meekly replied that he heard, though
it was impossible for anything to reach him except the last thunderous
demand.</p>

<p>"It isn't for us to say anything," remarked Roswell aside to
his chum, "but that means trouble for us all."</p>

<p>"It surely does; we must be on our guard against him."</p>

<p>The outfits were piled on a sandspit about a mile below the trading
posts of Healy and Wilson. In the foreground were the ranch and
store owned by them, and beyond towered the coast mountains, their
tops gleaming in the sunshine with enormous masses of snow, while
hundreds of miles still beyond stretched the immense Yukon country,
toward which the eyes of the civilized world are turned at the
present time.</p>

<p>One of the strange facts connected with Alaska and the adjoining
region is that in May the sun rises at 3 o'clock and sets at 9,
while in June it rises at 1.30 and sets at 10.30. Thus the summer
day is twenty hours long, and it has a diffuse twilight. The change
from winter to summer is rapid, winter setting in in September,
and in the Klondike region zero weather lasts from November to
May, though at times the weather moderates early in March, but
does not become settled until May. The Yukon generally freezes
shut in the latter part of October, and breaks up about the middle
of May, when the western route to the gold fields by the river
becomes practicable.</p>

<p>The hour was so late when our friends had finished carrying their
outfit beyond reach of the high tide, which rises twenty feet
at Dyea, that they lodged and took their meals at the ranch trading
post. By arrangement, an early breakfast was eaten the next morning,
and the goods were loaded upon the two Yukon sleds with which
they were provided. These were seven feet long, sixteen inches
wide, and were shod with steel. Other gold-seekers were stopping,
like themselves, at the ranch, but they lagged so much that when
the men and boys headed northward they were alone.</p>

<p>Jeff Graham and Ike Hardman passed the rope attached to one of
the sleds over their shoulders, the elder in advance, and led
off. Tim took the lead, with the boys behind him, with the second
sled, following the trail left by their friends. The deep snow
was packed so hard that no use was made of the snow-shoes which
Jeff had provided.</p>

<p>From Dyea the trail led for five miles over the ice, when they
reached the mouth of the cañon. This is two miles long with an
average width of fifty feet. The sleds were dragged over the strong
ice, but later in the season, when it breaks up, travellers are
obliged to follow the trail to the east of the cañon.</p>

<p>The party were so unaccustomed to this kind of labor that they
found it exhausting. Curiously enough, Jeff bore the fatigue better
than any. His iron muscles were the last to yield, and he was
the first to resume the journey. He chaffed the others, and offered
to let them mount his sled while he pulled them.</p>

<p>Beyond the cañon is a strip of woods three miles in length, which
bears the name of Pleasant Camp, though it has not the first claim
to the name. It does not contain the ruins of even a cabin or
shanty&mdash;nothing, in fact, but trees, through which the wintry
winds sough and howl dismally. There the party halted, ate lunch,
rested for an hour, and then set out with the determination to
make the next camping ground before night.</p>

<p>The ascent now became gradual, and before the day was spent they
arrived at Sheep Camp, on the edge of the timber. This is the
last spot where wood for fuel can be obtained until the other
side of Chilkoot Pass is reached. The tent was pitched on top
of the snow, the poles and pins being shoved down into it. Jeff
took it upon himself to cut what fuel was needed, gathering at
the same time a liberal quantity of hemlock brush, upon which
to spread their blankets for beds.</p>

<p>Since it was necessary to use the stove, and it must rest on
the snow, a simple arrangement provided against trouble from the
melting of the latter. Three poles, eight feet in length, were
laid parallel on the snow and the stove placed upon them. Although
a hole was soon dissolved beneath, the length of the supports
kept the stove upright.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE TENT POLES WERE SHOVED DOWN INTO THE SNOW</em>.]</p>

<p>The experience which Jeff and Tim had had made them both excellent
cooks, which was a fortunate thing for the boys, since they would
have made sorry work in preparing a meal; but the art of the Irishman
deserved the many compliments it received. With the aid of baking
powder he prepared a goodly number of light, flaky biscuit, and
by exposing some of the butter to the warmth of the stove, it
was gradually changed from its stone-like hardness to a consistency
that permitted it to be cut with a knife and spread upon the hot
bread. The coffee was amber, clear, and fragrant, and with the
condensed milk and sugar would have reflected credit upon the
<em>chef</em> of any establishment. In addition, there were fried
bacon and canned corn.</p>

<p>Until this time the boys had never believed they could eat bacon,
but nothing could have had a more delicious flavor to them. It
was not alone because of their vigorous appetites, but partly
on account of the bitterly cold weather. There is a good deal
of animal heat evolved in the digestion of fat bacon, and it is
therefore among the favorite articles of food in the Arctic regions.</p>

<p>Probably there isn't a boy in the country who would not revolt
at the thought of eating a tallow candle, and yet if he was exposed
to the rigors of Greenland and the far north, he would soon look
upon it as one of the greatest delicacies of the table.</p>

<p>The hemlock branches were now spread on top of the snow at the
side of the tent, a large square of canvas was placed over them,
upon which the blankets and robes were put, the whole forming
a springy, comfortable bed.</p>

<p>Roswell and Frank were sure that in all their lives they were
never so tired. Leaving the three men to talk and smoke, they
stretched out on their blankets, wrapping themselves in them,
and almost immediately sank into deep, dreamless slumber.</p>

<p>The sleep had lasted perhaps a couple of hours, when, without
any apparent cause, Frank Mansley awoke in the full possession
of his senses. Lying motionless, he listened to the soft breathing
of his cousin beside him, while the regular respiration of the
men left no doubt of their condition. Everything around was in
blank, impenetrable darkness and all profoundly still.</p>

<p>"It's strange that I should awake like this," he thought, slightly
shifting his position. "I'm tired, and was so drowsy that I felt
as if I could sleep a week, but I was never wider awake than I
am this minute&mdash;"</p>

<p>Amid the all-pervading silence he was sensible of a low, solemn
murmur, like that of the distant ocean. At first it seemed to
be the "voice of silence" itself, but it steadily increased in
volume until its roar became overpowering. Startled and frightened,
he lay still, wondering what it could mean, or whether his senses
were deceiving him. Then he suddenly remembered the vast masses
of ice and snow which towered above them all through the day.
He recalled the stories he had read of the glaciers and avalanches,
and how Tim McCabe had referred to them as sometimes overtaking
travellers in this part of the world.</p>

<p>He knew what it meant, and, leaping from his couch, he shouted:</p>

<p>"Wake up! Quick! An avalanche is upon us!"</p>
