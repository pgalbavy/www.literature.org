<P>
He advanced a few steps, and stopped. Absorbed in herself, Anne
failed to hear him. She never moved.
<P>
"I have come, as you made a point of it," he said, sullenly.
"But, mind you, it isn't safe."
<P>
At the sound of his voice, Anne turned toward him. A change of
expression appeared in her face, as she slowly advanced from the
back of the summer-house, which revealed a likeness  to her moth
er, not perceivable at other times. As the mother had looked, in
by-gone days, at the man who had disowned her, so the daughter
looked at Geoffrey Delamayn--with the same terrible composure,
and the same terrible contempt.
<P>
"Well?" he asked. "What have you got to say to me?"
<P>
"Mr. Delamayn," she answered, "you are one of the fortunate
people of this world. You are a nobleman's son. You are a
handsome man. You are popular at your college. You are free of
the best houses in England. Are you something besides all this?
Are you a coward and a scoundrel as well?"
<P>
He started--opened his lips to speak--checked himself--and made
an uneasy attempt to laugh it off. "Come!" he said, "keep your
temper."
<P>
The suppressed passion in her began to force its way to the
surface.
<P>
"Keep my temper?" she repeated. "Do _you_ of all men expect me to
control myself? What a memory yours must be! Have you forgotten
the time when I was fool enough to think you were fond of me? and
mad enough to believe you could keep a promise?"
<P>
He persisted in trying to laugh it off. "Mad is a strongish word
to use, Miss Silvester!"
<P>
"Mad is the right word! I look back at my own infatuation--and I
can't account for it; I can't understand myself. What was there
in _you_," she asked, with an outbreak of contemptuous surprise,
"to attract such a woman as I am?"
<P>
His inexhaustible good-nature was proof even against this. He put
his hands in his pockets, and said, "I'm sure I don't know."
<P>
She turned away from him. The frank brutality of the answer had
not offended her. It forced her, cruelly forced her, to remember
that she had nobody but herself to blame for the position in
which she stood at that moment. She was unwilling to let him see
how the remembrance hurt her--that was all. A sad, sad story; but
it must be told. In her mother's time she had been the sweetest,
the most lovable of children. In later days, under the care of
her mother's friend, her girlhood had passed so harmlessly and so
happily--it seemed as if the sleeping passions might sleep
forever! She had lived on to the prime of her womanhood--and
then, when the treasure of her life was at its richest, in one
fatal moment she had flung it away on the man in whose presence
she now stood.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Was she without excuse? No: not utterly without excuse.
<P>
She had seen him under other aspects than the aspect which he
presented now. She had seen him, the hero of the river-race, the
first and foremost man in a trial of strength and skill which had
roused the enthusiasm of all England. She had seen him, the
central object of the interest of a nation; the idol of the
popular worship and the popular applause. _His_ were the arms
whose muscle was celebrated in the newspapers. _He_ was first
among the heroes hailed by ten thousand roaring throats as the
pride and flower of England. A woman, in an atmosphere of red-hot
enthusiasm, witnesses the apotheosis of Physical Strength. Is it
reasonable--is it just--to expect her to ask herself, in cold
blood, What (morally and intellectually) is all this worth?--and
that, when the man who is the object of the apotheosis, notices
her, is presented to her, finds her to his taste, and singles her
out from the rest? No. While humanity is humanity, the woman is
not utterly without excuse.
<P>
Has she escaped, without suffering for it?
<P>
Look at her as she stands there, tortured by the knowledge of her
own secret--the hideous secret which she is hiding from the
innocent girl, whom she loves with a sister's love. Look at her,
bowed down under a humiliation which is unutterable in words. She
has seen him below the surface--now, when it is too late. She
rates him at his true value--now, when her reputation is at his
mercy. Ask her the question: What was there to love in a man who
can speak to you as that man has spoken, who can treat you as
that man is treating you now? you so clever, so cultivated, so
refined--what, in Heaven's name, could _you_ see in him? Ask her
that, and she will have no answer to give. She will not even
remind you that he was once your model of manly beauty, too--that
you waved your handkerchief till you could wave it no longer,
when he took his seat, with the others, in the boat--that your
heart was like to jump out of your bosom, on that later occasion
when he leaped the last hurdle at the foot-race, and won it by a
head. In the bitterness of her remorse, she will not even seek
for _that_ excuse for herself. Is there no atoning suffering to
be seen here? Do your sympathies shrink from such a character as
this? Follow her, good friends of virtue, on the pilgrimage that
leads, by steep and thorny ways, to the purer atmosphere and the
nobler life. Your fellow-creature, who has sinned and has
repented--you have the authority of the Divine Teacher for it--is
your fellow-creature, purified and ennobled. A joy among the
angels of heaven--oh, my brothers and sisters of the earth, have
I not laid my hand on a fit companion for You?
<P>
<P>
<P>
There was a moment of silence in the summer-house. The cheerful
tumult of the lawn-party was pleasantly audible from the
distance. Outside, the hum of voices, the laughter of girls, the
thump of the croquet-mallet against the ball. Inside, nothing but
a woman forcing back the bitter tears of sorrow and shame--and a
man who was tired of her.
<P>
She roused herself. She was her mother's daughter; and she had a
spark of her mother's spirit. Her life depended on the issue of
that interview. It was useless--without father or brother to take
her part--to lose the last chance of appealing to him. She dashed
away the tears--time enough to cry, is time easily found in a
woman's existence--she dashed away the tears, and spoke to him
again, more gently than she had spoken yet.
<P>
"You have been three weeks, Geoffrey, at your brother Julius's
place, not ten miles from here; and you have never once ridden
over to see me. You would not have come to-day, if I had not
written to you to insist on it. Is that the treatment I have
deserved?"
<P>
She paused. There was no answer.
<P>
"Do you hear me?" she asked, advancing and speaking in louder
tones.
<P>
He was still silent. It was not in human endurance to bear his
contempt. The warning of a coming outbreak began to show itself
in her face. He met it, beforehand, with an impenetrable front.
Feeling nervous about the interview, while he was waiting in the
rose-garden--now that he stood committed to it, he was in full
possession of himself. He was composed enough to remember that he
had not put his pipe in its case--composed enough to set that
little matter right before other matters went any farther. He
took the case out of one pocket, and the pipe out of another.
<P>
"Go on," he said, quietly. "I hear you."
<P>
She struck the pipe out of his hand at a blow. If she had had the
strength she would have struck him down with it on the floor of
the summer-house.
<P>
"How dare you use me in this way?" she burst out, vehemently.
"Your conduct is infamous. Defend it if you can!"
<P>
He made no attempt to defend it. He looked, with an expression of
genuine anxiety, at the fallen pipe. It was beautifully
colored--it had cost him ten shillings. "I'll pick up my pipe
first," he said. His face brightened pleasantly--he looked
handsomer than ever--as he examined the precious object, and put
it back in the case. "All right," he said to himself. "She hasn't
broken it." His attitude as he looked at her again, was the
perfection of easy grace--the grace that attends on cultivated
strength in a state of repose. "I put it to your own
common-sense, " he said, in the most reasonable manner, "what's
the good of bullying me? You don't want them to hear you, out on
the lawn there--do you? You women are all alike. There's no
beating a little prudence into your heads, try how one may."
<P>
There he waited, expecting her to speak. She waited, on her side,
and forced him to go on.
<P>
"Look here," he said, "there's no need to quarrel, you know. I
don't want to break my promise; but what can I do ? I'm not the
eldest son. I'm dependent on my father for every farthing I have;
and I'm on bad terms with him already. Can't you see it yourself?
You're a lady, and all that, I know. But  you're only a governess.
It's your interest as well as mine to wait till my father has
provided for me. Here it is in a nut-shell: if I marry you now,
I'm a ruined man."
<P>
The answer came, this time.
<P>
"You villain if you _don't_ marry me, I am a ruined woman!"
<P>
"What do you mean?"
<P>
"You know what I mean. Don't look at me in that way."
<P>
"How do you expect me to look at a woman who calls me a villain
to my face?"
<P>
She suddenly changed her tone. The savage element in
humanity--let the modern optimists who doubt its existence look
at any uncultivated man (no matter how muscular), woman (no
matter how beautiful), or child (no matter how young)--began to
show itself furtively in his eyes, to utter itself furtively in
his voice. Was he to blame for the manner in which he looked at
her and spoke to her? Not he! What had there been in the training
of _his_ life (at school or at college) to soften and subdue the
savage element in him? About as much as there had been in the
training of his ancestors (without the school or the college)
five hundred years since.
<P>
It was plain that one of them must give way. The woman had the
most at stake--and the woman set the example of submission.
<P>
"Don't be hard on me," she pleaded. "I don't mean to be hard on
_you._ My temper gets the better of me. You know my temper. I am
sorry I forgot myself. Geoffrey, my whole future is in your
hands. Will you do me justice?"
<P>
She came nearer, and laid her hand persuasively on his arm.
<P>
"Haven't you a word to say to me? No answer? Not even a look?"
She waited a moment more. A marked change came over her. She
turned slowly to leave the summer-house. "I am sorry to have
troubled you, Mr. Delamayn. I won't detain you any longer."
<P>
He looked at her. There was a tone in her voice that he had never
heard before. There was a light in her eyes that he had never
seen in them before. Suddenly and fiercely he reached out his
hand, and stopped her.
<P>
"Where are you going?" he asked.
<P>
She answered, looking him straight in the face, "Where many a
miserable woman has gone before me. Out of the world."
<P>
He drew her nearer to him, and eyed her closely. Even _his_
intelligence discovered that he had brought her to bay, and that
she really meant it!
<P>
"Do you mean you will destroy yourself?" he said.
<P>
"Yes. I mean I will destroy myself."
<P>
He dropped her arm. "By Jupiter, she _does_ mean it!"
<P>
With that conviction in him, he pushed one of the chairs in the
summer-house to her with his foot, and signed to her to take it.
"Sit down!" he said, roughly. She had frightened him--and fear
comes seldom to men of his type. They feel it, when it does come,
with an angry distrust; they grow loud and brutal, in instinctive
protest against it. "Sit down!" he repeated. She obeyed him.
"Haven't you got a word to say to me?" he asked, with an oath.
No! there she sat, immovable, reckless how it ended--as only
women can be, when women's minds are made up. He took a turn in
the summer-house and came back, and struck his hand angrily on
the rail of her chair. "What do you want?"
<P>
"You know what I want."
<P>
He took another turn. There was nothing for it but to give way on
his side, or run the risk of something happening which might
cause an awkward scandal, and come to his father's ears.
<P>
"Look here, Anne," he began, abruptly. "I have got something to
propose."
<P>
She looked up at him.
<P>
"What do you say to a private marriage?"
<P>
Without asking a single question, without making objections, she
answered him, speaking as bluntly as he had spoken himself:
<P>
"I consent to a private marriage."
<P>
He began to temporize directly.
<P>
"I own I don't see how it's to be managed--"
<P>
She stopped him there.
<P>
"I do!"
<P>
"What!" he cried out, suspiciously. "You have thought of it
yourself, have you?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"And planned for it?"
<P>
"And planned for it!"
<P>
"Why didn't you tell me so before?"
<P>
She answered haughtily; insisting on the respect which is due to
women--the respect which was doubly due from _him,_ in her
position.
<P>
"Because _you_ owed it to _me,_ Sir, to speak first."
<P>
"Very well. I've spoken first. Will you wait a little?"
<P>
"Not a day!"
<P>
The tone was positive. There was no mistaking it. Her mind was
made up.
<P>
"Where's the hurry?"
<P>
"Have you eyes?" she asked, vehemently. "Have you ears? Do you
see how Lady Lundie looks at me? Do you hear how Lady Lundie
speaks to me? I am suspected by that woman. My shameful dismissal
from this house may be a question of a few hours." Her head sunk
on her bosom; she wrung her clasped hands as they rested on her
lap. "And, oh, Blanche!" she moaned to herself, the tears
gathering again, and falling, this time, unchecked. "Blanche, who
looks up to me! Blanche, who loves me! Blanche, who told me, in
this very place, that I was to live with her when she was
married!" She started up from the chair; the tears dried
suddenly; the hard despair settled again, wan and white, on her
face. "Let me go! What is death, compared to such a life as is
waiting for _me?_" She looked him over, in one disdainful glance
from head to foot; her voice rose to its loudest and firmest
tones." Why, even _you_; would have the courage to die if you
were in my place!"
<P>
Geoffrey glanced round toward the lawn.
<P>
"Hush!" he said. "They will hear you!"
<P>
"Let them hear me! When _I_ am past hearing _them_, what does it
matter?"
<P>
He put her back by main force on the chair. In another moment
they must have heard her, through all the noise and laughter of
the game.
<P>
"Say what you want," he resumed, "and I'll do it. Only be
reasonable. I can't marry you to-day."
<P>
"You can!"
<P>
"What nonsense you talk! The house and grounds are swarming with
company. It can't be!"
<P>
"It can! I have been thinking about it ever since we came to this
house. I have got something to propose to you. Will you hear it,
or not?"
<P>
"Speak lower!"
<P>
"Will you hear it, or not?"
<P>
"There's somebody coming!"
<P>
"Will you hear it, or not?"
<P>
"The devil take your obstinacy! Yes!"
<P>
The answer had been wrung from him. Still, it was the answer she
wanted--it opened the door to hope. The instant he had consented
to hear her her mind awakened to the serious necessity of
averting discovery by any third person who might stray idly into
the summer-house. She held up her hand for silence, and listened
to what was going forward on the lawn.
<P>
The dull thump of the croquet-mallet against the ball was no
longer to be heard. The game had stopped.
<P>
In a moment more she heard her own name called. An interval of
another instant passed, and a familiar voice said, "I know where
she is. I'll fetch her."
<P>
She turned to Geoffrey, and pointed to the back of the
summer-house.
<P>
"It's my turn to play," she said. "And Blanche is coming here to
look for me. Wait there, and I'll stop her on the steps."
<P>
She went out at once. It was a critical moment. Discovery, which
meant moral-ruin to the woman, meant money-ruin to the man.
Geoffrey had not exaggerated his position with his father. Lord
Holchester had twice paid his debts, and had declined to see him
since. One more outrage on his father's rigid sense of propriety,
and he would be left out of the will as well as kept out of the
house. He looked for a means of retreat, in case there was no
escaping unperceived by the front entrance. A door--intended for
the use of servants, when picnics and gipsy tea-parties were
given in the summer-house--had been made in the back wall. It
opened outward, and it was locked. With his strength it was easy
to remove that obstacle. He put his shoulder to the door. At the
moment when he burst it open he felt a hand on his arm. Anne was
behind him, alone.
<P>
"You may want it before long," she said, observing the open door,
without expressing any surprise, "You don't want it now. Another
person will play for me--I have told Blanche I am not well. Sit
down. I have secured a respite of five minutes, and I must make
the most of it. In that time, or less, Lady Lundie's suspicions
will bring her here--to see how I am. For the present, shut the
door."
<P>
She seated herself, and pointed to a second chair. He took
it--with his eye on the closed door.
<P>
"Come to the point!" he said, impatiently. "What is it?"
<P>
"You can marry me privately to-day," she answered. "Lis ten--and
I will tell you how!"
