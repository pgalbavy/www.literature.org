<p>There could be no denying that extraordinary fortune had attended
the boys, but they were too prudent to count on a continuance
of what might be called the run of good luck, except by the utmost
circumspection on their part.</p>

<p>They were together once more, with their guns, ammunition and
accoutrements intact, and without either having suffered any harm.
Nothing would have been easier for them than to cross the ravine
by the fallen tree, which had answered for a foot-bridge more
than once that evening, and in doing so it was not probable that
they would have run greater risk than they had repeatedly incurred
during the preceding few hours; but the necessity for such risk
did not exist, and consequently they did not take it. Wharton
suspected the truth. The Shawanoes, knowing that the lads, or
at least one of them, was in the vicinity, were in ambush along
the trail, with the expectation that they would walk into the
trap, which is exactly what they would have done had they taken
the path opposite to where they were standing while holding their
conversation.</p>

<p>The evident and simple course for them to follow was to make
a detour, by which they would return to the trail at a point beyond
where the red men were awaiting them.</p>

<p>This was more difficult than would be supposed, for the route
to the block-house was a winding one, and they were unacquainted
with that portion of the country through which they would have
to make their way. They might lose themselves altogether, though
both were too good woodsmen not to eventually reach their destination.</p>

<p>But having decided on what to do, they wasted no time. Their
purpose was to cross the stream above where they had met, and
Wharton picked his way steadily through the wood, with Larry at
his heels. Conversation was dangerous, and none for a time was
had, since there was no call for it.</p>

<p>The roughness of the ground gave them trouble from the first.
They were forced to turn aside repeatedly and flank bowlders,
rocks, and wild, broken ravines, into which they would have fallen
but for the alertness of Wharton, who maintained his place a few
paces in advance.</p>

<p>This course compelled them frequently to edge away from the stream,
which still swept between such a high wall of rocks that it was
impassable, but they never lost it altogether. By listening carefully
they could locate it, and at intervals they made their way to
the margin, to learn whether the spot for which they were looking
was within sight.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!"</p>

<p>It was Wharton Edwards who uttered the exclamation, and his companion
pushed his way to his side to learn the cause of his excitement.
As he did so, he saw they were standing on the edge of a ravine
which obtruded itself at right angles to the course they were
pursuing.</p>

<p>But for the fact that it contained no water, they would have
believed that it was the gorge through which ran the stream. But
it was empty, and in the shadows neither could see to the bottom
of its gloomy depths. The trees grew so near the margin that the
opposite side was indistinct.</p>

<p>"I didn't expect to meet anything like this," added Wharton,
with a sigh of disappointment; "it means trouble."</p>

<p>"You can't tell till ye find out," was the somewhat superfluous
remark of Larry. "It may not run very far to the right or left,
and we've had so much experience in walking around things that
this won't make much difference one way or t'other."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we'll get so mixed up that we won't be able to find
our way from it now."</p>

<p>"It may be a lucky thing&mdash;maybe the same."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Who can say where they are waiting for us? It may be five or
ten miles away, or it may be within sight of the block-house.
We can get there without setting foot in the trail agin."</p>

<p>"You may be partly right, Larry, though if we can strike the
path five miles away from the falls, I won't be afraid to keep
it until we reach the block-house. The risk beyond that isn't
any greater than what we have always had to run from the time
we leave the settlement till we get back again."</p>

<p>"It strikes me we are not gaining much time by standing here
discussing the question."</p>

<p>As Larry spoke he turned to the left and moved off.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" interrupted his companion; "that will take us farther
away than ever, and may lead us so far that we'll lose the stream
altogether."</p>

<p>By going to the right they approached the current that had to
be passed before they could recover the trail. Perhaps a passable
spot was at hand, and the means of crossing the smaller ravine
was as likely to be on one hand as the other.</p>

<p>With the same pains and labor as before they reached the stream,
where they found themselves confronted by a peculiar condition
of affairs. The banks were somewhat farther apart, but they remained
perpendicular rocks fully twenty feet in height, between which
the torrent flowed so impetuously that they would have been as
helpless as a balloon in a gale of wind. The crossing-place was
still to be sought farther up the stream.</p>

<p>But to reach it they must place themselves on the farther side
of the smaller ravine, which crossed their course at right angles.
This opened directly into the current, with whose surface it was
nearly even. In times of freshet or flood the dry ravine was probably
a tributary torrent of the other. At present it looked impassable,
but after studying it a few moments Wharton said:</p>

<p>"I believe, Larry, we can both jump that. What do you think?"</p>

<p>"I won't know for sartin till I try it; then I'll know, sure."</p>

<p>"So will we both; but the distance is less than where I made
the leap."</p>

<p>"So it will have to be if it's mesilf that's to sail across."</p>

<p>The conformation of the dry ravine near the stream allowed them
to see the other side. Wharton measured the width with his eye,
and then, without a word, drew back a single step, and with little
effort landed lightly on the opposite side.</p>

<p>"What do you think of that, Larry?"</p>

<p>"It isn't much for yersilf, but I would be proud of the same."</p>

<p>"I'm sure there will be no trouble. There is room for you to
get a couple of yards start, and I wouldn't advise you to try
it if I wasn't sure you would succeed."</p>

<p>Young Murphy was plucky, but he surveyed the task before him
with some misgiving. With a depth of about twenty feet, and nothing
but rock at the bottom, a failure to land on the other side meant
death or serious injury.</p>

<p>He stood on the edge, and spent a minute or two peering down
into the gloomy depths. Then he looked across at his friend, who
cheered him on.</p>

<p>"I'll thry it," he said, resolutely, and with a shake of his
head.</p>

<p>"Fling over your gun to me; it will be easier for you to make
the jump without that than with it."</p>

<p>Larry tossed the rifle to his friend, who deftly caught the weapon.
Then, with the grim comicality of his nature, he threw his cap
after it.</p>

<p>"If I do make a tumble of it, I should like ye to preserve that
as a token of remembrance."</p>

<p>He now braced himself for the effort. With all his strength,
he could not compare with his friend in speed and rapidity. The
leap, however, was only a moderate one, and Wharton was confident
he would make it if no mishap intervened.</p>

<p>And, beyond question, he would have done so had no interference
taken place. He carefully backed a rod or so from the edge of
the dry ravine.</p>

<p>Everything was going on well, but almost on the edge he stepped
on a small pebble, unnoticed by the eye. The effect was slight,
and a spectator would hardly have seen it, but, all the same,
it was just enough to disarrange his stride, so that when the
leap, which he was forced to make, took place, it was faulty.
He lost the impetus that otherwise would have landed him on his
feet on the other side with hardly a jar to his body.</p>

<p>"I can't do it! I can't do it, Whart!" called the leaper at the
moment of bounding into the air, for he could not fail to know
that he was about to fall short.</p>

<p>The waiting friend said nothing, but braced himself for the shock,
for he, too, knew what was coming.</p>

<p>Larry barely missed landing, but his hands were thrown forward
where his feet should have struck, and had he received no help
he would have gone backward and down the ravine.</p>

<p>But it was for this that Wharton Edwards had prepared himself.
Each hand of Larry was grasped by his own, and he almost lay on
his back as he tugged to draw him out of the gorge and up on the
solid support above.</p>

<p>Had not Wharton dug his heels into a projection, he would have
had to let go or be drawn downward with his friend, who could
not help drawing tremendously on him. Larry, however, gave great
aid by throwing one foot on top of the rock, and using that limb
as a lever with which to lift his body the rest of the short distance.
This so lessened the task that the next minute the danger was
over, and the two stood beside each other.</p>
