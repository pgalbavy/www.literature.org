<p>A BELT of rhododendrons grew close down to one side of our pond; and
along the edge of it many things flourished rankly. If you crept
through the undergrowth and crouched by the water’s rim, it was easy—if
your imagination were in healthy working order—to transport yourself
in a trice to the heart of a tropical forest. Overhead the monkeys
chattered, parrots flashed from bough to bough, strange large blossoms
shone all round you, and the push and rustle of great beasts moving
unseen thrilled you deliciously. And if you lay down with your nose
an inch or two from the water, it was not long ere the old sense of
proportion vanished clean away. The glittering insects that darted to
and fro on its surface became sea-monsters dire, the gnats that hung
above them swelled to albatrosses, and the pond itself stretched out
into a vast inland sea, whereon a navy might ride secure, and whence at
any moment the hairy scalp of a sea-serpent might be seen to emerge.
</p><p>It is impossible, however, to play at tropical forests properly, when
homely accents of the human voice intrude; and all my hopes of seeing
a tiger seized by a crocodile while drinking (<u>vide</u> picture-books,
<u>passim</u>) vanished abruptly, and earth resumed her old dimensions,
when the sound of Charlotte’s prattle somewhere hard by broke in on my
primæval seclusion. Looking out from the bushes, I saw her trotting
towards an open space of lawn the other side the pond, chattering to
herself in her accustomed fashion, a doll tucked under either arm,
and her brow knit with care. Propping up her double burthen against a
friendly stump, she sat down in front of them, as full of worry and
anxiety as a Chancellor on a Budget night.
</p><p>Her victims, who stared resignedly in front of them, were recognisable
as Jerry and Rosa. Jerry hailed from far Japan: his hair was straight
and black, his one garment cotton of a simple blue; and his reputation
was distinctly bad. Jerome was his proper name, from his supposed
likeness to the holy man who hung in a print on the staircase; though
a shaven crown was the only thing in common ’twixt Western saint and
Eastern sinner. Rosa was typical British, from her flaxen poll to the
stout calves she displayed so liberally; and in character she was of
the blameless order of those who have not yet been found out.
</p><p>I suspected Jerry from the first. There was a latent devilry in his
slant eyes as he sat there moodily; and knowing what he was capable of,
I scented trouble in store for Charlotte. Rosa I was not so sure about;
she sat demurely and upright, and looked far away into the tree-tops in
a visionary, world-forgetting sort of way; yet the prim purse of her
mouth was somewhat overdone, and her eyes glittered unnaturally.
</p><p>‘Now, I’m going to begin where I left off,’ said Charlotte, regardless
of stops, and thumping the turf with her fist excitedly: ‘and you must
pay attention, ’cos this is a treat, to have a story told you before
you’re put to bed. Well, so the White Rabbit scuttled off down the
passage and Alice hoped he’d come back ’cos he had a waistcoat on and
her flamingo flew up a tree—but we haven’t got to that part yet, you
must wait a minute, and—where had I got to?’
</p><p>[Illustration: “‘NOW WE’LL GO ON,’ BEGAN CHARLOTTE ONCE MORE”]
</p><p>Jerry only remained passive until Charlotte had got well under way, and
then began to heel over quietly in Rosa’s direction. His head fell on
her plump shoulder, causing her to start nervously.
</p><p>Charlotte seized and shook him with vigour. ‘O Jerry,’ she cried
piteously, ‘if you’re not going to be good, how ever shall I tell you
my story?’
</p><p>Jerry’s face was injured innocence itself. ‘Blame if you like, Madam,’
he seemed to say, ‘the eternal laws of gravitation, but not a helpless
puppet, who is also an orphan and a stranger in the land.’
</p><p>‘Now we’ll go on,’ began Charlotte once more. ‘So she got into the
garden at last—I’ve left out a lot but you won’t care, I’ll tell you
some other time—and they were all playing croquet, and that’s where the
flamingo comes in, and the Queen shouted out, “Off with her head!”’
</p><p>At this point Jerry collapsed forward, suddenly and completely, his
bald pate between his knees. Charlotte was not very angry this time.
The sudden development of tragedy in the story had evidently been too
much for the poor fellow. She straightened him out, wiped his nose,
and, after trying him in various positions, to which he refused to
adapt himself, she propped him against the shoulder of the (apparently)
unconscious Rosa. Then my eyes were opened, and the full measure of
Jerry’s infamy became apparent. This, then, was what he had been
playing up for! The rascal had designs, had he? I resolved to keep him
under close observation.
</p><p>‘If you’d been in the garden,’ went on Charlotte reproachfully, ‘and
flopped down like that when the Queen said “Off with his head!” she’d
have offed with your head; but Alice wasn’t that sort of girl at all.
She just said, “I’m not afraid of you, you’re nothing but a pack of
cards”—O dear! I’ve got to the end already, and I hadn’t begun hardly!
I never can make my stories last out! Never mind, I’ll tell you another
one.’
</p><p>Jerry didn’t seem to care, now he had gained his end, whether the
stories lasted out or not. He was nestling against Rosa’s plump form
with a look of satisfaction that was simply idiotic; and one arm had
disappeared from view—was it round her waist? Rosa’s natural blush
seemed deeper than usual, her head inclined shyly—it must have been
round her waist.
</p><p>‘If it wasn’t so near your bedtime,’ continued Charlotte reflectively,
‘I’d tell you a nice story with a bogy in it. But you’d be frightened,
and you’d dream of bogies all night. So I’ll tell you one about a White
Bear, only you mustn’t scream when the bear says ‘Wow,’ like I used to,
’cos he’s a good bear really——’
</p><p>Here Rosa fell flat on her back in the deadest of faints. Her limbs
were rigid, her eyes glassy. What had Jerry been doing? It must have
been something very bad, for her to take on like that. I scrutinised
him carefully, while Charlotte ran to comfort the damsel. He appeared
to be whistling a tune and regarding the scenery. If I only possessed
Jerry’s command of feature, I thought to myself, half regretfully, I
would never be found out in anything.
</p><p>‘It’s all your fault, Jerry,’ said Charlotte reproachfully, when the
lady had been restored to consciousness: ‘Rosa’s as good as gold except
when you make her wicked. I’d put you in the corner, only a stump
hasn’t got a corner—wonder why that is? Thought everything had corners.
Never mind, you’ll have to sit with your face to the wall—<u>so</u>. Now you
can sulk if you like!’
</p><p>Jerry seemed to hesitate a moment between the bliss of indulgence in
sulks with a sense of injury, and the imperious summons of beauty
waiting to be wooed at his elbow; then, overmastered by his passion, he
fell sideways across Rosa’s lap. One arm stuck stiffly upwards, as in
passionate protestation; his amorous countenance was full of entreaty.
Rosa hesitated—wavered—yielded, crushing his slight frame under the
weight of her full-bodied surrender.
</p><p>Charlotte had stood a good deal, but it was possible to abuse even her
patience. Snatching Jerry from his lawless embraces, she reversed him
across her knee, and then—the outrage offered to the whole superior
sex in Jerry’s hapless person was too painful to witness; but though
I turned my head away the sound of brisk slaps continued to reach my
tingling ears. When I dared to look again, Jerry was sitting up as
before; his garment, somewhat crumpled, was restored to its original
position; but his pallid countenance was set hard. Knowing as I did,
only too well, what a volcano of passion and shame must be seething
under that impassive exterior, for the moment I felt sorry for him.
</p><p>Rosa’s face was still buried in her frock; it might have been shame, it
might have been grief for Jerry’s sufferings. But the callous Japanese
never even looked her way. His heart was exceeding bitter within him.
In merely following up his natural impulses he had run his head against
convention, and learned how hard a thing it was; and the sunshiny world
was all black to him. Even Charlotte softened somewhat at the sight of
his rigid misery. ‘If you’ll say you’re sorry, Jerome,’ she said, ‘I’ll
say I’m sorry, too.’
</p><p>Jerry only dropped his shoulders against the stump and stared out in
the direction of his dear native Japan, where love was no sin, and
smacking had not been introduced. Why had he ever left it? He would
go back to-morrow! And yet there were obstacles: another grievance.
Nature, in endowing Jerry with every grace of form and feature, along
with a sensitive soul, had somehow forgotten the gift of locomotion.
</p><p>There was a crackling in the bushes behind me, with sharp short pants
as of a small steam-engine, and Rollo, the black retriever, just
released from his chain by some friendly hand, burst through the
underwood, seeking congenial company. I joyfully hailed him to stop and
be a panther, but he sped away round the pond, upset Charlotte with a
boisterous caress, and seizing Jerry by the middle, disappeared with
him down the drive. Charlotte panting, raved behind the swift-footed
avenger of crime; Rosa lay dishevelled, bereft of consciousness; Jerry
himself spread helpless arms to heaven, and I almost thought I heard a
cry for mercy, a tardy promise of amendment. But it was too late. The
Black Man had got Jerry at last; and though the tear of sensibility
might bedew an eye or two for his lost sake, no one who really knew him
could deny the justice of his fate.
