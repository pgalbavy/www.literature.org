<p>It was the qualification in the Instructor’s remark, "when the
sun is shining," that gave the quick-witted Mike his clue.</p>

<p>"My first plan was to climb to the top," said he with that gravity
which he knew so well how to assume, "but I feared I should tumble
before I could complete the measuring of the same, as me mither’s
second cousin did whin he tried to climb the lightning rod of
the church backward. Obsarve me."</p>

<p>Every eye was fixed upon the Irish youth who, while speaking,
had been scrutinizing his surroundings. The pine towered fully
twenty feet above any of its near neighbors. The wood was so open
that the shadow of the top fell athwart a small natural clearing
to the westward. Mike walked to the conical patch of shade, stood
on its farthest edge, and facing the puzzled spectators, crooked
his finger.</p>

<p>"Have one of ye sich a thing as a measuring tape in yer pockets?"</p>

<p>The majority carried the useful article, coiled around a spring
in a flat, circular metal box. Three boys started on a trot toward
Mike, but Kenneth Mitchell out-sped his companions.</p>

<p>"Now, if ye’ll measure the precise distance from the tip of me
shoe to the fut of the pine, ye’ll have the satisfaction of doing
a good turn for the rest of the byes, as me dad did whin he fixed
things so that six men instead of two had a share in the shindy
at Tipperary on his birthday."</p>

<p>While Kenneth was carefully stretching the tape over the ground
in a straight line to the base of the pine, a couple of the boys
smiled, for they had caught on to the ingenious scheme of Mike.
The yellow tape was a dozen feet long and divided as usual into
fractions of an inch. When the owner after using the full length
several times grasped it part way between the ends with his thumb
and forefinger, so that they touched the bark near the ground,
he straightened up and made a quick mental calculation.</p>

<p>"How fur are we apart?" asked Mike from his first position.</p>

<p>"Sixty-two feet, eight inches," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Come hither and while me young friend is doing the same, the
rist of ye may get your pencils and bits of paper riddy."</p>

<p>When Kenneth reached the master of ceremonies, he was standing
in the oasis of sunlight. Resting one end of the buckthorn cane
which he carried on the ground, he held the stick exactly vertical.</p>

<p>"Will ye oblige me by measuring the shadow of the same?"</p>

<p>It was done in a twinkling.</p>

<p>"It is one foot, one inch."</p>

<p>By this time every one of the smiling scouts understood the simple
method by which Mike proposed to solve the problem. He called
to them:</p>

<p>"The length of me shillalah is three feet, two inches; the length
of its shadow is one foot, one inch; the length of the shadow
of the pine is sixty-two feet, eight inches: what more can ye
ask of me?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Scout Master Hall, "figure it out, boys."</p>

<p>This is the "statement" which the lads jotted down in their note
books or on pieces of paper:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Length of         Length          Length of     Height<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cane’s shadow      of cane        pine’s shadow   of pine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 foot, 1 inch 3 feet, 2 inches 62 feet, 8 inches    ?

</p>
</div>
<p>The fractional ratios made considerable computation necessary,
and several boys erred in their work, but when nine of them reached
the same result, and a comparison proved their accuracy, there
could be no question as to the correctness of the result, which
was that the height of the noble pine was more than one hundred
and eighty feet. (Figure out the exact number of feet and inches
for yourself.)</p>

<p>"You did well," said the pleased Instructor to Mike, who made
a quick salute and gravely remarked to the scouts:</p>

<p>"Don’t be worrying, byes; I’ll recognize ye the same as before."</p>

<p>At a nod and wink from Patrol Leader Chase, the whole troop lined
up in front of the astonished Mike and silently made the regulation
salute. So far as it was possible to do so, his red face blushed
and for the first time the waggish youth showed slight embarrassment,
but he was instant to rally.</p>

<p>"Comrade," said Colgate Craig, "you can tuck in the end of your
necktie."</p>

<p>"And why should I do the same?"</p>

<p>"You have done your good turn for today."</p>

<p>"I’ll let me banner wave on the outside, for who shall say how
many more good turns I shall have to do ye before night?"</p>

<p>"There may be more truth in that remark then he suspects," remarked
Uncle Elk, who now gave the word to push on to his home, still
fully a mile away. The Instructor kept pace with the scouts, walking
a little to their right, while the Scout Master did the same on
the left of the laughing, chattering, straggling party. All, however,
made good use of their eyes and nothing worth seeing escaped them.
It must be remembered that a goodly number of the boys lived in
the country and had a more or less knowledge of the woods in the
neighborhood of their own homes. Moreover, there is no marked
difference between most of the trees in their neighborhood and
those of Maine. Thus, a superb black walnut, nearly as tall as
the giant pine, was identified at a glance by several of the youths,
and Ernest Oberlander told of its hard, close-grained wood, dark,
purplish gray in color and very durable; and of its fruit, two
inches round, the stain from whose green husks has a way of sticking
to one’s hands until sandpaper and soap are necessary to remove
it.</p>

<p>Every one was familiar with the white walnut or butternut. Its
height is generally about half that of the walnut, its bark is
smoother and its leaves similar in shape, but larger and coarser.
Its leaflet stalks and new twigs are covered with a sticky brown
substance. The leaves are very long, though the leaflets are less
than six inches in length.</p>

<p>"You know the delicious, oblong fruit with its prickly shell,"
said the Instructor; "when you lay the nut on its side to break
it open——"</p>

<p>"No, you don’t," interrupted Corporal Robe, quick to detect the
little subterfuge of Uncle Elk to draw them out: "that isn’t the
right way to crack a butternut."</p>

<p>"It isn’t!" repeated the old gentleman, in pretended surprise;
"will you be good enough to explain the proper method?"</p>

<p>"I don’t think there is much need of explaining, for every fellow
knows or ought to know that you should stand the nut on one end
and strike the top."</p>

<p>"What advantage do you gain by that plan?"</p>

<p>"The meat is not broken,—that is if you are careful. I have often
cracked a butternut so that the meat came out without a break."</p>

<p>"I like the butternut more than the walnut," remarked Alvin Landon.</p>

<p>"So do I, but it has another use than to serve as food or a luxury.
Of course you can tell me what that is."</p>

<p>He looked into the expectant faces, but no one could answer him.</p>

<p>"The oil is, or once was, very popular with jewelers. I remember
that my father would squeeze out a drop, which was sufficient
to lubricate all the works of the family clock. He applied the
oil with a tiny feather and never needed more than the single
drop. The jewelers have a refined fluid which serves their purposes,
but father would never admit that any oil equaled that of the
butternut. It has always been one of my favorites, much more so
than that small tree growing in that dry sandy soil, which we
call—what?"</p>

<p>Considerable discussion took place before the Instructor accepted
the name and description of the common or aspen-leaved birch,
whose wood is soft, close grained, weak, splits in drying and
is valueless for weather and ground work. Each armpit has a black,
triangular scar, which does not appear in the canoe birch.</p>

<p>Uncle Elk gave the boys a brief talk on the genus of trees known
as the <em>Betulaceœ</em> or birch.</p>

<p>"Its flowers grow in catkins—so called from their resemblance
to a cat’s tail—whose scales are thin and three-lobed. With one
exception the species grows beyond the tropic in the northern
hemisphere."</p>

<p>"Will you tell us something about the birch from which canoes
are made?" asked Scout Master Hall, and the faces of the boys
showed their eagerness to hear the explanation which they knew
awaited them.</p>

<p>"The paper or canoe birch is the most valuable American kind.
Cabinet makers sometimes use the wood, but it quickly decays when
exposed to climatic changes. It sounds strange, but the bark is
most esteemed because of its durable nature. Many times I have
come upon a fallen birch which appeared to be perfectly sound,
but on examination, I found the wood entirely rotted away, with
the bark as firm and perfect as when the tree stood erect and
was growing. You can easily see why it is so valuable for canoes.
Would you like me to tell you how we make a birch canoe?"</p>

<p>Every head nodded.</p>

<p>"Of course I pick out the largest trees with the smoothest bark.
In the spring I make two circular incisions several feet apart,
with a longitudinal incision on each side. Pushing a wedge under
the bark, it is easily lifted off. With threads prepared from
the fibrous roots of the white spruce fir, the pieces of bark
are sewn together over a framework of wood, and the seams are
caulked with resin of the Balm of Gilead fir. Such boats are so
light that they are readily carried over the shoulders of a boy
when he finds it necessary to make a portage. My canoe weighs
less than fifty pounds and will bear up four or five boys."</p>

<p>"I obsarved, Uncle Elk," said Mike, who was one of the most interested
of the listeners, "that ye have no seats in yer boat, which the
same I fail to understand, as Jerry Hooligan said whin his taicher
told him that if ye multiply one fraction by anither, the answer
is less than aither of ’em."</p>

<p>"A birch canoe has no seat because the craft is so unstable it
is almost certain to tip over with you; you have to sit as low
as possible. The birch not only serves well for canoes, but log
houses are often thatched with it, and small boxes, cases and
even hats are manufactured from the same material. You are all
fond of sweet birch and I can see you chewing the tender, aromatic
bark, when you were barefooted boys on your way home from school.</p>

<p>"The canoe is so unstable and sensitive that care is necessary
to avoid accidents. In the first place there is the right and
wrong way to enter it, with the probability that you will take
the wrong one every time. This is what you should do: take the
paddle in your right hand and lay it across the gunwale. Seize
the outside gunwale with your left hand, resting the right on
the other gunwale. Then put your left foot gently but steadily
into the boat, being careful to place it exactly in the middle
and follow with the other foot, after which you will kneel or
sit as you prefer and can push away from the float. By this method
you will preserve the equilibrium of the canoe and escape mishap.</p>

<p>"By the way, you should never let the paddle pass out of your
grasp, for in case of an upset, it will keep you afloat until
help arrives. Nor should you go far without an extra paddle in
case of breakage. If you have a lady companion, regard safety
before grace. Grasp the nearest gunwale with your left hand, reach
up your right and take her nearest hand. She should step in right
foot first, grasping the outside gunwale to balance herself. Thus
steadied, she can easily lift the left foot into the boat and
sit down comfortably, using her right hand to arrange her skirts.</p>

<p>"You should sit near the middle when alone, for, if too far toward
the stern, the prow lifts up, and a puff of wind is sufficient
to tip over the boat. If an upset occurs, don’t forget to keep
a firm grasp upon your paddle, and don’t swim away from the overturned
canoe. One of the craft seldom overturns completely, because you
are pretty sure to plunge overboard so suddenly that the boat
hasn’t time to take in much water. It is easy to climb in again,
provided you know how to do it. Lay your paddle across the gunwale,
your left hand grasping the paddle and middle brace; bring your
legs sharply together as you do when climbing aboard a raft. This
will lift the body far enough out the water to enable you to reach
for the farther gunwale and you can roll yourself into the boat
with no trouble at all.</p>

<p>"Suppose you fall overboard with a companion. Remember the canoe
will not sink of itself and each of you has retained his paddle.
You approach from opposite directions, and one holds down his
side of the canoe, while the other carefully climbs in, after
which he can readily preserve the equilibrium while his friend
joins him.</p>

<p>"Remember these precautions: never change places in a canoe after
leaving the shore, and avoid moving quickly. It is the easiest
thing in the world to grasp a pond lily in passing and by means
of the sudden pull overturn the craft; don’t even turn your head
suddenly to look at another canoe that is passing; don’t frolic
or try to stand up in the canoe, and in no case take out a lady
without having a cork-stuffed pillow with you. Finally, no person
should ever have anything to do with a canoe until he has learned
how to swim."</p>

<p>"What kind of birch produces the most valuable timber?" asked
Scout Master Hall.</p>

<p>"The black or mahogany. Its reddish brown wood is hard and close-grained.
When it attains the height of seventy feet, with a diameter of
three feet, it is one of the handsomest trees in the forest. It
buds early in spring, at which time its leaves are covered with
a short thick coat of down, which disappears later in the season
and leaves them of a vivid green color."</p>

<p>A little way ahead, the Instructor halted the scouts again. This
time it was no pretence on his part when he expressed himself
as surprised by what he saw. He stood for a minute or two viewing
a tree some thirty feet high, with a score of green prickly burrs
scattered here and there among the branches.</p>

<p>"Why are you surprised?" asked the Scout Master.</p>

<p>"Maine lies above the range of the chestnut, though now and then
you come upon a specimen in the southern part of the state. That
is the first one I have seen in this section and I doubt if another
exists. I should be glad to welcome this tree, did I not know
that it is already doomed. We have plenty of horse chestnuts,
however."</p>

<p>"The chestnuts in the Middle States have suffered a good deal
during the last few years," said the Scout Master. "I had a couple
of fine ones in my yard at home but some pest attacked them. I
called in a tree surgeon, after doing all I could to save them,
and he confessed that he was powerless. The disease first appeared
in the neighborhood of New York in 1904. Two years later a hitherto
unknown fungus was discovered growing in the substance of the
bark of the tree, and it looks to me as if the blight will follow
the chestnuts all the way to Tennessee, which is their southern
range. Even your horse chestnuts do not escape and the all-pervading
spruce is threatened with extinction from a vicious moth."</p>

<p>"That’s too bad," commented more than one boy, who recalled the
delights of chestnut hunting and the delicious flavor of the fruit
itself, both raw and roasted; "we used to have such big crops
of chestnuts that it didn’t pay the farmers to gather them."</p>

<p>"As plants, flowers and trees increase, so do their enemies,"
commented Uncle Elk, "until it has become a constant fight for
life. But man will always be the victor so long as he does not
grow lazy or indifferent. Now we come upon several specimens of
the white and the red oak. Will one of you point out the chief
differences between them?"</p>

<p>Alvin Landon nudged Mike, who saw that the eyes of the Instructor
were fixed upon him.</p>

<p>"You know the two colors; he is expecting you to answer."</p>

<p>Mike promptly fell into the trap.</p>

<p>"One of ’em has red leaves and the ither white."</p>

<p>The reproving look of Mike in response to the general merriment
caused even Uncle Elk and Scout Master Hall to laugh. Kenneth
Henke and Bobby Snow between them explained that the grain of
the red oak is hard, strong and coarse but warps and has little
value for weather or ground work. Its acorns require two seasons
to ripen, whereas those of the white oak mature in one season.
The latter is called white because of the pale color of its bark
and wood. This kind is fine-grained, heavy, strong, very durable
and of great value. When we speak of "hearts of oak" it is always
the white variety we have in mind. You know how important it is
for ship building and other enterprises. There are too many varieties
to be named in this place, and I fear an extended description
would prove tedious to you.</p>

<p>Tramping a short distance farther the Inspector directed the
attention of the boys to a broad, spreading symmetrical tree fully
a hundred feet high and with a trunk more than three feet in diameter.
The bark was smooth and ash colored and the foliage purplish.
It ranks among the handsomest trees of the American forest and
every boy identified it at once as a beech, of the <em>Fagus</em>
genus of trees. It is so common that I am sure you are all familiar
with it. Possibly you are unaware that the roots do not descend
deeply into the soil but extend to a considerable distance close
under the surface. The beech is a favorite, and several beautiful
varieties are cultivated, some displaying purple, silver, and
other colored foliage. I recall a beech whose leaves in the autumn,
after being touched by frost, were so vivid and blood red, that
they resembled a huge cone of flaming fire when seen among the
differently tinted foliage.</p>

<p>One of the chief uses of the beech from the viewpoint of boys
is to furnish an admirable surface upon which to carve their names
with their jack-knives. I cannot compute the number of beech trunks
in the woods of my boyhood home which display my initials. Only
the other day I came across the bark, now bulging, contorted and
overgrown, upon which I broke the blade of my new knife, when
I was so young that I didn’t know any better than to form two
of the letters backward. Moreover, a few feet above my name was
that of my grandfather, which he cut into the bark when he was
a youngster fully sixty years before.</p>

<p>"The beech," remarked Uncle Elk, "furnishes fire wood, though
my preference is apple wood, followed next by hickory, sugar maple
and beech."</p>

<p>Uncle Elk was too wise to weary his young friends with much scientific
description. As he strolled forward, he made his talk more general
and asked fewer questions. He reminded them of the excellent appearance
of the white elm, which often grows to a height of a hundred feet
or more. It is not valuable, however, because its reddish brown,
coarse wood soon rots near the ground. A peculiarity of the sycamore,
which often attains a stature of a hundred and fifty feet, is
that it sheds its bark as well as its leaves.</p>

<p>The black locust is another tree with which I am sure you are
all familiar. You have seen rows of them lining the highways and
growing about old lawns. The timber is close grained and tough
and good for planking vessels. The mealy fruit is sweet, and we
used to try to persuade ourselves that we liked it, but I don’t
think any of us boys ever wholly succeeded.</p>

<p>When boiled and fermented the juice forms an intoxicating drink
resembling beer.</p>

<p>I was always fond of the red and water or swamp maples. The sap
from them when boiled down furnishes us the most delicious syrup
and sugar in the world. When we seek the sugar, however, it is
from the variety known by that name. The manufacture of maple
sugar is a leading industry during the spring months in many sections,
especially in Vermont, and some parts of New York and other states.</p>

<p>Have you ever taken a hand in the making of maple sugar? If so,
you will never forget its delights. In March, when the first signs
of thaw appear, you bore only a little way with an auger into
the juicy wood, when the sap comes bubbling down the small wooden
spout driven into the opening, and is caught in the trough or
kettle waiting below. As these fill up the sweet fluid is carried
to a huge iron kettle suspended over a roaring fire, and poured
into the vessel. It boils steadily away, but the supply is kept
up, the steam diffusing a most fragrant odor through the surrounding
atmosphere. The sap slowly grows thicker as the watery part is
given off in vapor, until it granulates and syrup and sugar result.</p>

<p>After the thick syrup is poured out of the big kettle there is
always a considerable quantity left clinging to the interior.
Balancing themselves over the edge of the iron reservoir, the
heads of the boys used to disappear with only their feet showing
while they scraped off the saccharine coating within and ate and
ate until nature protested and we had perforce to cease, but were
soon ready to resume our feast at the banquet of the gods. </p>
