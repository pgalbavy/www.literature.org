<p>At the top of the rise we halted for a second to breathe our horses;
and, turning, glanced at the battle beneath us, which, illumined as it
was by the fierce rays of the sinking sun staining the whole scene red,
looked from where we were more like some wild titanic picture than an
actual hand-to-hand combat. The distinguishing scenic effect from that
distance was the countless distinct flashes of light reflected from the
swords and spears, otherwise the panorama was not so grand as might have
been expected. The great green lap of sward in which the struggle was
being fought out, the bold round outline of the hills behind, and
the wide sweep of the plain beyond, seemed to dwarf it; and what was
tremendous enough when one was in it, grew insignificant when viewed
from the distance. But is it not thus with all the affairs and doings of
our race about which we blow the loud trumpet and make such a fuss and
worry? How utterly antlike, and morally and physically insignificant,
must they seem to the calm eyes that watch them from the arching depths
above!
</p>
<p>‘We win the day, Macumazahn,’ said old Umslopogaas, taking in the whole
situation with a glance of his practised eye. ‘Look, the Lady of the
Night’s forces give on every side, there is no stiffness left in them,
they bend like hot iron, they are fighting with but half a heart. But
alas! the battle will in a manner be drawn, for the darkness gathers,
and the regiments will not be able to follow and slay!’--and he shook
his head sadly. ‘But,’ he added, ‘I do not think that they will fight
again. We have fed them with too strong a meat. Ah! it is well to have
lived! At last I have seen a fight worth seeing.’
</p><p>By this time we were on our way again, and as we went side by side I
told him what our mission was, and how that, if it failed, all the lives
that had been lost that day would have been lost in vain.
</p><p>‘Ah!’ he said, ‘nigh on a hundred miles and no horses but these, and to
be there before the dawn! Well--away! away! man can but try, Macumazahn;
and mayhap we shall be there in time to split that old “witch-finder’s”
 [Agon’s] skull for him. Once he wanted to burn us, the old “rain-maker”,
did he? And now he would set a snare for my mother [Nyleptha], would he?
Good! So sure as my name is the name of the Woodpecker, so surely, be
my mother alive or dead, will I split him to the beard. Ay, by T’Chaka’s
head I swear it!’ and he shook Inkosi-kaas as he galloped. By now the
darkness was closing in, but fortunately there would be a moon later,
and the road was good.
</p><p>On we sped through the twilight, the two splendid horses we bestrode
had got their wind by this, and were sweeping along with a wide steady
stride that neither failed nor varied for mile upon mile. Down the side
of slopes we galloped, across wide vales that stretched to the foot
of far-off hills. Nearer and nearer grew the blue hills; now we were
travelling up their steeps, and now we were over and passing towards
others that sprang up like visions in the far, faint distance beyond.
</p><p>On, never pausing or drawing rein, through the perfect quiet of the
night, that was set like a song to the falling music of our horses’
hoofs; on, past deserted villages, where only some forgotten starving
dog howled a melancholy welcome; on, past lonely moated dwellings; on,
through the white patchy moonlight, that lay coldly upon the wide bosom
of the earth, as though there was no warmth in it; on, knee to knee, for
hour after hour!
</p><p>We spake not, but bent us forward on the necks of those two glorious
horses, and listened to their deep, long-drawn breaths as they filled
their great lungs, and to the regular unfaltering ring of their round
hoofs. Grim and black indeed did old Umslopogaas look beside me, mounted
upon the great white horse, like Death in the Revelation of St John, as
now and again lifting his fierce set face he gazed out along the road,
and pointed with his axe towards some distant rise or house.
</p><p>And so on, still on, without break or pause for hour after hour.
</p><p>At last I felt that even the splendid animal that I rode was beginning
to give out. I looked at my watch; it was nearly midnight, and we were
considerably more than half way. On the top of a rise was a little
spring, which I remembered because I had slept by it a few nights
before, and here I motioned to Umslopogaas to pull up, having determined
to give the horses and ourselves ten minutes to breathe in. He did so,
and we dismounted--that is to say, Umslopogaas did, and then helped me
off, for what with fatigue, stiffness, and the pain of my wound, I could
not do so for myself; and then the gallant horses stood panting there,
resting first one leg and then another, while the sweat fell drip, drip,
from them, and the steam rose and hung in pale clouds in the still night
air.
</p><p>Leaving Umslopogaas to hold the horses, I hobbled to the spring and
drank deep of its sweet waters. I had had nothing but a single mouthful
of wine since midday, when the battle began, and I was parched up,
though my fatigue was too great to allow me to feel hungry. Then, having
laved my fevered head and hands, I returned, and the Zulu went and
drank. Next we allowed the horses to take a couple of mouthfuls each--no
more; and oh, what a struggle we had to get the poor beasts away from
the water! There were yet two minutes, and I employed it in hobbling
up and down to try and relieve my stiffness, and in inspecting the
condition of the horses. My mare, gallant animal though she was, was
evidently much distressed; she hung her head, and her eye looked sick
and dull; but Daylight, Nyleptha’s glorious horse--who, if he is served
aright, should, like the steeds who saved great Rameses in his need,
feed for the rest of his days out of a golden manger--was still
comparatively speaking fresh, notwithstanding the fact that he had had
by far the heavier weight to carry. He was ‘tucked up’, indeed, and
his legs were weary, but his eye was bright and clear, and he held his
shapely head up and gazed out into the darkness round him in a way that
seemed to say that whoever failed <u>he</u> was good for those five-and-forty
miles that yet lay between us and Milosis. Then Umslopogaas helped me
into the saddle and--vigorous old savage that he was!--vaulted into his
own without touching a stirrup, and we were off once more, slowly at
first, till the horses got into their stride, and then more swiftly. So
we passed over another ten miles, and then came a long, weary rise of
some six or seven miles, and three times did my poor black mare nearly
come to the ground with me. But on the top she seemed to gather herself
together, and rattled down the slope with long, convulsive strides,
breathing in gasps. We did that three or four miles more swiftly than
any since we had started on our wild ride, but I felt it to be a last
effort, and I was right. Suddenly my poor horse took the bit between
her teeth and bolted furiously along a stretch of level ground for some
three or four hundred yards, and then, with two or three jerky strides,
pulled herself up and fell with a crash right on to her head, I rolling
myself free as she did so. As I struggled to my feet the brave beast
raised her head and looked at me with piteous bloodshot eyes, and then
her head dropped with a groan and she was dead. Her heart was broken.
</p><p>Umslopogaas pulled up beside the carcase, and I looked at him in dismay.
There were still more than twenty miles to do by dawn, and how were we
to do it with one horse? It seemed hopeless, but I had forgotten the old
Zulu’s extraordinary running powers.
</p><p>Without a single word he sprang from the saddle and began to hoist me
into it.
</p><p>‘What wilt thou do?’ I asked.
</p><p>‘Run,’ he answered, seizing my stirrup-leather.
</p><p>Then off we went again, almost as fast as before; and oh, the relief
it was to me to get that change of horses! Anybody who has ever ridden
against time will know what it meant.
</p><p>Daylight sped along at a long stretching hand-gallop, giving the
gaunt Zulu a lift at every stride. It was a wonderful thing to see
old Umslopogaas run mile after mile, his lips slightly parted and his
nostrils agape like the horse’s. Every five miles or so we stopped for a
few minutes to let him get his breath, and then flew on again.
</p><p>‘Canst thou go farther,’ I said at the third of these stoppages, ‘or
shall I leave thee to follow me?’
</p><p>He pointed with his axe to a dim mass before us. It was the Temple of
the Sun, now not more than five miles away.
</p><p>‘I reach it or I die,’ he gasped.
</p><p>Oh, that last five miles! The skin was rubbed from the inside of my
legs, and every movement of my horse gave me anguish. Nor was that all.
I was exhausted with toil, want of food and sleep, and also suffering
very much from the blow I had received on my left side; it seemed as
though a piece of bone or something was slowly piercing into my lung.
Poor Daylight, too, was pretty nearly finished, and no wonder. But there
was a smell of dawn in the air, and we might not stay; better that all
three of us should die upon the road than that we should linger while
there was life in us. The air was thick and heavy, as it sometimes is
before the dawn breaks, and--another infallible sign in certain parts of
Zu-Vendis that sunrise is at hand--hundreds of little spiders pendant on
the end of long tough webs were floating about in it. These early-rising
creatures, or rather their webs, caught upon the horse’s and our own
forms by scores, and, as we had neither the time nor the energy to brush
them off, we rushed along covered with hundreds of long grey threads
that streamed out a yard or more behind us--and a very strange
appearance they must have given us.
</p><p>And now before us are the huge brazen gates of the outer wall of the
Frowning City, and a new and horrible doubt strikes me: What if they
will not let us in?
</p><p>‘_Open! open!_’ I shout imperiously, at the same time giving the royal
password. ‘_Open! open!_ a messenger, a messenger with tidings of the
war!’
</p><p>‘What news?’ cried the guard. ‘And who art thou that ridest so madly,
and who is that whose tongue lolls out’--and it actually did--‘and who
runs by thee like a dog by a chariot?’
</p><p>‘It is the Lord Macumazahn, and with him is his dog, his black dog.
_Open! open!_ I bring tidings.’
</p><p>The great gates ran back on their rollers, and the drawbridge fell with
a rattling crash, and we dashed on through the one and over the other.
</p><p>‘What news, my lord, what news?’ cried the guard.
</p><p>‘Incubu rolls Sorais back, as the wind a cloud,’ I answered, and was
gone.
</p><p>One more effort, gallant horse, and yet more gallant man!
</p><p>So, fall not now, Daylight, and hold thy life in thee for fifteen short
minutes more, old Zulu war-dog, and ye shall both live for ever in the
annals of the land.
</p><p>On, clattering through the sleeping streets. We are passing the Flower
Temple now--one mile more, only one little mile--hold on, keep your
life in thee, see the houses run past of themselves. Up, good horse,
up, there--but fifty yards now. Ah! you see your stables and stagger on
gallantly.
</p><p>‘Thank God, the palace at last!’ and see, the first arrows of the dawn
are striking on the Temple’s golden dome. {Endnote 21} But shall I get
in here, or is the deed done and the way barred?
</p><p>Once more I give the password and shout ‘_Open! open!_’
</p><p>No answer, and my heart grows very faint.
</p><p>Again I call, and this time a single voice replies, and to my joy
I recognize it as belonging to Kara, a fellow-officer of Nyleptha’s
guards, a man I know to be as honest as the light--indeed, the same whom
Nyleptha had sent to arrest Sorais on the day she fled to the temple.
</p><p>‘Is it thou, Kara?’ I cry; ‘I am Macumazahn. Bid the guard let down the
bridge and throw wide the gate. Quick, quick!’
</p><p>Then followed a space that seemed to me endless, but at length the
bridge fell and one half of the gate opened and we got into the
courtyard, where at last poor Daylight fell down beneath me, as I
thought, dead. Except Kara, there was nobody to be seen, and his look
was wild, and his garments were all torn. He had opened the gate and let
down the bridge alone, and was now getting them up and shut again (as,
owing to a very ingenious arrangement of cranks and levers, one man
could easily do, and indeed generally did do).
</p><p>‘Where are the guard?’ I gasped, fearing his answer as I never feared
anything before.
</p><p>‘I know not,’ he answered; ‘two hours ago, as I slept, was I seized and
bound by the watch under me, and but now, this very moment, have I freed
myself with my teeth. I fear, I greatly fear, that we are betrayed.’
</p><p>His words gave me fresh energy. Catching him by the arm, I staggered,
followed by Umslopogaas, who reeled after us like a drunken man, through
the courtyards, up the great hall, which was silent as the grave,
towards the Queen’s sleeping-place.
</p><p>We reached the first ante-room--no guards; the second, still no guards.
Oh, surely the thing was done! we were too late after all, too late! The
silence and solitude of those great chambers was dreadful, and weighed
me down like an evil dream. On, right into Nyleptha’s chamber we rushed
and staggered, sick at heart, fearing the very worst; we saw there was
a light in it, ay, and a figure bearing the light. Oh, thank God, it
is the White Queen herself, the Queen unharmed! There she stands in
her night gear, roused, by the clatter of our coming, from her bed, the
heaviness of sleep yet in her eyes, and a red blush of fear and shame
mantling her lovely breast and cheek.
</p><p>‘Who is it?’ she cries. ‘What means this? Oh, Macumazahn, is it thou?
Why lookest thou so wildly? Thou comest as one bearing evil tidings--and
my lord--oh, tell me not my lord is dead--not dead!’ she wailed,
wringing her white hands.
</p><p>‘I left Incubu wounded, but leading the advance against Sorais last
night at sundown; therefore let thy heart have rest. Sorais is beaten
back all along her lines, and thy arms prevail.’
</p><p>‘I knew it,’ she cried in triumph. ‘I knew that he would win; and they
called him Outlander, and shook their wise heads when I gave him the
command! Last night at sundown, sayest thou, and it is not yet dawn?
Surely--’
</p><p>‘Throw a cloak around thee, Nyleptha,’ I broke in, ‘and give us wine
to drink; ay, and call thy maidens quick if thou wouldst save thyself
alive. Nay, stay not.’
</p><p>Thus adjured she ran and called through the curtains towards some room
beyond, and then hastily put on her sandals and a thick cloak, by which
time a dozen or so of half-dressed women were pouring into the room.
</p><p>‘Follow us and be silent,’ I said to them as they gazed with wondering
eyes, clinging one to another. So we went into the first ante-room.
</p><p>‘Now,’ I said, ‘give us wine to drink and food, if ye have it, for we
are near to death.’
</p><p>The room was used as a mess-room for the officers of the guards, and
from a cupboard some flagons of wine and some cold flesh were brought
forth, and Umslopogaas and I drank, and felt life flow back into our
veins as the good red wine went down.
</p><p>‘Hark to me, Nyleptha,’ I said, as I put down the empty tankard. ‘Hast
thou here among these thy waiting-ladies any two of discretion?’
</p><p>‘Ay,’ she said, ‘surely.’
</p><p>‘Then bid them go out by the side entrance to any citizens whom thou
canst bethink thee of as men loyal to thee, and pray them come armed,
with all honest folk that they can gather, to rescue thee from death.
Nay, question not; do as I say, and quickly. Kara here will let out the
maids.’
</p><p>She turned, and selecting two of the crowd of damsels, repeated the
words I had uttered, giving them besides a list of the names of the men
to whom each should run.
</p><p>‘Go swiftly and secretly; go for your very lives,’ I added.
</p><p>In another moment they had left with Kara, whom I told to rejoin us at
the door leading from the great courtyard on to the stairway as soon as
he had made fast behind the girls. Thither, too, Umslopogaas and I made
our way, followed by the Queen and her women. As we went we tore off
mouthfuls of food, and between them I told her what I knew of the danger
which encompassed her, and how we found Kara, and how all the guards and
men-servants were gone, and she was alone with her women in that great
place; and she told me, too, that a rumour had spread through the town
that our army had been utterly destroyed, and that Sorais was marching
in triumph on Milosis, and how in consequence thereof all men had fallen
away from her.
</p><p>Though all this takes some time to tell, we had not been but six or
seven minutes in the palace; and notwithstanding that the golden roof of
the temple being very lofty was ablaze with the rays of the rising sun,
it was not yet dawn, nor would be for another ten minutes. We were in
the courtyard now, and here my wound pained me so that I had to take
Nyleptha’s arm, while Umslopogaas rolled along after us, eating as he
went.
</p><p>Now we were across it, and had reached the narrow doorway through the
palace wall that opened on to the mighty stair.
</p><p>I looked through and stood aghast, as well I might. The door was gone,
and so were the outer gates of bronze--entirely gone. They had been
taken from their hinges, and as we afterwards found, hurled from the
stairway to the ground two hundred feet beneath. There in front of us
was the semicircular standing-space, about twice the size of a large
oval dining-table, and the ten curved black marble steps leading on to
the main stair--and that was all.
