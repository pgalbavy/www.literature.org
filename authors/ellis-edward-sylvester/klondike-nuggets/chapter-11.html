<p>Jeff Graham looked inquiringly at Tim McCabe, who nodded his
head by way of reply. At the same time he said something to Hardman,
and all three rose to their feet. Then the poles were plied with
an effect that speedily drove the raft against the bank, where
Tim sprang ashore and secured it. Brave and reckless as was the
fellow, he had no intention of trying to take the boat through
the exceedingly dangerous White Horse Rapids, but he could not
refuse the chance for a little amusement at the expense of his
young friends.</p>

<p>In truth, no one should ever attempt to take a boat through White
Horse Rapids. The best course, perhaps, is to let it drift down
the rapids, guided by a rope one hundred and fifty feet in length.
If it passes through without material injury, the craft is still
at command below. Another plan is to portage. At this writing
there are roller-ways on the western side, over which the boats
can be rolled with a windlass to help pull them to the top of
the hill. In lining a craft, it must be done on the right-hand
side. Three miles farther down comes the Box Cañon, one hundred
yards in length and fifty feet wide, with a chute of terrific
velocity. Repeated attempts have been made by reckless miners
to take a boat through, but it is much the same as trying to shoot
the rapids below Niagara, and the place has well earned its title
of "The Miners' Grave." Still, the feat has been performed in
safety.</p>

<p>Progress was so effectually barred at White Horse that our friends
gave up their raft as of no further use. It was certain to be
shattered, and where there was so much timber it was comparatively
easy to build another, with which to make the remaining two hundred
and twenty miles, particularly as there was no need of constructing
a double-decker, for the rough voyaging was at an end.</p>

<p>The goods were, therefore, packed upon the Yukon sleds, and then
the raft set adrift. It was never seen again, though an occasional
stray log afterward observed bobbing in the current below the
rapids may have formed a part of the structure that had served
the travellers so well. There was enough snow for the sleds, but
the work was exhausting, and was not completed until late in the
afternoon, when the tent was set up and camp made.</p>

<p>By the close of the following day the raft was finished. It contained
enough pine lumber to float a much heavier load than formed its
burden, but, as we have stated, it lacked the double deck, since
the necessity for one no longer existed.</p>

<p>The raft was no more than fairly completed when a storm that
had been threatening broke upon the party. Since it was expected,
and there was no saying how long it would last, the tent was set
up and secured in place. Considerable fuel had been gathered,
and every preparation was made for a prolonged stay, though it
need not be said that each one hoped it would prove otherwise.
In a country where for four-fifths of the days the sun does not
show itself, such weather must be expected, and, on the whole,
our friends counted themselves fortunate that they had been able
to make such good progress.</p>

<p>The tent was hardly in position, and all within, huddling around
the stove, in which Tim had just started a fire, when they were
startled by a hail:</p>

<p>"Halloa, the house!"</p>

<p>The four hurried outside, where a striking sight met them. Eight
men, each with a heavy pack strapped over his shoulders, and bending
over with his load, thickly clad, but with their faces, so far
as they could be seen through the wrappings, wet and red, had
halted in front of the tent, which they scrutinized with wonder.</p>

<p>"Are you going to begin digging here?" called one of the men,
whose eyes, nose, and mouth were all that was visible behind his
muffler.</p>

<p>"Not while the storm lasts," replied Tim. "If we had room, we'd
ask ye to come inside and enj'y yoursilves till the weather clears.
At any rate, we'll be glad to give ye something warm to ate and
drink."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it!" exclaimed another of the men. "You're afraid
of the storm, are you?"</p>

<p>"We're not much afraid, but we ain't in love with the same. Won't
ye come in&mdash;that is, one or two at a time?"</p>

<p>"Thanks for your invitation, but we haven't the time to spare.
We're afeared they'll get all the gold in the Klondike country
if we don't hurry. You're foolish to loiter along the road like
this."</p>

<p>"We're willing to lose a bit of the goold for sake of the comfort.
If ye are bound to go on, we wish ye good luck."</p>

<p>"The same to yourselves," the plucky and hopeful miners called
as they plodded forward.</p>

<p>For two dreary days the party was storm-stayed in camp.</p>

<p>"Here," said Jeff Graham, when making ready to resume their voyage,
"we leave our Yukon sleds."</p>

<p>"Shall we not need them on our return?" asked Roswell.</p>

<p>"We should if we returned by this route, but I wouldn't work
my way against these streams and through the passes again for
all the gold in the Klondike country. We shall take the steamer
down the Yukon to St. Michael's, and so on to Seattle."</p>

<p>"That is a long voyage," suggested Hardman.</p>

<p>"Yes, four thousand miles; but it will be easy enough for us
when we are on a steamer."</p>

<p>"The Yukon is closed for eight months or more each year."</p>

<p>"We don't intend to go down it when it's closed, for I didn't
bring skates along, and I don't know how to skate, anyway."</p>

<p>"You do not expect to stay long in the Klondike country?" was
the inquiring remark of Hardman, who showed little interest in
the intentions of their leader.</p>

<p>"That depends; we shall come back in two months, or six, or a
year, according as to how rich we strike it."</p>

<p>"S'pose you don't strike it at all."</p>

<p>Jeff shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"We'll make a good try for it. If we slip up altogether, these
folks I have brought with me won't be any worse off than before;
but I don't intend to slip up&mdash;that ain't what I came into this
part of the world for."</p>

<p>"No, I reckon few people come for that," was the comment of Hardman,
who seemed to be in a cheerful mood again.</p>

<p>Nothing could have offered a stronger contrast to their previous
rough experience than that which now came to them. Fourteen miles
down the river brought them to Lake Labarge, where they had nothing
to do but to sit down and float with the current, using the poles
occasionally to keep the raft in the best position. Thirty-one
miles brought them to Lewis River, down which they passed to the
Hootalinqua; then to the Big Salmon, and forty-five miles farther
to the Little Salmon, the current running five miles an hour,
and much swifter in the narrow cañon-like passages. Then beyond
the Little Salmon the craft and its hopeful passengers floated
smoothly with the current for a distance of one hundred and twenty
miles, when the boys were startled to see four giant buttes of
stone towering above the water, which rushed violently among them.</p>

<p>"What place is that?" asked Frank, who with his cousin surveyed
the immense towers with deep interest.</p>

<p>"Five-Finger Rapids," was the reply.</p>

<p>"They look dangerous."</p>

<p>"So they be, unless ye happens to know which two to pass between;
now, which would ye selict as a guess?"</p>

<p>Roswell and Frank studied them awhile, and the latter answered:</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem to me that it makes much difference which one
you take."</p>

<p>"Ah, but it makes a mighty difference. We should have big trouble
if we neglicted to folly the right side of the river."</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>TIM AND JEFF LIT THEIR PIPES; HARDMAN SAT
APART</em>.]</p>

<p>Jeff and Hardman were already working the raft in that direction,
and Tim now gave his aid. It looked perilous, but, knowing the
right course, the craft made the passage without any mishap. All
settled down to enjoy the smooth sailing that was before them
once more. Tim and Jeff lit their pipes, Hardman sat apart, while
the boys were together near the front of the raft. The weather
was clearer than it had been for several days, and much more moderate.
May was well advanced, and the short, hot summer was at hand.
If all went well, they would reach the gold country at the right
season, and as they neared the goal the spirits of all rose, and
a longing to get forward manifested itself in many ways. They
waited until night had fairly come before they went ashore and
encamped, and they were off again at daybreak, despite the uncannily
early hour at which it comes in that part of the world.</p>

<p>Six miles down the Lewis River took them to the Rink Rapids,
through which they passed without difficulty. Just beyond are
the ruins of Fort Selkirk, where the Pelly and Lewis rivers unite.
Tim McCabe studied the mouth of the Pelly, as it poured into the
Lewis, and soon as the point was fairly passed, he turned to his
friends, his round face aglow.</p>

<p>"I offer me congratulations," he said, doffing his cap and bowing
low.</p>

<p>"On what?" asked Frank Mansley.</p>

<p>"The stream over which ye are now floating takes the name of
the Yukon, and doesn't give up the same till it tumbles into the
Pacific siveral miles to the west of us."</p>

<p>"Several miles!" repeated Frank; "it must be three thousand."</p>

<p>"Something like that, I belave. The worst part of our journey
is behind us."</p>

<p>"How far are we from Juneau?"</p>

<p>"To be exact, which I loikes to be, it is five hundred and tin
miles."</p>
