<p>A week later, on a hot July afternoon, Miss Florence Atwater,
recovered from her cold, stood in the shady back yard of her place
of residence and yawned more extensively than any one would have
believed possible, judging by her face in repose. Three of her
friends, congenial in age and sex, were out of town for the summer;
two had been ascertained, by telephonic inquiries, to be taking
commanded siestas; and neither the other one nor Florence had
yet forgotten that yesterday, although they were too religious
to commit themselves to a refusal to meet as sisters in the Great
Beyond, they had taken the expurgated oath that by Everything
they would never speak to each other again so long as they both
should live.</p>

<p>Florence was at the end of her resources. She had sought distraction
in experimental cookery; but, having scorched a finger, and having
been told by the cook that a person's own kitchen wasn't worth
the price at eleven dollars a week if it had to git all smelled
up with broiled rubber when the femometer stood at ninety-sevvum
degrees in the shade, the experimenter abusedly turned her back
on the morose woman and went out to the back yard for a little
peace.</p>

<p>After an interval of torpor, she decided to go and see what Herbert
was doing&mdash;a move not short of desperation, on account of Herbert's
new manner toward her. For a week Herbert had steadily pursued
his scientific career, and he seemed to feel that in it he had
attained a distinction beyond the reach of Florence. What made
it ridiculous for her to hope was, of course, the fact that she
was a girl, and Herbert had explained this to her in a cold, unpleasant
way; for it is true that what is called "feminism" must be acquired
by men, and is not a condition, or taste, natural to them. At
thirteen it has not been acquired.</p>

<p>She found him at home. He was importantly engaged in a room in
the cellar, where were loosely stored all manner of incapacitated
household devices; two broken clothes-wringers, a crippled and
rusted sewing-machine, an ice-cream freezer in like condition,
a cracked and discarded marble mantelpiece, chipped porcelain
and chinaware of all sorts, rusted stove lids and flatirons, half
a dozen dead mops and brooms. This was the laboratory, and here,
in congenial solitude, Herbert conducted his investigations. That
is to say, until Florence arrived he was undisturbed by human
intrusion, but he was not alone&mdash;far from it! There was, in fact,
almost too much life in the place.</p>

<p>Where the light fell clearest from the cobwebby windows at the
ground level overhead, he had placed a long deal table, once a
helpmate in the kitchen, but now a colourless antique on three
legs and two starch boxes. Upon the table were seven or eight
glass jars, formerly used for preserves and pickles, and a dozen
jelly glasses (with only streaks and bits of jelly in them now)
and five or six small round pasteboard pill-boxes. The jars were
covered, some with their own patent tops, others with shingles
or bits of board, and one with a brick. The jelly glasses stood
inverted, and were inhabited; so were the preserve jars and pickle
jars; and so were the pill-boxes, which evidently contained star
boarders, for they were pierced with "breathing holes," and one
of them, standing upon its side like a little wheel, now and then
moved in a faint, ghostly manner as if about to start rolling
on its own account&mdash;whereupon Herbert glanced up and addressed
it sternly, though somewhat inconsistently: "You shut up!"</p>

<p>In the display of so much experimental paraphernalia, there may
have been a hint that Herbert's was a scientific nature craving
rather quantity than quality; his collection certainly possessed
the virtue of multitudinousness, if that be a virtue; and the
birds in the neighbourhood must have been undergoing a great deal
of disappointment. In brief, as many bugs as Herbert now owned
have seldom been seen in the custody of any private individual.
And nearly all of them were alive, energetic and swearing, though
several of the preserve jars had been imperfectly drained of their
heavy syrups, and in one of them a great many spiders seemed to
be having, of the whole collection, the poorest time; being pretty
well mired down and yet still subject to disagreements among themselves.
The habits of this group, under such unusual surroundings, formed
the subject of Herbert's special study at the moment of Florence's
arrival. He was seated at the table and frowning with science
as he observed the unfortunates through that magnifying-glass,
his discovery of which was responsible for their present condition
and his own choice of a career.</p>

<p>Florence paused in the doorway, but he gave no sign of recognition,
unless his intensified preoccupation was a sign, and Florence,
perceiving what line of conduct he meant to adopt, instinctively
selected a reciprocal one for herself. "Herbert Atwater, you ought
to be punished! I'm goin' to tell your father and mother."</p>

<p>"You g'way," Herbert returned, unmoved; and, without condescending
to give her a glance, he set down the magnifying-glass, and with
a pencil wrote something profoundly entomological in a soiled
memorandum book upon the table. "Run away, Flor'nce. Run away
somewheres and play."</p>

<p>Florence approached. "'Play'!" she echoed tartly. "I should think
<em>you</em> wouldn't talk much about 'playin',' the way you're
teasing those poor, poor little bugs!"</p>

<p>"'Teasing'!" Herbert exclaimed: "That shows! That shows!"</p>

<p>"Shows what?"</p>

<p>"How much you know!" He became despondent about her. "See here,
Florence; it does look to me as though at your age a person ought
to know anyway enough not to disturb me when I'm expairamenting,
and everything. I should think&#11834;"</p>

<p>But she did not prove so meek as to await the conclusion of his
remonstrance. "I never saw anything as wicked in my whole born
days! What did any of those poor, poor little bugs ever do to
<em>you</em>, I'd like to know, you got to go and confine 'em
like this! And look how dirty your hands are!"</p>

<p>This final charge, wandering so far from her previous specifications
of his guilt, was purely automatic and conventional; Florence
often interjected it during the course of any cousinly discussion,
whatever the subject in dispute, and she had not even glanced
at Herbert's hands to assure herself that the accusation was warranted.
But, as usual, the facts supported her; and they also supported
Herbert in his immediate mechanical retort: "So're yours!"</p>

<p>"Not either!" But here Florence, after instinctively placing
her hands behind her, brought forth the right one to point, and
simultaneously uttered a loud cry: "Oh, <em>look</em> at your
hands!" For now she did look at Herbert's hands, and was amazed.</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?"</p>

<p>"They're all lumpy!" she cried, and, as her gaze rose to his
cheek, her finger followed her eyes and pointed to strange appearances
there. "Look at your <em>face</em>!"</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" he demanded, his tone not entirely free from
braggadocio. "A girl can't make expairaments the way I do, because
if one of these good ole bumblebees or hornets of mine was to
give 'em a little sting, once in a while, while they was catchin'
'em and puttin' 'em in a jar, all they'd know how to do'd be to
holler and run home to their mamma. Nobody with any gumption minds
a few little stings after you put mud on 'em."</p>

<p>"I guess it serves you right," Florence said, "for persecutin'
these poor, poor little bugs."</p>

<p>Herbert became plaintive. "Look here, Florence; I do wish you'd
go on back home where you belong."</p>

<p>But Florence did not reply; instead she picked up the magnifying-glass,
and, gazing through it at a pickle jar of mixed beetles, caterpillars,
angleworms, and potato bugs, permitted herself to shudder. "Vile
things!" she said.</p>

<p>"They are not, either!" Herbert retorted hotly. "They're about
the finest insecks that you or anybody else ever saw, and you
ought to be ashamed&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I ought?" his cousin cried. "Well, I should think you're the
one ought to be ashamed, if anybody ought! Down here in the cellar
playin' with all these vile bugs that ought to be given their
liberty, or thrown down the sewer, or somep'n!" Again, as she
peered through the lens, she shuddered. "Vile&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Florence," he said sternly, "you lay down that magnifying-glass."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because you don't know how to handle it. A magnifying-glass
has got to be handled in just the right way, and you couldn't
learn if you tried a thousand years. That's a mighty fine magnifying-glass,
and I don't intend to have it ruined."</p>

<p>"Why, just lookin' through it can't spoil it, can it?" she inquired,
surprised.</p>

<p>"You lay it down," said Herbert darkly. "Lookin' through it the
wrong way isn't going to do it any <em>good</em>."</p>

<p>"Why, how could just <em>lookin'</em> through it&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Lookin' through it the wrong way isn't goin' to <em>help</em>
it any, I tell you!" he insisted. "You're old enough to know that,
and I'm not goin' to have my magnifying-glass spoiled and all
my insecks wasted just because of a mere whin of yours!"</p>

<p>"A what?"</p>

<p>"A mere whin, I said!"</p>

<p>"What's a whin?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind," said Herbert ominously. "You'll proba'ly find
out some day when you aren't expectin' to!"</p>

<p>Undeniably, Florence was somewhat impressed: she replaced the
magnifying-glass upon the table and picked up the notebook.</p>

<p>"You lay that down, too," said Herbert instantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, maybe it's somep'n you're <em>'shamed</em> to&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Go on and read it, then," he said, suddenly changing his mind,
for he was confident that she would find matter here that might
cause her to appreciate at least a little of her own inferiority.</p>

<p>"'Nots'," Florence began. "'Nots'&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Notes!" he corrected her fiercely.</p>

<p>"'Notes'," she read. "'Notes on our inseck friends. The spidder&#11834;'"</p>

<p>"<em>Spider!</em>"</p>

<p>"'The spider spends his time mostly in cobwebs which he digilently
spins between posts and catches flies to eat them. They are different
coloured and sizes and have legs in pairs. Spiders also spin their
webs in corners or in weeds or on a fence and sometimes in the
grass. They are more able to get about quicker than catapillars
or fishing worms, but cannot fly such as pinching bugs, lightning
bugs, and birds because having no wings, nor jump as far as the
grass hoper&#11834;'"</p>

<p>"Grasshopper!" Herbert shouted.</p>

<p>"I'm readin' it the way it's spelled," Florence explained. "Anyway,
it don't make much sense."</p>

<p>Herbert was at least enough of an author to be furious. "Lay
it down!" he said bitterly. "And go on back home to your dolls."</p>

<p>"Dolls certainly would be <em>cleaner</em> than vile bugs," Florence
retorted, tossing the book upon the table. "But in regards to
that, I haven't had any," she went on, airily&mdash;"not for years
and years and years and&#11834;"</p>

<p>He interrupted her, his voice again plaintive. "See here, Florence,
how do you expect me to get my <em>work</em> done, with you everlastin'ly
talkin' and goin' on around here like this? Can't you see I've
got somep'n pretty important on my hands?"</p>

<p>Florence became thoughtful. "I never did see as many bugs before,
all together this way," she said. "What you goin' to do with 'em,
Herbert?"</p>

<p>"I'm makin' my expairaments."</p>

<p>But her thoughtfulness increased. "It seems to me," she said
slowly:&mdash;"Herbert, it seems to me there must be some awful inter'sting
thing we could do with so many bugs all together like this."</p>

<p>"'We'!" he cried. "My goodness, whose insecks do you think these
insecks are?"</p>

<p>"I just know there's somep'n," she went on, following her own
line of thought, and indifferent to his outburst. "There's somep'n
we could do with 'em that we'd never forget, if we could only
think of it."</p>

<p>In spite of himself, Herbert was interested. "Well, what?" he
asked. "What could we do with 'em we'd never forget?"</p>

<p>In her eyes there was a far-away light as of a seeress groping.
"I don't just know exackly, but I know there's <em>somep'n</em>&mdash;if
we could only think of it&mdash;if we could just&#11834;" And her voice
became inaudible, as in dreamy concentration she seated herself
upon the discarded ice-cream freezer, and rested her elbows upon
her knees and her chin upon the palms of her hands.</p>

<p>In silence then, she thought and thought. Herbert also was silent,
for he, too, was trying to think, not knowing that already he
had proved himself to be wax in her hands, and that he was destined
further to show himself thus malleable. Like many and many another
of his sex, he never for an instant suspected that he spent the
greater part of his time carrying out ideas implanted within him
by a lady-friend. Florence was ever the imaginative one of those
two, a maiden of unexpected fancies and inexplicable conceptions,
a mind of quicksilver and mist. There was within her the seedling
of a creative artist, and as she sat there, on the ice-cream freezer
in Herbert's cellar, with the slowly growing roseate glow of deep
preoccupation upon her, she looked strangely sweet and good, and
even almost pretty.</p>
