<p>After a long silence, during which Almayer had moved towards
the table and sat down, his head between his hands, staring straight
before him, Lingard, who had recommenced walking, cleared his
throat and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"What was it you were saying?"</p>

<p>"Ah! Yes! You should have seen this settlement that night. I
don’t think anybody went to bed. I walked down to the point, and
could see them. They had a big bonfire in the palm grove, and
the talk went on there till the morning. When I came back here
and sat in the dark verandah in this quiet house I felt so frightfully
lonely that I stole in and took the child out of her cot and brought
her here into my hammock. If it hadn’t been for her I am sure
I would have gone mad; I felt so utterly alone and helpless. Remember,
I hadn’t heard from you for four months. Didn’t know whether you
were alive or dead. Patalolo would have nothing to do with me.
My own men were deserting me like rats do a sinking hulk. That
was a black night for me, Captain Lingard. A black night as I
sat here not knowing what would happen next. They were so excited
and rowdy that I really feared they would come and burn the house
over my head. I went and brought my revolver. Laid it loaded on
the table. There were such awful yells now and then. Luckily the
child slept through it, and seeing her so pretty and peaceful
steadied me somehow. Couldn’t believe there was any violence in
this world, looking at her lying so quiet and so unconscious of
what went on. But it was very hard. Everything was at an end.
You must understand that on that night there was no government
in Sambir. Nothing to restrain those fellows. Patalolo had collapsed.
I was abandoned by my own people, and all that lot could vent
their spite on me if they wanted. They know no gratitude. How
many times haven’t I saved this settlement from starvation? Absolute
starvation. Only three months ago I distributed again a lot of
rice on credit. There was nothing to eat in this infernal place.
They came begging on their knees. There isn’t a man in Sambir,
big or little, who is not in debt to Lingard &amp; Co. Not one.
You ought to be satisfied. You always said that was the right
policy for us. Well, I carried it out. Ah! Captain Lingard, a
policy like that should be backed by loaded rifles . . ."</p>

<p>"You had them!" exclaimed Lingard in the midst of his promenade,
that went on more rapid as Almayer talked: the headlong tramp
of a man hurrying on to do something violent. The verandah was
full of dust, oppressive and choking, which rose under the old
seaman’s feet, and made Almayer cough again and again.</p>

<p>"Yes, I had! Twenty. And not a finger to pull a trigger. It’s
easy to talk," he spluttered, his face very red.</p>

<p>Lingard dropped into a chair, and leaned back with one hand stretched
out at length upon the table, the other thrown over the back of
his seat. The dust settled, and the sun surging above the forest
flooded the verandah with a clear light. Almayer got up and busied
himself in lowering the split rattan screens that hung between
the columns of the verandah.</p>

<p>"Phew!" said Lingard, "it will be a hot day. That’s right, my
boy. Keep the sun out. We don’t want to be roasted alive here."</p>

<p>Almayer came back, sat down, and spoke very calmly&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the morning I went across to see Patalolo. I took the child
with me, of course. I found the water-gate barred, and had to
walk round through the bushes. Patalolo received me lying on the
floor, in the dark, all the shutters closed. I could get nothing
out of him but lamentations and groans. He said you must be dead.
That Lakamba was coming now with Abdulla’s guns to kill everybody.
Said he did not mind being killed, as he was an old man, but that
the wish of his heart was to make a pilgrimage. He was tired of
men’s ingratitude&mdash;he had no heirs&mdash;he wanted to go to Mecca and
die there. He would ask Abdulla to let him go. Then he abused
Lakamba&mdash;between sobs&mdash;and you, a little. You prevented him from
asking for a flag that would have been respected&mdash;he was right
there&mdash;and now when his enemies were strong he was weak, and you
were not there to help him. When I tried to put some heart into
him, telling him he had four big guns&mdash;you know the brass six-pounders
you left here last year&mdash;and that I would get powder, and that,
perhaps, together we could make head against Lakamba, he simply
howled at me. No matter which way he turned&mdash;he shrieked&mdash;the
white men would be the death of him, while he wanted only to be
a pilgrim and be at peace. My belief is,"  added Almayer, after
a short pause, and fixing a dull stare upon Lingard, "that the
old fool saw this thing coming for a long time, and was not only
too frightened to do anything himself, but actually too scared
to let you or me know of his suspicions. Another of your particular
pets! Well! You have a lucky hand, I must say!"</p>

<p>Lingard struck a sudden blow on the table with his clenched hand.
There was a sharp crack of splitting wood. Almayer started up
violently, then fell back in his chair and looked at the table.</p>

<p>"There!" he said, moodily, "you don’t know your own strength.
This table is completely ruined. The only table I had been able
to save from my wife. By and by I will have to eat squatting on
the floor like a native."</p>

<p>Lingard laughed heartily. "Well then, don’t nag at me like a
woman at a drunken husband!" He became very serious after awhile,
and added, "If it hadn’t been for the loss of the Flash I would
have been here three months ago, and all would have been well.
No use crying over that. Don’t you be uneasy, Kaspar. We will
have everything ship-shape here in a very short time."</p>

<p>"What? You don’t mean to expel Abdulla out of here by force!
I tell you, you can’t."</p>

<p>"Not I!" exclaimed Lingard. "That’s all over, I am afraid. Great
pity. They will suffer for it. He will squeeze them. Great pity.
Damn it! I feel so sorry for them if I had the Flash here I would
try force. Eh! Why not? However, the poor Flash is gone, and there
is an end of it. Poor old hooker. Hey, Almayer? You made a voyage
or two with me. Wasn’t she a sweet craft? Could make her do anything
but talk. She was better than a wife to me. Never scolded. Hey?
. . . And to think that it should come to this. That I should
leave her poor old bones sticking on a reef as though I had been
a damned fool of a southern-going man who must have half a mile
of water under his keel to be safe! Well! well! It’s only those
who do nothing that make no mistakes, I suppose. But it’s hard.
Hard."</p>

<p>He nodded sadly, with his eyes on the ground. Almayer looked
at him with growing indignation.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, you are heartless," he burst out; "perfectly heartless&mdash;and
selfish. It does not seem to strike you&mdash;in all that&mdash;that in
losing your ship&mdash;by your recklessness, I am sure&mdash;you ruin me&mdash;us,
and my little Nina. What’s going to become of me and of her? That’s
what I want to know. You brought me here, made me your partner,
and now, when everything is gone to the devil&mdash;through your fault,
mind you&mdash;you talk about your ship . . . ship! You can get another.
But here. This trade. That’s gone now, thanks to Willems. . .
. Your dear Willems!"</p>

<p>"Never you mind about Willems. I will look after him," said Lingard,
severely. "And as to the trade . . . I will make your fortune
yet, my boy. Never fear. Have you got any cargo for the schooner
that brought me here?"</p>

<p>"The shed is full of rattans," answered Almayer, "and I have
about eighty tons of guttah in the well. The last lot I ever will
have, no doubt," he added, bitterly.</p>

<p>"So, after all, there was no robbery. You’ve lost nothing actually.
Well, then, you must . . . Hallo! What’s the matter! . . . Here!
. . ."</p>

<p>"Robbery! No!" screamed Almayer, throwing up his hands.</p>

<p>He fell back in the chair and his face became purple. A little
white foam appeared on his lips and trickled down his chin, while
he lay back, showing the whites of his upturned eyes. When he
came to himself he saw Lingard standing over him, with an empty
water-chatty in his hand.</p>

<p>"You had a fit of some kind," said the old seaman with much concern.
"What is it? You did give me a fright. So very sudden."</p>

<p>Almayer, his hair all wet and stuck to his head, as if he had
been diving, sat up and gasped.</p>

<p>"Outrage! A fiendish outrage. I . . ."</p>

<p>Lingard put the chatty on the table and looked at him in attentive
silence. Almayer passed his hand over his forehead and went on
in an unsteady tone:</p>

<p>"When I remember that, I lose all control," he said. "I told
you he anchored Abdulla’s ship abreast our jetty, but over to
the other shore, near the Rajah’s place. The ship was surrounded
with boats. From here it looked as if she had been landed on a
raft. Every dugout in Sambir was there. Through my glass I could
distinguish the faces of people on the poop &mdash;Abdulla, Willems,
Lakamba&mdash;everybody. That old cringing scoundrel Sahamin was there.
I could see quite plain. There seemed to be much talk and discussion.
Finally I saw a ship’s boat lowered. Some Arab got into her, and
the boat went towards Patalolo’s landing-place. It seems they
had been refused admittance&mdash;so they say. I think myself that
the water-gate was not unbarred quick enough to please the exalted
messenger. At any rate I saw the boat come back almost directly.
I was looking on, rather interested, when I saw Willems and some
more go forward&mdash;very busy about something there. That woman was
also amongst them. Ah, that woman . . ."</p>

<p>Almayer choked, and seemed on the point of having a relapse,
but by a violent effort regained a comparative composure.</p>

<p>"All of a sudden," he continued&mdash;"bang! They fired a shot into
Patalolo’s gate, and before I had time to catch my breath &mdash;I
was startled, you may believe&mdash;they sent another and burst the
gate open. Whereupon, I suppose, they thought they had done enough
for a while, and probably felt hungry, for a feast began aft.
Abdulla sat amongst them like an idol, cross-legged, his hands
on his lap. He’s too great altogether to eat when others do, but
he presided, you see. Willems kept on dodging about forward, aloof
from the crowd, and looking at my house through the ship’s long
glass. I could not resist it. I shook my fist at him."</p>

<p>"Just so," said Lingard, gravely. "That was the thing to do,
of course. If you can’t fight a man the best thing is to exasperate
him."</p>

<p>Almayer waved his hand in a superior manner, and continued, unmoved:
"You may say what you like. You can’t realize my feelings. He
saw me, and, with his eye still at the small end of the glass,
lifted his arm as if answering a hail. I thought my turn to be
shot at would come next after Patalolo, so I ran up the Union
Jack to the flagstaff in the yard. I had no other protection.
There were only three men besides Ali that stuck to me&mdash;three
cripples, for that matter, too sick to get away. I would have
fought singlehanded, I think, I was that angry, but there was
the child. What to do with her? Couldn’t send her up the river
with the mother. You know I can’t trust my wife. I decided to
keep very quiet, but to let nobody land on our shore. Private
property, that; under a deed from Patalolo. I was within my right&mdash;wasn’t
I? The morning was very quiet. After they had a feed on board
the barque with Abdulla most of them went home; only the big people
remained. Towards three o’clock Sahamin crossed alone in a small
canoe. I went down on our wharf with my gun to speak to him, but
didn’t let him land. The old hypocrite said Abdulla sent greetings
and wished to talk with me on business; would I come on board?
I said no; I would not. Told him that Abdulla may write and I
would answer, but no interview, neither on board his ship nor
on shore. I also said that if anybody attempted to land within
my fences I would shoot&mdash;no matter whom. On that he lifted his
hands to heaven, scandalized, and then paddled away pretty smartly&mdash;to
report, I suppose. An hour or so afterwards I saw Willems land
a boat party at the Rajah’s. It was very quiet. Not a shot was
fired, and there was hardly any shouting. They tumbled those brass
guns you presented to Patalolo last year down the bank into the
river. It’s deep there close to. The channel runs that way, you
know. About five, Willems went back on board, and I saw him join
Abdulla by the wheel aft. He talked a lot, swinging his arms about&mdash;seemed
to explain things&mdash;pointed at my house, then down the reach. Finally,
just before sunset, they hove upon the cable and dredged the ship
down nearly half a mile to the junction of the two branches of
the river&mdash;where she is now, as you might have seen."</p>

<p>Lingard nodded.</p>

<p>"That evening, after dark&mdash;I was informed &mdash;Abdulla landed
for the first time in Sambir. He was entertained in Sahamin’s
house. I sent Ali to the settlement for news. He returned about
nine, and reported that Patalolo was sitting on Abdulla’s left
hand before Sahamin’s fire. There was a great council. Ali seemed
to think that Patalolo was a prisoner, but he was wrong there.
They did the trick very neatly. Before midnight everything was
arranged as I can make out. Patalolo went back to his demolished
stockade, escorted by a dozen boats with torches. It appears he
begged Abdulla to let him have a passage in the Lord of the Isles
to Penang. From there he would go to Mecca. The firing business
was alluded to as a mistake. No doubt it was in a sense. Patalolo
never meant resisting. So he is going as soon as the ship is ready
for sea. He went on board next day with three women and half a
dozen fellows as old as himself. By Abdulla’s orders he was received
with a salute of seven guns, and he has been living on board ever
since&mdash;five weeks. I doubt whether he will leave the river alive.
At any rate he won’t live to reach Penang. Lakamba took over all
his goods, and gave him a draft on Abdulla’s house payable in
Penang. He is bound to die before he gets there. Don’t you see?"</p>

<p>He sat silent for a while in dejected meditation, then went on:</p>

<p>"Of course there were several rows during the night. Various
fellows took the opportunity of the unsettled state of affairs
to pay off old scores and settle old grudges. I passed the night
in that chair there, dozing uneasily. Now and then there would
be a great tumult and yelling which would make me sit up, revolver
in hand. However, nobody was killed. A few broken heads&mdash;that’s
all. Early in the morning Willems caused them to make a fresh
move which I must say surprised me not a little. As soon as there
was daylight they busied themselves in setting up a flag-pole
on the space at the other end of the settlement, where Abdulla
is having his houses built now. Shortly after sunrise there was
a great gathering at the flag-pole. All went there. Willems was
standing leaning against the mast, one arm over that woman’s shoulders.
They had brought an armchair for Patalolo, and Lakamba stood on
the right hand of the old man, who made a speech. Everybody in
Sambir was there: women, slaves, children&mdash;everybody! Then Patalolo
spoke. He said that by the mercy of the Most High he was going
on a pilgrimage. The dearest wish of his heart was to be accomplished.
Then, turning to Lakamba, he begged him to rule justly during
his &mdash;Patalolo’s&mdash;absence There was a bit of play-acting
there. Lakamba said he was unworthy of the honourable burden,
and Patalolo insisted. Poor old fool! It must have been bitter
to him. They made him actually entreat that scoundrel. Fancy a
man compelled to beg of a robber to despoil him! But the old Rajah
was so frightened. Anyway, he did it, and Lakamba accepted at
last. Then Willems made a speech to the crowd. Said that on his
way to the west the Rajah&mdash;he meant Patalolo&mdash;would see the Great
White Ruler in Batavia and obtain his protection for Sambir. Meantime,
he went on, I, an Orang Blanda and your friend, hoist the flag
under the shadow of which there is safety. With that he ran up
a Dutch flag to the mast-head. It was made hurriedly, during the
night, of cotton stuffs, and, being heavy, hung down the mast,
while the crowd stared. Ali told me there was a great sigh of
surprise, but not a word was spoken till Lakamba advanced and
proclaimed in a loud voice that during all that day every one
passing by the flagstaff must uncover his head and salaam before
the emblem."</p>

<p>"But, hang it all!" exclaimed Lingard&mdash;"Abdulla is British!"</p>

<p>"Abdulla wasn’t there at all&mdash;did not go on shore that day. Yet
Ali, who has his wits about him, noticed that the space where
the crowd stood was under the guns of the Lord of the Isles. They
had put a coir warp ashore, and gave the barque a cant in the
current, so as to bring the broadside to bear on the flagstaff.
Clever! Eh? But nobody dreamt of resistance. When they recovered
from the surprise there was a little quiet jeering; and Bahassoen
abused Lakamba violently till one of Lakamba’s men hit him on
the head with a staff. Frightful crack, I am told. Then they left
off jeering. Meantime Patalolo went away, and Lakamba sat in the
chair at the foot of the flagstaff, while the crowd surged around,
as if they could not make up their minds to go. Suddenly there
was a great noise behind Lakamba’s chair. It was that woman, who
went for Willems. Ali says she was like a wild beast, but he twisted
her wrist and made her grovel in the dust. Nobody knows exactly
what it was about. Some say it was about that flag. He carried
her off, flung her into a canoe, and went on board Abdulla’s ship.
After that Sahamin was the first to salaam to the flag. Others
followed suit. Before noon everything was quiet in the settlement,
and Ali came back and told me all this."</p>

<p>Almayer drew a long breath. Lingard stretched out his legs.</p>

<p>"Go on!" he said.</p>

<p>Almayer seemed to struggle with himself. At last he spluttered
out:</p>

<p>"The hardest is to tell yet. The most unheard-of thing! An outrage!
A fiendish outrage!"</p>
