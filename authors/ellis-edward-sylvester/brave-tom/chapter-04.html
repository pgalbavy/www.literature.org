<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Jim Travers felt that he was lost. The women uttered cries of
anguish, clasped their hands, and almost fainted.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, a person instinctively does the best thing
possible, when, if he took time for thought, he would do the worst.</p>

<p>The antipathy of wild beasts to fire is well known, but it must
be remembered that the full degree of this terror is felt only
during the darkness of night. The sun was in the horizon when
the stirring events we have set out to narrate were going on.</p>

<p>When Jim came tumbling through the window, he held fast to the
blazing torch, even while trying to save himself from falling.
His dexterity enabled him to keep fair command of his limbs, and
he bounded to his feet in a twinkling, at the moment when he expected
Tippo Sahib to come down upon him like a clawing avalanche.</p>

<p>Then, instead of turning about and clambering back through the
window (the surest means of inviting the attack of the beast),
he uttered a shout, and, holding the torch in front, ran straight
at the tiger!</p>

<p>It may be doubted whether the fiercest of wild creatures would
have withstood such an assault. Even though the sun was shining,
the tiger knew something of the meaning of that glowing brand.
Wheeling about like a cat, he trotted off, turning his head from
side to side, and frequently glancing at his pursuer.</p>

<p>His flight brought him into the field of vision of Tom Gordon
up-stairs, who had been mystified to understand what was going
on below.</p>

<p>"I'll finish him this time," was his conclusion, as he flung
up the window, thrust the barrel of the weapon through, and dropped
on one knee.</p>

<p>But it seemed as if fate held that particular royal Bengal tiger
in its special keeping that day. Before Tom could make his aim
certain, Jim Travers popped in front, so in line with the beast
that the young marksman could not fire at one without risk of
hitting the other.</p>

<p>"I daresen't do it," he decided, leaning his gun against the
wall beside him; "I'm afeard of hitting Jim."</p>

<p>Although the latter had displayed an extraordinary degree of
coolness at a critical point in the events, it must not be supposed
that he possessed any unusual share of courage. It was his implicit
faith in the blazing torch that inspired him to a daring that
few men would have shown; but on the outside he lost his head.</p>

<p>He was hardly conscious of what he was doing when he sat off
after the fleeing animal, and there's no saying what the end would
have been, or rather there's no doubt that he would have feared
ill, had not Tom called to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come back, Jim! Your torch will soon go out, and then he'll
have you sure!"</p>

<p>"Golly! that's so!" muttered Jim, stopping like a flash, and
dashing for the house again; "I didn't think of that!"</p>

<p>Good Mrs. Gordon and Aunt Cynthia had recovered in a degree their
senses. Unspeakably shocked by the peril of the youth, whose courage
they estimated too highly, they shrank from no risk that could
aid his final escape. They had not closed the shutter after his
mishap, and, when they saw him wheel and run back, they stood
by the window ready to receive him.</p>

<p>Jim Travers was a good runner; and when it is stated that he
was certain Tippo Sahib was skurrying at his heels, it need not
be added that he "surpassed himself" in the way of fleetness.
Finding, after running a short way, that the beast was not after
him, Jim flung aside the torch and went through the window like
a cannon shot, rolling over and striking the other side of the
room before his flight was checked. A lad of his years, however,
rarely suffers from hard knocks and bumps, and he was on his feet
the next moment.</p>

<p>"Shet the window quick!" he called, "or he'll be in here."</p>

<p>No need of the appeal, for the mother with deft fingers quickly
secured the shutter as before; and but for the lamp, all would
have been in darkness again.</p>

<p>Jim darted up-stairs to learn how his playmate was making out.</p>

<p>"Why don't you shoot, Tom?" he called, hurrying to his side.</p>

<p>"'Cause I don't see anything to shoot at," was the answer.</p>

<p>"What's become of the tiger?"</p>

<p>"I guess you scared him off."</p>

<p>Jim peeped cautiously out of the window.</p>

<p>"That's so; he isn't anywhere round, but he was out there a few
minutes ago."</p>

<p>"So was you; but you aren't there now."</p>

<p>"I thought he chased me clean up to the winder."</p>

<p>"He didn't foller you a single step; when you struck out for
the window, he stopped short and laughed ready to die to see you
run."</p>

<p>"The tiger laughed at me!" exclaimed Jim angrily; "who ever heard
of such a thing?"</p>

<p>"Well, he looked as though he wanted to laugh, and then trotted
down the road; I seen him jump over the fence and make for the
woods."</p>

<p>"That's where he's gone! I guess I'll go home now, while I have
the chance."</p>

<p>"Better wait, Jim, till you're sure he isn't round."</p>

<p>Jim followed this sensible advice, staying to supper, to which
he was always welcome.</p>

<p>The women had received so great a shock, that they could not
recover from it as quickly as the volatile youngsters. The shutters
and doors were kept fastened, and every few minutes they peeped
out in quest of the tiger that showed so much enmity toward them.
When darkness closed in, however, not the first glimpse had been
caught of him, and all began to hope he had taken his final departure.
Mrs. Gordon gave her consent that Jimmy Travers should start homeward;
and, promising to keep a sharp lookout for the creature, he departed.
It may as well be added that he saw nothing more of Tippo Sahib,
nor did the animal pay any visit to his home.</p>

<p>"<em>Helloa! the house there!</em>"</p>

<p>This was the startling summons that rang out in the stillness
of the night, about two hours after the departure of Jimmy Travers.
Mrs. Gordon stepped to the door, and with some misgiving drew
it open. The full moon was shining brightly, and she saw two horsemen
who had halted in the highway opposite the gate.</p>

<p>"Good-evening!" said the spokesman, lifting his hat in salutation
when he observed the woman; "have you seen anything of a strange
animal in this neighborhood, madam? We have traced him almost
to this spot, but have lost track of him."</p>

<p>"Do you refer to the tiger that escaped from the menagerie this
afternoon?"</p>

<p>"That's the animal we're looking for."</p>

<p>"Yes; he was here late in the afternoon, and tried to jump through
the window."</p>

<p>"Did he hurt any one?" asked the man in alarm.</p>

<p>"No; we did not receive a scratch. My son shot him."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the other; "did he kill the animal?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," answered Mrs. Gordon (who was joined by Aunt Cynthia
and Tom), smiling at the fear of the visitors; "my boy is quite
young, and isn't much of a marksman; he thinks he hit the beast"&mdash;</p>

<p>"And I did too," interjected the lad, not pleased with this slur
upon his skill with the gun.</p>

<p>"Possibly he did; but he was not injured much."</p>

<p>"I am glad to learn that. The tiger is one of the most valuable
animals we have in the menagerie; I should be very sorry to lose
him."</p>

<p>"But," interposed Aunt Cynthia, "it may become necessary to shoot
him in self-defense."</p>

<p>"Not likely; he is not apt to injure any one if he is let alone."</p>

<p>Tom had not forgotten the appalling stories told by Jim Travers
on his arrival from the exhibition.</p>

<p>"I heered he chawed up Sam Harper, Jack Habersham, Bill Dunham,
and a whole lot of folks that was at the circus."</p>

<p>The laughter of the two horsemen was hearty.</p>

<p>"Those youngsters are alive and well. The boy who punched the
tiger in the eye, and caused all this rumpus, was knocked down
and scratched somewhat, but not half as much as he deserved. No
one else, so far as we can learn, has been injured; though, as
I remarked just now, Tippo Sahib will fight if he is driven into
a corner."</p>

<p>"He tried to jump through our window," said Aunt Cynthia.</p>

<p>"Before or after you fired at him?"</p>

<p>"Afterward."</p>

<p>"I suppose it was caused by the hullabaloo of the people, frightened
out of their wits. It is the same as when a hue and cry is raised
about a dog. If he isn't mad, he will soon become so. But, madam,
we are very anxious to secure the animal before he is killed or
seriously injured. We will pay a good reward for his recapture."</p>

<p>"How much?" asked Tom, to the surprise of his relatives.</p>

<p>"One hundred dollars to any one who will secure him without injury,
or fixes it so we can recapture him. May I ask where the tiger
seemed to be going when you last saw him?"</p>

<p>"The last we seen of him," replied Tom, "he was cutting 'cross
the field toward the woods over yonder."</p>

<p>Thanking the boy and the ladies for their information, the horsemen
rode off, soon disappearing up the highway.</p>

<p>The fact that these men, experienced in their knowledge of wild
animals, were searching for the escaped tiger, naturally lifted
much of the fear of the beast from the hearts of the Gordon family.
They believed the keepers would recapture him before he could
do much harm in the community. They were convinced, too, that
they were not the only ones looking for him.</p>

<p>The shutters of all the windows were never more carefully barred
than before the three inmates retired to their beds.</p>

<p>Tom Gordon, being a rugged, healthy boy, generally passed the
night in refreshing slumber. Not a trace of the ague which kept
him from the circus showed itself in his system when he went up-stairs
to his room; but, somehow or other, after he lay down he could
not sleep.</p>

<p>No doubt the excitement through which he had gone so wrought
upon his nerves as to drive away all drowsiness; but the thought
that was running through his brain found expression in the words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A hundred dollars! What a fortune that is! It would make us
comfortable for life. I wonder if there is any way of catching
Tippo Sahib before the men find him.</p>

<p>"I don't believe there's anything in what Jim said about looking
the creature in the eye. S'pose I should meet him in the woods,
and fix him that way, what good would it do? I'd have to stand
there till the keepers come along, and they might not do that
for a week or two. By that time I'd be starved to death, and so
would the tiger, and they want him alive.</p>

<p>"Jim must be mistaken, too, 'bout shooting off his tail. Jim
and me haven't got any tails, and we don't have any trouble in
walking. I can't see how it would make any difference with the
tiger, either. I wonder where Jim got all them ideas, &mdash;I
guess where he got the stories 'bout so many people being chawed
up."</p>

<p>The lad lay for a while on one side, and then flung himself on
the other. Several times he was on the point of dropping into
an uneasy slumber, but some slight noise always came at the critical
moment to make him wider awake than he was in the first instance.</p>

<p>What is more disturbing than the occasional rattle of a window
sash when we are trying to woo sleep? By and by Tom discovered
it was that which had played the mischief with his rest. He sprang
impatiently out of bed, and hurried to the window, with the intention
of righting matters.</p>

<p>The bright moon shining from an unclouded sky made it almost
as light as day. He stood a minute, looking out upon the beautiful
scene; for, young as he was, he could not fail to be impressed
by the striking loveliness of everything out-doors.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether they've catched Tippo Sahib"&mdash;</p>

<p>The lad caught his breath, for just then he saw something moving
in the shadow of the woodshed. A second look showed it to be some
sort of quadruped, and the third&mdash;could he believe his eyes?&mdash;revealed
the tiger himself!</p>

<p>Yes, it was the terrible brute and no mistake. The boy rubbed
his eyes and looked again. Some unaccountable attraction seemed
to have brought Tippo Sahib back to the dwelling where he had
met with so interesting an experience that afternoon.</p>

<p>But all this being so, Tom Gordon might well ask himself what
good the presence of the animal promised to be to him. Hitherto,
he and his friends had counted themselves lucky in being able
to keep out of his way when he showed a desire to explore the
interior of the house. How, then, could he expect to get the hundred
dollars offered for the capture of the brute?</p>

<p>Mingled with the eager wish of the lad to earn the munificent
sum, was a slight misgiving as to the meaning of this return of
the tiger. Having eluded the men sent after him, had he come back
to revenge himself upon those who had treated him so ill?</p>

<p>This discomforting thought was dissipated by the action of Tippo
Sahib. He did not move around as on his former visit, but seemed
to be prowling about the woodshed, as if in quest of something.
Surely he would not act thus if he meditated an attack upon the
inmates of the home!</p>

<p>But Tom had learned from his aunt and mother that if the tiger
chose, he could readily leap from the ground to the windows of
the upper story, and, therefore, would have little difficulty
in entering, if he was bent on doing so.</p>

<p>"I'll get my gun, so as to be ready to shoot him. But if I shoot
him, I won't get the reward that was promised; but it's better
to kill him than to have him chaw us to pieces."</p>

<p>Just then the animal worked his way round the corner of the structure,
out of the shadow, into the bright moonlight. He showed no interest
in the house itself, but confined his attention to the woodshed,&mdash;a
fact which lessened the lad's fear, and held him at the window,
closely watching the beast.</p>

<p>His change of location brought him to the front of the strong
wooden building, and near the partially open door.</p>

<p>The heart of the lad gave a great bound.</p>

<p>"S'pose he goes inside, and I slip up and shut him in!"</p>

<p>All the indications pointed to the tiger entering the structure,
though it was impossible to imagine his purpose, unless he scented
the waste food kept there in a barrel for the pigs belonging to
the Widow Gordon.</p>

<p>The attempt the lad had in mind involved a fearful risk; for
there could be no doubt that if the beast detected him, he would
make him serve for supper.</p>

<p>Probably if Tom had been given a few more minutes to think over
the matter, he would have abandoned the design in his mind; but
that one hundred dollars looked as big to him as a million does
to most people. Hastily drawing on his trousers, he began stealthily
descending the stairs. Fortunately for him, his aunt and mother
were asleep, else they would have put an emphatic veto on his
foolhardy scheme. The bolts of the door were softly slid back,
the door itself silently drawn inward an inch or two, and the
lad peeped out. His position gave a full view of the front of
the woodshed, and the sight was an interesting one. The tiger
had partially entered. Indeed, little was seen more than his tail,
which, projecting from the darkness of the structure, swayed slowly
from side to side, as if he had detected something not altogether
pleasing.</p>

<p>"If he goes in, I'll slip out and hook the door; but, if he comes
back, it won't do to let him see me."</p>

<p>This was the thought that stirred Tom Gordon, as he peered stealthily
out of the crack made by the door. Could he have thought of any
way by which to drive the tiger inside, he would have done so;
but there was none. He could only wait and watch, and hope for
a favorable issue of the undertaking.</p>

<p>It struck him as strange that the beast should stand so long
with only his tail in the outer air. The lad fancied it had disappeared
entirely; but at the moment he was about to slip forward, he detected
the tuft agitating the chips and dirt about the entrance. He therefore
held back and still watched and waited.</p>

<p>There! the brute must have taken another step farther, for no
part of his appendage was visible. He was wholly within the shed.</p>

<p>It was now or never.</p>

<p>Tom left the door open a few inches, so that if he should find
it necessary to retreat, he would meet with no trouble in re-entering
his home. In that event, however, it wasn't likely Tippo Sahib
would meet with any trouble in following him.</p>

<p>The heart of the youth throbbed violently when he stepped out
in the moonlight and comprehended the perilous nature of the business.</p>

<p>"If he comes out tail first," was his thought, "I'll have a chance
to dodge him; but if he comes head first, I'll be a goner."</p>

<p>He was not idle while these imaginings were passing through his
mind. Step by step, and on tiptoe, he stole forward, until he
stood within a couple of paces of the fastening. Then it was that
his courage almost deserted him, and the desire to turn about
and make a dash for the door behind him was well-nigh irresistible.</p>

<p>But the thought of that magnificent hundred dollars restrained
and nerved him to push on. Another step and he had but to lean
forward with outstretched arm, seize the door, and snap it toward
him. He was in the act of doing so, when he heard a guttural growl
from within. Had this reached his ears when he was a few feet
farther off, Tom would have turned and fled for life. He would
have done so now but for his belief that it was too late. He could
only save himself by shutting that door before the beast came
through it.</p>

<p>Holding his breath, the lad seized the handle, and with a quick
flirt drew the door toward him. The strong iron hook was slipped
into the staple, and he had done all he could. Yielding then to
the panic which had been struggling so long within him, he bounded
upon the front porch, shot through the door, and closed and fastened
it in a twinkling. Not even then did Tom feel safe, but bounded
up-stairs with so much haste and noise, that the wonder was he
did not awaken his aunt and mother. They slept too soundly, however,
to be disturbed.</p>

<p>He ran to the window of his bedroom, and looked out again, fearing
that the royal prisoner had already freed himself and would proceed
to punish the one that had taken such liberties with him. Strange
to say, everything looked as if there was no tiger within a score
of miles. The door of the woodshed was fastened as it had been
many times; but no noise or disturbance, so far as the lad could
judge, sounded from within the structure. The prisoner seemed
to have accepted his misfortune philosophically, and, perhaps,
had lain down to rest himself after his stirring experiences of
the afternoon.</p>

<p>"I wonder if he can get out of there. It's pretty strong, and
there isn't any back-door or window that he can use."</p>

<p>The youth was so deeply interested in the question that he brought
his chair beside the window and sat down to await results. It
was not strange, perhaps, considering the lateness of the hour,
that the sleep which he had long sought in vain now came to him.
By and by his head began nodding, and, despite the cramped position,
he slumbered soundly until awakened by the call of his mother.</p>

<p>As soon as Tom could collect his senses, he looked at the woodshed.
So far as he saw, no change had taken place. Then he hurried down-stairs
and told the astounding tidings.</p>

<p>"Mercy!" gasped Aunt Cynthia, "I was just about going to the
shed for some wood, you were so long coming down. Suppose I had!"</p>

<p>"It would have been all over with you," replied Tom, hardly less
startled than they; "I meant to stay awake all night, but forgot
myself."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has got out," suggested the mother; "I don't understand
why he has kept so quiet."</p>

<p>While they were talking, a call came from the roadway again.
When they looked out, four horsemen were seen.</p>

<p>"We find it impossible to locate that beast," explained the one
that had done the talking the night before; "I hardly suppose
you have seen anything more of him."</p>

<p>Before Mrs. Gordon or Aunt Cynthia could reply, Tom asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Did you say you would give a hundred dollars to any one that
gets that tiger without hurting him?"</p>

<p>"We'll be glad to do that, sonny, or if he will show us where
he is so we can capture him."</p>

<p>"Will you give a hundred dollars to have him in the woodshed
there?"</p>

<p>"Indeed we will."</p>

<p>"Very well; <em>he's there!</em>"</p>
