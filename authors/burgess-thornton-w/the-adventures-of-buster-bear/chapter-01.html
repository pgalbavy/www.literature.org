<p>Buster Bear yawned as he lay on his comfortable bed of leaves
and watched the first early morning sunbeams creeping through
the Green Forest to chase out the Black Shadows. Once more he
yawned, and slowly got to his feet and shook himself. Then he
walked over to a big pine-tree, stood up on his hind legs, reached
as high up on the trunk of the tree as he could, and scratched
the bark with his great claws. After that he yawned until it seemed
as if his jaws would crack, and then sat down to think what he
wanted for breakfast.</p>

<p>While he sat there, trying to make up his mind what would taste
best, he was listening to the sounds that told of the waking of
all the little people who live in the Green Forest. He heard Sammy
Jay way off in the distance screaming, "Thief! Thief!" and grinned.
"I wonder," thought Buster, "if some one has stolen Sammy's breakfast,
or if he has stolen the breakfast of some one else. Probably he
is the thief himself."</p>

<p>He heard Chatterer the Red Squirrel scolding as fast as he could
make his tongue go and working himself into a terrible rage. "Must
be that Chatterer got out of bed the wrong way this morning,"
thought he.</p>

<p>He heard Blacky the Crow cawing at the top of his lungs, and
he knew by the sound that Blacky was getting into mischief of
some kind. He heard the sweet voices of happy little singers,
and they were good to hear. But most of all he listened to a merry,
low, silvery laugh that never stopped but went on and on, until
he just felt as if he must laugh too. It was the voice of the
Laughing Brook. And as Buster listened it suddenly came to him
just what he wanted for breakfast.</p>

<p>"I'm going fishing," said he in his deep grumbly-rumbly voice
to no one in particular. "Yes, Sir, I'm going fishing. I want
some fat trout for my breakfast."</p>

<p>He shuffled along over to the Laughing Brook, and straight to
a little pool of which he knew, and as he drew near he took the
greatest care not to make the teeniest, weeniest bit of noise.
Now it just happened that early as he was, some one was before
Buster Bear. When he came in sight of the little pool, who should
he see but another fisherman there, who had already caught a fine
fat trout. Who was it? Why, Little Joe Otter to be sure. He was
just climbing up the bank with the fat trout in his mouth. Buster
Bear's own mouth watered as he saw it. Little Joe sat down on
the bank and prepared to enjoy his breakfast. He hadn't seen Buster
Bear, and he didn't know that he or any one else was anywhere
near.</p>

<p>Buster Bear tiptoed up very softly until he was right behind
Little Joe Otter. "Woof, woof!" said he in his deepest, most grumbly-rumbly
voice. "That's a very fine looking trout. I wouldn't mind if I
had it myself."</p>

<p>Little Joe Otter gave a frightened squeal and without even turning
to see who was speaking dropped his fish and dived headfirst into
the Laughing Brook. Buster Bear sprang forward and with one of
his big paws caught the fat trout just as it was slipping back
into the water.</p>

<p>"Here's your trout, Mr. Otter," said he, as Little Joe put his
head out of water to see who had frightened him so. "Come and
get it."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Here's your trout, Mr. Otter," said he. <em>Page

<p>But Little Joe wouldn't. The fact is, he was afraid to. He snarled
at Buster Bear and called him a thief and everything bad he could
think of. Buster didn't seem to mind. He chuckled as if he thought
it all a great joke and repeated his invitation to Little Joe
to come and get his fish. But Little Joe just turned his back
and went off down the Laughing Brook in a great rage.</p>

<p>"It's too bad to waste such a fine fish," said Buster thoughtfully.
"I wonder what I'd better do with it." And while he was wondering,
he ate it all up. Then he started down the Laughing Brook to try
to catch some for himself.</p>
