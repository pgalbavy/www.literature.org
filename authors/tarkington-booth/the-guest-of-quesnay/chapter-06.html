<p>No doubt the most absurd thing I could have done after the departure
of Professor Keredec and his singular friend would have been to
settle myself before my canvas again with the intention of painting&mdash;and
that is what I did. At least, I resumed my camp-stool and went
through some of the motions habitually connected with the act
of painting.</p>

<p>I remember that the first time in my juvenile reading I came
upon the phrase, "seated in a brown study," I pictured my hero
in a brown chair, beside a brown table, in a room hung with brown
paper. Later, being enlightened, I was ambitious to display the
figure myself, but the uses of ordinary correspondence allowed
the occasion for it to remain unoffered. Let me not only seize
upon the present opportunity but gild it, for the adventure of
the afternoon left me in a study which was, at its mildest, a
profound purple.</p>

<p>The confession has been made of my curiosity concerning my fellow-lodgers
at Les Trois Pigeons; however, it had been comparatively a torpid
growth; my meeting with them served to enlarge it so suddenly
and to such proportions that I wonder it did not strangle me.
In fine, I sat there brush-paddling my failure like an automaton,
and saying over and over aloud, "What is wrong with him? What
is wrong with him?"</p>

<p>This was the sillier inasmuch as the word "wrong" (bearing any
significance of a darkened mind) had not the slightest application
to "that other monsieur." There had been neither darkness nor
dullness; his eyes, his expression, his manner, betrayed no hint
of wildness; rather they bespoke a quick and amiable intelligence&mdash;the
more amazing that he had shown himself ignorant of things a child
of ten would know. Amedee and his fellows of Les Trois Pigeons
had judged wrongly of his nationality; his face was of the lean,
right, American structure; but they had hit the relation between
the two men: Keredec was the master and "that other monsieur"
the scholar&mdash;a pupil studying boys' textbooks and receiving instruction
in matters and manners that children are taught. And yet I could
not believe him to be a simple case of arrested development. For
the matter of that, I did not like to think of him as a "case"
at all. There had been something about his bright youthfulness&mdash;perhaps
it was his quick contrition for his rudeness, perhaps it was a
certain wistful quality he had, perhaps it was his very "singularity"&mdash;which
appealed as directly to my liking as it did urgently to my sympathy.</p>

<p>I came out of my vari-coloured study with a start, caused by
the discovery that I had absent-mindedly squeezed upon my palette
the entire contents of an expensive tube of cobalt violet, for
which I had no present use; and sighing (for, of necessity, I
am an economical man), I postponed both of my problems till another
day, determined to efface the one with a palette knife and a rag
soaked in turpentine, and to defer the other until I should know
more of my fellow-lodgers at Madame Brossard's.</p>

<p>The turpentine rag at least proved effective; I scoured away
the last tokens of my failure with it, wishing that life were
like the canvas and that men had knowledge of the right celestial
turpentine. After that I cleaned my brushes, packed and shouldered
my kit, and, with a final imprecation upon all sausage-sandwiches,
took up my way once more to Les Trois Pigeons.</p>

<p>Presently I came upon an intersecting path where, on my previous
excursions, I had always borne to the right; but this evening,
thinking to discover a shorter cut, I went straight ahead. Striding
along at a good gait and chanting sonorously, "On Linden when
the sun was low," I left the rougher boscages of the forest behind
me and emerged, just at sunset, upon an orderly fringe of woodland
where the ground was neat and unencumbered, and the trimmed trees
stood at polite distances, bowing slightly to one another with
small, well-bred rustlings.</p>

<p>The light was somewhere between gold and pink when I came into
this lady's boudoir of a grove. "Isar flowing rapidly" ceased
its tumult abruptly, and Linden saw no sterner sight that evening:
my voice and my feet stopped simultaneously&mdash;for I stood upon
Quesnay ground.</p>

<p>Before me stretched a short broad avenue of turf, leading to
the chateau gates. These stood open, a gravelled driveway climbing
thence by easy stages between kempt shrubberies to the crest of
the hill, where the gray roof and red chimney-pots of the chateau
were glimpsed among the tree-tops. The slope was terraced with
strips of flower-gardens and intervals of sward; and against the
green of a rising lawn I marked the figure of a woman, pausing
to bend over some flowering bush. The figure was too slender to
be mistaken for that of the present chatelaine of Quesnay: in
Miss Elizabeth's regal amplitude there was never any hint of fragility.
The lady upon the slope, then, I concluded, must be Madame d'Armand,
the inspiration of Amedee's "Monsieur has much to live for!"</p>

<p>Once more this day I indorsed that worthy man's opinion, for,
though I was too far distant to see clearly, I knew that roses
trimmed Madame d'Armand's white hat, and that she had passed me,
no long time since, in the forest.</p>

<p>I took off my cap.</p>

<p>"I have the honour to salute you," I said aloud. "I make my apologies
for misbehaving with sandwiches and camp-stools in your presence,
Madame d'Armand."</p>

<p>Something in my own pronunciation of her name struck me as reminiscent:
save for the prefix, it had sounded like "Harman," as a Frenchman
might pronounce it.</p>

<p>Foreign names involve the French in terrible difficulties. Hughes,
an English friend of mine, has lived in France some five-and-thirty
years without reconciling himself to being known as "Monsieur
Ig."</p>

<p>"Armand" might easily be Jean Ferret's translation of "Harman."
Had he and Amedee in their admiration conferred the prefix because
they considered it a plausible accompaniment to the lady's gentle
bearing? It was not impossible; it was, I concluded, very probable.</p>

<p>I had come far out of my way, so I retraced my steps to the intersection
of the paths, and thence made for the inn by my accustomed route.
The light failed under the roofing of foliage long before I was
free of the woods, and I emerged upon the road to Les Trois Pigeons
when twilight had turned to dusk.</p>

<p>Not far along the road from where I came into it, stood an old,
brown, deep-thatched cottage&mdash;a branch of brushwood over the door
prettily beckoning travellers to the knowledge that cider was
here for the thirsty; and as I drew near I perceived that one
availed himself of the invitation. A group stood about the open
door, the lamp-light from within disclosing the head of the house
filling a cup for the wayfarer; while honest Mere Baudry and two
generations of younger Baudrys clustered to miss no word of the
interchange of courtesies between Pere Baudry and his chance patron.</p>

<p>It afforded me some surprise to observe that the latter was a
most mundane and elaborate wayfarer, indeed; a small young man
very lightly made, like a jockey, and point-device in khaki, puttees,
pongee cap, white-and-green stock, a knapsack on his back, and
a bamboo stick under his arm; altogether equipped to such a high
point of pedestrianism that a cynical person might have been reminded
of loud calls for wine at some hostelry in the land of opera bouffe.
He was speaking fluently, though with a detestable accent, in
a rough-and-ready, pick-up dialect of Parisian slang, evidently
under the pleasant delusion that he employed the French language,
while Pere Baudry contributed his share of the conversation in
a slow patois. As both men spoke at the same time and neither
understood two consecutive words the other said, it struck me
that the dialogue might prove unproductive of any highly important
results this side of Michaelmas; therefore, discovering that the
very pedestrian gentleman was making some sort of inquiry concerning
Les Trois Pigeons, I came to a halt and proffered aid.</p>

<p>"Are you looking for Madame Brossard's?" I asked in English.</p>

<p>The traveller uttered an exclamation and faced about with a jump,
birdlike for quickness. He did not reply to my question with the
same promptness; however, his deliberation denoted scrutiny, not
sloth. He stood peering at me sharply until I repeated it. Even
then he protracted his examination of me, a favour I was unable
to return with any interest, owing to the circumstance of his
back being toward the light. Nevertheless, I got a clear enough
impression of his alert, well-poised little figure, and of a hatchety
little face, and a pair of shrewd little eyes, which (I thought)
held a fine little conceit of his whole little person. It was
a type of fellow-countryman not altogether unknown about certain
"American Bars" of Paris, and usually connected (more or less
directly) with what is known to the people of France as "le Sport."</p>

<p>"Say," he responded in a voice of unpleasant nasality, finally
deciding upon speech, "you're 'Nummeric'n, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I returned. "I thought I heard you inquiring for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, m' friend, you can sting me!" he interrupted with condescending
jocularity. "My style French does f'r them camels up in Paris
all right. ME at Nice, Monte Carlo, Chantilly&mdash;bow to the p'fess'r;
he's <em>RIGHT! </em>But down here I don't seem to be <em>GUD
</em>enough f'r these sheep-dogs; anyway they bark different.
I'm lukkin' fer a hotel called Les Trois Pigeons."</p>

<p>"I am going there," I said; "I will show you the way."</p>

<p>"Whur is't?" he asked, not moving.</p>

<p>I pointed to the lights of the inn, flickering across the fields.
"Yonder&mdash;beyond the second turn of the road," I said, and, as
he showed no signs of accompanying me, I added, "I am rather late."</p>

<p>"Oh, I ain't goin' there t'night. It's too dark t' see anything
now," he remarked, to my astonishment. "Dives and the choo-choo
back t' little ole Trouville f'r mine! I on'y wanted to take a
<em>LUK </em>at this pigeon-house joint."</p>

<p>"Do you mind my inquiring," I said, "what you expected to see
at Les Trois Pigeons?"</p>

<p>"Why!" he exclaimed, as if astonished at the question, "I'm a
tourist. Makin' a pedestrun trip t' all the reg'ler sights." And,
inspired to eloquence, he added, as an afterthought: "As it were."</p>

<p>"A tourist?" I echoed, with perfect incredulity.</p>

<p>"That's whut I am, m' friend," he returned firmly. "You don't
have to have a red dope-book in one hand and a thoid-class choo-choo
ticket in the other to be a tourist, do you?"</p>

<p>"But if you will pardon me," I said, "where did you get the notion
that Les Trois Pigeons is one of the regular sights?"</p>

<p>"Ain't it in all the books?"</p>

<p>"I don't think that it is mentioned in any of the guide-books."</p>

<p>"NO! I didn't say it <em>WAS, </em>m' friend," he retorted with
contemptuous pity. "I mean them history-books. It's in all o'
<em>THEM</em>!"</p>

<p>"This is strange news," said I. "I should be very much interested
to read them!"</p>

<p>"Lookahere," he said, taking a step nearer me; "in oinest now,
on your woid: Didn' more'n half them Jeanne d'Arc tamales live
at that hotel wunst?"</p>

<p>"Nobody of historical importance&mdash;or any other kind of importance,
so far as I know&mdash;ever lived there," I informed him. "The older
portions of the inn once belonged to an ancient farm-house, that
is all."</p>

<p>"On the level," he demanded, "didn't that William the Conker
nor <em>NONE </em>o' them ancient gilt-edges live there?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Stung again!" He broke into a sudden loud cackle of laughter.
"Why! the feller tole me 'at this here Pigeon place was all three
rings when it come t' history. Yessir! Tall, thin feller he was,
in a three-button cutaway, English make, and kind of red-complected,
with a sandy <em>MUS-</em>tache," pursued the pedestrian, apparently
fearing his narrative might lack colour. "I met him right comin'
out o' the Casino at Trouville, yes'day aft'noon; c'udn' a' b'en
more'n four o'clock&mdash;hol' on though, yes 'twas, 'twas nearer five,
about twunty minutes t' five, say&mdash;an' this feller tells me&mdash;"
He cackled with laughter as palpably disingenuous as the corroborative
details he thought necessary to muster, then he became serious,
as if marvelling at his own wondrous verdancy. "M' friend, that
feller soitn'y found me easy. But he can't say I ain't game; he
passes me the limes, but I'm jest man enough to drink his health
fer it in this sweet, sound ole-fashioned cider 'at ain't got
a headache in a barrel of it. He played me <em>GUD, </em>and here's
TO him!"</p>

<p>Despite the heartiness of the sentiment, my honest tourist's
enthusiasm seemed largely histrionic, and his quaffing of the
beaker too reminiscent of drain-the-wine-cup-free in the second
row of the chorus, for he absently allowed it to dangle from his
hand before raising it to his lips. However, not all of its contents
was spilled, and he swallowed a mouthful of the sweet, sound,
old-fashioned cider&mdash;but by mistake, I was led to suppose, from
the expression of displeasure which became so deeply marked upon
his countenance as to be noticeable, even in the feeble lamplight.</p>

<p>I tarried no longer, but bidding this good youth and the generations
of Baudry good-night, hastened on to my belated dinner.</p>

<p>"Amedee," I said, when my cigar was lighted and the usual hour
of consultation had arrived; "isn't that old lock on the chest
where Madame Brossard keeps her silver getting rather rusty?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur, we have no thieves here. We are out of the world."</p>

<p>"Yes, but Trouville is not so far away."</p>

<p>"Truly."</p>

<p>"Many strange people go to Trouville: grand-dukes, millionaires,
opera singers, princes, jockeys, gamblers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Truly, truly!"</p>

<p>"And tourists," I finished.</p>

<p>"That is well known," assented Amedee, nodding.</p>

<p>"It follows," I continued with the impressiveness of all logicians,
"that many strange people may come from Trouville. In their excursions
to the surrounding points of interest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eh, monsieur, but that is true!" he interrupted, laying his
right forefinger across the bridge of his nose, which was his
gesture when he remembered anything suddenly. "There was a strange
monsieur from Trouville here this very day."</p>

<p>"What kind of person was he?"</p>

<p>"A foreigner, but I could not tell from what country."</p>

<p>"What time of day was he here?" I asked, with growing interest.</p>

<p>"Toward the middle of the afternoon. I was alone, except for
Glouglou, when he came. He wished to see the whole house and I
showed him what I could, except of course monsieur's pavilion,
and the Grande Suite. Monsieur the Professor and that other monsieur
had gone to the forest, but I did not feel at liberty to exhibit
their rooms without Madame Brossard's permission, and she was
spending the day at Dives. Besides," added the good man, languidly
snapping a napkin at a moth near one of the candles, "the doors
were locked."</p>

<p>"This person was a tourist?" I asked, after a pause during which
Amedee seemed peacefully unaware of the rather concentrated gaze
I had fixed upon him. "Of a kind. In speaking he employed many
peculiar expressions, more like a thief of a Parisian cabman than
of the polite world."</p>

<p>"The devil he did!" said I. "Did he tell you why he wished to
see the whole house? Did he contemplate taking rooms here?"</p>

<p>"No, monsieur, it appears that his interest was historical. At
first I should not have taken him for a man of learning, yet he
gave me a great piece of information; a thing quite new to me,
though I have lived here so many years. We are distinguished in
history, it seems, and at one time both William the Conqueror
and that brave Jeanne d'Arc&mdash;"</p>

<p>I interrupted sharply, dropping my cigar and leaning across the
table:</p>

<p>"How was this person dressed?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur, he was very much the pedestrian."</p>

<p>And so, for that evening, we had something to talk about besides
"that other monsieur"; indeed, we found our subject so absorbing
that I forgot to ask Amedee whether it was he or Jean Ferret who
had prefixed the "de" to "Armand."</p>
