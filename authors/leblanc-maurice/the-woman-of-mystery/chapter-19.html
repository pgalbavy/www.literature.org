<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The cellar, though smaller, looked like one of those large vaulted
basement halls which prevail in the Champagne district. Walls spotlessly
clean, a smooth floor with brick paths running across it, a warm
atmosphere, a curtained-off recess between two wine vats, chairs,
benches and rugs all went to form not only a comfortable abode, out of
the way of the shells, but also a safe refuge for any one who stood in
fear of indiscreet visits.
</p><p>Paul remembered the ruins of the old lighthouse on the bank of the Yser
and the tunnel from Ornequin to Èbrecourt. So the struggle was still
continuing underground: a war of trenches and cellars, a war of spying
and trickery, the same unvarying, stealthy, disgraceful, suspicious,
criminal methods.
</p><p>Paul had put out his lantern, and the room was now only dimly lit by an
oil lamp hanging from the ceiling, whose rays, thrown downward by an
opaque shade, cast a white circle in which the two of them stood by
themselves. Élisabeth and Bernard remained in the background, in the
shadow.
</p><p>The sergeant and his men had not appeared, but they could be heard at
the foot of the stairs.
</p><p>The countess did not move. She was dressed as on the evening of the
supper at Prince Conrad's villa. Her face showed no longer any fear or
alarm, but rather an effort of thought, as though she were trying to
calculate all the consequences of the position now revealed to her. Paul
Delroze? With what object was he attacking her? His intention--and this
was evidently the idea that gradually caused the Comtesse Hermine's
features to relax--his intention no doubt was to procure his wife's
liberty.
</p><p>She smiled. Élisabeth a prisoner in Germany: what a trump card for
herself, caught in a trap but still able to command events!
</p><p>At a sign from Paul, Bernard stepped forward and Paul said to the
countess:
</p><p>"My brother-in-law. Major Hermann, when he lay trussed up in the
ferryman's house, may have seen him, just as he may have seen me. But,
in any case, the Comtesse Hermine--or, to be more exact, the Comtesse
d'Andeville--does not know or at least has forgotten her son, Bernard
d'Andeville."
</p><p>She now seemed quite reassured, still wearing the air of one fighting
with equal or even more powerful weapons. She displayed no confusion at
the sight of Bernard, and said, in a careless tone:
</p><p>"Bernard d'Andeville is very like his sister Élisabeth, of whom
circumstances have allowed me to see a great deal lately. It is only
three days since she and I were having supper with Prince Conrad. The
prince is very fond of Élisabeth, and he is quite right, for she is
charming . . . and so amiable!"
</p><p>Paul and Bernard both made the same movement, which would have ended in
their flinging themselves upon the countess, if they had not succeeded
in restraining their hatred. Paul pushed aside his brother-in-law, of
whose intense anger he was conscious, and replied to his adversary's
challenge in an equally casual tone:
</p><p>"Yes, I know all about it; I was there. I was even present at her
departure. Your friend Karl offered me a seat in his car and we went off
to your place at Hildensheim: a very handsome castle, which I should
have liked to see more thoroughly. . . . But it is not a safe house to
stay at; in fact, it is often deadly; and so . . ."
</p><p>The countess looked at him with increasing disquiet. What did he mean to
convey? How did he know these things? She resolved to frighten him in
his turn, so as to gain some idea of the enemy's plans, and she said, in
a hard voice:
</p><p>"Yes, deadly is the word. The air there is not good for everybody."
</p><p>"A poisonous air."
</p><p>"Just so."
</p><p>"And are you nervous about Élisabeth?"
</p><p>"Frankly, yes. The poor thing's health is none of the best, as it is;
and I shall not be easy . . ."
</p><p>"Until she's dead, I suppose?"
</p><p>She waited a second or two and then retorted, speaking very clearly, so
that Paul might take in the meaning of her words:
</p><p>"Yes, until she is dead. . . . And that can't be far off . . . if it has
not happened already."
</p><p>There was a pause of some length. Once more, in the presence of that
woman, Paul felt the same craving to commit murder, the same craving to
gratify his hatred. She must be killed. It was his duty to kill her, it
was a crime not to obey that duty.
</p><p>Élisabeth was standing three paces back, in the dark. Slowly, without a
word, Paul turned in her direction, pressed the spring of his lantern
and flashed the light full on his wife's face.
</p><p>Not for a moment did he suspect the violent effect which his action
would have on the Comtesse Hermine. A woman like her was incapable of
making a mistake, of thinking herself the victim of an hallucination or
the dupe of a resemblance. No, she at once accepted the fact that Paul
had delivered his wife and that Élisabeth was standing in front of her.
But how was so disastrous an event possible? Élisabeth, whom three days
before she had left in Karl's hands; Élisabeth, who at this very moment
ought to be either dead or a prisoner in a German fortress, the access
to which was guarded by more than two million German soldiers: Élisabeth
was here! She had escaped Karl in less than three days! She had fled
from Hildensheim Castle and passed through the lines of those two
million Germans!
</p><p>The Comtesse Hermine sat down with distorted features at the table that
served her as a rampart and, in her fury, dug her clenched fists into
her cheeks. She realized the position. The time was past for jesting or
defiance. The time was past for bargaining. In the hideous game which
she was playing, the last chance of victory had suddenly slipped from
her grasp. She must yield before the conqueror; and that conqueror was
Paul Delroze.
</p><p>She stammered:
</p><p>"What do you propose to do? What is your object? To murder me?"
</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders:
</p><p>"We are not murderers. You are here to be tried. The penalty which you
will suffer will be the sentence passed upon you after a lawful trial,
in which you will be able to defend yourself."
</p><p>A shiver ran through her; and she protested:
</p><p>"You have no right to try me; you are not judges."
</p><p>At that moment there was a noise on the stairs. A voice cried:
</p><p>"Eyes front!"
</p><p>And, immediately after, the door, which had remained ajar, was flung
open, admitting three officers in their long cloaks.
</p><p>Paul hastened towards them and gave them chairs in that part of the room
which the light did not reach. A fourth arrived, who was also received
by Paul and took a seat to one side, a little farther away.
</p><p>Élisabeth and Paul were close together.
</p><p>Paul went back to his place in front and, standing beside the table,
said:
</p><p>"There are your judges. I am the prosecutor."
</p><p>And forthwith, without hesitation, as though he had settled beforehand
all the counts of the indictment which he was about to deliver, speaking
in a tone deliberately free from any trace of anger or hatred, he said:
</p><p>"You were born at Hildensheim Castle, of which your grandfather was the
steward. The castle was given to your father after the war of 1870. Your
name is really Hermine: Hermine von Hohenzollern. Your father used to
boast of that name of Hohenzollern, though he had no right to it; but
the extraordinary favor in which he stood with the old Emperor prevented
any one from contesting his claim. He served in the campaign of 1870 as
a colonel and distinguished himself by the most outrageous acts of
cruelty and rapacity. All the treasures that adorn Hildensheim Castle
come from France; and, to complete the brazenness of it, each object
bears a note giving the place from which it came and the name of the
owner from whom it was stolen. In addition, in the hall there is a
marble slab inscribed in letters of gold with the name of all the French
villages burnt by order of His Excellency Colonel Count Hohenzollern.
The Kaiser has often visited the castle. Each time he passes in front
of that marble slab he salutes."
</p><p>The countess listened without paying much heed. This story obviously
seemed to her of but indifferent importance. She waited until she
herself came into question.
</p><p>Paul continued:
</p><p>"You inherited from your father two sentiments which dominate your whole
existence. One of these is an immoderate love for the Hohenzollern
dynasty, with which your father appears to have been connected by the
hazard of an imperial or rather a royal whim. The other is a fierce and
savage hatred for France, which he regretted not to have injured as
deeply as he would have liked. Your love for the dynasty you
concentrated wholly, as soon as you had achieved womanhood, upon the man
who represents it now, so much so that, after entertaining the unlikely
hope of ascending the throne, you forgave him everything, even his
marriage, even his ingratitude, to devote yourself to him body and soul.
Married by him first to an Austrian prince, who died a mysterious death,
and then to a Russian prince, who died an equally mysterious death, you
worked solely for the greatness of your idol. At the time when war was
declared between England and the Transvaal, you were in the Transvaal.
At the time of the Russo-Japanese war, you were in Japan. You were
everywhere: at Vienna, when the Crown Prince Rudolph was assassinated;
at Belgrade when King Alexander and Queen Draga were assassinated. But
I will not linger over the part played by you in diplomatic events. It
is time that I came to your favorite occupation, the work which for the
last twenty years you have carried on against France."
</p><p>An expression of wickedness and almost of happiness distorted the
Comtesse Hermine's features. Yes, indeed, that was her favorite
occupation. She had devoted all her strength to it and all her perverse
intelligence.
</p><p>"And even so," added Paul, "I shall not linger over the gigantic work of
preparation and espionage which you directed. I have found one of your
accomplices, armed with a dagger bearing your initials, even in a
village of the Nord, in a church-steeple. All that happened was
conceived, organized and carried out by yourself. The proofs which I
collected, your correspondent's letters and your own letters, are
already in the possession of the court. But what I wish to lay special
stress upon is that part of your work which concerns the Château
d'Ornequin. It will not take long: a few facts, linked together by
murders, will be enough."
</p><p>There was a further silence. The countess prepared to listen with a sort
of anxious curiosity. Paul went on:
</p><p>"It was in 1894 that you suggested to the Emperor the piercing of a
tunnel from Èbrecourt to Corvigny. After the question had been studied
by the engineers, it was seen that this work, this '<u>kolossal</u>' work,
was not possible and could not be effective unless possession was first
obtained of the Château d'Ornequin. As it happened, the owner of the
property was in a very bad state of health. It was decided to wait. But,
as he seemed in no hurry to die, you came to Corvigny. A week later, he
died. Murder the first."
</p><p>"You lie! You lie!" cried the countess. "You have no proof. I defy you
to produce a proof."
</p><p>Paul, without replying, continued:
</p><p>"The château was put up for sale and, strange to say, without the least
advertisement, secretly, so to speak. Now what happened was that the man
of business whom you had instructed bungled the matter so badly that the
château was declared sold to the Comte d'Andeville, who took up his
residence there in the following year, with his wife and his two
children. This led to anger and confusion and lastly a resolve to start
work, nevertheless, and to begin boring at the site of a little chapel
which, at that time, stood outside the walls of the park. The Emperor
came often to Èbrecourt. One day, on leaving the chapel, he was met and
recognized by my father and myself. Two minutes later, you were
accosting my father. He was stabbed and killed. I myself received a
wound. Murder the second. A month later, the Comtesse d'Andeville was
seized with a mysterious illness and went down to the south to die."
</p><p>"You lie!" cried the countess, again. "Those are all lies! Not a single
proof! . . ."
</p><p>"A month later," continued Paul, still speaking very calmly, "M.
d'Andeville, who had lost his wife, took so great a dislike to Ornequin
that he decided never to go back to it. Your plan was carried out at
once. Now that the château was free, it became necessary for you to
obtain a footing there. How was it done? By buying over the keeper,
Jérôme, and his wife. That wretched couple, who certainly had the excuse
that they were not Alsatians, as they pretended to be, but of Luxemburg
birth, accepted the bribe. Thenceforth you were at home, free to come to
Ornequin as and when you pleased. By your orders, Jérôme even went to
the length of keeping the death of the Comtesse Hermine, the real
Comtesse Hermine, a secret. And, as you also were a Comtesse Hermine and
as no one knew Mme. d'Andeville, who had led a secluded life, everything
went off well. Moreover, you continued to multiply your precautions.
There was one, among others, that baffled me. A portrait of the Comtesse
d'Andeville hung in the boudoir which she used to occupy. You had a
portrait painted of yourself, of the same size, so as to fit the frame
inscribed with the name of the countess; and this portrait showed you
under the same outward aspect, wearing the same clothes and ornaments.
In short, you became what you had striven to appear from the outset and
indeed during the lifetime of Mme. d'Andeville, whose dress you were
even then beginning to copy: you became the Comtesse Hermine
d'Andeville, at least during the period of your visits to Ornequin.
There was only one danger, the possibility of M. d'Andeville's
unexpected return. To ward this off with certainty, there was but one
remedy, murder. You therefore managed to become acquainted with M.
d'Andeville, which enabled you to watch his movements and correspond
with him. Only, something happened on which you had not reckoned. I mean
to say that a feeling which was really surprising in a woman like
yourself began gradually to attach you to the man whom you had chosen as
a victim. I have placed among the exhibits a photograph of yourself
which you sent to M. d'Andeville from Berlin. At that time, you were
hoping to induce him to marry you; but he saw through your schemes, drew
back and broke off the friendship."
</p><p>The countess had knitted her brows. Her lips were distorted. The
lookers-on divined all the humiliation which she had undergone and all
the bitterness which she had retained in consequence. At the same time,
she felt no shame, but rather an increasing surprise at thus seeing her
life divulged down to the least detail and her murderous past dragged
from the obscurity in which she believed it buried.
</p><p>"When war was declared," Paul continued, "your work was ripe. Stationed
in the Èbrecourt villa, at the entrance to the tunnel, you were ready.
My marriage to Élisabeth d'Andeville, my sudden arrival at the château,
my amazement at seeing the portrait of the woman who had killed my
father: all this was told you by Jérôme and took you a little by
surprise. You had hurriedly to lay a trap in which I, in my turn, was
nearly assassinated. But the mobilization rid you of my presence. You
were able to act. Three weeks later, Corvigny was bombarded, Ornequin
taken, Élisabeth a prisoner of Prince Conrad's. . . . That, for you, was
an indescribable period. It meant revenge; and also, thanks to you, it
meant the great victory, the accomplishment--or nearly so--of the great
dream, the apotheosis of the Hohenzollerns! Two days more and Paris
would be captured; two months more and Europe was conquered. The
intoxication of it! I know of words which you uttered at that time and I
have read lines written by you which bear witness to an absolute
madness: the madness of pride, the madness of boundless power, the
madness of cruelty; a barbarous madness, an impossible, superhuman
madness. . . . And then, suddenly, the rude awakening, the battle of the
Marne! Ah, I have seen your letters on this subject, too! And I know no
finer revenge. A woman of your intelligence was bound to see from the
first, as you did see, that it meant the breakdown of every hope and
certainty. You wrote that to the Emperor, yes, you wrote it! I have a
copy of your letter. . . . Meanwhile, defense became necessary. The
French troops were approaching. Through my brother-in-law, Bernard, you
learnt that I was at Corvigny. Would Élisabeth be delivered, Élisabeth
who knew all your secrets? No, she must die. You ordered her to be
executed. Everything was made ready. And, though she was saved, thanks
to Prince Conrad, and though, in default of her death, you had to
content yourself with a mock execution intended to cut short my
inquiries, at least she was carried off like a slave. And you had two
victims for your consolation: Jérôme and Rosalie. Your accomplices,
smitten with tearful remorse by Élisabeth's tortures, tried to escape
with her. You dreaded their evidence against you: they were shot.
Murders the third and fourth. And the next day there were two more, two
soldiers whom you had killed, taking them for Bernard and myself.
Murders the fifth and sixth."
</p><p>Thus was the whole drama reconstructed in all its tragic phases and in
accordance with the order of the events and murders. And it was a
horrible thing to look upon this woman, guilty of so many crimes, walled
in by destiny, trapped in this cellar, face to face with her mortal
enemies. And yet how was it that she did not appear to have lost all
hope? For such was the case; and Bernard noticed it.
</p><p>"Look at her," he said, going up to Paul. "She has twice already
consulted her watch. Any one would think that she was expecting a
miracle or something more, a direct, inevitable aid which is to arrive
at a definite hour. See, her eyes are glancing about. . . . She is
listening for something. . . ."
</p><p>"Order all the soldiers at the foot of the stairs to come in," Paul
answered. "There is no reason why they should not hear what I have
still to say."
</p><p>And, turning towards the countess, he said, in tones which gradually
betrayed more feeling:
</p><p>"We are coming to the last act. All this part of the contest you
conducted under the aspect of Major Hermann, which made it easier for
you to follow the armies and play your part as chief spy. Hermann,
Hermine. . . . The Major Hermann whom, when necessary, you passed off as
your brother was yourself, Comtesse Hermine. And it was you whose
conversation I overheard with the sham Laschen, or rather Karl the spy,
in the ruins of the lighthouse on the bank of the Yser. And it was you
whom I caught and bound in the attic of the ferryman's house. Ah, what a
fine stroke you missed that day! Your three enemies lay wounded, within
reach of your hand, and you ran away without seeing them, without making
an end of them! And you knew nothing further about us, whereas we knew
all about your plans. An appointment for the 10th of January at
Èbrecourt, that ill-omened appointment which you made with Karl while
telling him of your implacable determination to do away with Élisabeth.
And I was there, punctually, on the 10th of January! I looked on at
Prince Conrad's supper-party! And I was there, after the supper, when
you handed Karl the poison. I was there, on the driver's seat of the
motor-car, when you gave Karl your last instructions. I was everywhere!
And that same evening Karl died. And the next night I kidnaped Prince
Conrad. And the day after, that is to say, two days ago, holding so
important a hostage and thus compelling the Emperor to treat with me, I
dictated conditions of which the first was the immediate release of
Élisabeth. The Emperor gave way. And here you see us!"
</p><p>In all this speech, a speech which showed the Comtesse Hermine with what
implacable energy she had been hunted down, there was one word which
overwhelmed her as though it related the most terrible of catastrophes.
She stammered:
</p><p>"Dead? You say that Karl is dead?"
</p><p>"Shot down by his mistress at the moment when he was trying to kill me,"
cried Paul, once again mastered by his hatred. "Shot down like a mad
dog! Yes, Karl the spy is dead; and even after his death he remained the
traitor that he had been all his life. You were asking for my proofs: I
discovered them on Karl's person! It was in his pocket-book that I read
the story of your crimes and found copies of your letters and some of
the originals as well. He foresaw that sooner or later, when your work
was accomplished, you would sacrifice him to secure your own safety; and
he revenged himself in advance. He avenged himself just as Jérôme the
keeper and his wife Rosalie revenged themselves, when about to be shot
by your orders, by revealing to Élisabeth the mysterious part which you
played at the Château d'Ornequin. So much for your accomplices! You kill
them, but they destroy you. It is no longer I who accuse you, it is
they. Your letters and their evidence are in the hands of your judges.
What answer have you to make?"
</p><p>Paul was standing almost against her. They were separated at the most by
a corner of the table; and he was threatening her with all his anger and
all his loathing. She retreated towards the wall, under a row of pegs
from which hung skirts and blouses, a whole wardrobe of various
disguises. Though surrounded, caught in a trap, confounded by an
accumulation of proofs, unmasked and helpless, she maintained an
attitude of challenge and defiance. The game did not yet seem lost. She
had some trump cards left in her hand; and she said:
</p><p>"I have no answer to make. You speak of a woman who has committed
murders; and I am not that woman. It is not a question of proving that
the Comtesse Hermine is a spy and a murderess: it is a question of
proving that I am the Comtesse Hermine. Who can prove that?"
</p><p>"_I_ can!"
</p><p>Sitting apart from the three officers whom Paul had mentioned as
constituting the court was a fourth, who had listened as silently and
impassively as they. He stepped forward. The light of the lamp shone on
his face. The countess murmured:
</p><p>"Stéphane d'Andeville. . . . Stéphane. . . ."
</p><p>It was the father of Élisabeth and Bernard. He was very pale, weakened
by the wounds which he had received and from which he was only beginning
to recover.
</p><p>He embraced his children. Bernard expressed his surprise and delight at
seeing him there.
</p><p>"Yes," he said, "I had a message from the commander-in-chief and I came
the moment Paul sent for me. Your husband is a fine fellow, Élisabeth.
He told me what had happened when we met a little while ago. And I now
see all that he has done . . . to crush that viper!"
</p><p>He had taken up his stand opposite the countess; and his hearers felt
beforehand the full importance of the words which he was about to speak.
For a moment, she lowered her head before him. But soon her eyes once
more flashed defiance; and she said:
</p><p>"So you, too, have come to accuse me? What have you to say against me?
Lies, I suppose? Infamies? . . ."
</p><p>There was a long pause after those words. Then, speaking slowly, he
said:
</p><p>"I come, in the first place, as a witness to give the evidence as to
your identity for which you were asking just now. You introduced
yourself to me long ago by a name which was not your own, a name under
which you succeeded in gaining my confidence. Later, when you tried to
bring about a closer relationship between us, you revealed to me who you
really were, hoping in this way to dazzle me with your titles and your
connections. It is therefore my right and my duty to declare before God
and man that you are really and truly the Countess Hermine von
Hohenzollern. The documents which you showed me were genuine. And it
was just because you were the Countess von Hohenzollern that I broke off
relations which in any case were painful and disagreeable to me, for
reasons which I should have been puzzled to state. That is my evidence."
</p><p>"It is infamous evidence!" she cried, in a fury. "Lying evidence, as I
said it would be! Not a proof!"
</p><p>"Not a proof?" echoed the Comte d'Andeville, moving closer to her and
shaking with rage. "What about this photograph, signed by yourself,
which you sent me from Berlin? This photograph in which you had the
impudence to dress up like my wife? Yes, you, you! You did this thing!
You thought that, by trying to make your picture resemble that of my
poor loved one, you would rouse in my breast feelings favorable to
yourself! And you did not feel that what you were doing was the worst
insult, the worst outrage that you could offer to the dead! And you
dared, you, you, after what had happened . . ."
</p><p>Like Paul Delroze a few minutes before, the count was standing close
against her, threatening her with his hatred. She muttered, in a sort of
embarrassment:
</p><p>"Well, why not?"
</p><p>He clenched his fists and said:
</p><p>"As you say, why not? I did not know at the time what you were . . . and
I knew nothing of the tragedy . . . of the tragedy of the past. . . . It
is only to-day that I have been able to compare the facts. And, whereas
I repulsed you at that time with a purely instinctive repulsion, I
accuse you now with unparalleled execration . . . now when I know, yes,
know, with absolute certainty. Long ago, when my poor wife was dying,
time after time the doctor said to me, 'It's a strange illness. She has
bronchitis and pneumonia, I know; and yet there are things which I don't
understand, symptoms--why conceal it?--symptoms of poisoning.' I used to
protest. The theory seemed impossible! My wife poisoned? And by whom? By
you, Comtesse Hermine, by you! I declare it to-day. By you! I swear it,
as I hope to be saved. Proofs? Why, your whole life bears witness
against you. Listen, there is one point on which Paul Delroze failed to
shed light. He did not understand why, when you murdered his father, you
wore clothes like those of my wife. Why did you? For this hateful reason
that, even at that time, my wife's death was resolved upon and that you
already wished to create in the minds of those who might see you a
confusion between the Comtesse d'Andeville and yourself. The proof is
undeniable. My wife stood in your way: you killed her. You guessed that,
once my wife was dead, I should never come back to Ornequin; and you
killed my wife. Paul Delroze, you have spoken of six murders. This is
the seventh: the murder of the Comtesse d'Andeville."
</p><p>The count had raised his two clenched fists and was shaking them in the
Comtesse Hermine's face. He was trembling with rage and seemed on the
point of striking her. She, however, remained impassive. She made no
attempt to deny this latest accusation. It was as though everything had
become indifferent to her, this unexpected charge as well as all those
already leveled at her. She appeared to have no thought of impending
danger or of the need of replying. Her mind was elsewhere. She was
listening to something other than those words, seeing something other
than what was before her eyes; and, as Bernard had remarked, it was as
though she were preoccupied with outside happenings rather than with the
terrible position in which she found herself.
</p><p>But why? What was she hoping for?
</p><p>A minute elapsed; and another minute.
</p><p>Then, somewhere in the cellar, in the upper part of it, there was a
sound, a sort of click.
</p><p>The countess drew herself up. And she listened with all her concentrated
attention and with an expression of such eagerness that nobody disturbed
the tremendous silence. Paul Delroze and M. d'Andeville had
instinctively stepped back to the table. And the Comtesse Hermine went
on listening. . . .
</p><p>Suddenly, above her head, in the very thickness of the vaulted ceiling,
an electric bell rang . . . only for a few seconds. . . . Four peals of
equal length. . . . And that was all.
