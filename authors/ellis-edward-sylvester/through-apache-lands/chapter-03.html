<p>As stealthily as a phantom did the canoe bearing the scout skim
along the shore of the Gila, hugging the banks as closely as possible,
so as to take advantage of the ribbon of shadow which followed
the winding of the stream. The moon was creeping higher up the
sky, and this advantage would soon be denied the fugitive altogether,
so every minute was improved to the utmost. Now and then Tom ceased
paddling, and as the boat shot forward with undiminished speed,
bent his head and listened. This was continued until he had passed
fully a quarter of a mile, when he rested for a longer time than
usual.</p>

<p>"I guess they'll have to give it up," he said to himself, with
a peculiar chuckle. "They ketched me in a bad box, that's sartin,
where I couldn't climb out on either side. But things are a little
better here," he added, as he looked from side to side at the
bluffs, which were so low that the tops could be easily reached
from his boat. "I don't much want to tramp over-land, but if it
is necessary I've got somethin' of a chance, which isn't what
I had before."</p>

<p>He might well prefer the water to the land; for on the former,
whether he went fast or slow, there was no trail left for the
keenest bloodhound to follow; on the latter it was impossible
to conceal his most cautious footsteps from the eyes of the redskins.
The surface of this portion of Arizona was of such a nature that
everything was against the hunter. There was no wood nor tributary
streams for miles. If he left the Gila, and struck across the
country, it would be over an open plain, where he could be seen
for miles. He would be on foot, while his enemies would all be
mounted on their fleet mustangs. How, then, could he elude them
by leaving his boat? His only hope was in traveling at night,
but night must always be followed by day.</p>

<p>"I wonder what ideas will creep into their skulls," he muttered,
reflecting upon the view the Apaches had gained of him a short
time before from the bank. "A dead Injun is a good deal better
than a live one, as that 'ere critter proved to me. If I hadn't
fired back agin, they might have thought I was one of their own
warriors&mdash;mebbe they'll think so now. Great Scott!"</p>

<p>The scout was paddling along in his leisurely manner, when his
eyes, by the merest accident, happened to rest upon the other
shore, at a point a short distance below him. While thus looking,
he saw distinctly a point of light appear and vanish three times!
It performed no such gyration as those which he had first seen,
but simply came forward and receded until it was gone altogether,
leaving the same misty darkness as before. More by instinct than
from any other cause, Tom turned his eyes to the point opposite
where he had seen this exhibition. He had scarcely done so when
precisely the same thing was seen!</p>

<p>"Jest what I expected," he said as he checked the downward progress
of his boat. "The varmints have 'spicioned that one of the chaps
in that 'ere canoe which passed before 'em is myself, and they're
goin' for me like lightnin'. They've mounted their horses, and
kept it up till they knowed they'd struck a p'int below me, and
there they've signaled to each other that I'm still above 'em
on the river, and still to be ketched."</p>

<p>The scout was certain that his theory was correct, and that,
distasteful and dangerous as it might be, the time had come for
him to leave the river. To continue further would be to precipitate
a collision in which there was no possibility of the good fortune
that had followed him in the first place. Besides this the night
was so far advanced and the moon so high up in the sky, that the
shadow had narrowed to a band which was practically useless.</p>

<p>"No use makin' faces when you've got a dose of medicine to take,"
he added, as he ran the canoe close to the shore.</p>

<p>There he found that by standing upon his feet he could easily
reach the edge of the bluff above and thus draw himself up when
he chose. This he proceeded to do, but he was too skillful a hunter
to leave behind him such tell-tale evidence as the canoe itself
would have proven. Were he to leave that as it was, it would be
sure to catch the eye of the Apaches within a quarter of an hour
and tell them precisely what had been done. And so, as the hunter
hung thus by his hands, with his long rifle secured at his back,
he caught the toe of his moccasin in the craft in such a way that
it dipped and took water. He held it thus until it could contain
no more; but its composition was such that even then it would
not sink. There were loose boulders in the bank, and the hunter
proceeded to drop these carefully into the boat below. It required
several for ballast, when it quietly went to the bottom, where
it was certain to stay. This done he addressed himself to the
task before him.</p>

<p>As he straightened up and looked off in the moonlight, a very
discouraging, although familiar sight, met his eye. The moonlight
was quite strong, and he was enabled to see objects indistinctly
for a considerable distance. It was everywhere the same. A level,
treeless prairie, where for miles there was not a drop of water
to be obtained, and over which, as has been already shown, in
case he attempted to make his way, he would be placed at the greatest
disadvantage possible, especially as his own mustang was still
a good hundred miles to the southwest, if he had succeeded in
avoiding capture up to that time. But the life of a frontiersman,
besides being perilous at all times, is hardly ever anything but
disagreeable, despite the curious fascination which it holds for
those who follow it. Tom did not hesitate a moment longer than
was necessary, now that a disagreeable expedient was forced upon
him.</p>

<p>His first precaution was to make sure that none of the Apaches
were in sight. The point at which he had seen the answering signal
was so far below that he was certain it would be beyond his vision,
and, this much determined, gave him just the "leverage" needed
to work upon. It needed but a few seconds to assure himself upon
this point, and then he struck off to the southwest. This course,
while it took him away from the Gila, would eventually bring him
back to it, the winding of the stream being such as to make this
junction certain, if continued. The great thing now required was
haste; for a great deal depended upon the ground that could be
passed over during these favoring hours of darkness. He had taken
scarcely a dozen steps when he struck into a long, loping trot,
not particularly rapid in itself, but of such a character that
it could be kept for hours at a stretch. It was the genuine Indian
dog trot, which is so effective in long distances. As the runner
went along in this fashion, his thoughts were busy, and all his
senses on the alert. He concluded that it was nearly midnight,
and that he had, consequently, a number of hours at his command;
so he aimed to get as far below the intercepting Apaches as possible,
with the intention of returning to the river, before daylight,
where he was hopeful of discovering some canoe, or at least of
hitting upon some feasible method of hiding his trail from his
lynx-eyed pursuers.</p>

<p>This loping trot was kept up for fully two hours, at the end
of which time Tom was certain that he was approaching the river
again. He still pressed forward for another hour, when he came
to a halt. Although he had continued this great exertion for so
long a time, yet so good was his wind that when he paused there
was no perceptible quickening of the respiration. Years of training
had made him capable of standing far more trying tests of his
strength than this. The scout carefully turned his head from side
to side, looking and listening. All was still, and his ear caught
no ominous sound. Then he moistened his finger and held it over
his head. Yes, there was the least possible breath of air stirring,
as was told him by the fact that one side of the moistened finger
was slightly chilled. Everywhere, right, left, in front or rear,
so far as the bright moonlight permitted his vision to extend,
was the same dead level of treeless plain. Kneeling down he applied
his ear to the ground. Could it be? There <em>was</em> a sound
thus carried to his ears&mdash;the very sound which above all others
he dreaded to hear. It was a faint, almost inaudible, tapping
upon the earth. Far away it was, but drawing nearer every minute.</p>

<p>The scout knew what it meant. It was the sound of horse's hoofs!</p>
