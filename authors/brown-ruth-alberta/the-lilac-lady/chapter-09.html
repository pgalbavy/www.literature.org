<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The next morning dawned bright and clear and cool, and Peace,
hurrying to school with her nose buried in a great bunch of early
roses from the stone house, pranced gaily down the hill chanting
under her breath, "Roses, roses, yellow, red and white, you are
surely lovely, sweet and bright&mdash;another rhyme! They always come
when I ain't trying to make 'em. I wonder if I'll ever be a big
poet like Longfellow was. It must be nice to have folks learn
the things you write and speak 'em at concerts and school exercises
like I'm going to do his 'Children's Hour' next Friday. I've got
it so I can say it backwards almost. Elizabeth says I know it
perfectly. I hope Miss Peyton will think the same way. She is
lots harder to please and I 'most never can do anything to suit
her."</p>

<p>She sighed dolefully, for her ludicrous mistakes and blunt remarks
were the bane of her new teacher's methodical life, and many an
hour she had been kept after school as a punishment for her unruly
tongue.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Miss Peyton belonged to that great army of teachers
who teach because they must, and not because they love the work.
To be sure, she was most just and impartial in her treatment of
the fifty scholars under her supervision, but, possessed of about
as much imagination as a cat, she failed to analyze or understand
the dispositions of her charges; and well-meaning Peace was usually
in disgrace.</p>

<p>But her sunny nature could not stay unhappy long, and as she
thrust her small nose deeper among the fragrant blossoms, she
smilingly added, "I guess she'll like these roses, anyway. They
are the prettiest I ever saw, even in greenhouses. There goes
the first bell. I 'xpected to be there early this morning, but
likely Annie Simms has beat me again. Well, I don't care, there
is only one more week of school and then vacation&mdash;and p'raps
I can go home. Why, what a crowd there is on the walk! I wonder
if someone is hurt again. Where can the principal be?"</p>

<p>She broke into a run, forgetful of her cherished bouquet, and
dashed heedlessly across the school-grounds to the group of excited,
shouting boys and girls, gathered around the tallest linden, throwing
stones and missiles of all sorts up into the branches at some
object which Peace could not see. But as she drew near, she could
hear a queer, distressed chattering, which reminded her of the
monkeys in the park zoo, and turning to one of her mates, she
demanded, "What is it the boys have got treed there?"</p>

<p>"A monkey."</p>

<p>"A monkey?" shrieked Peace in real surprise. "Where did they
get him?"</p>

<p>"I guess he b'longs to a hand-organ man. He's dressed in funny
little pants and a red cap. Thad DePugh found him on his way to
school and tried to catch him, but he run up the tree."</p>

<p>"And you stand there without saying a word and let them stone
a poor little helpless monkey!"</p>

<p>"It don't b'long to me," muttered the child, angered by the indignant
flash of the brown eyes and the scathing rebuke which seemed directed
against her alone. "Anyway, I ain't stoning it."</p>

<p>"You ain't helping, either. Let me through here!" She pushed
and elbowed her way into the midst of the throng and boldly confronted
the ringleaders of the tormentors, screaming in protest, "Don't
you throw another stone, you big bullies! Ain't you ashamed of
yourself, trying to kill that poor little thing!"</p>

<p>"We ain't trying to kill it," retorted the nearest chap, pausing
with his arm uplifted ready to pitch another pebble.</p>

<p>"You mind your own business!" growled another. "This monkey isn't
yours. We're trying to make it come down so we can catch it."</p>

<p>"You'll quit throwing things at it, or I'll tell Miss Curtis."</p>

<p>"Tattle-tale, tattle-tale!" mocked the throng, and another handful
of rocks flew up among the branches.</p>

<p>"O-h-h-h-h!" shrieked Peace, beside herself with rage. "You d'serve
to have the stuffing whaled out of you for that!"</p>

<p>Flinging aside the treasured roses, she seized the biggest boy
by the hair and jerked him mercilessly back and forth across the
yard, while he sought in vain to loosen the supple fingers, and
bawled loudly for help.</p>

<p>"Teacher, teacher! Miss Curtis, oh teacher!" shouted the excited
children; and at these sounds of strife from the playgrounds,
the principal and half a dozen of her staff rushed out of the
building to quell the riot. But even then Peace did not release
her grip on the lad's thick topknot.</p>

<p>Pulled forcibly from her victim by the long-suffering Miss Peyton,
she collapsed in the middle of the walk and sobbed convulsively,
while the rest of the scholars huddled around in scared silence,
eager to see what punishment was to be meted out to this small
offender, for it was a great disgrace at Chestnut School to be
caught fighting.</p>

<p>The grave-faced principal looked from the pitiful heap of misery
at her feet to the blubbering bully who had retreated to a safe
distance and stood ruefully rubbing his smarting cranium, minus
several tufts of hair; and though inwardly smiling at the spectacle,
she demanded sternly, "Peace Greenfield, aren't you ashamed of
yourself for fighting Thad&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," hiccoughed Peace with amazing promptness and candor; "I'm
terribly ashamed to think I <em>touched</em> him&mdash;he's so dirty.
But I ain't half as ashamed of <em>myself</em> as I am of him."</p>

<p>Even Miss Peyton caught her breath in dismay. But the principal
had not forgotten her own childhood days, and being still a girl
at heart, and secretly in sympathy with the small maid on the
ground, she only said, "Explain yourself, Peace."</p>

<p>"It ain't half as bad for a little girl like me to fight a big
bully like him, as it is for a big bully like him to fight a little
monkey&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wasn't fighting the monkey," sullenly muttered the boy, hanging
his head in shame.</p>

<p>"You were stoning him, and he couldn't hit back, so there!"</p>

<p>"What monkey?" demanded the principal, glancing swiftly around
the yard for any evidence of such a creature.</p>

<p>A dozen hands pointed toward the linden tree, and one small voice
piped, "He's up there!"</p>

<p>"A real monkey?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dressed up in hand-organ pants," Peace explained, scrambling
to her feet and peering up among the thick leaves for a glimpse
of the frightened animal, which had ceased its wild chattering
and sat huddled close against the tree trunk almost within reach.
"See it? Poor little Jocko, I won't hurt you!" She stretched out
her hands at the same moment that unknowingly she had spoken its
name, and to the intense amazement of teachers and pupils, the
tiny, trembling creature unhesitatingly dropped upon her shoulder,
threw its claw-like arms about her neck and hid its face in her
curls.</p>

<p>"Whose monkey is it?" gently asked Miss Curtis, breaking the
silence which fell upon the group watching the strange sight.</p>

<p>"I never saw it before," Peace answered.</p>

<p>"But you called it by name," chorused the children, crowding
closer about her.</p>

<p>"That was just a guess. There's a story in our reader about Jocko,
and I happened to think of it. I didn't know it was this monkey's
name."</p>

<p>"How odd!" murmured the primary teacher.</p>

<p>"She's the queerest child I ever saw," confided Miss Peyton;
but the principal had seen the janitor approaching the open door
to ring the last bell, and being at loss to know what to do with
the unwelcome little animal in Peace's arms, she suggested that
the child take it home and put it in a box until the owner could
be found. This Peace was only too delighted to do, for as no one
in the neighborhood seemed to know where it came from or whose
it was, she had fond hopes that no one would inquire for it, and
that she might keep it for a pet.</p>

<p>So she joyfully carried it back to the parsonage, and burst in
upon the little household with the jumbled explanation, "Here's
a stone I found monkeying up a tree and Miss Curtis asked me to
bring it home and box it till the owner comes around after it.
And if he doesn't come, I can keep it myself, can't I, Saint John?
He jumped right into my arms and won't let go, but just shakes
and shakes 'sif he was still getting hit by those rocks. I pulled
Thad DePugh 'most bald headed, and didn't get scolded a bit hardly.
She made him go to the office, though, and I hope he gets licked
the way I couldn't do but wanted to."</p>

<p>"Here, here," laughed the minister, looking much bewildered at
the twisted story. "Just say that again, please, and say it straight.
I haven't the faintest idea yet how you got hold of that little
reptile or what Thad's hair had to do with it."</p>

<p>"It isn't a reptile!" Peace indignantly denied. "It's a monkey
which hid in the linden tree at the schoolhouse to get away from
the boys and they stoned it."</p>

<p>Little by little the story was untangled, while the monkey still
tenaciously clung to Peace's neck and wide-eyed Glen hung onto
her skirts.</p>

<p>"So you think there is a chance of your keeping him for a pet?"
said the preacher, when at length the tale was ended.</p>

<p>"Can't I?"</p>

<p>"You are hoping too much, little girl. If this animal belongs
to an organ-grinder, he will be around for him very soon, you
may be sure. It is the monkey's antics that bring in the pennies.
He can't afford to lose such a valuable. Besides, Peace, the poor
little thing is almost dead now."</p>

<p>"Oh, Saint John, he is only scared. S'posing you were a monkey
and hateful boys stoned you, wouldn't you tremble and shake?"</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it, girlie, but it isn't only fear that ails that
animal. Look here at his back&mdash;just a solid mass of sores. Elizabeth,
isn't that shocking? This is surely a case for the Humane Society.
It is a shame to let the creature live, suffering as it must be
suffering from those cruel wounds. His owner ought to be jailed."</p>

<p>"Oh, Saint John, you aren't going to kill Jocko, are you?"</p>

<p>"No, dear, he is not my property, and I have no legal right to
put him out of his misery, but we must call up the Humane Society
and notify them at once. They will be merciful. It is better to
have him die now than live and suffer at the hands of a brutal
owner, Peace. You must not cry."</p>

<p>For great tears of pity were coursing down the rosy cheeks, and
Glen was trying his best to wipe them away with his fat little
fists. Elizabeth supplied the missing handkerchief, and as Peace
raised it to her face, the monkey gave a sudden convulsive shudder,
the tiny paws loosed their grasp about the warm neck, and Jocko
lay dead in the child's arms.</p>

<p>For a full moment she stared at the pitiful form, and Elizabeth
expected a storm of grief and protest; but instead, the little
maid drew a long, deep breath as of relief, and said soberly,
"Saint John is right. Jocko is better off dead, but I'm glad he
died in my arms, knowing I was good to him, 'stead of being stoned
to death by those cruel boys in the tree. Where is Saint John?
Has he already gone to telephone the Human Society? He needn't
to now. The monkey is dead. I'll run and catch him on my way back
to school. Good-bye."</p>

<p>She was off like a flash down the hill once more, but the preacher
had either taken a different route or already reached his goal,
for he was nowhere in sight. So Peace continued her way to the
schoolhouse, racing like mad to make up lost time. As she panted
up the steps into the dimness of the cool hall, she stumbled over
a trembling figure crouching in the darkest corner by the stairway,
and drew back with a startled cry, which was echoed by her victim,
a frail, ragged, young urchin with a thatch of jet black curls
and great, hollow, dusky eyes.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Peace, not recognizing him as one of
the regular pupils at Chestnut School. "And what are you doing
here?"</p>

<p>"Giuseppe Nicoli," answered the elf, looking terribly frightened
and shrinking further into his corner. "Me losa monk'. He come
here but gona way. W'en Petri fin', he keel me." The thin face
worked pathetically as the little fellow bravely tried to stifle
the sobs which shook his feeble body; and Peace, with childish
instinct, understood what the waif's queer, broken English failed
to tell her.</p>

<p>"Is Petri your father?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" He shook his head vehemently to emphasize his words.</p>

<p>"Then why are you afraid of him?"</p>

<p>"He playa de organ, me seeng, me feedle, de monk' he dance and
bring in mon'. Monk' los', Petri keel me."</p>

<p>"The monkey is dead." The words escaped her lips before she thought,
but the frozen horror on the boy's face brought her to her senses,
and she hastily cried, "But he was <em>so</em> sick and hurt!
His back was just a mess of solid sores. It is better that he
is dead!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but Petri keel me!"</p>

<p>"Sh! The teachers will hear you if you screech so loud. Come
upstairs with me. Miss Curtis will know what to do. She won't
let Petri get you. Don't be afraid, Jessup. I wouldn't hurt you
for the world."</p>

<p>He did not understand half that she said, but the great brown
eyes were filled with sympathy, and with the same instinct which
had led the monkey to leap into her arms a few moments before,
the ragamuffin laid his grimy fists into hers, and she led him
up the winding stairs to the principal's office.</p>

<p>When the worthy lady had heard the queer story, she could only
stare from one child to the other and gasp for breath. Peace was
noted for finding all sorts of maimed birds or sick animals on
her way to school, but never before had she appeared with a human
being, and Miss Curtis almost doubted now that little Giuseppe
was a real human. He looked so pitifully like a scarecrow. What
could she do with him? It would be criminal to let the brutal
organ-player get him again if the lad's story were true, and she
did not doubt its truth after the waif had slipped back his ragged
sleeves and showed great, ugly, purple welts across his naked
arms.</p>

<p>"Poor little chap," she murmured. "Poor little chap!" As she
gingerly touched the bony hands, she was seized with a happy inspiration,
and bidding the children sit down till she returned, she entered
a little inner office, and Peace heard her at the telephone. "Give
me 9275."</p>

<p>There was a pause; then the child grew rigid with horror. The
voice from the adjoining room was saying, "Is this the Humane
Society?"</p>

<p>It was to the Humane Society that Saint John had intended telephoning,
in order that they might come up and kill the poor monkey. Was
Miss Curtis a murderer? Surely Giuseppe was not to be killed,
too. Then why had she telephoned the Humane Society?</p>

<p>Tiptoeing across the floor to the Italian waif's chair, she clutched
him by the hand, dragged him to his feet, and signalling him to
be quiet, she stole cautiously from the room with him in tow.
Down the long stairs they hurried, and out into the bright sunshine,
though poor, frightened Giuseppe protested volubly in his own
tongue and the little broken English which he knew, for once on
the streets, he feared that the bold, bad Petri would find him
and drag him away to dreadful punishments again. But the harder
he protested, the faster Peace jerked him along, repeating over
and over in her frantic efforts to make him understand, "Petri
shan't get you, Jessup. But if we stay there the Human Society
will, and that's just as bad. They killed Deacon Skinner's old
horse in Parker, and Tim Shandy's lame cow, and were coming to
finish Jocko when he died of his own self. You don't want to go
the same way, do you?"</p>

<p>Poor Peace did not know the real mission of the Humane Society,
or she would not have been so shocked at the idea of little Giuseppe's
falling into their hands; but her fear had its effect upon the
struggling urchin, and his feet fairly flew over the ground, as
he tried to keep pace with his leader. When only half a block
from the parsonage, Peace abruptly halted, and the boy's dark
eyes looked into hers inquiringly, fearfully. What was the matter
now? This was certainly a queer child at his side. Perhaps it
would have been wiser had he stayed with the gentle-faced lady
in the schoolhouse.</p>

<p>"Run," he urged, tugging at her hand when she continued to stand
motionless in the middle of the walk. "Petri geta me."</p>

<p>"No, no, Petri shan't have you, I say!" Peace declared savagely.
"But if I take you home to Saint Elspeth, like as not the Human
Society will be right there to nab you; and if they ain't now,
Miss Curtis will send 'em along as soon as she finds we've run
away. Where can I take you?"</p>

<p>Anxiously she looked about her for a hiding place, and as if
in answer to her question, her glance rested upon the stone house,
surrounded by its tall hedges. "Sure enough! Why didn't I think
of that before? My Lilac Lady will take care of you, I know, until
Saint John can find some nice place for you to live always. Come
on this way."</p>

<p>She whisked around the corner, threw open the gate, and ushered
the trembling waif into the splendid garden, with the announcement,
"Here is the place I mean, and there is the Lilac Lady under the
trees."</p>

<p>The boy surveyed the masses of brilliant flowers, the sparkling
fountain, the shifting shadows of the great oaks above him where
birds were singing. Then he turned and scanned the white, sweet
face among the pillows, and clasping his thin hands in rapture,
he breathed, "Italy! Oh, eet iss Paradise!" And as if unable to
restrain his joy any longer, he burst into a wild, plaintive song,
with a voice silvery toned and clear as a bell. Peace paused in
the midst of a turbulent explanation to listen; Aunt Pen came
to the door with her sewing in her hand; Hicks stole around the
corner of the house, thinking perhaps the young mistress had broken
her long silence; and the lame girl herself lay with parted lips,
charmed by the glorious burst of melody.</p>

<p>The song won her heart, even before she heard the pitiful story
of the wretched little musician, and when Peace had finished recounting
the morning's events, the mistress of the stone house turned toward
her aunt with blazing, wrathful eyes, exclaiming impetuously,
"Isn't that shocking? Oh, how dreadful! We must help him, Aunt
Pen. Poor little Giuseppe! See the Humane Society about him at
once &mdash;Now don't look so horrified, Peace. They don't kill
little boys and girls. They take good care of just such waifs
as this, and provide nice homes for them. Even if Giuseppe were
related to Petri, the Humane Society would take the child away
from him on account of his brutality. He is worse than a beast
to treat the boy so, and Giuseppe shall never go back to him as
long as I can do anything. He shall go to school like other children
and get an education. Then we'll make a splendid musician of him;
and who knows, Peace, but some day he will be a second Campanini?"</p>

<p>Peace had not the faintest idea of what a Campanini was, but
she did understand that Giuseppe Nicoli had found a home and friends,
and she was content.</p>
