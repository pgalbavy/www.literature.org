<p>When the old horse Ebenezer stood in his stall in the barn he was always
glad to talk with anybody that came along.
</p>
<p>Henrietta Hen sometimes strolled into the horse-barn to see if she could
find a little grain that had spilled on the floor. So it came about that
she and Ebenezer had many a chat together. Henrietta had no great opinion
of horses. She thought that they had altogether more than their share of
grain.
</p><p>But she was willing to pass the time of day with Ebenezer, because he let
her walk right into his stall and pick up tidbits that had dropped upon
the floor beneath his manger.
</p><p>It was on such an occasion, on a summer's day, that he said to her with a
sigh, "Haying's going to begin to-morrow."
</p><p>Henrietta Hen remarked that she wasn't at all interested in the news.
"And I don't see why you should sigh," she added. "Goodness knows you'll
eat your share of the hay--and probably more--before the winter's over."
</p><p>"It's the work that I'm thinking of," Ebenezer explained. "They'll hitch
me to the hayrake and Johnnie Green will drive me all day long in the hot
hayfields. I always hate to hear the clatter of the mowing machine," he
groaned. "It means that the hayrake will come out of the shed next."
</p><p>Henrietta Hen caught her breath.
</p><p>"The mowing machine!" she gasped. "Is Farmer Green going to use the
mowing machine now?"
</p><p>"Certainly!" said Ebenezer. "I hear he's going to harness the bays to it
to-morrow morning."
</p><p>"My! my!" Henrietta wailed. "Isn't there any way I can stop him from
doing that?"
</p><p>"I don't know of any," Ebenezer told her. "I've often felt just as you do
about it. There's nobody that dreads hearing the mowing machine more than
I do."
</p><p>"You can't feel the way I do," Henrietta declared.
</p><p>"On the contrary," the old horse insisted, "I don't see how it can matter
to you in the least. <u>You</u> don't have to pull the mowing machine nor the
hayrake. Besides, didn't you just tell me that my news about haying
didn't interest you?"
</p><p>"But it does!" Henrietta cried. "I was mistaken. It means <u>everything</u> to
me. It's the worst news I ever heard in all my life."
</p><p>Old Ebenezer looked down at her with mild astonishment on his long,
honest face.
</p><p>"Why is it bad news?" he inquired. "If you'll tell me, perhaps I can help
you."
</p><p>So Henrietta Hen explained her difficulty. Whatever it was, it amazed
Ebenezer. And he had to admit that he could think of no way out of the
trouble.
</p><p>"It was very, very careless of you," he told Henrietta. Then suddenly he
had a happy thought. "Cheer up!" he cried. "If Farmer Green sits on them,
maybe they'll hatch."
</p><p>"Hatch!" she groaned. "They'll <u>break</u>!"
</p><p>And she ran out of the stall and hurried into the yard.
</p><p>She was just in time to hear Farmer Green calling to his son Johnnie.
</p><p>"Look here!" said he. "I started to oil the mowing machine so I could use
it to-morrow; and just see what I found in the seat!"
</p><p>Johnnie Green came a-running. And there in the seat of the mowing
machine, nestling in the hay which had been put there for a cushion the
summer before, three eggs greeted Johnnie's eyes.
</p><p>"They must belong to the speckled hen," Johnnie decided. "I knew she'd
stolen her nest again. I couldn't find it anywhere." He picked up the
eggs and put them in his hat. "She's a sly one," he said.
</p><p>That remark made Henrietta Hen somewhat angry. At the same time she was
glad that Farmer Green had discovered the eggs before it was too late.
She wouldn't have liked him to sit on them.
</p><p>It always upset her to see her eggs broken.
