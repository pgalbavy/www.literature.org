<P>
"Up to the present, then," Wingrave remarked, "the child has no idea as to who
has been responsible for the charge of her?"
<P>
"No idea at all, Sir Wingrave," the lawyer declared. "Your wishes have been
strictly carried out, most strictly. She imagines that it is some unknown
connection of her father. But, as I explained to you in my letter, she has
recently exhibited a good deal of curiosity in the matter. She is--er--a young
lady of considerable force of character for her years, and her present
attitude--as I explained in my letter--is a trifle difficult."
<P>
Wingrave was sitting in the lawyer's own chair. Mr. Pengarth, who was a trifle
nervous, preferred to stand.
<P>
"She shows, I think, a certain amount of ingratitude in forcing this journey
and explanation upon me," Wingrave declared coldly. "It should have been
sufficient for her that her benefactor preferred to remain anonymous."
<P>
"I regret, Sir Wingrave, that I must disagree with you," Mr. Pengarth answered
boldly. "Miss Juliet, Miss Lundy I should say, is a young lady of
character--and--er--some originality of disposition. She is a great favorite
with everyone around here."
<P>
Wingrave remained silent. He had the air of one not troubling to reply to what
he considered folly. Through the wide open window floated in the various
sounds of the little country town, the rumbling of heavy carts passing along
the cobbled streets, the shrill greetings of neighbors and acquaintances
meeting upon the sidewalk. And then the tinkling bell of a rubber-tired cart
pulling up outside, and a clear girlish voice speaking to some one of the
passers-by.
<P>
Wingrave betrayed as much surprise as it was possible for him to show when at
last she stood with outstretched hand before him. He had only an imperfect
recollection of an ill-clad, untidy-looking child, with pale tear-stained
cheeks, and dark unhappy eyes. The march of the years had been a thing whose
effects he had altogether underestimated. The girl who stood now facing him
was slight, and there was something of the child left in her bright eager
face, but she carried herself with all the graceful assurance of an older
woman. Her soft, dark eyes were lit with pleasure and excitement, her
delicately traced eyebrows and delightful smile were somehow suggestive of her
foreign descent. Her clothes were country-made, but perfect as regarded fit
and trimness, her beflowered hat was worn with a touch of coquettish grace, a
trifle un-English, but very delightful. She had not an atom of shyness or
embarrassment. Only there was a great surprise in her face as she held out her
hands to Wingrave.
<P>
"I know who you are," she exclaimed. "You are Sir Wingrave Seton. To think
that I never guessed."
<P>
"You remember seeing me, then?" he remarked, and his tone sounded all the
colder after the full richness of her young voice.
<P>
"I just remember it--only just," she answered. "You see you did not take much
notice of me that time, did you? But I have lived amongst your ancestors too
long to make any mistake. Why have you stayed away from Tredowen so long?"
<P>
"I have been abroad," Wingrave answered. "I am not fond of England."
<P>
"You had trouble here, I know," she said frankly. "But that is all past and
over. I think that you must forget how beautiful your home is or you would
never bear to live away from it. Now, please, may I ask you a question?"
<P>
"Any that you think necessary," Wingrave answered. "Spare me as much as
possible; I am not fond of them."
<P>
"Shall I leave you two together for a little time?" Mr. Pengarth suggested,
gathering up some papers.
<P>
"Certainly not," Wingrave said shortly. "There is not the slightest necessity
for it."
<P>
Mr. Pengarth resumed his seat.
<P>
"Just as you please," he answered. "But you must sit down, Juliet. There, you
shall have my clients' chair."
<P>
The girl accepted it with a little laugh. There was no shadow of embarrassment
about her manner, notwithstanding the cold stiffness of Wingrave's deportment.
He sat where the sunlight fell across his chair, and the lines in his pale
face seemed deeper than usual, the grey hairs more plentiful, the weariness in
his eyes more apparent. Yet she was not in the least afraid of him.
<P>
"First of all, then, Sir Wingrave, may I ask you why you have been so
extraordinarily kind to me?"
<P>
"There is nothing extraordinary about it at all," he answered. "Your father
died and left you friendless in a parish of which I am Lord of the Manor. He
received a starvation pittance for his labors, which it was my duty to
augment, a duty which, with many others, I neglected. I simply gave orders
that you should be looked after."
<P>
She laughed softly.
<P>
"Looked after! Why, I have lived at Tredowen. I have had a governess, a pony
to drive. Heaven knows how many luxuries!"
<P>
"That," he interrupted hastily, "is nothing. The house is better occupied.
What I have done for you is less in proportion than the sixpence you may
sometimes have given to a beggar for I am a rich, a ridiculously rich man,
with no possible chance of spending one-quarter of my income. You had a
distinct and obvious claim upon me, and, at no cost or inconvenience to
myself, I have endeavored, through others, to recognize it."
<P>
"I will accept your view of the situation," the girl said, still smiling, but
with a faint note of disappointment in her tone. "I do not wish to force upon
you expressions of gratitude which you would only find wearisome. But I must
thank you! It is in my heart, and I must speak of it. There, it is over, you
see! I shall say no more."
<P>
"You are a sensible young lady," Wingrave said, making a motion as though to
rise. "I have only one request to make to you, and that is that you keep to
yourself the knowledge which Mr. Pengarth informs me that you insisted upon
acquiring. You are nearly enough of age now, and I will make you your own
mistress. That is all, I think."
<P>
The smile died away from her lips. Her tone became very earnest.
<P>
"Sir Wingrave," she said, "for all that you have done for me, I am, as you
know grateful. I would try to tell you how grateful, only I know that it would
weary you. So we will speak only of the future. I cannot continue to
accept--even such magnificent alms as yours."
<P>
"What do you mean, child?" he asked, frowning across at her.
<P>
"I mean," she said, "that now I am old enough to work, I cannot accept
everything from one upon whom I have no claim. If you will help me a little
still, I shall be more than grateful. But it must be in my own way."
<P>
"You talk about work," he said. "What can you do?"
<P>
"I can paint," she answered, "fairly well. I should like to go to London and
have a few lessons. If I cannot make a living at that, I shall try something
else."
<P>
"You disappoint me," Wingrave said. "There is no place for you in London.
There are thousands starving there already because they can paint a little, or
sing a little, or fancy they can. Do you find it dull down here?"
<P>
"Dull!" she exclaimed wonderingly. "I think that there can be no place on
earth so beautiful as Tredowen."
<P>
"You are happy here?"
<P>
"Perfectly!"
<P>
"Then, for heaven's sake, forget all this folly," Wingrave said hardly.
"London is no place for children. Miss Harrison can take you up for a month
when you choose. You can go abroad if you want to. But for the rest--"
<P>
She rose suddenly, and sweeping across the office with one graceful movement,
she leaned over Wingrave's chair. Her hands rested upon his shoulders, her
eyes, soft with gathering tears, pleaded with his. Wingrave sat with all the
outward immobility of a Sphinx.
<P>
"Dear Sir Wingrave," she said, "you have been so generous, so kind, and I may
not even speak of my gratitude. Don't please think me unreasonable or
ungracious. I can't tell you how I feel, but I must, I must, I must go away. I
could not live here any longer now that I know. Fancy for a moment that I am
your sister, or your daughter! Don't you believe, really, that she would feel
the same? And I think you would wish her to. Don't be angry with me, please."
<P>
Wingrave's face never changed; but his fingers gripped the arms of his chair
so that a signet ring he wore cut deep into his flesh. When he spoke, his tone
sounded almost harsh. The girl turned away to dash the tears from her eyes.
<P>
"What do you think of this--folly, Pengarth?"
<P>
The lawyer looked his best client squarely in the face. "I do not call it
folly, Sir Wingrave. I think that Miss Lundy is right."
<P>
There was a pause. Her eyes were still pleading with him.
<P>
"Against the two of you," Wingrave remarked, "I am, of course, powerless.
After all, it is no concern of mine. I shall leave you, Pengarth, to make such
arrangements as Miss Lundy desires!"
<P>
He rose to his feet. Juliet now was pale. She dashed the tears from her eyes
and looked at him in amazement mingled with something which was almost like
despair.
<P>
"You don't mean," she exclaimed, "you are going away without coming to
Tredowen?"
<P>
"Why not?" he asked. "I never had any intention of going there!"
<P>
"You are very angry with me," she cried in despair. "I--I--"
<P>
Her lip quivered. Wingrave interposed.
<P>
"I shall be happy to go and have a look at the place," he said carelessly, "if
you will drive me back. I fancy I have almost forgotten what it is like."
<P>
She looked at him as at one who had spoken irreverently. Her eyes were full of
wonder.
<P>
"I think that you must have indeed forgotten," she said, "how very beautiful
it is. It is your home too! There is no one else," she added softly, "who can
live there, amongst all those wonderful things, and call it really--home!"
<P>
"I am afraid," he said, "you will find that I have outlived all sentiment; but
I will certainly come to Tredowen with you!"
