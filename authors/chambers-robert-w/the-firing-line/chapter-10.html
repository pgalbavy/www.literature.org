<p>The camp-wagon and led horses left before daylight with two of
the Cracker guides, Bulow and Carter; but it was an hour after
sunrise when Cardross, senior, Gray, Shiela, Hamil, and the head
guide, Eudo Stent, rode out of the <em>patio</em> into the dewy
beauty of a February morning.</p>

<p>The lagoon was pink; so was the white town on its western shore;
in the east, ocean and sky were one vast rosy-rayed glory. Few
birds sang.</p>

<p>Through the intense stillness of early morning the little cavalcade
made a startling clatter on the shell highway; but the rattle
of hoofs was soon deadened in the sand of a broad country road
curving south through dune and hammock along the lake shore.</p>

<p>Dew still dropped in great splashes from pine and palm; dew powdered
the sparkle-berry bushes and lay like a tiny lake of quicksilver
in the hollow of every broad palmetto frond; and all around them
earth and grass and shrub exhaled the scented freshness of a dew-washed
world.</p>

<p>On the still surface of the lake, tinted with palest rose and
primrose, the wild ducks floated, darkly silhouetted against the
water or, hoping for crumbs, paddled shoreward, inquiringly peering
up at the riders with little eyes of brightest gold.</p>

<p>"Blue-bills," said Cardross to Hamil; "nobody shoots them on
the lake; they're as tame as barnyard waterfowl. Yet, the instant
these same ducks leave this lagoon where they know they're protected
they become as wild and wary and as difficult to get a shot at
as any other wild-fowl."</p>

<p>Shiela, riding ahead with Gray, tossed bits of bread into the
water; and the little blue-bill ducks came swimming in scores,
keeping up with the horses so fearlessly and persistently that
the girl turned in her saddle and looked back at her father in
delight.</p>

<p>"I'm certainly as gifted as the Pied Piper, dad! If they follow
me to Ruffle Lake I won't permit a shot to be fired."</p>

<p>While she spoke she kept her eyes on her father. Except for a
brief good morning at breakfast she had neither looked at nor
spoken to Hamil, making no noticeable effort to avoid him, but
succeeded in doing it nevertheless.</p>

<p>Like her father and brother and Hamil she was mounted on an unornamental
but wiry Tallahassee horse; and she rode cross-saddle, wearing
knee-coat and kilts of kahkee and brown leather puttees strapped
from under the kneecap to the ankle. Like the others, too, she
carried a small shotgun in a saddle boot, and in the web loops
across her breast glimmered the metal rims of a dozen cartridges.
A brilliant handkerchief knotted loosely around her bare white
throat, and a broad Panama turned up in front and resolutely pulled
down behind to defy sunstroke, completed a most bewilderingly
charming picture, which moved even her father to admiring comment.</p>

<p>"Only," he added, "look before you step over a log when you're
afoot. The fangs of a big diamond-back are three-quarters of an
inch long, my dear, and they'll go through leather as a needle
goes through cambric."</p>

<p>"Thanks, dad&mdash;and here endeth the usual lesson."</p>

<p>Cardross said to Hamil: "One scarcely knows what to think about
the snakes here. The records of the entire Union show few deaths
in a year, and yet there's no scarcity of rattlers, copperheads,
and moccasins in this Republic of ours. I know a man, an ornithologist,
who for twelve years has wandered about the Florida woods and
never saw a rattler. And yet, the other night a Northern man,
a cottager, lighted his cigar after dinner and stepped off his
veranda on to a rattler."</p>

<p>"Was he bitten?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He died in two hours." Cardross shrugged and gathered up
his bridle. "Personally I have no fear; leggings won't help much;
besides, a good-sized snake can strike one's hand as it swings;
but our cracker guides go everywhere in thin cotton trousers and
the Seminoles are barelegged. One hears often enough of escapes,
yet very rarely of anybody being bitten. One of my grove guards
was struck by a moccasin last winter. He was an awfully sick nigger
for a while, but he got over it."</p>

<p>"That's cheerful," said Hamil, laughing.</p>

<p>"Oh, you might as well know. There are plenty of wiseacres who'll
tell you that nobody's in danger at these East Coast resorts,
and the hotel people will swear solemnly there isn't a serpent
in the State; but there are, Hamil, and plenty of them. I've seen
rattlers strike without rattling; and moccasins are ugly brutes
that won't get out of the way for you and that give no warning
when they strike; and all quail hunters in the flat-woods know
how their pointers and setters are killed, and every farmer knows
that the best watchmen he can have is a flock of guinea-fowl or
turkeys or a few hogs loose. The <em>fact</em> is that deadly
snakes are not rare in many localities; the <em>wonder</em> is
that scarcely a death is reported in a year. How many niggers
die, I don't know; but I know enough, when I'm in the woods or
fields, to look every time before I put my foot upon the ground."</p>

<p>"How can you see in the jungle?"</p>

<p>"You've <em>got</em> to see. Besides, rattlers are on the edge
of thickets, not inside. They've got to have an open space to
strike the small furry creatures which they live on. Moccasins
affect mud&mdash;<em>look</em> there!"</p>

<p>Both horses shyed; in front Shiela's mount was behaving badly,
but even while she was mastering him she tried at the same time
to extract her shotgun from the leather boot. Stent rode up and
drew it out for her; Hamil saw her break and load, swing in the
saddle, and gaze straight into an evil-looking bog all set with
ancient cypress knees and the undulating snaky roots of palmettos.</p>

<p>"A perfectly enormous one, dad!" she called back.</p>

<p>"Wait!" said Cardross; "I want Hamil to see." And to Hamil: "Ride
forward; you ought to know what the ugly brutes look like!"</p>

<p>As he drew bridle at Shiela's left the girl, still intent, pointed
in silence; but he looked in vain for the snake, mistaking every
palmetto root for a serpent, until she leaned forward and told
him to sight along her extended arm. Then he saw a dull gray fold
without any glitter to it, draped motionless over a palmetto root,
and so like the root that he could scarcely believe it anything
else.</p>

<p>"That?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It's as thick as a man's arm."</p>

<p>"Is it a moccasin?"</p>

<p>"It is; a cotton-mouth."</p>

<p>The guide drawled: "Ah reckon he's asleep, Miss Cahdhoss. Ah'll
make him rare up 'f yew say so."</p>

<p>"Make him rear up," suggested Gray. "And stand clear, Hamil,
because Shiela must shoot quick if he slides for the water."</p>

<p>The men backed their nervously snorting horses, giving her room;
Stent dismounted, picked up a pig-nut, and threw it accurately.
Instantly the fat mud-coloured fold slipped over the root and
a head appeared rising straight out of the coils up into the air&mdash;a
flat and rather small head on a horribly swollen body, stump-tailed,
disgusting. The head was looking at them, stretched high, fully
a third of the creature in the air. Then, soundlessly, the wide-slitted
mouth opened; and Hamil saw its silky white lining.</p>

<p>"Moccasins stand their ground," said the girl, raising her gun.
The shot crashed out; the snake collapsed. For fully a minute
they watched; not a fold even quivered.</p>

<p>"Struck by lightning," said Gray; "the buzzards will get him."
And he drew a folding butterfly net from his saddle boot, affixed
ring and gauze bag, and cantered forward briskly in the wake of
a great velvety black butterfly which was sailing under the live-oaks
above his head.</p>

<p>His father, wishing to talk to Eudo Stent, rode ahead with the
guide, leaving Shiela and Hamil to follow.</p>

<p>The latter reined in and waited while the girl leisurely returned
the fowling-piece to its holster. Then, together, they walked
their horses forward, wading the "branch" which flowed clear as
a trout stream out of the swamp on their right.</p>

<p>"It looks drinkable," he said.</p>

<p>"It is, for Crackers; but there's fever in it for you, Mr. Hamil....
Look at Gray! He's missed his butterfly. But it's a rather common
one&mdash;the black form of the tiger swallow-tail. Just see those
zebra-striped butterflies darting like lightning over the palmetto
scrub! Gray and I could never catch them until one day we found
a ragged one that couldn't fly and we placed it on a leaf; and
every time one of those butterflies came our way it paused in
its flight for a second and hovered over the ragged one. And that's
how Gray and I caught the swift Ajax butterflies for his collection!...
I've helped him considerably, if you please; I brought him the
mysterious Echo moth from Ormond, and a wonderful little hornet
moth from Jupiter Inlet."</p>

<p>She was rattling on almost feverishly, never looking at him,
restless in her saddle, shifting bridle, adjusting stirrups, gun-case,
knotting and reknotting her neckerchief, all with that desperate
attempt at composure which betrays the courage that summons it.</p>

<p>"Shiela, dear!"</p>

<p>"What!" she said, startled into flushed surprise.</p>

<p>"Look at me."</p>

<p>She turned in her saddle, the colour deepening and waning on
her white skin from neck to temples; and sustained his gaze to
the limit of endurance. Then again in her ears sounded the soft
crash of her senses; he swung wide in his stirrups, looking recklessly
into her eyes. A delicate sense of intoxication stilled all speech
between them for a moment. Then, head bowed, eyes fixed on her
bridle hand, the other hand, ungloved, lying hotly unresponsive
in his, she rode slowly forward at his side. Face to face with
all the mad unasked questions of destiny and fate and chance still
before her&mdash;all the cold problems of truth and honour still to
be discussed with that stirring, painful pulse in her heart which
she had known as conscience&mdash;silently, head bent, she rode into
the west with the man she must send away.</p>

<p>Far to the north-east, above a sentinel pine which marks the
outskirts of the flat-woods, streaks like smoke drifted in the
sky&mdash;the wild-fowl leaving the lagoons. On the Lantana Road they
drew bridle at a sign from her; then she wheeled her horse and
sat silent in her saddle, staring into the western wilderness.</p>

<p>The character of the country had changed while they had been
advancing along this white sandy road edged with jungle; for now
west and south the Florida wilderness stretched away, the strange
"Flat-woods," deceptively open, almost park-like in their monotony
where, as far as the eye could see, glade after glade, edged by
the stately vivid green pines, opened invitingly into other glades
through endlessly charming perspective. At every step one was
prepared to come upon some handsome mansion centring this park&mdash;some
bridge spanning the shallow crystal streams that ran out of jasmine
thickets&mdash;some fine driveway curving through the open woods. But
this was the wilderness, uninhabited, unplotted. No dwelling stood
within its vistas; no road led out or in; no bridge curved over
the silently moving waters. West and south-west into the unknown
must he go who follows the lure of those peaceful, sunny glades
where there are no hills, no valleys, nothing save trees and trees
and trees again, and shallow streams with jungle edging them,
and lonely lakes set with cypress, and sunny clearings, never
made by human hands, where last year's grass, shoulder-high, silvers
under the white sun of the South.</p>

<p>Half a hundred miles westward lay the great inland lake; south-west,
the Everglades. The Hillsboro trail ran south-west between the
upper and lower chain of lakes, over Little Fish Crossing, along
the old Government trail, and over the Loxahatchi. Westward no
trail lay save those blind signs of the Seminoles across the wastes
of open timber and endless stretches of lagoon and saw-grass which
is called the Everglades.</p>

<p>On the edge of the road where Hamil sat his horse was an old
pump&mdash;the last indication of civilisation. He dismounted and tried
it, filling his cup with clear sparkling water, neither hot nor
cold, and walking through the sand offered it to Shiela Cardross.</p>

<p>"Osceola's font," she nodded, returning from her abstraction;
"thank you, I am thirsty." And she drained the cup at her leisure,
pausing at moments to look into the west as though the wilderness
had already laid its spell upon her.</p>

<p>Then she looked down at Hamil beside her, handing him the cup.</p>

<p>"<em>In-nah-cahpoor?</em>" she asked softly; and as he looked
up puzzled and smiling: "I asked you, in Seminole, what is the
price I have to pay for your cup of water?"</p>

<p>"A little love," he said quietly&mdash;"a very little, Shiela."</p>

<p>"I see!&mdash;like this water, neither warm nor cold: <em>nac-ey-tai?</em>&mdash;what
do you call it?&mdash;oh, yes, sisterly affection." She looked down
at him with a forced smile. "<em>Uncah</em>" she said, "which
in Seminole means 'yes' to your demand.... You don't mind if I
relapse into the lake dialect occasionally&mdash;do you?&mdash;especially
when I'm afraid to say it in English." And, gaining confidence,
she smiled at him, the faintest hint of tenderness in her eyes.
"Neither warm nor cold&mdash;<em>Haiee-Kasapi</em>!&mdash;like this Indian
well, Mr. Hamil; but, like it, very faithful&mdash;even when in the
arid days to come you turn to drink from sweeter springs."</p>

<p>"Shiela!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;no!" she breathed, releasing her hands; "you interrupt
me; I was thinking <em>ist-ahmah-mahhen</em>&mdash;which way we must
go. Listen; we leave the road yonder where Gray's green butterfly
net is bobbing above the dead grass: <em>in-e-gitskah?</em>&mdash;can't
you see it? And there are dad and Stent riding in line with that
outpost pine&mdash;<em>ho-paiee</em>! Mount, my cavalier. And"&mdash;in
a lower voice&mdash;"perhaps you also may hear that voice in the wilderness
which cried once to the unwise."</p>

<p>As they rode girth-high through the grass the first enchanting
glade opened before them, flanked by palmettos and pines. Gray
was galloping about in the woods among swarms of yellow and brown
butterflies, swishing his net like a polo mallet, and drawing
bridle every now and then to examine some specimen and drop it
into the cyanide jar which bulged from his pocket.</p>

<p>"I got a lot of those dog's-head fellows!" he called out to Shiela
as she came past with Hamil. "You remember that the white ants
got at my other specimens before I could mount them."</p>

<p>"I remember," said Shiela; "don't ride too hard in the sun, dear."
But Gray saw something ahead and shook out his bridle, and soon
left them in the rear once more, riding through endless glades
of green where there was no sound except the creak of leather
and the continuous popping of those small pods on the seeds of
which quail feed.</p>

<p>"I thought there were no end of gorgeous flowers in the semi-tropics,"
he said, "but there's almost nothing here except green."</p>

<p>She laughed. "The concentration of bloom in Northern hothouses
deceives people. The semi-tropics and the tropics are almost monotonously
green except where cultivated gardens exist. There are no masses
of flowers anywhere; even the great brilliant blossoms make no
show because they are widely scattered. You notice them when you
happen to come across them in the woods, they are so brilliant
and so rare."</p>

<p>"Are there no fruits&mdash;those delectable fruits one reads about?"</p>

<p>"There are bitter wild oranges, sour guavas, eatable beach-grapes
and papaws. If you're fond of wild cassava and can prepare it
so it won't poison you, you can make an eatable paste. If you
like oily cabbage, the top of any palmetto will furnish it. But,
my poor friend, there's little here to tempt one's appetite or
satisfy one's aesthetic hunger for flowers. Our Northern meadows
are far more gorgeous from June to October; and our wild fruits
are far more delicious than what one finds growing wild in the
tropics."</p>

<p>"But bananas, cocoa-nuts, oranges&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All cultivated!"</p>

<p>"Persimmons, mulberries&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All cultivated when eatable. Everything palatable in this country
is cultivated."</p>

<p>He laughed dejectedly, then, again insistent: "But there <em>are</em>
plenty of wild flowering trees!&mdash;magnolia, poinciana, china-berry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All set out by mere man," she smiled&mdash;"except the magnolias
and dog-wood. No, Mr. Hamil, the riotous tropical bloom one reads
about is confined to people's gardens. When you come upon jasmine
or an orchid in the woods you notice the colour at once in the
green monotony. But think how many acres of blue and white and
gold one passes in the North with scarcely a glance! The South
is beautiful too, in its way; but it is not that way. Yet I care
for it even more, perhaps, than I do for the North&mdash;"</p>

<p>The calm, even tenor of the speech between them was reassuring
her, although it was solving no problems which, deep in her breast,
she knew lay latent, ready to quicken at any instant.</p>

<p>All that awaited to be solved; all that threatened between her
and her heart and conscience, now lay within her, quiescent for
the moment. And it was from moment to moment now that she was
living, blindly evading, resolutely putting off what must come
after that relentless self-examination which was still before
her.</p>

<p>The transport wagon was now in sight ahead; and Bulow, one of
the guides, had released a brace of setters, casting them out
among the open pines.</p>

<p>Away raced the belled dogs, jingling into the saw-scrub; and
Shiela nodded to him to prepare for a shot as she drew her own
gun from its boot and loaded, eyes still following the distant
dogs.</p>

<p>To and fro raced the setters, tails low, noses up, wheeling,
checking, quartering, cutting up acres and acres&mdash;a stirring sight!&mdash;and
more stirring still when the blue-ticked dog, catching the body-scent,
slowed down, flag whipping madly, and began to crawl into the
wind.</p>

<p>"You and Shiela!" called out Cardross as they trotted up, guns
resting on their thighs. "Gray and I'll pick up the singles."</p>

<p>The girl sprang to the ground, gun poised; Hamil followed her,
and they walked across the sandy open where scarcely a tuft of
dead grass bristled. It seemed impossible that any living creature
bigger than an ant could conceal itself on that bare, arid sand
stretch, but the ticked dog was standing rigid, nose pointing
almost between his forefeet, and the red dog was backing him,
tail like a ramrod, right forefoot doubled, jaws a-slaver.</p>

<p>The girl glanced sideways at Hamil mischievously.</p>

<p>"What are we shooting for, Mr. Hamil?"</p>

<p>"Anything you wish," he said, "but it's yours anyway&mdash;all I can
give. I suppose I'm going to miss."</p>

<p>"No; you mustn't. If you're out of practice remember to let them
get well away. And I won't shoot a match with you this time. Shall
I flush?"</p>

<p>"I'll put them up. Are you ready?"</p>

<p>"Quite, thank you."</p>

<p>He stepped up beside the ticked dog, halted, took one more step
beyond&mdash;whir-r-r! and the startled air was filled with wings;
and crack! crack! crack-crack! spoke the smokeless powder.</p>

<p>Two quail stopped in mid-air and pitched downward.</p>

<p>"O Lord!" said Hamil, "they're not my birds. Shiela, how <em>could</em>
you do such a thing under my very nose and in sight of your relatives
and three unfeeling guides!"</p>

<p>"You poor boy'" she said, watching the bevy as he picked up the
curious, dark, little Florida quail and displayed them. Then,
having marked, she quietly signalled the dogs forward.</p>

<p>"I'm not going," he said; "I've performed sufficiently."</p>

<p>She was not quite sure how much of disappointment lay under his
pretence, and rather shyly she suggested that he redeem himself.
Gray and his father were walking toward one dog who was now standing;
two quail flushed and both fell.</p>

<p>"Come," she said, laying her hand lightly on his arm; "Ticky
is pointing and I <em>will</em> have you redeem yourself."</p>

<p>So they went forward, shoulder to shoulder; and three birds jumped
and two fell.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" she exclaimed radiantly; "I knew my cavalier after all!"</p>

<p>"You held your fire," he said accusingly.</p>

<p>"Ye-s."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;if you&mdash;" She raised her eyes half serious, half mockingly:
"Do you think I care for&mdash;anything&mdash;at your expense?"</p>

<p>A thrill passed through him. "Do you think I mind if you are
the better of us, you generous girl?"</p>

<p>"I am not a better shot; I really am not.... Look at these birds&mdash;both
cocks. Are they not funny&mdash;these quaint little black quail of
the semi-tropics? We'll need all we can get, too. But now that
you are your resistless self again I shall cease to dread the
alternative of starvation or a resort to alligator tail."</p>

<p>So with a gay exchange of badinage they took their turns when
the dogs rounded up singles; and sometimes he missed shamefully,
and sometimes he performed with credit, but she never amended
his misses nor did more than match his successes, and he thought
that in all his life he had never witnessed more faultless field
courtesy than this young girl instinctively displayed. Nothing
in the world could have touched him more keenly or convinced him
more thoroughly. For it is on the firing line that character shows;
a person is what he is in the field&mdash;even though he sometimes
neglects to live up to it in less vital moments.</p>

<p>Generous and quick in her applause, sensitive under his failures,
cool in difficulties, yielding instantly the slightest advantage
to him, holding her fire when singles rose or where there could
be the slightest doubt&mdash;that was his shooting companion under
the white noon sun that day. He noticed, too, her sweetness with
the dogs, her quick encouragement when work was well done, her
brief rebuke when the red dog, galloping recklessly down wind,
jumped a ground-rattler and came within a hair's breadth of being
bitten.</p>

<p>"The little devil!" said Hamil, looking down at the twisting
reptile which he had killed with a palmetto stem. "Why, Shiela,
he has no rattles at all."</p>

<p>"No, only a button. Dig a hole and bury the head. Fangs are always
fangs whether their owner is dead or alive."</p>

<p>So Hamil scooped out a trench with his hunting-knife and they
buried the little ground-rattler while both dogs looked on, growling.</p>

<p>Cardross and Gray had remounted; Bulow cast out a brace of pointers
for them, and they were already far away. Presently the distant
crack of their guns announced that fresh bevies had been found
beyond the branch.</p>

<p>The guide, Carter, rode out, bringing Shiela and Hamil their
horses and relieving the latter's pockets of a dozen birds; announcing
a halt for luncheon at the same time in a voice softly neglectful
of <em>I's</em> and <em>R's</em>, and musical with aspirates.</p>

<p>As they followed him slowly toward the wagon which stood half
a mile away under a group of noble pines, Hamil began in a low
voice:</p>

<p>"I've got to say this, Shiela: I never saw more perfect sportsmanship
than yours; and, if only for that, I love you with all my heart."</p>

<p>"What a boyish thing to say!" But she coloured deliciously.</p>

<p>"You don't care whether I love you&mdash;that way, do you?" he asked
hopefully.</p>

<p>"N-no."</p>

<p>"Then &mdash;I can wait."</p>

<p>She turned toward him, confused.</p>

<p>"Wait?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;wait; all my life, if it must be."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to wait for. Don't say such things to me. <em>I&mdash;</em>it's
difficult enough for me now&mdash;to think what to do &mdash;You will
not speak to me again that way, will you? Because, if you do,
I must send you away.... And that will be&mdash;hard."</p>

<p>"Once," he said, "you spoke about men&mdash;how they come crashing
through the barriers of friendship. Am I like that?"</p>

<p>She hesitated, looked at him.</p>

<p>"There were no barriers."</p>

<p>"No barriers!"</p>

<p>"None&mdash;to keep you out. I should have seen to it; I should have
been prepared; but you came so naturally into my friendship&mdash;inside
the barriers&mdash;that I opened my eyes and found you there&mdash;and remembered,
too late, alas&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Too late?"</p>

<p>"Too late to shut you out. And you frightened me last night;
I tried to tell you&mdash;for your own sake; I was terrified, and I
told you what I have never before told a living soul&mdash;that dreadful,
hopeless, nightmare thing&mdash;to drive you out of my&mdash;my regard&mdash;and
me from yours."</p>

<p>His face whitened a little under its tan, but the flat jaw muscles
tightened doggedly.</p>

<p>"I don't understand&mdash;yet," he said. "And when you tell me&mdash;for
you will tell me sooner or later&mdash;it will not change me."</p>

<p>"It <em>must</em>!"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>She said in desperation: "You cannot care for me too much because
you know that I am&mdash;not free."</p>

<p>"Cannot?" He laughed mirthlessly. "I <em>am</em> caring for you&mdash;loving
you&mdash;every second more and more."</p>

<p>"That is dishonourable," she faltered.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You <em>know</em>!"</p>

<p>"Yes. But if it does not change me how can I help it?"</p>

<p>"You can help making me care for <em>you</em>!"</p>

<p>His heart was racing now; every vein ran fiery riot.</p>

<p>"Is there a chance of <em>that</em>, Shiela?"</p>

<p>She did not answer, but the tragedy in her slowly lifted eyes
appalled him. Then a rushing confusion of happiness and pain almost
stupefied him.</p>

<p>"You must not be afraid," he managed to say while the pulse hammered
in his throat, and the tumult of his senses deadened his voice
to a whisper.</p>

<p>"I am afraid."</p>

<p>They were near the wagon now; both dismounted under the pines
while Bulow came forward to picket their horses. On their way
together among the trees she looked up at him almost piteously:
"You must go if you talk to me again like this. I could not endure
very much of it."</p>

<p>"I don't know what I am going to do," he said in the same curiously
deadened voice. "You must tell me more."</p>

<p>"I cannot. I am&mdash;uncertain of myself. I can't think clearly when
we&mdash;when you speak to me&mdash;this way. Couldn't you go North before
<em>I&mdash;</em>before my unhappiness becomes too real&mdash;too hard?&mdash;couldn't
you go before it is too late&mdash;and leave me my peace of mind, my
common sense!"</p>

<p>He looked around at her. "Yes," he said, "I will go if there
is no decent chance for us; and if it is not too late."</p>

<p>"I have my common senses still left. It is not too late."</p>

<p>There was a silence. "I will go," he said very quietly.</p>

<p>"W-when?"</p>

<p>"The day we return."</p>

<p>"Can you leave your work?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Halloran knows."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;you <em>will</em> go?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you wish it."</p>

<p>Another silence. Then she shook her head, not looking at him.</p>

<p>"There is no use in going&mdash;now."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because I do not wish it." Her eyes fell lower; she
drew a long, unsteady breath. "And because it is too late," she
said. "You should have gone before I ever knew you&mdash;if I was to
be spared my peace of mind."</p>

<p>Gray came galloping back through the woods, followed by his father
and Eudo Stent. They were rather excited, having found signs of
turkey along the mud of a distant branch; and, as they all gathered
around a cold luncheon spread beside the wagon, a lively discussion
began concerning the relative chances of "roosting" and "yelping."</p>

<p>Hamil talked as in a dream, scarcely conscious that he was speaking
and laughing a great deal. A heavenly sort of intoxication possessed
him; a paradise of divine unrealities seemed to surround him &mdash;Shiela,
the clustering pines, the strange white sunlight, the depthless
splendour of the unshadowed blue above.</p>

<p>He heard vaguely the voices of the others, Cardross, senior,
rallying Gray on his shooting, Gray replying in kind, the soft
Southern voices of the guides at their own repast by the picket
line, the stir and whisk and crunch of horses nuzzling their feed.</p>

<p>Specks moved in the dome of heaven&mdash;buzzards. Below, through
the woods, myriads of robins were flying about, migrants from
the North.</p>

<p>Gray displayed his butterflies; nothing uncommon, except a black
and green one seldom found north of Miami&mdash;but they all bent over
the lovely fragile creatures, admiring the silver-spangled Dione
butterflies, the great velvety black Turnus; and Shiela, with
the point of a dry pine needle, traced for Hamil the grotesque
dog's head on the fore wings of those lemon-tinted butterflies
which haunt the Florida flat-woods.</p>

<p>"He'd never win at a bench-show," observed her father, lighting
his pipe&mdash;an out-of-door luxury he clung to. "Shiela, you little
minx, what makes you look so unusually pretty? Probably that wild-west
rig of yours. Hamil, I hope you gave her a few points on grassing
a bird. She's altogether too conceited. Do you know, once, while
we were picking up singles, a razor-back boar charged us&mdash;or more
probably the dogs, which were standing, poor devils. And upon
my word I was so rattled that I did the worst thing possible &mdash;I
tried to kick the dogs loose. Of course they went all to pieces,
and I don't know how it might have fared with us if my little
daughter had not calmly bowled over that boar at three paces from
my shin-bones!"</p>

<p>"Dad exaggerates," observed the girl with heightened colour,
then ventured a glance at Hamil which set his heart galloping;
and her own responded to the tender pride and admiration in his
eyes.</p>

<p>There was more discussion concerning "roosting" versus "yelping"
with dire designs upon the huge wild turkey-cock whose tracks
Gray had discovered in the mud along the branch where their camp
was to be pitched.</p>

<p>Seven hens and youthful gobblers accompanied this patriarch according
to Eudo Stent's calculations, and Bulow thought that the Seminole
might know the location of the roost; probably deep in some uninviting
swamp.</p>

<p>But there was plenty of time to decide what to do when they reached
camp; and half an hour later they started, wagon and all, wheels
bumping over the exposed tree roots which infinitely bored the
well-behaved dogs, squatting forward, heads in a row, every nose
twitching at the subtle forest odours that only a dog could detect.</p>

<p>Once they emitted short and quickly stifled yelps as a 'possum
climbed leisurely into a small tree and turned to inspect the
strange procession which was invading his wilderness. And Shiela
and Hamil, riding behind the wagon, laughed like children.</p>

<p>Once they passed under a heronry&mdash;a rather odoriferous patch
of dead cypress and pines, where the enormous nests bulged in
the stark tree-tops; and once, as they rode out into a particularly
park-like and velvety glade, five deer looked up, and then deliberately
started to trot across.</p>

<p>"We need that venison!" exclaimed Gray, motioning for his gun
which was in the wagon. Shiela spurred forward, launching her
mount into a gallop; Hamil's horse followed on a dead run, he
tugging madly at the buck-shot shell in his web belt; and away
they tore to head the deer. In vain! for the agile herd bounded
past far out of shell-range and went crashing on through the jungle
of the branch; and Shiela reined in and turned her flushed face
to Hamil with a laugh of sheer delight.</p>

<p>"Glorious sight, wasn't it?" said Hamil. "I'm rather glad they
got clear of us."</p>

<p>"So am I. There was no chance, but I always try."</p>

<p>"So shall I," he said&mdash;"whether there is a chance or not."</p>

<p>She looked up quickly, reading his meaning. Then she bent over
the gun that she was breaking, extracted the shells, looped them,
and returned the weapon to its holster.</p>

<p>Behind them her father and brother jeered at them for their failure,
Gray being particularly offensive in ascribing their fiasco to
bad riding and buck-fever.</p>

<p>A little later Shiela's horse almost unseated her, leaping aside
and into the jungle as an enormous black snake coiled close in
front.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot!" she cried out to Hamil, mastering her horse and
forcing him past the big, handsome, harmless reptile; "nobody
shoots black snakes or buzzards here. Slip your gun back quickly
or Gray will torment you."</p>

<p>However, Gray had seen, and kept up a running fire of sarcastic
comment which made Hamil laugh and Shiela indignant.</p>

<p>And so they rode along through the rich afternoon sunshine, now
under the clustered pines, now across glades where wild doves
sprang up into clattering flight displaying the four white feathers,
or pretty little ground doves ran fearlessly between the horses'
legs.</p>

<p>Here and there a crimson cardinal, crest lifted, sat singing
deliciously on some green bough; now and then a summer tanager
dropped like a live coal into the deeper jungle. Great shiny blue,
crestless jays flitted over the scrub; shy black and white and
chestnut chewinks flirted into sight and out again among the heaps
of dead brush; red-bellied woodpeckers, sticking to the tree trunks,
turned their heads calmly; gray lizards, big, ugly red-headed
lizards, swift slender lizards with blue tails raced across the
dry leaves or up tree trunks, making even more fuss and clatter
than the noisy cinnamon-tinted thrashers in the underbrush.</p>

<p>Every step into the unknown was a new happiness; there was no
silence there for those who could hear, no solitude for those
who could see. And he was riding into it with a young companion
who saw and heard and loved and understood it all. Nothing escaped
her; no frail air plant trailing from the high water oaks, no
school of tiny bass in the shallows where their horses splashed
through, no gopher burrow, no foot imprint of the little wild
things which haunt the water's edge in forests.</p>

<p>Her eyes missed nothing; her dainty close-set ears heard all&mdash;the
short, dry note of a chewink, the sweet, wholesome song of the
cardinal, the thrilling cries of native jays and woodpeckers,
the heavenly outpoured melody of the Florida wren, perched on
some tiptop stem, throat swelling under the long, delicate, upturned
bill.</p>

<p>Void of self-consciousness, sweetly candid in her wisdom, sharing
her lore with him as naturally as she listened to his, small wonder
that to him the wilderness was paradise, and she with her soft
full voice, a native guide. For all around them lay an enchanted
world as young as they&mdash;the world is never older than the young!&mdash;and
they "had eyes and they saw; ears had they and they heard"&mdash;but
not the dead echoes of that warning voice, alas! calling through
the ancient wilderness of fable.</p>
