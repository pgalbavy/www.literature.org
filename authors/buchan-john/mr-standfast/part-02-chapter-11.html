<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I slept for one and three-quarter hours that night, and when
I awoke I seemed to emerge from deeps of slumber which had lasted
for days. That happens sometimes after heavy fatigue and great
mental strain. Even a short sleep sets up a barrier between past
and present which has to be elaborately broken down before you
can link on with what has happened before. As my wits groped at
the job some drops of rain splashed on my face through the broken
roof. That hurried me out-of-doors. It was just after dawn and
the sky was piled with thick clouds, while a wet wind blew up
from the southwest. The long-prayed-for break in the weather seemed
to have come at last. A deluge of rain was what I wanted, something
to soak the earth and turn the roads into water-courses and clog
the enemy transport, something above all to blind the enemy’s
eyes.... For I remembered what a preposterous bluff it all had
been, and what a piteous broken handful stood between the Germans
and their goal. If they knew, if they only knew, they would brush
us aside like flies.</p>

<p>As I shaved I looked back on the events of yesterday as on something
that had happened long ago. I seemed to judge them impersonally,
and I concluded that it had been a pretty good fight. A scratch
force, half of it dog-tired and half of it untrained, had held
up at least a couple of fresh divisions.... But we couldn’t do
it again, and there were still some hours before us of desperate
peril. When had the Corps said that the French would arrive?...
I was on the point of shouting for Hamilton to get Wake to ring
up Corps Headquarters, when I remembered that Wake was dead. I
had liked him and greatly admired him, but the recollection gave
me scarcely a pang. We were all dying, and he had only gone on
a stage ahead.</p>

<p>There was no morning <em>strafe</em>, such as had been our usual
fortune in the past week. I went out-of-doors and found a noiseless
world under the lowering sky. The rain had stopped falling, the
wind of dawn had lessened, and I feared that the storm would be
delayed. I wanted it at once to help us through the next hours
of tension. Was it in six hours that the French were coming? No,
it must be four. It couldn’t be more than four, unless somebody
had made an infernal muddle. I wondered why everything was so
quiet. It would be breakfast time on both sides, but there seemed
no stir of man’s presence in that ugly strip half a mile off.
Only far back in the German hinterland I seemed to hear the rumour
of traffic.</p>

<p>An unslept and unshaven figure stood beside me which revealed
itself as Archie Roylance.</p>

<p>"Been up all night," he said cheerfully, lighting a cigarette.
"No, I haven’t had breakfast. The skipper thought we’d better
get another anti-aircraft battery up this way, and I was superintendin’
the job. He’s afraid of the Hun gettin’ over your lines and spying
out the nakedness of the land. For, you know, we’re uncommon naked,
sir. Also," and Archie’s face became grave, "the Hun’s pourin’
divisions down on this sector. As I judge, he’s blowin’ up for
a thunderin’ big drive on both sides of the river. Our lads yesterday
said all the country back of Peronne was lousy with new troops.
And he’s gettin’ his big guns forward, too. You haven’t been troubled
with them yet, but he has got the roads mended and the devil of
a lot of new light railways, and any moment we’ll have the five-point-nines
sayin’ Good-mornin’.... Pray Heaven you get relieved in time,
sir. I take it there’s not much risk of another push this mornin’?"</p>

<p>"I don’t think so. The Boche took a nasty knock yesterday, and
he must fancy we’re pretty strong after that counter-attack. I
don’t think he’ll strike till he can work both sides of the river,
and that’ll take time to prepare. That’s what his fresh divisions
are for.... But remember, he can attack now, if he likes. If he
knew how weak we were he’s strong enough to send us all to glory
in the next three hours. It’s just that knowledge that you fellows
have got to prevent his getting. If a single Hun plane crosses
our lines and returns, we’re wholly and utterly done. You’ve given
us splendid help since the show began, Archie. For God’s sake
keep it up to the finish and put every machine you can spare in
this sector."</p>

<p>"We’re doin’ our best," he said. "We got some more fightin’ scouts
down from the north, and we’re keepin’ our eyes skinned. But you
know as well as I do, sir, that it’s never an ab-so-lute certainty.
If the Hun sent over a squadron we might beat ’em all down but
one, and that one might do the trick. It’s a matter of luck. The
Hun’s got the wind up all right in the air just now and I don’t
blame the poor devil. I’m inclined to think we haven’t had the
pick of his push here. Jennings says he’s doin’ good work in Flanders,
and they reckon there’s the deuce of a thrust comin’ there pretty
soon. I think we can manage the kind of footler he’s been sendin’
over here lately, but if Lensch or some lad like that were to
choose to turn up I wouldn’t say what might happen. The air’s
a big lottery," and Archie turned a dirty face skyward where two
of our planes were moving very high towards the east.</p>

<p>The mention of Lensch brought Peter to mind, and I asked if he
had gone back.</p>

<p>"He won’t go," said Archie, "and we haven’t the heart to make
him. He’s very happy, and plays about with the Gladas single-seater.
He’s always speakin’ about you, sir, and it’d break his heart
if we shifted him."</p>

<p>I asked about his health, and was told that he didn’t seem to
have much pain.</p>

<p>"But he’s a bit queer," and Archie shook a sage head. "One of
the reasons why he won’t budge is because he says God has some
work for him to do. He’s quite serious about it, and ever since
he got the notion he has perked up amazin’. He’s always askin’
about Lensch, too—not vindictive like, you understand, but quite
friendly. Seems to take a sort of proprietary interest in him.
I told him Lensch had had a far longer spell of first-class fightin’
than anybody else and was bound by the law of averages to be downed
soon, and he was quite sad about it."</p>

<p>I had no time to worry about Peter. Archie and I swallowed breakfast
and I had a pow-wow with my brigadiers. By this time I had got
through to Corps <em>H.Q. </em>and got news of the French. It
was worse than I expected. General Peguy would arrive about ten
o’clock, but his men couldn’t take over till well after midday.
The Corps gave me their whereabouts and I found it on the map.
They had a long way to cover yet, and then there would be the
slow business of relieving. I looked at my watch. There were still
six hours before us when the Boche might knock us to blazes, six
hours of maddening anxiety.... Lefroy announced that all was quiet
on the front, and that the new wiring at the Bois de la Bruyere
had been completed. Patrols had reported that during the night
a fresh German division seemed to have relieved that which we
had punished so stoutly yesterday. I asked him if he could stick
it out against another attack. "No," he said without hesitation.
"We’re too few and too shaky on our pins to stand any more. I’ve
only a man to every three yards." That impressed me, for Lefroy
was usually the most devil-may-care optimist.</p>

<p>"Curse it, there’s the sun," I heard Archie cry. It was true,
for the clouds were rolling back and the centre of the heavens
was a patch of blue. The storm was coming—I could smell it in
the air—but probably it wouldn’t break till the evening. Where,
I wondered, would we be by that time?</p>

<p>It was now nine o’clock, and I was keeping tight hold on myself,
for I saw that I was going to have hell for the next hours. I
am a pretty stolid fellow in some ways, but I have always found
patience and standing still the most difficult job to tackle,
and my nerves were all tattered from the long strain of the retreat.
I went up to the line and saw the battalion commanders. Everything
was unwholesomely quiet there. Then I came back to my headquarters
to study the reports that were coming in from the air patrols.
They all said the same thing—abnormal activity in the German back
areas. Things seemed shaping for a new 21st of March, and, if
our luck were out, my poor little remnant would have to take the
shock. I telephoned to the Corps and found them as nervous as
me. I gave them the details of my strength and heard an agonised
whistle at the other end of the line. I was rather glad I had
companions in the same purgatory.</p>

<p>I found I couldn’t sit still. If there had been any work to do
I would have buried myself in it, but there was none. Only this
fearsome job of waiting. I hardly ever feel cold, but now my blood
seemed to be getting thin, and I astonished my staff by putting
on a British warm and buttoning up the collar. Round that derelict
farm I ranged like a hungry wolf, cold at the feet, queasy in
the stomach, and mortally edgy in the mind.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the cloud lifted from me, and the blood seemed
to run naturally in my veins. I experienced the change of mood
which a man feels sometimes when his whole being is fined down
and clarified by long endurance. The fight of yesterday revealed
itself as something rather splendid. What risks we had run and
how gallantly we had met them! My heart warmed as I thought of
that old division of mine, those ragged veterans that were never
beaten as long as breath was left them. And the Americans and
the boys from the machine-gun school and all the oddments we had
commandeered! And old Blenkiron raging like a good-tempered lion!
It was against reason that such fortitude shouldn’t win out. We
had snarled round and bitten the Boche so badly that he wanted
no more for a little. He would come again, but presently we should
be relieved and the gallant blue-coats, fresh as paint and burning
for revenge, would be there to worry him.</p>

<p>I had no new facts on which to base my optimism, only a changed
point of view. And with it came a recollection of other things.
Wake’s death had left me numb before, but now the thought of it
gave me a sharp pang. He was the first of our little confederacy
to go. But what an ending he had made, and how happy he had been
in that mad time when he had come down from his pedestal and become
one of the crowd! He had found himself at the last, and who could
grudge him such happiness? If the best were to be taken, he would
be chosen first, for he was a big man, before whom I uncovered
my head. The thought of him made me very humble. I had never had
his troubles to face, but he had come clean through them, and
reached a courage which was for ever beyond me. He was the Faithful
among us pilgrims, who had finished his journey before the rest.
Mary had foreseen it. "There is a price to be paid," she had said—"the
best of us."</p>

<p>And at the thought of Mary a flight of warm and happy hopes seemed
to settle on my mind. I was looking again beyond the war to that
peace which she and I would some day inherit. I had a vision of
a green English landscape, with its far-flung scents of wood and
meadow and garden.... And that face of all my dreams, with the
eyes so childlike and brave and honest, as if they, too, saw beyond
the dark to a radiant country. A line of an old song, which had
been a favourite of my father’s, sang itself in my ears:</p>

<p>There’s an eye that ever weeps and a fair face will be fain When
I ride through Annan Water wi’ my bonny bands again!</p>

<p>We were standing by the crumbling rails of what had once been
the farm sheepfold. I looked at Archie and he smiled back at me,
for he saw that my face had changed. Then he turned his eyes to
the billowing clouds.</p>

<p>I felt my arm clutched.</p>

<p>"Look there!" said a fierce voice, and his glasses were turned
upward.</p>

<p>I looked, and far up in the sky saw a thing like a wedge of wild
geese flying towards us from the enemy’s country. I made out the
small dots which composed it, and my glass told me they were planes.
But only Archie’s practised eye knew that they were enemy.</p>

<p>"Boche?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Boche," he said. "My God, we’re for it now."</p>

<p>My heart had sunk like a stone, but I was fairly cool. I looked
at my watch and saw that it was ten minutes to eleven.</p>

<p>"How many?"</p>

<p>"Five," said Archie. "Or there may be six—not more."</p>

<p>"Listen!" I said. "Get on to your headquarters. Tell them that
it’s all up with us if a single plane gets back. Let them get
well over the line, the deeper in the better, and tell them to
send up every machine they possess and down them all. Tell them
it’s life or death. Not one single plane goes back. Quick!"</p>

<p>Archie disappeared, and as he went our anti-aircraft guns broke
out. The formation above opened and zigzagged, but they were too
high to be in much danger. But they were not too high to see that
which we must keep hidden or perish.</p>

<p>The roar of our batteries died down as the invaders passed westward.
As I watched their progress they seemed to be dropping lower.
Then they rose again and a bank of cloud concealed them.</p>

<p>I had a horrid certainty that they must beat us, that some at
any rate would get back. They had seen thin lines and the roads
behind us empty of supports. They would see, as they advanced,
the blue columns of the French coming up from the south-west,
and they would return and tell the enemy that a blow now would
open the road to Amiens and the sea. He had plenty of strength
for it, and presently he would have overwhelming strength. It
only needed a spear-point to burst the jerry-built dam and let
the flood through.... They would return in twenty minutes, and
by noon we would be broken. Unless—unless the miracle of miracles
happened, and they never returned.</p>

<p>Archie reported that his skipper would do his damnedest and that
our machines were now going up. "We’ve a chance, sir," he said,
"a good sportin’ chance." It was a new Archie, with a hard voice,
a lean face, and very old eyes.</p>

<p>Behind the jagged walls of the farm buildings was a knoll which
had once formed part of the high-road. I went up there alone,
for I didn’t want anybody near me. I wanted a viewpoint, and I
wanted quiet, for I had a grim time before me. From that knoll
I had a big prospect of country. I looked east to our lines on
which an occasional shell was falling, and where I could hear
the chatter of machine-guns. West there was peace for the woods
closed down on the landscape. Up to the north, I remember, there
was a big glare as from a burning dump, and heavy guns seemed
to be at work in the Ancre valley. Down in the south there was
the dull murmur of a great battle. But just around me, in the
gap, the deadliest place of all, there was an odd quiet. I could
pick out clearly the different sounds. Somebody down at the farm
had made a joke and there was a short burst of laughter. I envied
the humorist his composure. There was a clatter and jingle from
a battery changing position. On the road a tractor was jolting
along—I could hear its driver shout and the screech of its unoiled
axle.</p>

<p>My eyes were glued to my glasses, but they shook in my hands
so that I could scarcely see. I bit my lip to steady myself, but
they still wavered. From time to time I glanced at my watch. Eight
minutes gone—ten—seventeen. If only the planes would come into
sight! Even the certainty of failure would be better than this
harrowing doubt. They should be back by now unless they had swung
north across the salient, or unless the miracle of miracles—</p>

<p>Then came the distant yapping of an anti-aircraft gun, caught
up the next second by others, while smoke patches studded the
distant blue sky. The clouds were banking in mid-heaven, but to
the west there was a big clear space now woolly with shrapnel
bursts. I counted them mechanically—one—three—five—nine—with despair
beginning to take the place of my anxiety. My hands were steady
now, and through the glasses I saw the enemy.</p>

<p>Five attenuated shapes rode high above the bombardment, now sharp
against the blue, now lost in a film of vapour. They were coming
back, serenely, contemptuously, having seen all they wanted.</p>

<p>The quiet was gone now and the din was monstrous. Anti-aircraft
guns, singly and in groups, were firing from every side. As I
watched it seemed a futile waste of ammunition. The enemy didn’t
give a tinker’s curse for it.... But surely there was one down.
I could only count four now. No, there was the fifth coming out
of a cloud. In ten minutes they would be all over the line. I
fairly stamped in my vexation. Those guns were no more use than
a sick headache. Oh, where in God’s name were our own planes?</p>

<p>At that moment they came, streaking down into sight, four fighting-scouts
with the sun glinting on their wings and burnishing their metal
cowls. I saw clearly the rings of red, white, and blue. Before
their downward drive the enemy instantly spread out.</p>

<p>I was watching with bare eyes now, and I wanted companionship,
for the time of waiting was over. Automatically I must have run
down the knoll, for the next I knew I was staring at the heavens
with Archie by my side. The combatants seemed to couple instinctively.
Diving, wheeling, climbing, a pair would drop out of the melee
or disappear behind a cloud. Even at that height I could hear
the methodical rat-tat-tat of the machine-guns. Then there was
a sudden flare and wisp of smoke. A plane sank, turning and twisting,
to earth.</p>

<p>"Hun!" said Archie, who had his glasses on it.</p>

<p>Almost immediately another followed. This time the pilot recovered
himself, while still a thousand feet from the ground, and started
gliding for the enemy lines. Then he wavered, plunged sickeningly,
and fell headlong into the wood behind La Bruyere.</p>

<p>Farther east, almost over the front trenches, a two-seater Albatross
and a British pilot were having a desperate tussle. The bombardment
had stopped, and from where we stood every movement could be followed.
First one, then another, climbed uppermost and dived back, swooped
out and wheeled in again, so that the two planes seemed to clear
each other only by inches. Then it looked as if they closed and
interlocked. I expected to see both go crashing, when suddenly
the wings of one seemed to shrivel up, and the machine dropped
like a stone.</p>

<p>"Hun," said Archie. "That makes three. Oh, good lads! Good lads!"</p>

<p>Then I saw something which took away my breath. Sloping down
in wide circles came a German machine, and, following, a little
behind and a little above, a British. It was the first surrender
in mid-air I had seen. In my amazement I watched the couple right
down to the ground, till the enemy landed in a big meadow across
the high-road and our own man in a field nearer the river.</p>

<p>When I looked back into the sky, it was bare. North, south, east,
and west, there was not a sign of aircraft, British or German.</p>

<p>A violent trembling took me. Archie was sweeping the heavens
with his glasses and muttering to himself. Where was the fifth
man? He must have fought his way through, and it was too late.</p>

<p>But was it? From the toe of a great rolling cloud-bank a flame
shot earthwards, followed by a V-shaped trail of smoke. British
or Boche? British or Boche? I didn’t wait long for an answer.
For, riding over the far end of the cloud, came two of our fighting
scouts.</p>

<p>I tried to be cool, and snapped my glasses into their case, though
the reaction made me want to shout. Archie turned to me with a
nervous smile and a quivering mouth. "I think we have won on the
post," he said.</p>

<p>He reached out a hand for mine, his eyes still on the sky, and
I was grasping it when it was torn away. He was staring upwards
with a white face.</p>

<p>We were looking at the sixth enemy plane.</p>

<p>It had been behind the others and much lower, and was making
straight at a great speed for the east. The glasses showed me
a different type of machine—a big machine with short wings, which
looked menacing as a hawk in a covey of grouse. It was under the
cloud-bank, and above, satisfied, easing down after their fight,
and unwitting of this enemy, rode the two British craft.</p>

<p>A neighbouring anti-aircraft gun broke out into a sudden burst,
and I thanked Heaven for its inspiration. Curious as to this new
development, the two British turned, caught sight of the Boche,
and dived for him.</p>

<p>What happened in the next minutes I cannot tell. The three seemed
to be mixed up in a dog fight, so that I could not distinguish
friend from foe. My hands no longer trembled; I was too desperate.
The patter of machine-guns came down to us, and then one of the
three broke clear and began to climb. The others strained to follow,
but in a second he had risen beyond their fire, for he had easily
the pace of them. Was it the Hun?</p>

<p>Archie’s dry lips were talking.</p>

<p>"It’s Lensch," he said.</p>

<p>"How d’you know?" I gasped angrily.</p>

<p>"Can’t mistake him. Look at the way he slipped out as he banked.
That’s his patent trick."</p>

<p>In that agonizing moment hope died in me. I was perfectly calm
now, for the time for anxiety had gone. Farther and farther drifted
the British pilots behind, while Lensch in the completeness of
his triumph looped more than once as if to cry an insulting farewell.
In less than three minutes he would be safe inside his own lines,
and he carried the knowledge which for us was death.</p>

<p>Someone was bawling in my ear, and pointing upward. It was Archie
and his face was wild. I looked and gasped—seized my glasses and
looked again.</p>

<p>A second before Lensch had been alone; now there were two machines.</p>

<p>I heard Archie’s voice. "My God, it’s the Gladas—the little Gladas."
His fingers were digging into my arm and his face was against
my shoulder. And then his excitement sobered into an awe which
choked his speech, as he stammered—"It’s old—"</p>

<p>But I did not need him to tell me the name, for I had divined
it when I first saw the new plane drop from the clouds. I had
that queer sense that comes sometimes to a man that a friend is
present when he cannot see him. Somewhere up in the void two heroes
were fighting their last battle—and one of them had a crippled
leg.</p>

<p>I had never any doubt about the result, though Archie told me
later that he went crazy with suspense. Lensch was not aware of
his opponent till he was almost upon him, and I wonder if by any
freak of instinct he recognised his greatest antagonist. He never
fired a shot, nor did Peter.... I saw the German twist and side-slip
as if to baffle the fate descending upon him. I saw Peter veer
over vertically and I knew that the end had come. He was there
to make certain of victory and he took the only way. The machines
closed, there was a crash which I felt though I could not hear
it, and next second both were hurtling down, over and over, to
the earth.</p>

<p>They fell in the river just short of the enemy lines, but I did
not see them, for my eyes were blinded and I was on my knees.</p>

<p>After that it was all a dream. I found myself being embraced
by a French General of Division, and saw the first companies of
the cheerful bluecoats whom I had longed for. With them came the
rain, and it was under a weeping April sky that early in the night
I marched what was left of my division away from the battle-field.
The enemy guns were starting to speak behind us, but I did not
heed them. I knew that now there were warders at the gate, and
I believed that by the grace of God that gate was barred for ever.</p>

<p>They took Peter from the wreckage with scarcely a scar except
his twisted leg. Death had smoothed out some of the age in him,
and left his face much as I remembered it long ago in the Mashonaland
hills. In his pocket was his old battered <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em>.
It lies before me as I write, and beside it—for I was his only
legatee—the little case which came to him weeks later, containing
the highest honour that can be bestowed upon a soldier of Britain.</p>

<p>It was from the <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em> that I read next
morning, when in the lee of an apple-orchard Mary and Blenkiron
and I stood in the soft spring rain beside his grave. And what
I read was the tale in the end not of Mr Standfast, whom he had
singled out for his counterpart, but of Mr Valiant-for-Truth whom
he had not hoped to emulate. I set down the words as a salute
and a farewell:</p>

<p><em>"Then said he, ‘I am going to my Father’s; and though with
great difficulty I am got hither, yet now I do not repent me of
all the trouble I have been at to arrive where I am. My sword
I give to him that shall succeed me in my pilgrimage, and my courage
and skill to him that can get it. My marks and scars I carry with
me, to be a witness for me that I have fought His battles who
now will be my rewarder.’</em></p>

<p><em>"So he passed over, and all the trumpets sounded for him
on the other side."</em></p>
