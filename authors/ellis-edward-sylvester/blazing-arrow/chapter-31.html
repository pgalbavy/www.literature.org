<p>Simon Kenton had spent so many years of his life in the woods
and had been among the Shawanoes so much that he spoke their language
like a native. The reader need not be told that he was once a
prisoner of the Shawanoes, and was condemned to death by them,
but was saved through the interference of the renegade Simon Girty,
to whom the scout had done a kindness years before. This is the
only instance of the kind known of that miscreant.</p>

<p>It had also fallen to the lot of Kenton to run the gantlet, and
he had desperate scrimmages without number with members of that
warlike tribe. His frequent association with them, his companionship
with the extraordinary but unfortunate Deerfoot, had given him
a mastery of the tongue used by these people.</p>

<p>Kenton now turned to Red Crow and addressed him in the language
of his tribe:</p>

<p>"Arqu-wao, tell me why you wish to prove yourself a friend of
the white man."</p>

<p>"Arqu-wao crept upon the palefaces; they ran away with his canoe;
they came near his home, where the red and white man must not
come; but they went away, they did not hurt his canoe; he followed
them; he was about to kill them when they slept, but they awoke;
they could have killed him, but they did not; they spared his
life; then the Great Spirit whispered in his heart that he must
be the friend of the paleface youths; so Arqu-wao is their friend;
he will give his life for them."</p>

<p>Kenton listened gravely to this singular statement. His knowledge
of the Indian character assured him that every word was the truth.
Red Crow did not show by his words or manner that his brain was
not as clear as that of his brother, Blazing Arrow. The probability
was that it was partially affected only by the injury received
years before. It had led him to make a recluse of himself, and
to indulge in some whimsical performances. In other respects,
as he had proven, his cunning and ability were greater than before.</p>

<p>All doubt of his loyalty removed, Kenton proceeded to the business
he had in mind:</p>

<p>"To-day you met your brother, and you had a quarrel."</p>

<p>The black eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"Blazing Arrow is a snake in the grass, that bites when you are
not looking; he hates Arqu-wao; Arqu-wao hates him; some time
one will kill the other; the Great Spirit has said so."</p>

<p>"But you quarrelled," repeated Kenton, wishing to hear the explanation
of that dispute.</p>

<p>"Blazing Arrow said to Arqu-wao that he had turned against his
people; he said he had become the friend of the white man, and
he said he would kill him."</p>

<p>"And what did Arqu-wao do?"</p>

<p>"He drew his bow and arrow," replied Red Crow, with another flash
of his black eyes, "but Blazing Arrow said he would wait till
he learned more; then he would kill him."</p>

<p>Kenton suspected this from what the boys had told him, and he
plainly foresaw that the fatal encounter must come, sooner or
later, between these brothers, who hated each other with consuming
hate.</p>

<p>"You say that you know a better way to the settlement, where
we can take the horses?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;me know&mdash;me show," replied Red Crow, with such haste that
he unconsciously dropped into English, which he spoke ill.</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>The Shawanoe pointed behind him, and almost in the direction
of the lake, on whose shore he made his home.</p>

<p>"Ober dere&mdash;not far&mdash;show de way."</p>

<p>While Kenton believed in the truthfulness of the strange being,
he was disturbed by the fact that he himself had traversed this
section so many times that he was familiar with every portion,
and he could not recall any part answering to the description
of Red Crow. He feared that, while his intention was honest, the
thing itself was only a figment of the Indian's brain, and that
he was liable to draw them into greater difficulties than before.</p>

<p>If this should prove to be the case, it would be better to abandon
the animals at once, for the remark of Mr. Edwards about the forest
being most difficult of passage was true. Not only that, but it
grew worse, until it became absolutely impassable for any quadruped
as large as a horse.</p>

<p>The plan the scout had in mind was that of the whole party returning
without delay to the block-house, and waiting till the danger
passed. Inasmuch as there was no call for haste on the part of
the pioneer in reaching his home, this, unquestionably, was the
better course to adopt. But Kenton was curious to learn something
more about this new route, for he saw that if it proved an actuality,
and was known to the Shawanoes, it was sure to be of vast value
to himself and other rangers who were compelled frequently to
pass back and forth between the two points. So, after a little
more unimportant talk, he added:</p>

<p>"Well, Arqu-wao, we will follow you. Show the way."</p>

<p>It will be remembered that when the pioneer and his wife set
out with Red Crow to find the boys they left the two horses behind
them. It was useless to bring them back over the route that had
cost the animals so much labor, and which would necessitate the
whole thing being done over again. In order to carry out the plan
of Red Crow it was necessary to go to where the horses were, or
to bring them back to the party. Kenton asked him what should
be done, and he replied that they were to await him where they
were while he brought the beasts to them. Accordingly the company
assumed new positions on the ground, Wharton sitting close to
his mother.</p>

<p>Before Red Cloud left, the boys restored to him the knife and
tomahawk, so that he was as fully armed as before. The Indian
smiled in his shadowy way, and showed that he appreciated the
confidence implied in the little act, which would have been performed
before had it not been overlooked.</p>

<p>When the Shawanoe was beyond hearing, Kenton said:</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be surprised if that varmint had trouble afore he
brings them hosses back."</p>

<p>"Why so?" asked Mr. Edwards.</p>

<p>"We've been talkin' and actin' as though thar warn't one of them
varmints in ten miles of us; but I haven't forgot that Blazing
Arrow knows why you turned off the trail with the hosses, and
if he hain't gone back himself he has sent some of 'em to l'arn
how things are goin'."</p>

<p>"Why haven't they appeared to us?"</p>

<p>"We ain't in the hole they want to get us into," replied Kenton,
who, in accordance with the custom of those of his calling, kept
glancing to the right and left, on the lookout for the first appearance
of peril. "They may have had a peep at us, and will keep an eye
on our movements, but are more likely to watch the hosses. They
ain't fur off, Brigham?"</p>

<p>"No; I didn't go far with them."</p>

<p>"Has Red Crow had time to reach the spot?"</p>

<p>"If he kept up the gait with which he started I should say he
is about there."</p>

<p>"Now, don't speak till I give the word," said Kenton, in a low
voice, "but listen with all your ears."</p>

<p>The entire party assumed attitudes of intense attention, and
were rewarded sooner than they anticipated. Amid the profound
stillness a sudden, sharp, twanging noise reached them, followed
instantly by a smothered, gasping cry, and then all was still.</p>

<p>The party looked in one another's faces. No need of any one speaking
a word, for all knew what those awful sounds meant.</p>

<p>Red Crow had driven an arrow into some dusky thief with such
swiftness and force that he had no time to utter the proverbial
yell of his race when he sank to the ground.</p>

<p>"Thar must have been only one of 'em," quietly remarked Kenton,
"or thar would be more of a rumpus. He has started."</p>

<p>The sound of the animals laboring through the bushes and among
the trees was plainly heard, and a minute later Red Crow appeared,
leading the pioneer's horse, while that of his wife followed close
behind.</p>

<p>It was agreed that no reference should be made by any one to
the tragedy that had taken place so near them. They waited for
Red Crow himself to tell the story, but though he was questioned
quite closely, he never said a word.</p>

<p>"Arqu-wao," said Kenton, in the Shawanoe language, "you have
a single tongue; you are a good Indian; now lead the way; we believe
in you and will trust you to the death."</p>

<p>For the first time since the Shawanoe had joined them, his painted
face gave evidence of emotion. He stood for several seconds with
his eyes fixed on Kenton, who calmly confronted him. He was on
the point of speaking, and once the boys, who were studying his
countenance with curious interest, observed a movement of his
thin lips, but he changed his mind and no words escaped him.</p>

<p>Turning abruptly away, he held the bridle-rein of the pioneer's
horse in one hand, and, with his long bow in the other, began
moving through the wood, which route may roughly be described
as half way between that just followed and the course of the trail
nearest them.</p>

<p>The work for a time was as hard as before, and the animal showed
so much reluctance that, in addition to the tugging at the rein
by the leader, he required some vigorous prodding from his master
before he would do his duty; but ere long a pleasant fact became
apparent to all; the wood was so open that it was a comparatively
easy matter for all to advance. If it should remain thus, they
could push on with little more trouble than that encountered in
travelling over the trail itself.</p>

<p>Of course, nothing was easier than for the Shawanoes to follow
the footprints of the party, and it was to guard against any surprise
of this kind that Kenton remained some distance behind the others.</p>
