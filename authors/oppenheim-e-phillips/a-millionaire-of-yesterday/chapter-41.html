He looked at him calmly, but in her set, white face he seemed to
read already his sentence!
<P>
"Do you think it worth while, Mr. Trent?  There is so much, as you
put it, to be explained, that the task, even to a man of your
versatility, seems hopeless!"
<P>
"I shall not trouble you long," he said.  "At least one man's word
should be as good as another's - and you have listened to what my
enemy " - he motioned towards Francis - " has to say."
<P>
Francis shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
"I can assure you," he interrupted, "that I have no feeling of
enmity towards you in the slightest.  My opinion you know.  I have
never troubled to conceal it.  But I deny that I am prejudiced
by any personal feeling."
<P>
Trent ignored his speech.
<P>
"What I have to say to you," he continued addressing Ernestine, "I
want to say before you see your father.  I won't take up your time.
I won't waste words.  I take you back ten years to when I met him
at Attra and we became partners in a certain enterprise.  Your
father at that time was a harmless wreck of a man who was fast
killing himself with brandy.  He had some money, I had none.  With
it we bought the necessary outfit and presents for my enterprise
and started for Bekwando.  The whole of the work fell to my share,
and with great trouble I succeeded in obtaining the concessions we
were working for.  Your father spent all his time drinking, and
playing cards, when I would play with him.  The agreement as to the
sharing of the profits was drawn up, it is true, by me, but at that
time he made no word of complaint.  I had no relations, he described
himself as cut off wholly from his.  It was here Francis first came
on the scene.  He found your father half drunk, and when he read
the agreement it was plain what he thought.  He thought that I was
letting your father kill himself that the whole thing might be mine.
He has probably told you so.  I deny it.  I did all I could to keep
him sober!
<P>
"On our homeward way your father was ill and our bearers deserted
us.  We were pursued by the natives, who repented their concession,
and I had to fight them more than once, half a dozen strong, with
your father unconscious at my feet.  It is true that I left him in
the bush, but it was at his bidding and I believed him dying.  It
was my only chance and I took it.  I escaped and reached Attra.
Then, to raise money to reach England, I had to borrow from a man
named Da Souza, and afterwards, in London, to start the Company, I
had to make him my partner in the profits of the concession.  One
day I quarrelled with him - it was just at the time I met you - and
then, for the first time, I heard of your father's being alive.  I
went out to Africa to bring him back and Da Souza followed me in
abject fear, for as my partner he lost half if your father's claim
was good.  I found your father infirm and only half sane.  I did
all I could for him whilst I worked in the interior, and meant to
bring him back to England with me when I came.  unfortunately he
recovered a little and suddenly seized upon the idea of visiting
England.  He left before me and fell into the hands of Da Souza,
who had the best possible reasons in the world for keeping him in
the background.  I rescued him from them in time to save him from
death and brought him to my own house, sent for doctors and nurses,
and, when he was fit for you to see, I should have sent for you.
I did not, I'll admit, make any public declaration of his existence,
for the simple reason that it would have crippled our Company, and
there are the interests of the shareholders to be considered, but
I executed and signed a deed of partnership days ago which makes
him an equal sharer in every penny I possess.  Now this is the
truth, Miss Wendermott, and if it is not a story I am particularly
proud of, I don't very well see what else I could have done.  It
is my story and it is a true one.  Will you believe it or will you
take his word against mine?"
<P>
She would have spoken, but Francis held up his hand.
<P>
"My story," he said coolly, "has been told behind your back.  It is
only fair to repeat it to your face.  I have told Miss Wendermott
this - that I met you first in the village of Bekwando with a
concession in your hand made out to you and her father jointly,
with the curious proviso that in the event of the death of one
the other was his heir.  I pointed out to Miss Wendermott that you
were in the prime of life and in magnificent condition, while her
father was already on the threshold of the grave and drinking
himself into a fever in a squalid hut in a village of swamps.  I
told her that I suspected foul play, that I followed you both and
found her father left to the tender mercies of the savages,
deserted by you in the bush.  I told her that many months afterwards
he disappeared, simultaneously with your arrival in the country,
that a day or two ago you swore to me you had no idea where he was.
That has been my story, Trent, let Miss Wendermott choose between
them."
<P>
"I am content," Trent cried fiercely.  "Your story is true enough,
but it is cunningly linked together.  You have done your worst.
Choose!"
<P>
For ever afterwards he was glad of that single look of reproach
which seemed to escape her unwittingly as her eyes met his.  But
she turned away and his heart was like a stone.
<P>
"You have deceived me, Mr. Trent.  I am very sorry, and very
disappointed."
<P>
"And you," he cried passionately, "are you yourself so blameless?
Were you altogether deceived by your relations, or had you never a
suspicion that your father might still be alive?  You had my message
through Mr. Cuthbert; I met you day by day after you knew that I
had been your father's partner, and never once did you give yourself
away!  Were you tarred with the same brush as those canting snobs
who doomed a poor old man to a living death?  Doesn't it look like
it?  What am I to think of you?"
<P>
"Your judgment, Mr. Trent," she answered quietly, "is of no
importance to me!  It does not interest me in any way.  But I will
tell you this.  If I did not disclose myself, it was because I
distrusted you.  I wanted to know the truth, and I set myself to
find it out."
<P>
"Your friendship was a lie, then!" he cried, with flashing eyes.
"To you I was nothing but a suspected man to be spied upon and
betrayed."
<P>
She faltered and did not answer him.  Outside the nurse was knocking
at the door.  Trent waved them away with an imperious gesture.
<P>
"Be off," he cried, "both of you!  You can do your worst!  I thank
Heaven that I am not of your class, whose men have flints for
hearts and whose women can lie like angels."
<P>
They left him alone, and Trent, with a groan, plucked from his heart
the one strong, sweet hope which had changed his life so wonderfully.
Upstairs, Monty was sobbing, with his little girl's arms about him.
