<p>Meanwhile Monteith Sterry was making the best of his opportunity.</p>

<p>It was no great exploit for him to slip out of the back door,
when he found his enemies gathering in front; but, had he not
been convinced that the movement was in the interests of his friends,
as well as himself, he would not have made it.</p>

<p>His flight was at a moderate pace for several hundred yards,
by which time he considered himself safe from pursuit and gave
his mare free rein. Her speed was rapid, but she was capable of
maintaining it for hours without fatigue.</p>

<p>Sterry's intention was to make his way to the ranch of his friend,
Dick Hawkridge, which lay to the westward. He began veering in
that direction, so that it may be said that while Inman and his
band were riding toward him, he was approaching them. Two causes,
however, prevented a meeting of the parties.</p>

<p>Sterry was much further out than the rustlers, and in the darkness
they could see nothing, if indeed they could hear anything of
each other. Then he had not ridden far when he was checked by
an unexpected sight.</p>

<p>A bright red glow appeared to the northward in the sky. It was
too vivid, distinct and near for him to mistake its nature. It
was a burning building, the flames showing so strongly that, aware
as he was of the deceptive nature of such a light, he knew it
was no more than a mile away. He turned the head of his mare in
that direction.</p>

<p>"Things seem to be stirring to-night," was his thought as he
galloped forward, with his gaze fixed on the burning structure.
"That may be an accident, but such accidents are not common in
this part of the world."</p>

<p>His supposition was that it was the work of the rustlers, but
he was mistaken.</p>

<p>The building was similar to that occupied by the Whitneys, though
somewhat smaller, and burned so fast that when he reached the
spot it was a mass of blazing embers, with hardly a semblance
of the original structure remaining.</p>

<p>The sight was interesting of itself, but the attention of Sterry
was riveted by the figure of a man lying motionless on the ground,
only a few paces in front of where the door had been. His nerveless
right hand still grasped the Winchester with which he had evidently
made a sturdy fight when stricken down.</p>

<p>Sterry did not dismount, but, sitting in the saddle, looked on
the sorrowful sight as revealed by the glow of the burning building.
He was saddened that such things should be.</p>

<p>Little time, however, was given him for gloomy reverie, when
Queenie sniffed the air and turned her head a little to one side.
Looking in that direction, the rider saw the figure of a horseman
assume shape in the glow as his animal advanced at a slow step.
He must have detected Sterry before the latter saw him, and was
studying him with close attention, his rifle supported across
his saddle in front, ready for instant use.</p>

<p>Reading his suspicion, the young man called out:</p>

<p>"Come on, partner! You and I cannot be enemies at such a time
as this."</p>

<p>The salutation reassured the other, who increased his pace.</p>

<p>Before he reached Sterry the latter half-regretted his action,
for he recognized the man as Duke Vesey, one of the most notorious
of rustlers and a bitter personal enemy. But a certain chivalry
rules among such people, and after the greeting of Sterry to Vesey
there was little danger of the latter taking unfair advantage
of it.</p>

<p>"This is bad business," remarked the younger, pointing to the
figure on the ground.</p>

<p>A hard look crossed the face of the rustler and his thin lips
compressed as he shook his head.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what's left of Jack Perkins; he was my pard."</p>

<p>"How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"How did it happen! A pretty question for you to ask. He was
killed by the stockmen less than an hour ago."</p>

<p>"But they didn't ride hither and shoot him down, I am sure."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you can be sure of," said Vesey, ominously.
"Jack and I were riding along peaceable like, when we heard horsemen
behind us. We didn't pay any attention to them till we got home
and Jack slipped off his horse. I concluded to stay in the saddle
until the fellows came up and I had a talk with them. They were
Capt. Asbury and his stockmen, and the first thing they called
out was an order for us to throw up our hands.</p>

<p>"Well," continued Vesey, grimly, "we aren't in that kind of business,
and the next thing the guns were popping all around us. Jack had
nerve. I wish the poor fellow had stayed in the saddle; but his
horse scooted off, and he stood right there where he fell, without
a leaf to shelter him, and pumped the lead into those stockmen,
who were mean enough to shoot the brave fellow in his tracks without
giving him a chance for life."</p>

<p>"You told me they ordered him to surrender before the firing
began."</p>

<p>"So they did, that they might shoot him down the easier. I had
a hot chase with them, and it was a pretty close call for me;
but they didn't keep up the hunt for long. You would think," added
Vesey, bitterly, "that they would have been satisfied with dropping
poor Jack, without burning down our home; but that is the style
of the stockmen."</p>

<p>Here was a representative of each of the factions, or associations,
so hostile to each other. The rustler knew Monteith Sterry, and
must have felt a consuming resentment toward him. His words and
manner indicated, too, that he was not averse to a quarrel. He
had fought the stockmen more than once, and, with the memory of
the recent collision and the advantages on the other side, he
welcomed the chance of a conflict on anything like equal terms.</p>

<p>Monteith did not stand in any personal fear of the famous rustler,
and was fully armed and on the alert. Without seeming to do so,
he kept a watch on the man, but he disliked the thought of a personal
encounter with him. The scene, the surroundings, and his own nature,
revolted, and he resolved to submit to all that it was possible
to bear before falling back on the last resort.</p>

<p>"No doubt," said Sterry, "there has been injustice on both sides,
and stockmen as well as rustlers have done things for which there
is no justification; I hope the trouble will soon end."</p>

<p>"It will end as soon as we get justice."</p>

<p>"Yes," Sterry could not help retorting, "for if justice were
done to you rustlers none would be left. However," he hastened
to add, "there is no reason why you and I should quarrel, Vesey;
I had no share in the death of your friend; and if the case is
as you represent it, he was more sinned against than sinning."</p>

<p>"Of course you had no share in that simply because you wasn't
here, but you have been concerned in other affairs like this where
some of the rustlers have gone down."</p>

<p>"It is quite possible I have," coolly replied Sterry, "inasmuch
as when a man is attacked it is his duty to defend himself. I
have not yet been convinced that I ought to stand up and allow
others to do as they please when weapons were in my hands."</p>

<p>"You have no business in Wyoming anyway," said Vesey, angrily;
"you have been sent here by the Association to do its underhand
work."</p>

<p>"Duke Vesey," said Sterry, "you are a man of too much education
to talk in that way. If you and I quarrel, it will be your fault,
but don't fancy that I hold you in any fear. Good-night."</p>
