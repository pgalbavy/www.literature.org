<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>G. Selden, awakening to consciousness two days later, lay and stared
at the chintz covering of the top of his four-post bed through a few
minutes of vacant amazement. It was a four-post bed he was lying on,
wasn't it? And his leg was bandaged and felt unmovable. The last thing
he remembered was going down an incline in a tree-bordered avenue. There
was nothing more. He had been all right then. Was this a four-post bed
or was it not? Yes, it was. And was it part of the furnishings of a
swell bedroom--the kind of bedroom he had never been in before? Tip top,
in fact? He stared and tried to recall things--but could not, and in his
bewilderment exclaimed aloud.
</p><p>“Well,” he said, “if this ain't the limit! You may search ME!”
</p><p>A respectable person in a white apron came to him from the other side of
the room. It was Buttle's wife, who had been hastily called in.
</p><p>“Sh--sh,” she said soothingly. “Don't you worry. Nobody ain't goin' to
search you. Nobody ain't. There! Sh, sh, sh,” rather as if he were a
baby. Beginning to be conscious of a curious sense of weakness, Selden
lay and stared at her in a helplessness which might have been considered
pathetic. Perhaps he had got “bats in his belfry,” and there was no use
in talking.
</p><p>At that moment, however, the door opened and a young lady entered.
She was “a looker,” G. Selden's weakness did not interfere with his
perceiving. “A looker, by gee!” She was dressed, as if for going out,
in softly tinted, exquisite things, and a large, strange hydrangea blue
flower under the brim of her hat rested on soft and full black hair. The
black hair gave him a clue. It was hair like that he had seen as Reuben
S. Vanderpoel's daughter rode by when he stood at the park gates at
Mount Dunstan. “Bats in his belfry,” of course.
</p><p>“How is he?” she said to the nurse.
</p><p>“He's been seeming comfortable all day, miss,” the woman answered, “but
he's light-headed yet. He opened his eyes quite sensible looking a bit
ago, but he spoke queer. He said something was the limit, and that we
might search him.”
</p><p>Betty approached the bedside to look at him, and meeting the disturbed
inquiry in his uplifted eyes, laughed, because, seeing that he was not
delirious, she thought she understood. She had not lived in New York
without hearing its argot, and she realised that the exclamation which
had appeared delirium to Mrs. Buttle had probably indicated that the
unexplainableness of the situation in which G. Selden found himself
struck him as reaching the limit of probability, and that the most
extended search of his person would fail to reveal any clue to
satisfactory explanation.
</p><p>She bent over him, with her laugh still shining in her eyes.
</p><p>“I hope you feel better. Can you tell me?” she said.
</p><p>His voice was not strong, but his answer was that of a young man who
knew what he was saying.
</p><p>“If I'm not off my head, ma'am, I'm quite comfortable, thank you,” he
replied.
</p><p>“I am glad to hear that,” said Betty. “Don't be disturbed. Your mind is
quite clear.”
</p><p>“All I want,” said G. Selden impartially, “is just to know where I'm at,
and how I blew in here. It would help me to rest better.”
</p><p>“You met with an accident,” the “looker” explained, still smiling with
both lips and eyes. “Your bicycle chain broke and you were thrown and
hurt yourself. It happened in the avenue in the park. We found you and
brought you in. You are at Stornham Court, which belongs to Sir Nigel
Anstruthers. Lady Anstruthers is my sister. I am Miss Vanderpoel.”
</p><p>“Hully gee!” ejaculated G. Selden inevitably. “Hully GEE!” The splendour
of the moment was such that his brain whirled. As it was not yet in the
physical condition to whirl with any comfort, he found himself closing
his eyes weakly.
</p><p>“That's right,” Miss Vanderpoel said. “Keep them closed. I must not
talk to you until you are stronger. Lie still and try not to think.
The doctor says you are getting on very well. I will come and see you
again.”
</p><p>As the soft sweep of her dress reached the door he managed to open his
eyes.
</p><p>“Thank you, Miss Vanderpoel,” he said. “Thank you, ma'am.” And as his
eyelids closed again he murmured in luxurious peace: “Well, if that's
her--she can have ME--and welcome!”
</p><hr/>
<p>She came to see him again each day--sometimes in a linen frock and
garden hat, sometimes in her soft tints and lace and flowers before or
after her drive in the afternoon, and two or three times in the evening,
with lovely shoulders and wonderfully trailing draperies--looking like
the women he had caught far-off glimpses of on the rare occasion of his
having indulged himself in the highest and most remotely placed seat in
the gallery at the opera, which inconvenience he had borne not through
any ardent desire to hear the music, but because he wanted to see
the show and get “a look-in” at the Four Hundred. He believed very
implicitly in his Four Hundred, and privately--though perhaps almost
unconsciously--cherished the distinction his share of them conferred
upon him, as fondly as the English young man of his rudimentary type
cherishes his dukes and duchesses. The English young man may revel in
his coroneted beauties in photograph shops, the young American dwells
fondly on flattering, or very unflattering, reproductions of his
multi-millionaires' wives and daughters in the voluminous illustrated
sheets of his Sunday paper, without which life would be a wretched and
savourless thing.
</p><p>Selden had never seen Miss Vanderpoel in his Sunday paper, and here he
was lying in a room in the same house with her. And she coming in to see
him and talk to him as if he was one of the Four Hundred himself! The
comfort and luxury with which he found himself surrounded sank into
insignificance when compared with such unearthly luck as this. Lady
Anstruthers came in to see him also, and she several times brought with
her a queer little lame fellow, who was spoken of as “Master Ughtred.”
 “Master” was supposed by G. Selden to be a sort of title conferred upon
the small sons of baronets and the like. The children he knew in New
York and elsewhere answered to the names of Bob, or Jimmy, or Bill. No
parallel to “Master” had been in vogue among them.
</p><p>Lady Anstruthers was not like her sister. She was a little thing, and
both she and Master Ughtred seemed fond of talking of New York. She had
not been home for years, and the youngster had never seen it at all.
He had some queer ideas about America, and seemed never to have seen
anything but Stornham and the village. G. Selden liked him, and was
vaguely sorry for a little chap to whom a description of the festivities
attendant upon the Fourth of July and a Presidential election seemed
like stories from the Arabian Nights.
</p><p>“Tell me about the Tammany Tiger, if you please,” he said once. “I want
to know what kind of an animal it is.”
</p><p>From a point of view somewhat different from that of Mount Dunstan and
Mr. Penzance, Betty Vanderpoel found talk with him interesting. To her
he did not wear the aspect of a foreign product. She had not met and
conversed with young men like him, but she knew of them. Stringent
precautions were taken to protect her father from their ingenuous
enterprises. They were not permitted to enter his offices; they were
even discouraged from hovering about their neighbourhood when seen and
suspected. The atmosphere, it was understood, was to be, if possible,
disinfected of agents. This one, lying softly in the four-post bed,
cheerfully grateful for the kindness shown him, and plainly filled with
delight in his adventure, despite the physical discomforts attending
it, gave her, as he began to recover, new views of the life he lived in
common with his kind. It was like reading scenes from a realistic novel
of New York life to listen to his frank, slangy conversation. To her,
as well as to Mr. Penzance, sidelights were thrown upon existence in the
“hall bedroom” and upon previously unknown phases of business life in
Broadway and roaring “downtown” streets.
</p><p>His determination, his sharp readiness, his control of temper under
rebuff and superfluous harshness, his odd, impersonal summing up of men
and things, and good-natured patience with the world in general, were,
she knew, business assets. She was even moved--no less--by the remote
connection of such a life with that of the first Reuben Vanderpoel who
had laid the huge, solid foundations of their modern fortune. The first
Reuben Vanderpoel must have seen and known the faces of men as G.
Selden saw and knew them. Fighting his way step by step, knocking
pertinaciously at every gateway which might give ingress to some passage
leading to even the smallest gain, meeting with rebuff and indifference
only to be overcome by steady and continued assault--if G. Selden was a
nuisance, the first Vanderpoel had without doubt worn that aspect upon
innumerable occasions. No one desires the presence of the man who while
having nothing to give must persist in keeping himself in evidence, even
if by strategy or force. From stories she was familiar with, she had
gathered that the first Reuben Vanderpoel had certainly lacked a certain
youth of soul she felt in this modern struggler for life. He had been
the cleverer man of the two; G. Selden she secretly liked the better.
</p><p>The curiosity of Mrs. Buttle, who was the nurse, had been awakened by a
singular feature of her patient's feverish wanderings.
</p><p>“He keeps muttering, miss, things I can't make out about Lord Mount
Dunstan, and Mr. Penzance, and some child he calls Little Willie. He
talks to them the same as if he knew them--same as if he was with them
and they were talking to him quite friendly.”
</p><p>One morning Betty, coming to make her visit of inquiry found the patient
looking thoughtful, and when she commented upon his air of pondering,
his reply cast light upon the mystery.
</p><p>“Well, Miss Vanderpoel,” he explained, “I was lying here thinking of
Lord Mount Dunstan and Mr. Penzance, and how well they treated me--I
haven't told you about that, have I?
</p><p>“That explains what Mrs. Buttle said,” she answered. “When you were
delirious you talked frequently to Lord Mount Dunstan and Mr. Penzance.
We both wondered why.”
</p><p>Then he told her the whole story. Beginning with his sitting on the
grassy bank outside the park, listening to the song of the robin,
he ended with the adieux at the entrance gates when the sound of her
horse's trotting hoofs had been heard by each of them.
</p><p>“What I've been lying here thinking of,” he said, “is how queer it was
it happened just that way. If I hadn't stopped just that minute, and if
you hadn't gone by, and if Lord Mount Dunstan hadn't known you and said
who you were, Little Willie would have been in London by this time,
hustling to get a cheap bunk back to New York in.”
</p><p>“Because?” inquired Miss Vanderpoel.
</p><p>G. Selden laughed and hesitated a moment. Then he made a clean breast of
it.
</p><p>“Say, Miss Vanderpoel,” he said, “I hope it won't make you mad if I
own up. Ladies like you don't know anything about chaps like me. On the
square and straight out, when I seen you and heard your name I couldn't
help remembering whose daughter you was. Reuben S. Vanderpoel spells a
big thing. Why, when I was in New York we fellows used to get together
and talk about what it'd mean to the chap who could get next to Reuben
S. Vanderpoel. We used to count up all the business he does, and all the
clerks he's got under him pounding away on typewriters, and how they'd
be bound to get worn out and need new ones. And we'd make calculations
how many a man could unload, if he could get next. It was a kind of
typewriting junior assistant fairy story, and we knew it couldn't happen
really. But we used to chin about it just for the fun of the thing.
One of the boys made up a thing about one of us saving Reuben S.'s
life--dragging him from under a runaway auto and, when he says, 'What
can I do to show my gratitude, young man?' him handing out his catalogue
and saying, 'I should like to call your attention to the Delkoff, sir,'
and getting him to promise he'd never use any other, as long as he
lived!”
</p><p>Reuben S. Vanderpoel's daughter laughed as spontaneously as any girl
might have done. G. Selden laughed with her. At any rate, she hadn't got
mad, so far.
</p><p>“That was what did it,” he went on. “When I rode away on my bike I got
thinking about it and could not get it out of my head. The next day I
just stopped on the road and got off my wheel, and I says to myself:
'Look here, business is business, if you ARE travelling in Europe and
lunching at Buckingham Palace with the main squeeze. Get busy! What'll
the boys say if they hear you've missed a chance like this? YOU hit the
pike for Stornham Castle, or whatever it's called, and take your nerve
with you! She can't do more than have you fired out, and you've been
fired before and got your breath after it. So I turned round and made
time. And that was how I happened on your avenue. And perhaps it was
because I was feeling a bit rattled I lost my hold when the chain broke,
and pitched over on my head. There, I've got it off my chest. I was
thinking I should have to explain somehow.”
</p><p>Something akin to her feeling of affection for the nice, long-legged
Westerner she had seen rambling in Bond Street touched Betty again.
The Delkoff was the centre of G. Selden's world as the flowers were of
Kedgers', as the “little 'ome” was of Mrs. Welden's.
</p><p>“Were you going to try to sell ME a typewriter?” she asked.
</p><p>“Well,” G. Selden admitted, “I didn't know but what there might be use
for one, writing business letters on a big place like this. Straight, I
won't say I wasn't going to try pretty hard. It may look like gall, but
you see a fellow has to rush things or he'll never get there. A chap
like me HAS to get there, somehow.”
</p><p>She was silent a few moments and looked as if she was thinking something
over. Her silence and this look on her face actually caused to dawn in
the breast of Selden a gleam of daring hope. He looked round at her with
a faint rising of colour.
</p><p>“Say, Miss Vanderpoel--say----” he began, and then broke off.
</p><p>“Yes?” said Betty, still thinking.
</p><p>“C-COULD you use one--anywhere?” he said. “I don't want to rush things
too much, but--COULD you?”
</p><p>“Is it easy to learn to use it?”
</p><p>“Easy!” his head lifted from his pillow. “It's as easy as falling off
a log. A baby in a perambulator could learn to tick off orders for its
bottle. And--on the square--there isn't its equal on the market, Miss
Vanderpoel--there isn't.” He fumbled beneath his pillow and actually
brought forth his catalogue.
</p><p>“I asked the nurse to put it there. I wanted to study it now and then
and think up arguments. See--adjustable to hold with perfect ease an
envelope, an index card, or a strip of paper no wider than a postage
stamp. Unsurpassed paper feed, practical ribbon mechanism--perfect and
permanent alignment.”
</p><p>As Mount Dunstan had taken the book, Betty Vanderpoel took it. Never had
G. Selden beheld such smiling in eyes about to bend upon his catalogue.
</p><p>“You will raise your temperature,” she said, “if you excite yourself.
You mustn't do that. I believe there are two or three people on the
estate who might be taught to use a typewriter. I will buy three.
Yes--we will say three.”
</p><p>She would buy three. He soared to heights. He did not know how to thank
her, though he did his best. Dizzying visions of what he would have to
tell “the boys” when he returned to New York flashed across his mind.
The daughter of Reuben S. Vanderpoel had bought three Delkoffs, and he
was the junior assistant who had sold them to her.
</p><p>“You don't know what it means to me, Miss Vanderpoel,” he said, “but if
you were a junior salesman you'd know. It's not only the sale--though
that's a rake-off of fifteen dollars to me--but it's because it's YOU
that's bought them. Gee!” gazing at her with a frank awe whose obvious
sincerity held a queer touch of pathos. “What it must be to be YOU--just
<strong>YOU!”</strong>
</p><p>She did not laugh. She felt as if a hand had lightly touched her on
her naked heart. She had thought of it so often--had been bewildered
restlessly by it as a mere child--this difference in human lot--this
chance. Was it chance which had placed her entity in the centre of
Bettina Vanderpoel's world instead of in that of some little cash girl
with hair raked back from a sallow face, who stared at her as she passed
in a shop--or in that of the young Frenchwoman whose life was spent
in serving her, in caring for delicate dresses and keeping guard over
ornaments whose price would have given to her own humbleness ease for
the rest of existence? What did it mean? And what Law was laid upon her?
What Law which could only work through her and such as she who had
been born with almost unearthly power laid in their hands--the reins
of monstrous wealth, which guided or drove the world? Sometimes fear
touched her, as with this light touch an her heart, because she did not
KNOW the Law and could only pray that her guessing at it might be right.
And, even as she thought these things, G. Selden went on.
</p><p>“You never can know,” he said, “because you've always been in it. And
the rest of the world can't know, because they've never been anywhere
near it.” He stopped and evidently fell to thinking.
</p><p>“Tell me about the rest of the world,” said Betty quietly.
</p><p>He laughed again.
</p><p>“Why, I was just thinking to myself you didn't know a thing about it.
And it's queer. It's the rest of us that mounts up when you come to
numbers. I guess it'd run into millions. I'm not thinking of beggars and
starving people, I've been rushing the Delkoff too steady to get onto
any swell charity organisation, so I don't know about them. I'm just
thinking of the millions of fellows, and women, too, for the matter of
that, that waken up every morning and know they've got to hustle for
their ten per or their fifteen per--if they can stir it up as thick as
that. If it's as much as fifty per, of course, seems like to me, they're
on Easy Street. But sometimes those that's got to fifty per--or even
more--have got more things to do with it--kids, you know, and more rent
and clothes. They've got to get at it just as hard as we have. Why, Miss
Vanderpoel, how many people do you suppose there are in a million that
don't have to worry over their next month's grocery bills, and the rent
of their flat? I bet there's not ten--and I don't know the ten.”
</p><p>He did not state his case uncheerfully. “The rest of the world”
 represented to him the normal condition of things.
</p><p>“Most married men's a bit afraid to look an honest grocery bill in the
face. And they WILL come in--as regular as spring hats. And I tell YOU,
when a man's got to live on seventy-five a month, a thing that'll take
all the strength and energy out of a twenty-dollar bill sorter gets him
down on the mat.”
</p><p>Like old Mrs. Welden's, his roughly sketched picture was a graphic one.
</p><p>“'Tain't the working that bothers most of us. We were born to that, and
most of us would feel like deadbeats if we were doing nothing. It's the
earning less than you can live on, and getting a sort of tired feeling
over it. It's the having to make a dollar-bill look like two, and
watching every other fellow try to do the same thing, and not often make
the trip. There's millions of us--just millions--every one of us
with his Delkoff to sell----” his figure of speech pleased him and he
chuckled at his own cleverness--“and thinking of it, and talking about
it, and--under his vest--half afraid that he can't make it. And what
you say in the morning when you open your eyes and stretch yourself is,
'Hully gee! I've GOT to sell a Delkoff to-day, and suppose I shouldn't,
and couldn't hold down my job!' I began it over my feeding bottle. So
did all the people I know. That's what gave me a sort of a jolt just
now when I looked at you and thought about you being YOU--and what it
meant.”
</p><p>When their conversation ended she had a much more intimate knowledge
of New York than she had ever had before, and she felt it a rich
possession. She had heard of the “hall bedroom” previously, and she
had seen from the outside the “quick lunch” counter, but G. Selden
unconsciously escorted her inside and threw upon faces and lives the
glare of a flashlight.
</p><p>“There was a thing I've been thinking I'd ask you, Miss Vanderpoel,” he
said just before she left him. “I'd like you to tell me, if you please.
It's like this. You see those two fellows treated me as fine as silk. I
mean Lord Mount Dunstan and Mr. Penzance. I never expected it. I never
saw a lord before, much less spoke to one, but I can tell you that
one's just about all right--Mount Dunstan. And the other one--the old
vicar--I've never taken to anyone since I was born like I took to him.
The way he puts on his eye-glasses and looks at you, sorter kind and
curious about you at the same time! And his voice and his way of saying
his words--well, they just GOT me--sure. And they both of 'em did say
they'd like to see me again. Now do you think, Miss Vanderpoel, it would
look too fresh--if I was to write a polite note and ask if either of
them could make it convenient to come and take a look at me, if it
wouldn't be too much trouble. I don't WANT to be too fresh--and perhaps
they wouldn't come anyhow--and if it is, please won't you tell me, Miss
Vanderpoel?”
</p><p>Betty thought of Mount Dunstan as he had stood and talked to her in
the deepening afternoon sun. She did not know much of him, but she
thought--having heard G. Selden's story of the lunch--that he would
come. She had never seen Mr. Penzance, but she knew she should like to
see him.
</p><p>“I think you might write the note,” she said. “I believe they would come
to see you.”
</p><p>“Do you?” with eager pleasure. “Then I'll do it. I'd give a good deal to
see them again. I tell you, they are just It--both of them.”
