<p>As soon as Théophraste had pronounced these words, M. Eliphaste
made a sweeping gesture with his right arm. He leaned over the
prostrate form, and blew impatiently on his eye.</p>

<p>He said to him: "Awake thou, Théophraste Longuet!"</p>

<p>This was repeated three times, each time with greater earnestness.
However, Théophraste never moved. His immobility was deathlike,
and his toothless mouth and bloodless lips made the silent onlookers
believe that he had followed Cartouche in the shadow of death.
His corpselike pallor seemed to them to be already turning green,
and his hair, having become suddenly white, gave him the appearance
of a very old man. Was he already dead? Was he decomposing already?</p>

<p>M. Eliphaste repeated the gestures, and in his lids, intense
earnestness appeared like a madman. He blew again on the eyes,
and parted the eyelashes, again crying out: "Théophraste Longuet,
awake thou! Awake thou, Théophraste Longuet!"</p>

<p>Just at the moment when they believed that Théophraste Longuet
would never return to life again, a slight tremble shook his frame,
and drawing a deep breath, he turned his face toward them. At
first he breathed with difficulty, but quickly recovering, he
opened his eyes and said: "Cartouche is dead!"</p>

<p>M. Eliphaste’s face lit up with emotion. "Let us thank God,"
he said, "that the operation has been successful," and he began
his prayer again: "In the beginning thou wast silent! Eon! Source
of all ages!..."</p>

<p>Mme. Longuet and M. Adolphe threw themselves on Théophraste,
while thanking God from the bottom of their hearts. They felt
that the death of Cartouche had not been too dearly bought. The
operation had certainly been a rough one, but he had only lost
his teeth, and his hair had turned white. Mme. Longuet put her
arms around her husband, and helped him rise from the couch. "Let
us go. We have stopped here too long already," she said.</p>

<p>"Speak louder," said Théophraste, with strange enunciation. "I
have something in my ears. I cannot move, either."</p>

<p>"It is natural that you should be a little benumbed, my dear,"
said Mme. Longuet. "You have been stretched on that bed for a
long time. But make an effort."</p>

<p>"Speak louder, I tell you. I can move my arms now, but I cannot
stir my legs. They won’t move, and my feet pain me very much."</p>

<p>He then put his hand to his mouth and said: "Why, what have you
done with my teeth? You put me to sleep to fix my teeth, and you
have taken them from me."</p>

<p>It was curious that while he was asleep, even after he had lost
his teeth, he spoke distinctly. It was evident that he could not
move, and Mme. Longuet removed the clothing to rub his stiff limbs.
To her sorrow she found his clothes all torn, and on looking closer
saw all the flesh on his limbs lacerated. His legs and feet were
boiled. The flesh was torn away in some places, and burned horribly
in others. M. Eliphaste, with trembling hands, removed the clothing
from his chest, and there they saw, over the heart, two spots
of black blood. His biceps bore fresh marks of frightful torture.</p>

<p>Mme. Longuet sobbed loudly, and sat with lowered head, looking
at the horrible sight. Adolphe ran to get a carriage. It was evident
that Théophraste could not walk or move. On his return, Théophraste
was still complaining of the pain. Adolphe, with the assistance
of the carriage driver, carried him out into the street. They
lifted him carefully on the mattress, and walked slowly out, followed
by the weeping Marceline.</p>

<p>M. Eliphaste prostrated himself on the ground, and with his hands
clasped and elbows on the floor, cried out with a voice full of
sorrow: "My beloved! My well beloved! I believed that I was Your
son. Oh, my well beloved! I have taken Thy shadow for Thy light.
Thou hast crushed my pride. I am in the dark, at the bottom of
an abyss—I, the man of light—and I have hated it. I am only the
son of silence. Eon! Source of Eon! Oh, life! To know life! To
possess life!"</p>

<p>And thus, as they went out into the pure air, they left him praying.</p>
