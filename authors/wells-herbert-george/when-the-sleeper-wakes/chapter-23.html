For a time the Master of the Earth was not even
master of his own mind. Even his will seemed a will
not his own, his own acts surprised him and were but
a part of the confusion of strange experiences that
poured across his being. These things were definite,
the aeroplanes were coming, Helen Wotton had 
warned the people of their coming, and he was Master
of the Earth. Each of these facts seemed struggling
for complete possession of his thoughts. They 
protruded from a background of swarming halls, elevated
passages, rooms jammed with ward leaders in council
kinematograph and telephone rooms, and windows
looking out on a seething sea of marching men. The
man in yellow, and men whom he fancied were called
Ward Leaders, were either propelling him forward
or following him obediently; it was hard to tell. 
Perhaps they were doing a little of both. Perhaps some
power unseen and unsuspected, propelled them all.
He was aware that he was going to make a proclamation 
to the People of the Earth, aware of certain
grandiose phrases floating in his mind as the thing
he meant to say. Many little things happened, and
then he found himself with the man in yellow entering
a little room where this proclamation of his was to be
made.
<P>
This room was grotesquely latter-day in its appointments. 
In the centre was a bright oval lit by shaded
electric lights from above. The rest was in shadow,
and the double finely fitting doors through which he
came from the swarming Hall of the Atlas made the
place very still. The dead thud of these as they closed
behind him, the sudden cessation of the tumult in
which he had been living for hours, the quivering circle 
of light, the whispers and quick noiseless movements 
of vaguely visible attendants in the shadows, had
a strange effect upon Graham. The huge ears of a 
phonographic mechanism gaped in a battery for his words,
the black eyes of great photographic cameras awaited
his beginning, beyond metal rods and coils glittered
dimly, and something whirled about with a droning
hum. He walked into the centre of the light, and his
shadow drew together black and sharp to a little blot
at his feet.
<P>
The vague shape of the thing he meant to say was
already in his mind. But this silence, this isolation,
the sudden withdrawal from that contagious crowd,
this silent audience of gaping, glaring machines had
not been in his anticipation. All his supports seemed
withdrawn together; he seemed to have dropped into
this suddenly, suddenly to have discovered himself. In
a moment he was changed. He found that he now
feared to be inadequate, he feared to be theatrical, he
feared the quality of his voice, the quality of his wit,
astonished, he turned to the man in yellow with a 
propitiatory gesture. "For a moment," he said, "I must
wait. I did not think it would be like this. I must
think of the thing I have to say.
<P>
While he was still hesitating there came an agitated
messenger with news that the foremost aeroplanes were
passing over Arawan.
<P>
"Arawan?" he said." Where is that? But anyhow,
they are coming. They will be here. When?"  
<P>
"By twilight."
<P>
"Great God! In only a few hours. What news of
the flying stages?" he asked.
<P>
"The people of the south-west wards are ready."
<P>
"Ready! "
<P>
He turned impatiently to the blank circles of the
lenses again.
<P>
"I suppose it must be a sort of speech. Would to
God I knew certainly the thing that should be said!
Aeroplanes at Arawan! They must have started
before the main fleet. And the people only ready!
Surely . . ."
<P>
"Oh! what does it matter whether I speak well or
ill?" he said, and felt the light grow brighter.
<P>
He had framed some vague sentence of democratic
sentiment when suddenly doubts overwhelmed him.
His belief in his heroic quality and calling he found had
altogether lost its assured conviction. The picture of
a little strutting futility in a windy waste of 
incomprehensible destinies replaced it. Abruptly it was 
perfectly clear to him that this revolt against Ostrog was
premature, foredoomed to failure, the impulse of 
passionate inadequacy against inevitable things. He
thought of that swift flight of aeroplanes like the swoop
of Fate towards him. He was astonished that he could
have seen things in any other light. In that final
emergency he debated, thrust debate resolutely aside,
determined at all costs to go through with the thing
he had undertaken. And he could find no word to
begin. Even as he stood, awkward, hesitating, with
an indiscrete apology for his inability trembling on his
lips, came the noise of many people crying out, the
running to and fro of feet. "Wait," cried someone,
and a door opened. "She is coming," said the voices.
Graham turned, and the watching lights waned.
<P>
Through the open doorway he saw a slight grey
figure advancing across a spacious hall. His heart
leapt. It was Helen Wotton. Behind and about her
marched a riot of applause. The man in yellow came
out of the nearer shadows into the circle of light.
<P>
"This is the girl who told us what Ostrog had
dune," he said.
<P>
Her face was aflame, and the heavy coils of her
black hair fell about her shoulders. The folds of the
soft silk robe she wore streamed from her and floated
in the rhythm of her advance. She drew nearer and
nearer, and his heart was beating fast. All his doubts
were gone. The shadow of the doorway fell athwart
her face and she was near him. "You have not
betrayed us? " she cried. "You are with us? "
<P>
"Where have you been? " said Graham.
<P>
"At the office of the south-west wards. Until ten
minutes since I did not know you had returned. I
went to the office of the south-west wards to find the
Ward Leaders in order that they might tell the people."
<P>
"I came back so soon as I heard--."
<P>
"I knew," she cried, " knew you would be with us.
And it was I--it was I that told them. They have
risen. All the world is rising. The people have
awakened. Thank God that I did not act in vain!
You are Master still."
<P>
"You told them " he said slowly, and he saw that in
spite of her steady eyes her lips trembled and her
throat rose and fell.
<P>
"I told them. I knew of the order. I was here.
I heard that the negroes were to come to London to
guard you and to keep the people down--to keep
you a prisoner. And I stopped it. I came out and
told the people. And you are Master still."
<P>
Graham glanced at the black lenses of the cameras,
the vast listening ears, and back to her face. "I am
Master still," he said slowly, and the swift rush of a
fleet of aeroplanes passed across his thoughts.
<P>
"And you did this? You, who are the niece of
Ostrog."
<P>
"For you," she cried. "For you! That you for
whom the world has waited should not be cheated of
your power."
<P>
Graham stood for a space, wordless, regarding her.
His doubts and questionings had fled before her 
presence. He remembered the things that he had meant
to say. He faced the cameras again and the light
about him grew brighter. He turned again towards
her.
<P>
"You have saved me," he said; "you have saved
my power. And the battle is beginning. God knows.
what this night will see--but not dishonour."
<P>
He paused. He addressed himself to the unseen
multitudes who stared upon him through those 
grotesque black eyes. At first he spoke slowly.
"Men and women of the new age," he said; "You
have arisen to do battle for the race. . . There
is no easy victory before us."
<P>
He stopped to gather words. The thoughts that
had been in his mind before she came returned, but
transfigured, no longer touched with the shadow of a
possible irrelevance. "This night is a beginning," he
cried. "This battle that is coming, this battle that
rushes upon us to-night, is only a beginning. All your
lives, it may be, you must fight. Take no thought
though I am beaten, though I am utterly overthrown."
<P>
He found the thing in his mind too vague for words.
He paused momentarily, and broke into vague 
exhortations, and then a rush of speech came upon him.
Much that he said was but the humanitarian commonplace 
of a vanished age, but the conviction of his voice
touched it to vitality. He stated the case of the old
days to the people of the new age, to the woman at
his side. "I come out of the past to you," he said,
"with the memory of an age that hoped. My age was
an age of dreams--of beginnings, an age of noble
hopes; throughout the world we had made an end of
slavery; throughout the world we had spread the desire
and anticipation that wars might cease, that all men
and women might live nobly, in freedom and peace.
. . . So we hoped in the days that are past. And
what of those hopes? How is it with man after two
hundred years?
<P>
"Great cities, vast powers, a collective greatness
beyond our dreams. For that we did not work, and
that has come. But how is it with the little lives that
make up this greater life? How is it with the common
lives? As it has ever been--sorrow and labour, lives
cramped and unfulfilled, lives tempted by power,
tempted by wealth, and gone to waste and folly. The
old faiths have faded and changed, the new faith--.
Is there a new faith? "
<P>
Things that he had long wished to believe, he found
that he believed. He plunged at belief and seized it,
and clung for a time at her level. He spoke gustily,
in broken incomplete sentences, but with all his heart
and strength, of this new faith within him. He spoke
of the greatness of self-abnegation, of his belief in an
immortal life of Humanity in which we live and move
and have our being. His voice rose and fell, and the
recording appliances hummed their hurried applause,
dim attendants watched him out of the shadow.
Through all those doubtful places his sense of that
silent spectator beside him sustained his sincerity.
For a few glorious moments he was carried away; he
felt no doubt of his heroic quality, no doubt of his
heroic words, he had it all straight and plain. His
eloquence limped no longer. And at last he made an
end to speaking. "Here and now," he cried, "I make
my will. All that is mine in the world I give to the
people of the world. All that is mine in the world I
give to the people of the world. I give it to you, and
myself I give to you. And as God wills, I will live for
you, or I will die."
<P>
He ended with a florid gesture and turned about.
He found the light of his present exaltation reflected
in the face of the girl. Their eyes met; her eyes were
swimming with tears of enthusiasm. They seemed to
be urged towards each other. They clasped hands
and stood gripped, facing one another, in an eloquent
silence. She whispered. "I knew," she whispered.
"I knew." He could not speak, he crushed her hand
in his. His mind was the theatre of gigantic passions.
<P>
The man in yellow was beside them. Neither had
noted his coming. He was saying that the south-west
wards were marching. "I never expected it so soon,"
he cried. "They have done wonders. You must send
them a word to help them on their way."
<P>
Graham dropped Helen's hand and stared at him
absent-mindedly. Then with a start he returned to
his previous preoccupation about the flying stages.
<P>
"Yes," he said. "That is good, that is good." He
weighed a message. "Tell them;--well done South
West."
<P>
He turned his eyes to Helen Wotton again. His
face expressed his struggle between conflicting ideas.
"We must capture the flying stages," he explained.
"Unless we can do that they will land negroes. At all
costs we must prevent that."
<P>
He felt even as he spoke that this was not what had
been in his mind before the interruption. He saw a
touch of surprise in her eyes. She seemed about to
speak and a shrill bell drowned her voice.
<P>
It occurred to Graham that she expected him to lead
these marching people, that that was the thing he had
to do. He made the offer abruptly. He addressed
the man in yellow, but he spoke to her. He saw her
face respond. "Here I am doing nothing," he said.
<P>
"It is impossible," protested the man in yellow.
<P>
"It is a fight in a warren. Your place is here."
<P>
He explained elaborately. He motioned towards
the room where Graham must wait, he insisted no other
course was possible. "We must know where you
are," he said. "At any moment a crisis may arise 
needing your presence and decision. "The room was 
a luxurious little apartment with news machines and
a broken mirror that had once been en __rapport__ with the
crow's nest specula. It seemed a matter of course to
Graham that Helen should stop with him.
<P>
A picture had drifted through his mind of such a
vast dramatic struggle as the masses in the ruins had
suggested. But here was no spectacular battle-field
such as he imagined. Instead was seclusion--and suspense. 
It was only as the afternoon wore on that
he pieced together a truer picture of the fight that
was raging, inaudibly and invisibly, within four
miles of him, beneath the Roehampton stage. A
strange and unprecedented contest it was, a battle
that was a hundred thousand little battles, a battle
in a sponge of ways and channels, fought out
of sight of sky or sun under the electric glare,
fought out in a vast confusion by multitudes untrained 
in arms, led chiefly by acclamation, multitudes 
dulled by mindless labour and enervated by the
tradition of two hundred years of servile security
against multitudes demolised by lives of venial privilege 
and sensual indulgence. They had no artillery,
no differentiation into this force or that; the only
weapon on either side was the little green metal 
carbine, whose secret manufacture and sudden 
distribution in enormous quantities had been one of Ostrog's
culminating moves against the Council. Few had had
any experience with this weapon, many had never
discharged one, many who carried it came unprovided
with ammunition; never was wilder firing in the 
history of warfare. It was a battle of amateurs, a 
hideous experimental warfare, armed rioters fighting
armed rioters, armed rioters swept forward by the
words and fury of a song, by the tramping sympathy
of their numbers, pouring in countless myriads
towards the smaller ways, the disabled lifts, the 
galleries slippery with blood, the halls and passages
choked with smoke, beneath the flying stages, to learn
there when retreat was hopeless the ancient mysteries
of warfare. And overhead save for a few sharpshooters 
upon the roof spaces and for a few bands and
threads of vapour that multiplied and darkened towards
the evening, the day was a clear serenity. Ostrog it
seems had no bombs at command and in all the earlier
phases of the battle the aeropiles played no part. Not
the smallest cloud was there to break the empty 
brilliance of the sky. It seemed as though it held itself
vacant until the aeroplanes should come.
<P>
Ever and again there was news of these, drawing
nearer, from this Mediterranean port and then that,
and presently from the south of France. But of the
new guns that Ostrog had made and which were known
to be in the city came no news in spite of Graham's
urgency, nor any report of successes from the dense
felt of fighting strands about the flying stages. 
Section after section of the Labour Societies reported itself
assembled, reported itself marching, and vanished from
knowledge into the labyrinth of that warfare What
was happening there? Even the busy ward leaders did
not know. In spite of the opening and closing of
doors, the hasty messengers, the ringing of bells and
the perpetual clitter-clack of recording implements,
Graham felt isolated, strangely inactive, inoperative.
<P>
Their isolation seemed at times the strangest, the
most unexpected of all the things that had happened
since his awakening. It had something of the quality
of that inactivity that comes in dreams. A tumult, the
stupendous realisation of a world struggle between
Ostrog and himself, and then this confined quiet little
room with its mouthpieces and bells and broken
mirror!
<P>
Now the door would be closed and they were alone
together; they seemed sharply marked off then from all
the unprecedented world storm that rushed together
without, vividly aware of one another, only concerned
with one another. Then the door would open again,
messengers would enter, or a sharp bell would stab
their quiet privacy, and it was like a window in a well
built brightly lit house flung open suddenly to a hurricane. 
The dark hurry and tumult, the stress and
vehemence of the battle rushed in and overwhelmed
them. They were no longer persons but mere spectators, 
mere impressions of a tremendous convulsion.
They became unreal even to themselves, miniatures of
personality, indescribably small, and the two antagonistic 
realities, the only realities in being were first the
city, that throbbed and roared yonder in a belated
frenzy of defence and secondly the aeroplanes hurling
inexorably towards them over the round shoulder of
the world.
<P>
At first their mood had been one of exalted confidence, 
a great pride had possessed them, a pride in
one another for the greatness of the issues they had
challenged. At first he had walked the room eloquent
with a transitory persuasion of his tremendous destiny. 
But slowly uneasy intimations of their coming
defeat touched his spirit. There came a long period in
which they were alone. He changed his theme,
became egotistical, spoke of the wonder of his sleep, of
the little life of his memories, remote yet minute and
clear, like something seen through an inverted opera-
glass, and all the brief play of desires and errors that
had made his former life. She said little, but the emotion 
in her face followed the tones in his voice, and it
seemed to him he had at last a perfect understanding.
He reverted from pure reminiscence to that sense of
greatness she imposed upon him. "And through it
all, this destiny was before me," he said; "this vast
inheritance of which I did not dream."
<P>
Insensibly their heroic preoccupation with the 
revlutionary struggle passed to the question of their 
relationship. He began to question her. She told him of
the days before his awakening, spoke with a brief
vividness of the girlish dreams that had given a bias
to her life, of the incredulous emotions his awakening
had aroused. She told him too of a tragic circumstance 
of her girlhood that had darkened her life,
quickened her sense of injustice and opened her heart
prematurely to the wider sorrows of the world. For a
little time, so far as he was concerned, the great war
about them was but the vast ennobling background
to these personal things.
<P>
In an instant these personal relations were submerged. 
There came messengers to tell that a great
fleet of aeroplanes was rushing between the sky and
Avignon. He went to the crystal dial in the corner
and assured himself that the thing was so. He went
to the chart room and consulted a map to measure the
distances of Avignon, New Arawan, and London. He
made swift calculations. He went to the room of the
Ward Leaders to ask for news of the fight for the
stages--and there was no one there. After a time he
came back to her.
<P>
His face had changed. It had dawned upon him
that the struggle was perhaps more than half over,
that Ostrog was holding his own, that the arrival of
the aeroplanes would mean a panic that might leave
him helpless. A chance phrase in the message had
given him a glimpse of the reality that came. Each of
these soaring giants bore its thousand half savage
negroes to the death grapple of the city. Suddenly
his humanitarian enthusiasm showed flimsy. Only
two of the Ward Leaders were in their room, when
presently he repaired thither, the Hall of the Atlas
seemed empty. He fancied a change in the bearing
of the attendants in the outer rooms. A sombre 
disillusionment darkened his mind. She looked at him
anxiously when he returned to her.
<P>
"No news," he said with an assumed carelessness
in answer to her eyes.
<P>
Then he was moved to frankness. "Or rather--
bad news. We are losing. We are gaining no ground
and the aeroplanes draw nearer and nearer."
<P>
He walked the length of the room and turned.
<P>
"Unless we can capture those flying stages in the
next hour--there will be horrible things. We shall
be beaten.
<P>
"No!" she said. "We have justice--we have the
people. We have God on our side."
<P>
"Ostrog has discipline--he has plans. Do you
know, out there just now I felt--. When I heard that
these aeroplanes were a stage nearer. I felt as if I
were fighting the machinery of fate."
<P>
She made no answer for a while. "We have done
right," she said at last.
<P>
He looked at her doubtfully. "We have done what
we could. But does this depend upon us? Is it not
an older sin, a wider sin?"
<P>
"What do you mean? " she asked.
<P>
"These blacks are savages, ruled by force, used as
force. And they have been under the rule of the
whites two hundred years. Is it not a race quarrel?
The race sinned--the race pays."
<P>
"But these labourers, these poor people of
London--! "
<P>
"Vicarious atonement. To stand wrong is to share
the guilt."
<P>
She looked keenly at him, astonished at the new
aspect he presented.
<P>
Without came the shrill ringing of a bell, the sound
of feet and the gabble of a phonographic message.
The man in yellow appeared. "Yes?" said Graham.
<P>
"They are at Vichy."
<P>
"Where are the attendants who were in the great
Hall of the Atlas? " asked Graham abruptly.
<P>
Presently the Babble Machine rang again. "We
may win yet," said the man in yellow, going out to it.
"If only we can find where Ostrog has hidden his
guns. Everything hangs on that now. Perhaps
this--"
<P>
Graham followed him. But the only news was of
the aeroplanes. They had reached Orleans.
<P>
Graham returned to Helen. "No news," he said
"No news."
<P>
"And we can do nothing?"
<P>
" Nothing."
<P>
He paced impatiently. Suddenly the swift anger
that was his nature swept upon him. "Curse this
complex world!" he cried, "and all the inventions of
men! That a man must die like a rat in a snare and
never see his foe! Oh, for one blow! . . ."
<P>
He turned with an abrupt change in his manner.
"That's nonsense," he said. "I am a savage."
<P>
He paced and stopped. "After all London and
Paris are only two cities. All the temperate zone has
risen. What if London is doomed and Paris
destroyed? These are but accidents. "Again came
the mockery of news to call him to fresh enquiries. He
returned with a graver face and sat down beside her.
<P>
"The end must be near," he said. "The people it
seems have fought and died in tens of thousands, the
ways about Roehampton must be like a smoked beehive. 
And they have died in vain. They are still only
at the sub stage. The aeroplanes are near Paris.
Even were a gleam of success to come now, there
would be nothing to do, there would be no time to do
anything before they were upon us. The guns that
might have saved us are mislaid. Mislaid! Think of
the disorder of things! Think of this foolish tumult,
that cannot even find its weapons! Oh, for one
aeropile--just one! For the want of that I am beaten.
Humanity is beaten and our cause is lost! My 
kingship, my headlong foolish kingship will not last a
night. And I have egged on the people to fight--."
<P>
"They would have fought anyhow."
<P>
"I doubt it. I have come among them--"
<P>
"No," she cried," not that. If defeat comes--if
you die--. But even that cannot be, it cannot be,
after all these years."
<P>
"Ah! We have meant well. But--do you indeed
believe--?"
<P>
"If they defeat you," she cried, "you have spoken.
Your word has gone like a great wind through the
world, fanning liberty into a flame. What if the flame
sputters a little! Nothing can change the spoken
word. Your message will have gone forth. .. ."
<P>
"To what end? It may be. It may be. You
know I said, when you told me of these things dear
God! but that was scarcely a score of hours ago!--I
said that I had not your faith. Well--at any rate
there is nothing to do now. . . ."
<P>
"You have not my faith! Do you mean--? You
are sorry?"
<P>
"No," he said hurriedly, "no! Before God--no!"
His voice changed. "But--. I think--I have been
indiscreet. I knew little--I grasped too hastily.. .."
<P>
He paused. He was ashamed of this avowal.
"There is one thing that makes up for all. I have
known you. Across this gulf of time I have come to
you. The rest is done. It is done. With you, too,
it has been something more--or something less--"
<P>
He paused with his face searching hers, and without
clamoured the unheeded message that the aeroplanes
were rising into the sky of Amiens.
<P>
She put her hand to her throat, and her lips were .
white. She stared before her as if she saw some 
horrible possibility. Suddenly her features changed.
"Oh, but I have been honest!" she cried, and then,
"Have I been honest? I loved the world and freedom, 
I hated cruelty and oppression. Surely it was
that."
<P>
"Yes," he said, "yes. And we have done what it
lay in us to do. We have given our message, our
message! We have started Armageddon! But
now--. Now that we have, it may be our last hour,
together, now that all these greater things are
done. . . ."
<P>
He stopped. She sat in silence. Her face was a
white riddle.
<P>
For a moment they heeded nothing of a sudden stir
outside, a running to and fro, and cries. Then
Helen started to an attitude of tense attention. "It
is--," she cried and stood up, speechless, incredulous,
triumphant. And Graham, too, heard. Metallic voices
were shouting "Victory!" Yes it was "Victory!"
He stood up also with the light of a desperate hope
in his eyes.
<P>
Bursting through the curtains appeared the man in
yellow, startled and dishevelled with excitement.
"Victory," he cried, "victory! The people are winning. 
Ostrog's people have collapsed."
<P>
She rose." Victory? " And her voice was hoarse
and faint.
<P>
"What do you mean? " asked Graham. "Tell me!
What?"
<P>
"We have driven them out of the under galleries at
Norwood, Streatham is afire and burning wildly, and
Roehampton is ours. Ours!--and we have taken the
aeropile that lay thereon."
<P>
For an instant Graham and Helen stood in silence,
their hearts were beating fast, they looked at one 
another. For one last moment there gleamed in 
Graham his dream of empire, of kingship, with Helen by
his side. It gleamed, and passed.
<P>
A shrill bell rang. An agitated grey-headed man
appeared from the room of the Ward Leaders." It is
all over," he cried.
<P>
"What matters it now that we have Roehampton?
The aeroplanes have been sighted at Boulogne!"
<P>
"The Channel! " said the man in yellow. He calculated 
swiftly." Half an hour."
<P>
"They still have three of the flying stages," said the
old man.
<P>
"Those guns?" cried Graham.
<P>
" We cannot mount them--in half an hour."
<P>
" Do you mean they are found?"
<P>
"Too late," said the old man.
<P>
"If we could stop them another hour! " cried the
man in yellow.
<P>
"Nothing can stop them now," said the old man.
they have near a hundred aeroplanes in the first
fleet."
<P>
"Another hour? " asked Graham.
<P>
"To be so near!" said the Ward Leader. "Now
that we have found those guns. To be so near--.
If once we could get them out upon the roof spaces."
<P>
"How long would that take? " asked Graham
suddenly.
<P>
" An hour--certainly."
<P>
"Too late," cried the Ward Leader, " too late."
<P>
"Is it too late?" said Graham. "Even now--.
An hour! "
<P>
He had suddenly perceived a possibility. He tried
to speak calmly, but his face was white. "There is
one chance. You said there was an aeropile--? "
<P>
"On the Roehampton stage, Sire."
<P>
"Smashed? "
<P>
"No. It is Iying crossways to the carrier. It might
be got upon the guides--easily. But there is no
aeronaut--."
<P>
Graham glanced at the two men and then at Helen.
He spoke after a long pause. "We have no
aeronauts? "
<P>
"None."
<P>
"The aeroplanes are clumsy," he said thoughtfully,
"compared with the aeropiles."
<P>
He turned suddenly to Helen. His decision was
made. "I must do it."
<P>
"Do what? "
<P>
"Go to this flying stage--to this aeropile."
<P>
"What do you mean?"
<P>
"I am an aeronaut. After all--. Those days for 
which you reproached me were
wasted."
<P>
He turned to the old man in yellow.
put the aeropile upon the guides."
<P>
The man in yellow hesitated.
<P>
"What do you mean to do?" cried Helen.
<P>
"This aeropile--it is a chance--."
<P>
"You don't mean--?"
<P>
"To fight--yes. To fight in the air. I have
thought before--. An aeroplane is a clumsy thing.
A resolute man--!"
<P>
"But--never since flying began--" cried the man
in yellow.
<P>
"There has been no need. But now the time has
come. Tell them now--send them my message--to
put it upon the guides."
<P>
The old man dumbly interrogated the man in yellow, 
nodded, and hurried out.
<P>
Helen made a step towards Graham. Her face was
white." But--How can one fight? You will be
killed."
<P>
"Perhaps. Yet, not to do it--or to let someone
else attempt it--."
<P>
He stopped, he could speak no more, he swept the
alternative aside by a gesture, and they stood looking
at one another.
<P>
"You are right," she said at last in a low tone.
"You are right. If it can be done. . .
must go."
<P>
Those days for

<P>
He moved a step towards her, and she stepped back,
her white face struggled against him and resisted him.
"No," she gasped. "I cannot bear--. Go now."
<P>
He extended his hands stupidly. She clenched her
fists. "Go now," she cried. "Go now."
<P>
He hesitated and understood. He threw his hands
up in a queer half-theatrical gesture. He had no word
to say. He turned from her.
<P>
The man in yellow moved towards the door with
clumsy belated tact. But Graham stepped past him.
He went striding through the room where the Ward
Leader bawled at a telephone directing that the aeropile
should be put upon the guides.
<P>
The man in yellow glanced at Helen's still figure,
hesitated and hurried after him. Graham did not once
look back, he did not speak until the curtain of the
ante-chamber of the great hall fell behind him. Then
he turned his head with curt swift directions upon his
bloodless lips.
