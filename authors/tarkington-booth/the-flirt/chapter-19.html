<p>Memory, that drowsy custodian, had wakened slowly, during this
hour, beginning the process with fitful gleams of semi-consciousness,
then, irritated, searching its pockets for the keys and dazedly
exploring blind passages; but now it flung wide open the gallery
doors, and there, in clear light, were the rows of painted canvasses.</p>

<p>He remembered "that day" when he was waiting for a car, and Laura
Madison had stopped for a moment, and then had gone on, saying
she preferred to walk. He remembered that after he got into the
car he wondered why he had not walked home with her; had thought
himself "slow" for not thinking of it in time to do it. There
had seemed something very "taking" about her, as she stopped and
spoke to him, something enlivening and wholesome and sweet&mdash;it
had struck him that Laura was a "very nice girl." He had never
before noticed how really charming she could look; in fact he
had never thought much about either of the Madison sisters, who
had become "young ladies" during his mourning for his brother.
And this pleasant image of Laura remained with him for several
days, until he decided that it might be a delightful thing to
spend an evening with her. He had called, and he remembered, now,
Cora's saying to him that he looked at her sometimes as if he
did not like her; he had been surprised and astonishingly pleased
to detect a mysterious feeling in her about it.</p>

<p>He remembered that almost at once he had fallen in love with
Cora: she captivated him, enraptured him, as she still did&mdash;as
she always would, he felt, no matter how she treated him or what
she did to him. He did not analyze the process of the captivation
and enrapturement&mdash;for love is a mystery and cannot be analyzed.
This is so well known that even Richard Lindley knew it, and did
not try!</p>

<p>. . . Heartsick, he stared at the fallen book. He was a man,
and here was the proffered love of a woman he did not want. There
was a pathos in the ledger; it seemed to grovel, sprawling and
dishevelled in the circle of lamp-light on the floor: it was as
if Laura herself lay pleading at his feet, and he looked down
upon her, compassionate but revolted. He realized with astonishment
from what a height she had fallen, how greatly he had respected
her, how warmly liked her. What she now destroyed had been more
important than he had guessed.</p>

<p>Simple masculine indignation rose within him: she was to have
been his sister. If she had been unable to stifle this misplaced
love of hers, could she not at least have kept it to herself?
Laura, the self-respecting! No; she offered it&mdash;offered it to
her sister's betrothed. She had written that he should "never,
never know it"; that when she was "cured" she would burn the ledger.
She had not burned it! There were inconsistencies in plenty in
the pitiful screed, but these were the wildest&mdash;and the cheapest.
In talk, she had urged him to "keep trying," for Cora, and now
the sick-minded creature sent him this record. She wanted him
to know. Then what else was it but a plea? "I love you. Let Cora
go. Take me."</p>

<p>He began to walk up and down, wondering what was to be done.
After a time, he picked up the book gingerly, set it upon a shelf
in a dark corner, and went for a walk outdoors. The night air
seemed better than that of the room that held the ledger.</p>

<p>At the corner a boy, running, passed him. It was Hedrick Madison,
but Hedrick did not recognize Richard, nor was his mind at that
moment concerned with Richard's affairs; he was on an errand of
haste to Doctor Sloane. Mr. Madison had wakened from a heavy slumber
unable to speak, his condition obviously much worse.</p>

<p>Hedrick returned in the doctor's car, and then hung uneasily
about the door of the sick-room until Laura came out and told
him to go to bed. In the morning, his mother did not appear at
the breakfast table, Cora was serious and quiet, and Laura said
that he need not go to school that day, though she added that
the doctor thought their father would get "better." She looked
wan and hollow-eyed: she had not been to bed, but declared that
she would rest after breakfast. Evidently she had not missed her
ledger; and Hedrick watched her closely, a pleasurable excitement
stirring in his breast.</p>

<p>She did not go to her room after the meal; the house was cold,
possessing no furnace, and, with Hedrick's assistance, she carried
out the ashes from the library grate, and built a fire there.
She had just lighted it, and the kindling was beginning to crackle,
glowing rosily over her tired face, when the bell rang.</p>

<p>"Will you see who it is, please, Hedrick?"</p>

<p>He went with alacrity, and, returning, announced in an odd voice.
"It's Dick Lindley. He wants to see you."</p>

<p>"Me?" she murmured, wanly surprised. She was kneeling before
the fireplace, wearing an old dress which was dusted with ashes,
and upon her hands a pair of worn-out gloves of her father's.
Lindley appeared in the hall behind Hedrick, carrying under his
arm something wrapped in brown paper. His expression led her to
think that he had heard of her father's relapse, and came on that
account.</p>

<p>"Don't look at me, Richard," she said, smiling faintly as she
rose, and stripping her hands of the clumsy gloves. "It's good
of you to come, though. Doctor Sloane thinks he is going to be
better again."</p>

<p>Richard inclined his head gravely, but did not speak.</p>

<p>"Well," said Hedrick with a slight emphasis, "I guess I'll go
out in the yard a while." And with shining eyes he left the room.</p>

<p>In the hall, out of range from the library door, he executed
a triumphant but noiseless caper, and doubled with mirth, clapping
his hand over his mouth to stifle the effervescings of his joy.
He had recognized the ledger in the same wrapping in which he
had left it in Mrs. Lindley's vestibule. His moment had come:
the climax of his enormous joke, the repayment in some small measure
for the anguish he had so long endured. He crept silently back
toward the door, flattened his back against the wall, and listened.</p>

<p>"Richard," he heard Laura say, a vague alarm in her voice, "what
is it? What is the matter?"</p>

<p>Then Lindley: "I did not know what to do about it. I couldn't
think of any sensible thing. I suppose what I am doing is the
stupidest of all the things I thought of, but at least it's honest&mdash;so
I've brought it back to you myself. Take it, please."</p>

<p>There was a crackling of the stiff wrapping paper, a little pause,
then a strange sound from Laura. It was not vocal and no more
than just audible: it was a prolonged scream in a whisper.</p>

<p>Hedrick ventured an eye at the crack, between the partly open
door and its casing. Lindley stood with his back to him, but the
boy had a clear view of Laura. She was leaning against the wall,
facing Richard, the book clutched in both arms against her bosom,
the wrapping paper on the floor at her feet.</p>

<p>"I thought of sending it back and pretending to think it had
been left at my mother's house by mistake," said Richard sadly,
"and of trying to make it seem that I hadn't read any of it. I
thought of a dozen ways to pretend I believed you hadn't really
meant me to read it&#11834;"</p>

<p>Making a crucial effort, she managed to speak.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;think <em>I&mdash;</em>did mean&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Well," he answered, with a helpless shrug, "you sent it! But
it's what's in it that really matters, isn't it? I could have
pretended anything in a note, I suppose, if I had written instead
of coming. But I found that what I most dreaded was meeting you
again, and as we've got to meet, of course, it seemed to me the
only thing to do was to blunder through a talk with you, somehow
or another, and get that part of it over. I thought the longer
I put off facing you, the worse it would be for both of us&mdash;and&mdash;and
the more embarrassing. I'm no good at pretending, anyhow; and
the thing has happened. What use is there in not being honest?
Well?"</p>

<p>She did not try again to speak. Her state was lamentable: it
was all in her eyes.</p>

<p>Richard hung his head wretchedly, turning partly away from her.
"There's only one way&mdash;to look at it," he said hesitatingly, and
stammering. "That is&mdash;there's only one thing to do: to forget
that it's happened. I'm &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>oh, well, I care for
Cora altogether. She's got never to know about this. She hasn't
any idea or&mdash;suspicion of it, has she?"</p>

<p>Laura managed to shake her head.</p>

<p>"She never must have," he said. "Will you promise me to burn
that book now?"</p>

<p>She nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I'm awfully sorry, Laura," he said brokenly. "I'm not
idiot enough not to see that you're suffering horribly. I suppose
I have done the most blundering thing possible." He stood a moment,
irresolute, then turned to the door. "Good-bye."</p>

<p>Hedrick had just time to dive into the hideous little room of
the multitudinous owls as Richard strode into the hall. Then,
with the closing of the front door, the boy was back at his post.</p>

<p>Laura stood leaning against the wall, the book clutched in her
arms, as Richard had left her. Slowly she began to sink, her eyes
wide open, and, with her back against the wall, she slid down
until she was sitting upon the floor. Her arms relaxed and hung
limp at her sides, letting the book topple over in her lap, and
she sat motionless.</p>

<p>One of her feet protruded from her skirt, and the leaping firelight
illumined it ruddily. It was a graceful foot in an old shoe which
had been re-soled and patched. It seemed very still, that patched
shoe, as if it might stay still forever. Hedrick knew that Laura
had not fainted, but he wished she would move her foot.</p>

<p>He went away. He went into the owl-room again, and stood there
silently a long, long time. Then he stole back again toward the
library door, but caught a glimpse of that old, motionless shoe
through the doorway as he came near. Then he spied no more. He
went out to the stable, and, secluding himself in his studio,
sat moodily to meditate.</p>

<p>Something was the matter. Something had gone wrong. He had thrown
a bomb which he had expected to go off with a stupendous bang,
leaving him, as the smoke cleared, looking down in merry triumph,
stinging his fallen enemies with his humour, withering them with
satire, and inquiring of them how it felt, now <em>they</em> were
getting it. But he was decidedly untriumphant: he wished Laura
had moved her foot and that she hadn't that patch upon her shoe.
He could not get his mind off that patch. He began to feel very
queer: it seemed to be somehow because of the patch. If she had
worn a pair of new shoes that morning. . . . Yes, it was that
patch.</p>

<p>Thirteen is a dangerous age: nothing is more subtle. The boy,
inspired to play the man, is beset by his own relapses into childhood,
and Hedrick was near a relapse.</p>

<p>By and by, he went into the house again, to the library. Laura
was not there, but he found the fire almost smothered under heaping
ashes. She had burned her book.</p>

<p>He went into the room where the piano was, and played "The Girl
on the Saskatchewan" with one finger; then went out to the porch
and walked up and down, whistling cheerily.</p>

<p>After that, he went upstairs and asked Miss Peirce how his father
was "feeling," receiving a noncommital reply; looked in at Cora's
room; saw that his mother was lying asleep on Cora's bed and Cora
herself examining the contents of a dressing-table drawer; and
withdrew. A moment later, he stood in the passage outside Laura's
closed door listening. There was no sound.</p>

<p>He retired to his own chamber, found it unbearable, and, fascinated
by Laura's, returned thither; and, after standing a long time
in the passage, knocked softly on the door.</p>

<p>"Laura," he called, in a rough and careless voice, "it's kind
of a pretty day outdoors. If you've had your nap, if I was you
I'd go out for a walk." There was no response. "I'll go with you,"
he added, "if you want me to."</p>

<p>He listened again and heard nothing. Then he turned the knob
softly. The door was unlocked; he opened it and went in.</p>

<p>Laura was sitting in a chair, with her back to a window, her
hands in her lap. She was staring straight in front of her.</p>

<p>He came near her hesitatingly, and at first she did not seem
to see him or even to know that she was not alone in the room.
Then she looked at him wonderingly, and, as he stood beside her,
lifted her right hand and set it gently upon his head.</p>

<p>"Hedrick," she said, "was it you that took my book to&#11834;"</p>

<p>All at once he fell upon his knees, hid his face in her lap,
and burst into loud and passionate sobbing.</p>
