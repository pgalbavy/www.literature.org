<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Does there exist an incredulous, or jealous, denizen of another
portion of our country who, knowing that the room in the wooden
cupola over Mr. Carewe's library was commonly alluded to by Rouen
as the "Tower Chamber," will prove himself so sectionally prejudiced
as to deny that the town was a veritable hotbed of literary interest,
or that Sir 'Walter Scott was ill-appreciated there? Some of the
men looked sly, and others grinned, at mention of this apartment;
but the romantic were not lacking who spoke of it in whispers:
how the lights sometimes shone there all night long, and the gentlemen
drove away, whitefaced, in the dawn. The cupola, rising above
the library, overlooked the garden; and the house, save for that,
was of a single story, with a low veranda running the length of
its front. The windows of the library and of a row of bedrooms&#11834;one
of which was Miss Betty's&mdash;lined the veranda, "steamboat fashion;"
the inner doors of these rooms all opening upon a long hail which
bisected the house, the stairway leading to the room in the cupola
rose the library itself, while the bisecting hail afforded be
only access to the library; hence, the gossips, 'eli acquainted
with the geography of the place, conferred seriously together
upon what effect Miss Betty's homecoming would have in this connection:</p>

<p>Dr anyone going to the stairway must needs pass her door; and,
what was more to the point, a party C gentlemen descending late
from the mysterious garret might be not so quiet as they intended,
and the young lady sufficiently disturbed to inquire of her father
what entertainment he provided that should keep his guests until
four in the morning.</p>

<p>But at present it was with the opposite end of the house that
the town was occupied, for there, workmen were hammering and sawing
and painting day long, finishing the addition Mr. Carewe was building
for his daughter's debut. This hammering disturbed Miss Betty,
who had become almost as busy with the French Revolution as with
her mantua-maker. For she had found in her father's library many
books not for convent-shelves; and she had become a Girondin.
She found memoirs, histories, and tales of that delectable period,
then not so dim with time but that the figures of it were more
than tragic shadows; and for a week there was no meal in that
house to which she sat down earlier than half an hour Jate. She
had a rightful property-interest in the Revolution, her own great-uncle
having been one of those who "suffered;"  not, however, under
the guillotine; for to Georges Meilhac appertained the rare distinction
of death by accident on the day when the business-like young Bonaparte
played upon the mob with his cannon.</p>

<p>There were some yellow letters of this great uncle's in a box
which had belonged to her grandmother, a rich discovery for Miss
Betty, who read and re-read them with eager and excited eyes,
living more in Paris with Georges and his friends than in Rouen
with her father. Indeed, she had little else to do. Mr. Carewe
was no comrade for her, by far the reverse. She seldom saw him,
except at the table, when he sat with averted eyes, and talked
to her very little; and, while making elaborate preparation for
her introduction to his friends (such was his phrase) he treated
her with a perfunctory civility which made her wonder if her advent
was altogether welcome to him; bat when she noticed that his hair
looked darker than usual about every fourth day, she began to
understand Why he appeared ungrateful to her for growing up. He
went out a great deal, though no visitors came to the house; for
it was known that Mr. Carewe desired to present his daughter to
no one until he presented her to all. Fanchon Bareaud, indeed,
made one hurried and embarrassed call, evading Miss Betty's reference
to the chevalier of the kitten with a dexterity too nimble to
be thought unintentional. Miss Carewe was forbidden to return
her friend's visit until after her debut; and Mr. Carewe explained
that there was always some worthless Young men hanging about the
Bareaud's, where (he did not add) they interfered with a worthy
oh one who desired to honor Fanchon's older sister, Virginia,
with his attentions.</p>

<p>This was no great hardship for Miss Betty, as, since plunging
into the Revolution with her great-uncle, she had lost some curiosity
concerning the men of to-day, doubting that they would show forth
as heroic, as debonnair, gay and tragic as he. He was the legendary
hero of her childhood; she remembered her mother's stories of
him perhaps more clearly than she remembered her mother; and one
of the older Sisters had known him in Paris and had talked of
him at length, giving the flavor of his dandyism and his beauty
at first hand to his young relative. He had been one of those
hardy young men wearing unbelievable garments, who began to appear
in the garden of the Tuileries with knives in their sleeves and
cudgels in their hands, about April, 1794, and whose dash and
recklessness in many matters were the first intimations that the
Citizen Tallien was about to cause the Citizen Robespierre to
shoot himself through the jaw.</p>

<p>In the library hung a small, full-length drawing of Georges,
done in color by Miss Betty's grandmother; and this she carried
to her own room an&amp; studied long and ardently, until sometimes
the man himself seemed to stand before her, in spite of the fact
that Mile. Meithac had not a distinguished talent and M. Meilhac's
features might have been anybody's. It was to be seen, however,
that he was smiling.</p>

<p>Miss Betty had an impression that her grandmother's art of portraiture
would have been more-successful with the profile than the "full-face." 
Nevertheless, nothing could be more clearly indicated than that
the hair of M. Melihac was very yellow, and his short, huge-lapelled
waistcoat white, striped with scarlet. An enormous cravat covered
his chin; the heavy collar of his yellow coat rose behind his
ears, while its tails fell to his ankles; and the tight trousers
of white and yellow stripes were tied with white ribbons about
the middle of the calf; he wore white stockings and gold-buckled
yellow shoes, and on the back of his head a jauntily cocked black
hat. Miss Betty innocently wondered why his letters did not speak
of Petion, of Vergniaud, or of Dumoriez, since in the historical
novels which she read, the hero's lot was inevitably linked with
that of everyone of importance in his generation; yet Georges
appeared to have been unacquainted with these personages, Robespierre
being the only name of consequence mentioned in his letters; and
then it appeared in much the same fashion practised by her father
in alluding to the Governor of the State, who had the misfortune
to be unpopular with Mr. Carewe. But this did not dim her great-uncle's
lustre in Miss Betty's eyes, nor lessen for her the pathetic romance
of the smile he wore.</p>

<p>Beholding this smile, one remembered the end to which his light
footsteps bad led him; and it was unavoidable to picture him left
lying in the empty street behind the heels of the flying crowd,
carefully forming that same smile on his lips, and taking much
pride in passing with some small, cynical speech, murmured to
himself, concerning the futility of a gentleman's getting shot
by his friends for merely being present to applaud them. So, fancying
him thus, with his yellow hair, his scarlet-striped waistcoat,
and his tragedy, the young girl felt a share of family greatness,
or, at least, of picturesqueness, descend to her. And she smiled
sadly back upon the smile in the picture, and dreamed about its
original night after night.</p>

<p>Whether or no another figure, that of a dark young man in a white
hat, with a white kitten etching his wrist in red, found any place
in her dreams at this period,&mdash;it is impossible to determine.
She did not see him again. It is quite another thing, hazardous
to venture, to state that he did not see her. At all events, it
is certain that many people who bad never beheld her were talking
of her; that Rouen was full of contention concerning her beauty
and her gift of music, for a song can be heard through an open
window. And how did it happen that Crailey Gray knew that it was
Miss Carewe's habit to stroll in her garden for half an hour or
so, each evening before retiring, and that she went to mass every
morning soon after sunrise? Crailey Gray never rose at, or near,
sunrise in his life, though he sometimes beheld it, from another
point of view, as the end of the evening. It appears that someone
must have told him.</p>

<p>One night when the moon lay white on the trees and housetops,
Miss Betty paused in her evening promenade and seated herself
upon a bench on the borders of the garden, "touched," as the books
of the time would have put it, "by the sweet tranquillity of the
scene," and wrought upon by the tender incentive to sighs and
melancholy which youth in loneliness finds in a loveliness of
the earth. The breeze bore the smells of the old-fashioned garden,
of violets and cherry blossoms, and a sound of distant violins
came on the air playing the new song from the new opera.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"But I also dreamt, which pleased me most,<br/>
That you loved me just the same&mdash;"

</p>
</div>
<p>they sang; and with the lilt of them and the keen beauty of the
night, the inherited pain of the ages rose from the depths of
the young girl's heart, so that she thought it must break; for
what reason she could not have told, since she was without care
or sorrow that she knew, except the French Revolution, yet tears
shone upon the long lashes. She shook them off and looked up with
a sudden odd consciousness. The next second she sprang to her
feet with a gasp and a choked outcry, her bands pressed to her
breast.</p>

<p>Ten paces in front of her, a gap in the shrubbery where tall
trees rose left a small radiant area of illumination like that
of a lime-light in a theatre, its brilliancy intensified by the
dark foliage behind. It was open to view only from the bench by
which she stood, and appeared, indeed, like the stage of a little
theatre a stage occupied by a bizarre figure. For, in the centre
of this shining patch, with the light strong on his face, was
standing a fair-haired young man, dressed in a yellow coat, a
scarlet and white striped waistcoat, wearing a jauntily cocked
black hat on his bead. And even to the last detail, the ribbon
laces above the ankle and the gold-buckled shoes, he was the sketch
of Georges Meilhac sprung into life.</p>

<p>About this slender figure there hung a wan sweetness like a fine
mist, almost an ethereality in that light; yet in the pale face
lurked something reckless, something of the actor, too; and though
his smile was gentle and wistful, there was a twinkle behind it,
not seen at first, something amused and impish; a small surprise
underneath, like a flea in a rose-jar.</p>

<p>Fixed to the spot by this apparition, Miss Betty stood wildly
staring, her straining eyelids showing the white above and below
the large brown iris. Her breath came faster and deeper, until,
between her parted lips it became vocal in a quick sound like
a sob. At that he spoke.</p>

<p>"Forgive me!" The voice was low, vibrant, and so exceedingly
musical that he might have been accused of coolly selecting his
best tone; and it became only sweeter when, even more softly,
in a semi-whisper of almost crucial pleading, he said, "Ah&mdash;don't
go away!"</p>

<p>In truth, she could not go; she had been too vitally stirred;
she began to tremble excessively, and sank back upon the bench,
motioning him away with vague gestures of her shaking hands.</p>

<p>This was more than the Incroyable had counted upon, and far from
his desires. He started forward with an exclamation.</p>

<p>"Don't come near me!" she gasped. "Who are you? Go away!"</p>

<p>"Give me one second to explain," he began; but with the instant
reassurance of this beginning she cut him off short, her fears
dispelled by his commonplace. Nay, indignation displaced them
so quickly that she fairly flashed up before him to her full height.</p>

<p>"You did not come in by the gate!" she cried. "What do you mean
by coming here in that dress What right have you in my garden?"</p>

<p>"Just one word," he begged quickly, but very gently. "You'd allow
a street-beggar that much!"</p>

<p>She stood before him, panting, and, as he thought, glorious,
in her flush of youth and anger. Tom Vanrevel had painted her
incoherently, but richly, in spite of that, his whole heart being
in the portrait; and &mdash;Crailey Gray had smiled at what he
deemed the exaggeration of an ordinarily unimpressionable man
who had fallen in love "at first sight;"  yet, in the presence
of the reality, the Incroyable decided that Tom's colors had been
gray and humble. It was not that she was merely lovely, that her
nose was straight, and her chin dexterously wrought between square
and oval; that her dark hair lay soft as a shadow on her white
brow; not that the trembling hand she held against her breast
sprang from a taper wrist and tapered again to the tips of the
long fingers; nor that she was of that slenderness as strong as
it is delicate; not all the exquisite regularity of line and mould,
nor simplicity of color, gave her that significance which made
the Incroyable declare to himself that he stood for the first
time in the presence of Beauty, and that now he knew the women
he had been wont to call beautiful were but pretty. And yet her
beauty, he told himself, was the least of her loveliness, for
there was a glamour about her. It was not only the richness of
her youth; but there was an ineffable exhalation which seemed
to be made partly of light, partly of the very spirit of her,
and, oddly enough, partly of the scent of the little fan that
hung by a ribbon from her waist. This was a woman like a wine,
he felt, there was a bouquet.</p>

<p>In regard to the bouquet of the young man himself, if he possessed
one, it is pertinent to relate that at this very instant the thought
skipped across his mind (like the hop of a flea in a rose-jar)
that some day he might find the moment when he could tell her
the truth about herself&mdash;with a half-laugh&mdash;and say: "The angels
sent their haloes in a sandal-wood box to be made into a woman&mdash;and
it was you!"</p>

<p>"If you have anything to say for yourself, say it quickly!" said
Miss Betty.</p>

<p>"You were singing a while ago," he answered, somewhat huskily,
"and I stopped on the street to listen; then I came here to be
nearer. The spell of your voice&mdash;" He broke off abruptly to change
the word. "The spell of the song came over me&mdash;it is my dearest
favorite&mdash;so that I stood afterward in a sort of trance, only
hearing again, in the silence, 'The stolen heart, like the gathered
rose, will bloom but for a day!' I did not see you until you came
to the bench. You must believe me: I would not have frightened
you for anything in the world."</p>

<p>"Why are you wearing that dress?"</p>

<p>He laughed, and pointed to where, behind him on the ground, lay
a long gray cloak, upon which had been tossed a white mask. "I'm
on my way to the masquerade;" he answered, with an airy gesture
in the direction of the violins. "I'm an Incroyable, you see;
and I had the costume made from my recollection of a sketch of
your great-uncle. I saw it a long time ago in your library."</p>

<p>Miss Carewe's accustomed poise was quite recovered; indeed, she
was astonished to discover a distinct trace of disappointment
that the brilliant apparition must offer so tame an explanation.
What he said was palpably the truth; there was a masquerade that
night, she knew, at the Madrillon's, a little way up Carewe Street,
and her father had gone, an hour earlier, a blue domino over his
arm.</p>

<p>The Incroyable was a person of almost magical perceptiveness;
he felt the let-down immediately and feared a failure. This would
not do; the attitude of tension between them must be renewed at
once. "You'll forgive me?" he began, in a quickly impassioned
tone. "It was only after you sang, a dream possessed me, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I cannot stay to talk with you," Miss Betty interrupted, and
added, with a straightforwardness which made him afraid she would
prove lamentably direct: "I do not know you."</p>

<p>Perhaps she remembered that already one young man had been presented
to her by no better sponsor than a white cat, and had no desire
to carry her unconventionality farther than that. In the present
instance there was not even a kitten.</p>

<p>She turned toward the house, whereupon he gave a little pathetic
exclamation of pleading in a voice that was masterly, being as
sincere as it was musical, and he took a few leaning steps toward
her, both hands outstretched.</p>

<p>"One moment more!" he cried, as she turned again to him. "It
may be the one chance of my life to speak with you; don't deny
me this. &mdash;All the rest will meet you when the happy evening
comes, will dance with you, talk with you, see you when they like,
listen to you sing. I, alone, must hover about the gates, or steal
like a thief into your garden to hear you from a distance. Listen
to me&mdash;just this once&mdash;for a moment?"</p>

<p>"I cannot listen," she said firmly; and stood quite still. She
was now in deep shadow.</p>

<p>"I will not believe you merciless! You would not condemn the
meanest criminal unheard!" Remembering that she was so lately
from the convent, he ventured this speech in a deep, thrilling
voice, only to receive a distinct shock for his pains, for she
greeted it with an irrepressible, most unexpected peal of contralto
laughter, and his lips parted slightly with the surprise of it.</p>

<p>They parted much farther in the next instant&mdash;in good truth,
it may be stated of the gentleman that he was left with his mouth
open&mdash;for, suddenly leaning toward him out of the shadow into
the light, her face shining as a cast of tragedy, she cried in
a hoarse whisper:</p>

<p>"Are you a murderer?"</p>

<p>And with that and a whisk of her skirts, and a footfall on the
gravel path, she was gone. He stood dumbfounded, poor comedian,
having come to play the chief role, but to find the scene taken
out of his hands. Then catching the flutter of her wrap, as she
disappeared into the darkness of the veranda, he cried in a loud,
manly voice:</p>

<p>"You are a dear!"</p>

<p>As he came out into the street through a gap in the hedge, he
paused, drawing his cloak about him, and lifted his face to the
eastern moon. It was a strange face: the modelling most like what
is called "Greek," save for the nose, which was a trifle too short
for that, and the features showed a happy purity of outline almost
childlike; the blue eyes, clear, fleckless, serenely irresponsible,
with more the look of refusing responsibility than being unconscious
of it; eyes without care, without prudence, and without evil.
A stranger might have said he was about twenty-five and had never
a thought in his life. There were some blossoms on the hedge,
and he touched one lightly, as though he chucked it under the
chin; he smiled upon it then, but not as he had smiled upon Miss
Betty, for this was his own, the smile that came when he was alone;
and, when it came, the face was no longer joyous as it had been
in repose; there was an infinite patience and worn tolerance-possibly
for himself. This incongruous and melancholy smile was astonishing:
one looked for the laughter of a boy and found, instead, a gentle,
worldly, old prelate.</p>

<p>Standing there, all alone in the moonlight, by the hedge, he
lifted both hands high and waved them toward the house, as children
wave to each other across lawns at twilight. After that he made
a fantastic bow to his corrugated shadow on the board sidewalk.</p>

<p>"Again, you rogue!" he exclaimed aloud. Then, as he faced about
and began to walk in the direction of the beckoning violins: "I
wonder if Tom's kitten was better, after all!"</p>
