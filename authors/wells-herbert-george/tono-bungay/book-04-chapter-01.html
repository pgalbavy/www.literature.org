I
                         
That evening I talked with my uncle in the Hardingham for the
last time.  The atmosphere of the place had altered quite
shockingly.  Instead of the crowd of importunate courtiers there
were just half a dozen uninviting  men, journalists waiting for
an interview.  Ropper the big commissionaire was still there, but
now indeed he was defending my uncle from something more than
time-wasting intrusions.  I found the little man alone in the
inner office pretending to work, but really brooding.  He was
looking yellow and deflated.
<P>
"Lord!" he said at the sight of me.  "You're lean, George.  It
makes that scar of yours show up."  
<P>
We regarded each other gravely for a time.
<P>
"Quap," I said, "is at the bottom of the Atlantic. There's some
bills--We've got to pay the men."  
<P>
"Seen the papers?" 
<P>
"Read 'em all in the train."  
<P>
"At bay," he said.  "I been at bay for a week....  Yelping round
me....  And me facing the music.  I'm feelin' a bit tired."  
<P>
He blew and wiped his glasses.
<P>
"My stomack isn't what it was," he explained.  "One finds
it--these times.  How did it all happen, George?  Your
Marconigram--it took me in the wind a bit."  
<P>
I told him concisely.  He nodded to the paragraphs of my
narrative and at the end he poured something from a medicine
bottle into a sticky little wineglass and drank it.  I became
aware of the presence of drugs, of three or four small bottles
before him among his disorder of papers, of a faint elusively
familiar odour in the room.
<P>
"Yes," he said, wiping his lips and recorking the bottle. 
"You've done your best, George.  The luck's been against us."  
<P>
He reflected, bottle in hand.  "Sometimes the luck goes with you
and sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes it doesn't.  And then where
are you?  Grass in the oven!  Fight or no fight."  
<P>
He asked a few questions and then his thoughts came back to his
own urgent affairs.  I tried to get some comprehensive account of
the situation from him, but he would not give it.
<P>
"Oh, I wish I'd had you.  I wish I'd had you, George. I've had a
lot on my hands.  You're clear headed at times."  
<P>
"What has happened?" 
<P>
"Oh! Boom!--infernal things."  
<P>
"Yes, but--how?  I'm just off the sea, remember."  
<P>
"It'd worry me too much to tell you now.  It's tied up in a
skein."  
<P>
He muttered something to himself and mused darkly, and roused
himself to say--
<P>
"Besides--you'd better keep out of it.  It's getting tight.  Get
'em talking.  Go down to Crest Hill and fly.  That's YOUR
affair."  
<P>
For a time his manner set free queer anxieties in my brain again.
<P>
I will confess that that Mordet Island nightmare of mine
returned, and as I looked at him his hand went out for the drug
again.  "Stomach, George,"  he said.
<P>
"I been fightin' on that.  Every man fights on some thing--gives
way somewheres--head, heart, liver--something.  Zzzz.  Gives way
somewhere.  Napoleon did at last.  All through the Waterloo
campaign, his stomach--it wasn't a stomach! Worse than mine, no
end."  
<P>
The mood of depression passed as the drug worked within him.  His
eyes brightened.  He began to talk big.  He began to dress up the
situation for my eyes, to recover what he had admitted to me. 
He put it as a retreat from Russia.  There were still the chances
of Leipzig.
<P>
"It's a battle, George--a big fight.  We're fighting for
millions.  I've still chances.  There's still a card or so.  I
can't tell all my plans--like speaking on the stroke."  
<P>
"You might," I began.
<P>
"I can't, George.  It's like asking to look at some embryo.  You
got to wait.  I know.  In a sort of way, I know.  But to tell
it-- No! You been away so long.  And everything's got
complicated."  
<P>
My perception of disastrous entanglements deepened with the rise
of his spirits.  It was evident that I could only help to tie him
up in whatever net was weaving round his mind by forcing
questions and explanations upon him.  My thoughts flew off at
another angle. "How's Aunt Susan?" said I.
<P>
I had to repeat the question.  His busy whispering lips stopped
for a moment, and he answered in the note of one who repeats a
formula.
<P>
"She'd like to be in the battle with me.  She'd like to be here
in London.  But there's corners I got to turn alone."  His eye
rested for a moment on the little bottle beside him.  "And things
have happened.
<P>
"You might go down now and talk to her," he said, in a directer
voice.  "I shall be down to-morrow night, I think."  
<P>
He looked up as though he hoped that would end our talk.
<P>
"For the week-end?" I asked.
<P>
"For the week-end.  Thank God for week-ends, George!"
<P>
II                    
<P>
My return home to Lady Grove was a very different thing from what
I had anticipated when I had got out to sea with my load of quap
and fancied the Perfect-Filament was safe within my grasp.  As I
walked through the evening light along the downs, the summer
stillness seemed like the stillness of something newly dead. 
There were no lurking workmen any more, no cyclists on the high
road.
<P>
Cessation was manifest everywhere.  There had been, I learnt from
my aunt, a touching and quite voluntary demonstration when the
Crest Hill work had come to an end and the men had drawn their
last pay; they had cheered my uncle and hooted the contractors
and Lord Boom.
<P>
I cannot now recall the manner in which my aunt and I greeted one
another.  I must have been very tired there, but whatever
impression was made has gone out of my memory.  But I recall very
clearly how we sat at the little round table near the big window
that gave on the terrace, and dined and talked.  I remember her
talking of my uncle.
<P>
She asked after him, and whether he seemed well. "I wish I could
help," she said.  "But I've never helped him much, never.  His
way of doing things was never mine.  And since--since--.  Since
he began to get so rich, he's kept things from me.  In the old
days--it was different....
<P>
"There he is--I don't know what he's doing.  He won't have me
near him....
<P>
"More's kept from me than anyone.  The very servants won't let
me know.  They try and stop the worst of the papers--Boom's
things--from coming upstairs.... I suppose they've got him in a
corner, George.  Poor old Teddy!  Poor old Adam and Eve we are! 
Ficial Receivers with flaming swords to drive us out of our
garden!  I'd hoped we'd never have another Trek.  Well--anyway,
it won't be Crest Hill.... But it's hard on Teddy.  He must be in
such a mess up there.  Poor old chap.  I suppose we can't help
him.  I suppose we'd only worry him.  Have some more soup
George--while there is some?..."  
<P>
The next day was one of those days of strong perception  that
stand out clear in one's memory when the common course of days is
blurred.  I can recall now the awakening in the large familiar
room that was always kept for me, and how I lay staring at its
chintz-covered chairs, its spaced fine furniture, its glimpse
of the cedars without, and thought that all this had to end.
<P>
I have never been greedy for money, I have never wanted to be
rich, but I felt now an immense sense of impending deprivation. 
I read the newspapers after breakfast--I and my aunt
together--and then I walked up to see what Cothope had done in
the matter of Lord Roberts B.  Never before had I appreciated so
acutely the ample brightness of the Lady Grove gardens, the
dignity and wide peace of all about me.  It was one of those warm
mornings in late May that have won all the glory of summer
without losing the gay delicacy of spring.  The shrubbery was
bright with laburnum and lilac, the beds swarmed with daffodils
and narcissi and with lilies of the valley in the shade.
<P>
I went along the well-kept paths among the rhododendra  and
through the private gate into the woods where the bluebells and
common orchid were in profusion.   Never before had I tasted so
completely the fine sense of privilege and ownership.  And all
this has to end, I told myself, all this has to end.
<P>
Neither my uncle nor I had made any provision for disaster; all
we had was in the game, and I had little doubt now of the
completeness of our ruin.  For the first time in my life since he
had sent me that wonderful telegram of his I had to consider that
common anxiety of mankind,--Employment.  I had to come off my
magic carpet and walk once more in the world.
<P>
And suddenly I found myself at the cross drives where I had seen
Beatrice for the first time after so many years.  It is strange,
but so far as I can recollect I had not thought of her once since
I had landed at Plymouth.  No doubt she had filled the background
of my mind, but I do not remember one definite, clear thought.  I
had been intent on my uncle and the financial  collapse.
<P>
It came like a blow in the face now; all that, too, had to end!
<P>
Suddenly I was filled with the thought of her and a great longing
for her.  What would she do when she realised our immense
disaster?  What would she do?  How would she take it?  It filled
me with astonishment to realise how little I could tell....
<P>
Should I perhaps presently happen upon her?
<P>
I went on through the plantations and out upon the downs, and
thence I saw Cothope with a new glider of his own design soaring
down wind to my old familiar "grounding" place.  To judge by its
long rhythm it was a very good glider.  "Like Cothope's cheek," 
thought I, "to go on with the research.  I wonder if he's keeping
notes....  But all this will have to stop."  
<P>
He was sincerely glad to see me.  "It's been a rum go," he said.
<P>
He had been there without wages for a month, a man forgotten in
the rush of events.
<P>
"I just stuck on and did what I could with the stuff. I got a bit
of money of my own--and I said to myself, 'Well, here you are
with the gear and no one to look after you.  You won't get such a
chance again, my boy, not in all your born days.  Why not make
what you can with it? '"
<P>
"How's Lord Roberts B?" 
<P>
Cothope lifted his eyebrows.  "I've had to refrain,"  he said. 
"But he's looking very handsome."  
<P>
"Gods!" I said, "I'd like to get him up just once before we
smash.  You read the papers?  You know we're going to smash?" 
<P>
"Oh! I read the papers.  It's scandalous, sir, such work as ours
should depend on things like that.  You and I ought to be under
the State, sir, if you'll excuse me"
<P>
"Nothing to excuse," I said.  "I've always been a Socialist--of a
sort--in theory.  Let's go and have a look at him.  How is he?
Deflated?" 
<P>
"Just about quarter full.  That last oil glaze of yours holds the
gas something beautiful.  He's not lost a cubic metre a week."...
<P>
Cothope returned to Socialism as we went toward the sheds.
<P>
"Glad to think you're a Socialist, sir," he said, "it's the only
civilised state.  I been a Socialist some years--off the
Clarion.  It's a rotten scramble, this world.  It takes the
things we make and invent and it plays the silly fool with 'em. 
We scientific people, we'll have to take things over and stop all
this financing and advertisement and that.  It's too silly. 
It's a noosance.  Look at us!" 
<P>
Lord Roberts B, even in his partially deflated condition in his
shed, was a fine thing to stare up at.  I stood side by side with
Cothope regarding him, and it was borne in upon me more acutely
than ever that all this had to end.  I had a feeling just like
the feeling of a boy who wants to do wrong, that I would use up
the stuff while I had it before the creditors descended. I had a
queer fancy, too, I remember, that if I could get into the air it
would advertise my return to Beatrice.
<P>
"We'll fill her," I said concisely.
<P>
"It's all ready," said Cothope, and added as an afterthought, 
"unless they cut off the gas."...
<P>
I worked and interested myself with Cothope all the morning and
for a time forgot my other troubles.  But the thought of Beatrice
flooded me slowly and steadily. It became an unintelligent sick
longing to see her.  I felt that I could not wait for the filling
of Lord Roberts B, that I must hunt her up and see her soon.  I
got everything forward and lunched with Cothope, and then with
the feeblest excuses left him in order to prowl down through the
woods towards Bedley Corner.  I became a prey to wretched
hesitations and diffidence.  Ought I to go near her now? I asked
myself, reviewing all the social abasements of my early years. 
At last, about five, I called at the Dower House.  I was greeted
by their Charlotte--with a forbidding eye and a cold
astonishment.
<P>
Both Beatrice and Lady Osprey were out.
<P>
There came into my head some prowling dream of meeting her.  I
went along the lane towards Woking, the lane down which we had
walked five months ago in the wind and rain.
<P>
I mooned for a time in our former footsteps, then swore and
turned back across the fields, and then conceived a distaste for
Cothope and went Downward. At last I found myself looking down on
the huge abandoned  masses of the Crest Hill house.
<P>
That gave my mind a twist into a new channel.  My uncle came
uppermost again.  What a strange, melancholy emptiness of
intention that stricken enterprise seemed in the even evening
sunlight, what vulgar  magnificence and crudity and utter
absurdity!  It was as idiotic as the pyramids.  I sat down on the
stile, staring at it as though I had never seen that forest of
scaffold poles, that waste of walls and bricks and plaster and
shaped stones, that wilderness of broken soil and wheeling 
tracks and dumps before.  It struck me suddenly as the compactest
image and sample of all that passes for Progress, of all the
advertisement-inflated spending,  the aimless building up and
pulling down, the enterprise  and promise of my age.  This was
our fruit, this was what he had done, I and my uncle, in the
fashion of our time.  We were its leaders and exponents, we were
the thing it most flourishingly produced.  For this futility in
its end, for an epoch of such futility, the solemn scroll of
history had unfolded....
<P>
"Great God!" I cried, "but is this Life?" 
<P>
For this the armies drilled, for this the Law was administered
and the prisons did their duty, for this the millions toiled and
perished in suffering, in order that a few of us should build
palaces we never finished, make billiard-rooms under ponds, run
imbecile walls round irrational estates, scorch about the world
in motor-cars, devise flying-machines, play golf and a dozen
such foolish games of ball, crowd into chattering dinner parties,
gamble and make our lives one vast, dismal spectacle of witless
waste! So it struck me then, and for a time I could think of no
other interpretation.  This was Life!  It came to me like a
revelation, a revelation at once incredible and indisputable of
the abysmal folly of our being.
<P>
III                      
<P>
I was roused from such thoughts by the sound of footsteps behind
me.
<P>
I turned half hopeful--so foolish is a lover's imagination,  and
stopped amazed.  It was my uncle.  His face was white--white as I
had seen it in my dream.
<P>
"Hullo!" I said, and stared.  "Why aren't you in London?" 
<P>
"It's all up," he said....
<P>
"Adjudicated?" 
<P>
"No!" 
<P>
I stared at him for a moment, and then got off the stile.
<P>
We stood swaying and then came forward with a weak motion of his
arms like a man who cannot see distinctly, and caught at and
leant upon the stile.  For a moment we were absolutely still.  He
made a clumsy gesture towards the great futility below and
choked.  I discovered that his face was wet with tears, that his
wet glasses blinded him.  He put up his little fat hand and
clawed them off clumsily, felt inefficiently for his
pocket-handkerchief, and then, to my horror, as he clung to me,
he began to weep aloud, this little, old worldworn  swindler.  It
wasn't just sobbing or shedding tears, it was crying as a child
cries.  It was oh! terrible!
<P>
"It's cruel," he blubbered at last.  "They asked me questions. 
They KEP' asking me questions, George."  
<P>
He sought for utterance, and spluttered.
<P>
"The Bloody bullies!" he shouted.  "The Bloody Bullies."  
<P>
He ceased to weep.  He became suddenly rapid and explanatory.
<P>
"It's not a fair game, George.  They tire you out.  And I'm not
well.  My stomach's all wrong.  And I been and got a cold.  I
always been li'ble to cold, and this one's on my chest.  And then
they tell you to speak up.  They bait you--and bait you, and bait
you.  It's torture.  The strain of it.  You can't remember what
you said.  You're bound to contradict yourself.  It's like
Russia, George.... It isn't fair play.... Prominent man.  I've
been next at dinners with that chap, Neal; I've told him
stories--and he's bitter!  Sets out to ruin me.  Don't ask a
civil question--bellows."  He broke down again.  "I've been
bellowed at, I been bullied, I been treated like a dog.  Dirty
cads they are!  Dirty cads!  I'd rather be a Three-Card Sharper
than a barrister; I'd rather sell cat's-meat in the streets.
<P>
"They sprung things on me this morning, things I didn't expect. 
They rushed me!  I'd got it all in my hands and then I was
jumped.  By Neal! Neal I've given city tips to! Neal! I've helped
Neal....
<P>
"I couldn't swallow a mouthful--not in the lunch hour.  I
couldn't face it.  It's true, George--I couldn't face it.  I said
I'd get a bit of air and slipped out and down to the Embankment,
and there I took a boat to Richmond.  Some idee.  I took a rowing
boat when I got there and I rowed about on the river for a bit. 
A lot of chaps and girls there was on the bank laughed at my
shirt-sleeves and top hat.  Dessay they thought it was a
pleasure trip.  Fat lot of pleasure!  I rowed round for a bit and
came in.  Then I came on here.  Windsor way.  And there they are
in London doing what they like with me.... I don't care!" 
<P>
"But" I said, looking down at him, perplexed.
<P>
"It's abscondin'.  They'll have a warrant."  
<P>
"I don't understand," I said.
<P>
"It's all up, George--all up and over.
<P>
"And I thought I'd live in that place, George and die a lord!
It's a great place, reely, an imperial--if anyone has the sense
to buy it and finish it.  That terrace--"
<P>
I stood thinking him over.
<P>
"Look here!" I said.  "What's that about--a warrant?  Are you
sure they'll get a warrant?  I'm sorry uncle; but what have you
done?" 
<P>
"Haven't I told you?"
    
"Yes, but they won't do very much to you for that.  They'll only
bring you up for the rest of your examination."
<P>
He remained silent for a time.  At last he spoke--speaking with
difficulty.
<P>
"It's worse than that.  I've done something.  They're bound to
get it out.  Practically they HAVE got it out."
<P>
"What?" 
<P>
"Writin' things down--I done something."  
<P>
For the first time in his life, I believe, he felt and looked
ashamed.  It filled me with remorse to see him suffer so.
<P>
"We've all done things," I said.  "It's part of the game the
world makes us play.  If they want to arrest you--and you've got
no cards in your hand--! They mustn't arrest you."  
<P>
"No.  That's partly why I went to Richmond.  But I never
thought--"
<P>
His little bloodshot eyes stared at Crest Hill.
<P>
"That chap Wittaker Wright," he said, "he had his stuff ready.  I
haven't.  Now you got it, George. That's the sort of hole I'm
in."
<P>
IV                        
<P>
That memory of my uncle at the gate is very clear and full.  I am
able to recall even the undertow of my thoughts while he was
speaking.  I remember my pity and affection for him in his misery
growing and stirring within me, my realisation that at any risk I
must help him.  But then comes indistinctness again.  I was
beginning to act.  I know I persuaded him to put himself in my
hands, and began at once to plan and do.  I think that when we
act most we remember least, that just in the measure that the
impulse of our impressions translates itself into schemes and
movements, it ceases to record itself in memories.  I know I
resolved to get him away at once, and to use the Lord Roberts B
in effecting that.  It was clear he was soon to be a hunted man,
and it seemed to me already unsafe for him to try the ordinary
Continental routes in his flight.  I had to evolve some scheme,
and evolve it rapidly, how we might drop most inconspicuously
into the world across the water.  My resolve to have one flight
at least in my airship fitted with this like hand to glove.  It
seemed to me we might be able to cross over the water in the
night, set our airship adrift, and turn up as pedestrian tourists
in Normandy or Brittany, and so get away.  That, at any rate, was
my ruling idea. 
<P>
I sent off Cothope with a dummy note to Woking, because I did
not want to implicate him, and took my uncle to the pavilion.   I
went down to my aunt, and made a clean breast of the situation. 
She became admirably competent.   We went into his dressing-room
and ruthlessly broke his locks.  I got a pair of brown boots, a
tweed suit and a cap of his, and indeed a plausible walking
outfit, and a little game bag for his pedestrian gear; and, in
addition, a big motoring overcoat and a supply of rugs to add to
those I had at the pavilion.  I also got a flask of brandy, and
she made sandwiches.  I don't remember any servants appearing,
and I forget where she got those sandwiches.  Meanwhile we
talked.  Afterwards I thought with what a sure confidence we
talked to each other
<P>
"What's he done?" she said.
<P>
"D'you mind knowing?" 
<P>
"No conscience left, thank God!"
<P>
"I think--forgery!" 
<P>
There was just a little pause.  "Can you carry this bundle?" she
asked.
<P>
I lifted it.
<P>
"No woman ever has respected the law--ever," she said.  "It's too
silly.... The things it lets you do!  And then pulls you up--like
a mad nurse minding a  child."  
<P>
She carried some rugs for me through the shrubbery in the
darkling.
<P>
"They'll think we're going mooning," she said, jerking  her head
at the household.  "I wonder what they make of us--criminals." 
... An immense droning note came as if in answer to that.  It
startled us both for a moment.  "The dears!" she said.  "It's the
gong for dinner!... But I wish I could help little Teddy,
George.  It's awful to think of him there with hot eyes, red and
dry.  And I know--the sight of me makes him feel sore.  Things I
said, George.  If I could have seen, I'd have let him have an
omnibusful of Scrymgeours.  I cut him up.  He'd never thought I
meant it before.... I'll help all I can, anyhow."
<P>
I turned at something in her voice, and got a moon light gleam of
tears upon her face.
<P>
"Could SHE have helped?" she asked abruptly.
<P>
"SHE?"
<P>
"That woman."  
<P>
"My God!" I cried, "HELPED! Those--things don't help!" 
<P>
"Tell me again what I ought to do," she said after a silence.
<P>
I went over the plans I had made for communicating, and the
things I thought she might do.  I had given her the address of a
solicitor she might put some trust in.
<P>
"But you must act for yourself," I insisted.
<P>
"Roughly," I said, "it's a scramble.  You must get what you can
for us, and follow as you can."  
<P>
She nodded.
<P>
She came right up to the pavilion and hovered for a time shyly,
and then went away.
<P>
I found my uncle in my sitting-room in an arm-chair, with his
feet upon the fender of the gas stove, which he had lit, and now
he was feebly drunken with my whisky, and very weary in body and
spirit, and inclined to be cowardly.
<P>
"I lef' my drops," he said.
<P>
He changed his clothes slowly and unwillingly.  I had to bully
him, I had almost to shove him to the airship and tuck him up
upon its wicker flat.  Single-handed I made but a clumsy start;
we scraped along the roof of the shed and bent a van of the
propeller, and for a time I hung underneath without his offering
a hand to help me to clamber up.  If it hadn't been for a sort of
anchoring trolley device of Cothope's, a sort of slip anchor
running on a rail, we should never have got clear at all.
<P>
V
                           
The incidents of our flight in Lord Roberts B do not arrange
themselves in any consecutive order.  To think of that adventure
is like dipping haphazard into an album of views.  One is
reminded first of this and then of that.  We were both lying down
on a horizontal plate of basketwork; for Lord Roberts B had none
of the elegant accommodation of a balloon.  I lay forward, and my
uncle behind me in such a position that he could see hardly
anything of our flight.  We were protected from rolling over
simply by netting between the steel stays.  It was impossible for
us to stand up at all; we had either to lie or crawl on all fours
over the basket work.  Amidships were lockers made of Watson's
Aulite material,--and between these it was that I had put my
uncle, wrapped in rugs.  I wore sealskin motoring boots and
gloves, and a motoring fur coat over my tweeds, and I controlled
the engine by Bowden wires and levers forward.                   
         
The early part of that night's experience was made up of warmth,
of moonlit Surrey and Sussex landscape, and of a rapid and
successful flight, ascending and swooping, and then ascending
again southward.  I could not watch the clouds because the
airship overhung me; I could not see the stars nor gauge the
meteorological happening, but it was fairly clear to me that a
wind shifting between north and northeast was gathering strength,
and after I had satisfied myself by a series of entirely
successful expansions and contractions of the real air-worthiness
of Lord Roberts B, I stopped the engine to save my petrol, and
let the monster drift, checking its progress by the dim landscape
below.  My uncle lay quite still behind me, saying little and
staring in front of him, and I was left to my own thoughts and
sensations.
<P>
My thoughts, whatever they were, have long since faded out of
memory, and my sensations have merged into one continuous memory
of an countryside lying, as it seemed, under snow, with square
patches of dimness, white phantoms of roads, rents and pools of
velvety blackness, and lamp-jewelled houses.  I remember a train
boring its way like a hastening caterpillar of fire across the
landscape, and how distinctly I heard its clatter.  Every town
and street was buttoned with street lamps.  I came quite close to
the South Downs near Lewes, and all the lights were out in the
houses, and the people gone to bed.  We left the land a little to
the east of Brighton, and by that time Brighton was well abed. 
and the brightly lit sea-front deserted.  Then I let out the gas
chamber to its fullest extent and rose.  I like to be high above
water.
<P>
I do not clearly know what happened in the night.  I think I must
have dozed, and probably my uncle slept. I remember that once or
twice I heard him talking in an eager, muffled voice to himself,
or to an imaginary court.  But there can be no doubt the wind
changed right round into the east, and that we were carried far
down the Channel without any suspicion of the immense leeway we
were making.  I remember the kind of stupid perplexity with which
I saw the dawn breaking over a grey waste of water, below, and
realised that something was wrong.  I was so stupid that it was
only after the sunrise I really noticed the trend of the foam
caps below, and perceived we were in a severe easterly gale. Even
then, instead of heading southeasterly, I set the engine going,
headed south, and so continued a course that must needs have
either just hit Ushant, or carry us over the Bay of Biscay.  I
thought I was east of Cherbourg,  when I was far to the west and
stopped my engine in that belief, and then set it going again.  I
did actually sight the coast of Brittany to the southeast in the
late afternoon, and that it was woke me up to the gravity of our
position.  I discovered it by accident in the southeast, when I
was looking for it in the southwest.   I turned about east and
faced the wind for some time, and finding I had no chance in its
teeth, went high, where it seemed less violent, and tried to make
a course southeast.  It was only then that I realised what a gale
I was in.  I had been going westward, and perhaps  even in gusts
north of west, at a pace of fifty or sixty miles an hour.
<P>
Then I began what I suppose would be called a Fight against the
east wind.  One calls it a Fight, but it was really almost as
unlike a fight as plain sewing. The wind tried to drive me
westwardly, and I tried to get as much as I could eastwardly,
with the wind beating  and rocking us irregularly, but by no
means unbearably, for about twelve hours.  My hope lay in the
wind abating, and our keeping in the air and eastward of
Finisterre until it did, and the chief danger was the exhaustion
of our petrol.  It was a long and anxious and almost meditative
time; we were fairly warm, and only slowly getting hungry, and
except that my uncle grumbled a little and produced some
philosophical reflections,  and began to fuss about having a
temperature, we talked very little.  I was tired and sulky, and
chiefly worried about the engine.  I had to resist a tendency to
crawl back and look at it.  I did not care to risk contracting 
our gas chamber for fear of losing gas.  Nothing  was less like a
fight.  I know that in popular magazines, and so forth, all such
occasions as this are depicted in terms of hysteria.  Captains
save their ships engineers complete their bridges, generals
conduct their battles, in a state of dancing excitement, foaming
recondite technicalities at the lips.  I suppose that sort of
thing works up the reader, but so far as it professes to
represent reality, I am convinced it is all childish nonsense.  
schoolboys of fifteen, girls of eighteen, and literary men all
their lives, may have these squealing fits, but my own experience
is that most exciting scenes are not exciting, and most of the
urgent moments in life are met by steady-headed men.
<P>
Neither I nor my uncle spent the night in ejaculations, nor in
humorous allusions, nor any of these things. We remained lumpish.
<P>
My uncle stuck in his place and grumbled about his stomach, and
occasionally rambled off into expositions of his financial
position and denunciations  of Neal--he certainly struck out one
or two good phrases for Neal--and I crawled about at rare
intervals in a vague sort of way and grunted, and our basketwork
creaked continually, and the wind on our quarter made a sort of
ruffled flapping in the wall of the gas chamber.  For all our
wraps we got frightfully cold as the night wore on.
<P>
I must have dozed, and it was still dark when I realised with a
start that we were nearly due south of, and a long way from, a
regularly-flashing lighthouse, standing out before the glow of
some great town, and then that the thing that had awakened me was
the cessation of our engine, and that we were driving back to the
west.
<P>
Then, indeed, for a time I felt the grim thrill of life.  I
crawled forward to the cords of the release valves, made my uncle
crawl forward too, and let out the gas until we were falling down
through the air like a clumsy glider towards the vague greyness
that was land.
<P>
Something must have intervened here that I have forgotten.  
<P>
I saw the lights of Bordeaux when it was quite dark, a nebulous
haze against black; of that I am reasonably sure.  But certainly
our fall took place in the cold, uncertain light of early dawn. 
I am, at least, equally sure of that.  And Mimizan, near where we
dropped, is fifty miles from Bordeaux, whose harbour lights I
must have seen.
<P>
I remember coming down at last with a curious indifference,  and
actually rousing myself to steer.  But the actual coming to earth
was exciting enough.  I remember our prolonged dragging landfall,
and the difficulty I had to get clear, and how a gust of wind
caught Lord Roberts B as my uncle stumbled away from the ropes
and litter, and dropped me heavily, and threw me on to my knees. 
Then came the realisation that the monster was almost consciously
disentangling itself for escape, and then the light leap of its
rebound.  The rope slipped out of reach of my hand.  I remember
running knee-deep in a salt pool in hopeless pursuit of the
airship.
<P>
As it dragged and rose seaward, and how only after it had escaped
my uttermost effort to recapture it, did I realise that this was
quite the best thing that could have happened.  It drove swiftly
over the sandy dunes, lifting and falling, and was hidden by a
clump of windbitten trees.  Then it reappeared much further off,
and still receding.  It soared for a time, and sank slowly, and
after that I saw it no more.  I suppose it fell into the sea and
got wetted with salt water and heavy, and so became deflated and
sank.
<P>
It was never found, and there was never a report of anyone seeing
it after it escaped from me.
<P>
VI       
<P>
But if I find it hard to tell the story of our long flight
through the air overseas, at least that dawn in France stands
cold and clear and full.  I see again almost as if I saw once
more with my bodily eyes the ridges of sand rising behind ridges
of sand, grey and cold and black-browed, with an insufficient
grass.  I feel again the clear, cold chill of dawn, and hear the
distant barking of a dog.  I find myself asking again, "What
shall we do now?" and trying to scheme with brain tired beyond
measure.
<P>
At first my uncle occupied my attention.  He was shivering a good
deal, and it was all I could do to resist my desire to get him
into a comfortable bed at once.  But I wanted to appear plausibly
in this part of the world.  I felt it would not do to turn up
anywhere at dawn and rest, it would be altogether too
conspicuous;  we must rest until the day was well advanced, and
then appear as road-stained pedestrians seeking a meal.  I gave
him most of what was left of the biscuits, emptied our flasks,
and advised him to sleep, but at first it was too cold, albeit I
wrapped the big fur rug around him.
<P>
I was struck now by the flushed weariness of his face, and the
look of age the grey stubble on his unshaved chin gave him.  He
sat crumpled up, shivering and coughing, munching reluctantly,
but drinking eagerly, and whimpering a little, a dreadfully
pitiful figure to me.  But we had to go through with it; there
was no way out for us.
<P>
Presently the sun rose over the pines, and the sand grew rapidly
warm.  My uncle had done eating, and sat with his wrists resting
on his knees, the most hopeless looking of lost souls.
<P>
"I'm ill," he said, "I'm damnably ill! I can feel it in my skin!"
<P>
Then--it was horrible to me--he cried, "I ought to be in bed; I
ought to be in bed... instead of flying about," and suddenly he
burst into tears.
<P>
I stood up.  "Go to sleep, man!" I said, and took the rug from
him, and spread it out and rolled him up in it.
<P>
"It's all very well," he protested; "I'm not young enough--"
<P>
"Lift up your head," I interrupted, and put his knapsack under
it.
<P>
"They'll catch us here, just as much as in an inn," he grumbled
and then lay still.
<P>
Presently, after a long time, I perceived he was asleep.  His
breath came with peculiar wheezings, and every now and again he
would cough.  I was very stiff and tired myself, and perhaps I
dozed.  I don't remember.  I remember only sitting, as it
seemed, nigh interminably, beside him, too weary even to think in
that sandy desolation.
<P>
No one came near us; no creature, not even a dog. I roused myself
at last, feeling that it was vain to seek to seem other than
abnormal, and with an effort that was like lifting a sky of lead,
we made our way through the wearisome sand to a farmhouse.  There
I feigned even a more insufficient French than I possess
naturally, and let it appear that we were pedestrians from
Biarritz  who had lost our way along the shore and got benighted.
<P>
This explained us pretty well, I thought, and we got most
heartening coffee and a cart to a little roadside  station.  My
uncle grew more and more manifestly ill with every stage of our
journey.  I got him to Bayonne, where he refused at first to eat,
and was afterwards  very sick, and then took him shivering and
collapsed  up a little branch line to a frontier place called
Luzon Gare.
<P>
We found one homely inn with two small bedrooms, kept by a kindly
Basque woman.  I got him to bed, and that night shared his room,
and after an hour or so of sleep he woke up in a raging fever and
with a wandering  mind, cursing Neal and repeating long,
inaccurate lists of figures.  He was manifestly a case for a
doctor, and in the morning we got one in.  He was a young man
from Montpelier, just beginning to practise, and very mysterious
and technical and modern and unhelpful.   He spoke of cold and
exposure, and la grippe and pneumonia.  He gave many explicit
and difficult directions.... I perceived it devolved upon me to
organise nursing and a sick-room.  I installed a religieuse
in the second bedroom of the inn, and took a room for myself in
the inn of Port de Luzon, a quarter of a mile away.
<P>
VII                        
<P>
And now my story converges on what, in that queer corner of
refuge out of the world, was destined to be my uncle's deathbed. 
There is a background of the Pyrenees, of blue hills and sunlit
houses, of the old castle of Luzon and a noisy cascading river,
and for a foreground the dim, stuffy room whose windows both the
religieuse and hostess conspired to shut, with its waxed floor,
its four-poster bed, its characteristically French chairs and
fireplace, its champagne bottles and dirty basins and used towels
and packets of Somatose on the table.  And in the sickly air of
the confined space in behind the curtains of the bed lay my
little uncle, with an effect of being enthroned and secluded, or
sat up, or writhed and tossed in his last dealings of life.  One
went and drew back the edge of the curtains if one wanted to
speak to him or look at him.
<P>
Usually he was propped up against pillows, because so he breathed
more easily.  He slept hardly at all.
<P>
I have a confused memory of vigils and mornings and afternoons
spent by that bedside, and how the religieuse hovered about me,
and how meek and good and inefficient she was, and how horribly
black were her nails.  Other figures come and go, and
particularly the doctor, a young man plumply rococo, in bicycling
dress, with fine waxen features, a little pointed beard, and the
long black frizzy hair and huge tie of a minor poet.  Bright and
clear-cut and irrelevant are memories of the Basque hostess of
my uncle's inn and of the family of Spanish people who
entertained me and prepared the most amazingly elaborate meals
for me, with soup and salad and chicken and remarkable sweets. 
They were all very kind and sympathetic people, systematically
so.  And constantly, without attracting attention, I was trying 
to get newspapers from home.
<P>
My uncle is central to all these impressions.
<P>
I have tried to make you picture him, time after time, as the
young man of the Wimblehurst chemist's shop, as the shabby
assistant in Tottenham Court Road, as the adventurer of the early
days of Tono-Bungay, as the confident, preposterous plutocrat. 
And now I have to tell of him strangely changed under the shadow
of oncoming death, with his skin lax and yellow and glistening 
with sweat, his eyes large and glassy, his countenance 
unfamiliar through the growth of a beard, his nose pinched and
thin.  Never had he looked so small as now.  And he talked to me
in a whispering, strained voice of great issues, of why his life
had been, and whither he was going.  Poor little man! that last
phase is, as it were, disconnected from all the other phases.  It
was as if he crawled out from the ruins of his career, and looked
about him before he died.  For he had quite clear-minded states
in the intervals of his delirium.
<P>
He knew he was almost certainly dying.  In a way that took the
burthen of his cares off his mind.  There was no more Neal to
face, no more flights or evasions, no punishments.
<P>
"It has been a great career, George," he said, "but I shall be
glad to rest.  Glad to rest!... Glad to rest."  
<P>
His mind ran rather upon his career, and usually, I am glad to
recall, with a note of satisfaction and approval.  In his
delirious phases he would most often exaggerate this
self-satisfaction, and talk of his splendours.  He would pluck
at the sheet and stare before him, and whisper half-audible
fragments of sentences.
<P>
"What is this great place, these cloud-capped towers, these any
pinnacles?... Ilion.  Sky-pointing.... Ilion House, the
residence of one of our great merchant princes.... Terrace above
terrace.  Reaching  to the heavens.... Kingdoms Caesar never
knew.... A great poet, George.  Zzzz.  Kingdoms Caesar never
knew....  Under entirely new management.  
<P>
"Greatness....Millions... Universities.... He stands on the
terrace--on the upper terrace--directing--directing--by the
globe--directing--the trade."  
<P>
It was hard at times to tell when his sane talk ceased and his
delirium began.  The secret springs of his life, the vain
imaginations were revealed.  I sometimes think that all the life
of man sprawls abed, careless and unkempt, until it must needs
clothe and wash itself and come forth seemly in act and speech
for the encounter with one's fellow-men.  I suspect that all
things unspoken in our souls partake somewhat of the laxity of
delirium and dementia.  Certainly from those slimy, tormented
lips above the bristling grey beard came nothing but dreams and
disconnected fancies....
<P>
Sometimes he raved about Neal, threatened Neal. "What has he got
invested?" he said.  "Does he think he can escape me?... If I
followed him up.... Ruin. Ruin.... One would think _I_ had taken
his money."  
<P>
And sometimes he reverted to our airship flight.  "It's too long,
George, too long and too cold.  I'm too old a man--too old--for
this sort of thing.... You know you're not saving--you're killing
me."  
<P>
Towards the end it became evident our identity was discovered.  I
found the press, and especially Boom's section of it, had made a
sort of hue and cry for us, sent special commissioners to hunt
for us, and though none of these emissaries reached us until my
uncle was dead, one felt the forewash of that storm of energy. 
The thing got into the popular French press.  People became 
curious in their manner towards us, and a number of fresh faces
appeared about the weak little struggle that went on in the
closeness behind the curtains of the bed.  The young doctor
insisted on consultations, and a motor-car came up from Biarritz,
and suddenly odd people with questioning eyes began to poke in
with inquiries and help.  Though nothing was said, I could feel
that we were no longer regarded as simple middle-class tourists;
about me, as I went, I perceived almost as though it trailed
visibly, the prestige of Finance and a criminal notoriety.  Local
personages of a plump and prosperous quality appeared in the inn
making inquiries, the Luzon priest became helpful, people watched
our window, and stared at me as I went to and fro; and then we
had a raid from a little English clergyman and his amiable,
capable wife in severely Anglican blacks, who swooped down upon
us like virtuous but resolute vultures from the adjacent village
of Saint Jean de Pollack.
<P>
The clergyman was one of those odd types that oscillate  between
remote country towns in England and the conduct of English Church
services on mutual terms in enterprising hotels abroad, a
tremulous, obstinate little being with sporadic hairs upon his
face, spectacles, a red button nose, and aged black raiment.  He
was evidently  enormously impressed by my uncle's monetary
greatness, and by his own inkling of our identity, and he shone
and brimmed over with tact and fussy helpfulness.  He was eager
to share the watching of the bedside with me, he proffered
services with both hands, and as I was now getting into touch
with affairs in London again, and trying to disentangle the
gigantic details of the smash from the papers I had succeeded in
getting from Biarritz, I accepted his offers pretty generously, 
and began the studies in modern finance that lay before me.  I
had got so out of touch with the old traditions of religion that
I overlooked the manifest possibility of his attacking my poor,
sinking vestiges of an uncle with theological solicitudes.  My
attention was called to that, however, very speedily by a polite
but urgent quarrel between himself and the Basque landlady as to
the necessity of her hanging a cheap crucifix in the shadow over
the bed, where it might catch my uncle's eye, where, indeed, I
found it had caught his eye.
<P>
"Good Lord!" I cried; "is THAT still going on!" 
<P>
That night the little clergyman watched, and in the small hours
he raised a false alarm that my uncle was dying, and made an
extraordinary fuss.  He raised the house.  I shall never forget
that scene, I think, which began with a tapping at my bedroom
door just after I had fallen asleep, and his voice--
<P>
"If you want to see your uncle before he goes, you must come
now."  
<P>
The stuffy little room was crowded when I reached it, and lit by
three flickering candles.  I felt I was back in the eighteenth
century.  There lay my poor uncle amidst indescribably tumbled
bedclothes, weary of life beyond measure, weary and rambling, and
the little clergyman trying to hold his hand and his attention,
and repeating over and over again:
<P>
"Mr. Ponderevo, Mr. Ponderevo, it is all right.  It is all right.
<P>
Only Believe! 'Believe on me, and ye shall be saved'!" 
<P>
Close at hand was the doctor with one of those cruel and idiotic
injection needles modern science puts in the hands of these
half-educated young men, keeping my uncle flickeringly alive for
no reason whatever.  The religieuse hovered sleepily in the
background with an overdue and neglected dose.  In addition, the
landlady had not only got up herself, but roused an aged crone of
a mother and a partially imbecile husband, and there was also a
fattish, stolid man in grey alpaca, with an air of
importance--who he was and how he got there, I don't know.  I
rather fancy the doctor explained him to me in French I did not
understand.  And they were all there, wearily nocturnal, hastily
and carelessly dressed, intent upon the life that flickered and
sank, making a public and curious show of its going, queer shapes
of human beings lit by three uncertain candles, and every soul of
them keenly and avidly resolved to be in at the death.  The
doctor stood, the others were all sitting on chairs the landlady
had brought in and arranged for them.
<P>
And my uncle spoilt the climax, and did not die.
<P>
I replaced the little clergyman on the chair by the bedside, and
he hovered about the room.
<P>
"I think," he whispered to me mysteriously, as he gave place to
me, "I believe--it is well with him."  
<P>
I heard him trying to render the stock phrases of Low Church
piety into French for the benefit of the stolid man in grey
alpaca.  Then he knocked a glass off the table, and scrabbled for
the fragments.  From the first I doubted the theory of an
immediate death.  I consulted the doctor in urgent whispers.  I
turned round to get champagne, and nearly fell over the
clergyman's legs.  He was on his knees at the additional chair
the Basque landlady had got on my arrival, and he was praying
aloud, "Oh, Heavenly Father, have mercy on this thy Child...."  I
hustled him up and out of the way, and in another minute he was
down at another chair praying again, and barring the path of the
religieuse, who had found me the corkscrew.  Something put into
my head that tremendous blasphemy of Carlyle's about "the last
mew of a drowning kitten."   He found a third chair vacant
presently; it was as if he was playing a game.
<P>
"Good Heavens!" I said, "we must clear these people out," and
with a certain urgency I did.
<P>
I had a temporary lapse of memory, and forgot all my French.  I
drove them out mainly by gesture, and opened the window, to the
universal horror.  I intimated the death scene was postponed,
and, as a matter of fact, my uncle did not die until the next
night.
<P>
I did not let the little clergyman come near him again, and I was
watchful for any sign that his mind had been troubled.  But he
made none.  He talked once about "that parson chap."  
<P>
"Didn't bother you?" I asked.    
<P>
"Wanted something," he said.
<P>
I kept silence, listening keenly to his mutterings.  I
understood him to say, "They wanted too much."  His face puckered
like a child's going to cry.  "You can't get a safe six
per cent.," he said.  I had for a moment a wild suspicion that
those urgent talks had not been altogether spiritual, but that, I
think, was a quite unworthy  and unjust suspicion.  The little
clergyman was as simple and honest as the day.  My uncle was
simply generalising about his class.
<P>
But it may have been these talks that set loose some long dormant
string of ideas in my uncle's brain, ideas the things of this
world had long suppressed and hidden altogether.  Near the end he
suddenly became clearminded and lucid, albeit very weak, and his
voice was little, but clear.
<P>
"George," he said.
<P>
"I'm here," I said, "close beside you."  
<P>
"George.  You have always been responsible for the science. 
George.  You know better than I do.  Is--Is it proved?" 
<P>
"What proved?" 
<P>
"Either way?" 
<P>
"I don't understand."  
<P>
"Death ends all.  After so much--Such splendid beginnin's.
Somewhere.  Something."  
<P>
I stared at him amazed.  His sunken eyes were very grave.
<P>
"What do you expect?" I said in wonder.
<P>
He would not answer.  "Aspirations," he whispered.  He fell into
a broken monologue, regardless of me. "Trailing clouds of glory,"
he said, and "first-rate poet, first-rate....George was always
hard.  Always."  
<P>
For a long time there was silence.
<P>
Then he made a gesture that he wished to speak.
<P>
"Seems to me, George"
<P>
I bent my head down, and he tried to lift his hand to my
shoulder.  I raised him a little on his pillows, and listened.
<P>
"It seems to me, George, always--there must be something in
me--that won't die."  
<P>
He looked at me as though the decision rested with me.
<P>
"I think," he said; "--something."  
<P>
Then, for a moment, his mind wandered.  "Just a little link," he
whispered almost pleadingly, and lay quite still, but presently
he was uneasy again.
<P>
"Some other world"
<P>
"Perhaps," I said.  "Who knows?" 
<P>
"Some other world."  
<P>
"Not the same scope for enterprise," I said.  
<P>
"No."  
<P>
He became silent.  I sat leaning down to him, and following out
my own thoughts, and presently the religieuse resumed her
periodic conflict with the window fastening.  For a time he
struggled for breath.... It seemed such nonsense that he should
have to suffer so--poor silly little man!
<P>
"George," he whispered, and his weak little hand came out. 
"PERHAPS--"
<P>
He said no more, but I perceived from the expression of his eyes
that he thought the question had been put.
<P>
"Yes, I think so;" I said stoutly.
<P>
"Aren't you sure?" 
<P>
"Oh--practically sure," said I, and I think he tried to squeeze
my hand.  And there I sat, holding his hand tight, and trying to
think what seeds of immortality could be found in all his being,
what sort of ghost there was in him to wander out into the bleak
immensities.  Queer fancies came to me.... He lay still for a
long time, save for a brief struggle or so for breath and ever
and again I wiped his mouth and lips.
<P>
I fell into a pit of thought.  I did not remark at first the
change that was creeping over his face.  He lay back on his
pillow, made a faint zzzing sound that ceased, and presently and
quite quietly he died--greatly comforted by my assurance.  I do
not know when he died.  His hand relaxed insensibly.  Suddenly,
with a start, with a shock, I found that his mouth had fallen
open, and that he was dead....
<P>
VIII                          
<P>
It was dark night when I left his deathbed and went back to my
own inn down the straggling street of Luzon.
<P>
That return to my inn sticks in my memory also as a thing apart,
as an experience apart.  Within was a subdued bustle of women, a
flitting of lights, and the doing of petty offices to that queer,
exhausted thing that had once been my active and urgent little
uncle.  For me those offices were irksome and impertinent.  I
slammed the door, and went out into the warm, foggy drizzle of
the village street lit by blurred specks of light in great voids
of darkness, and never a soul abroad.  That warm veil of fog
produced an effect of vast seclusion.  The very houses by the
roadside peered through it as if from another world.  The
stillness of the night was marked by an occasional remote baying
of dogs; all these people kept dogs because of the near
neighbourhood of the frontier.
<P>
Death!
<P>
It was one of those rare seasons of relief, when for a little
time one walks a little outside of and beside life.  I felt as I
sometimes feel after the end of a play.  I saw the whole business
of my uncle's life as something familiar and completed.  It was
done, like a play one leaves, like a book one closes.  I thought
of the push and the promotions, the noise of London, the crowded,
various company of people through which our lives had gone, the
public meetings, the excitements, the dinners and disputations,
and suddenly it appeared to me that none of these things existed.
<P>
It came to me like a discovery that none of these things existed.
<P>
Before and after I have thought and called life a phantasmagoria,
but never have I felt its truth as I did that night.... We had
parted; we two who had kept company so long had parted.  But
there was, I knew, no end to him or me.  He had died a dream
death, and ended a dream; his pain dream was over.  It seemed to
me almost as though I had died, too.  What did it matter, since
it was unreality, all of it, the pain and desire, the beginning 
and the end?  There was no reality except this solitary road,
this quite solitary road, along which one went rather puzzled,
rather tired....
<P>
Part of the fog became a big mastiff that came towards me and
stopped and slunk round me, growling, barked gruffly, and shortly
and presently became fog again.
<P>
My mind swayed back to the ancient beliefs and fears of our race.
<P>
My doubts and disbeliefs slipped from me like a loosely fitting
garment.  I wondered quite simply what dogs bayed about the path
of that other walker in the darkness, what shapes, what lights,
it might be, loomed about him as he went his way from our last
encounter on earth--along the paths that are real, and the way
that endures for ever?
<P>
IX
<P>
Last belated figure in that grouping round my uncle's deathbed
is my aunt.  When it was beyond all hope that my uncle could live
I threw aside whatever concealment remained to us and telegraphed
directly to her.  But she came too late to see him living.  She
saw him calm and still, strangely unlike his habitual garrulous
animation, an unfamiliar inflexibility.
<P>
"It isn't like him," she whispered, awed by this alien dignity.
<P>
I remember her chiefly as she talked and wept upon the bridge
below the old castle.  We had got rid of some amateurish
reporters from Biarritz, and had walked together in the hot
morning sunshine down through Port Luzon.  There, for a time, we
stood leaning on the parapet of the bridge and surveying the
distant peeks, the rich blue masses of the Pyrenees.  For a long
time we said nothing, and then she began talking.
<P>
"Life's a rum Go, George!" she began.  "Who would have thought,
when I used to darn your stockings at old Wimblehurst, that this
would be the end of the story?  It seems far away now--that
little shop, his and my first home.  The glow of the bottles, the
big coloured bottles! Do you remember how the light shone on the
mahogany drawers? The little gilt letters! Ol Amjig, and
Snap! I can remember it all--bright and shining--like a Dutch
picture.  Real!  And yesterday.  And here we are in a dream.  You
a man--and me an old woman, George.  And poor little Teddy, who
used to rush about and talk--making that noise he did--Oh!" 
<P>
She choked, and the tears flowed unrestrained.  She wept, and I
was glad to see her weeping.
<P>
She stood leaning over the bridge; her tear-wet handkerchief 
gripped in her clenched hand.
<P>
"Just an hour in the old shop again--and him talking.  Before
things got done.  Before they got hold of him. And fooled him.
<P>
"Men oughtn't to be so tempted with business and things....
<P>
"They didn't hurt him, George?" she asked suddenly.
<P>
For a moment I was puzzled.
<P>
"Here, I mean," she said.
<P>
"No," I lied stoutly, suppressing the memory of that foolish
injection needle I had caught the young doctor using.
<P>
"I wonder, George, if they'll let him talk in Heaven...."
<P>
She faced me.  "Oh! George, dear, my heart aches, and I don't
know what I say and do.  Give me your arm to lean on--it's good
to have you, dear, and lean upon you.... Yes, I know you care
for me.  That's why I'm talking.  We've always loved one another,
and never said anything about it, and you understand, and I
understand.  But my heart's torn to pieces by this, torn to rags,
and things drop out I've kept in it.  It's true he wasn't a
husband much for me at the last.  But he was my child, George, he
was my child and all my children, my silly child, and life has
knocked him about for me, and I've never had a say in the matter;
never a say; it's puffed him up and smashed him--like an old
bag--under my eyes.  I was clever enough to see it, and not
clever enough to prevent it, and all I could do was to jeer. 
I've had to make what I could of it.  Like most people.  Like
most of us.... But it wasn't fair, George.  It wasn't fair.  Life
and Death--great serious things--why couldn't they leave him
alone, and his lies and ways?  If WE could see the lightness of
it--
<P>
"Why couldn't they leave him alone?" she repeated in a whisper as
we went towards the inn.
