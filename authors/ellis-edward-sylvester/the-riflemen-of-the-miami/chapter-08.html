<p>For a few minutes, the Rifleman ran "like a whirlwind," supporting
entirely the weight of Edith, for none knew better than he the
imminent peril that menaced both. The wood was quite open, so
that his way was not much impeded, and he went at a terrific rate,
well aware that all depended upon gaining an advantage over the
Indians at the start.</p>

<p>He had gone but a short distance, when he became convinced that
his only danger was from falling into the hands of his pursuers,
as it was their sole object to make him and Edith prisoners; as
a consequence, there was no danger from being fired at by them.
When he deemed it prudent, he released his hold upon her, and
she, half running and being half carried, flew over the ground
at a rate as astonishing to herself as it was to her pursuers.
The latter kept up a series of yells and outcries, amid which
the discordant screeches of Zeke Hunt, now Simon Girty, the renegade,
could be plainly distinguished. Several furtive glances over the
shoulder gave him glimpses of some eight or ten savages in pursuit,
the renegade being among the foremost.</p>

<p>As Dernor was thus hurrying forward, he recalled that, less than
half a mile distant, the woods were broken and cut up by ravines
and hills, as though an earthquake had passed through that section;
and, believing that this would afford him a better opportunity
of eluding his foes, he turned in that direction and strained
every nerve to reach it. As for Edith herself, she seemed fired
with supernatural strength, and sped with a swiftness of which
she never dreamed herself capable. Seeing this, the Rifleman attempted
to draw the charge out of his gun and reload it. It was a work
of great difficulty to do this while running, but he succeeded
in accomplishing it at last.</p>

<p>Constantly glancing behind him, in order to see his chance, he
suddenly whirled and fired with the rapidity of thought. Without
pausing to reload, he again placed his arm around Edith, and dashed
forward almost at the top of his speed.</p>

<p>Finding that the Indians, if gaining at all, were gaining very
slowly upon him, he half concluded that it was their intention
to run his companion down, well knowing that, although he was
fully competent both in speed and in bottom to contest with them,
it could not be expected that she could continue the rate at which
she was going, for any length of time.</p>

<p>"Ain't you tired?" he asked, hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Not much; I can run a great deal further," she replied, in the
same hurried manner.</p>

<p>"Keep your spirits up; we'll soon have different ground to travel
over."</p>

<p>Almost as he spoke, they came to the edge of a sort of ravine,
too broad for either to leap, and too precipitous to admit of
an immediate descent by either. Still retaining his hold upon
her, Dernor ran rapidly along the edge, until reaching a favorable
spot, he lifted her bodily from the ground, and bounded down to
a rock over a dozen feet below, and then leaped from this to the
bottom of the ravine, Edith sustaining no more of a shock than
if she had been a feather.</p>

<p>Being now in the bottom of the ravine, where the ground was comparatively
even, the hunter placed the girl once more upon her feet, and
side by side they continued their flight from their merciless
pursuers. Their loud, exultant yells continued reverberating through
the woods, and glancing upward, Dernor saw the form of a huge
Indian suddenly come to view, on the edge of the ravine, some
distance ahead of him, and make some menacing motion toward him.
As the ravine at this point was a sheer precipice, the hunter
did not believe he would attempt to descend it, and feeling there
was no danger of being fired upon, he kept steadily onward.</p>

<p>But he was mistaken. Before he was opposite the savage, he came
sliding and tumbling down the ravine, as though some one had pushed
him from behind. However that may have been, he alighted on his
feet without injury, and made directly toward the fugitives, with
the manifest intention of checking their flight.</p>

<p>Lewis Dernor saw that a collision with the Indian was unavoidable,
and without the least hesitation prepared himself for it. The
savage was a Miami&mdash;a brawny, muscular warrior, fully six feet
in height, of matchless symmetry and formidable strength. When
the combatants were perhaps a dozen yards apart, he raised his
tomahawk over his head, and poising it a moment, hurled it, with
a most deadly force, full at the head of the hunter. The latter
had not expected such a demonstration as this, but had detected
it in time to avoid it. He dropped his head the instant the weapon
left the savage's hand, and it whizzed over him, going end over
end, until it struck the solid rock, where the terrible force
of the concussion shivered it to atoms. Seeing this, the Miami
whipped out his knife and stood on the defensive.</p>

<p>"Now, my good friend," muttered Dernor, between his clenched
teeth, "it is <em>my</em> turn."</p>

<p>He handed his rifle to Edith&mdash;who had paused, now that they were
so close to their enemy&mdash;and, drawing his own knife, made a sort
of running bound, coming upon the Indian with a panther-like spring,
that nearly drove him backward off his feet. There was a clashing
of knives, the scintillation of steel against steel, the deadly
embrace, and hand-to-hand struggle; and, as the Rifleman recoiled
clear of his fallen adversary, he reached out to Edith for his
rifle.</p>

<p>"Come on," said he, in his ordinary voice; "I guess the way is
clear."</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I am afraid," faltered Edith, "that I can not run much
further."</p>

<p>"There ain't any need of it," said the hunter. "Lean on me, and
we'll walk awhile, if there's a thousand tearing Injins after
us."</p>

<p>Edith panted and trembled violently from the exhausting efforts
she had been compelled to make, while the mortal terror she felt
at the Miamis, made her nearly wild with excitement. Their chilling
yells, so different from any thing ever heard among civilized
beings, would have crazed almost any person, but Dernor listened
to them with as much composure as he would to the songs of so
many birds.</p>

<p>He became aware, shortly after, from the direction of these sounds,
that the Indians had entered the ravine, and were now coming along
again, at the top of their speed. He paused a moment, to determine
precisely the distance of these, and then looked into the gloomy,
terror-stricken face of Edith.</p>

<p>"I have rested," said he, "and if we don't get over ground faster
than this, them red-skins will have us both, in less than ten
minutes. Let me carry you."</p>

<p>She made no resistance, for she was barely able to stand, and
supporting her in such a manner that her feet hardly touched ground,
Dernor once more threw all of his astonishing energy into the
flight. Fully a quarter of a mile he ran directly through the
ravine, and then, reaching a point that would admit of it, he
made a running leap, and came up out of it, like a diver emerging
from the sea.</p>

<p>He was now in the woods again, after having gained a considerable
advantage over his pursuers; but the Indians behind him were still
uncomfortably close, and he could not hope that all would pass
the point where he had left the ravine, without discovering the
signs he had left there of his flight. Knowing this, he was aware
that the golden moment was the present. The Miamis&mdash;to whom most
of the pursuers belonged&mdash;were "thrown off the scent" for the
time. After having gone a considerable distance, and having satisfied
himself that they had not yet regained it, Dernor determined to
take advantage of this to give Edith a portion of the rest she
needed so much.</p>

<p>"I am not used to running like this," said she, leaning heavily
on him, "and I am afraid I can not bear it."</p>

<p>"I ought to be shot and scalped, for making you take this journey,"
said Dernor.</p>

<p>"Why, you did it for the best," she added, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought so&mdash;perhaps, the best for myself. I had no idea
of being pursued in this manner. It seems I have been a fool.
I let that Simon Girty make me believe he was an awkward countryman,
and lead me into this muss."</p>

<p>"You think we can keep out of their hands?"</p>

<p>"I trust so; the night ain't many hours away, and if we can only
keep clear till then, why, all right. I hain't seen the Injin
yet, Miami or Shawnee, that could foller a track in the night-time."</p>

<p>"They did not see us come out of the ravine. How will they know
enough of our direction to keep up the pursuit?"</p>

<p>"Injin is Injin, and the dirt I made in scratching out of there
will be seen by a dozen of their snaky eyes."</p>

<p>"How far, dear friend, did you say it is to the settlement?"</p>

<p>"Full twenty miles."</p>

<p>"We can reach it, then, by traveling all night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very easy, if you can hold out till the darkness comes
on."</p>

<p>"I hope I can, but I am so terribly worn out that I must go very
slowly. You said it was the best for <em>you</em> that we should
undertake this journey alone, through the woods. What did you
mean by saying that?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you some other time," replied the hunter, in great
embarrassment. "I done so that I might be <em>alone with you</em>."</p>

<p>Edith looked earnestly at him, as though she would read his very
soul. She was about to speak, when the appalling yells of the
human bloodhounds sounded so fearfully near, that her very blood
seemed to curdle in her veins.</p>

<p>"Where shall we fly?" she asked, looking up imploringly in the
face of the hunter.</p>

<p>"Come on as rapidly as you can," he replied, again supporting
her.</p>

<p>Great as were the apprehension and terror of Edith, she could
but notice the singular conduct of her companion. He kept constantly
looking around, not as though he expected danger, but as if searching
for something. The cause of this was soon manifest.</p>

<p>"Edith," said he, "it will be full two hours afore there'll be
enough darkness to do us any good. Can you stand it till then?"</p>

<p>"I can <em>stand</em> it," she answered, with a sad laugh, "but
I can not <em>run</em> it."</p>

<p>"We must either run or be took. Now, <em>my dearest</em> <em>one</em>,
you've done enough to kill a dozen common women, and you shouldn't
try to do more, and I don't intend to let you."</p>

<p>"But how can&#11834; Oh, Heavenly Father! hear those shouts&mdash;but
how can you prevent it?"</p>

<p>"I must leave you behind."</p>

<p>Edith's eyes dilated with horror, now doubly intensified.</p>

<p>"Don't think for a minute," the hunter hastened to say, "that
I intend to desart you. No, no; may the lightning strike me down
if I could ever do such a thing. What I mean is, that I must hide
you till night, when I'll come back, and we'll go on, taking things
comfortably."</p>

<p>"It must be done quickly. Don't wait a minute."</p>

<p>The Rifleman led the way to some thick, dense bushes and without
approaching them very closely, signified her to enter them. She
did so, with considerable difficulty, and when she had entered
and covered away, he could see nothing of her.</p>

<p>"Stay there till I come," said he, "and be careful and not put
your head out, if you hear any noise."</p>

<p>"How shall I know whether it is you or not?"</p>

<p>"I'll be around as soon as it is dark enough, and will speak.
Don't forget what I said. Don't let any noise make you show yourself.
Good-by."</p>

<p>"Good-by;" and the hunter turned to attend to his own safety.</p>
