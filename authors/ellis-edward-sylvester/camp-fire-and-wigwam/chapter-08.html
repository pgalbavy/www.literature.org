<p>Jacob Relstaub was so accustomed to the undisturbed abuse of
his son that he was struck almost speechless by the calm defiance
of the Indian youth. When he saw the latter place his hand on
the knife at his girdle, the German could not fail to know its
meaning. He stopped short with his cane half raised and glared
savagely at Deerfoot.</p>

<p>"You means to kills me, eh, don't it? Yaw,&mdash;I sees, &mdash;I
sees!"</p>

<p>And shaking his head very fast, and muttering some vigorous words
in his own language, he stamped towards the door, swung it open
and passed out in the darkness. Deerfoot stood motionless, looking
in the direction whence he had vanished, and then, without a word,
sat down on the rude chair and looked toward Mrs. Carleton, seated
as she was near the fire.</p>

<p>The good lady was terrified, but the incident was so brief that
it was over before she fairly understood its full meaning and
the ill-natured caller was gone.</p>

<p>"He is such a bad-tempered man that I'm afraid he will hurt you
for this," said she, stepping hastily to the door, where she drew
in the latch-string, thus locking the humble cabin against intruders.
When she sat down, with her scared look and her words of misgiving
on her lips, Deerfoot looked from the crackling fire into her
countenance. As the yellow glow lit up his handsome features,
they showed the faintest possible smile, which vanished the same
moment it appeared. The matchless redskin must have appreciated
the grim humor involved in the thought of his feeling any fear
of the curmudgeon who had just gone.</p>

<p>Previous to that the young Shawanoe had glanced around the cabin,
and like another Houdin, impressed every point in his memory.
He noted the narrow windows through which a hostile shot could
be fired from the outside. He did not believe the late visitor
would proceed to that length, but he shifted his seat to a point
several feet away, where, if Relstaub relied on his previous knowledge
for his aim, no possible harm could be done.</p>

<p>Deerfoot made his change in such a quiet fashion, that his hostess
had not the slightest suspicion of its meaning. She saw that he
had simply moved closer to the fire. The space between her own
chair and that of the visitor was such that there was no call
for her to change her location: had there been the slightest,
Deerfoot would not have permitted her to wait.</p>

<p>"My brother will hurt no one," said he in his quiet fashion:
"he is a bad man; he has a good boy, Otto; Deerfoot calls him
his brother, and will do much for him; but Deerfoot does not like
his father."</p>

<p>"I was <em>so</em> afraid he would strike you with his cane,"
said the lady, still trembling over the remembrance, "and then
you would have used your knife."</p>

<p>The smile was more pronounced than before, but the words were
scarcely audible.</p>

<p>"He could not hurt Deerfoot and Deerfoot would not hurt him."</p>

<p>The lady fully understood his meaning, and it lifted a great
fear from her heart that Jacob Relstaub would return, demand admittance,
and attack her guest. True, he might do so, but she saw that in
such an event the results would be farcical rather than tragical.</p>

<p>Deerfoot did not care to give any further thought to the despicable
man. He had come to the settlement to visit Jack Carleton and
Otto Relstaub, and found they were absent on a singular hunt for
the horse that had been missing fully a week. His interest lay
in them, and especially in Jack. He had heard most of the facts
from the mother, but he now questioned her further in his gentle
way until not a particle of information was left for her to give.</p>

<p>The substance of that information has already been told the reader,&mdash;it
being nothing more than the statement of their departure early
that morning. The startling events which followed could not be
suspected by the parent, who sat so quietly knitting and talking
with the remarkable Indian youth on the other side of her hearthstone,
as ignorant as she of the alarming situation in which both were
placed.</p>

<p>But while so quiet in his demeanor, the wonderful brain of the
youth was always busy during his waking hours. He could not feel
that there was cause for fear on account of his friends, for,
as has already been shown, that portion of the enormous territory
of Louisiana was peopled by Indians much less vicious in their
hatred than were those who made Kentucky their hunting-ground.
A fierce party of Shawanoes had followed the little party across
the Mississippi the previous week, and they kept matters moving
in a very lively manner, as the reader learned long ago; but it
was not to be supposed that any of those daring and skillful warriors
were in the neighborhood, for it was not conceivable that a cause
existed for their presence.</p>

<p>But a singular distrust took possession of Deerfoot. He could
not account for it, except as he accounted for all inexplainable
things, as being the direct prompting of the Great Spirit. Many
a time the instinctive belief had come over him, and he had never
failed to follow its guidance; the result in each instance proved
that he did right, and he resolved to do the same in the present
case, though it will be seen that he could take no real step forward
until the coming of daylight.</p>

<p>"You will stay here until morning," said Mrs. Carleton, looking
into the face of her visitor and speaking as though the matter
was not at all in the nature of a question.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot may stay awhile, though he would rather sleep in the
woods, where he can breathe the cool, pure air, and look at the
stars, and listen to the whispers of the Great Spirit who watches
over him when he is asleep or awake."</p>

<p>"You can sleep on Jack's bed, and he will be pleased, when he
comes home, to learn that you did so, though he will be sorry
that he was not here to make you welcome."</p>

<p>The Indian shook his head. He had no wish to lie on any such
couch, and he had not done so since he was wounded and a prisoner
in the hands of the white people.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot will sit here and read until he becomes weary; then
he will lie on the floor; and when he awakes he will seek his
brothers who are hunting for the horse that has long been lost."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carleton had been told by Jack how skillfully Deerfoot could
read and write, and she now ventured the hope that he would use
the Bible which lay on the table at the side of the cabin. She
was on the point of rising to get it for him, when he motioned
her to keep her seat.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot has his Bible with him."</p>

<p>And then he drew the tiny volume with its wooden covers from
the interior pocket of his hunting-shirt, and shifted his position
so that his back was turned toward the fire, whose glow passed
over his shoulders and fell upon the printed page. This gave him
all the light he needed, and, after rustling the leaves for a
moment, he began, in his low, sweet monotone.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, he selected one of the chapters from Revelation,
overflowing as it does with the most impressive grandeur and awe-inspiring
glimpse of the mysterious life from whose portals no human being
has ever turned back to whisper to the vast procession waiting
to follow in his footsteps.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carleton saw that Deerfoot did not like her words of compliment
and she therefore refrained. When he had finished, he closed the
book and laid it away where he always carried it, and then the
conversation went on in the same vein as before.</p>

<p>But the hour was later than that to which the good lady was accustomed,
and, despite the singular interest of the interview, she began
to feel a slight drowsiness. When she placed her hand over her
mouth and yawned, Deerfoot asked that she should retire. She consented,
and bade him good-night and withdrew.</p>

<p>He sat motionless until he was alone, when he once more drew
out his Bible and resumed reading. The fire having smoldered,
he stirred the sticks, turning the unburned ends among the coals,
so that in a few moments the small room was filled with a brighter
illumination than before. Leaning backward with the book in front
of his face and his shapely legs extended in front, he studied
with an interest more absorbing than was ever felt by the most
devout novel reader. He seemed to lose all consciousness of time
and place, and pored over the volume which to him was more precious
than any treasure it is possible for the mind to conceive.</p>

<p>By-and-by the fire burned low again and the light grew dim. Though
the youth might have continued the perusal much longer, he finally
ceased and put the book away for the night. Then, folding his
arms, he looked into the smoldering embers before him. Every one
knows how such a scene feeds the fancy and how imagination will
run riot, while sitting alone late at night, with the wind moaning
outside, while he watches the curious, grotesque, and endless
procession of figures which take shape and action before him.
No one but Deerfoot himself could tell what thoughts took shape
in his brain, but they must have been of a melancholy, serious
nature, for he drew a deep sigh, muttered a few words in prayer,
and then deliberately lay down in the middle of the floor. He
lay on his side, with his arm doubled under his head for a pillow,
but had nothing but the hard planking beneath and nothing except
his own clothing above.</p>

<p>Deerfoot required little sleep, and within less than two hours
after he had lain down, he opened his eyes and assumed the sitting
position. The fire had burned so low that only a slight glow filled
a part of the room, and he looked like some odd shadow, when he
stepped silently forward and stirred the embers until they once
more lit up the apartment. It was not yet morning, but he had
concluded to wait no longer. He therefore picked up his bow and
then, without making the least noise, opened and closed the door
behind him.</p>

<p>The young Shawanoe stood for a moment when he found himself in
the clear air on the outside. It was a bright starlit night, and,
when he glanced reverently upward at the thousands of blazing
orbs, he saw that it still lacked two hours of daylight. The rude
cabins were dimly outlined, as they faced each other in two irregular
rows, those only which were the furthest away being invisible.
All were dark and silent excepting one. He noticed the gleam of
light from the window, and thought it likely that some one was
watching by the bed of sickness; but the thought had hardly come
to him when he recalled that it was the cabin of the German Relstaub,
who had left him in such a rage.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was still in front of the house of his friend, when
the door of the cabin opened and the short, sturdy figure of Jacob
Relstaub was outlined against the blazing fire and candle-light
behind him. The truth was, he was so angered he could not sleep;
he had tossed about until his rage became ungovernable, when he
told his frau that he was going over to the widow Carleton's to
chastise the rascally redskin that had dared to insult him to
his face. The wife sought to dissuade him, but he was too angered
to listen to reason; and, ordering her to stay in bed, he dressed,
caught up his heavy cane, and plunged from the door of his home.</p>

<p>Deerfoot drew back until sure he could not be seen, when he calmly
awaited the approach of the irate man. The latter stamped forward,
banging his heavy cane on the ground and muttering to himself:</p>

<p>"Yaw, I preaks mine cane his head ofer&mdash;he talks to me&mdash;he calls
me a rascal und eferydings vot I vas. I shows him&#11834;"</p>

<p>Just then, when he was close to the cabin, a figure emerged from
the darkness, moving as silently as if it was a section of the
gloom itself, and advancing straight toward him. It was the execrated
young Indian, grasping his long bow in his right hand, and holding
his tomahawk in his left, with his body bent and his head thrust
forward.</p>

<p>"Oh, mine gracious!" gasped Jacob Relstaub, his knees shaking
and his staff dropping from his trembling hand, "it ish him!"</p>

<p>He managed to twist his body around, so as to face the other
way, and then he broke into a lumbering run for his cabin. He
heard the sound of the swift moccasins behind him, and he ran
as never before. His hat flew off, and odd quirps and pains developed
themselves here and there in his frame, because of the unusual
and violent exercise to which he subjected himself; but he kept
forward, believing it was his only hope. Fortunately the run was
brief, but when he reached the threshold he was in the last stage
of exhaustion. He could not lift his foot high enough, and went
sprawling headlong into the room, with a crash that startled his
wife almost out of her senses.</p>

<p>Deerfoot paused a moment surveying the wreck and ruin he had
caused, and then quietly shoved his tomahawk back in place. He
had accomplished all he wished, and was satisfied. His old shadowy
smile lingered on his face as he turned aside, and, making his
way between the settlers' cabins, disappeared in the woods.</p>
