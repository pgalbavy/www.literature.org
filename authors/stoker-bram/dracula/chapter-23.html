DR. SEWARD'S DIARY
<P>
     3 October.--The time seemed teribly long whilst we were
waiting for the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris.  The
Professor  tried  to keep our minds active by using them all
the time.  I  could see  his beneficent purpose, by the side
glances which he  threw from time  to  time  at Harker.  The
poor fellow is overwhelmed in  a misery that is appalling to
see.  Last night  he  was  a  frank, happy-looking man, with
strong,  youthful face, full of  energy, and with dark brown
hair.  Today  he  is  a  drawn, haggard old man, whose white
hair  matches well  with the  hollow burning eyes and griefwritten lines of his face.  His  energy is still intact.  In
fact,  he  is like a living flame.  This may yet be his salvation, for if all  go  well, it will tide him over the despairing period.  He will then, in  a kind of way, wake again
to  the realities  o f life.  Poor fellow,  I thought my own
trouble was bad enough, but his . . .!
<P>
     The Professor knows  this well enough, and is doing his
best to keep his mind active.  What he  has been saying was,
under the circumstances, of absorbing interest.  So  well as
I can remember, here it is:
<P>
     "I have studied,  over  and  over again since they came
into my hands, all the papers relating to  this monster, and
the more I have studied, the greater  seems the necessity to
utterly stamp him out.  All through there  are  signs of his
advance.  Not only of his power, but of his knowledge of it.
As  I  learned  from the researches of my friend Arminius of
Buda-Pesth,  he was  in life a most wonderful man.  Soldier,
statesman,  and alchemist.  Which  latter  was  the  highest
development of the science knowledge of his time.  He  had a
mighty  brain, a  learning beyond  compare, and a heart that
knew no fear and no  remorse.  He dared  even  to attend the
Scholomance,  and there  was no  branch of knowledge  of his
time that he did not essay.
<P>
     "Well, in  him  the brain  powers survived the physical
death. Though it would seem that memory was not all complete.
In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child.
But he is growing, and some things that were childish at the
first are now  of  man's stature.  He  is experimenting, and
doing it well.  And if it had not been that  we have crossed
his  path  he would be yet,  he  may  be yet if we fail, the
father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must
lead through Death, not Life."
<P>
     Harker groaned and  said,  "And  this  is  all  arrayed
against my darling!  But how is he experimenting?  The knowledge may help us to defeat him!"
<P>
     "He  has all along, since  his coming,  been trying his
power, slowly but  surely.  That big child-brain  of  his is
working.  Well for us, it is as yet, a child-brain.  For had
he dared, at the first, to attempt certain  things  he would
long ago have been beyond our power.  However,  he means  to
succeed, and a man who has centuries before  him can  afford
to wait and to go slow.  Festina lente may well be his motto."
<P>
     "I fail to understand," said  Harker  wearily.  "Oh, do
be more plain to me!  Perhaps grief and  trouble are dulling
my brain."
<P>
     The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as
he spoke,  "Ah, my child, I will be plain.  Do you  not  see
how, of late, this monster has  been creeping into knowledge
experimentally. How he has been making use of the zoophagous
patient to effect his entry into friend John's home.  For your
Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when and how he
will, must at the first make  entry only when asked  thereto
by  an inmate.  But these are not his most important experiments.  Do  we not see  how at the first  all these so great
boxes were moved by others.   He knew not then but that must
be so. But all the time that so great child-brain of his was
growing, and he began  to consider whether he might not himself  move the box.  So he began to help.  And then, when he
found that this be all right, he try to move them all alone.
And so he progress, and he scatter these graves of him.  And
none but he know where they are hidden.
<P>
     "He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So
that only he use them in the night, or at such  time  as  he
can  change his  form, they do  him equal well, and none may
know these are his hiding place!  But, my child, do not despair, this knowledge came to him just too late!  Already all
of his lairs but one be sterilize as for him. And before the
sunset this shall be so.  Then he have no place where he can
move and hide.  I delayed this morning that  so we  might be
sure.  Is there not more at stake for us than for him?  Then
why not be more careful than him? By my clock it is one hour
and already, if all be well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on
their way to us.  Today is our  day, and we must go sure, if
slow, and lose no chance.  See!  There  are five of us  when
those absent ones return."
<P>
     Whilst we  were speaking we were startled by a knock at
the hall  door, the double  postman's knock of the telegraph
boy.  We all moved out to the hall with one impulse, and Van
Helsing, holding up his hand to us to  keep silence, stepped
to  the door and opened it.  The boy handed in  a  dispatch.
The Professor closed the door again, and after looking at the
direction, opened it and read aloud.
<P>
     "Look out  for  D.  He  has  just now, 12:45, come from
Carfax hurriedly and hastened towards the South. He seems to
be going the round and may want to see you:  Mina."
<P>
     There  was  a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker's voice,
"Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!"
<P>
     Van Helsing  turned to him quickly and said,  "God will
act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoice
as yet.  For  what we wish  for at the moment may be our own
undoings."
<P>
     "I care for nothing now," he answered hotly, "except to
wipe out this brute from the face of creation.  I would sell
my soul to do it!"
<P>
     "Oh, hush, hush, my child!" said Van Helsing. "God does
not purchase souls in this wise, and the Devil, though he may
purchase, does not keep faith.  But God is merciful and just,
and  knows  your  pain and  your devotion to that dear Madam
Mina.  Think you, how her pain would be doubled, did she but
hear your wild words.  Do not fear any of us, we are all devoted to this cause, and today shall  see the end.  The time
is coming for action.  Today  this  Vampire is  limit to the
powers of man, and till sunset he may  not  change.  It will
take him time to arrive here, see  it is twenty minutes past
one, and there are yet some times before he can hither come,
be he never so quick.  What we must hope for is that my Lord
Arthur and Quincey arrive first."
<P>
     About half an hour  after we had received Mrs. Harker's
telegram,  there  came a quiet,  resolute  knock at the hall
door. It was just an ordinary knock, such as is given hourly
by thousands of gentlemen, but it made the Professor's heart
and mine beat loudly.  We looked at each other, and together
moved out into the hall.  We each held ready to use our various armaments, the spiritual in the  left  hand, the mortal
in the right. Van Helsing pulled back the latch, and holding
the door half open, stood back, having both  hands ready for
action.  The gladness of our hearts must have shown upon our
faces when on the step, close to the door, we saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closed the
door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the
hall.
<P>
     "It is all right.  We  found both places.  Six boxes in
each and we destroyed them all."
<P>
     "Destroyed?" asked the Professor.
<P>
     "For him!" We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey
said,  "There's nothing to do but to wait here. If, however,
he doesn't turn up by five o'clock, we must start  off.  For
it won't do to leave Mrs. Harker alone after sunset."
<P>
     "He will  be  here  before long now,' said Van Helsing,
who  had been  consulting  his  pocketbook.  "Nota bene,  in
Madam's telegram he went south from Carfax.  That  means  he
went to cross the river, and he could only do so at slack of
tide, which should be something before one o'clock.  That he
went south has a meaning for us.  He is  as yet  only suspicious, and he went  from Carfax  first to the place where he
would suspect interference least. You must have been at Bermondsey only a short time before him.  That he is  not  here
already shows that he went to  Mile End next.  This took him
some time, for he would  then have  to be carried  over  the
river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not have
long to wait now.  We should have ready some plan of attack,
so that we may throw away no chance.  Hush, there is no time
now.  Have all your arms!  Be ready!"  He held  up a warning
hand as he spoke, for we all could hear a key softly inserted
in the lock of the hall door.
<P>
     I could  not but admire, even at such a moment, the way
in which a dominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and adventures in different parts of the  world,
Quincey Morris had always been the one to  arrange  the plan
of action, and Arthur and I had been accustomed  to obey him
implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be renewed instinctively.  With a swift glance around the room, he at once laid
out our plan of attack, and without speaking  a word, with a
gesture, placed us  each in position.  Van Helsing,  Harker,
and I were just behind the door, so that  when it was opened
the Professor could guard it whilst we two  stepped  between
the incomer and the door.  Godalming  behind and  Quincey in
front stood just out of sight ready to  move in front of the
window.  We waited in a suspense that made  the seconds pass
with nightmare slowness.  The slow, careful steps came along
the hall. The Count was evidently prepared for some surprise,
at least he feared it.
<P>
     Suddenly  with  a single  bound he leaped into the room.
Winning  a  way past us before  any of us could raise a hand
to  stay him.  There was  something  so  pantherlike  in the
movement, something so unhuman, that it  seemed to  sober us
all from the shock of his coming. The first to act was Harker, who with a quick movement, threw  himself before the door
leading  into the room in the front  of the  house.  As  the
Count saw us, a horrible sort of snarl passed over his face,
showing the eyeteeth long and  pointed.  But the  evil smile
as quickly passed into  a  cold stare  of lion-like disdain.
His expression again  changed as, with a single  impulse, we
all advanced upon  him.  It was a pity that  we had not some
better organized plan  of attack, for  even at the moment  I
wondered what we were  to do.  I did not myself know whether
our lethal weapons would avail us anything.
<P>
     Harker evidently  meant  to try  the matter, for he had
ready his  great Kukri knife and  made  a  fierce and sudden
cut at him.  The blow was a powerful one.  Only  the diabolical quickness of the Count's leap back saved him.  A second
less and the trenchant blade had  shorn  through  his  coat,
making  a  wide  gap  whence a  bundle of  bank notes and  a
stream of gold fell out. The expression of the Count's  face
was so hellish, that for a moment I feared for Harker, though
I saw him throw the terrible knife aloft again  for  another
stroke.  Instinctively I moved  forward  with  a  protective
impulse, holding the Crucifix and  Wafer in my left hand.  I
felt a mighty power fly  along my arm, and  it  was  without
surprise that I saw the monster cower back before  a similar
movement made spontaneously by each one of us.  It would  be
impossible to describe the expression  of  hate and  baffled
malignity, of anger and hellish rage,  which  came over  the
Count's face.  His waxen hue  became greenish-yellow  by the
contrast of his burning eyes, and the red scar on  the forehead showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound. The
next instant, with a sinuous dive  he swept  under  Harker's
arm, ere his blow could fall, and grasping a handful of  the
money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw  himself
at the window.  Amid the  crash  and  glitter of the falling
glass, he tumbled into the flagged area below.  Through  the
sound of the shivering glass I could  hear the "ting" of the
gold, as some of the  sovereigns fell on the flagging.
<P>
     We ran over and saw him spring  unhurt from the ground.
He, rushing up  the  steps,  crossed  the  flagged yard, and
pushed open the stable door.  There he  turned  and spoke to
us.
<P>
     "You  think  to baffle me, you with your pale faces all
in a row, like  sheep  in  a butcher's.  You shall be  sorry
yet, each one of you!  You think you have left me without  a
place to rest, but I have more.  My revenge  is just  begun!
I spread it over  centuries, and time is  on my  side.  Your
girls that you all love  are mine already.  And through them
you and  others shall yet be mine, my  creatures, to  do  my
bidding and to be my jackals when I want to feed.  Bah!"
<P>
     With  a  contemptuous sneer, he  passed quickly through
the door, and we  heard the rusty bolt  creak as he fastened
it behind him.  A door beyond opened and shut.  The first of
us to speak was the Professor.  Realizing  the difficulty of
following him through the stable, we  moved toward the hall.
<P>
     "We have learnt something . . . much!   Notwithstanding
his brave words, he fears us.  He fears time, he fears want!
For if not, why he hurry so?  His  very tone betray  him, or
my ears deceive.  Why  take  that money?  You  follow quick.
You are hunters of the wild beast,  and  understand  it  so.
For me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to  him,
if so that he returns."
<P>
     As he spoke  he put  the money remaining in his pocket,
took the title deeds in the  bundle as Harker had left them,
and  swept  the  remaining  things into  the open fireplace,
where he set fire to them with a match.
<P>
     Godalming  and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and
Harker  had  lowered  himself from  the window to follow the
Count.  He had, however, bolted  the stable door, and by the
time they had forced it open there  was no sign of him.  Van
Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back of the house.
But the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.
<P>
     It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far
off.  We had to recognize that our game was up.  With  heavy
hearts we agreed with the Professor when he said, "Let us go
back to Madam Mina.  Poor, poor dear Madam Mina.  All we can
do just now is done, and we can there, at least, protect her.
But we need not despair.  There is but one more earth box, and
we must try to find it.  When that is done all may yet be well."
<P>
     I could see that he spoke as bravely as he could to comfort Harker.  The poor fellow was quite broken down, now and
again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress.  He was
thinking of his wife.
<P>
     With  sad hearts  we came  back to  my  house, where we
found Mrs. Harker waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honor to her bravery and unselfishness.  When
she saw our faces, her own became as pale  as death.  For  a
second or two her eyes were closed as if she were  in secret
prayer.
<P>
     And  then  she said cheerfully,  "I can never thank you
all enough.  Oh, my poor darling!"
<P>
     As  she spoke, she took  her husband's grey head in her
hands and kissed it.
<P>
     "Lay your poor  head here and rest it.  All will yet be
well, dear!  God  will  protect  us  if He so will it in His
good intent."  The poor fellow groaned.  There  was no place
for words in his sublime misery.
<P>
     We  had  a  sort  of perfunctory supper together, and I
think it cheered us all  up  somewhat.  It was, perhaps, the
mere animal heat of food to hungry  people,  for  none of us
had eaten anything since breakfast, or the sense of companionship  may  have  helped  us,  but  anyhow  we  were all less
miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope.
<P>
     True to our promise,  we told  Mrs.  Harker  everything
which had passed. And although she grew snowy white at times
when danger had seemed to threaten her husband, and  red  at
others when his devotion to her was  manifested she listened
bravely and with calmness.  When we came to the  part  where
Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she  clung  to
her husband's arm, and held it tight as  though her clinging
could protect him from any harm that might  come.  She  said
nothing, however, till the narration was all done,and matters
had been brought up to the present time.
<P>
     Then without letting go her husband's hand she stood up
amongst us and spoke.  Oh, that I could give any idea of the
scene. Of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty of her youth and animation, with the red scar on
her forehead, of which she was conscious, and  which we  saw
with grinding  of our teeth,  remembering whence and  how it
came.  Her loving kindness against our grim hate. Her tender
faith against all our fears and doubting.  And  we,  knowing
that so far as symbols went, she with  all her goodness  and
purity and faith, was outcast from God.
<P>
     "Jonathan,"  she said,  and the word sounded like music
on her lips it was so full of love and tenderness, "Jonathan
dear, and you all my true, true friends, I want you to  bear
something in mind through all this dreadful time.  I know that
you must fight.  That you must destroy even as you destroyed
the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might  live  hereafter.
But it is not a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought
all this misery is the saddest case of all.  Just think what
will be his joy when he, too, is destroyed in his worser part
that his better part may have spiritual immortality.  You must
be pitiful to him, too,though it may not hold your hands from
his destruction."
<P>
     As she spoke I could see her husband's face  darken and
draw together, as though the passion in  him were shriveling
his being to its core. Instinctively the clasp on his wife's
hand grew closer, till his knuckles  looked white.  She  did
not flinch from the pain which I knew she must have suffered,
but looked at him with eyes that were  more  appealing  than
ever.
<P>
     As she stopped  speaking he leaped  to his feet, almost
tearing his hand from hers as he spoke.
<P>
     "May God give him into my hand  just for long enough to
destroy that earthly life of him which we are aiming at.  If
beyond it I could send his soul forever and ever to  burning
hell I would do it!"
<P>
     "Oh, hush! Oh, hush in the name of the good God.  Don't
say such things,  Jonathan, my husband, or you will crush me
with fear and horror.  Just think, my dear . . . I have been
thinking  all this long,  long  day  of  it . . . that . . .
perhaps . . .some day  . . . I, too, may need such pity, and
that some other like you, and with equal cause for anger, may
deny it to me!  Oh, my husband!  My husband, indeed I  would
have spared you such a thought had there been  another  way.
But I pray that God may not have treasured your  wild words,
except as the heart-broken wail of a  very loving and sorely
stricken man.  Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence of what he has suffered, who all his life has done no
wrong, and on whom so many sorrows have come."
<P>
     We  men were  all in tears now.  There was no resisting
them, and  we  wept openly.  She  wept, too, to see that her
sweeter  counsels had prevailed.  Her husband  flung himself
on his knees beside her, and putting his arms round her, hid
his face in the folds of her dress.  Van Helsing beckoned to
us and we  stole out  of  the room, leaving the  two  loving
hearts alone with their God.
<P>
     Before  they  retired  the  Professor fixed up the room
against any coming of the Vampire,  and  assured Mrs. Harker
that she might rest in peace.  She tried to  school  herself
to the belief, and manifestly for her husband's sake,  tried
to seem content.  It was a brave struggle,  and was, I think
and believe, not without its reward.  Van Helsing had placed
at hand a bell which either of them was to sound  in case of
any emergency.   When they  had retired, Quincey, Godalming,
and I arranged that we should  sit up,  dividing  the  night
between us, and watch over the safety of the  poor  stricken
lady.  The first watch falls to Quincey, so the  rest  of us
shall be off to bed as soon as we can.
<P>
     Godalming has already turned in,  for his is the second
watch.  Now that my work is done I, too, shall go to bed.
<P>

<P>
       JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL
<P>

<P>
     3-4 October, close to  midnight.--I  thought  yesterday
would never end.  There was over me a yearning for sleep, in
some  sort  of  blind  belief  that to wake would be to find
things  changed,  and that  any  change  must now be for the
better.  Before we parted, we discussed what  our next  step
was to be, but we could arrive at  no  result.  All we  knew
was that  one earth box  remained, and that  the Count alone
knew where it was.  If he chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle
us for years.  And in the meantime, the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even now.  This I know, that if
ever there was a woman who was all perfection, that one is my
poor wronged darling.  I loved her a thousand times more for
her sweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of
the monster seem despicable.  Surely God will not permit the
world to be the poorer by the loss of such a creature.  This
is hope to me.  We are all drifting reefwards now, and faith
is our only anchor.  Thank God! Mina is sleeping, and sleeping
without dreams.  I fear what her dreams  might be like, with
such terrible memories to  ground them in.  She has not been
so calm,  within  my  seeing, since the sunset.  Then, for a
while,  there  came  over  her  face a repose which was like
spring after the blasts of March. I thought at the time that
it was the softness of the red sunset on her face, but somehow  now  I  think it has a deeper meaning.  I am not sleepy
myself, though I am weary . . . weary to death.  However,  I
must try to sleep.  For there is tomorrow to think  of,  and
there is no rest for me until . . .
<P>

<P>
     Later--I must have fallen asleep, for I was awakened by
Mina, who was sitting up in bed, with a startled look on her
face.  I could see easily, for we did not leave the  room in
darkness.  She had placed a warning hand over my mouth,  and
now she whispered in my ear, "Hush!  There is someone in the
corridor!"  I got up softly, and crossing  the room,  gently
opened the door.
<P>
     Just  outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris,
wide awake.  He raised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me,  "Hush!  Go back to bed.  It is all right.  One
of us will be here all night.  We don't  mean  to  take  any
chances!"
<P>
     His look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back
and told Mina. She sighed and positively a shadow of a smile
stole over her poor, pale face as she put her arms  round me
and said softly,  "Oh, thank God for good brave men!" With a
sigh she sank back again to sleep.  I write this now as I am
not sleepy, though I must try again.
<P>

<P>
     4 October, morning.--Once again during the night I  was
wakened by Mina.  This time we had all had a good sleep, for
the  grey  of  the  coming  dawn was making the windows into
sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was like a speck rather than
a disc of light.
<P>
     She said to me hurriedly,  "Go, call the  Professor.  I
want to see him at once."
<P>
     "Why?" I asked.
<P>
     "I  have  an  idea.  I suppose it must have come in the
night, and matured without my knowing it.  He must hypnotize
me before the dawn, and then I shall be able  to  speak.  Go
quick, dearest, the time is getting close."
<P>
     I went to the door.  Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress, and seeing me, he sprang to his feet.
<P>
     "Is anything wrong?" he asked, in alarm.
<P>
     "No," I replied. "But Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing
at once."
<P>
     "I will go,"  he said, and hurried into the Professor's
room.
<P>
     Two  or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room
in his dressing gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were
with Dr. Seward at the door asking questions.  When the Professor saw Mina a smile, a positive smile ousted the anxiety
of his face.
<P>
     He  rubbed  his  hands  as he said,  "Oh, my dear Madam
Mina, this  is  indeed  a change.  See!  Friend Jonathan, we
have got our dear Madam Mina,  as of old, back to us today!"
Then turning to her, he said cheerfully,  "And what am I  to
do for you? For at this hour you do not want me for nothing."
<P>
     "I want  you to hypnotize me!" she said.  "Do it before
the dawn,  for I feel that then I can speak, and speak freely.  Be  quick,  for the time is short!"  Without a word  he
motioned her to sit up in bed.
<P>
     Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes  in
front  of her, from over the  top of her head downward, with
each hand in turn.  Mina gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat like a trip hammer, for
I felt that some  crisis was  at hand.  Gradually  her  eyes
closed, and she sat, stock still. Only by the gentle heaving
of her bosom could one know that she was alive.  The Professor
made a few more passes and then stopped, and I could see that
his forehead was covered with  great  beads of perspiration.
Mina opened her eyes,  but  she did not seem the same woman.
There was a far-away look  in her  eyes, and her voice had a
sad dreaminess which was new to me.  Raising his hand to impose  silence, the  Professor motioned to  me to  bring  the
others in.  They came on tiptoe, closing the door behind them,
and stood at the foot of the bed, looking on.  Mina appeared
not to see them.  The stillness was broken by Van  Helsing's
voice speaking in a low level tone which would not break the
current of her thoughts.
<P>
     "Where are you?"  The answer came in a neutral way.
<P>
     "I do not know.  Sleep has no place it can call its own."
For several minutes there was silence.  Mina sat  rigid, and
the Professor stood staring at her fixedly.
<P>
     The rest  of us  hardly dared to breathe.  The room was
growing lighter.  Without  taking his eyes from Mina's face,
Dr. Van Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind.  I did so,
and the day seemed just upon us. A red streak shot up, and a
rosy light seemed to diffuse itself through the room. On the
instant the Professor spoke again.
<P>
     "Where are you now?"
<P>
     The answer  came dreamily, but with intention.  It were
as though she were interpreting something.  I have heard her
use the same tone when reading her shorthand notes.
<P>
     "I do not know.  It is all strange to me!"
<P>
     "What do you see?"
<P>
     "I can see nothing.  It is all dark."
<P>
     "What do  you  hear?"  I could detect the strain in the
Professor's patient voice.
<P>
     "The lapping of  water.  It is gurgling  by, and little
waves leap.  I can hear them on the outside."
<P>
     "Then you are on a ship?'"
<P>
     We all looked at each  other, trying to glean something
each from the other.  We were afraid to think.
<P>
     The answer came quick,  "Oh, yes!"
<P>
     "What else do you hear?"
<P>
     "The sound  of men stamping overhead as they run about.
There is the creaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the
check of the capstan falls into the ratchet."
<P>
     "What are you doing?"
<P>
     "I am still, oh so still.  It is like death!"  The voice
faded away into a  deep  breath as  of one sleeping, and the
open eyes closed again.
<P>
     By this time the sun  had risen, and we were all in the
full light of day.  Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina's
shoulders, and laid her head down softly on her pillow.  She
lay like a sleeping child for a few moments, and  then, with
a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see us all around
her.
<P>
     "Have I been talking in my sleep?" was all she said.  She
seemed, however, to know the situation without telling,though
she  was eager to know what she had told.  The Professor repeated the conversation, and she said,  "Then there is not a
moment to lose.  It may not be yet too late!"
<P>
     Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door  but
the Professor's calm voice called them back.
<P>
     "Stay,  my  friends.  That  ship, wherever  it was, was
weighing  anchor at the moment in your so great Port of London.  Which of them is it that you seek? God be thanked that
we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us  we
know  not.  We have  been  blind somewhat.  Blind  after the
manner of men, since we can look back  we see what we  might
have seen looking forward if we had been able to see what we
might have seen!  Alas, but that sentence is a puddle, is it
not?  We can know now what was in the Count's mind,  when he
seize that money, though Jonathan's so fierce  knife put him
in the danger that even he dread.  He meant escape. Hear me,
ESCAPE!  He saw that with but one earth box left, and a pack
of men following like dogs after a  fox,  this London was no
place for him.  He have take his last  earth  box on board a
ship, and he leave the land.  He think to escape, but no! We
follow him.  Tally Ho!  As friend  Arthur  would say when he
put on his red frock!  Our  old  fox is wily.  Oh!  So wily,
and we must follow with wile.  I, too,  am wily  and I think
his mind in a little  while.  In meantime we may rest and in
peace, for there are between us which he do not want to pass,
and which he could not if he would.  Unless the ship were to
touch the land, and then only at full or slack tide.  See, and
the sun is just  rose,  and all day to sunset is us.  Let us
take bath, and  dress, and have breakfast which we all need,
and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same
land with us."
<P>
     Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked,  "But  why
need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?"
<P>
     He took her hand and patted it as he replied,  "Ask  me
nothing as yet.  When we have breakfast, then  I answer  all
questions."  He would say no more, and we separated to dress.
<P>
     After breakfast Mina repeated her question.  He  looked
at her gravely for a minute and then said sorrowfully,  "Because my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than  ever  must we
find him even if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell!"
<P>
     She grew paler as she asked faintly,  "Why?"
<P>
     "Because," he answered solemnly, "he can  live for centuries, and you are but mortal woman.  Time  is  now  to  be
dreaded, since once he put that mark upon your throat."
<P>
     I was just in time to catch her as she fell  forward in
a faint.
