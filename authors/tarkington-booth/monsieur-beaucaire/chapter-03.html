<p>It was well agreed by the fashion of Bath that M. le Duc de Chateaurien
was a person of sensibility and haut ton; that his retinue and
equipage surpassed in elegance; that his person was exquisite,
his manner engaging. In the company of gentlemen his ease was
slightly tinged with graciousness (his single equal in Bath being
his Grace of Winterset); but it was remarked that when he bowed
over a lady's hand, his air bespoke only a gay and tender reverence.</p>

<p>He was the idol of the dowagers within a week after his appearance;
matrons warmed to him; young belles looked sweetly on him, while
the gentlemen were won to admiration or envy. He was of prodigious
wealth: old Mr. Bicksit, who dared not, for his fame's sake, fail
to have seen all things, had visited Chateaurien under the present
Duke's father, and descanted to the curious upon its grandeurs.
The young noble had one fault, he was so poor a gambler. He cared
nothing for the hazards of a die or the turn of a card. Gayly
admitting that he had been born with no spirit of adventure in
him, he was sure, he declared, that he failed of much happiness
by his lack of taste in such matters.</p>

<p>But he was not long wanting the occasion to prove his taste in
the matter of handling a weapon. A certain led-captain, Rohrer
by name, notorious, amongst other things, for bearing a dexterous
and bloodthirsty blade, came to Bath post-haste, one night, and
jostled heartily against him, in the pump-room on the following
morning. M. de Chauteaurien bowed, and turned aside without offense,
continuing a conversation with some gentlemen near by. Captain
Rohrer jostled against him a second time. M. de Chateaurien looked
him in the eye, and apologized pleasantly for being so much in
the way. Thereupon Rohrer procured an introduction to him, and
made some observations derogatory to the valor and virtue of the
French. There was current a curious piece of gossip of the French
court: a prince of the blood royal, grandson of the late Regent
and second in the line of succession to the throne of France,
had rebelled against the authority of Louis XV, who had commanded
him to marry the Princess Henriette, cousin to both of them. The
princess was reported to be openly devoted to the cousin who refused
to accept her hand at the bidding of the king; and, as rumor ran,
the prince's caprice elected in preference the discipline of Vincennes,
to which retirement the furious king had consigned him. The story
was the staple gossip of all polite Europe; and Captain Rohrer,
having in his mind a purpose to make use of it in leading up to
a statement that should be general to the damage of all Frenchwomen,
and which a Frenchman might not pass over as he might a jog of
the elbow, repeated it with garbled truths to make a scandal of
a story which bore none on a plain relation.</p>

<p>He did not reach his deduction. M. de Chateaurien, breaking into
his narrative, addressed him very quietly. "Monsieur," he said,
"none but swine deny the nobleness of that good and gentle lady,
Mademoiselle la Princesse de Bourbon-Conti. Every Frenchman know'
that her cousin is a bad rebel and ingrate, who had only honor
and rispec' for her, but was so wilful he could not let even the
king say, 'You shall marry here, you shall marry there.' My frien's,"
the young man turned to the others, "may I ask you to close roun'
in a circle for one moment? It is clearly shown that the Duke
of Orleans is a scurvy fellow, but not&mdash;" he wheeled about and
touched Captain Rohrer on the brow with the back of his gloved
hand&mdash;"but not so scurvy as thou, thou swine of the gutter!"</p>

<p>Two hours later, with perfect ease, he ran Captain Rohrer through
the left shoulder&mdash;after which he sent a basket of red roses to
the Duke of Winterset. In a few days he had another captain to
fight. This was a ruffling buck who had the astounding indiscretion
to proclaim M. de Chateaurien an impostor. There was no Chateaurien,
he swore. The Frenchman laughed in his face, and, at twilight
of the same day, pinked him carefully through the right shoulder.
It was not that he could not put aside the insult to himself,
he declared to Mr. Molyneux, his second, and the few witnesses,
as he handed his wet sword to his lackey&mdash;one of his station could
not be insulted by a doubt of that station&mdash;but he fought in the
quarrel of his friend Winterset. This rascal had asserted that
M. le Duc had introduced an impostor. Could he overlook the insult
to a friend, one to whom he owed his kind reception in Bath? Then,
bending over his fallen adversary, he whispered: "Naughty man,
tell your master find some better quarrel for the nex' he sen'
agains' me."</p>

<p>The conduct of M. de Chateaurien was pronounced admirable.</p>

<p>There was no surprise when the young foreigner fell naturally
into the long train of followers of the beautiful Lady Mary Carlisle,
nor was there great astonishment that he should obtain marked
favor in her eyes, shown so plainly that my Lord Townbrake, Sir
Hugh Guilford, and the rich Squire Bantison, all of whom had followed
her through three seasons, swore with rage, and his Grace of Winterset
stalked from her aunt's house with black brows.</p>

<p>Meeting the Duke there on the evening after his second encounter
de Chateaurien smiled upon him brilliantly. "It was badly done;
oh, so badly!" he whispered. "Can you afford to have me strip'
of my mask by any but yourself? You, who introduce' me? They will
say there is some bad scandal that I could force you to be my
god-father. You mus' get the courage yourself."</p>

<p>"I told you a rose had a short life," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Oh, those roses! 'Tis the very greates' rizzon to gather each
day a fresh one." He took a red bud from his breast for an instant,
and touched it to his lips.</p>

<p>"M. de Chateaurien!" It was Lady Mary's voice; she stood at a
table where a vacant place had been left beside her. "M. de Chateaurien,
we have been waiting very long for you."</p>

<p>The Duke saw the look she did not know she gave the Frenchman,
and he lost countenance for a moment.</p>

<p>"We approach a climax, eh, monsieur?" said M. de Chateaurien.</p>
