<p>The Captain resumed his lolling posture, placed another cartridge
in his revolver and lit a fresh cigarette. By and by his eyes
closed and Major Starland saw that he slept. The American arose
to his feet, yawned and stretched his arms over his head, holding
the tiller in place between his knees.</p>

<p>"Unless I am alert I shall fall asleep too, and then the mischief
will be to pay. It isn't prudent to disturb these creatures, but
to hold a position of armed neutrality. If the fools don't know
their power, it isn't wise to set them investigating."</p>

<p>To the right on the mainland, the low flat plain extended to
the limit of vision. The tall, reedy grass came down to the edge
of the water, and the nodding plumes showed for some distance
out in the stream. Several miles in advance, on the same shore,
the dark green mass of a forest buffeted against the soft sky,
the species of trees being innumerable and so closely wedged in
many places, that not even the attenuated Captain Guzman could
have forced his way through except by scrambling from limb to
limb.</p>

<p>The southern bank was similar, but far to the westward, the rugged
outline of the Rubio Mountains rose in the sky and wore the soft
blue tint of the sea of clear atmosphere. Beyond the mountains,
snuggled the Republic of Atlamalco which was the destination of
the American.</p>

<p>On the northern bank, two-score wild cattle that had been browsing
on the succulent grass, loafed down to the river and waded out
till the current bathed their sides. They sought the water for
its coolness at this oppressive period of the day and to escape
the billions of insect pests that at times make life a torment.
Their tails, whose bushy tips flirted the water in showers over
their heads and backs, were never idle. Some of them kept edging
outward until no more than their spines, horns, ears, and the
upper part of their heads remained in sight.</p>

<p>The leader of the herd was a magnificent black bull, who stood
on the bank and bellowed at the boat sailing past, as if challenging
it to a fight to the finish. He was afraid of nothing on earth
and revelled in a battle which would allow him to display his
tremendous prowess, power and wrath.</p>

<p>Seeing that the boat paid no heed to his thunderous challenge,
the bull galloped sideways and backward to shore, and trotted
along its bank, looking at the craft, thrusting out his snout
and calling for it to come ashore and have it out with him. Major
Starland picked up his Krag-Jorgensen from where it leaned beside
his feet and sighted at the bull, into whose bellowing there seemed
to intrude a regretful note over the ignoring of his challenge.</p>

<p>"It's a pretty good distance, but I can drop you so quickly you
would never know what did it, and, being that you wouldn't know,
where's the satisfaction to either of us? I'll be hanged if I
uncrown such a noble monarch in that pot fashion!"</p>

<p>The weapon was laid down and the Major resumed his seat and care
of the tiller. At this time the bull was standing on a slight
rise of ground, just clear of the water with Major Starland contemplating
the superb fellow. Something dark and sinuous suddenly darted
out like a black streak of lightning from the mud just in front
of the animal and the cry of the bull changed to one of frenzy.
He was scared at last.</p>

<p>Still bellowing, he planted his four hoofs rigidly in the mud,
and leaned so far backward that his legs were inclined at a sharp
angle. His feet sank slowly and he yielded a short, reluctant
step. Then he paused and putting forth his great strength gradually
moved the hoofs, one after the other, backward. He strove mightily
to continue his retreat, but the uplifted fore foot was instantly
jammed down again, and the utmost he could do was to hold his
own.</p>

<p>The black thing which had flashed out from the mud a few paces
away was the head of a gigantic anaconda that had hidden itself
in the slime and was waiting for cow or bull to come within reach.
The instant the king of the herd did so, the head shot from its
concealment and the teeth were snapped together in the cartilage
of the animal's nose. Then the serpent began drawing its victim
forward with terrific power. The bull knew his peril and resisted
to the last ounce of his strength.</p>

<p>But the reptile was a fool. Had it voluntarily freed itself,
or allowed the bull to get clear of the enveloping mushy earth,
it could have whirled its entire length around the quadruped and
mashed it to pulp. But the Atlamalcan tugboat, if tied by a hawser
to the reptile could not have drawn it forth, for it will allow
itself to be pulled asunder before yielding. Nor can any conceivable
power induce the serpent to let go, its unshakable resolve being
to draw its prey within its folds, instead of meeting its victim.</p>

<p>It was a veritable tug of war, and the sympathies of Major Starland
were wholly on the side of the bull. Slipping a bit of rope over
the tiller to hold it in place, he knelt on one knee and sighted
with the utmost care. The six or eight feet of the reptile which
was clear of the mud had been stretched to nearly double its natural
length by the furious pulling of the bull, and was as tense as
a violin string and so attenuated as to be hardly one-half its
ordinary diameter. The American aimed at a point just back of
the head and the bullet sped true. Perhaps, as is sometimes the
case, the serpent's body would have yielded in the end, but the
missile expedited matters. It snapped apart, the bull with another
bellow whirled about and galloped up the bank and away, with the
appendage dangling and flapping from his nose, there to hang until
it sloughed off.</p>

<p>The report of the rifle awakened Captain Guzman, who sat up,
but did not understand all that had taken place until it was explained
to him. Then the two partook of the lunch they had brought with
them. When the brief twilight closed over forest and stream, they
had passed three-fourths of the distance between the respective
capitals of the republics. Night had fully come, however, before
the boat was sheered toward the mainland, and drawing it up the
bank beyond the reach of the current, the two stepped out and
walked a short way to a hut that had caught their notice some
time before.</p>

<p>Here, strange to say, the native man and wife had only two children,
both boys, six or eight years of age, naked and not ashamed. Captain
Guzman, who spoke Spanish as well as the American, explained that
they desired food and lodging for the night. The husband told
them they were welcome, while the slatternly helpmate said nothing,
but did her part with commendable diligence. No fire was burning,
nor was one started, though the cinders on the outside showed
that food was sometimes cooked after the manner of civilized peoples.
No table, chairs or furniture were seen, while the floor was of
smooth, hard earth. A large, earthen bowl was nearly filled with
a mixture of tomatoes, onions, olives and several kinds of fruit
chopped together. This was set outside on the ground, between
the two guests, who ate and were filled.</p>
