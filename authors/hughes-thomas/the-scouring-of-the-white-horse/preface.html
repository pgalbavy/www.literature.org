See how the Autumn leaves float by, decaying,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the red whirls of yon rain-swollen stream;<br/>
So fleet the works of men, back to their earth again;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancient and holy things fade like a dream.

</p>
<p>
Nay! see the Spring blossoms steal forth a-maying,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Clothing with tender buds orchard and glen;<br/>
So, though old forms go by, ne’er can their spirit die.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look! England’s bare boughs show green leaf again.

<p>The great success of the festival (or "pastime," as it is called
in the neighbourhood) which was held on White Horse Hill on the
17th and 18th of September, 1857, to celebrate the "Scouring of
the Horse," according to immemorial custom, led the Committee
of Management to think that our fellow-county-men at least, if
not our countrymen generally, would be glad to have some little
printed memorial, which should comprise not only an account of
the doings on the Hill on the late occasion, but should also endeavour
to gather up the scattered legends and traditions of the country
side, and any authentic historical notices relating to the old
monument, of which we west-countrymen are all so fond and proud.</p>

<p>I had the good or ill luck (as the case may be) to be the only
member of the Committee whose way of life had led him into the
perilous paths of literature; so the task of compiling and editing
our little book was laid on my shoulders.</p>

<p>Installed as chronicler to the White Horse, I entered with no
ill will on my office, having been all my life possessed, as is
the case with so many Englishmen, by intense local attachment,
love for every stone and turf of the country where I was born
and bred. But it is one thing to have zeal, and another to have
discretion; and when I came to consider my materials, I found
that the latter quality would be greatly needed. For, what were
they? One short bright gleam of history from the writings of old
monks a thousand years ago; traditions and dim legends, which
I and most Berkshire men have always faithfully believed from
our youth up, and shall go on believing to our dying day, but
which we could hardly put before general readers in serious narrative;
a dry notice here and there by some old antiquary of the seventeenth
or eighteenth century; stories floating in the memories of old
men still living; small broad-sheets from country town presses,
with lists of the competitors for prizes at rustic games, newspaper
articles, remarks by Committee-men and umpires, scraps of antiquarian
lore; abuse of the Great Western Railway for not allowing the
trains to stop, bits of vernacular dialogue, and odd rhymes. What
could be done with them all? How out of the mass could a shapely
book be called out, fit to be laid before a fastidious British
public, not born in Berkshire?</p>

<p>Not exactly seeing how this was to be done, the only honest course
which remained, was to follow the example of a good housewife
in the composition of that excellent food called "stir-about"&mdash;throw
them altogether into the pot, stir them round and round with a
great spoon, and trust that the look of the few great raisins,
and the flavour of the allspice, may leaven the mass, and make
it pleasing to the eye and palate; and so, though the stir-about
will never stand up in a china dish by itself, it may, we hope,
make a savoury and pleasant side dish, in a common soup tureen.</p>

<p>The raisins, and those of the best quality, have been furnished
by the great artist[1] who has kindly undertaken to give us pictures;
the allspice has been contributed by the Committee and other kind
friends, and I have done the milk and meal, and the stirring.
The responsibility therefore rests with me, though the credit,
whatever it may be, rests with others. But let me insist here,
at once, that if there be any failure in the dish, it is the fault
of the dresser and not of the subject-matter.</p>

<p>For, suppose an intelligent Englishman to be travelling in France,
and to find the whole population in the neighbourhood of Tours
turning out in their best clothes for a two days’ holiday on a
high hill, upon which the rude figure of a huge hammer is roughly
sculptured. On inquiry, he finds that the figure has been there
long before the memory of the oldest man living, but that it has
always been carefully preserved and kept fresh; and although there
is no printed history of how it came there, yet that all neighbouring
men, of whatever degree, associate it with the name of Charles
Martel and his great victory over the Saracens, and are ready
one and all to rejoice over it, and to work and pay that it may
go down to their children looking as it does now. Or, to come
to much later times, let our traveller find an eagle cut out on
a hill in Hungary, similarly honoured, and associated with the
name of Eugene, and the memory of the day</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"When, the old black eagle flying,<br/>
All the Paynim powers defying,<br/>
On we marched, and stormed Belgrade."

</p>
</div>
<p>Should we not all thank him for giving us the best account he
could of the figure, the festival, and all traditions connected
with them; and think he had fallen on a very noteworthy matter,
and well worth the telling when he got back to England?</p>

<p>Well, here we have the same thing at our own doors; a rude colossal
figure cut out in the turf, and giving the name to a whole district;
legends connecting it with the name of our greatest king, and
with his great victory over the Pagans, and a festival which has
been held at very short intervals ever since the ninth century.
Rich as our land is in historical monuments, there is none more
remarkable than the White Horse; and in this belief we put forth
this little book in his honour, hoping that it may perhaps fix
upon him, and the other antiquities which surround him, the attention
of some one who can bring science and knowledge to bear upon the
task to which we can only bring good will.</p>

<p>For, alas! let me confess at once, that in these qualities our
book is like to be sadly deficient. The compiler has no knowledge
whatever of the Anglo-Saxon tongue, or of Saxon or other antiquities.
There is indeed of necessity a semblance of learning and research
about the chapter which tells the history of the battle of Ashdown,
because the materials for it had to be collected from a number
of old chroniclers, whose names will be found in the foot-notes.
But any fifth-form boy, with industry enough to read about 200
small pages of monkish Latin, may master the whole for himself
in the originals in a week; and for those who cannot do this,
there is the jubilee edition of the chroniclers, put forth by
the Alfred Committee in 1852, where a translation of the old fellows
will be found in parallel columns, together with much learning
concerning them and their times, in foot-note, preface, and appendix.
This translation I have followed in all but a few passages, in
which the text used by the translators has probably differed from
the one which I have seen. For the Saxon Chronicle, I have used
Ingram’s translation.</p>

<p>But while we do not pretend to be antiquaries, or historians,
or learned men, we do claim to be honest average Englishmen, and
will yield to no man in our love for our own quiet corner of the
land of our birth. We do think, that whatever deeply interests
us cannot fail in a degree to interest our countrymen. We are
sure that reverence for all great Englishmen, and a loving remembrance
of the great deeds done by them in old times, will help to bring
to life in us the feeling that we are a family, bound together
to work out God’s purposes in this little island, and in the uttermost
parts of the earth; to make clear to us the noble inheritance
which we have in common; and to sink into their proper place the
miserable trifles, and odds and ends, over which we are so apt
to wrangle. We do hope that our example will lead Englishmen of
other counties, to cherish every legend and story which hangs
round any nook of their neighbourhood, connecting it with the
times and the men who have gone before; to let no old custom,
which has a meaning, however rude, die out, if it can be kept
alive; and not to keep either legend or custom to themselves,
but (like us) to put them in the best shape they can, and publish
them for the benefit of their countrymen; we of the White Horse
Committee, at any rate, hereby pledging ourselves to read all
such publications.</p>

<p>I must here take the opportunity of specially thanking three
of my fellow Committee-men, and two other friends, for the trouble
they have taken in various ways to lighten my work. If this book
at all fulfils the objects for which it has been written, the
thanks of my readers, as well as my own, will be due to</p>
