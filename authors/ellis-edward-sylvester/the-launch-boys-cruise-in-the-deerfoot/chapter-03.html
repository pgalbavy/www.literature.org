<p>Holding the tiny flicker of flame in the hollow of the hat, Alvin
saw in fancy gilt letters, pasted on the silk lining, the following:</p>

<p>"<em>NOXON O</em>"</p>

<p>"That's a queer name," he reflected. "I never heard anything
like it."</p>

<p>"Do ye know ye're holding the same upside down?"</p>

<p>The Irish lad, panting from his exertion in running, stood grinning
at Alvin's elbow. "'Spose ye turns the hat round so as to revarse
the same."</p>

<p>Alvin did so and then read "O <em>NOXON</em>."</p>

<p>"It's the oddest name I ever saw, for '<em>NOXON' </em>reads
the same upside down and backwards &mdash;Ugh!"</p>

<p>Seized with a sudden loathing, he sent the hat skimming a dozen
feet away. His feeling was as if he had grasped a serpent. Then
he turned and impulsively offered his hand to the Irish lad.</p>

<p>"Shake! You were a friend in need."</p>

<p>"It's mesilf that's under deep obligations to yersilf."</p>

<p>"How do you make that out?"</p>

<p>"Didn't ye give me the finest chance for a shindy that I've had
since I lift Tipperary? I haven't had so much fun since Pat Geoghaghan
almost whaled the life out of me at home."</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Mike Murphy, at your sarvice."</p>

<p>And the grinning lad lifted his straw hat and bowed with the
grace of a crusader.</p>

<p>"Where do you live?"</p>

<p>"Up the road a wee bit, wid me father and mither."</p>

<p>"Are you the son of Pat Murphy?" asked the astonished Alvin.</p>

<p>"He has the honor, according to his own story, of being me dad."</p>

<p>"Why, he's father's caretaker. I remember he told me some time
ago that he had a boy seventeen years old that he had sent word
to in Ireland to come over and join him. And you are he! Why,
I'm so glad I should like to shake hands with you again."</p>

<p>"I'm nothing loath, but I say that hat ye threw away is more
of the fashion in this part of the wurruld than in Tipperary,
and if ye have no objections I'll make a trade."</p>

<p>And the Irish lad walked to where the headgear lay, picked it
up and pulled it on his crown.</p>

<p>"It's a parfect fit&mdash;as the tramp said when he bounced around
the kind leddy's yard&mdash;don't I look swaat in the same?"</p>

<p>Alvin could not help laughing outright, for the hat was at least
a size too small for the proud new owner, and perched on his crown
made his appearance more comical than it had been formed by nature.</p>

<p>"I knew ye would be plased, as me uncle said when the docther
towld him he would be able to handle his shillaleh inside of a
waak and meet his engagement with Dennis O'Shaugnessey at Donnybrook
fair. Me dad tached me always to be honest."</p>

<p>To prove which Mike laid down his battered straw hat beside the
road, where the seeker of the better headgear would have no trouble
in finding it. "And if it's all the same, Alvin, we'll adjourn
to our home, for I'm so hungry I could ate me own grandmither."</p>

<p>"How did you know my name?" asked the surprised Alvin.</p>

<p>"Arrah, now, hasn't me dad and mither been writing me since they
moved into this part of the wurruld and spaking of yersilf? It
was yer telling me that me dad was your dad's caretaker that towld
the rist. Ef I had known it was yersilf I would have hit that
spalpeen harder."</p>

<p>"You did well as it was. But I say, Mike, when did you arrive
in Maine?"</p>

<p>"Only three days since. Having had directions from me dad, as
soon as I got ashore in New York I made fur the railway station,
where I wint to slaap in the cars and woke up in Portland. Thar
I had time to ate breakfast and ride in the train to Bath, where
I meant to board the steamboat <em>Gardiner</em>. I had half a
minute to sprint down the hill to the wharf, but the time was
up before I got there and the men pulled in the plank when I was
twinty faat away. I'm told the Captain niver tarries ten seconds
for anybody."</p>

<p>"That's true," replied Alvin, "for I have seen him steam away
when by waiting half a minute he would have gained five or six
passengers."</p>

<p>"So I had to tarry for the other steamer, which lift me off at
Southport, and I walked the rist of the way to the home of me
parents. I mind dad towld me the same was four or five miles,
but I think it was six hundred full. I found me parents yesterday."</p>

<p>"I remember now that your father said he expected you about this
time, but it had slipped my mind, and having been away all day
I had no chance to learn of your coming. But I can tell you, Mike,
I'm mighty glad to know you."</p>

<p>"The same to yersilf," was the hearty response of the Irish lad.
In fact, considering the circumstances in which the two met, to
say nothing of their congenial dispositions, nothing was more
natural than that they should form a strong liking for each other.
They walked side by side, sometimes in the dusty road or over
the well-marked path on the right or left, and talking of everything
that came into their minds.</p>

<p>"How was it you happened to be passing over this road to-night
when I found myself in so great need of you?" asked Alvin.</p>

<p>"Me dad sint me this noon down to Cape Newagen to inquire for
some letters he didn't ixpect, and then to keep on to Squirrel
Island and buy him a pound of 'bacca and to be sure to walk all
the way and be back in time for supper, which I much fear me I
sha'n't be able to do."</p>

<p>"How did you make out?" asked the amused Alvin.</p>

<p>"As well as might be ixpected," gravely replied Mike, "being
there ain't any store at Cape Newagen and I should have to walk
under water for near two miles or swim to Squirrel Island, barring
the fact that I can't swim a stroke to save me life."</p>

<p>"What did your father mean by sending you on such a fool errand?"</p>

<p>Mike chuckled.</p>

<p>"It was a joke on me. I've tried to break him of the habit, but
he can't help indulging in the same whin he gits the chance. He
was so glad to have me wid him that he found an excuse for whaling
me afore last night and then played this trick on me."</p>

<p>"Didn't your mother tell you better?"</p>

<p>"Arrah, but she's worse nor him; she said I would enj'y the walk
and I may say I did though I couldn't extind the same as far as
they had planned for me. Can you suggist something I kin do, Alvin,
by the which I can git aven wid the owld folks fur the fun they've
had wid me?"</p>

<p>"I am not able to think of anything just now."</p>

<p>"Ah, I have it!" broke in the Irish youth, snapping his fingers.
"It has been the rule all me life that whin I got into a fight
I must report the whole sarcumstances of the same to dad. If I
licked the other chap, it was all right and he or mither give
me an extra pratie at dinner, but if I was bested, then dad made
himself tired using his strap over me back and legs. He's in high
favor of me exercising my fists on others, but never will agraa
that I don't do a hanus wrong when I git licked. 'It's such a
bad habit,' he explains, that it's his dooty to whale it out of
me."</p>

<p>"What has your fight to-night to do with playing a joke on him?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you see that I'll make him think fur a time that
it was mesilf that was knocked skyhigh, and after he's lambasted
me till he can't do so any more, and I kin hardly stand, you and
me will tell him the truth."</p>

<p>"Where will be the joke in that? It seems to me it will be wholly
on you."</p>

<p>"Don't ye observe that he and mither will feel so bad whin they
find how they have aboosed me that they'll give me two praties
instid of one and then I'll have the laugh on them."</p>

<p>"It takes an Irishman or Irish boy to think up such a joke as
that," was the comment of Alvin, as the two just then came in
sight of the small log structure in which Pat Murphy and his wife
made their home, while a light twinkled beyond from the windows
of the larger building, where Alvin lived with his parents during
the summer. A half mile to the south toward Cape Newagen was the
more moderate dwelling, during the sultry season, of Chester Haynes,
his chum from whom he had parted an hour or two previous to making
the acquaintance of Mike Murphy. As they drew near the structure,
Mike stepped in front and opened the door, with Alvin at his heels.
Within, sat the father calmly smoking his pipe, while his tall,
muscular but pleasant-faced wife by the table in the middle of
the room with spectacles on her nose was busily sewing. The light
was acetylene, furnished from the same source that supplied the
large bungalow only a few paces distant.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Pat, and the top of the evening to you, Mrs. Murphy.
You see I have brought Mike safely home to you."</p>

<p>Alvin was a favorite with the couple, who warmly greeted him.
The boy was fond of calling at the humble dwelling and chatting
with the two. Sometimes he took a meal with them, insisting that
the food was much better than was provided by the professional
chef in his own home. No surer means of reaching the heart of
the honest woman could have been thought of, and though she insisted
that the lad had kissed the blarney stone, she was none the less
pleased by his kind words.</p>

<p>"Mither, I'm that near starved," said Mike, dropping into the
nearest chair, "that I should perish if I had a dozen more paces
to walk."</p>

<p>"Yer supper has been waiting for more than an hour, and if ye'll
pass into the kitchen ye may eat your fill."</p>

<p>Mike took a step in the direction, but was halted by his father.</p>

<p>"Where is the 'bacca I ordered ye to bring from Squirrel Island?"</p>

<p>"They're out of the kind ye smoke, dad, and that which the storekeeper
showed me was that poor I wouldn't have anything to do wid the
same."</p>

<p>"And the litters at Cape Newagen?"</p>

<p>"They're expicting the one from King George that ye were looking
fur, but it won't be in until the next steamer."</p>
