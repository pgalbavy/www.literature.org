<p>Without a word&mdash;with merely a careless glance at Neeland, who
remained seated under the level threat of Ali Baba's pistol, the
big, handsome German removed his overcoat. Under it was another
coat. He threw this off in a brisk, businesslike manner, unbuckled
a brace of pistols, laid them aside, unwound from his body a long
silk rope ladder which dropped to the floor at Ilse Dumont's feet.</p>

<p>The girl had turned very pale. She stooped, picked up the silk
ladder, and, holding it in both hands, looked hard at Golden Beard.</p>

<p>"Johann," she said, "I gave my word of honour to this young man
that if he came here no harm would happen to him."</p>

<p>"I read the note you have shoved under his door," said Golden
Beard. "That iss why we are here, Karl and I."</p>

<p>Neeland remembered the wax in the keyhole then. He turned his
eyes on Ilse Dumont, curiously, less certain of her treachery
now.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Golden Beard continued busily unwinding things from
his apparently too stout person, and presently disengaged three
life-belts.</p>

<p>One of these he adjusted to his own person, then, putting on
his voluminous overcoat, took the pistol from Ali Baba, who, in
turn, adjusted one of the remaining life-belts to his body.</p>

<p>Neeland, deeply perplexed and uncomfortable, watched these operations
in silence, trying to divine some reason for them.</p>

<p>"Now, then!" said Golden Beard to the girl; and his voice sounded
cold and incisive in the silence.</p>

<p>"This is not the way to do it," she said in a low tone. "I gave
him my word of honour."</p>

<p>"You will be good enough to buckle on that belt," returned Golden
Beard, staring at her.</p>

<p>Slowly she bent over, picked up the life-belt, and, looping the
silk rope over her arm, began to put on the belt. Golden Beard,
impatient, presently came to her assistance; then he unhooked
from the wall a cloak and threw it over her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Now, Karl!" he said. "Shoot him dead if he stirs!" And he snatched
a sheet from the bed, tore it into strips, walked over to Neeland,
and deftly tied him hand and foot and gagged him.</p>

<p>Then Golden Beard and Ali Baba, between them, lifted the young
man and seated him on the iron bed and tied him fast to it.</p>

<p>"Go out on deck!" said Golden Beard to Ilse Dumont.</p>

<p>"Let me stay&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No! You have acted like a fool. Go to the lower deck where is
our accustomed rendezvous."</p>

<p>"I wish to remain, Johann. I shall not interfere&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Go to the lower deck, I tell you, and be ready to tie that rope
ladder!"</p>

<p>Ali Baba, down on his knees, had pulled out a steamer trunk from
under the bed, opened it, and was lifting out three big steel
cylinders.</p>

<p>These he laid on the bed in a row beside the tied man; and Golden
Beard, still facing Ilse Dumont, turned his head to look.</p>

<p>The instant his head was turned the girl snatched a pistol from
the brace of weapons on the washstand and thrust it under her
cloak. Neither Golden Beard nor Ali Baba noticed the incident;
the latter was busy connecting the three cylinders with coils
of wire; the former, deeply interested, followed the operation
for a moment or two, then walking over to the trunk, he lifted
from it a curious little clock with two dials and set it on the
railed shelf of glass above the washstand.</p>

<p>"Karl, haf you ship's time?"</p>

<p>Ali Baba paused to fish out his watch, and the two compared timepieces.
Then Golden Beard wound the clock, set the hands of one dial at
the time indicated by their watches; set the hands of the other
dial at 2:13; and Ali Baba, carrying a reel of copper wire from
the bed to the washstand, fastened one end of it to the mechanism
of the clock.</p>

<p>Golden Beard turned sharply on Ilse Dumont:</p>

<p>"I said go on deck! Did you not understand?"</p>

<p>The girl replied steadily:</p>

<p>"I understood that we had abandoned this idea for a better one."</p>

<p>"There iss no better one!"</p>

<p>"There <em>is</em>! Of what advantage would it be to blow up
the captain's cabin and the bridge when it is not certain that
the papers will be destroyed?"</p>

<p>"Listen once!" returned Golden Beard, wagging his finger in her
face:</p>

<p>"Cabin and bridge are directly above us and there remains not
a splinter large like a pin! I know. I know my bombs! I know&#11834;"</p>

<p>The soft voice of Ali Baba interrupted, and his shallow, lightish
eyes peered around at them:</p>

<p>"Eet ees veree excellent plan, Johann. We do not require these
papers; eet ees to destroy them we are mooch anxious"&mdash;he bent
a deathly stare on Neeland&mdash;"and this yoong gentleman who may
again annoy us." He nodded confidently to himself and continued
to connect the wires. "Yes, yes," he murmured absently, "eet ees
veree good plan&mdash;veree good plan to blow him into leetle pieces
so beeg as a pin."</p>

<p>"It is a clumsy plan!" said the girl, desperately. "There is
no need for wanton killing like this, when we can&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Killing?" repeated Golden Beard. "That makes nothing. This English
captain he iss of the naval reserve. <em>Und</em> this young man"&mdash;nodding
coolly toward Neeland&mdash;"knows too much already. That iss not wanton
killing. <em>Also!</em> You talk too much. Do you hear? We are
due to drop anchor about 2:30. God knows there will be enough
rushing to and fro at 2:13.</p>

<p>"Go on deck, I say, and fasten that rope ladder! Weishelm's fishing
smack will be watching; <em>und</em> if we do not swim for it
we are caught on board! <em>Und</em> that iss the end of it all
for us!"</p>

<p>"Johann," she began tremulously, "listen to me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Nein! Nein!</em> What for a <em>Frauenzimmer</em> haff we
here!" retorted Golden Beard, losing his patience and catching
her by the arm. "Go out und fix for us our ladder und keep it
coiled on the rail und lean ofer it like you was looking at those
stars once!"</p>

<p>He forced her toward the door; she turned, struggling, to confront
him:</p>

<p>"Then for God's sake, give this man a chance! Don't leave him
tied here to be blown to atoms! Give him a chance&mdash;anything except
this! Throw him out of the port, there!" She pointed at the closed
port, evaded Golden Beard, sprang upon the sofa, unscrewed the
glass cover, and swung it open.</p>

<p>The port was too small even to admit the passage of her own body;
she realised it; Golden Beard laughed and turned to examine the
result of Ali Baba's wiring.</p>

<p>For a second the girl gazed wildly around her, as though seeking
some help in her terrible dilemma, then she snatched up a bit
of the torn sheeting, tied it to the screw of the porthole cover,
and flung the end out where it fluttered in the darkness.</p>

<p>As she sprang to the floor Golden Beard swung round in renewed
anger at her for still loitering.</p>

<p>"Sacreminton!" he exclaimed. "It is time you do your part! Go
to your post then! We remain here until five minutes is left us.
Then we join you."</p>

<p>The girl nodded, turned to the door.</p>

<p>"Wait! You understand the plan?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You understand that you do not go overboard until we arrive,
no matter what happens?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He stood looking at her for a moment, then with a shrug he went
over and patted her shoulder.</p>

<p>"That's my brave girl! I also do not desire to kill anybody.
But when the Fatherland is in danger, then killing signifies nothing&mdash;is
of no consequence&mdash;pouf!&mdash;no lives are of importance then&mdash;not
even our own!" He laughed in a fashion almost kindly and clapped
her lightly once more on her shoulder: "Go, my child. The Fatherland
is in danger!"</p>

<p>She went, not looking back. He closed and locked the door behind
her and calmly turned to aid Ali Baba who was still fussing with
the wires. Presently, however, he mounted the bed where Neeland
sat tied and gagged; pulled from his pockets an auger with its
bit, a screw-eye, and block and tackle; and, standing on the bed,
began to bore a hole in the ceiling.</p>

<p>In a few moments he had fastened the screw-eye, rigged his block,
made a sling for his bombs out of a blanket, and had hoisted the
three cylinders up flat against the ceiling from whence the connecting
wires sagged over the foot of the bedstead to the alarm clock
on the washstand.</p>

<p>To give the clock more room on the glass shelf, Ali Baba removed
the toilet accessories and set them on the washstand; but he had
no room for a large jug of water, and, casting about for a place
to set it, noticed a railed bracket over the head of the bed,
and placed it there.</p>

<p>Then, apparently satisfied with his labours, he sat down Turk
fashion on the sofa, lighted a cigarette, selected a bonbon from
the box beside him, and calmly regaled himself.</p>

<p>Presently Golden Beard tied the cord which held up the sling
in which the bombs were slung against the ceiling. He fastened
it tightly to the iron frame of the bed, stepped back to view
the effect, then leisurely pulled out and filled his porcelain
pipe, and seated himself on the sofa beside Ali Baba.</p>

<p>Neither spoke; twice Golden Beard drew his watch from his waistcoat
pocket and compared it carefully with the dial of the alarm clock
on the washstand shelf. The third time he did this he tapped Ali
Baba on the shoulder, rose, knocked out his pipe and flung it
out of the open port.</p>

<p>Together they walked over to Neeland, examined the gag and ligatures
as impersonally as though the prisoner were not there, nodded
their satisfaction, turned off the electric light, and, letting
themselves out, locked the door on the outside.</p>

<p>It lacked five minutes of the time indicated on the alarm dial.</p>
