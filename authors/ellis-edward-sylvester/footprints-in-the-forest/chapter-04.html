<p>Deerfoot was by no means free from misgivings when he limped
from the woods, and, crossing the narrow space that lined the
stream, advanced to the camp-fire around which the warriors were
lounging.</p>

<p>Their appearance showed they were doughty fighters, and what
Hay-uta had told proved the same thing. But the Shawanoe had no
fear that they would rush upon and overwhelm him, and he had been
in too many perilous situations to hesitate before any duty.</p>

<p>The Indians turned their heads and surveyed him as he walked
unevenly forward, holding his bow in one hand, and making signs
of comity with the other. They showed no surprise, for such was
not their custom; but stoical and guarded as they were, Deerfoot
could see they felt considerable curiosity, and the fact that
he carried a bow instead of a gun must have struck them as singular,
for he came from the East, where the white men had their settlements,
and such weapons were easily obtained. These strange Indians had
firearms, though beyond them in the far West were thousands who
had never seen a pale-face.</p>

<p>Deerfoot's friendly salutations were answered in the same spirit,
and he shook hands with each of the eleven warriors, who seemed
accustomed to the civilized fashion. He seated himself a short
distance from the fire, so as to form one of the dozen which encircled
it. No food was offered the visitor, but when one of the strangers
handed him his long-stemmed pipe, Deerfoot accepted and indulged
in several whiffs from the red clay bowl.</p>

<p>The two warriors whom Hay-uta had pointed out as members of the
party that had bought Otto Relstaub from the Sauks, were objects
of much interest to the youth. They could not have observed it,
but he scanned them closely, and when he sat down, managed to
place himself between them&mdash;one being on the right, and the other
on the left.</p>

<p>Thus far, hosts and guest had spoken only by signs, but a surprise
came to Deerfoot when the warrior on his right addressed him in
language which he understood.</p>

<p>"My brother has journeyed far to visit the hunting grounds of
his brothers, the Pawnees."</p>

<p>The words of the warrior made known the fact that the party belonged
to the Pawnee tribe, but the amazing feature of his remark was
that it was made in Deerfoot's own tongue&mdash;the Shawanoe. The youth
turned like a flash the instant the first word fell upon his ear.
He knew well enough that no one around him belonged to that tribe,
but well might he wonder where this savage had gained his knowledge
of the language of the warlike people on the other side of the
Mississippi.</p>

<p>"My brother speaks with the Shawanoe tongue," said Deerfoot,
with no effort to hide his astonishment.</p>

<p>"When Lone Bear was a child," said the other, as if willing to
clear up the mystery, "he was taken across the great river into
the hunting grounds of the Shawanoes; he went with a party of
Pawnee hunters, but the Shawanoes killed them and took young Lone
Bear to their lodges."</p>

<p>"The Shawanoes are brave," remarked Deerfoot, his eyes kindling
with natural pride.</p>

<p>"Lone Bear staid many moons in the lodges of the Shawanoes, but
one night he rose from his sleep, slew the warrior and his squaw,
and made haste toward the great river; he swam across and hunted
for many suns till he found his people."</p>

<p>If this statement was fact, it told a striking story, but Deerfoot
doubted its truth. The reason was that, judging from the age of
the warrior, the exploit must have taken place when Deerfoot was
very young, if not before he was born. The capture of a Pawnee
youth and his escape in the manner named, formed an episode so
interesting that it would have been spoken of many times during
the early boyhood of Deerfoot, who ought to have heard of it,
but he was sure that this was the first time the story had fallen
on his ears. Deerfoot's sagacity told him that Lone Bear, as he
called himself, was the only Pawnee who understood a word of their
conversation; that much was evident to the eye. It might be, too,
that there was a good deal of truth in the words of the warrior.
At any rate, it was easy to test him.</p>

<p>"Did Lone Bear dwell with Allomaug?"</p>

<p>"Allomaug was a brave chief; he was the father of my brother
Deerfoot, who is fleeter of foot than the wild buck."</p>

<p>That settled it. The reader will remember that Allomaug was the
parent of the youth, and that he was a noted sachem among the
Shawanoes. Lone Bear had told such a straight story that Deerfoot
was convinced that he must have dwelt at one time among his people.</p>

<p>All this was supplemented by the fact that Deerfoot himself was
recognized and addressed by the name he had received from the
white people. The young Shawanoe half expected the other to make
some reference to the youth's escape from Waughtauk and his revengeful
warriors, but Lone Bear had no knowledge of that episode, which
took place long after his flight from the tribe. Deerfoot was
puzzled to know by what means the warrior identified him, when
he was certain he had never seen Lone Bear until he surveyed him
a short time before from the tree-top.</p>

<p>Deerfoot noticed that during their conversation, the others seemed
to listen with as much interest as the American Indians ever allow
themselves to show, and Lone Bear, now and then, turned and addressed
them in their own tongue. When he did so, he spoke to the whole
group and every word was strange to Deerfoot. While the latter
could understand a number of dialects used by the tribes west
as well as east of the Mississippi, he knew nothing of that of
the Pawnees.</p>

<p>"Why does Deerfoot wander so far from his hunting grounds?" asked
Lone Bear.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot has not wandered as far as the Pawnees," was the truthful
reply of the Shawanoe. "He once lived beyond the great river,
but he lives not there now."</p>

<p>The Pawnee looked as though he suspected Deerfoot was telling
him fiction, but he was too shrewd to express any such thought.</p>

<p>"Where are the companions of my brother?" was the pointed question
of Lone Bear.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is alone and his companion is the Great Spirit."</p>

<p>The reader will observe that the reply of the Shawanoe partook
of the nature of a falsehood, inasmuch as it was accepted by Lone
Bear (and such was Deerfoot's purpose), as a declaration that
he had traveled the whole distance alone. Enough has been told
to show the extreme conscientiousness of the young Shawanoe, and
no danger could lead him to recoil from duty. He had imperiled
himself many a time from that very motive, but he believed it
right to do his best to deceive Lone Bear. In fact, his visit
was of itself a piece of deception.</p>

<p>"Why does Deerfoot come to the camp of the Pawnees?" continued
Lone Bear, as though his guest was on the witness stand.</p>

<p>"Not many suns ago the Sauk warriors made captives of two pale-faced
youths; one of them has come back to his people, but the other
has not. He was a friend of Deerfoot; he went among the Sauks,
but his friend was not there; he was told that he had been bartered
for wampum and blankets and beads to the Pawnees. Can Lone Bear
tell Deerfoot of his friend?"</p>

<p>This was coming to the point at once, but it was the wiser course.
Deerfoot saw that any other statement he might make would be doubted,
as most probably was the explanation itself. He looked into the
face of Lone Bear, so as to study his expression, while answering
the question.</p>

<p>"The words of my brother sound strange to the ears of Lone Bear;
he has not seen his pale-faced friend."</p>

<p>"Has not <em>he</em> seen him?" immediately asked Deerfoot, pointing
to the Pawnee on the other side.</p>

<p>Lone Bear exchanged words for two or three minutes with the latter,
and then replied to the visitor.</p>

<p>"Eagle-of-the-Rocks has not seen the pale-face friend of my brother;
he and Lone Bear have staid with their Pawnee brothers; they have
met no pale-faces in many moons."</p>

<p>Here was a direct contradiction of what Hay-uta had told. It
might seem that the Sauk had mistaken the identity of Lone Bear
and Eagle-of-the-Rocks, and had there been but one of them in
question, it was possible; but Deerfoot was satisfied that no
such error had been made. Hay-uta was positive respecting both,
and he could not have committed a double error.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the study of the Pawnee's face convinced Deerfoot
that Lone Bear was lying to him, though to ordinary eyes the expression
of the warrior's face was like that of stone.</p>

<p>Why this falsehood should have been used was beyond the power
of the Shawanoe to guess. The band was so far from the settlements
that they could feel no fear from white men. Nevertheless, Deerfoot
was sure that, had Lone Bear chosen, he could have told every
thing necessary to know about Otto Relstaub.</p>

<p>Two answers to the query presented themselves: the poor lad had
either been slain or he had been turned over to the custody of
still another party of Indians. As for escape, <em>that</em> was
out of the question.</p>

<p>The probability that the Pawnees had put Otto to death occurred
to Deerfoot more than once, and while seated on the ground, he
had looked for signs that might show what had been done. There
were several scalps dangling at the girdles of the warriors, but
the hair of each was long, black and wiry, showing that it had
been torn from the crown of one of their own race. The yellow
tresses of the German lad would have been noticed at once by Deerfoot.</p>

<p>The latter was angered by the course of Lone Bear, who had told
an untruth, without, so far as Deerfoot could see, any proper
motive. So sure was the youth on this point, that he did not hesitate
to tell the Indian his belief.</p>

<p>"My brother, Lone Bear, has spoken, but with a double tongue.
He and Eagle-of-the-Rocks have seen my pale-faced friend; they
gave the beads and wampum for him; Deerfoot knows it; Deerfoot
has spoken."</p>

<p>Lone Bear, like all his race and the most of ours, was one of
those who looked upon the charge of falsehood (especially if true)
as a deadly insult. His dull, broad face seemed to crimson beneath
its paint, and turning partly toward the daring youth, he grasped
the handle of his knife.</p>

<p>"Dog of a Shawanoe! Who bade you come to the camp of the Pawnees?
Do you think we are squaws who are ill, that we will let a dog
bark at our heels without kicking him from our path?"</p>

<p>Lone Bear talked louder and faster with each word, until when
the last passed his lips, he was in a passion. He had faced clear
round, so that he glowered upon the youth. He now rose to his
feet and Deerfoot, seeing that trouble was at hand, did the same.
As he came up, he took care to limp painfully and to stand as
though unable to bear any part of his body's weight on the injured
leg.</p>

<p>"Lone Bear is as brave as the fawn that runs to its mother, when
it hears the cry of the hound; he is in the camp of his friends
and it makes him brave; but if he stood alone before Deerfoot,
then would his heart tremble and he would ask Deerfoot to spare
him!"</p>

<p>No more exasperating language could be framed than that which
was uttered by the young Shawanoe. He meant that it should fire
Lone Bear and he succeeded.</p>
