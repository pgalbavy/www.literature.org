A COTTAGER and his wife had a Hen that laid a golden egg every
day.  They supposed that the Hen must contain a great lump of
gold in its inside, and in order to get the gold they killed it. 
Having done so, they found to their surprise that the Hen
differed in no respect from their other hens.  The foolish pair,
thus hoping to become rich all at once, deprived themselves of
the gain of which they were assured day by day.
