<p>With rare wisdom Mike now gave an abrupt turn to the conversation.
Lowering his voice to a confidential tone, he asked:</p>

<p>"Does Mrs. McCaffry know anything of this?"</p>

<p>"If so, she hasn't given me any reason to suspect it," replied
Noxon, brightening up and seizing the straw held out to him. "I
told her I had met with an accident, and neither she nor her husband
asked a question. Their big hearts had no room for any feeling
other than of pity for the one who is not deserving of a particle
of it."</p>

<p>"She told me her husband works in Beartown. He wint there airly
this morning; he'll hear of the throuble at the post office and
the beefeater, as ye call him, will let everybody know he winged
the robber as he was running off. Did ye spake any caution to
the man before he lift this morning?"</p>

<p>"By good luck I thought of that. I asked him to make no mention
of my being at his house and he promised me he would not."</p>

<p>"Arrah, now, but that's good, as me dad says whin he tips up
the jug. All that ye have to do is to sit here and let Mrs. McCaffry
nurse that game leg till ye're able to thravel."</p>

<p>"Ah, if that was <em>all</em>! But I have a father and mother
whose hearts I am breaking. I have two younger brothers and a
sweet sister. What of <em>them</em>!" demanded Noxon almost fiercely.</p>

<p>"Ye have read the blissed story of the Prodigal Son, haven't
ye?"</p>

<p>"I am a thousandfold worse than that poor devil, who was simply
foolish."</p>

<p>"Do yer dad and mither know where ye are?"</p>

<p>"No; the one decent thing I did when I turned rascal was to change
my name. Orestes Noxon is a <em>nom de plume</em>."</p>

<p>"I don't know the fellow, but that shows, me bye, ye ain't such
a big fool as ye look. I'm beginning to have hope for ye."</p>

<p>A strange impulse came to Mike. It was to sing in a low, inexpressibly
sweet voice a single stanza of a familiar hymn, just loud enough
for the one auditor to hear. But he restrained himself, fearing
the effect upon him. The "fountains of the deep" were already
broken up, and the result might be regrettable. At that moment
a heavy tread sounded on the little steps outside, the door was
pushed inward, and the bulky form of the red-faced Mrs. McCaffry
filled the whole space. She now stepped awkwardly and ponderously
within.</p>

<p>"I begs that ye'll oxcoose me for not coming in wid this blarney
and inthrodoocing ye to aich ither. Have ye becoom acquainted?"</p>

<p>"It was an oversight which no Irish leddy should be guilty of,"
gravely replied Mike, "espicially whin the same is the fourth
cousin of me own mither. But ye have been away from the owld counthry
so long that ye have forgot a good deal, Aunt Maggie."</p>

<p>"I haven't furgot to resint the insult of being accused of relationship
wid the family of a spalpeen that is proud of the belaif. Whin
Tam coomes home to-night I'll explain the insult to him and lave
ye two to sittle the same."</p>

<p>"I'm thankful ye give me due notice, Aunt Maggie, so that I'll
have time to slip outside and climb a tree. Which reminds me to
ask how fur it is to Beartown."</p>

<p>"It's a good half mile from our home, and nigh about the same
distance back. Ye can figger out the rist for yersilf. Now, me
darlint," said she, coming to Noxon's chair and bending over with
her broad face radiating sympathy, "it's toime I had a look at
that leg, which would be a big ornamint if bestowed on the spalpeen
wid the freckles and rid hair."</p>

<p>"I don't think it can need any attention," said Noxon, pleased
to listen to the sparring of the two; "but you are the doctor."</p>

<p>Her hands were big and red, but no professional nurse could have
handled a patient with more gentle deftness. The linen was unwound,
and Mike for the first time inspected the wound inflicted by Gerald
Buxton with his shotgun. Little as the lad knew of such things,
he saw the hurt was not serious. With the removal of the leaden
pellets went the cause of irritation. The stumble in the woods
had aggravated the wound temporarily, but a rest for even a day
would render it safe for the young man to use the leg.</p>

<p>When the bandage had been repinned in place, Noxon felt that
he was being coddled more than was necessary. Dropping his foot
to the floor, he asked impatiently:</p>

<p>"What's the sense of my playing baby? I can walk as well as ever.
All I need is an ordinary cane. I think I'll stay with you till
after dinner, Aunt Maggie &mdash;I suppose I may call you that&mdash;and
then I'll vamose the ranch."</p>

<p>The woman stared wonderingly at Mike.</p>

<p>"Do ye know what he maanes by thim words? His mind I fear is
afther wandering."</p>

<p>"He wishes to say that ye and Tam have used him so well that
he will take delight in spinding siveral days wid ye."</p>

<p>"Ah, now his mind isn't afther wandering when he do spake that
way. All roight, me cherub, ye'll stay where you be till I give
you liberty to lave. Do ye mind that?"</p>

<p>And she shook her stubby finger in his face.</p>

<p>"Ah, what a tyrant you are, Aunt Maggie!"</p>

<p>"Phwat's that?" she demanded, straightening up. "Are ye calling
me out of me name?"</p>

<p>"You are the sweetest, kindest, most motherly woman and best
wife in the State of Maine."</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet and lumbered to the door.</p>

<p>"I haven't finished hanging me duds; whin I have I'll come back
and wipe out the insoolt ye have put upon me."</p>

<p>Noxon looked at Mike, who for the first time heard him laugh
with real jollity in his voice.</p>

<p>"What a big heart! How unutterably ashamed she makes me feel!
What can I weigh in the balance against her? She is pure gold
and I am base dross."</p>

<p>"Don't forgit to include mesilf wid the dross, me bye. Ye won't
be able to get away from this here place for a few days, I guess."</p>

<p>"Glad should I be if I could believe it safe to stay here."</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"Her husband has already heard all about last night's business."</p>

<p>"He promised ye to say nothing."</p>

<p>"When he did that, he had no suspicion of who I am. He will know
that I was one of the gang and his disposition will be far different
when he comes home to-night. In fact, he is likely to feel freed
of any promise he made me."</p>

<p>"Ye don't know a real Irishman. I can't say how he will be disposed,
but I know he'll kaap that pledge. Have no fear of that."</p>

<p>Noxon sitting back in his chair and apparently without any thought
of his injured leg, pondered earnestly over the situation.</p>

<p>"I am disposed to believe as you do, but that isn't my only danger."</p>

<p>"Phwat have ye in mind now?"</p>

<p>"There will be lots of people scouring the country for the three
persons who were in this business. We are so near Beartown that
some of them are likely to call here before the day is over."</p>

<p>"This house stands well back from the road wid only a path betwaan
the two. Why should anyone sarch here fur ye?"</p>

<p>"And why should they not? I shouldn't dare to stay here while
this is going on. However, you have shown such goodwill toward
me, I am willing to compromise. I'll stay till to-night and then
must make a change of base."</p>

<p>"Whither will ye go?"</p>

<p>"I haven't thought of that. My aim will be simply to get out
of the zone of danger, and what follows must depend upon circumstances."</p>

<p>"Noxy, will ye answer me one question?"</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "<em>GIVE ME YOUR HAND ON THAT</em>."]</p>

<p>"When ye lave here will ye be going back to Kit Woodford and
Graff Miller?"</p>

<p>The eyes of the young man flashed and, with an earnestness that
seemed deadly in its intensity, he said hoarsely:</p>

<p>"No! never! I'll die first!"</p>

<p>"Give me yer hand on that!"</p>

<p>It seemed as if the grip would crush the clasping fingers. The
pressure continued for nearly a minute, while the two looked fixedly
into each other's eyes. The pledge had been made and into each
heart stole the warm, irradiating glow that God gives to all the
children of men when they break loose from evil and cling to that
which is good.</p>

<p>And then the young man gave Mike his confidence. Aunt Maggie,
with a tact that was creditable to her, left them together most
of the forenoon and their talk was comparatively free from interruption.</p>

<p>As Noxon had hinted, he was the eldest son of parents who were
in prosperous circumstances. He did not give their name nor place
of residence, for it was unnecessary, but he admitted he had been
wayward from early boyhood. He longed for wild adventure, and
caused his family grief and anguish by his persistent wrongdoing.
Finally, when he had matriculated at Yale, he ran away from home,
taking what funds he could steal and fully resolved upon a life
of sin.</p>

<p>"If there were pirates to-day, as there used to be, I should
have striven to become the chief of a crew that flew the black
flag, but I had to give that up. Some humorist has said that when
a man starts to go to the devil he finds everything greased. So
it proved with me. I fell in with Graff Miller, who, though he
is about my age, has been a burglar for several years. I never
suspected it until he found I was hunting for such a companion,
when he told me of his partnership with Kit Woodford. In my vanity,
I had shown how easy it was for me to open one of the old-fashioned
combination safes, by detecting the working of the mechanism inside.
This made me invaluable to them, and they proposed that I should
become the third member of the gang. I jumped at the chance. Since
Miller told me they used aliases instead of their right names,
I took the one by which you know me.</p>

<p>"Their plan was to visit different points in the south of Maine,
where there had been a number of post office robberies, and use
me to open the safes. I was delighted with the scheme, and we
started in a few weeks ago. The Beartown post office was the third
visited&#11834;"</p>

<p>Just then a knock sounded on the door. Both were startled and
Mike called:</p>

<p>"Come in!"</p>

<p>The door was pushed inward and Stockham Calvert entered the room.</p>

<p>"Holy smoke!" exclaimed Mike, "as Father Malone said when he
saw his church burning."</p>
