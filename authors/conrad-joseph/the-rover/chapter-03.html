<p>The affectation common to seamen of never being surprised at
anything that sea or land can produce had become in Peyrol a second
nature. Having learned from childhood to suppress every sign of
wonder before all extraordinary sights and events, all strange
people, all strange customs, and the most alarming phenomena of
nature (as manifested, for instance, in the violence of volcanoes
or the fury of human beings), he had really become indifferent&mdash;or
only perhaps utterly inexpressive. He had seen so much that was
bizarre or atrocious, and had heard so many astounding tales,
that his usual mental reaction before a new experience was generally
formulated in the words "J’en ai vu bien d’autres." The last thing
which had touched him with the panic of the supernatural had been
the death under a heap of rags of that gaunt, fierce woman, his
mother; and the last thing that had nearly overwhelmed him at
the age of twelve with another kind of terror was the riot of
sound and the multitude of mankind on the quays in Marseilles,
something perfectly inconceivable from which he had instantly
taken refuge behind a stack of wheat sacks after having been chased
ashore from the tartane. He had remained there quaking till a
man in a cocked hat and with a sabre at his side (the boy had
never seen either such a hat or such a sabre in his life) had
seized him by the arm close to the armpit and had hauled him out
from there; a man who might have been an ogre (only Peyrol had
never heard of an ogre), but at any rate in his own way was alarming
and wonderful beyond anything he could have imagined&mdash;if the faculty
of imagination had been developed in him then. No doubt all this
was enough to make one die of fright, but that possibility never
occurred to him. Neither did he go mad; but being only a child,
he had simply adapted himself, by means of passive acquiescence,
to the new and inexplicable conditions of life in something like
twenty-four hours. After that initiation the rest of his existence,
from flying fishes to whales and on to black men and coral reefs,
to decks running with blood, and thirst in open boats, was comparatively
plain sailing. By the time he had heard of a Revolution in France
and of certain Immortal Principles causing the death of many people,
from the mouths of seamen and travellers and year-old gazettes
coming out of Europe, he was ready to appreciate contemporary
history in his own particular way. Mutiny and throwing officers
overboard. He had seen that twice and he was on a different side
each time. As to this upset, he took no side. It was too far&mdash;too
big&mdash;also not distinct enough. But he acquired the revolutionary
jargon quickly enough and used it on occasions, with secret contempt.
What he had gone through, from a spell of crazy love for a yellow
girl to the experience of treachery from a bosom friend and shipmate
(and both those things Peyrol confessed to himself he could never
hope to understand), with all the graduations of varied experience
of men and passions between, had put a drop of universal scorn,
a wonderful sedative, into the strange mixture which might have
been called the soul of the returned Peyrol.</p>

<p>Therefore he not only showed no surprise but did not feel any
when he beheld the master, in the right of his wife, of the Escampobar
Farm. The homeless Peyrol, sitting in the bare salle with a bottle
of wine before him, was in the act of raising the glass to his
lips when the man entered, ex-orator in the sections, leader of
red-capped mobs, hunter of the ci-devants and priests, purveyor
of the guillotine, in short a blood-drinker. And Citizen Peyrol,
who had never been nearer than six thousand miles as the crow
flies to the realities of the Revolution, put down his glass and
in his deep unemotional voice said: "Salut."</p>

<p>The other returned a much fainter "Salut," staring at the stranger
of whom he had heard already. His almond-shaped, soft eyes were
noticeably shiny and so was to a certain extent the skin on his
high but rounded cheekbones, coloured red like a mask of which
all the rest was but a mass of clipped chestnut hair growing so
thick and close around the lips as to hide altogether the design
of the mouth which, for all Citizen Peyrol knew, might have been
of a quite ferocious character. A careworn forehead and a perpendicular
nose suggested a certain austerity proper to an ardent patriot.
He held in his hand a long bright knife which he laid down on
one of the tables at once. He didn’t seem more than thirty years
old, a well-made man of medium height, with a lack of resolution
in his bearing. Something like disillusion was suggested by the
set of his shoulders. The effect was subtle, but Peyrol became
aware of it while he explained his case and finished the tale
by declaring that he was a seaman of the Republic and that he
had always done his duty before the enemy.</p>

<p>The blood-drinker had listened profoundly. The high arches of
his eyebrows gave him an astonished look. He came close up to
the table and spoke in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>"You may have! But you may all the same be corrupt. The seamen
of the Republic were eaten up with corruption paid for with the
gold of the tyrants. Who would have guessed it? They all talked
like patriots. And yet the English entered the harbour and landed
in the town without opposition. The armies of the Republic drove
them out, but treachery stalks in the land, it comes up out of
the ground, it sits at our hearthstones, lurks in the bosom of
the representatives of the people, of our fathers, of our brothers.
There was a time when civic virtue flourished, but now it has
got to hide its head. And I will tell you why: there has not been
enough killing. It seems as if there could never be enough of
it. It’s discouraging. Look what we have come to."</p>

<p>His voice died in his throat as though he had suddenly lost confidence
in himself.</p>

<p>"Bring another glass, citoyen," said Peyrol, after a short pause,
"and let’s drink together. We will drink to the confusion of traitors.
I detest treachery as much as any man, but...."</p>

<p>He waited till the other had returned, then poured out the wine,
and after they had touched glasses and half emptied them, he put
down his own and continued:</p>

<p>"But you see I have nothing to do with your politics. I was at
the other side of the world, therefore you can’t suspect me of
being a traitor. You showed no mercy, you other sans-culottes,
to the enemies of the Republic at home, and I killed her enemies
abroad far away. You were cutting off heads without much compunction...."</p>

<p>The other most unexpectedly shut his eyes for a moment, then
opened them very wide. "Yes, yes," he assented very low. "Pity
may be a crime."</p>

<p>"Yes. And I knocked the enemies of the Republic on the head whenever
I had them before me without inquiring about the number. It seems
to me that you and I ought to get on together."</p>

<p>The master of Escampobar farmhouse murmured, however, that in
times like these nothing could be taken as proof positive. It
behoved every patriot to nurse suspicion in his breast. No sign
of impatience escaped Peyrol. He was rewarded for his self-restraint
and the unshaken good-humour with which he had conducted the discussion
by carrying his point. Citizen Scevola Bron (for that appeared
to be the name of the master of the farm), an object of fear and
dislike to the other inhabitants of the Giens peninsula, might
have been influenced by a wish to have someone with whom he could
exchange a few words from time to time. No villagers ever came
up to the farm, or were likely to, unless perhaps in a body and
animated with hostile intentions. They resented his presence in
their part of the world sullenly.</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?" was the last question he asked.</p>

<p>"I left Toulon two days ago."</p>

<p>Citizen Scevola struck the table with his fist, but this manifestation
of energy was very momentary.</p>

<p>"And that was the town of which by a decree not a stone upon
another was to be left," he complained, much depressed.</p>

<p>"Most of it is still standing," Peyrol assured him calmly. "I
don’t know whether it deserved the fate you say was decreed for
it. I was there for the last month or so and I know it contains
some good patriots. I know because I made friends with them all."
Thereupon Peyrol mentioned a few names which the retired sans-culotte
greeted with a bitter smile and an ominous silence, as though
the bearers of them had been only good for the scaffold and the
guillotine.</p>

<p>"Come along and I will show you the place where you will sleep,"
he said with a sigh, and Peyrol was only too ready. They entered
the kitchen together. Through the open back door a large square
of sunshine fell on the floor of stone flags. Outside one could
see quite a mob of expectant chickens, while a yellow hen postured
on the very doorstep, darting her head right and left with affectation.
An old woman holding a bowl full of broken food put it down suddenly
on a table and stared. The vastness and cleanliness of the place
impressed Peyrol favourably.</p>

<p>"You will eat with us here," said his guide, and passed without
stopping into a narrow passage giving access to a steep flight
of stairs. Above the first landing a narrow spiral staircase led
to the upper part of the farmhouse; and when the sans-culotte
flung open the solid plank door at which it ended he disclosed
to Peyrol a large low room containing a four-poster bedstead piled
up high with folded blankets and spare pillows. There were also
two wooden chairs and a large oval table.</p>

<p>"We could arrange this place for you," said the master, "but
I don’t know what the mistress will have to say," he added.</p>

<p>Peyrol, struck by the peculiar expression of his face, turned
his head and saw the girl standing in the doorway. It was as though
she had floated up after them, for not the slightest sound of
rustle or footfall had warned Peyrol of her presence. The pure
complexion of her white cheeks was set off brilliantly by her
coral lips and the bands of raven black hair only partly covered
by a muslin cap trimmed with lace. She made no sign, uttered no
sound, behaved exactly as if there had been nobody in the room;
and Peyrol suddenly averted his eyes from that mute and unconscious
face with its roaming eyes.</p>

<p>In some way or other, however, the sans-culotte seemed to have
ascertained her mind, for he said in a final tone:</p>

<p>"That’s all right then," and there was a short silence, during
which the woman shot her dark glances all round the room again
and again, while on her lips there was a half-smile, not so much
absent-minded as totally unmotived, which Peyrol observed with
a side glance, but could not make anything of. She did not seem
to know him at all.</p>

<p>"You have a view of salt water on three sides of you," remarked
Peyrol’s future host.</p>

<p>The farmhouse was a tall building, and this large attic with
its three windows commanded on one side the view of Hyères Roadstead
on the first plan, with further blue undulations of the coast
as far as Fréjus; and on the other the vast semicircle of barren
high hills, broken by the entrance to Toulon harbour guarded by
forts and batteries, and ending in Cape Cépet, a squat mountain,
with sombre folds and a base of brown rocks, with a white spot
gleaming on the very summit of it, a ci-devant shrine dedicated
to Our Lady, and a ci-devant place of pilgrimage. The noonday
glare seemed absorbed by the gemlike surface of the sea perfectly
flawless in the invincible depth of its colour.</p>

<p>"It’s like being in a lighthouse," said Peyrol. "Not a bad place
for a seaman to live in." The sight of the sails dotted about
cheered his heart. The people of landsmen with their houses and
animals and activities did not count. What made for him the life
of any strange shore were the craft that belonged to it: canoes,
catamarans, ballahous, praus, lorchas, mere dug-outs, or even
rafts of tied logs with a bit of mat for a sail from which naked
brown men fished along stretches of white sand crushed under the
tropical skyline, sinister in its glare and with a thunder-cloud
crouching on the horizon. But here he beheld a perfect serenity,
nothing sombre on the shore, nothing ominous in the sunshine.
The sky rested lightly on the distant and vaporous outline of
the hills; and the immobility of all things seemed poised in the
air like a gay mirage. On this tideless sea several tartanes lay
becalmed in the Petite Passe between Porquerolles and Cape Esterel,
yet theirs was not the stillness of death but of light slumber,
the immobility of a smiling enchantment, of a Mediterranean fair
day, breathless sometimes but never without life. Whatever enchantment
Peyrol had known in his wanderings it had never been so remote
from all thoughts of strife and death, so full of smiling security,
making all his past appear to him like a chain of lurid days and
sultry nights. He thought he would never want to get away from
it, as though he had obscurely felt that his old rover’s soul
had been always rooted there. Yes, this was the place for him;
not because expediency dictated, but simply because his instinct
of rest had found its home at last.</p>

<p>He turned away from the window and found himself face to face
with the sans-culotte, who had apparently come up to him from
behind, perhaps with the intention of tapping him on the shoulder,
but who now turned away his head. The young woman had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Tell me, patron," said Peyrol, "is there anywhere near this
house a little dent in the shore with a bit of beach in it perhaps
where I could keep a boat?"</p>

<p>"What do you want a boat for?"</p>

<p>"To go fishing when I have a fancy to," answered Peyrol curtly.</p>

<p>Citizen Bron, suddenly subdued, told him that what he wanted
was to be found a couple of hundred yards down the hill from the
house. The coast, of course, was full of indentations, but this
was a perfect little pool. And the Toulon blood-drinker’s almond-shaped
eyes became strangely sombre as they gazed at the attentive Peyrol.
A perfect little pool, he repeated, opening from a cove that the
English knew well. He paused. Peyrol observed without much animosity
but in a tone of conviction that it was very difficult to keep
off the English whenever there was a bit of salt water anywhere;
but what could have brought English seamen to a spot like this
he couldn’t imagine.</p>

<p>"It was when their fleet first came here," said the patriot in
a gloomy voice, "and hung round the coast before the anti-revolutionary
traitors let them into Toulon, sold the sacred soil of their country
for a handful of gold. Yes, in the days before the crime was consummated
English officers used to land in that cove at night and walk up
to this very house."</p>

<p>"What audacity!" commented Peyrol, who was really surprised.
"But that’s just like what they are." Still, it was hard to believe.
But wasn’t it only a tale?</p>

<p>The patriot flung one arm up in a strained gesture. "I swore
to its truth before the tribunal," he said. "It was a dark story,"
he cried shrilly, and paused. "It cost her father his life," he
said in a low voice ... "her mother too&mdash;but the country was in
danger," he added still lower.</p>

<p>Peyrol walked away to the western window and looked towards Toulon.
In the middle of the great sheet of water within Cape Cicié a
tall two-decker lay becalmed and the little dark dots on the water
were her boats trying to tow her head round the right way. Peyrol
watched them for a moment, and then walked back to the middle
of the room.</p>

<p>"Did you actually drag him from this house to the guillotine?"
he asked in his unemotional voice.</p>

<p>The patriot shook his head thoughtfully, with downcast eyes.
"No, he came over to Toulon just before the evacuation, this friend
of the English ... sailed over in a tartane he owned that is still
lying here at the Madrague. He had his wife with him. They came
over to take home their daughter, who was living then with some
skulking old nuns. The victorious Republicans were closing in
and the slaves of tyranny had to fly."</p>

<p>"Came to fetch their daughter," mused Peyrol. "Strange, that
guilty people should...."</p>

<p>The patriot looked up fiercely. "It was justice," he said loudly.
"They were anti-revolutionists, and if they had never spoken to
an Englishman in their life the atrocious crime was on their heads."</p>

<p>"H’m, stayed too long for their daughter," muttered Peyrol. "And
so it was you who brought her home."</p>

<p>"I did," said the patron. For a moment his eyes evaded Peyrol’s
investigating glance, but in a moment he looked straight into
his face. "No lessons of base superstition could corrupt her soul,"
he declared with exaltation. "I brought home a patriot."</p>

<p>Peyrol, very calm, gave him a hardly perceptible nod. "Well,"
he said, "all this won’t prevent me sleeping very well in this
room. I always thought I would like to live in a lighthouse when
I got tired of roving about the seas. This is as near a lighthouse
lantern as can be. You will see me with all my little affairs
to-morrow," he added, moving towards the stairs. "Salut, citoyen."</p>

<p>There was in Peyrol a fund of self-command amounting to placidity.
There were men living in the East who had no doubt whatever that
Peyrol was a calmly terrible man. And they would quote illustrative
instances which from their own point of view were simply admirable.
But all Peyrol had ever done was to behave rationally, as it seemed
to him, in all sorts of dangerous circumstances without ever being
led astray by the nature, or the cruelty, or the danger of any
given situation. He adapted himself to the character of the event
and to the very spirit of it, with a profound responsive feeling
of a particularly unsentimental kind. Sentiment in itself was
an artificiality of which he had never heard and if he had seen
it in action would have appeared to him too puzzling to make anything
of. That sort of genuineness in acceptance made him a satisfactory
inmate of the Escampobar Farm. He duly turned up with all his
cargo, as he called it, and was met at the door of the farmhouse
itself by the young woman with the pale face and wandering eyes.
Nothing could hold her attention for long amongst her familiar
surroundings. Right and left and far away beyond you, she seemed
to be looking for something while you were talking to her, so
that you doubted whether she could follow what you said. But as
a matter of fact she had all her wits about her. In the midst
of this strange search for something that was not there she had
enough detachment to smile at Peyrol. Then, withdrawing into the
kitchen, she watched, as much as her restless eyes could watch
anything, Peyrol’s cargo and Peyrol himself passing up the stairs.</p>

<p>The most valuable part of Peyrol’s cargo being strapped to his
person, the first thing he did after being left alone in that
attic room which was like the lantern of a lighthouse was to relieve
himself of the burden and lay it on the foot of the bed. Then
he sat down, and leaning his elbow far on the table he contemplated
it with a feeling of complete relief. That plunder had never burdened
his conscience. It had merely on occasion oppressed his body;
and if it had at all affected his spirits it was not by its secrecy
but by its mere weight, which was inconvenient, irritating, and
towards the end of a day altogether insupportable. It made a free-limbed,
deep-breathing sailor-man feel like a mere overloaded animal,
thus extending whatever there was of compassion in Peyrol’s nature
towards the four-footed beasts that carry men’s burdens on the
earth. The necessities of a lawless life had taught Peyrol to
be ruthless, but he had never been cruel.</p>

<p>Sprawling in the chair, stripped to the waist, robust and grey-haired,
his head with a Roman profile propped up on a mighty and tattooed
forearm, he remained at ease, with his eyes fixed on his treasure
with an air of meditation. Yet Peyrol was not meditating (as a
superficial observer might have thought) on the best place of
concealment. It was not that he had not had a great experience
of that sort of property which had always melted so quickly through
his fingers. What made him meditative was its character, not of
a share of a hard-won booty in toil, in risk, in danger, in privation,
but of a piece of luck personally his own. He knew what plunder
was and how soon it went; but this lot had come to stay. He had
it with him, away from the haunts of his lifetime, as if in another
world altogether. It couldn’t be drunk away, gambled away, squandered
away in any sort of familiar circumstances, or even given away.
In that room, raised a good many feet above his revolutionized
native land where he was more of a stranger than anywhere else
in the world, in this roomy garret full of light and as it were
surrounded by the sea, in a great sense of peace and security,
Peyrol didn’t see why he should bother his head about it so very
much. It came to him that he had never really cared for any plunder
that fell into his hands. No, never for any. And to take particular
care of this for which no one would seek vengeance or attempt
recovery would have been absurd. Peyrol got up and opened his
big sandalwood chest secured with an enormous padlock, part, too,
of some old plunder gathered in a Chinese town in the Gulf of
Tonkin, in company of certain Brothers of the Coast, who having
boarded at night a Portuguese schooner and sent her crew adrift
in a boat, had taken a cruise on their own account, years and
years and years ago. He was young then, very young, and the chest
fell to his share because nobody else would have anything to do
with the cumbersome thing, and also for the reason that the metal
of the curiously wrought thick hoops that strengthened it was
not gold but mere brass. He, in his innocence, had been rather
pleased with the article. He had carried it about with him into
all sorts of places, and also he had left it behind him&mdash;once
for a whole year in a dark and noisome cavern on a certain part
of the Madagascar coast. He had left it with various native chiefs,
with Arabs, with a gambling-hell keeper in Pondicherry, with his
various friends in short, and even with his enemies. Once he had
lost it altogether.</p>

<p>That was on the occasion when he had received a wound which laid
him open and gushing like a slashed wine-skin. A sudden quarrel
broke out in a company of Brothers over some matter of policy
complicated by personal jealousies, as to which he was as innocent
as a babe unborn. He never knew who gave him the slash. Another
Brother, a chum of his, an English boy, had rushed in and hauled
him out of the fray, and then he had remembered nothing for days.
Even now when he looked at the scar he could not understand why
he had not died. That occurrence, with the wound and the painful
convalescence, was the first thing that sobered his character
somewhat. Many years afterwards, when in consequence of his altered
views of mere lawlessness he was serving as quartermaster on board
the <em>Hirondelle</em>, a comparatively respectable privateer,
he caught sight of that chest again in Port Louis, of all places
in the world, in a dark little den of a shop kept by a lone Hindoo.
The hour was late, the side street was empty, and so Peyrol went
in there to claim his property, all fair, a dollar in one hand
and a pistol in the other, and was entreated abjectly to take
it away. He carried off the empty chest on his shoulder, and that
same night the privateer went to sea; then only he found time
to ascertain that he had made no mistake, because, soon after
he had got it first, he had, in grim wantonness, scratched inside
the lid, with the point of his knife, the rude outline of a skull
and cross-bones into which he had rubbed afterwards a little Chinese
vermilion. And there it was, the whole design, as fresh as ever.</p>

<p>In the garret full of light of the Escampobar farmhouse the grey-haired
Peyrol opened the chest, took all the contents out of it, laying
them neatly on the floor, and spread his treasure&mdash;pockets downwards&mdash;over
the bottom, which it filled exactly. Busy on his knees he repacked
the chest. A jumper or two, a fine cloth jacket, a remnant piece
of Madapolam muslin, costly stuff for which he had no use in the
world&mdash;a quantity of fine white shirts. Nobody would dare to rummage
in his chest, he thought, with the assurance of a man who had
been feared in his time. Then he rose, and looking round the room
and stretching his powerful arms, he ceased to think of the treasure,
of the future and even of to-morrow, in the sudden conviction
that he could make himself very comfortable there.</p>
