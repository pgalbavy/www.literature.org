<p>With a proud air she crushingly departed, returning to her own
home far from dissatisfied with what she had accomplished. Moreover,
she began to expand with the realization of a new importance;
and she was gratified with the effect upon her parents, at dinner
that evening, when she informed them that she had written a poem,
which was to be published in the prospective first number of <em>The
North End Daily Oriole</em>.</p>

<p>"Written a <em>poem</em>?" said her father. "Well, I declare!
Why, that's remarkable, Florence!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad the boys were nice about it," said her mother. "I should
have feared they couldn't appreciate it, after being so cross
to you about letting you have anything to do with the printing-press.
They must have thought it was a very good poem."</p>

<p>"Where is the poem, Florence?" Mr. Atwater asked. "Let's read
it and see what our little girl can do when she really tries."</p>

<p>Unfortunately Florence had not a copy, and when she informed
her father of this fact, he professed himself greatly disappointed
as well as eager for the first appearance of <em>The Oriole</em>,
that he might felicitate himself upon the evidence of his daughter's
heretofore unsuspected talent. Florence was herself anxious for
the newspaper's d√©but, and she made her anxiety so clear to Atwater
&amp; Rooter, Owners &amp; Propreitors, every afternoon after
school, during the following week, that by Thursday further argument
and repartee on their part were felt to be indeed futile; and
in order to have a little peace around there, they carried her
downstairs. At least, they defined their action as "carrying,"
and, having deposited her in the yard, they were obliged to stand
guard at the doors, which they closed and contrived to hold against
her until her strength was worn out for that day.</p>

<p>Florence consoled herself. During the week she dropped in on
all the members of "the family"&mdash;her grandfather, uncles and aunts
and cousins, her great-aunts and great-uncles&mdash;and in each instance,
after no protracted formal preliminaries, lightly remarked that
she wrote poetry now; her first to appear in the forthcoming <em>Oriole</em>.
And when Great-Aunt Carrie said, "Why, Florence, you're wonderful!
I couldn't write a poem to save my life. I never <em>could</em>
see how they do it," Florence laughed, made a deprecatory little
side motion with her head, and responded, "Why, Aunt Carrie, that's
nothing! It just kind of comes to you."</p>

<p>This also served as her explanation when some of her school friends
expressed their admiration, after being told the news in confidence;
though to one of the teachers she said, smiling ruefully, as in
remembrance of midnight oil, "It <em>does</em> take work, of course!"</p>

<p>When opportunity offered, upon the street, she joined people
she knew (or even rather distant acquaintances) to walk with them
a little way and lead the conversation to the subject of poetry,
including her own contribution to that art. Altogether, if Florence
was not in a fair way to become a poetic celebrity it was not
her own fault but entirely that of <em>The North End Daily Oriole</em>,
which was to make its appearance on Saturday, but failed to do
so on account of too much enthusiasm on the part of Atwater &amp;
Rooter in manipulating the printing-press. It broke, had to be
repaired; and Florence, her nerves upset by the accident, demanded
her money back. This was impossible, and the postponement proved
to be but an episode; moreover, it gave her time to let more people
know of the treat that was coming.</p>

<p>Among these was Noble Dill. Until the Friday following her disappointment
she had found no opportunity to acquaint her Very Ideal with the
news; and but for an encounter partly due to chance, he might
not have heard of it. A sentimental enrichment of colour in her
cheeks was the result of her catching sight of him, as she was
on the point of opening and entering her own front door, that
afternoon, on her return from school. He was passing the house,
walking somewhat dreamily.</p>

<p>Florence stepped into the sheltering vestibule, peeping round
it with earnest eyes to watch him as he went by; obviously he
had taken no note of her. Satisfied of this, she waited until
he was at a little distance, then ran lightly down to the gate,
hurried after him and joined him.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Dill!" she exclaimed, in her mother's most polished
manner. "How supprising to see <em>you</em>! I presume as we both
happen to be walking the same direction we might just's well keep
together."</p>

<p>"Surprising to see me?" Noble said vaguely. "I haven't been away
anywhere in particular, Florence." Then, at a thought, he brightened.
"I'm glad to see you, Florence. Do you know if any of your family
or relatives have heard when your Aunt Julia is coming home?"</p>

<p>"Aunt Julia? She's out of town," said Florence. "She's visiting
different people she used to know when she was away at school."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," Mr. Dill returned. "But she's been gone six weeks."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't believe it's that long," Florence said casually;
then with more earnestness: "Mr. Dill, I was goin' to ask you
somep'n&mdash;it's kind of a funny question for <em>me</em> to ask,
but&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, she has," Noble interrupted, not aware that his remark
was an interruption. "Oh, yes, she has!" he said. "It was six
weeks day-before-yesterday afternoon. I saw your father downtown
this morning, and he said he didn't know that any of the family
had heard just when she was coming home. I thought maybe some
of your relatives had a letter from her by this afternoon's mail,
perhaps."</p>

<p>"I guess not," said Florence. "Mr. Dill, there was a question
I thought I'd ask you. It's kind of a funny question for <em>me</em>&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Are you <em>sure</em> nobody's heard from your Aunt Julia to-day?"
Noble insisted.</p>

<p>"I guess they haven't. Mr. Dill, I was goin' to ask you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It's strange," he murmured, "I don't see how people can enjoy
visits that long. I should think they'd get anxious about what
might happen at home."</p>

<p>"Oh, grandpa's all right; he says he kind of likes to have the
house nice and quiet to himself; and anyway Aunt Julia enjoys
visiting," Florence assured him. "Aunt Fanny saw a newspaper from
one the places where Aunt Julia's visiting her school room-mate.
It had her picture in it and called her 'the famous Northern Beauty';
it was down South somewhere. Well, Mr. Dill, I was just sayin'
I believe I'd ask you&#11834;"</p>

<p>But a sectional rancour seemed all at once to affect the young
man. "Oh, yes. I heard about that," he said. "Your Aunt Fanny
lent my mother the newspaper. Those people in <em>that</em> part
of the country&mdash;well&#11834;" He paused, remembering that it was only
Florence he addressed; and he withheld from utterance his opinion
that the Civil War ought to be fought all over again. "Your father
said your grandfather hadn't heard from her for several days,
and even then she hadn't said when she was coming home."</p>

<p>"No, I expect she didn't," said Florence. "Mr. Dill, I was goin'
to ask you somep'n&mdash;it's kind of a queer kind of question for
<em>me</em> to ask, I guess&#11834;" She paused. However, he did not
interrupt her, seeming preoccupied with gloom; whereupon Florence
permitted herself a deprecatory laugh, and continued, "It might
be you'd answer yes, or it might be you'd answer no; but anyway
I was goin' to ask you&mdash;it's kind of a funny question for <em>me</em>
to ask, I expect&mdash;but do you like poetry?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Well, as things have turned out lately I guess it's kind of
a funny question, Mr. Dill, but do you like poetry?"</p>

<p>Noble's expression took on a coldness; for the word brought to
his mind a thought of Newland Sanders. "Do I like poetry?" said
Noble. "No, I don't."</p>

<p>Florence was momentarily discouraged; but at her age people usually
possess an invaluable faculty, which they lose later in life;
and it is a pity that they do lose it. At thirteen&mdash;especially
the earlier months of thirteen&mdash;they are still able to set aside
and dismiss from their minds almost any facts, no matter how audibly
those facts have asked for recognition. Children superbly allow
themselves to become deaf, so to speak, to undesirable circumstances;
most frequently, of course, to undesirable circumstances in the
way of parental direction; so that fathers, mothers, nurses, or
governesses, not comprehending that this mental deafness is for
the time being entirely genuine, are liable to hoarseness both
of throat and temper. Thirteen is an age when the fading of this
gift or talent, one of the most beautiful of childhood, begins
to impair its helpfulness under the mistaken stress of discipline;
but Florence retained something of it. In a moment or two Noble
Dill's disaffection toward poetry was altogether as if it did
not exist.</p>

<p>She coughed, inclined her head a little to one side, in her mother's
manner of politeness to callers, and, repeating her deprecatory
laugh, remarked: "Well, of course it's kind of a funny question
for <em>me</em> to ask, of course."</p>

<p>"What is, Florence?" Noble inquired absently.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what I was saying was that 'course it's sort of queer
<em>me</em> askin' if you liked poetry, of course, on account
of my <em>writing</em> poetry the way I do now."</p>

<p>She looked up at him with a bright readiness to respond modestly
to whatever exclamation his wonder should dictate; but Noble's
attention had straggled again.</p>

<p>"Has she written your mother lately?" he asked.</p>

<p>Florence's expression denoted a mental condition slightly disturbed.
"No," she said. "It's goin' to be printed in <em>The North End
Daily Oriole</em>."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"My poem. It's about a vast amen&mdash;anyhow, that's proba'ly the
best thing in it, I guess&mdash;and they're goin' to have it out to-morrow,
or else they'll have to settle with <em>me</em>; that's one thing
certain! I'll bring one over to your house and leave it at the
door for you, Mr. Dill."</p>

<p>Noble had but a confused notion of what she thus generously promised.
However, he said, "Thank you," and nodded vaguely.</p>

<p>"Of course, I don't know as it's so awful good," Florence admitted
insincerely. "The family all seem to think it's something pretty
much; but I don't know if it is or not. <em>Really</em>, I don't!"</p>

<p>"No," said Noble, still confused. "I suppose not."</p>

<p>"I'm half way through another one I think myself'll be a good
deal better. I'm not goin' as fast with it as I did with the other
one, and I expect it'll be quite a ways ahead of this one." She
again employed the deprecatory little laugh. "I don't know how
I do it, myself. The family all think it's sort of funny I don't
know how I do it, myself; but that's the way it is. They all say
if they could do it they're sure they'd know how they did it;
but I guess they're wrong. I presume if you can do it, why, it
just <em>comes</em> to you. Don't you presume that's the way it
is, Mr. Dill?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>guess so." They had reached his gate, and he stopped.
"You're sure none of your family have heard anything to-day?"
he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"From Aunt Julia? I don't think they have."</p>

<p>He sighed, and opened the gate. "Well, good evening, Florence."</p>

<p>"Good evening." Her eyes followed him wistfully as he passed
within the enclosure; then she turned and walked quickly toward
her own home; but at the corner of the next fence she called back
over her shoulder, "I'll leave it with your mother for you, if
you're not home when I bring it."</p>

<p>"What?" he shouted, from his front door.</p>

<p>"I'll leave it with your <em>mother</em>."</p>

<p>"Leave what?"</p>

<p>"The <em>poem</em>!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Noble. "Thanks!"</p>

<p>But when his mother handed him a copy of the first issue of <em>The
North End Daily Oriole</em>, the next day, when he came home to
lunch, he read it without edification; there was nothing about
Julia in it.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Such was the first issue, complete, of <em>The North End Daily
Oriole</em>. What had happened to the poem was due partly to Atwater
&amp; Rooter's natural lack of experience in a new and exacting
trade; partly to their enviable unconsciousness of any necessity
for proof-reading; and somewhat to their haste in getting through
the final and least interesting stage of their undertaking; for
of course so far as the printers were concerned, the poem was
mere hack work anti-climax.</p>

<p>And as they later declared, under fire, anybody that could make
out more than three words in five of Florence's ole handwriting
was welcome to do it. Besides, what did it matter if a little
bit was left out at the end of one or two of the lines? They couldn't
be expected to run the lines out over their margin, could they?
And they never knew anything crazier than makin' all this fuss,
because: Well, what if some of it wasn't printed just exactly
right, who in the world was goin' to notice it, and what was the
difference of just a few words different in that ole poem, anyhow?</p>

<p>For by the time these explanations (so to call them) took place,
Florence was indeed makin' a fuss. Her emotion, at first, had
been happily stimulated at sight of "BY Florence Atwater." A singular
tenderness had risen in her&mdash;a tremulous sense as of something
almost sacred coming at last into its own; and she hurried to
distribute, gratis, among relatives and friends, several copies
of the <em>Oriole</em>, paying for them, too (though not without
injurious argument), at the rate of two cents a copy. But upon
returning to her own home, she became calm enough (for a moment
or so) to look over the poem with attention to details. She returned
hastily to the Newspaper Building, but would have been wiser to
remain away, since all subscribers had received their copies by
the time she got there; and under the circumstances little reparation
was practicable.</p>

<p>She ended her oration&mdash;or professed to end it&mdash;by declaring that
she would never have another poem in their ole vile newspaper
as long as she lived.</p>

<p>"You're right about that!" Henry Rooter agreed heartily. "We
wouldn't <em>let</em> another one in it. Not for fifty dollars!
Just look at all the trouble we took, moiling and toiling, to
get your ole poem printed as nice as we could, so it wouldn't
ruin our newspaper, and then you come over here and go on like
this, and all this and that, why, I wouldn't go through it again
for a <em>hunderd</em> dollars! We're makin' good money anyhow,
with our newspaper, Florence Atwater. You needn't think we depend
on <em>you</em> for our living!"</p>

<p>"That's so," his partner declared. "We knew you wouldn't be satisfied,
anyway, Florence. Didn't we, Henry?"</p>

<p>"I should say we did!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" said Herbert. "Right when we were havin' the worst
time tryin' to print it and make out some o' the words, I said
right then we were just throwing away our time. I said, 'What's
the use? That ole girl's bound to raise Cain anyhow, so what's
the use wastin' a whole lot of our good time and brains like this,
just to suit <em>her</em>? Whatever we do, she's certain to come
over and insult us.' Isn't that what I said, Henry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is; and I said then you were right, and you <em>are</em>
right!"</p>

<p>"Cert'nly I am," said Herbert. "Didn't I tell you she'd be just
the way some the family say she is? A good many of 'em say she'd
find fault with the undertaker at her own funeral. That's just
exactly what I said!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you did?" Florence burlesqued a polite interest. "How _vir_ry
considerate of you! Then, perhaps you'll try to be a gentleman
enough for one simple moment to allow me to tell you my last remarks
on this subject. I've said enough&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>have</em> you?" Herbert interrupted with violent sarcasm.
"Oh, no! Say not so! Florence, say not so!"</p>

<p>At this, Henry Rooter loudly shouted with applausive hilarity;
whereupon Herbert, rather surprised at his own effectiveness,
naturally repeated his waggery.</p>

<p>"Say not so, Florence! Say not so! Say not so!"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you one thing!" his lady cousin cried, thoroughly
infuriated. "I wish to make just one last simple remark that I
would care to soil myself with in <em>your</em> respects, Mister
Herbert Illingsworth Atwater and Mister Henry Rooter!"</p>

<p>"Oh, say not so, Florence!" they both entreated. "Say not so!
Say not so!"</p>

<p>"I'll just simply state the simple truth," Florence announced.
"In the first place, you're goin' to live to see the day when
you'll come and beg me on your bented knees to have me put poems
or anything I want to in your ole newspaper, but I'll just <em>laugh</em>
at you! '<em>Indeed</em>?' I'll say! 'So you come beggin' around
<em>me</em>, do you? Ha, ha!' I'll say! 'I guess it's a little
too late for that! Why, I wouldn't&#11834;'"</p>

<p>"Oh, say not so, Florence! Say not so!"</p>

<p>"'<em>Me</em> to allow you to have one of my poems?' I'll say,
'Much less than <em>that</em>!' I'll say, 'because even if I was
wearing the oldest shoes I got in the world I wouldn't take the
trouble to&#11834;'"</p>

<p>Her conclusion was drowned out. "Oh, <em>Florence</em>, say not
so! Say not so, Florence! Say not so!"</p>
