<P>
FOR a moment Horace stood thunderstruck, looking in blank
astonishment at Lady Janet. His first words, as soon as he had
recovered himself, were addressed to Julian. "Is this a joke?" he
asked, sternly. "If it is, I for one don't see the humor of it."
<P>
Julian pointed to the closely written pages of the consul's
letter. "A man writes in earnest," he said, "when he writes at
such length as this. The woman seriously gave the name of Grace
Roseberry, and when she left Mannheim she traveled to England for
the express purpose of presenting herself to Lady Janet Roy." He
turned to his aunt. "You saw me start," he went on, "when you
first mentioned Miss Roseberry's name in my hearing. Now you know
why." He addressed himself once more to Horace. "You heard me say
that you, as Miss Roseberry's future husband, had an interest in
being present at my interview with Lady Janet. Now _you_ know
why."
<P>
"The woman is plainly mad," said Lady Janet. "But it is certainly
a startling form of madness when one first hears of it. Of course
we must keep the matter, for the present at least, a secret from
Grace."
<P>
"There can be no doubt," Horace agreed, "that Grace must be kept
in the dark, in her present state of health. The servants had
better be warned beforehand, in case of this adventuress or
madwoman, whichever she may be, attempting to make her way into
the house."
<P>
"It shall be done immediately," said Lady Janet. "What surprises
_me_ Julian (ring the bell, if you please), is that you should
describe yourself in your letter as feeling an interest in this
person."
<P>
Julian answered--without ringing the bell.
<P>
"I am more interested than ever," he said, "now I find that Miss
Roseberry herself is your guest at Mablethorpe House."
<P>
'You were always perverse, Julian, as a child, in your likings
and dislikings," Lady Janet rejoined. "Why don't you ring the
bell?"
<P>
"For one good reason, my dear aunt. I don't wish to hear you tell
your servants to close the door on this friendless creature."
<P>
Lady Janet cast a look at her nephew which plainly expressed that
she thought he had taken a liberty with her.
<P>
"You don't expect me to see the woman?" she asked, in a tone of
cold surprise.
<P>
"I hope you will not refuse to see her," Julian answered,
quietly. "I was out when she called. I must hear what she has to
say--and I should infinitely prefer hearing it in your presence.
When I got your reply to my letter, permitting me to present her
to you, I wrote to her immediately, appointing a meeting here."
<P>
Lady Janet lifted her bright black eyes in mute expostulation to
the carved Cupids and wreaths on the dining-room ceiling.
<P>
"When am I to have the honor of the lady's visit?" she inquired,
with ironical resignation.
<P>
"To-day," answered her nephew, with impenetrable patience.
<P>
"At what hour?"
<P>
Julian composedly consulted his watch. "She is ten minutes after
her time," he said, and put his watch back in his pocket again.
<P>
At the same moment the servant appeared, and advanced to Julian,
carrying a visiting card on his little silver tray.
<P>
"A lady to see you, sir."
<P>
Julian took the card, and, bowing, handed it to his aunt.
<P>
"Here she is, "he said, just as quietly as ever.
<P>
Lady Janet looked at the card, and tossed it indignantly back to
her nephew. "Miss Roseberry!" she exclaimed. "Printed--actually
printed on her card! Julian, even MY patience has its limits. I
refuse to see her!"
<P>
The servant was still waiting--not like a human being who took an
interest in the proceedings, but (as became a perfectly bred
footman) like an article of furniture artfully constructed to
come and go at the word of command. Julian gave the word of
command, addressing the admirably constructed automaton by the
name of "James."
<P>
"Where is the lady now?" he asked.
<P>
"In the breakfast-room, sir."
<P>
"Leave her there, if you please, and wait outside within hearing
of the bell."
<P>
The legs of the furniture-footman acted, and took him noiselessly
out of the room. Julian turned to his aunt.
<P>
"Forgive me," he said, "for venturing to give the man his orders
in your presence. I am very anxious that you should not decide
hastily. Surely we ought to hear what this lady has to say?"
<P>
Horace dissented widely from his friend's opinion. "It's an
insult to Grace," he broke out, warmly, "to hear what she has to
say!"
<P>
Lady Janet nodded her head in high approval. "I think so, too,"
said her ladyship, crossing her handsome old hands resolutely on
her lap.
<P>
Julian applied himself to answering Horace first.
<P>
"Pardon me," he said. "I have no intention of presuming to
reflect on Miss Roseberry, or of bringing her into the matter at
all.--The consul's letter," he went on, speaking to his aunt,
"mentions, if you remember, that the medical authorities of
Mannheim were divided in opinion on their patient's case. Some of
them--the physician-in-chief being among the number--believe that
the recovery of her mind has not accompanied the recovery of her
body."
<P>
"In other words," Lady Janet remarked, "a madwoman is in my
house, and I am expected to receive her!"
<P>
"Don't let us exaggerate," said Julian, gently. "It can serve no
good interest, in this serious matter, to exaggerate anything.
The consul assures us, on the authority of the doctor, that she
is perfectly gentle and harmless. If she is really the victim of
a mental delusion, the poor creature is surely an object of
compassion, and she ought to be placed under proper care. Ask
your own kind heart, my dear aunt, if it would not be downright
cruelty to turn this forlorn woman adrift in the world without
making some inquiry first."
<P>
Lady Janet's inbred sense of justice admitted not over
willingly--the reasonableness as well as the humanity of the view
expressed in those words. "There is some truth in that, Julian,"
she said, shifting her position uneasily in her chair, and
looking at Horace. "Don't you think so, too?" she added.
<P>
"I can't say I do," answered Horace, in the positive tone of a
man whose obstinacy is proof against every form of appeal that
can be addressed to him.
<P>
The patience of Julian was firm enough to be a match for the
obstinacy of Horace. "At any rate," he resumed, with undiminished
good temper," we are all three equally interested in setting this
matter at rest. I put it to you, Lady Janet, if we are not
favored, at this lucky moment, with the very opportunity that we
want? Miss Roseberry is not only out of the room, but out of the
house. If we let this chance slip, who can say what awkward
accident may not happen in the course of the next few days?"
<P>
"Let the woman come in," cried Lady Janet, deciding headlong,
with her customary impatience of all delay. "At once,
Julian--before Grace can come back. Will you ring the bell this
time?"
<P>
This time Julian rang it. "May I give the man his orders?" he
respectfully inquired of his aunt.
<P>
"Give him anything you like, and have done with it!" retorted the
irritable old lady, getting briskly on her feet, and taking a
turn in the room to compose herself.
<P>
The servant withdrew, with orders to show the visitor in.
<P>
Horace crossed the room at the same time--apparently with the
intention of leaving it by the door at the opposite end.
<P>
"You are not going away?" exclaimed Lady Janet.
<P>
"I see no use in my remaining here," replied Horace, not very
graciously.
<P>
"In that case," retorted Lady Janet, "remain here because I wish
it."
<P>
"Certainly--if you wish it. Only remember," he added, more
obstinately than ever," that I differ entirely from Julian's
view. In my opinion the woman has no claim on us."
<P>
A passing movement of irritation escaped Julian for the fir st
time. "Don't be hard, Horace," he said, sharply. "All women have
a claim on us."
<P>
They had unconsciously gathered together, in the heat of the
little debate, turning their backs on the library door. At the
last words of the reproof administered by Julian to Horace, their
attention was recalled to passing events by the slight noise
produced by the opening and closing of the door. With one accord
the three turned and looked in the direction from which the
sounds had come.
