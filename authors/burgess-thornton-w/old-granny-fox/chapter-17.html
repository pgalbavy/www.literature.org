To give her children what each needs<br/>
To get the most from life he can,<br/>
To work and play and live his best,<br/>
Is wise Old Mother Nature's plan.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Old Granny Fox.

<p>Old Granny Fox asked Reddy how he would like to eat a dinner
of Bowser the Hound's, Reddy looked at her sharply to see if she
were joking or really meant what she said. Granny looked so sober
and so much in earnest that Reddy decided she couldn't be joking,
even though it did sound that way.</p>

<p>"I certainly would like it, Granny. Yes, indeed, I certainly
would like it," said he. "You&mdash;you don't suppose he will give
us one, do you?"</p>

<p>Granny chuckled. "No, Reddy," said she. "Bowser isn't so generous
as all that, especially to Foxes. He isn't going to give us that
dinner; we are going to take it away from him. Yes, Sir, we just
naturally are going to take it away from, him."</p>

<p>Reddy didn't for the life of him see how it could be possible
to take a dinner away from Bowser the Hound. That seemed to him
almost as impossible as it was for him to climb or fly or dive.
But he had great faith in Granny's cleverness. He remembered how
she had so nearly caught Quacker the Duck. He knew that all the
time he had been away trying to find something for them to eat,
old Granny Fox had been doing more than just rest her tired old
bones. He knew that not for one single minute had her sharp wits
been idle. He knew that all that time she had been studying and
studying to find some way by which they could get something to
eat. So great was his faith in Granny just then that if she had
told him she would get him a slice of the moon he would have believed
her.</p>

<p>"If you say we can take a dinner away from Bowser the Hound,
I suppose we can," said Reddy, "though I don't see how. But if
we can, let's do it right away. I'm hungry enough to dare almost
anything for the sake of something to put in my stomach. It is
so empty that little bit of fish we divided is shaking around
as if it were lost. Gracious, I could eat a million fish the size
of that one! Have you thought of Fanner Brown's hens, Granny?"</p>

<p>"Of course, Reddy! Of course! What a silly question!" replied
Granny. "We may have to come to them yet."</p>

<p>"I wish I was at them right now," interrupted Reddy with a sigh.</p>

<p>"But you know what I have told you," went on Granny. "The surest
way of getting into trouble is to steal hens. I'm not feeling
quite up to being chased by Bowser the Hound just now, and if
we came right home we would give away the secret of where we live
and might be smoked out, and that would be the end of us. Besides,
those hens will be hard to get this weather, because they will
stay in their house, and there is no way for us to get in there
unless we walk right in, in broad daylight, and that would never
do. It will be a great deal better to take Bowser's dinner away
from him. In the first place, if we are careful, no one but Bowser
will know about it, and as long as he is chained up, we will have
nothing to worry about from him. Besides, we will enjoy getting
even with him for the times he has spoiled our chances of catching
a fat chicken and for the way he has hunted us. Most decidedly
it will be better and safer to try for Bowser's dinner than to
try for one of those hens."</p>

<p>"Just as you say, Granny; just as you say," returned Reddy. "You
know best. But how under the sun we can do it beats me."</p>

<p>"It is very simple," replied Granny, "very simple indeed. Most
things are simple enough when you find out how to do them. Neither
of us could do it alone, but together we can do it without the
least bit of risk. Listen."</p>

<p>Granny went close to Reddy and whispered to him, although there
wasn't a soul within hearing. A slow grin spread over Reddy's
face as he listened. When she had finished, he laughed right out.</p>

<p>"Granny, you are a wonder!" he exclaimed admiringly. "I never
should have thought of that. Of course we can do it. My, won't
Bowser be surprised! And how mad he'll be! Come on, let's be starting!"</p>

<p>"All right," said Granny, and the two started towards Farmer
Brown's.</p>
