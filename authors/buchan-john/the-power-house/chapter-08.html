<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I left Belgrave Square about a quarter to eight and retraced
my steps along the route which for me that afternoon had been
so full of tremors.  I was still being watched&mdash;a little observation
told me that&mdash;but I would not be interfered with, provided my
way lay in a certain direction.  So completely without nervousness
was I that at the top of Constitution Hill I struck into the Green
Park and kept to the grass till I emerged into Piccadilly, opposite
Devonshire House. A light wind had risen and the evening had grown
pleasantly cool.  I met several men I knew going out to dinner
on foot and stopped to exchange greetings.  From my clothes they
thought I had just returned from a day in the country.</p>

<p>I reached the Albany as the clock was striking eight.  Lumley's
rooms were on the first floor, and I was evidently expected, for
the porter himself conducted me to them and waited by me till
the door was opened by a man-servant.</p>

<p>You know those rococo, late Georgian Albany rooms, large, square,
clumsily corniced.  Lumley's was lined with books, which I saw
at a glance were of a different type from those in his working
library at his country house.  This was the collection of a bibliophile,
and in the light of the summer evening the rows of tall volumes
in vellum and morocco lined the walls like some rich tapestry.</p>

<p>The valet retired and shut the door, and presently from a little
inner chamber came his master.  He was dressed for dinner and
wore more than ever the air of the eminent diplomat.  Again I
had the old feeling of incredulity.  It was the Lumley I had met
two nights before at dinner, the friend of Viceroys and Cabinet
Ministers.  It was hard to connect him with Antioch Street or
the red-haired footman with a pistol.  Or with Tuke?  Yes, I decided,
Tuke fitted into the frame.  Both were brains cut loose from the
decencies that make life possible.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Leithen," he said pleasantly.  "As you have
fixed the hour of eight, may I offer you dinner?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," I replied, "but I have already dined.  I have chosen
an awkward time, but my business need not take long."</p>

<p>"So," he said.  "I am always glad to see you at any hour."</p>

<p>"And I prefer to see the master rather than the subordinates
who have been infesting my life during the past week."</p>

<p>We both laughed.  "I am afraid you have had some annoyance, Mr.
Leithen," he said.  "But remember, I gave you fair warning."</p>

<p>"True.  And I have come to do the same kindness to you.  That
part of the game, at any rate, is over."</p>

<p>"Over?" he queried, raising his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Yes, over," I said, and took out my watch.  "Let us be quite
frank with each other, Mr. Lumley.  There is really very little
time to waste.  As you have doubtless read the paper which you
stole from my friend this morning you know more or less the extent
of my information."</p>

<p>"Let us have frankness by all means.  Yes, I have read your paper. 
A very creditable piece of work, if I may say so.  You will rise
in your profession, Mr. Leithen.  But surely you must realise
that it carries you a very little way."</p>

<p>"In a sense you are right.  I am not in a position to reveal
the full extent of your misdeeds.  Of the Power-House and its
doings I can only guess.  But Pitt-Heron is on his way home, and
he will be carefully safeguarded on that journey.  Your creature,
Saronov, has confessed.  We shall know more very soon, and meantime
I have clear evidence which implicates you in a conspiracy to
murder."</p>

<p>He did not answer, but I wished I could see behind his tinted
spectacles to the look in his eyes.  I think he had not been quite
prepared for the line I took.</p>

<p>"I need not tell you as a lawyer, Mr. Leithen," he said at last,
"that what seems good evidence on paper is often feeble enough
in Court.  You cannot suppose that I will tamely plead guilty
to your charges.  On the contrary, I will fight them with all
the force that brains and money can give.  You are an ingenious
young man, but you are not the brightest jewel of the English
Bar."</p>

<p>"That also is true.  I do not deny that some of my evidence may
be weakened at the trial.  It is even conceivable that you may
be acquitted on some technical doubt.  But you have forgotten
one thing. From the day you leave the Court you will be a suspected
man.  The police of all Europe will be on your trail.  You have
been highly successful in the past, and why?  Because you have
been above suspicion, an honourable and distinguished gentleman,
belonging to the best clubs, counting as your acquaintances the
flower of our society.  Now you will be a suspect, a man with
a past, a centre of strange stories.  I put it to you&mdash;how far
are you likely to succeed under these conditions?"</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"You have a talent for character drawing, my friend.  What makes
you think that I can work only if I live in the limelight of popularity?"</p>

<p>"The talent you mentioned," I said.  "As I read your character&mdash;and
I think I am right&mdash;you are an artist in crime.  You are not the
common cut-throat who acts out of passion or greed.  No, I think
you are something subtler than that.  You love power, hidden power. 
You flatter your vanity by despising mankind and making them your
tools. You scorn the smattering of inaccuracies which passes for
human knowledge, and I will not venture to say you are wrong. 
Therefore you use your brains to frustrate it.  Unhappily the
life of millions is built on that smattering, so you are a foe
to society.  But there would be no flavour in controlling subterranean
things if you were yourself a mole working in the dark.  To get
the full flavour, the irony of it all, you must live in the light. 
I can imagine you laughing in your soul as you move about our
world, praising it with your lips, patting it with your hands,
and kicking its props away with your feet.  I can see the charm
of it.  But it is over now."</p>

<p>"Over?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Over," I repeated.  "The end has come&mdash;the utter, final and
absolute end."</p>

<p>He made a sudden, odd, nervous movement, pushing his glasses
close back upon his eyes.</p>

<p>"What about yourself?" he said hoarsely.  "Do you think you can
play against me without suffering desperate penalties?"</p>

<p>He was holding a cord in his hand with a knob on the end of it. 
He now touched a button in the knob and there came the faint sound
of a bell.</p>

<p>The door was behind me and he was looking beyond me towards it. 
I was entirely at his mercy, but I never budged an inch.  I do
not know how I managed to keep calm, but I did it, and without
much effort.  I went on speaking, conscious that the door had
opened and that someone was at my back.</p>

<p>"It is really quite useless trying to frighten me.  I am safe,
because I am dealing with an intelligent man and not with the
ordinary half-witted criminal.  You do not want my life in silly
revenge.  If you call in your men and strangle me between you
what earthly good would it do you?"</p>

<p>He was looking beyond me and the passion&mdash;a sudden white-hot
passion like an epilepsy&mdash;was dying out of his face.</p>

<p>"A mistake, James," he said.  "You can go."</p>

<p>The door closed softly at my back.</p>

<p>"Yes.  A mistake.  I have a considerable admiration for you,
Mr. Lumley, and should be sorry to be disappointed."</p>

<p>He laughed quite like an ordinary mortal.  "I am glad this affair
is to be conducted on a basis of mutual respect.  Now that the
melodramatic overture is finished, let us get to the business."</p>

<p>"By all means," I said.  "I promised to deal with you frankly. 
Well, let me put my last cards on the table.  At half-past nine
precisely the duplicate of that statement of mine which you annexed
this morning will be handed to Scotland Yard.  I may add that
the authorities there know me, and are proceeding under my advice. 
When they read that statement they will act on it.  You have therefore
about one and a half, or say one and three-quarter hours to make
up your mind.  You can still secure your freedom, but it must
be elsewhere than in England."</p>

<p>He had risen to his feet, and was pacing up and down the room.</p>

<p>"Will you oblige me by telling me one thing," he said.  "If you
believe me to be, as you say, a dangerous criminal, how do you
reconcile it with your conscience to give me a chance of escape? 
It is your duty to bring me to justice."</p>

<p>"I will tell you why," I said.  "I, too, have a weak joint in
my armour.  Yours is that you only succeed under the disguise
of high respectability.  That disguise, in any case, will be stripped
from you.  Mine is Pitt-Heron.  I do not know how far he has entangled
himself with you, but I know something of his weakness, and I
don't want his career ruined and his wife's heart broken.  He
has learned his lesson, and will never mention you and your schemes
to a mortal soul.  Indeed, if I can help it, he will never know
that anyone shares his secret.  The price of the chance of escape
I offer you is that Pitt-Heron's past be buried for ever."</p>

<p>He did not answer.  He had his arms folded, walking up and down
the room, and suddenly seemed to have aged enormously.  I had
the impression that I was dealing with a very old man.</p>

<p>"Mr. Leithen," he said at last, "you are bold.  You have a frankness
which almost amounts to genius.  You are wasted in your stupid
profession, but your speculative powers are not equal to your
other endowments, so you will probably remain in it, deterred
by an illogical scruple from following your true bent.  Your true
<em>métier</em>, believe me, is what shallow people call crime. 
Speaking 'without prejudice,' as the idiot solicitors say, it
would appear that we have both weak spots in our cases.  Mine,
you say, is that I can only work by using the conventions of what
we agreed to call the Machine. There may be truth in that.  Yours
is that you have a friend who lacks your iron-clad discretion. 
You offer a plan which saves both our weaknesses.  By the way,
what is it?"</p>

<p>I looked at my watch again.  "You have ample time to catch the
night express to Paris."</p>

<p>"And if not?"</p>

<p>"Then I am afraid there may be trouble with the police between
ten and eleven o'clock."</p>

<p>"Which for all our sakes would be a pity.  Do you know you interest
me uncommonly, for you confirm the accuracy of my judgment.  I
have always had a notion that some day I should run across to
my sorrow just such a man as you.  A man of very great intellectual
power I can deal with, for that kind of brain is usually combined
with the sort of high-strung imagination on which I can work. 
The same with your over-imaginative man.  Yes Pitt-Heron was of
that type.  Ordinary brains do not trouble me, for I puzzle them. 
Now you are a man of good average intelligence.  Pray forgive
the lukewarmness of the phrase; it is really a high compliment,
for I am an austere critic. If you were that and no more you would
not have succeeded.  But you possess also a quite irrelevant gift
of imagination.  Not enough to upset your balance, but enough
to do what your mere lawyer's talent could never have done.  You
have achieved a feat which is given to few&mdash;you have partially
understood me.  Believe me, I rate you high. You are the kind
of four-square being bedded in the concrete of our civilisation,
on whom I have always felt I might some day come to grief.... 
No, no, I am not trying to wheedle you.  If I thought I could
do that I should be sorry, for my discernment would have been
at fault."</p>

<p>"I warn you," I said, "that you are wasting precious time."</p>

<p>He laughed quite cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I believe you are really anxious about my interests," he said.
"That is a triumph indeed.  Do you know, Mr. Leithen, it is a
mere whimsy of fate that you are not my disciple.  If we had met
earlier and under other circumstances I should have captured you. 
It is because you have in you a capacity for discipleship that
you have succeeded in your opposition."</p>

<p>"I abominate you and all your works," I said, "but I admire your
courage."</p>

<p>He shook his head gently.</p>

<p>"It is the wrong word.  I am not courageous.  To be brave means
that you have conquered fear, but I have never had any fear to
conquer. Believe me, Mr. Leithen, I am quite impervious to threats. 
You come to me to-night and hold a pistol to my head.  You offer
me two alternatives, both of which mean failure.  But how do you
know that I regard them as failure?  I have had what they call
a good run for my money.  No man since Napoleon has tasted such
power.  I may be willing to end it.  Age creeps on and power may
grow burdensome.  I have always sat loose from common ambitions
and common affections. For all you know I may regard you as a
benefactor."</p>

<p>All this talk looks futile when it is written down, but it was
skilful enough, for it was taking every atom of exhilaration out
of my victory.  It was not idle brag.  Every syllable rang true,
as I knew in my bones.  I felt myself in the presence of something
enormously big, as if a small barbarian was desecrating the colossal
Zeus of Pheidias with a coal hammer.  But I also felt it inhuman,
and I hated it and I clung to that hatred.</p>

<p>"You fear nothing and you believe nothing," I said.  "Man, you
should never have been allowed to live."</p>

<p>He raised a deprecating hand.  "I am a sceptic about most things,"
he said, "but, believe me, I have my own worship.  I venerate
the intellect of man.  I believe in its undreamed-of possibilities,
when it grows free like an oak in the forest and is not dwarfed
in a flower-pot.  From that allegiance I have never wavered. 
That is the God I have never forsworn."</p>

<p>I took out my watch.</p>

<p>"Permit me again to remind you that time presses."</p>

<p>"True," he said smiling, "the continental express will not wait
upon my confession.  Your plan is certainly conceivable.  There
may be other and easier ways.  I am not certain.  I must think.... 
Perhaps it would be wiser if you left me now, Mr. Leithen.  If
I take your advice there will be various things to do....  In
any case there will be much to do...."</p>

<p>He led me to the door as if he were an ordinary host speeding
an ordinary guest.  I remember that on my way he pointed out a
set of Aldines and called my attention to their beauty.  He shook
hands quite cordially and remarked on the fineness of the weather. 
That was the last I saw of this amazing man.</p>

<p>It was with profound relief that I found myself in Piccadilly
in the wholesome company of my kind.  I had carried myself boldly
enough in the last hour, but I would not have gone through it
again for a king's ransom.  Do you know what it is to deal with
a pure intelligence, a brain stripped of every shred of humanity? 
It is like being in the company of a snake.</p>

<p>I drove to the club and telephoned to Macgillivray, asking him
to take no notice of my statement till he heard from me in the
morning. Then I went to the hospital to see Chapman.</p>

<p>That leader of the people was in a furious temper and he was
scarcely to be appeased by my narrative of the day's doings. 
Your Labour Member is the greatest of all sticklers for legality,
and the outrage he had suffered that morning had grievously weakened
his trust in public security.  The Antioch Street business had
seemed to him eminently right; if you once got mixed up in melodrama
you had to expect such things.  But for a Member of Parliament
to be robbed in broad daylight next door to the House of Commons
upset the foundations of his faith.  There was little the matter
with his body and the doctor promised that he would be allowed
up next day, but his soul was a mass of bruises.</p>

<p>It took me a lot of persuasion to get him to keep quiet.  He
wanted a public exposure of Lumley, a big trial, a general ferreting
out of secret agents, the whole winding up with a speech in Parliament
by himself on this last outrage of Capitalism.  Gloomily he listened
to my injunctions to silence.  But he saw the reason of it and
promised to hold his tongue out of loyalty to Tommy.  I knew that
Pitt-Heron's secret was safe with him.</p>

<p>As I crossed Westminster Bridge on my way home the night express
to the Continent rumbled over the river.  I wondered if Lumley
was on board or if he had taken one of the other ways of which
he had spoken.</p>
