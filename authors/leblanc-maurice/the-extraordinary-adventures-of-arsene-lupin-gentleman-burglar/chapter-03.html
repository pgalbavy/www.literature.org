<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Arsène Lupin had just finished his repast and taken from his
pocket an excellent cigar, with a gold band, which he was examining
with unusual care, when the door of his cell was opened. He had
barely time to throw the cigar into the drawer and move away from
the table. The guard entered. It was the hour for exercise.</p>

<p>"I was waiting for you, my dear boy," exclaimed Lupin, in his
accustomed good humor.</p>

<p>They went out together. As soon as they had disappeared at a
turn in the corridor, two men entered the cell and commenced a
minute examination of it. One was Inspector Dieuzy; the other
was Inspector Folenfant. They wished to verify their suspicion
that Arsène Lupin was in communication with his accomplices outside
of the prison. On the preceding evening, the ‘Grand Journal’ had
published these lines addressed to its court reporter:</p>

<p>"Monsieur:</p>

<p>"In a recent article you referred to me in most unjustifiable
terms. Some days before the opening of my trial I will call you
to account. Arsène Lupin."</p>

<p>The handwriting was certainly that of Arsène Lupin. Consequently,
he sent letters; and, no doubt, received letters. It was certain
that he was preparing for that escape thus arrogantly announced
by him.</p>

<p>The situation had become intolerable. Acting in conjunction with
the examining judge, the chief of the Sûreté, Mon. Dudouis, had
visited the prison and instructed the gaoler in regard to the
precautions necessary to insure Lupin’s safety. At the same time,
he sent the two men to examine the prisoner’s cell. They raised
every stone, ransacked the bed, did everything customary in such
a case, but they discovered nothing, and were about to abandon
their investigation when the guard entered hastily and said:</p>

<p>"The drawer.... look in the table-drawer. When I entered just
now he was closing it."</p>

<p>They opened the drawer, and Dieuzy exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Ah! we have him this time."</p>

<p>Folenfant stopped him.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment. The chief will want to make an inventory."</p>

<p>"This is a very choice cigar."</p>

<p>"Leave it there, and notify the chief."</p>

<p>Two minutes later Mon. Dudouis examined the contents of the drawer.
First he discovered a bundle of newspaper clippings relating to
Arsène Lupin taken from the ‘Argus de la Presse,’ then a tobacco-box,
a pipe, some paper called "onion-peel," and two books. He read
the titles of the books. One was an English edition of Carlyle’s
"Hero-worship"; the other was a charming elzevir, in modern binding,
the "Manual of Epictetus," a German translation published at Leyden
in 1634. On examining the books, he found that all the pages were
underlined and annotated. Were they prepared as a code for correspondence,
or did they simply express the studious character of the reader?
Then he examined the tobacco-box and the pipe. Finally, he took
up the famous cigar with its gold band.</p>

<p>"Fichtre!" he exclaimed. "Our friend smokes a good cigar. It’s
a Henry Clay."</p>

<p>With the mechanical action of an habitual smoker, he placed the
cigar close to his ear and squeezed it to make it crack. Immediately
he uttered a cry of surprise. The cigar had yielded under the
pressure of his fingers. He examined it more closely, and quickly
discovered something white between the leaves of tobacco. Delicately,
with the aid of a pin, he withdrew a roll of very thin paper,
scarcely larger than a toothpick. It was a letter. He unrolled
it, and found these words, written in a feminine handwriting:</p>

<p>"The basket has taken the place of the others. Eight out of ten
are ready. On pressing the outer foot the plate goes downward.
From twelve to sixteen every day, <em>H-P </em>will wait. But
where? Reply at once. Rest easy; your friend is watching over
you."</p>

<p>Mon. Dudouis reflected a moment, then said:</p>

<p>"It is quite clear.... the basket.... the eight compartments....
From twelve to sixteen means from twelve to four o’clock."</p>

<p>"But this <em>H-P, </em>that will wait?"</p>

<p>"<em>H-P </em>must mean automobile. <em>H-P, </em>horsepower,
is the way they indicate strength of the motor. A twenty-four
<em>H-P </em>is an automobile of twenty-four horsepower."</p>

<p>Then he rose, and asked:</p>

<p>"Had the prisoner finished his breakfast?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And as he has not yet read the message, which is proved by the
condition of the cigar, it is probable that he had just received
it."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"In his food. Concealed in his bread or in a potato, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Impossible. His food was allowed to be brought in simply to
trap him, but we have never found anything in it."</p>

<p>"We will look for Lupin’s reply this evening. Detain him outside
for a few minutes. I shall take this to the examining judge, and,
if he agrees with me, we will have the letter photographed at
once, and in an hour you can replace the letter in the drawer
in a cigar similar to this. The prisoner must have no cause for
suspicion."</p>

<p>It was not without a certain curiosity that Mon. Dudouis returned
to the prison in the evening, accompanied by Inspector Dieuzy.
Three empty plates were sitting on the stove in the corner.</p>

<p>"He has eaten?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the guard.</p>

<p>"Dieuzy, please cut that macaroni into very small pieces, and
open that bread-roll....Nothing?"</p>

<p>"No, chief."</p>

<p>Mon. Dudouis examined the plates, the fork, the spoon, and the
knife&mdash;an ordinary knife with a rounded blade. He turned the handle
to the left; then to the right. It yielded and unscrewed. The
knife was hollow, and served as a hiding-place for a sheet of
paper.</p>

<p>"Peuh!" he said, "that is not very clever for a man like Arsène.
But we mustn’t lose any time. You, Dieuzy, go and search the restaurant."</p>

<p>Then he read the note:</p>

<p>"I trust to you, <em>H-P </em>will follow at a distance every
day. I will go ahead. Au revoir, dear friend."</p>

<p>"At last," cried Mon. Dudouis, rubbing his hands gleefully, "I
think we have the affair in our own hands. A little strategy on
our part, and the escape will be a success in so far as the arrest
of his confederates are concerned."</p>

<p>"But if Arsène Lupin slips through your fingers?" suggested the
guard.</p>

<p>"We will have a sufficient number of men to prevent that. If,
however, he displays too much cleverness, ma foi, so much the
worse for him! As to his band of robbers, since the chief refuses
to speak, the others must."</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>And, as a matter of fact, Arsène Lupin had very little to say.
For several months, Mon. Jules Bouvier, the examining judge, had
exerted himself in vain. The investigation had been reduced to
a few uninteresting arguments between the judge and the advocate,
Maître Danval, one of the leaders of the bar. From time to time,
through courtesy, Arsène Lupin would speak. One day he said:</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur, le judge, I quite agree with you: the robbery
of the Crédit Lyonnais, the theft in the rue de Babylone, the
issue of the counterfeit bank-notes, the burglaries at the various
châteaux, Armesnil, Gouret, Imblevain, Groseillers, Malaquis,
all my work, monsieur, I did it all."</p>

<p>"Then will you explain to me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It is useless. I confess everything in a lump, everything and
even ten times more than you know nothing about."</p>

<p>Wearied by his fruitless task, the judge had suspended his examinations,
but he resumed them after the two intercepted messages were brought
to his attention; and regularly, at mid-day, Arsène Lupin was
taken from the prison to the Dépôt in the prison-van with a certain
number of other prisoners. They returned about three or four o’clock.</p>

<p>Now, one afternoon, this return trip was made under unusual conditions.
The other prisoners not having been examined, it was decided to
take back Arsène Lupin first, thus he found himself alone in the
vehicle.</p>

<p>These prison-vans, vulgarly called "panniers à salade"&mdash;or salad-baskets&mdash;are
divided lengthwise by a central corridor from which open ten compartments,
five on either side. Each compartment is so arranged that the
occupant must assume and retain a sitting posture, and, consequently,
the five prisoners are seated one upon the other, and yet separated
one from the other by partitions. A municipal guard, standing
at one end, watches over the corridor.</p>

<p>Arsène was placed in the third cell on the right, and the heavy
vehicle started. He carefully calculated when they left the quai
de l’Horloge, and when they passed the Palais de Justice. Then,
about the centre of the bridge Saint Michel, with his outer foot,
that is to say, his right foot, he pressed upon the metal plate
that closed his cell. Immediately something clicked, and the metal
plate moved. He was able to ascertain that he was located between
the two wheels.</p>

<p>He waited, keeping a sharp look-out. The vehicle was proceeding
slowly along the boulevard Saint Michel. At the corner of Saint
Germain it stopped. A truck horse had fallen. The traffic having
been interrupted, a vast throng of fiacres and omnibuses had gathered
there. Arsène Lupin looked out. Another prison-van had stopped
close to the one he occupied. He moved the plate still farther,
put his foot on one of the spokes of the wheel and leaped to the
ground. A coachman saw him, roared with laughter, then tried to
raise an outcry, but his voice was lost in the noise of the traffic
that had commenced to move again. Moreover, Arsène Lupin was already
far away.</p>

<p>He had run for a few steps; but, once upon the sidewalk, he turned
and looked around; he seemed to scent the wind like a person who
is uncertain which direction to take. Then, having decided, he
put his hands in his pockets, and, with the careless air of an
idle stroller, he proceeded up the boulevard. It was a warm, bright
autumn day, and the cafés were full. He took a seat on the terrace
of one of them. He ordered a bock and a package of cigarettes.
He emptied his glass slowly, smoked one cigarette and lighted
a second. Then he asked the waiter to send the proprietor to him.
When the proprietor came, Arsène spoke to him in a voice loud
enough to be heard by everyone:</p>

<p>"I regret to say, monsieur, I have forgotten my pocketbook. Perhaps,
on the strength of my name, you will be pleased to give me credit
for a few days. I am Arsène Lupin."</p>

<p>The proprietor looked at him, thinking he was joking. But Arsène
repeated:</p>

<p>"Lupin, prisoner at the Santé, but now a fugitive. I venture
to assume that the name inspires you with perfect confidence in
me."</p>

<p>And he walked away, amidst shouts of laughter, whilst the proprietor
stood amazed.</p>

<p>Lupin strolled along the rue Soufflot, and turned into the rue
Saint Jacques. He pursued his way slowly, smoking his cigarettes
and looking into the shop-windows. At the Boulevard de Port Royal
he took his bearings, discovered where he was, and then walked
in the direction of the rue de la Santé. The high forbidding walls
of the prison were now before him. He pulled his hat forward to
shade his face; then, approaching the sentinel, he asked:</p>

<p>"Is this the prison de la Santé?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I wish to regain my cell. The van left me on the way, and I
would not abuse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, young man, move along&mdash;quick!" growled the sentinel.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, but I must pass through that gate. And if you prevent
Arsène Lupin from entering the prison it will cost you dear, my
friend."</p>

<p>"Arsène Lupin! What are you talking about!"</p>

<p>"I am sorry I haven’t a card with me," said Arsène, fumbling
in his pockets.</p>

<p>The sentinel eyed him from head to foot, in astonishment. Then,
without a word, he rang a bell. The iron gate was partly opened,
and Arsène stepped inside. Almost immediately he encountered the
keeper of the prison, gesticulating and feigning a violent anger.
Arsène smiled and said:</p>

<p>"Come, monsieur, don’t play that game with me. What! they take
the precaution to carry me alone in the van, prepare a nice little
obstruction, and imagine I am going to take to my heels and rejoin
my friends. Well, and what about the twenty agents of the Sûreté
who accompanied us on foot, in fiacres and on bicycles? No, the
arrangement did not please me. I should not have got away alive.
Tell me, monsieur, did they count on that?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and added:</p>

<p>"I beg of you, monsieur, not to worry about me. When I wish to
escape I shall not require any assistance."</p>

<p>On the second day thereafter, the ‘Echo de France,’ which had
apparently become the official reporter of the exploits of Arsène
Lupin,&mdash;it was said that he was one of its principal shareholders&mdash;published
a most complete account of this attempted escape. The exact wording
of the messages exchanged between the prisoner and his mysterious
friend, the means by which correspondence was constructed, the
complicity of the police, the promenade on the Boulevard Saint
Michel, the incident at the café Soufflot, everything was disclosed.
It was known that the search of the restaurant and its waiters
by Inspector Dieuzy had been fruitless. And the public also learned
an extraordinary thing which demonstrated the infinite variety
of resources that Lupin possessed: the prison-van, in which he
was being carried, was prepared for the occasion and substituted
by his accomplices for one of the six vans which did service at
the prison.</p>

<p>The next escape of Arsène Lupin was not doubted by anyone. He
announced it himself, in categorical terms, in a reply to Mon.
Bouvier on the day following his attempted escape. The judge having
made a jest about the affair, Arsène was annoyed, and, firmly
eyeing the judge, he said, emphatically:</p>

<p>"Listen to me, monsieur! I give you my word of honor that this
attempted flight was simply preliminary to my general plan of
escape."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," said the judge.</p>

<p>"It is not necessary that you should understand."</p>

<p>And when the judge, in the course of that examination which was
reported at length in the columns of the ‘Echo de France,’ when
the judge sought to resume his investigation, Arsène Lupin exclaimed,
with an assumed air of lassitude:</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu, Mon Dieu, what’s the use! All these questions are
of no importance!"</p>

<p>"What! No importance?" cried the judge.</p>

<p>"No; because I shall not be present at the trial."</p>

<p>"You will not be present?"</p>

<p>"No; I have fully decided on that, and nothing will change my
mind."</p>

<p>Such assurance combined with the inexplicable indiscretions that
Arsène committed every day served to annoy and mystify the officers
of the law. There were secrets known only to Arsène Lupin; secrets
that he alone could divulge. But for what purpose did he reveal
them? And how?</p>

<p>Arsène Lupin was changed to another cell. The judge closed his
preliminary investigation. No further proceedings were taken in
his case for a period of two months, during which time Arsène
was seen almost constantly lying on his bed with his face turned
toward the wall. The changing of his cell seemed to discourage
him. He refused to see his advocate. He exchanged only a few necessary
words with his keepers.</p>

<p>During the fortnight preceding his trial, he resumed his vigorous
life. He complained of want of air. Consequently, early every
morning he was allowed to exercise in the courtyard, guarded by
two men.</p>

<p>Public curiosity had not died out; every day it expected to be
regaled with news of his escape; and, it is true, he had gained
a considerable amount of public sympathy by reason of his verve,
his gayety, his diversity, his inventive genius and the mystery
of his life. Arsène Lupin must escape. It was his inevitable fate.
The public expected it, and was surprised that the event had been
delayed so long. Every morning the Préfect of Police asked his
secretary:</p>

<p>"Well, has he escaped yet?"</p>

<p>"No, Monsieur le Préfect."</p>

<p>"To-morrow, probably."</p>

<p>And, on the day before the trial, a gentleman called at the office
of the ‘Grand Journal,’ asked to see the court reporter, threw
his card in the reporter’s face, and walked rapidly away. These
words were written on the card: "Arsène Lupin always keeps his
promises."</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>It was under these conditions that the trial commenced. An enormous
crowd gathered at the court. Everybody wished to see the famous
Arsène Lupin. They had a gleeful anticipation that the prisoner
would play some audacious pranks upon the judge. Advocates and
magistrates, reporters and men of the world, actresses and society
women were crowded together on the benches provided for the public.</p>

<p>It was a dark, sombre day, with a steady downpour of rain. Only
a dim light pervaded the courtroom, and the spectators caught
a very indistinct view of the prisoner when the guards brought
him in. But his heavy, shambling walk, the manner in which he
dropped into his seat, and his passive, stupid appearance were
not at all prepossessing. Several times his advocate&mdash;one of Mon.
Danval’s assistants&mdash;spoke to him, but he simply shook his head
and said nothing.</p>

<p>The clerk read the indictment, then the judge spoke:</p>

<p>"Prisoner at the bar, stand up. Your name, age, and occupation?"</p>

<p>Not receiving any reply, the judge repeated:</p>

<p>"Your name? I ask you your name?"</p>

<p>A thick, slow voice muttered:</p>

<p>"Baudru, Désiré."</p>

<p>A murmur of surprise pervaded the courtroom. But the judge proceeded:</p>

<p>"Baudru, Désiré? Ah! a new alias! Well, as you have already assumed
a dozen different names and this one is, no doubt, as imaginary
as the others, we will adhere to the name of Arsène Lupin, by
which you are more generally known."</p>

<p>The judge referred to his notes, and continued:</p>

<p>"For, despite the most diligent search, your past history remains
unknown. Your case is unique in the annals of crime. We know not
whom you are, whence you came, your birth and breeding&mdash;all is
a mystery to us. Three years ago you appeared in our midst as
Arsène Lupin, presenting to us a strange combination of intelligence
and perversion, immorality and generosity. Our knowledge of your
life prior to that date is vague and problematical. It may be
that the man called Rostat who, eight years ago, worked with Dickson,
the prestidigitator, was none other than Arsène Lupin. It is probable
that the Russian student who, six years ago, attended the laboratory
of Doctor Altier at the Saint Louis Hospital, and who often astonished
the doctor by the ingenuity of his hypotheses on subjects of bacteriology
and the boldness of his experiments in diseases of the skin, was
none other than Arsène Lupin. It is probable, also, that Arsène
Lupin was the professor who introduced the Japanese art of jiu-jitsu
to the Parisian public. We have some reason to believe that Arsène
Lupin was the bicyclist who won the Grand Prix de l’Exposition,
received his ten thousand francs, and was never heard of again.
Arsène Lupin may have been, also, the person who saved so many
lives through the little dormer-window at the Charity Bazaar;
and, at the same time, picked their pockets."</p>

<p>The judge paused for a moment, then continued:</p>

<p>"Such is that epoch which seems to have been utilized by you
in a thorough preparation for the warfare you have since waged
against society; a methodical apprenticeship in which you developed
your strength, energy and skill to the highest point possible.
Do you acknowledge the accuracy of these facts?"</p>

<p>During this discourse the prisoner had stood balancing himself,
first on one foot, then on the other, with shoulders stooped and
arms inert. Under the strongest light one could observe his extreme
thinness, his hollow cheeks, his projecting cheek-bones, his earthen-colored
face dotted with small red spots and framed in a rough, straggling
beard. Prison life had caused him to age and wither. He had lost
the youthful face and elegant figure we had seen portrayed so
often in the newspapers.</p>

<p>It appeared as if he had not heard the question propounded by
the judge. Twice it was repeated to him. Then he raised his eyes,
seemed to reflect, then, making a desperate effort, he murmured:</p>

<p>"Baudru, Désiré."</p>

<p>The judge smiled, as he said:</p>

<p>"I do not understand the theory of your defense, Arsène Lupin.
If you are seeking to avoid responsibility for your crimes on
the ground of imbecility, such a line of defense is open to you.
But I shall proceed with the trial and pay no heed to your vagaries."</p>

<p>He then narrated at length the various thefts, swindles and forgeries
charged against Lupin. Sometimes he questioned the prisoner, but
the latter simply grunted or remained silent. The examination
of witnesses commenced. Some of the evidence given was immaterial;
other portions of it seemed more important, but through all of
it there ran a vein of contradictions and inconsistencies. A wearisome
obscurity enveloped the proceedings, until Detective Ganimard
was called as a witness; then interest was revived.</p>

<p>From the beginning the actions of the veteran detective appeared
strange and unaccountable. He was nervous and ill at ease. Several
times he looked at the prisoner, with obvious doubt and anxiety.
Then, with his hands resting on the rail in front of him, he recounted
the events in which he had participated, including his pursuit
of the prisoner across Europe and his arrival in America. He was
listened to with great avidity, as his capture of Arsène Lupin
was well known to everyone through the medium of the press. Toward
the close of his testimony, after referring to his conversations
with Arsène Lupin, he stopped, twice, embarrassed and undecided.
It was apparent that he was possessed of some thought which he
feared to utter. The judge said to him, sympathetically:</p>

<p>"If you are ill, you may retire for the present."</p>

<p>"No, no, but&#11834;"</p>

<p>He stopped, looked sharply at the prisoner, and said:</p>

<p>"I ask permission to scrutinize the prisoner at closer range.
There is some mystery about him that I must solve."</p>

<p>He approached the accused man, examined him attentively for several
minutes, then returned to the witness-stand, and, in an almost
solemn voice, he said:</p>

<p>"I declare, on oath, that the prisoner now before me is not Arsène
Lupin."</p>

<p>A profound silence followed the statement. The judge, nonplused
for a moment, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Ah! What do you mean? That is absurd!"</p>

<p>The detective continued:</p>

<p>"At first sight there is a certain resemblance, but if you carefully
consider the nose, the mouth, the hair, the color of skin, you
will see that it is not Arsène Lupin. And the eyes! Did he ever
have those alcoholic eyes!"</p>

<p>"Come, come, witness! What do you mean? Do you pretend to say
that we are trying the wrong man?"</p>

<p>"In my opinion, yes. Arsène Lupin has, in some manner, contrived
to put this poor devil in his place, unless this man is a willing
accomplice."</p>

<p>This dramatic dénouement caused much laughter and excitement
amongst the spectators. The judge adjourned the trial, and sent
for Mon. Bouvier, the gaoler, and guards employed in the prison.</p>

<p>When the trial was resumed, Mon. Bouvier and the gaoler examined
the accused and declared that there was only a very slight resemblance
between the prisoner and Arsène Lupin.</p>

<p>"Well, then!" exclaimed the judge, "who is this man? Where does
he come from? What is he in prison for?"</p>

<p>Two of the prison-guards were called and both of them declared
that the prisoner was Arsène Lupin. The judged breathed once more.</p>

<p>But one of the guards then said:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I think it is he."</p>

<p>"What!" cried the judge, impatiently, "you *think* it is he!
What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"Well, I saw very little of the prisoner. He was placed in my
charge in the evening and, for two months, he seldom stirred,
but laid on his bed with his face to the wall."</p>

<p>"What about the time prior to those two months?"</p>

<p>"Before that he occupied a cell in another part of the prison.
He was not in cell 24."</p>

<p>Here the head gaoler interrupted, and said:</p>

<p>"We changed him to another cell after his attempted escape."</p>

<p>"But you, monsieur, you have seen him during those two months?"</p>

<p>"I had no occasion to see him. He was always quiet and orderly."</p>

<p>"And this prisoner is not Arsène Lupin?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then who is he?" demanded the judge.</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"Then we have before us a man who was substituted for Arsène
Lupin, two months ago. How do you explain that?"</p>

<p>"I cannot."</p>

<p>In absolute despair, the judge turned to the accused and addressed
him in a conciliatory tone:</p>

<p>"Prisoner, can you tell me how, and since when, you became an
inmate of the Prison de la Santé?"</p>

<p>The engaging manner of the judge was calculated to disarm the
mistrust and awaken the understanding of the accused man. He tried
to reply. Finally, under clever and gentle questioning, he succeeded
in framing a few phrases from which the following story was gleaned:
Two months ago he had been taken to the Dépôt, examined and released.
As he was leaving the building, a free man, he was seized by two
guards and placed in the prison-van. Since then he had occupied
cell 24. He was contented there, plenty to eat, and he slept well&mdash;so
he did not complain.</p>

<p>All that seemed probable; and, amidst the mirth and excitement
of the spectators, the judge adjourned the trial until the story
could be investigated and verified.</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>The following facts were at once established by an examination
of the prison records: Eight weeks before a man named Baudru Désiré
had slept at the Dépôt. He was released the next day, and left
the Dépôt at two o’clock in the afternoon. On the same day at
two o’clock, having been examined for the last time, Arsène Lupin
left the Dépôt in a prison-van.</p>

<p>Had the guards made a mistake? Had they been deceived by the
resemblance and carelessly substituted this man for their prisoner?</p>

<p>Another question suggested itself: Had the substitution been
arranged in advance? In that event Baudru must have been an accomplice
and must have caused his own arrest for the express purpose of
taking Lupin’s place. But then, by what miracle had such a plan,
based on a series of improbable chances, been carried to success?</p>

<p>Baudru Désiré was turned over to the anthropological service;
they had never seen anything like him. However, they easily traced
his past history. He was known at Courbevois, at Asnières and
at Levallois. He lived on alms and slept in one of those rag-picker’s
huts near the barrier de Ternes. He had disappeared from there
a year ago.</p>

<p>Had he been enticed away by Arsène Lupin? There was no evidence
to that effect. And even if that was so, it did not explain the
flight of the prisoner. That still remained a mystery. Amongst
twenty theories which sought to explain it, not one was satisfactory.
Of the escape itself, there was no doubt; an escape that was incomprehensible,
sensational, in which the public, as well as the officers of the
law, could detect a carefully prepared plan, a combination of
circumstances marvelously dove-tailed, whereof the dénouement
fully justified the confident prediction of Arsène Lupin: "I shall
not be present at my trial."</p>

<p>After a month of patient investigation, the problem remained
unsolved. The poor devil of a Baudru could not be kept in prison
indefinitely, and to place him on trial would be ridiculous. There
was no charge against him. Consequently, he was released; but
the chief of the Sûrété resolved to keep him under surveillance.
This idea originated with Ganimard. From his point of view there
was neither complicity nor chance. Baudru was an instrument upon
which Arsène Lupin had played with his extraordinary skill. Baudru,
when set at liberty, would lead them to Arsène Lupin or, at least,
to some of his accomplices. The two inspectors, Folenfant and
Dieuzy, were assigned to assist Ganimard.</p>

<p>One foggy morning in January the prison gates opened and Baudru
Désiré stepped forth&mdash;a free man. At first he appeared to be quite
embarrassed, and walked like a person who has no precise idea
whither he is going. He followed the rue de la Santé and the rue
Saint Jacques. He stopped in front of an old-clothes shop, removed
his jacket and his vest, sold his vest on which he realized a
few sous; then, replacing his jacket, he proceeded on his way.
He crossed the Seine. At the Châtelet an omnibus passed him. He
wished to enter it, but there was no place. The controller advised
him to secure a number, so he entered the waiting-room.</p>

<p>Ganimard called to his two assistants, and, without removing
his eyes from the waiting room, he said to them:</p>

<p>"Stop a carriage.... no, two. That will be better. I will go
with one of you, and we will follow him."</p>

<p>The men obeyed. Yet Baudru did not appear. Ganimard entered the
waiting-room. It was empty.</p>

<p>"Idiot that I am!" he muttered, "I forgot there was another exit."</p>

<p>There was an interior corridor extending from the waiting-room
to the rue Saint Martin. Ganimard rushed through it and arrived
just in time to observe Baudru upon the top of the Batignolles-Jardin
de Plates omnibus as it was turning the corner of the rue de Rivoli.
He ran and caught the omnibus. But he had lost his two assistants.
He must continue the pursuit alone. In his anger he was inclined
to seize the man by the collar without ceremony. Was it not with
premeditation and by means of an ingenious ruse that his pretended
imbecile had separated him from his assistants?</p>

<p>He looked at Baudru. The latter was asleep on the bench, his
head rolling from side to side, his mouth half-opened, and an
incredible expression of stupidity on his blotched face. No, such
an adversary was incapable of deceiving old Ganimard. It was a
stroke of luck&mdash;nothing more.</p>

<p>At the Galleries-Lafayette, the man leaped from the omnibus and
took the La Muette tramway, following the boulevard Haussmann
and the avenue Victor Hugo. Baudru alighted at La Muette station;
and, with a nonchalant air, strolled into the Bois de Boulogne.</p>

<p>He wandered through one path after another, and sometimes retraced
his steps. What was he seeking? Had he any definite object? At
the end of an hour, he appeared to be faint from fatigue, and,
noticing a bench, he sat down. The spot, not far from Auteuil,
on the edge of a pond hidden amongst the trees, was absolutely
deserted. After the lapse of another half-hour, Ganimard became
impatient and resolved to speak to the man. He approached and
took a seat beside Baudru, lighted a cigarette, traced some figures
in the sand with the end of his cane, and said:</p>

<p>"It’s a pleasant day."</p>

<p>No response. But, suddenly the man burst into laughter, a happy,
mirthful laugh, spontaneous and irresistible. Ganimard felt his
hair stand on end in horror and surprise. It was that laugh, that
infernal laugh he knew so well!</p>

<p>With a sudden movement, he seized the man by the collar and looked
at him with a keen, penetrating gaze; and found that he no longer
saw the man Baudru. To be sure, he saw Baudru; but, at the same
time, he saw the other, the real man, Lupin. He discovered the
intense life in the eyes, he filled up the shrunken features,
he perceived the real flesh beneath the flabby skin, the real
mouth through the grimaces that deformed it. Those were the eyes
and mouth of the other, and especially his keen, alert, mocking
expression, so clear and youthful!</p>

<p>"Arsène Lupin, Arsène Lupin," he stammered.</p>

<p>Then, in a sudden fit of rage, he seized Lupin by the throat
and tried to hold him down. In spite of his fifty years, he still
possessed unusual strength, whilst his adversary was apparently
in a weak condition. But the struggle was a brief one. Arsène
Lupin made only a slight movement, and, as suddenly as he had
made the attack, Ganimard released his hold. His right arm fell
inert, useless.</p>

<p>"If you had taken lessons in jiu-jitsu at the quai des Orfèvres,"
said Lupin, "you would know that that blow is called udi-shi-ghi
in Japanese. A second more, and I would have broken your arm and
that would have been just what you deserve. I am surprised that
you, an old friend whom I respect and before whom I voluntarily
expose my incognito, should abuse my confidence in that violent
manner. It is unworthy &mdash;Ah! What’s the matter?"</p>

<p>Ganimard did not reply. That escape for which he deemed himself
responsible&mdash;was it not he, Ganimard, who, by his sensational
evidence, had led the court into serious error? That escape appeared
to him like a dark cloud on his professional career. A tear rolled
down his cheek to his gray moustache.</p>

<p>"Oh! mon Dieu, Ganimard, don’t take it to heart. If you had not
spoken, I would have arranged for some one else to do it. I couldn’t
allow poor Baudru Désiré to be convicted."</p>

<p>"Then," murmured Ganimard, "it was you that was there? And now
you are here?"</p>

<p>"It is I, always I, only I."</p>

<p>"Can it be possible?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is not the work of a sorcerer. Simply, as the judge remarked
at the trial, the apprenticeship of a dozen years that equips
a man to cope successfully with all the obstacles in life."</p>

<p>"But your face? Your eyes?"</p>

<p>"You can understand that if I worked eighteen months with Doctor
Altier at the Saint-Louis hospital, it was not out of love for
the work. I considered that he, who would one day have the honor
of calling himself Arsène Lupin, ought to be exempt from the ordinary
laws governing appearance and identity. Appearance? That can be
modified at will. For instance, a hypodermic injection of paraffine
will puff up the skin at the desired spot. Pyrogallic acid will
change your skin to that of an Indian. The juice of the greater
celandine will adorn you with the most beautiful eruptions and
tumors. Another chemical affects the growth of your beard and
hair; another changes the tone of your voice. Add to that two
months of dieting in cell 24; exercises repeated a thousand times
to enable me to hold my features in a certain grimace, to carry
my head at a certain inclination, and adapt my back and shoulders
to a stooping posture. Then five drops of atropine in the eyes
to make them haggard and wild, and the trick is done."</p>

<p>"I do not understand how you deceived the guards."</p>

<p>"The change was progressive. The evolution was so gradual that
they failed to notice it."</p>

<p>"But Baudru Désiré?"</p>

<p>"Baudru exists. He is a poor, harmless fellow whom I met last
year; and, really, he bears a certain resemblance to me. Considering
my arrest as a possible event, I took charge of Baudru and studied
the points wherein we differed in appearance with a view to correct
them in my own person. My friends caused him to remain at the
Dépôt overnight, and to leave there next day about the same hour
as I did&mdash;a coincidence easily arranged. Of course, it was necessary
to have a record of his detention at the Dépôt in order to establish
the fact that such a person was a reality; otherwise, the police
would have sought elsewhere to find out my identity. But, in offering
to them this excellent Baudru, it was inevitable, you understand,
inevitable that they would seize upon him, and, despite the insurmountable
difficulties of a substitution, they would prefer to believe in
a substitution than confess their ignorance."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, of course," said Ganimard.</p>

<p>"And then," exclaimed Arsène Lupin, "I held in my hands a trump-card:
an anxious public watching and waiting for my escape. And that
is the fatal error into which you fell, you and the others, in
the course of that fascinating game pending between me and the
officers of the law wherein the stake was my liberty. And you
supposed that I was playing to the gallery; that I was intoxicated
with my success. I, Arsène Lupin, guilty of such weakness! Oh,
no! And, no longer ago than the Cahorn affair, you said: "When
Arsène Lupin cries from the housetops that he will escape, he
has some object in view." But, sapristi, you must understand that
in order to escape I must create, in advance, a public belief
in that escape, a belief amounting to an article of faith, an
absolute conviction, a reality as glittering as the sun. And I
did create that belief that Arsène Lupin would escape, that Arsène
Lupin would not be present at his trial. And when you gave your
evidence and said: "That man is not Arsène Lupin," everybody was
prepared to believe you. Had one person doubted it, had any one
uttered this simple restriction: Suppose it is Arsène Lupin?&mdash;from
that moment, I was lost. If anyone had scrutinized my face, not
imbued with the idea that I was not Arsène Lupin, as you and the
others did at my trial, but with the idea that I might be Arsène
Lupin; then, despite all my precautions, I should have been recognized.
But I had no fear. Logically, psychologically, no once could entertain
the idea that I was Arsène Lupin."</p>

<p>He grasped Ganimard’s hand.</p>

<p>"Come, Ganimard, confess that on the Wednesday after our conversation
in the prison de la Santé, you expected me at your house at four
o’clock, exactly as I said I would go."</p>

<p>"And your prison-van?" said Ganimard, evading the question.</p>

<p>"A bluff! Some of my friends secured that old unused van and
wished to make the attempt. But I considered it impractical without
the concurrence of a number of unusual circumstances. However,
I found it useful to carry out that attempted escape and give
it the widest publicity. An audaciously planned escape, though
not completed, gave to the succeeding one the character of reality
simply by anticipation."</p>

<p>"So that the cigar...."</p>

<p>"Hollowed by myself, as well as the knife."</p>

<p>"And the letters?"</p>

<p>"Written by me."</p>

<p>"And the mysterious correspondent?"</p>

<p>"Did not exist."</p>

<p>Ganimard reflected a moment, then said:</p>

<p>"When the anthropological service had Baudru’s case under consideration,
why did they not perceive that his measurements coincided with
those of Arsène Lupin?"</p>

<p>"My measurements are not in existence."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"At least, they are false. I have given considerable attention
to that question. In the first place, the Bertillon system records
the visible marks of identification&mdash;and you have seen that they
are not infallible&mdash;and, after that, the measurements of the head,
the fingers, the ears, etc. Of course, such measurements are more
or less infallible."</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"No; but it costs money to get around them. Before we left America,
one of the employees of the service there accepted so much money
to insert false figures in my measurements. Consequently, Baudru’s
measurements should not agree with those of Arsène Lupin."</p>

<p>After a short silence, Ganimard asked:</p>

<p>"What are you going to do now?"</p>

<p>"Now," replied Lupin, "I am going to take a rest, enjoy the best
of food and drink and gradually recover my former healthy condition.
It is all very well to become Baudru or some other person, on
occasion, and to change your personality as you do your shirt,
but you soon grow weary of the change. I feel exactly as I imagine
the man who lost his shadow must have felt, and I shall be glad
to be Arsène Lupin once more."</p>

<p>He walked to and fro for a few minutes, then, stopping in front
of Ganimard, he said:</p>

<p>"You have nothing more to say, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I should like to know if you intend to reveal the true
state of facts connected with your escape. The mistake that I
made&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh! no one will ever know that it was Arsène Lupin who was discharged.
It is to my own interest to surround myself with mystery, and
therefore I shall permit my escape to retain its almost miraculous
character. So, have no fear on that score, my dear friend. I shall
say nothing. And now, good-bye. I am going out to dinner this
evening, and have only sufficient time to dress."</p>

<p>"I though you wanted a rest."</p>

<p>"Ah! there are duties to society that one cannot avoid. To-morrow,
I shall rest."</p>

<p>"Where do you dine to-night?"</p>

<p>"With the British Ambassador!"</p>
