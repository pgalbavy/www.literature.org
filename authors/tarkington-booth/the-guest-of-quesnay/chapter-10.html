<p>I had finished dressing, next morning, and was strapping my things
together for the day's campaign, when I heard a shuffling step
upon the porch, and the door opened gently, without any previous
ceremony of knocking. To my angle of vision what at first appeared
to have opened it was a tray of coffee, rolls, eggs, and a packet
of sandwiches, but, after hesitating somewhat, this apparition
advanced farther into the room, disclosing a pair of supporting
hands, followed in due time by the whole person of a nervously
smiling and visibly apprehensive Amedee. He closed the door behind
him by the simple action of backing against it, took the cloth
from his arm, and with a single gesture spread it neatly upon
a small table, then, turning to me, laid the forefinger of his
right hand warningly upon his lips and bowed me a deferential
invitation to occupy the chair beside the table.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, glaring at him, "what ails you?"</p>

<p>"I thought monsieur might prefer his breakfast indoors, this
morning," he returned in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Why should I?"</p>

<p>The miserable old man said something I did not understand&mdash;an
incoherent syllable or two&mdash;suddenly covered his mouth with both
hands, and turned away. I heard a catch in his throat; suffocated
sounds issued from his bosom; however, it was nothing more than
a momentary seizure, and, recovering command of himself by a powerful
effort, he faced me with hypocritical servility.</p>

<p>"Why do you laugh?" I asked indignantly.</p>

<p>"But I did not laugh," he replied in a husky whisper. "Not at
all."</p>

<p>"You did," I asserted, raising my voice. "It almost killed you!"</p>

<p>"Monsieur," he begged hoarsely, "<em>HUSH</em>!"</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" I demanded loudly. "What do you mean by
these abominable croakings? Speak out!"</p>

<p>"Monsieur&mdash;" he gesticulated in a panic, toward the courtyard.
"Mademoiselle Ward is out there."</p>

<p>"<em>WHAT!" </em>But I did not shout the word.</p>

<p>"There is always a little window in the rear wall," he breathed
in my ear as I dropped into the chair by the table. "She would
not see you if&mdash;"</p>

<p>I interrupted with all the French rough-and-ready expressions
of dislike at my command, daring to hope that they might give
him some shadowy, far-away idea of what I thought of both himself
and his suggestions, and, notwithstanding the difficulty of expressing
strong feeling in whispers, it seemed to me that, in a measure,
I succeeded. "I am not in the habit of crawling out of ventilators,"
I added, subduing a tendency to vehemence. "And probably Mademoiselle
Ward has only come to talk with Madame Brossard."</p>

<p>"I fear some of those people may have told her you were here,"
he ventured insinuatingly.</p>

<p>"What people?" I asked, drinking my coffee calmly, yet, it must
be confessed, without quite the deliberation I could have wished.</p>

<p>"Those who stopped yesterday evening on the way to the chateau.
They might have recognised&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Impossible. I knew none of them."</p>

<p>"But Mademoiselle Ward knows that you are here. Without doubt."</p>

<p>"Why do you say so?"</p>

<p>"Because she has inquired for you."</p>

<p>"So!" I rose at once and went toward the door. "Why didn't you
tell me at once?"</p>

<p>"But surely," he remonstrated, ignoring my question, "monsieur
will make some change of attire?"</p>

<p>"Change of attire?" I echoed.</p>

<p>"Eh, the poor old coat all hunched at the shoulders and spotted
with paint!"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't it be?" I hissed, thoroughly irritated. "Do you
take me for a racing marquis?"</p>

<p>"But monsieur has a coat much more as a coat ought to be. And
Jean Ferret says&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha, now we're getting at it!" said I. "What does Jean Ferret
say?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would be better if I did not repeat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Out with it! What does Jean Ferret say?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, Mademoiselle Ward's maid from Paris has told Jean
Ferret that monsieur and Mademoiselle Ward have corresponded for
years, and that&mdash;and that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on," I bade him ominously.</p>

<p>"That monsieur has sent Mademoiselle Ward many expensive jewels,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aha!" said I, at which he paused abruptly, and stood staring
at me. The idea of explaining Miss Elizabeth's collection to him,
of getting anything whatever through that complacent head of his,
was so hopeless that I did not even consider it. There was only
one thing to do, and perhaps I should have done it &mdash;I do
not know, for he saw the menace coiling in my eye, and hurriedly
retreated.</p>

<p>"Monsieur!" he gasped, backing away from me, and as his hand,
fumbling behind him, found the latch of the door, he opened it,
and scrambled out by a sort of spiral movement round the casing.
When I followed, a moment later&mdash;with my traps on my shoulder
and the packet of sandwiches in my pocket&mdash;he was out of sight.</p>

<p>Miss Elizabeth sat beneath the arbour at the other end of the
courtyard, and beside her stood the trim and glossy bay saddle-horse
that she had ridden from Quesnay, his head outstretched above
his mistress to paddle at the vine leaves with a tremulous upper
lip. She checked his desire with a slight movement of her hand
upon the bridle-rein; and he arched his neck prettily, pawing
the gravel with a neat forefoot. Miss Elizabeth is one of the
few large women I have known to whom a riding-habit is entirely
becoming, and this group of two&mdash;a handsome woman and her handsome
horse&mdash;has had a charm for all men ever since horses were tamed
and women began to be beautiful. I thought of my work, of the
canvases I meant to cover, but I felt the charm&mdash;and I felt it
stirringly. It was a fine, fresh morning, and the sun just risen.</p>

<p>An expression in the lady's attitude, and air which I instinctively
construed as histrionic, seemed intended to convey that she had
been kept waiting, yet had waited without reproach; and although
she must have heard me coming, she did not look toward me until
I was quite near and spoke her name. At that she sprang up quickly
enough, and stretched out her hand to me.</p>

<p>"Run to earth!" she cried, advancing a step to meet me.</p>

<p>"A pretty poor trophy of the chase," said I, "but proud that
you are its killer."</p>

<p>To my surprise and mystification, her cheeks and brow flushed
rosily; she was obviously conscious of it, and laughed.</p>

<p>"Don't be embarrassed," she said.</p>

<p>"I!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you, poor man! I suppose I couldn't have more thoroughly
compromised you. Madame Brossard will never believe in your respectability
again."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she will," said I.</p>

<p>"What? A lodger who has ladies calling upon him at five o'clock
in the morning? But your bundle's on your shoulder," she rattled
on, laughing, "though there's many could be bolder, and perhaps
you'll let me walk a bit of the way with you, if you're for the
road."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I will," said I. She caught up her riding-skirt, fastening
it by a clasp at her side, and we passed out through the archway
and went slowly along the road bordering the forest, her horse
following obediently at half-rein's length.</p>

<p>"When did you hear that I was at Madame Brossard's?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Ten minutes after I returned to Quesnay, late yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>"Who told you?"</p>

<p>"Louise."</p>

<p>I repeated the name questioningly. "You mean Mrs. Larrabee Harman?"</p>

<p>"Louise Harman," she corrected. "Didn't you know she was staying
at Quesnay?"</p>

<p>"I guessed it, though Amedee got the name confused."</p>

<p>"Yes, she's been kind enough to look after the place for us while
we were away. George won't be back for another ten days, and I've
been overseeing an exhibition for him in London. Afterward I did
a round of visits&mdash;tiresome enough, but among people it's well
to keep in touch with on George's account."</p>

<p>"I see," I said, with a grimness which probably escaped her.
"But how did Mrs. Harman know that I was at Les Trois Pigeons?"</p>

<p>"She met you once in the forest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Twice," I interrupted.</p>

<p>"She mentioned only once. Of course she'd often heard both George
and me speak of you."</p>

<p>"But how did she know it was I and where I was staying?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that?" Her smile changed to a laugh. "Your maitre d'hotel
told Ferret, a gardener at Quesnay, that you were at the inn."</p>

<p>"He did!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but you mustn't be angry with him; he made it quite all
right."</p>

<p>"How did he do that?" I asked, trying to speak calmly, though
there was that in my mind which might have blanched the parchment
cheek of a grand inquisitor.</p>

<p>"He told Ferret that you were very anxious not to have it known&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You call that making it all right?"</p>

<p>"For himself, I mean. He asked Ferret not to mention who it was
that told him."</p>

<p>"The rascal!" I cried. "The treacherous, brazen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unfortunate man," said Miss Elizabeth, "don't you see how clear
you're making it that you really meant to hide from us?"</p>

<p>There seemed to be something in that, and my tirade broke up
in confusion. "Oh, no," I said lamely, "I hoped &mdash;I hoped&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be careful!"</p>

<p>"No; I hoped to work down here," I blurted. "And I thought if
I saw too much of you &mdash;I might not."</p>

<p>She looked at me with widening eyes. "And I can take my choice,"
she cried, "of all the different things you may mean by that!
It's either the most outrageous speech I ever heard&mdash;or the most
flattering."</p>

<p>"But I meant simply&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No." She lifted her hand and stopped me. "I'd rather believe
that I have at least the choice&mdash;and let it go at that." And as
I began to laugh, she turned to me with a gravity apparently so
genuine that for the moment I was fatuous enough to believe that
she had said it seriously. Ensued a pause of some duration, which,
for my part, I found disturbing. She broke it with a change of
subject.</p>

<p>"You think Louise very lovely to look at, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Exquisite," I answered.</p>

<p>"Every one does."</p>

<p>"I suppose she told you&mdash;" and now I felt myself growing red&mdash;"that
I behaved like a drunken acrobat when she came upon me in the
path."</p>

<p>"No. Did you?" cried Miss Elizabeth, with a ready credulity which
I thought by no means pretty; indeed, she seemed amused and, to
my surprise (for she is not an unkind woman), rather heartlessly
pleased. "Louise only said she knew it must be you, and that she
wished she could have had a better look at what you were painting."</p>

<p>"Heaven bless her!" I exclaimed. "Her reticence was angelic."</p>

<p>"Yes, she has reticence," said my companion, with enough of the
same quality to make me look at her quickly. A thin line had been
drawn across her forehead.</p>

<p>"You mean she's still reticent with George?" I ventured.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered sadly. "Poor George always hopes, of course,
in the silent way of his kind when they suffer from such unfortunate
passions&mdash;and he waits."</p>

<p>"I suppose that former husband of hers recovered?"</p>

<p>"I believe he's still alive somewhere. Locked up, I hope!" she
finished crisply.</p>

<p>"She retained his name," I observed.</p>

<p>"Harman? Yes, she retained it," said my companion rather shortly.</p>

<p>"At all events, she's rid of him, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she's <em>RID </em>of him!" Her tone implied an enigmatic
reservation of some kind.</p>

<p>"It's hard," I reflected aloud, "hard to understand her making
that mistake, young as she was. Even in the glimpses of her I've
had, it was easy to see something of what she's like: a fine,
rare, high type&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you didn't know <em>HIM, </em>did you?" Miss Elizabeth asked
with some dryness.</p>

<p>"No," I answered. "I saw him twice; once at the time of his accident&mdash;that
was only a nightmare, his face covered with&mdash;" I shivered. "But
I had caught a glimpse of him on the boulevard, and of all the
dreadful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, but he wasn't always dreadful," she interposed quickly.
"He was a fascinating sort of person, quite charming and good-looking,
when she ran away with him, though he was horribly dissipated
even then. He always had been <em>THAT. </em>Of course she thought
she'd be able to straighten him out&mdash;poor girl! She tried, for
three years&mdash;three years it hurts one to think of! You see it
must have been something very like a 'grand passion' to hold her
through a pain three years long."</p>

<p>"Or tremendous pride," said I. "Women make an odd world of it
for the rest of us. There was good old George, as true and straight
a man as ever lived&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And she took the other! Yes." George's sister laughed sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"But George and she have both survived the mistake," I went on
with confidence. "Her tragedy must have taught her some important
differences. Haven't you a notion she'll be tremendously glad
to see him when he comes back from America?"</p>

<p>"Ah, I do hope so!" she cried. "You see, I'm fearing that he
hopes so too&mdash;to the degree of counting on it."</p>

<p>"You don't count on it yourself?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "With any other woman I should."</p>

<p>"Why not with Mrs. Harman?"</p>

<p>"Cousin Louise has her ways," said Miss Elizabeth slowly, and,
whether she could not further explain her doubts, or whether she
would not, that was all I got out of her on the subject at the
time. I asked one or two more questions, but my companion merely
shook her head again, alluding vaguely to her cousin's "ways."
Then she brightened suddenly, and inquired when I would have my
things sent up to the chateau from the inn.</p>

<p>At the risk of a misunderstanding which I felt I could ill afford,
I resisted her kind hospitality, and the outcome of it was that
there should be a kind of armistice, to begin with my dining at
the chateau that evening. Thereupon she mounted to the saddle,
a bit of gymnastics for which she declined my assistance, and
looked down upon me from a great height.</p>

<p>"Did anybody ever tell you," was her surprising inquiry, "that
you are the queerest man of these times?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered. "Don't you think you're a queerer woman?"</p>

<p>"<em>FOOTLE!" </em>she cried scornfully. "Be off to your woods
and your woodscaping!"</p>

<p>The bay horse departed at a smart gait, not, I was glad to see,
a parkish trot &mdash;Miss Elizabeth wisely set limits to her
sacrifices to Mode&mdash;and she was far down the road before I had
passed the outer fringe of trees.</p>

<p>My work was accomplished after a fashion more or less desultory
that day; I had many absent moments, was restless, and walked
more than I painted. Oliver Saffron did not join me in the late
afternoon; nor did the echo of distant yodelling bespeak any effort
on his part to find me. So I gave him up, and returned to the
inn earlier than usual.</p>

<p>While dressing I sent word to Professor Keredec that I should
not be able to join him at dinner that evening; and it is to be
recorded that Glouglou carried the message for me. Amedee did
not appear, from which it may be inferred that our maitre d'hotel
was subject to lucid intervals. Certainly his present shyness
indicated an intelligence of no low order.</p>
