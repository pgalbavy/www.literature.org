<p>But no brush was able to efface completely the expression of
happiness, so that Mrs. Ambrose could not treat them when they
came downstairs as if they had spent the morning in a way that
could be discussed naturally. This being so, she joined in the
world's conspiracy to consider them for the time incapacitated
from the business of life, struck by their intensity of feeling
into enmity against life, and almost succeeded in dismissing them
from her thoughts.</p>

<p>She reflected that she had done all that it was necessary to
do in practical matters. She had written a great many letters,
and had obtained Willoughby's consent. She had dwelt so often
upon Mr. Hewet's prospects, his profession, his birth, appearance,
and temperament, that she had almost forgotten what he was really
like. When she refreshed herself by a look at him, she used to
wonder again what he was like, and then, concluding that they
were happy at any rate, thought no more about it.</p>

<p>She might more profitably consider what would happen in three
years' time, or what might have happened if Rachel had been left
to explore the world under her father's guidance. The result,
she was honest enough to own, might have been better&mdash;who knows?
She did not disguise from herself that Terence had faults. She
was inclined to think him too easy and tolerant, just as he was
inclined to think her perhaps a trifle hard&mdash;no, it was rather
that she was uncompromising. In some ways she found St. John preferable;
but then, of course, he would never have suited Rachel. Her friendship
with St. John was established, for although she fluctuated between
irritation and interest in a way that did credit to the candour
of her disposition, she liked his company on the whole. He took
her outside this little world of love and emotion. He had a grasp
of facts. Supposing, for instance, that England made a sudden
move towards some unknown port on the coast of Morocco, St. John
knew what was at the back of it, and to hear him engaged with
her husband in argument about finance and the balance of power,
gave her an odd sense of stability. She respected their arguments
without always listening to them, much as she respected a solid
brick wall, or one of those immense municipal buildings which,
although they compose the greater part of our cities, have been
built day after day and year after year by unknown hands. She
liked to sit and listen, and even felt a little elated when the
engaged couple, after showing their profound lack of interest,
slipped from the room, and were seen pulling flowers to pieces
in the garden. It was not that she was jealous of them, but she
did undoubtedly envy them their great unknown future that lay
before them. Slipping from one such thought to another, she was
at the dining-room with fruit in her hands. Sometimes she stopped
to straighten a candle stooping with the heat, or disturbed some
too rigid arrangement of the chairs. She had reason to suspect
that Chailey had been balancing herself on the top of a ladder
with a wet duster during their absence, and the room had never
been quite like itself since. Returning from the dining-room for
the third time, she perceived that one of the arm-chairs was now
occupied by St. John. He lay back in it, with his eyes half shut,
looking, as he always did, curiously buttoned up in a neat grey
suit and fenced against the exuberance of a foreign climate which
might at any moment proceed to take liberties with him. Her eyes
rested on him gently and then passed on over his head. Finally
she took the chair opposite.</p>

<p>"I didn't want to come here," he said at last, "but I was positively
driven to it. . . . Evelyn M.," he groaned.</p>

<p>He sat up, and began to explain with mock solemnity how the detestable
woman was set upon marrying him.</p>

<p>"She pursues me about the place. This morning she appeared in
the smoking-room. All I could do was to seize my hat and fly.
I didn't want to come, but I couldn't stay and face another meal
with her."</p>

<p>"Well, we must make the best of it," Helen replied philosophically.
It was very hot, and they were indifferent to any amount of silence,
so that they lay back in their chairs waiting for something to
happen. The bell rang for luncheon, but there was no sound of
movement in the house. Was there any news? Helen asked; anything
in the papers? St. John shook his head. O yes, he had a letter
from home, a letter from his mother, describing the suicide of
the parlour-maid. She was called Susan Jane, and she came into
the kitchen one afternoon, and said that she wanted cook to keep
her money for her; she had twenty pounds in gold. Then she went
out to buy herself a hat. She came in at half-past five and said
that she had taken poison. They had only just time to get her
into bed and call a doctor before she died.</p>

<p>"Well?" Helen enquired.</p>

<p>"There'll have to be an inquest," said St. John.</p>

<p>Why had she done it? He shrugged his shoulders. Why do people
kill themselves? Why do the lower orders do any of the things
they do do? Nobody knows. They sat in silence.</p>

<p>"The bell's run fifteen minutes and they're not down," said Helen
at length.</p>

<p>When they appeared, St. John explained why it had been necessary
for him to come to luncheon. He imitated Evelyn's enthusiastic
tone as she confronted him in the smoking-room. "She thinks there
can be nothing <em>quite</em> so thrilling as mathematics, so
I've lent her a large work in two volumes. It'll be interesting
to see what she makes of it."</p>

<p>Rachel could now afford to laugh at him. She reminded him of
Gibbon; she had the first volume somewhere still; if he were undertaking
the education of Evelyn, that surely was the test; or she had
heard that Burke, upon the American Rebellion &mdash;Evelyn ought
to read them both simultaneously. When St. John had disposed of
her argument and had satisfied his hunger, he proceeded to tell
them that the hotel was seething with scandals, some of the most
appalling kind, which had happened in their absence; he was indeed
much given to the study of his kind.</p>

<p>"Evelyn M., for example&mdash;but that was told me in confidence."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" Terence interposed.</p>

<p>"You've heard about poor Sinclair, too?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I've heard about Sinclair. He's retired to his mine
with a revolver. He writes to Evelyn daily that he's thinking
of committing suicide. I've assured her that he's never been so
happy in his life, and, on the whole, she's inclined to agree
with me."</p>

<p>"But then she's entangled herself with Perrott," St. John continued;
"and I have reason to think, from something I saw in the passage,
that everything isn't as it should be between Arthur and Susan.
There's a young female lately arrived from Manchester. A very
good thing if it were broken off, in my opinion. Their married
life is something too horrible to contemplate. Oh, and I distinctly
heard old Mrs. Paley rapping out the most fearful oaths as I passed
her bedroom door. It's supposed that she tortures her maid in
private&mdash;it's practically certain she does. One can tell it from
the look in her eyes."</p>

<p>"When you're eighty and the gout tweezes you, you'll be swearing
like a trooper," Terence remarked. "You'll be very fat, very testy,
very disagreeable. Can't you imagine him&mdash;bald as a coot, with
a pair of sponge-bag trousers, a little spotted tie, and a corporation?"</p>

<p>After a pause Hirst remarked that the worst infamy had still
to be told. He addressed himself to Helen.</p>

<p>"They've hoofed out the prostitute. One night while we were away
that old numskull Thornbury was doddering about the passages very
late. (Nobody seems to have asked him what <em>he</em> was up
to.) He saw the Signora Lola Mendoza, as she calls herself, cross
the passage in her nightgown. He communicated his suspicions next
morning to Elliot, with the result that Rodriguez went to the
woman and gave her twenty-four hours in which to clear out of
the place. No one seems to have enquired into the truth of the
story, or to have asked Thornbury and Elliot what business it
was of theirs; they had it entirely their own way. I propose that
we should all sign a Round Robin, go to Rodriguez in a body, and
insist upon a full enquiry. Something's got to be done, don't
you agree?"</p>

<p>Hewet remarked that there could be no doubt as to the lady's
profession.</p>

<p>"Still," he added, "it's a great shame, poor woman; only I don't
see what's to be done&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you, St. John," Helen burst out. "It's monstrous.
The hypocritical smugness of the English makes my blood boil.
A man who's made a fortune in trade as Mr. Thornbury has is bound
to be twice as bad as any prostitute."</p>

<p>She respected St. John's morality, which she took far more seriously
than any one else did, and now entered into a discussion with
him as to the steps that were to be taken to enforce their peculiar
view of what was right. The argument led to some profoundly gloomy
statements of a general nature. Who were they, after all&mdash;what
authority had they&mdash;what power against the mass of superstition
and ignorance? It was the English, of course; there must be something
wrong in the English blood. Directly you met an English person,
of the middle classes, you were conscious of an indefinable sensation
of loathing; directly you saw the brown crescent of houses above
Dover, the same thing came over you. But unfortunately St. John
added, you couldn't trust these foreigners&mdash;</p>

<p>They were interrupted by sounds of strife at the further end
of the table. Rachel appealed to her aunt.</p>

<p>"Terence says we must go to tea with Mrs. Thornbury because she's
been so kind, but I don't see it; in fact, I'd rather have my
right hand sawn in pieces&mdash;just imagine! the eyes of all those
women!"</p>

<p>"Fiddlesticks, Rachel," Terence replied. "Who wants to look at
you? You're consumed with vanity! You're a monster of conceit!
Surely, Helen, you ought to have taught her by this time that
she's a person of no conceivable importance whatever&mdash;not beautiful,
or well dressed, or conspicuous for elegance or intellect, or
deportment. A more ordinary sight than you are," he concluded,
"except for the tear across your dress has never been seen. However,
stay at home if you want to. I'm going."</p>

<p>She appealed again to her aunt. It wasn't the being looked at,
she explained, but the things people were sure to say. The women
in particular. She liked women, but where emotion was concerned
they were as flies on a lump of sugar. They would be certain to
ask her questions. Evelyn M. would say: "Are you in love? Is it
nice being in love?" And Mrs. Thornbury&mdash;her eyes would go up
and down, up and down&mdash;she shuddered at the thought of it. Indeed,
the retirement of their life since their engagement had made her
so sensitive, that she was not exaggerating her case.</p>

<p>She found an ally in Helen, who proceeded to expound her views
of the human race, as she regarded with complacency the pyramid
of variegated fruits in the centre of the table. It wasn't that
they were cruel, or meant to hurt, or even stupid exactly; but
she had always found that the ordinary person had so little emotion
in his own life that the scent of it in the lives of others was
like the scent of blood in the nostrils of a bloodhound. Warming
to the theme, she continued:</p>

<p>"Directly anything happens&mdash;it may be a marriage, or a birth,
or a death&mdash;on the whole they prefer it to be a death&mdash;every one
wants to see you. They insist upon seeing you. They've got nothing
to say; they don't care a rap for you; but you've got to go to
lunch or to tea or to dinner, and if you don't you're damned.
It's the smell of blood," she continued; "I don't blame 'em; only
they shan't have mine if I know it!"</p>

<p>She looked about her as if she had called up a legion of human
beings, all hostile and all disagreeable, who encircled the table,
with mouths gaping for blood, and made it appear a little island
of neutral country in the midst of the enemy's country.</p>

<p>Her words roused her husband, who had been muttering rhythmically
to himself, surveying his guests and his food and his wife with
eyes that were now melancholy and now fierce, according to the
fortunes of the lady in his ballad. He cut Helen short with a
protest. He hated even the semblance of cynicism in women. "Nonsense,
nonsense," he remarked abruptly.</p>

<p>Terence and Rachel glanced at each other across the table, which
meant that when they were married they would not behave like that.
The entrance of Ridley into the conversation had a strange effect.
It became at once more formal and more polite. It would have been
impossible to talk quite easily of anything that came into their
heads, and to say the word prostitute as simply as any other word.
The talk now turned upon literature and politics, and Ridley told
stories of the distinguished people he had known in his youth.
Such talk was of the nature of an art, and the personalities and
informalities of the young were silenced. As they rose to go,
Helen stopped for a moment, leaning her elbows on the table.</p>

<p>"You've all been sitting here," she said, "for almost an hour,
and you haven't noticed my figs, or my flowers, or the way the
light comes through, or anything. I haven't been listening, because
I've been looking at you. You looked very beautiful; I wish you'd
go on sitting for ever."</p>

<p>She led the way to the drawing-room, where she took up her embroidery,
and began again to dissuade Terence from walking down to the hotel
in this heat. But the more she dissuaded, the more he was determined
to go. He became irritated and obstinate. There were moments when
they almost disliked each other. He wanted other people; he wanted
Rachel, to see them with him. He suspected that Mrs. Ambrose would
now try to dissuade her from going. He was annoyed by all this
space and shade and beauty, and Hirst, recumbent, drooping a magazine
from his wrist.</p>

<p>"I'm going," he repeated. "Rachel needn't come unless she wants
to."</p>

<p>"If you go, Hewet, I wish you'd make enquiries about the prostitute,"
said Hirst. "Look here," he added, "I'll walk half the way with
you."</p>

<p>Greatly to their surprise he raised himself, looked at his watch,
and remarked that, as it was now half an hour since luncheon,
the gastric juices had had sufficient time to secrete; he was
trying a system, he explained, which involved short spells of
exercise interspaced by longer intervals of rest.</p>

<p>"I shall be back at four," he remarked to Helen, "when I shall
lie down on the sofa and relax all my muscles completely."</p>

<p>"So you're going, Rachel?" Helen asked. "You won't stay with
me?"</p>

<p>She smiled, but she might have been sad.</p>

<p>Was she sad, or was she really laughing? Rachel could not tell,
and she felt for the moment very uncomfortable between Helen and
Terence. Then she turned away, saying merely that she would go
with Terence, on condition that he did all the talking.</p>

<p>A narrow border of shadow ran along the road, which was broad
enough for two, but not broad enough for three. St. John therefore
dropped a little behind the pair, and the distance between them
increased by degrees. Walking with a view to digestion, and with
one eye upon his watch, he looked from time to time at the pair
in front of him. They seemed to be so happy, so intimate, although
they were walking side by side much as other people walk. They
turned slightly toward each other now and then, and said something
which he thought must be something very private. They were really
disputing about Helen's character, and Terence was trying to explain
why it was that she annoyed him so much sometimes. But St. John
thought that they were saying things which they did not want him
to hear, and was led to think of his own isolation. These people
were happy, and in some ways he despised them for being made happy
so simply, and in other ways he envied them. He was much more
remarkable than they were, but he was not happy. People never
liked him; he doubted sometimes whether even Helen liked him.
To be simple, to be able to say simply what one felt, without
the terrific self-consciousness which possessed him, and showed
him his own face and words perpetually in a mirror, that would
be worth almost any other gift, for it made one happy. Happiness,
happiness, what was happiness? He was never happy. He saw too
clearly the little vices and deceits and flaws of life, and, seeing
them, it seemed to him honest to take notice of them. That was
the reason, no doubt, why people generally disliked him, and complained
that he was heartless and bitter. Certainly they never told him
the things he wanted to be told, that he was nice and kind, and
that they liked him. But it was true that half the sharp things
that he said about them were said because he was unhappy or hurt
himself. But he admitted that he had very seldom told any one
that he cared for them, and when he had been demonstrative, he
had generally regretted it afterwards. His feelings about Terence
and Rachel were so complicated that he had never yet been able
to bring himself to say that he was glad that they were going
to be married. He saw their faults so clearly, and the inferior
nature of a great deal of their feeling for each other, and he
expected that their love would not last. He looked at them again,
and, very strangely, for he was so used to thinking that he seldom
saw anything, the look of them filled him with a simple emotion
of affection in which there were some traces of pity also. What,
after all, did people's faults matter in comparison with what
was good in them? He resolved that he would now tell them what
he felt. He quickened his pace and came up with them just as they
reached the corner where the lane joined the main road. They stood
still and began to laugh at him, and to ask him whether the gastric
juices&mdash;but he stopped them and began to speak very quickly and
stiffly.</p>

<p>"D'you remember the morning after the dance?" he demanded. "It
was here we sat, and you talked nonsense, and Rachel made little
heaps of stones. I, on the other hand, had the whole meaning of
life revealed to me in a flash." He paused for a second, and drew
his lips together in a tight little purse. "Love," he said. "It
seems to me to explain everything. So, on the whole, I'm very
glad that you two are going to be married." He then turned round
abruptly, without looking at them, and walked back to the villa.
He felt both exalted and ashamed of himself for having thus said
what he felt. Probably they were laughing at him, probably they
thought him a fool, and, after all, had he really said what he
felt?</p>

<p>It was true that they laughed when he was gone; but the dispute
about Helen which had become rather sharp, ceased, and they became
peaceful and friendly.</p>
