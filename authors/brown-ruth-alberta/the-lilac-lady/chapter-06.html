<p>Allee's cold was no better Monday morning, but it was decided
that Peace should go alone to the new parsonage on Hill Street,
with the promise that if possible the younger child should join
her before the week's visit was ended. So Peace departed. But
it was with a heavy heart that she went, for, much as she wanted
to see her former pastor's family, she dreaded being separated
from this dearest of sisters even for seven days; nor could she
shake off the vague feeling of unrest which had gripped her when
she saw the sick, sorrowful look in Allee's great blue eyes as
they said good-bye.</p>

<p>"Get well quick, dear," she whispered tenderly, holding the tiny,
hot hand against her cheek after a quaint fashion they had of
saying good-night to each other. "I can't have a good time even
with Saint Elspeth and Glen if you are at home sick. Take your
med'cine like a good girl, and about Wednesday I 'xpect Saint
John will be coming after you if grandpa hasn't brought you before."</p>

<p>And Allee had promised to do her best, but Peace could not forget
her last glimpse of the wistful, flushed face, pressed against
the window-pane to watch her out of sight around the corner. And
so sober was she that Jud, who was driving her to the dovecote
on the hill, looked around inquiringly more than once, and finally
ventured to ask, "Have you caught cold, too?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" she flung back at him. "I'm never sick. Why?"</p>

<p>"Your eyes look pretty red."</p>

<p>His ruse was effective, for in trying to see herself in a tiny
scrap of a mirror which she carried in her satchel, she forgot
her desire to cry, and looked as gay and chipper as usual when
the carriage drew up at the parsonage curbing and Mr. Strong bounded
boyishly down the walk to meet her, holding his beautiful year-old
boy on one arm, and dragging the sweet girl wife by the other.</p>

<p>"Oh, but it's good to see you again!" cried Peace, vaulting over
the wheels to the ground before either Jud or the minister could
lift her down. "It doesn't seem 'sif you'd really moved to Martindale
to live. How did it happen? Grandpa couldn't make me understand
about bishops and preachers and congregations, but I'm glad you've
come. Did you have a hard time getting out of Parker and was there
a farewell reception? Ain't it too bad Faith wasn't there to make
you another cake? Mercy! How the baby has grown! Why, I b'lieve
he knows me. He wants to come. Oh, he ain't too heavy and I won't
break his precious neck, will I, Glen? How do you like my new
dress and did you get my hand-satchel 'fore Jud drove off? I forgot
all about it the minute I saw the baby. Grandpa was going to bring
me, but the faculty had to plan a meeting for this morning, of
course, and grandma couldn't come on account of Allee's cold.
What a cute little house you've got! It looks wholer than the
Parker parsonage. I'm just dying to see all the little cubby-holes
and closets. How many rooms are there?"</p>

<p>"It is the same old Peace, Elizabeth," laughed Mr. Strong, rescuing
his boy and leading the way to the house. "Prosperity has not
changed her a whit. She has hundreds of questions stored up under
that curly wig waiting to be asked. I can see them sticking out
all over her. My dear, you are here for a week's visit. Don't
choke yourself trying to ask everything in one breath, but 'walk
into our parlor' and we will show you all we have, and let you
rummage to your heart's content."</p>

<p>So they initiated her into the mysteries of the new parsonage
with its pretty, cheerful rooms, unexpected cosy corners, tiny
kitchen and cunning little cupboard, and for a week she fairly
revelled in the playhouse, as she immediately named the spandy
new cottage, amusing the baby, who promptly attached himself to
her with the devotion of a lap-dog, dusting furniture, washing
dishes, and causing her usual commotion trying to help where her
presence was only a hindrance. But they enjoyed it! Oh, dear,
yes! Her quaint speeches were a constant delight to them, and
the sight of her somber brown eyes, so at odds with her merry
disposition, and the sound of her gay whistle or rippling little
giggle were like the breath of spring to these homesick hearts.</p>

<p>So the days slipped happily by in the dovecote on the hill, in
spite of Peace's vague fears for the little sister at home who
did not get well enough to join them; and before anyone was aware
of it, the whole week was gone and Sunday night had arrived. The
evening service was over, Peace had said good-night to the pastor
and his wife, and the house was in darkness when suddenly there
was the sound of hurried steps on the walk, the door-bell jangled
harshly, and the brown eyes in the room across the hall flew open
just as the front door closed with a bang, and Mrs. Strong's frightened
voice called through the darkness, "What is it, John? A telegram?"</p>

<p>"A messenger boy."</p>

<p>"Oh, what is the trouble? Someone hurt or sick at home? Here
is a light, dear."</p>

<p>Flickering shadows danced across the walls of Peace's room, she
heard the tearing of paper, and then Mr. Strong's quick exclamation,
"Elizabeth! It is Allee!" "<em>What</em> is Allee?" A white gown
shot out of the door opposite them, and terrified Peace threw
herself into the woman's arms, demanding again, "What is Allee?
Is she&mdash;dead?"</p>

<p>"No, dear," he hastily assured her, provoked to think he had
frightened the child so badly; "only ill&mdash;quarantined for scarlet
fever."</p>

<p>"Scarlet fever!" gasped the girl. "That's what killed Myrtle
Perry. Oh, will Allee die, too? Why didn't I stay at home with
her?"</p>

<p>"There, there, little girlie, you mustn't cry about it like that,"
said Mrs. Strong, stroking the brown head in her arms with comforting
touches. "Lots of people have scarlet fever and get over it. The
letter says Allee's case is not at all severe, but she will be
quarantined for some weeks and you can't go home until the house
has been fumigated. You must be our girl for a month or two longer.
Will that be hard work?"</p>

<p>"N-o, but s'posing she <em>should</em> die! I ought to be there
to have it, too."</p>

<p>"No, indeed! That would make it only harder for Grandma Campbell.
You must stay here and keep well so they won't be worrying about
you, too. Allee isn't going to die, but in a few weeks will be
as well as ever."</p>

<p>"S'posing I've caught it already and give it to Glen?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Coates thinks you would have been sick by this time if you
were going to have the disease, but he is taking no chances, and
has sent some medicine as a preventive."</p>

<p>"What about school?" The case was becoming interesting to Peace,
now that she was assured that Allee would not die.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can have another week of vacation from lessons, and
then if everything is all right, you can finish your term at Chestnut
School. That is only four blocks from here, and Miss Curtis is
a splendid principal. I knew her when I went to college, and I
am sure you will like her."</p>

<p>This was not exactly what Peace had expected or hoped for. She
would have preferred no more school at all, as long as the sisters
at home were to have an enforced vacation of several weeks, and
her face clouded again as she heard Elizabeth's plan. "But&mdash;I
can't&mdash;I don't want &mdash;I would rather&mdash;" she stammered.</p>

<p>"Remember your motto and 'scatter sunshine,' dear. It will help
the home folks to know you are cheerful and happy here, and it
will help us, too."</p>

<p>She had touched the right chord. Peace slowly dried her tears,
gave a final gulp or two, and lifted her face once more smiling
and serene, saying gravely, "You can bet on me! I won't bawl any
more. You folks better get to bed now and not stand here shivering
until you catch cold. Good-night again!" With a hearty kiss for
each, she trailed away to her tiny room and was soon fast asleep
among the pillows.</p>

<p>In spite of her determination to be brave, however, she often
found it hard to wear a smiling face during the week which followed
the messenger's coming, for much as she wanted a vacation from
her books, time hung heavily on her hands. She could not help
fretting about Allee lying ill at home, Glen took a sleepy spell
and spent many hours each day napping when she wanted to play
with him, the little house had soon been put in order, everything
was unpacked and in its place, the minister and Elizabeth were
compelled to devote much of their time to making the acquaintance
of their new parishioners and becoming familiar with this new
field of labor; so Peace was necessarily left to her own devices
more than was good for her.</p>

<p>To make a bad situation worse, a drizzly spring rain set in,
which lasted for days and kept the freedom-loving child a prisoner
indoors, when she longed to be dancing in the fresh air and exploring
a certain inviting grove which she had discovered on the hillside
behind the church.</p>

<p>"I b'lieve it's raining just to spite me," she exclaimed crossly
one afternoon as she stood drumming on the window-sill and watching
the pearly drops course down the pane in zigzag rivulets. "It
just knows how bad I want to get out to play."</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked up from a tiny dress which she was mending carefully,
and said in sprightly tones,</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'Is it raining, little flower?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be glad of rain.<br/>
Too much sun would wither thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twill shine again.<br/>
The sky is very black, 'tis true,<br/>
But just behind it shines the blue.'"

</p>
</div>
<p>"Oh, yes, you can say that all right," Peace snapped, "cause
you ain't just a-dying to get out and dig. Why, Saint Elspeth,
the air just fairly smells of angleworms and birds' nests, and
I do want to make a garden so bad!"</p>

<p>"Poor girlie," smiled the woman to herself, "what a hard time
she would have in life if she could not run and romp all she wanted."
But aloud she merely said, "It is too early to make a garden yet,
dear. The ground is so cold that the seeds would rot instead of
sprouting, and if any little shoots were brave enough to climb
through the soil into open air, they probably would get frozen
for their trouble. We are apt to have some hard frosts yet this
spring. See, the leaves on the trees have scarcely begun to swell
yet. They know it isn't time. Be patient a little longer; it can't
rain forever."</p>

<p>"It's hard to be patient with nothing to do," sighed the child,
pressing her nose flatter and flatter against the glass as she
looked up and down the dreary, deserted street, vainly hoping
for something to distract her dismal thoughts.</p>

<p>"Have you finished dressing the paper dolls for Allee?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I made ten different suits for every single doll, and there
were fifteen, counting in the father and mother and grandma. Saint
John has already mailed them. I've read till I'm tired and the
back fell off of the book&mdash;it wasn't a nice story anyway, 'cause
the good girl was always getting whaled for what the bad one did.
I whistled Glen to sleep before I knew it and then couldn't wake
him up, though I shook and shook him. I've sewed up all today's
squares of patch-work and two of tomorrow's; but it isn't int'resting
work when you ain't there to tell me stories about them. And anyway,
I <em>hate</em> sewing&mdash;patch-work 'specially! When I grow up
and get married, my husband will have to buy our quilts already
made. I'll never waste my time sewing on little snips to hatch
up some bed-clothes. They're always covered up with spreads anyway.
Rainy days are the dismalest things I know!"</p>

<p>"That is very true if we let it rain inside, too," Elizabeth
agreed quietly.</p>

<p>"Let it rain inside! Whoever heard tell of such a thing&mdash;'nless
the roof was leaky." Peace giggled in spite of her gloom.</p>

<p>"You are letting it rain inside now when you frown and sigh instead
of trying to be cheerful and happy in spite of the storm outside.
One of our poets says:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'Whatever the weather may be,' says he,<br/>
'Whatever the weather may be,<br/>
It's the songs ye sing, and the smiles ye wear<br/>
That's a-making the sunshine everywhere!'"

</p>
</div>
<p>Peace abruptly ceased her drumming on the window-sill and stared
thoughtfully through the wet pane at a row of draggled sparrows
chirping blithely on a fence across the muddy street. Then she
remarked, "What a lot of poetry you know! Seems 'sif I'd struck
a poetic bunch since we left Parker. Grandma and grandpa and Miss
Edith and Frances, and now you have taken to talking in rhymes&mdash;and
they are mostly about sunshine, too."</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'When the days are gloomy<br/>
Sing some happy song,'"

</p>
</div>
<p>hummed Elizabeth, leaning suddenly forward and drawing out a
drawer in her desk close by. She rummaged through its contents
for a moment, and then laid a dainty brown and gold book in the
girl's hands, saying, "That reminds me. When I was a little girl
not much older than you are now, my mother was very ill for a
long time, and my sister Esther and I were sent away from home
to live with a lame old aunt in a lonely little house about a
mile from the nearest neighbor's. Needless to say, we got very
homesick with no one to play with or amuse us, and the days were
often so long that we were glad when night came so we could sleep
and forget our childish troubles. Though Aunt Nancy was not accustomed
to children, she soon discovered our loneliness and set about
to mend matters as best she could. But the old house had very
little in it for us to play with, the books were all too old for
us to understand, and like you, we were not overly fond of sewing.
So poor old auntie was at her wit's end to know what to do with
us when she happened to think of her diary."</p>

<p>"Did she have many cows?"</p>

<p>"Cows?"</p>

<p>"In her diary."</p>

<p>"Oh, child, that is dairy you mean. A diary is a record of each
day's events&mdash;all the little things that happen from week to week&mdash;sort
of a written history of one's life."</p>

<p>"H'm, I shouldn't think that would be fun," Peace commented candidly,
still holding the unopened volume in her hand, thinking it was
another uninteresting story-book. "I don't like writing any better
than I do sewing."</p>

<p>"Neither did I, but Esther was rather fond of scribbling, and
Aunt Nancy's diary was one of the brightest, sprightliest histories
of common, everyday affairs that we ever read, and we were both
greatly amused over it. She had kept a faithful record for years&mdash;not
every day, or even every week, but just when she happened to feel
like writing, so it was no drudgery.</p>

<p>"She was quite given to making rhymes, as you call it, and we
were astonished to find several very beautiful little poems and
stories that she had written just for her own enjoyment; for she
had always lived alone a great deal, and these little blank books
of hers held the thoughts that she could not speak to other folks
because there were no folks to talk with. Esther was several years
older than I, and she knew a lady who wrote for magazines. So,
unbeknown to Aunt Nancy, she copied a number of the prettiest
verses and sent them to this author, who not only had them printed,
but begged for more. I never shall forget how pleased Aunt Nancy
was, and I think it was that which decided us girls to try keeping
a diary, too. We raced each other good-naturedly, to see who could
write the queerest fancies or longest rhymes, and many an hour
have we whiled away, scribbling in the dusty attic."</p>

<p>"Did you ever get anything printed?" Peace was becoming interested,
for Gail had secret ambitions along this line, and such matters
as poems, stories and publishers were often discussed in the home
circle.</p>

<p>"No," sighed Elizabeth, a trifle wistfully, perhaps, as she thought
of that dear dream of her girlhood days. "I soon came to the conclusion
that poets are born and not made. But Esther has been quite successful
in writing short stories for magazines, and she lays it all to
the summer we spent with Aunt Nancy on that dreary farm."</p>

<p>"How long did you write your dairy?"</p>

<p>"<em>Diary</em>, Peace. I am still writing it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ain't that book full yet?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, a dozen or more, but most of them were burned up in
the fire at&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought maybe this was one of them." She held up the brown
and gold volume, much disappointed to think it did not contain
the record of those early attempts which Elizabeth had so charmingly
described.</p>

<p>"No, dear, that is a notebook which I was intending to send John's
youngest brother, Jasper, who thinks he wants to be an author,
so he might jot down bits of information or interesting anecdotes
to help him in his work. However, it just occurred to me that
perhaps Peace Greenfield would like such a book to gather up sunbeams
in."</p>

<p>"To gather up sunbeams?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. Don't you think it would be a nice plan these rainy,
dreary days to write down all the cheerful bits of poetry you
know or happy thoughts that come to you, or the pretty little
fairy tales you and Allee love to make up about the moon lady
and the brownies in the dell? You see, I have painted little brownies
all along the margins of the various pages&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And they are carrying sunflowers," Peace interrupted.</p>

<p>"Sun-flowers if you wish," and Elizabeth made a wry face at her
reflection in the mirror. "I called them black-eyed Susans, but
sun-flower is a better name for them, because this is to be a
sunshine book. Another coincidence &mdash;I have written on the
fly-leaf the very verse I just quoted:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"It's the songs ye sing, and the smiles ye wear<br/>
That's a-makin' the sunshine everywhere!'"

</p>
</div>
<p>"And ain't the fly's leaf dec'rations cute!" Peace pointed a
stubby forefinger at the painted brownie chorus, armed with open
song-books and broad grins, who seemed waiting only for the signal
of the leader facing them with baton raised and arms extended,
to burst into rollicking melody. "I think it's a splendid book
and you're a <em>nangel</em> to give it to me when you meant it
for someone else. But it ought to have a name. Just <em>dairy</em>
sounds so milky and barnlike; and I don't like 'sunbeam book'
real well, either. What did you call yours?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth laughed. "Esther's was 'Happy Moments,' but I was more
ambitious, and called mine 'Golden Thoughts.' How would 'Sunbeams,'
or 'Gleams of Sunshine' do for yours?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I like that last one! That's what I'll call it, and I'll
begin writing now. Shall I use pen and ink?"</p>

<p>"Ink would be best, wouldn't it? Pencil marks soon get rubbed
and dingy."</p>

<p>"That's what I was thinking," Peace answered promptly, for the
possibilities of the ink-pot always had held a great charm for
her, and at home her privileges in this direction were considerably
curtailed, ever since she had dyed Tabby's white kittens black
to match their mother. So she drew up her chair before the orderly
desk, and began her first literary efforts, having first sorted
out five blotters, six pen-holders, two erasers, a knife and a
whole box of pen-points to assist her.</p>

<p>It was a little hard at first to know just what to write, but
after a few nibbles at the end of her pen, she seemed to collect
her thoughts, and commenced scratching away so busily on the clean,
white page that Elizabeth smiled and congratulated herself on
having so easily solved the problem of what to do with the restless,
little chatter-box until she could go back to school the following
Monday. There were only three days of that week remaining, and
if the book would just hold the child's attention until these
were ended, she should count her scheme successful, even though
she did have to find another present for Jasper's birthday.</p>

<p>So she smiled with satisfaction, for Peace had become so engrossed
with her new amusement that she never heard the door-bell ring,
nor the voice of the visitor in the adjoining room, but scribbled
away energetically until words failed her, and she paused to think
of something to rhyme with "bird." Then her revery came to a sudden
end, for through the open door of the parlor floated the words,
"And so we decided to adopt her resolutions."</p>

<p>"Poor thing," murmured Peace under her breath. "I s'pose it's
another orphan. Beats all how many there are in this world! I
am glad she's going to be adopted, though; but if she was mine,
I'd change her name to something besides Resolutions. That's a
whole lot worse'n Peace. It sounds like war."</p>

<p>She glanced out of the window, and with a subdued shout dropped
her pen and rushed for her coat and rubbers. The rain had ceased
and the sun was shining! Not only that, but trudging down the
muddy hill, hand-in-hand and tearful, were two small, fat cherubs,
the first children Peace had seen while she had been visiting
the parsonage, except as she met the boys and girls of the Sunday
School. Elizabeth had told her that this part of the city was
still new, and consequently few families had settled there as
yet; but she had longed for other companionship than Glen could
give her, and this was too good an opportunity to miss. So, flinging
on her wraps, she hurried out of the back door, so as not to disturb
Elizabeth and her caller, and ran after the children already at
the street crossing, preparing to wade into the rushing torrent
of muddy water coursing down the hillside.</p>

<p>"Oh, wait!" she cried breathlessly, but at the sound of her voice
both children started guiltily, and with a snarl of anger and
defiance, plunged boldly into the flood, not even glancing behind
them at the flying, gray-coated figure in pursuit. However, the
water was swift in the gutter, the mud very slippery, and the
little tots in too great a hurry. So without any warning, two
pair of feet shot out from under their owners, two frightened
babies plumped flat in the dirty stream, and two voices rose in
protest against such an unhappy fate. Nevertheless, when Peace
waded in to their rescue, they fought and bit like wild-cats,
till she dragged them howling back to the sidewalk and safety.
Then abruptly the wails ceased, two pair of round gray eyes stared
blankly up at their rescuer, and two voices demanded aggressively,
"Who's you?"</p>

<p>"Are you twins?" asked Peace in turn, noticing for the first
time how very much alike were the small, snub-nosed, freckled
faces of the dirty duet.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What are your names?"</p>

<p>"Lewie and Loie."</p>

<p>"Lewie and Loie what?"</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you must have another name."</p>

<p>"That's all," they stubbornly insisted.</p>

<p>"Where do you live?"</p>

<p>"Nowhere."</p>

<p>"Haven't you any mamma?"</p>

<p>"She's gone."</p>

<p>"But who takes care of you?"</p>

<p>"Nobody," gulped the one called Loie.</p>

<p>"Mittie did, but she runned away and lef' us," added Lewie.</p>

<p>"Where are you going now?"</p>

<p>"To fin' mamma."</p>

<p>"But you said she was dead."</p>

<p>"She just goned away and lef' us, too," murmured Loie, looking
very much puzzled.</p>

<p>Peace was delighted. Years and years ago, when her grandfather
was a boy, he had adopted a little, homeless orphan and kept him
from being taken to the poor-farm. Here were two waifs needing
love and care. Who had a better right to adopt them than she who
had found them? Grandpa Campbell surely would not turn them away,
for did he not know what it was to be homeless and friendless?
But she could not take them home while Allee was in bed with scarlet
fever, and perhaps the Strongs would not feel that they could
open the parsonage doors to two more children, seeing that the
house was so very tiny. What could she do with her charges?</p>

<p>There was a rush of feet on the walk behind her, someone gave
her a violent push, and she sprawled full length in the gutter.
Surprised, drenched to the skin and dazed by her fall, she staggered
to her feet only to be knocked down the second time, while a jeering,
mocking voice from the sidewalk taunted, "You're a pretty sight
now, you nigger-wool kidnapper! Get up and take another dose!
I'll teach you to steal children!"</p>

<p>Blind with rage and half choked with mud, Peace shook the water
from her eyes and flew at her assailant with vengeance in her
heart, pounding right and left with relentless fists wherever
she could hit. But the enemy was a larger and stronger child,
and it would have gone hard with the brown-eyed maid had not the
minister himself arrived unexpectedly upon the scene and separated
the two young pugilists, demanding in shocked tones, "Why, Peace,
what does this mean? I thought you were above fighting."</p>

<p>"She hit me first!" sputtered Peace, trying to wipe the blood
from a long scratch on her cheek.</p>

<p>"She stole my kids!"</p>

<p>"They are orphans, Saint John, and I was going to adopt them
like my grandfather did Grandpa Campbell."</p>

<p>"They ain't either orphans!" shouted the other.</p>

<p>"They said their mother was dead and they had no home."</p>

<p>"Mamma goned away and locked up the house," volunteered Lewie
from the parsonage porch where he had taken refuge with his twin
sister at the first sign of the fray.</p>

<p>"Are you their sister?" sternly demanded Mr. Strong of the older
girl.</p>

<p>"No, I ain't! They live next door and Mrs. Hoyt left the kids
with me till she got back."</p>

<p>"Where is your house?"</p>

<p>"On top of the hill," she muttered sullenly.</p>

<p>"Then how does it come they are so far from home?"</p>

<p>"They ran away."</p>

<p>"She shut us out of hern house," said Loie, "and we went to fin'
mamma."</p>

<p>Just at this moment the parsonage door opened, and Elizabeth's
visitor stepped out on the piazza, almost stumbling over the crouching
twins; and at sight of them she exclaimed in surprise, "Why, Lewis
and Lois Hoyt, what are you doing down here? Does your mother
know where you are?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Mrs. Lane, how do you do?" said the minister, extending
his hand in greeting. "Are these tots neighbors of yours?"</p>

<p>"They live just across the street from us. I often take care
of them when the mother is away." Then her eye chanced to fall
upon the shrinking figure of Mittie, and she demanded wrathfully,
"Have you been up to your tricks again, Mittie Cole? I shall certainly
report you to your father this time sure. I will take the twins
home, Mr. Strong. It is too bad your little guest has been hurt,
but you can mark my words, she was not to blame. There is trouble
wherever Mittie goes. I don't see why Mrs. Hoyt ever left the
children with her in the first place. She might have known what
would happen."</p>

<p>Shooing the little brood ahead of her, she marched out of sight
up the hill, and Peace followed the minister into the house, wailing
disconsolately, "I thought they were orphans and I could adopt
them like grandpa did."</p>

<p>"But think how nice it is that they have a mother and father
and a nice home of their own. Aren't you glad they are not friendless
waifs?"</p>

<p>It was a new thought. Peace paused in her lament, and then with
a bright smile answered, "It is nicer that way, ain't it? 'Cause
even if they had been orphans, maybe grandpa would think he had
his hands full with the six of us, and couldn't make room for
any more. Lewie can bite like a badger and I 'magine grandpa wouldn't
stand for much of that. Anyway <em>I</em> wouldn't. When I grow
bigger and have a house of my own, then I can adopt all the children
I want to, can't I? Just like that lady that was here a minute
ago."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lane? Why, she has no adopted children!" exclaimed Elizabeth,
who had been a silent spectator of part of the scene.</p>

<p>"But I heard her tell you so myself," insisted Peace.</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"This afternoon while I was writing in my book. She said they
decided to adopt Resol &mdash;Resol&mdash;something."</p>

<p>Fortunately the minister was lighting the fire in the kitchen
stove, so Peace could not see the laughter in his face, and Elizabeth
had long since learned to hide her mirth from the keen childish
eyes, so she explained, "It was not a child, Peace, which she
was talking about. Doesn't your Missionary Band ever adopt resolutions
of any sort in their business meetings?"</p>

<p>"I never saw any they adopted, though we're s'porting two orphan
heathen in India."</p>

<p>Elizabeth could not refrain from smiling slightly, but she carefully
explained to Peace the meaning of the perplexing phrase, as she
bustled about her preparations for supper, and the incident was
apparently forgotten.</p>

<p>While she was putting things to rights for the night, long after
the children had been tucked away in their beds, she found the
preacher seated by her desk chuckling over a little book among
the papers before him, and peeping over his shoulder she saw it
was the brown and gold volume which she had given Peace that afternoon.
On the fly-leaf, just above the quaint brownie chorus, in straggling
inky letters, Peace had penned the title, "Glimmers of Gladness,"
this being as near as she could recall the name Elizabeth had
suggested. Then followed the most extraordinarily original diary
the woman had ever seen, and she laughed till the tears ran down
her cheeks, as she read the words written with such painstaking
care and plenty of ink:</p>

<p>"This is the first dairy I ever kept. Saint Elspeth gave me the
book which she ment for Jasper Strong, St. John's brother who
wood rather be a writer than a huming boy. He ought to change
places with me, cause I'd rather be a live girl any day than a
norther which is what Gale wants to be and that is one reason
I am going to keep a dairy as she may find it usful when she gets
to be famus like St. Elspeth's sister Ester. I should not want
to keep a dairy if I had to tend to it every day, but St. Elspeth
says just to rite when I feel like it which I don't s'pose will
be offen as there is usuly something to do which I like better.
I am riting today becaus it rains and I cant go out doors.</p>

"The sparrow is playing in the mud<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't I wish I could, too.<br/>
He don't need rubbers on his feet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the clouds it's blue.<br/>
He wears feathers stead of close<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And to him the rain aint wet.<br/>
I wisht that I wore feathers, too,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I'd stay out doors you bet.

<p>"The raindrop fairy is my newest fairy. I'll tell Allee all about
it when she gets well enough so's I can go home. They are very
wet but it aint their fault. If they wuz dry they wouldnt be water.
They go about doing lots of good to the trees and flowers which
couldnt grow without water, and we mustn't fuss cause there is
always sun somewhere and its a cumfert to no it wont rain all
the time. When the storm is over the raindrop faries strech a
net of red and blue and green and yellow &amp;C akros the sky
which means it wont rain any more until the next time. Thats the
way with huming beings. If we skowl and growl we're making a huming
thunder-storm, but just as soon as the smile comes out thats the
rainbow and shows the sun is shining, 'cause there is never a
rainbow without the sun is in the clouds behind it. I'm going
to smile and smile after this and be a reglar sunflour all myself."</p>

<p>"Dear little Peace," murmured Elizabeth, as she closed the book
and laid it back on the desk. "It's mean to laugh at her precious
diary, particularly when she has taken such pains with it and
tried her best to please."</p>

<p>"She'll make an author yet," chuckled the minister. "I am proud
of our little philosopher. She is scattering more sunshine than
she dreams of, and some day will harvest a big crop of sunflowers."</p>
