<p>“BUT I am reminded,” shouted the scarlet-faced man on the chair, still
keeping his voice to the high note on which he had started, “I am
reminded that my time is exhausted.  Another talented speaker is ’ere to
address you.  I refer to our friend Barnes—better known per’aps to all of
you as Erb.”
</p>
<p>The crescent-shaped crowd, growling applause, gave signs of movement, and
a round-faced young man, standing at the side of the chair, looked up
modestly at the sky.
</p><p>“He, as you all know, ’ails from the district of Berminsey, where he
exercises a certain amount of influence, and, in spite of his youth, is
recognised as a positive power in the labour world.  He is accustomed to
hit straight from the shoulder, and he fears neether friend nor foe.  I
am going to tell you some’ing you very like don’t know, and there’s no
necessity for it to go any further; that is that he stands a vurry good
chance of being made the secretary of a new society.  Friends! without
further remarks from me, I call upon Comrade Barnes, better known as Erb,
to address you.  Thanks.”
</p><p>The man stepped down from the chair.  “Where’s my hat been and gone?” he
asked.  “Someone’s shifted it.”
</p><p>The hour being half past twelve, the crowd had no business of an urgent
nature for thirty minutes.  A few strolled away to join other groups, and
Herbert Barnes, as he took off his bowler hat and stepped upon the green
chair, watched these sternly.  Southwark Park was being wooed by the
morning sun of spring-time, the green fresh grass covered a space that
was here and there protected by warning boards; the trees, after a
shivering winter, were clothing themselves with a suit of new leaves.
Away to the right, masts of shipping in the Surrey Commercial Docks
showed high and gaunt above the middle-aged trees that fringed the park:
on the other side rows of small houses pressed closely.  A few
light-haired Scandinavian sailors looked on amiably; timber-carrying men,
who showed a horny skin at the back of their necks, as badges of their
labour, made up, with railway men in unaccustomed mufti, the rest of the
group.  The new speaker’s features relaxed slightly as he saw two girls,
conspicuous in the presence of so many men, join his audience, to resume
his earlier manner when one exclaimed disappointedly, “Oh, it’s only
joring!” and both strolled away towards a bed of flaming tulips.  A tall
young woman, slightly lame, took their place.
</p><p>“Friends,” said Erb, very quietly, “I was not altogether prepared to be
called upon for an address this morning, but—All right, my lad,” this in
reply to an appeal from the outside of the crescent, “I’ll speak up
presently.  I’ll speak up when I’m ready, in a way that’ll make even you
understand me.” The line of speakers near the chair smiled, and the
interjector’s friends remarked gleefully that this was one in the eye for
him.  “I say that I came ’ere to this park this morning,” he went on,
raising his voice defiantly, and smoothing his obstinate hair with one
hand, “more as a listener than a teacher, more ready to learn from others
than to learn them anything myself.”  The tall young person on the edge
of the crowd winced.  “But as I have been called upon, I shall take the
liberty of askin’ you one or two very straight questions.  My friend from
Camberwell, who preceded, referred to me as one accustomed to hit
straight from the shoulder; that’s the way I’m going to play the game
this morning.  I stand up ’ere,” he said, commencing to finger the
buttons of his waistcoat, “as a working man addressing his fellow working
men.  Prouder titles there can never be, and if they was to offer to make
me Lord Mayor of London at this present moment I should make answer to
the effect that I preferred to be a working man.”  A voice on the outside
asked where he worked?  “I am a parcels carman on a railway I am, and I
earn twenty-three shillings and sixpence a week.”  A voice said it was a
shame to pay a van-boy the money earned by grown men; Herbert Barnes
flushed at this and went on.  The voice, deluded, threw at him another
remark.  “Was he” (asked the voice), “was he a half-timer?”
</p><p>“I’m going to spare one minute with this chap,” said Erb, turning
suddenly.  “Bring him forward!  Stand back from him then, if he’s too shy
for that, and let’s see who we’re dealing with.  Oh, it’s you, is it?”
</p><p>“Yus,” admitted the owner of the voice resentfully, “it is me.”
</p><p>“You don’t look ’appy,” said Erb.
</p><p>“I’ve been listening to you,” explained the man.
</p><p>“Take your ’ands out of your pockets and let’s ’ave a look at them.”  The
man turned to go, but the circle declined to permit this.  “Take a sight
at his little hansy-pansy.”  Order complied with.  “What d’you make of
’em?”  “Soft,” retorted the expert.  “I knew he was a loafer,” said Erb.
“Let him go now and prop up his favourite pubs; I want to talk to genuine
working men, not to bits of touch-wood.  My first question is,” here he
referred to the notes on the back of an envelope which he held in his
hand, “my first question is, what is it we working men most keenly desire
at the present moment?”
</p><p>“Tankard of bitter,” said someone.
</p><p>“Ah!”  Herbert Barnes whirled round, and pointed a forefinger at the
humorist and his friends.  “<u>There’s</u> a man who speaks the truth.
<u>There’s</u> a man what says jest the thing he really thinks.  <u>There’s</u> a
man who utters that which is uppermost in his mind.  <u>There’s</u> a man,” he
leaned forward as though about to give one last applauding compliment,
“whose ’ighest ambition, whose most elevated thought, whose one supreme
anxiety is for a tankard of bitter.  Friends,” with a whirl of both arms,
“we talk about the tyranny and what not of capital; the enmity of the
upper circles, but <u>there</u>, jest over <u>there</u>, is the class of man that
is our greatest opponent, the man from whom we have most to fear.  A
ten-kard of bit-ter!” he repeated deliberately.
</p><p>“Well, but,” said the humorist in an injured tone, “I suppose a chep can
open his mouth?”
</p><p>“You can open your mouth, and when you do, apparently, it’s generally for
the purpose of em’tying down it a—”
</p><p>He hesitated.  The crowd, glad to find personalities introduced, gave the
words in a muffled chorus.
</p><p>“Makin’ a bloomin’ song of it,” grumbled the humorist, going off.  “Some
people can’t take a joke.”
</p><p>“’Aving finished with our friend,” said Herbert Barnes, loudly, “we will
now resume our attention to our original argument.  What is it that the
working man—”
</p><p>His voice grew so much in volume that people at Christadelphian and other
crowds near the iron gates deserted these, and came across in the hope of
better sport.  One of his arguments created some dissension, and two men,
detaching themselves from the crescent, went off to debate it, and an
interested circle formed around these, listening with almost pained
interest, and seemingly (from the nodding of their heads) convinced by
each argument in turn.  The round-faced young man on the Windsor chair,
now aiming the fist of one hand into the palm of the other as he laboured
at an argument, and giving a tremendous and convincing thump as he made
his point, noted the new crowd with approval: it was good to have said
the stimulating thing.  There were no interrupters now, but occasionally
a voice would throw an approving sentence, caught neatly by Herbert
Barnes, and used if he thought it wise or necessary; his best retorts
were given with a glance at the one young woman of the crowd.  He was in
the middle of a long sentence decked out with many a paraphrase, and
whole regiments of adjectives hurrying to the support of a noun, when the
hem of his jacket was pulled, and he stopped.  “Surely,” he said, in an
undertone, “the time ain’t up?”  The man next him replied, “Oh, ain’t it
though?” rather caustically.
</p><p>“Friends,” said Herbert resuming his quiet voice, “I’m afraid I’ve kept
you rather long.  We’ve had opportunities before of meetin’ each other;
we shall ’ave opportunities again.  I ’ave only to add one word.”  The
man next to him frowned up at him on hearing this ominous phrase.  “It’s
my firm and steadfast opinion that we shall increase our power and
magnify our strength only by sticking close, quite close, shoulder to
shoulder, in what I may call the march of progress.  Not otherwise shall
we see the risin’ sun salute the dawn—” (a momentary frown from the lame
young woman had disconcerted him)—“of labour’s triumph: not otherwise
shall we—shall we—”
</p><p>“Gain,” prompted the young man next to him, sulkily.
</p><p>“Gain—thank you—gain the respect of future ages and the admiration of
posterity; not otherwise shall we lead others on in that battle which, to
use the language of metaphor—”
</p><p>“I say, old man,” whispered his neighbour, “really!  Play the game.”
</p><p>“I will not pursue the train of thought,” said Erb, “on which I had, in a
manner of speakin’, embarked.  One an’ all, friends—thank you—kind
’tention—I now give way!”
</p><p>“Feriends!” shouted the next man, stepping quickly on the chair, “our
comrade from Berminsey has been so far carried away by his own eloquence
as to overstep his time.  In these circs, I will abstain from all
preliminary remarks and come to the point at once.  First of all,
’owever—”
</p><p>The bowler-hatted men, who had spoken, seemed bored now with the
proceedings, and tried to make out the exact time by the clock on the
great biscuit factory; unable to do this, they appealed to Erb, who,
heated with his oratorical efforts, and gratified to notice that the tall
young woman had limped away directly that he had finished, produced a
smart silver watch and gave the required information.  They spoke in an
undertone of the evening’s engagements: one proud man was to turn on the
gas, as he cheerfully expressed it, at Victoria Park in the afternoon,
another had had a long talk with a member of Parliament, and the member
had shaken hands with him, “Quite ’omely and affable”; they all presented
to the crowd a very serious and thoughtful and statesmanlike appearance
as they whispered to each other.  Flakes of the crowd began to fall away.
The last speaker finished, hoarse and panting.
</p><p>“Whose turn is it to carry the chair?”
</p><p>“Erb’s!” said the others, quickly.
</p><p>“But I thought—” he began.
</p><p>“You thought wrong,” said the others.  “Besides you’re going straight
’ome.”
</p><p>They walked across the grass to the gates near the station, where men and
children, and men with babies perched on their shoulders, were making way
back to the homes from which they had been temporarily expelled in order
to give wives and mothers opportunity for concentrating minds on the
preparation for dinner.
</p><p>“No use trying to blister you for ’alf a pint, Erb?”
</p><p>“Waste of time,” said Erb.
</p><p>“What d’you do with all your money?”
</p><p>“I don’t find no difficulty,” he replied, “in getting rid of it.  Any
spare cash goes in books.  I’ve got a reg’lar little library at ’ome.
John Stuart Mill and Professor Wallace and Robert Owen, and goodness
knows what all.”
</p><p>“The only reely sensible thing you’ve done, Erb,” remarked one, “is not
getting married.”
</p><p>“That’s one of ’em,” he admitted.
</p><p>“You don’t know what it is to be always buying boots for the kiddies.”
</p><p>“Don’t want.”
</p><p>“You single men get it all your own way.  Same time, it’s a selfish life
in my opinion.  You don’t live for the sake of anybody.”
</p><p>“I live for the sake of a good many people,” said Erb, dodging into the
road to evade a square of girls carrying hymn books, and returning with
his chair to the pavement.  “What I’m anxious to do is to see the world
better and brighter, to organise either by word of mouth or otherwise—”
</p><p>“Old man!” protested the others indignantly, “give us a rest.  You ain’t
in the park now.”
</p><p>He gave up the wooden chair to one of the men, who took it inside the
passage of a house in Upper Grange Road.  The others stepped across to a
public-house; he nodded and went on.
</p><p>“Won’t change your mind and ’ave one, Erb?”
</p><p>“My mind,” he called back, “is the one thing I never ’ardly change.”
</p><p>He did not relax his seriousness of demeanour until he had passed the
high-walled enclosure of Bricklayers’ Arms Goods Station and had turned
into Page’s Walk.  There the fact was borne on the air that dinner-time
was near, for attractive scents of cooking issued out of every doorway;
he moved his lips appreciatively and hurried on with a more cheerful air.
Women slipped along with their aprons hiding plates of well-baked joints
and potatoes: children waited anxiously in doorways for the signal to
approach the one gay, over-satisfying meal of the week, at which there
was always an unusual exhibition of geniality and good temper that would
eventually conciliate the worried mother, who had devoted the morning to
providing the meal.  Men returned from a morning at their clubs, where
the hours had been chased by a third-rate music-hall entertainment; these
walked slowly and hummed or whistled some enticing air with which they
desired better acquaintance.  Erb scraped his boots carefully on the edge
of the pavement, and went up the stone steps of some model dwellings.
From No. 17 came a broad hint of rabbit pie: a veiled suggestion of
pickled pork.
</p><p>“Well, young six foot,” he said cheerfully, “is the banquet prepared, and
are all our honoured guests assembled?”
</p><p>“Wouldn’t be you,” remarked his short sister, quickly, “if you didn’t
come ’ome long before you were wanted.”  She stood on tiptoe and glanced
at herself in the glass over the mantelpiece, and rolled up her sleeves
again; her head was covered with steel hair-curlers, which had held it
fiercely since the previous morning.  “And me in me disables.”
</p><p>“You look all right,” said Erb.
</p><p>“I shall ’ave to be this afternoon.”
</p><p>“What’s going to ’appen this afternoon?
</p><p>“I told you!” remonstrated his sister.  “My new young man’s going to drop
in for a cup of tea.”
</p><p>“Which?”
</p><p>“I never have more than one at a time.”
</p><p>“You mean the one in the hat place in Southwark Street.”
</p><p>“Bah!” said his young sister contemptuously.  “I gave him the sack weeks
ago.”
</p><p>“You’re always a choppin’ and a changin’,” said Erb tolerantly.
</p><p>“If you weren’t such a great gawk,” remarked his sister, bending to peep
into the oven, “you’d put the knives and forks, and not sit there like
a—like a—I don’t know what.”
</p><p>Erb pulled a drawer underneath the table and complied.
</p><p>“The other way about, stupid,” said the short girl wrathfully.  “You
don’t take your knife in your left hand, do you?  ’Pon me word, I often
wonder that men was ever invented.  I s’pose you’ve been talkin’ yourself
’ungry, as usual?”
</p><p>“I addressed a large meeting,” said Erb, with a touch of his important
manner, “for upwards of eleven minutes.”
</p><p>“Did they aim straight?”
</p><p>“They were very appreciative,” said Erb.  “One chap that interrupted I
went for with ’orse, foot, and artillery.”
</p><p>“Did you, though?” asked his short sister with reluctant admiration.
“Make him squirm, eh, Erb?  Did ye call him names, or did you say
something about his nose?”
</p><p>“I treated him with satire!”
</p><p>“Weren’t there ladies present, then?”
</p><p>“There was one, as it happened.”
</p><p>“<u>She’d</u> been better off at ’ome,” remarked the girl severely.  “The
minx.”
</p><p>“She looked all right.”
</p><p>“You can’t go by looks nowadays.”
</p><p>“A tremendous weapon satire in the ’ands of a clever man,” said Erb
exultantly, “takes the starch out of ’em like drenching with a fire ’ose.
Am I supposed to stay on ’ere whilst this new chap of yours mops up his
tea?”
</p><p>“Unless me lady comes down from Eaton Square to lord it over us all.”
</p><p>“Nice occupation for a man of my—a man of my—”
</p><p>“Don’t say ‘intellect,’” begged his sister.  “Spoils me appetite if I
laugh much before dinner.”
</p><p>A pleasure to watch the sister, her sleeves rolled up to the elbow,
setting right the things on the table, placing, with the aid of an exact
pair of eyes, the china cruet-stand at the very centre, fabricating some
mustard in a teacup, and pouring it cleanly and carefully into the
mustard-pot, glancing at the oven with an encouraging, “’Urry up there!”
to the pie, and ever a wary look-out on the lid of the saucepan on the
fire; the intervals she filled by complaining of the price of coals, by
dusting the mantelpiece, by asking questions about the morning’s
speeches, and by explaining with great interest the trouble that came to
a girl in her workshop consequent on accepting engagement rings from two
young men at the same time.  Presently the one right moment arrived, and
out came the rabbit pie, with a crust not to be equalled for lightness
and flakiness in Page’s Walk, where, indeed, experiments in the higher
walks of cookery usually proved so disastrous as to lead to domestic
contention and a review of all the varied grievances that had accumulated
throughout the ages.  Erb, at the head of the table, cut the pie, and his
young sister sat at the side, with one foot on the insecure support, so
that the table scarcely wobbled under this trying operation; there ensued
some argument because Erb wanted to place both of the kidneys on her
plate, and his sister would not hear of this, but a compromise was
effected by sharing these dainties fairly and equally.  His sister said
grace.
</p><p>“For what we are ’bout ’ceive, Lord make us truly thankful for.”
</p><p>“Well?” she asked, rather nervously, as Erb took his first mouthful.  Erb
tasted with the air of a connoisseur.
</p><p>“I’ve tasted worse,” he said.
</p><p>“I was afraid how it was going to turn out,” confessed his sister with
relief.  “It’s long since I tried my ’and at a pie.”
</p><p>“There’s nothing anyone can’t do in this so-called life of ours,” said
Erb oracularly, “providin’ that we put our best into it.  We’ve all been
endowed—”
</p><p>“Pickle pork all right?”
</p><p>“The pickle pork isn’t nearly so bad as it might be,” said Erb.  “They
couldn’t beat it in Eaton Square.  As I was saying, the human brain—”
</p><p>“If Alice comes down from Eaton Square this afternoon in anything new,”
said his young sister definitely, “I shall simply ignore it.  In fact, I
shall say, ‘Oh, you havn’t got anything new for the spring then yet?’
That,” said the girl gleefully, “that’ll make her aspirate her aitches.”
</p><p>“We mustn’t forget that she’s our sister.”
</p><p>“She’d like to get it out of her memory.  Being parlourmaid in Eaton
Square, and about five foot ten from top to toe, don’t entitle anybody to
come down ’ere to Page’s Walk and act about as though Bricklayers’ Arms
Station belonged to them.  After all, she’s only a servant, Erb; there’s
no getting away from that.  She doesn’t get her evenings to herself like
I do.  Compared with her, I’m almost independent, mind you.  I may ’ave
to work ’ard in the day, I don’t deny it, but after seven o’clock at
night I’m me own mistress, and I can go out and about jest as I jolly
well like.  Tip up the dish, and take some more gravy.”
</p><p>“As a matter of fact you come ’ome ’ere, and you work about and get the
place ready against me coming ’ome.”
</p><p>“And why shouldn’t I?” demanded his young sister warmly, “if I like to?
Can’t I please meself?  I’d a jolly sight rather do that than go and wait
at table on a lot of over-dressed or under-dressed people, and obliged to
keep a straight face whatever silly things you might ’ear them say.  Is
there a little bit more of the crust you can spare me?”
</p><p>“I quite admit,” said Erb, supplying her offered plate, “that to me there
is something distasteful—”
</p><p>“I only put the leastest bit of onion in.”
</p><p>“I’m referrin’ now to the arrangement by which those who possess riches
are able to call upon the working portion of the population to enable
them to live idle, slothful lives.  I may be wrong, but it seems to me—”
</p><p>“I don’t blame them,” remarked his sister quickly, with her involuntary
twitching of the head.  “I should do the same if I was in their place.
Tapioca pudding, Erb, for after.  How does that strike you?”
</p><p>“A tapioca and me,” said Erb genially, “have always been on speaking
terms.  I can always do with a tapioca.  A tapioca and me are good chums.
Don’t forget your stout.”
</p><p>“Wish I was.”
</p><p>“What I mean is, don’t forget to drink it.  My friend Payne, by the way,
may call with a message.”
</p><p>“I’d as lief take doctor’s stuff,” said his sister with a wry face.
“What’s Payne calling about?”
</p><p>“Orgenisation,” answered Erb mysteriously.
</p><p>“Oh,” she said casually, “<u>that</u> rot.”
</p><p>“You’ll have a lay down after dinner.”
</p><p>“I shall be busy,” answered his sister, “making meself good-looking.”
</p><p>“You’ll have a lay down,” Erb repeated firmly.  “Besides, you look all
right.  Your face is a bit white, but,” with a burst of compliment,
“you’d pass in a crowd.  No cheese for me.  <u>You</u> ’ave some.”
</p><p>“I’ve done, thanks.”  She bowed her head and spoke rapidly in an
undertone “F,” “What we <u>have</u> received the Lord make us—”
</p><p>The fact that the tall sister from Eaton Square called before Louisa had
changed and taken her hair out of curlers was attributed by Louisa to the
tall sister’s unvarying desire to see Page’s Walk at its worst, to find
thus excuse for showering upon it her contempt.  Alice, from a lofty
height added to by an astonishing hat from which Louisa could not, in
spite of herself, keep her eyes, complained bitterly to her sister of the
state of Old Kent Road, upbraided Erb for the impudence of a ’bus
conductor who, because she had talked a little on the way, offered to
carry her on to the Deaf and Dumb Asylum without extra charge.  “The
vulgar humour of these poor men,” said Alice, unnecessarily dusting a
chair before sitting down, “appals one.”  She mentioned that the Eaton
Square coachman had offered to drive her anywhere she wanted to go, but
that, for various reasons, into which she preferred not to enter, she had
declined.
</p><p>“I’ve brought you a bottle of Burgundy, Louisa.  You’ll find it in my
muff.”
</p><p>“To put on me ’andkerchief?” asked Louisa satirically.
</p><p>The tall sister glanced appealingly first at the stolid Erb, then at the
ceiling.
</p><p>“I am on good terms with the housekeeper,” she explained, “for the
moment, and there is no difficulty in obtaining any little thing of this
kind.  And you’re not looking well.  You want picking up.”
</p><p>“<u>Your</u> idea seems to be to give me a set down,” said Louisa.  “Going to
take your things off?”
</p><p>“I’ll just loosen my jacket.  I won’t take it off, thank you.”
</p><p>“You know the state of the lining better than I do.  Erb, you’re silent
all at once.”
</p><p>“I was thinking,” said Erb, going across the room and taking the bottle
from its resting place.  “How much does a bottle of Burgundy wine like
this run into, Alice?”
</p><p>An exclamation came from the short girl as the tall sister took a pair of
pince-nez from her breast, and, with great care, put on these new
decorations in order to assist her in giving the answer.
</p><p>“A bottle like that would ‘run into,’” she explained with a short laugh
as she quoted Erb, “about, what shall I say, six or seven shillings.”
</p><p>“You can take it back,” he said shortly.
</p><p>“Bra-vo, Erb,” whispered Louisa.
</p><p>“I’m not going to be indebted,” said Erb, leaning his fists on the deal
table, “to Eaton Square or any other haunt of the aristocracy for
philanthropy of any kind or description whatever, not even when they are
not aware that they’re giving anything away.  I should be stultifying
meself if I did.  If Louisa or me wants Burgundy we can buy it at the
grocer’s, and, if necessary, go as far as to drink it, with the satisfied
feeling that we’re not beholden to any one.  Eh, Louisa?”
</p><p>“You’ve hit it in once,” agreed the short sister.  “Cigar or coker-nut?”
</p><p>“Therefore, whilst thankin’ you, one and all, for your doubtless
well-meant kindness, perhaps, Alice, you’ll understand that my
principles—”
</p><p>“You needn’t bang the table about,” interrupted the tall sister.
</p><p>“It’s ours,” retorted Louisa.  “We can bang it if we like.”
</p><p>“My principles,” repeated Erb with relish, “prevent me from accepting
anything whatsoever concerning which I have reason to believe that it had
not been acquired, or bought, or paid for by the party at whose hands—at
whose hands–”
</p><p>“That’s right, Erb,” said Louisa encouragingly.
</p><p>“At whose hands that gift is, so to speak, attempted to be bestowed.”
</p><p>“I shall look pretty,” protested Alice, “carrying that about all the
evening.”
</p><p>“If it has that effect,” said her short sister, “I don’t see how you can
grumble.  Come in the bedroom and show me how you manage this new way of
doing up the hair.”
</p><p>Erb read a chapter from Herbert Spencer whilst the girls were out of the
room, well repaid if here and there he understood a sentence, or now and
again caught sight of a view that soon eluded him.  The book had been
recommended by a speaker at the Liberal and Radical Club a few Sundays
before, an Honourable Somebody, whose proud boast it was that he had
unsuccessfully contested more seats at general and at bye-elections than
any man belonging to his party, and who was, indeed, such an
uncompromising bore, that he might well and appropriately have been
subsidized by his very grateful opponents.  The Honourable Somebody had
also strongly recommended a book by Ruskin, and this, too, Erb had
procured from the Free Library, but had given it up after a brief
struggle, confessing that it was a bit too thick even for him.  Erb made
notes on the back of parcels’ waybills when he came on something that
seemed to him lucid: smiled to think of the start his companions would
give when they heard him say in a speech, “I am inclined to go with our
friend Spencer and say with him—” conveying in this way an impression
that his acquaintance with literature was so complete that he had but to
pick and choose from the treasures of his memory in order to give an
illuminating quotation.  He had made a bag of five when his sisters
returned to the front room; Louisa without her fierce hair curlers, her
head decked out in a new fashion, and more amiable in her attitude
towards her sister, and, indeed, holding her arm affectionately.  Alice,
with her hat off, slightly less austere, took up Erb’s book with a word
of apology and remarked, “Oh, yes!” in the manner of one recognising an
old companion.
</p><p>“Read it?”
</p><p>“Well,” said the tall sister, “I have not exactly read it, but I have
heard of it.  Two of our young ladies talk about it sometimes at meals:
Lady Frances declares she can’t understand half of it.”
</p><p>“It’s easy enough,” said Erb, “once you get the hang of the thing.”
</p><p>“What are the young ladies like, Alice, at your new place?” asked the
short sister at the looking-glass.
</p><p>“I’ve often been going to tell you, but you’d never listen,” complained
Alice.
</p><p>“Tell us now!”
</p><p>They all became much interested in this subject, and even Erb put some
elucidating questions.  Louisa looked admiringly at her tall sister as
Alice went from this to the subject of visitors to Eaton Square: young
Lady Frances, it seemed, occasionally gave mixed dinners, where no one
knew anybody else, and even Lady Frances herself did not insist on
previous acquaintance: the passport to these was notoriety.  From this
subject to the servants’ coming party of the following Thursday week was
an easy stage.  Thursday had been selected to fit the convenience of
certain visitors whose establishments on that day closed early.
</p><p>“Another foot or so,” said Louisa gazing up at her sister, “and _I_ might
’ave been in your shoes.”
</p><p>“Height isn’t the only thing required.  We shall be rather short of
gentlemen, by the bye.”
</p><p>“I can quite understand that.”
</p><p>“I suppose, Erb,” said Alice to her brother doubtfully, “you wouldn’t
care to come if I got you an invite?  If you did, you’d have to remember
that I told them you were an inspector: you mustn’t make me look like a
story-teller.”
</p><p>“Not much in my line,” growled Erb.  “Besides, I’ve got a big job coming
on that I mustn’t tell you anything further about jest now.”
</p><p>“I’d get you asked, Louisa,” she said candidly to her short sister, “if
you looked better than you do.  I don’t think your work does you any
good.”
</p><p>“I’m not in it for me health,” retorted the other, her head giving its
involuntary shake.
</p><p>“I’ve advised her to try something else,” agreed Erb, walking up and down
the room.  “She’s only a bit of a girl, and the circumstances under which
our female workers are compelled to carry on their duties amount to a
species of white slavery which would not be tolerated in Russia.”
</p><p>“Loud cheers!” commented Louisa.  “It’s about time my young man was ’ere.
If he can’t keep his appointments I shall have to talk to him straight.”
</p><p>As though in answer to this threat a loud single knock came at the door.
</p><p>“Let him wait a bit,” said Louisa.  “Do him good.”
</p><p>Another knock came and the girl went to the door to upbraid the caller
for unmannerly impatience.  She withdrew her head quickly.
</p><p>“It’s Payne,” she announced to her brother.
</p><p>“Deuce it is!” said Erb with excitement.
</p><p>In the passage stood a man with a stiff, short, red beard, his upper lip
shaven; near to him, a newer arrival, a nervous youth, with a wired
flower in his coat, who asked shyly whether Miss Barnes happened by any
chance to be at home.
</p><p>“Trot in,” said Erb, jerking his head.  The nervous youth took off his
hat and obeyed.  “Well, Payne, old man,” said Erb to the other.
</p><p>“I’ve won the three old ’uns over,” whispered the man with the red beard.
</p><p>“Good on you!”
</p><p>“They’ll sign to-morrow.”
</p><p>“And if the answer ain’t satisfactory?”
</p><p>“Then,” said Payne in an undertone, with his hand guarding the words at
his mouth, “then they’ll follow our lead.”
</p><p>“And strike?”
</p><p>“And strike!” said Payne.
