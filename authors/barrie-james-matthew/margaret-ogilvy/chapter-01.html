On the day I was born we bought six hair-bottomed chairs, and in 
our little house it was an event, the first great victory in a 
woman's long campaign; how they had been laboured for, the pound-
note and the thirty threepenny-bits they cost, what anxiety there 
was about the purchase, the show they made in possession of the 
west room, my father's unnatural coolness when he brought them in 
(but his face was white) - I so often heard the tale afterwards, 
and shared as boy and man in so many similar triumphs, that the 
coming of the chairs seems to be something I remember, as if I had 
jumped out of bed on that first day, and run ben to see how they 
looked.  I am sure my mother's feet were ettling to be ben long 
before they could be trusted, and that the moment after she was 
left alone with me she was discovered barefooted in the west room, 
doctoring a scar (which she had been the first to detect) on one of 
the chairs, or sitting on them regally, or withdrawing and re-
opening the door suddenly to take the six by surprise.  And then, I 
think, a shawl was flung over her (it is strange to me to think it 
was not I who ran after her with the shawl), and she was escorted 
sternly back to bed and reminded that she had promised not to 
budge, to which her reply was probably that she had been gone but 
an instant, and the implication that therefore she had not been 
gone at all.  Thus was one little bit of her revealed to me at 
once: I wonder if I took note of it.  Neighbours came in to see the 
boy and the chairs.  I wonder if she deceived me when she affected 
to think that there were others like us, or whether I saw through 
her from the first, she was so easily seen through.  When she 
seemed to agree with them that it would be impossible to give me a 
college education, was I so easily taken in, or did I know already 
what ambitions burned behind that dear face? when they spoke of the 
chairs as the goal quickly reached, was I such a newcomer that her 
timid lips must say 'They are but a beginning' before I heard the 
words?  And when we were left together, did I laugh at the great 
things that were in her mind, or had she to whisper them to me 
first, and then did I put my arm round her and tell her that I 
would help?  Thus it was for such a long time: it is strange to me 
to feel that it was not so from the beginning.
<P>
It is all guess-work for six years, and she whom I see in them is 
the woman who came suddenly into view when they were at an end.  
Her timid lips I have said, but they were not timid then, and when 
I knew her the timid lips had come.  The soft face - they say the 
face was not so soft then.  The shawl that was flung over her - we 
had not begun to hunt her with a shawl, nor to make our bodies a 
screen between her and the draughts, nor to creep into her room a 
score of times in the night to stand looking at her as she slept.  
We did not see her becoming little then, nor sharply turn our heads 
when she said wonderingly how small her arms had grown.  In her 
happiest moments - and never was a happier woman - her mouth did 
not of a sudden begin to twitch, and tears to lie on the mute blue 
eyes in which I have read all I know and would ever care to write.  
For when you looked into my mother's eyes you knew, as if He had 
told you, why God sent her into the world - it was to open the 
minds of all who looked to beautiful thoughts.  And that is the 
beginning and end of literature.  Those eyes that I cannot see 
until I was six years old have guided me through life, and I pray 
God they may remain my only earthly judge to the last.  They were 
never more my guide than when I helped to put her to earth, not 
whimpering because my mother had been taken away after seventy-six 
glorious years of life, but exulting in her even at the grave.
<P>
<P>
She had a son who was far away at school.  I remember very little 
about him, only that he was a merry-faced boy who ran like a 
squirrel up a tree and shook the cherries into my lap.  When he was 
thirteen and I was half his age the terrible news came, and I have 
been told the face of my mother was awful in its calmness as she 
set off to get between Death and her boy.  We trooped with her down 
the brae to the wooden station, and I think I was envying her the 
journey in the mysterious wagons; I know we played around her, 
proud of our right to be there, but I do not recall it, I only 
speak from hearsay.  Her ticket was taken, she had bidden us 
goodbye with that fighting face which I cannot see, and then my 
father came out of the telegraph-office and said huskily, 'He's 
gone!'  Then we turned very quietly and went home again up the 
little brae.  But I speak from hearsay no longer; I knew my mother 
for ever now.
<P>
That is how she got her soft face and her pathetic ways and her 
large charity, and why other mothers ran to her when they had lost 
a child.  'Dinna greet, poor Janet,' she would say to them; and 
they would answer, 'Ah, Margaret, but you're greeting yoursel.'  
Margaret Ogilvy had been her maiden name, and after the Scotch 
custom she was still Margaret Ogilvy to her old friends.  Margaret 
Ogilvy I loved to name her.  Often when I was a boy, 'Margaret 
Ogilvy, are you there?'  I would call up the stair.
<P>
She was always delicate from that hour, and for many months she was 
very ill.  I have heard that the first thing she expressed a wish 
to see was the christening robe, and she looked long at it and then 
turned her face to the wall.  That was what made me as a boy think 
of it always as the robe in which he was christened, but I knew 
later that we had all been christened in it, from the oldest of the 
family to the youngest, between whom stood twenty years.  Hundreds 
of other children were christened in it also, such robes being then 
a rare possession, and the lending of ours among my mother's 
glories.  It was carried carefully from house to house, as if it 
were itself a child; my mother made much of it, smoothed it out, 
petted it, smiled to it before putting it into the arms of those to 
whom it was being lent; she was in our pew to see it borne 
magnificently (something inside it now) down the aisle to the 
pulpit-side, when a stir of expectancy went through the church and 
we kicked each other's feet beneath the book-board but were 
reverent in the face; and however the child might behave, laughing 
brazenly or skirling to its mother's shame, and whatever the father 
as he held it up might do, look doited probably and bow at the 
wrong time, the christening robe of long experience helped them 
through.  And when it was brought back to her she took it in her 
arms as softly as if it might be asleep, and unconsciously pressed 
it to her breast: there was never anything in the house that spoke 
to her quite so eloquently as that little white robe; it was the 
one of her children that always remained a baby.  And she had not 
made it herself, which was the most wonderful thing about it to me, 
for she seemed to have made all other things.  All the clothes in 
the house were of her making, and you don't know her in the least 
if you think they were out of the fashion; she turned them and made 
them new again, she beat them and made them new again, and then she 
coaxed them into being new again just for the last time, she let 
them out and took them in and put on new braid, and added a piece 
up the back, and thus they passed from one member of the family to 
another until they reached the youngest, and even when we were done 
with them they reappeared as something else.  In the fashion!  I 
must come back to this.  Never was a woman with such an eye for it.  
She had no fashion-plates; she did not need them.  The minister's 
wife (a cloak), the banker's daughters (the new sleeve) - they had 
but to pass our window once, and the scalp, so to speak, was in my 
mother's hands.  Observe her rushing, scissors in hand, thread in 
mouth, to the drawers where her daughters' Sabbath clothes were 
kept.  Or go to church next Sunday, and watch a certain family 
filing in, the boy lifting his legs high to show off his new boots, 
but all the others demure, especially the timid, unobservant-
looking little woman in the rear of them.  If you were the 
minister's wife that day or the banker's daughters you would have 
got a shock.  But she bought the christening robe, and when I used 
to ask why, she would beam and look conscious, and say she wanted 
to be extravagant once.  And she told me, still smiling, that the 
more a woman was given to stitching and making things for herself, 
the greater was her passionate desire now and again to rush to the 
shops and 'be foolish.'  The christening robe with its pathetic 
frills is over half a century old now, and has begun to droop a 
little, like a daisy whose time is past; but it is as fondly kept 
together as ever: I saw it in use again only the other day.
<P>
My mother lay in bed with the christening robe beside her, and I 
peeped in many times at the door and then went to the stair and sat 
on it and sobbed.  I know not if it was that first day, or many 
days afterwards, that there came to me, my sister, the daughter my 
mother loved the best; yes, more I am sure even than she loved me, 
whose great glory she has been since I was six years old.  This 
sister, who was then passing out of her 'teens, came to me with a 
very anxious face and wringing her hands, and she told me to go ben 
to my mother and say to her that she still had another boy.  I went 
ben excitedly, but the room was dark, and when I heard the door 
shut and no sound come from the bed I was afraid, and I stood 
still.  I suppose I was breathing hard, or perhaps I was crying, 
for after a time I heard a listless voice that had never been 
listless before say, 'Is that you?'  I think the tone hurt me, for 
I made no answer, and then the voice said more anxiously 'Is that 
you?' again.  I thought it was the dead boy she was speaking to, 
and I said in a little lonely voice, 'No, it's no him, it's just 
me.'  Then I heard a cry, and my mother turned in bed, and though 
it was dark I knew that she was holding out her arms.
<P>
After that I sat a great deal in her bed trying to make her forget 
him, which was my crafty way of playing physician, and if I saw any 
one out of doors do something that made the others laugh I 
immediately hastened to that dark room and did it before her.  I 
suppose I was an odd little figure; I have been told that my 
anxiety to brighten her gave my face a strained look and put a 
tremor into the joke (I would stand on my head in the bed, my feet 
against the wall, and then cry excitedly, 'Are you laughing, 
mother?') - and perhaps what made her laugh was something I was 
unconscious of, but she did laugh suddenly now and then, whereupon 
I screamed exultantly to that dear sister, who was ever in waiting, 
to come and see the sight, but by the time she came the soft face 
was wet again.  Thus I was deprived of some of my glory, and I 
remember once only making her laugh before witnesses.  I kept a 
record of her laughs on a piece of paper, a stroke for each, and it 
was my custom to show this proudly to the doctor every morning.  
There were five strokes the first time I slipped it into his hand, 
and when their meaning was explained to him he laughed so 
boisterously, that I cried, 'I wish that was one of hers!'  Then he 
was sympathetic, and asked me if my mother had seen the paper yet, 
and when I shook my head he said that if I showed it to her now and 
told her that these were her five laughs he thought I might win 
another.  I had less confidence, but he was the mysterious man whom 
you ran for in the dead of night (you flung sand at his window to 
waken him, and if it was only toothache he extracted the tooth 
through the open window, but when it was something sterner he was 
with you in the dark square at once, like a man who slept in his 
topcoat), so I did as he bade me, and not only did she laugh then 
but again when I put the laugh down, so that though it was really 
one laugh with a tear in the middle I counted it as two.
<P>
It was doubtless that same sister who told me not to sulk when my 
mother lay thinking of him, but to try instead to get her to talk 
about him.  I did not see how this could make her the merry mother 
she used to be, but I was told that if I could not do it nobody 
could, and this made me eager to begin.  At first, they say, I was 
often jealous, stopping her fond memories with the cry, 'Do you 
mind nothing about me?' but that did not last; its place was taken 
by an intense desire (again, I think, my sister must have breathed 
it into life) to become so like him that even my mother should not 
see the difference, and many and artful were the questions I put to 
that end.  Then I practised in secret, but after a whole week had 
passed I was still rather like myself.  He had such a cheery way of 
whistling, she had told me, it had always brightened her at her 
work to hear him whistling, and when he whistled he stood with his 
legs apart, and his hands in the pockets of his knickerbockers.  I 
decided to trust to this, so one day after I had learned his 
whistle (every boy of enterprise invents a whistle of his own) from 
boys who had been his comrades, I secretly put on a suit of his 
clothes, dark grey they were, with little spots, and they fitted me 
many years afterwards, and thus disguised I slipped, unknown to the 
others, into my mother's room.  Quaking, I doubt not, yet so 
pleased, I stood still until she saw me, and then - how it must 
have hurt her!  'Listen!' I cried in a glow of triumph, and I 
stretched my legs wide apart and plunged my hands into the pockets 
of my knickerbockers, and began to whistle.
<P>
She lived twenty-nine years after his death, such active years 
until toward the end, that you never knew where she was unless you 
took hold of her, and though she was frail henceforth and ever 
growing frailer, her housekeeping again became famous, so that 
brides called as a matter of course to watch her ca'ming and 
sanding and stitching: there are old people still, one or two, to 
tell with wonder in their eyes how she could bake twenty-four 
bannocks in the hour, and not a chip in one of them.  And how many 
she gave away, how much she gave away of all she had, and what 
pretty ways she had of giving it!  Her face beamed and rippled with 
mirth as before, and her laugh that I had tried so hard to force 
came running home again.  I have heard no such laugh as hers save 
from merry children; the laughter of most of us ages, and wears out 
with the body, but hers remained gleeful to the last, as if it were 
born afresh every morning.  There was always something of the child 
in her, and her laugh was its voice, as eloquent of the past to me 
as was the christening robe to her.  But I had not made her forget 
the bit of her that was dead; in those nine-and-twenty years he was 
not removed one day farther from her.  Many a time she fell asleep 
speaking to him, and even while she slept her lips moved and she 
smiled as if he had come back to her, and when she woke he might 
vanish so suddenly that she started up bewildered and looked about 
her, and then said slowly, 'My David's dead!' or perhaps he 
remained long enough to whisper why he must leave her now, and then 
she lay silent with filmy eyes.  When I became a man and he was 
still a boy of thirteen, I wrote a little paper called 'Dead this 
Twenty Years,' which was about a similar tragedy in another woman's 
life, and it is the only thing I have written that she never spoke 
about, not even to that daughter she loved the best.  No one ever 
spoke of it to her, or asked her if she had read it: one does not 
ask a mother if she knows that there is a little coffin in the 
house.  She read many times the book in which it is printed, but 
when she came to that chapter she would put her hands to her heart 
or even over her ears.
