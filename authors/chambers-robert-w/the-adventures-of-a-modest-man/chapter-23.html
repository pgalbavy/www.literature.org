<p>Smith retired to his room to bathe, clothed himself in snowy
linen and fresh tennis flannels, and descended again, book under
his arm, to saunter forth through heavy tangles of cinnamon-tinted
Flemish roses and great sweet-scented peonies, musing on love
and fate.</p>

<p>"Kingsbury and his theories! The Countess of Semois will think
him crazy. She'll think us both crazy! And I am not sure that
we're not; youth is madness; half the world is lunatic! Take me,
for example; I never did a more unexpected thing than kissing
that shadow across the wall. I don't know why, I don't know how,
but I did it; and I am out of jail yet. Certainly it must have
been the cook. Oh, Heavens! If cooks kiss that way, what, <em>what</em>
must the indiscretion of a Countess resemble?... She <em>did</em>
kiss back.... At least there was a soft, tremulous, perfumed flutter&mdash;a
hint of delicate counter-pressure&#11834;"</p>

<p>But he had arrived at the wall by that time.</p>

<p>"How like a woodland paradise!" he murmured sentimentally, youthful
face upraised to the trees. "How sweet the zephyr! How softly
sing the dicky-birds! I wonder &mdash;I wonder&mdash;" But what it
was that perplexed him he did not say; he stood eying the top
of the wall as the furtive turkey eyes its selected roost before
coyly hopping thither.</p>

<p>"What's the use? If I see her I'll only take fright and skulk
homeward. Why do I return again and again to the scene of guilt?
Is it Countess or cook that draws me, or some one less exalted
in the culinary confine? Why, why should love get busy with me?
Is this the price I pay for that guileless kiss? Am I to be forever
'it' in love's gay game of tag?"</p>

<p>He ascended the steplike niche in the wall, peeped fearfully
over into his neighbour's chasse. Tree and tangle slept in the
golden light of afternoon; a cock-pheasant strutted out of a thicket,
surveyed the solitude with brilliant eyes, and strutted back again;
a baby rabbit frisked across the carrefour into the ferny warren
beyond; and "Bubble, bubble, flowed the stream, like an old song
through a dream."</p>

<p>Sprawling there flat on top of the sun-warmed stucco wall, white
sunlight barring the pages of his book, he lifted his head to
listen. There was a leafy stirring somewhere, perhaps the pheasant
rustling in the underbrush. The sing-song of the stream threaded
the silence; and as he listened it seemed to grow louder, filling
the woods with low, harmonious sounds. In the shallows he heard
laughter; in the pouring waterfalls, echoes like wind-blown voices
calling. Small grey and saffron tinted birds, passing from twig
to twig, peered at him fearlessly; a heavy green lizard vanished
between the stones with an iridescent wriggle. Suddenly a branch
snapped and the underbrush crackled.</p>

<p>"Probably a deer," thought Smith, turning to look. Close inspection
of the thicket revealed nothing; he dropped his chin on his hands,
crossed his legs, and opened his book.</p>

<p>The book was about one of those Americans who trouble the peace
of mind of Princesses; and this was the place to read it, here
in the enchanted stillness of the ancient Belgian forest, here
where the sunshine spread its net on fretted waters, where lost
pools glimmered with azure when the breeze stirred overhead&mdash;here
where his neighbor was a Countess and some one in her household
wore a mass of gold-red hair Greek fashion&mdash;and Aphrodite was
not whiter of neck nor bluer eyed than she.</p>

<p>The romance that he read was designed to be thickly satisfying
to American readers, for it described a typical American so accurately
that Smith did not recognize the type. Until he had been enlightened
by fiction he never imagined Americans were so attractive to exotic
nobility. So he read on, gratified, cloyed, wondering how the
Princess, although she happened to be encumbered with a husband,
could stand for anything but ultimate surrender to the Stars and
Stripes; and trustfully leaving it to another to see that it was
done morally.</p>

<p>Hypnotized by the approaching crisis, he had begun already to
finger the next page, when a slight crash in the bushes close
by and the swish of parting foliage startled him from romance
to reality.</p>

<p>But he had looked up too late; to slink away was impossible;
to move was to reveal himself. It was <em>she</em>! And she was
not ten feet distant.</p>

<p>One thing was certain: whether or not she was the shadowy partner
of his kiss, she could not be the Countess, because she was fishing,
unattended, hatless, the sleeves of her shirtwaist rolled up above
her white elbows, a book and a short landing-net tucked under
her left arm. Countesses don't go fishing unattended; gillies
carry things. Besides, the Countess of Semois was in Semois-les-Bains
selling dolls to Kingsbury.</p>

<p>The sun glowed on her splendid red hair; she switched the slender
rod about rather awkwardly, and every time the cast of flies became
entangled in a nodding willow she set her red lips tight and with
an impatient "<em>Mais, c'est trop bête! Mais, c'est vraiment
trop</em>&#11834;"</p>

<p>It was evident that she had not seen him where he lay on the
wall; the chances were she would pass on&mdash;indeed her back was
already toward him&mdash;when the unexpected happened: a trout leaped
for a gnat and fell back into the pool with a resounding splash,
sending ring on ring of sunny wavelets toward the shore.</p>

<p>"Ah! <em>Te voilà!</em>" she said aloud, swinging her line free
for a cast.</p>

<p>Smith saw what was coming and tried to dodge, but the silk line
whistled on the back-cast, and the next moment his cap was snatched
from his head and deposited some twenty feet out in the centre
of the pool.</p>

<p>The amazement of the fair angler was equal to his own as she
looked hastily back over her shoulder and discovered him on the
wall.</p>

<p>There is usually something undignified about a man whose hat
has been knocked off; to laugh is as fatal as to show irritation;
and Smith did neither, but quietly dropped over to her side of
the wall, saying, "I'm awfully sorry I spoiled your cast. Don't
mind the cap; that trout was a big one, and he may rise again."</p>

<p>He had spoken in English, and she answered in very pretty English:
"I am so sorry&mdash;could I help you to recover your hat?"</p>

<p>"Thank you; if you would let me take your rod a moment."</p>

<p>"Willingly, monsieur."</p>

<p>She handed him the rod; he loosened the line, measured the distance
with practiced eye, turned to look behind him, and, seeing there
was scant room for a long back-cast, began sending loop after
loop of silken line forward across the water, using the Spey method,
of which none except an expert is master.</p>

<p>The first cast struck half-way, but in line; the next, still
in line, slipped over the cap, but failed to hook. Then, as he
recovered, there was a boiling rush in the water, a flash of pink
and silver, and the rod staggered.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I beg your pardon!" he exclaimed aghast; "I have hooked
your trout!"</p>

<p>"Play him," she said quickly. The elfin shriek of the reel answered;
he gave the fish every ounce the quivering rod could spare, the
great trout surged deeply, swerved, circled and bored slowly upstream.</p>

<p>"This fish is magnificent," said Smith, guiltily. "You really
must take the rod&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I shall not, indeed."</p>

<p>"But this is not fair!"</p>

<p>"It is perfectly fair, monsieur&mdash;and a wonderful lesson in angling
to me. Oh, I beg you to be careful! There is a sunken tree limb
beyond!"</p>

<p>Her cheeks were the colour of wild roses, her blue eyes burned
like stars.</p>

<p>"He's down; I can't stir him," said Smith. "He's down like a
salmon!"</p>

<p>She linked her hands behind her back. "What is to be done?" she
asked calmly.</p>

<p>"If you would gather a handful of those pebbles and throw one
at a time into the pool where he is lying&#11834;"</p>

<p>Before he finished speaking she had knelt, filled her palms with
golden gravel, and stood ready at the water's edge.</p>

<p>"Now?" she nodded, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes, one at a time; try to hit him."</p>

<p>The first pebble produced no effect; neither did the second,
nor yet the third.</p>

<p>"Throw a handful at him," he suggested, and braced himself for
the result. A spray of gravel fell; the great fish sulked motionless.</p>

<p>"There's a way&mdash;" began Smith, feeling in his pockets for his
key-ring. It was not there.</p>

<p>"Could I be of any use?" she asked, looking up at Smith very
guilelessly.</p>

<p>"Why, if I had something&mdash;a key-ring or anything that I could
hang over the taut line&mdash;something that would slide down and jog
him gently&#11834;"</p>

<p>"A hairpin?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's too light."</p>

<p>She reflected a moment; her bent forefinger brushed her velvet
lips. Then she began to unfasten a long gold pin at her throat.</p>

<p>"Oh, not that!" exclaimed Smith, anxiously. "It might slip off."</p>

<p>"It can't; there's a safety clasp. Anyway, we must have that
trout!"</p>

<p>"But I could not permit&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It is I who permit myself, monsieur."</p>

<p>"No, no, it is too generous of you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Please!" She held the pin toward him; he shook his head; she
hesitated, then with a quick movement she snapped the clasp over
the taut line and sent it spinning toward the invisible fish.</p>

<p>He saw the gold glimmer become a spark under water, die out in
dusky depths; then came a rushing upheaval of spray, a flash,
the rod quivered to the reel-plate, and the fight began in fury.
The rod was so slim, so light&mdash;scarce three ounces&mdash;that he could
but stand on the defensive at first. Little by little the struggle
became give and take, then imperceptibly he forced the issue,
steadily, delicately, for the tackle was gossamer, and he fought
for the safety of the golden clasp as well as for his honour as
an angler.</p>

<p>"Do you know how to net a trout?" he asked presently. She came
and stood at his shoulder, net poised, blue eyes intent upon the
circling fish.</p>

<p>"I place it behind him, do I not?" she asked coolly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;when I give the word&#11834;"</p>

<p>One more swerve, a half circle sheering homeward, nearer, nearer&#11834;</p>

<p>A moment later the huge trout lay on the moss; iridescent tints
played over its broad surface, shimmering hues deepened, waxing,
warning; the spots glowed like rubies set in bronze.</p>

<p>Kneeling there, left hand resting on the rod, Smith looked up
at her over his shoulder; but all she said was: "Ah, the poor,
brave thing! The gallant fish! This is wrong&mdash;all wrong. I wish
we had not taken a life we cannot give again."</p>

<p>"Shall I put the trout back madame?"</p>

<p>She looked at him surprised.</p>

<p>"Would you?" she asked incredulously.</p>

<p>"If you desire it."</p>

<p>"But it is your fish."</p>

<p>"It is yours, madame."</p>

<p>"Will it live? Oh, try to make it live!"</p>

<p>He lifted the beautiful fish in both hands, and, walking to the
water's edge, laid it in the stream. For a while it floated there,
gold and silver belly turned to the sky, gills slowly inflating
and collapsing. Presently a fin stirred; the spasmodic movement
of the gill-covers ceased, and the breathing grew quiet and steady.
Smith touched the pectoral fins; the fish strove to turn over;
he steadied the dorsal fin, then the caudal, righting the fish.
Slowly, very slowly, the great trout moved off, farther, farther,
sinking into cool, refreshing depths; there was a dull glitter
under the water, a shadow gliding, then nothing except the green
obscurity of the pool criss-crossed with surface sunshine.</p>

<p>When Smith turned around the girl was pensively regarding the
water. His cap had stranded on a shoal almost at his feet; he
recovered it, wrung the drops from it, and stood twirling it thoughtfully
in the sunlight.</p>

<p>"I've ruined it, haven't I?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; it's a shooting-cap. Like Tartarin, I shall probably
ventilate it later in true Midi fashion."</p>

<p>She laughed; then, with the flushed composure of uneasiness:
"Thank you for a lesson in angling. I have learned a great deal&mdash;enough
at least to know that I shall not care to destroy life, even in
a fish."</p>

<p>"That is as it should be," he replied coolly. "Men find little
charm in women who kill."</p>

<p>"That is scarcely in accord with the English novels I read&mdash;and
I read many," she said laughing.</p>

<p>"It is true, nevertheless. Saint Hubert save us from the woman
who can watch the spark of life fade out in the eye of any living
thing."</p>

<p>"Are you not a little eccentric, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"If you say so. Eccentricity is the full-blown blossom of mediocrity."</p>
