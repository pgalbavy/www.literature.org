<P>On the following evening, at the usual hour, Van Baerle 
heard some one scratch at the grated little window, just as 
Rosa had been in the habit of doing in the heyday of their 
friendship.</P>
<P>Cornelius being, as may easily be imagined, not far off from 
the door, perceived Rosa, who at last was waiting again for 
him with her lamp in her hand.</P>
<P>Seeing him so sad and pale, she was startled, and said,  - </P>
<P>&quot;You are ill, Mynheer Cornelius?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; he answered, as indeed he was suffering in mind 
and in body.</P>
<P>&quot;I saw that you did not eat,&quot; said Rosa; &quot;my father told me 
that you remained in bed all day. I then wrote to calm your 
uneasiness concerning the fate of the most precious object 
of your anxiety.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And I,&quot; said Cornelius, &quot;I have answered. Seeing your 
return, my dear Rosa, I thought you had received my letter.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is true; I have received it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You cannot this time excuse yourself with not being able to 
read. Not only do you read very fluently, but also you have 
made marvellous progress in writing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed, I have not only received, but also read your note. 
Accordingly I am come to see whether there might not be some 
remedy to restore you to health.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Restore me to health?&quot; cried Cornelius; &quot;but have you any 
good news to communicate to me?&quot;</P>
<P>Saying this, the poor prisoner looked at Rosa, his eyes 
sparkling with hope.</P>
<P>Whether she did not, or would not, understand this look, 
Rosa answered gravely,  - </P>
<P>&quot;I have only to speak to you about your tulip, which, as I 
well know, is the object uppermost in your mind.&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa pronounced those few words in a freezing tone, which 
cut deeply into the heart of Cornelius. He did not suspect 
what lay hidden under this appearance of indifference with 
which the poor girl affected to speak of her rival, the 
black tulip.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh!&quot; muttered Cornelius, &quot;again! again! Have I not told 
you, Rosa, that I thought but of you? that it was you alone 
whom I regretted, you whom I missed, you whose absence I 
felt more than the loss of liberty and of life itself?&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa smiled with a melancholy air.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah!&quot; she said, &quot;your tulip has been in such danger.&quot;</P>
<P>Cornelius trembled involuntarily, and showed himself clearly 
to be caught in the trap, if ever the remark was meant as 
such.</P>
<P>&quot;Danger!&quot; he cried, quite alarmed; &quot;what danger?&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa looked at him with gentle compassion; she felt that 
what she wished was beyond the power of this man, and that 
he must be taken as he was, with his little foible.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;you have guessed the truth; that suitor 
and amorous swain, Jacob, did not come on my account.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And what did he come for?&quot; Cornelius anxiously asked.</P>
<P>&quot;He came for the sake of the tulip.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Alas!&quot; said Cornelius, growing even paler at this piece of 
information than he had been when Rosa, a fortnight before, 
had told him that Jacob was coming for her sake.</P>
<P>Rosa saw this alarm, and Cornelius guessed, from the 
expression of her face, in what direction her thoughts were 
running.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, pardon me, Rosa!&quot; he said, &quot;I know you, and I am well 
aware of the kindness and sincerity of your heart. To you 
God has given the thought and strength for defending 
yourself; but to my poor tulip, when it is in danger, God 
has given nothing of the sort.&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa, without replying to this excuse of the prisoner, 
continued,  - </P>
<P>&quot;From the moment when I first knew that you were uneasy on 
account of the man who followed me, and in whom I had 
recognized Jacob, I was even more uneasy myself. On the day, 
therefore, after that on which I saw you last, and on which 
you said  -  &quot;</P>
<P>Cornelius interrupted her.</P>
<P>&quot;Once more, pardon me, Rosa!&quot; he cried. &quot;I was wrong in 
saying to you what I said. I have asked your pardon for that 
unfortunate speech before. I ask it again: shall I always 
ask it in vain?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;On the following day,&quot; Rosa continued, &quot;remembering what 
you had told me about the stratagem which I was to employ to 
ascertain whether that odious man was after the tulip, or 
after me  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, yes, odious. Tell me,&quot; he said, &quot;do you hate that 
man?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do hate him,&quot; said Rosa, &quot;as he is the cause of all the 
unhappiness I have suffered these eight days.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You, too, have been unhappy, Rosa? I thank you a thousand 
times for this kind confession.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, on the day after that unfortunate one, I went down 
into the garden and proceeded towards the border where I was 
to plant your tulip, looking round all the while to see 
whether I was again followed as I was last time.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And then?&quot; Cornelius asked.</P>
<P>&quot;And then the same shadow glided between the gate and the 
wall, and once more disappeared behind the elder-trees.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You feigned not to see him, didn't you?&quot; Cornelius asked, 
remembering all the details of the advice which he had given 
to Rosa.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, and I stooped over the border, in which I dug with a 
spade, as if I was going to put the bulb in.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And he,  -  what did he do during all this time?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I saw his eyes glisten through the branches of the tree 
like those of a tiger.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There you see, there you see!&quot; cried Cornelius.</P>
<P>&quot;Then, after having finished my make-believe work, I 
retired.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But only behind the garden door, I dare say, so that you 
might see through the keyhole what he was going to do when 
you had left?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He waited for a moment, very likely to make sure of my not 
coming back, after which he sneaked forth from his 
hiding-place, and approached the border by a long 
round-about; at last, having reached his goal, that is to 
say, the spot where the ground was newly turned, he stopped 
with a careless air, looking about in all directions, and 
scanning every corner of the garden, every window of the 
neighbouring houses, and even the sky; after which, thinking 
himself quite alone, quite isolated, and out of everybody's 
sight, he pounced upon the border, plunged both his hands 
into the soft soil, took a handful of the mould, which he 
gently frittered between his fingers to see whether the bulb 
was in it, and repeated the same thing twice or three times, 
until at last he perceived that he was outwitted. Then, 
keeping down the agitation which was raging in his breast, 
he took up the rake, smoothed the ground, so as to leave it 
on his retiring in the same state as he had found it, and, 
quite abashed and rueful, walked back to the door, affecting 
the unconcerned air of an ordinary visitor of the garden.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, the wretch!&quot; muttered Cornelius, wiping the cold sweat 
from his brow. &quot;Oh, the wretch! I guessed his intentions. 
But the bulb, Rosa; what have you done with it? It is 
already rather late to plant it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The bulb? It has been in the ground for these six days.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Where? and how?&quot; cried Cornelius. &quot;Good Heaven, what 
imprudence! What is it? In what sort of soil is it? It what 
aspect? Good or bad? Is there no risk of having it filched 
by that detestable Jacob?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There is no danger of its being stolen,&quot; said Rosa, &quot;unless 
Jacob will force the door of my chamber.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! then it is with you in your bedroom?&quot; said Cornelius, 
somewhat relieved. &quot;But in what soil? in what vessel? You 
don't let it grow, I hope, in water like those good ladies 
of Haarlem and Dort, who imagine that water could replace 
the earth?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You may make yourself comfortable on that score,&quot; said 
Rosa, smiling; &quot;your bulb is not growing in water.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I breathe again.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is in a good, sound stone pot, just about the size of 
the jug in which you had planted yours. The soil is composed 
of three parts of common mould, taken from the best spot of 
the garden, and one of the sweepings of the road. I have 
heard you and that detestable Jacob, as you call him, so 
often talk about what is the soil best fitted for growing 
tulips, that I know it as well as the first gardener of 
Haarlem.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And now what is the aspect, Rosa?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At present it has the sun all day long,  -  that is to say 
when the sun shines. But when it once peeps out of the 
ground, I shall do as you have done here, dear Mynheer 
Cornelius: I shall put it out of my window on the eastern 
side from eight in the morning until eleven and in my window 
towards the west from three to five in the afternoon.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's it! that's it!&quot; cried Cornelius; &quot;and you are a 
perfect gardener, my pretty Rosa. But I am afraid the 
nursing of my tulip will take up all your time.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, it will,&quot; said Rosa; &quot;but never mind. Your tulip is my 
daughter. I shall devote to it the same time as I should to 
a child of mine, if I were a mother. Only by becoming its 
mother,&quot; Rosa added, smilingly, &quot;can I cease to be its 
rival.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My kind and pretty Rosa!&quot; muttered Cornelius casting on her 
a glance in which there was much more of the lover than of 
the gardener, and which afforded Rosa some consolation.</P>
<P>Then, after a silence of some moments, during which 
Cornelius had grasped through the openings of the grating 
for the receding hand of Rosa, he said,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Do you mean to say that the bulb has now been in the ground 
for six days?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, six days, Mynheer Cornelius,&quot; she answered.</P>
<P>&quot;And it does not yet show leaf&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, but I think it will to-morrow.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, to-morrow you will bring me news about it, and 
about yourself, won't you, Rosa? I care very much for the 
daughter, as you called it just now, but I care even much 
more for the mother.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To-morrow?&quot; said Rosa, looking at Cornelius askance. &quot;I 
don't know whether I shall be able to come to-morrow.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good heavens!&quot; said Cornelius, &quot;why can't you come 
to-morrow?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Mynheer Cornelius, I have lots of things to do.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And I have only one,&quot; muttered Cornelius.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Rosa, &quot;to love your tulip.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To love you, Rosa.&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa shook her head, after which followed a pause.</P>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot;  -  Cornelius at last broke the silence,  -  &quot;well, 
Rosa, everything changes in the realm of nature; the flowers 
of spring are succeeded by other flowers; and the bees, 
which so tenderly caressed the violets and the wall-flowers, 
will flutter with just as much love about the honey-suckles, 
the rose, the jessamine, and the carnation.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What does all this mean?&quot; asked Rosa.</P>
<P>&quot;You have abandoned me, Miss Rosa, to seek your pleasure 
elsewhere. You have done well, and I will not complain. What 
claim have I to your fidelity?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My fidelity!&quot; Rosa exclaimed, with her eyes full of tears, 
and without caring any longer to hide from Cornelius this 
dew of pearls dropping on her cheeks, &quot;my fidelity! have I 
not been faithful to you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you call it faithful to desert me, and to leave me here 
to die?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But, Mynheer Cornelius,&quot; said Rosa, &quot;am I not doing 
everything for you that could give you pleasure? have I not 
devoted myself to your tulip?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are bitter, Rosa, you reproach me with the only 
unalloyed pleasure which I have had in this world.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I reproach you with nothing, Mynheer Cornelius, except, 
perhaps, with the intense grief which I felt when people 
came to tell me at the Buytenhof that you were about to be 
put to death.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are displeased, Rosa, my sweet girl, with my loving 
flowers.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am not displeased with your loving them, Mynheer 
Cornelius, only it makes me sad to think that you love them 
better than you do me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, my dear, dear Rosa! look how my hands tremble; look at 
my pale cheek, hear how my heart beats. It is for you, my 
love, not for the black tulip. Destroy the bulb, destroy the 
germ of that flower, extinguish the gentle light of that 
innocent and delightful dream, to which I have accustomed 
myself; but love me, Rosa, love me; for I feel deeply that I 
love but you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, after the black tulip,&quot; sighed Rosa, who at last no 
longer coyly withdrew her warm hands from the grating, as 
Cornelius most affectionately kissed them.</P>
<P>&quot;Above and before everything in this world, Rosa.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;May I believe you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As you believe in your own existence.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, be it so; but loving me does not bind you too 
much.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Unfortunately, it does not bind me more than I am bound; 
but it binds you, Rosa, you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To what?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;First of all, not to marry.&quot;</P>
<P>She smiled.</P>
<P>&quot;That's your way,&quot; she said; &quot;you are tyrants all of you. 
You worship a certain beauty, you think of nothing but her. 
Then you are condemned to death, and whilst walking to the 
scaffold, you devote to her your last sigh; and now you 
expect poor me to sacrifice to you all my dreams and my 
happiness.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But who is the beauty you are talking of, Rosa?&quot; said 
Cornelius, trying in vain to remember a woman to whom Rosa 
might possibly be alluding.</P>
<P>&quot;The dark beauty with a slender waist, small feet, and a 
noble head; in short, I am speaking of your flower.&quot;</P>
<P>Cornelius smiled.</P>
<P>&quot;That is an imaginary lady love, at all events; whereas, 
without counting that amorous Jacob, you by your own account 
are surrounded with all sorts of swains eager to make love 
to you. Do you remember Rosa, what you told me of the 
students, officers, and clerks of the Hague? Are there no 
clerks, officers, or students at Loewestein?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed there are, and lots of them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who write letters?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They do write.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And now, as you know how to read  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>Here Cornelius heaved a sigh at the thought, that, poor 
captive as he was, to him alone Rosa owed the faculty of 
reading the love-letters which she received.</P>
<P>&quot;As to that,&quot; said Rosa, &quot;I think that in reading the notes 
addressed to me, and passing the different swains in review 
who send them to me, I am only following your instructions.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How so? My instructions?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed, your instructions, sir,&quot; said Rosa, sighing in her 
turn; &quot;have you forgotten the will written by your hand on 
the Bible of Cornelius de Witt? I have not forgotten it; for 
now, as I know how to read, I read it every day over and 
over again. In that will you bid me to love and marry a 
handsome young man of twenty-six or eight years. I am on the 
look-out for that young man, and as the whole of my day is 
taken up with your tulip, you must needs leave me the 
evenings to find him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But, Rosa, the will was made in the expectation of death, 
and, thanks to Heaven, I am still alive.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, I shall not be after the handsome young man, 
and I shall come to see you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's it, Rosa, come! come!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Under one condition.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Granted beforehand!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That the black tulip shall not be mentioned for the next 
three days.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It shall never be mentioned any more, if you wish it, 
Rosa.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, no,&quot; the damsel said, laughing, &quot;I will not ask for 
impossibilities.&quot;</P>
<P>And, saying this, she brought her fresh cheek, as if 
unconsciously, so near the iron grating, that Cornelius was 
able to touch it with his lips.</P>
<P>Rosa uttered a little scream, which, however, was full of 
love, and disappeared. </P></article>
