<p>Fred Munson felt that he had been extremely fortunate, not only
in securing a good, substantial supper, but in getting a rifle.
With it he could guard against danger and starvation. In that
country, and especially among those mountains, was quite an abundance
of game, and he had learned how to aim a gun too well to prevent
his throwing any shots away.</p>

<p>By this time the night was well advanced, and he concluded that
the wisest thing he could do was to hunt up some place where he
could sleep until morning. This did not seem to be difficult in
a country so cut up and broken by rocks, and he moved away from
the camp-fire with a sense of deep gratitude for the extraordinary
good fortune that had followed him from the time Lone Wolf had
withdrawn him from the main party.</p>

<p>"Now, if I could only get a horse," he said to himself, "I would
be set up in business. I could find the way back to New Boston
in a day or two, shooting what game I want, and keeping out of
the way of all Indians. I wonder what has become of Sut Simpson?
I expected he would be somewhere around here before this. It would
be very handy to come across him just now and have him help me
home. And there's Mickey Rooney. He went off on one of the best
horses; and if he could pick me up and take me along, it wouldn't
need much time for us to get back home. Ah, if I only had Hurricane
here," he sighed. "How we would go back through that ravine, leaving
behind us the best horses in the country; but there's no use of
thinking of that. Hurricane is at home, and so he can't be here,
and I must trust to Providence to get back. I have something now
that is of more use than a horse. If I miss with one charge, I
can&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly in amazement, for at that juncture he recalled
a piece of great stupidity which he had committed. He had secured
the rifle, and yet he had left without one thought of the indispensable
ammunition that was required to make the weapon of any use. He
did not know whether the gun in his hand was loaded or not, in
which latter case it was of no more account than a piece of wood.</p>

<p>"Well, if that don't beat everything," he muttered, at a loss
to understand how he could have committed such an oversight. "I
never once thought of it till this minute, and now it's too late!"</p>

<p>The reflection of his great need inclined him to return to the
camp-fire and incur the risk involved in the effort to repair
the blunder that he had committed.</p>

<p>"<em>That</em> Indian cannot hurt me, and I don't suppose that
any of the others have come back. It won't take me long to get
what I want; and I will do it, too."</p>

<p>He was but a short distance from the place, and, having decided
upon the proper course, he moved rapidly back upon the path he
had just trod, and in a few minutes was beside the rock, which
was becoming familiar in a certain sense. Mindful of the danger
to which one was always exposed in that section, Fred peered around
the rock with the same silence and caution as before. The result
was a disappointment. The Kiowa had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Now it can't be that he was only pretending he was asleep all
the time," thought the puzzled lad. "And yet, if he wasn't, how
was it he managed to get away?"</p>

<p>A few minutes' reflection convinced Fred that it was impossible
that there should have been any such thing as he had imagined
at first. The more reasonable theory was that some of the Kiowas
had returned and taken the body of their comrade away, fearful,
perhaps, that some of the Apaches might put in an appearance again
and rob him of his scalp. However, whatever the explanation was,
Fred saw that his expedition was a failure. There was nothing
to be gained by remaining where he was, while there was unmistakable
risk of being detected by some of the copper-colored prowlers.</p>

<p>He noticed that the camp-fire bore very much the same appearance
as when he last saw it, and the probabilities were that the Kiowas
were some distance away at that very time; but the young fugitive
had already run enough risk, without incurring any more, and he
resolved to spend an hour or two in getting out of the neighborhood
altogether.</p>

<p>There was little choice of direction, but it was natural that
he should prefer the back-trail, and, clambering down into the
ravine again, he turned his face to the southward, directly through
the ravine that he had traversed during the day upon the back
of Waukko's mustang.</p>

<p>"I can tell when I reach the place where Lone Wolf and his men
left us,"  he said to himself. "That will take me a good while,
but when I do find it, the trail will be so much larger and plainer
that there will be no trouble about following it, but it will
take me several days to do it, and it is going to be hard work.
I need all the time possible, so I guess it will be best to keep
going all night."</p>

<p>There was not so much amusement in this as he fancied, but he
kept it up bravely for some two or three hours, during which he
made good headway. The walking was comparatively easy in the ravine,
which was one of those openings encountered at intervals among
the mountains in the West, and which are known under the name
of passes. In many places it would be utterly out of the question
for parties to force their way through the chains but for these
avenues, which nature has kindly furnished.</p>

<p>The moonlight was just sufficient to make the boy feel uneasy.
He could discern objects, although indistinctly, nearly a hundred
yards away, and where the character of the gorge was continually
shifting to a certain extent there was abundant play for the imagination.</p>

<p>He had been walking but a short time when he abruptly halted,
under the impression that he had seen an Indian run across the
gorge directly in front of him. This caused a wilder throbbing
of his heart, and another examination of his gun, which was loaded,
as he had assured himself some time before, and ready at any time
to do him one good turn, if no more.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't have skipped over in that style if he had known
I was so near," was the reflection of the boy, as he sheltered
himself in the shadow of the rocks and looked and listened. "How
did he know but what I might have picked him off? What was to
hinder me? If he did n't know I was here, why, it ain't likely
that he would loaf along the side of the ravine."</p>

<p>By such a course of reasoning, he was not long in convincing
himself that the way was open for his advance. He hurried by on
tiptoe, and drew a long breath of relief when certain that he
had passed the dangerous spot. But he was only a short distance
beyond when his hair fairly arose on end, for he became certain
that he heard the groan of a man among the boulders over his head.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the matter is there?" he whispered, peering upward
in the gloom and shadow. "It may be some white man that the Indians
have left for dead, and that still has some life in his body,
or it may be an Indian himself who has met with an accident&mdash;helloa!"&mdash;</p>

<p>Just then it sounded again, and a cold shiver of terror crept
over him from head to foot, as he was able to locate the precise
point from which it came. The frightful groaning did not stop
as suddenly as before, but rose and sank, with a sound like the
wail of some suffering human being.</p>

<p>As Fred stood trembling and listening, his shuddering fear collapsed;
for the sound which had transfixed him with such dread, he now
recognized as the whistling of the wind, which, slight in itself,
was still manipulated in some peculiar fashion by a nook in the
rocks overhead.</p>

<p>"That does sound odd enough to scare a person," he muttered,
as he resumed his walk. "It must be a regular trumpet-blast when
the wind is high, for there isn't much now."</p>

<p>The two incidents resulting so harmlessly, Fred was inspired
with greater confidence, and advanced at a more rapid walk along
the ravine, suffering no check until he had gone fully a mile
further. Just then, while striding along with increasing courage,
he came to a place where the side of the ravine was perpendicular
for two or three hundred feet.</p>

<p>He was close to this, so as to use the protection of the shadow,
and was dreaming of no danger, when a rattling of gravel and debris
caused him to look up, and he saw an immense mass of rock, that
had become loosened in some way, descending straight for his head.</p>
