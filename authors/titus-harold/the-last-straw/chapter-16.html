<p>The fire in Webb's cook stove was not all that furnished warmth to the
three men sitting about it that night, for they drank frequently from
the bottle which, when not passing from hand to hand, was nestled on
Dick Hilton's lap, his hands caressing its smooth surface lovingly ...
save the word!
</p><p>Sam McKee and three other men played solo on the table, noisily and
quarrelsomely after the manner of their kind. Engrossed in the game
they gave little heed to the talk of the others. It was shop talk, of
plots and schemes, of danger and distrust.
</p><p>Webb's little button eyes were even more ugly than usual, Hilton's
mouth drawn in lines that were even more cruel, but Hepburn, under
influence of the liquor, only became more paternal, more deliberate as
the evening and the drinking went on. He was not nettled by Webb's
disfavor, and even smiled on the rancher indulgently as he listened to
the querulous plaint.
</p><p>"If you'd only used yer head an' stayed there," Webb went on, "then
we'd hev had it all easy-like. You could've stole her blind an' she'd
never knew. Then you had to git on the peck about _him!_" He
sniffed in disgust.
</p><p>"Now, Webb, you're too harsh in what you say," the other replied
blandly. "I done all I could but Beck wouldn't be blinded! He's got
second sight or somethin',"--with a degree of heat.
</p><p>"We had him scotched all right, but we hadn't figured on the girl.
Nobody'd thought she was sweet on him!"
</p><p>Hilton stirred uneasily and the color in his face deepened. He looked
at Hepburn with an ugly light in his eyes.
</p><p>"That upset everything," Hepburn went on. "There wasn't no use tryin'
to play a quiet game after that. They both know we want to get rid of
'em worst way and now we've got to keep under cover an' use our heads
harder'n ever."
</p><p>"There's too many in it," Webb whined. "I tell you the's too many in
it! If you'd let me alone, just me an' the boys, I'd felt safer. But
now there's Cole an' his daughter an' ... half the country!"
</p><p>He flashed an indecisive glance at Hilton who studied the bottle,
frowning.
</p><p>"Lots in it," Hepburn said heavily, "but they've got to hang together
or...."
</p><p>"Separately," added Dick cynically.
</p><p>Hepburn nodded and Webb shifted and jerked his head petulantly.
</p><p>"But there's nothin' to fret about," Dad went on. "None of us will be a
leak. Cole can't because we could put him behind bars by just lettin'
on that he'd used his homestead rights under another name an' had no
right on this place, let alone other things.
</p><p>"We can use his brand, which is why I brought him in here. I've spread
the news that he's bought cows of you an' between workin' over the HC
and ventin' your marks we'll have a herd here in a couple of seasons
that'll make us rich!
</p><p>"An' we'll have range for 'em, too. She won't stand up under a range
war!"
</p><p>"But Beck will," Webb protested.
</p><p>"He will if you don't get rid of him!" with slow anger behind the words
and a cunning glitter in his eyes. "I don't see how in hell you missed
him. You must've been drunk!"
</p><p>"He wasn't in his bed, I tell you. He couldn't 've been!"
</p><p>"Well, if _I_ had against him what you got, I'd get him," Hepburn
stated emphatically, well satisfied, and showing it, that this was a
masterly stroke. "He made you laughed at by the whole country."
</p><p>"You wait," Webb snarled. "My time's comin'!"
</p><p>"Deliberately, I'd say," Hilton put in ironically.
</p><p>"Oh, you're always kickin'!" Webb protested. "I don't see why you stay
on if things don't satisfy you. You've got to have sheets on your bed,
you've got to have grub cooked different, you've got to sleep late an'
you've got to have hot water to wash and shave always when th' kettle's
cold! You've got into this deal an' you'd like to run it your way.
</p><p>"What the hell do you stay on for?"
</p><p>Hepburn looked at Hilton's face as though he, too, wondered just why he
stayed on, but, pursuing his usual tactics, he said:
</p><p>"Why, if Mr. Hilton can pay for it, why can't he have his way? He has
the money. He's willing to spend it. I'm sure his willingness to stake
Cole to fence and hired help means a lot to all of us, Webb. That's
goin' to drive her out of the Hole entire this summer.
</p><p>"The booze has made you irritable, Webb."
</p><p>Webb sat forward, elbows on knees, chin in his hands and grumbled:
</p><p>"I have to stand a lot, I do. Both of you eggin' me on all the time,
all the time! I do th' best I can, but nothin's ever satisfactory.
Nobody ever does anything for me!"
</p><p>"Sho, Webb, that ain't so. Didn't Mr. Hilton give you a brand new
automatic? Ain't I been reasonable in turnin' a chance to make good
your way?"
</p><p>The other fidgeted, then looked up at Hilton.
</p><p>"I don't see why <u>you've</u> got such an interest in this for,
anyhow. Course, it's none of my business, but I don't see why you
should always egg me on about Beck."
</p><p>"I am concerned to see the THO prosper," said Hilton mockingly. "That
is why I bought fence; that is why I want your friend, the HC foreman,
out of the way."
</p><p>He rose, placed the bottle on the table and stepped out of the house.
They heard him walk across the dooryard and into the stable.
</p><p>"You s'pose he's goin' to meet her again tonight?" Webb growled.
</p><p>"Likely.... It's likely."
</p><p>"I wish th' hell he'd clear out. I don't see what you wanted to take
him in for!"
</p><p>Hepburn chuckled.
</p><p>"How could you keep him out? The girl, she knows everything, an' what
she knows he knows. His money's valuable to us an' besides ... it'll
keep her quiet if we ever do get out on a limb."
</p><p>Webb looked up in query.
</p><p>"You're right when you say there's too many in it, Webb, but there's
just <u>one</u> too many. That's the girl! I can't figure her out; I
can't trust her. If we was to try to pass the buck to Cole, in a pinch,
she'd raise the deuce.... That is, she would if it wasn't for Hilton."
</p><p>"How's that?"
</p><p>"If she turned on the rest of us, it'd catch Hilton an' she's gone on
him. Never saw a girl who was so loyal to her father but when you bring
in another man that loyalty won't stand up in a pinch; not if it's a
choice between a father and a lover."
</p><p>"But he ain't on the level with her!"
</p><p>"Makes no difference. She's took to him like girls of her sort do. He
can handle her an' she's the only one that knows our side who'll ever
need any handlin'. He was right when he said the rest of us'd have to
hang together, or separately."
</p><p>Outside a horseman rode quietly to the gate and sat looking through the
open doorway and the one window of the room. He counted the men
carefully; counted again, then rode back the way he had come and
stopped and waited.
</p><p>"But what about the other girl ... Hunter?" Webb asked after a silent
interval. "Hilton was sweet on her."
</p><p>Hepburn's eyes kindled.
</p><p>"His jealousy is another asset. Hilton wanted her an' couldn't get her,
an' he knows the reason now: It's Beck. You think he's been practicin'
with a rifle and pistol for the fun of it? Not on your life!" Leaning
closer: "The time may come, Webb, when Hilton'll clear Beck out of our
way.... That'd be easier. I don't want to try it in the open; I don't
guess you do. He's got a crimp in all the boys. Look at Sam, for
instance. He's itchin' to kill Beck but he ain't got the sand!"
</p><p>"If she ever found out he wasn't on the level with her,"--Webb's mind
going back to Bobby Cole--"she'd claw him up fearful."
</p><p>"Yup. But she's in love an' love plays hell with men and women, Webb."
</p><p>The other started to reply, then sat rigid, listening.
</p><p>A horse came up the road at a slow trot and halted by the gate. A
saddle creaked, then the bars complained as they were lowered. A man
was whistling lightly as he rode toward the house and dismounted,
leaving his horse standing.
</p><p>"Must be one of the boys," he said, and settled back. None who had
other than friendly business there would come uncautious.
</p><p>"I was going to say," went on Hepburn, "that they'll be fooled about
that Hole range. It's time for the cattle to start comin' in from the
desert. They'll get up there and the creek'll be an ash bed with a
couple more days of this sun. They can't take 'em back through the Gap
without a big loss and if they leave 'em in the Hole without water long
enough they can't get 'em up the trail without loss so--"
</p><p>"If you'll all rise up and put up your hands we won't have any trouble
... tonight!"
</p><p>Hepburn looked slowly over his shoulder, slightly bewildered. Webb, who
had been stooped forward, raised his eyes and breath slipped through
his lips in a long hiss. Sam McKee, who had reached out to take a
trick, let his ace drop from limp fingers. The other three started up
like guilty men sharply accused of their crime.
</p><p>Tom Beck, a revolver in each hand, stood framed in the doorway, bending
forward from the hips, hat back, eyes burning. His voice had been level
and natural, with something akin to a laugh in it, but when he spoke
again it was a rasp:
</p><p>"Get up on your rattles, you snakes, and put up your hands!"
</p><p>With an oath Hepburn sprang to his feet, faced about and raised his
arms. Webb followed, with jerky movements, his face pallid with fear.
The four card players got from their chairs. As McKee's hands went
slowly above his head they trembled like aspen branches in a breeze.
</p><p>For a long moment there was no sound, save Hepburn's heavy breathing.
Then Tom Beck let a curious smile run across his lips.
</p><p>"This is a hell of a way to come to talk business," he commented. "I
don't like it ... but little more than you seem to. It's the safest way
for me. That's why I'm here, to consider my safety."
</p><p>He let his gaze run from face to face. Webb's eyes met his squarely, a
baleful challenge in them, but as he glared at Hepburn, Hepburn's gaze
wavered, flicking back twice, only to drop again. McKee whimpered under
his breath. The other three stared back sullenly, alert for an opening.
</p><p>Beck moved into the room just one step.
</p><p>"I don't know who it is that's been tryin' to kill me, but it wouldn't
take many guesses," he said. Again his eyes ran from face to face. "It
might be you, Hepburn, and it might be you, Webb. It's like both of
you, to shoot from cover ... like you accused me of shootin'. It might
be McKee, but even that takes more nerve than he's got. I wouldn't put
it past any of the rest of you.
</p><p>"I didn't come here to try to find out. I got more important things to
do than to identify the party right now.
</p><p>"I rode over this evening to make a little call an' to drop the word
that if I see any of this outfit anywhere near the HC ranch or on its
range there's goin' to be shootin' a-plenty and that if you want to be
the first to shoot, you want to draw almighty quick! If any of you see
one of my men anywhere, you hit the breeze. It's the best way out of
trouble.
</p><p>"Hepburn, you an' Webb tried to frame me once. That's sufficient cause.
I'd kill you like I'd kill a ... a scorpion. McKee don't count. You
other three probably are in on the threat to drive me out of the
country. Just workin' here puts you beyond the law that protects honest
men.
</p><p>"Now there's a little matter of trouble that's happened around the HC.
That's going to stop from now on. We've got lots of men over there who
are handy with their artillery. They're pretty well worked up. There
won't be a finger lifted to prevent you workin' within your rights, but
the first crooked move one of you makes ... there'll be a new table
boarder in th' devil's kitchen.
</p><p>"That's all I come to say. That's all the conversation that'll be
necessary between us from now on. The HC is goin' to keep doing
business, and its present owner is going to stay on the job. As for me
... it's been talked around that I was to be drove out an' all I've got
to say is, come on and do your driving!"
</p><p>His mouth set with an expression of finality and his eyes bored into
theirs. He was through, but even as he straightened preparatory to
backing through the doorway into the night a flicker of cunning crossed
Dad Hepburn's face, set there by a faint, faint creaking of the stable
door, unheard by Beck whose own voice had been in his ears.
</p><p>"Don't you think you're a little quick in passin' judgment, Tom?" he
asked.
</p><p>Beck laughed shortly.
</p><p>"Looking for me to handle you with gloves, Dad? After you tried to
frame me? After you--" He checked himself shortly as he was about to
accuse Hepburn of one specific art of treachery against the H.C. He
might need that later. "After you've tried to get me?
</p><p>"No, somebody shot at my bed one night; somebody shot at me while I was
riding open country one day." At that a glint of astonishment showed in
Webb's face. "There's just one way to handle men like that, and I'm
doin' it now, to-night. I'm--"
</p><p>The crash of a shot from behind, the splintering of the door panel at
his shoulder, cut him short. Webb jumped as though the bullet had been
sent at him. Hepburn's face contorted into a grimace of elation.
</p><p>With a catch of his breath Beck wheeled, senses steeled to this
emergency, driving down the quick panic that wanted to throttle his
heart.
</p><p>There in the shaft of yellow light, bareheaded, stepping toward him,
arm raised to fire again, was Dick Hilton. It was a situation in which
fractions of time were infinitely precious. That first shot had gone
wild because the Easterner, unfamiliar with fire arms, unnerved by the
rage which swept up within him, had let his eagerness have full sway.
But now he was stepping forward, coming closer. At that range he could
not miss!
</p><p>And Beck saw all that in the split second it required for him to whirl,
leaving his back exposed to those other men for the instant. He
squeezed the trigger as he flipped his left-hand gun toward his
assailant. The two reports sounded almost as one, but the stream of
fire from Hilton's weapon instead of stabbing toward Beck streaked into
the air and the automatic, ripped from his hand by the same ball that
tore his fingers, spun clinking to earth.
</p><p>But even as it struck, before Beck could turn again to cover the room
behind, a swinging palm sent the lamp crashing to the floor. He sprang
clear of the doorway. An instant before he had dominated the situation,
now he was a fugitive.
</p><p>Inside, darkness; out in the dooryard, starlight. Inside, ruthless
enemies who had listened to a declaration that precluded quarter;
outside, their target who could not hope to live before the fusillade
that must come.
</p><p>"Put up your hands!" Beck gasped, jabbing a gun into Hilton's stomach
and springing behind the Easterner's body, screening himself.
</p><p>Crouched there, peering over the other's shoulder, one gun against
Hilton's trembling body, the other thrust past it to cover the doorway,
he paused. He heard quick, unsteady footsteps, an oath, a hurried word
and then the man before him cried huskily:
</p><p>"For God's sake don't shoot, boys! You'll get me!"
</p><p>After that there passed a moment in which Hilton's breath made the only
sound that came to Beck's ears.
</p><p>"I'm going to back up to my horse," he said lowly, "you follow me."
</p><p>It was unnecessary to add a threat. Enough threat in the situation!
</p><p>Slowly he began to back, feeling his way, shoving the one gun harder
against Hilton's body, keeping the other ready for instant use should
those who watched choose to shoot down the Easterner to be at him. The
roan snorted softly in query and Beck spoke. But the animal, startled
by the shooting, unsatisfied that this huddle creeping toward him was
wholly friendly, backed off. Tom spoke again; then ceased all movement,
for from inside had come a muttering and stealthy footsteps crossed the
floor. A door at the rear of the house creaked. One or several had gone
out to stalk him! The others, he knew, waited within to take first
opportunity to kill that might be offered.
</p><p>"Stand still!" he said sharply to the horse and turned his head ever so
quickly to see the animal, head to him, back slowly.
</p><p>He moved backward faster for a few steps, shoving the revolver harder
into Hilton's body to assure his obedience, but the horse only
progressed as rapidly, snuffing loudly at this performance which no
horse could be expected to understand!
</p><p>They moved in a circle, swinging in toward the house, Beck ever keeping
Hilton as a direct screen. He stopped and the horse stopped. He
listened. He heard soft movements within the house. He thought he heard
a faint rustling behind a far corner of the building but a cow, bawling
at the moment, obscured the faint sound.
</p><p>Beck felt a cold damp standing out on his body. From the darkness, from
any direction, disaster might strike at any second!
</p><p>He began to talk to the horse soothingly, moving toward him slowly, but
the roan would not understand. Once he was within an arm's length of
the bridle, but before he could grasp it the animal had swung his head
ever so slightly and was moving off again, passing a corner of the
house from where that suggestion of a rustle had come.
</p><p>And then, of a sudden, the horse leaped sideways, with a startled
grunt, as a horse will that comes upon a coiled snake. He lunged toward
Beck and Hilton, swinging about on his hind feet, beginning to run for
the gate, thoroughly frightened and bent on escape from the thing that
alarmed him.
</p><p>It was Beck's last chance! As the horse leaped toward the gate he
sprang back a pace from Hilton, raised both guns and fired, one at the
window, one at the doorway. Glass burst and tinkled and he heard the
panel of the door again sliver. As he opened fire the great roan
swerved; his hoofs spurned the ground in the impatience of fright and
Beck, shooting again toward the house, turned and ran swiftly for the
fleeing horse.
</p><p>Down in the shadows the thing which had frightened the horse rose,
stumbling into shape. Flame streamed from Beck's guns toward it, but he
shot as he ran and his fire was inaccurate. He cried sharply as the
animal swung even wider in his circuit toward the gate, sprang forward
in long strides, dropped the gun from his right hand, leaped, fastened
his fingers about the horn, took two quick strides and vaulted into the
saddle.
</p><p>The animal leaped the half lowered bars and Beck fired again, twice at
the house, once at the figure outside, and then flung himself far down
over the roan's shoulder as the window belched flame and stabs of it
came from about the building and bullets screeched overhead. He fanned
the roan's belly with his hat and twenty rods further swung into an
erect position again, leaning low as they ate the road.
</p><p>"A close one, old timer!" he muttered to the horse. "<u>That</u> was a
chance!"
</p><p>And miles further on, when the roan had cooled from his first desperate
dash that had carried Tom to unquestionable safety for the night, he
said aloud:
</p><p>"Now what was <u>he</u> doin' there? And how much will he count?"
