<p>The whites found in a moment that they had committed a great
mistake in launching as they did. In the first place, there was
not an oar in the boat, and thus, not being able to "paddle their
own canoe," they were also deprived of the ability to paddle one
belonging to some one else. Besides this, the river was dark as
Styx, and the whole sky and air were of the same inky blackness,
and not one in the boat had the remotest idea of where they were
going&mdash;whether it was to pitch over some falls, down some rapids
or into the bank.</p>

<p>"I’m going to set down and consider which is the biggest fool,
Haldidge, you or me, in starting out in this canoe which we <em>borrowed</em>
for a short time."</p>

<p>So saying, Seth made his way to the stem of the canoe when he
rested himself&mdash;not upon the bottom of it, as he expected, but
upon something <em>soft</em>, which emitted a grunt audible to
all, as he did so.</p>

<p>"My gracious! what’s under me?" he exclaimed, reaching his hand
down and feeling around in the dark. "A live Injin as sure as
my name is Seth Jones. Ah, you copper-headed monkey!"</p>

<p>It was as said. An Indian had stretched out on his back with
his feet dangling over the edge of the canoe, and Seth, without
the faintest suspicion of his presence, had seated himself square
upon his breast. As may be supposed, this was not relished at
all by the startled savage, and he made several strenuous efforts
to roll him off.</p>

<p>"Now, just lay still," commanded Seth, "for I’ve an idea that
I can’t find a more comfortable seat."</p>

<p>The savage was evidently so thoroughly frightened that he ceased
his efforts and lay perfectly quiet and motionless.</p>

<p>"Have you got a real Indian here?" asked Haldidge, as he came
to Seth.</p>

<p>"To be sure I have; just feel under me and see if I hain’t."</p>

<p>"What you going to do with him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Are you going to let him off? Let’s pitch him overboard."</p>

<p>"No, you won’t, Haldidge. I’ve two or three good reasons for
not doing such a thing. In the first place, there ain’t no need
of it, the poor imp hasn’t hurt us; and, for all I detest his
whole cowardly race, I don’t believe in killing them except when
they’ve done you some injury or are trying to. The most important
reason, however, is that I don’t want my seat disturbed."</p>

<p>"He is a cussed fool to let you sit on him that way. I’d give
you a toss if I was in his place that would send you overboard."</p>

<p>"Not if you knew what was best for you. Thunder!"</p>

<p>Perhaps the Indian understood the words of the hunter. At any
rate, he made an attempt to carry out his suggestion, and well
nigh did it, too. Just as Seth gave vent to the exclamation recorded,
he pitched headlong against Haverland, knocking him over upon
his back, and falling upon him. At the same instant the savage
sprang overboard and swam rapidly away in the darkness.</p>

<p>"That’s a mean trick," said Seth, as he recovered his sitting
position, "I was just setting on him to keep the rain off. Jest
like the ungrateful dog!"</p>

<p>The attention of all was now directed to the progress of the
canoe. Drifting swiftly onward through the darkness, no one knowing
whither, their situation began to assume a terrible form. There
was no power in their hands to guide it, and should they run into
any of the trees which had caught in the bottom, or upon a rock,
they would be instantly swamped. But there was no help for it
and each one seated and braced himself for the shock which might
come at any instant.</p>

<p>It was while they were proceeding in this manner, that they all
heard the bottom of the canoe grate over something, then tremble
for a moment, and suddenly came to a stand still. The stem swung
rapidly round and commenced filling.</p>

<p>"Overboard men, all of you! We’re sinking!" commanded Haldidge.</p>

<p>Each sprang into the water which was not more than two feet deep,
and the canoe, thus lightened of its load, instantly freed itself
and floated off in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Don’t move till I take a few soundings," said Seth.</p>

<p>He naturally supposed that to reach the shore, he must take a
direction at right angles with the current. A few steps showed
him that he was not in the river itself, but was walking in that
portion which had overflowed its banks.</p>

<p>"Follow on boys; we’re right!" he called out.</p>

<p>Bushes and grass entangled their feet, and the branches overhead
brushed their faces as they toiled out of the water. A few moments
and they were upon solid land again. The canoe had carried them
across the river, so that this troublesome task was finished.</p>

<p>"Now if we only had a fire," said Haverland.</p>

<p>"Yes; for Ina must be suffering."</p>

<p>"Oh! don’t think of me!" replied the brave, little girl, cheerfully.</p>

<p>Seth discovered with his customary shrewdness that the storm
had been very slight in this section, and the wood was comparatively
dry. By removing the leaves upon the surface of the ground, there
were others beneath which were perfectly free from dampness. A
quantity of these were thrown in a heap, a number of twigs found
among them, placed upon the top, and some larger branches piled
upon these in turn. After great difficulty, Seth managed to catch
a spark from his steel and tinder, and in a few moments they had
a rousing, roaring genial fire.</p>

<p>"That’s fine," said Graham. "But won’t it be dangerous, Seth?"</p>

<p>"Let it be then, I’m bound to dry my skin to night if there’s
any vartue in fire."</p>

<p>But the Indians didn’t choose to disturb them, although it was
rather a reckless proceeding upon their part. It was more than
probable, as Seth Jones remarked, that their pursuers had lost
their trail, and would experience some difficulty in regaining
and following it.</p>

<p>Morning at last broke upon the hungry, miserable, hopeful fugitives.
As the light increased they looked about them and discovered that
they had encamped at the base of a large, heavily wooded hill.
It was also noticed that Haldidge, the hunter, was absent. While
wondering at this, the report of his rifle was heard, and in a
few moments he was seen descending the hill, bending under the
weight of a half-grown deer. This was hastily dressed, several
good-sized pieces skewered and cooked in the flame, and our five
friends made as hearty and substantial a meal as was ever made
in this world.</p>

<p>"Before starting upon our journey again," said Haldidge, "I want
you all to go to the top of the hill here with me and see what
a fine view we shall have."</p>

<p>"Oh! we’ve no time for views!" replied Seth.</p>

<p>"I am afraid there is little spare time," added the woodman.
"But this is particularly fine, and I think you will be well pleased
with it."</p>

<p>The hunter was so urgent that the others were finally obliged
to consent. Accordingly they commenced the ascent, Haldidge leading
them, and all anxiety, smiles, and expectation.</p>

<p>"See how you like that view!" said he, pointing off to the west.</p>

<p>The fugitives gazed in the direction indicated. The prospect
was one indeed which, just at that time, pleased them more than
could have any other in the universe; for below them about half
a mile distant, was the very village toward which they had been
so long making their way. It looked unusually beautiful that morning
in the clear sunshine. A score of cabins nestled closely together,
and the heavy smoke was lazily ascending from several chimneys,
while here and there a settler could be seen moving about. At
one corner of the village stood the block-house, and the gaping
mouth of its swivel shone in the morning sun like burnished silver.
One or two small boats were visible in the water, their ashen
paddles flashing brightly as they were dipped by strong and active
hands. The river down which the woodman and his wife and sisters
had escaped, flowed at the foot of the village, and its windings
could be traced by the eye for miles. Here and there, scattered
over the country for miles could be seen an enterprising settler’s
cabin, resembling in the distance a tiny bee-hive.</p>

<p>"You haven’t told me how you are pleased with the landscape?"
said the hunter.</p>

<p>"Ah, Haldidge, you know better than to ask that question," replied
Haverland in a shaking voice. "Thank God that He has been so merciful
to us!"</p>

<p>They now commenced descending the hill. Not a word was exchanged
between them, for their hearts were too full for attendance. A
strange spell seemed to have come over Seth Jones. At sight of
the village, he had suddenly become thoughtful and silent, refusing
even to answer a question. His head was bent down. Evidently his
mind was engrossed upon some all-absorbing subject. Several times
he sighed deeply, and pressed his hand to his heart, as though
the tumultuous throbbing there pained him. The expression of his
face was wonderfully changed. That quizzing, comical look was
entirely gone, while wrinkles at the eyebrows and base of the
nose could be seen no more. His face appeared positively handsome.
It was a wonderful metamorphosis, and the question passed around
unexpressed: "is that Seth Jones?"</p>

<p>All at once, he seemed to become sensible that the eyes of others
were upon him, and that he had forgotten himself. That old, peculiar
expression came back to his face, and a few steps of the old straddling
gait were taken, and Seth Jones was himself again!</p>

<p>The sentinels in the block-house had discovered and recognized
the fugitives, and when they arrived at the palisade which surrounded
the village, there were numbers waiting to receive them.</p>

<p>"I will see you all again!" said Haldidge, separating from the
others and passing toward the upper end of the settlement.</p>

<p>After pausing a few moments to answer the inquiries of their
friends, Haverland led the way toward the cabin where he had left
his wife and sister. Here he found the good settlers had erected
and presented him with a house. As he stepped softly to the door,
intending to give his wife a playful surprise, she met him. With
a low cry of joy, she sprang forward and was held in his arms,
and the next instant she and Ina were clasped together and weeping.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven! thank Heaven! Oh, my dear, dear child, I thought
you lost forever."</p>

<p>Graham and Seth stood respectfully to one side for a few moments.
The latter cleared his throat several times and brushed his arm
across his forehead in a suspicious manner. As the mother regained
herself, she turned and recognized Graham, and greeted him warmly.</p>

<p>"And you, too," she said, taking Seth’s hand and looking up into
his face, "have been more than a friend to us. May Heaven reward
you, for <em>we</em> never can."</p>

<p>"There! by gracious! don’t say no more!&mdash;boohoo! ahem! I believe
I’ve caught a cold being so exposed to the night air!"</p>

<p>But it was no use; the tears <em>would</em> come; and Seth, for
a few seconds, wept like a baby, yet smiled even through his tears.
They all entered the house.</p>

<p>"Our first duty is to thank God for his mercy. Let us all do
it," said the woodman.</p>

<p>All sank devoutly upon their knees, joining in fervent thanksgiving
to the great Being who had shown his goodness to them in such
a marvellous manner.</p>

<p>The settlers, with true politeness of heart, forebore to intrude
until they judged the family were desirous of seeing them. After
they had arisen from their knees, Mary, the sister of Haverland,
entered. Graham chanced to glance at Seth that moment, and was
startled at the emotion he exhibited. He flushed scarlet, and
trembled painfully, but, by a strong effort recovered himself
in time to greet her. She thanked him again and commenced conversing,
when she saw that he was embarrassed and ill at ease. A flash
of suspicion crossed her fine calm face, and it became pale and
flushed by turns. What a riot emotion was making in her heart
only she herself knew:&mdash;her face soon became passive and pensive;
and a pathos gleamed from her sad eyes which sent Seth quickly
out of doors to commune with the mysteries of his own thoughts.</p>

<p>The cabin was crowded until near midnight with congratulating
friends. Prominent among these, was the man who officiated in
the capacity of minister for the settlement. He was a portly,
genial, good-natured man, of the Methodist persuasion, and a preacher
for the times&mdash;one who could plow, reap, chop wood, and lead the
settlers against their foes when he deemed it necessary, or preach
and practice the gospel before them.</p>

<p>It was a glad&mdash;a happy reunion&mdash;a night that was long remembered.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>Just one week after the reunion, the little party was seated
in Haverland’s home, composed of Ina, Seth Jones, the woodman,
Mrs. Haverland, and Mary. Seth sat in one corner conversing with
Ina, while the other three were also together. There was a happy
look upon each face. Even the sweet melancholy beauty of Mary
was lightened up by a smile. She was beautiful&mdash;queenly so. Her
hair, black as night, was gathered behind, as if to restrain its
tendency to curl; but in spite of this, a refractory one was constantly
intruding itself. A faint color was visible in her cheeks, and
her blue eye had in it something of a gleam of the common joy
and peace.</p>

<p>Seth had remained most of the time with the woodman. Several
times he had asked Mary Haverland to walk with him, and yet, upon
each occasion, when about to start, he become painfully nervous
and begged to be excused. And then his language was so different
at times. Often he would converse with words so polished and well
chosen, as to show unmistakably that he was a scholar. Perhaps
the reader has noticed this discrepancy in his conversations.
It attracted attention, and strengthened many in their belief
that for some unknown reason he was playing a part.</p>

<p>At the present time, there was a nervousness in his manner; and,
although he was holding a playful conversation with Ina, his eyes
were constantly wandering to the face of Mary Haverland.</p>

<p>"And so you and Graham are going to be married to-morrow night?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"You know, Seth, that we are. How many times are you going to
ask me?"</p>

<p>"Do you love him?" he asked, looking her steadily in the face.</p>

<p>"What a question! I have <em>always</em> loved him, and <em>always
will</em>."</p>

<p>"That’s right; then marry him, for if man ever loved woman, he
loves you! And, Alf; while I think of it," he spoke in a louder
tone, "what has that big, red-haired fellow been hanging around
here so much, for the last day or two?"</p>

<p>"You will have to ask Mary," laughed the woodman.</p>

<p>"Oh! I understand; there’ll be two weddings to-morrow night,
eh? That’s so, Mary?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of; I have no expectation of becoming a wife
for any one."</p>

<p>"Hain’t eh? Why the man seems to love you. Why don’t you marry
him?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid Mary will never marry," said Haverland. "She has
rejected all offers, though many were from very desirable men."</p>

<p>"Queer! I never heard of such a case."</p>

<p>"Her love was buried long ago," replied Haverland, in a lower
tone, to Seth.</p>

<p>After a moment’s silence, Seth arose, took his chair, and seated
himself beside her. She did not look at him, nor did any one else.
He sat a moment; then whispered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mary?"</p>

<p>She started. Her eyes flashed like meteors in his face a moment;
then she turned as pale as death, and would have fallen from her
chair, had not Seth caught her in his arms. Haverland looked up
in amazement; the whole family were riveted in wonder. Seth looked
up from the face of the fainting woman, and smiled as he said:
"She is mine, forever!"</p>

<p>"Merciful heaven! Eugene Morton!" exclaimed Haverland, starting
to his feet.</p>

<p>"It is so!" said the one addressed.</p>

<p>"Have you risen from the dead?"</p>

<p>"I have risen to life, Alf, but have never been with the dead."</p>

<p>Instead of the weak, squeaking tone which had heretofore characterized
his speech, was now a rich, mellow bass, whose tones startled
Mary into life again. She raised her head, but he who held her,
would not permit her to arise. He pressed her fervently to his
bosom. The ecstasy of that moment, only the angels in heaven could
fathom.</p>

<p>Haldidge and Graham entered, and the man in his true character,
arose to his feet&mdash;a tall, dignified, graceful, imposing person.</p>

<p>"Where is Seth?" asked Graham, not noticing the apparent stranger.</p>

<p>"Here is what you have heretofore supposed to be that individual,"
laughed the person before him, enjoying greatly their astonishment.</p>

<p>"Seth, truly, but not Seth, either," exclaimed they both, with
astonishment written on their faces.</p>

<p>"With a few words," he commenced, "all will be plain to you.
I need not tell you, friends, that my character, since my advent
among you, has been an assumed one. Seth Jones is a myth, and
to <em>my</em> knowledge, no such person ever existed. My real
name is Eugene Morton. Ten years ago, Mary Haverland and I pledged
our love to each other. We were to be married in one year; but,
when a few months of that time had elapsed, the Revolutionary
War broke out, and a call was made upon our little village, in
New Hampshire, for volunteers. I had no desire, nor right to refuse.
Our little company proceeded to Massachusetts, where the war was
then raging. In a skirmish, a few days after the battle of Bunker
Hill, I was dangerously wounded, and was left with a farmer by
the wayside. I sent word by one of my comrades to Mary, that I
was disabled, but hoped to see her in a short time. The bearer
of that message probably was killed, for it is certain, my words
never reached her; though a very different report, did. We had
a man in our company, who was a lover of Mary’s. Knowing of my
misfortune, he sent her word that I was killed. When I rejoined
my company, a few months after, I learned that this man had deserted.
A suspicion that he had returned home, impelled me to obtain leave
of absence to visit my native place. I there learned that Haverland,
with his wife and sister, had left the village for the West. One
of my friends informed me that this deserter had gone with them,
and, it was understood, would marry Mary. I could not doubt the
truth of this report, and, for a time, I feared I should commit
suicide. To soften this great sorrow, I returned at once, joined
our company, and plunged into every battle that I possibly could.
I often purposely exposed myself to danger, soliciting death rather
than life. In the winter of 1776, I found myself under General
Washington, at Trenton; I had crossed the Delaware with him, and,
by the time it was fairly light, we were engaged in a desperate
fight with the Hessians. In the very heat of the battle, the thought
suddenly came to me, that the story of Mary’s marriage was untrue.
Singularly enough, when the battle was over, I did not think any
more of it. But in the midst of the following engagement at Princeton,
the same thought came to me again, and haunted me from that time,
until the close of the war. I determined to seek out Mary. All
that I could learn, was, that Haverland had emigrated ‘out this
way.’ If she <em>had</em> married the deserter, I knew it was
under a firm belief that I was dead. Consequently I had no right
to pain her by my presence. For this reason, I assumed a disguise.
I discolored my now long untamed hair. It so changed my whole
appearance, that I hardly knew myself. My youthful color was now
changed into the bronze of war, and sorrow had wrought its changes.
It was not strange then, that any old friend should not know me,
particularly when I could so successfully personate the ‘Green
Mountain Boy,’ in voice and manner. My identity was perfectly
secure, I knew, from detection. I came in this section, and after
a long and persevering hunt, one day I found Haverland cutting
in the wood. I introduced myself to him as Seth Jones. I found
Mary. The report which had reached me of her marriage was false,
she was still true to her first love! I should have made myself
known then, had not the danger which threatened Haverland, come
upon him almost immediately. As his family were then tormented
by the fate of Ina, I thought my recognition would only serve
to embarrass and distract their actions. Besides, I felt some
amusement in the part I was playing, and often enjoyed the speculation
I created, by giving you, as it were, a glimpse now and then into
my real nature, I varied my actions and language, on purpose to
increase your wonder." He here paused and smiled, as if at the
recollection of his numerous ludicrous escapades. He continued:
"I have little more to add. I congratulate you, Graham, on the
prize you have won. You are to be married to-morrow night. Mary,
will you not marry me at the same time?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the radiant woman, placing her hands in his. "You
have my hand now, as you have had my heart through all these long,
sorrowing years."</p>

<p>Morton kissed her forehead tenderly.</p>

<p>"Now, congratulate <em>me</em>," said he, with a beaming face.</p>

<p>And they gathered around him, and such shaking of hands, and
such greetings, we venture to say, were never seen before. Our
friends experienced some difficulty at first, in believing that
Seth Jones was gone forever. They even felt some regrets that
his pleasing, eccentric face had passed away; but, they had gained
in his place, a handsome, noble-hearted man, of whom they were
all proud.</p>

<p>The next day was spent in preparations for the great double wedding
that was to take place that evening. Messengers were sent up and
down the river, and back into the woods, there was not a settler
within twenty miles, who had not been invited. At nightfall, the
company began to collect. Some came in boats, some on horseback,
and others on foot. A double wedding rarely took place in the
backwoods, and while this occasion was too full of romance to
be slighted by any, old or young.</p>

<p>When the lights were produced in the woodman’s house, there was
a motley assemblage without and within. You could have heard old
and middle-aged men talking about the prospect of the crops, and
looking up to the sky, and wisely predicating the probabilities
of a change in the weather, or discussing, in anxious tones, the
state of feeling among the Indians along the frontier; you could
have heard&mdash;as they would be termed now-a-days&mdash;"gawky" young
men as sagely discoursing upon the same subjects, venturing a
playful thrust now and then, at one of their number about some
"Alminy," or "Serapheemy," sweetheart.</p>

<p>The woodman’s house had been much enlarged for the occasion.
A long shed amply sufficient to contain all the guests, was built
alongside, and connecting with it. After participating in a bountiful
meal in this, the tables were removed, and preparation made for
the marriage.</p>

<p>A sudden hush fell upon the assemblage. All eyes turned toward
the door, through which Eugene Morton and Edward Graham, each
with his affianced leaning upon his arm entered.</p>

<p>"Ain’t they purty?"</p>

<p>"Don’t they look bootiful?"</p>

<p>"Golly! if they ain’t <em>some</em>, then there’s no use in talking!"</p>

<p>Such and similar were the whispered remarks of admiration at
the couple. Mary Haverland was dressed in a plain, light colored
dress, without any ornament, except a single white rose in her
hair, which now fell in dark masses over her shoulders. Her beauty
was of the truly regal type. She was very happy, yet seemed as
if in a world of her own.</p>

<p>Horton was clad in gray homespun, which well became his graceful
form. His whole appearance was that of the <em>gentleman</em>,
which he was&mdash;a brave soldier, a true-hearted man.</p>

<p>Ina, the sweet, young heroine, was fascinating. Her dress was
of the purest white. Her curls clustered around her shoulders,
and were confined at the temples by a simple wreath of blue violets.
There was a contrast between Ina and Mary, and yet it would have
been a difficult task to have judged which was the most beautiful&mdash;the
pure, queenly, trusting woman, or the purity and innocence of
the young maiden. Graham was a worthy participant in the drama,
and pleased all by his goodness and intelligence.</p>

<p>In a few moments, a portly gentleman, with a white neckcloth,
and all aglow with smiles, entered the room. Morton and Mary arose
and stood before him, and amid the most perfect silence the ceremony
commenced. The questions were put and answered in a firm voice,
audible to every one in the room.</p>

<p>"What God hath joined together let not man put asunder."</p>

<p>And every voice said "Amen!" as they reseated themselves.</p>

<p>Haldidge, who had stood as groomsman to Morton, now signaled
with a quiet smile for Graham to take his position. The young
hero did, and Ina, blushing deeply, and leaning on the arm of
her bridemaid, followed, and the ceremony commenced.</p>

<p>While this was proceeding, an interesting affair was occurring
on the opposite end of the room. A large, bony, red-faced young
man, sat holding and squeezing the hand of a bouncing buxom girl,
and indulging in several expressive remarks.</p>

<p>"I swow, if they don’t look purty. Wonder how the gal feels?"</p>

<p>"Why happy, of course," replied his companion.</p>

<p>"By jingo, I bet <em>he</em> does; I know <em>I</em> would."</p>

<p>"You would what?"</p>

<p>"Feel glorious if I was in <em>his</em> place."</p>

<p>"What! marrying Ina Haverland?"</p>

<p>"No &mdash;I mean&mdash;ahem!&mdash;why, somebody else&mdash;that is&mdash;yes, <em>somebody</em>
else."</p>

<p>"Who else do you mean?" asked the girl, looking him steadily
in the face.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;ahem!&mdash;why, <em>you</em>! darn it, now you know, don’t
you?"</p>

<p>"Sh! Don’t talk so loud, Josiah, or they’ll hear you."</p>

<p>"S’posen you was in her place, Sal; how <em>would</em> you feel?"</p>

<p>"Ain’t you ashamed of yourself?" she asked reprovingly.</p>

<p>"No, darnation, I don’t care. Say, Sal, how would you feel?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean if I was standing out there with you, and the minister
talking so to us?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes; why don’t you tell me?"</p>

<p>"You know well enough, Josiah, without asking me no such question."</p>

<p>Josiah commenced meditating. Some desperate scheme was evidently
troubling him, for he scratched his head and then his knees, and
then laughed, and exclaimed to himself, "I’ll do it, by George!"
Then turning toward the girl, he said:</p>

<p>"Sal, let’s you and I get married, won’t you?"</p>

<p>"Why, Josiah?" and she hung her head and blushed charmingly.</p>

<p>"Come, Sal, the old folks won’t care. Let’s do it, won’t you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Josiah!" she continued, growing nervous and fidgety.</p>

<p>"Come, say quick, for the dominie is near done, and he’ll go
home. Say <em>yes</em>; Sal, do."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! oh, my stars! &mdash;<em>YES</em>!"</p>

<p>"Good, by jingo! Hurry up there, Mr. Preacher."</p>

<p>At this point, the good minister ceased his benediction upon
the couples, and their friends commenced crowding around them.
The minister started, not to go home, but to leave the room for
a moment, when Josiah noticed it, and fearing that he was going
called out:</p>

<p>"Say, squire&mdash;you, dominie, I mean, just wait, won’t you here’s
another job for you."</p>

<p>"Ah! I am glad to hear it!" laughed the minister, turning round.
"Are you the happy man?"</p>

<p>"Wal, I reckon so, and I cac’late as how, Sal Clayton there is
the happy gal."</p>

<p>All eyes were turned toward the speaker, and he stood their smiles
unflinchingly. His face was of a fiery red, and a large, flowing
necktie hung disregarded over his breast.</p>

<p>"Go in, Josiah; that’s you!" exclaimed several patting him on
the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Get out all of you, till I’m through. Come up here, Sal; no
use scroochin’ now."</p>

<p>The females bore the blushing one forward, until she was near
enough for Josiah to get hold of her hand.</p>

<p>"Now go ahead, squire&mdash;you&mdash;minister, I mean, and don’t be too
thundering long about it, for I want to get married most terribly."</p>

<p>The company gave way, and the two stepped forward, and in a few
moments were pronounced man and wife. When Josiah saluted his
bride, the smack was a telling one, and the congratulations of
Morton and Graham were nothing to those which were showered upon
the happy man.</p>

<p>Now the sport commenced. An old ranger suddenly made his appearance,
bearing a violin under his arm&mdash;"a reg’lar old cremony," as he
termed it. The word was given to "make ready for the dance!" The
old folks disappeared and entered the house, where, with the minister,
they indulged in conversation, story-telling, nuts, apples, and
cider.</p>

<p>The fiddler coiled himself upon the top of a box, and commenced
twisting the screws of his instrument, and thumbing the strings.
The operation of "tuning" was evidently a painful one, for it
was noticed that at each turn of the screw, he shut one eye and
twisted his mouth.</p>

<p>The violin was at length tuned, the bow was given two or three
sweeps across a lump of rosin, and then drawn across the strings,
as if it said "attention!" As the couples were forming, the violinist
slid partly down off the box, so that one foot could beat upon
the sanded floor, and then, giving his head a jerk backward, struck
up a reel that fairly set every heart dancing. The floor was immediately
filled with the young folks. Tall, strapping fellows plunged around
the room, like skeletons of india-rubber, their legs bowed out,
and sometimes tripping over each other. Rousing, solid girls bounded
around, up and down like pots of jelly, and "all went merry as
a marriage-bell."</p>

<p>By and by the old folks made their appearance "just to see the
boys and gals enjoy themselves." The fiddler at this moment shot
off on the "Devil’s Dream." A timid elderly lady stepped up to
him, and touching him softly on the shoulder, asked:</p>

<p>"Isn’t that a <em>profane</em> tune?"</p>

<p>"No, it’s Old Hundredth with variations&mdash;don’t bother me," replied
the performer, relieving his mouth of a quantity of tobacco juice
at the same time.</p>

<p>"Supposing we try it for a moment, aunt Hannah," said the minister
with a sly look.</p>

<p>The two stepped out on the floor, the fiddler commenced another
tune, and they disappeared in the whirling mass. In a few moments
nearly all of the old folks who had come just to "see them a minute,"
followed, and the way in which several elderly gentlemen and ladies
executed some of the reels of a half-century’s memory, was a lesson
to the younger folks.</p>

<p>The company kept up their revelry until far beyond midnight.
But by and by they commenced withdrawing. It was proposed by several
to visit the different bridegrooms in bed, but fortunately the
good taste of the others prevailed, and they departed quietly
homeward.</p>

<p>Slumber, with the exception of the sentinels at the block-house,
fell upon the village. Perhaps the Indians had no wish to break
in upon such a happy settlement, for they made no demonstration
through the night. Sweetly and peacefully they all slept; sweetly
and peacefully they entered upon life’s duties on the morrow;
and sweetly and peacefully these happy settlers ascend and went
down the hillside of life.</p>
