Thus it was that on the ninth day of February, at the beginning of
the thaw, this singular person fell out of infinity into Iping
Village.  Next day his luggage arrived through the slush.  And very
remarkable luggage it was.  There was a couple of trunks indeed, such
as a rational man might need, but in addition there were a box of
books,--big, fat books, of which some were just in an
incomprehensible handwriting,--and a dozen or more crates, boxes, and
cases, containing objects packed in straw, as it seemed to Hall,
tugging with a casual curiosity at the straw--glass bottles.  The
stranger, muffled in hat, coat, gloves, and wrapper, came out
impatiently to meet Fearenside's cart, while Hall was having a word
or so of gossip preparatory to helping bring them in.  Out he came,
not noticing Fearenside's dog, who was sniffing in a dilettante
spirit at Hall's legs.  "Come along with those boxes," he said.
"I've been waiting long enough."
<P>
And he came down the steps towards the tail of the cart as if to lay
hands on the smaller crate.
<P>
No sooner had Fearenside's dog caught sight of him, however, than it
began to bristle and growl savagely, and when he rushed down the
steps it gave an undecided hop, and then sprang straight at his hand.
"Whup!" cried Hall, jumping back, for he was no hero with dogs, and
Fearenside howled, "Lie down!" and snatched his whip.
<P>
They saw the dog's teeth had slipped the hand, heard a kick, saw the
dog execute a flanking jump and get home on the stranger's leg, and
heard the rip of his trousering.  Then the finer end of Fearenside's
whip reached his property, and the dog, yelping with dismay,
retreated under the wheels of the waggon.  It was all the business of
a half-minute.  No one spoke, every one shouted.  The stranger
glanced swiftly at his torn glove and at his leg, made as if he would
stoop to the latter, then turned and rushed up the steps into the
inn.  They heard him go headlong across the passage and up the
uncarpeted stairs to his bedroom.
<P>
"You brute, you!" said Fearenside, climbing off the waggon with his
whip in his hand, while the dog watched him through the wheel.  "Come
here!" said Fearenside--"You'd better."
<P>
Hall had stood gaping.  "He wuz bit," said Hall.  "I'd better go and
see to en," and he trotted after the stranger.  He met Mrs.  Hall in
the passage.  "Carrier's darg," he said, "bit en."
<P>
He went straight upstairs, and the stranger's door being ajar, he
pushed it open and was entering without any ceremony, being of a
naturally sympathetic turn of mind.
<P>
The blind was down and the room dim.  He caught a glimpse of a most
singular thing, what seemed a handless arm waving towards him, and a
face of three huge indeterminate spots on white, very like the face
of a pale pansy.  Then he was struck violently in the chest, hurled
back, and the door slammed in his face and locked, all so rapidly
that he had no time to observe.  A waving of indecipherable shapes, a
blow, and a concussion.  There he stood on the dark little landing,
wondering what it might be that he had seen.
<P>
After a couple of minutes he rejoined the little group that had
formed outside the Coach and Horses.  There was Fearenside telling
about it all over again for the second time; there was Mrs. Hall
saying his dog didn't have no business to bite her guests; there was
Huxter, the general dealer from over the road, interrogative; and
Sandy Wadgers from the forge, judicial; besides women and children,--
all of them saying fatuities: "Wouldn't let en bite me, I knows";
"'Tasn't right have such dargs"; "Whad 'e bite'n for then?" and so
forth.
<P>
Mr. Hall, staring at them from the steps and listening, found it
incredible that he had seen anything very remarkable happen upstairs.
Besides, his vocabulary was altogether too limited to express his
impressions.
<P>
"He don't want no help, he says," he said in answer to his wife's
enquiry.  "We'd better be a-takin' of his luggage in."
<P>
"He ought to have it cauterised at once," said Mr. Huxter;
"especially if it's at all inflamed."
<P>
"I'd shoot en, that's what I'd do," said a lady in the group.
<P>
Suddenly the dog began growling again.
<P>
"Come along," cried an angry voice in the doorway, and there stood
the muffled stranger with his collar turned up, and his hat-brim bent
down.  "The sooner you get those things in the better I'll be
pleased."  It is stated by an anonymous bystander that his trousers
and gloves had been changed.
<P>
"Was you hurt, sir?" said Fearenside.  "I'm rare sorry the darg--"
<P>
"Not a bit," said the stranger.  "Never broke the skin.  Hurry up
with those things."
<P>
He then swore to himself, so Mr. Hall asserts.
<P>
Directly the first crate was carried into the parlour, in accordance
with his directions, the stranger flung himself upon it with
extraordinary eagerness, and began to unpack it, scattering the straw
with an utter disregard of Mrs. Hall's carpet.  And from it he began
to produce bottles--little fat bottles containing powders, small and
slender bottles containing coloured and white fluids, fluted blue
bottles labelled Poison, bottles with round bodies and slender necks,
large green-glass bottles, large white-glass bottles, bottles with
glass stoppers and frosted labels, bottles with fine corks, bottles
with bungs, bottles with wooden caps, wine bottles, salad-oil
bottles--putting them in rows on the chiffonier, on the mantel, on
the table under the window, round the floor, on the book-shelf--
everywhere.  The chemist's shop in Bramblehurst could not boast half
so many.  Quite a sight it was.  Crate after crate yielded bottles,
until all six were empty and the table high with straw; the only
things that came out of these crates besides the bottles were a
number of test-tubes and a carefully packed balance.
<P>
And directly the crates were unpacked, the stranger went to the
window and set to work, not troubling in the least about the litter
of straw, the fire which had gone out, the box of books outside, nor
for the trunks and other luggage that had gone upstairs.
<P>
When Mrs. Hall took his dinner in to him, he was already so absorbed
in his work, pouring little drops out of the bottles into test-tubes,
that he did not hear her until she had swept away the bulk of the
straw and put the tray on the table, with some little emphasis
perhaps, seeing the state that the floor was in.  Then he half turned
his head and immediately turned it away again.  But she saw he had
removed his glasses; they were beside him on the table, and it seemed
to her that his eye sockets were extraordinarily hollow.  He put on
his spectacles again, and then turned and faced her.  She was about
to complain of the straw on the floor when he anticipated her.
<P>
"I wish you wouldn't come in without knocking," he said in the tone
of abnormal exasperation that seemed so characteristic of him.
<P>
"I knocked, but seemingly--"
<P>
"Perhaps you did.  But in my investigations--my really very urgent
and necessary investigations--the slightest disturbance, the jar of a
door--I must ask you--"
<P>
"Certainly, sir.  You can turn the lock if you're like that, you
know--any time."
<P>
"A very good idea," said the stranger.
<P>
"This stror, sir, if I might make so bold as to remark--"
<P>
"Don't.  If the straw makes trouble put it down in the bill."  And he
mumbled at her--words suspiciously like curses.
<P>
He was so odd, standing there, so aggressive and explosive, bottle in
one hand and test-tube in the other, that Mrs. Hall was quite
alarmed.  But she was a resolute woman.  "In which case, I should
like to know, sir, what you consider--"
<P>
"A shilling.  Put down a shilling.  Surely a shilling's enough?"
<P>
"So be it," said Mrs. Hall, taking up the tablecloth and beginning to
spread it over the table.  "If you're satisfied, of course--"
<P>
He turned and sat down, with his coat-collar towards her.
<P>
All the afternoon he worked with the door locked and, as Mrs.  Hall
testifies, for the most part in silence.  But once there was a
concussion and a sound of bottles ringing together as though the
table had been hit, and the smash of a bottle flung violently down,
and then a rapid pacing athwart the room.  Fearing "something was the
matter," she went to the door and listened, not caring to knock.
<P>
"I can't go on," he was raving.  "I can't go on.  Three hundred
thousand, four hundred thousand!  The huge multitude!  Cheated!  All
my life it may take me!  Patience!  Patience indeed!  Fool and liar!"
<P>
There was a noise of hobnails on the bricks in the bar, and Mrs. Hall
very reluctantly had to leave the rest of his soliloquy.  When she
returned the room was silent again, save for the faint crepitation of
his chair and the occasional clink of a bottle.  It was all over.
The stranger had resumed work.
<P>
When she took in his tea she saw broken glass in the corner of the
room under the concave mirror, and a golden stain that had been
carelessly wiped.  She called attention to it.
<P>
"Put it down in the bill," snapped her visitor.  "For God's sake
don't worry me.  If there's damage done, put it down in the bill";
and he went on ticking a list in the exercise book before him.
<P>
"I'll tell you something," said Fearenside mysteriously.  It was late
in the afternoon, and they were in the little beer-shop of Iping
Hanger.
<P>
"Well?" said Teddy Henfrey.
<P>
"This chap you're speaking of, what my dog bit.  Well--he's black.
Leastways, his legs are.  I seed through the tear of his glove.
You'd have expected a sort of pinky to show, wouldn't you?
Well--there wasn't none.  Just blackness.  I tell you, he's as black
as my hat."
<P>
"My sakes!" said Henfrey.  "It's a rummy case altogether.  Why, his
nose is as pink as paint!"
<P>
"That's true," said Fearenside.  "I knows that.  And I tell 'ee what
I'm thinking.  That marn's a piebald, Teddy.  Black here and white
there--in patches.  And he's ashamed of it.  He's a kind of
half-breed, and the colour's come off patchy instead of mixing.  I've
heard of such things before.  And it's the common way with horses, as
anyone can see."
