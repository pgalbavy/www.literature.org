<p>Johnny Chuck is naturally lazy. You see, Johnny has very simple
tastes and usually he is contented. He does not have to go far
from his own doorstep to get all he wants to eat. He does not
have to hunt for his food, as so many of the little meadow and
forest people do, and so he has a great deal of time to sit on
his doorstep and watch the world go by and dream pleasant daydreams
and grow fat. Now people who do not have to work usually become
lazy. It is the easiest habit in the world to learn and the hardest
to get over. And so, because he seldom has to work, Johnny Chuck
quite naturally is lazy.</p>

<p>But Johnny can work when there really is need of it. No one,
unless it is Digger the Badger or Miner the Mole, can dig faster
than Johnny Chuck. And when there is real need of working, Johnny
works with a will. When he was a very tiny Chuck, old Mother Chuck
had taught him this:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"When work there is that must be done<br/>
&nbsp;Don't fret and whine and spoil the day!<br/>
&nbsp;The quicker that you do your work<br/>
&nbsp;The longer time you'll have to play."

</p>
</div>
<p>Johnny never has forgotten this, and when it is really necessary
that he should work, no one works harder than he does. But he
always first makes sure that it is necessary work and that he
will not be wasting his time in doing foolish, unnecessary things.</p>

<p>And now Johnny Chuck was the busiest he had ever been in all
his life. If he felt lazy these beautiful spring days, he didn't
have time to think about it. No, Sir, he actually didn't have
time to remember that he is naturally lazy. You see, he had a
family to look out for&mdash;three babies to find sweet, tender young
clover for and to teach all the things that every Chuck should
know, and to watch out for, that no harm should come to them.
So Johnny Chuck was busy, so busy that he hardly had time to get
enough to eat.</p>

<p>Every morning Johnny would come out as soon as jolly, round,
red Mr. Sun began his daily climb up in the blue, blue sky. He
would look this way and look that way to make sure that Reddy
Fox or Granny Fox or Redtail the Hawk or Bowser the Hound or any
other danger was nowhere near. And he never forgot to look up
in the apple-trees to make sure that Sammy Jay was not there.
Then he would call to Polly Chuck and the three baby Chucks.</p>

<p>Polly Chuck would come out with a very worried air, and after
her would come the three funny little baby Chucks, who would roll
and tumble over each other on the doorstep. When he thought they
had played enough, Johnny Chuck would lead the way along a little
private path which he had made through the grass. After him, one
behind another, would trot the three little Chucks, and behind
them would march Polly Chuck, to see that none went astray.</p>

<p>When they reached the patch of tender, sweet, young clover, Johnny
Chuck would sit up very straight and still, watching as sharp
as he knew how for the least sign of danger. When the three little
stomachs were full of sweet, tender, young clover, he would proudly
lead the way home again, and then as before he would sit up very
straight and watch for danger, while the three baby Chucks sprawledout
on the doorstep for a sun-nap.</p>

<p>Oh, those were busy days for Johnny Chuck, and anxious days,
too! You see he had not forgotten that Sammy Jay had found out
his secret, and he hadn't the least doubt in the world that Sammy
Jay would tell Reddy Fox. So, from the first thing in the morning
until the very last thing at night, Johnny Chuck was on the watch
for danger.</p>

<p>And all the time, though Johnny didn't know it, a pair of sharp
eyes were watching him from a snug hiding-place in one of the
old apple-trees. Whose were they? Why, Sammy Jay's, to be sure.
You see, Sammy Jay hadn't told Johnny Chuck's great secret, after
all.</p>
