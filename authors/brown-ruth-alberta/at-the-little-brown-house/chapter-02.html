<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>"Are you ready, Cherry?"</p>

<p>"Almost," came the muffled reply from the stiffly-starched little
figure sitting on the floor struggling with a broken shoe-string.
"Why, Peace, where are <em>you</em> going?"</p>

<p>"Where do you s'pose? To the reception, of course," answered
that young lady, who had just entered the room, rigged out in
an ancient, faded pink gown which had once been pretty, but was
long since outgrown so that several inches of petticoat hung in
display the whole way around the skirt, and the ruffs on the sleeves
reached almost to the elbow. How she had ever squeezed herself
inside the small garment was beyond comprehension, but there she
stood, buttoned up and breathless, ready for the evening's social
event.</p>

<p>"Did Faith say you could go, and where in creation did you find
that ridiculous old dress?" demanded Cherry, after an astonished
survey of the grotesque figure in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Faith doesn't have anything to say about it," was the emphatic
retort, as the brown eyes snapped indignantly at her sister's
criticism. "Didn't mother promise I could go to the next reception
that the church had, and ain't this the next? Faith kept me home
from Mr. Kane's farewell, but she can't make me stay away tonight."</p>

<p>"Gail isn't going&mdash;" began Cherry, scenting the storm which was
sure to follow this declaration from her younger sister; but Peace
interrupted, "I am going just the same. Mother said I could!"</p>

<p>"Have you asked her about it today?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't. She promised a long time ago, but it was a sure
enough promise, and she always keeps her promises."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There ain't any 'but' about it. I'm going even if I have to
walk all by myself. I'm 'most as big as you. Two years ain't much
difference! Faith never kicks about your going, but she always
tries to make me stay at home. She won't this time, though." The
shapely little head shook so vigorously that each tight ring of
short, brown hair bobbed emphatically.</p>

<p>"But you <em>can't</em> go in that dress," remonstrated Cherry,
still staring at the abbreviated gown and neglecting her own preparations.
"It is hardly big enough for Allee any more. You've had that for
three or four years."</p>

<p>"It's the only thing I could find. My white one is <em>all</em>
worn out, and that ugly green gingham has a long tear on the side
which Gail hasn't mended yet."</p>

<p>"But what will Faith say when she sees that rig? Why, Peace,
it looks awful!"</p>

<p>"I should say it did!" exclaimed a second voice from the hallway,
and Faith, a tall, brown-eyed girl of about fifteen years, entered
the door. "What in the world do you think you are doing, Peace
Greenfield?"</p>

<p>Peace blinked her somber eyes vigorously, for tears were very
near the surface, but she swallowed back the lump in her throat
and calmly answered, "I'm getting ready for the reception, same
as you."</p>

<p>"Indeed you're not! Gail isn't going, and you can stay right
here at home with her and Allee."</p>

<p>"That's what I did the last time, but you don't play that trick
on me tonight. Mother said I could go to the next reception, and
I am going."</p>

<p>"She didn't mean this kind of a reception, and you can't go."</p>

<p>"I will, I will! Oh, you are the crossest sister!" cried poor
Peace, with tears of vexation streaming down over her cheeks.
"You <em>always</em> spoil my good times! You <em>never</em> make
Cherry stay at home&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She is older&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Two years ain't much!"</p>

<p>"She knows how to behave herself."</p>

<p>"So do I! I'll be as good as gold&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've taken you on that promise before."</p>

<p>"Oh, Oh, Oh! I will go! I'm going straight to mother and ask
her now."</p>

<p>"Mother is worse tonight and can't be bothered. Stop your yelling,
or she will hear you."</p>

<p>"I want her to hear! I shall go! She said I might!" The storm
was on in all its fury.</p>

<p>"Hush!" interposed Cherry, running to her sobbing sister and
trying to soothe her wild rebellion with gentle caresses. "I will
stay home with you, Peace. I don't care much about going, anyway."</p>

<p>"You can stay at home if you want to," declared the small rebel
with emphasis, "but <em>I</em> am going!"</p>

<p>"Children, children, what is all this racket about?" asked a
gentle, grieved voice, suddenly, and the shamed-faced trio wheeled
to find the pale, little, invalid mother standing in their midst.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, mayn't I go? Faith says I can't, but you promised
me when Mr. Kane went away that I could go to the next reception
if I would make no more fuss about not going to his."</p>

<p>"So I did, dear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But a reception for a new minister is no place for such little
girls, mother," broke in Faith, petulantly.</p>

<p>"The 'nouncements said to bring the <em>babies</em>"&mdash;involuntarily
the mother smiled and the other sisters giggled. "I am lots bigger
than a baby&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't act it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Faith!" The mother's face was as reproving as her voice, and
the older girl's cheeks flushed crimson as she murmured humbly,
"I am sorry, mother; but really, she does say such awful things.
She is always talking. And just look at that dress!"</p>

<p>"I thought it would be pretty&mdash;" began Peace, but at that moment
she caught sight of her reflection in the mirror, and stopped
so abruptly, with such a comical look of dismay and despair in
her eyes, that the whole group burst out laughing. Peace joined
in their merriment, and then soberly said, "I look like a chicken
when the down is turning to feathers. What can I do about it?
I <em>can't</em> stay at home!"</p>

<p>"Where is your green dress?"</p>

<p>"Gail hasn't mended it yet."</p>

<p>Faith saw her opportunity and immediately compromised. "Peace,
if I mend your dress for you so you can go, will you sit perfectly
still all the evening and never say a word until you are spoken
to?"</p>

<p>"Yes, oh, yes, I'll promise!"</p>

<p>The mother opened her lips to speak, but thought better of it,
and with a smile in her eyes, withdrew, leaving the children to
their final preparations.</p>

<p>At length the torn dress was neatly mended and buttoned on the
wriggling owner, the bright curls were given a second brushing
and tied back with a band of pink ribbon from Faith's own treasures,
and the sisters were on their way to the mother's room for a good-bye
kiss when a fourth girl, looking very sweet in a fresh, blue gingham,
rushed excitedly up the stairs and demanded, "Where did you say
you put the cake, Faith? Gail can't find it."</p>

<p>"Why, it's on the wash-bench under the pantry window, covered
up with the big dishpan."</p>

<p>"There is nothing under the dishpan but an empty plate."</p>

<p>"Hope! You are fooling!"</p>

<p>"Cross my heart and hope to die," was the solemn answer. "Gail
looked and I looked. She says somebody must have stolen it."</p>

<p>"The tramp!" cried Faith and Cherry in one voice.</p>

<p>"Bet he didn't!" declared Peace, who had stood open-mouthed and
silent during Hope's recital. "I gave him a great big lunch and&mdash;and
some matches to make some more with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Faith, bitterly grieved over the loss of the cake,
"and kept him hanging around here all the morning, till we thought
he never was going. I suppose he took the cake for his dinner."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it! But he did weed those flower beds beau&mdash;ti&mdash;fully!"
cried Peace, championing his cause. "And he strung Hope's vines
just as even! And the lawn is all mowed, and there ain't a sprill
of grass left in the onion patch, and the rain barrel is fixed
up and the back step is mended, and&mdash;did he stop up the leaks
in the hen house? I told him just where they were."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you told him to pay for his breakfast, too," suggested
the older girl, sarcastically. "We found a half dollar under his
cup after he was gone."</p>

<p>"A sure-enough half dollar?" asked Peace, too astonished to believe
her ears.</p>

<p>"Yes, a sure-enough half dollar!"</p>

<p>"Where is it? I want to see it for myself."</p>

<p>"On the pantry shelf. Gail thought he might have left it there
by mistake and would come back after it. But I don't."</p>

<p>"Maybe he left it to pay for taking the cake," suggested Allee,
who had joined the excited group in the hall.</p>

<p>"He never took the cake," Peace asserted stoutly. "But I don't
think he will ever come back for his money, either. He wouldn't
have left it in the dishes if he hadn't meant it for us. His clothes
had pockets in them, same as any other man's, and if he had any
money, he would have kept it there and not carried it around in
his hands. Wish he would come back, though. I'd ask him about
the cake, just to show you he never took it."</p>

<p>"See here, Peace Greenfield," cried Faith, with sudden suspicion,
"do you know where that cake is?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't! How should I know? But I don't believe that tramp
took it. So there!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe he was even a tramp. Suppose he was a bad man,
who had done something terrible, and the police were after him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, or s'pose he was a prince," Peace broke in, remembering
her conversation with the gray, old man. "He might be one for
all we know, but he didn't look like a bad man."</p>

<p>"Suppose we stop supposing," laughed Hope, "and all hunt for
the cake. Someone may have hid it just for fun. We've half an
hour before we really must go to the church."</p>

<p>"I don't care to go at all if that cake is gone," declared Faith,
crossly. "Mrs. Wardlaw will begin to think I am lying to get out
of helping with refreshments if I have to make excuses again tonight."</p>

<p>"But you're on the program," protested the smaller girls.</p>

<p>"I guess maybe we will find it somewhere," said Hope. "Come on
and help." And they scattered in their search for the missing
loaf.</p>

<p>But, though they looked high and low, indoors and out, not a
trace could they find of it, except the clean, empty plate under
the dishpan; and in despair Peace climbed to her gatepost to ponder
the question of whether tramp and cake had disappeared together
or whether some local agent was the cause of its vanishing. "If
it had been a nanimal," she said, thoughtfully, "it would have
knocked the dishpan off the bench and broken the plate. It must
have been a person. I'd think it was Hec Abbott, only&mdash;mercy!
What in the world is this? Money! Sure as I'm alive!" Scrambling
down from her perch, she raced for the house, shouting, "Gail,
Faith, look what I've found, hitched to the gatepost!"</p>

<p>The five sisters ran to meet her, and into Gail's hand she thrust
a crumpled, green scrap.</p>

<p>"Ten dollars!" gasped the astonished girl, examining the dingy
bill with excited curiosity. "Someone must have lost it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And pinned it to the gatepost so's we could find it?" demanded
Peace. "Well, I guess not! Bet that tramp left it. He surely must
be a prince. What shall you do with it, Gail?"</p>

<p>"Show it to mother and ask her advice," promptly answered the
oldest girl, smiling down at the excited group of sisters; and
they hurried away to the house with the precious find&mdash;all but
Peace.</p>

<p>A wild, daring thought had suddenly sprung into her active brain,
and as her sisters vanished within doors, she flew madly up the
road through the summer twilight towards the little village, clasping
a shining half dollar tightly in her fist. In a surprisingly short
time she returned, breathless but triumphant, bearing a huge paper
sack in her arms, just as an anxious group came around the corner
of the house.</p>

<p>"Peace! Where have you been?" cried Gail in relief, as the panting
form flew in at the gate.</p>

<p>"We've been hunting all over the farm for you," added Faith,
severely.</p>

<p>"Thought you might be searching for some more money," laughed
Hope.</p>

<p>"What's in that big bag?" demanded Cherry.</p>

<p>"Cakes!" gasped Peace, proudly. "Faith said Mrs. Waddler would
be nasty if we didn't take something to eat this time, so I spent
the tramp's half dollar for some of those marshmallow cakes with
nuts on top. They are dandy good, and they cost a lot, but they
weigh light, so you get a big bag full for fifty cents. Not many
people have money enough to buy them very often, and Mrs. Waddler
can't say a word about our bringing them instead of a cake. Have
one, Gail and Allee, 'cause you aren't going to the reception.
And take one up to mother. Maybe she'd like them, too."</p>

<p>"But, Peace," Faith began, sharply, then stopped at a warning
glance from Gail, and with sudden gentleness she took the bulky
sack from the small sister's arms and started off for the church
where the reception was to be held.</p>

<p>They were somewhat late in arriving, and the little building
was already well filled with a laughing, light-hearted crowd,
gathered to welcome the new minister into their midst. Glancing
hastily about her, Faith saw one empty chair in a dim corner,
and pointing it out to Peace, she said, "Sit down over there,
and remember not to talk except when you are spoken to. Above
everything else, don't get to romping. Hope and Cherry are to
help Miss Dunbar pass the cake, so they are needed in the kitchen.
Remember, now!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will," was the unusually meek reply, and Peace obediently
curled herself up in the corner to watch proceedings, thankful
to be one of the gay company, but wistfully wishing that she might
join in the merrymaking. It wasn't so bad when the program hour
came, for everyone sat down then and listened quietly to the music
and speeches, but it was very lonely in the dim recess, where
Peace was almost hidden from sight, and she longed to have someone
to talk to. Everyone was so busy introducing themselves to the
young minister and his pretty, sprightly little wife, or gossiping
among themselves, that no one paid any attention to the somber,
brown eyes peering so eagerly from the corner.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," sighed Peace at length, "I might as well have stayed
at home like Faith said, for not a single soul has said a word
to me since I came in, and I don't s'pose I will even get a chance
to speak to the new minister. My, but he's got an awfully pretty
wife! Wish she would smile at me like that. There come the 'freshments.
Like as not they'll skip me, off here by myself. If Cherry forgets,
I'll shake her good when I get home. A piece of cake is dry eating
when all the rest have lemonade, but I'd rather have that than
nothing. There, that man is going to play again &mdash;Faith is
pulling out the stops of the organ. Doesn't he look funny?"</p>

<p>She laughed aloud at a sudden ludicrous fancy, and her laugh
was echoed so close beside her that she nearly jumped out of her
chair. Recovering herself, she whirled around to find the strong-faced
young pastor looking down at her.</p>

<p>"What do you find so funny to laugh at, hid away here in this
dark corner?" he asked, in a cheery, hearty voice, as he drew
up an old stool and sat down beside her.</p>

<p>And, forgetting her fright in the friendly glance and tone of
this new preacher, Peace giggled out, "I was just thinking s'posing
we were all grasshoppers, how funny we'd look hopping around here
instead of walking. We'd have to shake feet instead of hands,
and if we wanted to go across the room all we'd have to do would
be to take a big jump."</p>

<p>For a fraction of a second the minister was dumb with amazement
at the unexpected answer; then he threw back his head and laughed
uproariously, as he gasped, "What ever put such a thought in that
little noddle?"</p>

<p>"That man with the big fiddle," was the prompt reply. "Doesn't
he look like a grasshopper with that long-tailed coat and all
that shirt front? If he just had feelers on his head, he'd be
perfect. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>Again the young man laughed, for Peace's picture was not overdrawn&mdash;the
tall, angular cellist in evening dress certainly did resemble
a grasshopper. But, of course, it would never do for him to say
so, and he sought to turn this unusual conversation by inquiring,
"Aren't you one of the Greenfield girls? You look amazingly like
two or three who have been introduced to me this evening. Isn't
the organist a sister of yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's Faith."</p>

<p>"And the blue-eyed one just coming in the door?"</p>

<p>"That's Hope."</p>

<p>"And there is a third one here somewhere, is there not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Cherry. Her real name is Charity, but that is such a long
name for a little girl that we call her Cherry."</p>

<p>He smiled at the diminutive maiden with her grown-up air, and
said musingly, "Faith, Hope and Charity. Then you must be Mercy."</p>

<p>"Oh, mercy, no!" was the horrified exclamation. "That would be
worse than ever! I am Peace. Faith says I ought to have been called
'War and Tribulation'&mdash;it would have been more 'propriate; but
I am not to blame for my name, if it doesn't fit. I would have
been something else if I'd had my way about it. Unless babies
are named pretty names I think their folks ought to wait until
they can pick out their own names. Grandpa named me&mdash;all of us
but Gail and Allee. If I just hadn't been born for two weeks longer
maybe I'd have had a pretty name, too, for grandpa died when I
was only thirteen days old. You see, grandpa was a minister&mdash;papa
used to be a minister, too&mdash;and he never had any other children
but papa, so he didn't get a chance to do much naming in his own
family. Papa named Gail; her real name is Abigail. And then grandpa
came to live with us. He liked Bible names, so the rest of us
were picked out of the Bible&mdash;except Allee, and she wasn't born
then. Mamma named her."</p>

<p>She paused for breath, and the amused, amazed preacher found
opportunity to murmur, politely, "But I am sure you all have good
names&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they are good enough! The trouble is, they don't fit,
except Hope's. She is our sunbeam, always doing and saying something
pretty, and <em>meaning</em> it, too. Now, Gail isn't a gale at
all, but just the bestest kind of a sister; while Faith is usu'lly
cross as two sticks unless things go just as she wants them; and
Cherry doesn't stand around on corners d'livering <em>tracks</em>
and worn-out clo's to the needy poor, like Charity always does
in the pictures. But mine is the worst misfit. Still, I'm thankful
it isn't any worse. Just s'posing I had Irene for a middle name&mdash;that's
my favorite, and Olive is Hope's choice&mdash;then my 'nitials would
have spelled P. I. G. and hers H. O. G.; and the school children
would never have called us anything else. I know, 'cause they
call Nort Thomas Nettie. His whole name is Norton Edwin Thomas,
but he always signed his 'nitials on his 'rithmetic papers, and
the boys took to calling him Nettie. It makes it all the worse
'cause he is a regular sissy boy. Have you got any children?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, I s'pose you will have some day, and if I was you, I'd
name them something pretty, or else wait till they got big enough
to choose for themselves. And whatever you do, don't let your
church people raise 'em."</p>

<p>"Wh&mdash;at?"</p>

<p>"That's just what they'll <em>try</em> to do. They did with our
family, and when they got us all spoiled, they said we were the
worst children in town&mdash;that ministers' children always were.
Why, Mrs. Waddler&mdash;her name is Wardlaw, but she is so big and
fat that I call her Waddler&mdash;that's her over there feeding cake
to that scrap of a man&mdash;he's her husband&mdash;well, she told Mrs.
Grinnell once that I was possessed of seven devils. I asked mother
what that meant, and she was dreadfully mad. It takes a lot to
make mother mad, too. When we first moved here to Parker, Mrs.
Wardlaw thought I was the cutest little girl she had ever seen&mdash;she
told me so lots of times&mdash;but she doesn't any more. Now she says
I am a hoy-ena&mdash;no, that isn't the word. It means tomboy, anyway.
That is what Mr. Hardman calls me, too. He's the <em>imbecile</em>
who lives on the farm next to our place."</p>

<p>"The wh&mdash;at?"</p>

<p>"Well, he is! He says so himself. He doesn't b'long to any church,
and hardly ever goes, and he says r'ligion is all tommyrot."</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean infidel," suggested the pastor, trying hard not
to laugh again.</p>

<p>"Maybe. His name is really Hartman. I nicknamed him 'cause he
won't let us have the hazelnuts in his pasture, and he stole my
pet chicken,&mdash;leastwise, he let it stay in his flock so now I
can't coax it back; and he chased us out of his apple trees one
day when we were just climbing after one pretty red one way up
high out of reach. We did knock off quite a few, but we never
meant to carry them off with us. He doesn't like girls, and says
if he had a family of six like us, he'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you six girls all there are?"</p>

<p>"Isn't that enough? Seems to me it's a pretty big family. When
I was little, Cherry and me used to pray that the angels would
never bring any more babies to our family, 'cause the pieces of
pie were getting awfully little, and, of course, they got littler
every time there was another baby. But they brought us Allee anyway.
That was just after mother's onliest uncle died and left her some
money, and she made papa take it and buy our farm and bring us
out here to live after he had been sick a long, long time with
<em>tryfoid</em> fever, and had lost all his pretty hair."</p>

<p>"Didn't you say your papa was a minister?"</p>

<p>"I said he used to be."</p>

<p>"What is he now?"</p>

<p>"An angel."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"You see, papa went right on acting like a preacher even after
the bad people in Pendennis made him sick; and when Old Skinflint
&mdash;I mean Mr. Skinner&mdash;most folks call him deacon, but I guess
it's just 'cause he is so different from a truly deacon, and is
always blaming the Lord for everything that happens&mdash;well, when
he got cold and had pneumonia, papa helped take care of him. The
deacon is so ugly that hardly anyone else would have anything
to do with him; and one rainy night papa was soaked going up to
Skinner's house, and he had to sit up 'most of the night in a
cold room, 'cause the deacon wouldn't have anyone in his room
where the fire was. So papa caught cold, too, and he never got
well. The angels came and carried him away."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I heard Mrs. Abbott tell a lady one day that she thought
mother would soon be an angel, too. Do you s'pose she will?" The
big, brown eyes had suddenly grown wide with fear, and Peace piteously
searched the strong face above her for some comforting assurance.</p>

<p>Just a moment he hesitated, and then answered, tenderly, "We
shall all be angels some day if we are good."</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma is good as gold! But two sure-enough angels in one
family is too many, 'specially when it's the mother and father.
Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>Poor man! What could he say? But at that moment came a timely
interruption in the shape of Miss Dunbar with a huge platter loaded
with glasses of lemonade; and as she spied the two figures in
the little recess, she exclaimed, "Why, Mr. Strong, we've been
hunting all over the building for you. What an effective screen
those brakes and columbines make! None of us thought of finding
you here. Peace, you are very quiet this evening. Would you like
some lemonade? Have you had refreshments, Mr. Strong? The committee
is looking for you to make arrangements for Sunday's meetings."</p>

<p>"I will be there in a moment, Miss Dunbar. Good-night, little
Peace, I see your sisters beckoning to you. When the parsonage
is ship-shape I want you to come and see us. Will you?"</p>

<p>"You bet!" was the prompt and emphatic reply, as Peace skipped
happily away to join her sisters, forgetting, in her gladness,
that neither Hope nor Charity had brought her any cake to eat
with her lemonade.</p>
