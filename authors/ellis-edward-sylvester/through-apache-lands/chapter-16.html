<p>Young Chadmund heard the unmistakable warning of a rattlesnake
that was somewhere near him, and on the very point of striking.
Precisely where it was, it was impossible to determine with any
certainty; but there was no time to consider the matter. It seemed
to him in that brief second he devoted to thought that the venomous
reptile lay a little to the left, and he scrambled out of his
place with all the celerity at his command.</p>

<p>The wonderful quickness of this usually sluggish snake, when
about to deal its deadly blow is well known, and, had the boy
moved with twice the rapidity that he did, Ned could not have
escaped that lightning-like dart of the snake, which was aimed
straight at his foot, that being the part of the body which was
nearest his coil. The fangs struck the side of his shoe, which
happened to move at the very instant the blow was made, and, piercing
the leather, held the reptile fast,&mdash;"Hoist by his own petard,"
as it were,&mdash;so that, when Ned scrambled out from his shelter,
he felt the horrid thing dangling at his heels.</p>

<p>With presence of mind hardly to be expected at such a time, he
arose to his feet, and holding the attached foot motionless, with
the other he hastily stamped all the life from the writhing rattlesnake.
This done he freed the shoe by a jerk, although it tore the fangs
of the reptile from its jaws.</p>

<p>"I think I'd better dust out of here," said the lad, breathlessly.
"I remember that Corporal Hugg told me that where you found one
of those things you are pretty sure of running against another
close by, and I don't care about seeing any, especially when it's
so dark you can't see at all."</p>

<p>He stepped carefully forth in the darkness, and, moving a few
feet, paused to listen. The rain had ceased falling entirely,
and only the faintest mutter of the distant thunder reached his
ears. The darkness was absolutely impenetrable, and the wind,
as it soughed through the wet branches, made the most dreary and
dismal wailing&mdash;enough to strike despair to the bravest heart.</p>

<p>The boy had listened but a moment when a slight rustling among
the leaves at his feet filled him with a sudden conviction that
a second rattlesnake was after him. He left the spot expeditiously,
not halting until he was sure that he was beyond reach of the
unwelcome visitant, which, it is well known, is not much given
to pursuing its prey.</p>

<p>"Hang it!" he exclaimed, "there ain't much fun in this. I wish
daylight would come, so that I could see what to do."</p>

<p>His situation was exceedingly uncomfortable. Everything was soaked
with water, and he could not walk without shaking down the moisture
from the laden branches and undergrowth. He knew of but one place
wherein he could secure protection and that was beneath the rock
where he had so narrowly escaped the rattlesnake, but he was not
very anxious to make his way back there.</p>

<p>While he stood debating what to do, he noticed that the sky was
rapidly clearing, the black, tumultuous clouds rolling away from
the face of the moon, which soon shone out with all its wonted
power. This was a vast help, for, despite the dense shadows made
by the heavy branches overhead, he was able to see enough to pick
his way and noticed that the forest directly in front was quite
open, indicating that he was close to the termination. Thus encouraged,
he pressed ahead and soon had the satisfaction of finding that
he was through the woods and on the border of an open, rocky ravine,
through which he could hear a stream rushing with great violence,
and which he took to be the outlet of the little lake that had
been overcharged by the recent severe storm. So far as he could
see by the moonlight, great masses of rock, boulders and broken
prairie stretched out before him, and he asked himself how he
was to make his way.</p>

<p>He concluded not to make the attempt just then, but, hunting
out a place among the rocks, he crawled into it, first making
sure, by a careful reconnaissance that no rattlesnakes had crept
in ahead of him. He was permitted to remain undisturbed through
the night, and when he opened his eyes the sun was shining directly
in upon him. The boy then hastily sprang up, his heart full of
gratitude to God for the wondrous manner in which his life had
been preserved, and the remarkable success which had followed
his attempt at escape from the Apaches.</p>

<p>With the coming of the glorious sunlight, Ned naturally felt
buoyant and hopeful. He was not without considerable appetite,
but he had eaten so heartily, on the previous evening, that he
felt that he could afford to wait until night again; and he still
had that impatient, almost unreasoning desire to get forward,
which made him feel like breaking into a run, and keeping it up
until he was out of breath.</p>

<p>But, young as was the little fellow, he was old enough to feel
that the time had come when he must use all the brains in his
command. Up to that hour, as will be understood, he had been journeying
entirely at random, his sole purpose being to get beyond reach
of Lone Wolf and his band. He had accomplished this, and a radical
change of tactics must be made.</p>

<p>If Ned Chadmund had been a half dozen years older, he would have
recoiled at the prospect before him; but he was so young and full
of animal spirits that he did not really comprehend the difficulty
and danger. He had traveled very little more than half the distance
between Santa Fe and Fort Havens, and his purpose was to press
ahead until the latter was reached. To do this, it was necessary
that he should make his way through the mountains in which he
now found himself, and then to journey a couple of hundred miles
through or over prairie, and across streams, before he could reach
the frontier post, where his father was so anxiously awaiting
his coming. The project seemed nothing short of madness; but its
justification lay in the fact that the wanderer had the choice
of attempting that or lying down and dying where he was. He could
do nothing but choose the former.</p>

<p>Ned climbed up to an elevated position and took an observation&mdash;his
purpose, after learning whether any present danger threatened,
being to learn the direction it was necessary to follow in order
to reach Fort Havens.</p>

<p>"Corporal Hugg told me that after we reached Devil's Pass, it
was in a straight line West. The trail winds in and out, as it
has to do, but all one had to do was to dig ahead, and he would
be sure to come out right in the end&mdash;that is, if the Indians
and wild animals would only let him. Well, right yonder rose the
sun," he continued, very carefully continuing his observation.
"That must be the east, and all I have to do is to keep that at
my back until it gets over my head and wears round to the front.
So off we go."</p>

<p>There was one favorable accompaniment of this first thoughtful
effort to reach home. The valley-like depression that had caught
his eye upon rising ran precisely in the direction to be desired&mdash;due
east and west&mdash;so that he had the best facility in the world for
getting through the mountains. Still another favorable augury
was that the general direction pursued by the Apaches was the
same, and the fact was, there was very little still intervening
between him and the open prairie beyond. Should his progress remain
uninterrupted through the day, by nightfall he would be close
to the prairie, which stretched away so many miles in the direction
of the frontier post.</p>

<p>"I don't think it's as much as two hundred miles," he said, as
he started off at a rapid walk. "I can make thirty miles a day,
so that I will be there at the end of a week, if nothing unexpected
gets in the way. Won't father be surprised when he sees me walk
up, and won't I be surprised if I manage to do it, also!"</p>
