<p>Will Cummings had abandoned the pen for the sword until such
time as Santa Anna should cry for quarter, and had left the office
in charge of an imported substitute; but late that night he came
to his desk once more, to write the story of the accident to Corporal
Gray; and the tale that he wrote had been already put into writing
by Tom Vanrevel as it fell from Crailey's lips, after the doctor
had, come, so that none might doubt it. No one did doubt it. What
reason had Mr. Carewe to injure Crailey Gray? Only five in Rouen
knew the truth; for Nelson had gone with his master, and, except
Mamie, the other servants of the Carewe household had been among
the crowd in front of the Rouen House when the shot was fired.</p>

<p>So the story went over the town: how Crailey had called to say
good-by to Mrs. Tanberry; how Mr. Carewe happened to be examining
the musket his father had carried in 1812, when the weapon was
accidentally discharged, the ball entering Crailey's breast; how
Mr. Carewe, stricken with remorse and horror over this frightful
misfortune, and suffering too severe anguish of mind to remain
upon the scene, of the tragedy which his carelessness had made,
had fled, attended by his servant; and how they had leaped aboard
the evening boat as it was pulling out, and were now on their
way down the river.</p>

<p>And this was the story, too, that Tom told Fanchon; for it was
he who brought her to Crailey. Through the long night she knelt
at Crailey's side, his hand always pressed to her breast or cheek,
her eyes always upward, and her lips moving with her prayers,
not for Crailey to be spared, but that the Father would take good
care of him in heaven till she came. "I had already given him
up," she said to Tom, meekly, in a small voice. "I knew it was
to come, and perhaps this way is better than that &mdash;I thought
it would be far away from me. Now I can be with him, and perhaps
I shall have him a little longer, for he was to have gone away
before noon."</p>

<p>The morning sun rose upon a fair world, gay with bird-chatterings
from the big trees of the Carewe place, and pleasant with the
odors of Miss Betty's garden, and Crailey, lying upon the bed
of the man who had shot him, hearkened and smiled good-by to the
summer he loved; and, when the day broke, asked that the bed be
moved so that he might lie close by the window. It was Tom who
had borne him to that room. "I have carried him before this,"
he said, waving the others aside.</p>

<p>Not long after sunrise, when the bed had been moved near the
window, Crailey begged Fanchon to bring him a miniature of his
mother which he had given her, and urged her to go for it herself;
he wanted no hands but hers to touch it, he said. And when she
had gone he asked to be left alone with Tom.</p>

<p>"Give me your hand, Tom," he said, faintly. "I'd like to keep
hold of it a minute or so. I couldn't have said that yesterday,
could I, without causing us both horrible embarrassment? But I
fancy I can now, because I'm done for. That's too bad, isn't it?
I'm very young, after all. Do you remember what poor Andre Chenier
said as he went up to be guillotined?&mdash;' There were things in
this head of mine!' But I want to tell you what's been the matter
with me. It was just my being a bad sort of poet. I suppose that
I've never loved anyone; yet I've cared more deeply than other
men for every lovely thing I ever saw, and there's so little that
hasn't loveliness in it. I'd be ashamed not to have cared for
the beauty in all the women I've made love to&mdash;but about this
one&mdash;the most beautiful of all &mdash;I&#11834;"</p>

<p>"She will understand!" said Tom, quickly.</p>

<p>"She will&mdash;yes&mdash;she's wise and good. If Fanchon knew, there wouldn't
be even a memory left to her&mdash;and I don't think she'd live. And
do you know, I believe I've done a favor for Miss Betty in getting
myself shot; Carewe will never come back. Tom, was ever a man's
knavery so exactly the architect of his own destruction as mine?
And for what gain? Just the excitement of the comedy from day
to day!&mdash;for she was sure to despise me as soon as she knew&mdash;and
the desire to hear her voice say another kindly thing to me&mdash;and
the everlasting perhaps in every woman, and this one the Heart's
Desire of all the world! Ah, well! Tell me &mdash;I want to hear
it from you&mdash;how many hours does the doctor say?"</p>

<p>"Hours, Crailey?" Tom's hand twitched pitifully in the other's
feeble grasp.</p>

<p>"I know it's only a few."</p>

<p>"They're all fools, doctors!" exclaimed Vanrevel, fiercely.</p>

<p>"No, no. And I know that nothing can be done. You all see it,
and you want me to go easily&mdash;or you wouldn't let me have my own
way so much! It frightens me, I own up, to think that so soon
I'll be wiser than the wisest in the world. Yet I always wanted
to know. I've sought and I've sought&mdash;but now to go out alone
on the search&mdash;it must be the search, for the Holy Grail &mdash;I&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Please don't talk," begged Tom, in a broken whisper. "For mercy's
sake, lad. It wears on you so."</p>

<p>Crailey laughed weakly. "Do you think I could die peacefully
without talking a great deal? There's one thing I want, Tom. I
want to see all of them once more, all the old friends that are
going down the river at noon. What harm could it do? I want them
to come by here on their way to the boat, with the band and the
new flag. But I want the band to play cheerfully! Ask 'em to play
'Rosin the Bow,' will you? I've never believed in mournfulness,
and I don't want to see any of it now. It's the rankest impiety
of all! And besides, I want to see them as they'll be when they
come marching home&mdash;they must look gay!"</p>

<p>"Ah, don't, lad, don't!" Tom flung one arm about the other's
shoulder and Crailey was silent, but rested his hand gently on
his friend's head. In that attitude Fanchon found them when she
came.</p>

<p>The volunteers gathered at the court-house two hours before noon.
They met each other dismally, speaking in undertones as they formed
in lines of four, while their dispirited faces showed that the
heart was out of them. Not so with the crowds of country folk
and townspeople who lined the streets to see the last of them.
For these, when the band came marching down the street and took
its place, set up a royal cheering that grew louder as Jefferson
Bareaud, the color-bearer, carried the flag to the head of the
procession. With the recruits marched the veterans of 1812 and
the Indian wars, the one-legged cobbler stumping along beside
General Trumble, who looked very dejected and old. The lines stood
in silence, and responded to the cheering by quietly removing
their hats; so that the people whispered that it was more like
an Odd Fellows' Sunday funeral than the departure of enthusiastic
patriots for the seat of war. General Trumble's was not the only
sad face in the ranks; all were downcast and nervous, even those
of the lads from the country, who had not known the comrade they
were to leave behind.</p>

<p>Jefferson unfurled the flag; Marsh gave the word of command,
the band began to play a quick-step, and the procession moved
forward down the cheering lane of people, who waved little flags
and handkerchiefs and threw their hats in the air as they shouted.
But, contrary to expectation, the parade was not directly along
Main Street to the river. "Right wheel! March!" commanded Tappingham,
hoarsely, waving his sword, and Jefferson led the way into Carewe
Street.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, don't cry now!" and Tappingham, with a large
drop streaking down his own cheek, turned savagely upon Lieutenant
Cummings. "That isn't what he wants. He wants to see us looking
cheery and smiling. We can do it for him this once, I guess! I
never saw him any other way."</p>

<p>"You look damn smiling yourself!" snuffled Will.</p>

<p>"I will when we turn in at the gates," retorted his Captain.
"On my soul, I swear I'll kill every sniffling idiot that doesn't!
&mdash;In line, there!" he stormed ferociously at a big recruit.</p>

<p>The lively strains of the band and the shouting of the people
grew louder and louder in the room where Crailey lay. His eyes
glistened as he heard, and he smiled, not the old smile of the
worldly prelate, but merrily, like a child when music is heard.
The room was darkened, save for the light of the one window which
fell softly upon his head and breast and upon another fair head
close to his, where Fanchon knelt. In the shadows at one end of
the room were Miss Betty and Mrs. Tanberry and Mrs. Bareaud and
the white-haired doctor who had said, "Let him have his own way
in all he asks." Tom stood alone, close by the head of the couch.</p>

<p>"Hail to the band!" Crailey chuckled, softly. "How the rogues
keep the time! It's 'Rosin the Bow,' all right! Ah, that is as
it should be. Mrs. Tanberry, you and I have one thing in common,
if you'll let me flatter myself so far: we've always believed
in good cheer in spite of the devil and all, you and I, eh? The
best of things, even if things are bad, dear lady, eh?"</p>

<p>"You darling vagabond!" Mrs. Tanberry murmured, trying to smile
back to him.</p>

<p>"Hark to 'em!" said Crailey. "They're very near! Only hear the
people cheer them! They'll 'march away so gaily,' won't they?&mdash;and
how right that is!" The vanguard appeared in the street, and over
the hedge gleamed the oncoming banner, the fresh colors flying
out on a strong breeze. Crailey greeted it with a breathless cry.
"There's the flag&mdash;look, Fanchon, your flag!&mdash;. waving above the
hedge; and it's Jeff who carries it. Doesn't it always make you
want to dance! Bravo, bravo!"</p>

<p>The procession halted for a moment in the street and the music
ceased. Then, with a jubilant flourish of brass and the roll of
drums, the band struck up "The Star Spangled Banner," and Jefferson
Bareaud proudly led the way through the gates and down the driveway,
the bright silk streaming overhead. Behind him briskly marched
the volunteers, with heads erect and cheerful faces, as they knew
Corporal Gray wished to see them, their Captain flourishing his
sword in the air.</p>

<p>"Here they come! Do you see, Fanchon?" cried Crailey, excitedly.
"They are all there, Jeff and Tappingham, and the two Madrillons
and Will, the dear old fellow&mdash;he'll never write a decent paragraph
as long as he lives, God bless him!&mdash;and young Frank&mdash;what deviltries
I've led the boy into!&mdash;and there's the old General, forgetting
all the tiffs we've had. God bless them all and grant them all
a safe return! What on earth are they taking off their hats for?
&mdash;Ah, good-by, boys, good-by!"</p>

<p>They saw the white face at the window, and the slender hand fluttering
its farewell, and Tappingham halted his men.</p>

<p>"Three times three for Corporal Gray!" he shouted, managing,
somehow, to keep the smile upon his lips. "Three times three,
and may he rejoin his company before we enter the Mexican capital!"</p>

<p>He beat the time for the thunderous cheers that they gave; the
procession described a circle on the lawn, and then, with the
band playing and colors flying, passed out of the gates and took
up the march to the wharf.</p>

<p>"The flag, the flag!" whispered Crailey, following it with his
eyes. "It shows that you helped make it, Fanchon, it's so beautiful.
Ah, Tom, they've said we abused it, sometimes&mdash;it was only that
we loved it so well we didn't like to see anyone make it look
silly or mean. But, after all, no man can do that&mdash;no, nor no
group of men, nor party!" His voice grew louder as the last strains
of the music came more faintly from the street. "They'll take
your banner across the Rio Grande, Fanchon, but that is not all&mdash;some
day its stars must spread over the world! Don't you all see that
they will?"</p>

<p>After a little while, he closed his eyes with a sigh; the doctor
bent over him quickly, and Miss Betty started forward unconsciously
and cried out.</p>

<p>But the bright eyes opened again and fixed themselves upon her
with all their old, gay inscrutability.</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Crailey. "Miss Carewe, may I tell you that I
am sorry I could not have known you sooner? Perhaps you might
have liked me for Fanchon's sake &mdash;I know you care for her."</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;I do!" she faltered. "I love her, and&mdash;ah! &mdash;I do
like you, Mr. Gray, for I know you, though I never&mdash;met you until&mdash;last
night. God bless you &mdash;God bless you!"</p>

<p>She wavered a moment, like a lily in the wind, and put out a
hand blindly. "Not you!" she said sharply, as Tom Vanrevel started
toward her. Mrs. Tanberry came quickly and put an arm about her,
and together they went out of the room.</p>

<p>"You must be good to her, Tom," said Crailey then, in a very
low voice.</p>

<p>"I!" answered Tom, gently. "There was never a chance of that,
lad."</p>

<p>"Listen," whispered Crailey. "Lean down&mdash;no&mdash;closer." He cast
a quick glance at Fanchon, kneeling at the other side of the bed,
her golden head on the white coverlet, her outstretched hand clutching
his; and he spoke so close to Tom's ear and in so low a tone that
only Tom could hear. "She never cared for me. She felt that she
ought to&mdash;but that was only because I masqueraded in your history.
She wanted to tell me before I went away that there was no chance
for me. She was telling me that, when he called from the window.
It was at the dance, the night before, that she knew. I think
there has been someone else from the first &mdash;God send it's
you! Did you speak to her that night or she to you?"</p>

<p>"Ah, no," said Tom Vanrevel. "All the others."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tanberry and Betty and Mr. Bareaud waited in the library,
the two women huddled together on a sofa, with their arms round
each other, and all the house was very still. By and by, they
heard a prolonged, far-away cheering and the steamer's whistle,
and knew that the boat was off. Half an hour later, Will Cummings
came back alone, entered the room on tip-toe, and silently sank
into a chair near Mr. Bareaud, with his face away from Miss Betty.
He was to remain in Rouen another week, and join his regiment
with Tom. None of the three appeared to notice his coming more
than dimly, and he sat with his face bowed in his hands, and did
not move.</p>

<p>Thus perhaps an hour passed, with only a sound of footsteps on
the gravel of the driveway, now and then, and a low murmur of
voices in the rear of the house where people came to ask after
Crailey; and when the door of the room where he lay was opened,
the four watchers started as at a loud explosion. It was Mrs.
Bareaud and the old doctor, and they closed the door again, softly,
and came in to the others. They had left Crailey alone with Fanchon
and Tom Vanrevel, the two who loved him best.</p>

<p>The warm day beyond the windows became like Sunday, no voices
sounded from without in the noon hush, though sometimes a little
group of people would gather across the street to eye the house
curiously and nod and whisper. The strong, blue shadows of the
veranda pillars stole slowly across the white floor of the porch
in a lessening slant, and finally lay all in a line, as the tall
clock in a corner of the library asthmatically coughed the hour
of noon. In this jarring discordance there was something frightful
to Miss Betty. She rose abruptly, and, imperiously waving back
Mrs. Tanberry, who would have detained her&mdash;for there was in her
face and manner the incipient wildness of control overstrained
to the breaking-point&mdash;she went hurriedly out of the room and
out of the house, to the old bench in the garden. There she sank
down, her face hidden in her arms; there on the spot where she
had first seen Crailey Gray.</p>

<p>From there, too, had risen the serenade of the man she had spurned
and insulted; and there she had come to worship the stars when
Crailey bade her look to them. And now the strange young teacher
was paying the bitter price for his fooleries&mdash;and who could doubt
that the price was a bitter one? To have the spirit so suddenly,
cruelly riven from the sprightly body that was, but a few hours
ago, hale and alert, obedient to every petty wish, could dance,
run, and leap; to be forced with such hideous precipitation to
leave the warm breath of June and undergo the lonely change, merging
with the shadow; to be flung from the exquisite and commonplace
day of sunshine into the appalling adventure that should not have
been his for years&mdash;and hurled into it by what hand!&mdash;ah, bitter,
bitter price for a harlequinade! And, alas, alas! for the brave
harlequin!</p>

<p>A gentle touch fell upon her shoulder, and Miss Betty sprang
to her feet and screamed. It was Nelson who stood before her,
hat in hand, his head deeply bowed.</p>

<p>"Is he with you?" she cried, clutching at the bench for support.</p>

<p>"No'm," answered the old man, humbly. "I reckon we all ain' goin'
see dat man no mo'."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"On de way, honey, on de way."</p>

<p>"The way&mdash;to Rouen!" she gasped.</p>

<p>"No'm; he goin' cross de big water." He stretched out his hand
and pointed solemnly to the east. "Him an' me we cotch de boat,
an' yo' pa mek 'em taken de hosses on bode. Den we git off at
Leeville, five mile' down de rivuh, an' yo' pa hol' de boat whiles
I rid back alone an' git de news, an' what de tale is you all
is tole, f'um ole Mist' Chen'eth; an' Mist' Chen'eth, he rid back
wid me an' see yo' pa at Leeville, an' dey talk in de shed by
de landin', an' yo' pa tell Mist' Chen'eth what 'rangements he
goin' make wid de proprety. 'Den he git on de boat ag'in an' dey
sto't her agoin'; an' he ain' wave no good-by, ner say no mo'
wu'ds. Mist' Chen'eth rid back whens de light come; but I res'
de hosses an' come back slow, 'case I ponduh on de worl', an'
I mighty sorry fer yo' pa, Missy. He am' comin' back no mo', honey,
an' Miz Tanberry an' me an' Mamie, we goin' take keer er you.
Yo' pa gone back dah to de F'enchmun, whuh he 'uz a young man.
He mighty sick, an' he scairt, honey; an' he ain' goin' git ovah
dat, neider. 'Peah to me, Missy, like he done had a vizhum er
he own soul, when he come an' look down at dat young man layin'
on de grass, las' night!"</p>

<p>The old fellow bent his back before her in a solemn bow, as a
feudal retainer in allegiance to the heir, but more in deference
to the sorrow written upon her, and respecting its magnitude.
With no words of comfort, for he knew she wanted only to be alone,
he moved away, with infirm steps and shaking head, toward the
rear of the house.</p>

<p>Miss Betty threw herself upon the bench again, face downward
in her arms. And still the house lay in silence under the sunshine.</p>

<p>An hour had passed, and the shadows slanted strongly to the east,
when the stillness was broken by a sound, low and small at first,
then rising fearfully, a long, quavering wail of supreme anguish,
that clutched and shook the listener's heart. No one could have
recognized the voice as Fanchon's, yet everyone who heard it knew
that it was hers; and that the soul of Crailey Gray had gone out
upon the quest for the Holy Grail.</p>

<p>Miss Betty's hands clenched convulsively round the arm of the
bench and a fit of shuddering seized her as if with the grip of
a violent chill, though her eyes were dry. Then she lay quiet.</p>

<p>A long time afterward, she became aware of a step that paced
the garden path behind her, and turned her face upon her arm so
that she saw, but made no other motion. It was Tom Vanrevel, walking
slowly up and down, his hands behind his back and his hat pulled
far down over his eyes. He had not seen her.</p>

<p>She rose and spoke his name.</p>

<p>He turned and came to her. "Almost at the very last," he said,
"Crailey whispered to me that he knew you thought him a great
scamp, but to tell you to be sure to remember that it was all
true about the stars."</p>
