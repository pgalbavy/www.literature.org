<p><em> Nicolo Machiavelli, born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. From
1494 to 1512 held an official post at Florence which included
diplomatic missions to various European courts. Imprisoned in
Florence, 1512; later exiled and returned to San Casciano. Died
at Florence on 22nd June 1527.</em></p>

<p><em>INTRODUCTION</em></p>

<p>Nicolo Machiavelli was born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. He was
the second son of Bernardo di Nicolo Machiavelli, a lawyer of
some repute, and of Bartolommea di Stefano Nelli, his wife. Both
parents were members of the old Florentine nobility.</p>

<p>His life falls naturally into three periods, each of which singularly
enough constitutes a distinct and important era in the history
of Florence. His youth was concurrent with the greatness of Florence
as an Italian power under the guidance of Lorenzo de’ Medici,
Il Magnifico. The downfall of the Medici in Florence occurred
in 1494, in which year Machiavelli entered the public service.
During his official career Florence was free under the government
of a Republic, which lasted until 1512, when the Medici returned
to power, and Machiavelli lost his office. The Medici again ruled
Florence from 1512 until 1527, when they were once more driven
out. This was the period of Machiavelli’s literary activity and
increasing influence; but he died, within a few weeks of the expulsion
of the Medici, on 22nd June 1527, in his fifty-eighth year, without
having regained office.</p>

<p><em>YOUTH — Æ</em>t. 1-25—1469-94</p>

<p>Although there is little recorded of the youth of Machiavelli,
the Florence of those days is so well known that the early environment
of this representative citizen may be easily imagined. Florence
has been described as a city with two opposite currents of life,
one directed by the fervent and austere Savonarola, the other
by the splendour-loving Lorenzo. Savonarola’s influence upon the
young Machiavelli must have been slight, for although at one time
he wielded immense power over the fortunes of Florence, he only
furnished Machiavelli with a subject of a gibe in <em>The Prince</em>,
where he is cited as an example of an unarmed prophet who came
to a bad end. Whereas the magnificence of the Medicean rule during
the life of Lorenzo appeared to have impressed Machiavelli strongly,
for he frequently recurs to it in his writings, and it is to Lorenzo’s
grandson that he dedicates <em>The Prince</em>.</p>

<p>Machiavelli, in his "History of Florence," gives us a picture
of the young men among whom his youth was passed. He writes: "They
were freer than their forefathers in dress and living, and spent
more in other kinds of excesses, consuming their time and money
in idleness, gaming, and women; their chief aim was to appear
well dressed and to speak with wit and acuteness, whilst he who
could wound others the most cleverly was thought the wisest."
In a letter to his son Guido, Machiavelli shows why youth should
avail itself of its opportunities for study, and leads us to infer
that his own youth had been so occupied. He writes: "I have received
your letter, which has given me the greatest pleasure, especially
because you tell me you are quite restored in health, than which
I could have no better news; for if God grant life to you, and
to me, I hope to make a good man of you if you are willing to
do your share." Then, writing of a new patron, he continues: "This
will turn out well for you, but it is necessary for you to study;
since, then, you have no longer the excuse of illness, take pains
to study letters and music, for you see what honour is done to
me for the little skill I have. Therefore, my son, if you wish
to please me, and to bring success and honour to yourself, do
right and study, because others will help you if you help yourself."</p>

<p><em>OFFICE — Æ</em>t. 25-43—1494-1512</p>

<p>The second period of Machiavelli’s life was spent in the service
of the free Republic of Florence, which flourished, as stated
above, from the expulsion of the Medici in 1494 until their return
in 1512. After serving four years in one of the public offices
he was appointed Chancellor and Secretary to the Second Chancery,
the Ten of Liberty and Peace. Here we are on firm ground when
dealing with the events of Machiavelli’s life, for during this
time he took a leading part in the affairs of the Republic, and
we have its decrees, records, and dispatches to guide us, as well
as his own writings. A mere recapitulation of a few of his transactions
with the statesmen and soldiers of his time gives a fair indication
of his activities, and supplies the sources from which he drew
the experiences and characters which illustrate <em>The Prince</em>.</p>

<p>His first mission was in 1499 to Catherina Sforza, "my lady of
Forli" of <em>The Prince</em>, from whose conduct and fate he
drew the moral that it is far better to earn the confidence of
the people than to rely on fortresses. This is a very noticeable
principle in Machiavelli, and is urged by him in many ways as
a matter of vital importance to princes.</p>

<p>In 1500 he was sent to France to obtain terms from Louis <em>XII
</em>for continuing the war against Pisa: this king it was who,
in his conduct of affairs in Italy, committed the five capital
errors in statecraft summarized in <em>The Prince</em>, and was
consequently driven out. He, also, it was who made the dissolution
of his marriage a condition of support to Pope Alexander VI; which
leads Machiavelli to refer those who urge that such promises should
be kept to what he has written concerning the faith of princes.</p>

<p>Machiavelli’s public life was largely occupied with events arising
out of the ambitions of Pope Alexander VI and his son, Cesare
Borgia, the Duke Valentino, and these characters fill a large
space of <em>The Prince</em>. Machiavelli never hesitates to cite
the actions of the duke for the benefit of usurpers who wish to
keep the states they have seized; he can, indeed, find no precepts
to offer so good as the pattern of Cesare Borgia’s conduct, insomuch
that Cesare is acclaimed by some critics as the "hero" of <em>The
Prince</em>. Yet in <em>The Prince</em> the duke is in point of
fact cited as a type of the man who rises on the fortune of others,
and falls with them; who takes every course that might be expected
from a prudent man but the course which will save him; who is
prepared for all eventualities but the one which happens; and
who, when all his abilities fail to carry him through, exclaims
that it was not his fault, but an extraordinary and unforeseen
fatality.</p>

<p>On the death of Pius <em>III, </em>in 1503, Machiavelli was sent
to Rome to watch the election of his successor, and there he saw
Cesare Borgia cheated into allowing the choice of the College
to fall on Giuliano delle Rovere (Julius II), who was one of the
cardinals that had most reason to fear the duke. Machiavelli,
when commenting on this election, says that he who thinks new
favours will cause great personages to forget old injuries deceives
himself. Julius did not rest until he had ruined Cesare.</p>

<p>It was to Julius II that Machiavelli was sent in 1506, when that
pontiff was commencing his enterprise against Bologna; which he
brought to a successful issue, as he did many of his other adventures,
owing chiefly to his impetuous character. It is in reference to
Pope Julius that Machiavelli moralizes on the resemblance between
Fortune and women, and concludes that it is the bold rather than
the cautious man that will win and hold them both.</p>

<p>It is impossible to follow here the varying fortunes of the Italian
states, which in 1507 were controlled by France, Spain, and Germany,
with results that have lasted to our day; we are concerned with
those events, and with the three great actors in them, so far
only as they impinge on the personality of Machiavelli. He had
several meetings with Louis <em>XII </em>of France, and his estimate
of that monarch’s character has already been alluded to. Machiavelli
has painted Ferdinand of Aragon as the man who accomplished great
things under the cloak of religion, but who in reality had no
mercy, faith, humanity, or integrity; and who, had he allowed
himself to be influenced by such motives, would have been ruined.
The Emperor Maximilian was one of the most interesting men of
the age, and his character has been drawn by many hands; but Machiavelli,
who was an envoy at his court in 1507-8, reveals the secret of
his many failures when he describes him as a secretive man, without
force of character—ignoring the human agencies necessary to carry
his schemes into effect, and never insisting on the fulfilment
of his wishes.</p>

<p>The remaining years of Machiavelli’s official career were filled
with events arising out of the League of Cambrai, made in 1508
between the three great European powers already mentioned and
the pope, with the object of crushing the Venetian Republic. This
result was attained in the battle of Vaila, when Venice lost in
one day all that she had won in eight hundred years. Florence
had a difficult part to play during these events, complicated
as they were by the feud which broke out between the pope and
the French, because friendship with France had dictated the entire
policy of the Republic. When, in 1511, Julius II finally formed
the Holy League against France, and with the assistance of the
Swiss drove the French out of Italy, Florence lay at the mercy
of the Pope, and had to submit to his terms, one of which was
that the Medici should be restored. The return of the Medici to
Florence on 1st September 1512, and the consequent fall of the
Republic, was the signal for the dismissal of Machiavelli and
his friends, and thus put an end to his public career, for, as
we have seen, he died without regaining office.</p>

<p><em>LITERATURE AND DEATH — Æ</em>t. 43-58—1512-27</p>

<p>On the return of the Medici, Machiavelli, who for a few weeks
had vainly hoped to retain his office under the new masters of
Florence, was dismissed by decree dated 7th November 1512. Shortly
after this he was accused of complicity in an abortive conspiracy
against the Medici, imprisoned, and put to the question by torture.
The new Medicean pope, Leo X, procured his release, and he retired
to his small property at San Casciano, near Florence, where he
devoted himself to literature. In a letter to Francesco Vettori,
dated 13th December 1513, he has left a very interesting description
of his life at this period, which elucidates his methods and his
motives in writing <em>The Prince</em>. After describing his daily
occupations with his family and neighbours, he writes: "The evening
being come, I return home and go to my study; at the entrance
I pull off my peasant-clothes, covered with dust and dirt, and
put on my noble court dress, and thus becomingly re-clothed I
pass into the ancient courts of the men of old, where, being lovingly
received by them, I am fed with that food which is mine alone;
where I do not hesitate to speak with them, and to ask for the
reason of their actions, and they in their benignity answer me;
and for four hours I feel no weariness, I forget every trouble,
poverty does not dismay, death does not terrify me; I am possessed
entirely by those great men. And because Dante says:</p>

<p>Knowledge doth come of learning well retained, Unfruitful else,</p>

<p>I have noted down what I have gained from their conversation,
and have composed a small work on ‘Principalities,’ where I pour
myself out as fully as I can in meditation on the subject, discussing
what a principality is, what kinds there are, how they can be
acquired, how they can be kept, why they are lost: and if any
of my fancies ever pleased you, this ought not to displease you:
and to a prince, especially to a new one, it should be welcome:
therefore I dedicate it to his Magnificence Giuliano. Filippo
Casavecchio has seen it; he will be able to tell you what is in
it, and of the discourses I have had with him; nevertheless, I
am still enriching and polishing it."</p>

<p>The "little book" suffered many vicissitudes before attaining
the form in which it has reached us. Various mental influences
were at work during its composition; its title and patron were
changed; and for some unknown reason it was finally dedicated
to Lorenzo de’ Medici. Although Machiavelli discussed with Casavecchio
whether it should be sent or presented in person to the patron,
there is no evidence that Lorenzo ever received or even read it:
he certainly never gave Machiavelli any employment. Although it
was plagiarized during Machiavelli’s lifetime, <em>The Prince</em>
was never published by him, and its text is still disputable.</p>

<p>Machiavelli concludes his letter to Vettori thus: "And as to
this little thing [his book], when it has been read it will be
seen that during the fifteen years I have given to the study of
statecraft I have neither slept nor idled; and men ought ever
to desire to be served by one who has reaped experience at the
expense of others. And of my loyalty none could doubt, because
having always kept faith I could not now learn how to break it;
for he who has been faithful and honest, as I have, cannot change
his nature; and my poverty is a witness to my honesty."</p>

<p>Before Machiavelli had got <em>The Prince</em> off his hands
he commenced his "Discourse on the First Decade of Titus Livius,"
which should be read concurrently with <em>The Prince</em>. These
and several minor works occupied him until the year 1518, when
he accepted a small commission to look after the affairs of some
Florentine merchants at Genoa. In 1519 the Medicean rulers of
Florence granted a few political concessions to her citizens,
and Machiavelli with others was consulted upon a new constitution
under which the Great Council was to be restored; but on one pretext
or another it was not promulgated.</p>

<p>In 1520 the Florentine merchants again had recourse to Machiavelli
to settle their difficulties with Lucca, but this year was chiefly
remarkable for his re-entry into Florentine literary society,
where he was much sought after, and also for the production of
his "Art of War." It was in the same year that he received a commission
at the instance of Cardinal de’ Medici to write the "History of
Florence," a task which occupied him until 1525. His return to
popular favour may have determined the Medici to give him this
employment, for an old writer observes that "an able statesman
out of work, like a huge whale, will endeavour to overturn the
ship unless he has an empty cask to play with."</p>

<p>When the "History of Florence" was finished, Machiavelli took
it to Rome for presentation to his patron, Giuliano de’ Medici,
who had in the meanwhile become pope under the title of Clement
<em>VII. </em>It is somewhat remarkable that, as, in 1513, Machiavelli
had written <em>The Prince</em> for the instruction of the Medici
after they had just regained power in Florence, so, in 1525, he
dedicated the "History of Florence" to the head of the family
when its ruin was now at hand. In that year the battle of Pavia
destroyed the French rule in Italy, and left Francis I a prisoner
in the hands of his great rival, Charles V. This was followed
by the sack of Rome, upon the news of which the popular party
at Florence threw off the yoke of the Medici, who were once more
banished.</p>

<p>Machiavelli was absent from Florence at this time, but hastened
his return, hoping to secure his former office of secretary to
the "Ten of Liberty and Peace." Unhappily he was taken ill soon
after he reached Florence, where he died on 22nd June 1527.</p>

<p><em>THE MAN AND HIS WORKS</em></p>

<p>No one can say where the bones of Machiavelli rest, but modern
Florence has decreed him a stately cenotaph in Santa Croce, by
the side of her most famous sons; recognizing that, whatever other
nations may have found in his works, Italy found in them the idea
of her unity and the germs of her renaissance among the nations
of Europe. Whilst it is idle to protest against the world-wide
and evil signification of his name, it may be pointed out that
the harsh construction of his doctrine which this sinister reputation
implies was unknown to his own day, and that the researches of
recent times have enabled us to interpret him more reasonably.
It is due to these inquiries that the shape of an "unholy necromancer,"
which so long haunted men’s vision, has begun to fade.</p>

<p>Machiavelli was undoubtedly a man of great observation, acuteness,
and industry; noting with appreciative eye whatever passed before
him, and with his supreme literary gift turning it to account
in his enforced retirement from affairs. He does not present himself,
nor is he depicted by his contemporaries, as a type of that rare
combination, the successful statesman and author, for he appears
to have been only moderately prosperous in his several embassies
and political employments. He was misled by Catherina Sforza,
ignored by Louis <em>XII, </em>overawed by Cesare Borgia; several
of his embassies were quite barren of results; his attempts to
fortify Florence failed, and the soldiery that he raised astonished
everybody by their cowardice. In the conduct of his own affairs
he was timid and time-serving; he dared not appear by the side
of Soderini, to whom he owed so much, for fear of compromising
himself; his connection with the Medici was open to suspicion,
and Giuliano appears to have recognized his real forte when he
set him to write the "History of Florence," rather than employ
him in the state. And it is on the literary side of his character,
and there alone, that we find no weakness and no failure.</p>

<p>Although the light of almost four centuries has been focused
on <em>The Prince</em>, its problems are still debatable and interesting,
because they are the eternal problems between the ruled and their
rulers. Such as they are, its ethics are those of Machiavelli’s
contemporaries; yet they cannot be said to be out of date so long
as the governments of Europe rely on material rather than on moral
forces. Its historical incidents and personages become interesting
by reason of the uses which Machiavelli makes of them to illustrate
his theories of government and conduct.</p>

<p>Leaving out of consideration those maxims of state which still
furnish some European and eastern statesmen with principles of
action, <em>The Prince</em> is bestrewn with truths that can be
proved at every turn. Men are still the dupes of their simplicity
and greed, as they were in the days of Alexander <em>VI. </em>The
cloak of religion still conceals the vices which Machiavelli laid
bare in the character of Ferdinand of Aragon. Men will not look
at things as they really are, but as they wish them to be—and
are ruined. In politics there are no perfectly safe courses; prudence
consists in choosing the least dangerous ones. Then—to pass to
a higher plane—Machiavelli reiterates that, although crimes may
win an empire, they do not win glory. Necessary wars are just
wars, and the arms of a nation are hallowed when it has no other
resource but to fight.</p>

<p>It is the cry of a far later day than Machiavelli’s that government
should be elevated into a living moral force, capable of inspiring
the people with a just recognition of the fundamental principles
of society; to this "high argument" <em>The Prince</em> contributes
but little. Machiavelli always refused to write either of men
or of governments otherwise than as he found them, and he writes
with such skill and insight that his work is of abiding value.
But what invests <em>The Prince</em> with more than a merely artistic
or historical interest is the incontrovertible truth that it deals
with the great principles which still guide nations and rulers
in their relationship with each other and their neighbours.</p>

<p>In translating <em>The Prince</em> my aim has been to achieve
at all costs an exact literal rendering of the original, rather
than a fluent paraphrase adapted to the modern notions of style
and expression. Machiavelli was no facile phrasemonger; the conditions
under which he wrote obliged him to weigh every word; his themes
were lofty, his substance grave, his manner nobly plain and serious.
<em>Quis eo fuit unquam in partiundis rebus, in definiendis, in
explanandis pressior?</em> In <em>The Prince</em>, it may be truly
said, there is reason assignable, not only for every word, but
for the position of every word. To an Englishman of Shakespeare’s
time the translation of such a treatise was in some ways a comparatively
easy task, for in those times the genius of the English more nearly
resembled that of the Italian language; to the Englishman of to-day
it is not so simple. To take a single example: the word <em>intrattenere</em>,
employed by Machiavelli to indicate the policy adopted by the
Roman Senate towards the weaker states of Greece, would by an
Elizabethan be correctly rendered "entertain," and every contemporary
reader would understand what was meant by saying that "Rome <em>entertained</em>
the Ætolians and the Achaeans without augmenting their power."
But to-day such a phrase would seem obsolete and ambiguous, if
not unmeaning: we are compelled to say that "<em>Rome maintained
friendly relations with the Ætolians</em>," etc., using four words
to do the work of one. I have tried to preserve the pithy brevity
of the Italian so far as was consistent with an absolute fidelity
to the sense. If the result be an occasional asperity I can only
hope that the reader, in his eagerness to reach the author’s meaning,
may overlook the roughness of the road that leads him to it.</p>

<p><em>DEDICATION</em></p>

<p>To the Magnificent Lorenzo Di Piero De’ Medici</p>

<p>Those who strive to obtain the good graces of a prince are accustomed
to come before him with such things as they hold most precious,
or in which they see him take most delight; whence one often sees
horses, arms, cloth of gold, precious stones, and similar ornaments
presented to princes, worthy of their greatness.</p>

<p>Desiring therefore to present myself to your Magnificence with
some testimony of my devotion towards you, I have not found among
my possessions anything which I hold more dear than, or value
so much as, the knowledge of the actions of great men, acquired
by long experience in contemporary affairs, and a continual study
of antiquity; which, having reflected upon it with great and prolonged
diligence, I now send, digested into a little volume, to your
Magnificence.</p>

<p>And although I may consider this work unworthy of your countenance,
nevertheless I trust much to your benignity that it may be acceptable,
seeing that it is not possible for me to make a better gift than
to offer you the opportunity of understanding in the shortest
time all that I have learnt in so many years, and with so many
troubles and dangers; which work I have not embellished with swelling
or magnificent words, nor stuffed with rounded periods, nor with
any extrinsic allurements or adornments whatever, with which so
many are accustomed to embellish their works; for I have wished
either that no honour should be given it, or else that the truth
of the matter and the weightiness of the theme shall make it acceptable.</p>

<p>Nor do I hold with those who regard it as a presumption if a
man of low and humble condition dare to discuss and settle the
concerns of princes; because, just as those who draw landscapes
place themselves below in the plain to contemplate the nature
of the mountains and of lofty places, and in order to contemplate
the plains place themselves upon high mountains, even so to understand
the nature of the people it needs to be a prince, and to understand
that of princes it needs to be of the people.</p>

<p>Take then, your Magnificence, this little gift in the spirit
in which I send it; wherein, if it be diligently read and considered
by you, you will learn my extreme desire that you should attain
that greatness which fortune and your other attributes promise.
And if your Magnificence from the summit of your greatness will
sometimes turn your eyes to these lower regions, you will see
how unmeritedly I suffer a great and continued malignity of fortune.</p>

<p><em>THE PRINCE</em></p>
