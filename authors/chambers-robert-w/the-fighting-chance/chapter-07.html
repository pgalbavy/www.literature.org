<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The days of the house-party at Shotover were numbered. A fresh
relay of guests was to replace them on Monday, and so they were
making the most of the waning week on lawn and marsh, in covert
and blind, or motoring madly over the State, or riding in parties
to Vermillion Light. Tennis and lawn bowls came into fashion;
even water polo and squash alternated on days too raw for more
rugged sport.</p>

<p>And during all these days Beverly Plank appeared with unflagging
persistence and assiduity, until his familiar, big, round head
and patient, delft-blue, Dutch eyes became a matter of course
at Shotover, indoors and out.</p>

<p>It was not that he was either accepted, tolerated, or endured;
he was simply there, and nobody took the trouble to question his
all-pervading presence until everybody had become too much habituated
to him to think about it at all.</p>

<p>The accomplished establishment of Beverly Plank was probably
due as much to his own obstinate and good-tempered persistence
as to Mrs. Mortimer. He was a Harvard graduate&mdash;there are all
kinds of them&mdash;enormously wealthy, and though he had no particular
personal tastes to gratify, he was willing and able to gratify
the tastes of others. He did whatever anybody else did, and did
it well enough to be amusing; and as lack of intellectual development
never barred anybody from any section of the fashionable world,
it seemed fair to infer that he would land where he wanted to,
sooner or later.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Mortimer led him about with the confidence that
was her perquisite; and the chances were that in due time he would
have house-parties of his own at Black Fells&mdash;not the kind he
had wisely denied himself the pleasure of giving, with such neighbours
as the Ferralls to observe, but the sort he desired. However,
there were many things to be accomplished for him and by him before
he could expect to use his great yacht and his estates and his
shooting boxes and the vast granite mansion recently completed
and facing Central Park just north of the new palaces built on
the edges of the outer desert where Fifth Avenue fringes the hundreds.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he had become in a measure domesticated at Shotover,
and Shotover people gradually came to ride, drive, and motor over
the Fells, which was a good beginning, though not necessarily
a promise for anything definite in the future.</p>

<p>Mortimer, riding a huge chestnut&mdash;he could still wedge himself
into a saddle&mdash;had now made it a regular practice to affect the
jocular early-bird squire, and drag Plank out of bed. And Plank,
in no position to be anything but flattered by such sans gêne,
laboriously and gratefully splashed through his bath, wallowed
amid the breakfast plates, and mounted a hunter for long and apparently
aimless gallops with Mortimer.</p>

<p>His acquaintance among people who knew Mortimer being limited,
he had no means of determining the latter's social value except
through hearsay and a toadying newspaper or two. Therefore he
was not yet aware of Mortimer's perennial need of money; and when
Mortimer laughingly alluded to his poverty, Plank accepted the
proposition in a purely comparative sense, and laughed, too, his
thrifty Dutch soul untroubled by misgivings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mortimer had come, among other things, on information;
how much, and precisely of what nature, he was almost too much
ashamed to admit definitely, even to himself. Still, the idea
that had led him into this sudden intimacy with Plank, vague or
not, persisted; and he was always hovering on the edge of hinting
at something which might elicit a responsive hint from the flattered
master of Black Fells.</p>

<p>There was much about Plank that was unaffected, genuine, even
simple, in one sense; he cared for people for their own sakes;
and only stubborn adherence to a dogged ambition had enabled him
to dispense with the society of many people he might easily have
cultivated and liked&mdash;people nearer his own sort; and that, perhaps,
was the reason he so readily liked Mortimer, whose coarse fibre
soon wore through the polish when rubbed against by a closer,
finer fibre. And Plank liked him aside from gratitude; and they
got on famously on the basis of such mutual recognition. Then,
one day, very suddenly, Mortimer stumbled on something valuable&mdash;a
thread, a mere clew, so astonishing that for an instant it absolutely
upset all his unadmitted theories and calculations.</p>

<p>It was nothing&mdash;a vague word or two&mdash;a forced laugh&mdash;and the
scared silence of this man Plank, who had blundered on the verge
of a confidence to a man he liked.</p>

<p>A moment of amazement, of half-incredulous suspicion, of certainty;
and Mortimer pounced playfully upon him like a tiger&mdash;a big, fat,
friendly, jocose tiger:</p>

<p>"Plank, is that what you're up to!"</p>

<p>"Up to! Why, I never thought of such a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Haw! haw!" roared Mortimer. "If you could only see your face!"</p>

<p>And Beverly Plank, red as a beet, comfortably suffused with reassurance
under the reaction from his scare, attempted to refute the other's
conclusions: "It doesn't mean anything, Mortimer. She's just the
handsomest girl I ever saw. I know she's engaged. I only admired
her a lot."</p>

<p>"You're not the only man," said Mortimer blandly, still striving
to reconcile his preconceived theories with the awkward half-confession
of this great, red-fisted, hulking horseman riding at his stirrup.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have her dream," stammered Plank, "that I had ever
thought of such a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why not? It would only flatter her."</p>

<p>"Flatter a woman who is engaged to marry another man!" gasped
Plank.</p>

<p>"Certainly. Do you think any woman ever had enough admiration
in this world?" asked Mortimer coolly. "And as for Sylvia Landis,
she'd be tickled to death if anybody hinted that you had ever
admired her."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" exclaimed Plank, alarmed; "You wouldn't make a joke
of it! you wouldn't be careless about such a thing! And there's
Quarrier! I'm not on joking terms with him; I'm on most formal
terms."</p>

<p>"Quarrier!" sneered the other, flicking at his stirrup with his
crop. "He's on formal terms with everybody, including himself.
He never laughed on purpose in his life; once a month only, to
keep his mouth in; that's his limit. Do you suppose any woman
would stand for him if a better man looked sideways at her?" And,
reversing his riding crop, he deliberately poked Mr. Plank in
the ribs.</p>

<p>"<em>A&mdash;</em>a better man!" muttered Plank, scarce crediting
his ears.</p>

<p>"Certainly. A man who can make good, is good; but a man who can
make better is it with the ladies &mdash;God bless 'em!" he added,
displaying a heavy set of teeth.</p>

<p>Beverly Plank knew perfectly well that, in the comparison so
delicately suggested by Mortimer, his material equipment could
be scarcely compared to the immense fortune controlled by Howard
Quarrier; and as he thought it, his reflections were put into
words by Mortimer, airily enough:</p>

<p>"Nobody stands a chance in a show-down with Quarrier. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>Plank gaped until the tension became unbearable.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;what?" he blurted out.</p>

<p>"Plank," said Mortimer solemnly, and his voice vibrated with
feeling, "Let me do a little thinking before I ask you a&mdash;a vital
question."</p>

<p>But Plank had become agitated again, and he said something so
bluntly that Mortimer wheeled on him, glowering:</p>

<p>"Look here, Plank: you don't suppose I'm capable of repeating
a confidence, do you?&mdash;if you choose to make me understand it's
a confidence."</p>

<p>"It isn't a confidence; it isn't anything; I mean it is confidential,
of course. All there's in it is what I said&mdash;or rather what you
took me up on so fast," ended Plank, abashed.</p>

<p>"About your being in love with Syl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Confound it!" roared Plank, crimson to his hair; and he set
his heavy spurs to his mount and plunged forward in a storm of
dust. Mortimer followed, silent, profoundly immersed in his own
thoughts and deductions; and as he pounded along, turning over
in his mind all the varied information he had so unexpectedly
obtained in these last few days, a dull excitement stirred him,
and he urged his huge horse forward in a thrill of rising exhilaration
such as seizes on men who hunt, no matter what they hunt&mdash;the
savage, swimming sense of intoxication which marks the man who
chases the quarry not for its own value, but because it is his
nature to chase and ride down and enjoy spoils.</p>

<p>And all that afternoon, having taken to his room on pretence
of neuralgia, he lay sprawled on his bed, thinking, thinking.
Not that he meant harm to anybody, he told himself very frequently.
He had, of course, information which certain degraded men might
use in a contemptible way, but he, Mortimer, did not resemble
such men in any particular. All he desired was to do Plank a good
turn. There was nothing disreputable in doing a wealthy man a
favour. … And God knew a wealthy man's gratitude was necessary
to him at that very moment&mdash;gratitude substantially acknowledged.
… He liked Plank&mdash;wished him well; that was all right, too; but
a man is an ass who doesn't wish himself well also. … Two birds
with one stone. … Three! for he hated Quarrier. Four! … for he
had no love for his wife. … Besides, it would teach Leila a wholesome
lesson&mdash;teach her that he still counted; serve her right for her
disgusting selfishness about Plank.</p>

<p>No, there was to be nothing disreputable in his proceedings;
that he would be very careful about. … Probably Major Belwether
might express his gratitude substantially if he, Mortimer, went
to him frankly and volunteered not to mention to Quarrier the
scene he had witnessed between Sylvia Landis and Stephen Siward
at three o'clock in the morning in the corridor; and if, in playful
corroboration, he displayed the cap and rain-coat and the big
fan, all crushed, which objects of interest he had discovered
later in the bay-window. … Yes, probably Major Belwether would
be very grateful, because he wanted Quarrier in the family; he
needed Quarrier in his business. … But, faugh! that was close
enough to blackmail to rub off! … No! … No! He wouldn't go to
Belwether and promise any such thing! … On the contrary, he felt
it his duty to inform Quarrier! Quarrier had a right to know what
sort of a girl he was threatened with for life! … A man ought
not to let another man go blindly into such a marriage. … Men
owed each other something, even if they were not particularly
close friends. … And he had always had a respect for Quarrier,
even a sort of liking for him&mdash;yes, a distinct liking! … And,
anyhow, women were devils! and it behooved men to get together
and stand for one another!</p>

<p>Quarrier would give her her walking papers damned quick! … And,
in her humiliation, is there anybody mad enough to fancy that
she wouldn't snap up Plank in such a fix? … And make it look like
a jilt for Quarrier? … But Plank must do his part on the minute;
Plank must step up in the very nick of time; Plank, with his millions
and his ambitions, was bound to be a winner anyway, and Sylvia
might as well be his pilot and use his money. … And Plank would
be very, very grateful&mdash;very useful, a very good friend to have.
… And Leila would learn at last that he, Mortimer, had cut his
wisdom teeth, by God!</p>

<p>As for Siward, he amounted to nothing; probably was one of that
contemptible sort of men who butted in and kissed a pretty girl
when he had the chance. He, Mortimer, had only disgust for such
amateurs of the social by-ways; for he himself kept to the highways,
like any self-respecting professional, even when a tour of the
highways sometimes carried him below stairs. There was no romantic
shilly-shallying fol-de-rol about him. Women learned what to expect
from him in short order. En garde, Madame!&mdash;ou Mademoiselle&mdash;tant
pis!</p>

<p>He laughed to himself and rolled over, digging his head into
the pillows and stretching his fat hands to ease their congestion.
And most of all he amused himself with figuring out the exact
degree of his wife's astonishment and chagrin when, without consulting
her, he achieved the triumph of Quarrier's elimination and the
theatrical entry of Beverly Plank upon the stage. He laughed when
he thought of Major Belwether, too, confounded under the loss
of such a nephew-in-law, humiliated, crushed, all his misleading
jocularity, all his sleek pink-and-white suavity, all his humbugging
bonhomie knocked out of him, leaving only a rumpled, startled
old gentleman, who bore an amusing resemblance to a very much
mussed-up buck-rabbit.</p>

<p>"Haw! haw!" roared Mortimer, rolling about in his bed and kicking
the slippers from his fat feet. Then, remembering that he was
supposed to be suffering silently in his room, he hunched up to
a sitting posture and regarded his environment with a subdued
grin.</p>

<p>Everything seems easy when it seems funny. After all, the matter
was simple&mdash;absurdly simple. A word to Quarrier, and crack! the
match was off! Girl mad as a hornet, but staggered, has no explanation
to offer; man frozen stiff with rage, mute as an iceberg. Then,
zip! Enter Beverly Plank&mdash;the girl's rescuer at a pinch&mdash;her preserver,
the saviour of her "face," the big, highly coloured, leaden-eyed
deus ex machina. Would she take fifty cents on the dollar? Would
she? to buy herself a new "face"? And put it all over Quarrier?
And live happy ever after? Would she? Oh, not at all!</p>

<p>And Mortimer rolled over in another paroxysm; which wasn't good
for him, and frightened him enough to lie still awhile and think
how best he might cut down on his wine and spirits.</p>

<p>The main thing, after all, was to promise Plank his opportunity,
but not tell him how he was to obtain it; for Mortimer had an
uneasy idea that there was something of the Puritan deep planted
under the stolid young man's hide, and that he might make some
absurd and irrelevant objection to the perfectly proper methods
employed by his newly self-constituted guide and mentor. No; that
was no concern of Plank's. All he had to do was to be ready. As
for Quarrier, anybody could forecast his action when once convinced
of Sylvia's behaviour.</p>

<p>He lay there pondering several methods of imparting the sad but
necessary information to Quarrier. One thing was certain: there
was not now time enough before the house-party dissolved to mould
Plank into acquiescent obedience. That must be finished in town&mdash;unless
Plank invited him to stay at the Fells after his time was up at
Shotover. By Heaven! That was the idea! And there'd be a chance
for him at cards! … Only, of course, Plank would ask Leila too.
… But what did he care! He was no longer afraid of her; he'd soon
be independent of her and her pittance. Let her go to the courts
for her divorce! Let her&mdash;</p>

<p>He sat up rather suddenly, perplexed with a new idea which, curiously
enough, had not appealed to him before. The astonishing hint so
coolly dropped by his wife concerning her fearlessness of divorce
proceedings had only awakened him to the consciousness of his
own vulnerability and carelessness of conduct.</p>

<p>Now it occurred to him, for the first time, that if it were not
a mere bluff on Leila's part, this sudden coquetting with the
question of divorce might indicate an ulterior object. Was Leila
considering his elimination in view of this ulterior object? Was
there an ulterior gentleman somewhere prepared to replace him?
If so, where? And who?</p>

<p>His wife's possible indiscretions had never interested him; he
simply didn't care&mdash;had no curiosity, as long as appearances were
maintained. And she had preserved appearances with a skill which
required all the indifferent and easy charity of their set to
pretend completely deceived everybody. Yes, he gave her credit
for that; she had been clever. Nobody outside of the social register
knew the true state of affairs in the house of Leroy Mortimer&mdash;which,
after all, was all anybody cared about.</p>

<p>And so, immersed in the details of his dirty little drama, he
pondered over the possibility of an ulterior gentleman as he moved
heavily to and fro, dressing himself&mdash;his neuralgia being much
better&mdash;and presently descended the stairs to find everybody absent,
engaged, as a servant explained, in a game of water basket-ball
in the swimming pool. So he strolled off toward the north wing
of the house, which had been built for the squash-courts and swimming
pool.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of an uproar in the big gymnasium as Mortimer
walked in, threading his way through the palms and orange-trees;
much splashing in the pool, cries and stifled laughter, and the
quick rattle of applause from the gallery of the squash-courts.</p>

<p>The Page boys and Rena and Eileen on one side were playing the
last match game against Sylvia, Marion Page, Siward, and Ferrall
on the other; the big, slippery, glistening ball was flying about
through storms of spray. Marion caught it, but her brother Gordon
got it away; then Ferrall secured it and dived toward the red
goal; but Rena Bonnesdel caught him under water; the ball bobbed
up, and Sylvia flung both arms around it with a little warning
shout and hurled it back at Siward, who shot forward like an arrow,
his opponents gathering about him in full cry, amid laughter and
excited applause from the gallery, where Grace Ferrall and Captain
Voucher were wildly offering odds on the blue, and Alderdene and
Major Belwether were thriftily booking them.</p>

<p>Mortimer climbed the slippery, marble stairway as fast as his
lack of breath permitted, anxious for his share of the harvest
if the odds were right. He ignored his wife's smilingly ironical
offer, seeing no sense in bothering about money already inside
the family; but he managed to make several apparently desirable
wagers with Katharyn Tassel and one with Beverly Plank, who was
also obstinately backing the blues, the losing side. Sylvia played
forward for the blues.</p>

<p>Agatha Caithness, sleeves rolled up, tall and slim and strangely
pale in her white flannels, came from the squash-court with Quarrier
to watch the finish; and Mortimer observed her sidewise, blinking,
irresolute, for he had never understood her and was always a trifle
afraid of her. A pair of icicles, she and Quarrier, with whom
he had never been on betting terms; so he made no suggestions
in that direction, and presently became absorbed in the splashing
battle below. Indeed, such a dashing of foam and showering of
spray was taking place that the fronds of the big palms hung dripping
amid drenched blossoms overweighted and prone on the wet marble
edges of the pool.</p>

<p>Suddenly, through the confused blur of foam and spray, the big,
glistening ball shot aloft and remained.</p>

<p>"Blue! Blue!" exclaimed Grace Ferrall, clapping her hands; and
a little whirlwind of cries and hand clapping echoed from the
gallery as the breathless swimmers came climbing out of the pool,
with scarcely wind enough left for a word or strength for a gesture
toward the laughing crowd above.</p>

<p>Mortimer, disgusted, turned away, already casting about him for
somebody to play cards with&mdash;it being his temperament and his
temper to throw good money after bad. But Quarrier and Miss Caithness
had already returned to the squash-courts, the majority of the
swimmers to their several dressing-rooms, and Grace Ferrall's
party, equipped for motoring, to the lawn, where they lost little
time in disappearing into the golden haze which a sudden shift
of wind had spun out of the cloudless afternoon's sunshine.</p>

<p>However, he got Marion, and also, as usual, the two men who had
made a practice of taking away his money &mdash;Major Belwether
and Lord Alderdene. He hadn't particularly wanted them; he wanted
somebody he could play with, like Siward, for example, or even
the two ten-dollar Pages; not that their combined twenty would
do him much good, but it would at least permit him the pleasures
of the card-table without personal loss.</p>

<p>But the Pages had retired to dress, and Voucher was for motoring,
and he had no use for his wife, and he was afraid of Plank's game,
and Siward, seated on the edge of the pool and sharing a pint
of ginger-ale with Sylvia Landis, shook his head at the suggestion
and resumed his division of the ginger-ale.</p>

<p>Plank and Leila Mortimer came down to congratulate them. Sylvia,
always instinctively and particularly nice to people of Plank's
sort whom she occasionally encountered, was so faultlessly amiable,
that Plank, who had never before permitted himself the privilege
of monopolising her, found himself doing it so easily that it
kept him in a state of persistent mental intoxication.</p>

<p>That slow, sweet, upward training inflection to a statement which
instantly became a confided question was an unconscious trick
which had been responsible, in Sylvia's brief life, for more mistakes
than anything else. Like others before him, Beverly Plank made
the mistake that the sweetness of voice and the friendliness of
eyes were particularly personal to him, in tribute to qualities
he had foolishly enough hitherto not suspected in himself. Now
he suspected them, and whatever of real qualities desirable had
been latent in him also appeared at once, confirming his modest
suspicions. Certainly he was a wit! Was not this perfectly charming
girl's responsive and delicious laughter proof enough? Certainly
he was epigrammatic! Certainly he could be easy, polished, amusing,
sympathetic, and vastly interesting all the while. Could he not
divine it in her undivided attention, the quick, amused flicker
of recognition animating her beautiful face when he had turned
a particularly successful phrase or taken a verbal hurdle without
a cropper? And above all, her kindness to him impressed him; her
natural and friendly pleasure in being agreeable. Here he was
already on an informal footing with one of the persons of whom
he had been most shy and uncertain. If people were going to be
as considerate of him as she had proved, why&mdash;why&mdash;</p>

<p>His dull, Dutch-blue eyes returned to her, fascinated. The conquest
of what he desired and meant to have became merged in a vague
plan which included such a marriage as he had dreamed of.</p>

<p>Somebody had once told him that a man who could afford to dress
for dinner could go anywhere; meaning that, being a man, nature
had fitted his feet with the paraphernalia for climbing as high
as he cared to climb.</p>

<p>There was just enough truth in the statement to determine him
to use his climbing irons; and he had done so, carrying his fortune
with him, which had proved neither an impediment nor an aid so
far. But now he had concluded that neither his god-sent climbing
irons, his amiability, his obstinacy, his mild, tireless persistency,
nor his money counted. It had come to a crisis where personal
worth and sterling character must carry him through sheer merit
to the inner temple&mdash;that inner temple of raw gold whose altars
are served by a sexless skeleton in cap and bells!</p>

<p>Siward, inclined to be amused by the duration of the trance into
which Plank had fallen, watched the progress of that bulky young
man's infatuation as he sat there on the pool's marble edge, exchanging
trivial views on trivial subjects with Mrs. Leroy Mortimer.</p>

<p>But her conversation, even when inconsequential, was never wearisome
except when she made it so for her husband's benefit. Features,
person, personality, and temperament were warmly exotic; her dark
eyes with their slight Japanese slant, the clear olive skin with
its rose bloom, the temptation of mouth and slender neck, were
always provocative of the audacity in men which she could so well
meet with amusement or surprise, or at times with a fascinating
audacity of her own wholly charming because of its setting.</p>

<p>Once, in their history, during her early married life, Siward
had been very sentimental about her; but neither he nor she had
approached the danger line closer than to make daring eyes at
one another across the frontiers of good taste. And their youthful
enchantment had faded so naturally, so pleasantly, that always
there had remained to them both an agreeable after-taste&mdash;a sort
of gay understanding which almost invariably led to mutual banter
when they encountered. But now something appeared to be lacking
in their rather listless badinage&mdash;something of the usual flavour
which once had salted even a laughing silence with significance.
Siward, too, had ceased to be amused at the spectacle of Plank's
calf-like infatuation; and Leila Mortimer's bored smile had lasted
so long that her olive-pink cheeks were stiff, and she relaxed
her fixed features with a little shrug that was also something
of a shiver. Then, looking prudently around, she encountered Siward's
eyes; and during a moment's hesitation they considered one another
with an increasing curiosity that slowly became tentative intelligence.
And her eyes said very plainly and wickedly to Siward's: "Oho,
my friend! So it bores you to see Mr. Plank monopolising an engaged
girl who belongs to Howard Quarrier!"</p>

<p>And his eyes, wincing, denying, pretending ignorance too late,
suddenly narrowed in vexed retaliation: "Speak for yourself, my
lady! You're no more pleased than I am!"</p>

<p>The next moment they both regretted the pale flash of telepathy.
There had been something wounded in his eyes; and she had not
meant that. No; a new charity for the hapless had softened her
wonderfully within a fortnight's time, and a self-pity, not entirely
ignoble, had subdued the brilliancy of her dark eyes, and made
her tongue more gentle in dealing with all failings. Besides,
she was not yet perfectly certain what ailed her, never having
really cared for any one man before. No, she was not at all certain.
… But in the meanwhile she was very sorry for herself, and for
all those who drained the bitter cup that might yet pass from
her shrinking lips. Who knows! "Stephen," she said under her breath,
"I didn't mean to hurt you. … Don't scowl. Listen. I have already
entirely forgotten the nature of my offense. Pax, if you please."</p>

<p>He refused to understand; and she understood that, too; and she
gazed critically upon Sylvia Landis as a very young mother might
inspect a rival infant with whom her matchless offspring was coquetting.</p>

<p>Then, without appearing to, she took Plank away from temptation;
so skilfully that nobody except Siward understood that the young
man had been incontinently removed. He, Plank, never doubting
that he was a perfectly free agent, decided that the time had
arrived for triumphant retirement. It had; but Leila Mortimer,
not he, had rendered the decision, and so cleverly that it appeared
even to Plank himself that he had dragged her off with him rather
masterfully. Clearly he was becoming a devil of a fellow!</p>

<p>Sylvia turned to Siward, glanced up at him, hesitated, and began
to laugh consciously:</p>

<p>"What do you think of my latest sentimental acquisition?"</p>

<p>"He'd be an ornament to a stock farm," replied Siward, out of
humour.</p>

<p>"How brutal you can be!" she mused, smiling.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! He's a plain bounder, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. … Is he? He struck me a trifle appealingly&mdash;even
pathetically; they usually do, that sort. … As though the trouble
they took could ever be worth the time they lose! … There are
dozens of men I know who are far less presentable than this highly
coloured and robust young human being; and yet they are part of
the accomplished scheme of things&mdash;like degenerate horses, you
know&mdash;always pathetic to me; but they're still horses, for all
that. Quid rides? Species of the same genus can cross, of course,
but I had rather be a donkey than a mule. … And if I were a donkey
I'd sing and cavort with my own kind, and let horses flourish
their own heels inside the accomplished scheme of things. … Now
I have been brutal. But &mdash;I'm easily coloured by my environment."</p>

<p>She sat, smiling maliciously down at the water, smoothing out
the soaked skirt of her swimming suit, and swinging her legs reflectively.</p>

<p>"Are you reconciled?" she asked presently.</p>

<p>"To what?"</p>

<p>"To leaving Shotover. To-day is our last day, you know. To-morrow
we all go; and next day these familiar walls will ring with other
voices, my poor friend:</p>

<p>"'Yon rising moon that looks for us again &mdash;How oft hereafter
will she wax and wane; How oft hereafter, rising, look for us
Through this same mansion&mdash;and for one in vain!'"</p>

<p>"That is <em>I&mdash;</em>the one, you know. You may be here again;
but I &mdash;I shall not be I if I ever come to Shotover again."</p>

<p>Her stockinged heels beat the devil's tattoo against the marble
sides of the pool. She reached up above her head, drawing down
a flowering branch of Japanese orange, and caressed her delicate
nose with the white blossoms, dreamily, then, mischievously: "I'm
accustoming myself to this most significant perfume," she said,
looking at him askance. And she deliberately hummed the wedding
march, watching the colour rise in his sullen face.</p>

<p>"If you had the courage of a sparrow you'd make life worth something
for us both," he said.</p>

<p>"I know it; I haven't; but I seem to possess the remainder of
his lordship's traits&mdash;inconsequence, self-centred selfishness,
the instinct for Fifth Avenue nest-building&mdash;all the feathered
vices, all the unlovely personality and futility and uselessness
of my prototype. … Only, as you observe, I lack the quality of
courage."</p>

<p>"I don't know how much courage it requires to do what you're
going to do," he said sulkily.</p>

<p>"Don't you? Sometimes, when you wear a scowl like that, I think
that it may require no more courage than I am capable of. … And
sometimes &mdash;I don't know."</p>

<p>She crossed her knees, one slender ankle imprisoned in her hand,
leaning forward thoughtfully above the water.</p>

<p>"Our last day," she mused; "for we shall never be just you and
I again&mdash;never again, my friend, after we leave this rocky coast
of Eden. … I shall have hints of you in the sea-wind and the sound
of the sea; in the perfume of autumn woods, in the whisper of
stirring leaves when the white birches put on their gold crowns
next year." She smiled, turning to him, a little gravely: "When
the Lesser Children return with April, I shall not forget you,
Mr. Siward, nor forget your mercy of a day on them; nor your comradeship,
nor your sweetness to me. … Nor your charity for me, nor all that
you overlook so far in me,&mdash;under the glamour of a spell that
seems to hold you still, and that still holds me. … I can answer
for my constancy so far, until one more spring and summer have
come and gone&mdash;until one more autumn comes, and while it lasts&mdash;as
long as any semblance of the setting remains which had once framed
you; I can answer for my constancy as long as that. … Afterwards,
the snow!&mdash;symbol of our separation. I am to be married a year
from November first."</p>

<p>He looked up at her in dark surprise, for he had heard that their
wedding date had been set for the coming winter.</p>

<p>"A year's engagement?" he repeated, unconvinced.</p>

<p>"It was my wish. I think that is sufficient for everybody concerned." 
Then, averting her face, which had suddenly lost a little of its
colour: "A year is little enough," she said impatiently. "<em>I&mdash;</em>what
has happened to us requires an interval&mdash;a decent interval for
its burial. … Death is respectable in any form. What dies between
you and me can have no resurrection under the snow. … So I bring
to the burial my tribute&mdash;a year of life, a year of constancy,
my friend; symbol of an eternity I could have given you had I
been worth it." She looked up, flushed, the forced smile stamped
on lips still trembling. "Sentiment in such a woman as I! 'A spectacle
for Gods and men,' you are saying&mdash;are you not? And perhaps sentiment
with me is only an ancient instinct, a latent ancestral quality
for which I, ages later, have no use." She was laughing easily.
"No use for sentiment, as our bodies have no use for that fashionable
little cul-de-sac, you know, though wise men say it once served
its purpose, too. … Stephen Siward, what do you think of me now?"</p>

<p>"I am learning," he replied simply.</p>

<p>"What, if you please?"</p>

<p>"Learning a little about what I am losing."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She bent forward impulsively, balancing her body on the pool's
rim with both arms, dropping her knee until her ankles swung interlocked
above the water. "Listen," she said in a low, distinct voice:
"What you lose is no other man's gain! If I warm and expand in
your presence&mdash;if I say clever things sometimes&mdash;if I am intelligent,
sympathetic, and amusing&mdash;it is because of you. You inspire it
in me. Normally I am the sort of girl you first met at the station.
I tell you that I don't know myself now&mdash;that I have not known
myself since I knew you. Qualities of understanding, ability to
appreciate, to express myself without employing the commonplaces,
subtleties of intercourse&mdash;all, maybe, were latent in me, but
sterile, until you came into my life. … And when you go, then,
lacking impulse and incentive, the new facility, the new sensitive
alertness, the unconscious self-confidence, all will smoulder
and die out in me. … I know it; I realise that it was due to you&mdash;part
of me that I should never have known, of which I should have remained
totally ignorant, had it not blossomed suddenly, stimulated by
you alone."</p>

<p>Slowly the clouded seriousness of her blue eyes cleared, and
the smile began to glimmer again. "That is your revenge; you recommit
me to my commonplace self; you restore me to my tinsel career,
practically a dolt. Shame on you, Stephen Siward, to treat a poor
girl so! … But it's just as well. Blunted perceptions, according
to our needs, you know; and so life is tempered for us all, else
we might not endure it long. … A pleasantly morbid suggestion
for a day like this, is it not? … Shall we take a farewell plunge,
and dress? You know we say good-bye to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Where do you go from here?"</p>

<p>"To Lenox; the Claymores have asked us for a week; after that,
Hot Springs for another two weeks or so; after that, to Oyster
Bay. … Mr. Quarrier opens his house on Sedge Point," she added
demurely, "but I don't think he expects to invite you to 'The
Sedges.'"</p>

<p>"How long do you stay there?" asked Siward irritably.</p>

<p>"Until we go to town in December."</p>

<p>"What will you find to do all that time in Oyster Bay?" he asked
more irritably.</p>

<p>"What a premature question! The yacht is there. Besides, there's
the usual neighbourhood hunting, with the usual packs and inevitable
set; the usual steeple-chasing; the usual exchange of social amenities;
the usual driving and riding; the usual, my poor friend, the usual,
in all its uncompromising certainty. … And what are you to do?"</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"After you leave here?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"You don't know where you are going?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to town."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Oh, but haven't you been asked somewhere? You have, of course."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I have declined."</p>

<p>"Matters of business," she inferred. "Too bad!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no."</p>

<p>"Then," she concluded, laughing, "you don't care to tell me where
you are going."</p>

<p>"No," he said thoughtfully, "I don't care to tell you."</p>

<p>She laughed again carelessly, and, placing one hand on the tiled
pavement, sprang lightly to her feet.</p>

<p>"A last plunge?" she asked, as he rose at her side.</p>

<p>"Yes, one last plunge together. Deep! Are you ready?"</p>

<p>She raised her white arms above her head, finger-tips joined,
poised an instant on the brink, swaying forward; then, at his
brief word, they flashed downward together, cutting the crystalline
sea-water, shooting like great fish over the glass-tiled bed,
shoulder to shoulder under the water; and opening their eyes,
they turned toward one another with a swift outstretch of hands,
an uncontrollable touch of lips, the very shadow of contact; then
cleaving upward, rising to the surface to lie breathlessly floating,
arms extended, and the sun filtering down through the ground-glass
roof above.</p>

<p>"We are perfectly crazy," she breathed. "I'm quite mad; I see
that. On land it's bad enough for us to misbehave; but submarine
sentiment! We'll be growing scales and tails presently. … Did
you ever hear of a Southern bird&mdash;a sort of hawk, I think&mdash;that
almost never alights; that lives and eats and sleeps its whole
life away on the wing? and even its courtship, and its honeymoon?
Grace Ferrall pointed one out to me last winter, near Palm Beach&mdash;a
slender bird, part black, part snowy white, with long, pointed,
delicate wings like an enormous swallow; and all day, all night,
it floats and soars and drifts in the upper air, never resting,
never alighting except during its brief nesting season. … Think
of the exquisite bliss of drifting one's life through in mid-air&mdash;to
sleep, balanced on light wings, upborne by invisible currents
flowing under the stars&mdash;to sail dreamily through the long sunshine,
to float under the moon! … And at last, I suppose, when its time
has come, down it whirls out of the sky, stone dead! … There is
something thrilling in such a death&mdash;something magnificent. …
And in the exquisitely spiritual honeymoon, vague as the shadow
of a rainbow, is the very essence and aroma of that impalpable
Paradise we women prophesy in dreams! … More sentiment! Heigho!
My brother is the weeping crocodile, and the five winds are my
wits. … Shall we dress? Even with a maid and the electric air-blast
it will take time to dry my hair and dress it."</p>

<p>When he came out of his dressing-room she was apparently still
in the hands of the maid. So he sauntered through the house as
far as the library, and drawing a cheque-book from one pocket,
fished out a memorandum-book from another, and began to cast up
totals with a view to learning something about the various debts
contracted at Shotover.</p>

<p>He seemed to owe everybody. Fortune had smitten him hip and thigh;
and, a trifle concerned, he began covering a pad with figures
until he knew where he stood. Then he drew a considerable cheque
to Major Belwether's order, another to Alderdene. Others followed
to other people for various amounts; and he was very busily at
work when, aware of another presence near, he turned around in
his chair. Sylvia Landis was writing at a desk in the corner,
and she looked up, nodding the little greeting that she always
reserved for him even after five minutes' separation.</p>

<p>"I'm writing cheques," she said. "I suppose you're writing to
your mother."</p>

<p>"Why do you think so?" he asked curiously.</p>

<p>"You write to her every day, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "but how do you know?"</p>

<p>She looked at him with unblushing deliberation. "You wrote every
day. … If it was to a woman, I wanted to know. … And I told Grace
Ferrall that it worried me. And then Grace told me. Is there any
other confession of my own pettiness that I can make to you."</p>

<p>"Did you really care to whom I was writing?" he asked slowly.</p>

<p>"Care? <em>I&mdash;</em>it worried me. Was it not a pitifully common
impulse? 'Sisters under our skin,' you know &mdash;I and the maid
who dresses me. She would have snooped; I didn't; that's the only
generic difference. I wanted to know just the same. … But&mdash;that
was before&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Before what?"</p>

<p>"Before <em>I&mdash;</em>please don't ask me to say it. … I did, once,
when you asked me."</p>

<p>"Before you cared for me. Is that what you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You are so cruelly literal when you wish to punish me.
… You are interrupting me, too. I owe that wretched Kemp Ferrall
a lot of money, and I'm trying to find out how much seven and
nine are, to close accounts with Marion Page."</p>

<p>Siward turned and continued his writing. And when the little
sheaf of cheques was ready he counted them, laid them aside, and,
drawing a flat packet of fresh bank-notes from his portfolio,
counted out the tips expected of him below stairs. These arranged
for, he straightened up and glanced over his shoulder at Sylvia,
but she was apparently absorbed in counting something on the ends
of her fingers, so he turned smilingly to his desk and wrote a
long letter to his mother&mdash;the same tender, affectionately boyish
letter he had always written her, full of confidences, full of
humour, gaily anticipating his own return to her on the heels
of the letter.</p>

<p>In his first letter to her from Shotover he had spoken casually
of a Miss Landis. It seemed the name was familiar enough to his
mother, who asked about her; and he had replied in another letter
or two, a trifle emphatic in his praise of her, because from his
mother's letters it was quite evident that she knew a good deal
concerning the very unconventional affairs of Sylvia's family.</p>

<p>Of his swift and somewhat equivocal courtship he had had nothing
to say in his letters; in fact recently he had nothing to say
about Sylvia at all, reserving that vital confidence for the clear
sympathy and understanding which he looked forward to when he
should see her, and which, through dark days and bitter aftermaths,
through struggle and defeat by his master-vice, had never failed
him yet, never faltered for an instant.</p>

<p>So he brought his letter to a close with a tender and uneasy
inquiry concerning her health, which, she had intimated, was not
exactly satisfactory, and for that reason she had opened the house
in town in order to be near Dr. Grisby, their family doctor.</p>

<p>Sealing and directing the letter, he looked up to see Sylvia
standing at his elbow. She dropped a light hand on his shoulder
for a second, barely touching him&mdash;a fugitive caress, delicate
as the smile hovering on her lips, as the shy tenderness in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"More letters to your sweetheart?" she asked, abandoning her
hand to him.</p>

<p>"One more&mdash;the last before I see her. … I wish you could see
her, Sylvia."</p>

<p>"I wish so, too," she answered simply, seating herself on the
arm of his chair as though it were a side-saddle.</p>

<p>They sat there very silent for a few moments, curiously oblivious
to the chance curiosity of any one who might enter or pass.</p>

<p>"Would she&mdash;care for me&mdash;do you think?" asked the girl in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"I think so,&mdash;for your real self."</p>

<p>"I know. She could only feel contempt for me&mdash;as I am."</p>

<p>"She is old-fashioned," he said reverently.</p>

<p>"That means all that is best in a woman. … The old fashion of
truth and faith; the old fashion of honour, and faith in honour;
the old, old fashion of&mdash;love. … All that is best, Stephen; all
that is worth the love of a man. … Some day somebody will revive
those fashions."</p>

<p>"Will you?"</p>

<p>"Dear, they would not become me," she said, the tenderness in
her eyes deepening a little; and she touched his head lightly
in humourous caress.</p>

<p>"What shall we do with the waning daylight?" she asked. "It is
my last day with you. I told Howard it was my last day with you,
and I did not care to be disturbed."</p>

<p>"You probably didn't say it that way," he commented, amused.</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"How much of that sort of thing is he prepared to stand?" asked
Siward curiously.</p>

<p>"How much? I don't know. I don't believe he cares. It is my uncle,
Major Belwether, who is making things unpleasant for me. I had
to tell Howard, you know."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Siward incredulously.</p>

<p>"Certainly. Do you think my conduct has passed without protest?"</p>

<p>"You told Quarrier!" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Did you imagine I could do otherwise?" she asked coolly. "I
have that much decency left. Certainly I told him. Do you suppose
that, after what we did&mdash;what I admitted to you&mdash;that I could
meet him as usual? Do you think I am afraid of him?"</p>

<p>"I thought you were afraid of losing him," muttered Siward.</p>

<p>"I was, dreadfully. And the morning after you and I had been
imprudent enough to sit up until nearly daylight&mdash;and do what
we did &mdash;I made him take a long walk with me, and I told
him plainly that I cared for you, that I was too selfish and cowardly
to marry you, and that if he couldn't endure the news he was at
liberty to terminate the engagement without notice."</p>

<p>"What did he say?" stammered Siward.</p>

<p>"A number of practical things."</p>

<p>"You mean to say he stands it!"</p>

<p>"It appears so. What else is there for him to do, unless he breaks
the engagement?"</p>

<p>"And he&mdash;hasn't?"</p>

<p>"No. I was informed that he held me strictly and precisely to
my promise; that he would never release me voluntarily, though
I was, of course, at liberty to do what I chose. … My poor friend,
he cares no more for love than do I. I happen to be the one woman
in New York whom he considers absolutely suitable for him; by
race, by breeding, by virtue of appearance and presence, eminently
fitted to complete the material portion of his fortune and estate."</p>

<p>Her voice had hardened as she spoke; now it rang a little at
the end, and she laughed unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"It appears that I was a little truer to myself than you gave
me credit for&mdash;a little truer to you&mdash;a little less treacherous,
less shameless, than you must have thought me. But I have gone
to my limit of decency; … and, were I ten times more in love with
you than I am, I could not put away the position and power offered
me. But I will not lie for it, nor betray for it. … Do you remember,
once you asked me for what reasons I dropped men from my list?
And I told you, because of any falsehood or treachery, any betrayal
of trust&mdash;and for no other reason. You remember? And did you suppose
that elemental standard of decency did not include women&mdash;even
such a woman as I?"</p>

<p>She dropped one arm on the back of his chair and rested her chin
on it, staring at space across his shoulders.</p>

<p>"That's how it had to be, you see, when I found that I cared
for you. There was nothing to do but to tell him. I was quite
certain that it was all off; but I found that I didn't know the
man. I knew he was sensitive, but I didn't know he was sensitive
to personal ridicule only, and to nothing else in all the world
that I can discover. I &mdash;I suppose, from my frankness to
him, he has concluded that no ridicule could ever touch him through
me. I mean, he trusts me enough to marry me. … He will be safe
enough, as far as my personal conduct is concerned," she added
naively. "It seems that I am capable of love; but I am incapable
of its degradation."</p>

<p>Siward, leaning heavily forward over his desk, rested his head
in both hands; and she stooped from her perch on the arm of the
chair, pressing her hot cheeks against his hands&mdash;a moment only;
then slipping to her feet, she curled up in a great arm-chair
by the fire, head tipped back, blue gaze concentrated on him.</p>

<p>"The thing for you to do," she said, "is to ambush me some night,
and throw me into a hansom, and drive us both to the parson's.
I'd hate you for it as much as I'd love you, but I'd make you
an interesting wife."</p>

<p>"I may do that yet," he said, lifting his head from his hands.</p>

<p>"You've a year to do it in," she observed. … "By the way, you're
to take me in to dinner, as you did the first night. Do you remember?
I asked Grace Ferrall then. I asked her again to-day. Heigho!
It was years ago, wasn't it, that I drove up to the station and
saw a very attractive and perplexed young man looking anxiously
about for somebody to take him to Shotover. Ahem! the notorious
Mr. Siward! Dear, … I didn't mean to hurt you! You know it, silly!
Mayn't I have my little joke about your badness&mdash;your redoubtable
badness of reputation? There! You had just better smile. … How
dare you frighten me by making me think I had hurt you! … Besides,
you are probably unrepentant."</p>

<p>She watched him closely for a moment or two, then, "Are you unrepentant?"</p>

<p>"About what?"</p>

<p>"About your general wickedness? About&mdash;" she hesitated&mdash;"about
that girl, for example."</p>

<p>"What girl?" he asked coldly.</p>

<p>"That reminds me that you have told me absolutely nothing about
her."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to tell," he said, in a tone so utterly new
to her in its finality that she sat up as though listening to
an unknown voice.</p>

<p>Tone and words so completely excluded her from the new intimacy
into which she had imperceptibly drifted that both suddenly developed
a significance from sheer contrast. Who was this girl, then, of
whom he had absolutely nothing to say? What was she to him? What
could she be to him&mdash;an actress, a woman of common antecedents?</p>

<p>She had sometimes idly speculated in an indefinitely innocent
way as to just what a well-born man could find to interest him
in such women; what he could have to talk about to persons of
that sort, where community of tastes and traditions must be so
absolutely lacking.</p>

<p>Gossip, scandal of that nature, hints, silences, innuendoes,
the wise shrugs of young girls oversophisticated, the cool, hard
smiles of matrons, all had left her indifferent or bored, partly
from distaste, partly from sheer incredulity; a refusal to understand,
an innate delicacy that not only refrains from comprehension,
but also denies itself even the curiosity to inquire or the temptation
of vaguest surmise on a subject that could not exist for her.</p>

<p>But now, something of the uncomfortable uneasiness had come over
her which she had been conscious of when made aware of Marion
Page's worldly wisdom, and which had imperceptibly chilled her
when Grace Ferrall spoke of Siward's escapade, coupling this woman
and him in the same scandal.</p>

<p>She took it for granted that there must be, for men, an attraction
toward women who figured publicly behind the foot-lights, though
it appeared very silly to her. In fact it all was silly and undignified&mdash;part
and parcel, no doubt, of that undergraduate foolishness which
seemed to cling to some men who had otherwise attained discretion.</p>

<p>But it appeared to her that Siward had taken the matter with
a seriousness entirely out of proportion in his curt closure of
the subject, and she felt a little irritated, a little humiliated,
a little hurt, and took refuge in a silence that he did not offer
to break.</p>

<p>Early twilight had fallen in the room; the firelight grew redder.</p>

<p>"Sylvia," he said abruptly, reverting to the old, light tone
hinting of the laughter in his eyes which she could no longer
see, "Suppose, as you suggested, I did ambush you&mdash;say after the
opera&mdash;seize you under the very nose of your escort and make madly
for a hansom?"</p>

<p>"I know of no other way," she said demurely.</p>

<p>"Would you resist, physically?"</p>

<p>"I would, if nobody were looking."</p>

<p>"Desperately?</p>

<p>"How do I know? Besides, it couldn't last long," she said, thinking
of his slimly powerful build as she had noticed it in his swimming
costume. Smiling, amused, she wondered how long she could resist
him with her own wholesome supple activity strengthened to the
perfection of health in saddle and afoot.</p>

<p>"I should advise you to chloroform me," she said defiantly. "You
don't realise my accomplishments with the punching-bag."</p>

<p>"So you mean to resist?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. If I were going to surrender at once, I might as
well go off to church with you now."</p>

<p>"Wenniston church!" he said promptly. "I'll order the Mercedes."</p>

<p>She laughed, lazily settling herself more snugly by the fire.
"Suppose it were our fire?" she smiled. "There would be a dog
lying across that rug, and a comfortable Angora tabby dozing by
the fender, and&mdash;you, cross-legged, at my feet, with that fascinating
head of yours tipped back against my knees."</p>

<p>The laughter in her voice died out, and he had risen, saying
unsteadily: "Don't! I &mdash;I can't stand that sort of thing,
you know."</p>

<p>She had made a mistake, too; she also had suddenly become aware
of her own limits in the same direction.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, dear! I meant no mockery."</p>

<p>"I know. … After a while a man finds laughter difficult."</p>

<p>"I was not laughing at&mdash;anything. I was only pretending to be
happy."</p>

<p>"Your happiness is before you," he said sullenly.</p>

<p>"My future, you mean. You know I am exchanging one for the other.
… And some day you will awake to the infamy of it; you will comprehend
the depravity of the monstrous trade I made. … And then&mdash;and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>She passed one slim hand over her face&mdash;"then you will shake
yourself free from this dream of me; then, awake, my punishment
at your hands will begin. … Dear, no man in his right senses can
continue to love a girl such as I am. All that is true and ardent
and generous in you has invested my physical attractiveness and
my small intellect with a magic that cannot last, because it is
magic; and you are the magician, enmeshed for the moment in the
mists of your own enchantment. When this fades, when you unclose
your eyes in clear daylight, dear, I dread to think what I shall
appear to you&mdash;what a dreadful, shrunken, bloodless shell, hung
with lace and scented, silken cerements&mdash;a jewelled mummy-case&mdash;a
thing that never was! … Do you understand my punishment a little,
now?"</p>

<p>"If it were true," he said in a dull voice, "you will have forgotten,
too."</p>

<p>"I pray I may," she said under her breath.</p>

<p>And, after a long silence: "Do you think, before the year is
out, that you might be granted enough courage?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No. I shall not even pray for it. I want what is offered me!
I desire it so blindly that already it has become part of me.
I tell you the poison is in every vein; there is nothing else
but poison in me. I am what I tell you, to the core. It is past
my own strength of will to stop me, now. If I am stopped, another
must do it. My weakness for you, being a treachery if not confessed,
I was obliged to confess, horribly frightened as I was. He might
have stopped me; he did not. … And now, what is there on earth
to halt me? Love cannot. Common decency and courage cannot. Fear
of your unhappiness and mine cannot. No, even the certitude of
your contempt, some day, is powerless to halt me now. I could
not love; I am utterly incapable of loving you enough to balance
the sacrifice. And that is final."</p>

<p>Grace Ferrall came into the room and found a duel of silence
in progress under the dull fire-glow tinting the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Another quarrel," she commented, turning on the current of the
drop-light above the desk from which Siward had risen at her entrance.
"You quarrel enough to marry. Why don't you?"</p>

<p>"I wish we could," said Sylvia simply.</p>

<p>Grace laughed. "What a little fool you are!" she said tenderly,
seating herself in Siward's chair and dropping one hand over his
where it rested on the arm. "Stephen, can't you make her&mdash;a big,
strong fellow like you? Oh, well; on your heads be it! My conscience
is now clear for the first time, and I'll never meddle again."
She gave Siward's hand a perfunctory pat and released him with
a discreetly stifled yawn. "I'm disgracefully sleepy; the wind
blew like fury along the coast. Sylvia, have you had a good time
at Shotover&mdash;the time of your life?"</p>

<p>Sylvia raised her eyes and encountered Siward's.</p>

<p>"I certainly have," she said faintly.</p>

<p>"C'est bien, chérie. Can you be as civil, Stephen&mdash;conscientiously?
Oh, that is very nice of you! But there's one thing: why on earth
didn't you make eyes at Marion? Life might be one long, blissful
carnival of horse and dog for you both. Oh, dear! there, I'm meddling
again! Pinch me, Sylvia, if I ever begin to meddle again! How
did you come out at Bridge, Stephen? What&mdash;bad as that? Gracious!
this is disgraceful&mdash;this gambling the way people do! I'm shocked
and I'm going up to dress. Are you coming, Sylvia?"</p>

<p>The dinner was very gay. The ceremony of christening the Shotover
Cup, which Quarrier had won, proceeded with presentation speech
and a speech of acceptance faultlessly commonplace, during which
Quarrier wore his smile&mdash;which was the only humorous thing he
contributed.</p>

<p>The cup was full. Siward eyed it, perplexed, deadly afraid, yet
seeing no avenue of escape from what must appear a public exhibition
of contempt for Quarrier if he refused to taste its contents.
That meant a bad night for him; yet he shrank more from the certain
misinterpretation of a refusal to drink from the huge loving-cup
with its heavy wreath of scented orchids, now already on its way
toward him, than he feared the waking struggle so sure to follow.</p>

<p>Marion received the cup, lifted it in both hands, and said distinctly,
"Good Hunting!" as she drank to Quarrier. Her brother Gordon took
it, and drank entirely too much. Then Sylvia lifted it, her white
hands half buried among the orchids: "To you!" she murmured for
Siward's ear alone; then drank gaily, mischievously, "To the best
shot at Shotover!" And Siward took the cup: "I salute victory,"
he said, smiling, "always, and everywhere! To him who takes the
fighting chance and wins out! To the best man! Health!" And he
drank as a gentleman drinks, with a gay bow to Quarrier, and with
death in his heart.</p>

<p>Later, the irony of it struck him so grimly that he laughed;
and Sylvia, beside him, looked up, dismayed to see the gray change
in his face.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she faltered, catching his eye; "why do you&mdash;why
are you so white?"</p>

<p>But he only smiled, as though he had misunderstood, saying:</p>

<p>"The survival of the fittest; that is the only test, after all.
The man who makes good doesn't whine for justice. There's enough
of it in the world to go round, and he who misses it gets all
that's due him just the same."</p>

<p>Later, at cards, the aromatic odour from Alderdene's decanter
roused him to fierce desire, but he fought it down until only
the deadened, tearing ache remained to shake and loosen every
nerve. And when Ferrall, finishing his usual batch of business
letters, arrived to cut in if needed, Siward dropped his cards
with a shudder, and rose so utterly unnerved that Captain Voucher,
noticing his drawn face, asked him if he were not ill.</p>

<p>He was leaving on an earlier train than the others, having decided
to pass through Boston and Deptford, at which latter place he
meant to leave Sagamore for the winter in care of the manager
of his mother's farm. So he took a quiet leave of those to whom
the civility might not prove an interruption&mdash;a word to Alderdene
and Voucher as he passed out, a quick clasp for Ferrall and for
Grace, a carefully and cordially formal parting from the Page
boys, which pleased them ineffably.</p>

<p>Eileen and Rena, who had never had half a chance at him, took
it now, delighted to discipline their faithful Pages; and he submitted
in his own engagingly agreeable way, and so skilfully that both
Eileen and Rena felt sorry that they had not earlier understood
how civilly anxious he had been to devote himself to them alone.
And they looked at the Pages, exasperated.</p>

<p>In the big hall he passed Marion, and stopped to take his leave.</p>

<p>No, he would do no hunting this season either at Carysford or
with the two trial packs at Eastwood. Possibly at Warrenton later,
but probably not; business threatened to detain him in town more
or less. … Of course he'd come to see her when she returned to
town. … And it had been a jolly party, and it was a shame to sound
"lights out" so soon! Good-bye. … Good night. And that was all.</p>

<p>And that was all, unless he disturbed Sylvia, seated at cards
with Quarrier and Major Belwether and Leila Mortimer&mdash;and very
intent on the dummy, very still, and a trifle pallid with the
pallor of concentration.</p>

<p>So&mdash;that was all, then.</p>

<p>Ascending the stairs, a servant handed him a letter bearing the
crest of the Lenox Club. He pocketed it unopened and continued
his way.</p>

<p>In the darkness of his own room he sat down, the devil's own
clutch on his shrinking nerves, a deathly desire tearing at his
very vitals, and every vein a tiny trail of fire run riot. He
had been too long without it, too long to endure the craving aroused
by that gay draught from Quarrier's loving-cup.</p>

<p>The awakened fury of his desire appalled him, and for a while
that occupied him, enabling him to endure. But fear and dismay
soon passed in the purely physical distress; he walked the floor,
haggard, the sweat starting on his face; he lay with clenched
hands, stiffened out across the bed, deafened by the riotous clamour
of his pulses, conscious that he was holding out, unconscious
how long he could hold out.</p>

<p>Crisis after crisis swept him; sometimes he found his feet and
moved blindly about the room.</p>

<p>Strange periods of calm intervened; sensation seemed deadened;
and he stood as a man who listens, scarcely daring to breathe
lest the enemy awake and seize him.</p>

<p>He turned on the light, later, to look for his pipe, and he caught
a glimpse of himself in the mirror. It was a sick man who stared
back at him out of hollow eyes, and the physical revulsion shocked
him into something resembling self-command.</p>

<p>"Damn you!" he said fiercely, setting his teeth and staring back
at his reflected face, "I'll kill you yet before I've finished
with you!"</p>

<p>Then he filled his pipe, and opening his bedroom window, sat
down, resting his arm on the sill. A splendid moon silvered the
sea; through the intense stillness he heard the surf, magnificently
dissonant among the reefs, and he listened, fascinated, loathing
the tides as he feared and loathed the inexorable tides that surged
and ebbed with his accursed desire.</p>

<p>Once he said to himself, weakly&mdash;for he was deadly tired&mdash;"What
am I making the fight for, anyway?" And "Who are you making the
fight for?"  echoed his heavy pulses.</p>

<p>He had asked that question and received that answer before. After
all, it had been for his mother's sake alone. And now&mdash;and now?&mdash;his
heart beat out another answer; and before his eyes two other eyes
seemed to open, fearlessly, sweetly, divinely tender. But they
were no longer his mother's grave, gray eyes.</p>

<p>After the second pipe he remembered his letter. It gave him something
to do, so he opened it and tried to read it, but for a long while,
in his confused physical and mental condition, he could make no
sense of it.</p>

<p>Little by little he began to comprehend its purport that his
resignation was regretfully requested by the governors of the
Lenox Club for reasons unassigned.</p>

<p>The shock of the thing came to him after a while, like a distant,
dull report long after the flash of the explosion. Well, the affair,
bad enough at first, was turning worse, that was all. How much
of that sort of discredit could a man stand and keep his balance?
… And what would his mother say?</p>

<p>Confused from his own physical suffering, the blow had fallen
with a deadened force on nerves already numbed; but his half-stupefied
acquiescence had suddenly become a painful recoil when he remembered
where the brunt of the disgrace would fall&mdash;where the centre of
suffering must always be, and the keenest grief concentrated.
Roused, appalled, almost totally unnerved, he stood staring at
the letter, beginning to realise what it would mean to his mother.
A passion of remorse and resentment swept him. She must be spared
that! There must be some way&mdash;some punishment for his offence
that could not strike her through him! It was wicked, it was contemptible,
insane, to strike her! What were the governors of the Lenox about&mdash;a
lot of snivelling hypocrites, pandering to the horrified snobbery
at the Patroons! Who were they, anyway, to discipline him! Scarce
one in fifty among the members of the two clubs was qualified
to sit in judgment on a Siward!</p>

<p>But that tempest of passion and mortification passed, too, leaving
him standing there, dumb, desperate, staring at the letter crushed
in his shaking hand.</p>

<p>He must see somebody, some member of the Lenox, and do something&mdash;something!
Ferrall! Was that Ferrall's step on the landing?</p>

<p>He sprang to the door and opened it. Quarrier, passing the corridor,
turned an expressionless visage toward him, and passed on with
a nod almost imperceptible.</p>

<p>"Quarrier!" he called, swept by a sudden impulse.</p>

<p>Quarrier halted and turned.</p>

<p>"Could you give me a moment&mdash;here in my room? I won't detain
you."</p>

<p>The faint trace of surprise faded from Quarrier's face; he quietly
retraced his steps, and, entering Siward's room, stood silently
confronting its pallid tenant.</p>

<p>"Will you sit down a moment?"</p>

<p>Quarrier seated himself in the arm-chair by the window, and Siward
found a chair opposite.</p>

<p>"Quarrier," said the younger man, turning a tensely miserable
face on his visitor, "I want to ask you something. I'll not mince
matters. You know that the Patroons have dropped me, and you know
what for."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know."</p>

<p>"When I was called before the Board of Governors to explain the
matter, if I could, you were sitting on that Board."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I denied the charge, but refused to explain. … You remember?"</p>

<p>Quarrier nodded coldly.</p>

<p>"And I was dropped by the club!"</p>

<p>A slight inclination of Quarrier's symmetrical head corroborated
him.</p>

<p>"Now," said Siward, slowly and very distinctly, "I shall tell
you unofficially what I refused to tell the other governors officially." 
And, as he began speaking, Quarrier's face flushed, then the features
became immobile, set, and inert, and his eyes grew duller and
duller, as though, under a smooth surface the soul inside of him
was shrinking back into some dark corner, silent, watchful, suspicious,
and perhaps defiant.</p>

<p>"Mr. Quarrier," said Siward quietly, "I did not take that girl
to the Patroons Club&mdash;and you know it."</p>

<p>Quarrier was all surface now; he had drawn away internally so
far that even his eyes seemed to recede until they scarcely glimmered
through the slits in his colourless mask. And Siward went on:</p>

<p>"I knew perfectly well what sort of women I was to meet at that
fool supper Billy Fleetwood gave; and you must have, too, for
the girl you took in was no stranger to you. … Her name is Lydia
Vyse, I believe."</p>

<p>The slightest possible glimmer in the elder man's eyes was all
the answer he granted.</p>

<p>"What happened," said Siward calmly, "was this: She bet me she
could so disguise herself that I could safely take her into any
club in New York. I bet her she couldn't. I never dreamed of trying.
Besides, she was your&mdash;dinner partner," he added with a shrug.</p>

<p>His concentrated gaze seemed at length to pierce the expressionless
surface of the other man, who moved slightly in his chair and
moistened his thin lips under the glossy beard.</p>

<p>"Quarrier," said Siward earnestly, "What happened in the club
lobby I don't exactly know, because I was not in a condition to
know. I admit it; that was the trouble with me. When I left Fleetwood's
rooms I left with a half dozen men. I remember crossing Fifth
Avenue with them; and the next thing I remember distinctly was
loud talking in the club lobby, and a number of men there, and
a slim young fellow in Inverness and top hat in the centre of
a crowd, whose face was the face of that girl, Lydia Vyse. And
that is absolutely all. But I couldn't do more than deny that
I took her there unless I told what I knew; and of course that
was not possible, even in self-defence. But it was for you to
admit that I was right. And you did not. You dared not! You let
another man blunder into your private affairs and fall a victim
to circumstantial evidence which you could have refuted; and it
was up to you to say something! And you did not! … And now&mdash;what
are you going to do? The Lenox Club has taken this thing up. A
man can't stand too much of that sort of thing. What am I to do?
I can't defend myself by betraying my accidental knowledge of
your petty, private affairs. So I leave it to you. I ask you what
are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean" &mdash;Quarrier's voice was not his own, and he
brought it harshly under command&mdash;"do you mean that you think
it necessary for me to say I knew her? What object would be attained
by that? I did not take her to the Patroons'."</p>

<p>"Nor did I. Ask her how she got there. Learn the truth from her,
man!"</p>

<p>"What proof is there that I ever met her before I took her into
supper at Fleetwood's?"</p>

<p>"Proof! Are you mad? All I ask of you is to say to the governors
what I cannot say without using your name."</p>

<p>"You wish me," asked Quarrier icily, "to deny that you made that
wager? I can do that."</p>

<p>"You can't do it! I did make that bet."</p>

<p>"Oh! Then, what is it you wish me to say?"</p>

<p>"Tell them the truth. Tell them you know I did not take her to
the club. You need not tell them why you know it. You need not
tell them how much you know about her, whose brougham she drove
home in. I can't defend myself at your expense&mdash;intrench myself
behind your dirty little romance. What could I say? I denied taking
her to the club. Then Major Belwether confronted me with my wager.
Then I shut up. And so did you, Quarrier&mdash;so did you, seated there
among the governors, between Leroy Mortimer and Belwether. It
was up to you, and you did not stir!"</p>

<p>"Stir!" echoed the other man, exasperated. "Of course I did not
stir. What did I know about it? Do you think I care to give a
man like Mortimer a hold on me by admitting I knew anything?&mdash;or
Belwether&mdash;do you think I care to have that man know anything
about my private and personal business? Did you expect me to say
that I was in a position to prove anything one way or another?
And," he added with increasing harshness, "how do you know what
I might or might not prove? If she went to the Patroons Club,
I did not go with her; I did not see her; I don't know whether
or not you took her."</p>

<p>"I have already told you that I did not take her," said Siward,
turning whiter.</p>

<p>"You told that to the governors, too. Tell them again, if you
like. I decline to discuss this matter with you. I decline to
countenance your unwarranted intrusion into what you pretend to
believe are my private affairs. I decline to confer with Belwether
or Mortimer. It's enough that you are inclined to meddle&mdash;" His
cold anger was stirring. He rose to his full, muscular height,
slow, menacing, his long, pale fingers twisting his silky beard.
"It's enough that you meddle!" he repeated. "As for the matter
in question, a dozen men, including myself, heard you make a wager;
and later I myself was a witness that the terms of that wager
had been carried out to the letter. I know absolutely nothing
except that, Mr. Siward; nor, it appears, do you, for you were
drunk at the time, and you have admitted it to me."</p>

<p>"I have asked you," said Siward, rising, and very grave, "I have
asked you to do the right thing. Are you going to do it?"</p>

<p>"Is that a threat?" inquired Quarrier, showing the edges of his
well-kept teeth. "Is this intimidation, Mr. Siward? Do I understand
that you are proposing to bespatter others with scandal unless
I am frightened into going to the governors with the flimsy excuse
you attempt to offer me? In other words, Mr. Siward, are you bent
on making me pay for what you believe you know of my private life?
Is it really intimidation?"</p>

<p>And still Siward stared into his half-veiled, sneering eyes,
speechless.</p>

<p>"There is only one name used for this kind of thing," added Quarrier,
taking a quick involuntary step backward to the door as the blaze
of fury broke out in Siward's eyes.</p>

<p>"Good God! Quarrier," whispered Siward with dry lips, "what a
cur you are! What a cur!"</p>

<p>And long after Quarrier had passed the door and disappeared in
the corridor, Siward stood there, frozen motionless under the
icy waves of rage that swept him.</p>

<p>He had never before had an enemy worth the name; he knew he had
one now. He had never before hated; he now understood something
of that, too. The purely physical craving to take this man and
crush him into eternal quiescence had given place to a more terrible
mental desire to punish. His brain surged and surged under the
first flood of a mortal hatred. That the hatred was sterile made
it the more intense, and, blinded by it, he stood there or paced
the room minute after minute, hearing nothing but the wild clamour
in his brain, seeing nothing but the smooth, expressionless face
of the man whom he could not reach.</p>

<p>Toward midnight, seated in his chair by the window, a deathly
lassitude weighing his heart, he heard the steps of people on
the stairway, the click of the ascending elevator, gay voices
calling good night, a ripple of laughter, the silken swish of
skirts in the corridor, doors opening and closing; then silence
creeping throughout the house on the receding heels of departure&mdash;a
stillness that settled like a mist through hall and corridor,
accented for a few moments by distant sounds, then absolute, echoless
silence. And for a long while he sat there listening.</p>

<p>The cool wind from the ocean blew his curtains far into the room,
where they bellied out, fluttering, floating, subsiding, only
to rise again in the freshening breeze. He sat watching their
silken convolutions, stupidly, for a while, then rose and closed
his window, and raised the window on the south for purposes of
air.</p>

<p>As he turned to adjust his transom, something white thrust under
the door caught his eye, and he walked over and drew it across
the sill. It was a sealed note. He opened it, reading it as he
walked back to the drop-light burning beside his bed:</p>

<p>"Did you not mean to say good-bye? Because it is to be good-bye
for a long, long time&mdash;for all our lives&mdash;as long as we live&mdash;as
long as the world lasts, and longer. … Good-bye&mdash;unless you care
to say it to me."</p>

<p>He stood studying the note for a while; presently, lighting a
match, he set fire to it and carried it blazing to the grate and
flung it in, watching the blackened ashes curl up, glow, whiten,
and fall in flakes to the hearth. Then he went out into the corridor,
and traversed the hall to the passage which led to the bay-window.
There was nobody there. The stars looked in on him, twinkling
with a frosty light; beneath, the shadowy fronds of palms traced
a pale pattern on the glass roof of the swimming pool. He waited
a moment, turned, retraced his steps to his own door and stood
listening. Then, moving swiftly, he walked the length of the corridor,
and, halting at her door, knocked once.</p>

<p>After a moment the door swung open. He stepped forward into the
room, closing the door behind him, and confronted the tall girl
standing there silhouetted against the lamp behind her.</p>

<p>"You are insane to do this!" she whispered. "I let you in for
fear you'd knock again!"</p>

<p>"I went to the bay-window," he said.</p>

<p>"You went too late. I was there an hour ago. I waited. Do you
know what time it is?"</p>

<p>"Come to the bay-window," he said, "if you fear me here."</p>

<p>"Do you know it is nearly three o'clock?" she repeated. "And
you leave at six.</p>

<p>"Shall we say good-bye here?" he asked coolly.</p>

<p>"Certainly. I dare not go out. And you&mdash;do you know the chances
we are running? You must be perfectly mad to come to my room.
Do you think anybody could have seen&mdash;heard you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. Good night." He offered his hand; she laid both of hers
in it. He could scarcely distinguish her features where she stood
dark against the brilliant light behind her.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he whispered, kissing her hands where they lay in
his.</p>

<p>"Good-bye." Her fingers closed convulsively, retaining his hands.
"I hope &mdash;I think that&mdash;you&mdash;" Her head was drooping; she
could not control her voice.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Sylvia," he said again.</p>

<p>It was quite useless, she could not speak; and when he took her
in his arms she clung to him, quivering; and he kissed the wet
lashes, and the hot, trembling lips, and the smooth little hands
crushed to his breast.</p>

<p>"We have a year yet," she gasped. "Dear, take me by force before
it ends. I &mdash;I simply cannot endure this. I told you to take
me&mdash;to tear me from myself. Will you do it? I will love you&mdash;truly,
truly! Oh, my darling, my darling! Don't&mdash;don't give me up! Can't
you do something for us? Can't you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you come with me now?"</p>

<p>"How can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you?"</p>

<p>A sudden sound broke out in the night&mdash;the distant pealing of
the lodge-gate bell. Startled, she shrank back; somebody in the
adjoining room had sprung to the floor and was opening the window.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she motioned with whitening lips. "Quick! oh, quick,
before you are seen! Grace may come! I &mdash;I beg of you to
go!"</p>

<p>As he stepped into the corridor he heard, below, a sound at the
great door, and the stirring of the night watchman on post. At
his own door he turned, listening to the movement and whispering.
Ferrall, in dressing-gown and slippers, stepped into the corridor;
below, the chains were rattling as the wicket swung open. There
was a brief parley at the door, sounds of retreating steps on
the gravel outside, sounds of approaching steps on the stairway.</p>

<p>"What's that? A telegram?" said Ferrall sharply. "Here, give
it to me. … Wait! It isn't for me. It's for Mr Siward!"</p>

<p>Siward, standing at his open door, swayed slightly. A thrill
of pure fear struck him through and through. He laid one hand
on the door to steady himself, and stepped forward as Ferrall
came up.</p>

<p>"Oh! You're awake, Stephen. Here's a telegram." He extended his
hand. Siward took the yellow envelope, fumbled it, tore it open.</p>

<p>"Good God!" whispered Ferrall; "is it bad?"</p>

<p>And Siward's glazed eyes stared and stared at the scrawled and
inky message:</p>

<p>"<em>YOUR MOTHER IS VERY ILL. COME AT ONCE</em>."</p>

<p>The signature was the name of their family physician, Grisby.</p>
