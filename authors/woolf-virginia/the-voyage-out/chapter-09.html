<p>An hour passed, and the downstairs rooms at the hotel grew dim
and were almost deserted, while the little box-like squares above
them were brilliantly irradiated. Some forty or fifty people were
going to bed. The thump of jugs set down on the floor above could
be heard and the clink of china, for there was not as thick a
partition between the rooms as one might wish, so Miss Allan,
the elderly lady who had been playing bridge, determined, giving
the wall a smart rap with her knuckles. It was only matchboard,
she decided, run up to make many little rooms of one large one.
Her grey petticoats slipped to the ground, and, stooping, she
folded her clothes with neat, if not loving fingers, screwed her
hair into a plait, wound her father's great gold watch, and opened
the complete works of Wordsworth. She was reading the "Prelude,"
partly because she always read the "Prelude" abroad, and partly
because she was engaged in writing a short <em>Primer</em> <em>of</em>
<em>English</em> <em>Literature</em>&mdash;<em>Beowulf</em> <em>to</em>
<em>Swinburne</em>&mdash;which would have a paragraph on Wordsworth.
She was deep in the fifth book, stopping indeed to pencil a note,
when a pair of boots dropped, one after another, on the floor
above her. She looked up and speculated. Whose boots were they,
she wondered. She then became aware of a swishing sound next door&mdash;a
woman, clearly, putting away her dress. It was succeeded by a
gentle tapping sound, such as that which accompanies hair-dressing.
It was very difficult to keep her attention fixed upon the "Prelude."
Was it Susan Warrington tapping? She forced herself, however,
to read to the end of the book, when she placed a mark between
the pages, sighed contentedly, and then turned out the light.</p>

<p>Very different was the room through the wall, though as like
in shape as one egg-box is like another. As Miss Allan read her
book, Susan Warrington was brushing her hair. Ages have consecrated
this hour, and the most majestic of all domestic actions, to talk
of love between women; but Miss Warrington being alone could not
talk; she could only look with extreme solicitude at her own face
in the glass. She turned her head from side to side, tossing heavy
locks now this way now that; and then withdrew a pace or two,
and considered herself seriously.</p>

<p>"I'm nice-looking," she determined. "Not pretty&mdash;possibly," she
drew herself up a little. "Yes&mdash;most people would say I was handsome."</p>

<p>She was really wondering what Arthur Venning would say she was.
Her feeling about him was decidedly queer. She would not admit
to herself that she was in love with him or that she wanted to
marry him, yet she spent every minute when she was alone in wondering
what he thought of her, and in comparing what they had done to-day
with what they had done the day before.</p>

<p>"He didn't ask me to play, but he certainly followed me into
the hall," she meditated, summing up the evening. She was thirty
years of age, and owing to the number of her sisters and the seclusion
of life in a country parsonage had as yet had no proposal of marriage.
The hour of confidences was often a sad one, and she had been
known to jump into bed, treating her hair unkindly, feeling herself
overlooked by life in comparison with others. She was a big, well-made
woman, the red lying upon her cheeks in patches that were too
well defined, but her serious anxiety gave her a kind of beauty.</p>

<p>She was just about to pull back the bed-clothes when she exclaimed,
"Oh, but I'm forgetting," and went to her writing-table. A brown
volume lay there stamped with the figure of the year. She proceeded
to write in the square ugly hand of a mature child, as she wrote
daily year after year, keeping the diaries, though she seldom
looked at them.</p>

<p>"<em>A.M. &</em>mdash;Talked to Mrs. H. Elliot about country
neighbours. She knows the Manns; also the Selby-Carroways. How
small the world is! Like her. Read a chapter of <em>Miss</em>
<em>Appleby's</em> <em>Adventure</em> to Aunt E. <em>P.M. &</em>mdash;Played
lawn-tennis with Mr. Perrott and Evelyn M. Don't <em>like</em>
Mr. P. Have a feeling that he is not 'quite,' though clever certainly.
Beat them. Day splendid, view wonderful. One gets used to no trees,
though much too bare at first. Cards after dinner. Aunt E. cheerful,
though twingy, she says. Mem.: <em>ask</em> <em>about</em> <em>damp</em>
<em>sheets</em>."</p>

<p>She knelt in prayer, and then lay down in bed, tucking the blankets
comfortably about her, and in a few minutes her breathing showed
that she was asleep. With its profoundly peaceful sighs and hesitations
it resembled that of a cow standing up to its knees all night
through in the long grass.</p>

<p>A glance into the next room revealed little more than a nose,
prominent above the sheets. Growing accustomed to the darkness,
for the windows were open and showed grey squares with splinters
of starlight, one could distinguish a lean form, terribly like
the body of a dead person, the body indeed of William Pepper,
asleep too. Thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight&mdash;here were
three Portuguese men of business, asleep presumably, since a snore
came with the regularity of a great ticking clock. Thirty-nine
was a corner room, at the end of the passage, but late though
it was&mdash;"One" struck gently downstairs&mdash;a line of light under
the door showed that some one was still awake.</p>

<p>"How late you are, Hugh!" a woman, lying in bed, said in a peevish
but solicitous voice. Her husband was brushing his teeth, and
for some moments did not answer.</p>

<p>"You should have gone to sleep," he replied. "I was talking to
Thornbury."</p>

<p>"But you know that I never can sleep when I'm waiting for you,"
she said.</p>

<p>To that he made no answer, but only remarked, "Well then, we'll
turn out the light." They were silent.</p>

<p>The faint but penetrating pulse of an electric bell could now
be heard in the corridor. Old Mrs. Paley, having woken hungry
but without her spectacles, was summoning her maid to find the
biscuit-box. The maid having answered the bell, drearily respectful
even at this hour though muffled in a mackintosh, the passage
was left in silence. Downstairs all was empty and dark; but on
the upper floor a light still burnt in the room where the boots
had dropped so heavily above Miss Allan's head. Here was the gentleman
who, a few hours previously, in the shade of the curtain, had
seemed to consist entirely of legs. Deep in an arm-chair he was
reading the third volume of Gibbon's <em>History</em> <em>of</em>
<em>the</em> <em>Decline</em> <em>and</em> <em>Fall</em> <em>of</em>
<em>Rome</em> by candle-light. As he read he knocked the ash automatically,
now and again, from his cigarette and turned the page, while a
whole procession of splendid sentences entered his capacious brow
and went marching through his brain in order. It seemed likely
that this process might continue for an hour or more, until the
entire regiment had shifted its quarters, had not the door opened,
and the young man, who was inclined to be stout, come in with
large naked feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, Hirst, what I forgot to say was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Two minutes," said Hirst, raising his finger.</p>

<p>He safely stowed away the last words of the paragraph.</p>

<p>"What was it you forgot to say?" he asked.</p>

<p>"D'you think you <em>do</em> make enough allowance for feelings?"
asked Mr. Hewet. He had again forgotten what he had meant to say.</p>

<p>After intense contemplation of the immaculate Gibbon Mr. Hirst
smiled at the question of his friend. He laid aside his book and
considered.</p>

<p>"I should call yours a singularly untidy mind," he observed.
"Feelings? Aren't they just what we do allow for? We put love
up there, and all the rest somewhere down below." With his left
hand he indicated the top of a pyramid, and with his right the
base.</p>

<p>"But you didn't get out of bed to tell me that," he added severely.</p>

<p>"I got out of bed," said Hewet vaguely, "merely to talk I suppose."</p>

<p>"Meanwhile I shall undress," said Hirst. When naked of all but
his shirt, and bent over the basin, Mr. Hirst no longer impressed
one with the majesty of his intellect, but with the pathos of
his young yet ugly body, for he stooped, and he was so thin that
there were dark lines between the different bones of his neck
and shoulders.</p>

<p>"Women interest me," said Hewet, who, sitting on the bed with
his chin resting on his knees, paid no attention to the undressing
of Mr. Hirst.</p>

<p>"They're so stupid," said Hirst. "You're sitting on my pyjamas."</p>

<p>"I suppose they <em>are</em> stupid?" Hewet wondered.</p>

<p>"There can't be two opinions about that, I imagine," said Hirst,
hopping briskly across the room, "unless you're in love&mdash;that
fat woman Warrington?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"Not one fat woman&mdash;all fat women," Hewet sighed.</p>

<p>"The women I saw to-night were not fat," said Hirst, who was
taking advantage of Hewet's company to cut his toe-nails.</p>

<p>"Describe them," said Hewet.</p>

<p>"You know I can't describe things!" said Hirst. "They were much
like other women, I should think. They always are."</p>

<p>"No; that's where we differ," said Hewet. "I say everything's
different. No two people are in the least the same. Take you and
me now."</p>

<p>"So I used to think once," said Hirst. "But now they're all types.
Don't take us,&mdash;take this hotel. You could draw circles round
the whole lot of them, and they'd never stray outside."</p>

<p>("You can kill a hen by doing that"), Hewet murmured.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hughling Elliot, Mrs. Hughling Elliot, Miss Allan, Mr. and
Mrs. Thornbury&mdash;one circle," Hirst continued. "Miss Warrington,
Mr. Arthur Venning, Mr. Perrott, Evelyn M. another circle; then
there are a whole lot of natives; finally ourselves."</p>

<p>"Are we all alone in our circle?" asked Hewet.</p>

<p>"Quite alone," said Hirst. "You try to get out, but you can't.
You only make a mess of things by trying."</p>

<p>"I'm not a hen in a circle," said Hewet. "I'm a dove on a tree-top."</p>

<p>"I wonder if this is what they call an ingrowing toe-nail?" said
Hirst, examining the big toe on his left foot.</p>

<p>"I flit from branch to branch," continued Hewet. "The world is
profoundly pleasant." He lay back on the bed, upon his arms.</p>

<p>"I wonder if it's really nice to be as vague as you are?" asked
Hirst, looking at him. "It's the lack of continuity&mdash;that's what's
so odd about you," he went on. "At the age of twenty-seven, which
is nearly thirty, you seem to have drawn no conclusions. A party
of old women excites you still as though you were three."</p>

<p>Hewet contemplated the angular young man who was neatly brushing
the rims of his toe-nails into the fire-place in silence for a
moment.</p>

<p>"I respect you, Hirst," he remarked.</p>

<p>"I envy you&mdash;some things," said Hirst. "One: your capacity for
not thinking; two: people like you better than they like me. Women
like you, I suppose."</p>

<p>"I wonder whether that isn't really what matters most?" said
Hewet. Lying now flat on the bed he waved his hand in vague circles
above him.</p>

<p>"Of course it is," said Hirst. "But that's not the difficulty.
The difficulty is, isn't it, to find an appropriate object?"</p>

<p>"There are no female hens in your circle?" asked Hewet.</p>

<p>"Not the ghost of one," said Hirst.</p>

<p>Although they had known each other for three years Hirst had
never yet heard the true story of Hewet's loves. In general conversation
it was taken for granted that they were many, but in private the
subject was allowed to lapse. The fact that he had money enough
to do no work, and that he had left Cambridge after two terms
owing to a difference with the authorities, and had then travelled
and drifted, made his life strange at many points where his friends'
lives were much of a piece.</p>

<p>"I don't see your circles &mdash;I don't see them," Hewet continued.
"I see a thing like a teetotum spinning in and out&mdash;knocking into
things&mdash;dashing from side to side&mdash;collecting numbers&mdash;more and
more and more, till the whole place is thick with them. Round
and round they go&mdash;out there, over the rim&mdash;out of sight."</p>

<p>His fingers showed that the waltzing teetotums had spun over
the edge of the counterpane and fallen off the bed into infinity.</p>

<p>"Could you contemplate three weeks alone in this hotel?" asked
Hirst, after a moment's pause.</p>

<p>Hewet proceeded to think.</p>

<p>"The truth of it is that one never is alone, and one never is
in company," he concluded.</p>

<p>"Meaning?" said Hirst.</p>

<p>"Meaning? Oh, something about bubbles&mdash;auras&mdash;what d'you call
'em? You can't see my bubble; I can't see yours; all we see of
each other is a speck, like the wick in the middle of that flame.
The flame goes about with us everywhere; it's not ourselves exactly,
but what we feel; the world is short, or people mainly; all kinds
of people."</p>

<p>"A nice streaky bubble yours must be!" said Hirst.</p>

<p>"And supposing my bubble could run into some one else's bubble&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And they both burst?" put in Hirst.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then&mdash;then&mdash;" pondered Hewet, as if to himself, "it would
be an e-nor-mous world," he said, stretching his arms to their
full width, as though even so they could hardly clasp the billowy
universe, for when he was with Hirst he always felt unusually
sanguine and vague.</p>

<p>"I don't think you altogether as foolish as I used to, Hewet,"
said Hirst. "You don't know what you mean but you try to say it."</p>

<p>"But aren't you enjoying yourself here?" asked Hewet.</p>

<p>"On the whole&mdash;yes," said Hirst. "I like observing people. I
like looking at things. This country is amazingly beautiful. Did
you notice how the top of the mountain turned yellow to-night?
Really we must take our lunch and spend the day out. You're getting
disgustingly fat." He pointed at the calf of Hewet's bare leg.</p>

<p>"We'll get up an expedition," said Hewet energetically. "We'll
ask the entire hotel. We'll hire donkeys and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!" said Hirst, "do shut it! I can see Miss Warrington
and Miss Allan and Mrs. Elliot and the rest squatting on the stones
and quacking, 'How jolly!'"</p>

<p>"We'll ask Venning and Perrott and Miss Murgatroyd&mdash;every one
we can lay hands on," went on Hewet. "What's the name of the little
old grasshopper with the eyeglasses? Pepper? &mdash;Pepper shall
lead us."</p>

<p>"Thank God, you'll never get the donkeys," said Hirst.</p>

<p>"I must make a note of that," said Hewet, slowly dropping his
feet to the floor. "Hirst escorts Miss Warrington; Pepper advances
alone on a white ass; provisions equally distributed&mdash;or shall
we hire a mule? The matrons&mdash;there's Mrs. Paley, by Jove!&mdash;share
a carriage."</p>

<p>"That's where you'll go wrong," said Hirst. "Putting virgins
among matrons."</p>

<p>"How long should you think that an expedition like that would
take, Hirst?" asked Hewet.</p>

<p>"From twelve to sixteen hours I would say," said Hirst. "The
time usually occupied by a first confinement."</p>

<p>"It will need considerable organisation," said Hewet. He was
now padding softly round the room, and stopped to stir the books
on the table. They lay heaped one upon another.</p>

<p>"We shall want some poets too," he remarked. "Not Gibbon; no;
d'you happen to have <em>Modern</em> <em>Love</em> or <em>John</em>
<em>Donne</em>? You see, I contemplate pauses when people get
tired of looking at the view, and then it would be nice to read
something rather difficult aloud."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Paley <em>will</em> enjoy herself," said Hirst.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Paley will enjoy it certainly," said Hewet. "It's one of
the saddest things I know&mdash;the way elderly ladies cease to read
poetry. And yet how appropriate this is:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
I speak as one who plumbs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Life's dim profound,<br/>
One who at length can sound<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear views and certain.

</p>
<p>
But&mdash;after love what comes?<br/>
A scene that lours,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A few sad vacant hours,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, the Curtain.

</p>
</div>
<p>I daresay Mrs. Paley is the only one of us who can really understand
that."</p>

<p>"We'll ask her," said Hirst. "Please, Hewet, if you must go to
bed, draw my curtain. Few things distress me more than the moonlight."</p>

<p>Hewet retreated, pressing the poems of Thomas Hardy beneath his
arm, and in their beds next door to each other both the young
men were soon asleep.</p>

<p>Between the extinction of Hewet's candle and the rising of a
dusky Spanish boy who was the first to survey the desolation of
the hotel in the early morning, a few hours of silence intervened.
One could almost hear a hundred people breathing deeply, and however
wakeful and restless it would have been hard to escape sleep in
the middle of so much sleep. Looking out of the windows, there
was only darkness to be seen. All over the shadowed half of the
world people lay prone, and a few flickering lights in empty streets
marked the places where their cities were built. Red and yellow
omnibuses were crowding each other in Piccadilly; sumptuous women
were rocking at a standstill; but here in the darkness an owl
flitted from tree to tree, and when the breeze lifted the branches
the moon flashed as if it were a torch. Until all people should
awake again the houseless animals were abroad, the tigers and
the stags, and the elephants coming down in the darkness to drink
at pools. The wind at night blowing over the hills and woods was
purer and fresher than the wind by day, and the earth, robbed
of detail, more mysterious than the earth coloured and divided
by roads and fields. For six hours this profound beauty existed,
and then as the east grew whiter and whiter the ground swam to
the surface, the roads were revealed, the smoke rose and the people
stirred, and the sun shone upon the windows of the hotel at Santa
Marina until they were uncurtained, and the gong blaring all through
the house gave notice of breakfast.</p>

<p>Directly breakfast was over, the ladies as usual circled vaguely,
picking up papers and putting them down again, about the hall.</p>

<p>"And what are you going to do to-day?" asked Mrs. Elliot drifting
up against Miss Warrington.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elliot, the wife of Hughling the Oxford Don, was a short
woman, whose expression was habitually plaintive. Her eyes moved
from thing to thing as though they never found anything sufficiently
pleasant to rest upon for any length of time.</p>

<p>"I'm going to try to get Aunt Emma out into the town," said Susan.
"She's not seen a thing yet."</p>

<p>"I call it so spirited of her at her age," said Mrs. Elliot,
"coming all this way from her own fireside."</p>

<p>"Yes, we always tell her she'll die on board ship," Susan replied.
"She was born on one," she added.</p>

<p>"In the old days," said Mrs. Elliot, "a great many people were.
I always pity the poor women so! We've got a lot to complain of!"
She shook her head. Her eyes wandered about the table, and she
remarked irrelevantly, "The poor little Queen of Holland! Newspaper
reporters practically, one may say, at her bedroom door!"</p>

<p>"Were you talking of the Queen of Holland?" said the pleasant
voice of Miss Allan, who was searching for the thick pages of
<em>The</em> <em>Times</em> among a litter of thin foreign sheets.</p>

<p>"I always envy any one who lives in such an excessively flat
country," she remarked.</p>

<p>"How very strange!" said Mrs. Elliot. "I find a flat country
so depressing."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you can't be very happy here then, Miss Allan," said
Susan.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," said Miss Allan, "I am exceedingly fond of
mountains." Perceiving <em>The</em> <em>Times</em> at some distance,
she moved off to secure it.</p>

<p>"Well, I must find my husband," said Mrs. Elliot, fidgeting away.</p>

<p>"And I must go to my aunt," said Miss Warrington, and taking
up the duties of the day they moved away.</p>

<p>Whether the flimsiness of foreign sheets and the coarseness of
their type is any proof of frivolity and ignorance, there is no
doubt that English people scarce consider news read there as news,
any more than a programme bought from a man in the street inspires
confidence in what it says. A very respectable elderly pair, having
inspected the long tables of newspapers, did not think it worth
their while to read more than the headlines.</p>

<p>"The debate on the fifteenth should have reached us by now,"
Mrs. Thornbury murmured. Mr. Thornbury, who was beautifully clean
and had red rubbed into his handsome worn face like traces of
paint on a weather-beaten wooden figure, looked over his glasses
and saw that Miss Allan had <em>The</em> <em>Times</em>.</p>

<p>The couple therefore sat themselves down in arm-chairs and waited.</p>

<p>"Ah, there's Mr. Hewet," said Mrs. Thornbury. "Mr. Hewet," she
continued, "do come and sit by us. I was telling my husband how
much you reminded me of a dear old friend of mine &mdash;Mary
Umpleby. She was a most delightful woman, I assure you. She grew
roses. We used to stay with her in the old days."</p>

<p>"No young man likes to have it said that he resembles an elderly
spinster," said Mr. Thornbury.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," said Mr. Hewet, "I always think it a compliment
to remind people of some one else. But Miss Umpleby&mdash;why did she
grow roses?"</p>

<p>"Ah, poor thing," said Mrs. Thornbury, "that's a long story.
She had gone through dreadful sorrows. At one time I think she
would have lost her senses if it hadn't been for her garden. The
soil was very much against her&mdash;a blessing in disguise; she had
to be up at dawn&mdash;out in all weathers. And then there are creatures
that eat roses. But she triumphed. She always did. She was a brave
soul." She sighed deeply but at the same time with resignation.</p>

<p>"I did not realise that I was monopolising the paper," said Miss
Allan, coming up to them.</p>

<p>"We were so anxious to read about the debate," said Mrs. Thornbury,
accepting it on behalf of her husband.</p>

<p>"One doesn't realise how interesting a debate can be until one
has sons in the navy. My interests are equally balanced, though;
I have sons in the army too; and one son who makes speeches at
the Union&mdash;my baby!"</p>

<p>"Hirst would know him, I expect," said Hewet.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hirst has such an interesting face," said Mrs. Thornbury.
"But I feel one ought to be very clever to talk to him. Well,
William?" she enquired, for Mr. Thornbury grunted.</p>

<p>"They're making a mess of it," said Mr. Thornbury. He had reached
the second column of the report, a spasmodic column, for the Irish
members had been brawling three weeks ago at Westminster over
a question of naval efficiency. After a disturbed paragraph or
two, the column of print once more ran smoothly.</p>

<p>"You have read it?" Mrs. Thornbury asked Miss Allan.</p>

<p>"No, I am ashamed to say I have only read about the discoveries
in Crete," said Miss Allan.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I would give so much to realise the ancient world!"
cried Mrs. Thornbury. "Now that we old people are alone,&mdash;we're
on our second honeymoon, &mdash;I am really going to put myself
to school again. After all we are <em>founded</em> on the past,
aren't we, Mr. Hewet? My soldier son says that there is still
a great deal to be learnt from Hannibal. One ought to know so
much more than one does. Somehow when I read the paper, I begin
with the debates first, and, before I've done, the door always
opens&mdash;we're a very large party at home&mdash;and so one never does
think enough about the ancients and all they've done for us. But
<em>you</em> begin at the beginning, Miss Allan."</p>

<p>"When I think of the Greeks I think of them as naked black men,"
said Miss Allan, "which is quite incorrect, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"And you, Mr. Hirst?" said Mrs. Thornbury, perceiving that the
gaunt young man was near. "I'm sure you read everything."</p>

<p>"I confine myself to cricket and crime," said Hirst. "The worst
of coming from the upper classes," he continued, "is that one's
friends are never killed in railway accidents."</p>

<p>Mr. Thornbury threw down the paper, and emphatically dropped
his eyeglasses. The sheets fell in the middle of the group, and
were eyed by them all.</p>

<p>"It's not gone well?" asked his wife solicitously.</p>

<p>Hewet picked up one sheet and read, "A lady was walking yesterday
in the streets of Westminster when she perceived a cat in the
window of a deserted house. The famished animal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall be out of it anyway," Mr. Thornbury interrupted peevishly.</p>

<p>"Cats are often forgotten," Miss Allan remarked.</p>

<p>"Remember, William, the Prime Minister has reserved his answer,"
said Mrs. Thornbury.</p>

<p>"At the age of eighty, Mr. Joshua Harris of Eeles Park, Brondesbury,
has had a son," said Hirst.</p>

<p>". . . The famished animal, which had been noticed by workmen
for some days, was rescued, but&mdash;by Jove! it bit the man's hand
to pieces!"</p>

<p>"Wild with hunger, I suppose," commented Miss Allan.</p>

<p>"You're all neglecting the chief advantage of being abroad,"
said Mr. Hughling Elliot, who had joined the group. "You might
read your news in French, which is equivalent to reading no news
at all."</p>

<p>Mr. Elliot had a profound knowledge of Coptic, which he concealed
as far as possible, and quoted French phrases so exquisitely that
it was hard to believe that he could also speak the ordinary tongue.
He had an immense respect for the French.</p>

<p>"Coming?" he asked the two young men. "We ought to start before
it's really hot."</p>

<p>"I beg of you not to walk in the heat, Hugh," his wife pleaded,
giving him an angular parcel enclosing half a chicken and some
raisins.</p>

<p>"Hewet will be our barometer," said Mr. Elliot. "He will melt
before I shall." Indeed, if so much as a drop had melted off his
spare ribs, the bones would have lain bare. The ladies were left
alone now, surrounding <em>The</em> <em>Times</em> which lay upon
the floor. Miss Allan looked at her father's watch.</p>

<p>"Ten minutes to eleven," she observed.</p>

<p>"Work?" asked Mrs. Thornbury.</p>

<p>"Work," replied Miss Allan.</p>

<p>"What a fine creature she is!" murmured Mrs. Thornbury, as the
square figure in its manly coat withdrew.</p>

<p>"And I'm sure she has a hard life," sighed Mrs. Elliot.</p>

<p>"Oh, it <em>is</em> a hard life," said Mrs. Thornbury. "Unmarried
women&mdash;earning their livings&mdash;it's the hardest life of all."</p>

<p>"Yet she seems pretty cheerful," said Mrs. Elliot.</p>

<p>"It must be very interesting," said Mrs. Thornbury. "I envy her
her knowledge."</p>

<p>"But that isn't what women want," said Mrs. Elliot.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's all a great many can hope to have," sighed Mrs.
Thornbury. "I believe that there are more of us than ever now.
Sir Harley Lethbridge was telling me only the other day how difficult
it is to find boys for the navy&mdash;partly because of their teeth,
it is true. And I have heard young women talk quite openly of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dreadful, dreadful!" exclaimed Mrs. Elliot. "The crown, as one
may call it, of a woman's life. I, who know what it is to be childless&mdash;"
she sighed and ceased.</p>

<p>"But we must not be hard," said Mrs. Thornbury. "The conditions
are so much changed since I was a young woman."</p>

<p>"Surely <em>maternity</em> does not change," said Mrs. Elliot.</p>

<p>"In some ways we can learn a great deal from the young," said
Mrs. Thornbury. "I learn so much from my own daughters."</p>

<p>"I believe that Hughling really doesn't mind," said Mrs. Elliot.
"But then he has his work."</p>

<p>"Women without children can do so much for the children of others,"
observed Mrs. Thornbury gently.</p>

<p>"I sketch a great deal," said Mrs. Elliot, "but that isn't really
an occupation. It's so disconcerting to find girls just beginning
doing better than one does oneself! And nature's difficult&mdash;very
difficult!"</p>

<p>"Are there not institutions&mdash;clubs&mdash;that you could help?" asked
Mrs. Thornbury.</p>

<p>"They are so exhausting," said Mrs. Elliot. "I look strong, because
of my colour; but I'm not; the youngest of eleven never is."</p>

<p>"If the mother is careful before," said Mrs. Thornbury judicially,
"there is no reason why the size of the family should make any
difference. And there is no training like the training that brothers
and sisters give each other. I am sure of that. I have seen it
with my own children. My eldest boy Ralph, for instance&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Elliot was inattentive to the elder lady's experience,
and her eyes wandered about the hall.</p>

<p>"My mother had two miscarriages, I know," she said suddenly.
"The first because she met one of those great dancing bears&mdash;they
shouldn't be allowed; the other&mdash;it was a horrid story&mdash;our cook
had a child and there was a dinner party. So I put my dyspepsia
down to that."</p>

<p>"And a miscarriage is so much worse than a confinement," Mrs.
Thornbury murmured absentmindedly, adjusting her spectacles and
picking up <em>The</em> <em>Times</em>. Mrs. Elliot rose and fluttered
away.</p>

<p>When she had heard what one of the million voices speaking in
the paper had to say, and noticed that a cousin of hers had married
a clergyman at Minehead&mdash;ignoring the drunken women, the golden
animals of Crete, the movements of battalions, the dinners, the
reforms, the fires, the indignant, the learned and benevolent,
Mrs. Thornbury went upstairs to write a letter for the mail.</p>

<p>The paper lay directly beneath the clock, the two together seeming
to represent stability in a changing world. Mr. Perrott passed
through; Mr. Venning poised for a second on the edge of a table.
Mrs. Paley was wheeled past. Susan followed. Mr. Venning strolled
after her. Portuguese military families, their clothes suggesting
late rising in untidy bedrooms, trailed across, attended by confidential
nurses carrying noisy children. As midday drew on, and the sun
beat straight upon the roof, an eddy of great flies droned in
a circle; iced drinks were served under the palms; the long blinds
were pulled down with a shriek, turning all the light yellow.
The clock now had a silent hall to tick in, and an audience of
four or five somnolent merchants. By degrees white figures with
shady hats came in at the door, admitting a wedge of the hot summer
day, and shutting it out again. After resting in the dimness for
a minute, they went upstairs. Simultaneously, the clock wheezed
one, and the gong sounded, beginning softly, working itself into
a frenzy, and ceasing. There was a pause. Then all those who had
gone upstairs came down; cripples came, planting both feet on
the same step lest they should slip; prim little girls came, holding
the nurse's finger; fat old men came still buttoning waistcoats.
The gong had been sounded in the garden, and by degrees recumbent
figures rose and strolled in to eat, since the time had come for
them to feed again. There were pools and bars of shade in the
garden even at midday, where two or three visitors could lie working
or talking at their ease.</p>

<p>Owing to the heat of the day, luncheon was generally a silent
meal, when people observed their neighbors and took stock of any
new faces there might be, hazarding guesses as to who they were
and what they did. Mrs. Paley, although well over seventy and
crippled in the legs, enjoyed her food and the peculiarities of
her fellow-beings. She was seated at a small table with Susan.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't like to say what <em>she</em> is!" she chuckled,
surveying a tall woman dressed conspicuously in white, with paint
in the hollows of her cheeks, who was always late, and always
attended by a shabby female follower, at which remark Susan blushed,
and wondered why her aunt said such things.</p>

<p>Lunch went on methodically, until each of the seven courses was
left in fragments and the fruit was merely a toy, to be peeled
and sliced as a child destroys a daisy, petal by petal. The food
served as an extinguisher upon any faint flame of the human spirit
that might survive the midday heat, but Susan sat in her room
afterwards, turning over and over the delightful fact that Mr.
Venning had come to her in the garden, and had sat there quite
half an hour while she read aloud to her aunt. Men and women sought
different corners where they could lie unobserved, and from two
to four it might be said without exaggeration that the hotel was
inhabited by bodies without souls. Disastrous would have been
the result if a fire or a death had suddenly demanded something
heroic of human nature, but tragedies come in the hungry hours.
Towards four o'clock the human spirit again began to lick the
body, as a flame licks a black promontory of coal. Mrs. Paley
felt it unseemly to open her toothless jaw so widely, though there
was no one near, and Mrs. Elliot surveyed her found flushed face
anxiously in the looking-glass.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, having removed the traces of sleep, they
met each other in the hall, and Mrs. Paley observed that she was
going to have her tea.</p>

<p>"You like your tea too, don't you?" she said, and invited Mrs.
Elliot, whose husband was still out, to join her at a special
table which she had placed for her under a tree.</p>

<p>"A little silver goes a long way in this country," she chuckled.</p>

<p>She sent Susan back to fetch another cup.</p>

<p>"They have such excellent biscuits here," she said, contemplating
a plateful. "Not sweet biscuits, which I don't like&mdash;dry biscuits
. . . Have you been sketching?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've done two or three little daubs," said Mrs. Elliot,
speaking rather louder than usual. "But it's so difficult after
Oxfordshire, where there are so many trees. The light's so strong
here. Some people admire it, I know, but I find it very fatiguing."</p>

<p>"I really don't need cooking, Susan," said Mrs. Paley, when her
niece returned. "I must trouble you to move me." Everything had
to be moved. Finally the old lady was placed so that the light
wavered over her, as though she were a fish in a net. Susan poured
out tea, and was just remarking that they were having hot weather
in Wiltshire too, when Mr. Venning asked whether he might join
them.</p>

<p>"It's so nice to find a young man who doesn't despise tea," said
Mrs. Paley, regaining her good humour. "One of my nephews the
other day asked for a glass of sherry&mdash;at five o'clock! I told
him he could get it at the public house round the corner, but
not in my drawing room."</p>

<p>"I'd rather go without lunch than tea," said Mr. Venning. "That's
not strictly true. I want both."</p>

<p>Mr. Venning was a dark young man, about thirty-two years of age,
very slapdash and confident in his manner, although at this moment
obviously a little excited. His friend Mr. Perrott was a barrister,
and as Mr. Perrott refused to go anywhere without Mr. Venning
it was necessary, when Mr. Perrott came to Santa Marina about
a Company, for Mr. Venning to come too. He was a barrister also,
but he loathed a profession which kept him indoors over books,
and directly his widowed mother died he was going, so he confided
to Susan, to take up flying seriously, and become partner in a
large business for making aeroplanes. The talk rambled on. It
dealt, of course, with the beauties and singularities of the place,
the streets, the people, and the quantities of unowned yellow
dogs.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it dreadfully cruel the way they treat dogs
in this country?" asked Mrs. Paley.</p>

<p>"I'd have 'em all shot," said Mr. Venning.</p>

<p>"Oh, but the darling puppies," said Susan.</p>

<p>"Jolly little chaps," said Mr. Venning. "Look here, you've got
nothing to eat." A great wedge of cake was handed Susan on the
point of a trembling knife. Her hand trembled too as she took
it.</p>

<p>"I have such a dear dog at home," said Mrs. Elliot.</p>

<p>"My parrot can't stand dogs," said Mrs. Paley, with the air of
one making a confidence. "I always suspect that he (or she) was
teased by a dog when I was abroad."</p>

<p>"You didn't get far this morning, Miss Warrington," said Mr.
Venning.</p>

<p>"It was hot," she answered. Their conversation became private,
owing to Mrs. Paley's deafness and the long sad history which
Mrs. Elliot had embarked upon of a wire-haired terrier, white
with just one black spot, belonging to an uncle of hers, which
had committed suicide. "Animals do commit suicide," she sighed,
as if she asserted a painful fact.</p>

<p>"Couldn't we explore the town this evening?" Mr. Venning suggested.</p>

<p>"My aunt&mdash;" Susan began.</p>

<p>"You deserve a holiday," he said. "You're always doing things
for other people."</p>

<p>"But that's my life," she said, under cover of refilling the
teapot.</p>

<p>"That's no one's life," he returned, "no young person's. You'll
come?"</p>

<p>"I should like to come," she murmured.</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs. Elliot looked up and exclaimed, "Oh, Hugh!
He's bringing some one," she added.</p>

<p>"He would like some tea," said Mrs. Paley. "Susan, run and get
some cups&mdash;there are the two young men."</p>

<p>"We're thirsting for tea," said Mr. Elliot. "You know Mr. Ambrose,
Hilda? We met on the hill."</p>

<p>"He dragged me in," said Ridley, "or I should have been ashamed.
I'm dusty and dirty and disagreeable." He pointed to his boots
which were white with dust, while a dejected flower drooping in
his buttonhole, like an exhausted animal over a gate, added to
the effect of length and untidiness. He was introduced to the
others. Mr. Hewet and Mr. Hirst brought chairs, and tea began
again, Susan pouring cascades of water from pot to pot, always
cheerfully, and with the competence of long use.</p>

<p>"My wife's brother," Ridley explained to Hilda, whom he failed
to remember, "has a house here, which he has lent us. I was sitting
on a rock thinking of nothing at all when Elliot started up like
a fairy in a pantomime."</p>

<p>"Our chicken got into the salt," Hewet said dolefully to Susan.
"Nor is it true that bananas include moisture as well as sustenance."</p>

<p>Hirst was already drinking.</p>

<p>"We've been cursing you," said Ridley in answer to Mrs. Elliot's
kind enquiries about his wife. "You tourists eat up all the eggs,
Helen tells me. That's an eye-sore too"&mdash;he nodded his head at
the hotel. "Disgusting luxury, I call it. We live with pigs in
the drawing-room."</p>

<p>"The food is not at all what it ought to be, considering the
price," said Mrs. Paley seriously. "But unless one goes to a hotel
where is one to go to?"</p>

<p>"Stay at home," said Ridley. "I often wish I had! Everyone ought
to stay at home. But, of course, they won't."</p>

<p>Mrs. Paley conceived a certain grudge against Ridley, who seemed
to be criticising her habits after an acquaintance of five minutes.</p>

<p>"I believe in foreign travel myself," she stated, "if one knows
one's native land, which I think I can honestly say I do. I should
not allow any one to travel until they had visited Kent and Dorsetshire
&mdash;Kent for the hops, and Dorsetshire for its old stone cottages.
There is nothing to compare with them here."</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;I always think that some people like the flat and
other people like the downs," said Mrs. Elliot rather vaguely.</p>

<p>Hirst, who had been eating and drinking without interruption,
now lit a cigarette, and observed, "Oh, but we're all agreed by
this time that nature's a mistake. She's either very ugly, appallingly
uncomfortable, or absolutely terrifying. I don't know which alarms
me most&mdash;a cow or a tree. I once met a cow in a field by night.
The creature looked at me. I assure you it turned my hair grey.
It's a disgrace that the animals should be allowed to go at large."</p>

<p>"And what did the cow think of <em>him</em>?" Venning mumbled
to Susan, who immediately decided in her own mind that Mr. Hirst
was a dreadful young man, and that although he had such an air
of being clever he probably wasn't as clever as Arthur, in the
ways that really matter.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it Wilde who discovered the fact that nature makes no
allowance for hip-bones?" enquired Hughling Elliot. He knew by
this time exactly what scholarships and distinction Hirst enjoyed,
and had formed a very high opinion of his capacities.</p>

<p>But Hirst merely drew his lips together very tightly and made
no reply.</p>

<p>Ridley conjectured that it was now permissible for him to take
his leave. Politeness required him to thank Mrs. Elliot for his
tea, and to add, with a wave of his hand, "You must come up and
see us."</p>

<p>The wave included both Hirst and Hewet, and Hewet answered, "I
should like it immensely."</p>

<p>The party broke up, and Susan, who had never felt so happy in
her life, was just about to start for her walk in the town with
Arthur, when Mrs. Paley beckoned her back. She could not understand
from the book how Double Demon patience is played; and suggested
that if they sat down and worked it out together it would fill
up the time nicely before dinner.</p>
