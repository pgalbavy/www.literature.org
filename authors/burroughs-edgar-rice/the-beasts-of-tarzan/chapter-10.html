As the warriors, clustered thick about Tarzan and Sheeta,
realized that it was a flesh-and-blood panther that had
interrupted their dance of death, they took heart a trifle,
for in the face of all those circling spears even the
mighty Sheeta would be doomed.
<P>
Rokoff was urging the chief to have his spearmen launch
their missiles, and the black was upon the instant of issuing
the command, when his eyes strayed beyond Tarzan,
following the gaze of the ape-man.
<P>
With a yell of terror the chief turned and fled toward the
village gate, and as his people looked to see the cause of his
fright, they too took to their heels--for there, lumbering down
upon them, their huge forms exaggerated by the play of
moonlight and camp fire, came the hideous apes of Akut.
<P>
The instant the natives turned to flee the ape-man's savage
cry rang out above the shrieks of the blacks, and in answer
to it Sheeta and the apes leaped growling after the fugitives.  
Some of the warriors turned to battle with their enraged
antagonists, but before the fiendish ferocity of the fierce beasts
they went down to bloody death.
<P>
Others were dragged down in their flight, and it was not
until the village was empty and the last of the blacks had
disappeared into the bush that Tarzan was able to recall his
savage pack to his side.  Then it was that he discovered to his
chagrin that he could not make one of them, not even the
comparatively intelligent Akut, understand that he wished to
be freed from the bonds that held him to the stake.
<P>
In time, of course, the idea would filter through their thick
skulls, but in the meanwhile many things might happen--the
blacks might return in force to regain their village; the whites
might readily pick them all off with their rifles from the
surrounding trees; he might even starve to death before the dull-
witted apes realized that he wished them to gnaw through his bonds.
<P>
As for Sheeta--the great cat understood even less than the
apes; but yet Tarzan could not but marvel at the remarkable
characteristics this beast had evidenced.  That it felt real
affection for him there seemed little doubt, for now that the
blacks were disposed of it walked slowly back and forth
about the stake, rubbing its sides against the ape-man's legs
and purring like a contented tabby.  That it had gone of its
own volition to bring the balance of the pack to his rescue,
Tarzan could not doubt.  His Sheeta was indeed a jewel among beasts.
<P>
Mugambi's absence worried the ape-man not a little.  
He attempted to learn from Akut what had become of the black,
fearing that the beasts, freed from the restraint of Tarzan's
presence, might have fallen upon the man and devoured him;
but to all his questions the great ape but pointed back in the
direction from which they had come out of the jungle.
<P>
The night passed with Tarzan still fast bound to the stake,
and shortly after dawn his fears were realized in the discovery
of naked black figures moving stealthily just within the edge of
the jungle about the village.  The blacks were returning.
<P>
With daylight their courage would be equal to the demands
of a charge upon the handful of beasts that had routed them
from their rightful abodes.  The result of the encounter seemed
foregone if the savages could curb their superstitious terror,
for against their overwhelming numbers, their long spears
and poisoned arrows, the panther and the apes could not be
expected to survive a really determined attack.
<P>
That the blacks were preparing for a charge became apparent
a few moments later, when they commenced to show
themselves in force upon the edge of the clearing, dancing
and jumping about as they waved their spears and shouted
taunts and fierce warcries toward the village.
<P>
These manoeuvres Tarzan knew would continue until the blacks
had worked themselves into a state of hysterical courage
sufficient to sustain them for a short charge toward the
village, and even though he doubted that they would reach it
at the first attempt, he believed that at the second or the third
they would swarm through the gateway, when the outcome
could not be aught than the extermination of Tarzan's bold,
but unarmed and undisciplined, defenders.
<P>
Even as he had guessed, the first charge carried the howling
warriors but a short distance into the open--a shrill, weird
challenge from the ape-man being all that was necessary to
send them scurrying back to the bush.  For half an hour they
pranced and yelled their courage to the sticking-point, and
again essayed a charge.
<P>
This time they came quite to the village gate, but when
Sheeta and the hideous apes leaped among them they turned
screaming in terror, and again fled to the jungle.
<P>
Again was the dancing and shouting repeated.  This time
Tarzan felt no doubt they would enter the village and
complete the work that a handful of determined white men would
have carried to a successful conclusion at the first attempt.
<P>
To have rescue come so close only to be thwarted because
he could not make his poor, savage friends understand
precisely what he wanted of them was most irritating, but he
could not find it in his heart to place blame upon them.  
They had done their best, and now he was sure they would doubtless
remain to die with him in a fruitless effort to defend him.
<P>
The blacks were already preparing for the charge.  A few
individuals had advanced a short distance toward the village
and were exhorting the others to follow them.  In a moment
the whole savage horde would be racing across the clearing.
<P>
Tarzan thought only of the little child somewhere in this
cruel, relentless wilderness.  His heart ached for the son that
he might no longer seek to save--that and the realization of
Jane's suffering were all that weighed upon his brave spirit
in these that he thought his last moments of life.  Succour, all
that he could hope for, had come to him in the instant of his
extremity--and failed.  There was nothing further for which
to hope.
<P>
The blacks were half-way across the clearing when Tarzan's
attention was attracted by the actions of one of the apes.
The beast was glaring toward one of the huts.  Tarzan followed
his gaze.  To his infinite relief and delight he saw the
stalwart form of Mugambi racing toward him.
<P>
The huge black was panting heavily as though from strenuous
physical exertion and nervous excitement.  He rushed
to Tarzan's side, and as the first of the savages reached the
village gate the native's knife severed the last of the cords
that bound Tarzan to the stake.
<P>
In the street lay the corpses of the savages that had fallen
before the pack the night before.  From one of these Tarzan
seized a spear and knob stick, and with Mugambi at his side
and the snarling pack about him, he met the natives as they
poured through the gate.
<P>
Fierce and terrible was the battle that ensued, but at last the
savages were routed, more by terror, perhaps, at sight of a
black man and a white fighting in company with a panther and
the huge fierce apes of Akut, than because of their inability
to overcome the relatively small force that opposed them.
<P>
One prisoner fell into the hands of Tarzan, and him the
ape-man questioned in an effort to learn what had become of
Rokoff and his party.  Promised his liberty in return for the
information, the black told all he knew concerning the movements
of the Russian.
<P>
It seemed that early in the morning their chief had attempted
to prevail upon the whites to return with him to the
village and with their guns destroy the ferocious pack that
had taken possession of it, but Rokoff appeared to entertain
even more fears of the giant white man and his strange
companions than even the blacks themselves.
<P>
Upon no conditions would he consent to returning even
within sight of the village.  Instead, he took his party
hurriedly to the river, where they stole a number of canoes the
blacks had hidden there.  The last that had been seen of them
they had been paddling strongly up-stream, their porters from
Kaviri's village wielding the blades.
<P>
So once more Tarzan of the Apes with his hideous pack
took up his search for the ape-man's son and the pursuit of
his abductor.
<P>
For weary days they followed through an almost uninhabited
country, only to learn at last that they were upon the
wrong trail.  The little band had been reduced by three, for
three of Akut's apes had fallen in the fighting at the village.  
Now, with Akut, there were five great apes, and Sheeta was
there--and Mugambi and Tarzan.
<P>
The ape-man no longer heard rumors even of the three
who had preceded Rokoff--the white man and woman and
the child.  Who the man and woman were he could not guess,
but that the child was his was enough to keep him hot upon
the trail.  He was sure that Rokoff would be following this
trio, and so he felt confident that so long as he could keep
upon the Russian's trail he would be winning so much nearer
to the time he might snatch his son from the dangers and
horrors that menaced him.
<P>
In retracing their way after losing Rokoff's trail Tarzan
picked it up again at a point where the Russian had left the
river and taken to the brush in a northerly direction.  He could
only account for this change on the ground that the child had
been carried away from the river by the two who now had
possession of it.
<P>
Nowhere along the way, however, could he gain definite information
that might assure him positively that the child was ahead of him.
Not a single native they questioned had seen or heard of this
other party, though nearly all had had direct experience with
the Russian or had talked with others who had.
<P>
It was with difficulty that Tarzan could find means to communicate
with the natives, as the moment their eyes fell upon his companions
they fled precipitately into the bush.  His only alternative was
to go ahead of his pack and waylay an occasional warrior whom
he found alone in the jungle.
<P>
One day as he was thus engaged, tracking an unsuspecting
savage, he came upon the fellow in the act of hurling a spear
at a wounded white man who crouched in a clump of bush at the
trail's side.  The white was one whom Tarzan had often seen,
and whom he recognized at once.
<P>
Deep in his memory was implanted those repulsive features--the
close-set eyes, the shifty expression, the drooping yellow moustache.
<P>
Instantly it occurred to the ape-man that this fellow had
not been among those who had accompanied Rokoff at the
village where Tarzan had been a prisoner.  He had seen them all,
and this fellow had not been there.  There could be but one
explanation--he it was who had fled ahead of the Russian with
the woman and the child--and the woman had been Jane Clayton.  
He was sure now of the meaning of Rokoff's words.
<P>
The ape-man's face went white as he looked upon the pasty,
vice-marked countenance of the Swede.  Across Tarzan's forehead
stood out the broad band of scarlet that marked the scar where,
years before, Terkoz had torn a great strip of the ape-man's
scalp from his skull in the fierce battle in which Tarzan had
sustained his fitness to the kingship of the apes of Kerchak.
<P>
The man was his prey--the black should not have him,
and with the thought he leaped upon the warrior, striking
down the spear before it could reach its mark.  The black,
whipping out his knife, turned to do battle with this new
enemy, while the Swede, lying in the bush, witnessed a duel,
the like of which he had never dreamed to see--a half-naked
white man battling with a half-naked black, hand to hand
with the crude weapons of primeval man at first, and then
with hands and teeth like the primordial brutes from whose
loins their forebears sprung.
<P>
For a time Anderssen did not recognize the white, and when
at last it dawned upon him that he had seen this giant before,
his eyes went wide in surprise that this growling, rending beast
could ever have been the well-groomed English gentleman who had
been a prisoner aboard the Kincaid.
<P>
An English nobleman!  He had learned the identity of the
Kincaid's prisoners from Lady Greystoke during their flight
up the Ugambi.  Before, in common with the other members of
the crew of the steamer, he had not known who the two might be.
<P>
The fight was over.  Tarzan had been compelled to kill his antagonist,
as the fellow would not surrender.
<P>
The Swede saw the white man leap to his feet beside the corpse
of his foe, and placing one foot upon the broken neck lift
his voice in the hideous challenge of the victorious bull-ape.
<P>
Anderssen shuddered.  Then Tarzan turned toward him.
His face was cold and cruel, and in the grey eyes the
Swede read murder.
<P>
"Where is my wife?" growled the ape-man.  "Where is the child?"
<P>
Anderssen tried to reply, but a sudden fit of coughing choked him.
There was an arrow entirely through his chest, and as he coughed the
blood from his wounded lung poured suddenly from his mouth and nostrils.
<P>
Tarzan stood waiting for the paroxysm to pass.  Like a
bronze image--cold, hard, and relentless--he stood over the
helpless man, waiting to wring such information from him
as he needed, and then to kill.
<P>
Presently the coughing and haemorrhage ceased, and again
the wounded man tried to speak.  Tarzan knelt near the faintly
moving lips.
<P>
"The wife and child!" he repeated.  "Where are they?"
<P>
Anderssen pointed up the trail.
<P>
"The Russian--he got them," he whispered.
<P>
"How did you come here?" continued Tarzan.  "Why are you not with Rokoff?"
<P>
"They catch us," replied Anderssen, in a voice so low
that the ape-man could just distinguish the words.  
"They catch us.  Ay fight, but my men they all run away.  
Then they get me when Ay ban vounded.  Rokoff he say leave
me here for the hyenas.  That vas vorse than to kill.  
He tak your vife and kid."
<P>
"What were you doing with them--where were you taking them?"
asked Tarzan, and then fiercely, leaping close to the
fellow with fierce eyes blazing with the passion of hate and
vengeance that he had with difficulty controlled, "What harm
did you do to my wife or child?  Speak quick before I kill you! 
Make your peace with God!  Tell me the worst, or I will
tear you to pieces with my hands and teeth.  You have seen
that I can do it!"
<P>
A look of wide-eyed surprise overspread Anderssen's face.
<P>
"Why," he whispered, "Ay did not hurt them.  Ay tried
to save them from that Russian.  Your vife was kind to me on
the Kincaid, and Ay hear that little baby cry sometimes.  
Ay got a vife an' kid for my own by Christiania an' Ay couldn't
bear for to see them separated an' in Rokoff's hands any more.  
That vas all.  Do Ay look like Ay ban here to hurt them?"
he continued after a pause, pointing to the arrow protruding
from his breast.
<P>
There was something in the man's tone and expression that
convinced Tarzan of the truth of his assertions.  More weighty
than anything else was the fact that Anderssen evidently seemed
more hurt than frightened.  He knew he was going to die,
so Tarzan's threats had little effect upon him; but it was
quite apparent that he wished the Englishman to know the
truth and not to wrong him by harbouring the belief that his
words and manner indicated that he had entertained.
<P>
The ape-man instantly dropped to his knees beside the Swede.
<P>
"I am sorry," he said very simply.  "I had looked for none
but knaves in company with Rokoff.  I see that I was wrong.  
That is past now, and we will drop it for the more important
matter of getting you to a place of comfort and looking after
your wounds.  We must have you on your feet again as soon
as possible."
<P>
The Swede, smiling, shook his head.
<P>
"You go on an' look for the vife an' kid," he said.  
"Ay ban as gude as dead already; but"--he hesitated--"Ay hate
to think of the hyenas.  Von't you finish up this job?"
<P>
Tarzan shuddered.  A moment ago he had been upon the point
of killing this man.  Now he could no more have taken his life
than he could have taken the life of any of his best friends.
<P>
He lifted the Swede's head in his arms to change and ease his position.
<P>
Again came a fit of coughing and the terrible haemorrhage.  
After it was over Anderssen lay with closed eyes.
<P>
Tarzan thought that he was dead, until he suddenly raised
his eyes to those of the ape-man, sighed, and spoke--in a
very low, weak whisper.
<P>
"Ay tank it blow purty soon purty hard!" he said, and died.
