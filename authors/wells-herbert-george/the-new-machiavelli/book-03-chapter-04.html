Art is selection and so is most autobiography.  But I am concerned 
with a more tangled business than selection, I want to show a 
contemporary man in relation to the state and social usage, and the 
social organism in relation to that man.  To tell my story at all I 
have to simplify.  I have given now the broad lines of my political 
development, and how I passed from my initial liberal-socialism to 
the conception of a constructive aristocracy.  I have tried to set 
that out in the form of a man discovering himself.  Incidentally 
that self-development led to a profound breach with my wife.  One 
has read stories before of husband and wife speaking severally two 
different languages and coming to an understanding.  But Margaret 
and I began in her dialect, and, as I came more and more to use my 
own, diverged.
<P>
I had thought when I married that the matter of womankind had ended 
for me.  I have tried to tell all that sex and women had been to me 
up to my married life with Margaret and our fatal entanglement, 
tried to show the queer, crippled, embarrassed and limited way in 
which these interests break upon the life of a young man under 
contemporary conditions.  I do not think my lot was a very 
exceptional one.  I missed the chance of sisters and girl playmates, 
but that is not an uncommon misadventure in an age of small 
families; I never came to know any woman at all intimately until I 
was married to Margaret.  My earlier love affairs were encounters of 
sex, under conditions of furtiveness and adventure that made them 
things in themselves, restricted and unilluminating.  From a boyish 
disposition to be mystical and worshipping towards women I had 
passed into a disregardful attitude, as though women were things 
inferior or irrelevant, disturbers in great affairs.  For a time 
Margaret had blotted out all other women; she was so different and 
so near; she was like a person who stands suddenly in front of a 
little window through which one has been surveying a crowd.  She 
didn't become womankind for me so much as eliminate womankind from 
my world. . . .  And then came this secret separation. . . .
<P>
Until this estrangement and the rapid and uncontrollable development 
of my relations with Isabel which chanced to follow it, I seemed to 
have solved the problem of women by marriage and disregard.  I 
thought these things were over.  I went about my career with 
Margaret beside me, her brow slightly knit, her manner faintly 
strenuous, helping, helping; and if we had not altogether abolished 
sex we had at least so circumscribed and isolated it that it would 
not have affected the general tenor of our lives in the slightest 
degree if we had.
<P>
And then, clothing itself more and more in the form of Isabel and 
her problems, this old, this fundamental obsession of my life 
returned.  The thing stole upon my mind so that I was unaware of its 
invasion and how it was changing our long intimacy.  I have already 
compared the lot of the modern publicist to Machiavelli writing in 
his study; in his day women and sex were as disregarded in these 
high affairs as, let us say, the chemistry of air or the will of the 
beasts in the fields; in ours the case has altogether changed, and 
woman has come now to stand beside the tall candles, half in the 
light, half in the mystery of the shadows, besetting, interrupting, 
demanding unrelentingly an altogether unprecedented attention.  I 
feel that in these matters my life has been almost typical of my 
time.  Woman insists upon her presence.  She is no longer a mere 
physical need, an aesthetic bye-play, a sentimental background; she 
is a moral and intellectual necessity in a man's life.  She comes to 
the politician and demands, Is she a child or a citizen?  Is she a 
thing or a soul?  She comes to the individual man, as she came to me 
and asks, Is she a cherished weakling or an equal mate, an 
unavoidable helper?  Is she to be tried and trusted or guarded and 
controlled, bond or free?  For if she is a mate, one must at once 
trust more and exact more, exacting toil, courage, and the hardest, 
most necessary thing of all, the clearest, most shameless, 
explicitness of understanding. . . .

In all my earlier imaginings of statecraft I had tacitly assumed 
either that the relations of the sexes were all right or that anyhow 
they didn't concern the state.  It was a matter they, whoever "they" 
were, had to settle among themselves.  That sort of disregard was 
possible then.  But even before 1906 there were endless intimations 
that the dams holding back great reservoirs of discussion were 
crumbling.  We political schemers were ploughing wider than any one 
had ploughed before in the field of social reconstruction.  We had 
also, we realised, to plough deeper.  We had to plough down at last 
to the passionate elements of sexual relationship and examine and 
decide upon them.
<P>
The signs multiplied.  In a year or so half the police of the 
metropolis were scarce sufficient to protect the House from one 
clamorous aspect of the new problem.  The members went about 
Westminster with an odd, new sense of being beset.  A good 
proportion of us kept up the pretence that the Vote for Women was an 
isolated fad, and the agitation an epidemic madness that would 
presently pass.  But it was manifest to any one who sought more than 
comfort in the matter that the streams of women and sympathisers and 
money forthcoming marked far deeper and wider things than an idle 
fancy for the franchise.  The existing laws and conventions of 
relationship between Man and Woman were just as unsatisfactory a 
disorder as anything else in our tumbled confusion of a world, and 
that also was coming to bear upon statecraft.
<P>
My first parliament was the parliament of the Suffragettes.  I don't 
propose to tell here of that amazing campaign, with its absurdities 
and follies, its courage and devotion.  There were aspects of that 
unquenchable agitation that were absolutely heroic and aspects that 
were absolutely pitiful.  It was unreasonable, unwise, and, except 
for its one central insistence, astonishingly incoherent.  It was 
amazingly effective.  The very incoherence of the demand witnessed, 
I think, to the forces that lay behind it.  It wasn't a simple 
argument based on a simple assumption; it was the first crude 
expression of a great mass and mingling of convergent feelings, of a 
widespread, confused persuasion among modern educated women that the 
conditions of their relations with men were oppressive, ugly, 
dishonouring, and had to be altered.  They had not merely adopted 
the Vote as a symbol of equality; it was fairly manifest to me that, 
given it, they meant to use it, and to use it perhaps even 
vindictively and blindly, as a weapon against many things they had 
every reason to hate. . . .
<P>
I remember, with exceptional vividness, that great night early in 
the session of 1909, when--I think it was--fifty or sixty women went 
to prison.  I had been dining at the Barham's, and Lord Barham and I 
came down from the direction of St. James's Park into a crowd and a 
confusion outside the Caxton Hall.  We found ourselves drifting with 
an immense multitude towards Parliament Square and parallel with a 
silent, close-packed column of girls and women, for the most part 
white-faced and intent.  I still remember the effect of their faces 
upon me.  It was quite different from the general effect of staring 
about and divided attention one gets in a political procession of 
men.  There was an expression of heroic tension.
<P>
There had been a pretty deliberate appeal on the part of the women's 
organisers to the Unemployed, who had been demonstrating throughout 
that winter, to join forces with the movement, and the result was 
shown in the quality of the crowd upon the pavement.  It was an 
ugly, dangerous-looking crowd, but as yet good-tempered and 
sympathetic.  When at last we got within sight of the House the 
square was a seething seat of excited people, and the array of 
police on horse and on foot might have been assembled for a 
revolutionary outbreak.  There were dense masses of people up 
Whitehall, and right on to Westminster Bridge.  The scuffle that 
ended in the arrests was the poorest explosion to follow such 
stupendous preparations. . . .
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
Later on in that year the women began a new attack.  Day and night, 
and all through the long nights of the Budget sittings, at all the 
piers of the gates of New Palace Yard and at St. Stephen's Porch, 
stood women pickets, and watched us silently and reproachfully as we 
went to and fro.  They were women of all sorts, though, of course, 
the independent worker-class predominated.  There were grey-headed 
old ladies standing there, sturdily charming in the rain; battered-
looking, ambiguous women, with something of the desperate bitterness 
of battered women showing in their eyes; north-country factory 
girls; cheaply-dressed suburban women; trim, comfortable mothers of 
families; valiant-eyed girl graduates and undergraduates; lank, 
hungry-looking creatures, who stirred one's imagination; one very 
dainty little woman in deep mourning, I recall, grave and steadfast, 
with eyes fixed on distant things.  Some of those women looked 
defiant, some timidly aggressive, some full of the stir of 
adventure, some drooping with cold and fatigue.  The supply never 
ceased.  I had a mortal fear that somehow the supply might halt or 
cease.  I found that continual siege of the legislature 
extraordinarily impressive--infinitely more impressive than the 
feeble-forcible "ragging" of the more militant section.  I thought 
of the appeal that must be going through the country, summoning the 
women from countless scattered homes, rooms, colleges, to 
Westminster.
<P>
I remember too the petty little difficulty I felt whether I should 
ignore these pickets altogether, or lift a hat as I hurried past 
with averted eyes, or look them in the face as I did so.  Towards 
the end the House evoked an etiquette of salutation.
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
There was a tendency, even on the part of its sympathisers, to treat 
the whole suffrage agitation as if it were a disconnected issue, 
irrelevant to all other broad developments of social and political 
life.  We struggled, all of us, to ignore the indicating finger it 
thrust out before us.  "Your schemes, for all their bigness," it 
insisted to our reluctant, averted minds, "still don't go down to 
the essential things. . . ."
<P>
We have to go deeper, or our inadequate children's insufficient 
children will starve amidst harvests of earless futility.  That 
conservatism which works in every class to preserve in its 
essentials the habitual daily life is all against a profounder 
treatment of political issues.  The politician, almost as absurdly 
as the philosopher, tends constantly, in spite of magnificent 
preludes, vast intimations, to specialise himself out of the reality 
he has so stupendously summoned--he bolts back to littleness.  The 
world has to be moulded anew, he continues to admit, but without, he 
adds, any risk of upsetting his week-end visits, his morning cup of 
tea. . . .
<P>
The discussion of the relations of men and women disturbs every one.  
It reacts upon the private life of every one who attempts it.  And 
at any particular time only a small minority have a personal 
interest in changing the established state of affairs.  Habit and 
interest are in a constantly recruited majority against conscious 
change and adjustment in these matters.  Drift rules us.  The great 
mass of people, and an overwhelming proportion of influential 
people, are people who have banished their dreams and made their 
compromise.  Wonderful and beautiful possibilities are no longer to 
be thought about.  They have given up any aspirations for intense 
love, their splendid offspring, for keen delights, have accepted a 
cultivated kindliness and an uncritical sense of righteousness as 
their compensation.  It's a settled affair with them, a settled, 
dangerous affair.  Most of them fear, and many hate, the slightest 
reminder of those abandoned dreams.  As Dayton once said to the 
Pentagram Circle, when we were discussing the problem of a universal 
marriage and divorce law throughout the Empire, "I am for leaving 
all these things alone."  And then, with a groan in his voice, 
"Leave them alone!  Leave them all alone!"
<P>
That was his whole speech for the evening, in a note of suppressed 
passion, and presently, against all our etiquette, he got up and 
went out.
<P>
For some years after my marriage, I too was for leaving them alone.  
I developed a dread and dislike for romance, for emotional music, 
for the human figure in art--turning my heart to landscape.  I 
wanted to sneer at lovers and their ecstasies, and was uncomfortable 
until I found the effective sneer.  In matters of private morals 
these were my most uncharitable years.  I didn't want to think of 
these things any more for ever.  I hated the people whose talk or 
practice showed they were not of my opinion.  I wanted to believe 
that their views were immoral and objectionable and contemptible, 
because I had decided to treat them as at that level.  I was, in 
fact, falling into the attitude of the normal decent man.
<P>
And yet one cannot help thinking!  The sensible moralised man finds 
it hard to escape the stream of suggestion that there are still 
dreams beyond these commonplace acquiescences,--the appeal of beauty 
suddenly shining upon one, the mothlike stirrings of serene summer 
nights, the sweetness of distant music. . . .
<P>
It is one of the paradoxical factors in our public life at the 
present time, which penalises abandonment to love so abundantly and 
so heavily, that power, influence and control fall largely to 
unencumbered people and sterile people and people who have married 
for passionless purposes, people whose very deficiency in feeling 
has left them free to follow ambition, people beautyblind, who don't 
understand what it is to fall in love, what it is to desire children 
or have them, what it is to feel in their blood and bodies the 
supreme claim of good births and selective births above all other 
affairs in life, people almost of necessity averse from this most 
fundamental aspect of existence. . . .
<P>

<P>
<P>
It wasn't, however, my deepening sympathy with and understanding of 
the position of women in general, or the change in my ideas about 
all these intimate things my fast friendship with Isabel was 
bringing about, that led me to the heretical views I have in the 
last five years dragged from the region of academic and timid 
discussion into the field of practical politics.  Those influences, 
no doubt, have converged to the same end, and given me a powerful 
emotional push upon my road, but it was a broader and colder view of 
things that first determined me in my attempt to graft the Endowment 
of Motherhood in some form or other upon British Imperialism.  Now 
that I am exiled from the political world, it is possible to 
estimate just how effectually that grafting has been done.
<P>
I have explained how the ideas of a trained aristocracy and a 
universal education grew to paramount importance in my political 
scheme.  It is but a short step from this to the question of the 
quantity and quality of births in the community, and from that again 
to these forbidden and fear-beset topics of marriage, divorce, and 
the family organisation.  A sporadic discussion of these aspects had 
been going on for years, a Eugenic society existed, and articles on 
the Falling Birth Rate, and the Rapid Multiplication of the Unfit 
were staples of the monthly magazines.  But beyond an intermittent 
scolding of prosperous childless people in general--one never 
addressed them in particular--nothing was done towards arresting 
those adverse processes.  Almost against my natural inclination, I 
found myself forced to go into these things.  I came to the 
conclusion that under modern conditions the isolated private family, 
based on the existing marriage contract, was failing in its work.  
It wasn't producing enough children, and children good enough and 
well trained enough for the demands of the developing civilised 
state.  Our civilisation was growing outwardly, and decaying in its 
intimate substance, and unless it was presently to collapse, some 
very extensive and courageous reorganisation was needed.  The old 
haphazard system of pairing, qualified more and more by worldly 
discretions, no longer secures a young population numerous enough or 
good enough for the growing needs and possibilities of our Empire.  
Statecraft sits weaving splendid garments, no doubt, but with a 
puny, ugly, insufficient baby in the cradle.
<P>
No one so far has dared to take up this problem as a present 
question for statecraft, but it comes unheralded, unadvocated, and 
sits at every legislative board.  Every improvement is provisional 
except the improvement of the race, and it became more and more 
doubtful to me if we were improving the race at all!  Splendid and 
beautiful and courageous people must come together and have 
children, women with their fine senses and glorious devotion must be 
freed from the net that compels them to be celibate, compels them to 
be childless and useless, or to bear children ignobly to men whom 
need and ignorance and the treacherous pressure of circumstances 
have forced upon them.  We all know that, and so few dare even to 
whisper it for fear that they should seem, in seeking to save the 
family, to threaten its existence.  It is as if a party of pigmies 
in a not too capacious room had been joined by a carnivorous giant--
and decided to go on living happily by cutting him dead. . . .
<P>
The problem the developing civilised state has to solve is how it 
can get the best possible increase under the best possible 
conditions.  I became more and more convinced that the independent 
family unit of to-day, in which the man is master of the wife and 
owner of the children, in which all are dependent upon him, 
subordinated to his enterprises and liable to follow his fortunes up 
or down, does not supply anything like the best conceivable 
conditions.  We want to modernise the family footing altogether.  An 
enormous premium both in pleasure and competitive efficiency is put 
upon voluntary childlessness, and enormous inducements are held out 
to women to subordinate instinctive and selective preferences to 
social and material considerations.
<P>
The practical reaction of modern conditions upon the old tradition 
of the family is this: that beneath the pretence that nothing is 
changing, secretly and with all the unwholesomeness of secrecy 
everything is changed.  Offspring fall away, the birth rate falls 
and falls most among just the most efficient and active and best 
adapted classes in the community.  The species is recruited from 
among its failures and from among less civilised aliens.  
Contemporary civilisations are in effect burning the best of their 
possible babies in the furnaces that run the machinery.  In the 
United States the native Anglo-American strain has scarcely 
increased at all since 1830, and in most Western European countries 
the same is probably true of the ablest and most energetic elements 
in the community.  The women of these classes still remain legally 
and practically dependent and protected, with the only natural 
excuse for their dependence gone. . . .
<P>
The modern world becomes an immense spectacle of unsatisfactory 
groupings; here childless couples bored to death in the hopeless 
effort to sustain an incessant honeymoon, here homes in which a 
solitary child grows unsocially, here small two or three-child homes 
that do no more than continue the culture of the parents at a great 
social cost, here numbers of unhappy educated but childless married 
women, here careless, decivilised fecund homes, here orphanages and 
asylums for the heedlessly begotten.  It is just the disorderly 
proliferation of Bromstead over again, in lives instead of in 
houses.
<P>
What is the good, what is the common sense, of rectifying 
boundaries, pushing research and discovery, building cities, 
improving all the facilities of life, making great fleets, waging 
wars, while this aimless decadence remains the quality of the 
biological outlook? . . .
<P>
It is difficult now to trace how I changed from my early aversion 
until I faced this mass of problems.  But so far back as 1910 I had 
it clear in my mind that I would rather fail utterly than 
participate in all the surrenders of mind and body that are implied 
in Dayton's snarl of "Leave it alone; leave it all alone!"  Marriage 
and the begetting and care of children, is the very ground substance 
in the life of the community.  In a world in which everything 
changes, in which fresh methods, fresh adjustments and fresh ideas 
perpetually renew the circumstances of life, it is preposterous that 
we should not even examine into these matters, should rest content 
to be ruled by the uncriticised traditions of a barbaric age.
<P>
Now, it seems to me that the solution of this problem is also the 
solution of the woman's individual problem.  The two go together, 
are right and left of one question.  The only conceivable way out 
from our IMPASSE lies in the recognition of parentage, that is to 
say of adequate mothering, as no longer a chance product of 
individual passions but a service rendered to the State.  Women must 
become less and less subordinated to individual men, since this 
works out in a more or less complete limitation, waste, and 
sterilisation of their essentially social function; they must become 
more and more subordinated as individually independent citizens to 
the collective purpose.  Or, to express the thing by a familiar 
phrase, the highly organised, scientific state we desire must, if it 
is to exist at all, base itself not upon the irresponsible man-ruled 
family, but upon the matriarchal family, the citizen-ship and 
freedom of women and the public endowment of motherhood.
<P>
After two generations of confused and experimental revolt it grows 
clear to modern women that a conscious, deliberate motherhood and 
mothering is their special function in the State, and that a 
personal subordination to an individual man with an unlimited power 
of control over this intimate and supreme duty is a degradation.  No 
contemporary woman of education put to the test is willing to 
recognise any claim a man can make upon her but the claim of her 
freely-given devotion to him.  She wants the reality of her choice 
and she means "family" while a man too often means only possession.  
This alters the spirit of the family relationships fundamentally.  
Their form remains just what it was when woman was esteemed a 
pretty, desirable, and incidentally a child-producing, chattel.  
Against these time-honoured ideas the new spirit of womanhood 
struggles in shame, astonishment, bitterness, and tears. . . .
<P>
I confess myself altogether feminist.  I have no doubts in the 
matter.  I want this coddling and browbeating of women to cease.  I 
want to see women come in, free and fearless, to a full 
participation in the collective purpose of mankind.  Women, I am 
convinced, are as fine as men; they can be as wise as men; they are 
capable of far greater devotion than men.  I want to see them 
citizens, with a marriage law framed primarily for them and for 
their protection and the good of the race, and not for men's 
satisfactions.  I want to see them bearing and rearing good children 
in the State as a generously rewarded public duty and service, 
choosing their husbands freely and discerningly, and in no way 
enslaved by or subordinated to the men they have chosen.  The social 
consciousness of women seems to me an unworked, an almost untouched 
mine of wealth for the constructive purpose of the world.  I want to 
change the respective values of the family group altogether, and 
make the home indeed the women's kingdom and the mother the owner 
and responsible guardian of her children.
<P>
It is no use pretending that this is not novel and revolutionary; it 
is.  The Endowment of Motherhood implies a new method of social 
organization, a rearrangement of the social unit, untried in human 
expericnce--as untried as electric traction was or flying in 1800.  
Of course, it may work out to modify men's ideas of marriage 
profoundly.  To me that is a secondary consideration.  I do not 
believe that particular assertion myself, because I am convinced 
that a practical monogamy is a psychological necessity to the mass 
of civilised people.  But even if I did believe it I should still 
keep to my present line, because it is the only line that will 
prevent a highly organised civilisation from ending in biological 
decay.  The public Endowment of Motherhood is the only possible way 
which will ensure the permanently developing civilised state at 
which all constructive minds are aiming.  A point is reached in the 
life-history of a civilisation when either this reconstruction must 
be effected or the quality and MORALE of the population prove 
insufficient for the needs of the developing organisation.  It is 
not so much moral decadence that will destroy us as moral 
inadaptability.  The old code fails under the new needs.  The only 
alternative to this profound reconstruction is a decay in human 
quality and social collapse.  Either this unprecedented 
rearrangement must be achieved by our civilisation, or it must 
presently come upon a phase of disorder and crumble and perish, as 
Rome perished, as France declines, as the strain of the Pilgrim 
Fathers dwindles out of America.  Whatever hope there may be in the 
attempt therefore, there is no alternative to the attempt.
<P>

I wanted political success now dearly enough, but not at the price 
of constructive realities.  These questions were no doubt 
monstrously dangerous in the political world; there wasn't a 
politician alive who didn't look scared at the mention of "The 
Family," but if raising these issues were essential to the social 
reconstructions on which my life was set, that did not matter.  It 
only implied that I should take them up with deliberate caution.  
There was no release because of risk or difficulty.
<P>
The question of whether I should commit myself to some open project 
in this direction was going on in my mind concurrently with my 
speculations about a change of party, like bass and treble in a 
complex piece of music.  The two drew to a conclusion together.  I 
would not only go over to Imperialism, but I would attempt to 
biologise Imperialism.
<P>
I thought at first that I was undertaking a monstrous uphill task.  
But as I came to look into the possibilities of the matter, a strong 
persuasion grew up in my mind that this panic fear of legislative 
proposals affecting the family basis was excessive, that things were 
much riper for development in this direction than old-experienced 
people out of touch with the younger generation imagined, that to 
phrase the thing in a parliamentary fashion, "something might be 
done in the constituencies" with the Endowment of Motherhood 
forthwith, provided only that it was made perfectly clear that 
anything a sane person could possibly intend by "morality" was left 
untouched by these proposals.
<P>
I went to work very carefully.  I got Roper of the DAILY TELEPHONE 
and Burkett of the DIAL to try over a silly-season discussion of 
State Help for Mothers, and I put a series of articles on eugenics, 
upon the fall in the birth-rate, and similar topics in the BLUE 
WEEKLY, leading up to a tentative and generalised advocacy of the 
public endowment of the nation's children.  I was more and more 
struck by the acceptance won by a sober and restrained presentation 
of this suggestion.
<P>
And then, in the fourth year of the BLUE WEEKLY'S career, came the 
Handitch election, and I was forced by the clamour of my antagonist, 
and very willingly forced, to put my convictions to the test.  I 
returned triumphantly to Westminster with the Public Endowment of 
Motherhood as part of my open profession and with the full approval 
of the party press.  Applauding benches of Imperialists cheered me 
on my way to the table between the whips.
<P>
That second time I took the oath I was not one of a crowd of new 
members, but salient, an event, a symbol of profound changes and new 
purposes in the national life.
<P>
Here it is my political book comes to an end, and in a sense my book 
ends altogether.  For the rest is but to tell how I was swept out of 
this great world of political possibilities.  I close this Third 
Book as I opened it, with an admission of difficulties and 
complexities, but now with a pile of manuscript before me I have to 
confess them unsurmounted and still entangled.
<P>
Yet my aim was a final simplicity.  I have sought to show my growing 
realisation that the essential quality of all political and social 
effort is the development of a great race mind behind the interplay 
of individual lives.  That is the collective human reality, the 
basis of morality, the purpose of devotion.  To that our lives must 
be given, from that will come the perpetual fresh release and 
further ennoblement of individual lives. . . .
<P>
I have wanted to make that idea of a collective mind play in this 
book the part United Italy plays in Machiavelli's PRINCE.  I have 
called it the hinterland of reality, shown it accumulating a 
dominating truth and rightness which must force men's now sporadic 
motives more and more into a disciplined and understanding relation 
to a plan.  And I have tried to indicate how I sought to serve this 
great clarification of our confusions. . . .
<P>
Now I come back to personality and the story of my self-betrayal, 
and how it is I have had to leave all that far-reaching scheme of 
mine, a mere project and beginning for other men to take or leave as 
it pleases them.
