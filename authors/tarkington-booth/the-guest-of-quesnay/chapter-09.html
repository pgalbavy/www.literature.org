<p>He came on more slowly, his eyes following her as she vanished,
then turning to me with a rather pitiful apprehension&mdash;a look
like that I remember to have seen (some hundreds of years ago)
on the face of a freshman, glancing up from his book to find his
doorway ominously filling with sophomores.</p>

<p>I stepped out to meet him, indignant upon several counts, most
of all upon his own. I knew there was no offence in his heart,
not the remotest rude intent, but the fact was before me that
he had frightened a woman, had given this very lovely guest of
my friends good cause to hold him a boor, if she did not, indeed,
think him (as she probably thought me) an outright lunatic! I
said:</p>

<p>"You spoke to that lady!" And my voice sounded unexpectedly harsh
and sharp to my own ears, for I had meant to speak quietly.</p>

<p>"I know &mdash;I know. It&mdash;it was wrong," he stammered. "I knew
I shouldn't&mdash;and I couldn't help it."</p>

<p>"You expect me to believe that?"</p>

<p>"It's the truth; I couldn't!"</p>

<p>I laughed sceptically; and he flinched, but repeated that what
he had said was only the truth. "I don't understand; it was all
beyond me," he added huskily.</p>

<p>"What was it you said to her?"</p>

<p>"I spoke her name&mdash;'Madame d'Armand.'"</p>

<p>"You said more than that!"</p>

<p>"I asked her if she would let me see her again."</p>

<p>"What else?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he answered humbly. "And then she&mdash;then for a moment
it seemed&mdash;for a moment she didn't seem to be able to speak&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should think not!" I shouted, and burst out at him with satirical
laughter. He stood patiently enduring it, his lowered eyes following
the aimless movements of his hands, which were twisting and untwisting
his flexible straw hat; and it might have struck me as nearer
akin to tragedy rather than to a thing for laughter: this spectacle
of a grown man so like a schoolboy before the master, shamefaced
over a stammered confession.</p>

<p>"But she did say something to you, didn't she?" I asked finally,
with the gentleness of a cross-examining lawyer.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;after that moment."</p>

<p>"Well, what was it?"</p>

<p>"She said, 'Not now!' That was all."</p>

<p>"I suppose that was all she had breath for! It was just the inconsequent
and meaningless thing a frightened woman <em>WOULD </em>say!"</p>

<p>"Meaningless?" he repeated, and looked up wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Did you take it for an appointment?" I roared, quite out of
patience, and losing my temper completely.</p>

<p>"No, no, no! She said only that, and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then she turned and ran away from you!"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, swallowing painfully.</p>

<p>"That <em>PLEASED </em>you," I stormed, "to frighten a woman
in the woods&mdash;to make her feel that she can't walk here in safety!
You <em>ENJOY </em>doing things like that?"</p>

<p>He looked at me with disconcerting steadiness for a moment, and,
without offering any other response, turned aside, resting his
arm against the trunk of a tree and gazing into the quiet forest.</p>

<p>I set about packing my traps, grumbling various sarcasms, the
last mutterings of a departed storm, for already I realised that
I had taken out my own mortification upon him, and I was stricken
with remorse. And yet, so contrarily are we made, I continued
to be unkind while in my heart I was asking pardon of him. I tried
to make my reproaches gentler, to lend my voice a hint of friendly
humour, but in spite of me the one sounded gruffer and the other
sourer with everything I said. This was the worse because of the
continued silence of the victim: he did not once answer, nor by
the slightest movement alter his attitude until I had finished&mdash;and
more than finished.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;and that's all!" I said desperately, when the things
were strapped and I had slung them to my shoulder. "Let's be off,
in heaven's name!"</p>

<p>At that he turned quickly toward me; it did not lessen my remorse
to see that he had grown very pale.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have frightened her for the world," he said, and
his voice and his whole body shook with a strange violence. "I
wouldn't have frightened her to please the angels in heaven!"</p>

<p>A blunderer whose incantation had brought the spirit up to face
me, I stared at him helplessly, nor could I find words to answer
or control the passion that my imbecile scolding had evoked. Whatever
the barriers Keredec's training had built for his protection,
they were down now.</p>

<p>"You think I told a lie!" he cried. "You think I lied when I
said I couldn't help speaking to her!"</p>

<p>"No, no," I said earnestly. "I didn't mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Words!" he swept the feeble protest away, drowned in a whirling
vehemence. "And what does it matter? You <em>CAN'T </em>understand.
When <em>YOU </em>want to know what to do, you look back into
your life and it tells you; and I look back &mdash;AH!" He cried
out, uttering a half-choked, incoherent syllable. "I look back
and it's all &mdash;<em>BLIND! </em>All these things you <em>CAN
</em>do and <em>CAN'T </em>do&mdash;all these infinite little things!
You know, and Keredec knows, and Glouglou knows, and every mortal
soul on earth knows&mdash;but <em>I</em> don't know! Your life has
taught you, and you know, but I don't know. I haven't <em>HAD
</em>my life. It's gone! All I have is words that Keredec has
said to me, and it's like a man with no eyes, out in the sunshine
hunting for the light. Do you think words can teach you to resist
such impulses as I had when I spoke to Madame d'Armand? Can life
itself teach you to resist them? Perhaps you never had them?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," I answered honestly.</p>

<p>"I would burn my hand from my arm and my arm from my body," he
went on, with the same wild intensity, "rather than trouble her
or frighten her, but I couldn't help speaking to her any more
than I can help wanting to see her again&mdash;the feeling that I <em>MUST&mdash;</em>whatever
you say or do, whatever Keredec says or does, whatever the whole
world may say or do. And I will! It isn't a thing to choose to
do, or not to do. I can't help it any more than I can help being
alive!"</p>

<p>He paused, wiping from his brow a heavy dew not of the heat,
but like that on the forehead of a man in crucial pain. I made
nervous haste to seize the opportunity, and said gently, almost
timidly:</p>

<p>"But if it should distress the lady?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;then I could keep away. But I must know that."</p>

<p>"I think you might know it by her running away&mdash;and by her look,"
I said mildly. "Didn't you?"</p>

<p>"NO!" And his eyes flashed an added emphasis.</p>

<p>"Well, well," I said, "let's be on our way, or the professor
will be wondering if he is to dine alone."</p>

<p>Without looking to see if he followed, I struck into the path
toward home. He did follow, obediently enough, not uttering another
word so long as we were in the woods, though I could hear him
breathing sharply as he strode behind me, and knew that he was
struggling to regain control of himself. I set the pace, making
it as fast as I could, and neither of us spoke again until we
had come out of the forest and were upon the main road near the
Baudry cottage. Then he said in a steadier voice:</p>

<p>"Why should it distress her?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see," I began, not slackening the pace "there are
formalities&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, I know," he interrupted, with an impatient laugh. "Keredec
once took me to a marionette show&mdash;all the little people strung
on wires; they couldn't move any other way. And so you mustn't
talk to a woman until somebody whose name has been spoken to you
speaks yours to her! Do you call that a rule of nature?"</p>

<p>"My dear boy," I laughed in some desperation, "we must conform
to it, ordinarily, no matter whose rule it is."</p>

<p>"Do you think Madame d'Armand cares for little forms like that?"
he asked challengingly.</p>

<p>"She does," I assured him with perfect confidence. "And, for
the hundredth time, you must have seen how you troubled her."</p>

<p>"No," he returned, with the same curious obstinacy, "I don't
believe it. There was something, but it wasn't trouble. We looked
straight at each other; I saw her eyes plainly, and it was&mdash;"
he paused and sighed, a sudden, brilliant smile upon his lips&mdash;"it
was very&mdash;it was very strange!"</p>

<p>There was something so glad and different in his look that&mdash;like
any other dried-up old blunderer in my place &mdash;I felt an
instant tendency to laugh. It was that heathenish possession,
the old insanity of the risibles, which makes a man think it a
humourous thing that his friend should be discovered in love.</p>

<p>But before I spoke, before I quite smiled outright, I was given
the grace to see myself in the likeness of a leering stranger
trespassing in some cherished inclosure: a garden where the gentlest
guests must always be intruders, and only the owner should come.
The best of us profane it readily, leaving the coarse prints of
our heels upon its paths, mauling and man-handling the fairy blossoms
with what pudgy fingers! Comes the poet, ruthlessly leaping the
wall and trumpeting indecently his view-halloo of the chase, and,
after him, the joker, snickering and hopeful of a kill among the
rose-beds; for this has been their hunting-ground since the world
began. These two have made us miserably ashamed of the divine
infinitive, so that we are afraid to utter the very words "to
love," lest some urchin overhear and pursue us with a sticky forefinger
and stickier taunts. It is little to my credit that I checked
the silly impulse to giggle at the eternal marvel, and went as
gently as I could where I should not have gone at all.</p>

<p>"But if you were wrong," I said, "if it did distress her, and
if it happened that she has already had too much that was distressing
in her life&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know something about her!" he exclaimed. "You know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not," I interrupted in turn. "I have only a vague guess;
I may be altogether mistaken."</p>

<p>"What is it that you guess?" he demanded abruptly. "Who made
her suffer?"</p>

<p>"I think it was her husband," I said, with a lack of discretion
for which I was instantly sorry, fearing with reason that I had
added a final blunder to the long list of the afternoon. "That
is," I added, "if my guess is right."</p>

<p>He stopped short in the road, detaining me by the arm, the question
coming like a whip-crack: sharp, loud, violent.</p>

<p>"Is he alive?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," I answered, beginning to move forward; "and this
is foolish talk&mdash;especially on my part!"</p>

<p>"But I want to know," he persisted, again detaining me.</p>

<p>"And I <em>DON'T </em>know!" I returned emphatically. "Probably
I am entirely mistaken in thinking that I know anything of her
whatever. I ought not to have spoken, unless I knew what I was
talking about, and I'd rather not say any more until I do know."</p>

<p>"Very well," he said quickly. "Will you tell me then?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if you will let it go at that."</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, and with an impulse which was but too plainly
one of gratitude, offered me his hand. I took it, and my soul
was disquieted within me, for it was no purpose of mine to set
inquiries on foot in regard to the affairs of "Madame d'Armand."</p>

<p>It was early dusk, that hour, a little silvered but still clear,
when the edges of things are beginning to grow indefinite, and
usually our sleepy countryside knew no tranquiller time of day;
but to-night, as we approached the inn, there were strange shapes
in the roadway and other tokens that events were stirring there.</p>

<p>From the courtyard came the sounds of laughter and chattering
voices. Before the entrance stood a couple of open touring-cars;
the chauffeurs engaged in cooling the rear tires with buckets
of water brought by a personage ordinarily known as Glouglou,
whose look and manner, as he performed this office for the leathern
dignitaries, so awed me that I wondered I had ever dared address
him with any presumption of intimacy. The cars were great and
opulent, of impressive wheel-base, and fore-and-aft they were
laden intricately with baggage: concave trunks fitting behind
the tonneaus, thin trunks fastened upon the footboards, green,
circular trunks adjusted to the spare tires, all deeply coated
with dust. Here were fineries from Paris, doubtless on their way
to flutter over the gay sands of Trouville, and now wandering
but temporarily from the road; for such splendours were never
designed to dazzle us of Madame Brossard's.</p>

<p>We were crossing before the machines when one of the drivers
saw fit to crank his engine (if that is the knowing phrase) and
the thing shook out the usual vibrating uproar. It had a devastating
effect upon my companion. He uttered a wild exclamation and sprang
sideways into me, almost upsetting us both.</p>

<p>"What on earth is the matter?" I asked. "Did you think the car
was starting?"</p>

<p>He turned toward me a face upon which was imprinted the sheer,
blank terror of a child. It passed in an instant however, and
he laughed.</p>

<p>"I really didn't know. Everything has been so quiet always, out
here in the country&mdash;and that horrible racket coming so suddenly&mdash;"</p>

<p>Laughing with him, I took his arm and we turned to enter the
archway. As we did so we almost ran into a tall man who was coming
out, evidently intending to speak to one of the drivers.</p>

<p>The stranger stepped back with a word of apology, and I took
note of him for a fellow-countryman, and a worldly buck of fashion
indeed, almost as cap-a-pie the automobilist as my mysterious
spiller of cider had been the pedestrian. But this was no game-chicken;
on the contrary (so far as a glance in the dusk of the archway
revealed him), much the picture for framing in a club window of
a Sunday morning; a seasoned, hard-surfaced, knowing creature
for whom many a head waiter must have swept previous claimants
from desired tables. He looked forty years so cannily that I guessed
him to be about fifty.</p>

<p>We were passing him when he uttered an ejaculation of surprise
and stepped forward again, holding out his hand to my companion,
and exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Where did <em>YOU </em>come from? I'd hardly have known you."</p>

<p>Oliver seemed unconscious of the proffered hand; he stiffened
visibly and said:</p>

<p>"I think there must be some mistake."</p>

<p>"So there is," said the other promptly. "I have been misled by
a resemblance. I beg your pardon."</p>

<p>He lifted his cap slightly, going on, and we entered the courtyard
to find a cheerful party of nine or ten men and women seated about
a couple of tables. Like the person we had just encountered, they
all exhibited a picturesque elaboration of the costume permitted
by their mode of travel; making effective groupings in their ample
draperies of buff and green and white, with glimpses of a flushed
and pretty face or two among the loosened veilings. Upon the tables
were pots of tea, plates of sandwiches, Madame Brossard's three
best silver dishes heaped with fruit, and some bottles of dry
champagne from the cellars of Rheims. The partakers were making
very merry, having with them (as is inevitable in all such parties,
it seems) a fat young man inclined to humour, who was now upon
his feet for the proposal of some prankish toast. He interrupted
himself long enough to glance our way as we crossed the garden;
and it struck me that several pairs of brighter eyes followed
my young companion with interest. He was well worth it, perhaps
all the more because he was so genuinely unconscious of it; and
he ran up the gallery steps and disappeared into his own rooms
without sending even a glance from the corner of his eye in return.</p>

<p>I went almost as quickly to my pavilion, and, without lighting
my lamp, set about my preparations for dinner.</p>

<p>The party outside, breaking up presently, could be heard moving
toward the archway with increased noise and laughter, inspired
by some exquisite antic on the part of the fat young man, when
a girl's voice (a very attractive voice) called, "Oh, Cressie,
aren't you coming?" and a man's replied, from near my veranda:
"Only stopping to light a cigar."</p>

<p>A flutter of skirts and a patter of feet betokened that the girl
came running back to join the smoker. "Cressie," I heard her say
in an eager, lowered tone, "who <em>WAS </em>he?"</p>

<p>"Who was who?"</p>

<p>"That <em>DEVASTATING </em>creature in white flannels!"</p>

<p>The man chuckled. "Matinee sort of devastator&mdash;what? Monte Cristo
hair, noble profile&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'd better tell me," she interrupted earnestly&mdash;"if you don't
want me to ask the <em>WAITER</em>."</p>

<p>"But I don't know him."</p>

<p>"I saw you speak to him."</p>

<p>"I thought it was a man I met three years ago out in San Francisco,
but I was mistaken. There was a slight resemblance. This fellow
might have been a rather decent younger brother of the man I knew.
HE was the&mdash;"</p>

<p>My strong impression was that if the speaker had not been interrupted
at this point he would have said something very unfavourable to
the character of the man he had met in San Francisco; but there
came a series of blasts from the automobile horns and loud calls
from others of the party, who were evidently waiting for these
two.</p>

<p>"Coming!" shouted the man.</p>

<p>"Wait!" said his companion hurriedly, "Who was the other man,
the older one with the painting things and <em>SUCH </em>a coat?"</p>

<p>"Never saw him before in my life."</p>

<p>I caught a last word from the girl as the pair moved away.</p>

<p>"I'll come back here with a <em>BAND </em>to-morrow night, and
serenade the beautiful one.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he'd drop me his card out of the window!"</p>

<p>The horns sounded again; there was a final chorus of laughter,
suddenly ceasing to be heard as the cars swept away, and Les Trois
Pigeons was left to its accustomed quiet.</p>

<p>"Monsieur is served," said Amedee, looking in at my door, five
minutes later.</p>

<p>"You have passed a great hour just now, Amedee."</p>

<p>"It was like the old days, truly!"</p>

<p>"They are off for Trouville, I suppose."</p>

<p>"No, monsieur, they are on their way to visit the chateau, and
stopped here only because the run from Paris had made the tires
too hot."</p>

<p>"To visit Quesnay, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Truly. But monsieur need give himself no uneasiness; I did not
mention to any one that monsieur is here. His name was not spoken.
Mademoiselle Ward returned to the chateau to-day," he added. "She
has been in England."</p>

<p>"Quesnay will be gay," I said, coming out to the table. Oliver
Saffren was helping the professor down the steps, and Keredec,
bent with suffering, but indomitable, gave me a hearty greeting,
and began a ruthless dissection of Plato with the soup. Oliver,
usually, very quiet, as I have said, seemed a little restless
under the discourse to-night. However, he did not interrupt, sitting
patiently until bedtime, though obviously not listening. When
he bade me good night he gave me a look so clearly in reference
to a secret understanding between us that, meaning to keep only
the letter of my promise to him, I felt about as comfortable as
if I had meanly tricked a child.</p>
