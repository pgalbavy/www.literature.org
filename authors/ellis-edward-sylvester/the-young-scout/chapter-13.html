<p>Cemuri, the wounded scout, did his duty well. Convinced that
Lieutenant Decker did the right thing in ordering him to return
to Fort Reno, to have his hurt looked after, he was as eager as
ever to befriend the gallant young officer and his companions,
thus deprived of his services.</p>

<p>The White Mountain Apache waited but a short time after the disappearance
of Maroz and Ceballos, when he climbed into the saddle and headed
his pony for the fort. His suffering was great, but his iron will
mastered the weakness of his body, for which he showed his contempt
by striking his animal into a gallop, which served to increase
his pain.</p>

<p>A mile away he came directly upon six cavalrymen who were out
on a scout. Among them were Armon Peyser, Budge Colgate and Jack
Redfield, who had campaigned for years in New Mexico and Arizona
and knew all there was to know of the cunning and ferocity of
Geronimo, Natchez and their fierce followers.</p>

<p>Cemuri quickly told his story. He was able to locate the raiders
and direct the party to the spot where the three scouts were doing
all they could to hold them in check. Despite the pluck of the
friendly Apache, he could not hide his suffering, and Peyser,
in his sympathy, offered to send one of his men with him to the
post.</p>

<p>This proposition, made with the best of intentions, was almost
an insult to Cemuri. He refused it point-blank, and, to prevent
its repetition, galloped away without so much as a farewell. None
knew better than he that he could not receive aid too soon, but
he would accept no guidance or assistance from these friends.</p>

<p>"That’s good news of his," said Peyser, as he and his companions
sat grouped together in the moonlight, "for it means a fight."</p>

<p>"But Geronimo has some twenty of his bucks with him," reminded
Budge Colgate, "and to put matters in a good shape, we ought to
have more of the boys with us."</p>

<p>"We’ll do it if we can, but, if they can’t be found in time,
we won’t be cheated out of our fun."</p>

<p>"I don’t think Jennings and the rest are far off," suggested
Jack Redfield, who now made the signal used by Lieutenant Decker,
who was too far off to hear the reports.</p>

<p>To their delight, the hail was instantly answered from a point
so near at hand that the three instinctively turned their eyes
to the south whence it came.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, a ringing "Halloo!" sounded through the
stillness and a round dozen horsemen loomed to view, coming at
a swinging pace. In a twinkling, as may be said, eighteen well-mounted
and armed United States troopers gathered in the middle of the
sandy plain. Armon Peyser, as the oldest campaigner and by virtue
of his office as sergeant, was leader, though when a junction
should be effected with Freeman and Decker, the lieutenant of
course would assume command.</p>

<p>A hurried consultation followed. It was nearly five miles to
the bend of the stream, where Cemuri had left his friends, and
Peyser began describing the place, as well as he could, when Budge
Colgate interrupted him.</p>

<p>"I know the spot! We can ride there in a bee line; lead on sergeant."</p>

<p>And away they went, hardly drawing rein until within a fourth
of a mile of the stream. Knowing they were near it, the party
slackened their pace and were cautiously advancing, with Colgate
at the head, when the signal of Lieutenant Decker reached them.</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed the scout; "I knew it wasn’t far off."</p>

<p>As has been shown, the hail was promptly answered and a second
junction took place, with the result that a round twenty horsemen
were brought together, all eager for a brush with the hostiles.
Mendez had not yet returned from his reconnaissance upon which
he ventured some time before. He was not so far off, however,
that he did not know of the arrival of the reinforcements, and
he was but a few minutes behind them in reaching the spot.</p>

<p>Being ready for the serious business now in hand, the all-important
requisite was to know the situation of the foe whom they meant
to strike. Mendez had no information to give on that point, for
when he left his two friends he went only a short way. His purpose
was not so much to spy out the hostiles as to prevent their spying
out the two whites and stealing a march upon them.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decker was as indisposed as any of his companions
to remain idle until the rising of the sun. Accordingly the three
best scouts, including Mendez, were sent out to locate the raiders,
if possible, with a view of attacking them at the earliest moment.
In their absence, the troopers dismounted and lolled about in
the sand, some snatching a little sleep, others smoking and talking
in low tones, while the sentinels, as a matter of course, were
placed at the proper points to guard against surprise.</p>

<p>Martin, one of the white scouts, went up the stream, Potter,
another, took the opposite course, while Mendez rode his pony
to the other side. The other two were also mounted, for it will
be understood that their duty differed from that of the Apache
scout, when he first went out. It was then an object with him
to steal as close as he could to the raiders, with a view of learning
their purposes, and it has been shown how well he did his duty.</p>

<p>In the present instance, however, it was only necessary to find
out where the main body of hostiles were. The instant that became
known, the one making the discovery would hasten back with the
information. If well mounted, he could do this much more successfully
than if on foot.</p>

<p>It was not to be supposed that the hostiles would be on the alert
against such an enterprise, and the scouts undertaking it were
hopeful of making their discovery and getting back within an hour
from the time of their going forth.</p>

<p>The most dangerous proceeding, as it seemed, was that of Mendez
in crossing the stream, for the presumption was that the enemies
were on the other side. If he should be seen, as was quite likely,
when he located the raiders he would have to make a desperate
ride for life. It would not do to dash into the stream, for his
progress would be so checked that he would become the best of
targets for his enemies.</p>

<p>Recalling where he had last seen Geronimo and his bucks, Mendez
rode in that direction. He knew he would not find them there,
for his last glimpse showed them leaving the spot, but he made
his way thither without detecting the first sign of them.</p>

<p>In the strong moonlight, the scout could readily see the footprints
of the horses, without leaning over from the back of his own steed.
The trail led up the stream, keeping quite near it, and then,
to the surprise of the scout, it circled to the left and away
from the water.</p>

<p>He could not fathom the meaning of this, nor indeed did he try
to do so, for the special necessity did not exist, but he kept
to it, his horse advancing slowly, while the rider peered into
the gloom on every hand. The situation became more critical every
moment.</p>

<p>The trail showed that the raiders were keeping well together
and their animals were walking. Here and there diverging hoofprints
indicated that one or more of the horsemen had drawn off from
the main body, or else two separate trails crossed each other.</p>

<p>The circle swept inward upon the plain, and by and by turned
backward, that is to the west. To the astonishment of Mendez,
it began approaching the stream, as if the hostiles meant to recross
it. If this were the fact, Potter, who had gone down the bank
of the creek would probably be the first to discover the Apaches.</p>

<p>The probability of this issue caused the dusky scout uneasiness,
for the raiders being on the same side with the troopers were
likely to locate them before being observed, thus securing a perilous
advantage, to say nothing of the great danger in which Potter
would be placed, despite his skill and experience.</p>

<p>Mendez was approaching the stream, whose smooth surface gleamed
in the moonlight, when his steed quietly stopped. He made no sound,
but pricked his ears.</p>

<p>This was enough, for his owner knew what it meant. An enemy was
near. Less than a minute was sufficient to place him. He was directly
ahead, and like Mendez was mounted, being probably one of the
hostile scouts that had been sent to the rear to watch for just
such attempts as were now making against them.</p>

<p>The situation assumed the interesting phase of two highly trained
scouts maneuvering against each other. Wonderful as was the skill
of Mendez, it did not surpass that of his enemy, whose horse was
also the equal of the one ridden by the other.</p>

<p>The pony of the scout had shown astonishing quickness in detecting
the presence of the other equine, but at precisely the same moment
the latter warned his rider of the approach of the other. Both
halted and for a minute or more remained motionless. Then Mendez
made the curious discovery that his foe was gradually fading from
sight.</p>

<p>There was no mystery in this vanishment, however, which was in
accord with natural laws. The hostile had whirled his animal around
with a quickness which could not be noted at that distance, and
began walking him toward the stream, closely watching at the same
time the movements of the foe thus thrown to the rear.</p>

<p>Instead of following, Mendez waited until the other had passed
out of his field of vision. Then he turned abruptly to the left
and rode to the edge of the stream. There he and his animal again
became stationary.</p>

<p>The rider was listening and looking. The eyes told him nothing,
but a faint splashing noise, several times repeated, came to him.
He interpreted it as meaning that the horseman whom he had seen
was crossing the creek.</p>

<p>This of itself was of little importance, but Mendez accepted
it as evidence that the whole band had done the same thing some
time before, and the horseman was now on his way to rejoin them.
So convinced indeed was Mendez on this point that he guided his
animal carefully into the water and forded the stream, without
searching out the place where Geronimo and his hostiles had also
crossed.</p>
