<p>The sun was half-way down the sky when the canoe containing the
explorers, and accompanied by the smaller craft impelled by Ziffak,
rounded a bend of the upper Xingu and came in sight of the village
of the Murhapas.</p>

<p>The herculean native gave an extra sweep of his paddle which
sent his boat slightly in advance of the other, and, striking
the shore, he sprang out and turned about to wait for them to
disembark.</p>

<p>The scene was an impressive one, which every member of the company
was sure to remember the rest of his life.</p>

<p>The huts in which these strange people made their homes were
similar in structure to those of the Aryks, but instead of being
built around the three sides of a rectangle, composed one row,
numbering more than a hundred, and facing the river.  They stood
a hundred yards from the water, and being at the top of the sloping
bank were above the reach of the most violent freshet that ever
came down from the mountain-fed sources of the mighty Xingu.</p>

<p>The ground in front of this novel town was cleared of all trees
and undergrowth, but for most of the space was covered with bright
green grass; the whole having the appearance of a well-kept lawn
that had been artificially sodded or strewn with seed, which flourished
with the luxuriance of every species of vegetation in that tropic
country.</p>

<p>Not only in front, but on the sides and to the rear, for an extent
of more than a hundred acres, the earth had been cleared with
equal thoroughness and was growing abundant crops of cotton, tobacco,
and edibles peculiar to the region.</p>

<p>The houses were separated by a space of several rods, so that
the town itself extended a long way along the water.  The dwellings,
like those of the Aryks, consisted of a single story, with the
door in the middle of the front, a window-like opening on each
side of the same, roofed over with poles, covered with earth,
leaves and grass, that were impervious to wind and storm.</p>

<p>It seemed to the astonished whites that the entire population
had gathered along the shore to receive them.  Several strange
sights impressed them.  The men were large, sinewy, bushy-haired
and athletic. Some sported bows and arrows, but the majority by
far carried the spears which the explorers held in such dread. 
There was no native, so far as they could see, who was the equal
in size and strength of Ziffak, but they were so much the superiors
of any natives encountered since leaving the Amazon, that it was
easy to understand how they were the lords and masters of all
the tribes with which they came in conflict.</p>

<p>We have spoken of the Murhapa houses as being but a single story
in height.  There was a single exception.  In the middle of the
town was a broader and larger structure than the others.  It was
two stories high and so much more marked in every respect that
it was easy to decide that it was the residence or palace of Haffgo,
the king of these people.</p>

<p>Another singular feature was noticed by our friends as they stepped
from their canoe.  Among the natives, who were mostly as dark
of skin as Africans, was a sprinkling so different that the inference
was that they belonged to some other race, or that nature was
accustomed to play some strange freak in this almost unknown part
of the world.</p>

<p>The king and his daughter Ariel had complexions as fair as the
natives of Georgia and Persia, and yet Ziffak, a full brother
of Haffgo, was as ebon-tinted as the darkest warrior of the tribe. 
Since the features of all were similar in a general way the cause
was one that could not be explained.</p>

<p>It was a moment when the new-comers fully appreciated the value
of a friend at court.  They felt that had each possessed a dozen
repeating Winchesters they would have been of no avail after leaving
their canoe and entering the village.  They had now placed their
lives in the hands of Ziffak, and, should he choose to desert
them, they were doomed; it was too late to retreat.</p>

<p>Many of the warriors scowled at the white men and their two helpers
as though they would have been glad to impale them with their
spears, but no demonstration was made.  Evidently Ziffak possessed
unlimited power and was backed by the pledge of the king.</p>

<p>Professor Grimcke was the first to step ashore, Ashman and Long
following immediately.  The three whites formed abreast, while
Bippo and Pedros covered [Transcriber's note: cowered?] so close
that it was hard for them to keep from stepping on their heels. 
Ziffak placed himself at the head, as the escort, and moved up
the sloping bank with the dignity of a conqueror.</p>

<p>The women, showed more taste in their dress, for all wore loose-fitting
gowns of native cloth, gaudily colored, though the children were
attired similarly to the men, with little more than a breech cloth
about the loins.  Even the boys of a most tender age were each
armed with a javelin, none of them, however, having the points
of the weapons poisoned as did their fathers and elders when on
the war-path.</p>

<p>Another striking characteristic of these people was the abundance
of gold and diamond ornaments.  Not a woman was visible from whose
ears were not suspended heavy rings of the precious metal, while
the majority had diamonds fastened in the gold, all of several
carats' weight, and some so large and brilliant that they would
have sold for immense sums in a civilized country.</p>

<p>The older females had not only rings hanging from their ears,
but still more valuable ornaments depended from their noses. 
It would have enriched an army to loot the Murhapa village.</p>

<p>Each of the whites carried his Winchester, and Bippo and Pedros
did not forget their almost harmless spears; but the rifle of
Johnston was left behind with the valuable property.</p>

<p>At the moment of starting, Ziffak called to two warriors and
said something in a commanding voice.  They instantly hastened
to the edge of the water and placed themselves in front of the
large canoe.  Their action left no doubt they were obeying an
order to guard the treasures during the absence of the owners.</p>

<p>Reaching the top of the bank, the party were in what might be
called the main or only street of the town.  The grass had been
worn smooth by the feet of the villagers, among whom was not a
dog, cat, horse, and, indeed, any four-footed animal.</p>

<p>The visitors had landed near the lower end of the village, so
that it was necessary to walk some way before reaching the house
of the king, which was their destination.</p>

<p>As they started, the whole population began falling in behind
them. The terrified Bippo and Pedros shrank still closer to those
in front, trembling and affrighted, for the experience to which
they were subjected was enough to upset them morally, mentally
and physically.</p>

<p>Ziffak turned his head with such a threatening scowl that the
foremost instantly fell back, dreading his vengeance, but when
he faced the other way, they began crowding forward again.</p>

<p>There must have been that in the appearance and action of Bippo
and Pedros which excited the latent mirth of the Murhapas, for
say what we may, the trait exists in a greater or less degree
in all human beings. One of them reached forward with his javelin
and gave Bippo a sharp prick.  With a howl, he leaped several
feet in air and yelled that he was killed.</p>

<p>There was an instant expansion of dark faces into grins, showing
an endless array of black stained, teeth, for the spear point
was not poisoned, and the incident caused a laugh on the part
of his white friends when they came to know the whole truth.</p>

<p>But the author of the practical joke had reckoned without his
host. The cry had hardly escaped the victim, when Ziffak bounded
to the rear like a cyclone.  The fellow who was a full grown warrior
was still grinning with delight, when he found himself in the
terrific grasp of the head chieftain.  It was then his turn to
utter a shriek of affright, which availed him nothing.</p>

<p>Ziffak first smote him to the earth by a single tremendous blow. 
Then, before he could rise to his feet, he grasped his ankles,
one with either hand, and swung him round his head, as a child
whirls a sling, before throwing the stone.</p>

<p>To the awed spectators he seemed a black ring of fire, so dizzyingly
swift were the gyrations, from the midst of which came a buzzing
moan of terror.</p>

<p>Only for a second or two was he subjected to this torture.  Suddenly
Ziffak ran toward the Xingu and then let go of the ankles.  The
black, limp object went spinning far out in the air, as if driven
from some enormous catapult.</p>

<p>Across the remaining space he went, falling several feet from
shore and disappearing beneath the surface.  But such fellows
are extinguished with difficulty, and the cold water quickly revived
him.</p>

<p>By and by he came up, blew the moisture from his mouth, swam
to shore, climbed timidly out, and, sneaking up the bank again,
humbly took his place at the rear of the procession.</p>

<p>But Ziffak, having disposed of the joker, paid no further attention
to him, caring naught whether he swam or was drowned.  The lesson
was one that he would not forget, and produced a salutary effect
upon the rest of the multitude.  They instantly fell back so far
that Bippo, finding he had not been seriously hurt, saw that he
was safe from further disturbance.</p>

<p>It was only a few minutes later that Ziffak halted, his friends
immediately doing the same.</p>

<p>The cause was apparent: they had reached the dwelling place of
Haffgo king of the Murhapas.</p>
