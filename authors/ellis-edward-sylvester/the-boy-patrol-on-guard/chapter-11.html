<p>"Halt!" The Boy Scouts were tramping forward, chatting and laughing
and paying less attention than at first to the varieties of trees
which constantly appeared before them. It was true, as Uncle Elk
had seen, that they were a wee bit tired of imbibing knowledge,
and disposed to think of the home of the old man which they knew
could not be far off. At the sound of his crisp command, the party
halted and looked expectantly at him. On his part, he calmly surveyed
the array of bright faces as if the sight gave him rare pleasure,
as it undoubtedly did. Pausing for a moment, he said, addressing
the whole body:</p>

<p>"I wish you to separate and start on a hunt, each for himself.
You must not go more than a hundred yards in any direction from
where I am standing. Within that area you are to make diligent
search for the trail of some animal of the woods that has passed
within the last twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"Is that <em>all</em>?" asked Mike loftily.</p>

<p>"No; it will not be enough to discover his tracks, but you must
tell me his name and some of his peculiarities."</p>

<p>"Suppose the spalpeen hasn’t got any name?" suggested Mike.</p>

<p>"There is no such creature, my lad; to the one who first succeeds
I shall give a handsome prize."</p>

<p>There could be no mistaking this direct challenge. The boys looked
at one another for a moment and then fell apart as energetically
as if a smoking bomb had dropped among them. They were more anxious
to win a compliment from their Instructor than to gain anything
in the nature of a prize. They had formed not only a deep respect
but a real affection for the man; due to his lovable disposition
and in a slight degree to the mystery which overshadowed his life.</p>

<p>Had you been a spectator of the picture, you would have thought
some valuable jewel or treasure had been lost among the leaves,
and every lad was the owner of the same. Never did two score bright
eyes scan the ground more closely; the boys seemed oblivious of
everything else in the world, and as the minutes passed their
earnestness grew tense.</p>

<p>Uncle Elk nodded to Scout Master Hall, and the two sat down on
a broad, flat boulder and watched proceedings. When they spoke
to each other it was in guarded undertones. That there was a vein
of waggery in the old gentleman’s makeup was proved by the fact
that the Scout Master seemed to be trying hard to repress his
merriment over certain remarks which Uncle Elk took pains that
no one should overhear. Now and then when one of the boys looked
at the couple, Mr. Hall’s face assumed a sudden gravity which
vanished the instant the lad’s attention returned to the task
before him. The Instructor easily hid his emotions, since his
heavy beard served as a curtain, but his amusement was as great
as that of the younger man. In fact, the Scout Master more than
once heard a distinct chuckle.</p>

<p>It will be understood that the problem before the scouts was
not only a hard one but it grew harder as the search progressed.
They could not help disturbing the leaves as they passed to and
fro, no matter how careful they were, and this disturbance increased
each minute, because the diameter of the space was no more than
two hundred yards. It was interesting to observe the care used
by each boy not to "jump the reservation." Every now and then,
one of them would stop his work, raise his head and locate his
comrades. Rather than run the risk of wandering too far, he would
edge nearer to the two men seated on the boulder and watching
his actions.</p>

<p>Several times a lad uttered an exclamation, believing he had
caught sight of the footprints of some denizen of the woods. Instantly,
several ran to him and joined in the scrutiny, but in each instance
the belief of success became doubtful, finally vanished and the
hunt went on as before. Upon many the conviction gradually forced
itself that they had essayed that which was impossible.</p>

<p>It was natural perhaps that the attention of the couple on the
boulder should center upon Mike Murphy, who was the most ardent
searcher of them all. He examined the ground near the spectators,
but soon shifted to the periphery, as it may be called, of the
big circle. With his buckthorn in hand, he poked among the leaves,
so rumpling and overturning them that he would have obscured all
the footprints that at first were visible. Unlike the others,
Mike made visual search through the branches of the trees. After
studying the ground for a while, he would straighten up and peer
here and there among the limbs, as if certain that the answer
to the problem would there reveal itself.</p>

<p>"I’ve an idea," he said to himself, "that it’s a grizzly bear
or a big tiger that is prowling round, and scrooching among the
leaves. If he should drop down on me shoulder and begin clawing
me head, it would be as bad as when Terry Googan had the coort
house fall on top of him—whisht!"</p>

<p>Mike was thrilled at the moment by the discovery of that which
he believed was the lost trail. Suppressing his emotions, he first
made certain that none of the scouts was looking at him. He was
vastly relieved to note that all were so absorbed in their own
work that for the time they were oblivious. He did not glance
in the direction of the two spectators on the boulder, for they
were "out of it."</p>

<p>Devoting several minutes to a closer study of a depression near
a decayed stump, Mike poked the leaves gently apart with his cane.
Then he chortled, and turning about sauntered indifferently toward
his friends, swinging his cane as if it were a swagger stick,
and humming softly to himself.</p>

<p>"By the way," remarked Scout Master Hall, as he and his friend
heard the soft musical notes, "Alvin and Chester tell me that
Mike is gifted with a marvelous voice. A prima donna on the steamer
was so impressed by it that she offered to educate him for the
operatic stage, but Mike won’t think of such a thing."</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard him sing?"</p>

<p>"No, but I intend soon to do so. He is modest with his gift,
but is always ready to oblige. He seems to have learned something."</p>

<p>Mike had ceased his humming, and halting a few paces in front
of the two made a quick half salute. The Scout Master’s face became
serious and the manner of Uncle Elk could not have been graver.</p>

<p>"Have you come to make your report, Michael?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I hev, sorr."</p>

<p>"I hope you have been successful."</p>

<p>"I hev, sorr; I’ve found the futprints of the cratur that is
trying to steal into the camp and ate us all up."</p>

<p>"That’s fine; but remember you must tell me what kind of a wild
animal it is."</p>

<p>"I’m prepared to do the same."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Hall and I are listening."</p>

<p>"It’s an elephant."</p>

<p>Noting the start of the two, Mike made haste to add:</p>

<p>"I knowed it would astonish ye, but I’m as sartin, as was me
mither’s second cousin whin he was accused of being the meanest
man in siven counties."</p>

<p>"What reason have you for thinking the creature is an elephant?"</p>

<p>"The futprint is the biggest iver made; the elephant is the biggest
animal that roams these woods; <em>therefore</em> the track is
that of one of them craturs."</p>

<p>"Your logic is ingenious, Michael, but you do not produce the
elephant."</p>

<p>"I’ve an idea that he’s hiding somewhere in the branches of the
trees," was the imperturbable reply of the Irish youth, who glanced
up among the nearest limbs as if he expected to see the giant
quadruped lurking there.</p>

<p>"Mike," interposed Scout Master Hall, "the elephant is not found
in this country; you have made a mistake."</p>

<p>"Why, there isn’t a traveling circus that doesn’t have a half
dozen more or less of ’em; what’s to prevint one from bidding
good bye to his frinds and starting out to have a shindy with
a lot of Boy Scouts?"</p>

<p>By this time, it dawned upon the two men that the whole thing
was a jest on the part of Mike. Convinced that neither he nor
his companions could find the trail for which they had been searching,
he yielded to his waggish propensity, as fully aware of the absurdity
of his words as were those to whom he submitted his theory.</p>

<p>The fact that the three persons by the boulder were discussing
some interesting question had been observed by the other lads,
who began strolling in that direction. Uncle Elk and Mr. Hall
kept their seats and looked smilingly up into the expectant faces.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," said the Instructor sighing as if with disappointment,
"that you have not been successful in your search."</p>

<p>The unanimous nodding of heads answered his query.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you why you failed?"</p>

<p>The same response followed.</p>

<p>"It is because you have been hunting for something which doesn’t
exist; there is no animal’s trail within a hundred yards of this
spot."</p>

<p>Scout Master Hall made no further effort to restrain his merriment.
He turned partly on one side and laughed till he nearly fell off
the boulder. Uncle Elk’s shoulders bobbed up and down and from
behind the thicket of snow white whiskers issued sounds such as
are made by water gurgling from the mouth of a bottle. The scouts
like sensible lads enjoyed the joke none the less because they
were the victims. They slapped one another on the shoulder, several
flung up their hats and shouted, and two of them gave a fine imitation
of a Scotchman dancing the Highland Fling.</p>

<p>As might be expected, Mike Murphy was the first to regain his
wits. The tempest of jollity had hardly passed, when he said:</p>

<p>"It minds me of the time when I was snoring on board the launch
<em>Deerfut</em>, draaming of watermelons and praties, whin a
spalpeen, without asking me permission, picked me up and flung
me overboard where the water was ’leven miles deep and I had niver
swum a stroke in me life."</p>

<p>"Did you drown?" asked Isaac Rothstein in pretended dismay.</p>

<p>"I s’pose I oughter done so, but I changed me mind and swum to
shore."</p>

<p>(You will recall that, incredible as this may sound, it is precisely
what occurred.)</p>

<p>"I don’t see the similarity between that incident and this,"
remarked Chester Haynes.</p>

<p>"For the raison that there isn’t any, which is why I call it
to mind. Don’t ye obsarve that ye have been looking fur that which
isn’t, as Uncle Elk has explained, and which is the same in me
own case? The stoopidity of some folks is scand’lous, as Mickey
Shaughnessy said whin his taycher expicted him to know how much
two and two make whin the same are added togither."</p>

<p>"Well, boys," spoke up the Instructor as he rose to his feet,
"there’s a time for all things. We have had our jest and now must
get down to business again. I suspect you know a little more about
our native trees than you did when we left the bungalow, and you
may digest that which you have swallowed. As the expression goes,
the incident is closed. My next requirement is that you shall
join forces and start a fire."</p>

<p>The request was so simple that the boys suspected the old man
was indulging in another bit of pleasantry, noting which he added:</p>

<p>"I am in earnest; I wish you to unite your skill and kindle a
blaze right in front of the boulder where Mr. Hall and I have
been sitting."</p>

<p>Gerald Hume of the Eagle Patrol laughed. "Nothing can be easier.
All we have to do is to gather some dry leaves, pine cones and
twigs, and touch them off with a match. We are allowed to use
no more than two matches, and in a case like this one ought to
be enough."</p>

<p>"A condition that I insist upon is that you shall not employ
even a single match." </p>
