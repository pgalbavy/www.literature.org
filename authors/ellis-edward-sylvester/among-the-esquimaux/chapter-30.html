<p>The night slowly settled over the snow waste, and the little
party, feeling no discomfort because of the cold, gradually sank
into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Just before slumber weighed down their eye-lids the dismal howl
of a wolf echoed faintly across the plain. All heard it, and Jack
and the boys believed that one of the brutes had struck the trail
of the hunters, and would soon be hot upon it, with an eager pack
at his heels. Jack asked the Esquimau whether they ought not to
prepare for a fight, but he replied that there were no preparations
to make. Each had his loaded gun and a good supply of ammunition;
they could fight as well there as in any other place.</p>

<p>Docak showed no trepidation of voice and manner, and his coolness
had a good effect upon the others. They were sure that, if there
was any cause for alarm, he would feel it.</p>

<p>This confidence proved well placed; for that single cry was all
that reached their ears. They slept, and were not molested.</p>

<p>But sometime during the night the fine snow began sifting downward,
falling so gently that even the Esquimau was not disturbed. Through
the long gloomy hours it silently descended, until when the daylight
stole over the desolate plain, fully six inches had been added
to the mass that covered the earth long before.</p>

<p>Sitting nearly upright and back to back, the pressure upon the
sleepers was so slight and gradual that no discomfort resulted.
All were so worn out that their slumber was profound, doubtless
lasting as long as it would have done had no such snowfall taken
place.</p>

<p>It was Jack Cosgrove who first opened his eyes, and his amazement
may be imagined when he saw their laps buried out of sight, only
the outlines of their limbs showing, while head and shoulders
were weighted down with the feathery mass.</p>

<p>"By the great horned spoon!" he called, shaking himself free
and rising to his feet, with such a flurry that the others were
aroused; "wake up, for we're all snowed under, and, if we wait
a few minutes longer, we'll be buried clean out of sight."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" called Rob, being the next to climb to his
feet; "has the snow tumbled in on us?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and more of it is tumbling every minute."</p>

<p>Docak was astonished that he had not been the first to awake,
for his mind was burdened with anxiety for the rest. He forgot
that, inasmuch as his labors had been far greater than theirs,
his weariness of body was in more need of rest.</p>

<p>"What time be it?" he asked of the boys, who carried watches.</p>

<p>The answer showed that day had dawned more than two hours before.
He sighed at the knowledge of the precious time wasted. Harder
work than ever was before them, and when night came again they
might count themselves fortunate if one-half the remaining distance
was accomplished.</p>

<p>Rising to their feet, with their heads above the surface, they
found the snow falling so fast that they could not see fifty feet
in any direction.</p>

<p>"How can Docak keep his bearings?" asked Rob, in a low voice,
of the others, when the native, walking a few feet, paused and
looked earnestly about him.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem to me that it is any harder for him to do so
than it was yesterday when there was no snow falling."</p>

<p>"There is a big difference. We couldn't have done any better
in the one case than the other, but he could see the sky. He knew
where the sun was, though we did not; and there must have been
something in the looks of the landscape to help, but there is
none of that now."</p>

<p>"I can give you the right answer to Fred's question," said Jack,
in the same guarded undertone.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"When you ask whether Docak can keep the p'ints of the compass
in his mind, and make sure that he is heading straight for home,
the real answer is&mdash;he can't."</p>

<p>There could be no denying that the sailor spoke the truth. The
native, like the Indians further south, may have possessed a subtle
skill in the respect named beyond the comprehension of his more
civilized neighbors, but, in all cases, there is a limit to such
ability. Where there is nothing to afford guide or clue no living
man can walk in a straight line&mdash;hour after hour, or hold his
way undeviatingly toward a fixed point of the compass.</p>

<p>But, admitting this unquestioned truth, nothing was more self-evident
than that it was sure death to stay where they were; the one and
only thing left to them was to push on while the opportunity was
theirs.</p>

<p>The Esquimau was a man of deeds rather than words. He showed
no disposition to discuss the situation, and, beyond a few insignificant
words, said nothing to his companions, who were as eager to be
on the move as he. He stood a minute or two in study, and then,
uttering the words:</p>

<p>"Come on&mdash;work hard&mdash;neber stop," began pushing through the snow
with the vigor shown the day before.</p>

<p>The others followed in the order named, and with a resolution
as strong as his to keep it up to the last verge of endurance.</p>

<p>It was necessary. In no other way could they escape the frightful
doom that impended. Another condition was equally necessary; their
efforts must be rightly directed. The guide must lead them toward
the sea-coast. Had he the power to do so? The test was now going
on, and the question would soon be settled.</p>

<p>They were terrible words spoken by Jack, but the time had passed
when he felt it necessary to mince matters. He had done so at
the beginning, but his companions were not children unable to
bear the truth, however unpleasant it might be.</p>

<p>But, despite the good reason in what he said, neither Rob nor
Fred quite credited its full meaning. While they could not explain
how any person could guide himself unerringly, when there was
no visible help for the eye, they believed that somehow or other
he would "get there just the same."</p>

<p>They proved their own earnestness when Docak, after a long struggle
through the clogging snow, stopped, turned about, and said:</p>

<p>"You be tired&mdash;then rest awhile."</p>

<p>"No," responded Fred, "I want no rest."</p>

<p>"Push on, then," added Rob, "unless you are tired yourself, Docak."</p>

<p>The idea that the native needed rest caused him a half-smile,
as he faced forward and resumed his weary plowing through the
snowy mass.</p>

<p>There was no call now to watch the countenances of the youths
to protect them against freezing. The weather was so moderate
that they would have felt more comfortable with their outer covering
removed. If the blizzard had come back, it was in such a mild
form that it could lay no claim to the name. It was simply snowing
hard, and there was only a breath of air at intervals. Had there
been anything approaching the hurricane of two days before, they
could not have fought their way for a single rod.</p>

<p>When the guide, after another long interval, proposed a brief
rest, it was acquiesced in by all. They had kept at it longer
than before, and the pause must have been grateful to Docak himself.</p>

<p>"We are not going fast," remarked Rob, "but I am sure we have
covered a good deal of ground since starting, and when we go into
camp to-night there ought not to be many miles between us and
the sea."</p>

<p>"Remember the mistake we made in our calculations," said Fred,
warningly, "and don't count too much."</p>

<p>"How far have we come?" asked Jack, putting the question directly
to the Esquimau.</p>

<p>"Dunno," he answered, turning about and resuming his labor.</p>

<p>"That's the last time I will ask him anything," growled the sailor,
displeased at the curt treatment.</p>

<p>A sad story awaits our pen. The poor hunters toiled on, on, on,
slower and still more slowly, with the snow falling thicker and
still more thickly, and the uncertainty growing more intensified
as the day wore away. With short intervals of rest they kept at
it with heroic courage, until at last the shades of night began
closing once more around them. Then, all of a sudden, the Esquimau
uttered a despairing cry and threw himself down in the snow.</p>

<p>  [Illustration: <em>THE ESQUIMAU UTTERED A DESPAIRING CRY AND
THREW   HIMSELF IN THE SNOW</em></p>

<p>  (See page 277)]</p>

<p>He had made a terrifying discovery. They had come back to the
very spot where they spent the previous night. All day long they
had journeyed in an irregular circle, as lost persons almost invariably
do, and the dreadful labor was utterly thrown away.</p>

<p>The Esquimau had essayed a task beyond his power, and he now
threw up his hands and would struggle no more.</p>
