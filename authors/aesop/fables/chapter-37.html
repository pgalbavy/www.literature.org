A GOATHERD had sought to bring back a stray goat to his flock. 
He whistled and sounded his horn in vain; the straggler paid no
attention to the summons.  At last the Goatherd threw a stone,
and breaking its horn, begged the Goat not to tell his master. 
The Goat replied, "Why, you silly fellow, the horn will speak
though I be silent."  
 
Do not attempt to hide things which cannot be hid.
