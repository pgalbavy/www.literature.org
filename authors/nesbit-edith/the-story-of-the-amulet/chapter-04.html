Next morning Anthea got old Nurse to allow her to take up the
'poor learned gentleman's' breakfast.  He did not recognize her
at first, but when he did he was vaguely pleased to see her.</p>

<p>'You see I'm wearing the charm round my neck,' she said; 'I'm
taking care of it - like you told us to.'</p>

<p>'That's right,' said he; 'did you have a good game last night?'</p>

<p>'You will eat your breakfast before it's cold, won't you?' said
Anthea.  'Yes, we had a splendid time.  The charm made it all
dark, and then greeny light, and then it spoke.  Oh! I wish you
could have heard it - it was such a darling voice - and it told us
the other half of it was lost in the Past, so of course we shall
have to look for it there!'</p>

<p>The learned gentleman rubbed his hair with both hands and looked
anxiously at Anthea.</p>

<p>'I suppose it's natural - youthful imagination and so forth,' he
said.  'Yet someone must have ...  Who told you that some part of
the charm was missing?'</p>

<p>'I can't tell you,' she said.  'I know it seems most awfully
rude, especially after being so kind about telling us the name of
power, and all that, but really, I'm not allowed to tell anybody
anything about the - the - the person who told me.  You won't
forget your breakfast, will you?'</p>

<p>The learned gentleman smiled feebly and then frowned - not a
cross-frown, but a puzzle-frown.</p>

<p>'Thank you,' he said, 'I shall always be pleased if you'll look
in - any time you're passing you know - at least ...'</p>

<p>'I will,' she said; 'goodbye.  I'll always tell you anything I
MAY tell.'</p>

<p>He had not had many adventures with children in them, and he
wondered whether all children were like these.  He spent quite
five minutes in wondering before he settled down to the
fifty-second chapter of his great book on 'The Secret Rites of
the Priests of Amen Ra'.</p>

<p>It is no use to pretend that the children did not feel a good
deal of agitation at the thought of going through the charm into
the Past.  That idea, that perhaps they might stay in the Past
and never get back again, was anything but pleasing.  Yet no one
would have dared to suggest that the charm should not be used;
and though each was in its heart very frightened indeed, they
would all have joined in jeering at the cowardice of any one of
them who should have uttered the timid but natural suggestion,
'Don't let's!'</p>

<p>It seemed necessary to make arrangements for being out all day,
for there was no reason to suppose that the sound of the
dinner-bell would be able to reach back into the Past, and it
seemed unwise to excite old Nurse's curiosity when nothing they
could say - not even the truth - could in any way satisfy it.  They
were all very proud to think how well they had understood what
the charm and the Psammead had said about Time and Space and
things like that, and they were perfectly certain that it would
be quite impossible to make old Nurse understand a single word of
it.  So they merely asked her to let them take their dinner out
into Regent's Park - and this, with the implied cold mutton and
tomatoes, was readily granted.</p>

<p>'You can get yourselves some buns or sponge-cakes, or whatever
you fancy-like,' said old Nurse, giving Cyril a shilling.  'Don't
go getting jam-tarts, now - so messy at the best of times, and
without forks and plates ruination to your clothes, besides your
not being able to wash your hands and faces afterwards.'</p>

<p>So Cyril took the shilling, and they all started off.  They went
round by the Tottenham Court Road to buy a piece of waterproof
sheeting to put over the Psammead in case it should be raining in
the Past when they got there.  For it is almost certain death to
a Psammead to get wet.</p>

<p>The sun was shining very brightly, and even London looked pretty. 
Women were selling roses from big baskets-full, and Anthea bought
four roses, one each, for herself and the others.  They were red
roses and smelt of summer - the kind of roses you always want so
desperately at about Christmas-time when you can only get
mistletoe, which is pale right through to its very scent, and
holly which pricks your nose if you try to smell it.  So now
everyone had a rose in its buttonhole, and soon everyone was
sitting on the grass in Regent's Park under trees whose leaves
would have been clean, clear green in the country, but here were
dusty and yellowish, and brown at the edges.</p>

<p>'We've got to go on with it,' said Anthea, 'and as the eldest has
to go first, you'll have to be last, Jane.  You quite understand
about holding on to the charm as you go through, don't you,
Pussy?'</p>

<p>'I wish I hadn't got to be last,' said Jane.</p>

<p>'You shall carry the Psammead if you like,' said Anthea.  'That
is,' she added, remembering the beast's queer temper, 'if it'll
let you.'</p>

<p>The Psammead, however, was unexpectedly amiable.</p>

<p>'<span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> don't mind,' it said, 'who carries me, so long as it doesn't
drop me.  I can't bear being dropped.'</p>

<p>Jane with trembling hands took the Psammead and its fish-basket
under one arm.  The charm's long string was hung round her neck. 
Then they all stood up.  Jane held out the charm at arm's length,
and Cyril solemnly pronounced the word of power.</p>

<p>As he spoke it the charm grew tall and broad, and he saw that
Jane was just holding on to the edge of a great red arch of very
curious shape.  The opening of the arch was small, but Cyril saw
that he could go through it.  All round and beyond the arch were
the faded trees and trampled grass of Regent's Park, where the
little ragged children were playing Ring-o'-Roses.  But through
the opening of it shone a blaze of blue and yellow and red. 
Cyril drew a long breath and stiffened his legs so that the
others should not see that his knees were trembling and almost
knocking together.  'Here goes!' he said, and, stepping up
through the arch, disappeared.  Then followed Anthea.  Robert,
coming next, held fast, at Anthea's suggestion, to the sleeve of
Jane, who was thus dragged safely through the arch.  And as soon
as they were on the other side of the arch there was no more arch
at all and no more Regent's Park either, only the charm in Jane's
hand, and it was its proper size again.  They were now in a light
so bright that they winked and blinked and rubbed their eyes. 
During this dazzling interval Anthea felt for the charm and
pushed it inside Jane's frock, so that it might be quite safe. 
When their eyes got used to the new wonderful light the children
looked around them.  The sky was very, very blue, and it sparkled
and glittered and dazzled like the sea at home when the sun
shines on it.</p>

<p>They were standing on a little clearing in a thick, low forest;
there were trees and shrubs and a close, thorny, tangly
undergrowth.  In front of them stretched a bank of strange black
mud, then came the browny-yellowy shining ribbon of a river. 
Then more dry, caked mud and more greeny-browny jungle.  The only
things that told that human people had been there were the
clearing, a path that led to it, and an odd arrangement of cut
reeds in the river.</p>

<p>They looked at each other.</p>

<p>'Well!' said Robert, 'this IS a change of air!'</p>

<p>It was.  The air was hotter than they could have imagined, even
in London in August.</p>

<p>'I wish I knew where we were,' said Cyril.</p>

<p>'Here's a river, now - I wonder whether it's the Amazon or the
Tiber, or what.'</p>

<p>'It's the Nile,' said the Psammead, looking out of the fish-bag.</p>

<p>'Then this is Egypt,' said Robert, who had once taken a geography
prize.</p>

<p>'I don't see any crocodiles,' Cyril objected.  His prize had been
for natural history.</p>

<p>The Psammead reached out a hairy arm from its basket and pointed
to a heap of mud at the edge of the water.</p>

<p>'What do you call that?' it said; and as it spoke the heap of mud
slid into the river just as a slab of damp mixed mortar will slip
from a bricklayer's trowel.</p>

<p>'Oh!' said everybody.</p>

<p>There was a crashing among the reeds on the other side of the
water.</p>

<p>'And there's a river-horse!' said the Psammead, as a great beast
like an enormous slaty-blue slug showed itself against the black
bank on the far side of the stream.</p>

<p>'It's a hippopotamus,' said Cyril; 'it seems much more real
somehow than the one at the Zoo, doesn't it?'</p>

<p>'I'm glad it's being real on the other side of the river,' said
Jane. And now there was a crackling of reeds and twigs behind
them.  This was horrible.  Of course it might be another
hippopotamus, or a crocodile, or a lion - or, in fact, almost
anything.</p>

<p>'Keep your hand on the charm, Jane,' said Robert hastily.  'We
ought to have a means of escape handy.  I'm dead certain this is
the sort of place where simply anything might happen to us.'</p>

<p>'I believe a hippopotamus is going to happen to us,' said
Jane - 'a very, very big one.'</p>

<p>They had all turned to face the danger.</p>

<p>'Don't be silly little duffers,' said the Psammead in its
friendly, informal way; 'it's not a river-horse.  It's a human.'</p>

<p>It was.  It was a girl - of about Anthea's age.  Her hair was
short and fair, and though her skin was tanned by the sun, you
could see that it would have been fair too if it had had a
chance.  She had every chance of being tanned, for she had no
clothes to speak of, and the four English children, carefully
dressed in frocks, hats, shoes, stockings, coats, collars, and
all the rest of it, envied her more than any words of theirs or
of mine could possibly say.  There was no doubt that here was the
right costume for that climate.</p>

<p>She carried a pot on her head, of red and black earthenware.  She
did not see the children, who shrank back against the edge of the
jungle, and she went forward to the brink of the river to fill
her pitcher.  As she went she made a strange sort of droning,
humming, melancholy noise all on two notes.  Anthea could not
help thinking that perhaps the girl thought this noise was
singing.</p>

<p>The girl filled the pitcher and set it down by the river bank. 
Then she waded into the water and stooped over the circle of cut
reeds.  She pulled half a dozen fine fish out of the water within
the reeds, killing each as she took it out, and threading it on a
long osier that she carried.  Then she knotted the osier, hung it
on her arm, picked up the pitcher, and turned to come back.  And
as she turned she saw the four children.  The white dresses of
Jane and Anthea stood out like snow against the dark forest
background.  She screamed and the pitcher fell, and the water was
spilled out over the hard mud surface and over the fish, which
had fallen too.  Then the water slowly trickled away into the
deep cracks.</p>

<p>'Don't be frightened,' Anthea cried, 'we won't hurt you.'</p>

<p>'Who are you?' said the girl.</p>

<p>Now, once for all, I am not going to be bothered to tell you how
it was that the girl could understand Anthea and Anthea could
understand the girl.  YOU, at any rate, would not understand ME,
if I tried to explain it, any more than you can understand about
time and space being only forms of thought.  You may think what
you like.  Perhaps the children had found out the universal
language which everyone can understand, and which wise men so far
have not found.  You will have noticed long ago that they were
singularly lucky children, and they may have had this piece of
luck as well as others.  Or it may have been that ...  but why
pursue the question further?  The fact remains that in all their
adventures the muddle-headed inventions which we call foreign
languages never bothered them in the least.  They could always
understand and be understood.  If you can explain this, please
do.  I daresay I could understand your explanation, though you
could never understand mine.</p>

<p>So when the girl said, 'Who are you?' everyone understood at
once, and Anthea replied - </p>

<p>'We are children - just like you.  Don't be frightened.  Won't you
show us where you live?'</p>

<p>Jane put her face right into the Psammead's basket, and burrowed
her mouth into its fur to whisper - </p>

<p>'Is it safe?  Won't they eat us?  Are they cannibals?'</p>

<p>The Psammead shrugged its fur.</p>

<p>'Don't make your voice buzz like that, it tickles my ears,' it
said rather crossly.  'You can always get back to Regent's Park
in time if you keep fast hold of the charm,' it said.</p>

<p>The strange girl was trembling with fright.</p>

<p>Anthea had a bangle on her arm.  It was a sevenpenny-halfpenny
trumpery thing that pretended to be silver; it had a glass heart
of turquoise blue hanging from it, and it was the gift of the
maid-of-all-work at the Fitzroy Street house. 'Here,' said
Anthea, 'this is for you.  That is to show we will not hurt you. 
And if you take it I shall know that you won't hurt us.'</p>

<p>The girl held out her hand.  Anthea slid the bangle over it, and
the girl's face lighted up with the joy of possession.</p>

<p>'Come,' she said, looking lovingly at the bangle; 'it is peace
between your house and mine.'</p>

<p>She picked up her fish and pitcher and led the way up the narrow
path by which she had come and the others followed.</p>

<p>'This is something like!' said Cyril, trying to be brave.</p>

<p>'Yes!' said Robert, also assuming a boldness he was far from
feeling, 'this really and truly IS an adventure!  Its being in
the Past makes it quite different from the Phoenix and Carpet
happenings.'</p>

<p>The belt of thick-growing acacia trees and shrubs - mostly prickly
and unpleasant-looking - seemed about half a mile across.  The
path was narrow and the wood dark.  At last, ahead, daylight
shone through the boughs and leaves.</p>

<p>The whole party suddenly came out of the wood's shadow into the
glare of the sunlight that shone on a great stretch of yellow
sand, dotted with heaps of grey rocks where spiky cactus plants
showed gaudy crimson and pink flowers among their shabby,
sand-peppered leaves.  Away to the right was something that
looked like a grey-brown hedge, and from beyond it blue smoke
went up to the bluer sky.  And over all the sun shone till you
could hardly bear your clothes.</p>

<p>'That is where I live,' said the girl pointing.</p>

<p>'I won't go,' whispered Jane into the basket, 'unless you say
it's all right.'</p>

<p>The Psammead ought to have been touched by this proof of
confidence.  Perhaps, however, it looked upon it as a proof of
doubt, for it merely snarled - </p>

<p>'If you don't go now I'll never help you again.'</p>

<p>'OH,' whispered Anthea, 'dear Jane, don't!  Think of Father and
Mother and all of us getting our heart's desire.  And we can go
back any minute.  Come on!'</p>

<p>'Besides,' said Cyril, in a low voice, 'the Psammead must know
there's no danger or it wouldn't go.  It's not so over and above
brave itself.  Come on!'</p>

<p>This Jane at last consented to do.</p>

<p>As they got nearer to the browny fence they saw that it was a
great hedge about eight feet high, made of piled-up thorn bushes.</p>

<p>'What's that for?' asked Cyril.</p>

<p>'To keep out foes and wild beasts,' said the girl.</p>

<p>'I should think it ought to, too,' said he.  'Why, some of the
thorns are as long as my foot.'</p>

<p>There was an opening in the hedge, and they followed the girl
through it.  A little way further on was another hedge, not so
high, also of dry thorn bushes, very prickly and
spiteful-looking, and within this was a sort of village of huts.</p>

<p>There were no gardens and no roads.  Just huts built of wood and
twigs and clay, and roofed with great palm-leaves, dumped down
anywhere.  The doors of these houses were very low, like the
doors of dog-kennels.  The ground between them was not paths or
streets, but just yellow sand trampled very hard and smooth.</p>

<p>In the middle of the village there was a hedge that enclosed what
seemed to be a piece of ground about as big as their own garden
in Camden Town.</p>

<p>No sooner were the children well within the inner thorn hedge
than dozens of men and women and children came crowding round
from behind and inside the huts.</p>

<p>The girl stood protectingly in front of the four children, and
said - </p>

<p>'They are wonder-children from beyond the desert.  They bring
marvellous gifts, and I have said that it is peace between us and
them.'</p>

<p>She held out her arm with the Lowther Arcade bangle on it.</p>

<p>The children from London, where nothing now surprises anyone, had
never before seen so many people look so astonished.</p>

<p>They crowded round the children, touching their clothes, their
shoes, the buttons on the boys' jackets, and the coral of the
girls' necklaces.</p>

<p>'Do say something,' whispered Anthea.</p>

<p>'We come,' said Cyril, with some dim remembrance of a dreadful
day when he had had to wait in an outer office while his father
interviewed a solicitor, and there had been nothing to read but
the Daily Telegraph - 'we come from the world where the sun never
sets.  And peace with honour is what we want.  We are the great
Anglo-Saxon or conquering race.  Not that we want to conquer
YOU,' he added hastily.  'We only want to look at your houses and
your - well, at all you've got here, and then we shall return to
our own place, and tell of all that we have seen so that your
name may be famed.'</p>

<p>Cyril's speech didn't keep the crowd from pressing round and
looking as eagerly as ever at the clothing of the children. 
Anthea had an idea that these people had never seen woven stuff
before, and she saw how wonderful and strange it must seem to
people who had never had any clothes but the skins of beasts. 
The sewing, too, of modern clothes seemed to astonish them very
much.  They must have been able to sew themselves, by the way,
for men who seemed to be the chiefs wore knickerbockers of
goat-skin or deer-skin, fastened round the waist with twisted
strips of hide.  And the women wore long skimpy skirts of
animals' skins.  The people were not very tall, their hair was
fair, and men and women both had it short.  Their eyes were blue,
and that seemed odd in Egypt.  Most of them were tattooed like
sailors, only more roughly.</p>

<p>'What is this?  What is this?' they kept asking touching the
children's clothes curiously.</p>

<p>Anthea hastily took off Jane's frilly lace collar and handed it
to the woman who seemed most friendly.</p>

<p>'Take this,' she said, 'and look at it.  And leave us alone.  We
want to talk among ourselves.'</p>

<p>She spoke in the tone of authority which she had always found
successful when she had not time to coax her baby brother to do
as he was told.  The tone was just as successful now.  The
children were left together and the crowd retreated.  It paused a
dozen yards away to look at the lace collar and to go on talking
as hard as it could.</p>

<p>The children will never know what those people said, though they
knew well enough that they, the four strangers, were the subject
of the talk.  They tried to comfort themselves by remembering the
girl's promise of friendliness, but of course the thought of the
charm was more comfortable than anything else.  They sat down on
the sand in the shadow of the hedged-round place in the middle of
the village, and now for the first time they were able to look
about them and to see something more than a crowd of eager,
curious faces.</p>

<p>They here noticed that the women wore necklaces made of beads of
different coloured stone, and from these hung pendants of odd,
strange shapes, and some of them had bracelets of ivory and
flint.</p>

<p>'I say,' said Robert, 'what a lot we could teach them if we
stayed here!'</p>

<p>'I expect they could teach us something too,' said Cyril.  'Did
you notice that flint bracelet the woman had that Anthea gave the
collar to?  That must have taken some making.  Look here, they'll
get suspicious if we talk among ourselves, and I do want to know
about how they do things.  Let's get the girl to show us round,
and we can be thinking about how to get the Amulet at the same
time.  Only mind, we must keep together.'</p>

<p>Anthea beckoned to the girl, who was standing a little way off
looking wistfully at them, and she came gladly.</p>

<p>'Tell us how you make the bracelets, the stone ones,' said Cyril.</p>

<p>'With other stones,' said the girl; 'the men make them; we have
men of special skill in such work.'</p>

<p>'Haven't you any iron tools?'</p>

<p>'Iron,' said the girl, 'I don't know what you mean.'  It was the
first word she had not understood.</p>

<p>'Are all your tools of flint?' asked Cyril. 'Of course,' said the
girl, opening her eyes wide.</p>

<p>I wish I had time to tell you of that talk.  The English children
wanted to hear all about this new place, but they also wanted to
tell of their own country.  It was like when you come back from
your holidays and you want to hear and to tell everything at the
same time.  As the talk went on there were more and more words
that the girl could not understand, and the children soon gave up
the attempt to explain to her what their own country was like,
when they began to see how very few of the things they had always
thought they could not do without were really not at all
necessary to life.</p>

<p>The girl showed them how the huts were made - indeed, as one was
being made that very day she took them to look at it.  The way of
building was very different from ours.  The men stuck long pieces
of wood into a piece of ground the size of the hut they wanted to
make.  These were about eight inches apart; then they put in
another row about eight inches away from the first, and then a
third row still further out.  Then all the space between was
filled up with small branches and twigs, and then daubed over
with black mud worked with the feet till it was soft and sticky
like putty.</p>

<p>The girl told them how the men went hunting with flint spears and
arrows, and how they made boats with reeds and clay.  Then she
explained the reed thing in the river that she had taken the fish
out of.  It was a fish-trap - just a ring of reeds set up in the
water with only one little opening in it, and in this opening,
just below the water, were stuck reeds slanting the way of the
river's flow, so that the fish, when they had swum sillily in,
sillily couldn't get out again.  She showed them the clay pots
and jars and platters, some of them ornamented with black and red
patterns, and the most wonderful things made of flint and
different sorts of stone, beads, and ornaments, and tools and
weapons of all sorts and kinds.</p>

<p>'It is really wonderful,' said Cyril patronizingly, 'when you
consider that it's all eight thousand years ago - '</p>

<p>'I don't understand you,' said the girl.</p>

<p>'It ISN'T eight thousand years ago,' whispered Jane.  'It's
NOW - and that's just what I don't like about it.  I say, DO let's
get home again before anything more happens.  You can see for
yourselves the charm isn't here.'</p>

<p>'What's in that place in the middle?' asked Anthea, struck by a
sudden thought, and pointing to the fence.</p>

<p>'That's the secret sacred place,' said the girl in a whisper. 
'No one knows what is there.  There are many walls, and inside
the insidest one IT is, but no one knows what IT is except the
headsmen.'</p>

<p>'I believe YOU know,' said Cyril, looking at her very hard.</p>

<p>'I'll give you this if you'll tell me,' said Anthea taking off a
bead-ring which had already been much admired.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said the girl, catching eagerly at the ring.  'My father
is one of the heads, and I know a water charm to make him talk in
his sleep.  And he has spoken.  I will tell you.  But if they
know I have told you they will kill me.  In the insidest inside
there is a stone box, and in it there is the Amulet.  None knows
whence it came.  It came from very far away.'</p>

<p>'Have you seen it?' asked Anthea.</p>

<p>The girl nodded.</p>

<p>'Is it anything like this?' asked Jane, rashly producing the
charm.</p>

<p>The girl's face turned a sickly greenish-white.</p>

<p>'Hide it, hide it,' she whispered.  'You must put it back.  If
they see it they will kill us all.  You for taking it, and me for
knowing that there was such a thing.  Oh, woe - woe! why did you
ever come here?'</p>

<p>'Don't be frightened,' said Cyril.  'They shan't know.  Jane,
don't you be such a little jack-ape again - that's all.  You see
what will happen if you do.  Now, tell me - ' He turned to the
girl, but before he had time to speak the question there was a
loud shout, and a man bounded in through the opening in the
thorn-hedge.</p>

<p>'Many foes are upon us!' he cried.  'Make ready the defences!'</p>

<p>His breath only served for that, and he lay panting on the
ground. 'Oh, DO let's go home!' said Jane.  'Look here - I don't
care - I WILL!'</p>

<p>She held up the charm.  Fortunately all the strange, fair people
were too busy to notice HER.  She held up the charm.  And nothing
happened.</p>

<p>'You haven't said the word of power,' said Anthea.</p>

<p>Jane hastily said it - and still nothing happened.</p>

<p>'Hold it up towards the East, you silly!' said Robert.</p>

<p>'Which IS the East?' said Jane, dancing about in her agony of
terror.</p>

<p>Nobody knew.  So they opened the fish-bag to ask the Psammead.</p>

<p>And the bag had only a waterproof sheet in it.</p>

<p>The Psammead was gone.</p>

<p>'Hide the sacred thing!  Hide it!  Hide it!' whispered the girl.</p>

<p>Cyril shrugged his shoulders, and tried to look as brave as he
knew he ought to feel.</p>

<p>'Hide it up, Pussy,' he said.  'We are in for it now.  We've just
got to stay and see it out.'</p>
