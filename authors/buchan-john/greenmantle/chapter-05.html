<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Next morning there was a touch of frost and a nip in the air
which stirred my blood and put me in buoyant spirits. I forgot
my precarious position and the long road I had still to travel.
I came down to breakfast in great form, to find Peter’s even temper
badly ruffled. He had remembered Stumm in the night and disliked
the memory; this he muttered to me as we rubbed shoulders at the
dining-room door. Peter and I got no opportunity for private talk.
The lieutenant was with us all the time, and at night we were
locked in our rooms. Peter discovered this through trying to get
out to find matches, for he had the bad habit of smoking in bed.</p>

<p>Our guide started on the telephone, and announced that we were
to be taken to see a prisoners’ camp. In the afternoon I was to
go somewhere with Stumm, but the morning was for sight-seeing.
"You will see," he told us, "how merciful is a great people. You
will also see some of the hated English in our power. That will
delight you. They are the forerunners of all their nation."</p>

<p>We drove in a taxi through the suburbs and then over a stretch
of flat market-garden-like country to a low rise of wooded hills.
After an hour’s ride we entered the gate of what looked like a
big reformatory or hospital. I believe it had been a home for
destitute children. There were sentries at the gate and massive
concentric circles of barbed wire through which we passed under
an arch that was let down like a portcullis at nightfall. The
lieutenant showed his permit, and we ran the car into a brick-paved
yard and marched through a lot more sentries to the office of
the commandant.</p>

<p>He was away from home, and we were welcomed by his deputy, a
pale young man with a head nearly bald. There were introductions
in German which our guide translated into Dutch, and a lot of
elegant speeches about how Germany was foremost in humanity as
well as martial valour. Then they stood us sandwiches and beer,
and we formed a procession for a tour of inspection. There were
two doctors, both mild-looking men in spectacles, and a couple
of warders—under-officers of the good old burly, bullying sort
I knew well. That was the cement which kept the German Army together.
Her men were nothing to boast of on the average; no more were
the officers, even in crack corps like the Guards and the Brandenburgers;
but they seemed to have an inexhaustible supply of hard, competent
<em>N.C.O.</em>s.</p>

<p>We marched round the wash-houses, the recreation-ground, the
kitchens, the hospital—with nobody in it save one chap with the
"flu." It didn’t seem to be badly done. This place was entirely
for officers, and I expect it was a show place where American
visitors were taken. If half the stories one heard were true there
were some pretty ghastly prisons away in South and East Germany.</p>

<p>I didn’t half like the business. To be a prisoner has always
seemed to me about the worst thing that could happen to a man.
The sight of German prisoners used to give me a bad feeling inside,
whereas I looked at dead Boches with nothing but satisfaction.
Besides, there was the off-chance that I might be recognized.
So I kept very much in the shadow whenever we passed anybody in
the corridors. The few we met passed us incuriously. They saluted
the deputy-commandant, but scarcely wasted a glance on us. No
doubt they thought we were inquisitive Germans come to gloat over
them. They looked fairly fit, but a little puffy about the eyes,
like men who get too little exercise. They seemed thin, too. I
expect the food, for all the commandant’s talk, was nothing to
boast of. In one room people were writing letters. It was a big
place with only a tiny stove to warm it, and the windows were
shut so that the atmosphere was a cold frowst. In another room
a fellow was lecturing on something to a dozen hearers and drawing
figures on a blackboard. Some were in ordinary khaki, others in
any old thing they could pick up, and most wore greatcoats. Your
blood gets thin when you have nothing to do but hope against hope
and think of your pals and the old days.</p>

<p>I was moving along, listening with half an ear to the lieutenant’s
prattle and the loud explanations of the deputy-commandant, when
I pitchforked into what might have been the end of my business.
We were going through a sort of convalescent room, where people
were sitting who had been in hospital. It was a big place, a little
warmer than the rest of the building, but still abominably fuggy.
There were about half a dozen men in the room, reading and playing
games. They looked at us with lack-lustre eyes for a moment, and
then returned to their occupations. Being convalescents I suppose
they were not expected to get up and salute.</p>

<p>All but one, who was playing Patience at a little table by which
we passed. I was feeling very bad about the thing, for I hated
to see these good fellows locked away in this infernal German
hole when they might have been giving the Boche his deserts at
the front. The commandant went first with Peter, who had developed
a great interest in prisons. Then came our lieutenant with one
of the doctors; then a couple of warders; and then the second
doctor and myself. I was absent-minded at the moment and was last
in the queue.</p>

<p>The Patience-player suddenly looked up and I saw his face. I’m
hanged if it wasn’t Dolly Riddell, who was our brigade machine-gun
officer at Loos. I had heard that the Germans had got him when
they blew up a mine at the Quarries.</p>

<p>I had to act pretty quick, for his mouth was agape, and I saw
he was going to speak. The doctor was a yard ahead of me.</p>

<p>I stumbled and spilt his cards on the floor. Then I kneeled to
pick them up and gripped his knee. His head bent to help me and
I spoke low in his ear.</p>

<p>"I’m Hannay all right. For God’s sake don’t wink an eye. I’m
here on a secret job."</p>

<p>The doctor had turned to see what was the matter. I got a few
more words in. "Cheer up, old man. We’re winning hands down."</p>

<p>Then I began to talk excited Dutch and finished the collection
of the cards. Dolly was playing his part well, smiling as if he
was amused by the antics of a monkey. The others were coming back,
the deputy-commandant with an angry light in his dull eye. "Speaking
to the prisoners is forbidden," he shouted.</p>

<p>I looked blankly at him till the lieutenant translated.</p>

<p>"What kind of fellow is he?" said Dolly in English to the doctor.
"He spoils my game and then jabbers High-Dutch at me."</p>

<p>Officially I knew English, and that speech of Dolly’s gave me
my cue. I pretended to be very angry with the very damned Englishman,
and went out of the room close by the deputy-commandant, grumbling
like a sick jackal. After that I had to act a bit. The last place
we visited was the close-confinement part where prisoners were
kept as a punishment for some breach of the rules. They looked
cheerless enough, but I pretended to gloat over the sight, and
said so to the lieutenant, who passed it on to the others. I have
rarely in my life felt such a cad.</p>

<p>On the way home the lieutenant discoursed a lot about prisoners
and detention-camps, for at one time he had been on duty at Ruhleben.
Peter, who had been in quod more than once in his life, was deeply
interested and kept on questioning him. Among other things he
told us was that they often put bogus prisoners among the rest,
who acted as spies. If any plot to escape was hatched these fellows
got into it and encouraged it. They never interfered till the
attempt was actually made and then they had them on toast. There
was nothing the Boche liked so much as an excuse for sending a
poor devil to "solitary".</p>

<p>That afternoon Peter and I separated. He was left behind with
the lieutenant and I was sent off to the station with my bag in
the company of a Landsturm sergeant. Peter was very cross, and
I didn’t care for the look of things; but I brightened up when
I heard I was going somewhere with Stumm. If he wanted to see
me again he must think me of some use, and if he was going to
use me he was bound to let me into his game. I liked Stumm about
as much as a dog likes a scorpion, but I hankered for his society.</p>

<p>At the station platform, where the ornament of the Landsturm
saved me all the trouble about tickets, I could not see my companion.
I stood waiting, while a great crowd, mostly of soldiers, swayed
past me and filled all the front carriages. An officer spoke to
me gruffly and told me to stand aside behind a wooden rail. I
obeyed, and suddenly found Stumm’s eyes looking down at me.</p>

<p>"You know German?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"A dozen words," I said carelessly. "I’ve been to Windhuk and
learned enough to ask for my dinner. Peter—my friend—speaks it
a bit."</p>

<p>"So," said Stumm. "Well, get into the carriage. Not that one!
There, thickhead!"</p>

<p>I did as I was bid, he followed, and the door was locked behind
us. The precaution was needless, for the sight of Stumm’s profile
at the platform end would have kept out the most brazen. I wondered
if I had woken up his suspicions. I must be on my guard to show
no signs of intelligence if he suddenly tried me in German, and
that wouldn’t be easy, for I knew it as well as I knew Dutch.</p>

<p>We moved into the country, but the windows were blurred with
frost, and I saw nothing of the landscape. Stumm was busy with
papers and let me alone. I read on a notice that one was forbidden
to smoke, so to show my ignorance of German I pulled out my pipe.
Stumm raised his head, saw what I was doing, and gruffly bade
me put it away, as if he were an old lady that disliked the smell
of tobacco.</p>

<p>In half an hour I got very bored, for I had nothing to read and
my pipe was <em>verboten</em>. People passed now and then in the
corridors, but no one offered to enter. No doubt they saw the
big figure in uniform and thought he was the deuce of a staff
swell who wanted solitude. I thought of stretching my legs in
the corridor, and was just getting up to do it when somebody slid
the door back and a big figure blocked the light.</p>

<p>He was wearing a heavy ulster and a green felt hat. He saluted
Stumm, who looked up angrily, and smiled pleasantly on us both.</p>

<p>"Say, gentlemen," he said, "have you room in here for a little
one? I guess I’m about smoked out of my car by your brave soldiers.
I’ve gotten a delicate stomach ..."</p>

<p>Stumm had risen with a brow of wrath, and looked as if he were
going to pitch the intruder off the train. Then he seemed to halt
and collect himself, and the other’s face broke into a friendly
grin.</p>

<p>"Why, it’s Colonel Stumm," he cried. (He pronounced it like the
first syllable in "stomach".) "Very pleased to meet you again,
Colonel. I had the honour of making your acquaintance at our Embassy.
I reckon Ambassador Gerard didn’t cotton to our conversation that
night." And the new-comer plumped himself down in the corner opposite
me.</p>

<p>I had been pretty certain I would run across Blenkiron somewhere
in Germany, but I didn’t think it would be so soon. There he sat
staring at me with his full, unseeing eyes, rolling out platitudes
to Stumm, who was nearly bursting in his effort to keep civil.
I looked moody and suspicious, which I took to be the right line.</p>

<p>"Things are getting a bit dead at Salonika," said Mr Blenkiron,
by way of a conversational opening.</p>

<p>Stumm pointed to a notice which warned officers to refrain from
discussing military operations with mixed company in a railway
carriage.</p>

<p>"Sorry," said Blenkiron, "I can’t read that tombstone language
of yours. But I reckon that that notice to trespassers, whatever
it signifies, don’t apply to you and me. I take it this gentleman
is in your party."</p>

<p>I sat and scowled, fixing the American with suspicious eyes.</p>

<p>"He is a Dutchman," said Stumm; "South African Dutch, and he
is not happy, for he doesn’t like to hear English spoken."</p>

<p>"We’ll shake on that," said Blenkiron cordially. "But who said
I spoke English? It’s good American. Cheer up, friend, for it
isn’t the call that makes the big wapiti, as they say out west
in my country. I hate John Bull worse than a poison rattle. The
Colonel can tell you that."</p>

<p>I dare say he could, but at that moment, we slowed down at a
station and Stumm got up to leave. "Good day to you, Herr Blenkiron,"
he cried over his shoulder. "If you consider your comfort, don’t
talk English to strange travellers. They don’t distinguish between
the different brands."</p>

<p>I followed him in a hurry, but was recalled by Blenkiron’s voice.</p>

<p>"Say, friend," he shouted, "you’ve left your grip," and he handed
me my bag from the luggage rack. But he showed no sign of recognition,
and the last I saw of him was sitting sunk in a corner with his
head on his chest as if he were going to sleep. He was a man who
kept up his parts well.</p>

<p>There was a motor-car waiting—one of the grey military kind—and
we started at a terrific pace over bad forest roads. Stumm had
put away his papers in a portfolio, and flung me a few sentences
on the journey.</p>

<p>"I haven’t made up my mind about you, Brandt," he announced.
"You may be a fool or a knave or a good man. If you are a knave,
we will shoot you."</p>

<p>"And if I am a fool?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Send you to the Yser or the Dvina. You will be respectable cannon-fodder."</p>

<p>"You cannot do that unless I consent," I said.</p>

<p>"Can’t we?" he said, smiling wickedly. "Remember you are a citizen
of nowhere. Technically, you are a rebel, and the British, if
you go to them, will hang you, supposing they have any sense.
You are in our power, my friend, to do precisely what we like
with you."</p>

<p>He was silent for a second, and then he said, meditatively:</p>

<p>"But I don’t think you are a fool. You may be a scoundrel. Some
kinds of scoundrel are useful enough. Other kinds are strung up
with a rope. Of that we shall know more soon."</p>

<p>"And if I am a good man?"</p>

<p>"You will be given a chance to serve Germany, the proudest privilege
a mortal man can have." The strange man said this with a ringing
sincerity in his voice that impressed me.</p>

<p>The car swung out from the trees into a park lined with saplings,
and in the twilight I saw before me a biggish house like an overgrown
Swiss chalet. There was a kind of archway, with a sham portcullis,
and a terrace with battlements which looked as if they were made
of stucco. We drew up at a Gothic front door, where a thin middle-aged
man in a shooting-jacket was waiting.</p>

<p>As we moved into the lighted hall I got a good look at our host.
He was very lean and brown, with the stoop in the shoulder that
one gets from being constantly on horseback. He had untidy grizzled
hair and a ragged beard, and a pair of pleasant, short-sighted
brown eyes.</p>

<p>"Welcome, my Colonel," he said. "Is this the friend you spoke
of?"</p>

<p>"This is the Dutchman," said Stumm. "His name is Brandt. Brandt,
you see before you Herr Gaudian."</p>

<p>I knew the name, of course; there weren’t many in my profession
that didn’t. He was one of the biggest railway engineers in the
world, the man who had built the Baghdad and Syrian railways,
and the new lines in German East. I suppose he was about the greatest
living authority on tropical construction. He knew the East and
he knew Africa; clearly I had been brought down for him to put
me through my paces.</p>

<p>A blonde maidservant took me to my room, which had a bare polished
floor, a stove, and windows that, unlike most of the German kind
I had sampled, seemed made to open. When I had washed I descended
to the hall, which was hung round with trophies of travel, like
Dervish jibbahs and Masai shields and one or two good buffalo
heads. Presently a bell was rung. Stumm appeared with his host,
and we went in to supper.</p>

<p>I was jolly hungry and would have made a good meal if I hadn’t
constantly had to keep jogging my wits. The other two talked in
German, and when a question was put to me Stumm translated. The
first thing I had to do was to pretend I didn’t know German and
look listlessly round the room while they were talking. The second
was to miss not a word, for there lay my chance. The third was
to be ready to answer questions at any moment, and to show in
the answering that I had not followed the previous conversation.
Likewise, I must not prove myself a fool in these answers, for
I had to convince them that I was useful. It took some doing,
and I felt like a witness in the box under a stiff cross-examination,
or a man trying to play three games of chess at once.</p>

<p>I heard Stumm telling Gaudian the gist of my plan. The engineer
shook his head.</p>

<p>"Too late," he said. "It should have been done at the beginning.
We neglected Africa. You know the reason why."</p>

<p>Stumm laughed. "The von Einem! Perhaps, but her charm works well
enough."</p>

<p>Gaudian glanced towards me while I was busy with an orange salad.
"I have much to tell you of that. But it can wait. Your friend
is right in one thing. Uganda is a vital spot for the English,
and a blow there will make their whole fabric shiver. But how
can we strike? They have still the coast, and our supplies grow
daily smaller."</p>

<p>"We can send no reinforcements, but have we used all the local
resources? That is what I cannot satisfy myself about. Zimmerman
says we have, but Tressler thinks differently, and now we have
this fellow coming out of the void with a story which confirms
my doubt. He seems to know his job. You try him."</p>

<p>Thereupon Gaudian set about questioning me, and his questions
were very thorough. I knew just enough and no more to get through,
but I think I came out with credit. You see I have a capacious
memory, and in my time I had met scores of hunters and pioneers
and listened to their yarns, so I could pretend to knowledge of
a place even when I hadn’t been there. Besides, I had once been
on the point of undertaking a job up Tanganyika way, and I had
got up that country-side pretty accurately.</p>

<p>"You say that with our help you can make trouble for the British
on the three borders?" Gaudian asked at length.</p>

<p>"I can spread the fire if some one else will kindle it," I said.</p>

<p>"But there are thousands of tribes with no affinities."</p>

<p>"They are all African. You can bear me out. All African peoples
are alike in one thing—they can go mad, and the madness of one
infects the others. The English know this well enough."</p>

<p>"Where would you start the fire?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Where the fuel is dryest. Up in the North among the Mussulman
peoples. But there you must help me. I know nothing about Islam,
and I gather that you do."</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because of what you have done already," I answered.</p>

<p>Stumm had translated all this time, and had given the sense of
my words very fairly. But with my last answer he took liberties.
What he gave was: "Because the Dutchman thinks that we have some
big card in dealing with the Moslem world." Then, lowering his
voice and raising his eyebrows, he said some word like "Ühnmantl".</p>

<p>The other looked with a quick glance of apprehension at me. "We
had better continue our talk in private, Herr Colonel," he said.
"If Herr Brandt will forgive us, we will leave him for a little
to entertain himself." He pushed the cigar-box towards me and
the two got up and left the room.</p>

<p>I pulled my chair up to the stove, and would have liked to drop
off to sleep. The tension of the talk at supper had made me very
tired. I was accepted by these men for exactly what I professed
to be. Stumm might suspect me of being a rascal, but it was a
Dutch rascal. But all the same I was skating on thin ice. I could
not sink myself utterly in the part, for if I did I would get
no good out of being there. I had to keep my wits going all the
time, and join the appearance and manners of a backveld Boer with
the mentality of a British intelligence-officer. Any moment the
two parts might clash and I would be faced with the most alert
and deadly suspicion.</p>

<p>There would be no mercy from Stumm. That large man was beginning
to fascinate me, even though I hated him. Gaudian was clearly
a good fellow, a white man and a gentleman. I could have worked
with him for he belonged to my own totem. But the other was an
incarnation of all that makes Germany detested, and yet he wasn’t
altogether the ordinary German, and I couldn’t help admiring him.
I noticed he neither smoked nor drank. His grossness was apparently
not in the way of fleshly appetites. Cruelty, from all I had heard
of him in German South West, was his hobby; but there were other
things in him, some of them good, and he had that kind of crazy
patriotism which becomes a religion. I wondered why he had not
some high command in the field, for he had had the name of a good
soldier. But probably he was a big man in his own line, whatever
it was, for the Under-Secretary fellow had talked small in his
presence, and so great a man as Gaudian clearly respected him.
There must be no lack of brains inside that funny pyramidal head.</p>

<p>As I sat beside the stove I was casting back to think if I had
got the slightest clue to my real job. There seemed to be nothing
so far. Stumm had talked of a von Einem woman who was interested
in his department, perhaps the same woman as the Hilda he had
mentioned the day before to the Under-Secretary. There was not
much in that. She was probably some minister’s or ambassador’s
wife who had a finger in high politics. If I could have caught
the word Stumm had whispered to Gaudian which made him start and
look askance at me! But I had only heard a gurgle of something
like "Ühnmantl", which wasn’t any German word that I knew.</p>

<p>The heat put me into a half-doze and I began dreamily to wonder
what other people were doing. Where had Blenkiron been posting
to in that train, and what was he up to at this moment? He had
been hobnobbing with ambassadors and swells—I wondered if he had
found out anything. What was Peter doing? I fervently hoped he
was behaving himself, for I doubted if Peter had really tumbled
to the delicacy of our job. Where was Sandy, too? As like as not
bucketing in the hold of some Greek coaster in the Aegean. Then
I thought of my battalion somewhere on the line between Hulluch
and La Bassee, hammering at the Boche, while I was five hundred
miles or so inside the Boche frontier.</p>

<p>It was a comic reflection, so comic that it woke me up. After
trying in vain to find a way of stoking that stove, for it was
a cold night, I got up and walked about the room. There were portraits
of two decent old fellows, probably Gaudian’s parents. There were
enlarged photographs, too, of engineering works, and a good picture
of Bismarck. And close to the stove there was a case of maps mounted
on rollers.</p>

<p>I pulled out one at random. It was a geological map of Germany,
and with some trouble I found out where I was. I was an enormous
distance from my goal and moreover I was clean off the road to
the East. To go there I must first go to Bavaria and then into
Austria. I noticed the Danube flowing eastwards and remembered
that that was one way to Constantinople.</p>

<p>Then I tried another map. This one covered a big area, all Europe
from the Rhine and as far east as Persia. I guessed that it was
meant to show the Baghdad railway and the through routes from
Germany to Mesopotamia. There were markings on it; and, as I looked
closer, I saw that there were dates scribbled in blue pencil,
as if to denote the stages of a journey. The dates began in Europe,
and continued right on into Asia Minor and then south to Syria.</p>

<p>For a moment my heart jumped, for I thought I had fallen by accident
on the clue I wanted. But I never got that map examined. I heard
footsteps in the corridor, and very gently I let the map roll
up and turned away. When the door opened I was bending over the
stove trying to get a light for my pipe.</p>

<p>It was Gaudian, to bid me join him and Stumm in his study.</p>

<p>On our way there he put a kindly hand on my shoulder. I think
he thought I was bullied by Stumm and wanted to tell me that he
was my friend, and he had no other language than a pat on the
back.</p>

<p>The soldier was in his old position with his elbows on the mantelpiece
and his formidable great jaw stuck out.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," he said. "Herr Gaudian and I are inclined to
make use of you. You may be a charlatan, in which case you will
be in the devil of a mess and have yourself to thank for it. If
you are a rogue you will have little scope for roguery. We will
see to that. If you are a fool, you will yourself suffer for it.
But if you are a good man, you will have a fair chance, and if
you succeed we will not forget it. Tomorrow I go home and you
will come with me and get your orders."</p>

<p>I made shift to stand at attention and salute.</p>

<p>Gaudian spoke in a pleasant voice, as if he wanted to atone for
Stumm’s imperiousness. "We are men who love our Fatherland, Herr
Brandt," he said. "You are not of that Fatherland, but at least
you hate its enemies. Therefore we are allies, and trust each
other like allies. Our victory is ordained by God, and we are
none of us more than His instruments."</p>

<p>Stumm translated in a sentence, and his voice was quite solemn.
He held up his right hand and so did Gaudian, like a man taking
an oath or a parson blessing his congregation.</p>

<p>Then I realized something of the might of Germany. She produced
good and bad, cads and gentlemen, but she could put a bit of the
fanatic into them all.</p>
