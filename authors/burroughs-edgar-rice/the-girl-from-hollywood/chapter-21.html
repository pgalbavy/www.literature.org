<p>On the following Monday a pock-marked Mexican appeared at the county
jail in Los Angeles, during visitors’ hours, and asked to be permitted
to see Slick Allen. The two stood in a corner and conversed in
whispers. Allen’s face wore an ugly scowl when his visitor told him of
young Pennington’s interference with their plans.
</p>
<p>“It’s getting too hot for us around there,” said Allen. “We got to
move. How much junk you got left?”
</p><p>“About sixty cases of booze. We got rid of nearly three hundred cases
on the coast side, without sending ’em through Evans. There isn’t much
of the other junk left--a couple pounds altogether, at the outside.”
</p><p>“We got to lose the last of the booze,” said Allen; “but we’ll get our
money’s worth out of it. Now you listen, and listen careful, Bartolo.”
</p><p>He proceeded very carefully and explicitly to explain the details of
a plan which brought a grin of sinister amusement to the face of the
Mexican. It was not an entirely new plan, but rather an elaboration and
improvement of one that Allen had conceived some time before in the
event of a contingency similar to that which had now arisen.
</p><p>“And what about the girl?” asked Bartolo. “She should pay well to keep
the Penningtons from knowing.”
</p><p>“Leave her to me,” replied Allen. “I shall not be in jail forever.”
</p><p>During the ensuing days of that late September week, when Shannon and
Custer rode together, there was a certain constraint in their relations
that was new and depressing. The girl was apprehensive of the outcome
of his adventure on the rapidly approaching Friday, while he could not
rid himself of the haunting memory of her solitary and clandestine ride
over the mysterious trail that led into the mountains.
</p><p>It troubled him that she should have kept the thing a secret, and it
troubled him that he should care. What difference could it make to him
where Shannon Burke rode? He asked himself that question a hundred
times; but though he always answered that it could make no difference,
he knew perfectly well that it <u>had</u> made a difference.
</p><p>He often found himself studying her face, as if he would find there
either an answer to his question, or a refutation of the suspicion of
trickery and deceit which had arisen in his mind and would not down.
What a beautiful face it was--not despite its irregular features, but
because of them, and because of the character and individuality they
imparted to her appearance. Custer could not look upon that face and
doubt her.
</p><p>Several times she caught him in the act of scrutinizing her thus,
and she wondered at it, for in the past he had never appeared to be
consciously studying her. She was aware, too, that he was troubled
about something. She wished that she might ask him--that she might
invite his confidence, for she knew the pain of unshared sorrows; but
he gave her no opening. So they rode together, often in silence; and
though their stirrups touched many a time, yet constantly they rode
farther and farther apart, just because chance had brought Custer
Pennington from the office that Saturday afternoon to look out over the
southern hills at the moment when Shannon had ridden down the trail
into the meadow above Jackknife Cañon.
</p><p>At last Friday came. Neither had reverted, since the previous Saturday,
to the subject that was uppermost in the mind of each; but now Shannon
could not refrain from seeking once more to deter Custer from his
project. She had not been able to forget the sinister smile of the
Mexican, or to rid her mind of an intuitive conviction that the man’s
final statement had concealed a hidden threat.
</p><p>They were parting at the fork of the road--she had hesitated until the
last moment.
</p><p>“You still intend to try to catch those men to-night?” she asked.
</p><p>“Yes--why?”
</p><p>“I had hoped you would give it up. I am afraid something may happen.
I--oh, please don’t go, Custer!” She wished that she might add: “For my
sake.”
</p><p>He laughed shortly.
</p><p>“I guess there won’t be any trouble. If there is, I can take care of
myself.”
</p><p>She saw that it was useless to insist further.
</p><p>“Let me know if everything is all right,” she asked. “Light the light
in the big cupola on the house when you get back--I can see it from
my bedroom window--and then I shall know that nothing has happened. I
shall be watching for it.”
</p><p>“All right,” Custer promised, and they parted.
</p><p>He wondered why she should be so perturbed about his plans for the
night. There was something peculiar about that--something that he
couldn’t understand or explain, except in accordance with a single
hypothesis--a hypothesis which he scorned to consider, yet which rode
his thoughts like a veritable <u>Little Old Man of the Sea</u>. Had he known
the truth, it would all have been quite understandable; but how was he
to know that Shannon Burke loved him?
</p><p>When he reached the house, the ranch bookkeeper came to tell him that
the Los Angeles operator had been trying to get him all afternoon.
</p><p>“Somebody in L. A. wants to talk to you on important business,” said
the bookkeeper. “You’re to call back the minute you get here.”
</p><p>Five minutes later he had his connection. An unfamiliar voice asked if
he were the younger Mr. Pennington.
</p><p>“I am,” he replied.
</p><p>“Some one cut your fence last Friday. You like to know who he is?”
</p><p>“What about it? Who are you?”
</p><p>“Never mind who I am. I was with them. They double-crossed me. You want
to catch ’em?”
</p><p>“I want to know who they are, and why they cut my fence, and what the
devil they’re up to back there in the hills.”
</p><p>“You listen to me. You <u>sabe</u> Jackknife Cañon?”
</p><p>“Yes.”
</p><p>“To-night they bring down the load just before dark. They do that
every Friday, and hide the burros until very late. Then they come down
into the valley while every one is asleep. To-night they hide ’em in
Jackknife. They tie ’em there an’ go away. About ten o’clock they come
back. You be there nine o’clock, and you catch ’em when they come back.
<u>Sabe?</u>”
</p><p>“How many of ’em are there?”
</p><p>“Only two. You don’t have to be afraid--they don’t pack no guns. You
take gun an’ you catch ’em all alone.”
</p><p>“But how do I know that you’re not stringing me?”
</p><p>“You listen. They double-cross me. I get even. You no want to catch
’em, I no care--that’s all. Good-by!”
</p><p>Custer turned away from the phone, running his fingers through his hair
in a characteristic gesture signifying perplexity. What should he do?
The message sounded rather fishy, he thought; but it would do no harm
to have a look into Jackknife Cañon around nine o’clock. If he was
being tricked, the worst he could fear was that they had taken this
method of luring him to Jackknife while they brought the loaded burros
down from the hills by some other route. If they had done that, it was
very clever of them; but he would not be fooled a second time.
</p><p>Custer Pennington didn’t care to be laughed at, and so, if he was
going to be hoaxed that night, he had no intention of having a witness
to his idiocy. For that reason he did not take Jake with him, but
rode alone up Sycamore when all the inmates of the castle on the hill
thought him in bed and asleep. It was a clear night. Objects were
plainly discernible at short distances, and when he passed the horse
pasture he saw the dim bulks of the brood mares a hundred yards away. A
coyote voiced its uncanny cry from a near hill. An owl hooted dismally
from a distance; but these sounds, rather than depressing him, had the
opposite effect, for they were of the voices of the nights that he had
known and loved since childhood.
</p><p>When he turned into Jackknife, he reined the Apache in and sat for a
moment listening. From farther up the cañon, out of sight, there came
the shadow of a sound. That would be the tethered burros, he thought,
if the whole thing was not a trick; but he was certain that he heard
the sound of something moving there.
</p><p>He rode on again, but he took the precaution of loosening his gun in
its holster. There was, of course, the bare possibility of a sinister
motive behind the message he had received. As he thought of it now, it
occurred to him that his informant was perhaps a trifle too insistent
in assuring him that it was safe to come up here alone. Well, the man
had put it over cleverly, if that had been his intent.
</p><p>Now Custer saw a dark mass beneath a sycamore. He rode directly toward
it, and in another moment he saw that it represented half a dozen laden
burros tethered to the tree. He moved the Apache close in to examine
them. There was no sign of men about.
</p><p>He examined the packs, leaning over and feeling one. What they
contained he could not guess; but it was not firewood. They evidently
consisted of six wooden boxes to each burro, three on a side.
</p><p>He reined the Apache in behind the burros in the darkness of the tree’s
shade, and there he waited for the coming of the men. He did not like
the look of things at all. What could those boxes contain? There was
no legitimate traffic through or out of those hills that could explain
the weekly trip of this little pack train; and if the men in charge
of it were employed in any illegitimate traffic, they would not be
surrendering to a lone man as meekly as his informant had suggested.
The days of smuggling through the hills from the ocean was over--or at
least Custer had thought it was over; but this thing commenced to look
like a recrudescence of the old-time commerce.
</p><p>As he sat there waiting, he had ample time to think. He speculated upon
the identity and purpose of the mysterious informant who had called
him up from Los Angeles. He speculated again upon the contents of the
packs. He recalled the whisky that Guy had sold him from time to time,
and wondered if the packs might not contain liquor. He had gathered
from Guy that his supply came from Los Angeles, and he had never
given the matter a second thought; but now he recalled the fact, and
concluded that if this was whisky, it was not from the same source as
Guy’s.
</p><p>All the time he kept thinking of Shannon and her mysterious excursion
into the hills. He recalled her anxiety to prevent him from coming up
here to-night, and he tried to find reasonable explanations for it. Of
course, it was the obvious explanation that did not occur to him; but
several did occur that he tried to put from his mind.
</p><p>Then from the mouth of Jackknife he heard the sound of horses’ hoofs.
The Apache pricked up his ears, and Custer leaned forward and laid a
hand upon his nostrils.
</p><p>“Quiet, boy!” he admonished, in a low whisper.
</p><p>The sounds approached slowly, halting occasionally. Presently two
horsemen rode directly past him on the far side of the cañon. They
rode at a brisk trot. Apparently they did not see the pack train, or,
if they saw it, they paid no attention to it. They disappeared in the
darkness, and the sound of their horses’ hoofs ceased. Pennington knew
that they had halted. Who could they be? Certainly not the drivers of
the pack train, else they would have stopped with the burros.
</p><p>He listened intently. Presently he heard horses walking slowly
toward him from up the cañon. The two who had passed were coming
back--stealthily.
</p><p>“I sure have got myself in a pretty trap!” he soliloquized a moment
later, when he heard the movement of mounted men in the cañon below him.
</p><p>He drew his gun and sat waiting. It was not long that he had to wait. A
voice coming from a short distance down the cañon addressed him.
</p><p>“Ride out into the open and hold up your hands!” it said. “We got you
surrounded and covered. If you make a break, we’ll bore you. Come on,
now, step lively--and keep your hands up!”
</p><p>It was the voice of an American.
</p><p>“Who in thunder are you?” demanded Pennington.
</p><p>“I am a United States marshal,” was the quick reply.
</p><p>Pennington laughed. There was something convincing in the very tone
of the man’s voice--possibly because Custer had been expecting to
meet Mexicans. Here was a hoax indeed; but evidently as much on the
newcomers as on himself. They had expected to find a lawbreaker. They
would doubtless be angry when they discovered that they had been duped.
</p><p>Custer rode slowly out from beneath the tree.
</p><p>“Hold up your hands, Mr. Pennington!” snapped the marshal.
</p><p>Custer Pennington was nonplused. They knew who he was, and yet they
demanded that he should hold up his hands like a common criminal.
</p><p>“Hold on there!” he cried. “What’s the joke? If you know who I am, what
do you want me to hold up my hands for? How do I know you’re a marshal?”
</p><p>“You don’t know it; but I know that you’re armed, and that you’re in a
mighty bad hole. I don’t know what you might do, and I ain’t taking no
chances. So stick ’em up, and do it quick. If anybody’s going to get
bored around here it’ll be you, and not none of my men!”
</p><p>“You’re a damned fool,” said Pennington succinctly; but he held his
hands before his shoulders, as he had been directed.
</p><p>Five men rode from the shadows and surrounded him. One of them
dismounted and disarmed him. He lowered his hands and looked about at
them.
</p><p>“Would you mind,” he said, “showing me your authority for this, and
telling me what in hell it’s all about?”
</p><p>One of the men threw back his coat, revealing a silver shield.
</p><p>“That’s my authority,” he said; “that, and the goods we got on you.”
</p><p>“What goods?”
</p><p>“Well, we expect to get ’em when we examine those packs.”
</p><p>“Look here!” said Custer. “You’re all wrong. I have nothing to do with
that pack train or what it’s packing. I came up here to catch the
fellows who have been bringing it down through Ganado every Friday
night, and who cut our fence last week. I don’t know any more about
what’s in those packs than you do--evidently not as much.”
</p><p>“That’s all right, Mr. Pennington. You’ll probably get a chance to tell
all that to a jury. We been laying for you since last spring. We didn’t
know it was you until one of your gang squealed; but we knew that this
stuff was somewhere in the hills above L. A., and we aimed to get it
and you sooner or later.”
</p><p>“Me?”
</p><p>“Well, not you particularly, but whoever was bootlegging it. To tell
you the truth, I’m plumb surprised to find who it is. I thought
all along it was some gang of cheap greasers; but it don’t make no
difference who it is to your Uncle Sam.”
</p><p>“You say some one told you it was I?” asked Custer.
</p><p>“Sure! How else would we know it? It don’t pay to double-cross your
pals, Mr. Pennington.”
</p><p>“What are you going to do with me?” he asked.
</p><p>“We’re going to take you back to L. A. and get you held to the Federal
grand jury.”
</p><p>“To-night?”
</p><p>“We’re going to take you back to-night.”
</p><p>“Can I stop at the house first?”
</p><p>“No. We got a warrant to search the place, and we’re going to leave a
couple of my men here to do it the first thing in the morning. I got
an idea you ain’t the only one around there that knows something about
this business.”
</p><p>As they talked, one of the deputies had taken a case from a pack and
opened it.
</p><p>“Look here!” he called. “It’s it, all right!”
</p><p>“It’s what?” asked Custer.
</p><p>“Oh, pe-ru-na, of course!” replied the deputy facetiously. “What did
you think it was? I hope you never thought it none of that hootch
stolen from a government bonded warehouse in New York!”
</p><p>The others laughed at his joke.
</p><p>“It’s too bad,” said the marshal, not at all unkindly, “for a decent
young fellow like you to get mixed up in a nasty business like this.”
</p><p>“I agree with you,” said Pennington.
</p><p>His mind traveled like lightning, flashing a picture of Shannon Burke
riding out of the hills and across the meadow above Jackknife Cañon;
of her inquiry that very afternoon as to whether he was coming up
here to-night. Had she really wished to dissuade him, or had she only
desired to make sure of his intentions? The light would not shine from
the big cupola to-night. What message would the darkness carry to
Shannon Burke?
