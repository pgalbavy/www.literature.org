<p>Mike Murphy was never more astounded in his life.</p>

<p>"He oughter said good-bye before he took that dive," exclaimed
the youth, who was not the one to stand idle when a companion,
even one whom he did not specially fancy, was in danger. Mike’s
chivalry was roused, and with no thought of the consequences to
himself, he ran to the help of the other lad. His shillaleh was
firmly grasped in his left hand, and held ready for instant use,
for nothing seemed more probable than that the weapon would be
quickly needed.</p>

<p>Mike was sure that if he imitated Hoke, he would be seized in
the same way. He therefore hurried lightly to the opposite side
of the pile, where as silently as he could, he thrust the toe
of his shoe into the crevice between the lower logs, gave a spring,
caught hold of the upper tier, and drew himself upward.</p>

<p>Buzby Biggs, one of the tramps whom we have met, was sitting
on the ground inside the crude cabin and punching his stubby forefinger
into the bowl of his corncob pipe, with a view of tamping the
tobacco and making it ready to light, when the sound of voices
outside caused him to suspend operations. He rose to his feet,
intending to peep through a small opening of which he knew when
he heard the scratching made by Hoke’s shoes as he climbed the
low wall. Angered by the intrusion upon his privacy, he waited
until the head of the lad rose to view, when he proceeded to act
as has been described.</p>

<p>Hoke was too startled to make any outcry or resistance. The violence
of his debut caused him to sprawl forward on his hands and knees
and his hat fell off. He instinctively picked it up and replaced
it on his head.</p>

<p>"What do yer mean by butting into a gentleman’s private residence
without ringing the bell or sending in your card?" demanded Biggs,
who finding himself confronted by only one lad, could feel no
misgiving as to his own safety.</p>

<p>"Gee! I didn’t know <em>you</em> were here," replied Hoke, alarmed
over the strange situation in which he was caught.</p>

<p>"That don’t make no difference," replied the hobo, who seemed
to be trying to work himself into a passion; "yer showed yer ain’t
used to perlite sassiety and I allers makes a feller pay for the
privilege of coming into the castle of the Duke de Sassy."</p>

<p>Poor Hoke was scared almost out of his wits. He began fumbling
in his pockets.</p>

<p>"How much is the charge? I haven’t got more’n two or three dollars
with me."</p>

<p>"In that case, it will take all and that ere watch which I persoom
is tied to t’other end of the chain dangling in front."</p>

<p>"Why that would be robbery!" exclaimed the lad, indignant at
the impending outrage.</p>

<p>"I wouldn’t call it that, younker; rayther it’s the toll yer
hef to pay for crossin’ this bridge. So yer may as well shell
out first as last."</p>

<p>As Hoke stood, his back was against the side of the wooden wall
over which he had just tumbled, with the tramp scowling and malignant,
facing him. Thus, as will be noted, Biggs was on the side of the
structure up which Mike Murphy had climbed so silently that no
one heard him. Hoke in fact began to rally from his panic and
was on the point of shouting for help when he saw the end of Mike’s
buckthorn cane, gripped in his left hand, slide up into view,
instantly followed by the hat and red, freckled countenance of
the Irish youth, who remained motionless for a moment, while he
peered at the curious picture below him.</p>

<p>Before Hoke could utter the glad words on his tongue, Mike shook
his head as a warning for him to hold his peace. The other caught
on and did not look directly at his friend, but straight into
the face of the tousled scamp. Mike was so clearly in his field
of vision that Hoke saw every movement and even the expression
of the face which was never more welcome.</p>

<p>The next instant one knee of Mike rested on the topmost log,
then the foot slid over and he perched firmly on the top with
his shillaleh transferred to his right hand.</p>

<p>The sight of his friend heartened Hoke.</p>

<p>"You can’t have my watch and chain, and I sha’n’t give you a
penny! You have no more right here than I, and you daresen’t lay
a hand on me."</p>

<p>"What’s that? what’s that?" demanded the other, taking a step
forward and thrusting out his ugly visage; "I guess it’s time
I teached you something."</p>

<p>"Aisy there, Misther Biggs; I think it’s mesilf will hev something
to say ’bout this."</p>

<p>The hobo whirled about and confronted the Irish lad, seated on
the top of the wall and grasping his heavy cane.</p>

<p>"Where did <em>yer</em> come from?" growled the tramp, who ought
not to have been frightened by the presence of two sturdy youths.</p>

<p>Mike made the Boy Scout salute.</p>

<p>"From Tipperary, county of Tipperary, Ireland. Would ye be kind
enough to exchange cards wid me?" and he pretended to search in
his pocket for that which he never carried. "Clarence, me noble
friend," added Mike, addressing Hoke Butler, "ye may as well withdraw
from this palatial residence, as me friends used to say when laving
our shanty at home."</p>

<p>Hoke was instant to seize the opportunity thus presented. He
clambered up the logs with the vivacity of a monkey, scooted over
the wall, dropped to the ground and then made off at the highest
bent of his speed. He did not seem to think he was deserting a
friend in extremity and after that friend had been quick to rush
to his relief.</p>

<p>A glance behind told Mike the truth, whereat he was displeased,
though he did not show it by his manner. It was not so bad, however,
as at first appeared. Hoke had run only a little way when the
cowardice of what he was doing halted him as abruptly as he had
started.</p>

<p>And then it was that an inspiration seized him. Questioning the
wisdom of him and Mike bearding, as may be said, the lion in his
den, Hoke made a pretence that help was near. He shouted at the
top of his voice:</p>

<p>"Dr. Spellman! Here we are! Why don’t you hurry up?"</p>

<p>It was pure good fortune that led Hoke thus to appeal to the
only person whom the hobo held in dread, for the youth knew nothing
of what had occurred previously. He was doubtful about calling
upon Uncle Elk, and another Boy Scout did not seem a formidable
enough reinforcement. Scout Master Hall would have served, but
Hoke did not think of him.</p>

<p>Mr. Buzby Biggs heard the shouted words and could not forget
that the physician was the owner of firearms and did not seem
reluctant to use them. Although the two vagrants had been spared,
it was doubtful whether mercy would be shown them again. Despite
his attempt to bluff, the tramp could not repress a tremor in
his voice.</p>

<p>"What’s he calling that ’ere doctor fur?"</p>

<p>"I think he remarked a remark about telling him to hurry up.
Av coorse ye will be glad to meet the docther agin."</p>

<p>"Not by a blamed sight; him and me don’t speak as we pass by."</p>

<p>"He prefers to spake wid his revolver, I belave."</p>

<p>Mike had been instant to read the trick of Hoke, and he helped
all he could. Biggs was in such a fright he could not hide it.
The last person in the world whom he wished to meet was the medical
man. He turned to imitate the action of Hoke Butler.</p>

<p>"Howld on! None of that!" commanded Mike in such a peremptory
voice that Biggs with hands on the logs in front and one foot
raised, checked himself and looked around.</p>

<p>"What do yer want?" he growled; "hain’t I a right to leave my
home when I please?"</p>

<p>"Which is what Jimmy Jones said when the sheriff stopped him
as he was breaking-jail. You don’t want to bump up agin the docther
whin he has that pill box in his hand. See here, Biggs, I’ll let
you go on one condition."</p>

<p>"What’s that?" growled the other.</p>

<p>"Yesterday when ye and t’other scamp was paddling off in the
canoe ye stole, ye made a sudden dive overboord and swum fur shore;
by yer manner I knowed ye wouldn’t run the risk of taking a bath
if ye hadn’t been scared out of what little wits ye had."</p>

<p>"It would have been the same with yer, if yer’d seen what we
did."</p>

<p>"If ye’ll tell me what ye obsarved, ye may lave whin you choose
and I’ll give ye me pledge that Docther Spellman won’t harm ye."</p>

<p>"All right; I’ll tell yer as soon as I git outside this place."</p>

<p>"You can’t wait till then; ye must give me the sacret while ye
are standing there. If ye don’t I won’t interfare wid the docther
working his will."</p>

<p>An expression of dread passed over the repulsive face and the
man actually shivered.</p>

<p>"Wai, whin me and Saxy was going along in the canoe we borrered
wid me paddling, I happened to look down into the clear water
and my eyes rested upon—<em>the devil himself</em>!"</p>

<p>Mike Murphy was taken aback for the moment by this amazing reply.
His first thought was that the hobo was trifling with him, but,
if so, his acting could not have been better. Astounding as was
his declaration the man believed his own words which conveyed
no meaning to the youth.</p>

<p>"Worra now, don’t ye understand it?"</p>

<p>"No; do yer?"</p>

<p>"That clear water sarves like a looking glass. Whin ye looked
down ye obsarved yer own image and I don’t wonder ye took it for
owld Nick."</p>

<p>"But Saxy seed the same as I did," replied the man, impressed
by the not complimentary explanation of the lad who was perched
on top of the log wall.</p>

<p>"It was his picter that he saan and aich of ye luks more like
t’other than he does like himsilf."</p>

<p>Biggs shook his head. This wouldn’t do.</p>

<p>"It wasn’t like a man at all."</p>

<p>"What did it luk like?"</p>

<p>Mike was excited. He felt he was on the eve of clearing up the
mystery which had baffled him and others, though not Uncle Elk,
who would say nothing.</p>

<p>Instead of giving an intelligent reply to the question for a
further bill of particulars, the tramp shuddered as before. There
was a whine in his voice when he spoke:</p>

<p>"Didn’t I answer yer as I agreed? What are yer kicking about?"</p>

<p>"Ye’ve got to do more than that afore I asks the docther not
to p’int his gun this way and pull the trigger."</p>

<p>"Have yer ever seed the devil?"</p>

<p>"Not afore I looked upon yersilf."</p>

<p>"Then how do yer expict me to describe him? He was there right
under the canoe and almost close enough to grab us."</p>

<p>"Did he hev horns and a spiked tail?"</p>

<p>Mike had heard the sound of footsteps behind him on the leaves.
Some one was approaching and he was sure it was Hoke Butler coming
back to his help.</p>

<p>Biggs made no reply to the frivolous question of the youth seated
above him. The taint of superstition in his nature resented such
treatment of a theme which had nothing but terror to him. Mike,
certain that he commanded the situation and was about to learn
that which he yearned to know, felt that he need not haste.</p>

<p>"Ye’ll hev to do better than that, Signor Biggs, but as ye saam
to prefer that the docther should take ye in hand I’ll turn ye
over to him."</p>

<p>And Mike turned to wink at Hoke Butler, but to his dismay, discovered
in the same moment that his friend was not in sight, and the one
who had come up behind him was Saxy Hutt, the other tramp. </p>
