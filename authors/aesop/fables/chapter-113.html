AN ASS climbed up to the roof of a building, and frisking about
there, broke in the tiling.  The owner went up after him and
quickly drove him down, beating him severely with a thick wooden
cudgel.  The Ass said, "Why, I saw the Monkey do this very thing
yesterday, and you all laughed heartily, as if it afforded you
very great amusement."
