<p>Sheridan had decided to conclude his day's work early that afternoon,
and at about two o'clock he left his office with a man of affairs
from foreign parts, who had traveled far for a business conference
with Sheridan and his colleagues. Herr Favre, in spite of his
French name, was a gentleman of Bavaria. It was his first visit
to our country, and Sheridan took pleasure in showing him the
sights of the country's finest city. They got into an open car
at the main entrance of the Sheridan Building, and were driven
first, slowly and momentously, through the wholesale district
and the retail district; then more rapidly they inspected the
packing-houses and the stock-yards; then skirmished over the "park
system" and "boulevards"; and after that whizzed through the "residence
section" on their way to the factories and foundries.</p>

<p>"All cray," observed Herr Favre, smilingly.</p>

<p>"'Cray'?" echoed Sheridan. "I don't know what you mean. 'Cray'?"</p>

<p>"No white," said Herr Favre, with a wave of his hand toward the
long rows of houses on both sides of the street. "No white lace
window-curtains; all cray lace window-curtains."</p>

<p>"Oh. I see!" Sheridan laughed indulgently. "You mean '<em>GRAY.'
</em>No, they ain't, they're white. I never saw any gray ones."</p>

<p>Herr Favre shook his head, much amused. "There are NO white ones," 
he said. "There is no white <em>ANYTHING </em>in your city; no
white window-curtains, no white house, no white peeble!" He pointed
upward. "Smoke!" Then he sniffed the air and clasped his nose
between forefinger and thumb. "Smoke! Smoke ef'rywhere. Smoke
in your insites." He tapped his chest. "Smoke in your lunks!"</p>

<p>"Oh! <em>SMOKE!" </em>Sheridan cried with gusto, drawing in a
deep breath and patently finding it delicious. "You <em>BET </em>we
got smoke!"</p>

<p>"Exbensif!" said Herr Favre. "Ruins foliage; ruins fabrics. Maybe
in summer it iss not so bad, but I wonder your wifes will bear
it."</p>

<p>Sheridan laughed uproariously. "They know it means new spring
hats for 'em!"</p>

<p>"They must need many, too!" said the visitor. "New hats, new
all things, but nothing white. In Munchen we could not do it;
we are a safing peeble."</p>

<p>"Where's that?"</p>

<p>"In Munchen. You say 'Munich.'"</p>

<p>"Well, I never been to Munich, but I took in the Mediterranean
trip, and I tell you, outside o' some right good scenery, all
I saw was mighty dirty and mighty shiftless and mighty run-down
at the heel. Now comin' right down TO it, Mr. Farver, wouldn't
you rather live here in this town than in Munich? I know you got
more enterprise up there than the part of the old country I saw,
and I know <em>YOU'RE </em>a live business man and you're associated
with others like you, but when it comes to <em>LIVIN' </em>in
a place, wouldn't you heap rather be here than over there?"</p>

<p>"For me," said Herr Favre, "no. Here I should not think I was
living. It would be like the miner who goes into the mine to work;
nothing else."</p>

<p>"We got a good many good citizens here from your part o' the
world. <em>THEY </em>like it."</p>

<p>"Oh yes." And Herr Favre laughed deprecatingly. "The first generation,
they bring their Germany with them; then, after that, they are
Americans, like you." He tapped his host's big knee genially.
"You are patriot; so are they."</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon you must be a pretty hot little patriot yourself,
Mr. Farver!" Sheridan exclaimed, gaily. "You certainly stand up
for your own town, if you stick to sayin' you'd rather live there
than you would here. Yes, <em>SIR! </em>You sure are some patriot
to say <em>THAT&mdash;</em>after you've seen our city! It ain't reasonable
in you, but I must say I kind of admire you for it; every man
ought to stick up for his own, even when he sees the other fellow's
got the goods on him. Yet I expect way down deep in your heart,
Mr. Farver, you'd rather live right here than any place else in
the world, if you had your choice. Man alive! this is God's country,
Mr. Farver, and a blind man couldn't help seein' it! You couldn't
stand where you do in a business way and <em>NOT </em>see it.
Soho, boy! Here we are. This is the big works, and I'll show you
something now that'll make your eyes stick out!"</p>

<p>They had arrived at the Pump Works; and for an hour Mr. Favre
was personally conducted and personally instructed by the founder
and president, the buzzing queen bee of those buzzing hives.</p>

<p>"Now I'll take you for a spin in the country," said Sheridan,
when at last they came out to the car again. "We'll take a breezer."
But, with his foot on the step, he paused to hail a neat young
man who came out of the office smiling a greeting. "Hello, young
fellow!" Sheridan said, heartily. "On the job, are you, Jimmie?
Ha! They don't catch you <em>OFF </em>of it very often, I guess,
though I do hear you go automobile-ridin' in the country sometimes
with a mighty fine-lookin' girl settin' up beside you!" He roared
with laughter, clapping his son upon the shoulder. "That's all
right with me&mdash;if it is with <em>HER! </em>So, Jimmie? Well, when
we goin' to move into your new warehouses? Monday?"</p>

<p>"Sunday, if you want to," said Jim.</p>

<p>"No!" cried his father, delighted. "Don't tell me you're goin'
to keep your word about dates! That's no way to do contractin'!
Never heard of a contractor yet didn't want more time."</p>

<p>"They'll be all ready for you on the minute," said Jim. "I'm
going over both of 'em now, with Links and Sherman, from foundation
to roof. I guess they'll pass inspection, too!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, when you get through with that," said his father,
"you go and take your girl out ridin'. By George! you've earned
it! You tell her you stand high with ME!" He stepped into the
car, waving a waggish farewell, and when the wheels were in motion
again, he turned upon his companion a broad face literally shining
with pride. "That's my boy Jimmie!" he said.</p>

<p>"Fine young man, yes," said Herr Favre.</p>

<p>"I got two o' the finest boys," said Sheridan, "I got two o'
the finest boys God ever made, and that's a fact, Mr. Farver!
Jim's the oldest, and I tell you they got to get up the day before
if they expect to catch <em>HIM </em>in bed! My other boy, Roscoe,
he's always to the good, too, but Jim's a wizard. You saw them
two new-process warehouses, just about finished? Well, <em>JIM
</em>built 'em. I'll tell you about that, Mr. Farver." And he
recited this history, describing the new process at length; in
fact, he had such pride in Jim's achievement that he told Herr
Favre all about it more than once.</p>

<p>"Fine young man, yes," repeated the good Munchner, three-quarters
of an hour later. They were many miles out in the open country
by this time.</p>

<p>"He is that!" said Sheridan, adding, as if confidentially: "I
got a fine family, Mr. Farver&mdash;fine chuldern. I got a daughter
now; you take her and put her anywhere you please, and she'll
shine up with <em>ANY </em>of 'em. There's culture and refinement
and society in this town by the car-load, and here lately she's
been gettin' right in the thick of it&mdash;her and my daughter-in-law,
both. I got a mighty fine daughter-in-law, Mr. Farver. I'm goin'
to get you up for a meal with us before you leave town, and you'll
see&mdash;and, well, sir, from all I hear the two of 'em been holdin'
their own with the best. Myself, I and the wife never had time
for much o' that kind o' doin's, but it's all right and good for
the chuldern; and my daughter she's always kind of taken to it.
I'll read you a poem she wrote when I get you up at the house.
She wrote it in school and took the first prize for poetry with
it. I tell you they don't make 'em any smarter'n that girl, Mr.
Farver. Yes, sir; take us all round, we're a pretty happy family;
yes, sir. Roscoe hasn't got any chuldern yet, and I haven't ever
spoke to him and his wife about it&mdash;it's kind of a delicate matter&mdash;but
it's about time the wife and I saw some gran'-chuldern growin'
up around us. I certainly do hanker for about four or five little
curly-headed rascals to take on my knee. Boys, I hope, o' course;
that's only natural. Jim's got his eye on a mighty splendid-lookin'
girl; lives right next door to us. I expect you heard me joshin'
him about it back yonder. She's one of the ole blue-bloods here,
and I guess it was a mighty good stock&mdash;to raise <em>HER! </em>She's
one these girls that stand right up and look at you! And pretty?
She's the prettiest thing you ever saw! Good size, too; good health
and good sense. Jim'll be just right if he gets her. I must say
it tickles ME to think o' the way that boy took ahold o' that
job back yonder. Four months and a half! Yes, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>He expanded this theme once more; and thus he continued to entertain
the stranger throughout the long drive. Darkness had fallen before
they reached the city on their return, and it was after five when
Sheridan allowed Herr Favre to descend at the door of his hotel,
where boys were shrieking extra editions of the evening paper.</p>

<p>"Now, good night, Mr. Farver," said Sheridan, leaning from the
car to shake hands with his guest. "Don't forget I'm goin' to
come around and take you up to &mdash;Go on away, boy!"</p>

<p>A newsboy had thrust himself almost between them, yelling, "Extry!
Secon' Extry. Extry, all about the horrable acci<em>DENT. </em>Extry!"</p>

<p>"Get out!" laughed Sheridan. "Who wants to read about accidents?
Get out!"</p>

<p>The boy moved away philosophically. "Extry! Extry!" he shrilled.
"Three men killed! Extry! Millionaire killed! Two other men killed!
Extry! Extry!"</p>

<p>"Don't forget, Mr. Farver," Sheridan completed his interrupted
farewells. "I'll come by to take you up to our house for dinner.
I'll be here for you about half-past five to-morrow afternoon.
Hope you 'njoyed the drive much as I have. Good night&mdash;good night!"
He leaned back, speaking to the chauffer. "Now you can take me
around to the Central City barber-shop, boy. I want to get a shave
'fore I go up home."</p>

<p>"Extry! Extry!" screamed the newsboys, zig-zagging among the
crowds like bats in the dusk. "Extry! All about the horrable acci<em>DENT!
</em>Extry!" It struck Sheridan that the papers sent out too many
"Extras"; they printed "Extras" for all sorts of petty crimes
and casualties. It was a mistake, he decided, critically. Crying
"Wolf!" too often wouldn't sell the goods; it was bad business.
The papers would "make more in the long run," he was sure, if
they published an "Extra" only when something of real importance
happened.</p>

<p>"Extry! All about the hor'ble AX'nt! Extry!" a boy squawked under
his nose, as he descended from the car.</p>

<p>"Go on away!" said Sheridan, gruffly, though he smiled. He liked
to see the youngsters working so noisily to get on in the world.</p>

<p>But as he crossed the pavement to the brilliant glass doors of
the barber-shop, a second newsboy grasped the arm of the one who
had thus cried his wares.</p>

<p>"Say, Yallern," said this second, hoarse with awe, "'n't chew
know who that IS?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"It's <em>SHERIDAN</em>!"</p>

<p>"Jeest!" cried the first, staring insanely.</p>

<p>At about the same hour, four times a week &mdash;Monday, Wednesday,
Friday, and Saturday &mdash;Sheridan stopped at this shop to be
shaved by the head barber. The barbers were negroes, he was their
great man, and it was their habit to give him a "reception," his
entrance being always the signal for a flurry of jocular hospitality,
followed by general excesses of briskness and gaiety. But it was
not so this evening.</p>

<p>The shop was crowded. Copies of the "Extra" were being read by
men waiting, and by men in the latter stages of treatment. "Extras"
lay upon vacant seats and showed from the pockets of hanging coats.</p>

<p>There was a loud chatter between the practitioners and their
recumbent patients, a vocal charivari which stopped abruptly as
Sheridan opened the door. His name seemed to fizz in the air like
the last sputtering of a firework; the barbers stopped shaving
and clipping; lathered men turned their prostrate heads to stare,
and there was a moment of amazing silence in the shop.</p>

<p>The head barber, nearest the door, stood like a barber in a tableau.
His left hand held stretched between thumb and forefinger an elastic
section of his helpless customer's cheek, while his right hand
hung poised above it, the razor motionless. And then, roused from
trance by the door's closing, he accepted the fact of Sheridan's
presence. The barber remembered that there are no circumstances
in life&mdash;or just after it&mdash;under which a man does not need to
be shaved.</p>

<p>He stepped forward, profoundly grave. "I be through with this
man in the chair one minute, Mist' Sheridan," he said, in a hushed
tone. "Yessuh."  And of a solemn negro youth who stood by, gazing
stupidly, "You goin' <em>RESIGN?" </em>he demanded in a fierce
undertone. "You goin' take Mist' Sheridan's coat?" He sent an
angry look round the shop, and the barbers, taking his meaning,
averted their eyes and fell to work, the murmur of subdued conversation
buzzing from chair to chair.</p>

<p>"You sit down <em>ONE </em>minute, Mist' Sheridan," said the
head barber, gently. "I fix nice chair fo' you to wait in."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Sheridan. "Go on get through with your man."</p>

<p>"Yessuh." And he went quickly back to his chair on tiptoe, followed
by Sheridan's puzzled gaze.</p>

<p>Something had gone wrong in the shop, evidently. Sheridan did
not know what to make of it. Ordinarily he would have shouted
a hilarious demand for the meaning of the mystery, but an inexplicable
silence had been imposed upon him by the hush that fell upon his
entrance and by the odd look every man in the shop had bent upon
him.</p>

<p>Vaguely disquieted, he walked to one of the seats in the rear
of the shop, and looked up and down the two lines of barbers,
catching quickly shifted, furtive glances here and there. He made
this brief survey after wondering if one of the barbers had died
suddenly, that day, or the night before; but there was no vacancy
in either line.</p>

<p>The seat next to his was unoccupied, but some one had left a
copy of the "Extra" there, and, frowning, he picked it up and
glanced at it. The first of the swollen display lines had little
meaning to him:</p>

<p>  Fatally Faulty.  New Process Roof Collapses Hurling Capitalist
to   Death with Inventor.  Seven Escape When Crash Comes.  Death
Claims&mdash;</p>

<p>Thus far had he read when a thin hand fell upon the paper, covering
the print from his eyes; and, looking up, he saw Bibbs standing
before him, pale and gentle, immeasurably compassionate.</p>

<p>"I've come for you, father," said Bibbs. "Here's the boy with
your coat and hat. Put them on and come home."</p>

<p>And even then Sheridan did not understand. So secure was he in
the strength and bigness of everything that was his, he did not
know what calamity had befallen him. But he was frightened.</p>

<p>Without a word, he followed Bibbs heavily out throught the still
shop, but as they reached the pavement he stopped short and, grasping
his son's sleeve with shaking fingers, swung him round so that
they stood face to face.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what&mdash;" His mouth could not do him the service he asked
of it, he was so frightened.</p>

<p>"Extry!" screamed a newsboy straight in his face. "Young North
Side millionaire insuntly killed! Extry!"</p>

<p>"Not &mdash;<em>JIM!" </em>said Sheridan.</p>

<p>Bibbs caught his father's hand in his own.</p>

<p>"And <em>YOU </em>come to tell me that?"</p>

<p>Sheridan did not know what he said. But in those first words
and in the first anguish of the big, stricken face Bibbs understood
the unuttered cry of accusation:</p>

<p>"Why wasn't it you?"</p>
