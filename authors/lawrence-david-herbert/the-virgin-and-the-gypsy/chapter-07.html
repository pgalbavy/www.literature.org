<p>Yvette was rather thrilled by the Eastwoods, as she called them.
The little Jewess had only to wait three months now, for the final
decree.  She had boldly rented a small summer cottage, by the moors
up at Scoresby, not far from the hills.  Now it was dead winter,
and she and the Major lived in comparative isolation, without any
maid-servant.  He had already resigned his commission in the
regular army, and called himself Mr. Eastwood.  In fact, they were
already Mr. and Mrs. Eastwood, to the common world.</p>

<p>The little Jewess was thirty-six, and her two children were both
over twelve years of age.  The husband had agreed that she should
have the custody, as soon as she was married to Eastwood.</p>

<p>So there they were, this queer couple, the tiny, finely-formed
little Jewess with her big, resentful, reproachful eyes, and her
mop of carefully-barbered black, curly hair, an elegant little
thing in her way, and the big, pale-eyed young man, powerful and
wintry, the remnant surely of some old uncanny Danish stock: living
together in a small modern house near the moors and the hills, and
doing their own housework.</p>

<p>It was a funny household.  The cottage was hired furnished, but the
little Jewess had brought along her dearest pieces of furniture.
She had an odd little taste for the rococco, strange curving
cupboards inlaid with mother of pearl, tortoiseshell, ebony, heaven
knows what; strange tall flamboyant chairs, from Italy, with sea-
green brocade: astonishing saints with wind-blown, richly-coloured
carven garments and pink faces: shelves of weird old Saxe and Capo
di Monte figurines: and finally, a strange assortment of
astonishing pictures painted on the back of glass, done, probably
in the early years of the nineteenth century, or in the late
eighteenth.</p>

<p>In this crowded and extraordinary interior she received Yvette,
when the latter made a stolen visit.  A whole system of stoves had
been installed into the cottage, every corner was warm, almost hot.
And there was the tiny rococco figurine of the Jewess herself, in a
perfect little frock, and an apron, putting slices of ham on the
dish, while the great snow-bird of a major, in a white sweater and
grey trousers, cut bread, mixed mustard, prepared coffee, and did
all the rest.  He had even made the dish of jugged hare which
followed the cold meats and caviare.</p>

<p>The silver and the china were really valuable, part of the bride's
trousseau.  The Major drank beer from a silver mug, the little
Jewess and Yvette had champagne in lovely glasses, the Major
brought in coffee.  They talked away.  The little Jewess had a
burning indignation against her first husband.  She was intensely
moral, so moral, that she was a divorc&eacute;e.  The Major too, strange
wintry bird, so powerful, handsome, too, in his way, but pale round
the eyes as if he had no eyelashes, like a bird, he too had a
curious indignation against life, because of the false morality.
That powerful, athletic chest hid a strange, snowy sort of anger.
And his tenderness for the little Jewess was based on his sense of
outraged justice, the abstract morality of the north blowing him,
like a strange wind, into isolation.</p>

<p>As the afternoon drew on, they went to the kitchen, the Major
pushed back his sleeves, showing his powerful athletic white arms,
and carefully, deftly washed the dishes, while the woman wiped.  It
was not for nothing his muscles were trained.  Then he went round
attending to the stoves of the small house, which only needed a
moment or two of care each day.  And after this, he brought out the
small, closed car and drove Yvette home, in the rain, depositing
her at the back gate, a little wicket among the larches, through
which the earthen steps sloped downwards to the house.</p>

<p>She was really amazed by this couple.</p>

<p>&quot;Really, Lucille!&quot; she said.  &quot;I do meet the most extraordinary
people!&quot;  And she gave a detailed description.</p>

<p>&quot;I think they sound rather nice!&quot; said Lucille.  &quot;I like the Major
doing the housework, and looking so frightfully Bond-streety with
it all.  I should think, WHEN THEY'RE MARRIED, it would be rather
fun knowing them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; said Yvette vaguely.  &quot;Yes!  Yes, it would!&quot;</p>

<p>The very strangeness of the connection between the tiny Jewess and
that pale-eyed, athletic young officer made her think again of her
gipsy, who had been utterly absent from her consciousness, but who
now returned with sudden painful force.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it, Lucille,&quot; she asked, &quot;that brings people together?
People like the Eastwoods, for instance? and Daddy and Mamma, so
frightfully unsuitable? - and that gipsy woman who told my fortune,
like a great horse, and the gipsy man, so fine and delicately cut?
What is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose it's sex, whatever that is,&quot; said Lucille.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, what is it?  It's not really anything COMMON, like common
sensuality, you know, Lucille.  It really isn't!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I suppose not,&quot; said Lucille.  &quot;Anyhow I suppose it needn't
be.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because you see, the COMMON fellows, you know, who make a girl
feel LOW: nobody cares much about them.  Nobody feels any
connection with them.  Yet they're supposed to be the sexual sort.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose,&quot; said Lucille, &quot;there's the low sort of sex, and
there's the other sort, that isn't low.  It's frightfully
complicated, really!  I LOATHE common fellows.  And I never feel
anything SEXUAL - &quot; she laid a rather disgusted stress on the word - 
&quot;for fellows who aren't common.  Perhaps I haven't got any sex.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's just it!&quot; said Yvette.  &quot;Perhaps neither of us has.
Perhaps we haven't really GOT any sex, to connect us with men.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How horrible it sounds: CONNECT US WITH MEN!&quot; cried Lucille, with
revulsion.  &quot;Wouldn't you hate to be connected with men that way?
Oh I think it's an awful pity there has to BE sex!  It would be so
much better if we could still be men and women, without that sort
of thing.&quot;</p>

<p>Yvette pondered.  Far in the background was the image of the gipsy
as he had looked round at her, when she had said:  The weather is
so treacherous.  She felt rather like Peter when the cock crew, as
she denied him.  Or rather, she did not deny the gipsy; she didn't
care about his part in the show, anyhow.  It was some hidden part
of herself which she denied: that part which mysteriously and
unconfessedly responded to him.  And it was a strange, lustrous
black cock which crew in mockery of her.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; she said vaguely.  &quot;Yes!  Sex is an awful bore, you know
Lucille.  When you haven't got it, you feel you OUGHT to have it,
somehow.  And when you've got it - or IF you have it - &quot; she lifted
her head and wrinkled her nose disdainfully - &quot;you hate it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh I don't know!&quot; cried Lucille.  &quot;I think I should LIKE to be
awfully in love with a man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You think so!&quot; said Yvette, again wrinkling her nose.  &quot;But if you
were you wouldn't.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How do you know?&quot; asked Lucille.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I don't really,&quot; said Yvette.  &quot;But I think so!  Yes, I
think so!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it's very likely!&quot; said Lucille disgustedly.  &quot;And anyhow one
would be sure to get out of love again, and it would be merely
disgusting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Yvette.  &quot;It's a problem.&quot;  She hummed a little tune.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh hang it all, it's not a problem for us two, yet.  We're neither
of us really in love, and we probably never shall be, so the
problem is settled that way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not so sure!&quot; said Yvette sagely.  &quot;I'm not so sure.  I
believe, one day, I shall fall AWFULLY in love.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Probably you never will,&quot; said Lucille brutally.  &quot;That's what
most old maids are thinking all the time.&quot;</p>

<p>Yvette looked at her sister from pensive but apparently insouciant
eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it?&quot; she said.  &quot;Do you really think so, Lucille?  How
perfectly awful for them, poor things!  Why ever do they CARE?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why do they?&quot; said Lucille.  &quot;Perhaps they don't, really. - 
Probably it's all because people say:  Poor old girl, she couldn't
catch a man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose it is!&quot; said Yvette.  &quot;They get to mind the beastly
things people always do say about old maids.  What a shame!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anyhow we have a good time, and we do have lots of boys who make a
fuss of us,&quot; said Lucille.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; said Yvette.  &quot;Yes!  But I couldn't possibly marry any of
them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Neither could I,&quot; said Lucille.  &quot;But why shouldn't we!  Why
should we bother about marrying, when we have a perfectly good time
with the boys who are awfully good sorts, and you must say, Yvette,
awfully sporting and DECENT to us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, they are!&quot; said Yvette absently.</p>

<p>&quot;I think it's time to think of marrying somebody,&quot; said Lucille,
&quot;when you feel you're NOT having a good time any more.  Then marry,
and just settle down.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite!&quot; said Yvette.</p>

<p>But now, under all her bland, soft amiability, she was annoyed with
Lucille.  Suddenly she wanted to turn her back on Lucille.</p>

<p>Besides, look at the shadows under poor Lucille's eyes, and the
wistfulness in the beautiful eyes themselves.  Oh, if some awfully
nice, kind, protective sort of man would but marry her!  And if the
sporting Lucille would let him!</p>

<p>Yvette did not tell the rector, nor Granny, about the Eastwoods.
It would only have started a lot of talk which she detested.  The
rector wouldn't have minded, for himself, privately.  But he too
knew the necessity of keeping as clear as possible from that
poisonous, many-headed serpent, the tongue of the people.</p>

<p>&quot;But I don't WANT you to come if your father doesn't know,&quot; cried
the little Jewess.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose I'll have to tell him,&quot; said Yvette.  &quot;I'm sure he
doesn't mind, really.  But if he knew, he'd have to, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p>The young officer looked at her with an odd amusement, bird-like
and unemotional, in his keen eyes.  He too was by way of falling in
love with Yvette.  It was her peculiar virgin tenderness, and her
straying, absent-minded detachment from things, which attracted
him.</p>

<p>She was aware of what was happening, and she rather preened
herself.  Eastwood piqued her fancy.  Such a smart young officer,
awfully good class, so calm and amazing with a motor-car, and quite
a champion swimmer, it was intriguing to see him quietly, calmly
washing dishes, smoking his pipe, doing his job so alert and
skilful.  Or, with the same interested care with which he made his
investigation into the mysterious inside of an automobile,
concocting jugged hare in the cottage kitchen.  Then going out in
the icy weather and cleaning his car till it looked like a live
thing, like a cat when she has licked herself.  Then coming in to
talk so unassumingly and responsively, if briefly, with the little
Jewess.  And apparently, never bored.  Sitting at the window with
his pipe, in bad weather, silent for hours, abstracted, musing, yet
with his athletic body alert in its stillness.</p>

<p>Yvette did not flirt with him.  But she DID like him.</p>

<p>&quot;But what about your future?&quot; she asked him.</p>

<p>&quot;What about it?&quot; he said, taking his pipe from his mouth, the
unemotional point of a smile in his bird's eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;A career!  Doesn't every man have to carve out a career? - like
some huge goose with gravy?&quot;  She gazed with odd na&iuml;vet&eacute; into his
eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm perfectly all right today, and I shall be all right tomorrow,&quot;
he said, with a cold, decided look.  &quot;Why shouldn't my future be
continuous todays and tomorrows?&quot;</p>

<p>He looked at her with unmoved searching.</p>

<p>&quot;Quite!&quot; she said.  &quot;I hate jobs, and all that side of life.&quot;  But
she was thinking of the Jewess's money.</p>

<p>To which he did not answer.  His anger was of the soft, snowy sort,
which comfortably muffles the soul.</p>

<p>They had come to the point of talking philosophically together.
The little Jewess looked a bit wan.  She was curiously na&iuml;ve and
not possessive, in her attitude to the man.  Nor was she at all
catty with Yvette.  Only rather wan, and dumb.</p>

<p>Yvette, on a sudden impulse, thought she had better clear herself.</p>

<p>&quot;I think life's AWFULLY difficult,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Life is!&quot; cried the Jewess.</p>

<p>&quot;What's so beastly, is that one is supposed to FALL IN LOVE, and
get married!&quot; said Yvette, curling up her nose.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you WANT to fall in love and get married?&quot; cried the Jewess,
with great glaring eyes of astounded reproach.</p>

<p>&quot;No, not particularly!&quot; said Yvette.  &quot;Especially as one feels
there's nothing else to do.  It's an awful chickencoop one has to
run into.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you don't know what love is?&quot; cried the Jewess.</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; said Yvette.  &quot;Do you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I!&quot; bawled the tiny Jewess.  &quot;I!  My goodness, don't I!&quot;  She
looked with reflective gloom at Eastwood, who was smoking his pipe,
the dimples of his disconnected amusement showing on his smooth,
scrupulous face.  He had a very fine, smooth skin, which yet did
not suffer from the weather, so that his face looked naked as a
baby's.  But it was not a round face: it was characteristic enough,
and took queer ironical dimples, like a mask which is comic but
frozen.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you mean to say you don't know what love is?&quot; insisted the
Jewess.</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; said Yvette, with insouciant candour.  &quot;I don't believe I do!
Is it awful of me, at my age?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is there never any man that makes you feel quite, quite
different?&quot; said the Jewess, with another big-eyed look at
Eastwood.  He smoked, utterly unimplicated.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think there is,&quot; said Yvette.  &quot;Unless - yes! - unless it is
that gipsy&quot; - she had put her head pensively sideways.</p>

<p>&quot;Which gipsy?&quot; bawled the little Jewess.</p>

<p>&quot;The one who was a Tommy and looked after horses in Major
Eastwood's regiment in the war,&quot; said Yvette coolly.</p>

<p>The little Jewess gazed at Yvette with great eyes of stupor.</p>

<p>&quot;You're not in love with that GIPSY!&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Well!&quot; said Yvette.  &quot;I don't know.  He's the only one that makes
me feel - different!  He really is!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But how?  How?  Has he ever SAID anything to you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!  No!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then how?  What has he done?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, just looked at me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well you see, I don't know.  But different!  Yes, different!
Different, quite different from the way any man ever looked at me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But HOW did he look at you?&quot; insisted the Jewess.</p>

<p>&quot;Why - as if he really, but REALLY, DESIRED me,&quot; said Yvette, her
meditative face looking like the bud of a flower.</p>

<p>&quot;What a vile fellow!  What RIGHT had he to look at you like that?&quot;
cried the indignant Jewess.</p>

<p>&quot;A cat may look at a king,&quot; calmly interposed the Major, and now
his face had the smiles of a cat's face.</p>

<p>&quot;You think he oughtn't to?&quot; asked Yvette, turning to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly not!  A gipsy fellow, with half a dozen dirty women
trailing after him!  Certainly not!&quot; cried the tiny Jewess.</p>

<p>&quot;I wondered!&quot; said Yvette.  &quot;Because it WAS rather wonderful,
really!  And it WAS something quite different in my life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think,&quot; said the Major, taking his pipe from his mouth, &quot;that
desire is the most wonderful thing in life.  Anybody who can really
feel it, is a king, and I envy nobody else!&quot;  He put back his pipe.</p>

<p>The Jewess looked at him stupefied.</p>

<p>&quot;But Charles!&quot; she cried.  &quot;Every common low man in Halifax feels
nothing else!&quot;</p>

<p>He again took his pipe from his mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;That's merely appetite,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>And he put back his pipe.</p>

<p>&quot;You think the gipsy is a real thing?&quot; Yvette asked him.  He lifted
his shoulders.</p>

<p>&quot;It's not for me to say,&quot; he replied.  &quot;If I were you, I should
know, I shouldn't be asking other people.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes - but - &quot; Yvette trailed out.</p>

<p>&quot;Charles!  You're wrong!  How COULD it be a real thing!  As if she
could possibly marry him and go round in a caravan!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't say marry him,&quot; said Charles.</p>

<p>&quot;Or a love affair!  Why it's monstrous!  What would she think of
herself! - That's not love!  That's - that's prostitution!&quot;</p>

<p>Charles smoked for some moments.</p>

<p>&quot;That gipsy was the best man we had, with horses.  Nearly died of
pneumonia.  I thought he WAS dead.  He's a resurrected man to me.
I'm a resurrected man myself, as far as that goes.&quot;  He looked at
Yvette.  &quot;I was buried for twenty hours under snow,&quot; he said.  &quot;And
not much the worse for it, when they dug me out.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a frozen pause in the conversation.</p>

<p>&quot;Life's awful!&quot; said Yvette.</p>

<p>&quot;They dug me out by accident,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! - &quot; Yvette trailed slowly.  &quot;It might be destiny, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>To which he did not answer.</p>
