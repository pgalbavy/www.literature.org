<p><em>TWO</em></p>

<p>Her figure faded into the darkness, as pale things waver down
into deep water, and as soon as she disappeared my sense of humour
returned. The episode appeared more clearly, as a flirtation with
an enigmatic, but decidedly charming, chance travelling companion.
The girl was a riddle, and a riddle once guessed is a very trivial
thing. She, too, would be a very trivial thing when I had found
a solution. It occurred to me that she wished me to regard her
as a symbol, perhaps, of the future&mdash;as a type of those who are
to inherit the earth, in fact. She had been playing the fool with
me, in her insolent modernity. She had wished me to understand
that I was old-fashioned; that the frame of mind of which I and
my fellows were the inheritors was over and done with. We were
to be compulsorily retired; to stand aside superannuated. It was
obvious that she was better equipped for the swiftness of life.
She had a something&mdash;not only quickness of wit, not only ruthless
determination, but a something quite different and quite indefinably
more impressive. Perhaps it was only the confidence of the superseder,
the essential quality that makes for the empire of the Occidental.
But I was not a negro&mdash;not even relatively a Hindoo. I was somebody,
confound it, I was somebody.</p>

<p>As an author, I had been so uniformly unsuccessful, so absolutely
unrecognised, that I had got into the way of regarding myself
as ahead of my time, as a worker for posterity. It was a habit
of mind&mdash;the only revenge that I could take upon despiteful Fate.
This girl came to confound me with the common herd&mdash;she declared
herself to be that very posterity for which I worked.</p>

<p>She was probably a member of some clique that called themselves
Fourth Dimensionists&mdash;just as there had been pre-Raphaelites.
It was a matter of cant allegory. I began to wonder how it was
that I had never heard of them. And how on earth had they come
to hear of me!</p>

<p>"She must have read something of mine," I found myself musing:
"the Jenkins story perhaps. It must have been the Jenkins story;
they gave it a good place in their rotten magazine. She must have
seen that it was the real thing, and...." When one is an author
one looks at things in that way, you know.</p>

<p>By that time I was ready to knock at the door of the great Callan.
I seemed to be jerked into the commonplace medium of a great,
great&mdash;oh, an infinitely great&mdash;novelist's home life. I was led
into a well-lit drawing-room, welcomed by the great man's wife,
gently propelled into a bedroom, made myself tidy, descended and
was introduced into the sanctum, before my eyes had grown accustomed
to the lamp-light. Callan was seated upon his sofa surrounded
by an admiring crowd of very local personages. I forget what they
looked like. I think there was a man whose reddish beard did not
become him and another whose face might have been improved by
the addition of a reddish beard; there was also an extremely moody
dark man and I vaguely recollect a person who lisped.</p>

<p>They did not talk much; indeed there was very little conversation.
What there was Callan supplied. He&mdash;spoke&mdash;very&mdash;slowly&mdash;and&mdash;very
&mdash;authoritatively, like a great actor whose aim is to hold the
stage as long as possible. The raising of his heavy eyelids at
the opening door conveyed the impression of a dark, mental weariness;
and seemed somehow to give additional length to his white nose.
His short, brown beard was getting very grey, I thought. With
his lofty forehead and with his superior, yet propitiatory smile,
I was of course familiar. Indeed one saw them on posters in the
street. The notables did not want to talk. They wanted to be spell-bound&mdash;and
they were. Callan sat there in an appropriate attitude&mdash;the one
in which he was always photographed. One hand supported his head,
the other toyed with his watch-chain. His face was uniformly solemn,
but his eyes were disconcertingly furtive. He cross-questioned
me as to my walk from Canterbury; remarked that the cathedral
was a&mdash;magnificent&mdash;Gothic &mdash;Monument and set me right as
to the lie of the roads. He seemed pleased to find that I remembered
very little of what I ought to have noticed on the way. It gave
him an opportunity for the display of his local erudition.</p>

<p>"<em>A&mdash;</em>remarkable woman&mdash;used&mdash;to&mdash;live&mdash;in&mdash;the&mdash;cottage&mdash;next&mdash;the&mdash;mill&mdash;at
&mdash;Stelling," he said; "she was the original of Kate Wingfield."</p>

<p>"In your 'Boldero?'" the chorus chorussed.</p>

<p>Remembrance of the common at Stelling&mdash;of the glimmering white
faces of the shadowy cottages&mdash;was like a cold waft of mist to
me. I forgot to say "Indeed!"</p>

<p>"She was&mdash;a very&mdash;remarkable&mdash;woman &mdash;She<hr>"</p>

<p>I found myself wondering which was real; the common with its
misty hedges and the blurred moon; or this room with its ranks
of uniformly bound books and its bust of the great man that threw
a portentous shadow upward from its pedestal behind the lamp.</p>

<p>Before I had entirely recovered myself, the notables were departing
to catch the last train. I was left alone with Callan.</p>

<p>He did not trouble to resume his attitude for me, and when he
did speak, spoke faster.</p>

<p>"Interesting man, Mr. Jinks?" he said; "you recognised him?"</p>

<p>"No," I said; "I don't think I ever met him."</p>

<p>Callan looked annoyed.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd got him pretty well. He's Hector Steele. In my
'Blanfield,'" he added.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" I said. I had never been able to read "Blanfield."
"Indeed, ah, yes&mdash;of course."</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause.</p>

<p>"The whiskey will be here in a minute," he said, suddenly. "I
don't have it in when Whatnot's here. He's the Rector, you know;
a great temperance man. When we've had a&mdash;a modest quencher&mdash;we'll
get to business."</p>

<p>"Oh," I said, "your letters really meant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course," he answered. "Oh, here's the whiskey. Well now,
Fox was down here the other night. You know Fox, of course?"</p>

<p>"Didn't he start the rag called&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," Callan answered, hastily, "he's been very successful
in launching papers. Now he's trying his hand with a new one.
He's any amount of backers&mdash;big names, you know. He's to run my
next as a <em>feuilleton</em>. This&mdash;this venture is to be rather
more serious in tone than any that he's done hitherto. You understand?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," I said; "but I don't see where I come in."</p>

<p>Callan took a meditative sip of whiskey, added a little more
water, a little more whiskey, and then found the mixture to his
liking.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, "Fox got a letter here to say that Wilkinson
had died suddenly&mdash;some affection of the heart. Wilkinson was
to have written a series of personal articles on prominent people.
Well, Fox was nonplussed and I put in a word for you."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I'm much&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"Not at all, not at all," Callan interrupted, blandly. "I've
known you and you've known me for a number of years."</p>

<p>A sudden picture danced before my eyes&mdash;the portrait of the Callan
of the old days&mdash;the fawning, shady individual, with the seedy
clothes, the furtive eyes and the obliging manners.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," I said; "but I don't see that that gives me any claim."</p>

<p>Callan cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"The lapse of time," he said in his grand manner, "rivets what
we may call the bands of association."</p>

<p>He paused to inscribe this sentence on the tablets of his memory.
It would be dragged in&mdash;to form a purple patch&mdash;in his new serial.</p>

<p>"You see," he went on, "I've written a good deal of autobiographical
matter and it would verge upon self-advertisement to do more.
You know how much I dislike <em>that</em>. So I showed Fox your
sketch in the <em>Kensington</em>."</p>

<p>"The Jenkins story?" I said. "How did you come to see it?"</p>

<p>"Then send me the <em>Kensington</em>," he answered. There was
a touch of sourness in his tone, and I remembered that the <em>Kensington</em>
I had seen had been ballasted with seven goodly pages by Callan
himself&mdash;seven unreadable packed pages of a serial.</p>

<p>"As I was saying," Callan began again, "you ought to know me
very well, and I suppose you are acquainted with my books. As
for the rest, I will give you what material you want."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Callan," I said, "I've never tried my hand at that
sort of thing."</p>

<p>Callan silenced me with a wave of his hand.</p>

<p>"It struck both Fox and myself that your&mdash;your 'Jenkins' was
just what was wanted," he said; "of course, that was a study of
a kind of broken-down painter. But it was well done."</p>

<p>I bowed my head. Praise from Callan was best acknowledged in
silence.</p>

<p>"You see, what we want, or rather what Fox wants," he explained,
"is a kind of series of studies of celebrities <em>chez eux</em>.
Of course, they are not broken down. But if you can treat them
as you treated Jenkins &mdash;get them in their studies, surrounded
by what in their case stands for the broken lay figures and the
faded serge curtains&mdash;it will be exactly the thing. It will be
a new line, or rather&mdash;what is a great deal better, mind you&mdash;an
old line treated in a slightly, very slightly different way. That's
what the public wants."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," I said, "that's what the public wants. But all the
same, it's been done time out of mind before. Why, I've seen photographs
of you and your arm-chair and your pen-wiper and so on, half a
score of times in the sixpenny magazines."</p>

<p>Callan again indicated bland superiority with a wave of his hand.</p>

<p>"You undervalue yourself," he said.</p>

<p>I murmured&mdash;"Thanks."</p>

<p>"This is to be&mdash;not a mere pandering to curiosity&mdash;but an attempt
to get at the inside of things&mdash;to get the atmosphere, so to speak;
not merely to catalogue furniture."</p>

<p>He was quoting from the prospectus of the new paper, and then
cleared his throat for the utterance of a tremendous truth.</p>

<p>"Photography&mdash;is not &mdash;Art," he remarked.</p>

<p>The fantastic side of our colloquy began to strike me.</p>

<p>"After all," I thought to myself, "why shouldn't that girl have
played at being a denizen of another sphere? She did it ever so
much better than Callan. She did it too well, I suppose."</p>

<p>"The price is very decent," Callan chimed in. "I don't know how
much per thousand, ...but...."</p>

<p>I found myself reckoning, against my will as it were.</p>

<p>"You'll do it, I suppose?" he said.</p>

<p>I thought of my debts ... "Why, yes, I suppose so," I answered.
"But who are the others that I am to provide with atmospheres?"</p>

<p>Callan shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh, all sorts of prominent people&mdash;soldiers, statesmen, Mr.
Churchill, the Foreign Minister, artists, preachers&mdash;all sorts
of people."</p>

<p>"All sorts of glory," occurred to me.</p>

<p>"The paper will stand expenses up to a reasonable figure," Callan
reassured me.</p>

<p>"It'll be a good joke for a time," I said. "I'm infinitely obliged
to you."</p>

<p>He warded off my thanks with both hands.</p>

<p>"I'll just send a wire to Fox to say that you accept," he said,
rising. He seated himself at his desk in the appropriate attitude.
He had an appropriate attitude for every vicissitude of his life.
These he had struck before so many people that even in the small
hours of the morning he was ready for the kodak wielder. Beside
him he had every form of labour-saver; every kind of literary
knick-knack. There were book-holders that swung into positions
suitable to appropriate attitudes; there were piles of little
green boxes with red capital letters of the alphabet upon them,
and big red boxes with black small letters. There was a writing-lamp
that cast an æsthetic glow upon another appropriate attitude&mdash;and
there was one typewriter with note-paper upon it, and another
with <em>MS. </em>paper already in position.</p>

<p>"My God!" I thought&mdash;"to these heights the Muse soars."</p>

<p>As I looked at the gleaming pillars of the typewriters, the image
of my own desk appeared to me; chipped, ink-stained, gloriously
dusty. I thought that when again I lit my battered old tin lamp
I should see ashes and match-ends; a tobacco-jar, an old gnawed
penny penholder, bits of pink blotting-paper, match-boxes, old
letters, and dust everywhere. And I knew that my attitude&mdash;when
I sat at it&mdash;would be inappropriate.</p>

<p>Callan was ticking off the telegram upon his machine. "It will
go in the morning at eight," he said.</p>
