<p>The children had seen the Phoenix-egg hatched in the flames in
their own nursery grate, and had heard from it how the carpet on
their own nursery floor was really the wishing carpet, which would
take them anywhere they chose.  The carpet had transported them to
bed just at the right moment, and the Phoenix had gone to roost on
the cornice supporting the window-curtains of the boys' room.</p>

<p>'Excuse me,' said a gentle voice, and a courteous beak opened, very
kindly and delicately, the right eye of Cyril.  'I hear the slaves
below preparing food.  Awaken!  A word of explanation and
arrangement ...  I do wish you wouldn't - '</p>

<p>The Phoenix stopped speaking and fluttered away crossly to the
cornice-pole; for Cyril had hit out, as boys do when they are
awakened suddenly, and the Phoenix was not used to boys, and his
feelings, if not his wings, were hurt.</p>

<p>'Sorry,' said Cyril, coming awake all in a minute.  'Do come back!
What was it you were saying?  Something about bacon and rations?'</p>

<p>The Phoenix fluttered back to the brass rail at the foot of the
bed.</p>

<p>'I say - you ARE real,' said Cyril.  'How ripping!  And the carpet?'</p>

<p>'The carpet is as real as it ever was,' said the Phoenix, rather
contemptuously; 'but, of course, a carpet's only a carpet, whereas
a Phoenix is superlatively a Phoenix.'</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed,' said Cyril, 'I see it is.  Oh, what luck!  Wake up,
Bobs!  There's jolly well something to wake up for today.  And it's
Saturday, too.'</p>

<p>'I've been reflecting,' said the Phoenix, 'during the silent
watches of the night, and I could not avoid the conclusion that you
were quite insufficiently astonished at my appearance yesterday. 
The ancients were always VERY surprised.  Did you, by chance,
EXPECT my egg to hatch?'</p>

<p>'Not us,' Cyril said.</p>

<p>'And if we had,' said Anthea, who had come in in her nightie when
she heard the silvery voice of the Phoenix, 'we could never, never
have expected it to hatch anything so splendid as you.'</p>

<p>The bird smiled.  Perhaps you've never seen a bird smile?</p>

<p>'You see,' said Anthea, wrapping herself in the boys' counterpane,
for the morning was chill, 'we've had things happen to us before;'
and she told the story of the Psammead, or sand-fairy.</p>

<p>'Ah yes,' said the Phoenix; 'Psammeads were rare, even in my time. 
I remember I used to be called the Psammead of the Desert.  I was
always having compliments paid me; I can't think why.'</p>

<p>'Can YOU give wishes, then?' asked Jane, who had now come in too.</p>

<p>'Oh, dear me, no,' said the Phoenix, contemptuously, 'at least - but
I hear footsteps approaching.  I hasten to conceal myself.'  And it
did.</p>

<p>I think I said that this day was Saturday.  It was also cook's
birthday, and mother had allowed her and Eliza to go to the Crystal
Palace with a party of friends, so Jane and Anthea of course had to
help to make beds and to wash up the breakfast cups, and little
things like that.  Robert and Cyril intended to spend the morning
in conversation with the Phoenix, but the bird had its own ideas
about this.</p>

<p>'I must have an hour or two's quiet,' it said, 'I really must.  My
nerves will give way unless I can get a little rest.  You must
remember it's two thousand years since I had any conversation - I'm
out of practice, and I must take care of myself.  I've often been
told that mine is a valuable life.'  So it nestled down inside an
old hatbox of father's, which had been brought down from the
box-room some days before, when a helmet was suddenly needed for a
game of tournaments, with its golden head under its golden wing,
and went to sleep.  So then Robert and Cyril moved the table back
and were going to sit on the carpet and wish themselves somewhere
else.  But before they could decide on the place, Cyril said - </p>

<p>'I don't know.  Perhaps it's rather sneakish to begin without the
girls.'</p>

<p>'They'll be all the morning,' said Robert, impatiently.  And then
a thing inside him, which tiresome books sometimes call the 'inward
monitor', said, 'Why don't you help them, then?'</p>

<p>Cyril's 'inward monitor' happened to say the same thing at the same
moment, so the boys went and helped to wash up the tea-cups, and to
dust the drawing-room.  Robert was so interested that he proposed
to clean the front doorsteps - a thing he had never been allowed to
do.  Nor was he allowed to do it on this occasion.  One reason was
that it had already been done by cook.</p>

<p>When all the housework was finished, the girls dressed the happy,
wriggling baby in his blue highwayman coat and three-cornered hat,
and kept him amused while mother changed her dress and got ready to
take him over to granny's.  Mother always went to granny's every
Saturday, and generally some of the children went with her; but
today they were to keep house.  And their hearts were full of
joyous and delightful feelings every time they remembered that the
house they would have to keep had a Phoenix in it, AND a wishing
carpet.</p>

<p>You can always keep the Lamb good and happy for quite a long time
if you play the Noah's Ark game with him.  It is quite simple.  He
just sits on your lap and tells you what animal he is, and then you
say the little poetry piece about whatever animal he chooses to be.</p>

<p>Of course, some of the animals, like the zebra and the tiger,
haven't got any poetry, because they are so difficult to rhyme to. 
The Lamb knows quite well which are the poetry animals.</p>

<p>'I'm a baby bear!' said the Lamb, snugging down; and Anthea began:</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>'I love my little baby bear,<br />
I love his nose and toes and hair;<br />
I like to hold him in my arm,<br />
And keep him VERY safe and warm.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>And when she said 'very', of course there was a real bear's hug.</p>

<p>Then came the eel, and the Lamb was tickled till he wriggled
exactly like a real one:</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>'I love my little baby eel,<br />
He is so squidglety to feel;<br />
He'll be an eel when he is big - <br />
But now he's just - a - tiny SNIG!'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps you didn't know that a snig was a baby eel?  It is, though,
and the Lamb knew it.</p>

<p>'Hedgehog now-!' he said; and Anthea went on:</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>'My baby hedgehog, how I like ye,<br />
Though your back's so prickly-spiky;<br />
Your front is very soft, I've found,<br />
So I must love you front ways round!'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>And then she loved him front ways round, while he squealed with
pleasure.</p>

<p>It is a very baby game, and, of course, the rhymes are only meant
for very, very small people - not for people who are old enough to
read books, so I won't tell you any more of them.</p>

<p>By the time the Lamb had been a baby lion and a baby weazel, and a
baby rabbit and a baby rat, mother was ready; and she and the Lamb,
having been kissed by everybody and hugged as thoroughly as it is
possible to be when you're dressed for out-of-doors, were seen to
the tram by the boys.  When the boys came back, every one looked at
every one else and said - </p>

<p>'Now!'</p>

<p>They locked the front door and they locked the back door, and they
fastened all the windows.  They moved the table and chairs off the
carpet, and Anthea swept it.</p>

<p>'We must show it a LITTLE attention,' she said kindly.  'We'll give
it tea-leaves next time.  Carpets like tea-leaves.'</p>

<p>Then every one put on its out-door things, because as Cyril said,
they didn't know where they might be going, and it makes people
stare if you go out of doors in November in pinafores and without
hats.</p>

<p>Then Robert gently awoke the Phoenix, who yawned and stretched
itself, and allowed Robert to lift it on to the middle of the
carpet, where it instantly went to sleep again with its crested
head tucked under its golden wing as before.  Then every one sat
down on the carpet.</p>

<p>'Where shall we go?' was of course the question, and it was warmly
discussed.  Anthea wanted to go to Japan.  Robert and Cyril voted
for America, and Jane wished to go to the seaside.</p>

<p>'Because there are donkeys there,' said she.</p>

<p>'Not in November, silly,' said Cyril; and the discussion got warmer
and warmer, and still nothing was settled.</p>

<p>'I vote we let the Phoenix decide,' said Robert, at last.  So they
stroked it till it woke.  'We want to go somewhere abroad,' they
said, 'and we can't make up our minds where.'</p>

<p>'Let the carpet make up ITS mind, if it has one,' said the Phoenix.</p>

<p>'Just say you wish to go abroad.'</p>

<p>So they did; and the next moment the world seemed to spin upside
down, and when it was right way up again and they were ungiddy
enough to look about them, they were out of doors.</p>

<p>Out of doors - this is a feeble way to express where they were. 
They were out of - out of the earth, or off it.  In fact, they were
floating steadily, safely, splendidly, in the crisp clear air, with
the pale bright blue of the sky above them, and far down below the
pale bright sun-diamonded waves of the sea.  The carpet had
stiffened itself somehow, so that it was square and firm like a
raft, and it steered itself so beautifully and kept on its way so
flat and fearless that no one was at all afraid of tumbling off. 
In front of them lay land.</p>

<p>'The coast of France,' said the Phoenix, waking up and pointing
with its wing.  'Where do you wish to go?  I should always keep one
wish, of course - for emergencies - otherwise you may get into an
emergency from which you can't emerge at all.'</p>

<p>But the children were far too deeply interested to listen.</p>

<p>'I tell you what,' said Cyril: 'let's let the thing go on and on,
and when we see a place we really want to stop at - why, we'll just
stop.  Isn't this ripping?'</p>

<p>'It's like trains,' said Anthea, as they swept over the low-lying
coast-line and held a steady course above orderly fields and
straight roads bordered with poplar trees - 'like express trains,
only in trains you never can see anything because of grown-ups
wanting the windows shut; and then they breathe on them, and it's
like ground glass, and nobody can see anything, and then they go to
sleep.'</p>

<p>'It's like tobogganing,' said Robert, 'so fast and smooth, only
there's no door-mat to stop short on - it goes on and on.'</p>

<p>'You darling Phoenix,' said Jane, 'it's all your doing.  Oh, look
at that ducky little church and the women with flappy cappy things
on their heads.'</p>

<p>'Don't mention it,' said the Phoenix, with sleepy politeness.</p>

<p>'OH!' said Cyril, summing up all the rapture that was in every
heart.  'Look at it all - look at it - and think of the Kentish Town
Road!'</p>

<p>Every one looked and every one thought.  And the glorious, gliding,
smooth, steady rush went on, and they looked down on strange and
beautiful things, and held their breath and let it go in deep
sighs, and said 'Oh!' and 'Ah!' till it was long past dinner-time.</p>

<p>It was Jane who suddenly said, 'I wish we'd brought that jam tart
and cold mutton with us.  It would have been jolly to have a picnic
in the air.'</p>

<p>The jam tart and cold mutton were, however, far away, sitting
quietly in the larder of the house in Camden Town which the
children were supposed to be keeping.  A mouse was at that moment
tasting the outside of the raspberry jam part of the tart (she had
nibbled a sort of gulf, or bay, through the pastry edge) to see
whether it was the sort of dinner she could ask her little
mouse-husband to sit down to.  She had had a very good dinner
herself.  It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good.</p>

<p>'We'll stop as soon as we see a nice place,' said Anthea.  'I've
got threepence, and you boys have the fourpence each that your
trams didn't cost the other day, so we can buy things to eat.  I
expect the Phoenix can speak French.'</p>

<p>The carpet was sailing along over rocks and rivers and trees and
towns and farms and fields.  It reminded everybody of a certain
time when all of them had had wings, and had flown up to the top of
a church tower, and had had a feast there of chicken and tongue and
new bread and soda-water.  And this again reminded them how hungry
they were.  And just as they were all being reminded of this very
strongly indeed, they saw ahead of them some ruined walls on a
hill, and strong and upright, and really, to look at, as good as
new - a great square tower.</p>

<p>'The top of that's just the exactly same size as the carpet,' said
Jane.  '<span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> think it would be good to go to the top of that, because
then none of the Abby-what's-its-names - I mean natives - would be
able to take the carpet away even if they wanted to.  And some of
us could go out and get things to eat - buy them honestly, I mean,
not take them out of larder windows.'</p>

<p>'I think it would be better if we went - ' Anthea was beginning; but
Jane suddenly clenched her hands.</p>

<p>'I don't see why I should never do anything I want, just because
I'm the youngest.  I wish the carpet would fit itself in at the top
of that tower - so there!'</p>

<p>The carpet made a disconcerting bound, and next moment it was
hovering above the square top of the tower.  Then slowly and
carefully it began to sink under them.  It was like a lift going
down with you at the Army and Navy Stores.</p>

<p>'I don't think we ought to wish things without all agreeing to them
first,' said Robert, huffishly.  'Hullo!  What on earth?'</p>

<p>For unexpectedly and greyly something was coming up all round the
four sides of the carpet.  It was as if a wall were being built by
magic quickness.  It was a foot high - it was two feet high - three,
four, five.  It was shutting out the light - more and more.</p>

<p>Anthea looked up at the sky and the walls that now rose six feet
above them.</p>

<p>'We're dropping into the tower,' she screamed.  'THERE WASN'T ANY TOP 
TO IT.  So the carpet's going to fit itself in at the bottom.'</p>

<p>Robert sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>'We ought to have - Hullo! an owl's nest.'  He put his knee on a
jutting smooth piece of grey stone, and reached his hand into a
deep window slit - broad to the inside of the tower, and narrowing
like a funnel to the outside.</p>

<p>'Look sharp!' cried every one, but Robert did not look sharp
enough.  By the time he had drawn his hand out of the owl's
nest - there were no eggs there - the carpet had sunk eight feet
below him.</p>

<p>'Jump, you silly cuckoo!' cried Cyril, with brotherly anxiety.</p>

<p>But Robert couldn't turn round all in a minute into a jumping
position.  He wriggled and twisted and got on to the broad ledge,
and by the time he was ready to jump the walls of the tower had
risen up thirty feet above the others, who were still sinking with
the carpet, and Robert found himself in the embrasure of a window;
alone, for even the owls were not at home that day.  The wall was
smoothish; there was no climbing up, and as for climbing
down - Robert hid his face in his hands, and squirmed back and back
from the giddy verge, until the back part of him was wedged quite
tight in the narrowest part of the window slit.</p>

<p>He was safe now, of course, but the outside part of his window was
like a frame to a picture of part of the other side of the tower. 
It was very pretty, with moss growing between the stones and little
shiny gems; but between him and it there was the width of the
tower, and nothing in it but empty air.  The situation was
terrible.  Robert saw in a flash that the carpet was likely to
bring them into just the same sort of tight places that they used
to get into with the wishes the Psammead granted them.</p>

<p>And the others - imagine their feelings as the carpet sank slowly
and steadily to the very bottom of the tower, leaving Robert
clinging to the wall.  Robert did not even try to imagine their
feelings - he had quite enough to do with his own; but you can.</p>

<p>As soon as the carpet came to a stop on the ground at the bottom of
the inside of the tower it suddenly lost that raft-like stiffness
which had been such a comfort during the journey from Camden Town
to the topless tower, and spread itself limply over the loose
stones and little earthy mounds at the bottom of the tower, just
exactly like any ordinary carpet.  Also it shrank suddenly, so that
it seemed to draw away from under their feet, and they stepped
quickly off the edges and stood on the firm ground, while the
carpet drew itself in till it was its proper size, and no longer
fitted exactly into the inside of the tower, but left quite a big
space all round it.</p>

<p>Then across the carpet they looked at each other, and then every
chin was tilted up and every eye sought vainly to see where poor
Robert had got to.  Of course, they couldn't see him.</p>

<p>'I wish we hadn't come,' said Jane.</p>

<p>'You always do,' said Cyril, briefly.  'Look here, we can't leave
Robert up there.  I wish the carpet would fetch him down.'</p>

<p>The carpet seemed to awake from a dream and pull itself together. 
It stiffened itself briskly and floated up between the four walls
of the tower.  The children below craned their heads back, and
nearly broke their necks in doing it.  The carpet rose and rose. 
It hung poised darkly above them for an anxious moment or two; then
it dropped down again, threw itself on the uneven floor of the
tower, and as it did so it tumbled Robert out on the uneven floor
of the tower.</p>

<p>'Oh, glory!' said Robert, 'that was a squeak.  You don't know how
I felt.  I say, I've had about enough for a bit.  Let's wish
ourselves at home again and have a go at that jam tart and mutton. 
We can go out again afterwards.'</p>

<p>'Righto!' said every one, for the adventure had shaken the nerves
of all.  So they all got on to the carpet again, and said - </p>

<p>'I wish we were at home.'</p>

<p>And lo and behold, they were no more at home than before.  The
carpet never moved.  The Phoenix had taken the opportunity to go to
sleep.  Anthea woke it up gently.</p>

<p>'Look here,' she said.</p>

<p>'I'm looking,' said the Phoenix.</p>

<p>'We WISHED to be at home, and we're still here,' complained Jane.</p>

<p>'No,' said the Phoenix, looking about it at the high dark walls of
the tower.  'No; I quite see that.'</p>

<p>'But we wished to be at home,' said Cyril.</p>

<p>'No doubt,' said the bird, politely.</p>

<p>'And the carpet hasn't moved an inch,' said Robert.</p>

<p>'No,' said the Phoenix, 'I see it hasn't.'</p>

<p>'But I thought it was a wishing carpet?'</p>

<p>'So it is,' said the Phoenix.</p>

<p>'Then why - ?' asked the children, altogether.</p>

<p>'I did tell you, you know,' said the Phoenix, 'only you are so fond
of listening to the music of your own voices.  It is, indeed, the
most lovely music to each of us, and therefore - '</p>

<p>'You did tell us WHAT?' interrupted an Exasperated.</p>

<p>'Why, that the carpet only gives you three wishes a day and YOU'VE
HAD THEM.'</p>

<p>There was a heartfelt silence.</p>

<p>'Then how are we going to get home?' said Cyril, at last.</p>

<p>'I haven't any idea,' replied the Phoenix, kindly.  'Can I fly out
and get you any little thing?'</p>

<p>'How could you carry the money to pay for it?'</p>

<p>'It isn't necessary.  Birds always take what they want.  It is not
regarded as stealing, except in the case of magpies.'</p>

<p>The children were glad to find they had been right in supposing
this to be the case, on the day when they had wings, and had
enjoyed somebody else's ripe plums.</p>

<p>'Yes; let the Phoenix get us something to eat, anyway,' Robert
urged - ' ('If it will be so kind you mean,' corrected Anthea, in a
whisper); 'if it will be so kind, and we can be thinking while it's
gone.'</p>

<p>So the Phoenix fluttered up through the grey space of the tower and
vanished at the top, and it was not till it had quite gone that
Jane said - </p>

<p>'Suppose it never comes back.'</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant thought, and though Anthea at once said, 'Of
course it will come back; I'm certain it's a bird of its word,' a
further gloom was cast by the idea.  For, curiously enough, there
was no door to the tower, and all the windows were far, far too
high to be reached by the most adventurous climber.  It was cold,
too, and Anthea shivered.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Cyril, 'it's like being at the bottom of a well.'</p>

<p>The children waited in a sad and hungry silence, and got little
stiff necks with holding their little heads back to look up the
inside of the tall grey tower, to see if the Phoenix were coming.</p>

<p>At last it came.  It looked very big as it fluttered down between
the walls, and as it neared them the children saw that its bigness
was caused by a basket of boiled chestnuts which it carried in one
claw.  In the other it held a piece of bread.  And in its beak was
a very large pear.  The pear was juicy, and as good as a very small
drink.  When the meal was over every one felt better, and the
question of how to get home was discussed without any
disagreeableness.  But no one could think of any way out of the
difficulty, or even out of the tower; for the Phoenix, though its
beak and claws had fortunately been strong enough to carry food for
them, was plainly not equal to flying through the air with four
well-nourished children.</p>

<p>'We must stay here, I suppose,' said Robert at last, 'and shout out
every now and then, and some one will hear us and bring ropes and
ladders, and rescue us like out of mines; and they'll get up a
subscription to send us home, like castaways.'</p>

<p>'Yes; but we shan't be home before mother is, and then father'll
take away the carpet and say it's dangerous or something,' said
Cyril.</p>

<p>'I DO wish we hadn't come,' said Jane.</p>

<p>And every one else said 'Shut up,' except Anthea, who suddenly
awoke the Phoenix and said - </p>

<p>'Look here, I believe YOU can help us.  Oh, I do wish you would!'</p>

<p>'I will help you as far as lies in my power,' said the Phoenix, at
once.  'What is it you want now?'</p>

<p>'Why, we want to get home,' said every one.</p>

<p>'Oh,' said the Phoenix.  'Ah, hum!  Yes.  Home, you said? 
Meaning?'</p>

<p>'Where we live - where we slept last night - where the altar is that
your egg was hatched on.'</p>

<p>'Oh, there!' said the Phoenix.  'Well, I'll do my best.'  It
fluttered on to the carpet and walked up and down for a few minutes
in deep thought.  Then it drew itself up proudly.</p>

<p>'I CAN help you,' it said.  'I am almost sure I can help you. 
Unless I am grossly deceived I can help you.  You won't mind my
leaving you for an hour or two?' and without waiting for a reply it
soared up through the dimness of the tower into the brightness
above.</p>

<p>'Now,' said Cyril, firmly, 'it said an hour or two.  But I've read
about captives and people shut up in dungeons and catacombs and
things awaiting release, and I know each moment is an eternity. 
Those people always do something to pass the desperate moments. 
It's no use our trying to tame spiders, because we shan't have
time.'</p>

<p>'I HOPE not,' said Jane, doubtfully.</p>

<p>'But we ought to scratch our names on the stones or something.'</p>

<p>'I say, talking of stones,' said Robert, 'you see that heap of
stones against the wall over in that corner.  Well, I'm certain
there's a hole in the wall there - and I believe it's a door.  Yes,
look here - the stones are round like an arch in the wall; and
here's the hole - it's all black inside.'</p>

<p>He had walked over to the heap as he spoke and climbed up to
it - dislodged the top stone of the heap and uncovered a little dark
space.</p>

<p>Next moment every one was helping to pull down the heap of stones,
and very soon every one threw off its jacket, for it was warm work.</p>

<p>'It IS a door,' said Cyril, wiping his face, 'and not a bad thing
either, if - '</p>

<p>He was going to add 'if anything happens to the Phoenix,' but he
didn't for fear of frightening Jane.  He was not an unkind boy when
he had leisure to think of such things.</p>

<p>The arched hole in the wall grew larger and larger.  It was very,
very black, even compared with the sort of twilight at the bottom
of the tower; it grew larger because the children kept pulling off
the stones and throwing them down into another heap.  The stones
must have been there a very long time, for they were covered with
moss, and some of them were stuck together by it.  So it was fairly
hard work, as Robert pointed out.</p>

<p>When the hole reached to about halfway between the top of the arch
and the tower, Robert and Cyril let themselves down cautiously on
the inside, and lit matches.  How thankful they felt then that they
had a sensible father, who did not forbid them to carry matches, as
some boys' fathers do.  The father of Robert and Cyril only
insisted on the matches being of the kind that strike only on the
box.</p>

<p>'It's not a door, it's a sort of tunnel,' Robert cried to the
girls, after the first match had flared up, flickered, and gone
out.  'Stand off - we'll push some more stones down!'</p>

<p>They did, amid deep excitement.  And now the stone heap was almost
gone - and before them the girls saw the dark archway leading to
unknown things.  All doubts and fears as to getting home were
forgotten in this thrilling moment.  It was like Monte Cristo - it
was like - </p>

<p>'I say,' cried Anthea, suddenly, 'come out!  There's always bad air
in places that have been shut up.  It makes your torches go out,
and then you die.  It's called fire-damp, I believe.  Come out, I
tell you.'</p>

<p>The urgency of her tone actually brought the boys out - and then
every one took up its jacket and fanned the dark arch with it, so
as to make the air fresh inside.  When Anthea thought the air
inside 'must be freshened by now,' Cyril led the way into the arch.</p>

<p>The girls followed, and Robert came last, because Jane refused to
tail the procession lest 'something' should come in after her, and
catch at her from behind.  Cyril advanced cautiously, lighting
match after match, and peerIng before him.</p>

<p>'It's a vaulting roof,' he said, 'and it's all stone - all right,
Panther, don't keep pulling at my jacket!  The air must be all
right because of the matches, silly, and there are - look out - there
are steps down.'</p>

<p>'Oh, don't let's go any farther,' said Jane, in an agony of
reluctance (a very painful thing, by the way, to be in).  'I'm sure
there are snakes, or dens of lions, or something.  Do let's go
back, and come some other time, with candles, and bellows for the
fire-damp.'</p>

<p>'Let me get in front of you, then,' said the stern voice of Robert,
from behind.  'This is exactly the place for buried treasure, and
I'm going on, anyway; you can stay behind if you like.'</p>

<p>And then, of course, Jane consented to go on.</p>

<p>So, very slowly and carefully, the children went down the
steps - there were seventeen of them - and at the bottom of the steps
were more passages branching four ways, and a sort of low arch on
the right-hand side made Cyril wonder what it could be, for it was
too low to be the beginning of another passage.</p>

<p>So he knelt down and lit a match, and stooping very low he peeped
in.</p>

<p>'There's SOMETHING,' he said, and reached out his hand.  It touched
something that felt more like a damp bag of marbles than anything
else that Cyril had ever touched.</p>

<p>'I believe it IS a buried treasure,' he cried.</p>

<p>And it was; for even as Anthea cried, 'Oh, hurry up,
Squirrel - fetch it out!' Cyril pulled out a rotting canvas
bag - about as big as the paper ones the greengrocer gives you with
Barcelona nuts in for sixpence.</p>

<p>'There's more of it, a lot more,' he said.</p>

<p>As he pulled the rotten bag gave way, and the gold coins ran and
span and jumped and bumped and chinked and clinked on the floor of
the dark passage.</p>

<p>I wonder what you would say if you suddenly came upon a buried
treasure?  What Cyril said was, 'Oh, bother - I've burnt my
fingers!' and as he spoke he dropped the match.  'AND IT WAS THE LAST!'
he added.</p>

<p>There was a moment of desperate silence.  Then Jane began to cry.</p>

<p>'Don't,' said Anthea, 'don't, Pussy - you'll exhaust the air if you
cry.  We can get out all right.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Jane, through her sobs, 'and find the Phoenix has come
back and gone away again - because it thought we'd gone home some
other way, and - Oh, I WISH we hadn't come.'</p>

<p>Every one stood quite still - only Anthea cuddled Jane up to her and
tried to wipe her eyes in the dark.</p>

<p>'D-DON'T,' said Jane; 'that's my EAR - I'm not crying with my ears.'</p>

<p>'Come, let's get on out,' said Robert; but that was not so easy,
for no one could remember exactly which way they had come.  It is
very difficult to remember things in the dark, unless you have
matches with you, and then of course it is quite different, even if
you don't strike one.</p>

<p>Every one had come to agree with Jane's constant wish - and despair
was making the darkness blacker than ever, when quite suddenly the
floor seemed to tip up - and a strong sensation of being in a
whirling lift came upon every one.  All eyes were closed - one's
eyes always are in the dark, don't you think?  When the whirling
feeling stopped, Cyril said 'Earthquakes!' and they all opened
their eyes.</p>

<p>They were in their own dingy breakfast-room at home, and oh, how
light and bright and safe and pleasant and altogether delightful it
seemed after that dark underground tunnel!  The carpet lay on the
floor, looking as calm as though it had never been for an excursion
in its life.  On the mantelpiece stood the Phoenix, waiting with an
air of modest yet sterling worth for the thanks of the children.</p>

<p>'But how DID you do it?' they asked, when every one had thanked the
Phoenix again and again.</p>

<p>'Oh, I just went and got a wish from your friend the Psammead.'</p>

<p>'But how DID you know where to find it?'</p>

<p>'I found that out from the carpet; these wishing creatures always
know all about each other - they're so clannish; like the Scots, you
know - all related.'</p>

<p>'But, the carpet can't talk, can it?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Then how - '</p>

<p>'How did I get the Psammead's address?  I tell you I got it from
the carpet.'</p>

<p>'DID it speak then?'</p>

<p>'No,' said the Phoenix, thoughtfully, 'it didn't speak, but I
gathered my information from something in its manner.  I was always
a singularly observant bird.'</p>

<p>it was not till after the cold mutton and the jam tart, as well as
the tea and bread-and-butter, that any one found time to regret the
golden treasure which had been left scattered on the floor of the
underground passage, and which, indeed, no one had thought of till
now, since the moment when Cyril burnt his fingers at the flame of
the last match.</p>

<p>'What owls and goats we were!' said Robert.  'Look how we've always
wanted treasure - and now - '</p>

<p>'Never mind,' said Anthea, trying as usual to make the best of it. 
'We'll go back again and get it all, and then we'll give everybody
presents.'</p>

<p>More than a quarter of an hour passed most agreeably in arranging
what presents should be given to whom, and, when the claims of
generosity had been satisfied, the talk ran for fifty minutes on
what they would buy for themselves.</p>

<p>It was Cyril who broke in on Robert's almost too technical account
of the motor-car on which he meant to go to and from school - </p>

<p>'There!' he said.  'Dry up.  It's no good.  We can't ever go back. 
We don't know where it is.'</p>

<p>'Don't YOU know?' Jane asked the Phoenix, wistfully.</p>

<p>'Not in the least,' the Phoenix replied, in a tone of amiable
regret.</p>

<p>'Then we've lost the treasure,' said Cyril.  And they had.</p>

<p>'But we've got the carpet and the Phoenix,' said Anthea.</p>

<p>'Excuse me,' said the bird, with an air of wounded dignity, 'I do
SO HATE to seem to interfere, but surely you MUST mean the Phoenix
and the carpet?'</p>
