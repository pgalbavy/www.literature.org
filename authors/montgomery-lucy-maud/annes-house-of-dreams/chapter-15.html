<P>
At first Anne and Gilbert talked of going home to
Avonlea for Christmas; but eventually they decided to
stay in Four Winds.  "I want to spend the first
Christmas of our life together in our own home,"
decreed Anne.
<P>
So it fell out that Marilla and Mrs. Rachel Lynde and
the twins came to Four Winds for Christmas.  Marilla
had the face of a woman who had circumnavigated the
globe.  She had never been sixty miles away from home
before; and she had never eaten a Christmas dinner
anywhere save at Green Gables.
<P>
Mrs. Rachel had made and brought with her an enormous
plum pudding.  Nothing could have convinced Mrs. Rachel
that a college graduate of the younger generation could
make a Christmas plum pudding properly; but she
bestowed approval on Anne's house.
<P>
"Anne's a good housekeeper," she said to Marilla in
the spare room the night of their arrival.  "I've
looked into her bread box and her scrap pail.  I always
judge a housekeeper by those, that's what.  There's
nothing in the pail that shouldn't have been thrown
away, and no stale pieces in the bread box.  Of course,
she was trained up with you--but, then, she went to
college afterwards.  I notice she's got my tobacco
stripe quilt on the bed here, and that big round
braided mat of yours before her living-room fire.  It
makes me feel right at home."
<P>
Anne's first Christmas in her own house was as
delightful as she could have wished.  The day was fine
and bright; the first skim of snow had fallen on
Christmas Eve and made the world beautiful; the harbor
was still open and glittering.
<P>
Captain Jim and Miss Cornelia came to dinner.  Leslie
and Dick had been invited, but Leslie made excuse; they
always went to her Uncle Isaac West's for Christmas,
she said.
<P>
"She'd rather have it so," Miss Cornelia told Anne. 
"She can't bear taking Dick where there are strangers. 
Christmas is always a hard time for Leslie.  She and
her father used to make a lot of it."
<P>
Miss Cornelia and Mrs. Rachel did not take a very
violent fancy to each other.  "Two suns hold not their
courses in one sphere."  But they did not clash at
all, for Mrs. Rachel was in the kitchen helping Anne
and Marilla with the dinner, and it fell to Gilbert to
entertain Captain Jim and Miss Cornelia,--or rather to
be entertained by them, for a dialogue between those
two old friends and antagonists was assuredly never
dull.
<P>
"It's many a year since there was a Christmas dinner
here, Mistress Blythe," said Captain Jim.  "Miss
Russell always went to her friends in town for
Christmas.  But I was here to the first Christmas
dinner that was ever eaten in this house--and the
schoolmaster's bride cooked it.  That was sixty years
ago today, Mistress Blythe--and a day very like
this--just enough snow to make the hills white, and the
harbor as blue as June.  I was only a lad, and I'd
never been invited out to dinner before, and I was too
shy to eat enough.  I've got all over THAT."
<P>
"Most men do," said Miss Cornelia, sewing furiously. 
Miss Cornelia was not going to sit with idle hands,
even on Christmas.
<P>
Babies come without any consideration for holidays, and
there was one expected in a poverty-stricken household
at Glen St. Mary.  Miss Cornelia had sent that
household a substantial dinner for its little swarm,
and so meant to eat her own with a comfortable
conscience.
<P>
"Well, you know, the way to a man's heart is through
his stomach, Cornelia," explained Captain Jim.
<P>
"I believe you--when he HAS a heart," retorted Miss
Cornelia.  "I suppose that's why so many women kill
themselves cooking--just as poor Amelia Baxter did. 
She died last Christmas morning, and she said it was
the first Christmas since she was married that she
didn't have to cook a big, twenty-plate dinner.  It
must have been a real pleasant change for her.  Well,
she's been dead a year, so you'll soon hear of Horace
Baxter taking notice."
<P>
"I heard he was taking notice already," said Captain
Jim, winking at Gilbert.  "Wasn't he up to your place
one Sunday lately, with his funeral blacks on, and a
boiled collar?"
<P>
"No, he wasn't.  And he needn't come neither.  I could
have had him long ago when he was fresh.  I don't want
any second-hand goods, believe ME.  As for Horace
Baxter, he was in financial difficulties a year ago
last summer, and he prayed to the Lord for help; and
when his wife died and he got her life insurance he
said he believed it was the answer to his prayer. 
Wasn't that like a man?"
<P>
"Have you really proof that he said that, Cornelia?"
<P>
"I have the Methodist minister's word for it--if you
call THAT proof.  Robert Baxter told me the same thing
too, but I admit THAT isn't evidence.  Robert Baxter
isn't often known to tell the truth."
<P>
"Come, come, Cornelia, I think he generally tells the
truth, but he changes his opinion so often it sometimes
sounds as if he didn't."
<P>
"It sounds like it mighty often, believe ME.  But trust
one man to excuse another.  I have no use for Robert
Baxter.  He turned Methodist just because the
Presbyterian choir happened to be singing `Behold the
bridegroom cometh' for a collection piece when him and
Margaret walked up the aisle the Sunday after they were
married.  Served him right for being late!  He always
insisted the choir did it on purpose to insult him, as
if he was of that much importance.  But that family
always thought they were much bigger potatoes than they
really were.  His brother Eliphalet imagined the devil
was always at his elbow--but _I_ never believed the
devil wasted that much time on him."
<P>
"I--don't--know," said Captain Jim thoughtfully. 
"Eliphalet Baxter lived too much alone--hadn't even a
cat or dog to keep him human.  When a man is alone he's
mighty apt to be with the devil--if he ain't with God. 
He has to choose which company he'll keep, I reckon. 
If the devil always was at Life Baxter's elbow it must
have been because Life liked to have him there."
<P>
"Man-like," said Miss Cornelia, and subsided into
silence over a complicated arrangement of tucks until
Captain Jim deliberately stirred her up again by
remarking in a casual way:
<P>
"I was up to the Methodist church last Sunday
morning."
<P>
"You'd better have been home reading your Bible," was
Miss Cornelia's retort.
<P>
"Come, now, Cornelia, _I_ can't see any harm in going
to the Methodist church when there's no preaching in
your own.  I've been a Presbyterian for seventy-six
years, and it isn't likely my theology will hoist
anchor at this late day."
<P>
"It's setting a bad example," said Miss Cornelia
grimly.
<P>
"Besides," continued wicked Captain Jim, "I wanted to
hear some good singing.  The Methodists have a good
choir; and you can't deny, Cornelia, that the singing
in our church is awful since the split in the choir."
<P>
"What if the singing isn't good?  They're doing their
best, and God sees no difference between the voice of a
crow and the voice of a nightingale."
<P>
"Come, come, Cornelia," said Captain Jim mildly, "I've
a better opinion of the Almighty's ear for music than
THAT."
<P>
"What caused the trouble in our choir?" asked Gilbert,
who was suffering from suppressed laughter.
<P>
"It dates back to the new church, three years ago,"
answered Captain Jim.  "We had a fearful time over the
building of that church--fell out over the question of
a new site.  The two sites wasn't more'n two hundred
yards apart, but you'd have thought they was a thousand
by the bitterness of that fight.  We was split up into
three factions--one wanted the east site and one the
south, and one held to the old.  It was fought out in
bed and at board, and in church and at market.  All
the old scandals of three generations were dragged out
of their graves and aired.  Three matches was broken up
by it.  And the meetings we had to try to settle the
question!  Cornelia, will you ever forget the one when
old Luther Burns got up and made a speech?  HE stated
his opinions forcibly."
<P>
"Call a spade a spade, Captain.  You mean he got
red-mad and raked them all, fore and aft.  They
deserved it too--a pack of incapables.  But what would
you expect of a committee of men?  That building
committee held twenty-seven meetings, and at the end of
the twenty-seventh weren't no nearer having a church
than when they begun--not so near, for a fact, for in
one fit of hurrying things along they'd gone to work
and tore the old church down, so there we were,
without a church, and no place but the hall to worship
in."
<P>
"The Methodists offered us their church, Cornelia."
<P>
"The Glen St. Mary church wouldn't have been built to
this day," went on Miss Cornelia, ignoring Captain
Jim, "if we women hadn't just started in and took
charge.  We said WE meant to have a church, if the men
meant to quarrel till doomsday, and we were tired of
being a laughing-stock for the Methodists.  We held ONE
meeting and elected a committee and canvassed for
subscriptions.  We got them, too.  When any of the men
tried to sass us we told them they'd tried for two
years to build a church and it was our turn now.  We
shut them up close, believe ME, and in six months we
had our church.  Of course, when the men saw we were
determined they stopped fighting and went to work,
man-like, as soon as they saw they had to, or quit
bossing.  Oh, women can't preach or be elders; but they
can build churches and scare up the money for them."
<P>
"The Methodists allow women to preach," said Captain
Jim.
<P>
Miss Cornelia glared at him.
<P>
"I never said the Methodists hadn't common sense,
Captain. What I say is, I doubt if they have much
religion."
<P>
"I suppose you are in favor of votes for women, Miss
Cornelia," said Gilbert.
<P>
"I'm not hankering after the vote, believe ME," said
Miss Cornelia scornfully.  "_I_ know what it is to
clean up after the men.  But some of these days, when
the men realize they've got the world into a mess they
can't get it out of, they'll be glad to give us the
vote, and shoulder their troubles over on us.  That's
THEIR scheme.  Oh, it's well that women are patient,
believe ME!"
<P>
"What about Job?" suggested Captain Jim.
<P>
"Job!  It was such a rare thing to find a patient man
that when one was really discovered they were
determined he shouldn't be forgotten," retorted Miss
Cornelia triumphantly.  "Anyhow, the virtue doesn't go
with the name.  There never was such an impatient man
born as old Job Taylor over harbor."
<P>
"Well, you know, he had a good deal to try him,
Cornelia.  Even you can't defend his wife.  I always
remember what old William MacAllister said of her at
her funeral, `There's nae doot she was a Chreestian
wumman, but she had the de'il's own temper.'"
<P>
"I suppose she WAS trying," admitted Miss Cornelia
reluctantly, "but that didn't justify what Job said
when she died.  He rode home from the graveyard the day
of the funeral with my father.  He never said a word
till they got near home.  Then he heaved a big sigh and
said, `You may not believe it, Stephen, but this is the
happiest day of my life!'  Wasn't that like a man?"
<P>
"I s'pose poor old Mrs. Job did make life kinder uneasy
for him," reflected Captain Jim.
<P>
"Well, there's such a thing as decency, isn't there? 
Even if a man is rejoicing in his heart over his wife
being dead, he needn't proclaim it to the four winds of
heaven.  And happy day or not, Job Taylor wasn't long
in marrying again, you might notice.  His second wife
could manage him.  She made him walk Spanish, believe
me!  The first thing she did was to make him hustle
round and put up a tombstone to the first Mrs.
Job--and she had a place left on it for her own name. 
She said there'd be nobody to make Job put up a
monument to HER."
<P>
"Speaking of Taylors, how is Mrs. Lewis Taylor up at
the Glen, doctor?" asked Captain Jim.
<P>
"She's getting better slowly--but she has to work too
hard," replied Gilbert.
<P>
"Her husband works hard too--raising prize pigs," said
Miss Cornelia.  "He's noted for his beautiful pigs. 
He's a heap prouder of his pigs than of his children. 
But then, to be sure, his pigs are the best pigs
possible, while his children don't amount to much.  He
picked a poor mother for them, and starved her while
she was bearing and rearing them.  His pigs got the
cream and his children got the skim milk.
<P>
"There are times, Cornelia, when I have to agree with
you, though it hurts me," said Captain Jim.  "That's
just exactly the truth about Lewis Taylor.  When I see
those poor, miserable children of his, robbed of all
children ought to have, it p'isens my own bite and sup
for days afterwards."
<P>
Gilbert went out to the kitchen in response to Anne's
beckoning.  Anne shut the door and gave him a connubial
lecture.
<P>
"Gilbert, you and Captain Jim must stop baiting Miss
Cornelia.  Oh, I've been listening to you--and I just
won't allow it."
<P>
`Anne, Miss Cornelia is enjoying herself hugely.  You
know she is.'
<P>
"Well, never mind.  You two needn't egg her on like
that.  Dinner is ready now, and, Gilbert, DON'T let
Mrs. Rachel carve the geese.  I know she means to offer
to do it because she doesn't think you can do it
properly.  Show her you can."
<P>
"I ought to be able to.  I've been studying A-B-C-D
diagrams of carving for the past month," said Gilbert. 
"Only don't talk to me while I'm doing it, Anne, for if
you drive the letters out of my head I'll be in a worse
predicament than you were in old geometry days when
the teacher changed them."
<P>
Gilbert carved the geese beautifully.  Even Mrs. Rachel
had to admit that.  And everybody ate of them and
enjoyed them.  Anne's first Christmas dinner was a
great success and she beamed with housewifely pride. 
Merry was the feast and long; and when it was over they
gathered around the cheer of the red hearth flame and
Captain Jim told them stories until the red sun swung
low over Four Winds Harbor, and the long blue shadows
of the Lombardies fell across the snow in the lane.
<P>
"I must be getting back to the light," he said
finally.  "I'll jest have time to walk home before
sundown.  Thank you for a beautiful Christmas, Mistress
Blythe.  Bring Master Davy down to the light some
night before he goes home.
<P>
"I want to see those stone gods," said Davy with a
relish.
