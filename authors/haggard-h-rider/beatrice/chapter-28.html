<p>Beatrice drove back to Paddington, and as she drove, though her face did
not change from its marble cast of woe the great tears rolled down it,
one by one.
</p><p>They reached the deserted-looking station, and she paid the man out of
her few remaining shillings--seeing that she was a stranger, he insisted
upon receiving half-a-crown. Then, disregarding the astonished stare
of a night porter, she found her way to the waiting room, and sat down.
First she took the letter from her breast, and added some lines to it
in pencil, but she did not post it yet; she knew that if she did so
it would reach its destination too soon. Then she laid her head back
against the wall, and utterly outworn, dropped to sleep--her last sleep
upon this earth, before the longest sleep of all.
</p><p>And thus Beatrice waited and slept at Paddington, while her lover waited
and watched at Euston.
</p><p>At five she woke, and the heavy cloud of sorrow, past, present, and to
come, rushed in upon her heart. Taking her bag, she made herself as tidy
as she could. Then she stepped outside the station into the deserted
street, and finding a space between the houses, watched the sun rise
over the waking world. It was her last sunrise, Beatrice remembered.
</p><p>She came back filled with such thoughts as might well strike the heart
of a woman about to do the thing she had decreed. The refreshment bar
was open now, and she went to it, and bought a cup of coffee and some
bread and butter. Then she took her ticket, not to Bryngelly or to Coed,
but to the station on this side of Bryngelly, and three miles from it.
She would run less risk of being noticed there. The train was shunted
up; she took her seat in it. Just as it was starting, an early newspaper
boy came along, yawning. Beatrice bought a copy of the <u>Standard</u>, out
of the one and threepence that was left of her money, and opened it at
the sheet containing the leading articles. The first one began, “The
most powerful, closely reasoned, and eloquent speech made last night by
Mr. Bingham, the Member for Pillham, will, we feel certain, produce as
great an effect on the country as it did in the House of Commons. We
welcome it, not only on account of its value as a contribution to the
polemics of the Irish Question, but as a positive proof of what has
already been suspected, that the Unionist party has in Mr. Bingham a
young statesman of a very high order indeed, and one whom remarkable and
rapid success at the Bar has not hampered, as is too often the case, in
the larger and less technical field of politics.”
</p><p>And so on. Beatrice put the paper down with a smile of triumph.
Geoffrey’s success was splendid and unquestioned. Nothing could stop
him now. During all the long journey she pleased her imagination by
conjuring up picture after picture of that great future of his, in which
she would have no share. And yet he would not forget her; she was sure
of this. Her shadow would go with him from year to year, even to the
end, and at times he might think how proud she would have been could she
be present to record his triumphs. Alas! she did not remember that when
all is lost which can make life beautiful, when the sun has set, and
the spirit gone out of the day, the poor garish lights of our little
victories can but ill atone for the glories that have been. Happiness
and content are frail plants which can only flourish under fair
conditions if at all. Certainly they will not thrive beneath the gloom
and shadow of a pall, and when the heart is dead no triumphs, however
splendid, and no rewards, however great, can compensate for an utter and
irredeemable loss. She never guessed, poor girl, that time upon time, in
the decades to be, Geoffrey would gladly have laid his honours down in
payment for one year of her dear and unforgotten presence. She was too
unselfish; she did not think that a man could thus prize a woman’s
love, and took it for an axiom that to succeed in life was his one real
object--a thing to which so divine a gift as she had given Geoffrey is
as nothing. It was therefore this Juggernaut of her lover’s career that
Beatrice would cast down her life, little knowing that thereby she must
turn the worldly and temporal success, which he already held so cheap,
to bitterness and ashes.
</p><p>At Chester Beatrice got out of the train and posted her letter to
Geoffrey. She would not do so till then because it might have reached
him too soon--before all was finished! Now it would be delivered to him
in the House after everything had been accomplished in its order. She
looked at the letter; it was, she thought, the last token that could
ever pass between them on this earth. Once she pressed it to her heart,
once she touched it with her lips, and then put it from her beyond
recall. It was done; there was no going back now. And even as she stood
the postman came up, whistling, and opening the box carelessly swept its
contents into his canvas bag. Could he have known what lay among them he
would have whistled no more that day.
</p><p>Beatrice continued her journey, and by three o’clock arrived safely at
the little station next to Bryngelly. There was a fair at Coed that day,
and many people of the peasant class got in here. Amidst the confusion
she gave up her ticket to a small boy, who was looking the other way at
the time, and escaped without being noticed by a soul. Indeed, things
happened so that nobody in the neighbourhood of Bryngelly ever knew that
Beatrice had been to London and back upon those dreadful days.
</p><p>Beatrice walked along the cliff, and in an hour was at the door of
the Vicarage, from which she seemed to have been away for years. She
unlocked it and entered. In the letter-box was a post-card from her
father stating that he and Elizabeth had changed their plans and would
not be back till the train which arrived at half-past eight on the
following morning. So much the better, she thought. Then she disarranged
the clothes upon her bed to make it seem as though it had been slept it,
lit the kitchen fire, and put the kettle on to boil, and as soon as it
was ready she took some food. She wanted all her nerve, and that could
not be kept up without food.
</p><p>Shortly after this the girl Betty returned, and went about her duties in
the house quite unconscious that Beatrice had been away from it for
the whole night. Her sister was much better, she said, in answer to
Beatrice’s inquiries.
</p><p>When she had eaten what she could--it was not much--Beatrice went to her
room, undressed herself, bathed, and put on clean, fresh things. Then
she unbound her lovely hair, and did it up in a coronet upon her head.
It was a fashion that she did not often adopt, because it took too much
time, but on this day, of all days, she had a strange fancy to look
her best. Also her hair had been done like this on the afternoon when
Geoffrey first met her. Next she put on the grey dress once more which
she had worn on her journey to London, and taking the silver Roman ring
that Geoffrey had given her from the string by which she wore it about
her neck, placed it on the third finger of her left hand.
</p><p>All this being done, Beatrice visited the kitchen and ordered the
supper. She went further in her innocent cunning. Betty asked her what
she would like for breakfast on the following morning, and she told her
to cook some bacon, and to be careful how she cut it, as she did not
like thick bacon. Then, after one long last look at the Vicarage, she
started for the lodging of the head teacher of the school, and, having
found her, inquired as to the day’s work.
</p><p>Further, Beatrice told her assistant that she had determined to alter
the course of certain lessons in the school. The Wednesday arithmetic
class had hitherto been taken before the grammar class. On the morrow
she had determined to change this; she would take the grammar class
at ten and the arithmetic class at eleven, and gave her reasons for so
doing. The teacher assented, and Beatrice shook hands with her and bade
her good-night. She would have wished to say how much she felt indebted
to her for her help in the school, but did not like to do so, fearing
lest, in the light of pending events, the remark might be viewed with
suspicion.
</p><p>Poor Beatrice, these were the only lies she ever told!
</p><p>She left the teacher’s lodgings, and was about to go down to the beach
and sit there till it was time, when she was met by the father of the
crazed child, Jane Llewellyn.
</p><p>“Oh, Miss Beatrice,” he said, “I have been looking for you everywhere.
We are in sad trouble, miss. Poor Jane is in a raving fit, and talking
about hell and that, and the doctor says she’s dying. Can you come,
miss, and see if you can do anything to quiet her? It’s a matter of life
and death, the doctor says, miss.”
</p><p>Beatrice smiled sadly; matters of life and death were in the air. “I
will come,” she said, “but I shall not be able to stay long.”
</p><p>How could she better spend her last hour?
</p><p>She accompanied the man to his cottage. The child, dressed only in a
night-shirt, was raving furiously, and evidently in the last stage of
exhaustion, nor could the doctor or her mother do anything to quiet her.
</p><p>“Don’t you see,” she screamed, pointing to the wall, “there’s the Devil
waiting for me? And, oh, there’s the mouth of hell where the minister
said I should go! Oh, hold me, hold me, hold me!”
</p><p>Beatrice walked up to her, took the thin little hands in hers, and
looked her fixedly in the eyes.
</p><p>“Jane,” she said. “Jane, don’t you know me?”
</p><p>“Yes, Miss Granger,” she said, “I know the lesson; I will say it
presently.”
</p><p>Beatrice took her in her arms, and sat down on the bed. Quieter and
quieter grew the child till suddenly an awful change passed over her
face.
</p><p>“She is dying,” whispered the doctor.
</p><p>“Hold me close, hold me close!” said the child, whose senses returned
before the last eclipse. “Oh, Miss Granger, I shan’t go to hell, shall
I? I am afraid of hell.”
</p><p>“No, love, no; you will go to heaven.”
</p><p>Jane lay still awhile. Then seeing the pale lips move, Beatrice put her
ear to the child’s mouth.
</p><p>“Will you come with me?” she murmured; “I am afraid to go alone.”
</p><p>And Beatrice, her great grey eyes fixed steadily on the closing eyes
beneath, whispered back so that no other soul could hear except the
dying child:
</p><p>“Yes, I will come presently.” But Jane heard and understood.
</p><p>“Promise,” said the child.
</p><p>“Yes, I promise,” answered Beatrice in the same inaudible whisper.
“Sleep, dear, sleep; I will join you very soon.”
</p><p>And the child looked up, shivered, smiled--and slept.
</p><p>Beatrice gave it back to the weeping parents and went her way. “What a
splendid creature,” said the doctor to himself as he looked after her.
“She has eyes like Fate, and the face of Motherhood Incarnate. A great
woman, if ever I saw one, but different from other women.”
</p><p>Meanwhile Beatrice made her way to old Edward’s boat-shed. As she
expected, there was nobody there, and nobody on the beach. Old Edward
and his son were at tea, with the rest of Bryngelly. They would come
back after dark and lock up the boat-house.
</p><p>She looked at the sea. There were no waves, but the breeze freshened
every minute, and there was a long slow swell upon the water. The
rollers would be running beyond the shelter of Rumball Point, five miles
away.
</p><p>The tide was high; it mounted to within ten yards of the end of the
boat-house. She opened the door, and dragged out her canoe, closing
the door again after her. The craft was light, and she was strong for a
woman. Close to the boat-house one of the timber breakwaters, which
are common at sea-side places, ran down into the water. She dragged the
canoe to its side, and then pushed it down the beach till its bow was
afloat. Next, mounting on the breakwater, she caught hold of the little
chain in the bow, and walking along the timber baulks, pulled with all
her force till the canoe was quite afloat. On she went, dragging it
after her, till the waves washing over the breakwater wetted her shoes.
</p><p>Then she brought the canoe quite close, and, watching her opportunity,
stepped into it, nearly falling into the water as she did so. But she
recovered her balance, and sat down. In another minute she was paddling
out to sea with all her strength.
</p><p>For twenty minutes or more she paddled unceasingly. Then she rested
awhile, only keeping the canoe head on to the sea, which, without being
rough, was running more and more freshly. There, some miles away, was
the dark mass of Rumball Point. She must be off it before the night
closed in. There would be sea enough there; no such craft as hers could
live in it for five minutes, and the tide was on the turn. Anything
sinking in those waters would be carried far away, and never come back
to the shore of Wales.
</p><p>She turned her head and looked at Bryngelly, and the long familiar
stretch of cliff. How fair it seemed, bathed in the quiet lights of
summer afternoon. Oh! was there any afternoon where the child had gone,
and where she was following fast?--or was it all night, black, eternal
night, unbroken by the dram of dear remembered things?
</p><p>There were the Dog Rocks, where she had stood on that misty autumn
day, and seen the vision of her coffined mother’s face. Surely it was a
presage of her fate. There beyond was the Bell Rock, where in that same
hour Geoffrey and she had met, and behind it was the Amphitheatre, where
they had told their love. Hark! what was that sound pealing faintly at
intervals across the deep? It was the great ship’s bell that, stirred
from time to time by the wash of the high tide, solemnly tolled her
passing soul.
</p><p>She paddled on; the sound of that death-knell shook her nerves, and made
her feel faint and weak. Oh, it would have been easier had she been as
she was a year ago, before she learned to love, and hand in hand had
seen faith and hope re-arise from the depths of her stirred soul. Then
being but a heathen, she could have met her end with all a heathen’s
strength, knowing what she lost, and believing, too, that she would
find but sleep. And now it was otherwise, for in her heart she did not
believe that she was about utterly to perish. What, could the body live
on in a thousand forms, changed indeed but indestructible and immortal,
while the spiritual part, with all its hopes and loves and fears, melted
into nothingness? It could not be; surely on some new shore she should
once again greet her love. And if it was not, how would they meet her
in that under world, coming self-murdered, her life-blood on her hands?
Would her mother turn away from her? and the little brother, whom she
had loved, would he reject her? And what Voice of Doom might strike her
into everlasting hopelessness?
</p><p>But, be the sin what it might, yet would she sin it for the sake of
Geoffrey; ay, even if she must reap a harvest of eternal woe. She bent
her head and prayed. “Oh, Power, that art above, from whom I come, to
whom I go, have mercy on me! Oh, Spirit, if indeed thy name is Love,
weigh my love in thy balance, and let it lift the scale of sin. Oh, God
of Sacrifice, be not wroth at my deed of sacrifice and give me pardon,
give me life and peace, that in a time to come I may win the sight of
him for whom I die.”
</p><p>A somewhat heathenish prayer indeed, and far too full of human passion
for one about to leave the human shores. But, then--well, it was
Beatrice who prayed--Beatrice, who could realise no heaven beyond the
limits of her passion, who still thought more of her love than of saving
her own soul alive. Perhaps it found a home--perhaps, like her who
prayed it, it was lost upon the pitiless deep.
</p><p>Then Beatrice prayed no more. Short was her time. See, there sank the
sun in glory; and there the great rollers swept along past the sullen
headland, where the undertow met wind and tide. She would think no more
of self; it was, it seemed to her, so small, this mendicant calling on
the Unseen, not for others, but for self: aid for self, well-being for
self, salvation for self--this doing of good that good might come to
self. She had made her prayer, and if she prayed again it should be for
Geoffrey, that he might prosper and be happy--that he might forgive the
trouble her love had brought into his life. That he might forget her she
could not pray. She had prayed her prayer and said her say, and it was
done with. Let her be judged as it seemed good to Those who judge! Now
she would fix her thoughts upon her love, and by its strength would she
triumph over the bitterness of death. Her eyes flashed and her breast
heaved: further out to sea, further yet--she would meet those rollers
a knot or more from the point of the headland, that no record might
remain.
</p><p>Was it her wrong if she loved him? She could not help it, and she was
proud to love him. Even now, she would not undo the past. What were
the lines that Geoffrey had read to her. They haunted her mind with a
strange persistence--they took time to the beat of her falling paddle,
and would not leave her:
</p><pre>
     “Of once sown seed, who knoweth what the crop is?
     Alas, my love, Love’s eyes are very blind!
     What would they have us do? Sunflowers and poppies
     Stoop to the wind----“[*]
     [*] Oliver Madox Brown.</pre>
<p>Yes, yes, Love’s eyes are very blind, but in their blindness there was
more light than in all other earthly things. Oh, she could not live for
him, and with him--it was denied to her--but she still could die for
him, her darling, her darling!
</p>
<p>“Geoffrey, hear me--I die for you; accept my sacrifice, and forget me
not.” So!--she is in the rollers--how solemn they are with their hoary
heads of foam, as one by one they move down upon her.
</p><p>The first! it towers high, but the canoe rides it like a cork. Look! the
day is dying on the distant land, but still his glory shines across the
sea. Presently all will be finished. Here the breeze is strong; it tears
the bonnet from her head, it unwinds the coronet of braided locks,
and her bright hair streams out behind her. Feel how the spray stings,
striking like a whip. No, not this wave, she rides that also; she
will die as she has lived--fighting to the last; and once more, never
faltering, she sets her face towards the rollers and consigns her soul
to doom.
</p><p>Ah! that struck her full. Oh, see! Geoffrey’s ring has slipped from her
wet hand, falling into the bottom of the boat. Can she regain it? she
would die with that ring upon her finger--it is her marriage-ring,
wedding her through death to Geoffrey, upon the altar of the sea. She
stoops! oh, what a shock of water at her breast! What was it--what was
it?--<u>Of once sown seed, who knoweth what the crop is?</u> She must soon
learn now!
</p><p>“Geoffrey! hear me, Geoffrey!--I die, I die for you! I will wait for you
at the foundations of the sea, on the topmost heights of heaven, in the
lowest deeps of hell--wherever I am I will always wait for you!”
</p><p>It sinks--it has sunk--she is alone with God, and the cruel waters.
The sun goes out! Look on that great white wave seething through the
deepening gloom; hear it rushing towards her, big with fate.
</p><p>“Geoffrey, my darling--I will wait----”
</p>
<p>Farewell to Beatrice! The light went out of the sky and darkness
gathered on the weltering sea. Farewell to Beatrice, and all her love
and all her sin.
