<p>And now the curtain is down for a few hours, and the actors in this
novel drama are plunged in dewy sleep. Perhaps we should except
Nyleptha, whom the reader may, if poetically inclined, imagine lying in
her bed of state encompassed by her maidens, tiring women, guards, and
all the other people and appurtenances that surround a throne, and yet
not able to slumber for thinking of the strangers who had visited a
country where no such strangers had ever come before, and wondering, as
she lay awake, who they were and what their past has been, and if she
was ugly compared to the women of their native place. I, however, not
being poetically inclined, will take advantage of the lull to give some
account of the people among whom we found ourselves, compiled, needless
to state, from information which we subsequently collected.
</p>
<p>The name of this country, to begin at the beginning, is Zu-Vendis,
from Zu, ‘yellow’, and Vendis, ‘place or country’. Why it is called the
Yellow Country I have never been able to ascertain accurately, nor do
the inhabitants themselves know. Three reasons are, however, given, each
of which would suffice to account for it. The first is that the name
owes its origin to the great quantity of gold that is found in the land.
Indeed, in this respect Zu-Vendis is a veritable Eldorado, the precious
metal being extraordinarily plentiful. At present it is collected from
purely alluvial diggings, which we subsequently inspected, and which
are situated within a day’s journey from Milosis, being mostly found in
pockets and in nuggets weighing from an ounce up to six or seven pounds
in weight. But other diggings of a similar nature are known to exist,
and I have besides seen great veins of gold-bearing quartz. In Zu-Vendis
gold is a much commoner metal than silver, and thus it has curiously
enough come to pass that silver is the legal tender of the country.
</p><p>The second reason given is, that at certain times of the year the native
grasses of the country, which are very sweet and good, turn as yellow
as ripe corn; and the third arises from a tradition that the people
were originally yellow skinned, but grew white after living for many
generations upon these high lands. Zu-Vendis is a country about the size
of France, is, roughly speaking, oval in shape; and on every side
cut off from the surrounding territory by illimitable forests of
impenetrable thorn, beyond which are said to be hundreds of miles of
morasses, deserts, and great mountains. It is, in short, a huge, high
tableland rising up in the centre of the dark continent, much as
in southern Africa flat-topped mountains rise from the level of the
surrounding veldt. Milosis itself lies, according to my aneroid, at a
level of about nine thousand feet above the sea, but most of the land
is even higher, the greatest elevation of the open country being, I
believe, about eleven thousand feet. As a consequence the climate
is, comparatively speaking, a cold one, being very similar to that of
southern England, only brighter and not so rainy. The land is, however,
exceedingly fertile, and grows all cereals and temperate fruits and
timber to perfection; and in the lower-lying parts even produces a hardy
variety of sugar-cane. Coal is found in great abundance, and in many
places crops out from the surface; and so is pure marble, both black and
white. The same may be said of almost every metal except silver, which
is scarce, and only to be obtained from a range of mountains in the
north.
</p><p>Zu-Vendis comprises in her boundaries a great variety of scenery,
including two ranges of snow-clad mountains, one on the western boundary
beyond the impenetrable belt of thorn forest, and the other piercing the
country from north to south, and passing at a distance of about eighty
miles from Milosis, from which town its higher peaks are distinctly
visible. This range forms the chief watershed of the land. There are
also three large lakes--the biggest, namely that whereon we emerged, and
which is named Milosis after the city, covering some two hundred square
miles of country--and numerous small ones, some of them salt.
</p><p>The population of this favoured land is, comparatively speaking, dense,
numbering at a rough estimate from ten to twelve millions. It is almost
purely agricultural in its habits, and divided into great classes as
in civilized countries. There is a territorial nobility, a considerable
middle class, formed principally of merchants, officers of the army,
etc.; but the great bulk of the people are well-to-do peasants who live
upon the lands of the lords, from whom they hold under a species of
feudal tenure. The best bred people in the country are, as I think I
have said, pure whites with a somewhat southern cast of countenance; but
the common herd are much darker, though they do not show any negro or
other African characteristics. As to their descent I can give no certain
information. Their written records, which extend back for about a
thousand years, give no hint of it. One very ancient chronicler does
indeed, in alluding to some old tradition that existed in his day, talk
of it as having probably originally ‘come down with the people from the
coast’, but that may mean little or nothing. In short, the origin of the
Zu-Vendi is lost in the mists of time. Whence they came or of what race
they are no man knows. Their architecture and some of their sculptures
suggest an Egyptian or possibly an Assyrian origin; but it is well
known that their present remarkable style of building has only sprung up
within the last eight hundred years, and they certainly retain no traces
of Egyptian theology or customs. Again, their appearance and some
of their habits are rather Jewish; but here again it seems hardly
conceivable that they should have utterly lost all traces of the Jewish
religion. Still, for aught I know, they may be one of the lost ten
tribes whom people are so fond of discovering all over the world, or
they may not. I do not know, and so can only describe them as I find
them, and leave wiser heads than mine to make what they can out of it,
if indeed this account should ever be read at all, which is exceedingly
doubtful.
</p><p>And now after I have said all this, I am, after all, going to hazard a
theory of my own, though it is only a very little one, as the young lady
said in mitigation of her baby. This theory is founded on a legend which
I have heard among the Arabs on the east coast, which is to the effect
that ‘more than two thousand years ago’ there were troubles in the
country which was known as Babylonia, and that thereon a vast horde of
Persians came down to Bushire, where they took ship and were driven by
the north-east monsoon to the east coast of Africa, where, according to
the legend, ‘the sun and fire worshippers’ fell into conflict with the
belt of Arab settlers who even then were settled on the east coast, and
finally broke their way through them, and, vanishing into the interior,
were no more seen. Now, I ask, is it not at least possible that the
Zu-Vendi people are the descendants of these ‘sun and fire worshippers’
who broke through the Arabs and vanished? As a matter of fact, there
is a good deal in their characters and customs that tallies with the
somewhat vague ideas that I have of Persians. Of course we have no books
of reference here, but Sir Henry says that if his memory does not fail
him, there was a tremendous revolt in Babylon about 500 BC, whereon
a vast multitude were expelled from the city. Anyhow, it is a
well-established fact that there have been many separate emigrations
of Persians from the Persian Gulf to the east coast of Africa up to as
lately as seven hundred years ago. There are Persian tombs at Kilwa, on
the east coast, still in good repair, which bear dates showing them to
be just seven hundred years old. {Endnote 12}
</p><p>In addition to being an agricultural people, the Zu-Vendi are, oddly
enough, excessively warlike, and as they cannot from the exigencies of
their position make war upon other nations, they fight among each other
like the famed Kilkenny cats, with the happy result that the population
never outgrows the power of the country to support it. This habit of
theirs is largely fostered by the political condition of the country.
The monarchy is nominally an absolute one, save in so far as it is
tempered by the power of the priests and the informal council of the
great lords; but, as in many other institutions, the king’s writ does
not run unquestioned throughout the length and breadth of the land. In
short, the whole system is a purely feudal one (though absolute serfdom
or slavery is unknown), all the great lords holding nominally from the
throne, but a number of them being practically independent, having the
power of life and death, waging war against and making peace with
their neighbours as the whim or their interests lead them, and even
on occasion rising in open rebellion against their royal master or
mistress, and, safely shut up in their castles and fenced cities, as far
from the seat of government, successfully defying them for years.
</p><p>Zu-Vendis has had its king-makers as well as England, a fact that will
be well appreciated when I state that eight different dynasties have sat
upon the throne in the last one thousand years, every one of which took
its rise from some noble family that succeeded in grasping the purple
after a sanguinary struggle. At the date of our arrival in the country
things were a little better than they had been for some centuries,
the last king, the father of Nyleptha and Sorais, having been an
exceptionally able and vigorous ruler, and, as a consequence, he kept
down the power of the priests and nobles. On his death, two years before
we reached Zu-Vendis, the twin sisters, his children, were, following
an ancient precedent, called to the throne, since an attempt to exclude
either would instantly have provoked a sanguinary civil war; but it
was generally felt in the country that this measure was a most
unsatisfactory one, and could hardly be expected to be permanent.
Indeed, as it was, the various intrigues that were set on foot by
ambitious nobles to obtain the hand of one or other of the queens in
marriage had disquieted the country, and the general opinion was that
there would be bloodshed before long.
</p><p>I will now pass on to the question of the Zu-Vendi religion, which
is nothing more or less than sun-worship of a pronounced and highly
developed character. Around this sun-worship is grouped the entire
social system of the Zu-Vendi. It sends its roots through every
institution and custom of the land. From the cradle to the grave the
Zu-Vendi follows the sun in every sense of the saying. As an infant he
is solemnly held up in its light and dedicated to ‘the symbol of
good, the expression of power, and the hope of Eternity’, the ceremony
answering to our baptism. Whilst still a tiny child, his parents point
out the glorious orb as the presence of a visible and beneficent god,
and he worships it at its up-rising and down-setting. Then when still
quite small, he goes, holding fast to the pendent end of his mother’s
‘kaf’ (toga), up to the temple of the Sun of the nearest city, and
there, when at midday the bright beams strike down upon the golden
central altar and beat back the fire that burns thereon, he hears the
white-robed priests raise their solemn chant of praise and sees the
people fall down to adore, and then, amidst the blowing of the golden
trumpets, watches the sacrifice thrown into the fiery furnace beneath
the altar. Here he comes again to be declared ‘a man’ by the priests,
and consecrated to war and to good works; here before the solemn altar
he leads his bride; and here too, if differences shall unhappily arise,
he divorces her.
</p><p>And so on, down life’s long pathway till the last mile is travelled, and
he comes again armed indeed, and with dignity, but no longer a man. Here
they bear him dead and lay his bier upon the falling brazen doors before
the eastern altar, and when the last ray from the setting sun falls
upon his white face the bolts are drawn and he vanishes into the raging
furnace beneath and is ended.
</p><p>The priests of the Sun do not marry, but are recruited as young men
specially devoted to the work by their parents and supported by the
State. The nomination to the higher offices of the priesthood lies with
the Crown, but once appointed the nominees cannot be dispossessed, and
it is scarcely too much to say that they really rule the land. To begin
with, they are a united body sworn to obedience and secrecy, so that
an order issued by the High Priest at Milosis will be instantly and
unhesitatingly acted upon by the resident priest of a little country
town three or four hundred miles off. They are the judges of the land,
criminal and civil, an appeal lying only to the lord paramount of
the district, and from him to the king; and they have, of course,
practically unlimited jurisdiction over religious and moral offences,
together with a right of excommunication, which, as in the faiths of
more highly civilized lands, is a very effective weapon. Indeed, their
rights and powers are almost unlimited, but I may as well state here
that the priests of the Sun are wise in their generation, and do not
push things too far. It is but very seldom that they go to extremes
against anybody, being more inclined to exercise the prerogative of
mercy than run the risk of exasperating the powerful and vigorous-minded
people on whose neck they have set their yoke, lest it should rise and
break it off altogether.
</p><p>Another source of the power of the priests is their practical monopoly
of learning, and their very considerable astronomical knowledge, which
enables them to keep a hold on the popular mind by predicting eclipses
and even comets. In Zu-Vendis only a few of the upper classes can read
and write, but nearly all the priests have this knowledge, and are
therefore looked upon as learned men.
</p><p>The law of the country is, on the whole, mild and just, but differs
in several respects from our civilized law. For instance, the law of
England is much more severe upon offences against property than against
the person, as becomes a people whose ruling passion is money. A man
may half kick his wife to death or inflict horrible sufferings upon his
children at a much cheaper rate of punishment than he can compound for
the theft of a pair of old boots. In Zu-Vendis this is not so, for there
they rightly or wrongly look upon the person as of more consequence
than goods and chattels, and not, as in England, as a sort of necessary
appendage to the latter. For murder the punishment is death, for treason
death, for defrauding the orphan and the widow, for sacrilege, and
for attempting to quit the country (which is looked on as a sacrilege)
death. In each case the method of execution is the same, and a rather
awful one. The culprit is thrown alive into the fiery furnace beneath
one of the altars to the Sun. For all other offences, including the
offence of idleness, the punishment is forced labour upon the vast
national buildings which are always going on in some part of the
country, with or without periodical floggings, according to the crime.
</p><p>The social system of the Zu-Vendi allows considerable liberty to the
individual, provided he does not offend against the laws and customs
of the country. They are polygamous in theory, though most of them
have only one wife on account of the expense. By law a man is bound to
provide a separate establishment for each wife. The first wife also is
the legal wife, and her children are said to be ‘of the house of the
Father’. The children of the other wives are of the houses of their
respective mothers. This does not, however, imply any slur upon either
mother or children. Again, a first wife can, on entering into the
married state, make a bargain that her husband shall marry no other
wife. This, however, is very rarely done, as the women are the great
upholders of polygamy, which not only provides for their surplus numbers
but gives greater importance to the first wife, who is thus practically
the head of several households. Marriage is looked upon as primarily
a civil contract, and, subject to certain conditions and to a proper
provision for children, is dissoluble at the will of both contracting
parties, the divorce, or ‘unloosing’, being formally and ceremoniously
accomplished by going through certain portions of the marriage ceremony
backwards.
</p><p>The Zu-Vendi are on the whole a very kindly, pleasant, and light-hearted
people. They are not great traders and care little about money, only
working to earn enough to support themselves in that class of life in
which they were born. They are exceedingly conservative, and look with
disfavour upon changes. Their legal tender is silver, cut into little
squares of different weights; gold is the baser coin, and is about
of the same value as our silver. It is, however, much prized for its
beauty, and largely used for ornaments and decorative purposes. Most of
the trade, however, is carried on by means of sale and barter, payment
being made in kind. Agriculture is the great business of the country,
and is really well understood and carried out, most of the available
acreage being under cultivation. Great attention is also given to the
breeding of cattle and horses, the latter being unsurpassed by any I
have ever seen either in Europe or Africa.
</p><p>The land belongs theoretically to the Crown, and under the Crown to the
great lords, who again divide it among smaller lords, and so on down
to the little peasant farmer who works his forty ‘reestu’ (acres) on a
system of half-profits with his immediate lord. In fact the whole system
is, as I have said, distinctly feudal, and it interested us much to meet
with such an old friend far in the unknown heart of Africa.
</p><p>The taxes are very heavy. The State takes a third of a man’s total
earnings, and the priesthood about five per cent on the remainder.
But on the other hand, if a man through any cause falls into bona fide
misfortune the State supports him in the position of life to which he
belongs. If he is idle, however, he is sent to work on the Government
undertakings, and the State looks after his wives and children. The
State also makes all the roads and builds all town houses, about which
great care is shown, letting them out to families at a small rent. It
also keeps up a standing army of about twenty thousand men, and provides
watchmen, etc. In return for their five per cent the priests attend to
the service of the temples, carry out all religious ceremonies, and keep
schools, where they teach whatever they think desirable, which is
not very much. Some of the temples also possess private property, but
priests as individuals cannot hold property.
</p><p>And now comes a question which I find some difficulty in answering. Are
the Zu-Vendi a civilized or barbarous people? Sometimes I think the one,
sometimes the other. In some branches of art they have attained the
very highest proficiency. Take for instance their buildings and their
statuary. I do not think that the latter can be equalled either in
beauty or imaginative power anywhere in the world, and as for the former
it may have been rivalled in ancient Egypt, but I am sure that it has
never been since. But, on the other hand, they are totally ignorant of
many other arts. Till Sir Henry, who happened to know something about
it, showed them how to do it by mixing silica and lime, they could
not make a piece of glass, and their crockery is rather primitive. A
water-clock is their nearest approach to a watch; indeed, ours delighted
them exceedingly. They know nothing about steam, electricity, or
gunpowder, and mercifully for themselves nothing about printing or the
penny post. Thus they are spared many evils, for of a truth our age has
learnt the wisdom of the old-world saying, ‘He who increaseth knowledge,
increaseth sorrow.’
</p><p>As regards their religion, it is a natural one for imaginative people
who know no better, and might therefore be expected to turn to the
sun and worship him as the all-Father, but it cannot justly be called
elevating or spiritual. It is true that they do sometimes speak of the
sun as the ‘garment of the Spirit’, but it is a vague term, and what
they really adore is the fiery orb himself. They also call him the ‘hope
of eternity’, but here again the meaning is vague, and I doubt if the
phrase conveys any very clear impression to their minds. Some of them
do indeed believe in a future life for the good--I know Nyleptha does
firmly--but it is a private faith arising from the promptings of the
spirit, not an essential of their creed. So on the whole I cannot say
that I consider this sun-worship as a religion indicative of a civilized
people, however magnificent and imposing its ritual, or however moral
and high-sounding the maxims of its priests, many of whom, I am sure,
have their own opinions on the whole subject; though of course they have
nothing but praise for a system which provides them with so many of the
good things of this world.
</p><p>There are now only two more matters to which I need allude--namely,
the language and the system of calligraphy. As for the former, it is
soft-sounding, and very rich and flexible. Sir Henry says that it sounds
something like modern Greek, but of course it has no connection with it.
It is easy to acquire, being simple in its construction, and a peculiar
quality about it is its euphony, and the way in which the sound of
the words adapts itself to the meaning to be expressed. Long before we
mastered the language, we could frequently make out what was meant by
the ring of the sentence. It is on this account that the language lends
itself so well to poetical declamation, of which these remarkable
people are very fond. The Zu-Vendi alphabet seems, Sir Henry says, to
be derived, like every other known system of letters, from a Phoenician
source, and therefore more remotely still from the ancient Egyptian
hieratic writing. Whether this is a fact I cannot say, not being learned
in such matters. All I know about it is that their alphabet consists of
twenty-two characters, of which a few, notably B, E, and O, are not
very unlike our own. The whole affair is, however, clumsy and puzzling.
{Endnote 13} But as the people of Zu-Vendi are not given to the writing
of novels, or of anything except business documents and records of the
briefest character, it answers their purpose well enough.
