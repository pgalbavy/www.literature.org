<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>When the King of Terrors shakes his sword at his victim, unwonted
yearnings come over the human heart. To die alone, removed from
home and friends, when strange faces are beside us, is a fate
which we all fervently pray may not be ours. Yet, when these strangers
are enemies, and our death is at their hands&mdash;when every shriek
or moan elicits only jeers and laughter, how unspeakably dreadful
is the fate! He who has lost a dear friend in war, that has languished
and died in the hands of strangers, and perhaps received no burial
at their hands&mdash;he who mourns such a loss, may be able to appreciate,
in some degree, the mournful situation of young Leland, in the
hands of the malignant Shawnees.</p>

<p>It is at such times as these, if at no other, that the stricken
and bowed heart turns to the One who alone can cheer and sustain.
When shut out from all prospect of human help, and conscious that
there is but one arm which is not shortened, we do not draw back
from calling upon that arm to sustain us in the dark hour of trial.</p>

<p>With the dull glow of the slumbering camp-fire, the grotesque
groups of almost unconscious sleepers, the solemn sighing of the
night-wind, and the twinkle of the stars through the branches
overhead&mdash;with such mournful surroundings as these, George Leland
sent up his prayer of agony to God.</p>

<p>He prayed, not for life, but for the preparation to meet the
death impending. The soft wailing of the night-zephyr seemed to
warn him that the death-angel was approaching every moment. He
prayed for his beloved sister in the hands of ruthless enemies&mdash;prayed
only as he could pray when he realized her peril. And he sent
up his petition for the safety of Leslie, who might still be awaiting
his return&mdash;for the rough ranger with him, and for the rude, untutored
negro, now his brother-prisoner.</p>

<p>A short distance away, he could discern the shadowy form of Zeb,
bound against a tree, while scattered around him were stretched
the savage sentinels, whether asleep or not he was unable to tell.
As for that matter, however, they might as well have been unconscious
as awake, for the slumber of the North American Indian is so delicate
that a falling leaf is sufficient to disturb it.</p>

<p>The heart of Leland bled for the poor ignorant colored man. His
prolonged silence showed that he had begun to realize, in some
measure, his appalling situation. His natural thoughtlessness
and recklessness could not last forever. It might carry him into
many a danger, but not <em>beyond</em> it.</p>

<p>The Shawnees seemed to imagine that the bonds of the prisoners
were secure, and that there was no possibility of their escape.
In fact, Leland had no hopes of release. Had his hands been free,
he might have ventured to do something; but at present they were
as useless as if he were deprived altogether of those members.</p>

<p>It was fully an hour beyond midnight, when, in spite of his situation,
Leland began to yield to the fatigue of the day. His head drooped
upon his breast, and he started fitfully. It is at such times
as these that the nervous system seems to be most fully alive
to what is passing. The prisoner was just in this state of mind
when his attention was arrested by a sound no louder than the
murmuring wind above him&mdash;so low, indeed, that it would have escaped
his attention altogether, had it not been of a character different
from that monotonous moaning.</p>

<p>With the consciousness of this sound, came also the knowledge
that it was a continuous one, and had been in progress some time.
At first it seemed to be in the tree above him, but a moment's
listening proved that it came from the direction of the negro,
Zeb. The darkness had deepened somewhat during the last hour,
so that he could barely make the outline of the fellow, but could
not discern any motion upon his part, unless it was an absolute
change of position.</p>

<p>All doubt as to Zeb being the author of the disturbing sound
was removed as soon as Leland became fully awake. It came directly
from toward him, and was of such a nature that it could not have
been caused by one of the sleeping Shawnees. With his eyes intently
fixed upon the shadowy outlines of the negro, Leland saw the upper
part of his body move forward, and then suddenly straighten itself
again. This singular movement was repeated several times, and
then, to his amazement, he saw the African step clear away from
the tree and approach him!</p>

<p>As Zeb deposited his foot upon the ground, it was slowly and
cautiously, and at each time he threw his outstretched arms upward,
like a bird when flying, distorting his face also, as if the effort
caused him extreme pain. But he passed the sleepers safely, and
was soon beside his master.</p>

<p>"How did you succeed in freeing yourself?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Golly, I chawed 'em off!" he replied, with a suppressed chuckle.
"Had a great notion of chawin' de tree off, so dat it mought fall
on dem and broke dar necks."</p>

<p>"'Sh! you are making too much noise," admonished Leland, in a
guarded whisper.</p>

<p>"Shall I eat up your cords?"</p>

<p>"Loosen them around my wrists and arms, and then I will help
myself."</p>

<p>"Yere's de instruments dat will do dat same t'ing," said Zeb,
applying himself to the task at once. He progressed with such
celerity and success that in a few moments, to Leland's unspeakable
delight, he found his arms at liberty. It need scarcely be said
that these were immediately used to assist the negro in his further
efforts.</p>

<p>The excitement and nervousness of the young man were so great,
that when his limbs were freed of the fetters he was scarcely
able to stand, and, for a few moments, was on the very verge of
fainting. The sudden renewal of hope overcame him for the time.
By a powerful effort he regained his self-possession, and strove,
in the few hurried seconds that were his, to decide upon some
means of action.</p>

<p>It may be said that the two prisoners were literally surrounded
by savages. They were stretched on every side of them, and before
either dare hope to escape, it was necessary (if the expression
be allowable) to scale the dreaded prisonwall. Leland had good
cause to fear success for himself and his sable companion in this
attempt. He found, to his chagrin and dismay, that scarcely any
reliance at all could be placed upon his own limbs. His legs especially,
from their long confinement in one position, were so cramped and
spasmodic, that, when he stepped out from the tree to join the
negro, one of them doubled like a reed beneath him and let him
fall to the ground. He believed it was all over with him; but
his fall was so gentle as not to disturb the sleepers, and he
once more raised himself to his feet.</p>

<p>"Shan't I carry dat sick leg while you walk wid de oder one?"
inquired Zeb, in a sympathetic tone.</p>

<p>"It is almost useless to me at present," replied Leland. "Let
me lean upon you while we walk, and for the love of heaven, Zeb,
be cautious. A single mismove, and it will be all up with us."</p>

<p>"Strikes dis chile dat it was ober wid you jes' now, de way you
cawalloped onto de ground jes' now."</p>

<p>"My leg is asleep and numb."</p>

<p>"Let's wake it up, den."</p>

<p>Leland paused a few moments until the circulation was somewhat
restored; but, as every moment seemed so fraught with peril to
him, he whispered to the negro to move ahead, repeating his petition
for him to exercise the most extreme caution in all his movements.</p>

<p>After all, the young man knew that the peril of both lay in the
habitual recklessness of the ignorant fellow.</p>

<p>At first Zeb entirely overdid the matter. The trained elephant
that steps over the prostrate and pompous form of Van Amburgh,
was not more careful and tardy in the performance of his feat
than was the negro in passing the unconscious form of a Shawnee.
Although Leland deemed this circumspection unnecessary, he did
not protest, as he feared, in case he did so, the negro would
run into the opposite extreme.</p>

<p>The foot of Zeb was lifted in the very act of stepping over the
third and last savage, when a smoldering ember parted, and a twist
of flame flared up. At that instant, he looked down and recognized
in the features of the Indian, the one who had taken such especial
delight in tormenting him through the day. The negro paused while
he was yet astride of him.</p>

<p>"Look dar!" he whispered, "dat's him; tired himself out so much
pullin' at my wool, dat he is sleepin' like a chicken in de egg."</p>

<p>Leland made no reply, but motioned for him to proceed; but Zeb
stubbornly maintained his position.</p>

<p>"Look what a mouf he has!" he added; "tremenjus! If 'twas only
two, free inches wider on each side, he mought outshine me; but
it's no use de way de affair is got up jes' now."</p>

<p>"Go on! go on!" repeated Leland, shoving him impatiently with
his hand.</p>

<p>"In jes' one minit. Dat's him dat bothered me so much to-day.
I'd like to smoke him for it! Gorra! if he hain't woke. Dar&mdash;take
dat!"</p>

<p>The savage, who had been awakened and alarmed by the voice of
the negro, received a smashing blow in his face, that straightened
him out completely. Realizing his imminent peril, Leland at once
leaped away in the woods at the top of his speed, the negro taking
a direction almost opposite. Every Shawnee was aroused; the critical
moment for the fugitives was upon them.</p>
