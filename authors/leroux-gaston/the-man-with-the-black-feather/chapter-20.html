<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>That profound sadness was destined to affect seriously the future
of Theophrastus. As he made his way over the roofs of Gerando
Street, it increased to such a paralysing intensity that presently
he sat down on the edge of a roof, with his legs dangling over
the street, and plunged into the bitterest reflections. The result
of this unwise action was that he caught a severe cold.</p>

<p>As he sat reflecting, he slowly came to himself, his modern self.
During the reading of the article which narrated the crimes of
the new Cartouche, he had displayed a carelessness airy to the
point of callousness. Now the sense of his responsibility, especially
in the matter of cutting up the butcher Houdry, weighed on him
more and more heavily. The memory of many midnight outings, by
way of the chimney he had just climbed, came into his mind; and
several sanguinary crimes filled his blinking eyes with the too
tardy tears of an ineffectual remorse.</p>

<p>So, in spite of all the suffering he had endured, in spite of
all the passionate prayers of M. de la Nox to Æon, Source of Æons,
<em>Cartouche was not dead; the Black Feather ever sprouted afresh</em>.
This very night, as on so many other nights of crime, he was out
on the roofs of Paris with his familiar spirit and his Black Feather.
He wept. He cursed that mysterious and irresistible force which,
from the depth of the centuries, bade him slay. He cursed the
gesture which slays. He thought of his wife and his friend. He
recalled with bitter regret the hours of happiness passed with
those dear ones. He forgave them their terror and their flight.
He resolved never again henceforth to trouble their peaceful hours
with his red vagaries.</p>

<p>"Let us vanish!" said he. "Let us hide our shame and our original
obliquity in the heart of the desert! They will forget me!...
I shall forget myself! Let us profit by these <em>moments of reason</em>
in which my brain, for the while free from the Past, discusses,
weighs, deduces, and forms conclusions in the <em>Present</em>.
It is no longer Cartouche who speaks. To-night it is Theophrastus
who wills! Theophrastus who cries to Cartouche: 'Let us fly! let
us fly! Since I love Marceline, let us fly! Since I love Adolphe,
let us fly! One day they will be happy without thee; with thee
there is no longer any happiness!... Farewell! Farewell, Marceline,
beloved wife! Farewell, Adolphe, dear friend and comforter!...
Farewell! Theophrastus bids you farewell!'"</p>

<p>He wept and wept. Then he said aloud:</p>

<p>"Come along, Cartouche."</p>

<p>He plunged into the night, springing from gutter to gutter, crawling
from roof to roof, sliding from the tops of walls with the ease,
the balance, and the sureness of a somnambulist.</p>

<p>And now, who is this man who, with bowed head and stooping back,
his hands in his pockets, wanders like Fortune's step-son through
the bitter wind and the rain that falls all the dreary way? He
moves along the road which runs beside the railway, a road dismally
straight, bordered by dismal little stunted trees, the dismal
ornaments of the departmental road, the road which runs beside
the railway. Whence does this man, or rather this shadow of a
man, this sad shadow of a man, with his hands in his pockets,
come? On his right and on his left stretches the plain, without
an undulation, without the bulge of a hill, without the hollow
of a river&mdash;stretches grey and gloomy under the grey and gloomy
sky.</p>

<p>Now and again along the railway, so painfully straight, trains
pass,&mdash;slow trains, express trains, freight trains. While they
pass the railway snores; then it is silent, and one hears, borne
on the wind, the ting-ting-ting-ting of the little electric bell
in the little railway station in front. But what little railway
station? There is one in front; there is one behind. They are
three miles apart; and between them the double line of rails runs
as straight as a die. Between the two railway stations there are
no viaducts, no tunnel, no bridge, not even a level-crossing.
I dwell on these details on account of the strange behaviour of
the express train.</p>

<p>That sad shadow of a man is Theophrastus. He has resolved to
fly, to fly no matter where, from his wife&mdash;poor dear, unfortunate,
heroic fellow! After a night passed on the roofs of Paris, not
knowing whither to direct his steps, yet not wishing to stay them,
he went into a railway station&mdash;what railway station? Shall we
ever know? &mdash;And without a ticket he got on a train, and
without a ticket somewhere he got off it and came out of another
railway station. It may be that in this evasion of the duties
of the passenger his Black Feather stood him in good stead.</p>

<p>Behold him then on the road... At the entrance to a village...
On the road which runs beside the railway.</p>

<p>Whom does he perceive on the threshold of a cottage at the entrance
to the village?... The Signora Petito herself!</p>

<p>It was the first time the Signora Petito had seen M. Longuet
since he clipped her husband's ears. She fell into a fury. She
ran down to the garden gate; and her anger found vent not only
in abuse, but in the most imprudent revelations. Had Signor Petito
heard what his angry Regina said, he would have smacked her for
her incredible folly. After abusing Theophrastus for his barbarity
to Signor Petito, she told him with vindictive triumph that her
husband had found the treasures of the Chopinettes, and that those
treasures were the richest in the world, treasures worth far more
than a couple of ears, were they as big as the ears of Signor
Petito. "They are quits!"</p>

<p>In the course of this outburst, Theophrastus with considerable
difficulty interjected a few words; but he was not at all disturbed
by it. Indeed he was grateful to the fury of Signora Petito for
having given him such important information. He said grimly:</p>

<p>"<em>I shall find my treasures, for I shall find Signor Petito.</em>"</p>

<p>The Signora Petito burst into a satanic laugh, and cried:</p>

<p>"Signor Petito is in the train!"</p>

<p>"In what train?"</p>

<p>"<em>In the train which is going to pass under your nose.</em>"</p>

<p>"What is the train which is going to pass under my nose?"</p>

<p>"The train which is carrying my husband beyond the frontier!
Get into it, M. Longuet! Get into it if you want to speak to Signor
Petito. But you'd better make haste, for it passes in less than
an hour, and you can't buy a ticket for it at any of these little
stations. <em>It doesn't stop at them!</em>"</p>

<p>She laughed an even more satanic laugh, so satanic that Theophrastus
longed for the moments when he was deaf. He raised his hat, and
went quickly down the road which runs beside the railway. When
he was alone, between the little trees and the telegraph posts,
he said to himself:</p>

<p>"Come, come! I must ask news of my treasures of Signor Petito
himself... But how the deuce am I to do it? He is in the train
<em>which is going to pass under my nose</em>."</p>

<p>At this point it is necessary to give a map:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Station A       D    C     Station B.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x&#11834;x&#11834;x&#11834;x

</p>
</div>
<p>It is unnecessary to give the names of the stations, for the
demonstration is practically geometrical, and to geometry letters
are more appropriate.</p>

<p>Let us go to station A. The signal-man of station A hears the
<em>ting!</em> of the bell which announces that the express he
is expecting has passed station B, and is on that section of the
block-system which begins at station A and ends at station B.
The express goes from B to A. It is on the line B A. That is clear.
The signal at A announces the train by lowering its little red
arm with a <em>ting!</em></p>

<p>The signal-man at station A waits for the train, and waits for
the train, and waits for the train! It ought to be there. It is
a train which goes sixty miles an hour, and, if it is late, it
goes seventy or eighty. The distance between station A and station
B is at the most three miles and a furlong. Three minutes and
a half is the longest an express takes to do the distance. The
signal-man, frightened to death at not seeing the train appear,
shouts to the station-master that the train ought to have gone
through! The station-master dashes to the telegraph, and telegraphs
station B: "Train signalled not arrived!" Station B answers: "Joker!"
Station A: "It's serious. What are we to do? Horrible anxiety."
Station B: "Notify Jericho!" Station A: "There must have been
an accident! We are hurrying along the line! Come and meet us!"
Station B: "What can have happened? We are coming."</p>

<p>Then the station-master, the porters, and the ticket-clerks of
stations A and B hurry along the line, the staff of station A
going towards station B, the staff of station B going towards
station A. They hurry along, in the full light of day, in the
middle of a perfectly flat plain, a plain without a river, without
ridge, and without hollow. They hurry along the line, and meet
one another between A and <em>B.... </em>But they do not meet
the train!</p>

<p>The station-master of station A (I say particularly of station
A), who suffered from heart disease, fell down dead.</p>
