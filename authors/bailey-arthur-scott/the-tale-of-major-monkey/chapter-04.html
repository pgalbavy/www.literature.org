<p>Afterward old Mr. Crow had to admit that he must have been forgetful.
He had told Major Monkey to hide inside the hollow tree. And being a
total stranger in the neighborhood, of course the Major didn't know
that an owl lived there.
</p>
<p>So he entered the dark hole boldly. And soon he came dashing out of it
much faster than he had gone in, shrieking at the top of his voice.
</p><p>Old Mr. Crow was poised on a branch, as if he were waiting for
something. And he almost smiled as he looked at the Major and saw that
he was shaking. The poor fellow's teeth were chattering, too.
</p><p>"What's the matter?" Mr. Crow called to him.
</p><p>"There's--there's a Tiger inside this tree!" Major Monkey stammered. "I
know it's a Tiger, for I saw his eyes."
</p><p>"Nonsense!" Mr. Crow exclaimed. And he burst into a loud <u>haw-haw</u>.
"It's nothing but an old Owl. I forgot all about him. A fine soldier
you are--afraid of an old Owl!"
</p><p>Major Monkey straightened his cap and looked as soldierly as he could.
</p><p>"You're mistaken, in a way," he told Mr. Crow. "I admit I was afraid.
I was <u>afraid I had frightened him</u>, waking him up so suddenly. So I
retreated."
</p><p>Old Mr. Crow stopped laughing and looked very thoughtful. It occurred
to him that Major Monkey was a somewhat slippery person. Certainly he
could slip out of a hole about as easily as anybody Mr. Crow knew.
</p><p>"You'll have to find some other place for me to hide," the Major
announced. "I don't want to stay in this tree all day, for I shouldn't
like to disturb a gentleman's rest."
</p><p>Mr. Crow pondered for a few moments.
</p><p>"You see that old haystack?" he said at last, pointing across the
fields. "Go and burrow under that. And be back here exactly an hour
before sunset."
</p><p>Major Monkey saluted.
</p><p>"That suits me," he said. And then he turned and scurried down to the
ground, leaped quickly upon the fence, and galloped off along the
topmost rails.
</p><hr/>
<p>Mr. Crow spent a very busy day inviting everybody to his party, to
meet his old friend, Major Monkey.
</p><p>"He's a famous soldier," Mr. Crow explained, when people asked him
questions. "And I hope you'll all wear your best clothes, because the
Major himself is very handsomely dressed. There's gold braid on his
coat, and on his cap, too."
</p><p>The old gentleman talked so much about the Major's uniform that a good
many of the neighbors thought that Mr. Crow ought to postpone his
party for a few days, until they could get Mr. Frog, the tailor, to
make them some new clothes.
</p><p>But Mr. Crow wouldn't listen to them.
</p><p>"No!" he said. "We mustn't wait. My friend the Major is a great
traveller. There's no knowing when he will take it into his head to
move on. And if you want to meet him there's no time like the
present."
</p><p>Well, people were so busy getting ready for the party that there was a
great flurry everywhere all day long--except at the haystack, where
Major Monkey was hiding. And even he did not have so dull a time as
you might suppose.
</p><p>Luckily, he had discovered a lone apple tree near-by. And being fond
of fruit he crept out of the haystack every few minutes and gathered
apples.
</p><p>What he could eat, he ate greedily. And what he couldn't he hid under
the stack.
</p><p>And on the whole, he had rather a pleasant time.
