<p>During the next two hours they saw, in the distance, three more
corpses. Frequent shots were fired, but whence they did not know.
Single prowlers were becoming rare; they encountered rather groups
consisting of men of all classes and nationalities, who had joined for
purposes of defence. But quarrels broke out within these groups, the
moment there was the least booty in dispute, or even the faintest hope
of booty. No discipline was accepted save that imposed by force.
</p><p>When one of these wandering bands seemed to be approaching them, Simon
carried his rifle ostentatiously as though on the point of taking aim.
He entered into conversation only at a distance and with a forbidding
and repellent air.
</p><p>Dolores watched him uneasily, avoiding speech with him. Once she had
to tell him that he was taking the wrong direction and to prove his
mistake to him. But this involved an explanation to which he listened
with impatience and which he cut short by grumbling:
</p><p>"And then? What does it matter if we keep to the right or to the left?
We know nothing. There is nothing to prove that Rolleston has taken
Miss Bakefield with him on his expedition. He may have imprisoned her
somewhere, until he is free to return for her . . . so that, in
following him, I risk the chance of going farther away from her.
. . ."
</p><p>Nevertheless, the need of action drew him on, however uncertain the
goal to be achieved. He could never have found heart to apply himself
to investigations or to check the impulse which urged him onward.
</p><p>Dolores marched indefatigably by his side, sometimes even in front.
She had taken off her shoes and stockings. He watched her bare feet
making their light imprint in the sand. Her hips swayed as she walked,
as with American girls. She was all grace, strength and suppleness.
Less distracted, paying more attention to external things, she probed
the horizon with her keen gaze. It was while doing so that she cried,
pointing with outstretched hand:
</p><p>"Look over there, the aeroplane!"
</p><p>It was right at the top of a long, long upward slope of the whole
plain, at a spot where the mist and the ground were blended till they
could not say for certain whether the aeroplane was flying through the
mist or running along the soil. It looked like one of those
sailing-ships which seem suspended on the confines of the ocean. It
was only gradually that the reality became apparent: the machine was
motionless, resting on the ground.
</p><p>"There is no doubt," said Simon, "considering the direction, that this
is the aeroplane that crossed the river. Damaged by Mazzani's bullet,
it flew as far as this, where it managed to land as best it could."
</p><p>Now the figure of the pilot could be distinguished; and he too--a
strange phenomenon--was motionless, sitting in his place, his head
almost invisible behind his rounded shoulders. One of the wheels was
half-destroyed. However, the aeroplane did not appear to have suffered
very greatly. But what was this man doing, that he never moved?
</p><p>They shouted. He did not reply, nor did he turn round; and, when they
reached him, they saw that his breast was leaning against the
steering-wheel, while his arms hung down on either side. Drops of
blood were trickling from under the seat.
</p><p>Simon climbed on board and almost immediately declared:
</p><p>"He's dead. Mazzani's bullet caught him sideways behind the head.
. . . A slight wound, of which he was not conscious for some time, to
judge by the quantity of blood which he lost, probably without
knowing. . . . Then he succeeded in touching earth. And then . . .
then I don't know . . . a more violent hemorrhage, a clot on the
brain. . . ."
</p><p>Dolores joined Simon. Together they lifted the body. No foot-pads had
passed that way, for they found the dead man's papers, watch and
pocket-book untouched.
</p><p>His papers, on examination, were of no special interest. But the
route-map fixed to the steering-wheel representing the Channel and the
old coast-lines, was marked with a dot in red pencil and the words:
</p><p>      "Rain of gold."
</p><p>"He was going there too," Simon murmured. "They already know of it in
France. And here's the exact place . . . twenty-five miles from where
we are . . . between Boulogne and Hastings . . . not far from the Banc
de Bassurelle. . . ."
</p><p>And, quivering with hope, he added:
</p><p>"If I can get the thing to fly, I'll be there myself in half an hour.
. . . And I shall rescue Isabel. . . ."
</p><p>Simon set to work with a zest which nothing could discourage. The
aeroplane's injuries were not serious: a wheel was buckled, the
steering-rod bent, the feed-pipe twisted. The sole difficulty arose
from the fact that Simon found only inadequate tools in the tool-box
and no spare parts whatever. But this did not deter him; he contrived
some provisional splices and other repairs, not troubling about their
strength provided that the machine could fly for the time required:
</p><p>"After all," he said to Dolores, who was doing what she could to help
him, "after all, it is only a question of forty minutes' flight, no
more. If I can manage to take off, I'm sure to hold out. Bless my
soul, I've done more difficult things than that!"
</p><p>His joy once more bubbled over in vivacious talk. He sang, laughed,
jeered at Rolleston and pictured the ruffian's face at seeing this
implacable archangel descending from the skies. All the same, rapidly
though he worked, he realized by six o'clock in the evening that he
could scarcely finish before night and that, under these conditions,
it would be better to put off the start until next morning. He
therefore completed his repairs and carefully tested the machine,
while Dolores moved away to prepare their camp. When twilight fell,
his task was finished. Happy and smiling, he followed the path on his
right which he had seen the girl take.
</p><p>The plain fell away suddenly beyond the ridge on which the aeroplane
had stranded; and a deeper gully, between two sand-hills, led Simon to
a lower, basin-shaped plain, in the hollow of which shone a sheet of
water so limpid that he could see the bed of black rock at the bottom.
</p><p>This was the first landscape in which Simon perceived a certain charm,
a touch of terrestrial and almost human poetry; and at the far end of
the lake there stood the most incredible thing that could be imagined
in this region which only a few days earlier had been buried under the
sea: a structure which seemed to have been raised by human hands and
which was supported by columns apparently covered with fine carving!
</p><p>Dolores stepped out of it. Tall and shapely, with slow, sedate
movements, she walked in to the water, among some stones standing
upright in the lake, filled a glass and, bending backwards, drank a
few sips. Near by, a trace of steam, rising from a pannikin on a
spirit-stove, hovered in the air.
</p><p>Seeing Simon, she smiled and said:
</p><p>"Everything's ready. Here's tea, white bread and butter."
</p><p>"Do you mean it?" he said, laughing. "So there were inhabitants at the
bottom of the sea, people who grew wheat?"
</p><p>"No, but there was some food in that poor airman's box."
</p><p>"Very well; but this house, this prehistoric palace?"
</p><p>It was a very primitive palace, a wall of great stones touching one
another and surmounted by a great slab like those which top the Druid
dolmans. The whole thing was crude and massive, covered with carvings
which, when examined closely, were merely thousands of holes bored by
molluscs.
</p><p>"Lithophagic molluscs, Old Sandstone would call them. By Jove, how
excited he would be to see these remains of a dwelling which dates
thousands and thousands of centuries back and which perhaps has others
buried in the sand near it . . . a whole village, I dare say! And
isn't this positive proof that this land was inhabited before it was
invaded by the sea? Doesn't it upset all our accepted ideas, since it
throws back the appearance of men to a period which we are not
prepared to admit? Oh, you Old Sandstone, if you were only here! What
theories you could evolve!"
</p><p>Simon evolved no theories. But, though the scientific explanation of
the phenomenon meant little to him, how acutely he felt its
strangeness and how deeply stirring this moment seemed to him! Before
him, before Dolores, rose another age and in circumstances that made
them resemble two creatures of that age, the same desolate, barbarous
surroundings, the same dangers, the same pitfalls.
</p><p>And the same peace. From the threshold of their refuge stretched a
placid landscape made of sand, mist and water. The faint sound of a
little stream that fed the lake barely disturbed the infinite silence.
</p><p>He looked at his companion. No one could be better adapted to the
surrounding scene. She had its primitive charm, its wild, rather
savage character and all its mysterious poetry.
</p><p>The night stretched its veil across the lake and the hills.
</p><p>"Let us go in," she said, when they had eaten and drunk.
</p><p>"Let us go in," he said.
</p><p>She went before, then, turned to give him her hand and led him into
the chamber formed by the circle of stone slabs. Simon's lamp was
there, hanging from a projection in the wall. The floor was covered
with fine sand. Two blankets lay spread.
</p><p>Simon hesitated. Dolores held him by a firmer pressure of the hand and
he remained, despite himself, in a moment of weakness. Besides, she
suddenly switched off the lamp and he might have thought himself
alone, for he heard nothing more than the infinitely gentle lapping of
the lake against the stones upon the beach.
</p><p>It was then and really not until then that he perceived the snare
which events had laid for him by drawing him closer to Dolores during
the past three days. He had defended her, as any man would have done,
but her beauty had not for a moment affected his decision, or
stimulated his courage. Had she been old or ugly, she would have found
the same protection at his hands.
</p><p>At the present moment--he realized it suddenly--he was thinking of
Dolores not as a companion of his adventures and his dangers but as
the most beautiful and attractive of creatures. He reflected that she,
perturbed like himself, was not sleeping either, and that her eyes
were seeking him through the darkness. At her slightest movement, the
delicate perfume with which she scented her hair, mingled with the
warm emanations that floated on the breeze.
</p><p>She whispered:
</p><p>"Simon. . . . Simon. . . ."
</p><p>He did not reply. His heart was oppressed. Several times she repeated
his name; then, no doubt believing him asleep, she rose and her naked
feet lightly touched the sand. She went out.
</p><p>What was she going to do? A minute elapsed. There was a sound as of
rustling clothes. Then he heard her footsteps on the beach, followed
almost immediately by the splash of water and the sound of drops
falling in a shower. Dolores was bathing in the darkness.
</p><p>Simon was next hardly able to detect what was scarcely more
perceptible than the swan's gliding over the surface of the pond. The
silence and peace of the water remained unbroken. Dolores must have
swum towards the centre of the lake. When she returned, he once more
heard the pattering of drops and the rustle of clothes while she
dressed.
</p><p>He rose suddenly, with the intention of going out before she entered.
But she was quicker than he anticipated and they met on the threshold.
He drew back, while she asked him:
</p><p>"Were you going, Simon?"
</p><p>"Yes," he said, seeking a pretext. "I am anxious about the aeroplane
. . . some thief. . . ."
</p><p>"Yes . . . yes," she said, hesitatingly. "But I should like first
. . . to thank you. . . ."
</p><p>Their voices betrayed the same embarrassment and the same profound
agitation. The darkness hid them from each other's eyes; yet how
plainly Simon saw the young woman before him!
</p><p>"I've behaved as I should to you," he declared.
</p><p>"Not as other men have done . . . and it is that which touched me.
. . . I was struck by it from the beginning. . . ."
</p><p>Perhaps she felt by intuition that any too submissive words would
offend him, for she did not continue her confession. Only, after a
moment's pause, she murmured:
</p><p>"This is our last night alone. . . . Afterwards we shall be parted by
the whole of life . . . by everything. . . . Then . . . hold me tight
to you for a little . . . for a second. . . ."
</p><p>Simon did not move. She was asking for a display of affection of which
he dreaded the danger all the more because he longed so eagerly to
yield to it and because his will was weakening beneath the onslaught
of evil thoughts. Why should he resist? What would have been a sin and
a crime against love at ordinary times was so no longer at this period
of upheaval, when the play of natural forces and of chance gave rise
for a time to abnormal conditions of life. To kiss Dolores' lips at
such a moment: was it worse than plucking a flower that offers itself
to the hand?
</p><p>They were united by the favouring darkness. They were alone in the
world; they were both young; they were free. Dolores' hands were
outstretched in despair. Should he not give her his own and obey this
delicious dizziness which was overcoming him?
</p><p>"Simon," she said, in a voice of supplication. "Simon. . . . I ask so
little of you! . . . Don't refuse me. . . . It's not possible that you
should refuse me, is it? When you risked your life for mine, it was
because you had a . . . a feeling . . . a something. . . . I am not
mistaken, am I?"
</p><p>Simon was silent. He would not speak to her of Isabel, would not bring
Isabel's name into the duel which they were fighting.
</p><p>Dolores continued her entreaties:
</p><p>"Simon, I have never loved any one but you. . . . The others . . . the
others don't count. . . . You, the look in your eyes gave me happiness
from the first moment. . . . It was like the sun shining into my life.
. . . And I should be so happy if there were a . . . a memory between
us. You would forget it. . . . It would count for nothing with you.
. . . But for me . . . it would mean life changed . . . beautified.
. . . I should have the strength to be another woman. . . . Please,
please, give me your hand. . . . Take me in your arms. . . ."
</p><p>Simon did not move. Something more powerful than the impulse of the
temptation restrained him: his plighted word to Isabel and his love
for her. Isabel's image blended with Dolores's image; and, in his
faltering mind, in his darkened conscience, the conflict continued.
. . .
</p><p>Dolores waited. She had fallen to her knees and was whispering
indistinct words in a language which he did not understand, words of
plaintive passion of whose distress he was fully sensible, and which
mounted to his ears like a prayer and an appeal.
</p><p>In the end she fell weeping at his feet. Then he passed by, without
touching her.
</p><p>The cold night air caressed his features. He walked away at a rapid
pace, pronouncing Isabel's name with the fervour of a believer
reciting the words of a litany. He turned towards the plateau. When
almost there, he lay down against the slope of the hill and, for a
long time before falling asleep, he continued to think of Dolores as
of some one whose memory was already growing dim. The girl was
becoming once more a stranger. He would never know why she had loved
him so spontaneously and so ardently; why a nature in which instinct
must needs play so imperious a part had found room for such noble
feelings, humility and delicacy and devotion.
</p><p>In the earliest moments of the dawn he gave the aeroplane a final
examination. After a few tests which gave him good hopes of success,
he went back to the dwelling by the lake. But Dolores was gone. For an
hour he searched for her and called to her in vain. She had
disappeared without even leaving a footprint in the sand.
</p><p>On rising above the clouds into the immensity of a clear sky all
flooded with sunlight, Simon uttered a cry of joy. The mysterious
Dolores meant nothing to him now, no more than all the dangers braved
with her or all those which might still lie in wait for him. He had
surmounted every obstacle, escaped every snare. He had been victorious
in every contest; and perhaps his greatest victory was that of
resisting Dolores' enchantment.
</p><p>It was ended. Isabel had triumphed. Nothing stood between her and him.
He held the steering-wheel well under control. The motor was working
to perfection. The map and the compass were before his eyes. At the
point indicated, at the exact spot, neither too much to the right nor
too much to the left, neither overshooting nor falling short of the
mark, he would descend within a radius of a hundred yards.
</p><p>The flight certainly took less than the forty minutes which he had
allowed for. In thirty at most he covered the distance, without seeing
anything but the moving sea of clouds rolling beneath him in white
billows. All he could do now was to fling himself upon it. After
stopping his engine, he drew closer and closer, describing great
circles. Cries or rather shouts and roars rose from the ground, as
though multitudes were gathered together. Then he entered the rolling
mist, through which he continued to wheel like a bird of prey.
</p><p>He never doubted Rolleston's presence, nor the imminence of the fight
which would ensue between them, nor its favourable outcome, followed
by Isabel's release. But he dreaded the landing, the critical rock on
which he might split.
</p><p>The sight of the ground showing clear of the mist reassured him. A
wide and, as it seemed to him, almost flat space lay spread like an
arena, in which he saw nothing but four disks of sand which must
represent so many mounds and which could be easily avoided. The crowd
kept outside this arena, save for a few people who were running in all
directions and gesticulating.
</p><p>At closer quarters, the soil appeared less smooth, consisting of
endless sand-coloured pebbles, heaped in places to a certain height.
He therefore gave all his attention to avoiding collision with these
obstacles and succeeded in landing without the slightest shock and in
stopping quite quietly.
</p><p>Groups of people came running about the aeroplane. Simon thought that
they wished to help him to alight. His illusion did not last long. A
few seconds later, the aeroplane was taken by assault by some twenty
men; and Simon felt the barrels of two revolvers pushed against his
face and was bound from head to foot, wrapped in a blanket, gagged and
deprived of all power of movement, before he could even attempt the
least resistance.
</p><p>"Into the hold, with the rest of them!" commanded a hoarse voice.
"And, if he gives trouble, blow out his brains!"
</p><p>There was no need for this drastic measure. The manner in which Simon
was bound reduced him to absolute helplessness. Resigning himself to
the inevitable, he counted that the men carrying him took a hundred
and thirty steps and that their course brought him nearer to the
roaring crowd.
</p><p>"When you've quite done bawling!" grinned one of the men. "And then
make yourselves scarce, see? The machine-gun's getting to work."
</p><p>They climbed a staircase. Simon was dragged up by the cords that bound
him. A violent hand ransacked his pockets and relieved him of his arms
and his papers. He felt himself again lifted; and then he dropped into
a void.
</p><p>It was no great fall and was softened by the dense layer of captives
already swarming at the bottom of the hold, who began to swear behind
their gags.
</p><p>Using his knees and elbows, Simon made room for himself as best he
could on the floor. It must have been about nine o'clock in the
morning. From that moment, time no longer counted for him, for he
thought of nothing but how to defend the place which he had won
against any who might seek to take it from him, whether former
occupants or new-comers. Voices muffled by gags uttered furious
snarls, or groaned, breathless and exhausted. It was really hell.
There were dying men and dead bodies, the death-rattle of Frenchmen
mingling with Englishmen, blood, sticky rags and a loathsome stench of
carrion.
</p><p>During the course of the afternoon, or it might have been in the
evening, a tremendous noise broke out, like the sound of a great sheaf
of rockets, and forthwith the numberless crowd roared at the top of
its voice, with the frenzied fury of an insurgent mob. Then, suddenly,
through it all, came orders shouted in a strident voice, more powerful
than the tumult. Then a profound silence. And then a crack of sharp,
hurried explosions, followed by the frightful rattle of a machine-gun.
</p><p>This lasted for at least two or three minutes. The uproar had
recommenced; and it continued until Simon could no longer hear the
fizzing of the fireworks and the din of the shooting. They seemed
still to be fighting. They were dispatching the wounded amid curses
and shrieks of pain; and a batch of dying men was flung into the hold.
</p><p>The evening and the night wore through. Simon, who had not touched
food since his meal with Dolores beside the lake, was also suffering
cruelly from the lack of air, the weight of the dead and the living on
his chest, the gag which bruised his jaw and the blanket which wrapped
his head like a blind, air-tight hood. Were they going to leave him to
die of starvation and asphyxia, in this huddle of sticky, decomposing
flesh, above which floated the inarticulate plaint of death?
</p><p>His bandaged eyes received a feeling as though the day were breaking.
His torpid neighbours were swarming like slimy reptiles in a tub.
Then, from above, a voice growled:
</p><p>"No easy job to find him! . . . Queer notions the chief has! As well
try and pick a worm out of the mud!"
</p><p>"Take my boat-hook," said another voice. "You can use it to turn the
stiffs over like a scavenger sorting a heap of muck. . . . Lower down
than that, old man! Since yesterday morning, the bloke must be at the
bottom. . . ."
</p><p>And the first voice cried:
</p><p>"That's him! There, look, to the left! That's him! I know my rope
around his waist. . . . Patience a moment, while I hook him!"
</p><p>Simon felt something digging into him that must have been the spike of
the boat-hook catching in his bonds. He was hooked, dragged along and
hoisted from corpse to corpse to the top of the hold. The men
unfastened his legs and told him to stand up:
</p><p>"Now then, you! Up with you, my hearty!"
</p><p>His eyes still bandaged, he was seized by the arms and led out of the
wreck. They crossed the arena, whose pebbles he felt under foot, and
mounted another flight of steps, leading to the deck of another wreck.
There the men halted.
</p><p>From here, when his hood and gag were removed, Simon could see that
the arena in which he had landed was surrounded by a wall made of
barricades added according to the means at hand: ships' boats,
packing-cases and bales, rocks, banks of sand. The hulk of a
torpedo-boat was continued by some cast-iron piping. A stack of
drain-pipes was followed by a submarine.
</p><p>All along this enclosure, sentinels armed with rifles mounted guard.
Beyond it, kept at a distance of more than a hundred yards by the
menace of the rifles and of a machine-gun levelled a little way to the
rear, the swarm of marauders was eddying and bawling. Inside, there
was an expanse of yellow pebbles, sulphur-coloured, like those which
the madwoman had carried in her bag. Were the gold coins mixed with
those pebbles and had a certain number of resolute, well-armed robbers
clubbed together to exploit this precious field? Here and there rose
mounds resembling the truncated cones of small extinct volcanoes.
</p><p>Meantime, Simon's warders made him face about, in order to bind him to
the stump of a broken mast, near a group of prisoners whom other
warders were holding, like so many animals, by halters and chains.
</p><p>On this side was the general staff of the gang, sitting for the moment
as a court-martial.
</p><p>In the centre of a circle was a platform of moderate height, edged by
ten or a dozen corpses and dying men, some of the latter struggling in
hideous convulsions. On the platform a man who was drinking sat or
rather sprawled in a great throne-like chair. Near him was a stool
with bottles of champagne and a knife dripping with blood. Beside him
was a group of men with revolvers in their hands. The man in the chair
wore a black uniform relieved with decorations and stuck all over with
diamonds and precious stones. Emerald necklaces hung round his neck. A
diadem of gold and gems encircled his forehead.
</p><p>When he had finished drinking, his face appeared. Simon started. From
certain details which recalled the features of his friend Edward
Rolleston, he realized that this man was no other than Wilfred
Rolleston. Moreover, among the jewels and necklaces, was a miniature
set in pearls, the miniature and the pearls of Isabel Bakefield.
