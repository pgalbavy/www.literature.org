<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Hamil stood under the cocoanut palms at the lake's edge and watched
the lagoon where thousands of coloured lanterns moved on crafts,
invisible except when revealed in the glare of the rushing rockets.</p>

<p>Lamps glittered everywhere; electric lights were doubly festooned
along the sea wall, drooping creeper-like from palm to palmetto,
from flowering hibiscus to sprawling banyan, from dainty china-berry
to grotesque screw-pine tree, shedding strange witch-lights over
masses of blossoms, tropical and semi-tropical. Through which
the fine-spun spray of fountains drifted, and the great mousy
dusk-moths darted through the bars of light with the glimmering
bullet-flight of summer meteors.</p>

<p>And everywhere hung the scent of orange bloom and the more subtle
perfume of white and yellow jasmine floated through the trees
from gardens or distant hammocks, combining in one intoxicating
aroma, spiced always with the savour of the sea.</p>

<p>Hamil was aware of considerable noise, more or less musical,
afloat and ashore; a pretentious orchestra played third-rate music
under the hotel colonnade; melody arose from the lantern-lit lake,
with clamourous mandolins and young voices singing; and over all
hung the confused murmur of unseen throngs, harmonious, capricious;
laughter, voice answering voice, and the distant shouts as brilliantly
festooned boats hailed and were hailed across the water.</p>

<p>Hamil passed on to the left through crowded gardens, pressing
his way slowly where all around him lantern-lit faces appeared
from the dusk and vanished again into it; where the rustle of
summer gowns sweeping the shaven lawns of Bermuda grass sounded
like a breeze in the leaves.</p>

<p>Sometimes out of the dusk all tremulous with tinted light the
rainbow ray of a jewel flashed in his eyes&mdash;or sometimes he caught
the glint of eyes above the jewel&mdash;a passing view of a fair face,
a moment's encountering glance, and, maybe, a smile just as the
shadows falling turned the garden's brightness to a mystery peopled
with phantoms.</p>

<p>Out along the shell road he sauntered, Whitehall rising from
tropic gardens on his right, on his left endless gardens again,
and white villas stretching away into the starlight; on, under
the leaning coco-palms along quays and low walls of coquina where
the lagoon lay under the silvery southern planets.</p>

<p>After a little he discovered that he had left the bulk of the
throng behind, though in front of him and behind, the road was
still dotted with white-clad groups strolling or resting on the
sea-wall.</p>

<p>Far out on the lake the elfin pageant continued, but now he could
scarcely hear the music; the far cries and the hiss of the rockets
came softly as the whizzing of velvet-winged moths around orange
blossoms.</p>

<p>The January night was magnificent; he could scarcely comprehend
that this languid world of sea and palm, of heavy odour and slow
breezes, was his own land still. Under the spell the Occident
vanished; it was the Orient&mdash;all this dreamy mirage, these dim
white walls, this spice-haunted dusk, the water inlaid with stars,
the fairy foliage, the dew drumming in the stillness like the
sound of goblin tattooing.</p>

<p>Never before had he seen this enchanted Southern land which had
always been as much a part of his mother-land as Northern hill
and Western plain&mdash;as much his as the roaring dissonance of Broadway,
or the icy silence of the tundras, or the vast tranquil seas of
corn rippling mile on mile under the harvest moon of Illinois.</p>

<p>He halted, unquiet in the strangeness of it all, restless under
its exotic beauty, conscious of the languor stealing over him&mdash;the
premonition of a physical relaxation that he had never before
known&mdash;that he instinctively mistrusted.</p>

<p>People in groups passed and repassed along the lagoon wall where,
already curiously tired, he had halted beside an old bronze cannon&mdash;some
ancient Spanish piece, if he could judge by the arms and arabesques
covering the breech, dimly visible in the rays of a Chinese lantern.</p>

<p>Beyond was a private dock where two rakish power-boats lay, receiving
their cargo of young men and girls&mdash;all very animated and gay
under the gaudy electric lanterns strung fore and aft rainbow
fashion.</p>

<p>He seated himself on the cannon, lingering until both boats cleared
for the carnival, rushing out into the darkness like streaks of
multi-coloured flame; then his lassitude increasing, he rose and
sauntered toward the hotel which loomed like a white mountain
afire above the dark masses of tropic trees. And again the press
of the throng hemmed him in among the palms and fountains and
hedges of crimson hibiscus; again the dusk grew gay with voices
and the singing overtone of violins; again the suffocating scent
of blossoms, too sweet and penetrating for the unacclimated, filtered
through and through him, till his breath came unevenly, and the
thick odours stirred in him strange senses of expectation, quickening
with his pulses to a sudden prophecy.</p>

<p>And at the same instant he saw the girl of whom he had been thinking.</p>

<p>She was on the edge of a group of half a dozen or more men in
evening dress, and women in filmy white&mdash;already close to him&mdash;so
near that the frail stuff of her skirt brushed him, and the subtle,
fresh aroma of her seemed to touch his cheek like a breath as
she passed.</p>

<p>"Calypso," he whispered, scarcely conscious that he spoke aloud.</p>

<p>A swift turn of her head, eyes that looked blankly into his,
and she had passed.</p>

<p>A sudden realisation of his bad manners left his ears tingling.
What on earth had prompted him to speak? What momentary relaxation
had permitted him an affront to a young girl whose attitude toward
him that morning had been so admirable?</p>

<p>Chagrined, he turned back to seek some circling path through
the dense crowd ahead; and was aware, in the darkness, of a shadowy
figure entering the jasmine arbour. And though his eyes were still
confused by the lantern light he knew her again in the dusk.</p>

<p>As they passed she said under her breath: "That was ill-bred.
I am disappointed."</p>

<p>He wheeled in his tracks; she turned to confront him for an instant.</p>

<p>"I'm just a plain beast," he said. "You won't forgive me of course."</p>

<p>"You had no right to say what you did. You said 'Calypso'&mdash;and
I ought not to have heard you.... But I did.... Tell me; if I
am too generous to suspect you of intentional impertinence, you
are now too chastened to suspect that I came back to give you
this chance. That is quite true, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Of course. You <em>are</em> generous and&mdash;it's simply fine of
you to overlook it."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether I intend to overlook it; I was surprised
and disappointed; but I <em>did</em> desire to give you another
chance. And I was so afraid you'd be rude enough to take it that
&mdash;I spoke first. That was logical. Oh, I know what I'm doing&mdash;and
it's particularly common of me&mdash;being who I am&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused, meeting his gaze deliberately.</p>

<p>"You don't know who I am. Do you?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "I don't deserve to. But I'll be miserable until
I do."</p>

<p>After a moment: "And you are not going to ask me&mdash;because, once,
I said that it was nice of you not to?"</p>

<p>The hint of mockery in her voice edged his lips with a smile,
but he shook his head. "No, I won't ask you that," he said. "I've
been beastly enough for one day."</p>

<p>"Don't you care to know?"</p>

<p>"Of course I care to know."</p>

<p>"Yet, exercising all your marvellous masculine self-control,
you nobly refuse to ask?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid to," he said, laughing; "I'm horribly afraid of you."</p>

<p>She considered him with clear, unsmiling eyes.</p>

<p>"Coward!" she said calmly.</p>

<p>He nodded his head, laughing still. "I know it; I almost lost
you by saying 'Calypso' a moment ago and I'm taking no more risks."</p>

<p>"Am I to infer that you expect to recover me after this?"</p>

<p>And, as he made no answer: "You dare not admit that you hope
to see me again. You <em>are</em> horribly afraid of me&mdash;even
if I have defied convention and your opinions and have graciously
overlooked your impertinence. In spite of all this you are still
afraid of me. Are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "as much as I naturally ought to be."</p>

<p>"<em>That</em> is nice of you. There's only one kind of a girl
of whom men are really afraid.... And now I don't exactly know
what to do about you&mdash;being, myself, as guilty and horrid as you
have been."</p>

<p>She regarded him contemplatively, her hands joined behind her
back.</p>

<p>"Exactly what to do about you I don't know," she repeated, leisurely
inspecting him. "Shall I tell you something? I am not afraid to;
I am not a bit cowardly about it either. Shall I?"</p>

<p>"If you dare," he said, smiling and uncertain.</p>

<p>"Very well, then; I rather like you, Mr. Hamil."</p>

<p>"You <em>are</em> a trump!" he blurted out, reddening with surprise.</p>

<p>"Are you astonished that I know you?"</p>

<p>"I don't see how you found out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Found out! What perfectly revolting vanity! Do you suppose that
the moment I left you I rushed home and began to make happy and
incoherent inquiries? Mr. Hamil, you disappoint me every time
you speak&mdash;and also every time you don't."</p>

<p>"I seem to be doomed."</p>

<p>"You are. You can't help it. Tell me&mdash;as inoffensively as possible&mdash;are
you here to begin your work?"</p>

<p>"M-my work?"</p>

<p>"Yes, on the Cardross estate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have heard of that!" he exclaimed, surprised.</p>

<p>"Y-es&mdash;" negligently. "Petty gossip circulates here. A cracker
at West Palm Beach built a new chicken coop, and we all heard
of it. Tell me, do you still desire to see me again?"</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;to pay a revengeful debt or two."</p>

<p>"Oh! I have offended you? Pay me now, if you please, and let
us end this indiscretion."</p>

<p>"You will let me see you again, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Why? Mr. Hamil."</p>

<p>"Because I &mdash;I <em>must</em>!"</p>

<p>"Oh! You are becoming emphatic. So I am going.... And I've half
a mind to take you back and present you to my family.... Only
it wouldn't do for <em>me</em>; any other girl perhaps might dare&mdash;under
the circumstances; but <em>I</em> can't&mdash;and that's all I'll tell
you."</p>

<p>Hamil, standing straight and tall, straw hat tucked under one
arm, bent toward her with the formality and engaging deference
natural to him.</p>

<p>"You have been very merciful to me; only a girl of your caste
could afford to. Will you forgive my speaking to you as I did?&mdash;when
I said 'Calypso!' I have no excuse; I don't know why I did. I'm
even sorrier for myself than for you."</p>

<p>"I <em>was</em> hurt.... Then I supposed that you did not mean
it. Besides"&mdash;she looked up with her rare smile&mdash;"I knew you,
Mr. Hamil, in the boat this morning. I haven't really been very
dreadful."</p>

<p>"You knew even <em>then</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did. The Palm Beach News published your picture a week
ago; and I read all about the very remarkable landscape architect
who was coming to turn the Cardross jungle into a most wonderful
Paradise."</p>

<p>"You knew me all that time?"</p>

<p>"All of it, Mr. Hamil."</p>

<p>"From the moment you climbed into my boat?"</p>

<p>"Practically. Of course I did not look at you very closely at
first.... Does that annoy you? It seems to ... or something does,
for even in the dusk I can see your ever-ready blush&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't know why you pretend to think me such a fool," he protested,
laughing; "you seemed to take that for granted from the very first."</p>

<p>"Why not? You persistently talked to me when you didn't know
me&mdash;you're doing it now for that matter!&mdash;and you began by telling
me that I was fool-hardy, not really courageous in the decent
sense of the word, and that I was a self-conscious stick and a
horribly inhuman and unnatural object generally&mdash;and all because
I wouldn't flirt with you&mdash;"</p>

<p>His quick laughter interrupted her. She ventured to laugh a little
too&mdash;a very little; and that was the charm of her to him&mdash;the
clear-eyed, delicate gravity not lightly transformed. But when
her laughter came, it came as such a surprisingly lovely revelation
that it left him charmed and silent.</p>

<p>"I wonder," she said, "if you can be amusing&mdash;except when you
don't mean to be."</p>

<p>"If you'll give me a chance to try&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. I was hardly fair to you in that boat."</p>

<p>"If you knew me in the boat this morning, why did you not say
so?"</p>

<p>"Could I admit that I knew you without first pretending I didn't?
Hasn't every woman a Heaven-given right to travel in a circle
as the shortest distance between two points?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; only&mdash;"</p>

<p>She shook her head slowly. "There's no use in my telling you
who I am, now, considering that I can't very well escape exposure
in the near future. That might verge on effrontery&mdash;and it's horrid
enough to be here with you&mdash;in spite of several thousand people
tramping about within elbow touch.... Which reminds me that my
own party is probably hunting for me.... Such a crowd, you know,
and so easy to become separated. What do you suppose they'd think
if they suspected the truth?... And the worst of it is that I
cannot afford to do a thing of this sort.... You don't understand;
but you may some day&mdash;partly. And then perhaps you'll think this
matter all over and come to a totally different conclusion concerning
my overlooking your recent rudeness and&mdash;and my consenting to
speak to you."</p>

<p>"You don't believe for one moment that I could mistake it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It depends upon what sort of a man you really are.... I don't
know. I give you the benefit of all doubts."</p>

<p>She stood silent, looking him candidly in the eyes, then with
a gesture and the slightest shrug, she turned away toward the
white road outside. He was at her elbow in two steps.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;the irony of formality."</p>

<p>She nodded. "Good night, then, Mr. Hamil. If circumstances permitted
it would have been delightful&mdash;this putting off the cloak of convention
and donning motley for a little unconventional misbehaviour with
you.... But as it is, it worries me&mdash;slightly&mdash;as much as the
episode and your opinion are worth."</p>

<p>"I am wondering," he said, "why this little tincture of bitterness
flavours what you say to me?"</p>

<p>"Because I've misbehaved; and so have you. Anyway, now that it's
done, there's scarcely anything I could do to make the situation
more flagrant or less flippant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't really think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly. After all is said and done, we <em>don't</em> know
each other; here we are, shamelessly sauntering side by side under
the jasmine, Paul-and-Virginia-like, exchanging subtleties blindfolded.
You are you; I am I; formally, millions of miles apart&mdash;temporarily
and informally close together, paralleling each other's course
through life for the span of half an hour&mdash;here under the Southern
stars.... O Ulysses, truly that island was inhabited by one, Calypso;
but your thrall is to be briefer than your prototype's. See, now;
here is the road; and I release you to that not impossible she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is none&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There will be. You are very young. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"The confusing part of it to me," he said, smiling, "is to <em>see</em>
you so&mdash;so physically youthful with even a hint of almost childish
immaturity!&mdash;and then to <em>hear</em> you as you <em>are</em>&mdash;witty,
experienced, nicely cynical, maturely sure of yourself and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You think me experienced?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Sure of myself?"</p>

<p>"Of course; with your cool, amused poise, your absolute self-possession&mdash;and
the half-disdainful sword-play of your wit&mdash;at my expense&mdash;"</p>

<p>She halted beside the sea-wall, adorably mocking in her exaggerated
gravity.</p>

<p>"At your expense?" she repeated. "Why not? You have cost me something."</p>

<p>"You said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what I said: I said that we might become friends. But
even so, you have already cost me something. Tell me"&mdash;he began
to listen for this little trick of speech&mdash;"how many men do you
know who would not misunderstand what I have done this evening?
And&mdash;do <em>you</em> understand it, Mr. Hamil?"</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you do you are cleverer than I," she said almost listlessly,
moving on again under the royal palms.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes; that I myself don't entirely understand it. Here, under
this Southern sun, we of the North are in danger of acquiring
a sort of insouciant directness almost primitive. There comes,
after a while, a certain mental as well as physical luxury in
relaxation of rule and precept, permitting us a simplicity which
sometimes, I think, becomes something less harmless. There <em>is</em>
luxury in letting go of that live wire which keeps us all keyed
to one conventional monotone in the North. I let go&mdash;for a moment&mdash;to-night.
<em>You</em> let go when you said 'Calypso.' You couldn't have
said it in New York; I couldn't have heard you, there.... Alas,
Ulysses, I should not have heard you anywhere. But I did; and
I answered.... Say good night to me, now; won't you? We have not
been very wicked, I think."</p>

<p>She offered her hand; smooth and cool it lay for a second in
his.</p>

<p>"I can't let you return alone," he ventured.</p>

<p>"If you please, how am I to explain you to&mdash;the others?"</p>

<p>And as he said nothing:</p>

<p>"If I were&mdash;different &mdash;I'd simply tell them the truth.
I could afford to. Besides we'll all know you before very long.
Then we'll see&mdash;oh, yes, both of us&mdash;whether we have been foolishly
wise to become companions in our indiscretion, or&mdash;otherwise....
And don't worry about my home-arrival. That's my lawn&mdash;there where
that enormous rubber-banyan tree straddles across the stars....
Is it not quaint&mdash;the tangle of shrubbery all over jasmine?&mdash;and
those are royal poincianas, if you please&mdash;and there's a great
garden beyond and most delectable orange groves where you and
I and the family and Alonzo will wander and eat pine-oranges and
king-oranges and mandarins and&mdash;oh, well! Are you going to call
on Mr. Cardross to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I'll have to see Mr. Cardross at once. And after
that, what am I to do to meet you?"</p>

<p>"I will consider the matter," she said; and bending slightly
toward him: "Am I to be disappointed in you? I don't know, and
you can't tell me." Then, impulsively: "Be generous to me. You
are right; I am not very old, yet. Be nice to me in your thoughts.
I have never before done such a thing as this: I never could again.
It is not very dreadful&mdash;is it? Will you think nicely of me?"</p>

<p>He said gaily: "Now you speak as you look, not like a world-worn
woman of thirty wearing the soft, fresh mask of nineteen."</p>

<p>"You have not answered me," she said quietly.</p>

<p>"Answered you, Calypso?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I ask you to be very gentle and fastidious with me in your
thoughts; not even to call me Calypso&mdash;in your thoughts."</p>

<p>"What you ask I had given you the first moment we met."</p>

<p>"Then you <em>may</em> call me Calypso&mdash;in your thoughts."</p>

<p>"Calypso," he pleaded, "won't you tell me where to find you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; in the house of &mdash;Mr. Cardross. This is his house."</p>

<p>She turned and stepped onto the lawn. A mass of scarlet hibiscus
hid her, then she reappeared, a pale shape in the dusk of the
oleander-bordered path.</p>

<p>He listened; the perfume of the oleanders enveloped him; high
under the stars the fronds of a royal palm hung motionless. Then,
through the stillness, very far away, he heard the southern ocean
murmuring in its slumber under a million stars.</p>
