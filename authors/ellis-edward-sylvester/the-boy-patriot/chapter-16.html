<p>Weeks flew by while the Molly was cruising about, waiting and
watching for the expected East Indiaman. The privateer, meanwhile,
was not losing time. Several small merchant vessels came in her
way, and submitted without a blow to the argument of her compelling
pair of guns. These vessels were either stripped of their cargo
and then burnt, or else sent with a few sailors as their prize
crew to some American port. The capture of the British merchant
ships kept the Molly supplied with the necessaries for her continued
cruise, and served besides to calm the impatience of the men,
who were beginning to complain of their captain's pertinacious
clinging to the hope of taking the East Indiaman, which might
already be safely harbored in English waters. There had been dark
nights and foggy days in which she might well have passed them,
so they reasoned. But Derry Duck said there was no moving the
captain, and grumblers would do best to "keep their tongues between
their teeth." The mail-bag of the Molly had gone home on board
one of the captured vessels, and it was a pleasant thought to
Blair that his dear mother would soon feel almost as if she heard
the voice of her son at her side. Derry's little daughter too
would receive her letter, and Blair tried to picture her joy as
she held this treasure in her hands.</p>

<p>Derry moved about in his usual way, but was inclined to avoid
Blair since the night when he had given the boy his confidence.
Blair often found it hard to believe that those gentle, tender
tones had come from Derry's great closely shut mouth, and that
those snapping eyes had softened almost to tears as he spoke of
his darling child.</p>

<p>Sunday on board the Molly was precisely like other days, as far
as the movements and occupations of the men were concerned. To
Blair there was ever a more solemn stillness over the sea, and
a more imposing grandeur in the wide canopy of the overhanging
sky. One great temple it seemed to him, the sunlit waves its shining
floor, the firmament its arching roof, and the unseen angels the
countless worshippers, singing, "Praise and glory and honor be
unto the name of God most high." In this adoring song Blair heartily
joined, and he longed and prayed for the time to come when on
every white-winged ship there should be gathered the servants
of the Lord of sabaoth, rejoicing to call upon his holy name and
give him glory for all his wondrous works.</p>

<p>Absorbed in such thoughts as these, Blair was leaning over the
side of the ship one Sunday morning. Suddenly a strong voice close
at his side spoke with deep earnestness the words, "Bless the
Lord, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless his holy name."</p>

<p>Blair turned in astonishment, and saw Derry Duck close at his
side. Tears were coursing down those rough cheeks, and the almost
blinded eyes were lifted reverently upward, and silently spoke
the same language as the song of praise.</p>

<p>Blair's heart bounded. He could not be deceived. One of God's
great miracles of grace had been wrought. The devil had been cast
out, and the ransomed was giving God the glory. It must be so.</p>

<p>Blair seized the hand of his companion, and looking into his
face, said quickly, "Oh, Derry, are you really in earnest?"</p>

<p>"Bless the Lord, my soul, and forget not all his benefits: who
forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;
who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with
loving-kindness and tender mercies,'" continued Derry with deep
feeling. "He found me dead in trespasses and sins; he has given
me new life in Christ Jesus. Praise and honor unto his holy name."</p>

<p>Tears rushed to the eyes of Blair Robertson. A fervent "Thank
God!" was all he could utter. Blair's whole being did indeed "magnify
the Lord" at this wonderful evidence of his power. Curses had
been changed to praises. The blaspheming lips had been touched
by the Saviour's hand, and taught the language of the children
of God. His young servant could not but "stand in awe," and own
the might and the wonderful mercy of the King of kings.</p>

<p>Derry was the first to break the solemn silence. "Those words
never left me: 'Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be
white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be
as wool,'" he said. "They stuck to me, and rang in my ears and
searched every nook and cranny of my wicked heart. Often I had
longed to be a Christian man for the little dear's sake, if not
for my own; but I said to myself, 'No, Derry Duck, you are all
pitch, you can't be made white;' and Satan helped me to hold on
to that way of thinking. Your scripture gave the lie again and
again to that. It seemed to say to me, <em>You</em> choose blackness
and damnation, when God asks you to wash and be clean. What I've
suffered these weeks, no soul out of perdition can tell. The devil
clung to me. He would not let me go. He claimed me for his own.
He told over to me my dark, hidden sins, and taunted me that I
had gone too far to go back now. He hissed in my ear that no power
could cleanse and save such as me. Then came up the words, 'With
God all things are possible,' 'Though your sins be as scarlet,
they shall be white as snow.' 'Christ Jesus came into the world
to save <em>sinners</em>.' And he has saved <em>me</em>. I am
<em>His</em>. He has given me a mouth to praise him. O Blair,
think of his wonderful mercy, to take poor wicked Derry Duck into
the kingdom of heaven."</p>

<p>The boy's heart throbbed and swelled with joy and praise. What
was the changing of water to wine, or the calming of the stormy
sea, compared to this marvellous miracle wrought in a living human
soul? "He to whom much is forgiven, loveth much," said our blessed
Saviour; and in Derry this truth was abundantly verified. The
Christ whose blood could wash such as he, was a Lord for whom
he was willing to suffer even unto death. The mercy that could
stoop to ransom such a transgressor, claimed an affection before
which poor Derry's deep love for his earthly darling paled, as
the things of time fade into insignificance before the things
of eternity.</p>

<p>Blair had longed to see his rude shipmates forsaking their sins;
he had prayed and wrestled in prayer for them. Yet now, when he
saw the work begun before his eyes, he felt the faithlessness
of those very prayers, and knew that they could have won no fulfilment,
but for the merits of the great Intercessor in whose name they
had ever been offered.</p>

<p>"Why should it be thought a thing incredible to you that God
should raise the dead?" This question of the apostle comes with
power to the Christians of our own day. Do you really believe
it <em>possible</em> for God to raise to newness of life the dead
in trespasses and sins? There is no soul so hardened that it cannot
be melted to penitence by the touch of the mighty Spirit of God.
Let this thought make us fervent, importunate, instant in prayer
for the souls that are at death's door and hasting to destruction.</p>

<p>Can any thing but the power of God make the moral man, once proud
of his own uprightness, humble as the little child, leaning only
on the cross of Christ for salvation? He who works this wonder
can do yet more. What are the sins and self-will of the human
heart, in comparison with the might of the majesty of Jehovah?
He who laid the strong foundations of the earth, and led forth
the marshalled millions of the stars in their wonderful order,
can mould and fashion the soul of man at his will. Let us not
stand doubting, timid, and faint-hearted, discouraged by the foul
sins which blot and efface in man the fair image of his Maker.
Let us rather "come boldly to the throne of grace," and plead
through the great Intercessor for every wanderer from the right
path, and specially and perseveringly for those dear ones of our
own households, who, like the prodigal, have left the Father's
house, to be in misery and want in sin's far foreign land.</p>
