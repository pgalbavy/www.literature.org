<p>Towards sunset the fair itself became quiescent. It was the hour
for the dancing to begin. At one side of the village of tents
a space had been roped off. Acetylene lamps, hung round it on
posts, cast a piercing white light. In one corner sat the band,
and, obedient to its scraping and blowing, two or three hundred
dancers trampled across the dry ground, wearing away the grass
with their booted feet. Round this patch of all but daylight,
alive with motion and noise, the night seemed preternaturally
dark. Bars of light reached out into it, and every now and then
a lonely figure or a couple of lovers, interlaced, would cross
the bright shaft, flashing for a moment into visible existence,
to disappear again as quickly and surprisingly as they had come.</p>

<p>Denis stood by the entrance of the enclosure, watching the swaying,
shuffling crowd. The slow vortex brought the couples round and
round again before him, as though he were passing them in review.
There was Priscilla, still wearing her queenly toque, still encouraging
the villagers&mdash;this time by dancing with one of the tenant farmers.
There was Lord Moleyn, who had stayed on to the disorganised,
passoverish meal that took the place of dinner on this festal
day; he one-stepped shamblingly, his bent knees more precariously
wobbly than ever, with a terrified village beauty. Mr. Scogan
trotted round with another. Mary was in the embrace of a young
farmer of heroic proportions; she was looking up at him, talking,
as Denis could see, very seriously. What about? he wondered. The
Malthusian League, perhaps. Seated in the corner among the band,
Jenny was performing wonders of virtuosity upon the drums. Her
eyes shone, she smiled to herself. A whole subterranean life seemed
to be expressing itself in those loud rat-tats, those long rolls
and flourishes of drumming. Looking at her, Denis ruefully remembered
the red notebook; he wondered what sort of a figure he was cutting
now. But the sight of Anne and Gombauld swimming past &mdash;Anne
with her eyes almost shut and sleeping, as it were, on the sustaining
wings of movement and music&mdash;dissipated these preoccupations.
Male and female created He them...There they were, Anne and Gombauld,
and a hundred couples more&mdash;all stepping harmoniously together
to the old tune of Male and Female created He them. But Denis
sat apart; he alone lacked his complementary opposite. They were
all coupled but he; all but he...</p>

<p>Somebody touched him on the shoulder and he looked up. It was
Henry Wimbush.</p>

<p>"I never showed you our oaken drainpipes," he said. "Some of
the ones we dug up are lying quite close to here. Would you like
to come and see them?"</p>

<p>Denis got up, and they walked off together into the darkness.
The music grew fainter behind them. Some of the higher notes faded
out altogether. Jenny’s drumming and the steady sawing of the
bass throbbed on, tuneless and meaningless in their ears. Henry
Wimbush halted.</p>

<p>"Here we are," he said, and, taking an electric torch out of
his pocket, he cast a dim beam over two or three blackened sections
of tree trunk, scooped out into the semblance of pipes, which
were lying forlornly in a little depression in the ground.</p>

<p>"Very interesting," said Denis, with a rather tepid enthusiasm.</p>

<p>They sat down on the grass. A faint white glare, rising from
behind a belt of trees, indicated the position of the dancing-floor.
The music was nothing but a muffled rhythmic pulse.</p>

<p>"I shall be glad," said Henry Wimbush, "when this function comes
at last to an end."</p>

<p>"I can believe it."</p>

<p>"I do not know how it is," Mr. Wimbush continued, "but the spectacle
of numbers of my fellow-creatures in a state of agitation moves
in me a certain weariness, rather than any gaiety or excitement.
The fact is, they don’t very much interest me. They’re aren’t
in my line. You follow me? I could never take much interest, for
example, in a collection of postage stamps. Primitives or seventeenth-century
books&mdash;yes. They are my line. But stamps, no. I don’t know anything
about them; they’re not my line. They don’t interest me, they
give me no emotion. It’s rather the same with people, I’m afraid.
I’m more at home with these pipes."  He jerked his head sideways
towards the hollowed logs. "The trouble with the people and events
of the present is that you never know anything about them. What
do I know of contemporary politics? Nothing. What do I know of
the people I see round about me? Nothing. What they think of me
or of anything else in the world, what they will do in five minutes’
time, are things I can’t guess at. For all I know, you may suddenly
jump up and try to murder me in a moment’s time."</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Denis.</p>

<p>"True," Mr. Wimbush continued, "the little I know about your
past is certainly reassuring. But I know nothing of your present,
and neither you nor I know anything of your future. It’s appalling;
in living people, one is dealing with unknown and unknowable quantities.
One can only hope to find out anything about them by a long series
of the most disagreeable and boring human contacts, involving
a terrible expense of time. It’s the same with current events;
how can I find out anything about them except by devoting years
to the most exhausting first-hand study, involving once more an
endless number of the most unpleasant contacts? No, give me the
past. It doesn’t change; it’s all there in black and white, and
you can get to know about it comfortably and decorously and, above
all, privately&mdash;by reading. By reading I know a great deal of
Caesar Borgia, of St. Francis, of Dr. Johnson; a few weeks have
made me thoroughly acquainted with these interesting characters,
and I have been spared the tedious and revolting process of getting
to know them by personal contact, which I should have to do if
they were living now. How gay and delightful life would be if
one could get rid of all the human contacts! Perhaps, in the future,
when machines have attained to a state of perfection&mdash;for I confess
that I am, like Godwin and Shelley, a believer in perfectibility,
the perfectibility of machinery&mdash;then, perhaps, it will be possible
for those who, like myself, desire it, to live in a dignified
seclusion, surrounded by the delicate attentions of silent and
graceful machines, and entirely secure from any human intrusion.
It is a beautiful thought."</p>

<p>"Beautiful," Denis agreed. "But what about the desirable human
contacts, like love and friendship?"</p>

<p>The black silhouette against the darkness shook its head. "The
pleasures even of these contacts are much exaggerated," said the
polite level voice. "It seems to me doubtful whether they are
equal to the pleasures of private reading and contemplation. Human
contacts have been so highly valued in the past only because reading
was not a common accomplishment and because books were scarce
and difficult to reproduce. The world, you must remember, is only
just becoming literate. As reading becomes more and more habitual
and widespread, an ever-increasing number of people will discover
that books will give them all the pleasures of social life and
none of its intolerable tedium. At present people in search of
pleasure naturally tend to congregate in large herds and to make
a noise; in future their natural tendency will be to seek solitude
and quiet. The proper study of mankind is books."</p>

<p>"I sometimes think that it may be," said Denis; he was wondering
if Anne and Gombauld were still dancing together.</p>

<p>"Instead of which," said Mr. Wimbush, with a sigh, "I must go
and see if all is well on the dancing-floor." They got up and
began to walk slowly towards the white glare. "If all these people
were dead," Henry Wimbush went on, "this festivity would be extremely
agreeable. Nothing would be pleasanter than to read in a well-written
book of an open-air ball that took place a century ago. How charming!
one would say; how pretty and how amusing! But when the ball takes
place to-day, when one finds oneself involved in it, then one
sees the thing in its true light. It turns out to be merely this."
He waved his hand in the direction of the acetylene flares. "In
my youth," he went on after a pause, "I found myself, quite fortuitously,
involved in a series of the most phantasmagorical amorous intrigues.
A novelist could have made his fortune out of them, and even if
I were to tell you, in my bald style, the details of these adventures,
you would be amazed at the romantic tale. But I assure you, while
they were happening&mdash;these romantic adventures&mdash;they seemed to
me no more and no less exciting than any other incident of actual
life. To climb by night up a rope-ladder to a second-floor window
in an old house in Toledo seemed to me, while I was actually performing
this rather dangerous feat, an action as obvious, as much to be
taken for granted, as&mdash;how shall I put it?&mdash;as quotidian as catching
the 8.52 from Surbiton to go to business on a Monday morning.
Adventures and romance only take on their adventurous and romantic
qualities at second-hand. Live them, and they are just a slice
of life like the rest. In literature they become as charming as
this dismal ball would be if we were celebrating its tercentenary."
They had come to the entrance of the enclosure and stood there,
blinking in the dazzling light. "Ah, if only we were!" Henry Wimbush
added.</p>

<p>Anne and Gombauld were still dancing together.</p>
