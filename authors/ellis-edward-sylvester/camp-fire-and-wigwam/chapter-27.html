<p>Naturally enough, when Jack Carleton found himself standing close
to the frolicking Indian boys on the clearing, he became interested
in the game they were playing, which he saw was systematic, and
in which all took part.</p>

<p>Like amusements of that sort, it was simple in its character
and he quickly caught its drift. The boys divided themselves into
two parties equal in numbers, one of which was ranged in line
at the right of the clearing near the wood, while the other did
the same at the other goal, which was a stump close to the stream.
Each boy held a stick with a forked end in his hand, that being
the implement with which the game is played.</p>

<p>When all was ready, one of the youthful Sauks walked out from
the party near the woods, holding the stick with the crotch of
a small branch supported at the point of bifurcation. This crotch
was four or five inches in length, and as it was carried aloft,
it looked like an inverted V, raised high so that all might see
it.</p>

<p>Pausing in the middle of the clearing, the dusky lad with a flirt
of the stick, flung the crotch a dozen feet in air and uttered
a shout which was echoed by every one of the waiting players.
Both sides made a furious rush toward the middle of the playground,
where they came together like two mountain torrents, and the fun
began. The strife was to get the crotch of wood to one of the
goals, and each side fought as strenuously to help it along toward
his own, as a side of foot-ball players struggle to do the opposite
in a rough and tumble fight for the college championship.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the only helps to be employed were the long, forked
sticks carried in their hands, it will be seen that the game offered
a boundless field for the roughest sort of play, mingled with
no little dexterity and skill. Some swarthy-hued rascal, while
on a dead run, would thrust the point of his stick under the crotch,
and lifting it high above his head, start or rather continue with
might and main toward his goal. At that time, as, indeed, at every
minute, each young American was literally yelling like so many
"wild Indians." Desperately as the youth ran, others more fleet
of foot speedily overtook him, and one, reaching forward while
going like a deer, lifted the crotch from the other stick, and
circling gracefully about, sped for his own goal. But some youth
at his heels leaped in air and with a sweep of his own stick struck
the other and sent the crotch spinning and doubling through the
air. A dozen other sticks were plunged after it, but it fell to
the ground, and then the fight reached its climax. The parties
became one wild, desperate, shouting, yelling, scrambling mob.
Legs and arms seemed to be flying everywhere, and the wonder was
that a score of limbs and necks were not broken. But it rarely
hurts a boy to become hurt, and though bruises were plenty, no
one suffered serious harm. After a few minutes' struggle, the
crotch would be seen perched on the stick of one of the boys,
who, fighting his way through the mob, ran with astonishing speed,
with friends and foes converging upon him, and the certainty that
he would be tripped and sent flying heels over head, before he
could reach safety.</p>

<p>After awhile, when the prize had been gradually worked toward
the goal of the stronger party, some youth, by a piece of skill
and daring, would make a dash for home and bear down all opposition.
It followed, of course, that his side had won, and, after a brief
rest, the game was renewed and pressed with the same vigor as
before.</p>

<p>This Indian boy's game is still played by many Indian tribes.
Among the Senecas it is called "Gah-haw-ge," and I make no doubt
that more than one reader of these pages has witnessed the exciting
amusement, which so thrilled the blood of Jack Carleton that he
could hardly restrain himself from taking part in the fun. But
he had no crotched stick, without which he would have been a cypher,
and then, as he had never attempted the game, he knew he possessed
no skill. The venture would have been rash, for in the excited
state of the Indian youths, and armed as they were with sticks,
it is almost certain that at some stage of the game they would
have turned on the pale face and beaten him to death.</p>

<p>The rough amusement lasted fully two hours, during which Jack
Carleton and many of the warriors were interested spectators.
At last the youngsters became weary and the sport ended. As the
stumpy youths straggled apart, the perspiration on their faces
caused them to shine like burnished copper. All at once one of
them emitted a whoop and broke into a swift run, the rest instantly
falling in behind him, and speeding with the same hilarious jollity.</p>

<p>The heart of Jack Carleton stood still, for the leading Indian
was coming straight toward him.</p>

<p>"They're aiming for me," was his conclusion, as he gripped the
handle of his knife and half drew it from his girdle.</p>

<p>But the whooping youth swerved a little to the right, and was
ten feet away from the terrified captive when he dashed by with
unabated speed. He did not so much as glance at Jack, nor did
the procession of screeching, bobbing moon-faces, as they streamed
past, give him the least attention.</p>

<p>The lad who set off with the lead, kept it up with undiminished
speed, until he reached the edge of the river. Then he made a
leap high upward and outward. Jack saw the crouching figure, with
the head bent forward, the arms crooked at the elbow, and the
legs doubled at the knees, during the single breath that it seemed
suspended in the air. Then describing a beautiful parabola, he
descended, and striking the water, sent the spray flying in every
direction, while the body went to the bottom. The others followed,
so fast that the dusky forms dropped like hailstones, tumbled
over each other, splashed, dove, frolicked, shouted, and acted
with the same abandon as before.</p>

<p>It is by such sports and training that the American Indian acquires
his fleetness, high health, and powers of endurance.</p>

<p>But Jack had grown weary of watching the antics of the youngsters,
and turned about and walked homeward. He saw from the position
of the sun that it was near noon, and he was hungry; but he was
more impressed by the change of treatment since his last affray
than by anything else. He walked past five separate wigwams before
reaching the imperial residence, which for the time being was
his own. There were warriors, girls, and squaws lounging near
each one. They raised their repellant faces and looked at the
captive with no little curiosity, but offered him no harm.</p>

<p>When half way home, the flapping door of one of the conical wigwams
was pushed aside, and the stooping figure of a large Indian boy
straightened up and walked toward Jack, who, with an odd feeling,
recognized him as the youth whom he had overthrown in wrestling,
and afterwards knocked off his feet by a blow in the face.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether he means to attack me?" Jack asked himself,
in doubt for the moment as to what he should do. At first he thought
he would turn aside so as to give the young Sauk plenty of room;
but that struck him as impolitic, for it would show cowardice.</p>

<p>"No, I won't give him an inch; he is alone, and if he wants another
row, I'm agreeable."</p>

<p>It was hard for Jack to restrain a smile when he looked at the
face of the Indian. It was exceptionally repulsive in the first
place, but the violent blow on the nose had caused that organ
to assume double its original proportion, and there was a puffy,
bulbous look about the whole countenance which showed how strongly
it "sympathized" with the injured part.</p>

<p>Although the American Indian, as a rule, can go a long time,
like the eagle, without winking his eyes, this youth was obliged
to keep up a continual blinking, which added to his grotesque
appearance, as with shoulders thrown back and a sidelong scowl
he strode toward the river. Jack returned the scowl with interest,
and it scarcely need be said that the two did not speak as they
passed by.</p>

<p>Feeling some fear of treachery, the captive kept his ears open,
and watched over his shoulder until he reached his own wigwam,
where he stood for a moment and gazed in the direction of the
river, which was partly shut out by one of the intervening lodges.
He was just in time to see the young Sauk of the battered countenance
leap into the river, where, doubtless, he was able to do much
toward reducing the inflammation of his organ of smell.</p>

<p>When the captive entered his home as it may be called, he saw
the chieftain stretched flat on his back and snoring frightfully.
The dog was asleep on the other side the fire, and the squaw,
after toiling so long in the "corn field," was preparing the mid-day
meal. She was a type of her sex as found among the aborigines,
as her husband, even though a monarch, was a type of the lazy
vagabond known as the American warrior.</p>

<p>At the side of the queen lay the gourd which usually contained
water. Peeping into the round hole of the upper side, she shook
the utensil, and the few drops within jingled like silver. She
snatched it up, looked toward Jack, and grunted and nodded her
head. If the lad could not understand the language of the visitor
sometime before, he had no such difficulty in the case of the
squaw. With real eagerness he sprang forward and hastened out
of the wigwam to procure what was needed.</p>

<p>The one visit which he made the spring in the morning had rendered
him familiar with the route, and it took but a minute or two for
him to fill the gourd and start on his return. He found that a
number of young girls had followed him, and were at his heels
all the way back; but, though they talked a good deal about him,
and displayed as much curiosity as their brothers, they did not
molest him. Once, when they ventured rather too close, Jack whipped
out his knife, raised it on high, and made a leap at them, expanding
his eyes to their widest extent, and shouting in his most terrifying
tone, "Boo!"</p>

<p>It produced the effect desired. The young frights scattered with
screams of terror, and hardly ventured to peep out of their homes
at the ogre striding by.</p>

<p>When Jack entered the lodge he found Ogallah awake. Evidently
he was not in good humor, for his manner showed he was scolding
his much better half, who accepted it all without reply or notice.
No doubt she received it as part of the inevitable.</p>

<p>The chief, however, refrained from following the civilized custom
of beating the wife, and when the meat and a species of boiled
greens were laid on the block of wood which answered for a table,
his ill-mood seemed to have passed, and he ate with his usual
relish and enjoyment.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton crossed his legs like a tailor at his side of the
board, but before he could eat a mouthful a violent nausea seized
him, his head swam, and he was on the verge of fainting. Ogallah
and his squaw noticed his white face and looked wonderingly at
him.</p>

<p>"I'm very ill!" gasped Jack, springing to his feet, staggering
a few steps, and then lunging forward on the bison skin, where
he flung himself down like one without hope.</p>

<p>The violence of the attack quickly subsided, but there remained
a faintness which drove away every particle of appetite, and it
was well that such was the case, for had he taken any food in
his condition the result must have been serious.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the squaw had assumed her place at the table by her
liege lord, and both were champing their meal as though time was
limited, and there was no call to feel any interest in the poor
boy who lay on his rude couch, well assured that his last illness
was upon him.</p>

<p>"What do they care for <em>me</em>?" muttered Jack, his fright
yielding to a feeling of resentment, as the violence of the attack
subsided. "I wonder that they spared my life so long. They would
have been more merciful had they slain me in the woods as they
did Otto, instead of bringing me here to be tormented to death,
and as I know they mean to do with me."</p>

<p>Lying on his arm, he glared at the couple with a revengeful feeling
that was extraordinary under the circumstances. A morbid conviction
fastened itself upon him that Ogallah had taken him to his lodge
for the purpose of keeping him until he was in the best physical
condition, when he would subject him to a series of torturing
and fatal ceremonies for the amusement of the entire village.</p>

<p>In the middle of these remarkable sensations exhausted nature
succumbed, and the captive fell asleep.</p>
