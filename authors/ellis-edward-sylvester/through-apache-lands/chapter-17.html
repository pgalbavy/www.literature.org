<p>For a couple of hours young Chadmund had difficulty in traveling.
Despite the fact that he was in a sort of valley, with towering
peaks and bluffs upon either hand, a great many boulders and obstructions
obtruded themselves in his path, and he did some climbing, clambering,
and jumping that would have reflected no discredit upon a mountain
goat. The forenoon was about half gone, and he was felicitating
himself upon the excellent progress he was making, when he was
brought up all standing by finding himself upon the bank of a
mountain stream, which crossed his route exactly at right angles,
issuing from the mountains on the left with a rush and roar and
pouring tumultuously forward with irresistible power and velocity.</p>

<p>"I can't wade that," said the lad, scratching his head in perplexity,
"and it won't do to try and swim it. If I once got in there it
would be the last of me."</p>

<p>There could be no doubt of that, for the stream was fully twenty
feet in width, very deep, and sped forward like the volume of
a river when suddenly compressed into a mountain canyon. It was
walled in on either side by solid rock, the surface of the water
being a couple of yards below the level where he stood.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether I can't go round it?" he said, after spending
some time in mental debate. "It can't run all the way through
the mountain, but must start somewhere not very far away."</p>

<p>This was not a very plausible theory; but as nothing was to be
gained by standing still, he started out upon his tour of exploration.
Better success followed than he expected. He had started toward
the head of the stream and had clambered along less than a hundred
yards, when he reached a place where it was so narrow that he
was confident of his ability to leap across.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can do that," he said, approaching close to the edge
and looking over the boiling abyss to the solid rock upon the
other side. "But suppose I should miss my footing, wouldn't I
catch it!"</p>

<p>It was a pretty good leap, but Ned was active, strong and swift,
and he had made many a longer leap than the one before him. For
a minute longer he stood, measuring the distance with his eye.
Then going backward a few steps, he suddenly ran forward with
all the speed at his command, and, concentrating all his strength,
made such a leap that he cleared the chasm by a couple of feet.</p>

<p>"There!" he exclaimed, with some satisfaction, "if none of the
streams are broader than that, I'll jump them all."</p>

<p>Still full of hope and in the best of spirits he pressed forward
until the sun was at the meridian and the heat became so oppressive
that he concluded to rest awhile. He was in a section of country
where, at certain seasons, the heat is like that of the Desert
of Sahara. There are portions of Arizona and Lower California
where the fervor of the sun's rays at noonday smite the earth
with the withering power of the sirocco.</p>

<p>At times, when Ned was down in the lowest portions of the valley,
the heat was almost intolerable; and then, again, when he clambered
to the top of some elevation, and the cool breezes from the upper
regions fanned his cheeks, it was like a draught of water to the
fever-parched patient.</p>

<p>He had lain on the ground under the protecting shadow of a rock
but a short time when his eye rested upon something which convinced
him that he was not the only one in the valley. Looking dreamily
off toward the west, up the valley, with the mountains sloping
down on the right and left, he noticed what at first seemed a
thin bluish cloud, resting against the sky. Then he observed that
its form was a little out of the usual order, it being column-shaped,
tall, and like a shaft of almost invisible vapor, thrown against
the white background beyond.</p>

<p>"That ain't a cloud," he suddenly exclaimed, starting to his
feet and scrutinizing it more closely. "It's the smoke from a
camp fire and I've got to go right by it."</p>

<p>There could be no doubt of the truth of what he said, and he
became deeply interested.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether they're Indians or white men? I suppose it's
most likely they are Apaches, and they may be Lone Wolf and his
companions. I've got to keep a sharp lookout and keep from running
into them. If they are white hunters, that I've heard are sometimes
in these mountains, it will be a lucky thing for me."</p>

<p>Somehow or other he became impressed with the idea that the camp
fire ahead of him was that of friends instead of enemies&mdash;that
the assistance which he so sorely needed was thus placed within
his reach. He had learned, long before, that one is apt to miscalculate
the distance when placed as he was; but, making allowance for
all that, he was confident that the camp fire was not more than
a mile away. Yielding to a natural curiosity to learn its meaning,
he shortened the hour which he had intended to devote to rest,
and started ahead again.</p>

<p>Once or twice it seemed to him that he had dropped into some
sort of trail, which he was following. Here and there were traces
showing that the route had been traveled before. It seemed to
be one of those natural roads or passes which are found at intervals
in all great mountain chains, and without which, many of of them
for vast distances would be literally impassable for man or animal.</p>

<p>The conviction that he was not the pioneer over that section
caused the young wanderer some misgivings and suggested several
discomforting questions. If Apaches had used the trail already,
might not some of them be upon it? If some of them were coming
from the opposite direction, how was he to avoid running into
their arms? These queries were not of the most cheerful character
and they served to tone down the enthusiasm which had marked his
start in the morning. They also caused him to examine, more times
than was really necessary, the revolver which had already done
him such good service, and he went through a preliminary drill,
consisting of placing it inside his waistcoat, a couple of buttons
being left carelessly unfastened; next thrusting his hand within,
in an indifferent manner, then instantly jerking out and pointing
the weapon at an imaginary foe in front of him. This maneuver
he repeated scores of times, narrowly escaping the firing of the
weapon, until he satisfied himself that he could do it to perfection.</p>

<p>"Now, if Lone Wolf comes at me alone, I think I can manage him.
He won't suspect that I've any weapon, and so won't be prepared
for it; but I hope he won't show himself," he added the next minute.
"If there's any way of avoiding him, I'll do it."</p>

<p>However, he was bent upon solving the mystery of the distant
camp fire, which he still hoped might belong to some party of
white hunters, who would take him under their protection and conduct
him safely over the wide and dangerous stretch of territory which
still intervened between him and his destination.</p>

<p>In spite of the careful calculation he had made, he soon learned
that he had committed an error. Although the tell-tale smoke at
first seemed scarcely a mile away, it was more than three times
that distance. The way being more obstructed by rocks and the
sinuous winding of the trail, he saw the sun sinking low in the
west and found that he had still no little traveling to do.</p>

<p>"It can't be that they are shifting that camp fire all the time,"
he growled, as he clambered upon an elevation, and was again disappointed
to find it so far away. "Blamed if it don't look as if somebody
was playing a trick on me. I've heard of a jack-o'-lantern bobbing
around in that style, but nothing else."</p>

<p>He finally concluded that the laws of nature were not violated
in this case, and with renewed courage pressed ahead again. The
sky was clear and cloudless, the weather remained oppressively
warm, and poor Ned was so jaded that he felt scarcely able to
drag one foot after the other, but he was stout-hearted, and,
just as the sun dipped out of sight behind the mountains, he found
himself within a hundred yards of the mysterious camp.</p>
