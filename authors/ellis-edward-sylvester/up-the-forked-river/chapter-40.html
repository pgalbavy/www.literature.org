<p>Major Jack Starland flashed up the glass and studied the other
craft.</p>

<p>"By Jove! you are right; where do you suppose they came from,
Dick?"</p>

<p>"The General must have established communication with his friends
soon after we left him; he certainly has a strong crew."</p>

<p>"That means he intends to attack us; it looks as if there is
to be a naval battle between an American yacht and the navy of
the Atlamalcan Republic."</p>

<p>It was Miss Starland who said this without a trace of excitement,
and as if the impending struggle was of only passing interest.</p>

<p>"She is right," observed the mate; "it is hard to tell which
has the advantage with one crippled and the other hard aground."</p>

<p>"They will wait till night and then come at us in their small
boats. As nearly as I can make out, they have all of twenty men
on board. What is your opinion, Miss Starland?"</p>

<p>She pointed the glass again for several minutes before replying:</p>

<p>"There are nearer forty, for it is certain that some are keeping
out of sight. I suppose they are well armed, and it seems to me
we are in a bad situation."</p>

<p>"There's no denying it," remarked her brother with a grave face;
"they will wait till night and then dash upon us from several
sides at the same time; the hour or two before the moon rises
will be their opportunity."</p>

<p>"But why," was the natural feminine inquiry, "does General Yozarro
molest us? He has always claimed to be your friend, and, until
today, has treated us both with courtesy. What pretext can he
offer for his course?"</p>

<p>"While there is little in his excuse, it will doubtless be that
the owner of this yacht captured his flimsy tug which he persists
in calling a gunboat, or rather that I stole it, for which offence
he means to punish me."</p>

<p>"Will he not in the end have to reckon with our government?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he must first reckon with <em>us</em>; the affair is
a ridiculous one in which to involve the United States, and I
shall not feel proud of my part, if forced to make the appeal;
but General Yozarro will find it is no child's play in which he
engages when he attacks us. We have not a very full supply of
small arms on board, but we shall make things lively for him."</p>

<p>When night closed in, the relative position of the two craft
was unchanged. Every possible preparation was made on the yacht,
for there could be no doubt of the hostile intentions of the Atlamalcans.
A small boat was seen to leave its side and pass to the southern
shore. Followed through the glasses, it disclosed two seamen swaying
the oars, but when it returned after a brief absence, it held
six passengers. The crew of the crippled tug was fast growing
and General Yozarro had certainly made good use of his time.</p>

<p>The twelve-pounder of the <em>Warrenia</em> was loaded to the
muzzle. Six rifles were distributed among the men, several of
whom had revolvers and all knives. Lookouts were placed at all
points. The conviction was that during the brief period of gloom
before the rising of the moon, two or three or possibly more small
boats, crowded with armed men, would dash simultaneously upon
the grounded craft and strive desperately to board her.</p>

<p>The sanguinary fight that impended, with the certain loss of
life on both sides, could be averted by a surrender, which calm
judgment would have justified under the peculiar circumstances,
but it was not strange that even Miss Starland and Aunt Cynthia
hinted nothing of that nature. As for the officers and crew, they
eagerly awaited the conflict with a band whom they despised. Although
greatly outnumbered, not one doubted their ability to repel the
attempt to board. There was only one condition that they would
have changed; that was the presence of the ladies. They could
be safeguarded during the fight, but it would have been better
had they been far away. Such absence, however, was impossible
and no one referred to it.</p>

<p>But the naval battle never took place. When all the defenders
were alert and on edge, it was observed that the yacht was floating.
The disappointment was felt keenly even by the bellicose cook.
There was a general peering into the gloom in the hope of discerning
the approaching boats, and a sigh when they failed to appear.</p>

<p>"It sometimes takes more courage to run away than to fight,"
said Major Starland with a laugh; "therefore we shall run away."</p>

<p>He called his orders to Captain Winton, who, having shaken off
the clutch of the mud, turned the prow of the craft so as to flank
the obstruction, and signalled the engineer to go ahead at moderate
speed. At the same time, he sent out a reverberating blast from
the whistle, which the Atlamalcans might accept as a parting salute.</p>

<p>The yacht steamed carefully down the river, and in the early
hours of the morning passed Zalapata, where a few lights twinkled,
and then proceeded toward the more pretentious town of San Luis.
The only ones awake on the <em>Warrenia</em> were those whose
duties required them to be alert, and Captain Winton, knowing
that General Bambos was absent, held the whistle mute as he went
by.</p>

<p>If the yacht <em>Warrenia</em> and its crew and passengers had
been called upon to pass through a series of stirring incidents
while in tropical America, a rare and most gratifying experience
now came to them. The weather remained calm and the run to the
southern extremity of the continent was as smooth and tranquil
as it had been across the Caribbean Sea. When the neighborhood
of Cape Horn was reached, Major Starland, in order to keep his
pledge with his father, took the wheel. Captain Winton lit his
pipe, sat down in the pilot house and grimly waited until his
services were necessary.</p>

<p>But not for an hour were they required, except now and then,
in the way of simple relief. He had passed that danger region
more than once, but never had he seen it so free of storm and
rough weather. There was not a single moment when the yacht was
in the slightest danger. In fact, to emphasize the wonderful,
summer-like calmness of those usually turbulent waters, which
are the dread of veteran navigators, Miss Starland held the spokes
of the wheel for several hours. Such good fortune is not likely
to come to a navigator once in a score of times.</p>

<p>When the yacht steamed out of the wide mouth of the Amazon and
headed southward, the assumed relationship between Major Starland
and his "sister" was dropped. There was no call to keep it up,
since every one on board knew the truth.</p>

<p>The <em>Warrenia</em> was well up the western coast of South
America and steaming rapidly toward the city of the Golden Gate.
Hardly a breath of air rippled the bright waters, and the sky
overhead was brilliant with its myriads of stars, whose gleam
was intensified in the soft crystalline atmosphere.</p>

<p>Major Starland was seated on a camp chair, where he and Miss
Rowland were sheltered from the wind created by the motion of
the yacht. She hardly needed the gaudily-colored zarape wrapped
about her shoulders. They had been talking of their strange experiences,
of Manuela Estacardo, of Captain Ortega and of those whose memories
were much less pleasant.</p>

<p>You can imagine the trend of that low, delightful conversation,
for the scene, the surroundings, the time, indeed all the circumstances
tended to draw them closer. What was said was too sacred in its
nature, for us to quote in full: the conclusion is enough.</p>

<p>"Warrenia, you have played the sister for some weeks to perfection.
You must have become accustomed to hearing yourself called 'Miss
Starland;' it certainly has a familiar sound by this time."</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, ceasing her efforts to disengage her hand
from the fingers that had made it prisoner; "it could not well
be otherwise. You know there is quite a similarity in our names."</p>

<p>"What I wish to ask, Sweetheart, is whether you will not agree
to make a slight change in the term by which you were addressed
so long."</p>

<p>"In what way?" she asked, as if she did not know what was coming.</p>

<p>"Instead of being 'Miss Starland,' will you not consent that
your correct name shall be 'Mrs. Starland?'"</p>

<p>At first she begged for time in which to consider the proposition,
but Jack was always headlong and presumptuous, as you know, and
he insisted, and what could she do but consent? And among all
the friends the two most pleased were "Teddy" Rowland and his
partner, Tom Starland, when they heard the good news.</p>
