<p>"Will they do anything for us?" repeated Carfax.</p>

<p>The staff officer thought it very doubtful. He stood in the snow
switching his wet puttees and looking out across a world of tumbled
mountains. Over on his right lay Germany; on his left, France;
Switzerland towered in ice behind him against an arctic blue sky.</p>

<p>It grew warm on the Falcon Peak, almost hot in the sun. Snow
was melting on black heaps of rocks; a black salamander, swollen,
horrible, stirred from its stiff lethargy and crawled away blindly
across the snow.</p>

<p>"Our case is this," continued Carfax; "somebody’s made a mistake.
We’ve been forgotten. And if they don’t relieve us rather soon
some of us will go off our bally nuts. Do you get me, Major?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Do you understand what I’ve been saying?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; quite so."</p>

<p>"Then ask yourself, Major, how long can four men stand it, cooped
up here on this peak? A month, two months, three, five? But it’s
going on ten months&mdash;ten months of solitude&mdash;silence&mdash;not a sound,
except when the snowslides go bellowing off into Alsace down there
below our feet." His bronzed lip quivered. "I’ll get aboard one
if this keeps on."</p>

<p>He kicked a lump of ice off into space; the staff officer glanced
at him and looked away hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Carfax with an effort; "we’re not regulars&mdash;not
like the others. The Canadian division is different. Its discipline
is different&mdash;in spite of Salisbury Plain and K. of K. In my regiment
there are half-breeds, pelt-hunters, Nome miners, Yankees of all
degrees, British, Canadians, gentlemen adventurers from Cosmopolis.
They’re good soldiers, but do you think they’d stay here? It is
so in the Athabasca Battalion; it is the same in every battalion.
They wouldn’t stay here ten months. They couldn’t. We are free
people; we can’t stand indefinite caging; we’ve got to have walking
room once every few months."</p>

<p>The staff officer murmured something.</p>

<p>"I know; but good God, man! Four of us have been on this peak
for nearly ten months. We’ve never seen a Boche, never heard a
shot. Seasons come and go, rain falls, snow falls, the winds blow
from the Alps, but nothing else comes to us except a half-frozen
bird or two."</p>

<p>The staff officer looked about him with an involuntary shiver.
There was nothing to see except the sun on the wet, black rocks
and the whitewashed observation station of solid stone from which
wires sagged into the valley on the French side.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;good luck," he said hastily, looking as embarrassed as
he felt. "I’ll be toddling along."</p>

<p>"Will you say a word to the General, like a good chap? Tell him
how it is with us&mdash;four of us all alone up here since the beginning.
There’s Gary, Captain in the Athabasca Battalion, a Yankee if
the truth were known; there’s Flint, a cockney lieutenant in a
Calgary battery; there’s young Gray, a lieutenant and a Prince
Edward Islander; and here’s me, a major in the Yukon Battalion&mdash;four
of us on the top of a cursed French mountain&mdash;ten months of each
other, of solitude, silence&mdash;and the whole world rocking with
battles&mdash;and not a sound up here&mdash;not a whisper! I tell you we’re
four sick men! We’ve got a grip on ourselves yet, but it’s slipping.
We’re still fairly civil to each other, but the strain is killing.
Sullen silences smother irritability, but&mdash;" he added in a peculiarly
pleasant voice, "I expect we are likely to start killing each
other if somebody doesn’t get us out of here very damn quick."</p>

<p>The staff captain’s lips formed the words, "Awfully sorry! Good
luck!" but his articulation was indistinct, and he went off hurriedly,
still murmuring.</p>

<p>Carfax stood in the snow, watching him clamber down among the
rocks, where an alpinist orderly joined them.</p>

<p>Gary presently appeared at the door of the observation station.
"Has he gone?" he inquired, without interest.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Carfax.</p>

<p>"Is he going to do anything for us?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know.... <em>No!</em>"</p>

<p>Gary lingered, kicked at a salamander, then turned and went indoors.
Carfax sat down on a rock and sucked at his empty pipe.</p>

<p>Later the three officers in the observation station came out
to the door again and looked at him, but turned back into the
doorway without saying anything. And after a while Carfax, feeling
slightly feverish, went indoors, too.</p>

<p>In the square, whitewashed room Gray and Flint were playing cut-throat
poker; Gary was at the telephone, but the messages received or
transmitted appeared to be of no importance. There had never been
any message of importance from the Falcon Peak or to it. There
was likely to be none.</p>

<p>Ennui, inertia, dry rot&mdash;and four men, sometimes silently, sometimes
violently cursing their isolation, but always cursing it&mdash;afraid
in their souls lest they fall to cursing one another aloud as
they had begun to curse in their hearts.</p>

<p>Months ago rain had fallen; now snow fell, and vast winds roared
around them from the Alps. But nothing else ever came to the Falcon
Peak, except a fierce, red-eyed <em>Lämmergeyer</em> sheering
above the peak on enormous pinions, or a few little migrating
birds fluttering down, half frozen, from the high air lanes. Now
and then, also, came to them a staff officer from below, British
sometimes, sometimes French, who lingered no longer than necessary
and then went back again, down into friendly deeps where were
trees and fields and familiar things and human companionship,
leaving them to their hell of silence, of solitude, and of each
other.</p>

<p>The tide of war had never washed the base of their granite cliffs;
the highest battle wave had thundered against the Vosges beyond
earshot; not even a deadened echo of war penetrated those silent
heights; not a Taube floated in the zenith.</p>

<p>In the squatty, whitewashed ruin which once had been the eyrie
of some petty predatory despot, and which now served as an observatory
for two idle divisions below in the valley, stood three telescopes.
Otherwise the furniture consisted of valises, trunks, a table
and chairs, a few books, several newspapers, and some tennis balls
lying on the floor.</p>

<p>Carfax seated himself at one of the telescopes, not looking through
it, his heavy eyes partly closed, his burnt-out pipe between his
teeth.</p>

<p>Gary rose from the telephone and joined the card players. They
shuffled and dealt listlessly, seldom speaking save in monosyllables.</p>

<p>After a while Carfax went over to the card table and the young
lieutenant cashed in and took his place at the telescope.</p>

<p>Below in the Alsatian valley spring had already started the fruit
buds, and a delicate green edged the lower snow line.</p>

<p>The lieutenant spoke of it wistfully; nobody paid any attention;
he rose presently and went outdoors to the edge of the precipice&mdash;not
too near, for fear he might be tempted to jump out through the
sunshine, down into that inviting world of promise below.</p>

<p>Far underneath him&mdash;very far down in the valley&mdash;a cuckoo called.
Out of the depths floated the elfin halloo, the gaily malicious
challenge of spring herself, shouted up melodiously from the plains
of Alsace&mdash;<em>Cuckoo!</em> <em>Cuckoo!</em> <em>Cuckoo!</em>
&mdash;You poor, sullen, frozen foreigner up there on the snowy
rocks!&mdash;<em>Cuckoo!</em> <em>Cuckoo!</em> <em>Cuckoo!</em></p>

<p>The lieutenant of Yukon infantry, whose name was Gray, came back
into the room.</p>

<p>"There’s a bird of sorts yelling like hell below," he said to
the card players.</p>

<p>Carfax ran over his cards, rejected three, and nodded. "Well,
let him yell," he said.</p>

<p>"What is it, a Boche dicky-bird insulting you?" asked Gary, in
his Yankee drawl.</p>

<p>Flint, declining to draw cards, got up and went out into the
sunshine. When he returned to the table, he said: "It’s a cuckoo....
I wish to God I were out of this," he added.</p>

<p>They continued to play for a while without apparent interest.
Each man had won his comrades’ money too many times to care when
Carfax added up debit and credit and wrote down each man’s score.
In nine months, alternately beggaring one another, they had now,
it appeared, broken about even.</p>

<p>Gary, an American in British uniform, twitched a newspaper toward
himself, slouched in his chair, and continued to read for a while.
The paper was French and two weeks old; he jerked it about irritably.</p>

<p>Gray, resting his elbows on his knees, sat gazing vacantly out
of the narrow window. For a smart officer he had grown slovenly.</p>

<p>"If there was any trout fishing to be had," he began; but Flint
laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at? There must be trout in the valley
down there where that bird is," insisted Gray, reddening.</p>

<p>"Yes, and there are cows and chickens and houses and women. What
of it?"</p>

<p>Gary, in his faded service uniform of a captain, scowled over
his newspaper. "It’s bad enough to be here," he said heavily;
"so don’t let’s talk about it. Quit disputing."</p>

<p>Flint ignored the order.</p>

<p>"If there was anything sportin’ to do&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up," muttered Carfax. "Do you expect sport on a hog-back?"</p>

<p>Gray picked up a tennis ball and began to play it against the
whitewashed stone wall, using the palm of his hand. Flint joined
him presently; Gary went over to the telephone, set the receiver
to his ear and spoke to some officer in the distant valley on
the French side, continuing a spiritless conversation while watching
the handball play. After a while he rose, shambled out and down
among the rocks to the spring where snow lay, trodden and filthy,
and the big, black salamanders crawled half stupefied in the sun.
All his loathing and fear of them kindled again as it always did
at sight of them. "Dirty beasts," he muttered, stumping and stumbling
among the stunted fir trees; "some day they’ll bite some of these
damn fools who say they can’t bite. And that’ll end ’em."</p>

<p>Flint and Gray continued to play handball in a perfunctory way
while Carfax looked on from the telephone without interest. Gary
came back, his shoes and puttees all over wet snow.</p>

<p>"Unless," he said in a monotonous voice, "something happens within
the next few days I’ll begin to feel queer in my head; and if
I feel it coming on, I’ll blow my bally nut off. Or somebody’s."
And he touched his service automatic in its holster and yawned.</p>

<p>After a dead silence:</p>

<p>"Buck up," remarked Carfax; "think how our men must feel in Belfort,
never letting off their guns. Ross rifles, too&mdash;not a shot at
a Boche since the damn war began!"</p>

<p>"God!" said Flint, smiting the ball with the palm of his hand,
"to think of those Ross rifles rusting down there and to think
of the pink-skinned pigs they could paunch so cleanly. Did you
ever paunch a deer? What a mess of intestines all over the shop!"</p>

<p>Gary, still standing, began to kick the snow from his shoes.
Gray said to him: "For a dollar of your Yankee money I’d give
you a shot at me with your automatic&mdash;you’re that slack at practice."</p>

<p>"If it goes on much longer like this I’ll not have to pay for
a shot at anybody," returned Gary, with a short laugh.</p>

<p>Gray laughed too, disagreeably, stretching his facial muscles,
but no sound issued.</p>

<p>"We’re all going crazy together up here; that’s my idea," he
said. "I don’t know which I can stand most comfortably, your voices
or your silence. Both make me sick."</p>

<p>"Some day a salamander will nip you; then you’ll go loco," observed
Gary, balancing another tennis ball in his right hand. "Give me
a shot at you?" he added. "I feel as though I could throw it clean
through you. You look soft as a pudding to me."</p>

<p>Far, clear, from infinite depths, the elf-like hail of the cuckoo
came floating up to the window.</p>

<p>To Flint, English born, the call meant more than it did to Canadian
or Yankee.</p>

<p>"In Devon," he said in an altered voice, "they’ll be calling
just now. There’s a world of primroses in Devon.... And the thorn
is as white as the damned snow is up here."</p>

<p>Gary growled his impatience and his profile of a Greek fighter
showed in clean silhouette against the window.</p>

<p>"Aw, hell," he said, "did I come out here for this?&mdash;nine months
of it?" He hurled the tennis ball at the wall. "Can the home talk,
if you don’t mind."</p>

<p>The cuckoo was still calling.</p>

<p>"Did you ever play cuckoo," asked Carfax, "at ten shillings a
throw? It’s not a bad game&mdash;if you’re put to it for amusement."</p>

<p>Nobody replied; Gray’s sunken, boyish face betrayed no interest;
he continued to toss a tennis ball against the wall and catch
it on the rebound.</p>

<p>Toward sundown the usual Alpine chill set in; a mist hung over
the snow-edged cliffs; the rocks breathed steam under a foggy
and battered moon.</p>
