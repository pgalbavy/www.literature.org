<p>The terrace in front of the house was a long narrow strip of
turf, bounded along its outer edge by a graceful stone balustrade.
Two little summer-houses of brick stood at either end. Below the
house the ground sloped very steeply away, and the terrace was
a remarkably high one; from the balusters to the sloping lawn
beneath was a drop of thirty feet. Seen from below, the high unbroken
terrace wall, built like the house itself of brick, had the almost
menacing aspect of a fortification&mdash;a castle bastion, from whose
parapet one looked out across airy depths to distances level with
the eye. Below, in the foreground, hedged in by solid masses of
sculptured yew trees, lay the stone-brimmed swimming-pool. Beyond
it stretched the park, with its massive elms, its green expanses
of grass, and, at the bottom of the valley, the gleam of the narrow
river. On the farther side of the stream the land rose again in
a long slope, chequered with cultivation. Looking up the valley,
to the right, one saw a line of blue, far-off hills.</p>

<p>The tea-table had been planted in the shade of one of the little
summer-houses, and the rest of the party was already assembled
about it when Denis and Priscilla made their appearance. Henry
Wimbush had begun to pour out the tea. He was one of those ageless,
unchanging men on the farther side of fifty, who might be thirty,
who might be anything. Denis had known him almost as long as he
could remember. In all those years his pale, rather handsome face
had never grown any older; it was like the pale grey bowler hat
which he always wore, winter and summer&mdash;unageing, calm, serenely
without expression.</p>

<p>Next him, but separated from him and from the rest of the world
by the almost impenetrable barriers of her deafness, sat Jenny
Mullion. She was perhaps thirty, had a tilted nose and a pink-and-white
complexion, and wore her brown hair plaited and coiled in two
lateral buns over her ears. In the secret tower of her deafness
she sat apart, looking down at the world through sharply piercing
eyes. What did she think of men and women and things? That was
something that Denis had never been able to discover. In her enigmatic
remoteness Jenny was a little disquieting. Even now some interior
joke seemed to be amusing her, for she was smiling to herself,
and her brown eyes were like very bright round marbles.</p>

<p>On his other side the serious, moonlike innocence of Mary Bracegirdle’s
face shone pink and childish. She was nearly twenty-three, but
one wouldn’t have guessed it. Her short hair, clipped like a page’s,
hung in a bell of elastic gold about her cheeks. She had large
blue china eyes, whose expression was one of ingenuous and often
puzzled earnestness.</p>

<p>Next to Mary a small gaunt man was sitting, rigid and erect in
his chair. In appearance Mr. Scogan was like one of those extinct
bird-lizards of the Tertiary. His nose was beaked, his dark eye
had the shining quickness of a robin’s. But there was nothing
soft or gracious or feathery about him. The skin of his wrinkled
brown face had a dry and scaly look; his hands were the hands
of a crocodile. His movements were marked by the lizard’s disconcertingly
abrupt clockwork speed; his speech was thin, fluty, and dry. Henry
Wimbush’s school-fellow and exact contemporary, Mr. Scogan looked
far older and, at the same time, far more youthfully alive than
did that gentle aristocrat with the face like a grey bowler.</p>

<p>Mr. Scogan might look like an extinct saurian, but Gombauld was
altogether and essentially human. In the old-fashioned natural
histories of the ‘thirties he might have figured in a steel engraving
as a type of Homo Sapiens&mdash;an honour which at that time commonly
fell to Lord Byron. Indeed, with more hair and less collar, Gombauld
would have been completely Byronic&mdash;more than Byronic, even, for
Gombauld was of Provencal descent, a black-haired young corsair
of thirty, with flashing teeth and luminous large dark eyes. Denis
looked at him enviously. He was jealous of his talent: if only
he wrote verse as well as Gombauld painted pictures! Still more,
at the moment, he envied Gombauld his looks, his vitality, his
easy confidence of manner. Was it surprising that Anne should
like him? Like him?&mdash;it might even be something worse, Denis reflected
bitterly, as he walked at Priscilla’s side down the long grass
terrace.</p>

<p>Between Gombauld and Mr. Scogan a very much lowered deck-chair
presented its back to the new arrivals as they advanced towards
the tea-table. Gombauld was leaning over it; his face moved vivaciously;
he smiled, he laughed, he made quick gestures with his hands.
From the depths of the chair came up a sound of soft, lazy laughter.
Denis started as he heard it. That laughter&mdash;how well he knew
it! What emotions it evoked in him! He quickened his pace.</p>

<p>In her low deck-chair Anne was nearer to lying than to sitting.
Her long, slender body reposed in an attitude of listless and
indolent grace. Within its setting of light brown hair her face
had a pretty regularity that was almost doll-like. And indeed
there were moments when she seemed nothing more than a doll; when
the oval face, with its long-lashed, pale blue eyes, expressed
nothing; when it was no more than a lazy mask of wax. She was
Henry Wimbush’s own niece; that bowler-like countenance was one
of the Wimbush heirlooms; it ran in the family, appearing in its
female members as a blank doll-face. But across this dollish mask,
like a gay melody dancing over an unchanging fundamental bass,
passed Anne’s other inheritance&mdash;quick laughter, light ironic
amusement, and the changing expressions of many moods. She was
smiling now as Denis looked down at her: her cat’s smile, he called
it, for no very good reason. The mouth was compressed, and on
either side of it two tiny wrinkles had formed themselves in her
cheeks. An infinity of slightly malicious amusement lurked in
those little folds, in the puckers about the half-closed eyes,
in the eyes themselves, bright and laughing between the narrowed
lids.</p>

<p>The preliminary greetings spoken, Denis found an empty chair
between Gombauld and Jenny and sat down.</p>

<p>"How are you, Jenny?" he shouted to her.</p>

<p>Jenny nodded and smiled in mysterious silence, as though the
subject of her health were a secret that could not be publicly
divulged.</p>

<p>"How’s London been since I went away?" Anne inquired from the
depth of her chair.</p>

<p>The moment had come; the tremendously amusing narrative was waiting
for utterance. "Well," said Denis, smiling happily, "to begin
with..."</p>

<p>"Has Priscilla told you of our great antiquarian find?" Henry
Wimbush leaned forward; the most promising of buds was nipped.</p>

<p>"To begin with," said Denis desperately, "there was the Ballet..."</p>

<p>"Last week," Mr. Wimbush went on softly and implacably, "we dug
up fifty yards of oaken drain-pipes; just tree trunks with a hole
bored through the middle. Very interesting indeed. Whether they
were laid down by the monks in the fifteenth century, or whether..."</p>

<p>Denis listened gloomily. "Extraordinary!" he said, when Mr. Wimbush
had finished; "quite extraordinary!" He helped himself to another
slice of cake. He didn’t even want to tell his tale about London
now; he was damped.</p>

<p>For some time past Mary’s grave blue eyes had been fixed upon
him. "What have you been writing lately?" she asked. It would
be nice to have a little literary conversation.</p>

<p>"Oh, verse and prose," said Denis&mdash;"just verse and prose."</p>

<p>"Prose?" Mr. Scogan pounced alarmingly on the word. "You’ve been
writing prose?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Not a novel?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"My poor Denis!" exclaimed Mr. Scogan. "What about?"</p>

<p>Denis felt rather uncomfortable. "Oh, about the usual things,
you know."</p>

<p>"Of course," Mr. Scogan groaned. "I’ll describe the plot for
you. Little Percy, the hero, was never good at games, but he was
always clever. He passes through the usual public school and the
usual university and comes to London, where he lives among the
artists. He is bowed down with melancholy thought; he carries
the whole weight of the universe upon his shoulders. He writes
a novel of dazzling brilliance; he dabbles delicately in Amour
and disappears, at the end of the book, into the luminous Future."</p>

<p>Denis blushed scarlet. Mr. Scogan had described the plan of his
novel with an accuracy that was appalling. He made an effort to
laugh. "You’re entirely wrong," he said. "My novel is not in the
least like that." It was a heroic lie. Luckily, he reflected,
only two chapters were written. He would tear them up that very
evening when he unpacked.</p>

<p>Mr. Scogan paid no attention to his denial, but went on: "Why
will you young men continue to write about things that are so
entirely uninteresting as the mentality of adolescents and artists?
Professional anthropologists might find it interesting to turn
sometimes from the beliefs of the Blackfellow to the philosophical
preoccupations of the undergraduate. But you can’t expect an ordinary
adult man, like myself, to be much moved by the story of his spiritual
troubles. And after all, even in England, even in Germany and
Russia, there are more adults than adolescents. As for the artist,
he is preoccupied with problems that are so utterly unlike those
of the ordinary adult man&mdash;problems of pure aesthetics which don’t
so much as present themselves to people like myself&mdash;that a description
of his mental processes is as boring to the ordinary reader as
a piece of pure mathematics. A serious book about artists regarded
as artists is unreadable; and a book about artists regarded as
lovers, husbands, dipsomaniacs, heroes, and the like is really
not worth writing again. Jean-Christophe is the stock artist of
literature, just as Professor Radium of ‘Comic Cuts’ is its stock
man of science."</p>

<p>"I’m sorry to hear I’m as uninteresting as all that," said Gombauld.</p>

<p>"Not at all, my dear Gombauld," Mr. Scogan hastened to explain.
"As a lover or a dipsomaniac, I’ve no doubt of your being a most
fascinating specimen. But as a combiner of forms, you must honestly
admit it, you’re a bore."</p>

<p>"I entirely disagree with you," exclaimed Mary. She was somehow
always out of breath when she talked. And her speech was punctuated
by little gasps. "I’ve known a great many artists, and I’ve always
found their mentality very interesting. Especially in Paris. Tschuplitski,
for example &mdash;I saw a great deal of Tschuplitski in Paris
this spring..."</p>

<p>"Ah, but then you’re an exception, Mary, you’re an exception,"
said Mr. Scogan. "You are a femme superieure."</p>

<p>A flush of pleasure turned Mary’s face into a harvest moon.</p>
