<p>She went out to caution the servants to a strict watch, armed
to the teeth, before the gate all night long, and she crossed
the deserted garden. Under the veranda the schwitzar was spreading
a mattress for Ermolai. She asked him if he had seen the young
Frenchman anywhere, and after the answer, could only say to herself,
"Where is he, then?" Where had Rouletabille gone? The general,
whom she had carried up to his room on her back, without any help,
and had helped into bed without assistance, was disturbed by this
singular disappearance. Had someone already carried off "their"
Rouletabille? Their friends were gone and the orderlies had taken
leave without being able to say where this boy of a journalist
had gone. But it would be foolish to worry about the disappearance
of a Journalist, they had said. That kind of man&mdash;these journalists&mdash;came,
went, arrived when one least expected them, and quitted their
company&mdash;even the highest society&mdash;without formality. It was what
they called in France "leaving English fashion." However, it appeared
it was not meant to be impolite. Perhaps he had gone to telegraph.
A journalist had to keep in touch with the telegraph at all hours.
Poor Matrena Petrovna roamed the solitary garden in tumult of
heart. There was the light in the general’s window on the first
floor. There were lights in the basement from the kitchens. There
was a light on the ground-floor near the sitting-room, from Natacha’s
chamber window. Ah, the night was hard to bear. And this night
the shadows weighed heavier than ever on the valiant breast of
Matrena. As she breathed she felt as though she lifted all the
weight of the threatening night. She examined everything&mdash;everything.
All was shut tight, was perfectly secure, and there was no one
within excepting people she was absolutely sure of&mdash;but whom,
all the same, she did not allow to go anywhere in the house excepting
where their work called them. Each in his place. That made things
surer. She wished each one could remain fixed like the porcelain
statues of men out on the lawn. Even as she thought it, here at
her feet, right at her very feet, a shadow of one of the porcelain
men moved, stretched itself out, rose to its knees, grasped her
skirt and spoke in the voice of Rouletabille. Ah, good! it was
Rouletabille. "Himself, dear madame; himself."</p>

<p>"Why is Ermolai in the veranda? Send him back to the kitchens
and tell the schwitzar to go to bed. The servants are enough for
an ordinary guard outside. Then you go in at once, shut the door,
and don’t concern yourself about me, dear madame. Good-night."</p>

<p>Rouletabille had resumed, in the shadows, among the other porcelain
figures, his pose of a porcelain man.</p>

<p>Matrena Petrovna did as she was told, returned to the house,
spoke to the schwitzar, who removed to the lodge with Ermolai,
and their mistress closed the outside door. She had closed long
before the door of the kitchen stair which allowed the domestics
to enter the villa from below. Down there each night the devoted
gniagnia and the faithful Ermolai watched in turn.</p>

<p>Within the villa, now closed, there were on the ground-floor
only Matrena herself and her step-daughter Natacha, who slept
in the chamber off the sitting-room, and, above on the first floor,
the general asleep, or who ought to be asleep if he had taken
his potion. Matrena remained in the darkness of the drawing-room,
her dark-lantern in her hand. All her nights passed thus, gliding
from door to door, from chamber to chamber, watching over the
watch of the police, not daring to stop her stealthy promenade
even to throw herself on the mattress that she had placed across
the doorway of her husband’s chamber. Did she ever sleep? She
herself could hardly say. Who else could, then? A tag of sleep
here and there, over the arm of a chair, or leaning against the
wall, waked always by some noise that she heard or dreamed, some
warning, perhaps, that she alone had heard. And to-night, to-night
there is Rouletabille’s alert guard to help her, and she feels
a little less the aching terror of watchfulness, until there surges
back into her mind the recollection that the police are no longer
there. Was he right, this young man? Certainly she could not deny
that some way she feels more confidence now that the police are
gone. She does not have to spend her time watching their shadows
in the shadows, searching the darkness, the arm-chairs, the sofas,
to rouse them, to appeal in low tones to all they held binding,
by their own name and the name of their father, to promise them
a bonus that would amount to something if they watched well, to
count them in order to know where they all were, and, suddenly,
to throw full in their face the ray of light from her little dark-lantern
in order to be sure, absolutely sure, that she was face to face
with them, one of the police, and not with some other, some other
with an infernal machine under his arm. Yes, she surely had less
work now that she had no longer to watch the police. And she had
less fear!</p>

<p>She thanked the young reporter for that. Where was he? Did he
remain in the pose of a porcelain statue all this time out there
on the lawn? She peered through the lattice of the veranda shutters
and looked anxiously out into the darkened garden. Where could
he be? Was that he, down yonder, that crouching black heap with
an unlighted pipe in his mouth? No, no. That, she knew well, was
the dwarf she genuinely loved, her little domovoi-doukh, the familiar
spirit of the house, who watched with her over the general’s life
and thanks to whom serious injury had not yet befallen Feodor
Feodorovitch&mdash;one could not regard a mangled leg that seriously.
Ordinarily in her own country (she was from the Orel district)
one did not care to see the domovoi-doukh appear in flesh and
blood. When she was little she was always afraid that she would
come upon him around a turn of the path in her father’s garden.
She always thought of him as no higher than that, seated back
on his haunches and smoking his pipe. Then, after she was married,
she had suddenly run across him at a turning in the bazaar at
Moscow. He was just as she had imagined him, and she had immediately
bought him, carried him home herself and placed him, with many
precautions, for he was of very delicate porcelain, in the vestibule
of the palace. And in leaving Moscow she had been careful not
to leave him there. She had carried him herself in a case and
had placed him herself on the lawn of the datcha des Iles, that
he might continue to watch over her happiness and over the life
of her Feodor. And in order that he should not be bored, eternally
smoking his pipe all alone, she had surrounded him with a group
of little porcelain genii, after the fashion of the Jardins des
Iles. Lord! how that young Frenchman had frightened her, rising
suddenly like that, without warning, on the lawn. She had believed
for a moment that it was the domovoi-doukh himself rising to stretch
his legs. Happily he had spoken at once and she had recognized
his voice. And besides, her domovoi surely would not speak French.
Ah! Matrena Petrovna breathed freely now. It seemed to her, this
night, that there were two little familiar genii watching over
the house. And that was worth more than all the police in the
world, surely. How wily that little fellow was to order all those
men away. There was something it was necessary to know; it was
necessary therefore that nothing should be in the way of learning
it. As things were now, the mystery could operate without suspicion
or interference. Only one man watched it, and he had not the air
of watching. Certainly Rouletabille had not the air of constantly
watching anything. He had the manner, out in the night, of an
easy little man in porcelain, neither more nor less, yet he could
see everything&mdash;if anything were there to see&mdash;and he could hear
everything&mdash;if there were anything to hear. One passed beside
him without suspecting him, and men might talk to each other without
an idea that he heard them, and even talk to themselves according
to the habit people have sometimes when they think themselves
quite alone. All the guests had departed thus, passing close by
him, almost brushing him, had exchanged their "Adieus," their
"Au revoirs," and all their final, drawn-out farewells. That dear
little living domovoi certainly was a rogue! Oh, that dear little
domovoi who had been so affected by the tears of Matrena Petrovna!
The good, fat, sentimental, heroic woman longed to hear, just
then, his reassuring voice.</p>

<p>"It is I. Here I am," said the voice of her little living familiar
spirit at that instant, and she felt her skirt grasped. She waited
for what he should say. She felt no fear. Yet she had supposed
he was outside the house. Still, after all, she was not too astonished
that he was within. He was so adroit! He had entered behind her,
in the shadow of her skirts, on all-fours, and had slipped away
without anyone noticing him, while she was speaking to her enormous,
majestic schwitzar.</p>

<p>"So you were here?" she said, taking his hand and pressing it
nervously in hers.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. I have watched you closing the house. It is a task
well-done, certainly. You have not forgotten anything."</p>

<p>"But where were you, dear little demon? I have been into all
the corners, and my hands did not touch you."</p>

<p>"I was under the table set with hors-d’oeuvres in the sitting-room."</p>

<p>"Ah, under the table of zakouskis! I have forbidden them before
now to spread a long hanging cloth there, which obliges me to
kick my foot underneath casually in order to be sure there is
no one beneath. It is imprudent, very imprudent, such table-cloths.
And under the table of zakouskis have you been able to see or
hear anything?"</p>

<p>"Madame, do you think that anyone could possibly see or hear
anything in the villa when you are watching it alone, when the
general is asleep and your step-daughter is preparing for bed?"</p>

<p>"No. No. I do not believe so. I do not. No, oh, Christ!"</p>

<p>They talked thus very low in the dark, both seated in a corner
of the sofa, Rouletabille’s hand held tightly in the burning hands
of Matrena Petrovna.</p>

<p>She sighed anxiously. "And in the garden&mdash;have you heard anything?"</p>

<p>"I heard the officer Boris say to the officer Michael, in French,
‘Shall we return at once to the villa?’ The other replied in Russian
in a way I could see was a refusal. Then they had a discussion
in Russian which I, naturally, could not understand. But from
the way they talked I gathered that they disagreed and that no
love was lost between them."</p>

<p>"No, they do not love each other. They both love Natacha."</p>

<p>"And she, which one of them does she love? It is necessary to
tell me."</p>

<p>"She pretends that she loves Boris, and I believe she does, and
yet she is very friendly with Michael and often she goes into
nooks and corners to chat with him, which makes Boris mad with
jealousy. She has forbidden Boris to speak to her father about
their marriage, on the pretext that she does not wish to leave
her father now, while each day, each minute the general’s life
is in danger."</p>

<p>"And you, madame&mdash;do you love your step-daughter?" brutally inquired
the reporter.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;sincerely," replied Matrena Petrovna, withdrawing her hand
from those of Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"And she&mdash;does she love you?"</p>

<p>"I believe so, monsieur, I believe so sincerely. Yes, she loves
me, and there is not any reason why she should not love me. I
believe&mdash;understand me thoroughly, because it comes from my heart&mdash;that
we all here in this house love one another. Our friends are old
proved friends. Boris has been orderly to my husband for a very
long time. We do not share any of his too-modern ideas, and there
were many discussions on the duty of soldiers at the time of the
massacres. I reproached him with being as womanish as we were
in going down on his knees to the general behind Natacha and me,
when it became necessary to kill all those poor moujiks of Presnia.
It was not his role. A soldier is a soldier. My husband raised
him roughly and ordered him, for his pains, to march at the head
of the troops. It was right. What else could he do? The general
already had enough to fight against, with the whole revolution,
with his conscience, with the natural pity in his heart of a brave
man, and with the tears and insupportable moanings, at such a
moment, of his daughter and his wife. Boris understood and obeyed
him, but, after the death of the poor students, he behaved again
like a woman in composing those verses on the heroes of the barricades;
don’t you think so? Verses that Natacha and he learned by heart,
working together, when they were surprised at it by the general.
There was a terrible scene. It was before the next-to-the-last
attack. The general then had the use of both legs. He stamped
his feet and fairly shook the house."</p>

<p>"Madame," said Rouletabille, "a propos of the attacks, you must
tell me about the third."</p>

<p>As he said this, leaning toward her, Matrena Petrovna ejaculated
a "Listen!" that made him rigid in the night with ear alert. What
had she heard? For him, he had heard nothing.</p>

<p>"You hear nothing?" she whispered to him with an effort. "A tick-tack?"</p>

<p>"No, I hear nothing."</p>

<p>"You know&mdash;like the tick-tack of a clock. Listen."</p>

<p>"How can you hear the tick-tack? I’ve noticed that no clocks
are running here."</p>

<p>"Don’t you understand? It is so that we shall be able to hear
the tick-tack better."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I understand. But I do not hear anything."</p>

<p>"For myself, I think I hear the tick-tack all the time since
the last attempt. It haunts my ears, it is frightful, to say to
one’s self: There is clockwork somewhere, just about to reach
the death-tick&mdash;and not to know where, not to know where! When
the police were here I made them all listen, and I was not sure
even when they had all listened and said there was no tick-tack.
It is terrible to hear it in my ear any moment when I least expect
it. Tick-tack! Tick-tack! It is the blood beating in my ear, for
instance, hard, as if it struck on a sounding-board. Why, here
are drops of perspiration on my hands! Listen!"</p>

<p>"Ah, this time someone is talking&mdash;is crying," said the young
man.</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h!" And Rouletabille felt the rigid hand of Matrena Petrovna
on his arm. "It is the general. The general is dreaming!"</p>

<p>She drew him into the dining-room, into a corner where they could
no longer hear the moanings. But all the doors that communicated
with the dining-room, the drawing-room and the sitting-room remained
open behind him, by the secret precaution of Rouletabille.</p>

<p>He waited while Matrena, whose breath he heard come hard, was
a little behind. In a moment, quite talkative, and as though she
wished to distract Rouletabille’s attention from the sounds above,
the broken words and sighs, she continued:</p>

<p>"See, you speak of clocks. My husband has a watch which strikes.
Well, I have stopped his watch because more than once I have been
startled by hearing the tick-tack of his watch in his waistcoat-pocket.
Koupriane gave me that advice one day when he was here and had
pricked his ears at the noise of the pendulums, to stop all my
watches and clocks so that there would be no chance of confusing
them with the tick-tack that might come from an infernal machine
planted in some corner. He spoke from experience, my dear little
monsieur, and it was by his order that all the clocks at the Ministry,
on the Naberjnaia, were stopped, my dear little friend. The Nihilists,
he told me, often use clockworks to set off their machines at
the time they decide on. No one can guess all the inventions that
they have, those brigands. In the same way, Koupriane advised
me to take away all the draught-boards from the fireplaces. By
that precaution they were enabled to avoid a terrible disaster
at the Ministry near the Pont-des-chantres, you know, petit demovoi?
They saw a bomb just as it was being lowered into the fire-place
of the minister’s cabinet.* The Nihilists held it by a cord and
were up on the roof letting it down the chimney. One of them was
caught, taken to Schlusselbourg and hanged. Here you can see that
all the draught-boards of the fireplaces are cleared away."</p>

*Actual attack on Witte.

</p>
</div>
<p>"Madame," interrupted Rouletabille (Matrena Petrovna did not
know that no one ever succeeded in distracting Rouletabille’s
attention), "madame, someone moans still, upstairs."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is nothing, my little friend. It is the general, who
has bad nights. He cannot sleep without a narcotic, and that gives
him a fever. I am going to tell you now how the third attack came
about. And then you will understand, by the Virgin Mary, how it
is I have yet, always have, the tick-tack in my ears.</p>

<p>"One evening when the general had got to sleep and I was in my
own room, I heard distinctly the tick-tack of clockwork operating.
All the clocks had been stopped, as Koupriane advised, and I had
made an excuse to send Feodor’s great watch to the repairer. You
can understand how I felt when I heard that tick-tack. I was frenzied.
I turned my head in all directions, and decided that the sound
came from my husband’s chamber. I ran there. He still slept, man
that he is! The tick-tack was there. But where? I turned here
and there like a fool. The chamber was in darkness and it seemed
absolutely impossible for me to light a lamp because I thought
I could not take the time for fear the infernal machine would
go off in those few seconds. I threw myself on the floor and listened
under the bed. The noise came from above. But where? I sprang
to the fireplace, hoping that, against my orders, someone had
started the mantel-clock. No, it was not that! It seemed to me
now that the tick-tack came from the bed itself, that the machine
was in the bed. The general awaked just then and cried to me,
‘What is it, Matrena? What are you doing?’ And he raised himself
in bed, while I cried, ‘Listen! Hear the tick-tack. Don’t you
hear the tick-tack?’ I threw myself upon him and gathered him
up in my arms to carry him, but I trembled too much, was too weak
from fear, and fell back with him onto the bed, crying, ‘Help!’
He thrust me away and said roughly, ‘Listen.’ The frightful tick-tack
was behind us now, on the table. But there was nothing on the
table, only the night-light, the glass with the potion in it,
and a gold vase where I had placed with my own hands that morning
a cluster of grasses and wild flowers that Ermolai had brought
that morning on his return from the Orel country. With one bound
I was on the table and at the flowers. I struck my fingers among
the grasses and the flowers, and felt a resistance. The tick-tack
was in the bouquet! I took the bouquet in both hands, opened the
window and threw it as far as I could into the garden. At the
same moment the bomb burst with a terrible noise, giving me quite
a deep wound in the hand. Truly, my dear little domovoi, that
day we had been very near death, but God and the Little Father
watched over us."</p>

<p>And Matrena Petrovna made the sign of the cross.</p>

<p>"All the windows of the house were broken. In all, we escaped
with the fright and a visit from the glazier, my little friend,
but I certainly believed that all was over."</p>

<p>"And Mademoiselle Natacha?" inquired Rouletabille. "She must
also have been terribly frightened, because the whole house must
have rocked."</p>

<p>"Surely. But Natacha was not here that night. It was a Saturday.
She had been invited to the soiree du ‘Michel’ by the parents
of Boris Nikolaievitch, and she slept at their house, after supper
at the Ours, as had been planned. The next day, when she learned
the danger the general had escaped, she trembled in every limb.
She threw herself in her father’s arms, weeping, which was natural
enough, and declared that she never would go away from him again.
The general told her how I had managed. Then she pressed me to
her heart, saying that she never would forget such an action,
and that she loved me more than if I were truly her mother. It
was all in vain that during the days following we sought to understand
how the infernal machine had been placed in the bouquet of wild
flowers. Only the general’s friends that you saw this evening,
Natacha and I had entered the general’s chamber during the day
or in the evening. No servant, no chamber-maid, had been on that
floor. In the day-time as well as all night long that entire floor
is closed and I have the keys. The door of the servants’ staircase
which opens onto that floor, directly into the general’s chamber,
is always locked and barred on the inside with iron. Natacha and
I do the chamber work. There is no way of taking greater precautions.
Three police agents watched over us night and day. The night of
the bouquet two had spent their time watching around the house,
and the third lay on the sofa in the veranda. Then, too, we found
all the doors and windows of the villa shut tight. In such circumstances
you can judge whether my anguish was not deeper than any I had
known hitherto. Because to whom, henceforth, could we trust ourselves?
what and whom could we believe? what and whom could we watch?
From that day, no other person but Natacha and me have the right
to go to the first floor. The general’s chamber was forbidden
to his friends. Anyway, the general improved, and soon had the
pleasure of receiving them himself at his table. I carry the general
down and take him to his room again on my back. I do not wish
anyone to help. I am strong enough for that. I feel that I could
carry him to the end of the world if that would save him. Instead
of three police, we had ten; five outside, five inside. The days
went well enough, but the nights were frightful, because the shadows
of the police that I encountered always made me fear that I was
face to face with the Nihilists. One night I almost strangled
one with my hand. It was after that incident that we arranged
with Koupriane that the agents who watched at night, inside, should
stay placed in the veranda, after having, at the end of the evening,
made complete examination of everything. They were not to leave
the veranda unless they heard a suspicious noise or I called to
them. And it was after that arrangement that the incident of the
floor happened, that has puzzled so both Koupriane and me."</p>

<p>"Pardon, madame," interrupted Rouletabille, "but the agents,
during the examination of everything, never went to the bedroom
floor?"</p>

<p>"No, my child, there is only myself and Natacha, I repeat, who,
since the bouquet, go there."</p>

<p>"Well, madame, it is necessary to take me there at once."</p>

<p>"At once!"</p>

<p>"Yes, into the general’s chamber."</p>

<p>"But he is sleeping, my child. Let me tell you exactly how the
affair of the floor happened, and you will know as much of it
as I and as Koupriane."</p>

<p>"To the general’s chamber at once."</p>

<p>She took both his hands and pressed them nervously. "Little friend!
Little friend! One hears there sometimes things which are the
secret of the night! You understand me?"</p>

<p>"To the general’s chamber, at once, madame."</p>

<p>Abruptly she decided to take him there, agitated, upset as she
was by ideas and sentiments which held her without respite between
the wildest inquietude and the most imprudent audacity.</p>
