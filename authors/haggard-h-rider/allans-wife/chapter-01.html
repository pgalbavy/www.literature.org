<p>It may be remembered that in the last pages of his diary, written just
before his death, Allan Quatermain makes allusion to his long dead wife,
stating that he has written of her fully elsewhere.
</p><p>When his death was known, his papers were handed to myself as his
literary executor. Among them I found two manuscripts, of which the
following is one. The other is simply a record of events wherein Mr.
Quatermain was not personally concerned--a Zulu novel, the story of
which was told to him by the hero many years after the tragedy had
occurred. But with this we have nothing to do at present.
</p>
<p>I have often thought (Mr. Quatermain’s manuscript begins) that I would
set down on paper the events connected with my marriage, and the loss of
my most dear wife. Many years have now passed since that event, and to
some extent time has softened the old grief, though Heaven knows it
is still keen enough. On two or three occasions I have even begun the
record. Once I gave it up because the writing of it depressed me beyond
bearing, once because I was suddenly called away upon a journey, and
the third time because a Kaffir boy found my manuscript convenient for
lighting the kitchen fire.
</p><p>But now that I am at leisure here in England, I will make a fourth
attempt. If I succeed, the story may serve to interest some one in after
years when I am dead and gone; before that I should not wish it to
be published. It is a wild tale enough, and suggests some curious
reflections.
</p><p>I am the son of a missionary. My father was originally curate in charge
of a small parish in Oxfordshire. He had already been some ten years
married to my dear mother when he went there, and he had four children,
of whom I was the youngest. I remember faintly the place where we lived.
It was an ancient long grey house, facing the road. There was a very
large tree of some sort in the garden. It was hollow, and we children
used to play about inside of it, and knock knots of wood from the rough
bark. We all slept in a kind of attic, and my mother always came and
kissed us when we were in bed. I used to wake up and see her bending
over me, a candle in her hand. There was a curious kind of pole
projecting from the wall over my bed. Once I was dreadfully frightened
because my eldest brother made me hang to it by my hands. That is all
I remember about our old home. It has been pulled down long ago, or I
would journey there to see it.
</p><p>A little further down the road was a large house with big iron gates to
it, and on the top of the gate pillars sat two stone lions, which
were so hideous that I was afraid of them. Perhaps this sentiment was
prophetic. One could see the house by peeping through the bars of the
gates. It was a gloomy-looking place, with a tall yew hedge round it;
but in the summer-time some flowers grew about the sun-dial in the grass
plat. This house was called the Hall, and Squire Carson lived there. One
Christmas--it must have been the Christmas before my father emigrated,
or I should not remember it--we children went to a Christmas-tree
festivity at the Hall. There was a great party there, and footmen
wearing red waistcoats stood at the door. In the dining-room, which was
panelled with black oak, was the Christmas-tree. Squire Carson stood in
front of it. He was a tall, dark man, very quiet in his manners, and he
wore a bunch of seals on his waistcoat. We used to think him old, but
as a matter of fact he was then not more than forty. He had been, as
I afterwards learned, a great traveller in his youth, and some six
or seven years before this date he married a lady who was half a
Spaniard--a papist, my father called her. I can remember her well. She
was small and very pretty, with a rounded figure, large black eyes, and
glittering teeth. She spoke English with a curious accent. I suppose
that I must have been a funny child to look at, and I know that my hair
stood up on my head then as it does now, for I still have a sketch of
myself that my mother made of me, in which this peculiarity is strongly
marked. On this occasion of the Christmas-tree I remember that Mrs.
Carson turned to a tall, foreign-looking gentleman who stood beside
her, and, tapping him affectionately on the shoulder with her gold
eye-glasses, said--
</p><p>“Look, cousin--look at that droll little boy with the big brown eyes;
his hair is like a--what you call him?--scrubbing-brush. Oh, what a
droll little boy!”
</p><p>The tall gentleman pulled at his moustache, and, taking Mrs. Carson’s
hand in his, began to smooth my hair down with it till I heard her
whisper--
</p><p>“Leave go my hand, cousin. Thomas is looking like--like the
thunderstorm.”
</p><p>Thomas was the name of Mr. Carson, her husband.
</p><p>After that I hid myself as well as I could behind a chair, for I was
shy, and watched little Stella Carson, who was the squire’s only child,
giving the children presents off the tree. She was dressed as Father
Christmas, with some soft white stuff round her lovely little face, and
she had large dark eyes, which I thought more beautiful than anything
I had ever seen. At last it came to my turn to receive a present--oddly
enough, considered in the light of future events, it was a large monkey.
Stella reached it down from one of the lower boughs of the tree and
handed it to me, saying--
</p><p>“Dat is my Christmas present to you, little Allan Quatermain.”
</p><p>As she did so her sleeve, which was covered with cotton wool, spangled
over with something that shone, touched one of the tapers and caught
fire--how I do not know--and the flame ran up her arm towards her
throat. She stood quite still. I suppose that she was paralysed with
fear; and the ladies who were near screamed very loud, but did nothing.
Then some impulse seized me--perhaps instinct would be a better word to
use, considering my age. I threw myself upon the child, and, beating at
the fire with my hands, mercifully succeeded in extinguishing it before
it really got hold. My wrists were so badly scorched that they had to be
wrapped up in wool for a long time afterwards, but with the exception of
a single burn upon her throat, little Stella Carson was not much hurt.
</p><p>This is all that I remember about the Christmas-tree at the Hall.
What happened afterwards is lost to me, but to this day in my sleep I
sometimes see little Stella’s sweet face and the stare of terror in her
dark eyes as the fire ran up her arm. This, however, is not wonderful,
for I had, humanly speaking, saved the life of her who was destined to
be my wife.
</p><p>The next event which I can recall clearly is that my mother and three
brothers all fell ill of fever, owing, as I afterwards learned, to the
poisoning of our well by some evil-minded person, who threw a dead sheep
into it.
</p><p>It must have been while they were ill that Squire Carson came one day
to the vicarage. The weather was still cold, for there was a fire in
the study, and I sat before the fire writing letters on a piece of paper
with a pencil, while my father walked up and down the room talking to
himself. Afterwards I knew that he was praying for the lives of his wife
and children. Presently a servant came to the door and said that some
one wanted to see him.
</p><p>“It is the squire, sir,” said the maid, “and he says he particularly
wishes to see you.”
</p><p>“Very well,” answered my father, wearily, and presently Squire Carson
came in. His face was white and haggard, and his eyes shone so fiercely
that I was afraid of him.
</p><p>“Forgive me for intruding on you at such a time, Quatermain,” he said,
in a hoarse voice, “but to-morrow I leave this place for ever, and I
wish to speak to you before I go--indeed, I must speak to you.”
</p><p>“Shall I send Allan away?” said my father, pointing to me.
</p><p>“No; let him bide. He will not understand.” Nor, indeed, did I at the
time, but I remembered every word, and in after years their meaning grew
on me.
</p><p>“First tell me,” he went on, “how are they?” and he pointed upwards with
his thumb.
</p><p>“My wife and two of the boys are beyond hope,” my father answered, with
a groan. “I do not know how it will go with the third. The Lord’s will
be done!”
</p><p>“The Lord’s will be done,” the squire echoed, solemnly. “And now,
Quatermain, listen--my wife’s gone.”
</p><p>“Gone!” my father answered. “Who with?”
</p><p>“With that foreign cousin of hers. It seems from a letter she left me
that she always cared for him, not for me. She married me because she
thought me a rich English milord. Now she has run through my property,
or most of it, and gone. I don’t know where. Luckily, she did not care
to encumber her new career with the child; Stella is left to me.”
</p><p>“That is what comes of marrying a papist, Carson,” said my father. That
was his fault; he was as good and charitable a man as ever lived, but he
was bigoted. “What are you going to do--follow her?”
</p><p>He laughed bitterly in answer.
</p><p>“Follow her!” he said; “why should I follow her? If I met her I might
kill her or him, or both of them, because of the disgrace they have
brought upon my child’s name. No, I never want to look upon her face
again. I trusted her, I tell you, and she has betrayed me. Let her go
and find her fate. But I am going too. I am weary of my life.”
</p><p>“Surely, Carson, surely,” said my father, “you do not mean----”
</p><p>“No, no; not that. Death comes soon enough. But I will leave this
civilized world which is a lie. We will go right away into the wilds, I
and my child, and hide our shame. Where? I don’t know where. Anywhere,
so long as there are no white faces, no smooth educated tongues----”
</p><p>“You are mad, Carson,” my father answered. “How will you live? How can
you educate Stella? Be a man and wear it down.”
</p><p>“I will be a man, and I will wear it down, but not here, Quatermain.
Education! Was not she--that woman who was my wife--was not she highly
educated?--the cleverest woman in the country forsooth. Too clever for
me, Quatermain--too clever by half! No, no, Stella shall be brought
up in a different school; if it be possible, she shall forget her very
name. Good-bye, old friend, good-bye for ever. Do not try to find me
out, henceforth I shall be like one dead to you, to you and all I knew,”
 and he was gone.
</p><p>“Mad,” said my father, with a heavy sigh. “His trouble has turned his
brain. But he will think better of it.”
</p><p>At that moment the nurse came hurrying in and whispered something in his
ear. My father’s face turned deadly pale. He clutched at the table to
support himself, then staggered from the room. My mother was dying!
</p><p>It was some days afterwards, I do not know exactly how long, that my
father took me by the hand and led me upstairs into the big room which
had been my mother’s bedroom. There she lay, dead in her coffin, with
flowers in her hand. Along the wall of the room were arranged three
little white beds, and on each of the beds lay one of my brothers. They
all looked as though they were asleep, and they all had flowers in their
hands. My father told me to kiss them, because I should not see them any
more, and I did so, though I was very frightened. I did not know why.
Then he took me in his arms and kissed me.
</p><p>“The Lord hath given,” he said, “and the Lord hath taken away; blessed
be the name of the Lord.”
</p><p>I cried very much, and he took me downstairs, and after that I have only
a confused memory of men dressed in black carrying heavy burdens towards
the grey churchyard!
</p><p>Next comes a vision of a great ship and wide tossing waters. My father
could no longer bear to live in England after the loss that had fallen
on him, and made up his mind to emigrate to South Africa. We must have
been poor at the time--indeed, I believe that a large portion of
our income went from my father on my mother’s death. At any rate we
travelled with the steerage passengers, and the intense discomfort of
the journey with the rough ways of our fellow emigrants still remain
upon my mind. At last it came to an end, and we reached Africa, which I
was not to leave again for many, many years.
</p><p>In those days civilization had not made any great progress in Southern
Africa. My father went up the country and became a missionary among the
Kaffirs, near to where the town of Cradock now stands, and here I grew
to manhood. There were a few Boer farmers in the neighbourhood, and
gradually a little settlement of whites gathered round our mission
station--a drunken Scotch blacksmith and wheelwright was about the most
interesting character, who, when he was sober, could quote the Scottish
poet Burns and the Ingoldsby Legends, then recently published, literally
by the page. It was from that I contracted a fondness for the latter
amusing writings, which has never left me. Burns I never cared for so
much, probably because of the Scottish dialect which repelled me. What
little education I got was from my father, but I never had much leaning
towards books, nor he much time to teach them to me. On the other hand,
I was always a keen observer of the ways of men and nature. By the time
that I was twenty I could speak Dutch and three or four Kaffir dialects
perfectly, and I doubt if there was anybody in South Africa who
understood native ways of thought and action more completely than I
did. Also I was really a very good shot and horseman, and I think--as,
indeed, my subsequent career proves to have been the case--a great deal
tougher than the majority of men. Though I was then, as now, light and
small, nothing seemed to tire me. I could bear any amount of exposure
and privation, and I never met the native who was my master in feats
of endurance. Of course, all that is different now, I am speaking of my
early manhood.
</p><p>It may be wondered that I did not run absolutely wild in such
surroundings, but I was held back from this by my father’s society. He
was one of the gentlest and most refined men that I ever met; even the
most savage Kaffir loved him, and his influence was a very good one
for me. He used to call himself one of the world’s failures. Would that
there were more such failures. Every morning when his work was done he
would take his prayer-book and, sitting on the little stoep or verandah
of our station, would read the evening psalms to himself. Sometimes
there was not light enough for this, but it made no difference, he knew
them all by heart. When he had finished he would look out across the
cultivated lands where the mission Kaffirs had their huts.
</p><p>But I knew it was not these he saw, but rather the grey English church,
and the graves ranged side by side before the yew near the wicket gate.
</p><p>It was there on the stoep that he died. He had not been well, and one
evening I was talking to him, and his mind went back to Oxfordshire and
my mother. He spoke of her a good deal, saying that she had never been
out of his mind for a single day during all these years, and that he
rejoiced to think he was drawing near that land whither she had gone.
Then he asked me if I remembered the night when Squire Carson came into
the study at the vicarage, and told him that his wife had run away, and
that he was going to change his name and bury himself in some remote
land.
</p><p>I answered that I remembered it perfectly.
</p><p>“I wonder where he went to,” said my father, “and if he and his daughter
Stella are still alive. Well, well! I shall never meet them again. But
life is a strange thing, Allan, and you may. If you ever do, give them
my kind love.”
</p><p>After that I left him. We had been suffering more than usual from the
depredations of the Kaffir thieves, who stole our sheep at night, and,
as I had done before, and not without success, I determined to watch the
kraal and see if I could catch them. Indeed, it was from this habit of
mine of watching at night that I first got my native name of Macumazahn,
which may be roughly translated as “he who sleeps with one eye open.” So
I took my rifle and rose to go. But he called me to him and kissed me on
the forehead, saying, “God bless you, Allan! I hope that you will think
of your old father sometimes, and that you will lead a good and happy
life.”
</p><p>I remember that I did not much like his tone at the time, but set it
down to an attack of low spirits, to which he grew very subject as the
years went on. I went down to the kraal and watched till within an hour
of sunrise; then, as no thieves appeared, returned to the station. As I
came near I was astonished to see a figure sitting in my father’s chair.
At first I thought it must be a drunken Kaffir, then that my father had
fallen asleep there.
</p><p>And so he had,--for he was dead!
