<p>Yvette did not keep her promise.  The few March days were lovely,
and she let them slip.  She had a curious reluctance always,
towards taking action, or making any real move of her own.  She
always wanted someone else to make a move for her, as if she did
not want to play her own game of life.</p>

<p>She lived as usual, went out to her friends, to parties, and danced
with the undiminished Leo.  She wanted to go up and say goodbye to
the gipsies.  She wanted to.  And nothing prevented her.</p>

<p>On the Friday afternoon especially she wanted to go.  It was sunny,
and the last yellow crocuses down the drive were in full blaze,
wide open, the first bees rolling in them.  The Papple rushed under
the stone bridge, uncannily full, nearly filling the arches.  There
was the scent of a mezereon tree.</p>

<p>And she felt too lazy, too lazy, too lazy.  She strayed in the
garden by the river, half dreamy, expecting something.  While the
gleam of spring sun lasted, she would be out of doors.  Indoors
Granny, sitting back like some awful old prelate, in her bulk of
black silk and her white lace cap, was warming her feet by the
fire, and hearing everything that Aunt Nell had to say.  Friday was
Aunt Nell's day.  She usually came for lunch, and left after an
early tea.  So the mother and the large, rather common daughter,
who was a widow at the age of forty, sat gossiping by the fire,
while Aunt Cissie prowled in and out.  Friday was the rector's day
for going to town: it was also the housemaid's half day.</p>

<p>Yvette sat on a wooden seat in the garden, only a few feet above
the bank of the swollen river, which rolled a strange, uncanny mass
of water.  The crocuses were passing in the ornamental beds, the
grass was dark green where it was mown, the laurels looked a little
brighter.  Aunt Cissie appeared at the top of the porch steps, and
called to ask if Yvette wanted that early cup of tea.  Because of
the river just below, Yvette could not hear what Aunt Cissie said,
but she guessed, and shook her head.  An early cup of tea, indoors,
when the sun actually shone?  No thanks!</p>

<p>She was conscious of her gipsy, as she sat there musing in the sun.
Her soul had the half painful, half easing knack of leaving her,
and straying away to some place, to somebody that had caught her
imagination.  Some days she would be all the Framleys, even though
she did not go near them.  Some days, she was all the time in
spirit with the Eastwoods.  And today it was the gipsies.  She was
up at their encampment in the quarry.  She saw the man hammering
his copper, lifting his head to look at the road; and the children
playing in the horse-shelter: and the women, the gipsy's wife and
the strong, elderly woman, coming home with their packs, along with
the elderly man.  For this afternoon, she felt intensely that THAT
was home for her: the gipsy camp, the fire, the stool, the man with
the hammer, the old crone.</p>

<p>It was part of her nature, to get these fits of yearning for some
place she knew; to be in a certain place; with somebody who meant
home to her.  This afternoon it was the gipsy camp.  And the man in
the green jersey made it home to her.  Just to be where he was,
that was to be at home.  The caravans, the brats, the other women:
everything was natural to her, her home, as if she had been born
there.  She wondered if the gipsy was aware of her: if he could see
her sitting on the stool by the fire; if he would lift his head and
see her as she rose, looking at him slowly and significantly,
turning towards the steps of his caravan.  Did he know?  Did he
know?</p>

<p>Vaguely she looked up the steep of dark larch trees north of the
house, where unseen the road climbed, going towards the Head.
There was nothing, and her glance strayed down again.  At the foot
of the slope the river turned, thrown back harshly, ominously,
against the low rocks across stream, then pouring past the garden
to the bridge.  It was unnaturally full, and whitey-muddy, and
ponderous, &quot;Listen for the voice of water,&quot; she said to herself.
&quot;No need to listen for it, if the voice means the noise!&quot;</p>

<p>And again she looked at the swollen river breaking angrily as it
came round the bend.  Above it the black-looking kitchen garden
hung, and the hard-natured fruit trees.  Everything was on the
tilt, facing south and south-west, for the sun.  Behind, above the
house and the kitchen garden hung the steep little wood of
withered-seeming larches.  The gardener was working in the kitchen
garden, high up there, by the edge of the larch-wood.</p>

<p>She heard a call.  It was Aunt Cissie and Aunt Nell.  They were on
the drive, waving Goodbye!  Yvette waved back.  Then Aunt Cissie,
pitching her voice against the waters, called:</p>

<p>&quot;I shan't be long.  Don't forget Granny is alone!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right!&quot; screamed Yvette rather ineffectually.</p>

<p>And she sat on her bench and watched the two undignified, long-
coated women walk slowly over the bridge and begin the curving
climb on the opposite slope, Aunt Nell carrying a sort of suit-case
in which she brought a few goods for Granny and took back
vegetables or whatever the rectory garden or cupboard was yielding.
Slowly the two figures diminished, on the whitish, up-curving road,
laboring slowly up toward Papplewick village.  Aunt Cissie was
going as far as the village for something.</p>

<p>The sun was yellowing to decline.  What a pity!  Oh what a pity the
sunny day was going, and she would have to turn indoors, to those
hateful rooms, and Granny!  Aunt Cissie would be back directly: it
was past five.  And all the others would be arriving from town,
rather irritable and tired, soon after six.</p>

<p>As she looked uneasily round, she heard, across the running of
water, the sharp noise of a horse and cart rattling on the road
hidden in the larch trees.  The gardener was looking up too.
Yvette turned away again, lingering, strolling by the full river a
few paces, unwilling to go in; glancing up the road to see if Aunt
Cissie were coming.  If she saw her, she would go indoors.</p>

<p>She heard somebody shouting, and looked round.  Down the path
through the larch-trees the gipsy was bounding.  The gardener, away
beyond, was also running.  Simultaneously she became aware of a
great roar, which, before she could move, accumulated to a vast
deafening snarl.  The gipsy was gesticulating.  She looked round,
behind her.</p>

<p>And to her horror and amazement, round the bend of the river she
saw a shaggy, tawny wavefront of water advancing like a wall of
lions.  The roaring sound wiped out everything.  She was powerless,
too amazed and wonder-struck, she wanted to see it.</p>

<p>Before she could think twice, it was near, a roaring cliff of
water.  She almost fainted with horror.  She heard the scream of
the gipsy, and looked up to see him bounding upon her, his black
eyes starting out of his head.</p>

<p>&quot;Run!&quot; he screamed, seizing her arm.</p>

<p>And in the instant the first wave was washing her feet from under
her, swirling, in the insane noise, which suddenly for some reason
seemed like stillness, with a devouring flood over the garden.  The
horrible mowing of water!</p>

<p>The gipsy dragged her heavily, lurching, plunging, but still
keeping foot-hold both of them, towards the house.  She was barely
conscious: as if the flood was in her soul.</p>

<p>There was one grass-banked terrace of the garden, near the path
round the house.  The gipsy clawed his way up this terrace to the
dry level of the path, dragging her after him, and sprang with her
past the windows to the porch steps.  Before they got there, a new
great surge of water came mowing, mowing trees down even, and mowed
them down too.</p>

<p>Yvette felt herself gone in an agonising mill-race of icy water,
whirled, with only the fearful grip of the gipsy's hand on her
wrist.  They were both down and gone.  She felt a dull but stunning
bruise somewhere.</p>

<p>Then he pulled her up.  He was up, streaming forth water, clinging
to the stem of the great wisteria that grew against the wall,
crushed against the wall by the water.  Her head was above water,
he held her arm till it seemed dislocated: but she could not get
her footing.  With a ghastly sickness like a dream, she struggled
and struggled, and could not get her feet.  Only his hand was
locked on her wrist.</p>

<p>He dragged her nearer till her one hand caught his leg.  He nearly
went down again.  But the wisteria held him, and he pulled her up
to him.  She clawed at him, horribly, and got to her feet, he
hanging on like a man torn in two, to the wisteria trunk.</p>

<p>The water was above her knees.  The man and she looked into each
other's ghastly streaming faces.</p>

<p>&quot;Get to the steps!&quot; he screamed.</p>

<p>It was only just round the corner: four strides!  She looked at
him: she could not go.  His eyes glared on her like a tiger's, and
he pushed her from him.  She clung to the wall, and the water
seemed to abate a little.  Round the corner she staggered, but
staggering, reeled and was pitched up against the cornice of the
balustrade of the porch steps, the man after her.</p>

<p>They got on to the steps, when another roar was heard amid the
roar, and the wall of the house shook.  Up heaved the water round
their legs again, and the gipsy had opened the hall door.  In they
poured with the water, reeling to the stairs.  And as they did so,
they saw the short but strange bulk of Granny emerge in the hall,
away down from the dining-room door.  She had her hands lifted and
clawing, as the first water swirled round her legs, and her coffin-
like mouth was opened in a hoarse scream.</p>

<p>Yvette was blind to everything but the stairs.  Blind, unconscious
of everything save the steps rising beyond the water, she clambered
up like a wet, shuddering cat, in a state of unconsciousness.  It
was not till she was on the landing, dripping and shuddering till
she could not stand erect, clinging to the banisters, while the
house shook and the water raved below, that she was aware of the
sodden gipsy, in paroxysms of coughing at the head of the stairs,
his cap gone, his black hair over his eyes, peering between his
washed-down hair at the sickening heave of water below, in the
hall.  Yvette, fainting, looked too, and saw Granny bob up, like a
strange float, her face purple, her blind blue eyes bolting, spume
hissing from her mouth.  One old purple hand clawed at a banister
rail, and held for a moment, showing the glint of a wedding ring.</p>

<p>The gipsy, who had coughed himself free and pushed back his hair,
said to that awful float-like face below:</p>

<p>&quot;Not good enough!  Not good enough!&quot;</p>

<p>With a low thud like thunder, the house was struck again, and
shuttered, and a strange cracking, rattling, spitting noise began.
Up heaved the water like a sea.  The hand was gone, all sign of
anything was gone, but upheaving water.</p>

<p>Yvette turned in blind unconscious frenzy, staggering like a wet
cat to the upper stair-case, and climbing swiftly.  It was not till
she was at the door of her room that she stopped, paralysed by the
sound of a sickening, tearing crash, while the house swayed.</p>

<p>&quot;The house is coming down!&quot; yelled the green-white face of the
gipsy, in her face.</p>

<p>He glared into her crazed face.</p>

<p>&quot;Where is the chimney? the back chimney? - which room?  The chimney
will stand - &quot;</p>

<p>He glared with strange ferocity into her face, forcing her to
understand.  And she nodded with a strange, crazed poise, nodded
quite serenely, saying:  &quot;In here!  In here!  It's all right.&quot;</p>

<p>They entered her room, which had a narrow fire-place.  It was a
back room with two windows, one on each side the great chimney-
flue.  The gipsy, coughing bitterly and trembling in every limb,
went to the window to look out.</p>

<p>Below, between the house and the steep rise of the hill, was a wild
mill-race, of water rushing with refuse, including Rover's green
dog-kennel.  The gipsy coughed and coughed, and gazed down blankly.
Tree after tree went down, mown by the water, which must have been
ten feet deep.</p>

<p>Shuddering and pressing his sodden arms on his sodden breast, a
look of resignation on his livid face, he turned to Yvette.  A
fearful tearing noise tore the house, then there was a deep, watery
explosion.  Something had gone down, some part of the house, the
floor heaved and wavered beneath them.  For some moments both were
suspended, stupefied.  Then he roused.</p>

<p>&quot;Not good enough!  Not good enough!  This will stand.  This here
will stand.  See that chimney! like a tower.  Yes!  All right!  All
right.  You take your clothes off and go to bed.  You'll die of the
cold.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's all right!  It's quite all right!&quot; she said to him, sitting
on a chair and looking up into his face with her white, insane
little face, round which the hair was plastered.</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; he cried.  &quot;No!  Take your things off and I rub you with this
towel.  I rub myself.  If the house falls then die warm.  If it
don't fall, then live, not die of pneumonia.&quot;</p>

<p>Coughing, shuddering violently, he pulled up his jersey hem and
wrestled with all his shuddering, cold-cracked might, to get off
his wet, tight jersey.</p>

<p>&quot;Help me!&quot; he cried, his face muffled.</p>

<p>She seized the edge of the jersey, obediently, and pulled with all
her might.  The garment came over his head, and he stood in his
braces.</p>

<p>&quot;Take your things off!  Rub with this towel!&quot; he commanded
ferociously, the savageness of the war on him.  And like a thing
obsessed, he pushed himself out of his trousers, and got out of his
wet, clinging shirt, emerging slim and livid, shuddering in every
fibre with cold and shock.</p>

<p>He seized a towel, and began quickly to rub his body, his teeth
chattering like plates rattling together.  Yvette dimly saw it was
wise.  She tried to get out of her dress.  He pulled the horrible
wet death-gripping thing off her, then, resuming his rubbing, went
to the door, tip-toeing on the wet floor.</p>

<p>There he stood, naked, towel in hand, petrified.  He looked west,
towards where the upper landing window had been, and was looking
into the sunset, over an insane sea of waters, bristling with
uptorn trees and refuse.  The end corner of the house, where porch
had been, and the stairs, had gone.  The wall had fallen, leaving
the floor sticking out.  The stairs had gone.</p>

<p>Motionless, he watched the water.  A cold wind blew in upon him.
He clenched his rattling teeth with a great effort of will, and
turned into the room again, closing the door.</p>

<p>Yvette, naked, shuddering so much that she was sick, was trying to
wipe herself dry.</p>

<p>&quot;All right!&quot; he cried.  &quot;All right!  The water don't rise no more!
All right!&quot;</p>

<p>With his towel he began to rub her, himself shaking all over, but
holding her gripped by the shoulder, and slowly, numbedly rubbing
her tender body, even trying to rub up into some dryness the
pitiful hair of her small head.  Suddenly he left off.</p>

<p>&quot;Better lie in the bed,&quot; he commanded, &quot;I want to rub myself.&quot;</p>

<p>His teeth went snap-snap-snap-snap, in great snaps, cutting off his
words.  Yvette crept shaking and semi-conscious into her bed.  He,
making strained efforts to hold himself still and rub himself warm,
went again to the north window, to look out.</p>

<p>The water had risen a little.  The sun had gone down, and there was
a reddish glow.  He rubbed his hair into a black, wet tangle, then
paused for breath, in a sudden access of shuddering, then looked
out again, then rubbed again on his breast, and began to cough
afresh, because of the water he had swallowed.  His towel was red:
he had hurt himself somewhere: but he felt nothing.</p>

<p>There was still the strange huge noise of water, and the horrible
bump of things bumping against the walls.  The wind was rising with
sundown, cold and hard.  The house shook with explosive thuds, and
weird, weird frightening noises came up.</p>

<p>A terror creeping over his soul, he went again to the door.  The
wind, roaring with the waters, blew in as he opened it.  Through
the awesome gap in the house he saw the world, the waters, the
chaos of horrible waters, the twilight, the perfect new moon high
above the sunset, a faint thing, and clouds pushing dark into the
sky, on the cold, blustery wind.</p>

<p>Clenching his teeth again, fear mingling with resignation, or
fatalism, in his soul, he went into the room and closed the door,
picking up her towel to see if it were drier than his own, and less
blood-stained, again rubbing his head, and going to the window.</p>

<p>He turned away, unable to control his spasms of shivering.  Yvette
had disappeared right under the bed-clothes, and nothing of her was
visible but a shivering mound under the white quilt.  He laid his
hand on this shivering mound, as if for company.  It did not stop
shivering.</p>

<p>&quot;All right!&quot; he said.  &quot;All right!  Water's going down.&quot;</p>

<p>She suddenly uncovered her head and peered out at him from a white
face.  She peered into his greenish, curiously calm face, semi-
conscious.  His teeth were chattering unheeded, as he gazed down at
her, his black eyes still full of the fire of life and a certain
vagabond calm of fatalistic resignation.</p>

<p>&quot;Warm me!&quot; she moaned, with chattering teeth.  &quot;Warm me!  I shall
die of shivering.&quot;</p>

<p>A terrible convulsion went through her curled-up white body, enough
indeed to rupture her and cause her to die.</p>

<p>The gipsy nodded, and took her in his arms, and held her in a clasp
like a vice, to still his own shuddering.  He himself was
shuddering fearfully, and only semi-conscious.  It was the shock.</p>

<p>The vice-like grip of his arms round her seemed to her the only
stable point in her consciousness.  It was a fearful relief to her
heart, which was strained to bursting.  And though his body,
wrapped round her strange and lithe and powerful, like tentacles,
rippled with shuddering as an electric current, still the rigid
tension of the muscles that held her clenched steadied them both,
and gradually the sickening violence of the shuddering, caused by
shock, abated, in his body first, then in hers, and the warmth
revived between them.  And as it roused, their tortured, semi-
conscious minds became unconscious, they passed away into sleep.</p>
