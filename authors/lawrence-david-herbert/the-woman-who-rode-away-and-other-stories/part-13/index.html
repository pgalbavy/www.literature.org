<p>At seventy-two, Pauline Attenborough could still sometimes be
mistaken, in the half-light, for thirty.  She really was a
wonderfully-preserved woman, of perfect chic.  Of course it helps a
great deal to have the right frame.  She would be an exquisite
skeleton, and her skull would be an exquisite skull, like that of
some Etruscan woman with feminine charm still in the swerve of the
bone and the pretty, na&iuml;ve teeth.</p>

<p>Mrs Attenborough's face was of the perfect oval and slightly flat
type that wears best.  There is no flesh to sag.  Her nose rode
serenely, in its finely-bridged curve.  Only the big grey eyes were
a tiny bit prominent, on the surface of her face, and they gave her
away most.  The bluish lids were heavy, as if they ached sometimes
with the strain of keeping the eyes beneath them arch and bright;
and at the corners of the eyes were fine little wrinkles which
would slacken into haggardness, then be pulled up tense again to
that bright, gay look like a Leonardo woman who really could laugh
outright.</p>

<p>Her niece Cecilia was perhaps the only person in the world who was
aware of the invisible little wire which connected Pauline's eye-
wrinkles with Pauline's willpower.  Only Cecilia consciously
watched the eyes go haggard and old and tired, and remain so, for
hours; until Robert came home.  Then ping! - the mysterious little
wire that worked between Pauline's will and her face went taut, the
weary, haggard, prominent eyes suddenly began to gleam, the eyelids
arched, the queer, curved eyebrows which floated in such frail
arches on Pauline's forehead began to gather a mocking significance,
and you had the REAL lovely lady, in all her charm.</p>

<p>She really had the secret of everlasting youth; that is to say, she
could don her youth again like an eagle.  But she was sparing of
it.  She was wise enough not to try being young for too many
people.  Her son Robert, in the evenings, and Sir Wilfrid Knipe
sometimes in the afternoon to tea; then occasional visitors on
Sunday, when Robert was home - for these she was her lovely and
changeless self, that age could not wither, nor custom stale; so
bright and kindly and yet subtly mocking, like Mona Lisa, who knew
a thing or two.  But Pauline knew more, so she needn't be smug at
all.  She could laugh that lovely, mocking Bacchante laugh of hers,
which was at the same time never malicious, always good-naturedly
tolerant, both of virtues and vices - the former, of course, taking
much more tolerating.  So she suggested, roguishly.</p>

<p>Only with her niece Cecilia she did not trouble to keep up the
glamour.  Ciss was not very observant, anyhow; and, more than that,
she was plain; more still, she was in love with Robert; and most of
all, she was thirty, and dependent on her aunt Pauline.  Oh,
Cecilia - why make music for her?</p>

<p>Cecilia, called by her aunt and by her cousin Robert just Ciss,
like a cat spitting, was a big, dark-complexioned, pug-faced young
woman who very rarely spoke, and when she did couldn't get it out.
She was the daughter of a poor Congregational clergyman who had
been, while he lived, brother to Ronald, Aunt Pauline's husband.
Ronald and the Congregational minister were both well dead, and
Aunt Pauline had had charge of Ciss for the last five years.</p>

<p>They lived all together in a quite exquisite though rather small
Queen Anne house some twenty-five miles out of town, secluded in a
little dale, and surrounded by small but very quaint and pleasant
grounds.  It was an ideal place and an ideal life for Aunt Pauline,
at the age of seventy-two.  When the kingfishers flashed up the
little stream in her garden, going under the alders, something
still flashed in her heart.  She was that kind of woman.</p>

<p>Robert, who was two years older than Ciss, went every day to town,
to his chambers in one of the Inns.  He was a barrister, and, to
his secret but very deep mortification, he earned about a hundred
pounds a year.  He simply COULDN'T get above that figure, though it
was rather easy to get below it.  Of course, it didn't matter.
Pauline had money.  But then, what was Pauline's was Pauline's, and
though she could give almost lavishly, still, one was always aware
of having a LOVELY and UNDESERVED present made to one.  Presents
are so much nicer when they're undeserved, Aunt Pauline would say.</p>

<p>Robert, too, was plain, and almost speechless.  He was medium
sized, rather broad and stout, though not fat.  Only his creamy,
clean-shaven face was rather fat, and sometimes suggestive of an
Italian priest, in its silence and its secrecy.  But he had grey
eyes like his mother, but very shy and uneasy, not bold like hers.
Perhaps Ciss was the only person who fathomed his awful shyness and
malaise, his habitual feeling that he was in the wrong place:
almost like a soul that has got into a wrong body.  But he never
did anything about it.  He went up to Chambers, and read law.  It
was, however, all the weird old processes that interested him.  He
had, unknown to everybody but his mother, a quite extraordinary
collection of old Mexican legal documents - reports of processes and
trials, pleas, accusations: the weird and awful mixture of
ecclesiastical law and common law in seventeenth-century Mexico.
He had started a study in this direction through coming across the
report of a trial of two English sailors, for murder, in Mexico, in
1620, and he had gone on, when the next document was an accusation
against a Don Miguel Estrada for seducing one of the nuns of the
Sacred Heart Convent in Oaxaca in 1680.</p>

<p>Pauline and her son Robert had wonderful evenings with these old
papers.  The lovely lady knew a little Spanish.  She even looked a
trifle Spanish herself, with a high comb and a marvellous dark-
brown shawl embroidered in thick silvery silk embroidery.  So she
would sit at the perfect old table, soft as velvet in its deep
brown surface, a high comb in her hair, ear-rings with dropping
pendants in her ears, her arms bare and still beautiful, a few
strings of pearls round her throat, a puce velvet dress on and this
or another beautiful shawl, and by candlelight she looked, yes, a
Spanish high-bred beauty of thirty-two or three.  She set the
candles to give her face just the chiaroscuro she knew suited her;
her high chair that rose behind her face was done in old green
brocade, against which her face emerged like a Christmas rose.</p>

<p>They were always three at table, and they always drank a bottle of
champagne: Pauline two glasses, Ciss two glasses, Robert the rest.
The lovely lady sparkled and was radiant.  Ciss, her black hair
bobbed, her broad shoulders in a very nice and becoming dress that
Aunt Pauline had helped her to make, stared from her aunt to her
cousin and back again, with rather confused, mute hazel eyes, and
played the part of an audience suitably impressed.  She WAS
impressed, somewhere, all the time.  And even rendered speechless
by Pauline's brilliancy, even after five years.  But at the bottom
of her consciousness was the data of as weird a document as Robert
ever studied: all the things she knew about her aunt and her
cousin.</p>

<p>Robert was always a gentleman, with an old-fashioned, punctilious
courtesy that covered his shyness quite completely.  He was, and
Ciss knew it, more confused than shy.  He was worse than she was.
Cecilia's own confusion dated from only five years back.  Robert's
must have started before he was born.  In the lovely lady's womb he
must have felt VERY confused.</p>

<p>He paid all his attention to his mother, drawn to her as a humble
flower to the sun.  And yet, priest-like, he was all the time
aware, with the tail of his consciousness, that Ciss was there, and
that she was a bit shut out of it, and that something wasn't right.
He was aware of the third consciousness in the room.  Whereas to
Pauline, her niece Cecilia was an appropriate part of her own
setting, rather than a distinct consciousness.</p>

<p>Robert took coffee with his mother and Ciss in the warm drawing-
room, where all the furniture was so lovely, all collectors' pieces - 
Mrs Attenborough had made her own money, dealing privately in
pictures and furniture and rare things from barbaric countries - and
the three talked desultorily till about eight or half-past.  It was
very pleasant, very cosy, very homely even; Pauline made a real
home cosiness out of so much elegant material.  The chat was
simple, and nearly always bright.  Pauline was her REAL self,
emanating a friendly mockery and an odd, ironic gaiety - till there
came a little pause.</p>

<p>At which Ciss always rose and said good-night, and carried out the
coffee-tray, to prevent Burnett from intruding any more.</p>

<p>And then! ah, then, the lovely, glowing intimacy of the evening,
between mother and son, when they deciphered manuscripts and
discussed points, Pauline with that eagerness of a girl for which
she was famous.  And it was quite genuine.  In some mysterious way
she had SAVED UP her power for being thrilled, in connection with a
man.  Robert, solid, rather quiet and subdued, seemed like the
elder of the two - almost like a priest with a young girl pupil.
And that was rather how he felt.</p>

<p>Ciss had a flat for herself just across the courtyard, over the old
coach-house and stables.  There were no horses.  Robert kept his
car in the coach-house.  Ciss had three very nice rooms up there,
stretching along in a row one after the other, and she had got used
to the ticking of the stable clock.</p>

<p>But sometimes she did not go to her rooms.  In the summer she would
sit on the lawn, and from the open window of the drawing-room
upstairs she would hear Pauline's wonderful, heart-searching laugh.
And in winter the young woman would put on a thick coat and walk
slowly to the little balustraded bridge over the stream, and then
look back at the three lighted windows of that drawing-room where
mother and son were so happy together.</p>

<p>Ciss loved Robert, and she believed that Pauline intended the two
of them to marry - when she was dead.  But poor Robert, he was so
convulsed with shyness already, with man or woman.  What would he
be when his mother was dead? - in a dozen more years.  He would be
just a shell, the shell of a man who had never lived.</p>

<p>The strange, unspoken sympathy of the young with one another, when
they are overshadowed by the old, was one of the bonds between
Robert and Ciss.  But another bond, which Ciss did not know how to
draw tight, was the bond of passion.  Poor Robert was by nature a
passionate man.  His silence and his agonised, though hidden,
shyness were both the result of a secret physical passionateness.
And how Pauline could play on this!  Ah, Ciss was not blind to the
eyes which he fixed on his mother - eyes fascinated yet humiliated,
full of shame.  He was ashamed that he was not a man.  And he did
not love his mother.  He was fascinated by her.  Completely
fascinated.  And for the rest, paralysed in a life-long confusion.</p>

<p>Ciss stayed in the garden till the lights leapt up in Pauline's
bedroom - about ten o'clock.  The lovely lady had retired.  Robert
would now stay another hour or so, alone.  Then he, too, would
retire.  Ciss, in the dark outside, sometimes wished she could
creep up to him and say:  &quot;Oh, Robert!  It's all wrong!&quot;  But Aunt
Pauline would hear.  And, anyhow, Ciss couldn't do it.  She went
off to her own rooms, once more, once more, and so for ever.</p>

<p>In the morning coffee was brought up on a tray to each of the rooms
of the three relatives.  Ciss had to be at Sir Wilfrid Knipe's at
nine o'clock, to give two hours' lessons to his little grand-
daughter.  It was her sole serious occupation, except that she
played the piano for the love of it.  Robert set off to town about
nine.  And as a rule, Aunt Pauline appeared to lunch, though
sometimes not till tea-time.  When she appeared, she looked fresh
and young.  But she was inclined to fade rather rapidly, like a
flower without water, in the daytime.  Her hour was the candle
hour.</p>

<p>So she always rested in the afternoon.  When the sun shone, if
possible she took a sun-bath.  This was one of her secrets.  Her
lunch was very light; she could take her sun-and-air-bath before
noon or after, as it pleased her.  Often it was in the afternoon,
when the sun shone very warmly into a queer little yew-walled
square just behind the stables.  Here Ciss stretched out the lying-
chair and rugs, and put the light parasol handy in the silent
little enclosure of thick dark yew-hedges beyond the old red walls
of the unused stables.  And hither came the lovely lady with her
book.  Ciss then had to be on guard in one of her own rooms, should
her aunt, who was very keen-eared, hear a footstep.</p>

<p>One afternoon it occurred to Cecilia that she herself might while
away this rather long afternoon hour by taking a sun-bath.  She was
growing restive.  The thought of the flat roof of the stable
buildings, to which she could climb from a loft at the end, started
her on a new adventure.  She often went on to the roof; she had to,
to wind up the stable clock, which was a job she had assumed to
herself.  Now she took a rug, climbed out under the heavens, looked
at the sky and the great elm-tops, looked at the sun, then took off
her things and lay down perfectly securely, in a corner of the roof
under the parapet, full in the sun.</p>

<p>It was rather lovely, to bask all one's length like this in warm
sun and air.  Yes, it was very lovely!  It even seemed to melt some
of the hard bitterness of her heart, some of that core of unspoken
resentment which never dissolved.  Luxuriously, she spread herself,
so that the sun should touch her limbs fully, fully.  If she had no
other lover, she should have the sun!  She rolled over voluptuously.</p>

<p>And suddenly her heart stood still in her body, and her hair almost
rose on end as a voice said very softly, musingly, in her ear:</p>

<p>&quot;No, Henry dear!  It was not my fault you died instead of marrying
that Claudia.  No, darling.  I was quite, quite willing for you to
marry her, unsuitable though she was.&quot;</p>

<p>Cecilia sank down on her rug, powerless and perspiring with dread.
That awful voice, so soft, so musing, yet so unnatural.  Not a
human voice at all.  Yet there must, there MUST be someone on the
roof!  Oh, how unspeakably awful!</p>

<p>She lifted her weak head and peeped across the sloping leads.
Nobody!  The chimneys were too narrow to shelter anybody.  There
was nobody on the roof.  Then it must be someone in the trees, in
the elms.  Either that, or - terror unspeakable - a bodiless voice!
She reared her head a little higher.</p>

<p>And as she did so, came the voice again:</p>

<p>&quot;No, darling!  I told you you would tire of her in six months.  And
you see it was true, dear.  It was true, true, true!  I wanted to
spare you that.  So it wasn't I who made you feel weak and
disabled, wanting that very silly Claudia - poor thing, she looked
so woebegone afterwards! - wanting her and not wanting her.  You got
yourself into that perplexity, my dear.  I only warned you.  What
else could I do?  And you lost your spirit and died without ever
knowing me again.  It was bitter, bitter - &quot;</p>

<p>The voice faded away.  Cecilia subsided weakly on to her rug, after
the anguished tension of listening.  Oh, it was awful.  The sun
shone, the sky was blue, all seemed so lovely and afternoony and
summery.  And yet, oh, horror! - she was going to be forced to
believe in the supernatural!  And she loathed the supernatural,
ghosts and voices and rappings and all the rest.</p>

<p>But that awful, creepy, bodiless voice, with its rusty sort of
whispers of an overtone!  It had something so fearfully familiar in
it, too!  And yet was so utterly uncanny.  Poor Cecilia could only
lie there unclothed, and so all the more agonisingly helpless,
inert, collapsed in sheer dread.</p>

<p>And then she heard the thing sigh! - a deep sigh that seemed weirdly
familiar, yet was not human.  &quot;Ah well, ah well! the heart must
bleed.  Better it should bleed than break.  It is grief, grief!
But it wasn't my fault, dear.  And Robert could marry our poor,
dull Ciss tomorrow, if he wanted her.  But he doesn't care about
it, so why force him into anything?&quot;  The sounds were very uneven,
sometimes only a husky sort of whisper.  Listen!  Listen!</p>

<p>Cecilia was about to give vent to loud and piercing screams of
hysteria, when the last two sentences arrested her.  All her
caution and her cunning sprang alert.  It was Aunt Pauline!  It
MUST be Aunt Pauline, practising ventriloquism, or something like
that.  What a devil she was!</p>

<p>Where was she?  She must be lying down there, right below where
Cecilia herself was lying.  And it was either some fiend's trick of
ventriloquism, or else thought-transference.  The sounds were very
uneven; sometimes quite inaudible, sometimes only a brushing sort
of noise.  Ciss listened intently.  No, it could not be
ventriloquism.  It was worse: some form of thought-transference
that conveyed itself like sound.  Some horror of that sort!
Cecilia still lay weak and inert, too terrified to move; but she
was growing calmer with suspicion.  It was some diabolic trick of
that unnatural woman.</p>

<p>But WHAT a devil of a woman!  She even knew that she, Cecilia, had
mentally accused her of killing her son Henry.  Poor Henry was
Robert's elder brother, twelve years older than Robert.  He had
died suddenly when he was twenty-two, after an awful struggle with
himself, because he was passionately in love with a young and very
good-looking actress, and his mother had humorously despised him
for the attachment.  So he had caught some sudden ordinary disease,
but the poison had gone to his brain and killed him before he ever
regained consciousness.  Ciss knew the few facts from her own
father.  And lately she had been thinking that Pauline was going to
kill Robert as she had killed Henry.  It was clear murder: a mother
murdering her sensitive sons, who were fascinated by her: the
Circe!</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose I may as well get up,&quot; murmured the dim, unbreathing
voice.  &quot;Too much sun is as bad as too little.  Enough sun, enough
love-thrill, enough proper food, and not too much of any of them,
and a woman might live for ever.  I verily believe, for ever.  If
she absorbs as much vitality as she expends.  Or perhaps a trifle
more!&quot;</p>

<p>It was certainly Aunt Pauline!  How - how terrible!  She, Ciss, was
hearing Aunt Pauline's thoughts.  Oh, how ghastly!  Aunt Pauline
was sending out her thoughts in a sort of radio, and she, Ciss, had
to HEAR what her aunt was thinking.  How ghastly!  How insufferable!
One of them would surely have to die.</p>

<p>She twisted and lay inert and crumpled, staring vacantly in front
of her.  Vacantly!  Vacantly!  And her eyes were staring almost
into a hole.  She was staring in it unseeing, a hole going down in
the corner, from the lead gutter.  It meant nothing to her.  Only
it frightened her a little more.</p>

<p>When suddenly, out of the hole came a sigh and a last whisper:  &quot;Ah
well! Pauline!  Get up, it's enough for to-day.&quot;  Good God!  Out of
the hole of the rain-pipe!  The rain-pipe was acting as a speaking-
tube!  Impossible!  No, quite possible.  She had read of it even in
some book.  And Aunt Pauline, like the old and guilty woman she was
talked aloud to herself.  That was it!</p>

<p>A sullen exultance sprang in Ciss's breast.  THAT was why she would
never have anybody, not even Robert, in her bedroom.  That was why
she never dozed in a chair, never sat absent-minded anywhere, but
went to her room, and kept to her room, except when she roused
herself to be alert.  When she slackened off she talked to herself!
She talked in a soft little crazy voice to herself.  But she was
not crazy.  It was only her thoughts murmuring themselves aloud.</p>

<p>So she had qualms about poor Henry!  Well she might have!  Ciss
believed that Aunt Pauline had loved her big, handsome, brilliant
first-born much more than she loved Robert, and that his death had
been a terrible blow and a chagrin to her.  Poor Robert had been
only ten years old when Henry died.  Since then he had been the
substitute.</p>

<p>Ah, how awful!</p>

<p>But Aunt Pauline was a strange woman.  She had left her husband
when Henry was a small child, some years even before Robert was
born.  There was no quarrel.  Sometimes she saw her husband again,
quite amiably, but a little mockingly.  And she even gave him
money.</p>

<p>For Pauline earned all her own.  Her father had been a Consul in
the East and in Naples, and a devoted collector of beautiful exotic
things.  When he died, soon after his grandson Henry was born, he
left his collection of treasures to his daughter.  And Pauline, who
had really a passion and a genius for loveliness, whether in
texture or form or colour, had laid the basis of her fortune on her
father's collection.  She had gone on collecting, buying where she
could, and selling to collectors or to museums.  She was one of the
first to sell old, weird African figures to the museums, and ivory
carvings from New Guinea.  She bought Renoir as soon as she saw his
pictures.  But not Rousseau.  And all by herself she made a
fortune.</p>

<p>After her husband died she had not married again.  She was not even
KNOWN to have had lovers.  If she did have lovers, it was not among
the men who admired her most and paid her devout and open
attendance.  To these she was a &quot;friend&quot;.</p>

<p>Cecilia slipped on her clothes and caught up her rug, hastening
carefully down the ladder to the loft.  As she descended she heard
the ringing, musical call:  &quot;All right, Ciss&quot; - which meant that the
lovely lady was finished, and returning to the house.  Even her
voice was wonderfully young and sonorous, beautifully balanced and
self-possessed.  So different from the little voice in which she
talked to herself.  THAT was much more the voice of an old woman.</p>

<p>Ciss hastened round to the yew enclosure, where lay the comfortable
chaise longue with the various delicate rugs.  Everything Pauline
had was choice, to the fine straw mat on the floor.  The great yew
walls were beginning to cast long shadows.  Only in the corner
where the rugs tumbled their delicate colours was there hot, still
sunshine.</p>

<p>The rugs folded up, the chair lifted away, Cecilia stooped to look
at the mouth of the rain-pipe.  There it was, in the corner, under
a little hood of masonry and just projecting from the thick leaves
of the creeper on the wall.  If Pauline, lying there, turned her
face towards the wall, she would speak into the very mouth of the
tube.  Cecilia was reassured.  She had heard her aunt's thoughts
indeed, but by no uncanny agency.</p>

<p>That evening, as if aware of something, Pauline was a little
quieter than usual, though she looked her own serene, rather
mysterious self.  And after coffee she said to Robert and Ciss:</p>

<p>&quot;I'm so sleepy.  The sun has made me so sleepy.  I feel full of
sunshine like a bee.  I shall go to bed, if you don't mind.  You
two sit and have a talk.&quot;</p>

<p>Cecilia looked quickly at her cousin.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps you'd rather be alone?&quot; she said to him.</p>

<p>&quot;No - no,&quot; he replied.  &quot;Do keep me company for a while, if it
doesn't bore you.&quot;</p>

<p>The windows were open, the scent of honeysuckle wafted in, with the
sound of an owl.  Robert smoked in silence.  There was a sort of
despair in his motionless, rather squat body.  He looked like a
caryatid bearing a weight.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you remember Cousin Henry?&quot; Cecilia asked him suddenly.</p>

<p>He looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.  Very well,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;What did he look like?&quot; she said, glancing into her cousin's big,
secret-troubled eyes, in which there was so much frustration.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, he was handsome: tall, and fresh-coloured, with mother's soft
brown hair.&quot;  As a matter of fact, Pauline's hair was grey.  &quot;The
ladies admired him very much; and he was at all the dances.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what kind of character had he?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, very good-natured and jolly.  He liked to be amused.  He was
rather quick and clever, like mother, and very good company.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And did he love your mother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very much.  She loved him too - better than she does me, as a
matter of fact.  He was so much more nearly her idea of a man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why was he more her idea of a man?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tall - handsome - attractive, and very good company - and would, I
believe, have been very successful at law.  I'm afraid I am merely
negative in all those respects.&quot;</p>

<p>Ciss looked at him attentively, with her slow-thinking hazel eyes.
Under his impassive mask she knew he suffered.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think you are so much more negative than he?&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He did not lift his face.  But after a few moments he replied:</p>

<p>&quot;My life, certainly, is a negative affair.&quot;</p>

<p>She hesitated before she dared ask him:</p>

<p>&quot;And do you mind?&quot;</p>

<p>He did not answer her at all.  Her heart sank.</p>

<p>&quot;You see, I'm afraid my life is as negative as yours is,&quot; she said.
&quot;And I'm beginning to mind bitterly.  I'm thirty.&quot;</p>

<p>She saw his creamy, well-bred hand tremble.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose,&quot; he said, without looking at her, &quot;one will rebel when
it is too late.&quot;</p>

<p>That was queer, from him.</p>

<p>&quot;Robert!&quot; she said.  &quot;Do you like me at all?&quot;</p>

<p>She saw his dusky-creamy face, so changeless in its folds, go pale.</p>

<p>&quot;I am very fond of you,&quot; he murmured.</p>

<p>&quot;Won't you kiss me?  Nobody ever kisses me,&quot; she said pathetically.</p>

<p>He looked at her, his eyes strange with fear and a certain
haughtiness.  Then he rose, and came softly over to her, and kissed
her gently on the cheek.</p>

<p>&quot;It's an awful shame, Ciss!&quot; he said softly.</p>

<p>She caught his hand and pressed it to her breast.</p>

<p>&quot;And sit with me sometimes in the garden,&quot; she said, murmuring with
difficulty.  &quot;Won't you?&quot;</p>

<p>He looked at her anxiously and searchingly.</p>

<p>&quot;What about mother?&quot;</p>

<p>Ciss smiled a funny little smile, and looked into his eyes.  He
suddenly flushed crimson, turning aside his face.  It was a painful
sight.</p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; he said.  &quot;I am no lover of women.&quot;</p>

<p>He spoke with sarcastic stoicism, against himself, but even she did
not know the shame it was to him.</p>

<p>&quot;You never try to be,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Again his eyes changed uncannily.</p>

<p>&quot;Does one have to try?&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, yes.  One never does anything if one doesn't try.&quot;</p>

<p>He went pale again.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps you are right,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>In a few minutes she left him, and went to her rooms.  At least she
had tried to take off the everlasting lid from things.</p>

<p>The weather continued sunny, Pauline continued her sun-baths, and
Ciss lay on the roof eavesdropping, in the literal sense of the
word.  But Pauline was not to be heard.  No sound came up the pipe.
She must be lying with her face away into the open.  Ciss listened
with all her might.  She could just detect the faintest, faintest
murmur away below, but no audible syllable.</p>

<p>And at night, under the stars, Cecilia sat and waited in silence,
on the seat which kept in view the drawing-room windows and the
side door into the garden.  She saw the light go up in her aunt's
room.  She saw the lights at last go out in the drawing-room.  And
she waited.  But he did not come.  She stayed on in the darkness
half the night, while the owl hooted.  But she stayed alone.</p>

<p>Two days she heard nothing; her aunt's thoughts were not revealed;
and at evening nothing happened.  Then, the second night, as she
sat with heavy, helpless persistence in the garden, suddenly she
started.  He had come out.  She rose and went softly over the grass
to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't speak!&quot; he murmured.</p>

<p>And in silence, in the dark, they walked down the garden and over
the little bridge to the paddock, where the hay, cut very late, was
in cock.  There they stood disconsolate under the stars.</p>

<p>&quot;You see,&quot; he said, &quot;how can I ask for love, if I don't feel any
love in myself?  You know I have a real regard for you - &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How CAN you feel any love, when you never feel anything?&quot; she
said.</p>

<p>&quot;That is true,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p>And she waited for what next.</p>

<p>&quot;And how can I marry?&quot; he said.  &quot;I am a failure even at making
money.  I can't ask my mother for money.&quot;</p>

<p>She sighed deeply.</p>

<p>&quot;Then don't bother yet about marrying,&quot; she said.  &quot;Only love me a
little.  Won't you?&quot;</p>

<p>He gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>&quot;It sounds so atrocious, to say it is hard to begin,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>She sighed again.  He was so stiff to move.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall we sit down a minute?&quot; she said.  And then, as they sat on
the hay, she added:  &quot;May I touch you?  Do you mind?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I mind.  But do as you wish,&quot; he replied, with that mixture
of shyness and queer candour which made him a little ridiculous, as
he knew quite well.  But in his heart there was almost murder.</p>

<p>She touched his black, always tidy, hair, with her fingers.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose I shall rebel one day,&quot; he said again suddenly.</p>

<p>They sat some time, till it grew chilly.  And he held her hand
fast, but he never put his arms round her.  At last she rose, and
went indoors, saying good-night.</p>

<p>The next day, as Cecilia lay stunned and angry on the roof, taking
her sun-bath, and becoming hot and fierce with sunshine, suddenly
she started.  A terror seized her in spite of herself.  It was the
voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Caro, caro, tu non l'hai visto!&quot; it was murmuring away, in a
language Cecilia did not understand.  She lay and writhed her limbs
in the sun, listening intently to words she could not follow.
Softly, whisperingly, with infinite caressiveness and yet with that
subtle, insidious arrogance under its velvet, came the voice,
murmuring in Italian:  &quot;Bravo, si, molto bravo, poverino, ma uomo
come te non sar&agrave; mai, mai, mai!&quot;  Oh, especially in Italian
Cecilia heard the poisonous charm of the voice, so caressive, so
soft and flexible, yet so utterly egoistic.  She hated it with
intensity as it sighed and whispered out of nowhere.  Why, why
should it be so delicate, so subtle and flexible and beautifully
controlled, when she herself was so clumsy?  Oh, poor Cecilia, she
writhed in the afternoon sun, knowing her own clownish clumsiness
and lack of suavity, in comparison.</p>

<p>&quot;No, Robert dear, you will never be the man your father was, though
you have some of his looks.  He was a marvellous lover, soft as a
flower yet piercing as a humming-bird.  Cara, cara mia bellissima,
ti ho aspettato come l'agonissante aspetta la morte, morte
deliziosa, quasi quasi troppo deliziosa per una mera anima humana.
He gave himself to a woman as he gave himself to God.  Mauro!
Mauro!  How you loved me!  How you loved me!&quot;</p>

<p>The voice ceased in reverie, and Cecilia knew what she had guessed
before - that Robert was not the son of her Uncle Ronald, but of
some Italian.</p>

<p>&quot;I am disappointed in you, Robert.  There is no poignancy in you.
Your father was a Jesuit, but he was the most perfect and poignant
lover in the world.  You are a Jesuit like a fish in a tank.  And
that Ciss of yours is the cat fishing for you.  It is less edifying
even than poor Henry.&quot;</p>

<p>Cecilia suddenly bent her mouth down to the tube, and said in a
deep voice:</p>

<p>&quot;Leave Robert alone!  Don't kill him as well.&quot;</p>

<p>There was dead silence in the hot July afternoon that was lowering
for thunder.  Cecilia lay prostrate, her heart beating in great
thumps.  She was listening as if her whole soul were an ear.  At
last she caught the whisper:</p>

<p>&quot;Did someone speak?&quot;</p>

<p>She leaned again to the mouth of the tube:</p>

<p>&quot;Don't kill Robert as you killed me,&quot; she said, with slow
enunciation, and a deep but small voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; came the sharp little cry.  &quot;Who is that speaking?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Henry,&quot; said the deep voice.</p>

<p>There was dead silence.  Poor Cecilia lay with all the use gone out
of her.  And there was dead silence.  Till at last came the
whisper:</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't kill Henry.  No, no!  No, no!  Henry, surely you can't
blame me!  I loved you, dearest; I only wanted to help you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You killed me!&quot; came the deep, artificial, accusing voice.  &quot;Now
let Robert live.  Let him go!  Let him marry!&quot;</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>&quot;How very, very awful!&quot; mused the whispering voice.  &quot;Is it
possible, Henry, you are a spirit, and you condemn me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I condemn you!&quot;</p>

<p>Cecilia felt all the pent-up rage going down that rain-pipe.  At
the same time, she almost laughed.  It was awful.</p>

<p>She lay and listened and listened.  No sound!  As if time had
ceased, she lay inert in the weakening sun, till she heard a far-
off rumble of thunder.  She sat up.  The sky was yellowing.
Quickly she dressed herself, went down, and out to the corner of
the stables.</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Pauline!&quot; she called discreetly.  &quot;Did you hear thunder?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.  I am going in.  Don't wait,&quot; came a feeble voice.</p>

<p>Cecilia retired, and from the loft watched, spying, as the figure
of the lovely lady, wrapped in a lovely wrap of old blue silk, went
rather totteringly to the house.</p>

<p>The sky gradually darkened.  Cecilia hastened in with the rugs.
Then the storm broke.  Aunt Pauline did not appear to tea.  She
found the thunder trying.  Robert also did not arrive till after
tea, in the pouring rain.  Cecilia went down the covered passage to
her own house, and dressed carefully for dinner, putting some white
columbines at her breast.</p>

<p>The drawing-room was lit with a softly-shaded lamp.  Robert,
dressed, was waiting, listening to the rain.  He too seemed
strangely crackling and on edge.  Cecilia came in, with the white
flowers nodding at her dusky breast.  Robert was watching her
curiously, a new look on his face.  Cecilia went to the bookshelves
near the door, and was peering for something, listening acutely.
She heard a rustle, then the door softly opening.  And as it
opened, Ciss suddenly switched on the strong electric light by the
door.</p>

<p>Her aunt, in a dress of black lace over ivory colour, stood in the
doorway.  Her face was made up, but haggard with a look of
unspeakable irritability, as if years of suppressed exasperation
and dislike of her fellow-men had suddenly crumpled her into an old
witch.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, aunt!&quot; cried Cecilia.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, mother, you're a little old lady!&quot; came the astounded voice
of Robert - like an astonished boy, as if it were a joke.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you only just found it out?&quot; snapped the old woman
venomously.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes!  Why, I thought - &quot; his voice tailed out in misgiving.</p>

<p>The haggard, old Pauline, in a frenzy of exasperation, said:</p>

<p>&quot;Aren't we going down?&quot;</p>

<p>She had not even noticed the excess of light, a thing she shunned.
And she went downstairs almost tottering.</p>

<p>At table she sat with her face like a crumpled mask of unspeakable
irritability.  She looked old, very old, and like a witch.  Robert
and Cecilia fetched furtive glances at her.  And Ciss, watching
Robert, saw that he was so astonished and repelled by his mother's
looks that he was another man.</p>

<p>&quot;What kind of a drive home did you have?&quot; snapped Pauline, with an
almost gibbering irritability.</p>

<p>&quot;It rained, of course,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;How clever of you to have found that out!&quot; said his mother, with
the grisly grin of malice that had succeeded her arch smile.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't understand,&quot; he said, with quiet suavity.</p>

<p>&quot;It's apparent,&quot; said his mother, rapidly and sloppily eating her
food.</p>

<p>She rushed through the meal like a crazy dog, to the utter
consternation of the servant.  And the moment it was over she
darted in a queer, crab-like way upstairs.  Robert and Cecilia
followed her, thunderstruck, like two conspirators.</p>

<p>&quot;You pour the coffee.  I loathe it!  I'm going.  Good-night!&quot; said
the old woman, in a succession of sharp shots.  And she scrambled
out of the room.</p>

<p>There was a dead silence.  At last he said:</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid mother isn't well.  I must persuade her to see a
doctor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Cecilia.</p>

<p>The evening passed in silence.  Robert and Ciss stayed on in the
drawing-room, having lit a fire.  Outside was cold rain.  Each
pretended to read.  They did not want to separate.  The evening
passed with ominous mysteriousness, yet quickly.</p>

<p>At about ten o'clock the door suddenly opened, and Pauline
appeared, in a blue wrap.  She shut the door behind her, and came
to the fire.  Then she looked at the two young people in hate, real
hate.</p>

<p>&quot;You two had better get married quickly,&quot; she said, in an ugly
voice.  &quot;It would look more decent; such a passionate pair of
lovers!&quot;</p>

<p>Robert looked up at her quietly.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought you believed that cousins should not marry, mother,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p>&quot;I do.  But you're not cousins.  Your father was an Italian
priest.&quot;  Pauline held her daintily-slippered foot to the fire, in
an old coquettish gesture.  Her body tried to repeat all the old
graceful gestures.  But the nerve had snapped, so it was a rather
dreadful caricature.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that really true, mother?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;True!  What do you think?  He was a distinguished man, or he
wouldn't have been my lover.  He was far too distinguished a man to
have had you for a son.  But that joy fell to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How unfortunate all round,&quot; he said slowly.</p>

<p>&quot;Unfortunate for you?  YOU were lucky.  It was MY misfortune,&quot; she
said acidly to him.</p>

<p>She was really a dreadful sight, like a piece of lovely Venetian
glass that has been dropped and gathered up again in horrible,
sharp-edged fragments.</p>

<p>Suddenly she left the room again.</p>

<p>For a week it went on.  She did not recover.  It was as if every
nerve in her body had suddenly started screaming in an insanity of
discordance.  The doctor came, and gave her sedatives, for she
never slept.  Without drugs she never slept at all, only paced back
and forth in her room, looking hideous and evil, reeking with
malevolence.  She could not bear to see either her son or her
niece.  Only when either of them came she asked, in pure malice:</p>

<p>&quot;Well!  When's the wedding?  Have you celebrated the nuptials yet?&quot;</p>

<p>At first Cecilia was stunned by what she had done.  She realised
vaguely that her aunt, once a definite thrust of condemnation had
penetrated her beautiful armour, had just collapsed, squirming,
inside her shell.  It was too terrible.  Ciss was almost terrified
into repentance.  Then she thought:  &quot;This is what she always was.
Now let her live the rest of her days in her true colours.&quot;</p>

<p>But Pauline would not live long.  She was literally shrivelling
away.  She kept her room, and saw no one.  She had her mirrors
taken away.</p>

<p>Robert and Cecilia sat a good deal together.  The jeering of the
mad Pauline had not driven them apart, as she had hoped.  But
Cecilia dared not confess to him what she had done.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think your mother ever loved anybody?&quot; Ciss asked him
tentatively, rather wistfully, one evening.</p>

<p>He looked at her fixedly.</p>

<p>&quot;Herself!&quot; he said at last.</p>

<p>&quot;She didn't even LOVE herself,&quot; said Ciss.  &quot;It was something else.
What was it?&quot;  She lifted a troubled, utterly puzzled face to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Power,&quot; he said curtly.</p>

<p>&quot;But what power?&quot; she asked.  &quot;I don't understand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Power to feed on other lives,&quot; he said bitterly.  &quot;She was
beautiful, and she fed on life.  She has fed on me as she fed on
Henry.  She put a sucker into one's soul, and sucked up one's
essential life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And don't you forgive her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Poor Aunt Pauline!&quot;</p>

<p>But even Ciss did not mean it.  She was only aghast.</p>

<p>&quot;I KNOW I've got a heart,&quot; he said, passionately striking his
breast.  &quot;But it's almost sucked dry.  I KNOW I've got a soul,
somewhere.  But it's gnawed bare.  I HATE people who want power
over others.&quot;</p>

<p>Ciss was silent.  What was there to say?</p>

<p>And two days later Pauline was found dead in her bed, having taken
too much veronal, for her heart was weakened.</p>

<p>From the grave even she hit back at her son and her niece.  She
left Robert the noble sum of one thousand pounds, and Ciss one
hundred.  All the rest, with the nucleus of her valuable antiques,
went to form the &quot;Pauline Attenborough Museum&quot;.</p>
