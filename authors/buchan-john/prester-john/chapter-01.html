<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I mind as if it were yesterday my first sight of the man.  Little
I knew at the time how big the moment was with destiny, or how
often that face seen in the fitful moonlight would haunt my sleep
and disturb my waking hours.  But I mind yet the cold grue of
terror I got from it, a terror which was surely more than the
due of a few truant lads breaking the Sabbath with their play.</p>

<p>The town of Kirkcaple, of which and its adjacent parish of Portincross
my father was the minister, lies on a hillside above the little
bay of Caple, and looks squarely out on the North Sea.  Round
the horns of land which enclose the bay the coast shows on either
side a battlement of stark red cliffs through which a burn or
two makes a pass to the water's edge.  The bay itself is ringed
with fine clean sands, where we lads of the burgh school loved
to bathe in the warm weather.  But on long holidays the sport
was to go farther afield among the cliffs; for there there were
many deep caves and pools, where podleys might be caught with
the line, and hid treasures sought for at the expense of the skin
of the knees and the buttons of the trousers.  Many a long Saturday
I have passed in a crinkle of the cliffs, having lit a fire of
driftwood, and made believe that I was a smuggler or a Jacobite
new landed from France.  There was a band of us in Kirkcaple,
lads of my own age, including Archie Leslie, the son of my father's
session-clerk, and Tam Dyke, the provost's nephew.  We were sealed
to silence by the blood oath, and we bore each the name of some
historic pirate or sailorman.  I was Paul Jones, Tam was Captain
Kidd, and Archie, need I say it, was Morgan himself.  Our tryst
was a cave where a little water called the Dyve Burn had cut its
way through the cliffs to the sea. There we forgathered in the
summer evenings and of a Saturday afternoon in winter, and told
mighty tales of our prowess and flattered our silly hearts.  But
the sober truth is that our deeds were of the humblest, and a
dozen of fish or a handful of apples was all our booty, and our
greatest exploit a fight with the roughs at the Dyve tan-work.</p>

<p>My father's spring Communion fell on the last Sabbath of April,
and on the particular Sabbath of which I speak the weather was
mild and bright for the time of year.  I had been surfeited with
the Thursday's and Saturday's services, and the two long diets
of worship on the Sabbath were hard for a lad of twelve to bear
with the spring in his bones and the sun slanting through the
gallery window.  There still remained the service on the Sabbath
evening&mdash;a doleful prospect, for the Rev. Mr Murdoch of Kilchristie,
noted for the length of his discourses, had exchanged pulpits
with my father.  So my mind was ripe for the proposal of Archie
Leslie, on our way home to tea, that by a little skill we might
give the kirk the slip.  At our Communion the pews were emptied
of their regular occupants and the congregation seated itself
as it pleased.  The manse seat was full of the Kirkcaple relations
of Mr Murdoch, who had been invited there by my mother to hear
him, and it was not hard to obtain permission to sit with Archie
and Tam Dyke in the cock-loft in the gallery.  Word was sent to
Tam, and so it happened that three abandoned lads duly passed
the plate and took their seats in the cock-loft.  But when the
bell had done jowing, and we heard by the sounds of their feet
that the elders had gone in to the kirk, we slipped down the stairs
and out of the side door.  We were through the churchyard in a
twinkling, and hot-foot on the road to the Dyve Burn. It was the
fashion of the genteel in Kirkcaple to put their boys into what
were known as Eton suits&mdash;long trousers, cut-away jackets, and
chimney-pot hats.  I had been one of the earliest victims, and
well I remember how I fled home from the Sabbath school with the
snowballs of the town roughs rattling off my chimney-pot.  Archie
had followed, his family being in all things imitators of mine. 
We were now clothed in this wearisome garb, so our first care
was to secrete safely our hats in a marked spot under some whin
bushes on the links. Tam was free from the bondage of fashion,
and wore his ordinary best knickerbockers. From inside his jacket
he unfolded his special treasure, which was to light us on our
expedition&mdash;an evil-smelling old tin lantern with a shutter.</p>

<p>Tam was of the Free Kirk persuasion, and as his Communion fell
on a different day from ours, he was spared the bondage of church
attendance from which Archie and I had revolted.  But notable
events had happened that day in his church.  A black man, the
Rev. John Something-or-other, had been preaching.  Tam was full
of the portent. 'A nagger,' he said, 'a great black chap as big
as your father, Archie.'  He seemed to have banged the bookboard
with some effect, and had kept Tam, for once in his life, awake. 
He had preached about the heathen in Africa, and how a black man
was as good as a white man in the sight of God, and he had forecast
a day when the negroes would have something to teach the British
in the way of civilization.  So at any rate ran the account of
Tam Dyke, who did not share the preacher's views.  'It's all nonsense,
Davie.  The Bible says that the children of Ham were to be our
servants.  If I were the minister I wouldn't let a nigger into
the pulpit.  I wouldn't let him farther than the Sabbath school.'</p>

<p>Night fell as we came to the broomy spaces of the links, and
ere we had breasted the slope of the neck which separates Kirkcaple
Bay from the cliffs it was as dark as an April evening with a
full moon can be.  Tam would have had it darker.  He got out his
lantern, and after a prodigious waste of matches kindled the candle-end
inside, turned the dark shutter, and trotted happily on.  We had
no need of his lighting till the Dyve Burn was reached and the
path began to descend steeply through the rift in the crags.</p>

<p>It was here we found that some one had gone before us. Archie
was great in those days at tracking, his ambition running in Indian
paths.  He would walk always with his head bent and his eyes on
the ground, whereby he several times found lost coins and once
a trinket dropped by the provost's wife.  At the edge of the burn,
where the path turns downward, there is a patch of shingle washed
up by some spate.  Archie was on his knees in a second.  'Lads,'
he cried, 'there's spoor here;' and then after some nosing, 'it's
a man's track, going downward, a big man with flat feet.  It's
fresh, too, for it crosses the damp bit of gravel, and the water
has scarcely filled the holes yet.'</p>

<p>We did not dare to question Archie's woodcraft, but it puzzled
us who the stranger could be.  In summer weather you might find
a party of picnickers here, attracted by the fine hard sands at
the burn mouth. But at this time of night and season of the year
there was no call for any one to be trespassing on our preserves. 
No fishermen came this way, the lobster-pots being all to the
east, and the stark headland of the Red Neb made the road to them
by the water's edge difficult.  The tan-work lads used to come
now and then for a swim, but you would not find a tan-work lad
bathing on a chill April night. Yet there was no question where
our precursor had gone.  He was making for the shore. Tam unshuttered
his lantern, and the steps went clearly down the corkscrew path. 
'Maybe he is after our cave.  We'd better go cannily.'</p>

<p>The glim was dowsed&mdash;the words were Archie's&mdash;and in the best
contraband manner we stole down the gully.  The business had suddenly
taken an eerie turn, and I think in our hearts we were all a little
afraid.  But Tam had a lantern, and it would never do to turn
back from an adventure which had all the appearance of being the
true sort.  Half way down there is a scrog of wood, dwarf alders
and hawthorn, which makes an arch over the path.  I, for one,
was glad when we got through this with no worse mishap than a
stumble from Tam which caused the lantern door to fly open and
the candle to go out. We did not stop to relight it, but scrambled
down the screes till we came to the long slabs of reddish rock
which abutted on the beach.  We could not see the track, so we
gave up the business of scouts, and dropped quietly over the big
boulder and into the crinkle of cliff which we called our cave.</p>

<p>There was nobody there, so we relit the lantern and examined
our properties.  Two or three fishing-rods for the burn, much
damaged by weather; some sea-lines on a dry shelf of rock; a couple
of wooden boxes; a pile of driftwood for fires, and a heap of
quartz in which we thought we had found veins of gold&mdash;such was
the modest furnishing of our den.  To this I must add some broken
clay pipes, with which we made believe to imitate our elders,
smoking a foul mixture of coltsfoot leaves and brown paper.  The
band was in session, so following our ritual we sent out a picket. 
Tam was deputed to go round the edge of the cliff from which the
shore was visible, and report if the coast was clear.</p>

<p>He returned in three minutes, his eyes round with amazement in
the lantern light.  'There's a fire on the sands,' he repeated,
'and a man beside it.'</p>

<p>Here was news indeed.  Without a word we made for the open, Archie
first, and Tam, who had seized and shuttered his lantern, coming
last. We crawled to the edge of the cliff and peered round, and
there sure enough, on the hard bit of sand which the tide had
left by the burn mouth, was a twinkle of light and a dark figure.</p>

<p>The moon was rising, and besides there was that curious sheen
from the sea which you will often notice in spring.  The glow
was maybe a hundred yards distant, a little spark of fire I could
have put in my cap, and, from its crackling and smoke, composed
of dry seaweed and half-green branches from the burnside thickets. 
A man's figure stood near it, and as we looked it moved round
and round the fire in circles which first of all widened and then
contracted.</p>

<p>The sight was so unexpected, so beyond the beat of our experience,
that we were all a little scared.  What could this strange being
want with a fire at half-past eight of an April Sabbath night
on the Dyve Burn sands?  We discussed the thing in whispers behind
a boulder, but none of us had any solution.  'Belike he's come
ashore in a boat,' said Archie.  'He's maybe a foreigner.'  But
I pointed out that, from the tracks which Archie himself had found,
the man must have come overland down the cliffs.  Tam was clear
he was a madman, and was for withdrawing promptly from the whole
business.</p>

<p>But some spell kept our feet tied there in that silent world
of sand and moon and sea.  I remember looking back and seeing
the solemn, frowning faces of the cliffs, and feeling somehow
shut in with this unknown being in a strange union.  What kind
of errand had brought this interloper into our territory?  For
a wonder I was less afraid than curious.  I wanted to get to the
heart of the matter, and to discover what the man was up to with
his fire and his circles.</p>

<p>The same thought must have been in Archie's head, for he dropped
on his belly and began to crawl softly seawards.  I followed,
and Tam, with sundry complaints, crept after my heels.  Between
the cliffs and the fire lay some sixty yards of <em>débris</em>
and boulders above the level of all but the high spring tides. 
Beyond lay a string of seaweedy pools and then the hard sands
of the burnfoot.  There was excellent cover among the big stones,
and apart from the distance and the dim light, the man by the
fire was too preoccupied in his task to keep much look-out towards
the land.  I remember thinking he had chosen his place well, for
save from the sea he could not be seen.  The cliffs are so undercut
that unless a watcher on the coast were on their extreme edge
he would not see the burnfoot sands.</p>

<p>Archie, the skilled tracker, was the one who all but betrayed
us.  His knee slipped on the seaweed, and he rolled off a boulder,
bringing down with him a clatter of small stones.  We lay as still
as mice, in terror lest the man should have heard the noise and
have come to look for the cause.  By-and-by when I ventured to
raise my head above a flat-topped stone I saw that he was undisturbed. 
The fire still burned, and he was pacing round it. On the edge
of the pools was an outcrop of red sandstone much fissured by
the sea.  Here was an excellent vantage-ground, and all three
of us curled behind it, with our eyes just over the edge.  The
man was not twenty yards off, and I could see clearly what manner
of fellow he was.  For one thing he was huge of size, or so he
seemed to me in the half-light.  He wore nothing but a shirt and
trousers, and I could hear by the flap of his feet on the sand
that he was barefoot.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tam Dyke gave a gasp of astonishment.  'Gosh, it's the
black minister!' he said.</p>

<p>It was indeed a black man, as we saw when the moon came out of
a cloud. His head was on his breast, and he walked round the fire
with measured, regular steps.  At intervals he would stop and
raise both hands to the sky, and bend his body in the direction
of the moon.  But he never uttered a word.</p>

<p>'It's magic,' said Archie.  'He's going to raise Satan.  We must
bide here and see what happens, for he'll grip us if we try to
go back.  The moon's ower high.'</p>

<p>The procession continued as if to some slow music.  I had been
in no fear of the adventure back there by our cave; but now that
I saw the thing from close at hand, my courage began to ebb. 
There was something desperately uncanny about this great negro,
who had shed his clerical garments, and was now practising some
strange magic alone by the sea. I had no doubt it was the black
art, for there was that in the air and the scene which spelled
the unlawful.  As we watched, the circles stopped, and the man
threw something on the fire.  A thick smoke rose of which we could
feel the aromatic scent, and when it was gone the flame burned
with a silvery blueness like moonlight.  Still no sound came from
the minister, but he took something from his belt, and began to
make odd markings in the sand between the inner circle and the
fire. As he turned, the moon gleamed on the implement, and we
saw it was a great knife.</p>

<p>We were now scared in real earnest.  Here were we, three boys,
at night in a lonely place a few yards from a savage with a knife.
The adventure was far past my liking, and even the intrepid Archie
was having qualms, if I could judge from his set face. As for
Tam, his teeth were chattering like a threshing-mill.</p>

<p>Suddenly I felt something soft and warm on the rock at my right
hand. I felt again, and, lo! it was the man's clothes. There were
his boots and socks, his minister's coat and his minister's hat.</p>

<p>This made the predicament worse, for if we waited till he finished
his rites we should for certain be found by him.  At the same
time, to return over the boulders in the bright moonlight seemed
an equally sure way to discovery.  I whispered to Archie, who
was for waiting a little longer.  'Something may turn up,' he
said.  It was always his way.</p>

<p>I do not know what would have turned up, for we had no chance
of testing it.  The situation had proved too much for the nerves
of Tam Dyke.  As the man turned towards us in his bowings and
bendings, Tam suddenly sprang to his feet and shouted at him a
piece of schoolboy rudeness then fashionable in Kirkcaple.</p>

<p>'Wha called ye partan-face, my bonny man?'  Then, clutching his
lantern, he ran for dear life, while Archie and I raced at his
heels. As I turned I had a glimpse of a huge figure, knife in
hand, bounding towards us.</p>

<p>Though I only saw it in the turn of a head, the face stamped
itself indelibly upon my mind.  It was black, black as ebony,
but it was different from the ordinary negro.  There were no thick
lips and flat nostrils; rather, if I could trust my eyes, the
nose was high-bridged, and the lines of the mouth sharp and firm. 
But it was distorted into an expression of such a devilish fury
and amazement that my heart became like water.</p>

<p>We had a start, as I have said, of some twenty or thirty yards. 
Among the boulders we were not at a great disadvantage, for a
boy can flit quickly over them, while a grown man must pick his
way.  Archie, as ever, kept his wits the best of us. 'Make straight
for the burn,' he shouted in a hoarse whisper; we'll beat him
on the slope.'</p>

<p>We passed the boulders and slithered over the outcrop of red
rock and the patches of sea-pink till we reached the channel of
the Dyve water, which flows gently among pebbles after leaving
the gully.  Here for the first time I looked back and saw nothing. 
I stopped involuntarily, and that halt was nearly my undoing. 
For our pursuer had reached the burn before us, but lower down,
and was coming up its bank to cut us off.</p>

<p>At most times I am a notable coward, and in these days I was
still more of one, owing to a quick and easily-heated imagination. 
But now I think I did a brave thing, though more by instinct than
resolution. Archie was running first, and had already splashed
through the burn; Tam came next, just about to cross, and the
black man was almost at his elbow.  Another second and Tam would
have been in his clutches had I not yelled out a warning and made
straight up the bank of the burn. Tam fell into the pool &mdash;I
could hear his spluttering cry&mdash;but he got across; for I heard
Archie call to him, and the two vanished into the thicket which
clothes all the left bank of the gully.  The pursuer, seeing me
on his own side of the water, followed straight on; and before
I knew it had become a race between the two of us.</p>

<p>I was hideously frightened, but not without hope, for the screes
and shelves of this right side of the gully were known to me from
many a day's exploring.  I was light on my feet and uncommonly
sound in wind, being by far the best long-distance runner in Kirkcaple. 
If I could only keep my lead till I reached a certain corner I
knew of, I could outwit my enemy; for it was possible from that
place to make a detour behind a waterfall and get into a secret
path of ours among the bushes. I flew up the steep screes, not
daring to look round; but at the top, where the rocks begin, I
had a glimpse of my pursuer. The man could run.  Heavy in build
though he was he was not six yards behind me, and I could see
the white of his eyes and the red of his gums.  I saw something
else&mdash;a glint of white metal in his hand.  He still had his knife.</p>

<p>Fear sent me up the rocks like a seagull, and I scrambled and
leaped, making for the corner I knew of.  Something told me that
the pursuit was slackening, and for a moment I halted to look
round.  A second time a halt was nearly the end of me. A great
stone flew through the air, and took the cliff an inch from my
head, half-blinding me with splinters.  And now I began to get
angry.  I pulled myself into cover, skirted a rock till I came
to my corner, and looked back for the enemy. There he was scrambling
by the way I had come, and making a prodigious clatter among the
stones.  I picked up a loose bit of rock and hurled it with all
my force in his direction.  It broke before it reached him, but
a considerable lump, to my joy, took him full in the face.  Then
my terrors revived.  I slipped behind the waterfall and was soon
in the thicket, and toiling towards the top.</p>

<p>I think this last bit was the worst in the race, for my strength
was failing, and I seemed to hear those horrid steps at my heels. 
My heart was in my mouth as, careless of my best clothes, I tore
through the hawthorn bushes.  Then I struck the path and, to my
relief, came on Archie and Tam, who were running slowly in desperate
anxiety about my fate.  We then took hands and soon reached the
top of the gully.</p>

<p>For a second we looked back.  The pursuit had ceased, and far
down the burn we could hear the sounds as of some one going back
to the sands.</p>

<p>'Your face is bleeding, Davie.  Did he get near enough to hit
you?' Archie asked.</p>

<p>'He hit me with a stone.  But I gave him better.  He's got a
bleeding nose to remember this night by.'</p>

<p>We did not dare take the road by the links, but made for the
nearest human habitation.  This was a farm about half a mile inland,
and when we reached it we lay down by the stack-yard gate and
panted.</p>

<p>'I've lost my lantern,' said Tam.  'The big black brute!  See
if I don't tell my father.'</p>

<p>'Ye'll do nothing of the kind,' said Archie fiercely.  'He knows
nothing about us and can't do us any harm.  But if the story got
out and he found out who we were, he'd murder the lot of US.'</p>

<p>He made us swear secrecy, which we were willing enough to do,
seeing very clearly the sense in his argument.  Then we struck
the highroad and trotted back at our best pace to Kirkcaple, fear
of our families gradually ousting fear of pursuit. In our excitement
Archie and I forgot about our Sabbath hats, reposing quietly below
a whin bush on the links.</p>

<p>We were not destined to escape without detection.  As ill luck
would have it, Mr Murdoch had been taken ill with the stomach-ache
after the second psalm, and the congregation had been abruptly
dispersed.  My mother had waited for me at the church door, and,
seeing no signs of her son, had searched the gallery.  Then the
truth came out, and, had I been only for a mild walk on the links,
retribution would have overtaken my truantry.  But to add to this
I arrived home with a scratched face, no hat, and several rents
in my best trousers.  I was well cuffed and sent to bed, with
the promise of full-dress chastisement when my father should come
home in the morning.</p>

<p>My father arrived before breakfast next day, and I was duly and
soundly whipped.  I set out for school with aching bones to add
to the usual depression of Monday morning.  At the corner of the
Nethergate I fell in with Archie, who was staring at a trap carrying
two men which was coming down the street. It was the Free Church
minister&mdash;he had married a rich wife and kept a horse&mdash;driving
the preacher of yesterday to the railway station.  Archie and
I were in behind a doorpost in a twinkling, so that we could see
in safety the last of our enemy. He was dressed in minister's
clothes, with a heavy fur-coat and a brand new yellow-leather
Gladstone bag.  He was talking loudly as he passed, and the Free
Church minister seemed to be listening attentively.  I heard his
deep voice saying something about the 'work of God in this place.'
But what I noticed specially&mdash;and the sight made me forget my
aching hinder parts&mdash;was that he had a swollen eye, and two strips
of sticking-plaster on his cheek.</p>
