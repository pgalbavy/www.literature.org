<P>
 THE proceedings began at ten o'clock. The prisoner was placed at
the Bar, before the High Court of Justiciary, at Edinburgh. He
bowed respectfully to the Bench, and pleaded Not Guilty, in a low
voice.
<P>
It was observed by every one present that the prisoner's face
betrayed traces of acute mental suffering. He was deadly pale.
His eyes never once wandered to the crowd in the Court. When
certain witnesses appeared against him, he looked at them with a
momentary attention. At other times he kept his eyes on the
ground. When the evidence touched on his wife's illness and
death, he was deeply affected, and covered his face with his
hands. It was a subject of general remark and general surprise
that the prisoner, in this case (although a man), showed far less
self-possession than the last prisoner tried in that Court for
murder--a woman, who had been convicted on overwhelming evidence.
There were persons present (a small minority only) who considered
this want of composure on the part of the prisoner to be a sign
in his favor. Self-possession, in his dreadful position,
signified, to their minds, the stark insensibility of a heartless
and shameless criminal, and afforded in itself a presumption, not
of innocence, but of guilt.
<P>
The first witness called was John Daviot, Esquire,
Sheriff-Substitute of Mid-Lothian. He was examined by the Lord
Advocate (as counsel for the prosecution); and said:
<P>
"The prisoner was brought before me on the present charge. He
made and subscribed a Declaration on the 29th of October. It was
freely and voluntarily made, the prisoner having been first duly
warned and admonished."
<P>
Having identified the Declaration, the Sheriff-Substitute--being
cross-examined by the Dean of Faculty (as counsel for the
defense)--continued his evidence in these words:
<P>
"The charge against the prisoner was Murder. This was
communicated to him before he made the Declaration. The questions
addressed to the prisoner were put partly by me, partly by
another officer, the procurator-fiscal. The answers were given
distinctly, and, so far as I could judge, without reserve. The
statements put forward in the Declaration were all made in answer
to questions asked by the procurator-fiscal or by myself."
<P>
A clerk in the Sheriff-Clerk's office then officially produced
the Declaration, and corroborated the evidence of the witness who
had preceded him.
<P>
The appearance of the next witness created a marked sensation in
the Court. This was no less a person than the nurse who had
attended Mrs. Macallan in her last illness--by name Christina
Ormsay.
<P>
After the first formal answers, the nurse (examined by the Lord
Advocate) proceeded to say:
<P>
"I was first sent for to attend the deceased lady on the 7th of
October. She was then suffering from a severe cold, accompanied
by a rheumatic affection of the left knee-joint. Previous to this
I understood that her health had been fairly good. She was not a
very difficult person to nurse when you got used to her, and
understood how to manage her. The main difficulty was caused by
her temper. She was not a sullen person; she was headstrong and
violent--easily excited to fly into a passion, and quite reckless
in her fits of anger as to what she said or did. At such times I
really hardly think she knew what she was about. My own idea is
that her temper was made still more irritable by unhappiness in
her married life. She was far from being a reserved person.
Indeed, she was disposed (as I thought) to be a little too
communicative about herself and her troubles with persons like me
who were beneath her in station. She did not scruple, for
instance, to tell me (when we had been long enough together to
get used to each other) that she was very unhappy, and fretted a
good deal about her husband. One night, when she was wakeful and
restless, she said to me--"
<P>
The Dean of Faculty here interposed, speaking on the prisoner's
behalf. He appealed to the Judges to say whether such loose and
unreliable evidence as this was evidence which could be received
by the Court.
<P>
The Lord Advocate (speaking on behalf of the Crown) claimed it as
his right to produce the evidence. It was of the utmost
importance in this case to show (on the testimony of an
unprejudiced witness) on what terms the husband and wife were
living. The witness was a most respectable woman. She had won,
and deserved, the confidence of the unhappy lady whom she
attended on her death-bed.
<P>
After briefly consulting together, the Judges unanimously decided
that the evidence could not be admitted. What the witness had
herself seen and observed of the relations between the husband
and wife was the only evidence that they could receive.
<P>
The Lord Advocate thereupon continued his examination of the
witness. Christina Ormsay resumed her evidence as follows:
<P>
"My position as nurse led necessarily to my seeing more of Mrs.
Macallan than any other person in the house. I am able to speak
from experience of many things not known to others who were only
in her room at intervals.
<P>
"For instance, I had more than one opportunity of personally
observing that Mr. and Mrs. Macallan did not live together very
happily. I can give you an example of this, not drawn from what
others told me, but from what I noticed for myself.
<P>
"Toward the latter part of my attendance on Mrs. Macallan, a
young widow lady named Mrs. Beauly--a cousin of Mr.
Macallan's--came to stay at Gleninch. Mrs. Macallan was jealous
of this lady; and she showed it in my presence only the day
before her death, when Mr. Macallan came into her room to inquire
how she had passed the night. 'Oh,' she said, 'never mind how _I_
have slept! What do you care whether I sleep well or ill? How has
Mrs. Beauly passed the night? Is she more beautiful than ever
this morning? Go back to her--pray go back to her! Don't waste
your time with me!' Beginning in that manner, she worked herself
into one of her furious rages. I was brushing her hair at the
time; and feeling that my presence was an impropriety under the
circumstances, I attempted to leave the room. She forbade me to
go. Mr. Macallan felt, as I did, that my duty was to withdraw,
and he said so in plain words. Mrs. Macallan insisted on my
staying in language so insolent to her husband that he said, 'If
you cannot control yourself, either the nurse leaves the room or
I do.' She refused to yield even then. 'A good excuse,' she said,
'for getting back to Mrs. Beauly. Go!' He took her at her word,
and walked out of the room. He had barely closed the door before
she began reviling him to me in the most shocking manner. She
declared, among other things she said of him, that the news of
all others which he would be most glad to hear would be the news
of her death. I ventured, quite respectfully, on r emonstrating
with her. She took up the hair-brush and threw it at me, and then
and there dismissed me from my attendance on her. I left her, and
waited below until her fit of passion had worn itself out. Then I
returned to my place at the bedside, and for a while things went
on again as usual.
<P>
"It may not be amiss to add a word which may help to explain Mrs.
Macallan's jealousy of her husband's cousin. Mrs. Macallan was a
very plain woman. She had a cast in one of her eyes, and (if I
may use the expression) one of the most muddy, blotchy
complexions it was ever my misfortune to see in a person's face.
Mrs. Beauly, on the other hand, was a most attractive lady. Her
eyes were universally admired, and she had a most beautifully
clear and delicate color. Poor Mrs. Macallan said of her, most
untruly, that she painted.
<P>
"No; the defects in the complexion of the deceased lady were not
in any way attributable to her illness. I should call them born
and bred defects in herself.
<P>
"Her illness, if I am asked to describe it, I should say was
troublesome--nothing more. Until the last day there were no
symptoms in the least degree serious about the malady that had
taken her. Her rheumatic knee was painful, of course--acutely
painful, if you like--when she moved it; and the confinement to
bed was irksome enough, no doubt. But otherwise there was nothing
in the lady's condition, before the fatal attack came, to alarm
her or anybody about her. She had her books and her writing
materials on an invalid table, which worked on a pivot, and could
be arranged in any position most agreeable to her. At times she
read and wrote a good deal. At other times she lay quiet,
thinking her own thoughts, or talking with me, and with one or
two lady friends in the neighborhood who came regularly to see
her.
<P>
"Her writing, so far as I knew, was almost entirely of the
poetical sort. She was a great hand at composing poetry. On one
occasion only she showed me some of her poems. I am no judge of
such things. Her poetry was of the dismal kind, despairing about
herself, and wondering why she had ever been born, and nonsense
like that. Her husband came in more than once for some hard hits
at his cruel heart and his ignorance of his wife's merits. In
short, she vented her discontent with her pen as well as with her
tongue. There were times--and pretty often too--when an angel
from heaven would have failed to have satisfied Mrs. Macallan.
<P>
"Throughout the period of her illness the deceased lady occupied
the same room--a large bedroom situated (like all the best
bedrooms) on the first floor of the house.
<P>
"Yes: the plan of the room now shown to me is quite accurately
taken, according to my remembrance of it. One door led into the
great passage, or corridor, on which all the doors opened. A
second door, at one side (marked B on the plan), led to Mr.
Macallan's sleeping-room. A third door, on the opposite side
(marked C on the plan), communicated with a little study, or
book-room, used, as I was told, by Mr. Macallan's mother when she
was staying at Gleninch, but seldom or never entered by any one
else. Mr. Macallan's mother was not at Gleninch while I was
there. The door between the bedroom and this study was locked,
and the key was taken out. I don't know who had the key, or
whether there were more keys than one in existence. The door was
never opened to my knowledge. I only got into the study, to look
at it along with the housekeeper, by entering through a second
door that opened on to the corridor.
<P>
"I beg to say that I can speak from my own knowledge positively
about Mrs. Macallan's illness, and about the sudden change which
ended in her death. By the doctor's advice I made notes at the
time of dates and hours, and such like. I looked at my notes
before coming here.
<P>
"From the 7th of October, when I was first called in to nurse
her, to the 20th of the same month, she slowly but steadily
improved in health. Her knee was still painful, no doubt; but the
inflammatory look of it was disappearing. As to the other
symptoms, except weakness from lying in bed, and irritability of
temper, there was really nothing the matter with her. She slept
badly, I ought perhaps to add. But we remedied this by means of
composing draughts prescribed for that purpose by the doctor.
<P>
"On the morning of the 21st, at a few minutes past six, I got my
first alarm that something was going wrong with Mrs. Macallan.
<P>
"I was awoke at the time I have mentioned by the ringing of the
hand-bell which she kept on her bed-table. Let me say for myself
that I had only fallen asleep on the sofa in the bedroom at past
two in the morning from sheer fatigue. Mrs. Macallan was then
awake. She was in one of her bad humors with me. I had tried to
prevail on her to let me remove her dressing-case from her
bed-table, after she had used it in making her toilet for the
night. It took up a great deal of room; and she could not
possibly want it again before the morning. But no; she insisted
on my letting it be. There was a glass inside the case; and,
plain as she was, she never wearied of looking at herself in that
glass. I saw that she was in a bad state of temper, so I gave her
her way, and let the dressing-case be. Finding that she was too
sullen to speak to me after that, and too obstinate to take her
composing draught from me when I offered it, I laid me down on
the sofa at her bed foot, and fell asleep, as I have said.
<P>
"The moment her bell rang I was up and at the bedside, ready to
make myself useful.
<P>
"I asked what was the matter with her. She complained of
faintness and depression, and said she felt sick. I inquired if
she had taken anything in the way of physic or food while I had
been asleep. She answered that her husband had come in about an
hour since, and, finding her still sleepless, had himself
administered the composing draught. Mr. Macallan (sleeping in the
next room) joined us while she was speaking. He too had been
aroused by the bell. He heard what Mrs. Macallan said to me about
the composing draught, and made no remark upon it. It seemed to
me that he was alarmed at his wife's faintness. I suggested that
she should take a little wine, or brandy and water. She answered
that she could swallow nothing so strong as wine or brandy,
having a burning pain in her stomach already. I put my hand on
her stomach--quite lightly. She screamed when I touched her.
<P>
"This symptom alarmed us. We went to the village for the medical
man who had attended Mrs. Macallan during her illness: one Mr.
Gale.
<P>
"The doctor seemed no better able to account for the change for
the worse in his patient than we were. Hearing her complain of
thirst, he gave her some milk. Not long after taking it she was
sick. The sickness appeared to relieve her. She soon grew drowsy
and slumbered. Mr. Gale left us, with strict injunctions to send
for him instantly if she was taken ill again.
<P>
"Nothing of the sort happened; no change took place for the next
three hours or more. She roused up toward half-past nine and
inquired about her husband. I informed her that he had returned
to his own room, and asked if I should send for him. She said
'No.' I asked next if she would like anything to eat or drink.
She said 'No' again, in rather a vacant, stupefied way, and then
told me to go downstairs and get my breakfast. On my way down I
met the housekeeper. She invited me to breakfast with her in her
room, instead of in the servants' hall as usual. I remained with
the housekeeper but a short time--certainly not more than half an
hour.
<P>
"Coming upstairs again, I met the under-housemaid sweeping on one
of the landings.
<P>
"The girl informed me that Mrs. Macallan had taken a cup of tea
during my absence in the housekeeper's room. Mr. Macallan's valet
had ordered the tea for his mistress by his master's directions.
The under-housemaid made it, and took it upstairs herself to Mrs.
Macallan's room. Her master, she said, opened the door when she
knocked, and took the tea-cup from her with his own hand. He
opened the door widely enough for her to see into the bedroom,
and to notice that nobody was with Mrs. Macallan but himself.
<P>
"After a little talk with the under-housemaid, I returned to the
bedroom. No one was there. Mrs. Macallan was lying perfectly
quiet, with her face turned away from me on the pillow.
Approaching the bedside, I kicked against something on the floor.
It was a broken tea-cup. I said to Mrs. Macallan, 'How comes the
tea-cup to be broken, ma'am?' She answered, without turning
toward me, in an odd, muffled kind of voice, 'I dropped it.'
'Before you drank your tea, ma'am?' I asked. 'No,' she said; 'in
handing the cup back to Mr. Macallan, after I had done.' I had
put my question, wishing to know, in case she had spilled the tea
when she dropped the cup, whether it would be necessary to get
her any more. I am quite sure I remember correctly my question
and her answer. I inquired next if she had been long alone. She
said, shortly, 'Yes; I have been trying to sleep.' I said, 'Do
you feel pretty comfortable?' She answered, 'Yes,' again. All
this time she still kept her face sulkily turned from me toward
the wall. Stooping over her to arrange the bedclothes, I looked
toward her table. The writing materials which were always kept on
it were disturbed, and there was wet ink on one of the pens. I
said, 'Surely you haven't been writing, ma'am?' 'Why not?' she
said; 'I couldn't sleep.' 'Another poem?' I asked. She laughed to
herself--a bitter, short laugh. 'Yes,' she said, 'another poem.'
'That's good,' I said; 'it looks as if you were getting quite
like yourself again. We shan't want the doctor any more to-day.'
She made no answer to this, except an impatient sign with her
hand. I didn't understand the sign. Upon that she spoke again,
and crossly enough, too--'I want to be alone; leave me.'
<P>
"I had no choice but to do as I was told. To the best of my
observation, there was nothing the matter with her, and nothing
for the nurse to do. I put the bell-rope within reach of her
hand, and I went downstairs again.
<P>
"Half an hour more, as well as I can guess it, passed. I kept
within hearing of the bell; but it never rang. I was not quite at
my ease--without exactly knowing why. That odd, muffled voice in
which she had spoken to me hung on my mind, as it were. I was not
quite satisfied about leaving her alone for too long a time
together--and then, again, I was unwilling to risk throwing her
into one of her fits of passion by going back before she rang for
me. It ended in my venturing into the room on the ground-floor
called the Morning-Room, to consult Mr. Macallan. He was usually
to be found there in the forenoon of the day.
<P>
"On this occasion, however, when I looked into the Morning-Room
it was empty.
<P>
"At the same moment I heard the master's voice on the terrace
outside. I went out, and found him speaking to one Mr. Dexter, an
old friend of his, and (like Mrs. Beauly) a guest staying in the
house. Mr. Dexter was sitting at the window of his room upstairs
(he was a cripple, and could only move himself about in a chair
on wheels), and Mr. Macallan was speaking to him from the terrace
below.
<P>
"'Dexter!' I heard Mr. Macallan say. 'Where is Mrs. Beauly? Have
you seen anything of her?'
<P>
"Mr. Dexter answered, in his quick, off-hand way of speaking,
'Not I. I know nothing about her.'
<P>
"Then I advanced, and, begging pardon for intruding, I mentioned
to Mr. Macallan the difficulty I was in about going back or not
to his wife's room without waiting until she rang for me. Before
he could advise me in the matter, the footman made his appearance
and informed me that Mrs. Macallan's bell was then ringing--and
ringing violently.
<P>
"It was then close on eleven o'clock. As fast as I could mount
the stairs I hastened back to the bedroom.
<P>
"Before I opened the door I heard Mrs. Macallan groaning. She was
in dreadful pain; feeling a burning heat in the stomach and in
the throat, together with the same sickness which had troubled
her in the early morning. Though no doctor, I could see in her
face that this second attack was of a far more serious nature
than the first. After ringing the bell for a messenger to send to
Mr. Macallan, I ran to the door to see if any of the servants
happened to be within call.
<P>
"The only person I saw in the corridor was Mrs. Beauly. She was
on her way from her own room, she said, to inquire after Mrs.
Macallan's health. I said to her, 'Mrs. Macallan is seriously ill
again, ma'am. Would you please tell Mr. Macallan, and send for
the doctor?' She ran downstairs at once to do as I told her.
<P>
"I had not been long back at the bedside when Mr. Macallan and
Mrs. Beauly both came in together. Mrs. Macallan cast a strange
look on them (a look I cannot at all describe), and bade them
leave her. Mrs. Beauly, looking very much frightened, withdrew
immediately. Mr. Macallan advanced a step or two nearer to the
bed. His wife looked at him again in the same strange way, and
cried out--half as if she was threatening him, half as if she was
entreating him--'Leave me with the nurse. Go!' He only waited to
say to me in a whisper, 'The doctor is sent for,' and then he
left the room.
<P>
"Before Mr. Gale arrived Mrs. Macallan was violently sick. What
came from her was muddy and frothy, and faintly streaked with
blood. When Mr. Gale saw it he looked very serious. I heard him
say to himself, 'What does this mean?' He did his best to relieve
Mrs. Macallan, but with no good result that I could see. After a
time she seemed to suffer less. Then more sickness came on. Then
there was another intermission. Whether she was suffering or not,
I observed that her hands and feet (whenever I touched them)
remained equally cold. Also, the doctor's report of her pulse was
always the same--'very small and feeble.' I said to Mr. Gale,
'What is to be done, sir?' And Mr. Gale said to me, 'I won't take
the responsibility on myself any longer; I must have a physician
from Edinburgh.'
<P>
"The fastest horse in the stables at Gleninch was put into a
dog-cart, and the coachman drove away full speed to Edinburgh to
fetch the famous Doctor Jerome.
<P>
"While we were waiting for the physician, Mr. Macallan came into
his wife's room with Mr. Gale. Exhausted as she was, she
instantly lifted her hand and signed to him to leave her. He
tried by soothing words to persuade her to let him stay. No! She
still insisted on sending him out of her room. He seemed to feel
it--at such a time, and in the presence of the doctor. Before she
was aware of him, he suddenly stepped up to the bedside and
kissed her on the forehead. She shrank from him with a scream.
Mr. Gale interfered, and led him out of the room.
<P>
"In the afternoon Doctor Jerome arrived.
<P>
"The great physician came just in time to see her seized with
another attack of sickness. He watched her attentively, without
speaking a word. In the interval when the sickness stopped, he
still studied her, as it were, in perfect silence. I thought he
would never have done examining her. When he was at last
satisfied, he told me to leave him alone with Mr. Gale. 'We will
ring,' he said, 'when we want you here again.'
<P>
"It was a long time before they rang for me. The coachman was
sent for before I was summoned back to the bedroom. He was
dispatched to Edinburgh for the second time, with a written
message from Dr. Jerome to his head servant, saying that there
was no chance of his returning to the city and to his patients
for some hours to come. Some of us thought this looked badly for
Mrs. Macallan. Others said it might mean that the doctor had
hopes of saving her, but expected to be a long time in doing it.
<P>
"At last I was sent for. On my presenting myself in the bedroom,
Doctor Jerome went out to speak to Mr. Macallan, leaving Mr. Gale
along with me. From that time as long as the poor lady lived I
was never left alone with her. One of the two doctors was always
in her room. Refreshments were prepared for them; but still they
took it in turns to eat their meal, one relieving the other at
the bedside. If they had administered remedies to their patient,
I should not have been surprised by this proceeding. But they
were at the end of their remedies; their only business the seemed
to be to keep watch. I was puzzled to account for this. Keeping
watch was the nurse's business. I thought the conduct of the
doctors very strange.
<P>
" By the time that the lamp was lighted in the sick-room I could
see that the end was near. Excepting an occasional feeling of
cramp in her legs, she seemed to suffer less. But her eyes looked
sunk in her head; her skin was cold and clammy; her lips had
turned to a bluish paleness. Nothing roused her now--excepting
the last attempt made by her husband to see her. He came in with
Doctor Jerome, looking like a man terror-struck. She was past
speaking; but the moment she saw him she feebly made signs and
sounds which showed that she was just as resolved as ever not to
let him come near her. He was so overwhelmed that Mr. Gale was
obliged to help him out of the room. No other person was allowed
to see the patient. Mr. Dexter and Mrs. Beauly made their
inquiries outside the door, and were not invited in. As the
evening drew on the doctors sat on either side of the bed,
silently watching her, silently waiting for her death.
<P>
"Toward eight o'clock she seemed to have lost the use of her
hands and arms: they lay helpless outside the bed-clothes. A
little later she sank into a sort of dull sleep. Little by little
the sound of her heavy breathing grew fainter. At twenty minutes
past nine Doctor Jerome told me to bring the lamp to the bedside.
He looked at her, and put his hand on her heart. Then he said to
me, 'You can go downstairs, nurse: it is all over.' He turned to
Mr. Gale. 'Will you inquire if Mr. Macallan can see us?' he said.
I opened the door for Mr. Gale, and followed him out. Doctor
Jerome called me back for a moment, and told me to give him the
key of the door. I did so, of course; but I thought this also
very strange. When I got down to the servants' hall I found there
was a general feeling that something was wrong. We were all
uneasy--without knowing why.
<P>
"A little later the two doctors left the house. Mr. Macallan had
been quite incapable of receiving them and hearing what they had
to say. In this difficulty they had spoken privately with Mr.
Dexter, as Mr. Macallan's old friend, and the only gentleman then
staying at Gleninch.
<P>
"Before bed-time I went upstairs to prepare the remains of the
deceased lady for the coffin. The room in which she lay was
locked, the door leading into Mr. Macallan's room being secured,
as well as the door leading into the corridor. The keys had been
taken away by Mr. Gale. Two of the men-servants were posted
outside the bedroom to keep watch. They were to be relieved at
four in the morning--that was all they could tell me.
<P>
"In the absence of any explanations or directions, I took the
liberty of knocking at the door of Mr. Dexter's room. From his
lips I first heard the startling news. Both the doctors had
refused to give the usual certificate of death! There was to be a
medical examination of the body the next morning."
<P>
 There the examination of the nurse, Christina Ormsay, came to an
end.
<P>
Ignorant as I was of the law, I could see what impression the
evidence (so far) was intended to produce on the minds of the
jury. After first showing that my husband had had two
opportunities of administering the poison--once in the medicine
and once in the tea--the counsel for the Crown led the jury to
infer that the prisoner had taken those opportunities to rid
himself of an ugly and jealous wife, whose detestable temper he
could no longer endure.
<P>
Having directed his examination to the attainment of this object,
the Lord Advocate had done with the witness. The Dean of
Faculty--acting in the prisoner's interests--then rose to bring
out the favorable side of the wife's character by cross-examining
the nurse. If he succeeded in this attempt, the jury might
reconsider their conclusion that the wife was a person who had
exasperated her husband beyond endurance. In that case, where (so
far) was the husband's motive for poisoning her? and where was
the presumption of the prisoner's guilt?
<P>
Pressed by this skillful lawyer, the nurse was obliged to exhibit
my husband's first wife under an entirely new aspect. Here is the
substance of what the Dean of Faculty extracted from Christina
Ormsay:
<P>
"I persist in declaring that Mrs. Macallan had a most violent
temper. But she was certainly in the habit of making amends for
the offense that she gave by her violence. When she was quiet
again she always made her excuses to me, and she made them with a
good grace. Her manners were engaging at such times as these. She
spoke and acted like a well-bred lady. Then, again, as to her
personal appearance. Plain as she was in face, she had a good
figure; her hands and feet, I was told, had been modeled by a
sculptor. She had a very pleasant voice, and she was reported
when in health to sing beautifully. She was also (if her maid's
account was to be trusted) a pattern in the matter of dressing
for the other ladies in the neighborhood. Then, as to Mrs.
Beauly, though she was certainly jealous of the beautiful young
widow, she had shown at the same time that she was capable of
controlling that feeling. It was through Mrs. Macallan that Mrs.
Beauly was in the house. Mrs. Beauly had wished to postpone her
visit on account of the state of Mrs. Macallan's health. It was
Mrs. Macallan herself--not her husband--who decided that Mrs.
Beauly should not be disappointed, and should pay her visit to
Gleninch then and there. Further, Mrs. Macallan (in spite of her
temper) was popular with her friends and popular with her
servants. There was hardly a dry eye in the house when it was
known she was dying. And, further still, in those little domestic
disagreements at which the nurse had been present, Mr. Macallan
had never lost his temper, and had never used harsh language: he
seemed to be more sorry than angry when the quarrels took
place."--Moral for the jury: Was this the sort of woman who would
exasperate a man into poisoning her? And was this the sort of man
who would be capable of poisoning his wife?
<P>
Having produced this salutary counter-impression, the Dean of
Faculty sat down; and the medical witnesses were called next.
<P>
Here the evidence was simply irresistible.
<P>
Dr. Jerome and Mr. Gale positively swore that the symptoms of the
illness were the symptoms of poisoning by arsenic. The surgeon
who had performed the post-mortem examination followed. He
positively swore that the appearance of the internal organs
proved Doctor Jerome and Mr. Gale to be right in declaring that
their patient had died poisoned. Lastly, to complete this
overwhelming testimony, two analytical chemists actually produced
in Court the arsenic which they had found in the body, in a
quantity admittedly sufficient to have killed two persons instead
