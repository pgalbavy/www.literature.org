Benham corresponded with Amanda until the summer of 1913.  Sometimes
the two wrote coldly to one another, sometimes with warm affection,
sometimes with great bitterness.  When he met White in Johannesburg
durtter.  Finally they invoked
the manager.  He was still contemplating the scene of the disorder
when the precipitate retreat of his subordinates warned him of
Benham's return.
<P>
Benham was smoking a cigarette and his bearing was reassuringly
tranquil.
<P>
"I had a kind of nightmare," he said.  "I am fearfully sorry to have
disarranged your room.  You must charge me for the inconvenience as
well as for the damage.
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
"An aristocrat cannot be a lover."
<P>
"One cannot serve at once the intricacies of the wider issues of
life and the intricacies of another human being.  I do not mean that
one may not love.  One loves the more because one does not
concentrate one's love.  One loves nations, the people passing in
the street, beasts hurt by the wayside, troubled scoundrels and
university dons in tears. . . .
<P>
"But if one does not give one's whole love and life into a woman's
hands I do not think one can expect to be loved.
<P>
"An aristocrat must do without close personal love. . . ."
<P>
This much was written at the top of a sheet of paper.  The writing
ended halfway down the page.  Manifestly it was an abandoned
beginning.  And it was, it seemed to White, the last page of all
this confusion of matter that dealt with the Second and Third
Limitations.  Its incompleteness made its expression perfect. . . .
<P>
There Benham's love experience ended.  He turned to the great
business of the world.  Desire and Jealousy should deflect his life
no more; like Fear they were to be dismissed as far as possible and
subdued when they could not be altogether dismissed.  Whatever
stirrings of blood or imagination there were in him after that
parting, whatever failures from this resolution, they left no trace
on the rest of his research, which was concerned with the hates of
peoples and classes and war and peace and the possibilities science
unveils and starry speculations of what mankind may do.
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
But Benham did not leave England again until he had had an encounter
with Lady Marayne.
<P>
The little lady came to her son in a state of extraordinary anger
and distress.  Never had she seemed quite so resolute nor quite so
hopelessly dispersed and mixed.  And when for a moment it seemed to
him that she was not as a matter of fact dispersed and mixed at all,
then with an instant eagerness he dismissed that one elucidatory
gleam.  "What are you doing in England, Poff?" she demanded.  "And
what are you going to do?
<P>
"Nothing!  And you are going to leave her in your house, with your
property and a lover.  If that's it, Poff, why did you ever come
back?  And why did you ever marry her?  You might have known; her
father was a swindler.  She's begotten of deceit.  She'll tell her
own story while you are away, and a pretty story she'll make of it."
<P>
"Do you want me to divorce her and make a scandal?"
<P>
"I never wanted you to go away from her.  If you'd stayed and
watched her as a man should, as I begged you and implored you to do.
Didn't I tell you, Poff?  Didn't I warn you?"
<P>
"But now what am I to do?"
<P>
"There you are!  That's just a man's way.  You get yourself into
this trouble, you follow your passions and your fancies and fads and
then you turn to me!  How can I help you now, Poff?  If you'd
listened to me before!"
<P>
Her blue eyes were demonstratively round.
<P>
"Yes, but--"
<P>
"I warned you," she interrupted.  "I warned you.  I've done all I
could for you.  It isn't that I haven't seen through her.  When she
came to me at first with that made-up story of a baby!  And all
about loving me like her own mother.  But I did what I could.  I
thought we might still make the best of a bad job.  And then--.  I
might have known she couldn't leave Pip alone. . . .  But for weeks
I didn't dream.  I wouldn't dream.  Right under my nose.  The
impudence of it!"
<P>
Her voice broke.  "Such a horrid mess!  Such a hopeless, horrid
mess!"
<P>
She wiped away a bright little tear. . . .
<P>
"It's all alike.  It's your way with us.  All of you.  There isn't a
man in the world deserves to have a woman in the world.  We do all
we can for you.  We do all we can to amuse you, we dress for you and
we talk for you.  All the sweet, warm little women there are!  And
then you go away from us!  There never was a woman yet who pleased
and satisfied a man, who did not lose him.  Give you everything and
off you must go!  Lovers, mothers. . . ."
<P>
It dawned upon Benham dimly that his mother's troubles did not deal
exclusively with himself.
<P>
"But Amanda," he began.
<P>
"If you'd looked after her properly, it would hing the strike period of 1913,
he was on his way to see her in
London and to settle their relationship upon a new and more definite
footing.  It was her suggestion that they should meet.
<P>
About her he felt an enormous, inexorable, dissatisfaction.  He
could not persuade himself that his treatmee evil between different
kinds of men is due to uncultivated feeling, to natural bad feeling,
but far more is it due to bad thinking."  At times he seemed on the
verge of the persuasion that most human trouble is really due to bad
metaphysics.  It was, one must remark, an extraordinary journey he
had made; he had started from chivalry and arrived at metaphysics;
every knight he held must be a logician, and ultimate bravery is
courage of the mind.  One thinks of his coming to this conclusion
with knit brows and balancing intentness above whole gulfs of
bathos--very much as he had once walked the Leysin Bisse. . . .
<P>
"Men do not know how to think," he insisted--getting along the
planks; "and they will not realize that they do not know how to
think.  Nine-tenths of the wars in the world have arisen out of
misconceptions. . . .  Misconception is the sin and dishonour of the
mind, and muddled thinking as ignoble as dirty conduct. . . .
Infinitely more disastrous."
<P>
And again he wrote: "Man, I see, is an over-practical creature, too
eager to get into action.  There is our deepest trouble.  He takes
conclusions ready-made, or he makes themave been right
enough.  Pip was as good as gold until she undermined him. . . .  A
woman can't wait about like an umbrella in a stand. . . .  He was
just a boy. . . .  Only of course there she was--a novelty.  It is
perfectly easy to understand.  She flattered him. . . .  Men are
such fools."
<P>
"Still--it's no good saying that now."
<P>
"But she'll spend all your money, Poff!  She'll break your back with
debts.  What's to prevent her?  With him living on her!  For that's
what it comes to practically."
<P>
"Well, what am I to do?"
<P>
"You aren't going back without tying her up, Poff?  You ought to
stop every farthing of her money--every farthing.  It's your duty."
<P>
"I can't do things like that."
<P>
"But have you no Shame?  To let that sort of thing go on!"
<P>
"If I don't feel the Shame of it--  And I don't."
<P>
"And that money--.  I got you that money, Poff!  It was my money."
<P>
Benham stared at her perplexed.  "What am I to do?" he asked.
<P>
"Cut her off, you silly boy!  Tie her up!  Pay her through a
solicitor.  Say that if she sees him ONCE again--"
<P>
He reflected.  "No," he said at last.
<P>
"Poff!" she cried, "every time I see you, you are more and more like
your father.  You're going off--just as he did.  That baffled,
MULISH look--priggish--solemn!  Oh! it's strange the stuff a poor
woman has to bring into the world.  But you'll do nothing.  I know
you'll do nothing.  You'll stand everything.  You--you Cuckold!  And
she'll drive by me, she'll pass me in theatres with the money that
ought to have been mine!  Oh!  Oh!"
<P>
She dabbed her handkerchief from one swimming eye to the other.  But
she went on talking.  Faster and faster, less and less coherently;
more and more wildly abusive.  Presently in a brief pause of the
storm Benham sighed profoundly. . . .
<P>
It brought the scene to a painful end. . . .
<P>
For weeks her distress pursued and perplexed him.
<P>
He had an extraordinary persuasion that in some obscure way he was
in default, that he was to blame for her distress, that he owed her--
he could never define what he owed her.
<P>
And yet, what on earth was one to do?
<P>
And something his mother had said gave him the odd idea that he had
misjudged his father, that he had missed depths of perplexed and
kindred goodwill.  He went down to see him before he returned to
India.  But if there was a hidden well of feeling in Mr. Benham
senior, it had been very carefully boarded over.  The parental mind
and attention were entirely engaged in a dispute in the SCHOOL WORLD
about the heuristic method.  Somebody had been disrespectnt of her and that
his
relations to her squared with any of his preconceptions of nobility,
and yet at no precise point could he detect where he had definitely
taken an ignoble step.  Through Amanda he was coming to the full
experience of life.  Like all of us he had been prepared, he had
prepared himself, to take life in a certain way, and life had taken
him, as it takes all of us, in an entirely different and unexpected
way. . . .  He had been ready for noble deeds and villainies, for
achievements and failures, and here as the dominant fact of his
personal life was a perplexing riddle.  He could not hate and
condemn her for ten minutes at a time without a flow of exoneration;
he could not think of her tolerantly or lovingly without immediate
shame and resentment, and with the utmost will in the world he could
not banish her from his mind.
<P>
During the intervening years he had never ceased to have her in his
mind; he would not think of her it is true if he could help it, but
often he could not help it, and as a negative presence, as a thing
denied, she was almost more potent than she had been as a thing
accepted.  Meanwhile he worked.  His nervous irritability increased,
but it did not hinder the steady development of his Research.
<P>
Long before his final parting from Amanda he had worked out his idea
and method for all the more personal problems in life; the problems
he put together under his headings of the first three "Limitations."
He had resolved to emancipate himself from fear, indulgence, and
that instinctive preoccupation with the interests and dignity of
self which he chose to term Jealousy, and with the one tremendous
exception of Amanda he had to a large extent succeeded.  Amanda.
Amanda.  Amanda.  He stuck the more grimly to his Research to drown
that beating in his brain.
<P>
Emancipation from all these personal things he held now to be a mere
prelude to the real work of a man's life, which was to serve this
dream of a larger human purpose.  The bulk of his work was to
discover and define that purpose, that purpose which must be the
directing and comprehending form of all the activities of the noble
life.  One cannot be noble, he had come to perceive, at large; one
must be noble to an end.  To make human life, collectively and in
detail, a thing more comprehensive, more beautiful, more generous
and coherent than it is to-day seemed to him the fundamental
intention of all nobility.  He believed more and more firmly that
the impulses to make and help and subserve great purposes are
abundantly present in the world, that they are inhibited by hasty
thinking, limited thinking and bad thinking, and that the real
ennoblement of human life was not so much a creation as a release.
He lumped the preventive and destructive forces that keep men
dispersed, unhappy, and ignoble under the heading of Prejudice, and
he made this Prejudice his fourth and greatest and most difficult
limitation.  In one place he had written it, "Prejudice or
Divisions."  That being subdued in oneself and in the world, then in
the measure of its subjugation, the new life of our race, the great
age, the noble age, would begin.
<P>
So he set himself to examine his own mind and the mind of the world
about him for prejudice, for hampering follies, disguised
disloyalties and mischievous distrusts, and the great bulk of the
papers that White struggled with at Westhaven Street were devoted to
various aspects of this search for "Prejudice."  It seemed to White
to be at once the most magnificent and the most preposterous of
enterprises.  It was indeed no less than an enquiry into all the
preventable sources of human failure and disorder.  .  .  And it was
all too manifest to White also that the last place in which Benham
was capable of detecting a prejudice was at the back of his own
head.
<P>
Under this Fourth Limitation he put the most remarkable array of
influences, race-hatred, national suspicion, the evil side of
patriotism, religious and social intolerance, every social
consequence of muddle headedness, every dividing force indeed except
the purely personal dissensions between man and man.  And he
developed a metaphysical interpretation of these troubles.  "No
doubt," he wrote in one place, "much of th in a hurry.  Life is so
short that he thinks it better to err than wait.  He has no
patience, no faith in anything but himself.  He thinks he is a being
when in reality he is only a link in a being, and so he is more
anxious to be complete than right.  The last devotion of which he is
capable is that devotion of the mind which suffers partial
performance, but insists upon exhaustive thought.  He scamps his
thought and finishes his performance, and before he is dead it is
already being abandoned and begun all over again by some one else in
the same egotistical haste. . . ."
<P>
It is, I suppose, a part of the general humour of life that these
words should have been written by a man who walked the plank to
fresh ideas with the dizziest difficulty unless he had Prothero to
drag him forward, and who acted time after time with an altogether
disastrous hastiness.
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
Yet there was a kind of necessity in this journey of Benham's from
the cocked hat and wooden sword of Seagate and his early shame at
cowardice and baseness to the spiritual megalomania of his complete
Research Magnificent.  You can no more resolve to live a life of
honour nowadays and abstain from social and political scheming on a
world-wide scale, than you can profess religion and refuse to think
about God.  In the past it was possible to take all sorts of things
for granted and be loyal to unexamined things.  One could be loyal
to unexamined things because they were unchallenged things.  But now
everything is challenged.  By the time of his second visit to
Russia, Benham's ideas of conscious and deliberate aristocracy
reaching out to an idea of universal responsibility had already
grown into the extraordinary fantasy that he was, as it were, an
uncrowned king in the world.  To be noble is to be aristocratic,
that is to say, a ruler.  Thence it follows that aristocracy is
multiple kingship, and to be an aristocrat is to partake both of the
nature of philosopher and king. . . .
<P>
Yet it is manifest that the powerful people of this world are by no
means necessarily noble, and that most modern kings, poor in
quality, petty in spirit, conventional in outlook, controlled and
limited, fall far short of kingship.  Nevertheless, there IS
nobility, there IS kingship, or this earth is a dustbin and mankind
but a kind of skin-disease upon a planet.  From that it is an easy
step to this idea, the idea whose first expression had already so
touched the imagination of Amanda, of a sort of diffused and
voluntary kingship scattered throughout mankind.  The aristocrats
are not at the high table, the kings are not enthroned, those who
are enthroned are but pretenders and SIMULACRA, kings of the vulgar;
the real king and ruler is every man who sets aside the naive
passions and self-interest of the common life for the rule and
service of the world.
<P>
This is an idea that is now to be found in much contemporary
writing.  It is one of those ideas that seem to appear
simultaneously at many points in the world, and it is impossible to
say now how far Benham was an originator of this idea, and how far
he simply resonated to its expression by others.  It was far more
likely that Prothero, getting it heaven knows where, had spluttered
it out and forgotten it, leaving it to germinate in the mind of his
friend. . . .
<P>
This lordly, this kingly dream became more and more essential to
Benham as his life went on.  When Benham walked the Bisse he was
just a youngster resolved to be individually brave; when he prowled
in the jungle by night he was there for all mankind.  With every
year he became more and more definitely to himself a consecrated man
as kings are consecrated.  Only that he was self-consecrated, and
anointed only in his heart.  At last he was, so to speak, Haroun al
Raschid again, going unsuspected about the world, because the palace
of his security would not tell him the secrets of men's disorders.
He was no longer a creature of circumstances, he was kingly,
unknown, Alfred in the Camp of the Danes.  In the great later
accumulations of his Research the personal matter, the
introspection, the intimate discussion of motive, becomes less and
less.  He forgets himself in the exaltation of kingliness.  He
worries less and less over the particular rightness of his definite
acts.  In these later papers White found Benham abstracted, self-
forgetful, trying to find out with an ever increased self-
detachment, with an ever deepening regal solicitude, why there are
massacres, wars, tyrannies and persecutions, why we let famine,
disease and beasts assail us, and want dwarf and cripple vast
multitudes in the midst of possible plenty.  And when he foundrejudice.  His
examination of the social and political condition of
Russiaty and swarming with
naked black children, and yet all the time they seemed to be in a
wilderness.  They forded rivers, they had at times to force
themselves through thickets, once or twice they lost their way, and
always ahead of them, purple and sullen, the great mountain peak
with La Ferriere upon its crest rose slowly out of the background
until it domina out
and as far as he found out, he meant quite simply and earnestly to
apply his knowledge. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>
3
<P>
<P>
The intellectualism of Benham intensified to the end.  His
definition of Prejudice impressed White as being the most bloodless
and philosophical formula that ever dominated the mind of a man.
<P>
"Prejudice," Benham had written, "is that common incapacity of the
human mind to understand that a difference in any respect is not a
difference in all respects, reinforced and rendered malignant by an
instinctive hostility to what is unlike ourselves.  We exaggerate
classification and then charge it with mischievous emotion by
referring it to ourselves."  And under this comprehensive formula he
proceeded to study and attack Family Prejudice, National Prejudice,
Race Prejudice, War, Class Prejudice, Professional Prejudice, Sex
Prejudice, in the most industrious and elaborate manner.  Whether
one regards one's self or others he held that these prejudices are
evil things.  "From the point of view of human welfare they break
men up into wars and conflicts, make them an easy prey to those who
trade upon suspicion and hostility, prevent sane collective co-
operations, cripple and embitter life.  From the point of view of
personal aristocracy they make men vulgar, violent, unjust and
futile.  All the conscious life of the aristocrat must be a constant
struggle against false generalizations; it is as much his duty to
free himself from that as from fear, indulgence, and jealousy; it is
a larger and more elaborate task, but it is none the less cardinal
and essential.  Indeed it is more cardinal and essential.  The true
knight has to be not only no coward, no self-pamperer, no egotist.
He has to be a philosopher.  He has to be no hasty or foolish
thinker.  His judgment no more than his courage is to be taken by
surprise.
<P>
"To subdue fear, desire and jealousy, is the aristocrat's personal
affair, it is his ritual and discipline, like a knight watching his
arms; but the destruction of division and prejudice and all their
forms and establishments, is his real task, that is the common work
of knighthood.  It is a task to be done in a thousand ways; one man
working by persuasion, another by example, this one overthrowing
some crippling restraint upon the freedom of speech and the spread
of knowledge, and that preparing himself for a war that will shatter
a tyrannous presumption.  Most imaginative literature, all
scientific investigation, all sound criticism, all good building,
all good manufacture, all sound politics, every honesty and every
reasoned kindliness contribute to this release of men from the heat
and confusions of our present world."
<P>
It was clear to White that as Benham progressed with this major part
of his research, he was more and more possessed by the idea that he
was not making his own personal research alone, but, side by side
with a vast, masked, hidden and once unsuspected multitude of
others; that this great idea of his was under kindred forms the
great idea of thousands, that it was breaking as the dawn breaks,
simultaneously to great numbers of people, and that the time was not
far off when the new aristocracy, the disguised rulers of the world,
would begin to realize their common bent and effort.  Into these
latter papers there creeps more and more frequently a new
phraseology, such expressions as the "Invisible King" and the
"Spirit of Kingship," so that as Benham became personally more and
more solitary, his thoughts became more and more public and social.
<P>
Benham was not content to define and denounce the prejudices of
mankind.  He set himself to study just exactly how these prejudices
worked, to get at the nature and habits and strengths of each kind
of prejudice, and to devise means for its treatment, destruction or
neutralization.  He had no great faith in the power of pure
reasonableness; his psychological ideas were modern, and he had
grasped the fact that the power of most of the great prejudices that
strain humanity lies deeper than the intellectual level.
Consequently he sought to bring himself into the closest contact
with prejudices in action and prejudices in conflict in order to
discover their sub-rational springs.
<P>
A large proportion of that larger moiety of the material at
Westhaven Street which White from his extensive experience of the
public patience decided could not possibly "make a book," consisted
of notes and discussions upon the first-hand observations Benham had
made in this or that part of the world.  He began in Russia during
the revolutionary trouble of 1906, he went thence to Odessa, and
from place to place in Bessarabia and Kieff, where during a pogrom
he had his first really illuminating encounter with race and culture
p seems to have left him much more hopeful than was the common
feeling of liberal-minded people during the years of depression that
followed the revolution of 1906, and it was upon the race question
that his attention concentrated.
<P>
The Swadeshi outbreak drew him from Russia to India.  Here in an
entirely different environment was another discord of race and
culture, and he found in his study of it much that illuminated and
corrected his impressions of the Russian issue.  A whole drawer was
devoted to a comparatively finished and very thorough enquiry into
human dissensions in lower Bengal.  Here there were not only race
but culture conflicts, and he could work particularly upon the
differences between men of the same race who were Hindus, Christians
and Mahometans respectively.  He could compare the Bengali Mahometan
not only with the Bengali Brahminist, but also with the Mahometan
from the north-west.  "If one could scrape off all the creed and
training, would one find much the same thing at the bottom, or
something fundamentally so different that no close homogeneous
social life and not even perhaps a life of just compromise is
possible between the different races of mankind?"
<P>
His answer to that was a confident one.  "There are no such natural
and unalterable differences in character and quality between any two
sorts of men whatever, as would make their peaceful and kindly co-
operation in the world impossible," he wrote.
<P>
But he was not satisfied with his observations in India.  He found
the prevalence of caste ideas antipathetic and complicating.  He
went on after his last parting from Amanda into China, it was the
first of several visits to China, and thence he crossed to America.
White found a number of American press-cuttings of a vehemently
anti-Japanese quality still awaiting digestion in a drawer, and it
was clear to him that Benham had given a considerable amount of
attention to the development of the "white" and "yellow" race
hostility on the Pacific slope; but his chief interest at that time
had been the negro.  He went to Washington and thence south; he
visited Tuskegee and Atlanta, and then went off at a tangent to
Hayti.  He was drawn to Hayti by Hesketh Pritchard's vivid book,
WHERE BLACK RULES WHITE, and like Hesketh Pritchard he was able to
visit that wonderful monument to kingship, the hidden fastness of La
Ferriere, the citadel built a century ago by the "Black Napoleon,"
the Emperor Christophe.  He went with a young American demonstrator
from Harvard.
<P>
<P>
<P>
4
<P>
<P>
It was a memorable excursion.  They rode from Cap Haytien for a
day's journey along dusty uneven tracks through a steaming plain of
luxurious vegetation, that presented the strangest mixture of
unbridled jungle with populous country.  They passed countless
villages of thatched huts alive with curiosited the landscape.  Long after
dark they blundered
upon rather than came to the village at its foot where they were to
pass the night.  They were interrogated under a flaring torch by
peering ragged black soldiers, and passed through a firelit crowd
into the presence of the local commandant to dispute volubly about
their right to go further.  They might have been in some remote
corner of Nigeria.  Their papers, laboriously got in order, were
vitiated by the fact, which only became apparent by degrees, that
the commandant could not read.  They carried their point with
difficulty.
<P>
But they carried their point, and, watched and guarded by a hungry
half-naked negro in a kepi and the remains of a sky-blue pair of
trousers, they explored one of the most exemplary memorials of
imperialism that humanity has ever made.  The roads and parks and
prospects constructed by this vanished Emperor of Hayti, had long
since disappeared, and the three men clambered for hours up ravines
and precipitous jungle tracks, occasionally crossing the winding
traces of a choked and ruined road that had once been the lordly
approach to his fastness.  Below they passed an abandoned palace of
vast extent, a palace with great terraces and the still traceable
outline of gardens, though there were green things pushing between
the terrace steps, and trees thrust out of the empty windows.  Here
from a belvedere of which the skull-like vestige still remained, the
negro Emperor Christophe, after fourteen years of absolute rule, had
watched for a time the smoke of the burning of his cane-fields in
the plain below, and then, learning that his bodyguard had deserted
him, had gone in and blown out his brains.
<P>
He had christened the place after the best of examples, "Sans
Souci."
<P>
But the citadel above, which was to have been his last defence, he
never used.  The defection of his guards made him abandon that.  To
build it, they say, cost Hayti thirty thousand lives.  He had the
true Imperial lavishness.  So high it was, so lost in a wilderness
of trees and bush, looking out over a land relapsed now altogether
to a barbarism of patch and hovel, so solitary and chill under the
tropical sky--for even the guards who still watched over its
suspected treasures feared to live in its ghostly galleries and had
made hovels outside its walls--and at the same time so huge and
grandiose--there were walls thirty feet thick, galleries with scores
of rust-eaten cannon, circular dining-halls, king's apartments and
queen's apartments, towering battlements and great arched doorways--
that it seemed to Benham to embody the power and passing of that
miracle of human history, tyranny, the helpless bowing of multitudes
before one man and the transitoriness of such glories, more
completely than anything he had ever seen or imagined in the world
before.  Beneath the battlements--they are choked above with jungle
grass and tamarinds and many flowery weeds--the precipice fell away
a sheer two thousand feet, and below spread a vast rich green plain
populous and diversified, bounded at last by the blue sea, like an
amethystine wall.  Over this precipice Christophe was wont to fling
his victims, and below this terrace were bottle-shaped dungeons
where men, broken and torn, thrust in at the neck-like hole above,
starved and died: it was his headquarters here, here he had his
torture chambers and the means for nameless cruelties. . . .
<P>
"Not a hundred years ago," said Benham's companion, and told the
story of the disgraced favourite, the youth who had offended.
<P>
"Leap," said his master, and the poor hypnotized wretch, after one
questioning glance at the conceivable alternatives, made his last
gesture of servility, and then stood out against the sky, swayed,
and with a convulsion of resolve, leapt and shot headlong down
through the shimmering air.
<P>
Came presently the little faint sound of his fall.
<P>
The Emperor satisfied turned away, unmindful of the fact that this
projectile he had launched had caught among the bushes below, and
presently struggled and found itself still a living man.  It could
scramble down to the road and, what is more wonderful, hope for
mercy.  An hour and it stood before Christophe again, with an arm
broken and bloody and a face torn, a battered thing now but with a
faint flavour of pride in its bearing.  "Your bidding has been done,
Sire," it said.
<P>
"So," said the Emperor, unappeased.  "And you live?  Well--  Leap
again. . . ."
<P>
And then came other stories.  The young man told them as he had
heard them, stories of ferocious wholesale butcheries, of men
standing along the walls of the banqueting chamber to be shot one by
one as the feast went on, of exquisite and terrifying cruelties, and
his one note of wonder, his refrain was, "HERE!  Not a hundred years
ago. . . .  It makes one almost believe that somewhere things of
this sort are being done now."
<P>
They ate their lunch together amidst the weedy flowery ruins.  The
lizards which had fled their coming crept out again to bask in the
sunshine.  The soldier-guide and guard scrabbled about with his
black fingers in the ruinous and rifled tomb of Christophe in a
search for some saleable memento. . . .
<P>
Benham sat musing in silence.  The thought of deliberate cruelty was
always an actual physical distress to him.  He sat bathed in the
dreamy afternoon sunlight and struggled against the pictures that
crowded into his mind, pictures of men aghast at death, and of fear-
driven men toiling in agony, and of the shame of extorted obedience
and of cringing and crawling black figures, and the defiance of
righteous hate beaten down under blow and anguish.  He saw eyes
alight with terror and lips rolled back in agony, he saw weary
hopeless flight before striding proud destruction, he saw the poor
trampled mangled dead, and he shivered in his soul. . . .
<P>
He hated Christophe and all that made Christophe; he hated pride,
and then the idea came to him that it is not pride that makes
Christophes but humility.
<P>
There is in the medley of man's composition, deeper far than his
superficial working delusion that he is a separated self-seeking
individual, an instinct for cooperation and obedience.  Every
natural sane man wants, though he may want it unwittingly, kingly
guidance, a definite direction for his own partial life.  At the
bottom of his heart he feels, even if he does not know it
definitely, that his life is partial.  He is driven to join himself
on.  He obeys decision and the appearance of strength as a horse
obeys its rider's voice.  One thinks of the pride, the uncontrolled
frantic will of this black ape of all Emperors, and one forgets the
universal docility that made him possible.  Usurpation is a crime to
which men are tempted by human dirigibility.  It is the orderly
peoples who create tyrants, and it is not so much restraint above as
stiff insubordination below that has to be taught to men.  There are
kings and tyrannies and imperialisms, simply because of the
unkingliness of men.
<P>
And as he sat upon the battlements of La Ferriere, Benham cast off
from his mind his last tolerance for earthly kings and existing
States, and expounded to another human being for the first time this
long-cherished doctrine of his of the Invisible King who is the lord
of human destiny, the spirit of nobility, who will one day take the
sceptre and rule the earth. . . .  To the young American's naive
American response to any simply felt emotion, he seemed with his
white earnestness and his glowing eyes a veritable prophet. . . .
<P>
"This is the root idea of aristocracy," said Benham.
<P>
"I have never heard the underlying spirit of democracy, the real
true Thing in democracy, so thoroughly expressed," said the young
American.
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
Benham's notes on race and racial cultures gave White tantalizing
glimpses of a number of picturesque experiences.  The adventure in
Kieff had first roused Benham to the reality of racial quality.  He
was caught in the wheels of a pogrom.
<P>
"Before that time I had been disposed to minimize and deny race.  I
still think it need not prevent men from the completest social co-
operation, but I see now better than I did how difficult it is for
any man to purge from his mind the idea that he is not primarily a
Jew, a Teuton, or a Kelt, but a man.  You can persuade any one in
five minutes that he or she belongs to some special and blessed and
privileged sort of human being; it takes a lifetime to destroy that
persuasion.  There are these confounded differences of colour, of
eye and brow, of nose or hair, small differences in themselves
except that they give a foothold and foundation for tremendous
fortifications of prejudice and tradition, in which hostilities and
hatreds may gather.  When I think of a Jew's nose, a Chinaman's eyes
or a negro's colour I am reminded of that fatal little pit which
nature has left in the vermiform appendix, a thing no use in itself
and of no significance, but a gathering-place for mischief.  The
extremest case of race-feeling is the Jewish case, and even here, I
am convinced, it is the Bible and the Talmud and the exertions of
those inevitable professional champions who live upon racial
feeling, far more than their common distinction of blood, which
holds this people together banded against mankind."
<P>
Between the lines of such general propositions as this White read
little scraps of intimation that linked with the things Benham let
fall in Johannesburg to reconstruct the Kieff adventure.
<P>
Benham had been visiting a friend in the country on the further side
of the Dnieper.  As they drove back along dusty stretches of road
amidst fields of corn and sunflower and through bright little
villages, they saw against the evening blue under the full moon a
smoky red glare rising from amidst the white houses and dark trees
of the town.  "The pogrom's begun," said Benham's friend, and was
surprised when Benham wanted to end a pleasant day by going to see
what happens after the beginning of a pogrom.
<P>
He was to have several surprises before at last he left Benham in
disgust and went home by himself.
<P>
For Benham, with that hastiness that so flouted his exalted
theories, passed rapidly from an attitude of impartial enquiry to
active intervention.  The two men left their carriage and plunged
into the network of unlovely dark streets in which the Jews and
traders harboured. . . .  Benham's first intervention was on behalf
of a crouching and yelping bundle of humanity that was being dragged
about and kicked at a street corner.  The bundle resolved itself
into a filthy little old man, and made off with extraordinary
rapidity, while Benham remonstrated with the kickers.  Benham's
tallness, his very Gentile face, his good clothes, and an air of
tense authority about him had its effect, and the kickers shuffled
off with remarks that were partly apologies.  But Benham's friend
revolted.  This was no business of theirs.
<P>
Benham went on unaccompanied towards the glare of the burning
houses.
<P>
For a time he watched.  Black figures moved between him and the
glare, and he tried to find out the exact nature of the conflict by
enquiries in clumsy Russian.  He was told that the Jews had insulted
a religious procession, that a Jew had spat at an ikon, that the
shop of a cheating Jew trader had been set on fire, and that the
blaze had spread to the adjacent group of houses.  He gathered that
the Jews were running out of the burning block on the other side
"like rats."  The crowd was mostly composed of town roughs with a
sprinkling of peasants.  They were mischievous but undecided.  Among
them were a number of soldiers, and he was surprised to see a
policemen, brightly lit from head to foot, watching the looting of a
shop that was still untouched by the flames.
<P>
He held back some men who had discovered a couple of women's figures
slinking along in the shadow beneath a wall.  Behind his
remonstrances the Jewesses escaped.  His anger against disorder was
growing upon him. . . .
<P>
Late that night Benham found himself the leading figure amidst a
party of Jews who had made a counter attack upon a gang of roughs in
a court that had become the refuge of a crowd of fugitives.  Some of
the young Jewish men had already been making a fight, rather a poor
and hopeless fight, from the windows of the house near the entrance
of the court, but it is doubtful if they would have made an
effective resistance if it had not been for this tall excited
stranger who was suddenly shouting directions to them in
sympathetically murdered Russian.  It was not that he brought
powerful blows or subtle strategy to their assistance, but that he
put heart into them and perplexity into his adversaries because he
was so manifestly non-partizan.  Nobody could ever have mistaken
Benham for a Jew.  When at last towards dawn a not too zealous
governor called out the troops and began to clear the streets of
rioters, Benham and a band of Jews were still keeping the gateway of
that court behind a hasty but adequate barricade of furniture and
handbarrows.
<P>
The ghetto could not understand him, nobody could understand him,
but it was clear a rare and precious visitor had come to their
rescue, and he was implored by a number of elderly, dirty, but very
intelligent-looking old men to stay with them and preserve them
until their safety was assured.
<P>
They could not understand him, but they did their utmost to
entertain him and assure him of their gratitude.  They seemed to
consider him as a representative of the British Government, and
foreign intervention on their behalf is one of those unfortunate
fixed ideas that no persecuted Jews seem able to abandon.
<P>
Benham found himself, refreshed and tended, sitting beside a wood
fire in an inner chamber richly flavoured by humanity and listening
to a discourse in evil but understandable German.  It was a
discourse upon the wrongs and the greatness of the Jewish people--
and it was delivered by a compact middle-aged man with a big black
beard and long-lashed but animated eyes.  Beside him a very old man
dozed and nodded approval.  A number of other men crowded the
apartment, including several who had helped to hold off the rioters
from the court.  Some could follow the talk and ever again endorsed
the speaker in Yiddish or Russian; others listened with tantalized
expressions, their brows knit, their lips moving.
<P>
It was a discourse Benham had provoked.  For now he was at the very
heart of the Jewish question, and he could get some light upon the
mystery of this great hatred at first hand.  He did not want to hear
tales of outrages, of such things he knew, but he wanted to
understand what was the irritation that caused these things.
<P>
So he listened.  The Jew dilated at first on the harmlessness and
usefulness of the Jews.
<P>
"But do you never take a certain advantage?" Benham threw out.
<P>
"The Jews are cleverer than the Russians.  Must we suffer for that?"
<P>
The spokesman went on to the more positive virtues of his race.
Benham suddenly had that uncomfortable feeling of the Gentile who
finds a bill being made against him.  Did the world owe Israel
nothing for Philo, Aron ben Asher, Solomon Gabriol, Halevy,
Mendelssohn, Heine, Meyerbeer, Rubinstein, Joachim, Zangwill?  Does
Britain owe nothing to Lord Beaconsfield, Montefiore or the
Rothschilds?  Can France repudiate her debt to Fould, Gaudahaux,
Oppert, or Germany to Furst, Steinschneider, Herxheimer, Lasker,
Auerbach, Traube and Lazarus and Benfey? . . .
<P>
Benham admitted under the pressure of urgent tones and gestures that
these names did undoubtedly include the cream of humanity, but was
it not true that the Jews did press a little financially upon the
inferior peoples whose lands they honoured in their exile?
<P>
The man with the black beard took up the challenge bravely.
<P>
"They are merciful creditors," he said.  "And it is their genius to
possess and control.  What better stewards could you find for the
wealth of nations than the Jews?  And for the honours?  That always
had been the role of the Jews--stewardship.  Since the days of
Joseph in Egypt. . . ."
<P>
Then in a lower voice he went on to speak of the deficiencies of the
Gentile population.  He wished to be just and generous but the truth
was the truth.  The Christian Russians loved drink and laziness;
they had no sense of property; were it not for unjust laws even now
the Jews would possess all the land of South Russia. . . .
<P>
Benham listened with a kind of fascination.  "But," he said.
<P>
It was so.  And with a confidence that aroused a protest or so from
the onlookers, the Jewish apologist suddenly rose up, opened a safe
close beside the fire and produced an armful of documents.
<P>
"Look!" he said, "all over South Russia there are these!"
<P>
Benham was a little slow to understand, until half a dozen of these
papers had been thrust into his hand.  Eager fingers pointed, and
several voices spoke.  These things were illegalities that might
some day be legal; there were the records of loans and hidden
transactions that might at any time put all the surrounding soil
into the hands of the Jew.  All South Russia was mortgaged. . . .
<P>
"But is it so?" asked Benham, and for a time ceased to listen and
stared into the fire.
<P>
Then he held up the papers in his hand to secure silence and,
feeling his way in unaccustomed German, began to speak and continued
to speak in spite of a constant insurgent undertone of interruption
from the Jewish spokesman.
<P>
All men, Benham said, were brothers.  Did they not remember Nathan
the Wise?
<P>
"I did not claim him," said the spokesman, misunderstanding.  "He is
a character in fiction."
<P>
But all men are brothers, Benham maintained.  They had to be
merciful to one another and give their gifts freely to one another.
Also they had to consider each other's weaknesses.  The Jews were
probably justified in securing and administering the property of
every community into which they came, they were no doubt right in
claiming to be best fitted for that task, but also they had to
consider, perhaps more than they did, the feelings and vanities of
the host population into which they brought these beneficent
activities.  What was said of the ignorance, incapacity and vice of
the Roumanians and Russians was very generally believed and
accepted, but it did not alter the fact that the peasant, for all
his incapacity, did like to imagine he owned his own patch and hovel
and did have a curious irrational hatred of debt. . . .
<P>
The faces about Benham looked perplexed.
<P>
"THIS," said Benham, tapping the papers in his hand.  "They will not
understand the ultimate benefit of it.  It will be a source of anger
and fresh hostility.  It does not follow because your race has
supreme financial genius that you must always follow its dictates to
the exclusion of other considerations. . . ."
<P>
The perplexity increased.
<P>
Benham felt he must be more general.  He went on to emphasize the
brotherhood of man, the right to equal opportunity, equal privilege,
freedom to develop their idiosyncrasies as far as possible,
unhindered by the idiosyncrasies of others.  He could feel the
sympathy and understanding of his hearers returning.  "You see,"
said Benham, "you must have generosity.  You must forget ancient
scores.  Do you not see the world must make a fresh beginning?"
<P>
He was entirely convinced he had them with him.  The heads nodded
assent, the bright eyes and lips followed the slow disentanglement
of his bad German.
<P>
"Free yourselves and the world," he said.
<P>
Applause.
<P>
"And so," he said breaking unconsciously into English, "let us begin
by burning these BEASTLY mortgages!"
<P>
And with a noble and dramatic gesture Benham cast his handful on the
fire.  The assenting faces became masks of horror.  A score of hands
clutched at those precious papers, and a yell of dismay and anger
filled the room.  Some one caught at his throat from behind.  "Don't
kill him!" cried some one.  "He fought for us!"
<P>
<P>
<P>
6
<P>
<P>
An hour later Benham returned in an extraordinarily dishevelled and
battered condition to his hotel.  He found his friend in anxious
consultation with the hotel proprietor.
<P>
"We were afraid that something had happened to you," said his
friend.
<P>
"I got a little involved," said Benham.
<P>
"Hasn't some one clawed your cheek?"
<P>
"Very probably," said Benham.
<P>
"And torn your coat?  And hit you rather heavily upon the neck?"
<P>
"It was a complicated misunderstanding," said Benham.  "Oh! pardon!
I'm rather badly bruised upon that arm you're holding."
<P>
<P>
<P>
7
<P>
<P>
Benham told the story to White as a jest against himself.
<P>
"I see now of course that they could not possibly understand my
point of view," he said. . . .
<P>
"I'm not sure if they quite followed my German. . . .
<P>
"It's odd, too, that I remember saying, �Let's burn these
mortgages,' and at the time I'm almost sure I didn't know the German
for mortgage. . . ."
<P>
It was not the only occasion on which other people had failed to
grasp the full intention behind Benham's proceedings.  His
aristocratic impulses were apt to run away with his conceptions of
brotherhood, and time after time it was only too manifest to White
that Benham's pallid flash of anger had astonished the subjects of
his disinterested observations extremely.  His explorations in Hayti
had been terminated abruptly by an affair with a native policeman
that had necessitated the intervention of the British Consul.  It
was begun with that suddenness that was too often characteristic of
Benham, by his hitting the policeman.  It was in the main street of
Cap Haytit of representative men.  I went about that Westphalian
country after that, with the conviction that headless, soulless,
blood-drinking metal monsters were breeding all about me.  I felt
that science was producing a poisonous swarm, a nest of black
dragons.  They were crouching here and away there in France and
England, they were crouching like beasts that bide their time, mewed
up in forts, kennelled in arsenals, hooded in tarpaulins as hawks
are hooded. . . .  And I had never thought very much about them
before, and there they were, waiting until some human fool like that
frock-coated thing of spite, and fools like him multiplied by a
million, saw fit to call them out to action.  Just out of hatred and
nationalism and faction. . . ."
<P>
Then came a queer fancy.
<P>
"Great guns, mines, battleships, all that cruelty-apparatus; I see
it more and more as the gathering revenge of dead joyless matter for
the happiness of life.  It is a conspiracy of the lifeless, an
enormous plot of the rebel metals against sensation.  That is why in
particular half-living people seem to love these things.  La
Ferriere was a fastness of the kind of tyranny that passes out of
human experience, the tyranny of the strong man over men.  Essen
comes, the new thing, the tyranny of the strong machine. . . .
<P>
"Science is either slave or master.  These people--I mean the German
people and militarist people generally--have no real mastery over
the scientific and economic forces on which they seem to ren, and the
policeman had just clubbed an unfortunate youth
over the head with the heavily loaded wooden club which is the
normal instrument of Haytien discipline.  His blow was a repartee,
part of a triangular altercation in which a large, voluble,
mahogany-coloured lady whose head was tied up in a blue handkerchief
played a conspicuous part, but it seemed to Benham an entirely
unjustifiable blow.
<P>
He allowed an indignation with negro policemen in general that had
been gathering from the very moment of his arrival at Port-au-Prince
to carry him away.  He advanced with the kind of shout one would
hurl at a dog, and smote the policeman to the earth with the stout
stick that the peculiar social atmosphere of Hayti had disposed him
to carry.  By the local standard his blow was probably a trivial
one, but the moral effect of his indignant pallor and a sort of
rearing tallness about him on these occasions was always very
considerable.  Unhappily these characteristics could have no effect
on a second negro policeman who was approaching the affray from
behind, and he felled Benham by a blow on the shoulder that was
meant for the head, and with the assistance of his colleague
overpowered him, while the youth and the woman vanished.
<P>
The two officials dragged Benham in a state of vehement protest to
the lock-up, and only there, in the light of a superior officer's
superior knowledge, did they begin to realize the grave fact of his
British citizenship.
<P>
The memory of the destruction of the Haytien fleet by a German
gunboat was still vivid in Port-au-Prince, and to that Benham owed
it that in spite of his blank refusal to compensate the man he had
knocked over, he was after two days of anger, two days of extreme
insanitary experience, and much meditation upon his unphilosophical
hastiness, released.
<P>
Quite a number of trivial incidents of a kindred sort diversified
his enquiries into Indian conditions.  They too turned for the most
part on his facile exasperation at any defiance of his deep-felt
desire for human brotherhood.  At last indeed came an affair that
refused ultimately to remain trivial, and tangled him up in a coil
that invoked newspaper articles and heated controversies.
<P>
The effect of India upon Benham's mind was a peculiar mixture of
attraction and irritation.  He was attracted by the Hindu spirit of
intellectualism and the Hindu repudiation of brutality, and he was
infuriated by the spirit of caste that cuts the great world of India
into a thousand futile little worlds, all aloof and hostile one to
the other.  "I came to see India," he wrote, "and there is no India.
There is a great number of Indias, and each goes about with its chin
in the air, quietly scorning everybody else."
<P>
His Indian adventures and his great public controversy on caste
began with a tremendous row with an Indian civil servant who had
turned an Indian gentleman out of his first-class compartment, and
culminated in a disgraceful fracas with a squatting brown holiness
at Benares, who had thrown aside his little brass bowlful of dinner
because Benham's shadow had fallen upon it.
<P>
"You unendurable snob!" said Benham, and then lapsing into the
forceful and inadvisable: "By Heaven, you SHALL eat it! . . ."
<P>
<P>
<P>
8
<P>
<P>
Benham's detestation of human divisions and hostilities was so deep
in his character as to seem almost instinctive.  But he had too a
very clear reason for his hostility to all these amazing breaks in
human continuity in his sense of the gathering dangers they now
involve.  They had always, he was convinced, meant conflict, hatred,
misery and the destruction of human dignity, but the new conditions
of life that have been brought about by modern science were making
them far more dangerous than they had ever been before.  He believed
that the evil and horror of war was becoming more and more
tremendous with every decade, and that the free play of national
prejudice and that stupid filching ambitiousness that seems to be
inseparable from monarchy, were bound to precipitate catastrophe,
unless a real international aristocracy could be brought into being
to prevent it.
<P>
In the drawer full of papers labelled "Politics," White found a
paper called "The Metal Beast."  It showed that for a time Benham
had been greatly obsessed by the thought of the armaments that were
in those days piling up in every country in Europe.  He had gone to
Essen, and at Essen he had met a German who had boasted of Zeppelins
and the great guns that were presently to smash the effete British
fleet and open the Imperial way to London.
<P>
"I could not sleep," he wrote, "on account of this man and his talk
and the streak of hatred in his talk.  He distressed me not because
he seemed exceptional, but because he seemed ordinary.  I realized
that he was more human than I was, and that only killing and killing
could come out of such humanity.  I thought of the great ugly guns I
had seen, and of the still greater guns he had talked about, and how
gloatingly he thought of the destruction they could do.  I felt as I
used to feel about that infernal stallion that had killed a man with
its teeth and feet, a despairing fear, a sense of monstrosity in
life.  And this creature who had so disturbed me was only a beastly
snuffy little man in an ill-fitting frock-coat, who laid his knife
and fork by their tips on the edge of his plate, and picked his
teeth with gusto and breathed into my face as he talked to me.  The
commoneside.  The
monster of steel and iron carries Kaiser and Germany and all Europe
captive.  It has persuaded them to mount upon its back and now they
must follow the logic of its path.  Whither? . . .  Only kingship
will ever master that beast of steel which has got loose into the
world.  Nothing but the sense of unconquerable kingship in us all
will ever dare withstand it. . . .  Men must be kingly aristocrats--
it isn't MAY be now, it is MUST be--or, these confederated metals,
these things of chemistry and metallurgy, these explosives and
mechanisms, will trample the blood and life out of our race into
mere red-streaked froth and filth. . . ."
<P>
Then he turned to the question of this metallic beast's release.
Would it ever be given blood?
<P>
"Men of my generation have been brought up in this threat of a great
war that never comes; for forty years we have had it, so that it is
with a note of incredulity that one tells oneself, "After all this
war may happen.  But can it happen?"
<P>
He proceeded to speculate upon the probability whether a great war
would ever devastate western Europe again, and it was very evident
to White that he wanted very much to persuade himself against that
idea.  It was too disagreeable for him to think it probable.  The
paper was dated 1910.  It was in October, 1914, that White, who was
still working upon the laborious uncertain account of Benham's life
and thought he has recently published, read what Benham had written.
Benham concluded that the common-sense of the world would hold up
this danger until reason could get "to the head of things."
<P>
"There are already mighty forces in Germany," Benham wrote, "that
will struggle very powerfully to avoid a war.  And these forces
increase.  Behind the coarseness and the threatenings, the melodrama
and the display of the vulgarer sort there arises a great and noble
people. . . .  I have talked with Germans of the better kind. . . .
You cannot have a whole nation of Christophes. . . .  There also the
true knighthood discovers itself. . . .  I do not believe this war
will overtake us."
<P>
"WELL!" said White.
<P>
"I must go back to Germany and understand Germany better," the notes
went on.
<P>
But other things were to hold Benham back from that resolve.  Other
things were to hold many men back from similar resolves until it was
too late for them. . . .
<P>
"It is preposterous that these monstrous dangers should lower over
Europe, because a certain threatening vanity has crept into the
blood of a people, because a few crude ideas go inadequately
controlled. . . .  Does no one see what that metallic beast will do
if they once let it loose?  It will trample cities; it will devour
nations. . . ."
<P>
White read this on the 9th of October, 1914.  One crumpled evening
paper at his feet proclaimed in startled headlines: "Rain of
Incendiary Shells.  Antwerp Ablaze."  Another declared untruthfully
but impressively: "Six Zeppelins drop Bombs over the Doomed City."
<P>
He had bought all the evening papers, and had read and re-read them
and turned up maps and worried over strategic problems for which he
had no data at all--as every one did at that time--before he was
able to go on with Benham's manuscripts.
<P>
These pacific reassurances seemed to White's war-troubled mind like
finding a flattened and faded flower, a girl's love token, between
the pages of some torn and scorched and blood-stained book picked
out from a heap of loot after rapine and murder had had their
fill. . . .
<P>
"How can we ever begin over again?" said White, and sat for a long
time staring gloomily into the fire, forgetting forgetting,
forgetting too that men who are tired and weary die, and that new
men are born to succeed them. . . .
<P>
"We have to begin over again," said White at last, and took up
Benham's papers where he had laid them down. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>
9
<P>
<P>
One considerable section of Benham's treatment of the Fourth
Limitation was devoted to what he called the Prejudices of Social
Position.  This section alone was manifestly expanding into a large
treatise upon the psychology of economic organization. . . .
<P>
It was only very slowly that he had come to realize the important
part played by economic and class hostilities in the disordering of
human affairs.  This was a very natural result of his peculiar
social circumstances.  Most people born to wealth and ease take the
established industrial system as the natural method in human
affairs; it is only very reluctantly and by real feats of sympathy
and disinterestedness that they can be brought to realize that it is
natural only in the sense that it has grown up and come about, and
necessary only because nobody is strong and clever enough to
rearrange it.  Their experience of it is a satisfactory experience.
On the other hand, the better off one is, the wider is one's outlook
and the more alert one is to see the risks and dangers of
international dissensions.  Travel and talk to foreigners open one's
eyes to aggressive possibilities; history and its warnings become
conceivable.  It is in the nature of things that socialists and
labour parties should minimize international obligations and
necessities, and equally so that autocracies and aristocracies and
plutocracies should be negligent of and impatient about social
reform.
<P>
But Benham did come to realize this broader conflict between worker
and director, between poor man and possessor, between resentful
humanity and enterprise, between unwilling toil and unearned
opportunity.  It is a far profounder and subtler conflict than any
other in human affairs.  "I can foresee a time," he wrote, "when the
greater national and racial hatreds may all be so weakened as to be
no longer a considerable source of human limitation and misery, when
the suspicions of complexion and language and social habit are
allayed, and when the element of hatred and aggression may be clean
washed out of most religious cults, but I do not begin to imagine a
time, because I cannot imagine a method, when there will not be
great friction between those who employ, those who direct collective
action, and those whose part it is to be the rank and file in
industrialism.  This, I know, is a limitation upon my confidence due
very largely to the restricted nature of my knowledge of this sort
of organization.  Very probably resentment and suspicion in the mass
and self-seeking and dishonesty in the fortunate few are not so
deeply seated, so necessary as they seem to be, and if men can be
cheerfully obedient and modestly directive in war time, there is no
reason why ultimately they should not be so in the business of
peace.  But I do not understand the elements of the methods by which
this state of affairs can be brought about.

"If I were to confess this much to an intelligent working man I know
that at once he would answer �Socialism,' but Socialism is no more a
solution of this problem than eating is a solution when one is lost
in the wilderness and hungry.  Of course everybody with any
intelligence wants Socialism, everybody, that is to say, wants to
see all human efforts directed to the common good and a common end,
but brought face to face with practical problems Socialism betrays a
vast insufficiency of practical suggestions.  I do not say that
Socialism would not work, but I do say that so far Socialists have
failed to convince me that they could work it.  The substitution of
a stupid official for a greedy proprietor may mean a vanished
dividend, a limited output and no other human advantage whatever.
Socialism is in itself a mere eloquent gesture, inspiring,
encouraging, perhaps, but beyond that not very helpful, towards the
vast problem of moral and material adjustment before the race.  That
problem is incurably miscellaneous and intricate, and only by great
multitudes of generous workers, one working at this point and one at
that, secretly devoted knights of humanity, hidden and dispersed
kings, unaware of one another, doubting each his right to count
himself among those who do these kingly services, is this elaborate
rightening of work and guidance to be done."
<P>
So from these most fundamental social difficulties he came back to
his panacea.  All paths and all enquiries led him back to his
conception of aristocracy, conscious, self-disciplined, devoted,
self-examining yet secret, making no personal nor class pretences,
as the supreme need not only of the individual but the world.

It was the Labour trouble in the Transvaal which had brought the two
schoolfellows together again.  White had been on his way to
Zimbabwe.  An emotional disturbance of unusual intensity had driven
him to seek consolations in strange scenery and mysterious
desolations.  It was as if Zimbabwe called to him.  Benham had come
to South Africa to see into the question of Indian immigration, and
he was now on his way to meet Amanda in London.  Neither man had
given much heed to the gathering social conflict on the Rand until
the storm burst about them.  There had been a few paragraphs in the
papers about a dispute upon a point of labour etiquette, a question
of the recognition of Trade Union officials, a thing that impressed
them both as technical, and then suddenly a long incubated quarrel
flared out in rioting and violence, the burning of houses and
furniture, attacks on mines, attempts to dynamite trains.  White
stayed in Johannesburg because he did not want to be stranded up
country by the railway strike that was among the possibilities of
the situation.  Benham stayed because he was going to London very
reluctantly, and he was glad of this justification for a few days'
delay.  The two men found themselves occupying adjacent tables in
the Sherborough Hotel, and White was the first to recognize the
other.  They came together with a warmth and readiness of intimacy
that neither would have displayed in London.
<P>
White had not seen Benham since the social days of Amanda at
Lancaster Gate, and he was astonished at the change a few years had
made in him.  The peculiar contrast of his pallor and his dark hair
had become more marked, his skin was deader, his features seemed
more prominent and his expression intenser.  His eyes were very
bright and more sunken under his brows.  He had suffered from yellow
fever in the West Indies, and these it seemed were the marks left by
that illness.  And he was much more detached from the people about
him; less attentive to the small incidents of life, more occupied
with inner things.  He greeted White with a confidence that White
was one day to remember as pathetic.
<P>
"It is good to meet an old friend," Benham said.  "I have lost
friends.  And I do not make fresh ones.  I go about too much by
myself, and I do not follow the same tracks that other people are
following. . . ."
<P>
What track was he following?  It was now that White first heard of
the Research Magnificent.  He wanted to know what Benham was doing,
and Benham after some partial and unsatisfactory explanation of his
interest in insurgent Hindoos, embarked upon larger expositions.
"It is, of course, a part of something else," he amplified.  He was
writing a book, "an enormous sort of book."  He laughed with a touch
of shyness.  It was about "everything," about how to live and how
not to live.  And "aristocracy, and all sorts of things."  White was
always curious about other people's books.  Benham became earnest
and more explicit under encouragement, and to talk about his book
was soon to talk about himself.  In various ways, intentionally and
inadvertently, he told White much.  These chance encounters, these
intimacies of the train and hotel, will lead men at times to a stark
frankness of statement they would never permit themselves with
habitual friends.
<P>
About the Johannesburg labour trouble they talked very little,
considering how insistent it was becoming.  But the wide
propositions of the Research Magnificent, with its large
indifference to immediate occurrences, its vast patience, its
tremendous expectations, contrasted very sharply in White's memory
with the bitterness, narrowness and resentment of the events about
them.  For him the thought of that first discussion of this vast
inchoate book into which Benham's life was flowering, and which he
was ultimately to summarize, trailed with it a fringe of vivid
little pictures; pictures of crowds of men hurrying on bicycles and
afoot under a lowering twilight sky towards murmuring centres of
disorder, of startling flares seen suddenly afar off, of the muffled
galloping of troops through the broad dusty street in the night, of
groups of men standing and watching down straight broad roads, roads
that ended in groups of chimneys and squat buildings of corrugated
iron.  And once there was a marching body of white men in the
foreground and a complicated wire fence, and a clustering mass of
Kaffirs watching them over this fence and talking eagerly amongst
themselves.
<P>
"All this affair here is little more than a hitch in the machinery,"
said Benham, and went back to his large preoccupation. . . .
<P>
But White, who had not seen so much human disorder as Benham, felt
that it was more than that.  Always he kept the tail of his eye upon
that eventful background while Benham talked to him.
<P>
When the firearms went off he may for the moment have even given the
background the greater share of his attention. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>
11
<P>
<P>
It was only as White burrowed through his legacy of documents that
the full values came to very many things that Benham said during
these last conversations.  The papers fitted in with his memories of
their long talks like text with commentary; so much of Benham's talk
had repeated the private writings in which he had first digested his
ideas that it was presently almost impossible to disentangle what
had been said and understood at Johannesburg from the fuller
statement of those patched and corrected manuscripts.  The two
things merged in White's mind as he read.  The written text took
upon itself a resonance of Benham's voice; it eked out the hints and
broken sentences of his remembered conversation.
<P>
But some things that Benham did not talk about at all, left by their
mere marked absence an impression on White's mind.  And occasionally
after Benham had been talking for a long time there would be an
occasional aphasia, such as is often apparent in the speech of men
who restrain themselves from betraying a preoccupation.  He would
say nothing about Amanda or about women in general, he was reluctant
to speak of Prothero, and another peculiarity was that he referred
perhaps half a dozen times or more to the idea that he was a "prig."
He seemed to be defending himself against some inner accusation,
some unconquerable doubt of the entire adventure of his life.  These
half hints and hints by omission exercised the quick intuitions of
White's mind very keenly, and he drew far closer to an understanding
of Benham's reserves than Benham ever suspected. . . .
<P>
At first after his parting from Amanda in London Benham had felt
completely justified in his treatment of her.  She had betrayed him
and he had behaved, he felt, with dignity and self-control.  He had
no doubt that he had punished her very effectively, and it was only
after he had been travelling in China with Prothero for some time
and in the light of one or two chance phrases in her letters that he
began to have doubts whether he ought to have punished her at all.
And one night at Shanghai he had a dream in which she stood before
him, dishevelled and tearful, his Amanda, very intensely his Amanda,
and said that she was dirty and shameful and spoilt for ever,
because he had gone away from her.  Afterwards the dream became
absurd: she showed him the black leopard's fur as though it was a
rug, and it was now moth-eaten and mangey, the leopard skin that had
been so bright and wonderful such a little time ago, and he awoke
before he could answer her, and for a long time he was full of
unspoken answers explaining that in view of her deliberate
unfaithfulness the position she took up was absurd.  She had spoilt
her own fur.  But what was more penetrating and distressing in this
dream was not so much the case Amanda stated as the atmosphere of
unconquerable intimacy between them, as though they still belonged
to each other, soul to soul, as though nothing that had happened
afterwards could have destroyed their common responsibility and the
common interest of their first unstinted union.  She was hurt, and
of course he was hurt.  He began to see that his marriage to Amanda
was still infinitely more than a technical bond.
<P>
And having perceived that much he presently began to doubt whether
she realized anything of the sort.  Her letters fluctuated very much
in tone, but at times they were as detached and guarded as a
schoolgirl writing to a cousin.  Then it seemed to Benham an
extraordinary fraud on her part that she should presume to come into
his dream with an entirely deceptive closeness and confidence.  She
began to sound him in these latter letters upon the possibility of
divorce.  This, which he had been quite disposed to concede in
London, now struck him as an outrageous suggestion.  He wrote to ask
her why, and she responded exasperatingly that she thought it was
"better."  But, again, why better?  It is remarkable that although
his mind had habituated itself to the idea that Easton was her lover
in London, her thought of being divorced, no doubt to marry again,
filled him with jealous rage.  She asked him to take the blame in
the divorce proceedings.  There, again, he found himself ungenerous.
He did not want to do that.  Why should he do that?  As a matter of
fact he was by no means reconciled to the price he had paid for his
Research Magnificent; he regretted his Amanda acutely.  He was
regretting her with a regret that grew when by all the rules of life
it ought to be diminishing.
<P>
It was in consequence of that regret and his controversies with
Prothero while they travelled together in China that his concern
about what he called priggishness arose.  It is a concern that one
may suppose has a little afflicted every reasonably self-conscious
man who has turned from the natural passionate personal life to
religion or to public service or any abstract devotion.  These
things that are at least more extensive than the interests of flesh
and blood have a trick of becoming unsubstantial, they shine
gloriously and inspiringly upon the imagination, they capture one
and isolate one and then they vanish out of sight.  It is far easier
to be entirely faithful to friend or lover than it is to be faithful
to a cause or to one's country or to a religion.  In the glow of
one's first service that larger idea may be as closely spontaneous
as a handclasp, but in the darkness that comes as the glow dies away
there is a fearful sense of unreality.  It was in such dark moments
that Benham was most persecuted by his memories of Amanda and most
distressed by this suspicion that the Research Magnificent was a
priggishness, a pretentious logomachy.  Prothero could indeed hint
as much so skilfully that at times the dream of nobility seemed an
insult to the sunshine, to the careless laughter of children, to the
good light in wine and all the warm happiness of existence.  And
then Amanda would peep out of the dusk and whisper, "Of course if
you could leave me--!  Was I not LIFE?  Even now if you cared to
come back to me--  For I loved you best and loved you still, old
Cheetah, long after you had left me to follow your dreams. . . .
Even now I am drifting further into lies and the last shreds of
dignity drop from me; a dirty, lost, and shameful leopard I am now,
who was once clean and bright. . . .  You could come back, Cheetah,
and you could save me yet.  If you would love me. . . ."
<P>
In certain moods she could wring his heart by such imagined
speeches, the very quality of her voice was in them, a softness that
his ear had loved, and not only could she distress him, but when
Benham was in this heartache mood, when once she had set him going,
then his little mother also would rise against him, touchingly
indignant, with her blue eyes bright with tears; and his frowsty
father would back towards him and sit down complaining that he was
neglected, and even little Mrs. Skelmersdale would reappear, bravely
tearful on her chair looking after him as he slunk away from her
through Kensington Gardens; indeed every personal link he had ever
had to life could in certain moods pull him back through the door of
self-reproach Amanda opened and set him aching and accusing himself
of harshness and self-concentration.  The very kittens of his
childhood revived forgotten moments of long-repented hardness.  For
a year before Prothero was killed there were these heartaches.  That
tragedy gave them their crowning justification.  All these people
said in this form or that, "You owed a debt to us, you evaded it,
you betrayed us, you owed us life out of yourself, love and
services, and you have gone off from us all with this life that was
ours, to live by yourself in dreams about the rule of the world, and
with empty phantoms of power and destiny.  All this was
intellectualization.  You sacrificed us to the thin things of the
mind.  There is no rule of the world at all, or none that a man like
you may lay hold upon.  The rule of the world is a fortuitous result
of incalculably multitudinous forces.  But all of us you could have
made happier.  You could have spared us distresses.  Prothero died
because of you.  Presently it will be the turn of your father, your
mother--Amanda perhaps. . . ."
<P>
He made no written note of his heartaches, but he made several
memoranda about priggishness that White read and came near to
understanding.  In spite of the tugging at his heart-strings, Benham
was making up his mind to be a prig.  He weighed the cold
uningratiating virtues of priggishness against his smouldering
passion for Amanda, and against his obstinate sympathy for
Prothero's grossness and his mother's personal pride, and he made
his choice.  But it was a reluctant choice.
<P>
One fragment began in the air.  "Of course I had made myself
responsible for her life.  But it was, you see, such a confoundedly
energetic life, as vigorous and as slippery as an eel. . . .  Only
by giving all my strength to her could I have held Amanda. . . .  So
what was the good of trying to hold Amanda? . . .
<P>
"All one's people have this sort of claim upon one.  Claims made by
their pride and their self-respect, and their weaknesses and
dependences.  You've no right to hurt them, to kick about and demand
freedom when it means snapping and tearing the silly suffering
tendrils they have wrapped about you.  The true aristocrat I think
will have enough grasp, enough steadiness, to be kind and right to
every human being and still do the work that ought to be his
essential life.  I see that now.  It's one of the things this last
year or so of loneliness has made me realize; that in so far as I
have set out to live the aristocratic life I have failed.  Instead
I've discovered it--and found myself out.  I'm an overstrung man.  I
go harshly and continuously for one idea.  I live as I ride.  I
blunder through my fences, I take off too soon.  I've no natural
ease of mind or conduct or body.  I am straining to keep hold of a
thing too big for me and do a thing beyond my ability.  Only after
Prothero's death was it possible for me to realize the prig I have
always been, first as regards him and then as regards Amanda and my
mother and every one.  A necessary unavoidable priggishness. . . ."I
do not see how certain things can be done without prigs, people,
that is to say, so concentrated and specialized in interest as to be
a trifle inhuman, so resolved as to be rather rhetorical and
forced. . . .  All things must begin with clumsiness, there is
no assurance about pioneers. . . .
<P>
"Some one has to talk about aristocracy, some one has to explain
aristocracy. . . .  But the very essence of aristocracy, as I
conceive it, is that it does not explain nor talk about itself. . . .
<P>
"After all it doesn't matter what I am. . . .  It's just a private
vexation that I haven't got where I meant to get.  That does not
affect the truth I have to tell. . . .
<P>
"If one has to speak the truth with the voice of a prig, still one
must speak the truth.  I have worked out some very considerable
things in my research, and the time has come when I must set them
out clearly and plainly.  That is my job anyhow.  My journey to
London to release Amanda will be just the end of my adolescence and
the beginning of my real life.  It will release me from my last
entanglement with the fellow creatures I have always failed to make
happy. . . .  It's a detail in the work. . . .  And I shall go on.
<P>
But I shall feel very like a man who goes back for a surgical
operation.
<P>
"It's very like that.  A surgical operation, and when it is over
perhaps I shall think no more about it.
<P>
"And beyond these things there are great masses of work to be done.
So far I have but cleared up for myself a project and outline of
living.  I must begin upon these masses now, I must do what I can
upon the details, and, presently, I shall see more clearly where
other men are working to the same ends. . . ."

Benham's expedition to China with Prothero was essentially a wrestle
between his high resolve to work out his conception of the noble
life to the utmost limit and his curiously invincible affection and
sympathy for the earthliness of that inglorious little don.
Although Benham insisted upon the dominance of life by noble
imaginations and relentless reasonableness, he would never
altogether abandon the materialism of life.  Prothero had once said
to him, "You are the advocate of the brain and I of the belly.
Only, only we respect each other."  And at another time, "You fear
emotions and distrust sensations.  I invite them.  You do not drink
gin because you think it would make you weep.  But if I could not
weep in any other way I would drink gin."  And it was under the
influence of Prothero that Benham turned from the haughty
intellectualism, the systematized superiorities and refinements, the
caste marks and defensive dignities of India to China, that great
teeming stinking tank of humorous yellow humanity.
<P>
Benham had gone to Prothero again after a bout of elevated idealism.
It was only very slowly that he reconciled his mind to the idea of
an entirely solitary pursuit of his aristocratic dream.  For some
time as he went about the world he was trying to bring himself into
relationship with the advanced thinkers, the liberal-minded people
who seemed to promise at least a mental and moral co-operation.  Yet
it is difficult to see what co-operation was possible unless it was
some sort of agreement that presently they should all shout
together.  And it was after a certain pursuit of Rabindranath
Tagore, whom he met in Hampstead, that a horror of perfect manners
and perfect finish came upon him, and he fled from that starry calm
to the rich uncleanness of the most undignified fellow of Trinity.
And as an advocate and exponent of the richness of the lower levels
of life, as the declared antagonist of caste and of the uttermost
refinements of pride, Prothero went with Benham by way of Siberia to
the Chinese scene.
<P>
Their controversy was perceptible at every dinner-table in their
choice of food and drink.  Benham was always wary and Prothero
always appreciative.  It peeped out in the distribution of their
time, in the direction of their glances.  Whenever women walked
about, Prothero gave way to a sort of ethnological excitement.
"That girl--a wonderful racial type."  But in Moscow he was
sentimental.  He insisted on going again to the Cosmopolis Bazaar,
and when he had ascertained that Anna Alexievna had vanished and
left no trace he prowled the streets until the small hours.
<P>
In the eastward train he talked intermittently of her.  "I should
have defied Cambridge," he said.
<P>
But at every stopping station he got out upon the platform
ethnologically alert. . . .
<P>
Theoretically Benham was disgusted with Prothero.  Really he was not
disgusted at all.  There was something about Prothero like a
sparrow, like a starling, like a Scotch terrier. . . .  These, too,
are morally objectionable creatures that do not disgust. . . .
<P>
Prothero discoursed much upon the essential goodness of Russians.
He said they were a people of genius, that they showed it in their
faults and failures just as much as in their virtues and
achievements.  He extolled the "germinating disorder" of Moscow far
above the "implacable discipline" of Berlin.  Only a people of
inferior imagination, a base materialist people, could so maintain
its attention upon precision and cleanliness.  Benham was roused to
defence against this paradox.  "But all exaltation neglects," said
Prothero.  "No religion has ever boasted that its saints were spick
and span."  This controversy raged between them in the streets of
Irkutsk.  It was still burning while they picked their way through
the indescribable filth of Pekin.
<P>
"You say that all this is a fine disdain for material things," said
Benham.  "But look out there!"
<P>
Apt to their argument a couple of sturdy young women came shuffling
along, cleaving the crowd in the narrow street by virtue of a single
word and two brace of pails of human ordure.
<P>
"That is not a fine disdain for material things," said Benham.
"That is merely individualism and unsystematic living."
<P>
"A mere phase of frankness.  Only frankness is left to them now.
The Manchus crippled them, spoilt their roads and broke their
waterways.  European intervention paralyses every attempt they make
to establish order on their own lines.  In the Ming days China did
not reek. . . .  And, anyhow, Benham, it's better than the silly
waste of London. . . ."
<P>
And in a little while Prothero discovered that China had tried
Benham and found him wanting, centuries and dynasties ago.
<P>
What was this new-fangled aristocratic man, he asked, but the ideal
of Confucius, the superior person, "the son of the King"?  There you
had the very essence of Benham, the idea of self -examination, self-
preparation under a vague Theocracy.  ("Vaguer," said Benham, "for
the Confucian Heaven could punish and reward.")  Even the elaborate
sham modesty of the two dreams was the same.  Benham interrupted and
protested with heat.  And this Confucian idea of the son of the
King, Prothero insisted, had been the cause of China's paralysis.
"My idea of nobility is not traditional but expectant," said Benham.
"After all, Confucianism has held together a great pacific state far
longer than any other polity has ever lasted.  I'll accept your
Confucianism.  I've not the slightest objection to finding China
nearer salvation than any other land.  Do but turn it round so that
it looks to the future and not to the past, and it will be the best
social and political culture in the world.  That, indeed, is what is
happening.  Mix Chinese culture with American enterprise and you
will have made a new lead for mankind."
<P>
From that Benham drove on to discoveries.  "When a man thinks of the
past he concentrates on self; when he thinks of the future he
radiates from self.  Call me a neo-Confucian; with the cone opening
forward away from me, instead of focussing on me. . . ."
<P>
"You make me think of an extinguisher," said Prothero.
<P>
"You know I am thinking of a focus," said Benham.  "But all your
thought now has become caricature. . . .  You have stopped thinking.
You are fighting after making up your mind. . . ."
<P>
Prothero was a little disconcerted by Benham's prompt endorsement of
his Chinese identification.  He had hoped it would be exasperating.
He tried to barb his offence.  He amplified the indictment.  All
cultures must be judged by their reaction and fatigue products, and
Confucianism had produced formalism, priggishness, humbug. . . .  No
doubt its ideals had had their successes; they had unified China,
stamped the idea of universal peace and good manners upon the
greatest mass of population in the world, paved the way for much
beautiful art and literature and living.  "But in the end, all your
stern orderliness, Benham," said Prothero, "only leads to me.  The
human spirit rebels against this everlasting armour on the soul.
After Han came T'ang.  Have you never read Ling Po?  There's scraps
of him in English in that little book you have--what is it?--the
LUTE OF JADE?  He was the inevitable Epicurean; the Omar Khayyam
after the Prophet.  Life must relax at last. . . ."
<P>
"No!" cried Benham.  "If it is traditional, I admit, yes; but if it
is creative, no. . . ."
<P>
Under the stimulation of their undying controversy Benham was driven
to closer enquiries into Chinese thought.  He tried particularly to
get to mental grips with English-speaking Chinese.  "We still know
nothing of China," said Prothero.  "Most of the stuff we have been
told about this country is mere middle-class tourists' twaddle.  We
send merchants from Brixton and missionaries from Glasgow, and what
doesn't remind them of these delectable standards seems either funny
to them or wicked.  I admit the thing is slightly pot-bound, so to
speak, in the ancient characters and the ancient traditions, but for
all that, they KNOW, they HAVE, what all the rest of the world has
still to find and get.  When they begin to speak and write in a
modern way and handle modern things and break into the soil they
have scarcely touched, the rest of the world will find just how much
it is behind. . . .  Oh! not soldiering; the Chinese are not such
fools as that, but LIFE. . . ."
<P>
Benham was won to a half belief in these assertions.
<P>
He came to realize more and more clearly that while India dreams or
wrestles weakly in its sleep, while Europe is still hopelessly and
foolishly given over to militant monarchies, racial vanities,
delirious religious feuds and an altogether imbecile fumbling with
loaded guns, China, even more than America, develops steadily into a
massive possibility of ordered and aristocratic liberalism. . . .
<P>
The two men followed their associated and disconnected paths.
Through Benham's chance speeches and notes, White caught glimpses,
as one might catch glimpses through a moving trellis, of that
bilateral adventure.  He saw Benham in conversation with liberal-
minded mandarins, grave-faced, bald-browed persons with disciplined
movements, who sat with their hands thrust into their sleeves
talking excellent English; while Prothero pursued enquiries of an
intenser, more recondite sort with gentlemen of a more confidential
type.  And, presently, Prothero began to discover and discuss the
merits of opium.
<P>
For if one is to disavow all pride and priggishness, if one is to
find the solution of life's problem in the rational enjoyment of
one's sensations, why should one not use opium?  It is art
materialized.  It gives tremendous experiences with a minimum of
exertion, and if presently its gifts diminish one need but increase
the quantity.  Moreover, it quickens the garrulous mind, and
steadies the happiness of love.  Across the varied adventures of
Benham's journey in China fell the shadow first of a suspicion and
then of a certainty. . . .
<P>
The perfected and ancient vices of China wrapped about Prothero like
some tainted but scented robe, and all too late Benham sought to
drag him away.  And then in a passion of disgust turned from him.
<P>
"To this," cried Benham, "one comes!  Save for pride and
fierceness!"
<P>
"Better this than cruelty," said Prothero talking quickly and
clearly because of the evil thing in his veins.  "You think that you
are the only explorer of life, Benham, but while you toil up the
mountains I board the house-boat and float down the stream.  For you
the stars, for me the music and the lanterns.  You are the son of a
mountaineering don, and I am a Chinese philosopher of the riper
school.  You force yourself beyond fear of pain, and I force myself
beyond fear of consequences.  What are we either of us but children
groping under the black cloak of our Maker?--who will not blind us
with his light.  Did he not give us also these lusts, the keen knife
and the sweetness, these sensations that are like pineapple smeared
with saltpetre, like salted olives from heaven, like being flayed
with delight. . . .  And did he not give us dreams fantastic beyond
any lust whatever?  What is the good of talking?  Speak to your own
kind.  I have gone, Benham.  I am lost already.  There is no
resisting any more, since I have drugged away resistance.  Why then
should I come back?  I know now the symphonies of the exalted
nerves; I can judge; and I say better lie and hear them to the end
than come back again to my old life, to my little tin-whistle solo,
my--effort!  My EFFORT! . . .  I ruin my body.  I know.  But what of
that? . . .  I shall soon be thin and filthy.  What of the grape-
skin when one has had the pulp?"
<P>
"But," said Benham, "the cleanness of life!"
<P>
"While I perish," said Prothero still more wickedly, "I say good
things. . . ."
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
White had a vision of a great city with narrow crowded streets, hung
with lank banners and gay with vertical vermilion labels, and of a
pleasant large low house that stood in a garden on a hillside, a
garden set with artificial stones and with beasts and men and
lanterns of white porcelain, a garden which overlooked this city.
Here it was that Benham stayed and talked with his host, a man robed
in marvellous silks and subtle of speech even in the European
languages he used, and meanwhile Prothero, it seemed, had gone down
into the wickedness of the town below.  It was a very great town
indeed, spreading for miles along the banks of a huge river, a river
that divided itself indolently into three shining branches so as to
make islands of the central portion of the place.  And on this river
swarmed for ever a vast flotilla of ships and boats, boats in which
people lived, boats in which they sought pleasure, moored places of
assembly, high-pooped junks, steamboats, passenger sampans, cargo
craft, such a water town in streets and lanes, endless miles of it,
as no other part of the world save China can display.  In the
daylight it was gay with countless sunlit colours embroidered upon a
fabric of yellow and brown, at night it glittered with a hundred
thousand lights that swayed and quivered and were reflected
quiveringly upon the black flowing waters.
<P>
And while Benham sat and talked in the garden above came a messenger
who was for some reason very vividly realized by White's
imagination.  He was a tall man with lack-lustre eyes and sunken
cheeks that made his cheek bones very prominent, and gave his thin-
lipped mouth something of the geniality of a skull, and the arm he
thrust out of his yellow robe to hand Prothero's message to Benham
was lean as a pole.  So he stood out in White's imagination, against
the warm afternoon sky and the brown roofs and blue haze of the
great town below, and was with one exception the distinctest thing
in the story.  The message he bore was scribbled by Prothero himself
in a nerveless scrawl: "Send a hundred dollars by this man.  I am in
a frightful fix."
<P>
Now Benham's host had been twitting him with the European patronage
of opium, and something in this message stirred his facile
indignation.  Twice before he had had similar demands.  And on the
whole they had seemed to him to be unreasonable demands.  He was
astonished that while he was sitting and talking of the great world-
republic of the future and the secret self-directed aristocracy that
would make it possible, his own friend, his chosen companion, should
thus, by this inglorious request and this ungainly messenger,
disavow him.  He felt a wave of intense irritation.
<P>
"No," he said, "I will not."
<P>
And he was too angry to express himself in any language
understandable by his messenger.
<P>
His host intervened and explained after a few questions that the
occasion was serious.  Prothero, it seemed, had been gambling.
<P>
"No," said Benham.  "He is shameless.  Let him do what he can."
<P>
The messenger was still reluctant to go.
<P>
And scarcely had he gone before misgivings seized Benham.
<P>
"Where IS your friend?" asked the mandarin.
<P>
"I don't know," said Benham.
<P>
"But they will keep him!  They may do all sorts of things when they
find he is lying to them."
<P>
"Lying to them?"
<P>
"About your help."
<P>
"Stop that man," cried Benham suddenly realizing his mistake.  But
when the servants went to stop the messenger their intentions were
misunderstood, and the man dashed through the open gate of the
f pulling down and trying
again.  Hope and disappointments and much need for philosophy. . . .
I see myself now for the little workman I am upon this tremendous
undertaking.  And all my life hereafter goes to serve it. . . ."
<P>
He turned his sombre eyes upon his friend.  He spoke with a grim
enthusiasm.  "I'm a prig.  I'm a fanatic, White.  But I have
something clear, something better worth going on with than any
adventure of personal relationship could possibly be. . . ."
<P>
And suddenly he began to tell White as plainly as he could of the
faith that had grown up in his mind.  He spoke with a touch of
defiance, with the tense force of a man who shrinks but overcomes
his shame.  "I will tell you what I believe."
<P>
He told of his early dread of fear and baseness, and of the slow
development, expansion and complication of his idea of self-respect
until he saw that tgarden and made off down the winding road.
<P>
"Stop him!" cried Benham, and started in pursuit, suddenly afraid
for Prothero.
<P>
The Chinese are a people of great curiosity, and a small pebble
sometimes starts an avalanche. . . .
<P>
White pieced together his conception of the circles of disturbance
that spread out from Benham's pursuit of Prothero's flying
messenger.
<P>
For weeks and months the great town had been uneasy in all its ways
because of the insurgent spirits from the south and the disorder
from the north, because of endless rumours and incessant intrigue.
The stupid manoeuvres of one European "power" against another, the
tactlessness of missionaries, the growing Chinese disposition to
meet violence and force with violence and force, had fermented and
brewed the possibility of an outbreak.  The sudden resolve of Benham
to get at once to Prothero was like the firing of a mine.  This
tall, pale-faced, incomprehensible stranger charging through the
narrow streets that led to the pleasure-boats in the south river
seemed to many a blue-clad citizen like the White Peril embodied.
Behind him came the attendants of the rich man up the hill; but they
surely were traitors to help this stranger.
<P>
Before Benham could at all realize what was happening he found his
way to the river-boat on which he supposed Prothero to be detained,
barred by a vigorous street fight.  Explanations were impossible; he
joined in the fight.
<P>
For three days that fight developed round the mystery of Prothero's
disappearance.
<P>
It was a complicated struggle into which the local foreign traders
on the river-front and a detachment of modern drilled troops from
the up-river barracks were presently drawn.  It was a struggle that
was never clearly explained, and at the end of it they found
Prothero's body flung out upon a waste place near a little temple on
the river bank, stabbed while he was asleep. . . .
<P>
And from the broken fragments of description that Benham let fall,
White had an impression of him hunting for all those three days
through the strange places of a Chinese city, along narrow passages,
over queer Venetian-like bridges, through the vast spaces of empty
warehouses, in the incense-scented darkness of temple yards, along
planks that passed to the dark hulls of secret barges, in quick-
flying boats that slipped noiselessly among the larger craft, and
sometimes he hunted alone, sometimes in company, sometimes black
figures struggled in the darkness against dim-lit backgrounds and
sometimes a swarm of shining yellow faces screamed and shouted
through the torn paper windows. . . .  And then at the end of this
confused effect of struggle, this Chinese kinematograph film, one
last picture jerked into place and stopped and stood still, a white
wall in the sunshine come upon suddenly round a corner, a dirty
flagged passage and a stiff crumpled body that had for the first
time an inexpressive face. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
Benham sat at a table in the smoking-room of the Sherborough Hotel
at Johannesburg and told of these things.  White watched him from an
armchair.  And as he listened he noted again the intensification of
Benham's face, the darkness under his brows, the pallor of his skin,
the touch of red in his eyes.  For there was still that red gleam in
Benham's eyes; it shone when he looked out of a darkness into a
light.  And he sat forward with his arms folded under him, or moved
his long lean hand about over the things on the table.
<P>
"You see," he said, "this is a sort of horror in my mind.  Things
like this stick in my mind.  I am always seeing Prothero now, and it
will take years to get this scar off my memory again.  Once before--
about a horse, I had the same kind of distress.  And it makes me
tender, sore-minded about everything.  It will go, of course, in the
long run, and it's just like any other ache that lays hold of one.
One can't cure it.  One has to get along with it. . . .
<P>
"I know, White, I ought to have sent that money, but how was I to
know then that it was so imperative to send that money? . . .
<P>
"At the time it seemed just pandering to his vices. . . .
<P>
"I was angry.  I shall never subdue that kind of hastiness
altogether.  It takes me by surprise.  Before the messenger was out
of sight I had repented. . . .
<P>
"I failed him.  I have gone about in the world dreaming of
tremendous things and failing most people.  My wife too. . . ."
<P>
He stopped talking for a little time and folded his arms tight and
stared hard in front of himself, his lips compressed.
<P>
"You see, White," he said, with a kind of setting of the teeth,
"this is the sort of thing one has to stand.  Life is imperfect.
Nothing can be done perfectly.  And on the whole--"  He spoke still
more slowly, "I would go through again with the very same things
that have hurt my people.  If I had to live over again.  I would try
to do the things without hurting the people, but I would do the
things anyhow.  Because I'm raw with remorse, it does not follow
that on the whole I am not doing right.  Right doing isn't balm.  If
I could have contrived not to hurt these people as I have done, it
would have been better, just as it would be better to win a battle
without any killed or wounded.  I was clumsy with them and they
suffered, I suffer for their suffering, but still I have to stick to
the way I have taken.  One's blunders are accidents.  If one thing
is clearer than another it is that the world isn't accident-proof. . . .
<P>
But I wish I had sent those dollars to Prothero. . . .  God!  White,
but I lie awake at night thinking of that messenger as he turned
away. . . .  Trying to stop him. . . .
<P>
"I didn't send those dollars.  So fifty or sixty people were killed
and many wounded. . . .  There for all practical purposes the thing
ends.  Perhaps it will serve to give me a little charity for some
other fool's haste and blundering. . . .
<P>
"I couldn't help it, White.  I couldn't help it. . . .
<P>
"The main thing, the impersonal thing, goes on.  One thinks, one
learns, one adds one's contribution of experience and understanding.
The spirit of the race goes on to light and comprehension.  In spite
of accidents.  In spite of individual blundering.
<P>
"It would be absurd anyhow to suppose that nobility is so easy as to
come slick and true on every occasion. . . .
<P>
"If one gives oneself to any long aim one must reckon with minor
disasters.  This Research I undertook grows and grows.  I believe in
it more and more.  The more it asks from me the more I give to it.
When I was a youngster I thought the thing I wanted was just round
the corner.  I fancied I would find out the noble life in a year or
two, just what it was, just where it took one, and for the rest of
my life I would live it.  Finely.  But I am just one of a multitude
of men, each one going a little wrong, each one achieving a little
right.  And the noble life is a long, long way ahead. . . .  We are
working out a new way of lihere is no honour nor pride for a man until he
refers his life to ends and purposes beyond himself.  An aht rise instantly
out of all
this squalor and evil temper. . . .  What does all this struggle
here amount to?  On one side unintelligent greed, unintelligent
resentment on the other; suspicion everywhere. . . .
<P>
"And you know, White, at bottom THEY ALL WANT TO BE DECENT!
<P>
"If only they had light enough in their brains to show them
how."It's such a plain job they have here too, a new city, the
simplest industries, freedom from war, everything to make a good
life for men, prosperity, glorious sunshine, a kind of happiness in
the air.  And mismanagement, fear, indulgence, jealousy, prejudice,
stupidity, poison it all.  A squabble about working on a Saturday
afternoon, a squabble embittered by this universal shadow of miner's
phthving for mankind, a new rule, a new
conscience.  It's no small job for all of us.  There must be
lifetimes of building up and lifetimes oristocrat
must be loyal.  So it has ever been, but a modern aristocrat must
also be lucid; there it is that one has at once the demand for
kingship and the repudiation of all existing states and kings.  In
this manner he had come to his idea of a great world republic that
must replace the little warring kingdoms of the present, to the
conception of an unseen kingship ruling the whole globe, to his King
Invisible, who is the Lord of Truth and all sane loyalty.  "There,"
he said, "is the link of our order, the new knighthood, the new
aristocracy, that must at last rule the earth.  There is our Prince.
He is in me, he is in you; he is latent in all mankind.  I have
worked this out and tried it and lived it, and I know that outwardly
and inwardly this is the way a man must live, or else be a poor
thing and a base one.  On great occasions and small occasions I have
failed myself a thousand times, but no failure lasts if your faith
lasts.  What I have learnt, what I have thought out and made sure, I
want now to tell the world.  Somehow I will tell it, as a book I
suppose, though I do not know if I shall ever be able to make a
book.  But I have away there in London or with me here all the
masses of notes I have made in my search for the life that is worth
while living. . . .  We who are self-appointed aristocrats, who are
not ashamed of kingship, must speak to one another. . . .
<P>
"We can have no organization because organizations corrupt. . . .
<P>
"No recognition. . . .
<P>
"But we can speak plainly. . . ."
<P>
(As he talked his voice was for a space drowned by the jingle and
voices of mounted police riding past the hotel.)
<P>
"But on one side your aristocracy means revolution," said White.
"It becomes a political conspiracy."
<P>
"Manifestly.  An open conspiracy.  It denies the king upon the
stamps and the flag upon the wall.  It is the continual proclamation
of the Republic of Mankind."
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
The earlier phases of violence in the Rand outbreak in 1913 were
manifest rather in the outskirts of Johannesburg than at the centre.
"Pulling out" was going on first at this mine and then that, there
were riots in Benoni, attacks on strike breakers and the smashing up
of a number of houses.  It was not until July the 4th that, with the
suppression of a public meeting in the market-place, Johannesburg
itself became the storm centre.
<P>
Benham and White were present at this marketplace affair, a confused
crowded occasion, in which a little leaven of active men stirred
throisis that the masters were too incapable and too mean to
prevent.
<P>
"Oh, God!" cried Benham, "when will men be princes and take hugh a large
uncertain multitude of decently dressed onlookers.
The whole big square was astir, a swaying crowd of men.  A
ramshackle platform improvised upon a trolley struggled through the
swarming straw hats to a street corner, and there was some speaking.
At first it seemed as though military men were using this platform,
and then it was manifestly in possession of an excited knot of
labour leaders with red rosettes.  The military men had said their
say and got down.  They came close by Benham, pushing their way
across the square.  "We've warned them," said one.  A red flag, like
some misunderstood remark at a tea-party, was fitfully visible and
incomprehensible behind the platform.  Somebody was either pitched
or fell off the platform.  One could hear nothing from the speakers
except a minute bleating. . . .
<P>
Then there were shouts that the police were charging.  A number of
mounted men trotted into the square.  The crowd began a series of
short rushes that opened lanes for the passage of the mounted police
as they rode to and fro.  These men trotted through the crowd,
scattering knots of people.  They carried pick-handles, but they did
not seem to be hitting with them.  It became clear that they aimed
at the capture of the trolley.  There was only a feeble struggle for
the trolley; it was captured and hauled through the scattered
spectators in the square to the protection of a small impassive body
of regular cavalry at the opposite corner.  Then quite a number of
people seemed to be getting excited and fighting.  They appeared to
be vaguely fighting the foot-police, and the police seemed to be
vaguely pushing through them and dispersing them.  The roof of a
little one-story shop became prominent as a centre of vigorous
stone-throwing.
<P>
It was no sort of battle.  Merely the normal inconsecutiveness of
human affairs had become exaggerated and pugnacious.  A meeting was
being prevented, and the police engaged in the operation were being
pelted or obstructed.  Mostly people were just looking on.
<P>
"It amounts to nothing," said Benham.  "Even if they held a meeting,
what could happen?  Why does the Government try to stop it?"
<P>
The drifting and charging and a little booing went on for some time.
Every now and then some one clambered to a point of vantage, began a
speech and was pulled down by policemen.  And at last across the
confusion came an idea, like a wind across a pond.
<P>
The strikers were to go to the Power Station.
<P>
That had the effect of a distinct move in the game.  The Power
Station was the centre of Johannesburg's light and energy.  There if
anywhere it would be possible to express one's disapproval of the
administration, one's desire to embarrass and confute it.  One could
stop all sorts of things from the Power Station.  At any rate it was
a repartee to the suppression of the meeting.  erything will be
soon--when one comes to death then everything is at one's
fingertips--I can feel that greater wback of a number of Everybody seemed
gladdened by a definite project.
<P>
Benham and White went with the crowd.
<P>
At the intersection of two streets they were held up for a time; the
scattered drift of people became congested.  Gliding slowly across
the mass came an electric tram, an entirely unbattered tram with
even its glass undamaged, and then another and another.  Strikers,
with the happy expression of men who have found something expressive
to do, were escorting the trams off the street.  They were being
meticulously careful with them.  Never was there less mob violence
in a riot.  They walked by the captured cars almost deferentially,
like rough men honoured by a real lady's company.  And when White
and Benham reached the Power House the marvel grew.  The rioters
were already in possession and going freely over the whole place,
and they had injured nothing.  They had stopped the engines, but
they had not even disabled them.  Here too manifestly a majority of
the people were, like White and Benham, merely lookers-on.
<P>
"But this is the most civilized rioting," said Benham.  "It isn't
rioting; it's drifting.  Just as things drifted in Moscow.  Because
nobody has the rudder. . . .
<P>
"What maddens me," he said, "is the democracy of the whole thing.
White!  I HATE this modern democracy.  Democracy and inequality!
Was there ever an absurder combination?  What is the good of a
social order in which the men at the top are commoner, meaner stuff
than the men underneath, the same stuff, just spoilt, spoilt by
prosperity and opportunity and the conceit that comes with
advantage?  This trouble wants so little, just a touch of
aristocracy, just a little cultivated magnanimity, just an inkling
of responsibility, and the place migold of
life?  When will the kingship in us wake up and come to its own? . . .
Look at this place!  Look at this place! . . .  The easy,
accessible happiness!  The manifest prosperity.  The newness and the
sunshine.  And the silly bitterness, the rage, the mischief and
miseries! . . ."
<P>
And then: "It's not our quarrel. . . ."
<P>
"It's amazing how every human quarrel draws one in to take sides.
Life is one long struggle against the incidental.  I can feel my
anger gathering against the Government here in spite of my reason.
I want to go and expostulate.  I have a ridiculous idea that I ought
to go off to Lord Glindividuals into
the roadway and then a derisive shouting.  Nobody had been hit.  The
soldiers had fired in the air.
<P>
"But thiadstone or Botha and expostulate. . . .  What
good would it do?  They move in the magic circles of their own
limitations, an official, a politician--how would they put it?--
�with many things to consider. . . .'
<P>
"It's my weakness to be drawn into quarrels.  It's a thing I have to
guard against. . . .
<P>
"What does it all amount to?  It is like a fight between navvies in
a tunnel to settle the position of the Pole star.  It doesn't
concern us. . . .  Oh! it doesn't indeed concern us.  It's a scuffle
in the darkness, and our business, the business of all brains, the
only permanent good work is to light up the world. . . .  There will
be mischief and hatred here and suppression and then forgetfulness,
and then things will go on again, a little better or a little
worse. . . ."
<P>
"I'm tired of this place, White, and of all such places.  I'm tired
of the shouting and running, the beating and shooting.  I'm sick of
all the confusions of life's experience, which tells only of one
need amidst an endless multitude of distresses.  I've seen my fill
of wars and disputes and struggles.  I see now how a man may grow
weary at last of life and its disorders, its unreal exacting
disorders, its blunders and its remorse.  No!  I want to begin upon
the realities I have made for myself.  For they are the realities.
I want to go now to some quiet corner where I can polish what I have
learnt, sort out my accumulations, be undisturbed by these
transitory symptomatic things. . . .
<P>
"What was that boy saying?  They are burning the STAR office. . . .
Well, let them. . . ."
<P>
And as if to emphasize his detachment, his aversion, from the things
that hurried through the night about them, from the red flare in the
sky and the distant shouts and revolver shots and scuffling flights
down side streets, he began to talk again of aristocracy and the
making of greatness and a new great spirit in men.  All the rest of
his life, he said, must be given to that.  He would say his thing
plainly and honestly and afterwards other men would say it clearly
and beautifully; here it would touch a man and there it would touch
a man; the Invisible King in us all would find himself and know
himself a little in this and a little in that, and at last a day
would come, when fair things and fine things would rule the world
and such squalor as this about them would beng red and strange to his
face with both hands; above them his eyes were round and anxious.
Blood came out betwing.  He shouted out something
about "Foolery!"
<P>
Haroun al Raschid was flinging aside all this sublime indifference
to current things. . . .
<P>
But the carbines spoke again.
<P>
Benham seemed to run unexpectedly against something invisible.  He
spun right round and fell down into a sitting position.  He sat
looking surprised.
<P>
After one moment of blank funk White drew out his pocket
handkerchief, held it arm high by way of a white flag, and ran out
from the piazza of the hotel.
<P>
<P>
<P>
17
<P>
<P>
"Are you hit?" cried White dropping to his knees and making himself
as compact as possible.  "Benham!"
<P>
Benham, after a moment of perplexed thought answered in a strange
voice, a whisper into which a whistling note had been mixed.
<P>
"It was stupid of me to come out here.  Not my quarrel.  Faults on
both sides.  And now I can't ge as impossible any more
for men as a Stone Age Corroboree. . . .
<P>
Late or soon?
<P>
Benham sought for some loose large measure of time.
<P>
"Before those constellations above us have changed their shapes. . . .
<P>
"Does it matter if we work at something that will take a hundred
years or ten thousand years?  It will never come in our lives,
White.  Not soon enough for that.  But after that evorld I shall never see as
one
feels the dawn coming through the last darkness. . . ."
<P>
<P>
<P>
16
<P>
<P>
The attack on the Rand Club began while Benham and White were at
lunch in the dining-room at the Sherborough on the day following the
burning of the STAR office.  The Sherborough dining-room was on the
first floor, and the Venetian window beside their table opened on to
a verandah above a piazza.  As they talked they became aware of an
excitement in the street below, shouting and running and then a
sound of wheels and the tramp of a body of soldiers marching
quickly.  White stood up and looked.  "They're seizing the stuff in
the gunshops," he said, sitting down again.  "It's amazing they
haven't done it before."
<P>
They went on eating and discussing the work of a medical mission at
Mukden that had won Benham's admiration. . . .
<P>
A revolver cracked in the street and there was a sound of glass
smashing.  Then more revolver shots.  "That's at the big club at the
corner, I think," said Benham and went out upon the verandah.
<P>
Up and down the street mischief was afoot.  Outside the Rand Club in
the cross street a considerable mass of people had accumulated, and
was being hustled by a handful of khaki-clad soldiers.  Down the
street people were looking in the direction of the market-place and
then suddenly a rush of figures flooded round the corner, first a
froth of scattered individuals and then a mass, a column, marching
with an appearance of order and waving a flag.  It was a poorly
disciplined body, it fringed out into a swarm of sympathizers and
spectators upon the side walk, and at the head of it two men
disputed.  They seemed to be differing about the direction of the
whole crowd.  Suddenly one smote the other with his fist, a blow
that hurled him sideways, and then turned with a triumphant gesture
to the following ranks, waving his arms in the air.  He was a tall
lean man, hatless and collarless, greyhaired and wild-eyed.  On he
came, gesticulating gauntly, past the hotel.
<P>
And then up the street something happened.  Benham's attention was
turned round to it by a checking, by a kind of catch in the breath,
on the part of the advancing procession under the verandah.
<P>
The roadway beyond the club had suddenly become clear.  Across it a
dozen soldiers had appeared and dismounted methodically and lined
out, with their carbines in readiness.  The mounted men at the club
corner had vanished, and the people there had swayed about towards
this new threat.  Quite abruptly the miscellaneous noises of the
crowd ceased.  Understanding seized upon every one.
<P>
These soldiers were going to fire. . . .
<P>
The brown uniformed figures moved like automata; the rifle shots
rang out almost in one report. . . .
<P>
There was a rush in the crowd towards doorways and side streets, an
enquiring pause, the darting s is a stupid game," said Benham.  "Why did they
fire at
all?"
<P>
The tall man who had led the mob had run out into the middle of the
road.  His commando was a little disposed to assume a marginal
position, and it had to be reassured.  He was near enough for Benham
to see his face.  For a time it looked anxious and thoughtful.  Then
he seemed to jump to his decision.  He unbuttoned and opened his
coat wide as if defying the soldiers.  "Shoot," he bawled, "Shoot,
if you dare!"
<P>
A little uniform movement of the soldiers answered him.  The small
figure of the officer away there was inaudible.  The coat of the man
below flapped like the wings of a crowing cock before a breast of
dirty shirt, the hoarse voice cracked with excitement, "Shoot, if
you dare.  Shoot, if you dare!  See!"
<P>
Came the metallic bang of the carbines again, and in the instant the
leader collapsed in the road, a sprawl of clothes, hit by half a
dozen bullets.  It was an extraordinary effect.  As though the
figure had been deflated.  It was incredible that a moment before
this thing had been a man, an individual, a hesitating complicated
purpose.
<P>
"Good God!" cried Benham, "but--this is horrible!"
<P>
The heap of garments lay still.  The red hand that stretched out
towards the soldiers never twitched.
<P>
The spectacular silence broke into a confusion of sounds, women
shrieked, men cursed, some fled, some sought a corner from which
they might still see, others pressed forward.  "Go for the swine!"
bawled a voice, a third volley rattled over the heads of the people,
and in the road below a man with a rifle halted, took aim, and
answered the soldiers' fire.  "Look out!" cried White who was
watching the soldiers, and ducked.  "This isn't in the air!"
<P>
Came a straggling volley again, like a man running a metal hammer
very rapidly along iron corrugations, and this time people were
dropping all over the road.  One white-faced man not a score of
yards away fell with a curse and a sob, struggled up, staggered for
some yards with blood running abundantly from his neck, and fell and
never stirred again.  Another went down upon his back clumsily in
the roadway and lay wringing his hands faster and faster until
suddenly with a movement like a sigh they dropped inert by his side.
A straw-hatted youth in a flannel suit ran and stopped and ran
again.  He seemed to be holding somethieen his fingers.  He went right past
the hotel
and stumbled and suddenly sprawled headlong at the opposite corner.
The majority of the crowd had already vanished into doorways and
side streets.  But there was still shouting and there was still a
remnant of amazed and angry men in the roadway--and one or two angry
women.  They were not fighting.  Indeed they were unarmed, but if
they had had weapons now they would certainly have used them.
<P>
"But this is preposterous!" cried Benham.  "Preposterous.  Those
soldiers are never going to shoot again! This must stop."
<P>
He stood hesitating for a moment and then turned about and dashed
for the staircase.  "Good Heaven!" cried White.  "What are you going
to do?"
<P>
Benham was going to stop that conflict very much as a man might go
to stop a clock that is striking unwarrantably and amazingly.  He
was going to stop it because it annoyed his sense of human dignity.
<P>
White hesitated for a moment and then followed, crying "Benham!"
<P>
But there was no arresting this last outbreak of Benham's all too
impatient kingship.  He pushed aside a ducking German waiter who was
peeping through the glass doors, and rushed out of the hotel.  With
a gesture of authority he ran forward into the middle of the street,
holding up his hand, in which he still held his dinner napkin
clenched like a bomb.  White believes firmly that Benham thought he
would be able to dominate everytt up.  I will sit here a moment and
pull myself together.  Perhaps I'm--I must be shot.  But it seemed
to come--inside me. . . .  If I should be hurt.  Am I hurt? . . .
Will you see to that book of mine, White?  It's odd.  A kind of
fainthness. . . .  What?"
<P>
"I will see after your book," said White and glanced at his hand
because it felt wet, and was astonished to discover it bright red.
He forgot about himself then, and the fresh flight of bullets down
the street.
<P>
The immediate effect of this blood was that he said something more
about the book, a promise, a definite promise.  He could never
recall his exact words, but their intention was binding.  He
conveyed his absolute acquiescence with Benham's wishes whatever
they were.  His life for that moment was unreservedly at his
friend's disposal. . . .
<P>
White never knew if his promise was heard.  Benham had stopped
speaking quite abruptly with that "What?"
<P>
He stared in front of him with a doubtful expression, like a man who
is going to be sick, and then, in an instant, every muscle seemed to
give way, he shuddered, his head flopped, and White held a dead man
in his arms.
