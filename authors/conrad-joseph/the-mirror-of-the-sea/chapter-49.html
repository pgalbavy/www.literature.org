<p> This the navy of the Twenty Years’ War knew well how to do,
and never better than when Lord Nelson had breathed into its soul
his own passion of honour and fame.  It was a fortunate navy. 
Its victories were no mere smashing of helpless ships and massacres
of cowed men.  It was spared that cruel favour, for which no brave
heart had ever prayed.  It was fortunate in its adversaries. 
I say adversaries, for on recalling such proud memories we should
avoid the word "enemies," whose hostile sound perpetuates the
antagonisms and strife of nations, so irremediable perhaps, so
fateful—and also so vain.  War is one of the gifts of life; but,
alas! no war appears so very necessary when time has laid its
soothing hand upon the passionate misunderstandings and the passionate
desires of great peoples.  "Le temps," as a distinguished Frenchman
has said, "est un galant homme."  He fosters the spirit of concord
and justice, in whose work there is as much glory to be reaped
as in the deeds of arms.</p>

<p>One of them disorganized by revolutionary changes, the other
rusted in the neglect of a decayed monarchy, the two fleets opposed
to us entered the contest with odds against them from the first. 
By the merit of our daring and our faithfulness, and the genius
of a great leader, we have in the course of the war augmented
our advantage and kept it to the last. But in the exulting illusion
of irresistible might a long series of military successes brings
to a nation the less obvious aspect of such a fortune may perchance
be lost to view.  The old navy in its last days earned a fame
that no belittling malevolence dare cavil at.  And this supreme
favour they owe to their adversaries alone.</p>

<p>Deprived by an ill-starred fortune of that self-confidence which
strengthens the hands of an armed host, impaired in skill but
not in courage, it may safely be said that our adversaries managed
yet to make a better fight of it in 1797 than they did in 1793. 
Later still, the resistance offered at the Nile was all, and more
than all, that could be demanded from seamen, who, unless blind
or without understanding, must have seen their doom sealed from
the moment that the <em>Goliath</em>, bearing up under the bows
of the <em>Guerrier</em>, took up an inshore berth.  The combined
fleets of 1805, just come out of port, and attended by nothing
but the disturbing memories of reverses, presented to our approach
a determined front, on which Captain Blackwood, in a knightly
spirit, congratulated his Admiral.  By the exertions of their
valour our adversaries have but added a greater lustre to our
arms.  No friend could have done more, for even in war, which
severs for a time all the sentiments of human fellowship, this
subtle bond of association remains between brave men—that the
final testimony to the value of victory must be received at the
hands of the vanquished.</p>

<p>Those who from the heat of that battle sank together to their
repose in the cool depths of the ocean would not understand the
watchwords of our day, would gaze with amazed eyes at the engines
of our strife.  All passes, all changes: the animosity of peoples,
the handling of fleets, the forms of ships; and even the sea itself
seems to wear a different and diminished aspect from the sea of
Lord Nelson’s day.  In this ceaseless rush of shadows and shades,
that, like the fantastic forms of clouds cast darkly upon the
waters on a windy day, fly past us to fall headlong below the
hard edge of an implacable horizon, we must turn to the national
spirit, which, superior in its force and continuity to good and
evil fortune, can alone give us the feeling of an enduring existence
and of an invincible power against the fates.</p>

<p>Like a subtle and mysterious elixir poured into the perishable
clay of successive generations, it grows in truth, splendour,
and potency with the march of ages.  In its incorruptible flow
all round the globe of the earth it preserves from the decay and
forgetfulness of death the greatness of our great men, and amongst
them the passionate and gentle greatness of Nelson, the nature
of whose genius was, on the faith of a brave seaman and distinguished
Admiral, such as to "Exalt the glory of our nation."</p>
