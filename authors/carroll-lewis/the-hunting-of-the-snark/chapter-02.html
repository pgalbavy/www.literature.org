               The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies--<br />
               Such a carriage, such ease and such grace!<br />
               Such solemnity, too! One could see he was wise,<br />
               The moment one looked in his face!
          <P>
               He had bought a large map representing the sea,<br />
               Without the least vestige of land:<br />
               And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be<br />
               A map they could all understand.
          <P>
               "What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators,<br />
               Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?"<br />
               So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply<br />
               "They are merely conventional signs!
          <P>
               "Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes!<br />
               But we've got our brave Captain to thank:<br />
               (So the crew would protest) "that he's bought us the best--<br />
               A perfect and absolute blank!"
          <P>
               This was charming, no doubt; but they shortly found out<br />
               That the Captain they trusted so well<br />
               Had only one notion for crossing the ocean,<br />
               And that was to tingle his bell.
          <P>
               He was thoughtful and grave--but the orders he gave<br />
               Were enough to bewilder a crew.<br />
               When he cried "Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!"<br />
               What on earth was the helmsman to do?
          <P id="bowsprit">
               Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:</A><br />
               A thing, as the Bellman remarked,<br />
               That frequently happens in tropical climes,<br />
               When a vessel is, so to speak, "snarked."
          <P>
               But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,<br />
               And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,<br />
               Said he had hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,<br />
               That the ship would not travel due West!
          <P>
               But the danger was past--they had landed at last,<br />
               With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:<br />
               Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view,<br />
               Which consisted to chasms and crags.
          <P>
               The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low,<br />
               And repeated in musical tone<br />
               Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe--<br />
               But the crew would do nothing but groan.
          <P>
               He served out some grog with a liberal hand,<br />
               And bade them sit down on the beach:<br />
               And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,<br />
               As he stood and delivered his speech.
          <P>
               "Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!"<br />
               (They were all of them fond of quotations:<br />
               So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers,<br />
               While he served out additional rations).
          <P>
               "We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,<br />
               (Four weeks to the month you may mark),<br />
               But never as yet ('tis your Captain who speaks)<br />
               Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark!
          <P>
               "We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,<br />
               (Seven days to the week I allow),<br />
               But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze,<br />
               We have never beheld till now!
          <P>
               "Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again<br />
               The five unmistakable marks<br />
               By which you may know, wheresoever you go,<br />
               The warranted genuine Snarks.
          <P>
               "Let us take them in order. The first is the taste,<br />
               Which is meager and hollow, but crisp:<br />
               Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,<br />
               With a flavor of Will-o-the-wisp.
          <P>
               "Its habit of getting up late you'll agree<br />
               That it carries too far, when I say<br />
               That it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea,<br />
               And dines on the following day.
          <P>
               "The third is its slowness in taking a jest.<br />
               Should you happen to venture on one,<br />
               It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed:<br />
               And it always looks grave at a pun.
          <P>
               "The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,<br />
               Which is constantly carries about,<br />
               And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes--<br />
               A sentiment open to doubt.
          <P>
               "The fifth is ambition. It next will be right<br />
               To describe each particular batch:<br />
               Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,<br />
               And those that have whiskers, and scratch.
          <P>
               "For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,<br />
               Yet, I feel it my duty to say,<br />
               Some are Boojums--" The Bellman broke off in alarm,<br />
               For the Baker had fainted away.
