<p>Just here we must turn aside for a minute or two, in order to
understand the situation.</p>

<p>On the third of July, Colonel Zebulon Butler, of the Continental
army, had marched forth at the head of his two hundred and odd
boys, old men, and a few able-bodied soldiers to meet his cousin,
the British Colonel Butler, with his horde of soldiers, Tories,
and Iroquois Indians.</p>

<p>"We come out to fight, not only for liberty," said the patriot
leader, as the battle was about to open, "but for our lives and
that which is dearer than our lives&mdash;to preserve our homes from
conflagration, and our wives and children from the tomahawk."</p>

<p>For a time all went well, and Colonel Zebulon Butler began to
hope that the marauders would be driven off, but his force was
unsteady, and some of them gave way when they saw their enemies
as they swarmed out of the woods and assailed them.</p>

<p>The trembling mothers who were prayerfully listening to the sounds
of battle on the plain above, heard the regular platoon firing
which showed that all was going well; but, by and by, the increasing
yells, the dropping shots, the blaze of musketry from the swamp
on the left of the fighting settlers, where the Iroquois were
rushing forth, the panic-stricken fugitives coming into sight
here and there, white, panting and wild, told the dreadful truth.
The patriots had been overwhelmed by the invaders, who were driving
everything before them. But a single hope remained&mdash;flight.</p>

<p>Some might succeed in reaching the mountains on the other side
the river, and possibly a few would be able to force their way
through the dismal wilderness known as the "Shades of Death,"
and reach Stroudsburg and the sparse settlements on the upper
Delaware, many miles away.</p>

<p>The moment the patriots began flying before the Tories and Indians,
the panic spread to all.</p>

<p>It is a historical fact that in the flight the pursuers shot
many of the patriot officers and soldiers in the thigh, so as
to disable them from running, and left them on the ground to be
finally disposed of afterwards, while the Iroquois hastened after
the other fugitives.</p>

<p>Many of these were tomahawked in their flight; others fled down
the river banks in the direction of Wilkesbarre, on the opposite
side of the river; others made for the mountains back of the battle-ground;
still others hastened to the protection of the Forty Fort, while
a great many found a temporary refuge in the undergrowth of Monocacy
Island, in the Susquehanna. Still others got across the river
and plunged into the mountainous wilderness and began their toilsome
tramp through the section I have named, and which is still known
as the "Shades of Death."</p>

<p>It was at this hour that Fred Godfrey galloped directly into
the massacre in his desperate resolve to do all he could to save
his friends.</p>

<p>He had turned off from the main highway, and was making toward
a point whence came the sounds of sharp firing, and such shouts
as to show that some unusual conflict was going on. He caught
glimpses of figures moving among the trees, but he paid no heed
to them, and pressed steadily forward over a half-broken path
until he was stopped in the most startling manner that can be
imagined&mdash;that is, by a rifle-shot.</p>

<p>Some one fired from the front, and undoubtedly would have struck
the youthful rider, had not his horse at the very instant snuffed
the danger and flung up his head. The action saved the life of
the rider at the expense of the steed, who received the cruel
bullet and lunged forward and fell to the ground with such suddenness
that but for the dexterity of Fred Godfrey he would have been
crushed.</p>

<p>As it was, the youth saved himself by a hair's breadth, leaping
clear of the saddle and brute just in the nick of time.</p>

<p>The thin wreath of smoke was curling upward from the undergrowth,
and the horse was in the act of falling, when a Seneca Indian,
in his war paint and agleam with ferocity, bounded from the cover,
and with his smoking gun in his hand and the other grasping the
handle of his tomahawk, dashed towards the patriot, whom he evidently
believed was badly wounded.</p>

<p>"S'render! s'render!" he shrieked, coming down upon him as if
fired from a cannon.</p>

<p>"I'm not in that business just now," snapped out Fred Godfrey,
leveling and firing his pistol, with the muzzle almost in the
face of the fierce warrior.</p>

<p>The aim could not have been more accurate. The subsequent incidents
of the Wyoming massacre were of no interest to that Seneca warrior,
for the sharp crack of the little weapon was scarcely more sudden
than was the ending of his career.</p>
