<p>The street in which the lecture hall stood began to wear the air of being
a centre of interest some time before the doors of the building were
opened. People who had not been able to obtain reserved seats wished to
arrive early. The lectures which had begun by being popular had ended by
being fashionable. At the outset an audience of sober, religious
tendencies had attended them, but after the first one had been delivered
other elements had presented themselves. There had been a sprinkling of
serious scientific men, a prominent politician or so, some society women
whose faces and toilettes were well-known and lavishly described in the
newspapers. On this last night the audience was largely of the
fashionable political world. Carriages drove up one after another and
deposited well-dressed persons who might have been expected that night to
appear at certain brilliant social functions, and who had come to hear
"Repentance" instead.

<p>"He has always had good audiences," said a member of the Committee of
Arrangement, "but he has never had one like this--in Washington at least.
There is the Secretary of State with his wife and daughter. I believe the
President is to be here. He has awakened an enormous interest. The house
will be literally crammed. They are filling the aisle with seats
already."
</p><p>Baird was in the small retiring-room which had been arranged for his
convenience. His journey had somewhat fatigued him, and he was in the
physical and mental condition to feel glad that this lecture was to be
the last of the series. He was going back to Willowfield, though he was
not to remain there. He had received a call from an important church in
New York and had accepted it. He was endeavouring to make arrangements
that Latimer could be near him. On his return this evening he had found a
letter he had been expecting. It referred to Latimer, and he was anxious
to talk it over with him. He wished he would come in, and felt a little
restless over his delay, though he knew they would have time to say but
few words to each other before it was time for the lecture to begin. He
walked up and down the room looking down at the green carpet and
thinking, his thoughts wandering vaguely to the little pursuant of the
herd claim and the letters he had wanted to deliver. He smiled faintly,
remembering the small frame in the over-large clothes and the bucolic
countenance with its over-sharpness of expression.
</p><p>The member of the committee looked into the room.
</p><p>"They are beginning to turn people away from the doors," he said. "Half
the Cabinet is here--I never saw such an audience."
</p><p>As he went away smiling, someone passed him in entering the room. Baird,
who was smiling also, changed his expression of courteous appreciation to
a smile of greeting, for the man who had entered was Latimer.
</p><p>He advanced, holding out his hand.
</p><p>"I am glad you have come," he began to say. "I wanted at least a word
with you before I went on."
</p><p>Then his smile died out, leaving blank amazement which a breath's space
later was alarmed questioning. He recalled later how for a second he
stood and stared. Latimer's face was white and damp with sweat. Its lines
were drawn and sunken deep. His eyes were fixed on the man before him
with something which had a ghastly resemblance to an unsteady smile which
was not a smile at all. He looked as if illness--or death--or madness had
struck him. He did not seem a sane man, and yet a stillness so deadly was
expressed by his whole being that it seemed to fill the small, neat,
business-like green-room.
</p><p>Baird strode towards him and seized him by the shoulder.
</p><p>"What is it? What is it? What is it?" he cried out.
</p><p>Latimer's face did not alter in a line. He fumbled stiffly in his
breast-pocket and held out some pieces of yellowed letter-paper--this
being done stiffly, too. He spoke in a hoarse whisper. It seemed to
search every corner of the room and echo there.
</p><p>"See!" he said. "These are two letters. A man wrote them to a poor,
half-mad child twenty years ago."
</p><p>The door opened, and the member of the committee looked in again, radiant
with exultation.
</p><p>"The audience waiting in such breathless silence that you might hear a
pin drop. Two thousand of them, if there's one. Ten minutes to eight."
</p><p>"Thank you," answered Baird.
</p><p>The door closed again and he stood looking at Latimer's rigid hand and
the papers.
</p><p>"They were written to Margery," went on Latimer. "Stamps found them in a
chink in the logs. She had hidden them there that she might take them out
and sob over and kiss them. I used to hear her in the middle of the
night."
</p><p>Baird snatched them from his hand. He fell into a chair near the table
and dropped his face upon the yellowed fragments, pressing them against
his lips with awful sobbing sounds, as if he would wrest from them the
kisses the long-dead girl had left there.
</p><p>"I, too!" he cried. "I, too! Oh! my God! Margery!"
</p><p>"Don't say 'God!'" said Latimer. "When she was dying, in an agony of
fear, she said it. Not that word! Another!"
</p><p>He said no other--and Latimer drew nearer to him.
</p><p>"You wrote them," he said. "They are written in your hand--in your
words--I should know them anywhere. You may deny it. I could prove
nothing. I do not want to prove anything. Deny it if you will."
</p><p>Baird rose unsteadily. The papers were clutched in his hand. His face was
marred by the unnaturalness of a man's tears.
</p><p>"Do you think I shall deny it?" he answered. "It is true. I have sat and
listened to your talk of her and thought I should go quite mad. You have
told me of her tortures, and I have listened. I did not know--surely she
did not know herself--of the child--when I went away. It is no use saying
to you--how should it be?--that I loved her--that I was frenzied by my
love of her innocent sweetness!"
</p><p>"No, there is no use," answered Latimer, in a voice actually void of
emotion, "but I daresay it is true."
</p><p>"There is no use in calling myself by any of the names invented for the
men who bring about such tragedies. They are true of some men perhaps,
but they were not true of me. I don't know what was true of me. Something
worse than has ever been put into words perhaps, for I loved her and I
have loved her for twenty years. I would have given up my career--my
life, anything she had asked!"
</p><p>"But when she found you had acted a lie to her----"
</p><p>"It seemed to fill her with the frantic terror of a child. I dare not
approach her. I think she thought she would be struck dead by Heaven.
Great God! how I understood your story of her prayers. And it was I--it
was I!"
</p><p>He turned on Latimer with a kind of ferocity.
</p><p>"You have crucified me!" he cried out. "Let that comfort you. You have
crucified me by her side, that I might see her die--that I might hear her
low little piteous voice--that I might see her throes and terrors. And I
love her--and remember every look of her loving child's eyes--every curve
and quiver of her mouth. Through all the years I have been crucified,
knowing I had earned all that I felt."
</p><p>Latimer moved across the room, putting the table between them. He went
and stood by the mantel. A murmur of impatient applause from the audience
came through the door.
</p><p>"You loved her," he said, standing with his hand holding something in his
breast. "And I loved you. She was the one brightness of my life when I
was a boy and you were its one brightness when I was a man. You gave me a
reason for living. I am not the kind of man to be my own reason. I
needn't tell you what you have been to me. You were the one man on earth
I dared to confess to. I knew you would understand and that you knew what
pity was."
</p><p>Baird groaned aloud. He wiped the sweat from his forehead with his
handkerchief as he listened.
</p><p>"I knew you were the one man I could trust. I could <u>trust</u> you. I could
confide in you, and talk to you about Margery. One day you said to me
that you had learned to love her and that we might have been brothers."
</p><p>"When I was left free I had but one thought," Baird said, "to return to
her--to atone, so far as atonement could be--to pray of her upon my
knees. But she was dead--she was dead!"
</p><p>"Yes, she was dead, and I had no one left to talk to about her. You were
my one comfort and support and friend."
</p><p>He drew his hand out of his breast. Baird started and then stood quite
quiet. The hand held a pistol.
</p><p>"Are you going to kill me?" he said. "You know I asked you that once
before."
</p><p>"No," said Latimer, "I am not going to kill you. I am going to kill the
man who loved you, and found you his reason for living. It's all done
with!"
</p><p>"No! no!" shrieked Baird, and he hurled himself across the table like a
madman. "No! You are not! No, Latimer! No! God! No!"
</p><p>They were struggling together--Baird hung to his arm and tried to drag
the pistol from his grasp. But it was no use; Latimer's long, ill-hung
limbs were the stronger. His fixed face did not change, but he wrenched
himself free and flung Baird across the room. He set the pistol against
his heart and pulled the trigger. He gave something like a leap and fell
down.
</p><p>The door opened for the returning member of the committee and the
impatient applause of the audience came through it almost a roar.
</p><p>Baird was struggling to rise as if his fall had stunned him. Latimer was
stretched at full length, quite dead.
