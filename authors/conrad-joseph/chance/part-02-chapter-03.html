<p>Young Powell thought to himself: "The men, too, are noticing
it."  Indeed, the captain's behaviour to his wife and to his wife's
father was noticeable enough.  It was as if they had been a pair
of not very congenial passengers.  But perhaps it was not always
like that.  The captain might have been put out by something.</p>

<p>When the aggrieved Franklin came on deck Mr. Powell made a remark
to that effect.  For his curiosity was aroused.</p>

<p>The mate grumbled "Seems to you? . . . Putout?  . . . eh?"  He
buttoned his thick jacket up to the throat, and only then added
a gloomy "Aye, likely enough," which discouraged further conversation. 
But no encouragement would have induced the newly-joined second
mate to enter the way of confidences.  His was an instinctive
prudence.  Powell did not know why it was he had resolved to keep
his own counsel as to his colloquy with Mr. Smith.  But his curiosity
did not slumber.  Some time afterwards, again at the relief of
watches, in the course of a little talk, he mentioned Mrs. Anthony's
father quite casually, and tried to find out from the mate who
he was.</p>

<p>"It would take a clever man to find that out, as things are on
board now," Mr. Franklin said, unexpectedly communicative.  "The
first I saw of him was when she brought him alongside in a four-wheeler
one morning about half-past eleven.  The captain had come on board
early, and was down in the cabin that had been fitted out for
him.  Did I tell you that if you want the captain for anything
you must stamp on the port side of the deck?  That's so.  This
ship is not only unlike what she used to be, but she is like no
other ship, anyhow.  Did you ever hear of the captain's room being
on the port side?  Both of them stern cabins have been fitted
up afresh like a blessed palace.  A gang of people from some tip-top
West-End house were fussing here on board with hangings and furniture
for a fortnight, as if the Queen were coming with us.  Of course
the starboard cabin is the bedroom one, but the poor captain hangs
out to port on a couch, so that in case we want him on deck at
night, Mrs. Anthony should not be startled.  Nervous!  Phoo! 
A woman who marries a sailor and makes up her mind to come to
sea should have no blamed jumpiness about her, I say.  But never
mind.  Directly the old cab pointed round the corner of the warehouse
I called out to the captain that his lady was coming aboard. 
He answered me, but as I didn't see him coming, I went down the
gangway myself to help her alight.  She jumps out excitedly without
touching my arm, or as much as saying "thank you" or "good morning"
or anything, turns back to the cab, and then that old joker comes
out slowly.  I hadn't noticed him inside.  I hadn't expected to
see anybody.  It gave me a start.  She says: "My father &mdash;Mr.
Franklin."  He was staring at me like an owl.  "How do you do,
sir?" says I.  Both of them looked funny.  It was as if something
had happened to them on the way.  Neither of them moved, and I
stood by waiting.  The captain showed himself on the poop; and
I saw him at the side looking over, and then he disappeared; on
the way to meet them on shore, I expected.  But he just went down
below again.  So, not seeing him, I said: "Let me help you on
board, sir."  "On board!" says he in a silly fashion.  "On board!" 
"It's not a very good ladder, but it's quite firm," says I, as
he seemed to be afraid of it.  And he didn't look a broken-down
old man, either.  You can see yourself what he is.  Straight as
a poker, and life enough in him yet.  But he made no move, and
I began to feel foolish.  Then she comes forward.  "Oh!  Thank
you, Mr. Franklin. I'll help my father up."  Flabbergasted me&mdash;to
be choked off like this. Pushed in between him and me without
as much as a look my way.  So of course I dropped it.  What do
you think?  I fell back.  I would have gone up on board at once
and left them on the quay to come up or stay there till next week,
only they were blocking the way.  I couldn't very well shove them
on one side.  Devil only knows what was up between them.  There
she was, pale as death, talking to him very fast.  He got as red
as a turkey-cock&mdash;dash me if he didn't.  A bad-tempered old bloke,
I can tell you.  And a bad lot, too.  Never mind.  I couldn't
hear what she was saying to him, but she put force enough into
it to shake her.  It seemed&mdash;it seemed, mind!&mdash;that he didn't
want to go on board.  Of course it couldn't have been that.  I
know better.  Well, she took him by the arm, above the elbow,
as if to lead him, or push him rather.  I was standing not quite
ten feet off.  Why should I have gone away?  I was anxious to
get back on board as soon as they would let me.  I didn't want
to overhear her blamed whispering either.  But I couldn't stay
there for ever, so I made a move to get past them if I could. 
And that's how I heard a few words.  It was the old chap&mdash;something
nasty about being "under the heel" of somebody or other.  Then
he says, "I don't want this sacrifice."  What it meant I can't
tell.  It was a quarrel&mdash;of that I am certain.  She looks over
her shoulder, and sees me pretty close to them. I don't know what
she found to say into his ear, but he gave way suddenly.  He looked
round at me too, and they went up together so quickly then that
when I got on the quarter-deck I was only in time to see the inner
door of the passage close after them.  Queer&mdash;eh?  But if it were
only queerness one wouldn't mind.  Some luggage in new trunks
came on board in the afternoon.  We undocked at midnight.  And
may I be hanged if I know who or what he was or is.  I haven't
been able to find out.  No, I don't know.  He may have been anything. 
All I know is that once, years ago when I went to see the Derby
with a friend, I saw a peaand-thimble chap who looked just like
that old mystery father out of a cab."</p>

<p>All this the goggle-eyed mate had said in a resentful and melancholy
voice, with pauses, to the gentle murmur of the sea.  It was for
him a bitter sort of pleasure to have a fresh pair of ears, a
newcomer, to whom he could repeat all these matters of grief and
suspicion talked over endlessly by the band of Captain Anthony's
faithful subordinates.  It was evidently so refreshing to his
worried spirit that it made him forget the advisability of a little
caution with a complete stranger.  But really with Mr. Powell
there was no danger.  Amused, at first, at these plaints, he provoked
them for fun.  Afterwards, turning them over in his mind, he became
impressed, and as the impression grew stronger with the days his
resolution to keep it to himself grew stronger too.</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>What made it all the easier to keep &mdash;I mean the resolution&mdash;was
that Powell's sentiment of amused surprise at what struck him
at first as mere absurdity was not unmingled with indignation. 
And his years were too few, his position too novel, his reliance
on his own opinion not yet firm enough to allow him to express
it with any effect.  And then&mdash;what would have been the use, anyhow&mdash;and
where was the necessity?</p>

<p>But this thing, familiar and mysterious at the same time, occupied
his imagination.  The solitude of the sea intensifies the thoughts
and the facts of one's experience which seems to lie at the very
centre of the world, as the ship which carries one always remains
the centre figure of the round horizon.  He viewed the apoplectic,
goggle-eyed mate and the saturnine, heavy-eyed steward as the
victims of a peculiar and secret form of lunacy which poisoned
their lives.  But he did not give them his sympathy on that account. 
No.  That strange affliction awakened in him a sort of suspicious
wonder.</p>

<p>Once&mdash;and it was at night again; for the officers of the <em>Ferndale</em>
keeping watch and watch as was customary in those days, had but
few occasions for intercourse&mdash;once, I say, the thick Mr. Franklin,
a quaintly bulky figure under the stars, the usual witnesses of
his outpourings, asked him with an abruptness which was not callous,
but in his simple way:</p>

<p>"I believe you have no parents living?"</p>

<p>Mr. Powell said that he had lost his father and mother at a very
early age.</p>

<p>"My mother is still alive," declared Mr. Franklin in a tone which
suggested that he was gratified by the fact.  "The old lady is
lasting well.  Of course she's got to be made comfortable.  A
woman must be looked after, and, if it comes to that, I say, give
me a mother.  I dare say if she had not lasted it out so well
I might have gone and got married.  I don't know, though.  We
sailors haven't got much time to look about us to any purpose. 
Anyhow, as the old lady was there I haven't, I may say, looked
at a girl in all my life.  Not that I wasn't partial to female
society in my time," he added with a pathetic intonation, while
the whites of his goggle eyes gleamed amorously under the clear
night sky.  "Very partial, I may say."</p>

<p>Mr. Powell was amused; and as these communications took place
only when the mate was relieved off duty he had no serious objection
to them.  The mate's presence made the first half-hour and sometimes
even more of his watch on deck pass away.  If his senior did not
mind losing some of his rest it was not Mr. Powell's affair. 
Franklin was a decent fellow.  His intention was not to boast
of his filial piety.</p>

<p>"Of course I mean respectable female society," he explained. 
"The other sort is neither here nor there.  I blame no man's conduct,
but a wellbrought-up young fellow like you knows that there's
precious little fun to be got out of it."  He fetched a deep sigh. 
"I wish Captain Anthony's mother had been a lasting sort like
my old lady.  He would have had to look after her and he would
have done it well.  Captain Anthony is a proper man.  And it would
have saved him from the most foolish&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not finish the phrase which certainly was turning bitter
in his mouth.  Mr. Powell thought to himself: "There he goes again." 
He laughed a little.</p>

<p>"I don't understand why you are so hard on the captain, Mr. Franklin. 
I thought you were a great friend of his."</p>

<p>Mr. Franklin exclaimed at this.  He was not hard on the captain. 
Nothing was further from his thoughts.  Friend!  Of course he
was a good friend and a faithful servant.  He begged Powell to
understand that if Captain Anthony chose to strike a bargain with
Old Nick to-morrow, and Old Nick were good to the captain, he
(Franklin) would find it in his heart to love Old Nick for the
captain's sake.  That was so.  On the other hand, if a saint,
an angel with white wings came along and&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off short again as if his own vehemence had frightened
him.  Then in his strained pathetic voice (which he had never
raised) he observed that it was no use talking.  Anybody could
see that the man was changed.</p>

<p>"As to that," said young Powell, "it is impossible for me to
judge."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" whispered the mate.  "An educated, clever young
fellow like you with a pair of eyes on him and some sense too! 
Is that how a happy man looks?  Eh?  Young you may be, but you
aren't a kid; and I dare you to say 'Yes!'"</p>

<p>Mr. Powell did not take up the challenge.  He did not know what
to think of the mate's view.  Still, it seemed as if it had opened
his understanding in a measure.  He conceded that the captain
did not look very well.</p>

<p>"Not very well," repeated the mate mournfully.  "Do you think
a man with a face like that can hope to live his life out?  You
haven't knocked about long in this world yet, but you are a sailor,
you have been in three or four ships, you say.  Well, have you
ever seen a shipmaster walking his own deck as if he did not know
what he had underfoot?  Have you?  Dam'me if I don't think that
he forgets where he is.  Of course he can be no other than a prime
seaman; but it's lucky, all the same, he has me on board.  I know
by this time what he wants done without being told. Do you know
that I have had no order given me since we left port?  Do you
know that he has never once opened his lips to me unless I spoke
to him first?  I?  His chief officer; his shipmate for full six
years, with whom he had no cross word&mdash;not once in all that time. 
Aye.  Not a cross look even.  True that when I do make him speak
to me, there is his dear old self, the quick eye, the kind voice. 
Could hardly be other to his old Franklin.  But what's the good? 
Eyes, voice, everything's miles away. And for all that I take
good care never to address him when the poop isn't clear.  Yes! 
Only we two and nothing but the sea with us.  You think it would
be all right; the only chief mate he ever had &mdash;Mr. Franklin
here and Mr. Franklin there&mdash;when anything went wrong the first
word you would hear about the decks was 'Franklin!' &mdash;I am
thirteen years older than he is&mdash;you would think it would be all
right, wouldn't you? Only we two on this poop on which we saw
each other first&mdash;he a young master&mdash;told me that he thought I
would suit him very well&mdash;we two, and thirty-one days out at sea,
and it's no good!  It's like talking to a man standing on shore. 
I can't get him back.  I can't get at him.  I feel sometimes as
if I must shake him by the arm: "Wake up!  Wake up!  You are wanted,
sir . . . !"</p>

<p>Young Powell recognized the expression of a true sentiment, a
thing so rare in this world where there are so many mutes and
so many excellent reasons even at sea for an articulate man not
to give himself away, that he felt something like respect for
this outburst.  It was not loud.  The grotesque squat shape, with
the knob of the head as if rammed down between the square shoulders
by a blow from a club, moved vaguely in a circumscribed space
limited by the two harness-casks lashed to the front rail of the
poop, without gestures, hands in the pockets of the jacket, elbows
pressed closely to its side; and the voice without resonance,
passed from anger to dismay and back again without a single louder
word in the hurried delivery, interrupted only by slight gasps
for air as if the speaker were being choked by the suppressed
passion of his grief.</p>

<p>Mr. Powell, though moved to a certain extent, was by no means
carried away.  And just as he thought that it was all over, the
other, fidgeting in the darkness, was heard again explosive, bewildered
but not very loud in the silence of the ship and the great empty
peace of the sea.</p>

<p>"They have done something to him!  What is it?  What can it be? 
Can't you guess?  Don't you know?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" Young Powell was astounded on discovering that
this was an appeal addressed to him.  "How on earth can I know?"</p>

<p>"You do talk to that white-faced, black-eyed . . . I've seen
you talking to her more than a dozen times."</p>

<p>Young Powell, his sympathy suddenly chilled, remarked in a disdainful
tone that Mrs. Anthony's eyes were not black.</p>

<p>"I wish to God she had never set them on the captain, whatever
colour they are," retorted Franklin.  "She and that old chap with
the scraped jaws who sits over her and stares down at her dead-white
face with his yellow eyes&mdash;confound them!  Perhaps you will tell
us that his eyes are not yellow?"</p>

<p>Powell, not interested in the colour of Mr. Smith's eyes, made
a vague gesture.  Yellow or not yellow, it was all one to him.</p>

<p>The mate murmured to himself.  "No.  He can't know.  No!  No
more than a baby.  It would take an older head."</p>

<p>"I don't even understand what you mean," observed Mr. Powell
coldly.</p>

<p>"And even the best head would be puzzled by such devil-work,"
the mate continued, muttering.  "Well, I have heard tell of women
doing for a man in one way or another when they got him fairly
ashore.  But to bring their devilry to sea and fasten on such
a man! . . . It's something I can't understand.  But I can watch. 
Let them look out &mdash;I say!"</p>

<p>His short figure, unable to stoop, without flexibility, could
not express dejection.  He was very tired suddenly; he dragged
his feet going off the poop.  Before he left it with nearly an
hour of his watch below sacrificed, he addressed himself once
more to our young man who stood abreast of the mizzen rigging
in an unreceptive mood expressed by silence and immobility.  He
did not regret, he said, having spoken openly on this very serious
matter.</p>

<p>"I don't know about its seriousness, sir," was Mr. Powell's frank
answer. "But if you think you have been telling me something very
new you are mistaken.  You can't keep that matter out of your
speeches.  It's the sort of thing I've been hearing more or less
ever since I came on board."</p>

<p>Mr. Powell, speaking truthfully, did not mean to speak offensively. 
He had instincts of wisdom; he felt that this was a serious affair,
for it had nothing to do with reason.  He did not want to raise
an enemy for himself in the mate.  And Mr. Franklin did not take
offence.  To Mr. Powell's truthful statement he answered with
equal truth and simplicity that it was very likely, very likely. 
With a thing like that (next door to witchcraft almost) weighing
on his mind, the wonder was that he could think of anything else. 
The poor man must have found in the restlessness of his thoughts
the illusion of being engaged in an active contest with some power
of evil; for his last words as he went lingeringly down the poop
ladder expressed the quaint hope that he would get him, Powell,
"on our side yet."</p>

<p>Mr. Powell&mdash;just imagine a straightforward youngster assailed
in this fashion on the high seas&mdash;answered merely by an embarrassed
and uneasy laugh which reflected exactly the state of his innocent
soul.  The apoplectic mate, already half-way down, went up again
three steps of the poop ladder.  Why, yes.  A proper young fellow,
the mate expected, wouldn't stand by and see a man, a good sailor
and his own skipper, in trouble without taking his part against
a couple of shore people who &mdash;Mr. Powell interrupted him
impatiently, asking what was the trouble?</p>

<p>"What is it you are hinting at?" he cried with an inexplicable
irritation.</p>

<p>"I don't like to think of him all alone down there with these
two," Franklin whispered impressively.  "Upon my word I don't. 
God only knows what may be going on there . . . Don't laugh .
. . It was bad enough last voyage when Mrs. Brown had a cabin
aft; but now it's worse.  It frightens me.  I can't sleep sometimes
for thinking of him all alone there, shut off from us all."</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown was the steward's wife.  You must understand that
shortly after his visit to the Fyne cottage (with all its consequences),
Anthony had got an offer to go to the Western Islands, and bring
home the cargo of some ship which, damaged in a collision or a
stranding, took refuge in St. Michael, and was condemned there. 
Roderick Anthony had connections which would put such paying jobs
in his way.  So Flora de Barral had but a five months' voyage,
a mere excursion, for her first trial of sea-life. And Anthony,
dearly trying to be most attentive, had induced this Mrs. Brown,
the wife of his faithful steward, to come along as maid to his
bride.  But for some reason or other this arrangement was not
continued. And the mate, tormented by indefinite alarms and forebodings,
regretted it.  He regretted that Jane Brown was no longer on board&mdash;as
a sort of representative of Captain Anthony's faithful servants,
to watch quietly what went on in that part of the ship this fatal
marriage had closed to their vigilance.  That had been excellent. 
For she was a dependable woman.</p>

<p>Powell did not detect any particular excellence in what seemed
a spying employment.  But in his simplicity he said that he should
have thought Mrs. Anthony would have been glad anyhow to have
another woman on board. He was thinking of the white-faced girlish
personality which it seemed to him ought to have been cared for. 
The innocent young man always looked upon the girl as immature;
something of a child yet.</p>

<p>"She! glad!  Why it was she who had her fired out.  She didn't
want anybody around the cabin.  Mrs. Brown is certain of it. 
She told her husband so.  You ask the steward and hear what he
has to say about it. That's why I don't like it.  A capable woman
who knew her place.  But no. Out she must go.  For no fault, mind
you.  The captain was ashamed to send her away.  But that wife
of his&mdash;aye the precious pair of them have got hold of him.  I
can't speak to him for a minute on the poop without that thimble-rigging
coon coming gliding up.  I'll tell you what.  I overheard once
&mdash;God knows I didn't try to&mdash;only he forgot I was on the
other side of the skylight with my sextant &mdash;I overheard
him&mdash;you know how he sits hanging over her chair and talking away
without properly opening his mouth&mdash;yes I caught the word right
enough.  He was alluding to the captain as "the jailer."  The
jail . . . !"</p>

<p>Franklin broke off with a profane execration.  A silence reigned
for a long time and the slight, very gentle rolling of the ship
slipping before the <em>N.E. </em>trade-wind seemed to be a soothing
device for lulling to sleep the suspicions of men who trust themselves
to the sea.</p>

<p>A deep sigh was heard followed by the mate's voice asking dismally
if that was the way one would speak of a man to whom one wished
well?  No better proof of something wrong was needed.  Therefore
he hoped, as he vanished at last, that Mr. Powell would be on
their side.  And this time Mr. Powell did not answer this hope
with an embarrassed laugh.</p>

<p>That young officer was more and more surprised at the nature
of the incongruous revelations coming to him in the surroundings
and in the atmosphere of the open sea.  It is difficult for us
to understand the extent, the completeness, the comprehensiveness
of his inexperience, for us who didn't go to sea out of a small
private school at the age of fourteen years and nine months. 
Leaning on his elbow in the mizzen rigging and so still that the
helmsman over there at the other end of the poop might have (and
he probably did) suspect him of being criminally asleep on duty,
he tried to "get hold of that thing" by some side which would
fit in with his simple notions of psychology.  "What the deuce
are they worrying about?" he asked himself in a dazed and contemptuous
impatience.  But all the same "jailer" was a funny name to give
a man; unkind, unfriendly, nasty.  He was sorry that Mr. Smith
was guilty in that matter because, the truth must be told, he
had been to a certain extent sensible of having been noticed in
a quiet manner by the father of Mrs. Anthony.  Youth appreciates
that sort of recognition which is the subtlest form of flattery
age can offer.  Mr. Smith seized opportunities to approach him
on deck.  His remarks were sometimes weird and enigmatical.</p>

<p>He was doubtless an eccentric old gent.  But from that to calling
his sonin-law (whom he never approached on deck) nasty names behind
his back was a long step.</p>

<p>And Mr. Powell marvelled . . . "</p>

<p>"While he was telling me all this," &mdash;Marlow changed his
tone&mdash;"I marvelled even more.  It was as if misfortune marked
its victims on the forehead for the dislike of the crowd.  I am
not thinking here of numbers.  Two men may behave like a crowd,
three certainly will when their emotions are engaged.  It was
as if the forehead of Flora de Barral were marked.  Was the girl
born to be a victim; to be always disliked and crushed as if she
were too fine for this world?  Or too luckless&mdash;since that also
is often counted as sin.</p>

<p>Yes, I marvelled more since I knew more of the girl than Mr.
Powell&mdash;if only her true name; and more of Captain Anthony&mdash;if
only the fact that he was the son of a delicate erotic poet of
a markedly refined and autocratic temperament.  Yes, I knew their
joint stories which Mr. Powell did not know.  The chapter in it
he was opening to me, the sea-chapter, with such new personages
as the sentimental and apoplectic chief-mate and the morose steward,
however astounding to him in its detached condition was much more
so to me as a member of a series, following the chapter outside
the Eastern Hotel in which I myself had played my part.  In view
of her declarations and my sage remarks it was very unexpected. 
She had meant well, and I had certainly meant well too.  Captain
Anthony&mdash;as far as I could gather from little Fyne&mdash;had meant
well.  As far as such lofty words may be applied to the obscure
personages of this story we were all filled with the noblest sentiments
and intentions.  The sea was there to give them the shelter of
its solitude free from the earth's petty suggestions.  I could
well marvel in myself, as to what had happened.</p>

<p>I hope that if he saw it, Mr. Powell forgave me the smile of
which I was guilty at that moment.  The light in the cabin of
his little cutter was dim.  And the smile was dim too.  Dim and
fleeting.  The girl's life had presented itself to me as a tragi-comical
adventure, the saddest thing on earth, slipping between frank
laughter and unabashed tears.  Yes, the saddest facts and the
most common, and, being common perhaps the most worthy of our
unreserved pity.</p>

<p>The purely human reality is capable of lyrism but not of abstraction.
Nothing will serve for its understanding but the evidence of rational
linking up of characters and facts.  And beginning with Flora
de Barral, in the light of my memories I was certain that she
at least must have been passive; for that is of necessity the
part of women, this waiting on fate which some of them, and not
the most intelligent, cover up by the vain appearances of agitation. 
Flora de Barral was not exceptionally intelligent but she was
thoroughly feminine.  She would be passive (and that does not
mean inanimate) in the circumstances, where the mere fact of being
a woman was enough to give her an occult and supreme significance. 
And she would be enduring which is the essence of woman's visible,
tangible power.  Of that I was certain.  Had she not endured already? 
Yet it is so true that the germ of destruction lies in wait for
us mortals, even at the very source of our strength, that one
may die of too much endurance as well as of too little of it.</p>

<p>Such was my train of thought.  And I was mindful also of my first
view of her&mdash;toying or perhaps communing in earnest with the possibilities
of a precipice.  But I did not ask Mr. Powell anxiously what had
happened to Mrs. Anthony in the end.  I let him go on in his own
way feeling that no matter what strange facts he would have to
disclose, I was certain to know much more of them than he ever
did know or could possibly guess . . . "</p>

<p>Marlow paused for quite a long time.  He seemed uncertain as
though he had advanced something beyond my grasp.  Purposely I
made no sign.  "You understand?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Perfectly," I said.  "You are the expert in the psychological
wilderness.  This is like one of those Red-skin stories where
the noble savages carry off a girl and the honest backwoodsman
with his incomparable knowledge follows the track and reads the
signs of her fate in a footprint here, a broken twig there, a
trinket dropped by the way.  I have always liked such stories. 
Go on."</p>

<p>Marlow smiled indulgently at my jesting.  "It is not exactly
a story for boys," he said.  "I go on then.  The sign, as you
call it, was not very plentiful but very much to the purpose,
and when Mr. Powell heard (at a certain moment I felt bound to
tell him) when he heard that I had known Mrs. Anthony before her
marriage, that, to a certain extent, I was her confidant . . .
For you can't deny that to a certain extent . . . Well let us
say that I had a look in . . . A young girl, you know, is something
like a temple.  You pass by and wonder what mysterious rites are
going on in there, what prayers, what visions?  The privileged
men, the lover, the husband, who are given the key of the sanctuary
do not always know how to use it.  For myself, without claim,
without merit, simply by chance I had been allowed to look through
the half-opened door and I had seen the saddest possible desecration,
the withered brightness of youth, a spirit neither made cringing
nor yet dulled but as if bewildered in quivering hopelessness
by gratuitous cruelty; self-confidence destroyed and, instead,
a resigned recklessness, a mournful callousness (and all this
simple, almost naive)&mdash;before the material and moral difficulties
of the situation.  The passive anguish of the luckless!</p>

<p>I asked myself: wasn't that ill-luck exhausted yet?  Ill-luck
which is like the hate of invisible powers interpreted, made sensible
and injurious by the actions of men?</p>

<p>Mr. Powell as you may well imagine had opened his eyes at my
statement. But he was full of his recalled experiences on board
the <em>Ferndale</em>, and the strangeness of being mixed up in
what went on aboard, simply because his name was also the name
of a shipping-master, kept him in a state of wonder which made
other coincidences, however unlikely, not so very surprising after
all.</p>

<p>This astonishing occurrence was so present to his mind that he
always felt as though he were there under false pretences.  And
this feeling was so uncomfortable that it nerved him to break
through the awe-inspiring aloofness of his captain.  He wanted
to make a clean breast of it.  I imagine that his youth stood
in good stead to Mr. Powell.  Oh, yes.  Youth is a power.  Even
Captain Anthony had to take some notice of it, as if it refreshed
him to see something untouched, unscarred, unhardened by suffering. 
Or perhaps the very novelty of that face, on board a ship where
he had seen the same faces for years, attracted his attention.</p>

<p>Whether one day he dropped a word to his new second officer or
only looked at him I don't know; but Mr. Powell seized the opportunity
whatever it was.  The captain who had started and stopped in his
everlasting rapid walk smoothed his brow very soon, heard him
to the end and then laughed a little.</p>

<p>"Ah!  That's the story.  And you felt you must put me right as
to this."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter how you came on board," said Anthony.  And
then showing that perhaps he was not so utterly absent from his
ship as Franklin supposed: "That's all right.  You seem to be
getting on very well with everybody," he said in his curt hurried
tone, as if talking hurt him, and his eyes already straying over
the sea as usual.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Powell tells me that looking then at the strong face to which
that haggard expression was returning, he had the impulse, from
some confused friendly feeling, to add: "I am very happy on board
here, sir."</p>

<p>The quickly returning glance, its steadiness, abashed Mr. Powell
and made him even step back a little.  The captain looked as though
he had forgotten the meaning of the word.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;what?  Oh yes . . . You . . . of course . . . Happy.  Why
not?"</p>

<p>This was merely muttered; and next moment Anthony was off on
his headlong tramp his eyes turned to the sea away from his ship.</p>

<p>A sailor indeed looks generally into the great distances, but
in Captain Anthony's case there was&mdash;as Powell expressed it&mdash;something
particular, something purposeful like the avoidance of pain or
temptation.  It was very marked once one had become aware of it. 
Before, one felt only a pronounced strangeness.  Not that the
captain &mdash;Powell was careful to explain&mdash;didn't see things
as a ship-master should.  The proof of it was that on that very
occasion he desired him suddenly after a period of silent pacing,
to have all the staysails sheets eased off, and he was going on
with some other remarks on the subject of these staysails when
Mrs. Anthony followed by her father emerged from the companion. 
She established herself in her chair to leeward of the skylight
as usual. Thereupon the captain cut short whatever he was going
to say, and in a little while went down below.</p>

<p>I asked Mr. Powell whether the captain and his wife never conversed
on deck.  He said no&mdash;or at any rate they never exchanged more
than a couple of words.  There was some constraint between them. 
For instance, on that very occasion, when Mrs. Anthony came out
they did look at each other; the captain's eyes indeed followed
her till she sat down; but he did not speak to her; he did not
approach her; and afterwards left the deck without turning his
head her way after this first silent exchange of glances.</p>

<p>I asked Mr. Powell what did he do then, the captain being out
of the way. "I went over and talked to Mrs. Anthony.  I was thinking
that it must be very dull for her.  She seemed to be such a stranger
to the ship."</p>

<p>"The father was there of course?"</p>

<p>"Always," said Powell.  "He was always there sitting on the skylight,
as if he were keeping watch over her.  And I think," he added,
"that he was worrying her.  Not that she showed it in any way. 
Mrs. Anthony was always very quiet and always ready to look one
straight in the face."</p>

<p>"You talked together a lot?" I pursued my inquiries.  "She mostly
let me talk to her," confessed Mr. Powell.  "I don't know that
she was very much interested&mdash;but still she let me.  She never
cut me short."</p>

<p>All the sympathies of Mr. Powell were for Flora Anthony nee de
Barral. She was the only human being younger than himself on board
that ship since the <em>Ferndale</em> carried no boys and was
manned by a full crew of able seamen.  Yes! their youth had created
a sort of bond between them. Mr. Powell's open countenance must
have appeared to her distinctly pleasing amongst the mature, rough,
crabbed or even inimical faces she saw around her.  With the warm
generosity of his age young Powell was on her side, as it were,
even before he knew that there were sides to be taken on board
that ship, and what this taking sides was about.  There was a
girl.  A nice girl.  He asked himself no questions.  Flora de
Barral was not so much younger in years than himself; but for
some reason, perhaps by contrast with the accepted idea of a captain's
wife, he could not regard her otherwise but as an extremely youthful
creature. At the same time, apart from her exalted position, she
exercised over him the supremacy a woman's earlier maturity gives
her over a young man of her own age.  As a matter of fact we can
see that, without ever having more than a half an hour's consecutive
conversation together, and the distances duly preserved, these
two were becoming friends&mdash;under the eye of the old man, I suppose.</p>

<p>How he first got in touch with his captain's wife Powell relates
in this way.  It was long before his memorable conversation with
the mate and shortly after getting clear of the channel.  It was
gloomy weather; dead head wind, blowing quite half a gale; the
<em>Ferndale</em> under reduced sail was stretching close-hauled
across the track of the homeward bound ships, just moving through
the water and no more, since there was no object in pressing her
and the weather looked threatening.  About ten o'clock at night
he was alone on the poop, in charge, keeping well aft by the weather
rail and staring to windward, when amongst the white, breaking
seas, under the black sky, he made out the lights of a ship. 
He watched them for some time.  She was running dead before the
wind of course.  She will pass jolly close&mdash;he said to himself;
and then suddenly he felt a great mistrust of that approaching
ship.  She's heading straight for us&mdash;he thought.  It was not
his business to get out of the way.  On the contrary.  And his
uneasiness grew by the recollection of the forty tons of dynamite
in the body of the <em>Ferndale</em>; not the sort of cargo one
thinks of with equanimity in connection with a threatened collision. 
He gazed at the two small lights in the dark immensity filled
with the angry noise of the seas.  They fascinated him till their
plainness to his sight gave him a conviction that there was danger
there.  He knew in his mind what to do in the emergency, but very
properly he felt that he must call the captain out at once.</p>

<p>He crossed the deck in one bound.  By the immemorial custom and
usage of the sea the captain's room is on the starboard side. 
You would just as soon expect your captain to have his nose at
the back of his head as to have his state-room on the port side
of the ship.  Powell forgot all about the direction on that point
given him by the chief.  He flew over as I said, stamped with
his foot and then putting his face to the cowl of the big ventilator
shouted down there: "Please come on deck, sir," in a voice which
was not trembling or scared but which we may call fairly expressive. 
There could not be a mistake as to the urgence of the call. But
instead of the expected alert "All right!" and the sound of a
rush down there, he heard only a faint exclamation&mdash;then silence.</p>

<p>Think of his astonishment!  He remained there, his ear in the
cowl of the ventilator, his eyes fastened on those menacing sidelights
dancing on the gusts of wind which swept the angry darkness of
the sea.  It was as though he had waited an hour but it was something
much less than a minute before he fairly bellowed into the wide
tube "Captain Anthony!"  An agitated "What is it?" was what he
heard down there in Mrs. Anthony's voice, light rapid footsteps
. . . Why didn't she try to wake him up!  "I want the captain,"
he shouted, then gave it up, making a dash at the companion where
a blue light was kept, resolved to act for himself.</p>

<p>On the way he glanced at the helmsman whose face lighted up by
the binnacle lamps was calm.  He said rapidly to him: "Stand by
to spin that helm up at the first word."  The answer "Aye, aye,
sir," was delivered in a steady voice.  Then Mr. Powell after
a shout for the watch on deck to "lay aft," ran to the ship's
side and struck the blue light on the rail.</p>

<p>A sort of nasty little spitting of sparks was all that came. 
The light (perhaps affected by damp) had failed to ignite.  The
time of all these various acts must be counted in seconds.  Powell
confessed to me that at this failure he experienced a paralysis
of thought, of voice, of limbs. The unexpectedness of this misfire
positively overcame his faculties.  It was the only thing for
which his imagination was not prepared.  It was knocked clean
over.  When it got up it was with the suggestion that he must
do something at once or there would be a broadside smash accompanied
by the explosion of dynamite, in which both ships would be blown
up and every soul on board of them would vanish off the earth
in an enormous flame and uproar.</p>

<p>He saw the catastrophe happening and at the same moment, before
he could open his mouth or stir a limb to ward off the vision,
a voice very near his ear, the measured voice of Captain Anthony
said: "Wouldn't light&mdash;eh? Throw it down!  Jump for the flare-up."</p>

<p>The spring of activity in Mr. Powell was released with great
force.  He jumped.  The flare-up was kept inside the companion
with a box of matches ready to hand.  Almost before he knew he
had moved he was diving under the companion slide.  He got hold
of the can in the dark and tried to strike a light.  But he had
to press the flare-holder to his breast with one arm, his fingers
were damp and stiff, his hands trembled a little. One match broke. 
Another went out.  In its flame he saw the colourless face of
Mrs. Anthony a little below him, standing on the cabin stairs.
Her eyes which were very close to his (he was in a crouching posture
on the top step) seemed to burn darkly in the vanishing light. 
On deck the captain's voice was heard sudden and unexpectedly
sardonic: "You had better look sharp, if you want to be in time."</p>

<p>"Let me have the box," said Mrs. Anthony in a hurried and familiar
whisper which sounded amused as if they had been a couple of children
up to some lark behind a wall.  He was glad of the offer which
seemed to him very natural, and without ceremony&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here you are.  Catch hold."</p>

<p>Their hands touched in the dark and she took the box while he
held the paraffin soaked torch in its iron holder.  He thought
of warning her: "Look out for yourself."  But before he had the
time to finish the sentence the flare blazed up violently between
them and he saw her throw herself back with an arm across her
face.  "Hallo," he exclaimed; only he could not stop a moment
to ask if she was hurt.  He bolted out of the companion straight
into his captain who took the flare from him and held it high
above his head.</p>

<p>The fierce flame fluttered like a silk flag, throwing an angry
swaying glare mingled with moving shadows over the poop, lighting
up the concave surfaces of the sails, gleaming on the wet paint
of the white rails.  And young Powell turned his eyes to windward
with a catch in his breath.</p>

<p>The strange ship, a darker shape in the night, did not seem to
be moving onwards but only to grow more distinct right abeam,
staring at the <em>Ferndale</em> with one green and one red eye
which swayed and tossed as if they belonged to the restless head
of some invisible monster ambushed in the night amongst the waves. 
A moment, long like eternity, elapsed, and, suddenly, the monster
which seemed to take to itself the shape of a mountain shut its
green eye without as much as a preparatory wink.</p>

<p>Mr. Powell drew a free breath.  "All right now," said Captain
Anthony in a quiet undertone.  He gave the blazing flare to Powell
and walked aft to watch the passing of that menace of destruction
coming blindly with its parti-coloured stare out of a blind night
on the wings of a sweeping wind.  Her very form could be distinguished
now black and elongated amongst the hissing patches of foam bursting
along her path.</p>

<p>As is always the case with a ship running before wind and sea
she did not seem to an onlooker to move very fast; but to be progressing
indolently in long leisurely bounds and pauses in the midst of
the overtaking waves. It was only when actually passing the stern
within easy hail of the <em>Ferndale</em>, that her headlong speed
became apparent to the eye.  With the red light shut off and soaring
like an immense shadow on the crest of a wave she was lost to
view in one great, forward swing, melting into the lightless space.</p>

<p>"Close shave," said Captain Anthony in an indifferent voice just
raised enough to be heard in the wind.  "A blind lot on board
that ship.  Put out the flare now."</p>

<p>Silently Mr. Powell inverted the holder, smothering the flame
in the can, bringing about by the mere turn of his wrist the fall
of darkness upon the poop.  And at the same time vanished out
of his mind's eye the vision of another flame enormous and fierce
shooting violently from a white churned patch of the sea, lighting
up the very clouds and carrying upwards in its volcanic rush flying
spars, corpses, the fragments of two destroyed ships.  It vanished
and there was an immense relief.  He told me he did not know how
scared he had been, not generally but of that very thing his imagination
had conjured, till it was all over.  He measured it (for fear
is a great tension) by the feeling of slack weariness which came
over him all at once.</p>

<p>He walked to the companion and stooping low to put the flare
in its usual place saw in the darkness the motionless pale oval
of Mrs. Anthony's face.  She whispered quietly:</p>

<p>"Is anything going to happen?  What is it?"</p>

<p>"It's all over now," he whispered back.</p>

<p>He remained bent low, his head inside the cover staring at that
white ghostly oval.  He wondered she had not rushed out on deck. 
She had remained quietly there.  This was pluck.  Wonderful self-restraint. 
And it was not stupidity on her part.  She knew there was imminent
danger and probably had some notion of its nature.</p>

<p>"You stayed here waiting for what would come," he murmured admiringly.</p>

<p>"Wasn't that the best thing to do?" she asked.</p>

<p>He didn't know.  Perhaps.  He confessed he could not have done
it.  Not he.  His flesh and blood could not have stood it.  He
would have felt he must see what was coming.  Then he remembered
that the flare might have scorched her face, and expressed his
concern.</p>

<p>"A bit.  Nothing to hurt.  Smell the singed hair?"</p>

<p>There was a sort of gaiety in her tone.  She might have been
frightened but she certainly was not overcome and suffered from
no reaction.  This confirmed and augmented if possible Mr. Powell's
good opinion of her as a "jolly girl," though it seemed to him
positively monstrous to refer in such terms to one's captain's
wife.  "But she doesn't look it," he thought in extenuation and
was going to say something more to her about the lighting of that
flare when another voice was heard in the companion, saying some
indistinct words.  Its tone was contemptuous; it came from below,
from the bottom of the stairs.  It was a voice in the cabin. 
And the only other voice which could be heard in the main cabin
at this time of the evening was the voice of Mrs. Anthony's father. 
The indistinct white oval sank from Mr. Powell's sight so swiftly
as to take him by surprise.  For a moment he hung at the opening
of the companion and now that her slight form was no longer obstructing
the narrow and winding staircase the voices came up louder but
the words were still indistinct. The old gentleman was excited
about something and Mrs. Anthony was "managing him" as Powell
expressed it.  They moved away from the bottom of the stairs and
Powell went away from the companion.  Yet he fancied he had heard
the words "Lost to me" before he withdrew his head.  They had
been uttered by Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>Captain Anthony had not moved away from the taffrail.  He remained
in the very position he took up to watch the other ship go by
rolling and swinging all shadowy in the uproar of the following
seas.  He stirred not; and Powell keeping near by did not dare
speak to him, so enigmatical in its contemplation of the night
did his figure appear to his young eyes: indistinct&mdash;and in its
immobility staring into gloom, the prey of some incomprehensible
grief, longing or regret.</p>

<p>Why is it that the stillness of a human being is often so impressive,
so suggestive of evil&mdash;as if our proper fate were a ceaseless
agitation?  The stillness of Captain Anthony became almost intolerable
to his second officer.  Mr. Powell loitering about the skylight
wanted his captain off the deck now.  "Why doesn't he go below?"
he asked himself impatiently. He ventured a cough.</p>

<p>Whether the effect of the cough or not Captain Anthony spoke. 
He did not move the least bit.  With his back remaining turned
to the whole length of the ship he asked Mr. Powell with some
brusqueness if the chief mate had neglected to instruct him that
the captain was to be found on the port side.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Mr. Powell approaching his back.  "The mate
told me to stamp on the port side when I wanted you; but I didn't
remember at the moment."</p>

<p>"You should remember," the captain uttered with an effort.  Then
added mumbling "I don't want Mrs. Anthony frightened.  Don't you
see? . . ."</p>

<p>"She wasn't this time," Powell said innocently: "She lighted
the flare-up for me, sir."</p>

<p>"This time," Captain Anthony exclaimed and turned round.  "Mrs.
Anthony lighted the flare?  Mrs. Anthony! . . . "  Powell explained
that she was in the companion all the time.</p>

<p>"All the time," repeated the captain.  It seemed queer to Powell
that instead of going himself to see the captain should ask him:</p>

<p>"Is she there now?"</p>

<p>Powell said that she had gone below after the ship had passed
clear of the <em>Ferndale</em>.  Captain Anthony made a movement
towards the companion himself, when Powell added the information. 
"Mr. Smith called to Mrs. Anthony from the saloon, sir.  I believe
they are talking there now."</p>

<p>He was surprised to see the captain give up the idea of going
below after all.</p>

<p>He began to walk the poop instead regardless of the cold, of
the damp wind and of the sprays.  And yet he had nothing on but
his sleeping suit and slippers.  Powell placing himself on the
break of the poop kept a look-out.  When after some time he turned
his head to steal a glance at his eccentric captain he could not
see his active and shadowy figure swinging to and fro.  The second
mate of the <em>Ferndale</em> walked aft peering about and addressed
the seaman who steered.</p>

<p>"Captain gone below?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the fellow who with a quid of tobacco bulging
out his left cheek kept his eyes on the compass card.  "This minute. 
He laughed."</p>

<p>"Laughed," repeated Powell incredulously.  "Do you mean the captain
did? You must be mistaken.  What would he want to laugh for?"</p>

<p>"Don't know, sir."</p>

<p>The elderly sailor displayed a profound indifference towards
human emotions.  However, after a longish pause he conceded a
few words more to the second officer's weakness.  "Yes.  He was
walking the deck as usual when suddenly he laughed a little and
made for the companion.  Thought of something funny all at once."</p>

<p>Something funny!  That Mr. Powell could not believe.  He did
not ask himself why, at the time.  Funny thoughts come to men,
though, in all sorts of situations; they come to all sorts of
men.  Nevertheless Mr. Powell was shocked to learn that Captain
Anthony had laughed without visible cause on a certain night. 
The impression for some reason was disagreeable.  And it was then,
while finishing his watch, with the chilly gusts of wind sweeping
at him out of the darkness where the short sea of the soundings
growled spitefully all round the ship, that it occurred to his
unsophisticated mind that perhaps things are not what they are
confidently expected to be; that it was possible that Captain
Anthony was not a happy man . . . In so far you will perceive
he was to a certain extent prepared for the apoplectic and sensitive
Franklin's lamentations about his captain.  And though he treated
them with a contempt which was in a great measure sincere, yet
he admitted to me that deep down within him an inexplicable and
uneasy suspicion that all was not well in that cabin, so unusually
cut off from the rest of the ship, came into being and grew against
his will.</p>
