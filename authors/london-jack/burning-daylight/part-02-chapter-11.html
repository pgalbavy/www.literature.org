<P>
Throughout the week Daylight found himself almost as much
interested in Bob as in Dede; and, not being in the thick of any
big deals, he was probably more interested in both of them than
in the business game.  Bob's trick of whirling was of especial
moment to him.  How to overcome it,--that was the thing.  Suppose
he did meet with Dede out in the hills; and suppose, by some
lucky stroke of fate, he should manage to be riding alongside of
her; then that whirl of Bob's would be most disconcerting and
embarrassing.  He was not particularly anxious for her to see him
thrown forward on Bob's neck.  On the other hand, suddenly to
leave her and go dashing down the back-track, plying quirt and
spurs, wouldn't do, either.
<P>
What was wanted was a method wherewith to prevent that lightning
whirl.  He must stop the animal before it got around.  The reins
would not do this.  Neither would the spurs.  Remained the quirt.
<P>
But how to accomplish it?  Absent-minded moments were many that
week, when, sitting in his office chair, in fancy he was astride
the wonderful chestnut sorrel and trying to prevent an
anticipated
whirl.  One such moment, toward the end of the week,
occurred in the middle of a conference with Hegan.  Hegan,
elaborating a new and dazzling legal vision, became aware that
Daylight was not listening.  His eyes had gone lack-lustre, and
he, too, was seeing with inner vision.
<P>
"Got it" he cried suddenly.  "Hegan, congratulate me.  It's as
simple as rolling off a log.  All I've got to do is hit him on
the nose, and hit him hard."
<P>
Then he explained to the startled Hegan, and became a good
listener again, though he could not refrain now and again from
making audible chuckles of satisfaction and delight.  That was
the scheme.  Bob always whirled to the right.  Very well.  He
would double the quirt in his hand and, the instant of the whirl,
that doubled quirt would rap Bob on the nose.  The horse didn't
live, after it had once learned the lesson, that would whirl in
the face of the doubled quirt.
<P>
More keenly than ever, during that week in the office did
Daylight realize that he had no social, nor even human contacts
with Dede.  The situation was such that he could not ask her the
simple question whether or not she was going riding next Sunday. 
It was a hardship of a new sort, this being the employer of a
pretty girl.  He looked at her often, when the routine work of
the day was going on, the question he could not ask her tickling
at the founts of speech--Was she going riding next Sunday?  And
as
he looked, he wondered how old she was, and what love passages
she had had, must have had, with those college whippersnappers
with whom, according to Morrison, she herded and danced.  His
mind was very full of her, those six days between the Sundays,
and one thing he came to know thoroughly well; he wanted her. 
And so much did he want her that his old timidity of the
apron-string was put to rout.  He, who had run away from women
most of his life, had now grown so courageous as to pursue.  Some
Sunday, sooner or later, he would meet her outside the office,
somewhere in the hills, and then, if they did not get acquainted,
it would be because she did not care to get acquainted.
<P>
Thus he found another card in the hand the mad god had dealt him.
<P>
How important that card was to become he did not dream, yet he
decided that it was a pretty good card.  In turn, he doubted. 
Maybe it was a trick of Luck to bring calamity and disaster upon
him.  Suppose Dede wouldn't have him, and suppose he went on
loving her more and more, harder and harder?  All his old
generalized terrors of love revived.  He remembered the
disastrous love affairs of men and women he had known in the
past.  There was Bertha Doolittle, old Doolittle's daughter, who
had been madly in love with Dartworthy, the rich Bonanza fraction
owner; and Dartworthy, in turn, not loving Bertha at all, but
madly loving Colonel Walthstone's wife and eloping down the Yukon
with her; and Colonel Walthstone himself, madly loving his own
wife and lighting out in pursuit of the fleeing couple.  And what
had been the outcome?  Certainly Bertha's love had been
unfortunate and tragic, and so had the love of the other three. 
Down below Minook, Colonel Walthstone and Dartworthy had fought
it out.  Dartworthy had been killed.  A bullet through the
Colonel's lungs had so weakened him that he died of pneumonia the
following spring.  And the Colonel's wife had no one left alive
on earth to love.
<P>
And then there was Freda, drowning herself in the running
mush-ice because of some man on the other side of the world, and
hating him, Daylight, because he had happened along and pulled
her out of the mush-ice and back to life.  And the Virgin.... 
The old memories frightened him.  If this love-germ gripped him
good and hard, and if Dede wouldn't have him, it might be almost
as bad as being gouged out of all he had by Dowsett, Letton, and
Guggenhammer.  Had his nascent desire for Dede been less, he
might well have been frightened out of all thought of her.  As it
was, he found consolation in the thought that some love affairs
did come out right.  And for all he knew, maybe Luck had stacked
the cards for him to win.  Some men were born lucky, lived lucky
all their days, and died lucky.  Perhaps, too, he was such a man,
a born luck-pup who could not lose.
<P>
Sunday came, and Bob, out in the Piedmont hills, behaved like an
angel.  His goodness, at times, was of the spirited prancing
order, but otherwise he was a lamb.  Daylight, with doubled quirt
ready in his right hand, ached for a whirl, just one whirl, which
Bob, with an excellence of conduct that was tantalizing, refused
to perform.  But no Dede did Daylight encounter.  He vainly
circled about among the hill roads and in the afternoon took the
steep grade over the divide of the second range and dropped into
Maraga Valley.  Just after passing the foot of the descent, he
heard the hoof beats of a cantering horse.  It was from ahead and
coming toward him.  What if it were Dede?  He turned Bob around
and started to return at a walk.  If it were Dede, he was born to
luck, he decided; for the meeting couldn't have occurred under
better circumstances.  Here they were, both going in the same
direction, and the canter would bring her up to him just where
the stiff grade would compel a walk.  There would be nothing else
for her to do than ride with him to the top of the divide; and,
once there, the equally stiff descent on the other side would
compel more walking.
<P>
The canter came nearer, but he faced straight ahead until he
heard the horse behind check to a walk.  Then he glanced over his
shoulder.  It was Dede.  The recognition was quick, and, with
her, accompanied by surprise.  What more natural thing than that,
partly turning his horse, he should wait till she caught up with
him; and that, when abreast they should continue abreast on up
the grade?  He could have sighed with relief.  The thing was
accomplished, and so easily.  Greetings had been exchanged; here
they were side by side and going in the same direction with miles
and miles ahead of them.
<P>
He noted that her eye was first for the horse and next for him. 
<P>
"Oh, what a beauty" she had cried at sight of Bob.  From the
shining light in her eyes, and the face filled with delight, he
would scarcely have believed that it belonged to a young woman he
had known in the office, the young woman with the controlled,
subdued office face
<P>
"I didn't know you rode," was one of her first remarks.  "I
imagined you were wedded to get-there-quick machines."
<P>
"I've just taken it up lately," was his answer.  "Beginning to
get stout; you know, and had to take it off somehow."
<P>
She gave a quick sidewise glance that embraced him from head to
heel, including seat and saddle, and said:--
<P>
"But you've ridden before."
<P>
She certainly had an eye for horses and things connected with
horses was his thought, as he replied:-
<P>
"Not for many years.  But I used to think I was a regular
rip-snorter when I was a youngster up in Eastern Oregon, sneaking
away from camp to ride with the cattle and break cayuses and
that sort of thing."
<P>
Thus, and to his great relief, were they launched on a topic of
mutual interest.  He told her about Bob's tricks, and of the
whirl and his scheme to overcome it; and she agreed that horses
had to be handled with a certain rational severity, no matter how
much one loved them.  There was her Mab, which she had for eight
years and which she had had break of stall-kicking.  The process
had been painful for Mab, but it had cured her.
<P>
"You've ridden a lot," Daylight said.
<P>
"I really can't remember the first time I was on a horse," she
told him.  "I was born on a ranch, you know, and they couldn't
keep me away from the horses.  I must have been born with the
love for them.  I had my first pony, all my own, when I was six. 
When I was eight I knew what it was to be all day in the saddle
along with Daddy.  By the time I was eleven he was taking me on
my first deer hunts.  I'd be lost without a horse.  I hate
indoors, and without Mab here I suppose I'd have been sick and
dead long ago."
<P>
"You like the country?" he queried, at the same moment catching
his first glimpse of a light in her eyes other than gray.  "As
much as I detest the city," she answered.  "But a woman can't
earn a living in the country.  So I make the best of it--along
with Mab."
<P>
And thereat she told him more of her ranch life in the days
before her father died.  And Daylight was hugely pleased with
himself.  They were getting acquainted.  The conversation had not
lagged in the full half hour they had been together.
<P>
"We come pretty close from the same part of the country," he
said.  "I was raised in Eastern Oregon, and that's none so far
from Siskiyou."
<P>
The next moment he could have bitten out his tongue for her quick
question was:--
<P>
"How did you know I came from Siskiyou?  I'm sure I never
mentioned it."
<P>
"I don't know," he floundered temporarily.  "I heard somewhere
that you were from thereabouts."
<P>
Wolf, sliding up at that moment, sleek-footed and like a shadow,
caused her horse to shy and passed the awkwardness off, for they
talked Alaskan dogs until the conversation drifted back to
horses.  And horses it was, all up the grade and down the other
side.
<P>
When she talked, he listened and followed her, and yet all the
while he was following his own thoughts and impressions as well. 
It was a nervy thing for her to do, this riding astride, and he
didn't know, after all, whether he liked it or not.  His ideas of
women were prone to be old-fashioned; they were the ones he had
imbibed in the early-day, frontier life of his youth, when no
woman was seen on anything but a side-saddle.  He had grown up to
the tacit fiction that women on horseback were not bipeds.  It
came to him with a shock, this sight of her so manlike in her
saddle.  But he had to confess that the sight looked good to him
just
<P>
Two other immediate things about her struck him.  First, there
were the golden spots in her eyes.  Queer that he had never
noticed them before.  Perhaps the light in the office had not
been right, and perhaps they came and went.  No; they were glows
of color--a sort of diffused, golden light.  Nor was it golden,
either, but it was nearer that than any color he knew.  It
certainly was not any shade of yellow.  A lover's thoughts are
ever colored, and it is to be doubted if any one else in the
world would have called Dede's eyes golden.  But Daylight's mood
verged on the tender and melting, and he preferred to think of
them as golden, and therefore they were golden.
<P>
And then she was so natural.  He had been prepared to find her a
most difficult young woman to get acquainted with.  Yet here it
was proving so simple.  There was nothing highfalutin about her
company manners--it was by this homely phrase that he
differentiated this Dede on horseback from the Dede with the
office manners whom he had always known.  And yet, while he was
delighted with the smoothness with which everything was going,
and with the fact that they had found plenty to talk about, he
was aware of an irk under it all.  After all, this talk was empty
and idle.  He was a man of action, and he wanted her, Dede Mason,
the woman; he wanted her to love him and to be loved by him; and
he wanted all this glorious consummation then and there.  Used to
forcing issues used to gripping men and things and bending them
to his will, he felt, now, the same compulsive prod of mastery. 
He wanted to tell her that he loved her and that there was
nothing else for her to do but marry him.  And yet he did not
obey the prod.  Women were fluttery creatures, and here mere
mastery would prove a bungle.  He remembered all his hunting
guile, the long patience of shooting meat in famine when a hit or
a miss meant life or death.  Truly, though this girl did not yet
mean quite that, nevertheless she meant much to him--more, now,
than ever, as he rode beside her, glancing at her as often as he
dared, she in her corduroy riding-habit, so bravely manlike, yet
so essentially and revealingly woman, smiling, laughing, talking,
her eyes sparkling, the flush of a day of sun and summer breeze
warm in her cheeks.
