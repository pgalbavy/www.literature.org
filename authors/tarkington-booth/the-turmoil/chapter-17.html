<p>That "mystery about pianos" which troubled Bibbs had been a mystery
to Mr. Vertrees, and it was being explained to him at about the
time Bibbs scribbled the reference to it in his notes. Mary had
gone up-stairs upon Bibbs's departure at ten o'clock, and Mr.
and Mrs. Vertrees sat until after midnight in the library, talking.
And in all that time they found not one cheerful topic, but became
more depressed with everything and with every phase of everything
that they discussed&mdash;no extraordinary state of affairs in a family
which has always "held up its head,"  only to arrive in the end
at a point where all it can do is to look on helplessly at the
processes of its own financial dissolution. For that was the point
which this despairing couple had reached&mdash;they could do nothing
except look on and talk about it. They were only vaporing, and
they knew it.</p>

<p>"She needn't to have done that about her piano," vapored Mr.
Vertrees. "We could have managed somehow without it. At least
she ought to have consulted me, and if she insisted I could have
arranged the details with the&mdash;the dealer."</p>

<p>"She thought that it might be&mdash;annoying for you," Mrs. Vertrees
explained. "Really, she planned for you not to know about it until
they had removed&mdash;until after to-morrow, that is, but I decided
to&mdash;to mention it. You see, she didn't even tell me about it until
this morning. She has another idea, too, I'm afraid. It's&mdash;it's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" he urged, as she found it difficult to go on.</p>

<p>"Her other idea is&mdash;that is, it was &mdash;I think it can be
avoided, of course&mdash;it was about her furs."</p>

<p>"No!" he exclaimed, quickly. "I won't have it! You must see to
that. I'd rather not talk to her about it, but you mustn't let
her."</p>

<p>"I'll try not," his wife promised. "Of course, they're very handsome."</p>

<p>"All the more reason for her to keep them!" he returned, irritably.
"We're not <em>THAT </em>far gone, I think!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not yet," Mrs. Vertrees said. "She seems to be troubled
about the&mdash;the coal matter and&mdash;about Tilly. Of course the piano
will take care of some things like those for a while and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't like it. I gave her the piano to play on, not to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mustn't be distressed about it in <em>ONE </em>way," she
said, comfortingly. "She arranged with the&mdash;with the purchaser
that the men will come for it about half after five in the afternoon.
The days are so short now it's really quite winter."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he agreed, moodily. "So far as that goes people have
a right to move a piece of furniture without stirring up the neighbors,
I suppose, even by daylight. I don't suppose <em>OUR </em>neighbors
are paying much attention just now, though I hear Sheridan was
back in his office early the morning after the funeral."</p>

<p>Mrs. Vertrees made a little sound of commiseration. "I don't
believe that was because he wasn't suffering, though. I'm sure
it was only because he felt his business was so important. Mary
told me he seemed wrapped up in his son's succeeding; and that
was what he bragged about most. He isn't vulgar in his boasting,
I understand; he doesn't talk a great deal about his&mdash;his actual
money&mdash;though there was something about blades of grass that I
didn't comprehend. I think he meant something about his energy&mdash;but
perhaps not. No, his bragging usually seemed to be not so much
a personal vainglory as about his family and the greatness of
this city."</p>

<p>"'Greatness of this city'!" Mr. Vertrees echoed, with dull bitterness.
"It's nothing but a coal-hole! I suppose it looks 'great' to the
man who has the luck to make it work for him. I suppose it looks
'great' to any <em>YOUNG </em>man, too, starting out to make his
fortune out of it. The fellows that get what they want out of
it say it's 'great,' and everybody else gets the habit. But you
have a different point of view if it's the city that got what
it wanted out of you! Of course Sheridan says it's 'great'."</p>

<p>Mrs. Vertrees seemed unaware of this unusual outburst. "I believe,"
she began, timidly, "he doesn't boast of&mdash;that is, I understand
he has never seemed so interested in the&mdash;the other one."</p>

<p>Her husband's face was dark, but at that a heavier shadow fell
upon it; he looked more haggard than before. "'The other one',"
he repeated, averting his eyes. "You mean&mdash;you mean the third
son&mdash;the one that was here this evening?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the&mdash;the youngest," she returned, her voice so feeble it
was almost a whisper.</p>

<p>And then neither of them spoke for several long minutes. Nor
did either look at the other during that silence.</p>

<p>At last Mr. Vertrees contrived to cough, but not convincingly.
"What&mdash;ah&mdash;what was it Mary said about him out in the hall, when
she came in this afternoon? I heard you asking her something about
him, but she answered in such a low voice I didn't&mdash;ah&mdash;happen
to catch it."</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she didn't say much. All she said was this: I asked her
if she had enjoyed her walk with him, and she said, 'He's the
most wistful creature I've ever known.'"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"That was all. He IS wistful-looking; and so fragile&mdash;though
he doesn't seem quite so much so lately. I was watching Mary from
the window when she went out to-day, and he joined her, and if
I hadn't known about him I'd have thought he had quite an interesting
face."</p>

<p>"If you 'hadn't known about him'? Known what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, of course," she said, hurriedly. "Nothing definite,
that is. Mary said decidely, long ago, that he's not at all insane,
as we thought at first. It's only&mdash;well, of course it IS odd,
their attitude about him. I suppose it's some nervous trouble
that makes him&mdash;perhaps a little queer at times, so that he can't
apply himself to anything&mdash;or perhaps does odd things. But, after
all, of course, we only have an impression about it. We don't
know&mdash;that is, positively. <em>I&mdash;" </em>She paused, then went
on: "I didn't know just how to ask&mdash;that is &mdash;I didn't mention
it to Mary. I didn't &mdash;<em>I&mdash;" </em>The poor lady floundered
pitifully, concluding with a mumble. "So soon after&mdash;after the&mdash;the
shock."</p>

<p>"I don't think I've caught more than a glimpse of him," said
Mr. Vertrees. "I wouldn't know him if I saw him, but your impression
of him is&mdash;" He broke off suddenly, springing to his feet in agitation.
"I can't imagine her&mdash;oh, NO!" he gasped. And he began to pace
the floor. "A half-witted epileptic!"</p>

<p>"No, no!" she cried. "He may be all right. We&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's horrible! I can't&mdash;" He threw himself back into his
chair again, sweeping his hands across his face, then letting
them fall limply at his sides.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vertrees was tremulous. "You mustn't give way so," she said,
inspired for once almost to direct discourse. "Whatever Mary might
think of doing, it wouldn't be on her own account; it would be
on ours. But if WE should&mdash;should consider it, that wouldn't be
on <em>OUR </em>own account. It isn't because we think of ourselves."</p>

<p>"Oh God, no!" he groaned. "Not for us! We can go to the poorhouse,
but Mary can't be a stenographer!"</p>

<p>Sighing, Mrs. Vertrees resumed her obliqueness. "Of course,"
she murmured, "it all seems very premature, speculating about
such things, but I had a queer sort of feeling that she seemed
quite interested in this&mdash;" She had almost said "in this one,"
but checked herself. "In this young man. It's natural, of course;
she is always so strong and well, and he is&mdash;he seems to be, that
is&mdash;rather appealing to the&mdash;the sympathies."</p>

<p>"Yes!" he agreed, bitterly. "Precisely. The sympathies!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she faltered, "perhaps you might feel easier if I
could have a little talk with some one?"</p>

<p>"With whom?"</p>

<p>"I had thought of&mdash;not going about it too brusquely, of course,
but perhaps just waiting for his name to be mentioned, if I happened
to be talking with somebody that knew the family&mdash;and then I might
find a chance to say that I was sorry to hear he'd been ill so
much, and &mdash;Something of that kind perhaps?"</p>

<p>"You don't know anybody that knows the family."</p>

<p>"Yes. That is&mdash;well, in a way, of course, one OF the family.
That Mrs. Roscoe Sheridan is not a&mdash;that is, she's rather a pleasant-faced
little woman, I think, and of course rather ordinary. I think
she is interested about&mdash;that is, of course, she'd be anxious
to be more intimate with Mary, naturally. She's always looking
over here from her house; she was looking out the window this
afternoon when Mary went out, I noticed&mdash;though I don't think
Mary saw her. I'm sure she wouldn't think it out of place to&mdash;to
be frank about matters. She called the other day, and Mary must
rather like her&mdash;she said that evening that the call had done
her good. Don't you think it might be wise?"</p>

<p>"Wise? I don't know. I feel the whole matter is impossible."</p>

<p>"Yes, so do I," she returned, promptly. "It isn't really a thing
we should be considering seriously, of course. Still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should say not! But possibly&mdash;"</p>

<p>Thus they skirmished up and down the field, but before they turned
the lights out and went up-stairs it was thoroughly understood
between them that Mrs. Vertrees should seek the earliest opportunity
to obtain definite information from Sibyl Sheridan concerning
the mental and physical status of Bibbs. And if he were subject
to attacks of lunacy, the unhappy pair decided to prevent the
sacrifice they supposed their daughter intended to make of herself.
Altogether, if there were spiteful ghosts in the old house that
night, eavesdropping upon the woeful comedy, they must have died
anew of laughter!</p>

<p>Mrs. Vertrees's opportunity occurred the very next afternoon.
Darkness had fallen, and the piano-movers had come. They were
carrying the piano down the front steps, and Mrs. Vertrees was
standing in the open doorway behind them, preparing to withdraw,
when she heard a sharp exclamation; and Mrs. Roscoe Sheridan,
bareheaded, emerged from the shadow into the light of the doorway.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" she cried. "It did give me a fright!"</p>

<p>"It's Mrs. Sheridan, isn't it?" Mrs. Vertrees was perplexed by
this informal appearance, but she reflected that it might be providential.
"Won't you come in?"</p>

<p>"No. Oh no, thank you!" Sibyl panted, pressing her hand to her
side. "You don't know what a fright you've given me! And it was
nothing but your piano!" She laughed shrilly. "You know, since
our tragedy coming so suddenly the other day, you have no idea
how upset I've been&mdash;almost hysterical! And I just glanced out
of the window, a minute or so ago, and saw your door wide open
and black figures of men against the light, carrying something
heavy, and I almost fainted. You see, it was just the way it looked
when I saw them bringing my poor brother-in-law in, next door,
only such a few short days ago. And I thought I'd seen your daughter
start for a drive with Bibbs Sheridan in a car about three o'clock&mdash;and&mdash;
They aren't back yet, are they?"</p>

<p>"No. Good heavens!"</p>

<p>"And the only thing I could think of was that something must
have happened to them, and I just dashed over&mdash;and it was only
your <em>PIANO!"  </em>She broke into laughter again. "I suppose
you're just sending it somewhere to be repaired, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's being taken down-town," said Mrs. Vertrees. "Won't
you come in and make me a little visit. I was SO sorry, the other
day, that I was&mdash;ah&mdash;" She stopped inconsequently, then repeated
her invitation. "Won't you come in? I'd really&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you, but I must be running back. My husband usually gets
home about this time, and I make a little point of it always to
be there."</p>

<p>"That's very sweet." Mrs. Vertrees descended the steps and walked
toward the street with Sibyl. "It's quite balmy for so late in
November, isn't it? Almost like a May evening."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Miss Vertrees will miss her piano," said Sibyl, watching
the instrument disappear into the big van at the curb. "She plays
wonderfully, Mrs. Kittersby tells me."</p>

<p>"Yes, she plays very well. One of your relatives came to hear
her yesterday, after dinner, and I think she played all evening
for him."</p>

<p>"You mean Bibbs?" asked Sibyl.</p>

<p>"The&mdash;the youngest Mr. Sheridan. Yes. He's very musical, isn't
he?"</p>

<p>"I never heard of it. But I shouldn't think it would matter much
whether he was or not, if he could get Miss Vertrees to play to
him. Does your daughter expect the piano back soon?"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I believe not immediately. Mr. Sheridan came last evening
to hear her play because she had arranged with the&mdash;that is, it
was to be removed this afternoon. He seems almost well again."</p>

<p>"Yes." Sibyl nodded. "His father's going to try to start him
to work."</p>

<p>"He seems very delicate," said Mrs. Vertrees. "I shouldn't think
he would be able to stand a great deal, either physically or&mdash;"
She paused and then added, glowing with the sense of her own adroitness&mdash;"or
mentally."</p>

<p>"Oh, mentally Bibbs is all right," said Sibyl, in an odd voice.</p>

<p>"Entirely?" Mrs. Vertrees asked, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Yes, entirely."</p>

<p>"But has he <em>ALWAYS </em>been?" This question came with the
same anxious eagerness.</p>

<p>"Certainly. He had a long siege of nervous dyspepsia, but he's
over it."</p>

<p>"And you think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bibbs is all right. You needn't wor&mdash;" Sibyl choked, and pressed
her handkerchief to her mouth. "Good night, Mrs. Vertrees," she
said, hurriedly, as the head-lights of an automobile swung round
the corner above, sending a brightening glare toward the edge
of the pavement where the two ladies were standing.</p>

<p>"Won't you come in?" urged Mrs. Vertrees, cordially, hearing
the sound of a cheerful voice out of the darkness beyond the approaching
glare. "Do! There's Mary now, and she&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Sibyl was half-way across the street. "No, thanks," she called.
"I hope she won't miss her piano!" And she ran into her own house
and plunged headlong upon a leather divan in the hall, holding
her handkerchief over her mouth.</p>

<p>The noise of her tumultuous entrance was evidently startling
in the quiet house, for upon the bang of the door there followed
the crash of a decanter, dropped upon the floor of the dining-room
at the end of the hall; and, after a rumble of indistinct profanity,
Roscoe came forth, holding a dripping napkin in his hand.</p>

<p>"What's your excitement?" he demanded. "What do you find to go
into hysterics over? Another death in the family?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's funny!" she gasped. "Those old frost-bitten people!
I guess <em>THEY'RE </em>getting their come-uppance!" Lying prone,
she elevated her feet in the air, clapped her heels together repeatedly,
in an ecstasy.</p>

<p>"Come through, come through!" said her husband, crossly. "What
you been up to?"</p>

<p>"Me?" she cried, dropping her feet and swinging around to face
him. "Nothing. It's them! Those Vertreeses!" She wiped her eyes.
"They've had to sell their piano!"</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?"</p>

<p>"That Mrs. Kittersby told me all about 'em a week ago," said
Sibyl. "They've been hard up for a long time, and she says as
long ago as last winter she knew that girl got a pair of walking-shoes
re-soled and patched, because she got it done the same place Mrs.
Kittersby's cook had <em>HERS! </em>And the night of the house-warming
I kind of got suspicious, myself. She didn't have one single piece
of any kind of real jewelry, and you could see her dress was an
old one done over. Men can't tell those things, and you all made
a big fuss over her, but I thought she looked a sight, myself!
Of course, <em>EDITH </em>was crazy to have her, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well?" he urged, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm <em>TELLING </em>you! Mrs. Kittersby says they haven't
got a <em>THING! </em>Just absolutely <em>NOTHING&mdash;</em>and they
don't know anywhere to turn! The family's all died out but them,
and all the relatives they got are very distant, and live East
and scarcely know 'em. She says the whole town's been wondering
what <em>WOULD </em>become of 'em. The girl had plenty chances
to marry up to a year or so ago, but she was so indifferent she
scared the men off, and the ones that had wanted to went and married
other girls. Gracious! they were lucky! Marry <em>HER? </em>The
man that found himself tied up to <em>THAT </em>girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Terrible funny, terrible funny!" said Roscoe, with sarcasm.
"It's so funny I broke a cut-glass decanter and spilled a quart
of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait!" she begged. "You'll see. I was sitting by the window
a little while ago, and I saw a big wagon drive up across the
street and some men go into the house. It was too dark to make
out much, and for a minute I got the idea they were moving out&mdash;the
house has been foreclosed on, Mrs. Kittersby says. It seemed funny,
too, because I knew that girl was out riding with Bibbs. Well,
I thought I'd see, so I slipped over&mdash;and it was their <em>PIANO!
</em>They'd sold it and were trying to sneak it out after dark,
so nobody'd catch on!" Again she gave way to her enjoyment, but
resumed, as her husband seemed about to interrupt the narrative.
"Wait a minute, can't you? The old lady was superintending, and
she gave it all away. I sized her up for one of those old churchy
people that tell all kinds of lies except when it comes to so
many words, and then they can't. She might just as well told me
outright! Yes, they'd sold it; and I hope they'll pay some of
their debts. They owe everybody, and last week a coal-dealer made
an awful fuss at the door with Mr. Vertrees. Their cook told our
upstairs girl, and she said she didn't know <em>WHEN </em>she'd
seen any money, herself! Did you ever hear of such a case as that
girl in your <em>LIFE</em>?"</p>

<p>"What girl? Their cook?"</p>

<p>"That Vertrees girl! Don't you see they looked on our coming
up into this neighborhood as their last chance? They were just
going down and out, and here bobs up the green, rich Sheridan
family! So they doll the girl up in her old things, made over,
and send her out to get a Sheridan&mdash;she's <em>GOT </em>to get
one! And she just goes in blind; and she tries it on first with
<em>YOU. </em>You remember, she just plain <em>TOLD </em>you she
was going to mash you, and then she found out you were the married
one, and turned right square around to Jim and carried him off
his feet. Oh, Jim was landed&mdash;there's no doubt about <em>THAT!
</em>But Jim was lucky; he didn't live to <em>STAY </em>landed,
and it's a good thing for him!" Sibyl's mirth had vanished, and
she spoke with virulent rapidity. "Well, she couldn't get you,
because you were married, and she couldn't get Jim, because Jim
died. And there they were, dead broke! Do you know what she did?
Do you know what she's <em>DOING</em>?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," said Roscoe, gruffly.</p>

<p>Sibyl's voice rose and culminated in a scream of renewed hilarity.
"<em>BIBBS! </em>She waited in the grave-yard, and drove home
with him from <em>JIM'S FUNERAL! </em>Never spoke to him before!
Jim wasn't <em>COLD</em>!"</p>

<p>She rocked herself back and forth upon the divan. "Bibbs!" she
shrieked. "Bibbs! Roscoe, <em>THINK </em>of it! <em>BIBBS</em>!"</p>

<p>He stared unsympathetically, but her mirth was unabated for all
that. "And yesterday," she continued, between paroxysms&mdash;"yesterday
she came out of the house&mdash;just as he was passing. She must have
been looking out&mdash;waiting for the chance; I saw the old lady watching
at the window! And she got him there last night&mdash;to '<em>PLAY'
</em>to him; the old lady gave that away! And to-day she made
him take her out in a machine! And the cream of it is that they
didn't even know whether he was <em>INSANE </em>or not&mdash;they thought
maybe he was, but she went after him just the same! The old lady
set herself to pump me about it to-day. <em>BIBBS! </em>Oh, my
Lord! <em>BIBBS</em>!"</p>

<p>But Roscoe looked grim. "So it's funny to you, is it? It sounds
kind of pitiful to me. I should think it would to a woman, too."</p>

<p>"Oh, it might," she returned, sobering. "It might, if those people
weren't such frozen-faced smart Alecks. If they'd had the decency
to come down off the perch a little I probably wouldn't think
it was funny, but to see 'em sit up on their pedestal all the
time they're eating dirt&mdash;well, I think it's funny! That girl
sits up as if she was Queen Elizabeth, and expects people to wallow
on the ground before her until they get near enough for her to
give 'em a good kick with her old patched shoes&mdash;oh, she'd do
<em>THAT, </em>all right!&mdash;and then she powders up and goes out
to mash &mdash;<em>BIBBS SHERIDAN</em>!"</p>

<p>"Look here," said Roscoe, heavily; "I don't care about that one
way or another. If you're through, I got something I want to talk
to you about. I was going to, that day just before we heard about
Jim."</p>

<p>At this Sibyl stiffened quickly; her eyes became intensely bright.
"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Well," he began, frowning, "what I was going to say then&mdash;"
He broke off, and, becoming conscious that he was still holding
the wet napkin in his hand, threw it pettishly into a corner.
"I never expected I'd have to say anything like this to anybody
I <em>MARRIED; </em>but I was going to ask you what was the matter
between you and Lamhorn."</p>

<p>Sibyl uttered a sharp monosyllable. "Well?"</p>

<p>"I felt the time had come for me to know about it," he went on.
"You never told me anything&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You never asked," she interposed, curtly.</p>

<p>"Well, we'd got in a way of not talking much," said Roscoe. "It
looks to me now as if we'd pretty much lost the run of each other
the way a good many people do. I don't say it wasn't my fault.
I was up early and down to work all day, and I'd come home tired
at night, and want to go to bed soon as I'd got the paper read&mdash;unless
there was some good musical show in town. Well, you seemed all
right until here lately, the last month or so, I began to see
something was wrong. I couldn't help seeing it."</p>

<p>"Wrong?" she said. "What like?"</p>

<p>"You changed; you didn't look the same. You were all strung up
and excited and fidgety; you got to looking peakid and run down.
Now then, Lamhorn had been going with us a good while, but I noticed
that not long ago you got to picking on him about every little
thing he did; you got to quarreling with him when I was there
and when I wasn't. I could see you'd been quarreling whenever
I came in and he was here."</p>

<p>"Do you object to that?" asked Sibyl, breathing quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;when it injures my wife's health!" he returned, with a
quick lift of his eyes to hers. "You began to run down just about
the time you began falling out with him." He stepped close to
her. "See here, Sibyl, I'm going to know what it means."</p>

<p>"Oh, you <em>ARE?" </em>she snapped.</p>

<p>"You're trembling," he said, gravely.</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm angry enough to do more than tremble, you'll find.
Go on!"</p>

<p>"That was all I was going to say the other day," he said. "I
was going to ask you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, that was all you were going to say <em>THE OTHER DAY. </em>Yes.
What else have you to say to-night?"</p>

<p>"To-night," he replied, with grim swiftness, "I want to know
why you keep telephoning him you want to see him since he stopped
coming here."</p>

<p>She made a long, low sound of comprehension before she said,
"And what else did Edith want you to ask me?"</p>

<p>"I want to know what you say over the telephone to Lamhorn,"
he said, fiercely.</p>

<p>"Is that all Edith told you to ask me? You saw her when you stopped
in there on your way home this evening, didn't you? Didn't she
tell you then what I said over the telephone to Mr. Lamhorn?"</p>

<p>"No, she didn't!" he vociferated, his voice growing louder. "She
said, 'You tell your wife to stop telephoning Robert Lamhorn to
come and see her, because he isn't going to do it!' That's what
she said! And I want to know what it means. I intend&mdash;"</p>

<p>A maid appeared at the lower end of the hall. "Dinner is ready,"
she said, and, giving the troubled pair one glance, went demurely
into the dining-room. Roscoe disregarded the interruption.</p>

<p>"I intend to know exactly what has been going on," he declared.
"I mean to know just what&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sibyl jumped up, almost touching him, standing face to face with
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, you DO!" she cried, shrilly. "You mean to know just what's
what, do you? You listen to your sister insinuating ugly things
about your wife, and then you come home making a scene before
the servants and humiliating me in their presence! Do you suppose
that Irish girl didn't hear every word you said? You go in there
and eat your dinner alone! Go on! Go and eat your dinner alone&mdash;because
I won't eat with you!"</p>

<p>And she broke away from the detaining grasp he sought to fasten
upon her, and dashed up the stairway, panting. He heard the door
of her room slam overhead, and the sharp click of the key in the
lock.</p>
