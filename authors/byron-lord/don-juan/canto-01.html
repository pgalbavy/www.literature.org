I want a hero: an uncommon want,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When every year and month sends forth a new one,<br/>
Till, after cloying the gazettes with cant,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The age discovers he is not the true one;<br/>
Of such as these I should not care to vaunt,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I 'll therefore take our ancient friend Don Juan&mdash;<br/>
We all have seen him, in the pantomime,<br/>
Sent to the devil somewhat ere his time.

</p>
<p>
Vernon, the butcher Cumberland, Wolfe, Hawke,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince Ferdinand, Granby, Burgoyne, Keppel, Howe,<br/>
Evil and good, have had their tithe of talk,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fill'd their sign posts then, like Wellesley now;<br/>
Each in their turn like Banquo's monarchs stalk,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Followers of fame, 'nine farrow' of that sow:<br/>
France, too, had Buonaparte and Dumourier<br/>
Recorded in the Moniteur and Courier.

</p>
<p>
Barnave, Brissot, Condorcet, Mirabeau,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Petion, Clootz, Danton, Marat, La Fayette,<br/>
Were French, and famous people, as we know:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And there were others, scarce forgotten yet,<br/>
Joubert, Hoche, Marceau, Lannes, Desaix, Moreau,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With many of the military set,<br/>
Exceedingly remarkable at times,<br/>
But not at all adapted to my rhymes.

</p>
<p>
Nelson was once Britannia's god of war,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And still should be so, but the tide is turn'd;<br/>
There 's no more to be said of Trafalgar,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is with our hero quietly inurn'd;<br/>
Because the army 's grown more popular,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At which the naval people are concern'd;<br/>
Besides, the prince is all for the land-service,<br/>
Forgetting Duncan, Nelson, Howe, and Jervis.

</p>
<p>
Brave men were living before Agamemnon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And since, exceeding valorous and sage,<br/>
A good deal like him too, though quite the same none;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But then they shone not on the poet's page,<br/>
And so have been forgotten:<br/>
&mdash;I condemn none,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But can't find any in the present age<br/>
Fit for my poem (that is, for my new one);<br/>
So, as I said, I 'll take my friend Don Juan.

</p>
<p>
Most epic poets plunge 'in medias res'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Horace makes this the heroic turnpike road),<br/>
And then your hero tells, whene'er you please,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What went before&mdash;by way of episode,<br/>
While seated after dinner at his ease,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside his mistress in some soft abode,<br/>
Palace, or garden, paradise, or cavern,<br/>
Which serves the happy couple for a tavern.

</p>
<p>
That is the usual method, but not mine&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My way is to begin with the beginning;<br/>
The regularity of my design<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Forbids all wandering as the worst of sinning,<br/>
And therefore I shall open with a line<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Although it cost me half an hour in spinning)<br/>
Narrating somewhat of Don Juan's father,<br/>
And also of his mother, if you 'd rather.

</p>
<p>
In Seville was he born, a pleasant city,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Famous for oranges and women&mdash;he<br/>
Who has not seen it will be much to pity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So says the proverb&mdash;and I quite agree;<br/>
Of all the Spanish towns is none more pretty,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cadiz perhaps&mdash;but that you soon may see;<br/>
Don Juan's parents lived beside the river,<br/>
A noble stream, and call'd the Guadalquivir.

</p>
<p>
His father's name was Jose<br/>
&mdash;Don, of course,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A true Hidalgo, free from every stain<br/>
Of Moor or Hebrew blood, he traced his source<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the most Gothic gentlemen of Spain;<br/>
A better cavalier ne'er mounted horse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, being mounted, e'er got down again,<br/>
Than Jose, who begot our hero, who<br/>
Begot&mdash;but that 's to come<br/>
&mdash;Well, to renew:

</p>
<p>
His mother was a learned lady, famed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For every branch of every science known<br/>
In every Christian language ever named,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With virtues equall'd by her wit alone,<br/>
She made the cleverest people quite ashamed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And even the good with inward envy groan,<br/>
Finding themselves so very much exceeded<br/>
In their own way by all the things that she did.

</p>
<p>
Her memory was a mine: she knew by heart<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All Calderon and greater part of Lope,<br/>
So that if any actor miss'd his part<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She could have served him for the prompter's copy;<br/>
For her Feinagle's were an useless art,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he himself obliged to shut up shop&mdash;he<br/>
Could never make a memory so fine as<br/>
That which adorn'd the brain of Donna Inez.

</p>
<p>
Her favourite science was the mathematical,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her noblest virtue was her magnanimity,<br/>
Her wit (she sometimes tried at wit) was Attic all,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her serious sayings darken'd to sublimity;<br/>
In short, in all things she was fairly what I call<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A prodigy&mdash;her morning dress was dimity,<br/>
Her evening silk, or, in the summer, muslin,<br/>
And other stuffs, with which I won't stay puzzling.

</p>
<p>
She knew the Latin&mdash;that is, 'the Lord's prayer,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Greek&mdash;the alphabet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;I 'm nearly sure;<br/>
She read some French romances here and there,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although her mode of speaking was not pure;<br/>
For native Spanish she had no great care,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least her conversation was obscure;<br/>
Her thoughts were theorems, her words a problem,<br/>
As if she deem'd that mystery would ennoble 'em.

</p>
<p>
She liked the English and the Hebrew tongue,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And said there was analogy between 'em;<br/>
She proved it somehow out of sacred song,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I must leave the proofs to those who 've seen 'em;<br/>
But this I heard her say, and can't be wrong<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all may think which way their judgments lean 'em,<br/>
''T is strange&mdash;the Hebrew noun which means "I am,"<br/>
The English always use to govern d&mdash;n.'

</p>
<p>
Some women use their tongues&mdash;she look'd a lecture,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each eye a sermon, and her brow a homily,<br/>
An all-in-all sufficient self-director,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the lamented late Sir Samuel Romilly,<br/>
The Law's expounder, and the State's corrector,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose suicide was almost an anomaly&mdash;<br/>
One sad example more, that 'All is vanity'<br/>
(The jury brought their verdict in 'Insanity').

</p>
<p>
In short, she was a walking calculation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Edgeworth's novels stepping from their covers,<br/>
Or Mrs. Trimmer's books on education,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or 'Coelebs' Wife' set out in quest of lovers,<br/>
Morality's prim personification,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In which not Envy's self a flaw discovers;<br/>
To others' share let 'female errors fall,'<br/>
For she had not even one&mdash;the worst of all.

</p>
<p>
O! she was perfect past all parallel&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of any modern female saint's comparison;<br/>
So far above the cunning powers of hell,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her guardian angel had given up his garrison;<br/>
Even her minutest motions went as well<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As those of the best time-piece made by Harrison:<br/>
In virtues nothing earthly could surpass her,<br/>
Save thine 'incomparable oil,' Macassar!

</p>
<p>
Perfect she was, but as perfection is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Insipid in this naughty world of ours,<br/>
Where our first parents never learn'd to kiss<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till they were exiled from their earlier bowers,<br/>
Where all was peace, and innocence, and bliss<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(I wonder how they got through the twelve hours),<br/>
Don Jose, like a lineal son of Eve,<br/>
Went plucking various fruit without her leave.

</p>
<p>
He was a mortal of the careless kind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With no great love for learning, or the learn'd,<br/>
Who chose to go where'er he had a mind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And never dream'd his lady was concern'd;<br/>
The world, as usual, wickedly inclined<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To see a kingdom or a house o'erturn'd,<br/>
Whisper'd he had a mistress, some said two&mdash;<br/>
But for domestic quarrels one will do.

</p>
<p>
Now Donna Inez had, with all her merit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A great opinion of her own good qualities;<br/>
Neglect, indeed, requires a saint to bear it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And such, indeed, she was in her moralities;<br/>
But then she had a devil of a spirit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sometimes mix'd up fancies with realities,<br/>
And let few opportunities escape<br/>
Of getting her liege lord into a scrape.

</p>
<p>
This was an easy matter with a man<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft in the wrong, and never on his guard;<br/>
And even the wisest, do the best they can,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have moments, hours, and days, so unprepared,<br/>
That you might 'brain them with their lady's fan;'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sometimes ladies hit exceeding hard,<br/>
And fans turn into falchions in fair hands,<br/>
And why and wherefore no one understands.

</p>
<p>
'T is pity learned virgins ever wed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With persons of no sort of education,<br/>
Or gentlemen, who, though well born and bred,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grow tired of scientific conversation:<br/>
I don't choose to say much upon this head,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I 'm a plain man, and in a single station,<br/>
But<br/>
&mdash;Oh! ye lords of ladies intellectual,<br/>
Inform us truly, have they not hen-peck'd you all?

</p>
<p>
Don Jose and his lady quarrell'd&mdash;why,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not any of the many could divine,<br/>
Though several thousand people chose to try,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was surely no concern of theirs nor mine;<br/>
I loathe that low vice&mdash;curiosity;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But if there 's anything in which I shine,<br/>
'T is in arranging all my friends' affairs,<br/>
Not having of my own domestic cares.

</p>
<p>
And so I interfered, and with the best<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Intentions, but their treatment was not kind;<br/>
I think the foolish people were possess'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For neither of them could I ever find,<br/>
Although their porter afterwards confess'd&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But that 's no matter, and the worst 's behind,<br/>
For little Juan o'er me threw, down stairs,<br/>
A pail of housemaid's water unawares.

</p>
<p>
A little curly-headed, good-for-nothing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And mischief-making monkey from his birth;<br/>
His parents ne'er agreed except in doting<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the most unquiet imp on earth;<br/>
Instead of quarrelling, had they been but both in<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their senses, they 'd have sent young master forth<br/>
To school, or had him soundly whipp'd at home,<br/>
To teach him manners for the time to come.

</p>
<p>
Don Jose and the Donna Inez led<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For some time an unhappy sort of life,<br/>
Wishing each other, not divorced, but dead;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They lived respectably as man and wife,<br/>
Their conduct was exceedingly well-bred,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And gave no outward signs of inward strife,<br/>
Until at length the smother'd fire broke out,<br/>
And put the business past all kind of doubt.

</p>
<p>
For Inez call'd some druggists and physicians,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tried to prove her loving lord was mad;<br/>
But as he had some lucid intermissions,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She next decided he was only bad;<br/>
Yet when they ask'd her for her depositions,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No sort of explanation could be had,<br/>
Save that her duty both to man and God<br/>
Required this conduct&mdash;which seem'd very odd.

</p>
<p>
She kept a journal, where his faults were noted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And open'd certain trunks of books and letters,<br/>
All which might, if occasion served, be quoted;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then she had all Seville for abettors,<br/>
Besides her good old grandmother (who doted);<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearers of her case became repeaters,<br/>
Then advocates, inquisitors, and judges,<br/>
Some for amusement, others for old grudges.

</p>
<p>
And then this best and weakest woman bore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With such serenity her husband's woes,<br/>
Just as the Spartan ladies did of yore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who saw their spouses kill'd, and nobly chose<br/>
Never to say a word about them more&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Calmly she heard each calumny that rose,<br/>
And saw his agonies with such sublimity,<br/>
That all the world exclaim'd, 'What magnanimity!'

</p>
<p>
No doubt this patience, when the world is damning us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is philosophic in our former friends;<br/>
'T is also pleasant to be deem'd magnanimous,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The more so in obtaining our own ends;<br/>
And what the lawyers call a 'malus animus'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Conduct like this by no means comprehends;<br/>
Revenge in person 's certainly no virtue,<br/>
But then 't is not my fault, if others hurt you.

</p>
<p>
And if your quarrels should rip up old stories,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And help them with a lie or two additional,<br/>
I 'm not to blame, as you well know&mdash;no more is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Any one else&mdash;they were become traditional;<br/>
Besides, their resurrection aids our glories<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, which is what we just were wishing all:<br/>
And science profits by this resurrection&mdash;<br/>
Dead scandals form good subjects for dissection.

</p>
<p>
Their friends had tried at reconciliation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then their relations, who made matters worse.<br/>
('T were hard to tell upon a like occasion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom it may be best to have recourse&mdash;<br/>
I can't say much for friend or yet relation):<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyers did their utmost for divorce,<br/>
But scarce a fee was paid on either side<br/>
Before, unluckily, Don Jose died.

</p>
<p>
He died: and most unluckily, because,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;According to all hints I could collect<br/>
From counsel learned in those kinds of laws<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Although their talk 's obscure and circumspect),<br/>
His death contrived to spoil a charming cause;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand pities also with respect<br/>
To public feeling, which on this occasion<br/>
Was manifested in a great sensation.

</p>
<p>
But, ah! he died; and buried with him lay<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The public feeling and the lawyers' fees:<br/>
His house was sold, his servants sent away,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A Jew took one of his two mistresses,<br/>
A priest the other&mdash;at least so they say:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask'd the doctors after his disease&mdash;<br/>
He died of the slow fever call'd the tertian,<br/>
And left his widow to her own aversion.

</p>
<p>
Yet Jose was an honourable man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That I must say who knew him very well;<br/>
Therefore his frailties I 'll no further scan<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed there were not many more to tell;<br/>
And if his passions now and then outran<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Discretion, and were not so peaceable<br/>
As Numa's (who was also named Pompilius),<br/>
He had been ill brought up, and was born bilious.

</p>
<p>
Whate'er might be his worthlessness or worth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor fellow! he had many things to wound him.<br/>
Let 's own&mdash;since it can do no good on earth&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a trying moment that which found him<br/>
Standing alone beside his desolate hearth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where all his household gods lay shiver'd round him:<br/>
No choice was left his feelings or his pride,<br/>
Save death or Doctors' Commons&mdash;so he died.

</p>
<p>
Dying intestate, Juan was sole heir<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To a chancery suit, and messuages, and lands,<br/>
Which, with a long minority and care,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Promised to turn out well in proper hands:<br/>
Inez became sole guardian, which was fair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And answer'd but to nature's just demands;<br/>
An only son left with an only mother<br/>
Is brought up much more wisely than another.

</p>
<p>
Sagest of women, even of widows, she<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved that Juan should be quite a paragon,<br/>
And worthy of the noblest pedigree<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(His sire was of Castile, his dam from Aragon):<br/>
Then for accomplishments of chivalry,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In case our lord the king should go to war again,<br/>
He learn'd the arts of riding, fencing, gunnery,<br/>
And how to scale a fortress&mdash;or a nunnery.

</p>
<p>
But that which Donna Inez most desired,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw into herself each day before all<br/>
The learned tutors whom for him she hired,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was, that his breeding should be strictly moral;<br/>
Much into all his studies she inquired,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so they were submitted first to her, all,<br/>
Arts, sciences, no branch was made a mystery<br/>
To Juan's eyes, excepting natural history.

</p>
<p>
The languages, especially the dead,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sciences, and most of all the abstruse,<br/>
The arts, at least all such as could be said<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be the most remote from common use,<br/>
In all these he was much and deeply read;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But not a page of any thing that 's loose,<br/>
Or hints continuation of the species,<br/>
Was ever suffer'd, lest he should grow vicious.

</p>
<p>
His classic studies made a little puzzle,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses,<br/>
Who in the earlier ages raised a bustle,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But never put on pantaloons or bodices;<br/>
His reverend tutors had at times a tussle,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And for their AEneids, Iliads, and Odysseys,<br/>
Were forced to make an odd sort! of apology,<br/>
For Donna Inez dreaded the Mythology.

</p>
<p>
Ovid 's a rake, as half his verses show him,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Anacreon's morals are a still worse sample,<br/>
Catullus scarcely has a decent poem,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think Sappho's Ode a good example,<br/>
Although Longinus tells us there is no hymn<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample:<br/>
But Virgil's songs are pure, except that horrid one<br/>
Beginning with 'Formosum Pastor Corydon.'

</p>
<p>
Lucretius' irreligion is too strong,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For early stomachs, to prove wholesome food;<br/>
I can't help thinking Juvenal was wrong,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although no doubt his real intent was good,<br/>
For speaking out so plainly in his song,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So much indeed as to be downright rude;<br/>
And then what proper person can be partial<br/>
To all those nauseous epigrams of Martial?

</p>
<p>
Juan was taught from out the best edition,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Expurgated by learned men, who place<br/>
Judiciously, from out the schoolboy's vision,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The grosser parts; but, fearful to deface<br/>
Too much their modest bard by this omission,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And pitying sore his mutilated case,<br/>
They only add them all in an appendix,<br/>
Which saves, in fact, the trouble of an index;

</p>
<p>
For there we have them all 'at one fell swoop,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of being scatter'd through the Pages;<br/>
They stand forth marshall'd in a handsome troop,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the ingenuous youth of future ages,<br/>
Till some less rigid editor shall stoop<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To call them back into their separate cages,<br/>
Instead of standing staring all together,<br/>
Like garden gods&mdash;and not so decent either.

</p>
<p>
The Missal too (it was the family Missal)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was ornamented in a sort of way<br/>
Which ancient mass-books often are, and this all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kinds of grotesques illumined; and how they,<br/>
Who saw those figures on the margin kiss all,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could turn their optics to the text and pray,<br/>
Is more than I know<br/>
&mdash;But Don Juan's mother<br/>
Kept this herself, and gave her son another.

</p>
<p>
Sermons he read, and lectures he endured,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And homilies, and lives of all the saints;<br/>
To Jerome and to Chrysostom inured,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not take such studies for restraints;<br/>
But how faith is acquired, and then ensured,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So well not one of the aforesaid paints<br/>
As Saint Augustine in his fine Confessions,<br/>
Which make the reader envy his transgressions.

</p>
<p>
This, too, was a seal'd book to little Juan&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't but say that his mamma was right,<br/>
If such an education was the true one.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She scarcely trusted him from out her sight;<br/>
Her maids were old, and if she took a new one,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You might be sure she was a perfect fright;<br/>
She did this during even her husband's life&mdash;<br/>
I recommend as much to every wife.

</p>
<p>
Young Juan wax'd in goodliness and grace;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At six a charming child, and at eleven<br/>
With all the promise of as fine a face<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As e'er to man's maturer growth was given:<br/>
He studied steadily, and grew apace,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And seem'd, at least, in the right road to heaven,<br/>
For half his days were pass'd at church, the other<br/>
Between his tutors, confessor, and mother.

</p>
<p>
At six, I said, he was a charming child,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At twelve he was a fine, but quiet boy;<br/>
Although in infancy a little wild,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They tamed him down amongst them: to destroy<br/>
His natural spirit not in vain they toil'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least it seem'd so; and his mother's joy<br/>
Was to declare how sage, and still, and steady,<br/>
Her young philosopher was grown already.

</p>
<p>
I had my doubts, perhaps I have them still,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But what I say is neither here nor there:<br/>
I knew his father well, and have some skill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In character&mdash;but it would not be fair<br/>
From sire to son to augur good or ill:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He and his wife were an ill-sorted pair&mdash;<br/>
But scandal 's my aversion<br/>
&mdash;I protest<br/>
Against all evil speaking, even in jest.

</p>
<p>
For my part I say nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;but<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This I will say&mdash;my reasons are my own&mdash;<br/>
That if I had an only son to put<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To school (as God be praised that I have none),<br/>
'T is not with Donna Inez I would shut<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Him up to learn his catechism alone,<br/>
No&mdash;no<br/>
&mdash;I 'd send him out betimes to college,<br/>
For there it was I pick'd up my own knowledge.

</p>
<p>
For there one learns&mdash;'t is not for me to boast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I acquired&mdash;but I pass over that,<br/>
As well as all the Greek I since have lost:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that there 's the place&mdash;but 'Verbum sat.'<br/>
I think I pick'd up too, as well as most,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge of matters&mdash;but no matter what&mdash;<br/>
I never married&mdash;but, I think, I know<br/>
That sons should not be educated so.

</p>
<p>
Young Juan now was sixteen years of age,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tall, handsome, slender, but well knit: he seem'd<br/>
Active, though not so sprightly, as a page;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And everybody but his mother deem'd<br/>
Him almost man; but she flew in a rage<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bit her lips (for else she might have scream'd)<br/>
If any said so, for to be precocious<br/>
Was in her eyes a thing the most atrocious.

</p>
<p>
Amongst her numerous acquaintance, all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected for discretion and devotion,<br/>
There was the Donna Julia, whom to call<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty were but to give a feeble notion<br/>
Of many charms in her as natural<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As sweetness to the flower, or salt to ocean,<br/>
Her zone to Venus, or his bow to Cupid<br/>
(But this last simile is trite and stupid).

</p>
<p>
The darkness of her Oriental eye<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Accorded with her Moorish origin<br/>
(Her blood was not all Spanish, by the by;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Spain, you know, this is a sort of sin);<br/>
When proud Granada fell, and, forced to fly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Boabdil wept, of Donna Julia's kin<br/>
Some went to Africa, some stay'd in Spain,<br/>
Her great-great-grandmamma chose to remain.

</p>
<p>
She married (I forget the pedigree)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With an Hidalgo, who transmitted down<br/>
His blood less noble than such blood should be;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At such alliances his sires would frown,<br/>
In that point so precise in each degree<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That they bred in and in, as might be shown,<br/>
Marrying their cousins&mdash;nay, their aunts, and nieces,<br/>
Which always spoils the breed, if it increases.

</p>
<p>
This heathenish cross restored the breed again,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruin'd its blood, but much improved its flesh;<br/>
For from a root the ugliest in Old Spain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprung up a branch as beautiful as fresh;<br/>
The sons no more were short, the daughters plain:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But there 's a rumour which I fain would hush,<br/>
'T is said that Donna Julia's grandmamma<br/>
Produced her Don more heirs at love than law.

</p>
<p>
However this might be, the race went on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Improving still through every generation,<br/>
Until it centred in an only son,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who left an only daughter; my narration<br/>
May have suggested that this single one<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could be but Julia (whom on this occasion<br/>
I shall have much to speak about), and she<br/>
Was married, charming, chaste, and twenty-three.

</p>
<p>
Her eye (I 'm very fond of handsome eyes)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was large and dark, suppressing half its fire<br/>
Until she spoke, then through its soft disguise<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flash'd an expression more of pride than ire,<br/>
And love than either; and there would arise<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A something in them which was not desire,<br/>
But would have been, perhaps, but for the soul<br/>
Which struggled through and chasten'd down the whole.

</p>
<p>
Her glossy hair was cluster'd o'er a brow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright with intelligence, and fair, and smooth;<br/>
Her eyebrow's shape was like th' aerial bow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her cheek all purple with the beam of youth,<br/>
Mounting at times to a transparent glow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if her veins ran lightning; she, in sooth,<br/>
Possess'd an air and grace by no means common:<br/>
Her stature tall<br/>
&mdash;I hate a dumpy woman.

</p>
<p>
Wedded she was some years, and to a man<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fifty, and such husbands are in plenty;<br/>
And yet, I think, instead of such a <em>ONE<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T </em>were better to have <em>TWO </em>of five-and-twenty,<br/>
Especially in countries near the sun:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I think on 't, 'mi vien in mente,'<br/>
Ladies even of the most uneasy virtue<br/>
Prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty.

</p>
<p>
'T is a sad thing, I cannot choose but say,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the fault of that indecent sun,<br/>
Who cannot leave alone our helpless clay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But will keep baking, broiling, burning on,<br/>
That howsoever people fast and pray,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The flesh is frail, and so the soul undone:<br/>
What men call gallantry, and gods adultery,<br/>
Is much more common where the climate 's sultry.

</p>
<p>
Happy the nations of the moral North!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where all is virtue, and the winter season<br/>
Sends sin, without a rag on, shivering forth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;('T was snow that brought St. Anthony to reason);<br/>
Where juries cast up what a wife is worth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By laying whate'er sum in mulct they please on<br/>
The lover, who must pay a handsome price,<br/>
Because it is a marketable vice.

</p>
<p>
Alfonso was the name of Julia's lord,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A man well looking for his years, and who<br/>
Was neither much beloved nor yet abhorr'd:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They lived together, as most people do,<br/>
Suffering each other's foibles by accord,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And not exactly either one or two;<br/>
Yet he was jealous, though he did not show it,<br/>
For jealousy dislikes the world to know it.

</p>
<p>
Julia was&mdash;yet I never could see why&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With Donna Inez quite a favourite friend;<br/>
Between their tastes there was small sympathy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For not a line had Julia ever penn'd:<br/>
Some people whisper but no doubt they lie,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For malice still imputes some private end,<br/>
That Inez had, ere Don Alfonso's marriage,<br/>
Forgot with him her very prudent carriage;

</p>
<p>
And that still keeping up the old connection,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which time had lately render'd much more chaste,<br/>
She took his lady also in affection,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And certainly this course was much the best:<br/>
She flatter'd Julia with her sage protection,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And complimented Don Alfonso's taste;<br/>
And if she could not (who can?) silence scandal,<br/>
At least she left it a more slender handle.

</p>
<p>
I can't tell whether Julia saw the affair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With other people's eyes, or if her own<br/>
Discoveries made, but none could be aware<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this, at least no symptom e'er was shown;<br/>
Perhaps she did not know, or did not care,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Indifferent from the first or callous grown:<br/>
I 'm really puzzled what to think or say,<br/>
She kept her counsel in so close a way.

</p>
<p>
Juan she saw, and, as a pretty child,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Caress'd him often&mdash;such a thing might be<br/>
Quite innocently done, and harmless styled,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When she had twenty years, and thirteen he;<br/>
But I am not so sure I should have smiled<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was sixteen, Julia twenty-three;<br/>
These few short years make wondrous alterations,<br/>
Particularly amongst sun-burnt nations.

</p>
<p>
Whate'er the cause might be, they had become<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed; for the dame grew distant, the youth shy,<br/>
Their looks cast down, their greetings almost dumb,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And much embarrassment in either eye;<br/>
There surely will be little doubt with some<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That Donna Julia knew the reason why,<br/>
But as for Juan, he had no more notion<br/>
Than he who never saw the sea of ocean.

</p>
<p>
Yet Julia's very coldness still was kind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tremulously gentle her small hand<br/>
Withdrew itself from his, but left behind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland<br/>
And slight, so very slight, that to the mind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was but a doubt; but ne'er magician's wand<br/>
Wrought change with all Armida's fairy art<br/>
Like what this light touch left on Juan's heart.

</p>
<p>
And if she met him, though she smiled no more,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She look'd a sadness sweeter than her smile,<br/>
As if her heart had deeper thoughts in store<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She must not own, but cherish'd more the while<br/>
For that compression in its burning core;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even innocence itself has many a wile,<br/>
And will not dare to trust itself with truth,<br/>
And love is taught hypocrisy from youth.

</p>
<p>
But passion most dissembles, yet betrays<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even by its darkness; as the blackest sky<br/>
Foretells the heaviest tempest, it displays<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its workings through the vainly guarded eye,<br/>
And in whatever aspect it arrays<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Itself, 't is still the same hypocrisy;<br/>
Coldness or anger, even disdain or hate,<br/>
Are masks it often wears, and still too late.

</p>
<p>
Then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft,<br/>
And burning blushes, though for no transgression,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tremblings when met, and restlessness when left;<br/>
All these are little preludes to possession,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of which young passion cannot be bereft,<br/>
And merely tend to show how greatly love is<br/>
Embarrass'd at first starting with a novice.

</p>
<p>
Poor Julia's heart was in an awkward state;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She felt it going, and resolved to make<br/>
The noblest efforts for herself and mate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For honour's, pride's, religion's, virtue's sake;<br/>
Her resolutions were most truly great,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And almost might have made a Tarquin quake:<br/>
She pray'd the Virgin Mary for her grace,<br/>
As being the best judge of a lady's case.

</p>
<p>
She vow'd she never would see Juan more,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And next day paid a visit to his mother,<br/>
And look'd extremely at the opening door,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, by the Virgin's grace, let in another;<br/>
Grateful she was, and yet a little sore&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Again it opens, it can be no other,<br/>
'T is surely Juan now<br/>
&mdash;No! I 'm afraid<br/>
That night the Virgin was no further pray'd.

</p>
<p>
She now determined that a virtuous woman<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should rather face and overcome temptation,<br/>
That flight was base and dastardly, and no man<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should ever give her heart the least sensation;<br/>
That is to say, a thought beyond the common<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Preference, that we must feel upon occasion<br/>
For people who are pleasanter than others,<br/>
But then they only seem so many brothers.

</p>
<p>
And even if by chance&mdash;and who can tell?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil 's so very sly&mdash;she should discover<br/>
That all within was not so very well,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if still free, that such or such a lover<br/>
Might please perhaps, a virtuous wife can quell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such thoughts, and be the better when they 're over;<br/>
And if the man should ask, 't is but denial:<br/>
I recommend young ladies to make trial.

</p>
<p>
And then there are such things as love divine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright and immaculate, unmix'd and pure,<br/>
Such as the angels think so very fine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And matrons who would be no less secure,<br/>
Platonic, perfect, 'just such love as mine;'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus Julia said&mdash;and thought so, to be sure;<br/>
And so I 'd have her think, were I the man<br/>
On whom her reveries celestial ran.

</p>
<p>
Such love is innocent, and may exist<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Between young persons without any danger.<br/>
A hand may first, and then a lip be kist;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part, to such doings I 'm a stranger,<br/>
But hear these freedoms form the utmost list<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all o'er which such love may be a ranger:<br/>
If people go beyond, 't is quite a crime,<br/>
But not my fault<br/>
&mdash;I tell them all in time.

</p>
<p>
Love, then, but love within its proper limits,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Julia's innocent determination<br/>
In young Don Juan's favour, and to him its<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Exertion might be useful on occasion;<br/>
And, lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethereal lustre, with what sweet persuasion<br/>
He might be taught, by love and her together&mdash;<br/>
I really don't know what, nor Julia either.

</p>
<p>
Fraught with this fine intention, and well fenced<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In mail of proof&mdash;her purity of soul&mdash;<br/>
She, for the future of her strength convinced.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that her honour was a rock, or mole,<br/>
Exceeding sagely from that hour dispensed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With any kind of troublesome control;<br/>
But whether Julia to the task was equal<br/>
Is that which must be mention'd in the sequel.

</p>
<p>
Her plan she deem'd both innocent and feasible,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, surely, with a stripling of sixteen<br/>
Not scandal's fangs could fix on much that 's seizable,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or if they did so, satisfied to mean<br/>
Nothing but what was good, her breast was peaceable&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A quiet conscience makes one so serene!<br/>
Christians have burnt each other, quite persuaded<br/>
That all the Apostles would have done as they did.

</p>
<p>
And if in the mean time her husband died,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Heaven forbid that such a thought should cross<br/>
Her brain, though in a dream! (and then she sigh'd)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Never could she survive that common loss;<br/>
But just suppose that moment should betide,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I only say suppose it&mdash;inter nos.<br/>
(This should be entre nous, for Julia thought<br/>
In French, but then the rhyme would go for naught.)

</p>
<p>
I only say suppose this supposition:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan being then grown up to man's estate<br/>
Would fully suit a widow of condition,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even seven years hence it would not be too late;<br/>
And in the interim (to pursue this vision)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The mischief, after all, could not be great,<br/>
For he would learn the rudiments of love,<br/>
I mean the seraph way of those above.

</p>
<p>
So much for Julia. Now we 'll turn to Juan.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor little fellow! he had no idea<br/>
Of his own case, and never hit the true one;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In feelings quick as Ovid's Miss Medea,<br/>
He puzzled over what he found a new one,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But not as yet imagined it could be<br/>
Thing quite in course, and not at all alarming,<br/>
Which, with a little patience, might grow charming.

</p>
<p>
Silent and pensive, idle, restless, slow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His home deserted for the lonely wood,<br/>
Tormented with a wound he could not know,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His, like all deep grief, plunged in solitude:<br/>
I 'm fond myself of solitude or so,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, I beg it may be understood,<br/>
By solitude I mean a sultan's, not<br/>
A hermit's, with a haram for a grot.

</p>
<p>
'Oh Love! in such a wilderness as this,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where transport and security entwine,<br/>
Here is the empire of thy perfect bliss,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And here thou art a god indeed divine.'<br/>
The bard I quote from does not sing amiss,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the exception of the second line,<br/>
For that same twining 'transport and security'<br/>
Are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity.

</p>
<p>
The poet meant, no doubt, and thus appeals<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the good sense and senses of mankind,<br/>
The very thing which every body feels,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As all have found on trial, or may find,<br/>
That no one likes to be disturb'd at meals<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or love.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;I won't say more about 'entwined'<br/>
Or 'transport,' as we knew all that before,<br/>
But beg 'Security' will bolt the door.

</p>
<p>
Young Juan wander'd by the glassy brooks,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking unutterable things; he threw<br/>
Himself at length within the leafy nooks<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the wild branch of the cork forest grew;<br/>
There poets find materials for their books,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And every now and then we read them through,<br/>
So that their plan and prosody are eligible,<br/>
Unless, like Wordsworth, they prove unintelligible.

</p>
<p>
He, Juan (and not Wordsworth), so pursued<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His self-communion with his own high soul,<br/>
Until his mighty heart, in its great mood,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had mitigated part, though not the whole<br/>
Of its disease; he did the best he could<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With things not very subject to control,

</p>
<p>
And turn'd, without perceiving his condition,<br/>
Like Coleridge, into a metaphysician.

</p>
<p>
He thought about himself, and the whole earth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of man the wonderful, and of the stars,<br/>
And how the deuce they ever could have birth;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he thought of earthquakes, and of wars,<br/>
How many miles the moon might have in girth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of air-balloons, and of the many bars<br/>
To perfect knowledge of the boundless skies;&mdash;<br/>
And then he thought of Donna Julia's eyes.

</p>
<p>
In thoughts like these true wisdom may discern<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Longings sublime, and aspirations high,<br/>
Which some are born with, but the most part learn<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To plague themselves withal, they know not why:<br/>
'T was strange that one so young should thus concern<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His brain about the action of the sky;<br/>
If you think 't was philosophy that this did,<br/>
I can't help thinking puberty assisted.

</p>
<p>
He pored upon the leaves, and on the flowers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And heard a voice in all the winds; and then<br/>
He thought of wood-nymphs and immortal bowers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And how the goddesses came down to men:<br/>
He miss'd the pathway, he forgot the hours,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he look'd upon his watch again,<br/>
He found how much old Time had been a winner&mdash;<br/>
He also found that he had lost his dinner.

</p>
<p>
Sometimes he turn'd to gaze upon his book,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Boscan, or Garcilasso;&mdash;by the wind<br/>
Even as the page is rustled while we look,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So by the poesy of his own mind<br/>
Over the mystic leaf his soul was shook,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if 't were one whereon magicians bind<br/>
Their spells, and give them to the passing gale,<br/>
According to some good old woman's tale.

</p>
<p>
Thus would he while his lonely hours away<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissatisfied, nor knowing what he wanted;<br/>
Nor glowing reverie, nor poet's lay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could yield his spirit that for which it panted,<br/>
A bosom whereon he his head might lay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear the heart beat with the love it granted,<br/>
With&mdash;several other things, which I forget,<br/>
Or which, at least, I need not mention yet.

</p>
<p>
Those lonely walks, and lengthening reveries,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not escape the gentle Julia's eyes;<br/>
She saw that Juan was not at his ease;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But that which chiefly may, and must surprise,<br/>
Is, that the Donna Inez did not tease<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her only son with question or surmise:<br/>
Whether it was she did not see, or would not,<br/>
Or, like all very clever people, could not.

</p>
<p>
This may seem strange, but yet 't is very common;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance&mdash;gentlemen, whose ladies take<br/>
Leave to o'erstep the written rights of woman,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And break the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Which commandment is 't they break?<br/>
(I have forgot the number, and think no man<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should rashly quote, for fear of a mistake.)<br/>
I say, when these same gentlemen are jealous,<br/>
They make some blunder, which their ladies tell us.

</p>
<p>
A real husband always is suspicious,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But still no less suspects in the wrong place,<br/>
Jealous of some one who had no such wishes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or pandering blindly to his own disgrace,<br/>
By harbouring some dear friend extremely vicious;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The last indeed 's infallibly the case:<br/>
And when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly,<br/>
He wonders at their vice, and not his folly.

</p>
<p>
Thus parents also are at times short-sighted;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though watchful as the lynx, they ne'er discover,<br/>
The while the wicked world beholds delighted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Hopeful's mistress, or Miss Fanny's lover,<br/>
Till some confounded escapade has blighted<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan of twenty years, and all is over;<br/>
And then the mother cries, the father swears,<br/>
And wonders why the devil he got heirs.

</p>
<p>
But Inez was so anxious, and so clear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sight, that I must think, on this occasion,<br/>
She had some other motive much more near<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For leaving Juan to this new temptation;<br/>
But what that motive was, I sha'n't say here;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps to finish Juan's education,<br/>
Perhaps to open Don Alfonso's eyes,<br/>
In case he thought his wife too great a prize.

</p>
<p>
It was upon a day, a summer's day;-<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer's indeed a very dangerous season,<br/>
And so is spring about the end of May;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun, no doubt, is the prevailing reason;<br/>
But whatsoe'er the cause is, one may say,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And stand convicted of more truth than treason,<br/>
That there are months which nature grows more merry in,&mdash;<br/>
March has its hares, and May must have its heroine.

</p>
<p>
'T was on a summer's day&mdash;the sixth of June:&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to be particular in dates,<br/>
Not only of the age, and year, but moon;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They are a sort of post-house, where the Fates<br/>
Change horses, making history change its tune,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then spur away o'er empires and o'er states,<br/>
Leaving at last not much besides chronology,<br/>
Excepting the post-obits of theology.

</p>
<p>
'T was on the sixth of June, about the hour<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of half-past six&mdash;perhaps still nearer seven&mdash;<br/>
When Julia sate within as pretty a bower<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As e'er held houri in that heathenish heaven<br/>
Described by Mahomet, and Anacreon Moore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom the lyre and laurels have been given,<br/>
With all the trophies of triumphant song&mdash;<br/>
He won them well, and may he wear them long!

</p>
<p>
She sate, but not alone; I know not well<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How this same interview had taken place,<br/>
And even if I knew, I should not tell&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;People should hold their tongues in any case;<br/>
No matter how or why the thing befell,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But there were she and Juan, face to face&mdash;<br/>
When two such faces are so, 't would be wise,<br/>
But very difficult, to shut their eyes.

</p>
<p>
How beautiful she look'd! her conscious heart<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Glow'd in her cheek, and yet she felt no wrong.<br/>
O Love! how perfect is thy mystic art,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthening the weak, and trampling on the strong,<br/>
How self-deceitful is the sagest part<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mortals whom thy lure hath led along&mdash;<br/>
The precipice she stood on was immense,<br/>
So was her creed in her own innocence.

</p>
<p>
She thought of her own strength, and Juan's youth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And of the folly of all prudish fears,<br/>
Victorious virtue, and domestic truth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then of Don Alfonso's fifty years:<br/>
I wish these last had not occurr'd, in sooth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that number rarely much endears,<br/>
And through all climes, the snowy and the sunny,<br/>
Sounds ill in love, whate'er it may in money.

</p>
<p>
When people say, 'I've told you fifty times,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They mean to scold, and very often do;<br/>
When poets say, 'I've written fifty rhymes,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They make you dread that they 'll recite them too;<br/>
In gangs of fifty, thieves commit their crimes;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At fifty love for love is rare, 't is true,<br/>
But then, no doubt, it equally as true is,<br/>
A good deal may be bought for fifty Louis.

</p>
<p>
Julia had honour, virtue, truth, and love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For Don Alfonso; and she inly swore,<br/>
By all the vows below to powers above,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She never would disgrace the ring she wore,<br/>
Nor leave a wish which wisdom might reprove;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And while she ponder'd this, besides much more,<br/>
One hand on Juan's carelessly was thrown,<br/>
Quite by mistake&mdash;she thought it was her own;

</p>
<p>
Unconsciously she lean'd upon the other,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which play'd within the tangles of her hair:<br/>
And to contend with thoughts she could not smother<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She seem'd by the distraction of her air.<br/>
'T was surely very wrong in Juan's mother<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave together this imprudent pair,<br/>
She who for many years had watch'd her son so&mdash;<br/>
I 'm very certain mine would not have done so.

</p>
<p>
The hand which still held Juan's, by degrees<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently, but palpably confirm'd its grasp,<br/>
As if it said, 'Detain me, if you please;'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet there 's no doubt she only meant to clasp<br/>
His fingers with a pure Platonic squeeze:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She would have shrunk as from a toad, or asp,<br/>
Had she imagined such a thing could rouse<br/>
A feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse.

</p>
<p>
I cannot know what Juan thought of this,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he did, is much what you would do;<br/>
His young lip thank'd it with a grateful kiss,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, abash'd at its own joy, withdrew<br/>
In deep despair, lest he had done amiss,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Love is so very timid when 't is new:<br/>
She blush'd, and frown'd not, but she strove to speak,<br/>
And held her tongue, her voice was grown so weak.

</p>
<p>
The sun set, and up rose the yellow moon:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil 's in the moon for mischief; they<br/>
Who call'd her <em>CHASTE, </em>methinks, began too soon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their nomenclature; there is not a day,<br/>
The longest, not the twenty-first of June,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sees half the business in a wicked way<br/>
On which three single hours of moonshine smile&mdash;<br/>
And then she looks so modest all the while.

</p>
<p>
There is a dangerous silence in that hour,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A stillness, which leaves room for the full soul<br/>
To open all itself, without the power<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of calling wholly back its self-control;<br/>
The silver light which, hallowing tree and tower,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheds beauty and deep softness o'er the whole,<br/>
Breathes also to the heart, and o'er it throws<br/>
A loving languor, which is not repose.

</p>
<p>
And Julia sate with Juan, half embraced<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And half retiring from the glowing arm,<br/>
Which trembled like the bosom where 't was placed;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet still she must have thought there was no harm,<br/>
Or else 't were easy to withdraw her waist;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But then the situation had its charm,<br/>
And then&mdash;God knows what next<br/>
&mdash;I can't go on;<br/>
I 'm almost sorry that I e'er begun.

</p>
<p>
O Plato! Plato! you have paved the way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With your confounded fantasies, to more<br/>
Immoral conduct by the fancied sway<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your system feigns o'er the controulless core<br/>
Of human hearts, than all the long array<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of poets and romancers:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;You 're a bore,<br/>
A charlatan, a coxcomb&mdash;and have been,<br/>
At best, no better than a go-between.

</p>
<p>
And Julia's voice was lost, except in sighs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until too late for useful conversation;<br/>
The tears were gushing from her gentle eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish indeed they had not had occasion,<br/>
But who, alas! can love, and then be wise?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that remorse did not oppose temptation;<br/>
A little still she strove, and much repented<br/>
And whispering 'I will ne'er consent'&mdash;consented.

</p>
<p>
'T is said that Xerxes offer'd a reward<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who could invent him a new pleasure:<br/>
Methinks the requisition 's rather hard,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And must have cost his majesty a treasure:<br/>
For my part, I 'm a moderate-minded bard,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fond of a little love (which I call leisure);<br/>
I care not for new pleasures, as the old<br/>
Are quite enough for me, so they but hold.

</p>
<p>
O Pleasure! you are indeed a pleasant thing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although one must be damn'd for you, no doubt:<br/>
I make a resolution every spring<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of reformation, ere the year run out,<br/>
But somehow, this my vestal vow takes wing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet still, I trust it may be kept throughout:<br/>
I 'm very sorry, very much ashamed,<br/>
And mean, next winter, to be quite reclaim'd.

</p>
<p>
Here my chaste Muse a liberty must take&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Start not! still chaster reader&mdash;she 'll be nice hence&mdash;<br/>
Forward, and there is no great cause to quake;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This liberty is a poetic licence,<br/>
Which some irregularity may make<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the design, and as I have a high sense<br/>
Of Aristotle and the Rules, 't is fit<br/>
To beg his pardon when I err a bit.

</p>
<p>
This licence is to hope the reader will<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose from June the sixth (the fatal day,<br/>
Without whose epoch my poetic skill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For want of facts would all be thrown away),<br/>
But keeping Julia and Don Juan still<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In sight, that several months have pass'd; we 'll say<br/>
'T was in November, but I 'm not so sure<br/>
About the day&mdash;the era 's more obscure.

</p>
<p>
We 'll talk of that anon.&mdash;'T is sweet to hear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At midnight on the blue and moonlit deep<br/>
The song and oar of Adria's gondolier,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By distance mellow'd, o'er the waters sweep;<br/>
'T is sweet to see the evening star appear;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is sweet to listen as the night-winds creep<br/>
From leaf to leaf; 't is sweet to view on high<br/>
The rainbow, based on ocean, span the sky.

</p>
<p>
'T is sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bay deep-mouth'd welcome as we draw near home;<br/>
'T is sweet to know there is an eye will mark<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coming, and look brighter when we come;<br/>
'T is sweet to be awaken'd by the lark,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or lull'd by falling waters; sweet the hum<br/>
Of bees, the voice of girls, the song of birds,<br/>
The lisp of children, and their earliest words.

</p>
<p>
Sweet is the vintage, when the showering grapes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Bacchanal profusion reel to earth,<br/>
Purple and gushing: sweet are our escapes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From civic revelry to rural mirth;<br/>
Sweet to the miser are his glittering heaps,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet to the father is his first-born's birth,<br/>
Sweet is revenge&mdash;especially to women,<br/>
Pillage to soldiers, prize-money to seamen.

</p>
<p>
Sweet is a legacy, and passing sweet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The unexpected death of some old lady<br/>
Or gentleman of seventy years complete,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who 've made 'us youth' wait too&mdash;too long already<br/>
For an estate, or cash, or country seat,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still breaking, but with stamina so steady<br/>
That all the Israelites are fit to mob its<br/>
Next owner for their double-damn'd post-obits.

</p>
<p>
'T is sweet to win, no matter how, one's laurels,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By blood or ink; 't is sweet to put an end<br/>
To strife; 't is sometimes sweet to have our quarrels,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Particularly with a tiresome friend:<br/>
Sweet is old wine in bottles, ale in barrels;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear is the helpless creature we defend<br/>
Against the world; and dear the schoolboy spot<br/>
We ne'er forget, though there we are forgot.

</p>
<p>
But sweeter still than this, than these, than all,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is first and passionate love&mdash;it stands alone,<br/>
Like Adam's recollection of his fall;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree of knowledge has been pluck'd&mdash;all 's known&mdash;<br/>
And life yields nothing further to recall<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Worthy of this ambrosial sin, so shown,<br/>
No doubt in fable, as the unforgiven<br/>
Fire which Prometheus filch'd for us from heaven.

</p>
<p>
Man 's a strange animal, and makes strange use<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his own nature, and the various arts,<br/>
And likes particularly to produce<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some new experiment to show his parts;<br/>
This is the age of oddities let loose,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where different talents find their different marts;<br/>
You 'd best begin with truth, and when you 've lost your<br/>
Labour, there 's a sure market for imposture.

</p>
<p>
What opposite discoveries we have seen!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Signs of true genius, and of empty pockets.)<br/>
One makes new noses, one a guillotine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One breaks your bones, one sets them in their sockets;<br/>
But vaccination certainly has been<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A kind antithesis to Congreve's rockets,<br/>
With which the Doctor paid off an old pox,<br/>
By borrowing a new one from an ox.

</p>
<p>
Bread has been made (indifferent) from potatoes;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And galvanism has set some corpses grinning,<br/>
But has not answer'd like the apparatus<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Humane Society's beginning<br/>
By which men are unsuffocated gratis:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What wondrous new machines have late been spinning!<br/>
I said the small-pox has gone out of late;<br/>
Perhaps it may be follow'd by the great.

</p>
<p>
'T is said the great came from America;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it may set out on its return,&mdash;<br/>
The population there so spreads, they say<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is grown high time to thin it in its turn,<br/>
With war, or plague, or famine, any way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So that civilisation they may learn;<br/>
And which in ravage the more loathsome evil is&mdash;<br/>
Their real lues, or our pseudo-syphilis?

</p>
<p>
This is the patent-age of new inventions<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For killing bodies, and for saving souls,<br/>
All propagated with the best intentions;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Humphry Davy's lantern, by which coals<br/>
Are safely mined for in the mode he mentions,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tombuctoo travels, voyages to the Poles,<br/>
Are ways to benefit mankind, as true,<br/>
Perhaps, as shooting them at Waterloo.

</p>
<p>
Man 's a phenomenon, one knows not what,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wonderful beyond all wondrous measure;<br/>
'T is pity though, in this sublime world, that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasure 's a sin, and sometimes sin 's a pleasure;<br/>
Few mortals know what end they would be at,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But whether glory, power, or love, or treasure,<br/>
The path is through perplexing ways, and when<br/>
The goal is gain'd, we die, you know&mdash;and then&mdash;

</p>
<p>
What then?<br/>
&mdash;I do not know, no more do you&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so good night.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Return we to our story:<br/>
'T was in November, when fine days are few,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the far mountains wax a little hoary,<br/>
And clap a white cape on their mantles blue;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sea dashes round the promontory,<br/>
And the loud breaker boils against the rock,<br/>
And sober suns must set at five o'clock.

</p>
<p>
'T was, as the watchmen say, a cloudy night;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No moon, no stars, the wind was low or loud<br/>
By gusts, and many a sparkling hearth was bright<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the piled wood, round which the family crowd;<br/>
There 's something cheerful in that sort of light,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as a summer sky 's without a cloud:<br/>
I 'm fond of fire, and crickets, and all that,<br/>
A lobster salad, and champagne, and chat.

</p>
<p>
'T was midnight<br/>
&mdash;Donna Julia was in bed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleeping, most probably,&mdash;when at her door<br/>
Arose a clatter might awake the dead,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If they had never been awoke before,<br/>
And that they have been so we all have read,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And are to be so, at the least, once more;&mdash;<br/>
The door was fasten'd, but with voice and fist<br/>
First knocks were heard, then 'Madam<br/>
&mdash;Madam&mdash;hist!

</p>
<p>
'For God's sake, Madam<br/>
&mdash;Madam&mdash;here 's my master,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With more than half the city at his back&mdash;<br/>
Was ever heard of such a curst disaster!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is not my fault&mdash;I kept good watch<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Alack!<br/>
Do pray undo the bolt a little faster&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They 're on the stair just now, and in a crack<br/>
Will all be here; perhaps he yet may fly&mdash;<br/>
Surely the window 's not so very high!'

</p>
<p>
By this time Don Alfonso was arrived,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With torches, friends, and servants in great number;<br/>
The major part of them had long been wived,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore paused not to disturb the slumber<br/>
Of any wicked woman, who contrived<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By stealth her husband's temples to encumber:<br/>
Examples of this kind are so contagious,<br/>
Were one not punish'd, all would be outrageous.

</p>
<p>
I can't tell how, or why, or what suspicion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could enter into Don Alfonso's head;<br/>
But for a cavalier of his condition<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It surely was exceedingly ill-bred,<br/>
Without a word of previous admonition,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To hold a levee round his lady's bed,<br/>
And summon lackeys, arm'd with fire and sword,<br/>
To prove himself the thing he most abhorr'd.

</p>
<p>
Poor Donna Julia, starting as from sleep<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mind&mdash;that I do not say&mdash;she had not slept),<br/>
Began at once to scream, and yawn, and weep;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her maid Antonia, who was an adept,<br/>
Contrived to fling the bed-clothes in a heap,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if she had just now from out them crept:<br/>
I can't tell why she should take all this trouble<br/>
To prove her mistress had been sleeping double.

</p>
<p>
But Julia mistress, and Antonia maid,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Appear'd like two poor harmless women, who<br/>
Of goblins, but still more of men afraid,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had thought one man might be deterr'd by two,<br/>
And therefore side by side were gently laid,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the hours of absence should run through,<br/>
And truant husband should return, and say,<br/>
'My dear, I was the first who came away.'

</p>
<p>
Now Julia found at length a voice, and cried,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'In heaven's name, Don Alfonso, what d' ye mean?<br/>
Has madness seized you? would that I had died<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere such a monster's victim I had been!<br/>
What may this midnight violence betide,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden fit of drunkenness or spleen?<br/>
Dare you suspect me, whom the thought would kill?<br/>
Search, then, the room!'<br/>
&mdash;Alfonso said, 'I will.'

</p>
<p>
He search'd, they search'd, and rummaged everywhere,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Closet and clothes' press, chest and window-seat,<br/>
And found much linen, lace, and several pair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of stockings, slippers, brushes, combs, complete,<br/>
With other articles of ladies fair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep them beautiful, or leave them neat:<br/>
Arras they prick'd and curtains with their swords,<br/>
And wounded several shutters, and some boards.

</p>
<p>
Under the bed they search'd, and there they found&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what&mdash;it was not that they sought;<br/>
They open'd windows, gazing if the ground<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had signs or footmarks, but the earth said nought;<br/>
And then they stared each other's faces round:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is odd, not one of all these seekers thought,<br/>
And seems to me almost a sort of blunder,<br/>
Of looking in the bed as well as under.

</p>
<p>
During this inquisition, Julia's tongue<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was not asleep&mdash;'Yes, search and search,' she cried,<br/>
'Insult on insult heap, and wrong on wrong!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was for this that I became a bride!<br/>
For this in silence I have suffer'd long<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A husband like Alfonso at my side;<br/>
But now I 'll bear no more, nor here remain,<br/>
If there be law or lawyers in all Spain.

</p>
<p>
'Yes, Don Alfonso! husband now no more,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If ever you indeed deserved the name,<br/>
Is 't worthy of your years?&mdash;you have threescore&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty, or sixty, it is all the same&mdash;<br/>
Is 't wise or fitting, causeless to explore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For facts against a virtuous woman's fame?<br/>
Ungrateful, perjured, barbarous Don Alfonso,<br/>
How dare you think your lady would go on so?

</p>
<p>
'Is it for this I have disdain'd to hold<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The common privileges of my sex?<br/>
That I have chosen a confessor so old<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And deaf, that any other it would vex,<br/>
And never once he has had cause to scold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But found my very innocence perplex<br/>
So much, he always doubted I was married&mdash;<br/>
How sorry you will be when I 've miscarried!

</p>
<p>
'Was it for this that no Cortejo e'er<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I yet have chosen from out the youth of Seville?<br/>
Is it for this I scarce went anywhere,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Except to bull-fights, mass, play, rout, and revel?<br/>
Is it for this, whate'er my suitors were,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I favor'd none&mdash;nay, was almost uncivil?<br/>
Is it for this that General Count O'Reilly,<br/>
Who took Algiers, declares I used him vilely?

</p>
<p>
'Did not the Italian Musico Cazzani<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing at my heart six months at least in vain?<br/>
Did not his countryman, Count Corniani,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Call me the only virtuous wife in Spain?<br/>
Were there not also Russians, English, many?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count Strongstroganoff I put in pain,<br/>
And Lord Mount Coffeehouse, the Irish peer,<br/>
Who kill'd himself for love (with wine) last year.

</p>
<p>
'Have I not had two bishops at my feet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Ichar, and Don Fernan Nunez?<br/>
And is it thus a faithful wife you treat?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder in what quarter now the moon is:<br/>
I praise your vast forbearance not to beat<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Me also, since the time so opportune is&mdash;<br/>
O, valiant man! with sword drawn and cock'd trigger,<br/>
Now, tell me, don't you cut a pretty figure?

</p>
<p>
'Was it for this you took your sudden journey.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Under pretence of business indispensable<br/>
With that sublime of rascals your attorney,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom I see standing there, and looking sensible<br/>
Of having play'd the fool? though both I spurn, he<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Deserves the worst, his conduct 's less defensible,<br/>
Because, no doubt, 't was for his dirty fee,<br/>
And not from any love to you nor me.

</p>
<p>
'If he comes here to take a deposition,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By all means let the gentleman proceed;<br/>
You 've made the apartment in a fit condition:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There 's pen and ink for you, sir, when you need&mdash;<br/>
Let every thing be noted with precision,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not you for nothing should be fee'd&mdash;<br/>
But, as my maid 's undrest, pray turn your spies out.'<br/>
'Oh!' sobb'd Antonia, 'I could tear their eyes out.'

</p>
<p>
'There is the closet, there the toilet, there<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The antechamber&mdash;search them under, over;<br/>
There is the sofa, there the great arm-chair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The chimney&mdash;which would really hold a lover.<br/>
I wish to sleep, and beg you will take care<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And make no further noise, till you discover<br/>
The secret cavern of this lurking treasure&mdash;<br/>
And when 't is found, let me, too, have that pleasure.

</p>
<p>
'And now, Hidalgo! now that you have thrown<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubt upon me, confusion over all,<br/>
Pray have the courtesy to make it known<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is the man you search for? how d' ye cal<br/>
Him? what 's his lineage? let him but be shown&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope he 's young and handsome&mdash;is he tall?<br/>
Tell me&mdash;and be assured, that since you stain<br/>
My honour thus, it shall not be in vain.

</p>
<p>
'At least, perhaps, he has not sixty years,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At that age he would be too old for slaughter,<br/>
Or for so young a husband's jealous fears<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Antonia! let me have a glass of water).<br/>
I am ashamed of having shed these tears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They are unworthy of my father's daughter;<br/>
My mother dream'd not in my natal hour<br/>
That I should fall into a monster's power.

</p>
<p>
'Perhaps 't is of Antonia you are jealous,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You saw that she was sleeping by my side<br/>
When you broke in upon us with your fellows:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look where you please&mdash;we 've nothing, sir, to hide;<br/>
Only another time, I trust, you 'll tell us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or for the sake of decency abide<br/>
A moment at the door, that we may be<br/>
Drest to receive so much good company.

</p>
<p>
'And now, sir, I have done, and say no more;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The little I have said may serve to show<br/>
The guileless heart in silence may grieve o'er<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrongs to whose exposure it is slow:<br/>
I leave you to your conscience as before,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T will one day ask you why you used me so?<br/>
God grant you feel not then the bitterest grief!-<br/>
Antonia! where 's my pocket-handkerchief?'

</p>
<p>
She ceased, and turn'd upon her pillow; pale<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She lay, her dark eyes flashing through their tears,<br/>
Like skies that rain and lighten; as a veil,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Waved and o'ershading her wan cheek, appears<br/>
Her streaming hair; the black curls strive, but fail,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To hide the glossy shoulder, which uprears<br/>
Its snow through all;&mdash;her soft lips lie apart,<br/>
And louder than her breathing beats her heart.

</p>
<p>
The Senhor Don Alfonso stood confused;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Antonia bustled round the ransack'd room,<br/>
And, turning up her nose, with looks abused<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her master and his myrmidons, of whom<br/>
Not one, except the attorney, was amused;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb,<br/>
So there were quarrels, cared not for the cause,<br/>
Knowing they must be settled by the laws.

</p>
<p>
With prying snub-nose, and small eyes, he stood,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Following Antonia's motions here and there,<br/>
With much suspicion in his attitude;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For reputations he had little care;<br/>
So that a suit or action were made good,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Small pity had he for the young and fair,<br/>
And ne'er believed in negatives, till these<br/>
Were proved by competent false witnesses.

</p>
<p>
But Don Alfonso stood with downcast looks,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, truth to say, he made a foolish figure;<br/>
When, after searching in five hundred nooks,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And treating a young wife with so much rigour,<br/>
He gain'd no point, except some self-rebukes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Added to those his lady with such vigour<br/>
Had pour'd upon him for the last half-hour,<br/>
Quick, thick, and heavy&mdash;as a thunder-shower.

</p>
<p>
At first he tried to hammer an excuse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To which the sole reply was tears and sobs,<br/>
And indications of hysterics, whose<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Prologue is always certain throes, and throbs,<br/>
Gasps, and whatever else the owners choose:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alfonso saw his wife, and thought of Job's;<br/>
He saw too, in perspective, her relations,<br/>
And then he tried to muster all his patience.

</p>
<p>
He stood in act to speak, or rather stammer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But sage Antonia cut him short before<br/>
The anvil of his speech received the hammer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With 'Pray, sir, leave the room, and say no more,<br/>
Or madam dies.'<br/>
&mdash;Alfonso mutter'd, '<em>D&mdash;</em>n her,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But nothing else, the time of words was o'er;<br/>
He cast a rueful look or two, and did,<br/>
He knew not wherefore, that which he was bid.

</p>
<p>
With him retired his 'posse comitatus,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The attorney last, who linger'd near the door<br/>
Reluctantly, still tarrying there as late as<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Antonia let him&mdash;not a little sore<br/>
At this most strange and unexplain'd 'hiatus'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Don Alfonso's facts, which just now wore<br/>
An awkward look; as he revolved the case,<br/>
The door was fasten'd in his legal face.

</p>
<p>
No sooner was it bolted, than<br/>
&mdash;Oh shame!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O sin! Oh sorrow! and oh womankind!<br/>
How can you do such things and keep your fame,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless this world, and t' other too, be blind?<br/>
Nothing so dear as an unfilch'd good name!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But to proceed&mdash;for there is more behind:<br/>
With much heartfelt reluctance be it said,<br/>
Young Juan slipp'd half-smother'd, from the bed.

</p>
<p>
He had been hid<br/>
&mdash;I don't pretend to say<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How, nor can I indeed describe the where&mdash;<br/>
Young, slender, and pack'd easily, he lay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, in little compass, round or square;<br/>
But pity him I neither must nor may<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His suffocation by that pretty pair;<br/>
'T were better, sure, to die so, than be shut<br/>
With maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.

</p>
<p>
And, secondly, I pity not, because<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He had no business to commit a sin,<br/>
Forbid by heavenly, fined by human laws,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least 't was rather early to begin;<br/>
But at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So much as when we call our old debts in<br/>
At sixty years, and draw the accompts of evil,<br/>
And find a deuced balance with the devil.

</p>
<p>
Of his position I can give no notion:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is written in the Hebrew Chronicle,<br/>
How the physicians, leaving pill and potion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Prescribed, by way of blister, a young belle,<br/>
When old King David's blood grew dull in motion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that the medicine answer'd very well;<br/>
Perhaps 't was in a different way applied,<br/>
For David lived, but Juan nearly died.

</p>
<p>
What 's to be done? Alfonso will be back<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment he has sent his fools away.<br/>
Antonia's skill was put upon the rack,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But no device could be brought into play&mdash;<br/>
And how to parry the renew'd attack?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, it wanted but few hours of day:<br/>
Antonia puzzled; Julia did not speak,<br/>
But press'd her bloodless lip to Juan's cheek.

</p>
<p>
He turn'd his lip to hers, and with his hand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Call'd back the tangles of her wandering hair;<br/>
Even then their love they could not all command,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And half forgot their danger and despair:<br/>
Antonia's patience now was at a stand&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Come, come, 't is no time now for fooling there,'<br/>
She whisper'd, in great wrath&mdash;'I must deposit<br/>
This pretty gentleman within the closet:

</p>
<p>
'Pray, keep your nonsense for some luckier night&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can have put my master in this mood?<br/>
What will become on 't<br/>
&mdash;I 'm in such a fright,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil 's in the urchin, and no good&mdash;<br/>
Is this a time for giggling? this a plight?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, don't you know that it may end in blood?<br/>
You 'll lose your life, and I shall lose my place,<br/>
My mistress all, for that half-girlish face.

</p>
<p>
'Had it but been for a stout cavalier<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of twenty-five or thirty (come, make haste)&mdash;<br/>
But for a child, what piece of work is here!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I really, madam, wonder at your taste<br/>
(Come, sir, get in)&mdash;my master must be near:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There, for the present, at the least, he's fast,<br/>
And if we can but till the morning keep<br/>
Our counsel&mdash;(Juan, mind, you must not sleep).'

</p>
<p>
Now, Don Alfonso entering, but alone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed the oration of the trusty maid:<br/>
She loiter'd, and he told her to be gone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An order somewhat sullenly obey'd;<br/>
However, present remedy was none,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And no great good seem'd answer'd if she stay'd:<br/>
Regarding both with slow and sidelong view,<br/>
She snuff'd the candle, curtsied, and withdrew.

</p>
<p>
Alfonso paused a minute&mdash;then begun<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some strange excuses for his late proceeding;<br/>
He would not justify what he had done,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To say the best, it was extreme ill-breeding;<br/>
But there were ample reasons for it, none<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of which he specified in this his pleading:<br/>
His speech was a fine sample, on the whole,<br/>
Of rhetoric, which the learn'd call 'rigmarole.'

</p>
<p>
Julia said nought; though all the while there rose<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A ready answer, which at once enables<br/>
A matron, who her husband's foible knows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By a few timely words to turn the tables,<br/>
Which, if it does not silence, still must pose,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it should comprise a pack of fables;<br/>
'T is to retort with firmness, and when he<br/>
Suspects with one, do you reproach with three.

</p>
<p>
Julia, in fact, had tolerable grounds,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alfonso's loves with Inez were well known,<br/>
But whether 't was that one's own guilt confounds&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But that can't be, as has been often shown,<br/>
A lady with apologies abounds;&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be that her silence sprang alone<br/>
From delicacy to Don Juan's ear,<br/>
To whom she knew his mother's fame was dear.

</p>
<p>
There might be one more motive, which makes two;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alfonso ne'er to Juan had alluded,&mdash;<br/>
Mention'd his jealousy but never who<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had been the happy lover, he concluded,<br/>
Conceal'd amongst his premises; 't is true,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His mind the more o'er this its mystery brooded;<br/>
To speak of Inez now were, one may say,<br/>
Like throwing Juan in Alfonso's way.

</p>
<p>
A hint, in tender cases, is enough;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence is best, besides there is a tact<br/>
(That modern phrase appears to me sad stuff,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But it will serve to keep my verse compact)-<br/>
Which keeps, when push'd by questions rather rough,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A lady always distant from the fact:<br/>
The charming creatures lie with such a grace,<br/>
There 's nothing so becoming to the face.

</p>
<p>
They blush, and we believe them; at least I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have always done so; 't is of no great use,<br/>
In any case, attempting a reply,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For then their eloquence grows quite profuse;<br/>
And when at length they 're out of breath, they sigh,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And cast their languid eyes down, and let loose<br/>
A tear or two, and then we make it up;<br/>
And then&mdash;and then&mdash;and then&mdash;sit down and sup.

</p>
<p>
Alfonso closed his speech, and begg'd her pardon,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Julia half withheld, and then half granted,<br/>
And laid conditions he thought very hard on,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Denying several little things he wanted:<br/>
He stood like Adam lingering near his garden,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With useless penitence perplex'd and haunted,<br/>
Beseeching she no further would refuse,<br/>
When, lo! he stumbled o'er a pair of shoes.

</p>
<p>
A pair of shoes!&mdash;what then? not much, if they<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are such as fit with ladies' feet, but these<br/>
(No one can tell how much I grieve to say)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were masculine; to see them, and to seize,<br/>
Was but a moment's act.<br/>
&mdash;Ah! well-a-day!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My teeth begin to chatter, my veins freeze&mdash;<br/>
Alfonso first examined well their fashion,<br/>
And then flew out into another passion.

</p>
<p>
He left the room for his relinquish'd sword,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Julia instant to the closet flew.<br/>
'Fly, Juan, fly! for heaven's sake&mdash;not a word&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is open&mdash;you may yet slip through<br/>
The passage you so often have explored&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the garden-key&mdash;Fly&mdash;fly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Adieu!<br/>
Haste&mdash;haste! I hear Alfonso's hurrying feet&mdash;<br/>
Day has not broke&mdash;there 's no one in the street:

</p>
<p>
None can say that this was not good advice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The only mischief was, it came too late;<br/>
Of all experience 't is the usual price,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A sort of income-tax laid on by fate:<br/>
Juan had reach'd the room-door in a. trice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And might have done so by the garden-gate,<br/>
But met Alfonso in his dressing-gown,<br/>
Who threaten'd death&mdash;so Juan knock'd him down.

</p>
<p>
Dire was the scuffle, and out went the light;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Antonia cried out 'Rape!' and Julia 'Fire!'<br/>
But not a servant stirr'd to aid the fight.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alfonso, pommell'd to his heart's desire,<br/>
Swore lustily he'd be revenged this night;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Juan, too, blasphemed an octave higher;<br/>
His blood was up: though young, he was a Tartar,<br/>
And not at all disposed to prove a martyr.

</p>
<p>
Alfonso's sword had dropp'd ere he could draw it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And they continued battling hand to hand,<br/>
For Juan very luckily ne'er saw it;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His temper not being under great command,<br/>
If at that moment he had chanced to claw it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alfonso's days had not been in the land<br/>
Much longer.<br/>
&mdash;Think of husbands', lovers' lives!<br/>
And how ye may be doubly widows&mdash;wives!

</p>
<p>
Alfonso grappled to detain the foe,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Juan throttled him to get away,<br/>
And blood ('t was from the nose) began to flow;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, as they more faintly wrestling lay,<br/>
Juan contrived to give an awkward blow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then his only garment quite gave way;<br/>
He fled, like Joseph, leaving it; but there,<br/>
I doubt, all likeness ends between the pair.

</p>
<p>
Lights came at length, and men, and maids, who found<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An awkward spectacle their eyes before;<br/>
Antonia in hysterics, Julia swoon'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alfonso leaning, breathless, by the door;<br/>
Some half-torn drapery scatter'd on the ground,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some blood, and several footsteps, but no more:<br/>
Juan the gate gain'd, turn'd the key about,<br/>
And liking not the inside, lock'd the out.

</p>
<p>
Here ends this canto.<br/>
&mdash;Need I sing, or say,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How Juan naked, favour'd by the night,<br/>
Who favours what she should not, found his way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And reach'd his home in an unseemly plight?<br/>
The pleasant scandal which arose next day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The nine days' wonder which was brought to light,<br/>
And how Alfonso sued for a divorce,<br/>
Were in the English newspapers, of course.

</p>
<p>
If you would like to see the whole proceedings,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The depositions, and the cause at full,<br/>
The names of all the witnesses, the pleadings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of counsel to nonsuit, or to annul,<br/>
There 's more than one edition, and the readings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are various, but they none of them are dull;<br/>
The best is that in short-hand ta'en by Gurney,<br/>
Who to Madrid on purpose made a journey.

</p>
<p>
But Donna Inez, to divert the train<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of one of the most circulating scandals<br/>
That had for centuries been known in Spain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least since the retirement of the Vandals,<br/>
First vow'd (and never had she vow'd in vain)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To Virgin Mary several pounds of candles;<br/>
And then, by the advice of some old ladies,<br/>
She sent her son to be shipp'd off from Cadiz.

</p>
<p>
She had resolved that he should travel through<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All European climes, by land or sea,<br/>
To mend his former morals, and get new,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially in France and Italy<br/>
(At least this is the thing most people do).<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Julia was sent into a convent: she<br/>
Grieved, but, perhaps, her feelings may be better<br/>
Shown in the following copy of her Letter:&mdash;

</p>
<p>
'They tell me 't is decided; you depart:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is wise&mdash;'t is well, but not the less a pain;<br/>
I have no further claim on your young heart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine is the victim, and would be again;<br/>
To love too much has been the only art<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I used;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;I write in haste, and if a stain<br/>
Be on this sheet, 't is not what it appears;<br/>
My eyeballs burn and throb, but have no tears.

</p>
<p>
'I loved, I love you, for this love have lost<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;State, station, heaven, mankind's, my own esteem,<br/>
And yet can not regret what it hath cost,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So dear is still the memory of that dream;<br/>
Yet, if I name my guilt, 't is not to boast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;None can deem harshlier of me than I deem:<br/>
I trace this scrawl because I cannot rest&mdash;<br/>
I 've nothing to reproach, or to request.

</p>
<p>
'Man's love is of man's life a thing apart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is woman's whole existence; man may range<br/>
The court, camp, church, the vessel, and the mart;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sword, gown, gain, glory, offer in exchange<br/>
Pride, fame, ambition, to fill up his heart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And few there are whom these cannot estrange;<br/>
Men have all these resources, we but one,<br/>
To love again, and be again undone.

</p>
<p>
'You will proceed in pleasure, and in pride,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beloved and loving many; all is o'er<br/>
For me on earth, except some years to hide<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My shame and sorrow deep in my heart's core;<br/>
These I could bear, but cannot cast aside<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The passion which still rages as before&mdash;<br/>
And so farewell&mdash;forgive me, love me<br/>
&mdash;No,<br/>
That word is idle now&mdash;but let it go.

</p>
<p>
'My breast has been all weakness, is so yet;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But still I think I can collect my mind;<br/>
My blood still rushes where my spirit 's set,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As roll the waves before the settled wind;<br/>
My heart is feminine, nor can forget&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To all, except one image, madly blind;<br/>
So shakes the needle, and so stands the pole,<br/>
As vibrates my fond heart to my fix'd soul.

</p>
<p>
'I have no more to say, but linger still,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And dare not set my seal upon this sheet,<br/>
And yet I may as well the task fulfil,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My misery can scarce be more complete:<br/>
I had not lived till now, could sorrow kill;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Death shuns the wretch who fain the blow would meet,<br/>
And I must even survive this last adieu,<br/>
And bear with life, to love and pray for you!'

</p>
<p>
This note was written upon gilt-edged paper<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a neat little crow-quill, slight and new:<br/>
Her small white hand could hardly reach the taper,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It trembled as magnetic needles do,<br/>
And yet she did not let one tear escape her;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The seal a sun-flower; 'Elle vous suit partout,'<br/>
The motto cut upon a white cornelian;<br/>
The wax was superfine, its hue vermilion.

</p>
<p>
This was Don Juan's earliest scrape; but whether<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall proceed with his adventures is<br/>
Dependent on the public altogether;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We 'll see, however, what they say to this:<br/>
Their favour in an author's cap 's a feather,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And no great mischief 's done by their caprice;<br/>
And if their approbation we experience,<br/>
Perhaps they 'll have some more about a year hence.

</p>
<p>
My poem 's epic, and is meant to be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Divided in twelve books; each book containing,<br/>
With love, and war, a heavy gale at sea,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A list of ships, and captains, and kings reigning,<br/>
New characters; the episodes are three:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A panoramic view of hell 's in training,<br/>
After the style of Virgil and of Homer,<br/>
So that my name of Epic 's no misnomer.

</p>
<p>
All these things will be specified in time,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With strict regard to Aristotle's rules,<br/>
The Vade Mecum of the true sublime,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which makes so many poets, and some fools:<br/>
Prose poets like blank-verse, I 'm fond of rhyme,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Good workmen never quarrel with their tools;<br/>
I 've got new mythological machinery,<br/>
And very handsome supernatural scenery.

</p>
<p>
There 's only one slight difference between<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Me and my epic brethren gone before,<br/>
And here the advantage is my own, I ween<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Not that I have not several merits more,<br/>
But this will more peculiarly be seen);<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They so embellish, that 't is quite a bore<br/>
Their labyrinth of fables to thread through,<br/>
Whereas this story 's actually true.

</p>
<p>
If any person doubt it, I appeal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To history, tradition, and to facts,<br/>
To newspapers, whose truth all know and feel,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To plays in five, and operas in three acts;<br/>
All these confirm my statement a good deal,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But that which more completely faith exacts<br/>
Is that myself, and several now in Seville,<br/>
Saw Juan's last elopement with the devil.

</p>
<p>
If ever I should condescend to prose,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I 'll write poetical commandments, which<br/>
Shall supersede beyond all doubt all those<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That went before; in these I shall enrich<br/>
My text with many things that no one knows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And carry precept to the highest pitch:<br/>
I 'll call the work 'Longinus o'er a Bottle,<br/>
Or, Every Poet his own Aristotle.'

</p>
<p>
Thou shalt believe in Milton, Dryden, Pope;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt not set up Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey;<br/>
Because the first is crazed beyond all hope,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The second drunk, the third so quaint and mouthy:<br/>
With Crabbe it may be difficult to cope,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Campbell's Hippocrene is somewhat drouthy:<br/>
Thou shalt not steal from Samuel Rogers, nor<br/>
Commit&mdash;flirtation with the muse of Moore.

</p>
<p>
Thou shalt not covet Mr. Sotheby's Muse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His Pegasus, nor anything that 's his;<br/>
Thou shalt not bear false witness like 'the Blues'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(There 's one, at least, is very fond of this);<br/>
Thou shalt not write, in short, but what I choose:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is true criticism, and you may kiss&mdash;<br/>
Exactly as you please, or not,&mdash;the rod;

</p>
<p>
If any person should presume to assert<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This story is not moral, first, I pray,<br/>
That they will not cry out before they 're hurt,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then that they 'll read it o'er again, and say<br/>
(But, doubtless, nobody will be so pert)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That this is not a moral tale, though gay;<br/>
Besides, in Canto Twelfth, I mean to show<br/>
The very place where wicked people go.

</p>
<p>
If, after all, there should be some so blind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To their own good this warning to despise,<br/>
Led by some tortuosity of mind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to believe my verse and their own eyes,<br/>
And cry that they 'the moral cannot find,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell him, if a clergyman, he lies;<br/>
Should captains the remark, or critics, make,<br/>
They also lie too&mdash;under a mistake.

</p>
<p>
The public approbation I expect,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And beg they 'll take my word about the moral,<br/>
Which I with their amusement will connect<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(So children cutting teeth receive a coral);<br/>
Meantime, they 'll doubtless please to recollect<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My epical pretensions to the laurel:<br/>
For fear some prudish readers should grow skittish,<br/>
I 've bribed my grandmother's review&mdash;the British.

</p>
<p>
I sent it in a letter to the Editor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who thank'd me duly by return of post&mdash;<br/>
I 'm for a handsome article his creditor;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, if my gentle Muse he please to roast,<br/>
And break a promise after having made it her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Denying the receipt of what it cost,<br/>
And smear his page with gall instead of honey,<br/>
All I can say is&mdash;that he had the money.

</p>
<p>
I think that with this holy new alliance<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I may ensure the public, and defy<br/>
All other magazines of art or science,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily, or monthly, or three monthly; I<br/>
Have not essay'd to multiply their clients,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they tell me 't were in vain to try,<br/>
And that the Edinburgh Review and Quarterly<br/>
Treat a dissenting author very martyrly.

</p>
<p>
'Non ego hoc ferrem calida juventa<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Consule Planco,' Horace said, and so<br/>
Say I; by which quotation there is meant a<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hint that some six or seven good years ago<br/>
(Long ere I dreamt of dating from the Brenta)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I was most ready to return a blow,<br/>
And would not brook at all this sort of thing<br/>
In my hot youth&mdash;when George the Third was King.

</p>
<p>
But now at thirty years my hair is grey<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(I wonder what it will be like at forty?<br/>
I thought of a peruke the other day)&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart is not much greener; and, in short, I<br/>
Have squander'd my whole summer while 't was May,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And feel no more the spirit to retort; I<br/>
Have spent my life, both interest and principal,<br/>
And deem not, what I deem'd, my soul invincible.

</p>
<p>
No more&mdash;no more<br/>
&mdash;Oh! never more on me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The freshness of the heart can fall like dew,<br/>
Which out of all the lovely things we see<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Extracts emotions beautiful and new,<br/>
Hived in our bosoms like the bag o' the bee:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Think'st thou the honey with those objects grew?<br/>
Alas! 't was not in them, but in thy power<br/>
To double even the sweetness of a flower.

</p>
<p>
No more&mdash;no more<br/>
&mdash;Oh! never more, my heart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Canst thou be my sole world, my universe!<br/>
Once all in all, but now a thing apart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou canst not be my blessing or my curse:<br/>
The illusion 's gone for ever, and thou art<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Insensible, I trust, but none the worse,<br/>
And in thy stead I 've got a deal of judgment,<br/>
Though heaven knows how it ever found a lodgment.

</p>
<p>
My days of love are over; me no more<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The charms of maid, wife, and still less of widow,<br/>
Can make the fool of which they made before,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, I must not lead the life I did do;<br/>
The credulous hope of mutual minds is o'er,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The copious use of claret is forbid too,<br/>
So for a good old-gentlemanly vice,<br/>
I think I must take up with avarice.

</p>
<p>
Ambition was my idol, which was broken<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the shrines of Sorrow, and of Pleasure;<br/>
And the two last have left me many a token<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er which reflection may be made at leisure:<br/>
Now, like Friar Bacon's brazen head, I 've spoken,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Time is, Time was, Time 's past:'&mdash;a chymic treasure<br/>
Is glittering youth, which I have spent betimes&mdash;<br/>
My heart in passion, and my head on rhymes.

</p>
<p>
What is the end of Fame? 't is but to fill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain portion of uncertain paper:<br/>
Some liken it to climbing up a hill,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose summit, like all hills, is lost in vapour;<br/>
For this men write, speak, preach, and heroes kill,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bards burn what they call their 'midnight taper,'<br/>
To have, when the original is dust,<br/>
A name, a wretched picture, and worse bust.

</p>
<p>
What are the hopes of man? Old Egypt's King<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheops erected the first pyramid<br/>
And largest, thinking it was just the thing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;<br/>
But somebody or other rummaging,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:<br/>
Let not a monument give you or me hopes,<br/>
Since not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops.

</p>
<p>
But I being fond of true philosophy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Say very often to myself, 'Alas!<br/>
All things that have been born were born to die,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And flesh (which Death mows down to hay) is grass;<br/>
You 've pass'd your youth not so unpleasantly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you had it o'er again&mdash;'t would pass&mdash;<br/>
So thank your stars that matters are no worse,<br/>
And read your Bible, sir, and mind your purse.'

</p>
<p>
But for the present, gentle reader! and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still gentler purchaser! the bard&mdash;that 's <em>I&mdash;<br/>
</em>Must, with permission, shake you by the hand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so 'Your humble servant, and good-b'ye!'<br/>
We meet again, if we should understand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each other; and if not, I shall not try<br/>
Your patience further than by this short sample&mdash;<br/>
'T were well if others follow'd my example.

</p>
<p>
'Go, little book, from this my solitude!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I cast thee on the waters&mdash;go thy ways!<br/>
And if, as I believe, thy vein be good,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The world will find thee after many days.'<br/>
When Southey's read, and Wordsworth understood,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't help putting in my claim to praise&mdash;<br/>
The four first rhymes are Southey's every line:<br/>
For God's sake, reader! take them not for mine.
