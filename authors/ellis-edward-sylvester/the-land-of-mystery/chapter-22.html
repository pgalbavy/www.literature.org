<p>It will be understood that during the interview described, the
three white men stood near the front entrance to the royal apartment
with their faces turned toward King Haffgo.</p>

<p>In this position each made good use of his eyes and Fred Ashman's,
from some cause or other, continually wandered to the draped curtains
at the right of the ruler, between which he must pass when entering
or leaving that part of his residence.</p>

<p>It was while his gaze was used on these curtains that he saw
them gently agitated in a way which left no doubt that some person
on the other side was the cause.</p>

<p>By and by he discerned part of a dainty hand, and the next minute
became aware that a pair of the most beautifully lustrous eyes
on which he had ever gazed was peering into the apartment.</p>

<p>"<em>It is Ariel</em>," was his instant thought, "and she as
listening to the words that we are speaking."</p>

<p>The thought had hardly found shape, when one eye, a part of a
lovely face and the top of the head were discerned, as the owner,
giving rein to her curiosity, ventured upon a little further view
of the visitors.</p>

<p>Then, as if conscious of her breach of etiquette, she withdrew,
like a flash, from view altogether.</p>

<p>But he knew it was only for a brief interval, and sure enough,
the eyes speedily appeared at another portion of the curtains,
where the beauteous princess must have believed she was not observed,
for she looked steadily at the faces of the visitors, with a depth
of interest that it was vain for her to attempt to conceal.</p>

<p>The heart of Fred Ashman gave a flutter, when he realized that
the midnight orbs were fastened upon <em>him</em>, and, evidently
studying his countenance with more interest than those of his
companions.</p>

<p>Feeling a peculiar boldness, because of the strange situation
in which he was placed, he deliberately smiled at the unknown
one.</p>

<p>She could not have vanished more suddenly had she been snatched
away by the hand of some ogre.</p>

<p>A pang shot through Fred's heart, as he felt that he had driven
away the enchantress by his own forwardness.  He reproached himself
bitterly for having overreached himself.</p>

<p>But while he was lamenting, he once more discovered the eyes,
rivalling the diamonds in the crown of her royal father, slyly
viewing him from the other side of the curtain.  This time the
fair one took care that no part of her countenance was visible,
and the young man was equally guarded for the time, not to betray
his sweet knowledge of the other's scrutiny.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture, that King Haffgo addressed some pointed
questions to Ashman who was forced to withdraw his gaze from the
marvellously attractive sight, and fasten it upon the rugged and
wrinkled countenance of the king of the Murhapas.</p>

<p>But those eyes were in his field of vision, and, even while speaking
to the potentate, his glance continually wandered to the orbs
which attracted him as the lodestone draws the magnet.</p>

<p>But alas! the American forgot a fact of the first importance:
the eyes of the father were as observant as those of his only
child.  He saw the furtive glances at the curtains, and a slight
rustling at his right hand told him that his beloved Ariel, with
the curiosity of her sex, was playing the eavesdropper.</p>

<p>The indulgent father would have cared nothing for this, had he
not discovered the extraordinary interest which one of his three
callers manifested in his child.  In that moment, the distrust
which he felt of the strange race was turned to violent hatred
toward one of its members, because of his unpardonable insolence
in daring to return the gaze with a smile.</p>

<p>The king suddenly leaned the javelin in his hand against the
chair in which he was sitting, and partly rose from his seat as
if about to descend from the throne.  Instead of doing so, he
leaned slightly to one side, and, with a quick movement, seized
one of the curtains and snatched it aside.</p>

<p>The act, which was like the flitting of a bird's wing, caused
Ariel, his daughter, to stand forth fully revealed!</p>

<p>If the white men had been dazzled by the amazing collection of
diamonds on the brow of the king, it may be said that they were
now blinded for the moment by the vision of loveliness which burst
upon them, like the unexpected emergence of the sun from behind
a dark cloud.</p>

<p>Before the princess could rally from her bewilderment, her father
sharply commanded her to advance.  She knew that that affectionate
parent could be stern and cruel as well as loving and affectionate,
and with her eyes bent modestly on the floor she stepped forward
and stood beside him.</p>

<p>Her hair, instead of being auburn like her parent's, was as black
as the raven's wing.  It hung in luxuriant wavy masses below her
waist, being gathered by a white clasp of burnished silver at
the back of the neck, without which it would have enveloped all
the upper part of her body in its fleecy veil.</p>

<p>Her gown of spotless white, composed of native cloth, as fine
as satin, was without any ornament.  It was encircled at the waist
by a golden girdle, falling in folds which concealed the rest
of the figure, leaving only one Cinderella-like foot to twinkle
from the front, like a jewel of rare beauty.</p>

<p>But no eye could fail to see that the slight girlish figure was
of ravishing perfection.  The waist was slender, the partly revealed
arms were as delicate as lilies, the tiny hands with their tapering
fingers were like those of a fairy, while the countenance was
one of the fairest that ever sun shone on.</p>

<p>The contour was such as Rubens delighted to place on canvas,
and that Michael Angelo loved to carve from the snowy marble. 
The Grecian nose, the small mouth, the white teeth, unstained
like those of her countrymen and countrywomen, the wealth of hair,
the lustrous, soulful eyes, the sea-shell-like tint of the cheeks,
all these fell upon the startled vision of the explorers with
such overpowering suddenness that for the moment they believed
they were dreaming, or that some trick of magic revealed to them
a picture which had no reality.</p>

<p>"Look upon the white men!" commanded the king speaking in English,
and with a sternness which left disobedience out of the question;
"look, I say, for never will come the opportunity to see them
again."</p>

<p>It was then that Ariel raised her eyes, and turned them toward
the trio, gazing at no one in particular&mdash;for she knew her parent
was closely studying her&mdash;but seeming to fix them upon some one
miles behind them.</p>

<p>Grimcke, Long and Ashman again bowed their heads almost to the
ground, and, feeling that the interview was over, began withdrawing.</p>

<p>Like the vassals leaving the presence of their sovereign, they
did so walking backward, with their faces toward the throne, and
making a low obeisance with each step.</p>

<p>The king looked steadily at them, without inclining his head
or making the slightest acknowledgment of the salutation.  Had
not Fred Ashman been mad with the intoxication of his new, overwhelming
passion, he would have observed that which was noticed by Grimcke
and Long: the King was watching him.</p>

<p>The young American hardly raised his gaze from the floor, until
in his retreat, he found himself at the entrance, by which all
three had come in to the apartment.  His companions had made their
final obeisance and disappeared, while he was left with Ziffak
standing near the middle of the apartment, his pose such that
he could glance at his royal relative or at him without shifting
his body.</p>

<p>It now became Fred's duty to assume the perpendicular, in order
to effect a graceful withdrawal.</p>

<p>As he came upright once more, he looked straight into the countenance
of the scowling king.  Then&mdash;he could not help it&#11834;his eyes flashed
in the face of the blushing Ariel, who was gazing fixedly at him,
and he smiled and saluted her.</p>

<p>It was a daring thing to do, with the eyes of the king and the
head chieftain upon him.  He never understood how it was that
it was done. The salutation might have been forgiven, but that
smile was an offense like smiting King Haffgo's countenance with
the back of the open hand.</p>

<p>But wonder of wonders! the ruby lips of the radiant beauty parted
for an instant in the faintest possible smile which lit up her
countenance like a burst of sunshine.  Ashman noticed not the
diamond bracelet and necklace, which flashed in all their prismatic
beauty, but knew only that she had returned the smile of recognition. 
For that boon he would have risked life a thousand times over.</p>

<p>Both Ziffak and the king were looking at the white man at the
moment; but, as if suspicion had entered the brain of the infuriated
monarch, he quickly shifted his head and glared at his daughter.</p>

<p>The movement was like the dart of a serpent, but that shadowy
smile on the face of Ariel had passed, as the lightning flash
cleaves the midnight, leaving the darkness deeper than before.</p>

<p>The king saw it not, and well for his child that so it was; for,
much as he cherished her, he would have smitten her to the earth
had he dreamed that she ventured on such a response to the impudence
of the white man, whose very life was his own only through the
sufferance of King Haffgo.</p>

<p>Not until Fred Ashman found himself in the air on the outside
of the place did he realize what he had done.  He feared that
he had committed a fatal indiscretion, but when he asked, himself
whether he would recall it if he could, his heart said "No."</p>

<p>The afternoon was drawing to a close, and there was a sensible
coolness in the air.  The natives who had remained standing round
the front of the palace, when the explorers first went inside,
had grown tired of waiting and, scattered in different directions. 
The Murhapa village wore its usual appearance, so in contrast
with what met the eyes of our friends when they first saw it.</p>

<p>The Professor and the New Englander were waiting near the door
for Ashman to join them.  As he came out, the former shook his
head, with a laugh, as an intimation that the young man in the
ardor of his interest had made a mistake.</p>

<p>Fred admitted that possibly he had forgotten himself, but added
that it was now too late to recall what had been done, and he
was not sure that he would do so, if the opportunity were given.</p>

<p>"At any rate," said he, "we are promised safe treatment for a
couple of days, provided we don't stray off or misbehave ourselves. 
Our visit can't amount to anything after all, since we must start
for home whenever King Haffgo gives his command."</p>

<p>"A good deal may take place in two days," said the Professor
significantly.</p>

<p>"And a good deal <em>after</em> five days," was the more significant
remark of Jared Long.</p>

<p>It was evident from these declarations that Grimcke and Long
had in mind the same thought; which came to Ashman himself, when
the ruler of the Murhapas made known to his guests that they must
take their departure within such a brief period.</p>

<p>While no one of the three would have dared to signify dissent,
yet they were not the men to come so many hundred miles, forcing
their way through endless dangers to turn about and retrace their
steps at the command of a savage who looked upon himself as king,
simply because he was able to lord it over a horde of barbarians.</p>

<p>It was no place to discuss their plans, in front of the "palace,"
especially as the natives were beginning to gather around them
again, and among them it was certain was more than one who understood
the English tongue "as she is spoke."</p>

<p>They were waiting for the coming of Ziffak, who was still within. 
He was their chaperon, and without his guidance, they did not
dare to move from the spot.</p>

<p>"Hark!" suddenly exclaimed the Professor, raising his hand as
a signal for the whispering to cease.</p>

<p>The sound of voices was heard inside.  They recognized the tones
of Ziffak, to which they had become accustomed since the previous
night. Those of King Haffgo were also distinguishable, and there
could be no doubt to whom the low silvery accents heard only occasionally
belonged.</p>

<p>The alarming feature of it all was, that the king was in an unmistakably
angry mood.  He not only talked fast but he talked loud, sure
evidence of his excited feelings.  It sounded as if Ziffak was
striving to placate him, but his royal brother grew more savage
each moment.</p>

<p>The words of all were uttered in the Murhapa tongue, so that
the listeners could form no idea of their meaning.  Had they been
able to do so, it is safe to say that they would have been in
anything but a comfortable frame of mind.</p>
