<p>The arrival of Dolokhov diverted Petya's attention from the
drummer boy, to whom Denisov had had some mutton and vodka given,
and whom he had had dressed in a Russian coat so that he might be kept
with their band and not sent away with the other prisoners. Petya
had heard in the army many stories of Dolokhov's extraordinary bravery
and of his cruelty to the French, so from the moment he entered the
hut Petya did not take his eyes from him, but braced himself up more
and more and held his head high, that he might not be unworthy even of
such company.</p>

<p>Dolokhov's appearance amazed Petya by its simplicity.</p>

<p>Denisov wore a Cossack coat, had a beard, had an icon of Nicholas
the Wonder-Worker on his breast, and his way of speaking and
everything he did indicated his unusual position. But Dolokhov, who in
Moscow had worn a Persian costume, had now the appearance of a most
correct officer of the Guards. He was clean-shaven and wore a
Guardsman's padded coat with an Order of St. George at his
buttonhole and a plain forage cap set straight on his head. He took
off his wet felt cloak in a corner of the room, and without greeting
anyone went up to Denisov and began questioning him about the matter
in hand. Denisov told him of the designs the large detachments had
on the transport, of the message Petya had brought, and his own
replies to both generals. Then he told him all he knew of the French
detachment.</p>

<p>&quot;That's so. But we must know what troops they are and their
numbers,&quot; said Dolokhov. &quot;It will be necessary to go there. We can't
start the affair without knowing for certain how many there are. I
like to work accurately. Here now- wouldn't one of these gentlemen
like to ride over to the French camp with me? I have brought a spare
uniform.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I, I... I'll go with you!&quot; cried Petya.</p>

<p>&quot;There's no need for you to go at all,&quot; said Denisov, addressing
Dolokhov, &quot;and as for him, I won't let him go on any account.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I like that!&quot; exclaimed Petya. &quot;Why shouldn't I go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because it's useless.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you must excuse me, because... because... I shall go, and
that's all. You'll take me, won't you?&quot; he said, turning to Dolokhov.</p>

<p>&quot;Why not?&quot; Dolokhov answered absently, scrutinizing the face of
the French drummer boy. &quot;Have you had that youngster with you long?&quot;
he asked Denisov.</p>

<p>&quot;He was taken today but he knows nothing. I'm keeping him with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and where do you put the others?&quot; inquired Dolokhov.</p>

<p>&quot;Where? I send them away and take a weceipt for them,&quot; shouted
Denisov, suddenly flushing. &quot;And I say boldly that I have not a single
man's life on my conscience. Would it be difficult for you to send
thirty or thwee hundwed men to town under escort, instead of staining-
I speak bluntly- staining the honor of a soldier?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count
of sixteen,&quot; said Dolokhov with cold irony, &quot;but it's time for you
to drop it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, I've not said anything! I only say that I'll certainly go with
you,&quot; said Petya shyly.</p>

<p>&quot;But for you and me, old fellow, it's time to drop these amenities,&quot;
continued Dolokhov, as if he found particular pleasure in speaking
of this subject which irritated Denisov. &quot;Now, why have you kept
this lad?&quot; he went on, swaying his head. &quot;Because you are sorry for
him! Don't we know those 'receipts' of yours? You send a hundred men
away, and thirty get there. The rest either starve or get killed. So
isn't it all the same not to send them?&quot;</p>

<p>The esaul, screwing up his light-colored eyes, nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>&quot;That's not the point. I'm not going to discuss the matter. I do not
wish to take it on my conscience. You say they'll die. All wight. Only
not by my fault!&quot;</p>

<p>Dolokhov began laughing.</p>

<p>&quot;Who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over? But if
they did catch me they'd string me up to an aspen tree, and with all
your chivalry just the same.&quot; He paused. &quot;However, we must get to
work. Tell the Cossack to fetch my kit. I have two French uniforms
in it. Well, are you coming with me?&quot; he asked Petya.</p>

<p>&quot;I? Yes, yes, certainly!&quot; cried Petya, blushing almost to tears
and glancing at Denisov.</p>

<p>While Dolokhov had been disputing with Denisov what should be done
with prisoners, Petya had once more felt awkward and restless; but
again he had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about.
&quot;If grown-up, distinguished men think so, it must be necessary and
right,&quot; thought he. &quot;But above all Denisov must not dare to imagine
that I'll obey him and that he can order me about. I will certainly go
to the French camp with Dolokhov. If he can, so can I!&quot;</p>

<p>And to all Denisov's persuasions, Petya replied that he too was
accustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow, and that
he never considered personal danger.</p>

<p>&quot;For you'll admit that if we don't know for sure how many of them
there are... hundreds of lives may depend on it, while there are
only two of us. Besides, I want to go very much and certainly will go,
so don't hinder me,&quot; said he. &quot;It will only make things worse...&quot;</p>
