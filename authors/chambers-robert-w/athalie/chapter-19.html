<p>There was a slight fragrance of tobacco in the room mingling
with the fresh, spring-like scent of lilacs&mdash;great pale clusters
of them decorated mantel and table, and the desk where Athalie
sat writing to Captain Dane in the semi-dusk of a May evening.</p>

<p>Here and there dim figures loomed in the big square room; the
graceful shape of a young girl at the piano detached itself from
the gloom; a man or two dawdled by the window, vaguely silhouetted
against the lilac-tinted sky.</p>

<p>Athalie wrote on: "I had not supposed you had landed until Cecil
Reeve told me this evening. If you are not too tired to come,
please do so. Do you realise that you have been away over a year?
Do you realise that I am now twenty-four years old, and that I
am growing older every minute? You had better hasten, then, because
very soon I shall be too old to believe your magic fairy tales
of field and flood and all your wonder lore of travel in those
distant golden lands I dream of.</p>

<p>"Who was your white companion? Cecil tells me that you said you
had one. Bring him with you this evening; you'll need corroboration,
I fear. And mostly I desire to know if you are well, and next
I wish to hear whether you did really find the lost city of Yhdunez."</p>

<p>A maid came to take the note to Dane's hotel, the Great Eastern,
and Cecil Reeve looked up and laid aside his cigarette.</p>

<p>"Come on, Athalie," he said, "tell Peg to turn on one of those
Peruvian dances."</p>

<p>Peggy Brooks at the piano struck a soft sensuous chord or two,
but Francis Hargrave would not have it, and he pulled out the
proper phonographic record and cranked the machine while Cecil
rolled up the Beluch rugs.</p>

<p>The somewhat muffled air that exuded from the machine was the
lovely Miraflores, gay, lively, languorous, sad by turns&mdash;and
much danced at the moment in New York.</p>

<p>A new spring moon looked into the room from the west where like
elegant and graceful phantoms the dancers moved, swayed, glided,
swung back again with sinuous grace into the suavely delicate
courtship of the dance.</p>

<p>The slender feet and swaying figure of Athalie seemed presently
to bewitch the other couple, for they drew aside and stood together
watching that exquisite incarnation of youth itself, gliding,
bending, floating in the lilac-scented, lilac-tinted dusk under
the young moon.</p>

<p>The machine ran down in the course of time, and Hargrave went
over to re-wind it, but Peggy Brooks waved him aside and seated
herself at the piano, saying she had enough of Hargrave.</p>

<p>She was still playing the quaint, sweet dance called "The Orchid,"
and Hargrave was leaning on the piano beside her watching Cecil
and Athalie drifting through the dusk to the music's rhythm, when
the door opened and somebody came in.</p>

<p>Athalie, in Cecil's arms, turned her head, looking back over
her shoulder. Dane loomed tall in the twilight.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed; "I am so glad!"&mdash;slipping out of Cecil's
arms and wheeling on Dane, both hands outstretched.</p>

<p>The others came up, also, with quick, gay greetings, and after
a moment or two of general and animated chatter Athalie drew Dane
into a corner and made room for him beside her on the sofa. Peggy
had turned on the music machine again and, snubbing Hargrave,
was already beginning the Miraflores with Cecil Reeve.</p>

<p>Athalie said: "<em>Are</em> you well? That's the first question."</p>

<p>He said he was well.</p>

<p>"And did you find your lost city?"</p>

<p>He said, quietly: "We found Yhdunez."</p>

<p>"We?"</p>

<p>"I and my white companion."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you bring him with you this evening?" she asked.
"Did you tell him I invited him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh.... Couldn't he come?"</p>

<p>And, as he made no answer: "Couldn't he?" she repeated. "Who
is he, anyway&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Clive Bailey."</p>

<p>She sat motionless, looking at him, the question still parting
her lips. Dully in her ears the music sounded. The pallor which
had stricken her face faded, grew again, then waned in the faint
return of colour.</p>

<p>Dane, who was looking away from her rather fixedly, spoke first,
still not looking at her: "Yes," he said in even, agreeable tones,
"Clive was my white companion.... I gave him your note to read....
He did not seem to think that he ought to come."</p>

<p>"Why?" Her lips scarcely formed the word.</p>

<p>" &mdash;As long as you were not aware of whom you were inviting....
There had been some misunderstanding between you and him&mdash;or so
I gathered&mdash;from his attitude."</p>

<p>A few moments more of silence; then she was fairly prepared.</p>

<p>"Is he well?" she asked coolly.</p>

<p>"Yes. He had one of those nameless fevers, down there. He's coming
out of it all right."</p>

<p>"Is he&mdash;his appearance&mdash;changed?"</p>

<p>"He's changed a lot, judging from the photographs he showed me
taken three or four years ago. He's changed in other ways, too,
I fancy."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I only surmise it. One hears about people&mdash;and their characteristics....
Clive is a good deal of a man.... I never had a better companion....
There were hardships&mdash;tight corners&mdash;we had a bad time of it for
a while, along the Andes.... And the natives are treacherous&mdash;every
one of them.... He was a good comrade. No man can say more than
that, Miss Greensleeve. That includes about everything I ever
heard of&mdash;when a man proves to be a good comrade. And there is
no place on earth where a man can be so thoroughly tried out as
in that sunless wilderness."</p>

<p>"Is he stopping at the Great Eastern?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I believe he's going back on Saturday."</p>

<p>She looked up sharply: "Back? Where?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not to Peru. Only to England," said Dane, forcing a laugh.</p>

<p>After a moment she said: "And he wouldn't come.... It is only
three blocks, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't the distance, of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No; I remember. He thought I might not have cared to see him."</p>

<p>"That was it."</p>

<p>Another silence; then in a lower voice which sounded a little
hard: "His wife is living in England, I suppose."</p>

<p>"She is living &mdash;I don't know where."</p>

<p>"Have they&mdash;children?"</p>

<p>"I believe not."</p>

<p>She remained silent for a while, then, coolly enough:</p>

<p>"I suppose he is sailing on Saturday to see his wife."</p>

<p>"I think not," said Dane, gravely.</p>

<p>"You say he is sailing for England."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I imagine it's because he has nowhere else to go."</p>

<p>"Why doesn't he stay here?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"He is American. His friends live here. Why doesn't he remain
here?"</p>

<p>Dane shook his head: "He's a restless man, Miss Greensleeve.
That kind of man can't stay anywhere. He's got to go on&mdash;somewhere."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>There came a pause; then they talked of other things for a while
until other people began to drop in, Arthur Ensart, Anne Randolph,
and young Welter &mdash;Helter Skelter Welter, always, metaphorically
speaking, redolent of saddle leather and reeking of sport. His
theme happened to be his own wonderful trap record, that evening;
and the fat, good-humoured, ardent young man prattled on about
"unknown angles," and "incomers," until Dane, who had been hunting
jaguars and cannibals along the unknown Andes, concealed his yawns
with difficulty.</p>

<p>Ensart insisted on turning on the lights and starting the machine;
and presently Anne Randolph and Peggy were dancing the Miraflores
with Cecil and Ensart.</p>

<p>Welter had cornered Hargrave and Dane and was telling them all
about it, and Athalie went slowly through the passage-way and
into her own bedroom, where she stood quite motionless for a while,
looking at the floor. Hafiz, dozing on the bed, awoke, gazed at
his mistress gravely, yawned, and went to sleep again.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "His theme happened to be his own wonderful trap
record, that evening."]</p>

<p>Presently she dropped onto a chair by her little ivory-tinted
Louis <em>XVI </em>desk. There was a telephone there and a directory.</p>

<p>When she had decided to open the latter, and had found the number
she wanted, she unhooked the receiver and called for it.</p>

<p>After a few minutes somebody said that he was not in his room,
but that he was being paged.</p>

<p>She waited, dully attentive to the far noises which sounded over
the wire; then came a voice:</p>

<p>"Yes; who is it?"</p>

<p>She said: "I wished to speak to Mr. Bailey &mdash;Mr. Clive Bailey."</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Bailey."</p>

<p>For a moment the fact that she had not recognised his voice seemed
to strike her speechless. And it was only when he spoke again,
inquiringly, that she said in a low voice: "Clive!"</p>

<p>"Yes.... Is&mdash;is it <em>you</em>!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>And in the next heavily pulsating moment her breath came back
with her self-control:</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come, Clive?"</p>

<p>"I didn't imagine you wanted me."</p>

<p>"I asked Captain Dane to invite you."</p>

<p>"Did you know whom you were inviting?"</p>

<p>"No.... But I do now. Will you come?"</p>

<p>"Yes. When?"</p>

<p>"When you like. Come now if you like&mdash;unless you were engaged&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What were you doing when I called you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing.... Walking about the lobby."</p>

<p>"Did you find it interesting?"</p>

<p>She heard him laugh&mdash;such a curious, strange, shaken laugh.</p>

<p>She said: "I shall be very glad to see you, Clive. There are
some of your friends here, too, who will be glad to see you."</p>

<p>"Then I'll wait until&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No; I had rather meet you for the first time when others are
here&mdash;if you don't mind. Do you?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, coolly; "I'll come."</p>

<p>"Now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, immediately."</p>

<p>Her heart was going at a terrific pace when she hung up the receiver.
She went to her mirror, turned on the side-lights, and looked
at herself. From the front room came the sound of the dance music,
a ripple or two of laughter. Welter's eager voice singing still
of arms and the man.</p>

<p>Long she stood there, motionless, studying herself, so that,
when the moment came that was coming now so swiftly upon her,
she might know what she appeared like in his eyes.</p>

<p>All, so far, was sheer, fresh youth with her; her eyes had not
lost their dewy beauty; the splendour of her hair remained unchanged.
There were no lines, nothing lost, nothing hardened in contour.
Clear and smooth her snowy chin; perfect, so far, the lovely throat:
nothing of blemish was visible, no souvenirs of grief, of pain.</p>

<p>And, as she looked, and all the time she was looking, she felt,
subtly, that the ordered routine of her thoughts was changing;
that a transformation was beginning somewhere deep within her&mdash;a
new character emerging&mdash;a personality unfamiliar, disturbing,
as though not entirely to be depended on.</p>

<p>And in the mirror she saw her lips, scarcely parted, more vivid
than she had ever seen them, and her eyes two wells of azure splendour;
saw the smooth young bosom rise and fall; felt her heart, rapid,
imperious, beating the "colours" into her cheeks.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as she stood there, she heard him come in;&mdash;heard the
astonished and joyous exclamations &mdash;Cecil's bantering, cynical
voice, Welter's loud welcome. She pressed both hands to her hot
cheeks, stared at herself a moment, then turned and walked leisurely
toward the living-room.</p>

<p>In her heart a voice was crying, crying: "Let the world see so
that there may be no mistake! This man who was friendless is my
friend. Let there be no mistake that he is more or less than that."
But she only said with a quick smile, and offering her hand: "I
am so glad to see you, Clive. I am so glad you came." And stood,
still smiling, looking into the lean, sun-tanned face, under the
concentrated eyes of her friends around them both.</p>

<p>For a second it was difficult for him to speak; but only she
saw the slight quiver of the mouth.</p>

<p>"You are&mdash;quite the same," he said; "no more beautiful, no less.
Time is not the essence of your contract with Venus."</p>

<p>"Oh, Clive! And I am twenty-four! Tell me&mdash;<em>are</em> you a
trifle grey!&mdash;just above the temples?&mdash;or is it the light?"</p>

<p>"He's grey," said Cecil; "don't flatter him, Athalie. And Oh,
Lord, what a thinness!"</p>

<p>Peggy Brooks, professionally curious, said naïvely: "Are you
still rather full of bacilli, Mr. Bailey? And would you mind if
I took a drop of blood from you some day?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Clive, laughing away the strain that still
fettered his speech a little. "You may have quarts if you like,
Dr. Brooks."</p>

<p>"How was the shooting?" inquired Welter, bustling up like a judge
at a bench-show when the awards are applauded.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;there was shooting&mdash;of course," said Clive with an involuntary
and half-humorous glance at Captain Dane.</p>

<p>"Good nigger hunting," nodded Dane. "Unknown angles, Welter.
You ought to run down there."</p>

<p>"Any incomparable Indian maidens wearing nothing but ornaments
of gold?" inquired Cecil.</p>

<p>"That is partly true," said Clive, laughing.</p>

<p>"If you put a period after 'nothing,' I suppose," suggested Peggy.</p>

<p>"About that."</p>

<p>He turned to Athalie; but her silent, smiling gaze confused him
so that he forgot what he had meant to say, and stood without
a word amid the chatter that rose and ebbed about him.</p>

<p>Anne Randolph and Arthur Ensart had joined hands, their restless
feet sketching the first steps of the Miraflores; and presently
somebody cranked the machine.</p>

<p>"Come on!" said Peggy imperiously to Dane; "you've been too long
in the jungle dancing with Indian maidens!"</p>

<p>Other people dropped in &mdash;Adele Millis, young Grismer, John
Lyndhurst, Jeanne Delauny.</p>

<p>When Clive saw Rosalie Faithorn saunter in with James Allys he
stared, but that young seceder from his own set greeted him without
embarrassment and lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Where's Winifred?" she asked nonchalantly. "Still on the outs?
Yes? Why not shuffle and draw again? Winifred was always a pig."</p>

<p>Clive flushed at the girl's frankness although he could have
expected nothing less from her.</p>

<p>Rosalie continued to smoke and to inspect him critically: "You're
a bit seedy and a bit weedy, Clive, but you'll come around with
feeding. You're really all right. I'd have you myself if I was
marrying young men these days."</p>

<p>"That's nice of you, Rosalie.... But I'm full of rare bacilli."</p>

<p>"The rarer the better&mdash;if you must have them. Give me the unusual,
whether it's a disease or a gown. I believe I will take you, Clive&mdash;if
you are not expected to live long."</p>

<p>"That's the trouble. Nothing seems to be able to get me."</p>

<p>Dane said as he passed with Peggy: "He's immune, Miss Faithorn.
The prettiest woman I ever saw, he side-stepped in Lima. And even
then every man wanted to shoot him up because she made eyes at
him."</p>

<p>"I think I'll go there," said Cecil. "Her name and quality if
you please, Dane."</p>

<p>"Ask Clive," he called back.</p>

<p>Athalie, still smiling, said: "Shall I ask you, Clive?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask that South American adventurer anything," interrupted
Cecil, "but come and dance this Miraflores with me, Athalie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I don't wish to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come on! You must!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Cecil&mdash;please&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he had his way; and, as usual, everybody watched her while
the charming music lasted, &mdash;Clive among the others, standing
a little apart, lean, erect, his dark gaze fixed.</p>

<p>She came back to him after the dance, delicately flushed and
a trifle breathless.</p>

<p>"Do you dance that in England?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It's danced&mdash;not at Court functions, I believe."</p>

<p>"You never did care to dance, did you?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;" he shrugged, "I used to mess about some."</p>

<p>"And what do you do to amuse yourself in these days?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;much."</p>

<p>"You must do <em>something</em>, Clive!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes ... I travel,&mdash;go about."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"That's about all."</p>

<p>She had stepped aside to let the dancers pass; he moved with
her.</p>

<p>She said in a low, even voice: "Is it pleasant to be back, Clive?"</p>

<p>He nodded in silence.</p>

<p>"Nothing has changed very much since you went away. There's a
new administration at the City Hall, a number of new sky-scrapers
in town; people danced the Tango day before yesterday, the Maxixe
yesterday, the Miraflores to-day, the Orchid to-morrow. That's
about all, Clive."</p>

<p>And as he merely acquiesced in silence, she glanced up sideways
at him, and remained watching this new, sun-browned, lean-visaged
version of the boy she had first known and the boyish man who
had gone out of her life four years before.</p>

<p>"Would you like to see Hafiz?" she asked.</p>

<p>He turned quickly toward her: "Yes," he said, the ghost of a
smile lining the corners of his eyes.</p>

<p>"He's on my bed, asleep. Will you come?"</p>

<p>Slipping along the edges of the dancing floor and stepping daintily
over the rolled rugs, she led the way through the passage to her
rose and ivory bedroom, Clive following.</p>

<p>Hafiz opened his eyes and looked across at them from the pillow,
stood up, his back rounding into a furry arch; yawned, stretched
first one hind leg and then the other, and finally stood, flexing
his forepaws and uttering soft little mews of recognition and
greeting.</p>

<p>"I wonder," she said, smilingly, "if you have any idea how much
Hafiz has meant to me?"</p>

<p>He made no reply; but his face grew sombre and he laid a lean,
muscular hand on the cat's head.</p>

<p>Neither spoke again for a little while. Finally his hand fell
from the appreciative head of Hafiz, dropping inert by his side,
and he stood looking at the floor. Then there was the slightest
touch on his arm, and he turned to go; but she did not move; and
they confronted each other, alone, and after many years.</p>

<p>Suddenly she stretched out both hands, looking him full in the
eyes, her own brilliant with tears:</p>

<p>"I've got you back&mdash;haven't I?" she said unsteadily. But he could
not speak, and stood savagely controlling his quivering lip with
his teeth.</p>

<p>"I just want you as I had you, Clive&mdash;my first boy friend&mdash;who
turned aside from the bright highway of life to speak to a ragged
child.... I have had the boy; I have had the youth; I want the
man, Clive,&mdash;honestly, in perfect innocence.</p>

<p>"Would you care what might be said of us&mdash;as long as we know
our friendship is blameless? I am not taking you from <em>her</em>,
am I? I am not taking anything away from her, am I?</p>

<p>"I have not always played squarely with men. I don't think it
is possible. They have hoped for&mdash;various eventualities. I have
not encouraged them; I have merely let them hope. Which is not
square.</p>

<p>"But I wish always to play square with women. Unless a woman
does, nobody will.... And that is why I ask you, Clive&mdash;am I robbing
her&mdash;if you come back to me&mdash;as you were?&mdash;nothing more&mdash;nothing
less, Clive, but just exactly as you were."</p>

<p>It was impossible for him to control his voice or his words or
even his thoughts just yet; he stood with his lean head turned
partly from her, motionless as a rock, in the desperate grip of
self-mastery, crushing the slender hands that alternately yielded
and clasped his own.</p>

<p>"Oh, Clive," she said, "Clive! You don't know&mdash;you never can
know what loneliness means to such a woman as I am.... I thought
once&mdash;many times&mdash;that I could never again speak to you&mdash;that
I never again could care to hear about you.... But I was wrong,
pitifully wrong.</p>

<p>"It was not jealousy of her, Clive; you know that, don't you?
There had never been any question of such sentiment between you
and me&mdash;excepting once&mdash;one night&mdash;that last night when you said
good-bye&mdash;and you were very much overwrought.</p>

<p>"So it was not jealousy.... It was loneliness. I wanted you,
even if you had fallen in love. That sort of love had nothing
to do with us!</p>

<p>"There was nothing in it that ought to have come between you
and me?... Besides, if such an ephemeral thought ever drifted
through my idle mind, I knew on reflection that you and I could
never be destined to marry, even if such sentiment ever inclined
us. I knew it and accepted it without troubling to analyse the
reasons. I had no desire to invade your world&mdash;less desire now
that I have penetrated it professionally and know a little about
it.</p>

<p>"It was not jealousy, Clive."</p>

<p>He swung around, bent swiftly and pressed his lips to her hands.
And she abandoned them to him with all her heart and soul in an
overwhelming passion of purest emotion.</p>

<p>"I couldn't stand it, Clive," she said, "when I heard you were
at your hotel alone.... And all the unhappiness I had heard of&mdash;your
married life&mdash;I &mdash;I couldn't stand it; I couldn't let you
remain there all alone!</p>

<p>"And when you came here to-night, and I saw in your face how
these four years had altered you&mdash;how it had been with you &mdash;I
wanted you back&mdash;to let you know I am sorry&mdash;to let you know I
care for the man who has known unhappiness, as I cared for the
boy who had known only happiness.</p>

<p>"Do you understand, Clive? Do you, dear? Don't you see what I
see?&mdash;a man standing all alone by a closed door behind which his
hopes lie dead.</p>

<p>"Clive, that is where you came to me, offering sympathy and friendship.
That is where I come to you in my turn, offering whatever you
care to take of me&mdash;if there is in me anything that may comfort
you."</p>

<p>He bent and laid his lips to her hands again, remaining so, curbed
before her; and she looked down at his lean and powerful head
and shoulders, and saw the hint of grey edging the crisp, dark
hair, and the dark stain of tropic suns, that never could be effaced.</p>

<p>So far no passion, other than innocent, had she ever known for
any man,&mdash;nothing of lesser emotion, nothing physical. And, had
she thought of it at all she must have believed that it was that
way with her still. For no thought concerning it disturbed her
tender, tremulous happiness with this man beside her who still
held her hands imprisoned against his breast.</p>

<p>And presently they were seated on the couch at the foot of her
bed, excited, garrulous, exchanging gossip, confidences, ideas
long unuttered, desires long unexpressed.</p>

<p>Under the sweeping flashlight of her intelligence the four years
of his absence were illuminated, and passed swiftly in review
for his inspection. Of loneliness, perplexity, grief, deprivation,
she made light, laughingly, shrugging her smooth young shoulders.</p>

<p>"All that was yesterday," she said. "There is only to-day, now&mdash;until
to-morrow becomes to-day. You won't go away, will you, Clive?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"There is no need of your going, is there?&mdash;no reason for you
to go&mdash;no duty&mdash;moral obligation&mdash;is there, Clive?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't say so just because I wish you to, would you?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be here at all if there were any reason for me to
be&mdash;there."</p>

<p>"Then I am not robbing her of you? &mdash;I am not depriving
her of the tiniest atom of anything that you owe to her? Am I,
Clive?"</p>

<p>"I can't see how. There is only one thing I can do for&mdash;my wife.
And that is to keep away from her."</p>

<p>"Oh, Clive! How desperately sad! And, she is young and beautiful,
isn't she? Oh, I am so sorry for you&mdash;for you both. Don't you
see, dear, that I am not jealous? If you could be happy with her,
and if she could understand me and let me be your friend,&mdash;that
would be wonderful, Clive!"</p>

<p>He remained silent, thinking of Winifred and of her quality of
"understanding"; and of the miserable matter of business which
had made her his wife&mdash;and of his own complacent and smug indifference,
and his contemptible weakness under pressure.</p>

<p>Always in the still and secret depths of him he had remained
conscious that he had never cared for any woman except Athalie.
All else had been but a vague realisation of axioms and theorems,&mdash;of
premises that had rusted into his mind,&mdash;of facts which he accepted
as self-evident,&mdash;such as the immutable fact that he couldn't
marry Athalie, couldn't mortify his family, couldn't defy his
friends, couldn't affront his circle with impunity.</p>

<p>To invite disaster would be to bring an avalanche upon himself
which, if it wounded, isolated, even marooned him, would certainly
bury Athalie out of sight forever.</p>

<p>His parents had so reasoned with him; his mother continued the
inculcation after his father's death. And then Winifred and her
mother came floating into his cosmic ken like two familiar planets.</p>

<p>For a while, far away in interstellar space, Athalie glimmered
like a fading comet. Then orbits narrowed; adhesion and cohesion
followed collision; the bi-maternal pressure never lessened. And
he gave up.</p>

<p>Of this he was thinking now as he sat there in her rose and ivory
room, gazing at the grey silk carpet underfoot; and all the while
exquisitely, vitally conscious of Athalie&mdash;of her nearness to
him&mdash;to tears at moments&mdash;to that happiness akin to tears.</p>

<p>"Clive, do you remember&mdash;" and she breathlessly recalled some
gay and long forgotten incident of that never to be forgotten
winter together when the theatres and restaurants knew them so
well, and the day-world and night-world both credited them with
being to each other everything that they had never been.</p>

<p>"Where will you live?" she asked.</p>

<p>He said: "You know I have sold our old house.... I don't know&mdash;"
He looked at her gravely and ashamed: "I think I will take your
old apartment."</p>

<p>She blushed to her hair: "Were you annoyed with me because I
left it?"</p>

<p>"It hurt."</p>

<p>"But Clive! &mdash;I <em>couldn't</em> remain,&mdash;after you had
become engaged to marry."</p>

<p>"Did you need to leave everything you owned?"</p>

<p>"They were not mine," she said in a low, embarrassed voice.</p>

<p>"Whose then?"</p>

<p>"Yours. I never considered them mine.... As though I were a girl
of little consideration ... who paid herself, philosophically,
for what she had lost.... Like a man's mistress after the inevitable
break has come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't say that!"</p>

<p>She shrugged her pretty shoulders: "I am a woman old enough to
know what the world is, and what women do in it sometimes; and
what men do.... And I am this sort of woman, Clive: I can give,
I can receive, too, but only because of the happiness it bestows
on the giver. And when the sympathy which must exist between giver
and receiver ends, then also possession ends, for me.... Why do
you look at me so seriously?"</p>

<p>But he dared not say. And presently she went on, happily, and
at random: "Of course I kept Hafiz and the first thing you ever
gave me&mdash;the gun-metal wrist-watch. Here it is&mdash;" leaning across
him and pulling out a drawer in her dresser. "I wear it every
day when I am out. It keeps excellent time. Isn't it a darling,
Clive?"</p>

<p>He examined it in silence, nodded, and returned it to her. And
she laid it away again, saying:</p>

<p>"So you think of taking my old apartment? How odd! And how very
sentimental of you, Clive."</p>

<p>He said, forcing a light tone: "Nothing has ever been disturbed
there. It's all as it was when you left. Even your gowns are hanging
in the closets&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Clive!"</p>

<p>"We'll go around if you like. Would you care to see it again?"</p>

<p>"<em>Y&mdash;</em>yes."</p>

<p>"Then we'll go together, and you can investigate closets and
bureaus and dressers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Clive! Why did you let those things remain?"</p>

<p>"I didn't care to have anybody else take that place."</p>

<p>"Do you know that what you have done is absurdly and frightfully
sentimental?"</p>

<p>"Is it?" he said, trying to laugh. "Well that snivelling and
false sort of sentiment is about the best that such men as I know
how to comfort themselves with&mdash;when it's too late for the real
thing."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Just what I am saying. Cheap minds are fed with false sentiment;
and are comforted.... I made out of that place a smug little monument
to you&mdash;while you were living alone and almost penniless in a
shabby rooming house on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Clive! You didn't know that! And anyway it would not have
altered things for me."</p>

<p>"I suppose not.... Well, Athalie; you are very wonderful to me&mdash;merciful,
forgiving, nobly blind &mdash;God!" he muttered under his breath,
"I don't understand how you can be so generous and gentle with
me, &mdash;I don't, indeed."</p>

<p>"If you only knew how easy it is to care for you," she said with
that sweet fearlessness so characteristic of her.</p>

<p>He bit his lips in silence.</p>

<p>Presently she said: "I suppose there'll be gossip in the other
room. Rosalie and Cecil will be cynical and they also will try
to be witty at our expense. But I don't care. Do you?"</p>

<p>"Shall we go in?"</p>

<p>"No.... I haven't had you for four years. If you don't care what
is said about us, I don't." And she looked up at him with the
most engaging candour.</p>

<p>"I'm only thinking about you, Athalie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't bother to, Clive. Pretty nearly everything has been said
about me, I fancy. And, unless it might damage you I'll go anywhere
with you, do anything with you. <em>I</em> know that I'm all right;
and I care no longer what others say or think."</p>

<p>"But you know," he said, "that is a theory which will not work&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are wrong, Clive. Nobody cares what sort of character a
popular actress may have. Her friends are not disturbed by her
reputation; the public crowds to see her. And it's about that
way with me, I imagine. Because I don't suppose many people believe
me to be respectable. Only&mdash;there is no man alive who can say
of his own knowledge that I am not,&mdash;whatever he and his brothers
and sisters may imagine."</p>

<p>"So why should I care?&mdash;as long as the public affords me an honest
living! <em>I</em> know what I am, and have been. And the knowledge,
so far, does not keep me awake at night."</p>

<p>She laughed&mdash;the sweet, fresh, unembarrassed laugh of innocence,&mdash;not
that ignorance and stupidity which is called innocence, but innocence
based on a worldly wisdom which neither her intelligence nor her
experience permitted her to escape.</p>

<p>After a short silence he bent forward and laid one hand on a
crystal which stood clasped by a tiny silver tripod on the table
beside her bed.</p>

<p>"So you did develop your&mdash;qualities&mdash;after all, Athalie."</p>

<p>"Yes.... It happened accidentally." And she told him about the
old gentleman who had come to her rooms when she stood absolutely
penniless and at bay before the world.</p>

<p>After she had ended he asked her whether she had ever again seen
his father. She told him. She told him also about seeing his mother.</p>

<p>"Have they anything to say to me, Athalie?" he asked wistfully.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Clive. Some day&mdash;when you feel like it&mdash;if you
will come to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear ... you are wonderful&mdash;wonderfully good&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Clive, I'm not! I'm careless, pleasure-loving, inclined
to laziness&mdash;and even to dissipation&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>"Within certain limits," she added demurely. "I dance a lot:
I know I smoke too much and drink too much champagne. I'm no angel,
Clive. I won altogether too much at auction last night; ask Jim
Allys. And really, if I didn't have a mind and feel a desire to
cultivate it, I'd be the limit I suppose." She laughed and tossed
her chin; and the pure loveliness of her child-like throat was
suddenly and exquisitely revealed.</p>

<p>"I'm too intelligent to go wrong I suppose," she said. "I adore
cultivating my mental faculties even more than I like to misbehave."
She added a trifle shyly. "I speak French and Italian and German
very nicely. And I sing a little and play acceptably. Please compliment
me, Clive."</p>

<p>But her quick smile died out as she looked into his eyes&mdash;eyes
haunted by the vision of all that he had denied his manhood and
this girl's young womanhood&mdash;all that he had lost, irretrievably
and forever on that day he married another woman.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Clive?" she asked with sweet concern.</p>

<p>He answered: "Nothing, I guess ... except&mdash;you are very&mdash;wonderful&mdash;to
me."</p>
