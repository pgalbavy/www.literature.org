               They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;<br />
               They pursued it with forks and hope;<br />
               They threatened its life with a railway-share;<br />
               They charmed it with smiles and soap.
          <P>
               But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain<br />
               That the Beaver's lace-making was wrong,<br />
               Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain<br />
               That his fancy had dwelt on so long.
          <P>
               He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,<br />
               Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,<br />
               Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig<br />
               On the charge of deserting its sty.
          <P>
               The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,<br />
               That the sty was deserted when found:<br />
               And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law<br />
               In a soft under-current of sound.
          <P>
               The indictment had never been clearly expressed,<br />
               And it seemed that the Snark had begun,<br />
               And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed<br />
               What the pig was supposed to have done.
          <P>
               The Jury had each formed a different view<br />
               (Long before the indictment was read),<br />
               And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew<br />
               One word that the others had said.
          <P>
               "You must know ---" said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed "Fudge!"<br />
               That statute is obsolete quite!<br />
               Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends<br />
               On an ancient manorial right.
          <P>
               "In the matter of Treason the pig would appear<br />
               To have aided, but scarcely abetted:<br />
               While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,<br />
               If you grant the plea 'never indebted.'
          <P>
               "The fact of Desertion I will not dispute;<br />
               But its guilt, as I trust, is removed<br />
               (So far as related to the costs of this suit)<br />
               By the Alibi which has been proved.
          <P>
               "My poor client's fate now depends on you votes."<br />
               Here the speaker sat down in his place,<br />
               And directed the Judge to refer to his notes<br />
               And briefly to sum up the case.
          <P>
               But the Judge said he never had summed up before;<br />
               So the Snark undertook it instead,<br />
               And summed it so well that it came to far more<br />
               Than the Witnesses ever had said!
          <P>
               When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,<br />
               As the word was so puzzling to spell;<br />
               But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn't mind<br />
               Undertaking that duty as well.
          <P>
               So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,<br />
               It was spent with the toils of the day:<br />
               When it said the word "GUILTY!" the Jury all groaned,<br />
               And some of them fainted away.
          <P>
               Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite<br />
               Too nervous to utter a word:<br />
               When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,<br />
               And the fall of a pin might be heard.
          <P>
               "Transportation for life" was the sentence it gave,<br />
               "And *then* to be fined forty pound."<br />
               The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared<br />
               That the phrase was not legally sound.
          <P>
               But their wild exultation was suddenly checked<br />
               When the jailer informed them, with tears,<br />
               Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,<br />
               As the pig had been dead for some years.
          <P>
               The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:<br />
               But the Snark, though a little aghast,<br />
               As the lawyer to whom the defense was entrusted,<br />
               Went bellowing on to the last.
          <P>
               Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed<br />
               To grow every moment more clear:<br />
               Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,<br />
               Which the Bellman rang close at his ear.
