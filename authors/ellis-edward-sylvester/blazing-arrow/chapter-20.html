<p>"Heavens, Larry, you have killed him!" was the horrified exclamation
of Wharton Edwards.</p>

<p>"Be easy now," coolly replied his companion, putting down the
weapon and resuming the paddle; "he isn't hurt."</p>

<p>"Didn't you aim at him?" asked his friend, who, looking back,
saw no signs of injury on the part of the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>"Not so loud," whispered Larry; "he might hear you."</p>

<p>The youth drove the canoe farther out into the lake, but all
the time he kept his head turned so as to see every movement of
the Indian.</p>

<p>Larry had not aimed at him; nothing in the world would have induced
him to shoot the poor, demented creature; but he meant to give
him a good scare, and he succeeded.</p>

<p>Instead of throwing the stone in his hand he dropped it at his
feet, whirled about, and ran for the trees. As he did so he dodged
from side to side like a Digger Indian when trying to distract
the aim of his enemy.</p>

<p>"That's better than killing him," commented Wharton, with a sigh;
"he thinks you intended that shot for him, and he doesn't mean
to give us a second chance."</p>

<p>"But he is taking a second one himself. Look out!"</p>

<p>Wharton saw a shadowy something sailing through the air overhead.
It struck in the water several yards beyond the canoe with a "chung,"
but had gone wide of the mark. From the fringe of shadow the Shawanoe
had hurled another missile, but he had thrown it with such vicious
fierceness that it missed the target altogether.</p>

<p>Before he could repeat the attempt with more care, Larry impelled
the boat beyond his reach, and that particular danger for the
time was past.</p>

<p>"I wonder if he can throw across the lake?" muttered Larry; "keep
a sharp eye on him, for he may begin a bombardment bimeby that
will lay us out."</p>

<p>"We are surely too far off," replied Wharton, surveying the long
space over which they had passed.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they kept a close watch for some demonstration,
which, however, did not take place.</p>

<p>The lake where the canoe now crossed was no more than a furlong
in width, and Larry veered as near to the beginning of the gorge
as was safe, for by so doing he effected considerable gain.</p>

<p>In his eagerness to accomplish this he narrowly missed a fatal
blunder. Ere he was aware, he found himself sweeping toward the
gorge which had caused them so much trouble.</p>

<p>He did not approach nearly so close as the Indian, but only by
the most strenuous exertions was he able to save himself. When
they reached the shore at last he was exhausted.</p>

<p>They were secure, however, and inexpressibly relieved to find
themselves, after all their work and danger, on the other side
of the current which had been so long an impassable barrier in
their path. They had come a long way to do this, and more than
once they asked themselves whether it was not a mistake. But for
their conviction that an ambush had been laid along the trail,
thus compelling a detour, the attempt never would have been made.</p>

<p>It now remained for them to follow the gorge down in the direction
of the falls until they were as near the path as prudent, and
then strike out for the block-house, returning to the trail at
a point beyond where they believed the Shawanoes were awaiting
them.</p>

<p>But they were fatigued at the time they halted for supper, and
they had not gone far when they found themselves so weary and
sleepy that it was hard to drag one foot after another. The ground
was rougher than they supposed, and would have taxed the strength
of stronger persons than they. They were in need of rest and must
have it.</p>

<p>"It can't lack much of daylight," said Wharton, halting where
the rocks were bare and they were near the rushing torrent, "and
we may as well wait until then."</p>

<p>"We haven't gone far," remarked Larry, removing his cap and running
his fingers through his hair, "and we know that we're on the right
course. Do ye mind, too, that we can travel a good many miles
atween this time and sunrise?"</p>

<p>"All right; do you say keep on?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Come on, then."</p>

<p>Wharton wheeled about to continue their journey when his friend
interposed:</p>

<p>"Hold on; I forgot that I am so tired. I can't walk half a dozen
steps more to save me."</p>

<p>Wharton laughed, though he had resolved to keep it up until he
dropped from exhaustion.</p>

<p>They were satisfied with any resting-place. The sultry night
rendered unnecessary any protection, and the rocks themselves
were as comfortable, almost, as a downy couch. The protuberances,
when their caps were laid upon them, afforded excellent pillows,
and five minutes after stretching themselves out both were sound
asleep.</p>

<p>The spot, which had been selected with little thought, was on
the fringe of the wood, which approached to within twenty feet
of the river. The rocks were rough and uneven, but it was easy
to find places that suited their forms. They lay down just within
the shadow thrown out by the trees, where they could not be seen
by any one unless he stumbled over them.</p>

<p>But for their extreme fatigue they would have adopted the ordinary
precaution of kindling a fire, or taking turns in mounting guard
while the other slept. Each, however, knew that he was incapable
of remaining awake, and the attempt was not made.</p>

<p>True, there was danger abroad, but, except in the case of wild
animals, it was as great with as without the fire. It was likely,
indeed, to be greater.</p>

<p>This complete wearing out also of the bodies prevented either
noticing that the course of the moon would soon cause its light
to fall upon their faces, thus bringing them into plain view of
any who might be lurking in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>And it came about that less than an hour had gone by when the
two were discovered. The figure of an Indian appeared moving noiselessly
along the banks of the ravine, almost in their very footsteps.
At every few paces he paused and looked keenly about him, as if
in quest of something.</p>

<p>Suddenly the owner of the canoe, for it was he, halted. Could
any one have seen his face, he would have noticed the frightful
expression of exultation which passed over it, for he was searching
for these two youths and had found them.</p>
