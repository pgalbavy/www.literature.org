<BR>
  HAil holy light, ofspring of Heav'n first-born, <BR>
Or of th' Eternal Coeternal beam <BR>
May I express thee unblam'd? since God is light, <BR>
And never but in unapproached light <BR>
Dwelt from Eternitie, dwelt then in thee, <BR>
Bright effluence of bright essence increate. <BR>
Or hear'st thou rather pure Ethereal stream, <BR>
Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun, <BR>
Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice <BR>
Of God, as with a Mantle didst invest <BR>
The rising world of waters dark and deep, <BR>
Won from the void and formless infinite. <BR>
Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing, <BR>
Escap't the STYGIAN Pool, though long detain'd <BR>
In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight <BR>
Through utter and through middle darkness borne <BR>
With other notes then to th' ORPHEAN Lyre <BR>
I sung of CHAOS and ETERNAL NIGHT, <BR>
Taught by the heav'nly Muse to venture down <BR>
The dark descent, and up to reascend, <BR>
Though hard and rare: thee I revisit safe, <BR>
And feel thy sovran vital Lamp; but thou <BR>
Revisit'st not these eyes, that rowle in vain <BR>
To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn; <BR>
So thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs, <BR>
Or dim suffusion veild.  Yet not the more <BR>
Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt <BR>
Cleer Spring, or shadie Grove, or Sunnie Hill, <BR>
Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief <BR>
Thee SION and the flowrie Brooks beneath <BR>
That wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow, <BR>
Nightly I visit: nor somtimes forget <BR>
Those other two equal'd with me in Fate, <BR>
So were I equal'd with them in renown, <BR>
Blind THAMYRIS and blind MAEONIDES, <BR>
And TIRESIAS and PHINEUS Prophets old. <BR>
Then feed on thoughts, that voluntarie move <BR>
Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful Bird <BR>
Sings darkling, and in shadiest Covert hid <BR>
Tunes her nocturnal Note.  Thus with the Year <BR>
Seasons return, but not to me returns <BR>
Day, or the sweet approach of Ev'n or Morn, <BR>
Or sight of vernal bloom, or Summers Rose, <BR>
Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine; <BR>
But cloud in stead, and ever-during dark <BR>
Surrounds me, from the chearful waies of men <BR>
Cut off, and for the book of knowledg fair <BR>
Presented with a Universal blanc <BR>
Of Natures works to mee expung'd and ras'd, <BR>
And wisdome at one entrance quite shut out. <BR>
So much the rather thou Celestial light <BR>
Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers <BR>
Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence <BR>
Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell <BR>
Of things invisible to mortal sight. <BR>
<BR>
  Now had the Almighty Father from above, <BR>
From the pure Empyrean where he sits <BR>
High Thron'd above all highth, bent down his eye, <BR>
His own works and their works at once to view: <BR>
About him all the Sanctities of Heaven <BR>
Stood thick as Starrs, and from his sight receiv'd <BR>
Beatitude past utterance; on his right <BR>
The radiant image of his Glory sat, <BR>
His onely Son; On Earth he first beheld <BR>
Our two first Parents, yet the onely two <BR>
Of mankind, in the happie Garden plac't, <BR>
Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love, <BR>
Uninterrupted joy, unrivald love <BR>
In blissful solitude; he then survey'd <BR>
Hell and the Gulf between, and SATAN there <BR>
Coasting the wall of Heav'n on this side Night <BR>
In the dun Air sublime, and ready now <BR>
To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet <BR>
On the bare outside of this World, that seem'd <BR>
Firm land imbosom'd without Firmament, <BR>
Uncertain which, in Ocean or in Air. <BR>
Him God beholding from his prospect high, <BR>
Wherein past, present, future he beholds, <BR>
Thus to his onely Son foreseeing spake. <BR>
<BR>
  Onely begotten Son, seest thou what rage <BR>
Transports our adversarie, whom no bounds <BR>
Prescrib'd, no barrs of Hell, nor all the chains <BR>
Heapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss <BR>
Wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems <BR>
On desperat revenge, that shall redound <BR>
Upon his own rebellious head.  And now <BR>
Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way <BR>
Not farr off Heav'n, in the Precincts of light, <BR>
Directly towards the new created World, <BR>
And Man there plac't, with purpose to assay <BR>
If him by force he can destroy, or worse, <BR>
By som false guile pervert; and shall pervert; <BR>
For man will heark'n to his glozing lyes, <BR>
And easily transgress the sole Command, <BR>
Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall <BR>
Hee and his faithless Progenie: whose fault? <BR>
Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee <BR>
All he could have; I made him just and right, <BR>
Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall. <BR>
Such I created all th' Ethereal Powers <BR>
And Spirits, both them who stood &amp; them who faild; <BR>
Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell. <BR>
Not free, what proof could they have givn sincere <BR>
Of true allegiance, constant Faith or Love, <BR>
Where onely what they needs must do, appeard, <BR>
Not what they would? what praise could they receive? <BR>
What pleasure I from such obedience paid, <BR>
When Will and Reason (Reason also is choice) <BR>
Useless and vain, of freedom both despoild, <BR>
Made passive both, had servd necessitie, <BR>
Not mee.  They therefore as to right belongd, <BR>
So were created, nor can justly accuse <BR>
Thir maker, or thir making, or thir Fate; <BR>
As if Predestination over-rul'd <BR>
Thir will, dispos'd by absolute Decree <BR>
Or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed <BR>
Thir own revolt, not I: if I foreknew, <BR>
Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault, <BR>
Which had no less prov'd certain unforeknown. <BR>
So without least impulse or shadow of Fate, <BR>
Or aught by me immutablie foreseen, <BR>
They trespass, Authors to themselves in all <BR>
Both what they judge and what they choose; for so <BR>
I formd them free, and free they must remain, <BR>
Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change <BR>
Thir nature, and revoke the high Decree <BR>
Unchangeable, Eternal, which ordain'd <BR>
Thir freedom, they themselves ordain'd thir fall. <BR>
The first sort by thir own suggestion fell, <BR>
Self-tempted, self-deprav'd: Man falls deceiv'd <BR>
By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace, <BR>
The other none: in Mercy and Justice both, <BR>
Through Heav'n and Earth, so shall my glorie excel, <BR>
But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine. <BR>
<BR>
  Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill'd <BR>
All Heav'n, and in the blessed Spirits elect <BR>
Sense of new joy ineffable diffus'd: <BR>
Beyond compare the Son of God was seen <BR>
Most glorious, in him all his Father shon <BR>
Substantially express'd, and in his face <BR>
Divine compassion visibly appeerd, <BR>
Love without end, and without measure Grace, <BR>
Which uttering thus he to his Father spake. <BR>
<BR>
  O Father, gracious was that word which clos'd <BR>
Thy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace; <BR>
For which both Heav'n and Earth shall high extoll <BR>
Thy praises, with th' innumerable sound <BR>
Of Hymns and sacred Songs, wherewith thy Throne <BR>
Encompass'd shall resound thee ever blest. <BR>
For should Man finally be lost, should Man <BR>
Thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest Son <BR>
Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joynd <BR>
With his own folly? that be from thee farr, <BR>
That farr be from thee, Father, who art Judge <BR>
Of all things made, and judgest onely right. <BR>
Or shall the Adversarie thus obtain <BR>
His end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfill <BR>
His malice, and thy goodness bring to naught, <BR>
Or proud return though to his heavier doom, <BR>
Yet with revenge accomplish't and to Hell <BR>
Draw after him the whole Race of mankind, <BR>
By him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self <BR>
Abolish thy Creation, and unmake, <BR>
For him, what for thy glorie thou hast made? <BR>
So should thy goodness and thy greatness both <BR>
Be questiond and blaspheam'd without defence. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom the great Creatour thus reply'd. <BR>
O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight, <BR>
Son of my bosom, Son who art alone <BR>
My word, my wisdom, and effectual might, <BR>
All hast thou spok'n as my thoughts are, all <BR>
As my Eternal purpose hath decreed: <BR>
Man shall not quite be lost, but sav'd who will, <BR>
Yet not of will in him, but grace in me <BR>
Freely voutsaft; once more I will renew <BR>
His lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthrall'd <BR>
By sin to foul exorbitant desires; <BR>
Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand <BR>
On even ground against his mortal foe, <BR>
By me upheld, that he may know how frail <BR>
His fall'n condition is, and to me ow <BR>
All his deliv'rance, and to none but me. <BR>
Some I have chosen of peculiar grace <BR>
Elect above the rest; so is my will: <BR>
The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd <BR>
Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes <BR>
Th' incensed Deitie, while offerd grace <BR>
Invites; for I will cleer thir senses dark, <BR>
What may suffice, and soft'n stonie hearts <BR>
To pray, repent, and bring obedience due. <BR>
To prayer, repentance, and obedience due, <BR>
Though but endevord with sincere intent, <BR>
Mine eare shall not be slow, mine eye not shut. <BR>
And I will place within them as a guide <BR>
My Umpire CONSCIENCE, whom if they will hear, <BR>
Light after light well us'd they shall attain, <BR>
And to the end persisting, safe arrive. <BR>
This my long sufferance and my day of grace <BR>
They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste; <BR>
But hard be hard'nd, blind be blinded more, <BR>
That they may stumble on, and deeper fall; <BR>
And none but such from mercy I exclude. <BR>
But yet all is not don; Man disobeying, <BR>
Disloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinns <BR>
Against the high Supremacie of Heav'n, <BR>
Affecting God-head, and so loosing all, <BR>
To expiate his Treason hath naught left, <BR>
But to destruction sacred and devote, <BR>
He with his whole posteritie must die, <BR>
Die hee or Justice must; unless for him <BR>
Som other able, and as willing, pay <BR>
The rigid satisfaction, death for death. <BR>
Say Heav'nly Powers, where shall we find such love, <BR>
Which of ye will be mortal to redeem <BR>
Mans mortal crime, and just th' unjust to save, <BR>
Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare? <BR>
<BR>
  He ask'd, but all the Heav'nly Quire stood mute, <BR>
And silence was in Heav'n: on mans behalf <BR>
Patron or Intercessor none appeerd, <BR>
Much less that durst upon his own head draw <BR>
The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set. <BR>
And now without redemption all mankind <BR>
Must have bin lost, adjudg'd to Death and Hell <BR>
By doom severe, had not the Son of God, <BR>
In whom the fulness dwels of love divine, <BR>
His dearest mediation thus renewd. <BR>
<BR>
  Father, thy word is past, man shall find grace; <BR>
And shall grace not find means, that finds her way, <BR>
The speediest of thy winged messengers, <BR>
To visit all thy creatures, and to all <BR>
Comes unprevented, unimplor'd, unsought, <BR>
Happie for man, so coming; he her aide <BR>
Can never seek, once dead in sins and lost; <BR>
Attonement for himself or offering meet, <BR>
Indebted and undon, hath none to bring: <BR>
Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life <BR>
I offer, on mee let thine anger fall; <BR>
Account mee man; I for his sake will leave <BR>
Thy bosom, and this glorie next to thee <BR>
Freely put off, and for him lastly die <BR>
Well pleas'd, on me let Death wreck all his rage; <BR>
Under his gloomie power I shall not long <BR>
Lie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to possess <BR>
Life in my self for ever, by thee I live, <BR>
Though now to Death I yeild, and am his due <BR>
All that of me can die, yet that debt paid, <BR>
Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave <BR>
His prey, nor suffer my unspotted Soule <BR>
For ever with corruption there to dwell; <BR>
But I shall rise Victorious, and subdue <BR>
My Vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile; <BR>
Death his deaths wound shall then receive, &amp; stoop <BR>
Inglorious, of his mortall sting disarm'd. <BR>
I through the ample Air in Triumph high <BR>
Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and show <BR>
The powers of darkness bound.  Thou at the sight <BR>
Pleas'd, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile, <BR>
While by thee rais'd I ruin all my Foes, <BR>
Death last, and with his Carcass glut the Grave: <BR>
Then with the multitude of my redeemd <BR>
Shall enter Heaven long absent, and returne, <BR>
Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud <BR>
Of anger shall remain, but peace assur'd, <BR>
And reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more <BR>
Thenceforth, but in thy presence Joy entire. <BR>
<BR>
  His words here ended, but his meek aspect <BR>
Silent yet spake, and breath'd immortal love <BR>
To mortal men, above which only shon <BR>
Filial obedience: as a sacrifice <BR>
Glad to be offer'd, he attends the will <BR>
Of his great Father.  Admiration seis'd <BR>
All Heav'n, what this might mean, &amp; whither tend <BR>
Wondring; but soon th' Almighty thus reply'd: <BR>
<BR>
  O thou in Heav'n and Earth the only peace <BR>
Found out for mankind under wrauth, O thou <BR>
My sole complacence! well thou know'st how dear, <BR>
To me are all my works, nor Man the least <BR>
Though last created, that for him I spare <BR>
Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save, <BR>
By loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost. <BR>
Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeeme, <BR>
Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyne; <BR>
And be thy self Man among men on Earth, <BR>
Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed, <BR>
By wondrous birth: Be thou in ADAMS room <BR>
The Head of all mankind, though ADAMS Son. <BR>
As in him perish all men, so in thee <BR>
As from a second root shall be restor'd, <BR>
As many as are restor'd, without thee none. <BR>
His crime makes guiltie all his Sons, thy merit <BR>
Imputed shall absolve them who renounce <BR>
Thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds, <BR>
And live in thee transplanted, and from thee <BR>
Receive new life.  So Man, as is most just, <BR>
Shall satisfie for Man, be judg'd and die, <BR>
And dying rise, and rising with him raise <BR>
His Brethren, ransomd with his own dear life. <BR>
So Heav'nly love shal outdoo Hellish hate, <BR>
Giving to death, and dying to redeeme, <BR>
So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate <BR>
So easily destroy'd, and still destroyes <BR>
In those who, when they may, accept not grace. <BR>
Nor shalt thou by descending to assume <BR>
Mans Nature, less'n or degrade thine owne. <BR>
Because thou hast, though Thron'd in highest bliss <BR>
Equal to God, and equally enjoying <BR>
God-like fruition, quitted all to save <BR>
A World from utter loss, and hast been found <BR>
By Merit more then Birthright Son of God, <BR>
Found worthiest to be so by being Good, <BR>
Farr more then Great or High; because in thee <BR>
Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds, <BR>
Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt <BR>
With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne; <BR>
Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reigne <BR>
Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man, <BR>
Anointed universal King; all Power <BR>
I give thee, reign for ever, and assume <BR>
Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream <BR>
Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce: <BR>
All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide <BR>
In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell; <BR>
When thou attended gloriously from Heav'n <BR>
Shalt in the Skie appeer, and from thee send <BR>
The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime <BR>
Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Windes <BR>
The living, and forthwith the cited dead <BR>
Of all past Ages to the general Doom <BR>
Shall hast'n, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep. <BR>
Then all thy Saints assembl'd, thou shalt judge <BR>
Bad men and Angels, they arraignd shall sink <BR>
Beneath thy Sentence; Hell, her numbers full, <BR>
Thenceforth shall be for ever shut.  Mean while <BR>
The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring <BR>
New Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell <BR>
And after all thir tribulations long <BR>
See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds, <BR>
With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth. <BR>
Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by, <BR>
For regal Scepter then no more shall need, <BR>
God shall be All in All.  But all ye Gods, <BR>
Adore him, who to compass all this dies, <BR>
Adore the Son, and honour him as mee. <BR>
<BR>
  No sooner had th' Almighty ceas't, but all <BR>
The multitude of Angels with a shout <BR>
Loud as from numbers without number, sweet <BR>
As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav'n rung <BR>
With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna's fill'd <BR>
Th' eternal Regions: lowly reverent <BR>
Towards either Throne they bow, &amp; to the ground <BR>
With solemn adoration down they cast <BR>
Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold, <BR>
Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once <BR>
In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life <BR>
Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence <BR>
To Heav'n remov'd where first it grew, there grows, <BR>
And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life, <BR>
And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heavn <BR>
Rowls o're ELISIAN Flours her Amber stream; <BR>
With these that never fade the Spirits Elect <BR>
Bind thir resplendent locks inwreath'd with beams, <BR>
Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright <BR>
Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shon <BR>
Impurpl'd with Celestial Roses smil'd. <BR>
Then Crown'd again thir gold'n Harps they took, <BR>
Harps ever tun'd, that glittering by their side <BR>
Like Quivers hung, and with Praeamble sweet <BR>
Of charming symphonie they introduce <BR>
Thir sacred Song, and waken raptures high; <BR>
No voice exempt, no voice but well could joine <BR>
Melodious part, such concord is in Heav'n. <BR>
<BR>
  Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent, <BR>
Immutable, Immortal, Infinite, <BR>
Eternal King; thee Author of all being, <BR>
Fountain of Light, thy self invisible <BR>
Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st <BR>
Thron'd inaccessible, but when thou shad'st <BR>
The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud <BR>
Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine, <BR>
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer, <BR>
Yet dazle Heav'n, that brightest Seraphim <BR>
Approach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes. <BR>
Thee next they sang of all Creation first, <BR>
Begotten Son, Divine Similitude, <BR>
In whose conspicuous count'nance, without cloud <BR>
Made visible, th' Almighty Father shines, <BR>
Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee <BR>
Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides, <BR>
Transfus'd on thee his ample Spirit rests. <BR>
Hee Heav'n of Heavens and all the Powers therein <BR>
By thee created, and by thee threw down <BR>
Th' aspiring Dominations: thou that day <BR>
Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare, <BR>
Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook <BR>
Heav'ns everlasting Frame, while o're the necks <BR>
Thou drov'st of warring Angels disarraid. <BR>
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime <BR>
Thee only extold, Son of thy Fathers might, <BR>
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes, <BR>
Not so on Man; him through their malice fall'n, <BR>
Father of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not doome <BR>
So strictly, but much more to pitie encline: <BR>
No sooner did thy dear and onely Son <BR>
Perceive thee purpos'd not to doom frail Man <BR>
So strictly, but much more to pitie enclin'd, <BR>
He to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife <BR>
Of Mercy and Justice in thy face discern'd, <BR>
Regardless of the Bliss wherein hee sat <BR>
Second to thee, offerd himself to die <BR>
For mans offence.  O unexampl'd love, <BR>
Love no where to be found less then Divine! <BR>
Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name <BR>
Shall be the copious matter of my Song <BR>
Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise <BR>
Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoine. <BR>
<BR>
  Thus they in Heav'n, above the starry Sphear, <BR>
Thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent. <BR>
Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe <BR>
Of this round World, whose first convex divides <BR>
The luminous inferior Orbs, enclos'd <BR>
From CHAOS and th' inroad of Darkness old, <BR>
SATAN alighted walks: a Globe farr off <BR>
It seem'd, now seems a boundless Continent <BR>
Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night <BR>
Starless expos'd, and ever-threatning storms <BR>
Of CHAOS blustring round, inclement skie; <BR>
Save on that side which from the wall of Heav'n <BR>
Though distant farr som small reflection gaines <BR>
Of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud: <BR>
Here walk'd the Fiend at large in spacious field. <BR>
As when a Vultur on IMAUS bred, <BR>
Whose snowie ridge the roving TARTAR bounds, <BR>
Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey <BR>
To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids <BR>
On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs <BR>
Of GANGES or HYDASPES, INDIAN streams; <BR>
But in his way lights on the barren plaines <BR>
Of SERICANA, where CHINESES drive <BR>
With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light: <BR>
So on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend <BR>
Walk'd up and down alone bent on his prey, <BR>
Alone, for other Creature in this place <BR>
Living or liveless to be found was none, <BR>
None yet, but store hereafter from the earth <BR>
Up hither like Aereal vapours flew <BR>
Of all things transitorie and vain, when Sin <BR>
With vanity had filld the works of men: <BR>
Both all things vain, and all who in vain things <BR>
Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame, <BR>
Or happiness in this or th' other life; <BR>
All who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits <BR>
Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal, <BR>
Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find <BR>
Fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds; <BR>
All th' unaccomplisht works of Natures hand, <BR>
Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt, <BR>
Dissolvd on earth, fleet hither, and in vain, <BR>
Till final dissolution, wander here, <BR>
Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd; <BR>
Those argent Fields more likely habitants, <BR>
Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold <BR>
Betwixt th' Angelical and Human kinde: <BR>
Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born <BR>
First from the ancient World those Giants came <BR>
With many a vain exploit, though then renownd: <BR>
The builders next of BABEL on the Plain <BR>
Of SENNAAR, and still with vain designe <BR>
New BABELS, had they wherewithall, would build: <BR>
Others came single; hee who to be deemd <BR>
A God, leap'd fondly into AETNA flames, <BR>
EMPEDOCLES, and hee who to enjoy <BR>
PLATO'S ELYSIUM, leap'd into the Sea, <BR>
CLEOMBROTUS, and many more too long, <BR>
Embryo's and Idiots, Eremits and Friers <BR>
White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie. <BR>
Here Pilgrims roam, that stray'd so farr to seek <BR>
In GOLGOTHA him dead, who lives in Heav'n; <BR>
And they who to be sure of Paradise <BR>
Dying put on the weeds of DOMINIC, <BR>
Or in FRANCISCAN think to pass disguis'd; <BR>
They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt, <BR>
And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs <BR>
The Trepidation talkt, and that first mov'd; <BR>
And now Saint PETER at Heav'ns Wicket seems <BR>
To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot <BR>
Of Heav'ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe <BR>
A violent cross wind from either Coast <BR>
Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry <BR>
Into the devious Air; then might ye see <BR>
Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost <BR>
And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads, <BR>
Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls, <BR>
The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft <BR>
Fly o're the backside of the World farr off <BR>
Into a LIMBO large and broad, since calld <BR>
The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown <BR>
Long after, now unpeopl'd, and untrod; <BR>
All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he pass'd, <BR>
And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame <BR>
Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste <BR>
His travell'd steps; farr distant hee descries <BR>
Ascending by degrees magnificent <BR>
Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high, <BR>
At top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd <BR>
The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate <BR>
With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold <BR>
Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes <BR>
The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth <BR>
By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn. <BR>
The Stairs were such as whereon JACOB saw <BR>
Angels ascending and descending, bands <BR>
Of Guardians bright, when he from ESAU fled <BR>
To PADAN-ARAM in the field of LUZ, <BR>
Dreaming by night under the open Skie, <BR>
And waking cri'd, This is the Gate of Heav'n. <BR>
Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood <BR>
There alwaies, but drawn up to Heav'n somtimes <BR>
Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flow'd <BR>
Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, whereon <BR>
Who after came from Earth, sayling arriv'd, <BR>
Wafted by Angels, or flew o're the Lake <BR>
Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds. <BR>
The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare <BR>
The Fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate <BR>
His sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss. <BR>
Direct against which op'nd from beneath, <BR>
Just o're the blissful seat of Paradise, <BR>
A passage down to th' Earth, a passage wide, <BR>
Wider by farr then that of after-times <BR>
Over Mount SION, and, though that were large, <BR>
Over the PROMIS'D LAND to God so dear, <BR>
By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes, <BR>
On high behests his Angels to and fro <BR>
Pass'd frequent, and his eye with choice regard <BR>
From PANEAS the fount of JORDANS flood <BR>
To BEERSABA, where the HOLY LAND <BR>
Borders on AEGYPT and the ARABIAN shoare; <BR>
So wide the op'ning seemd, where bounds were set <BR>
To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave. <BR>
SATAN from hence now on the lower stair <BR>
That scal'd by steps of Gold to Heav'n Gate <BR>
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view <BR>
Of all this World at once.  As when a Scout <BR>
Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone <BR>
All night; at last by break of chearful dawne <BR>
Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill, <BR>
Which to his eye discovers unaware <BR>
The goodly prospect of some forein land <BR>
First-seen, or some renownd Metropolis <BR>
With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd, <BR>
Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams. <BR>
Such wonder seis'd, though after Heaven seen, <BR>
The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis'd <BR>
At sight of all this World beheld so faire. <BR>
Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood <BR>
So high above the circling Canopie <BR>
Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point <BR>
Of LIBRA to the fleecie Starr that bears <BR>
ANDROMEDA farr off ATLANTICK Seas <BR>
Beyond th' HORIZON; then from Pole to Pole <BR>
He views in bredth, and without longer pause <BR>
Down right into the Worlds first Region throws <BR>
His flight precipitant, and windes with ease <BR>
Through the pure marble Air his oblique way <BR>
Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon <BR>
Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds, <BR>
Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles, <BR>
Like those HESPERIAN Gardens fam'd of old, <BR>
Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales, <BR>
Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there <BR>
He stayd not to enquire: above them all <BR>
The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven <BR>
Allur'd his eye: Thither his course he bends <BR>
Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe <BR>
By center, or eccentric, hard to tell, <BR>
Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie <BR>
Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick, <BR>
That from his Lordly eye keep distance due, <BR>
Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move <BR>
Thir Sarry dance in numbers that compute <BR>
Days, months, and years, towards his all-chearing Lamp <BR>
Turn swift their various motions, or are turnd <BR>
By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms <BR>
The Univers, and to each inward part <BR>
With gentle penetration, though unseen, <BR>
Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep: <BR>
So wondrously was set his Station bright. <BR>
There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps <BR>
Astronomer in the Sun's lucent Orbe <BR>
Through his glaz'd Optic Tube yet never saw. <BR>
The place he found beyond expression bright, <BR>
Compar'd with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone; <BR>
Not all parts like, but all alike informd <BR>
Which radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire; <BR>
If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer; <BR>
If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite, <BR>
Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon <BR>
In AARONS Brest-plate, and a stone besides <BR>
Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen, <BR>
That stone, or like to that which here below <BR>
Philosophers in vain so long have sought, <BR>
In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde <BR>
Volatil HERMES, and call up unbound <BR>
In various shapes old PROTEUS from the Sea, <BR>
Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme. <BR>
What wonder then if fields and regions here <BR>
Breathe forth ELIXIR pure, and Rivers run <BR>
Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch <BR>
Th' Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote <BR>
Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt <BR>
Here in the dark so many precious things <BR>
Of colour glorious and effect so rare? <BR>
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met <BR>
Undazl'd, farr and wide his eye commands, <BR>
For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, <BR>
But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon <BR>
Culminate from th' AEQUATOR, as they now <BR>
Shot upward still direct, whence no way round <BR>
Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire, <BR>
No where so cleer, sharp'nd his visual ray <BR>
To objects distant farr, whereby he soon <BR>
Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand, <BR>
The same whom JOHN saw also in the Sun: <BR>
His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid; <BR>
Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar <BR>
Circl'd his Head, nor less his Locks behind <BR>
Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings <BR>
Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy'd <BR>
Hee seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep. <BR>
Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope <BR>
To find who might direct his wandring flight <BR>
To Paradise the happie seat of Man, <BR>
His journies end and our beginning woe. <BR>
But first he casts to change his proper shape, <BR>
Which else might work him danger or delay: <BR>
And now a stripling Cherube he appeers, <BR>
Not of the prime, yet such as in his face <BR>
Youth smil'd Celestial, and to every Limb <BR>
Sutable grace diffus'd, so well he feignd; <BR>
Under a Coronet his flowing haire <BR>
In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore <BR>
Of many a colourd plume sprinkl'd with Gold, <BR>
His habit fit for speed succinct, and held <BR>
Before his decent steps a Silver wand. <BR>
He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright, <BR>
Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd, <BR>
Admonisht by his eare, and strait was known <BR>
Th' Arch-Angel URIEL, one of the seav'n <BR>
Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne <BR>
Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes <BR>
That run through all the Heav'ns, or down to th' Earth <BR>
Bear his swift errands over moist and dry, <BR>
O're Sea and Land: him SATAN thus accostes; <BR>
<BR>
  URIEL, for thou of those seav'n Spirits that stand <BR>
In sight of God's high Throne, gloriously bright, <BR>
The first art wont his great authentic will <BR>
Interpreter through highest Heav'n to bring, <BR>
Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend; <BR>
And here art likeliest by supream decree <BR>
Like honour to obtain, and as his Eye <BR>
To visit oft this new Creation round; <BR>
Unspeakable desire to see, and know <BR>
All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man, <BR>
His chief delight and favour, him for whom <BR>
All these his works so wondrous he ordaind, <BR>
Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim <BR>
Alone thus wandring.  Brightest Seraph tell <BR>
In which of all these shining Orbes hath Man <BR>
His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none, <BR>
But all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell; <BR>
That I may find him, and with secret gaze, <BR>
Or open admiration him behold <BR>
On whom the great Creator hath bestowd <BR>
Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd; <BR>
That both in him and all things, as is meet, <BR>
The Universal Maker we may praise; <BR>
Who justly hath drivn out his Rebell Foes <BR>
To deepest Hell, and to repair that loss <BR>
Created this new happie Race of Men <BR>
To serve him better: wise are all his wayes. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake the false dissembler unperceivd; <BR>
For neither Man nor Angel can discern <BR>
Hypocrisie, the only evil that walks <BR>
Invisible, except to God alone, <BR>
By his permissive will, through Heav'n and Earth: <BR>
And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps <BR>
At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie <BR>
Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill <BR>
Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil'd <BR>
URIEL, though Regent of the Sun, and held <BR>
The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav'n; <BR>
Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule <BR>
In his uprightness answer thus returnd. <BR>
Faire Angel, thy desire which tends to know <BR>
The works of God, thereby to glorifie <BR>
The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess <BR>
That reaches blame, but rather merits praise <BR>
The more it seems excess, that led thee hither <BR>
From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone, <BR>
To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps <BR>
Contented with report heare onely in heav'n: <BR>
For wonderful indeed are all his works, <BR>
Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all <BR>
Had in remembrance alwayes with delight; <BR>
But what created mind can comprehend <BR>
Thir number, or the wisdom infinite <BR>
That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep. <BR>
I saw when at his Word the formless Mass, <BR>
This worlds material mould, came to a heap: <BR>
Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar <BR>
Stood rul'd, stood vast infinitude confin'd; <BR>
Till at his second bidding darkness fled, <BR>
Light shon, and order from disorder sprung: <BR>
Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then <BR>
The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire, <BR>
And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav'n <BR>
Flew upward, spirited with various forms, <BR>
That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs <BR>
Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move; <BR>
Each had his place appointed, each his course, <BR>
The rest in circuit walles this Universe. <BR>
Look downward on that Globe whose hither side <BR>
With light from hence, though but reflected, shines; <BR>
That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light <BR>
His day, which else as th' other Hemisphere <BR>
Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon <BR>
(So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide <BR>
Timely interposes, and her monthly round <BR>
Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav'n; <BR>
With borrowd light her countenance triform <BR>
Hence fills and empties to enlighten th' Earth, <BR>
And in her pale dominion checks the night. <BR>
That spot to which I point is PARADISE, <BR>
ADAMS abode, those loftie shades his Bowre. <BR>
Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires. <BR>
<BR>
  Thus said, he turnd, and SATAN bowing low, <BR>
As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven, <BR>
Where honour due and reverence none neglects, <BR>
Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath, <BR>
Down from th' Ecliptic, sped with hop'd success, <BR>
Throws his steep flight with many an Aerie wheele, <BR>
Nor staid, till on NIPHATES top he lights. <BR>
<BR>
