<p>Worrell, the traitor, had been gone nearly an hour from the cavern
in which the three fugitives were sleeping, when Rosa Minturn
awoke, no doubt because she was not so much in need of sleep as
the others, and held a lingering suspicion of the loyalty of the
man who had brought them to the retreat. This distrust went to
sleep with her, but it is a peculiarity of the mind that the emotions
which have been with us through our waking hours frequently remain
with us when we are wrapped in slumber. It is as if the innumerable
train that is forever wending its way through the mysterious labyrinths
of the brain repeats the procession, and those which affected
us the most strongly when in command of our senses often do the
same when we are unconscious. But without stopping to consider
the question, suffice it to say that at the time mentioned Rosa
opened her eyes in full possession of her faculties, and with
the impression that the man Worrell was an enemy instead of a
friend.</p>

<p>She did not move at first, supposing he was still within the
cavern; but, as she peered cautiously around the dimly lighted
space, she saw only the forms of her two sleeping friends. The
fact at once deepened the suspicion, and caused her great distress
of mind, for all doubt of the hostility of the man was removed
upon making the discovery. Still she supposed it possible that
he was close at hand, and waited several minutes to see whether
he reappeared; but her condition of mind was such that every second
of delay caused her increasing uneasiness.</p>

<p>"I am sure he has gone to tell Colonel Butler and the Indians
where we are," she said to herself, as she rose and walked to
where her brother was asleep.</p>

<p>Stooping over, she shook him by the shoulder until he opened
his eyes and, recognizing her, asked what the matter was.</p>

<p>"That man has gone."</p>

<p>"Where has he gone?"</p>

<p>"To tell the Indians we are here!"</p>

<p>Jo sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about, Rosa? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Just as I say; he has gone to bring the Indians, and will soon
be back, too."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me, but I <em>know</em> what I say."</p>

<p>This was alarming news, and though Jo suspected his sister based
all upon her dislike of the man, without positive knowledge of
the facts, yet he was impressed with the belief that she had good
cause for her words.</p>

<p>"He may be on the outside, keeping watch," said the youth, after
they had talked over the matter. "Wait till I take a look. If
he can't be found, we'll awake Ned."</p>

<p>Jo crept out of the cavern dreading a hostile shot as he did
so, and made as thorough an examination of the surroundings as
was possible. He saw nothing of the man whom they missed, that
individual at that moment being a quarter of a mile or more away,
holding his vehement argument with Captain Bagley about the advance
with the six Iroquois upon the sleeping fugitives. His invisibility
confirmed the young man in his misgivings as to the treachery
of the man.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt Rosa is right," he muttered, as he walked thoughtfully
back toward the cavern. "She was always quick to detect anything
like that, and it is strange that neither Ned nor I had any such
thought. The only thing that troubled us was whether we could
convince Lena-Wingo we did right in leaving the place where he
left us. The thought never entered our heads that there was anything
of this kind in the wind."</p>

<p>He had reached the mouth of the cavern again, where his sister
was anxiously waiting him.</p>

<p>"Did you find anything of him?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered, with a shake of the head. "I believe you are
right; the man has gone off somewhere after his promise to keep
watch over us while we slept; that's enough for me. Is Ned awake?"</p>

<p>"Not that I am aware of."</p>

<p>"He must be aroused at once, for it will not do to stay here
after what has taken place."</p>

<p>Jo passed inside and awakened his friend, without pausing to
be very gentle as to the means. It took but a minute to make plain
the trouble. He became as alert and suspicious as they on the
instant.</p>

<p>"There!" he exclaimed; "I had a suspicion when he came under
the tree that I had seen him somewhere."</p>

<p>"So had I, but I couldn't recall where and when it was."</p>

<p>"Don't you remember when the battle was going on the other day,
we saw one man among the Tories who was tomahawking the whites
as savagely as any of them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember him well, but he didn't look like this fellow!"</p>

<p>"Not a great deal, that's true, but I believe it was he for all
that."</p>

<p>Jo was silent for a moment, as if in deep thought.</p>

<p>"There was something about him that reminds me of this fellow,
though one had whiskers and the other had not, and it is hard
to tell just how they resemble each other."</p>

<p>The youths were more anxious to take themselves and Rosa away
from the cavern than they were to discuss the question, upon which
they agreed quite well. Hastily picking up their rifles, they
passed outside. When they found themselves within the shelter
of the wood again, and beyond the vision of any one who might
approach the retreat, the relief was inexpressible.</p>

<p>"We agree that the counsel of Rosa was wise," said Ned Clinton,
as they came to a halt, "but you see how it may be possible she
was mistaken. Now it won't do to go wandering too far from the
place, for when the Mohawk comes back and finds us gone he may
not hunt for us."</p>

<p>"Why not, then, go back over the same route that we followed
in coming here?" asked Jo.</p>

<p>"That is what I would like to do, if it wasn't for the danger;
it seems to me that that is the path which Worrell will take when
he starts for the cavern again with his Indians, and we don't
want to meet him face to face, for we can do that by waiting in
the cavern."</p>

<p>"I have it!" exclaimed Ned. "I will take the back trail alone,
on the lookout for the Mohawk and for the white man, too. What
do you say?"</p>

<p>"And shall Rosa and I wait here till you come back?"</p>

<p>"That will be the safer plan, unless another Worrell comes along
and takes you away to a new cavern or hiding-place."</p>

<p>"We will be as safe here as anywhere," said Rosa, believing that
her opinion would have some weight in the matter.</p>

<p>"I suspect she is right," assented her brother. "If the Iroquois
come to the cavern and find we have left, they will think we have
got as far away as we can, and they won't be apt to look for us
so close at hand; and then, too, these stones over which we have
traveled haven't left any trail for them to follow."</p>

<p>"Which shows why you shouldn't go hunting for some other location,
unless the Indians happen to come so close that you can't help
it, for it will be impossible for me to hunt you up."</p>

<p>This was simple truth, and Jo promised that nothing should be
done to increase the difficulty of their speedy reunion, whenever
his friend should want to find him and Rosa again. The day was
passing and it seemed that they were trifling away the time which
was so valuable to all the fugitives. There was something, too,
in the continued absence of their guide, Lena-Wingo, that caused
them uneasiness. They recalled that he had promised a speedy return,
and it was rarely that the Mohawk made them a promise which was
not fulfilled in spirit and letter.</p>
