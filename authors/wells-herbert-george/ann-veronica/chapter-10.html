"There is only one way out of all this," said Ann Veronica,
sitting up in her little bed in the darkness and biting at her
nails.
<P>
"I thought I was just up against Morningside Park and father, but
it's the whole order of things--the whole blessed order of
things. . . ."
<P>
She shivered.  She frowned and gripped her hands about her knees
very tightly.  Her mind developed into savage wrath at the
present conditions of a woman's life.
<P>
"I suppose all life is an affair of chances.  But a woman's life
is all chance.  It's artificially chance. Find your man, that's
the rule.  All the rest is humbug and delicacy.  He's the handle
of life for you.  He will let you live if it pleases him. . . .
<P>
"Can't it be altered?
<P>
"I suppose an actress is free? . . ."
<P>
She tried to think of some altered state of affairs in which
these monstrous limitations would be alleviated, in which women
would stand on their own feet in equal citizenship with men.  For
a time she brooded on the ideals and suggestions of the
Socialists, on the vague intimations of an Endowment of
Motherhood, of a complete relaxation of that intense individual
dependence for women which is woven into the existing social
order.  At the back of her mind there seemed always one
irrelevant qualifying spectator whose presence she sought to
disregard.  She would not look at him, would not think of him;
when her mind wavered, then she muttered to herself in the
darkness so as to keep hold of her generalizations.
<P>
"It is true.  It is no good waiving the thing; it is true. 
Unless women are never to be free, never to be even respected,
there must be a generation of martyrs. . . .  Why shouldn't we be
martyrs?  There's nothing else for most of us, anyhow.  It's a
sort of blacklegging to want to have a life of one's own. . . ."
<P>
She repeated, as if she answered an objector:  "A sort of
blacklegging.
<P>
"A sex of blacklegging clients."
<P>
Her mind diverged to other aspects, and another type of
womanhood.
<P>
"Poor little Miniver!  What can she be but what she is? . . . 
Because she states her case in a tangle, drags it through swamps
of nonsense, it doesn't alter the fact that she is right."
<P>
That phrase about dragging the truth through swamps of nonsense
she remembered from Capes.  At the recollection that it was his,
she seemed to fall through a thin surface, as one might fall
through the crust of a lava into glowing depths.  She wallowed
for a time in the thought of Capes, unable to escape from his
image and the idea of his presence in her life.
<P>
She let her mind run into dreams of that cloud paradise of an
altered world in which the Goopes and Minivers, the Fabians and
reforming people believed.  Across that world was written in
letters of light, "Endowment of Motherhood."  Suppose in some
complex yet conceivable way women were endowed, were no longer
economically and socially dependent on men.  "If one was free,"
she said, "one could go to him. . . .  This vile hovering to
catch a man's eye! . . .  One could go to him and tell him one
loved him.  I want to love him.  A little love from him would be
enough.  It would hurt no one.  It would not burden him with any
obligation."
<P>
She groaned aloud and bowed her forehead to her knees.  She
floundered deep.  She wanted to kiss his feet.  His feet would
have the firm texture of his hands.
<P>
Then suddenly her spirit rose in revolt.  "I will not have this
slavery," she said.  "I will not have this slavery."
<P>
She shook her fist ceilingward.  "Do you hear!" she said
"whatever you are, wherever you are!  I will not be slave to the
thought of any man, slave to the customs of any time.  Confound
this slavery of sex!  I am a man!  I will get this under if I am
killed in doing it!"
<P>
She scowled into the cold blacknesses about her.
<P>
"Manning," she said, and contemplated a figure of inaggressive
persistence.  "No!"  Her thoughts had turned in a new direction.
<P>
"It doesn't matter," she said, after a long interval, "if they
are absurd.  They mean something.  They mean everything that
women can mean--except submission. The vote is only the
beginning, the necessary beginning.  If we do not begin--"
<P>
She had come to a resolution.  Abruptly she got out of bed,
smoothed her sheet and straightened her pillow and lay down, and
fell almost instantly asleep.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 2
<P>
<P>
The next morning was as dark and foggy as if it was mid-November
instead of early March.  Ann Veronica woke rather later than
usual, and lay awake for some minutes before she remembered a
certain resolution she had taken in the small hours.  Then
instantly she got out of bed and proceeded to dress.
<P>
She did not start for the Imperial College.  She spent the
morning up to ten in writing a series of unsuccessful letters to
Ramage, which she tore up unfinished; and finally she desisted
and put on her jacket and went out into the lamp-lit obscurity
and slimy streets.  She turned a resolute face southward.
<P>
She followed Oxford Street into Holborn, and then she inquired
for Chancery Lane.  There she sought and at last found 107A, one
of those heterogeneous piles of offices which occupy the eastern
side of the lane.  She studied the painted names of firms and
persons and enterprises on the wall, and discovered that the
Women's Bond of Freedom occupied several contiguous suites on the
first floor.  She went up-stairs and hesitated between four doors
with ground-glass panes, each of which professed "The Women's
Bond of Freedom" in neat black letters.  She opened one and found
herself in a large untidy room set with chairs that were a little
disarranged as if by an overnight meeting.  On the walls were
notice-boards bearing clusters of newspaper slips, three or four
big posters of monster meetings, one of which Ann Veronica had
attended with Miss Miniver, and a series of announcements in
purple copying-ink, and in one corner was a pile of banners. 
There was no one at all in this room, but through the half-open
door of one of the small apartments that gave upon it she had a
glimpse of two very young girls sitting at a littered table and
writing briskly.
<P>
She walked across to this apartment and, opening the door a
little wider, discovered a press section of the movement at work.
<P>
"I want to inquire," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
"Next door," said a spectacled young person of seventeen or
eighteen, with an impatient indication of the direction.
<P>
In the adjacent apartment Ann Veronica found a middle-aged woman
with a tired face under the tired hat she wore, sitting at a desk
opening letters while a dusky, untidy girl of eight-or
nine-and-twenty hammered industriously at a typewriter.  The
tired woman looked up in inquiring silence at Ann Veronica's
diffident entry.
<P>
"I want to know more about this movement," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
"Are you with us?" said the tired woman.
<P>
"I don't know," said Ann Veronica; "I think I am. I want very
much to do something for women.  But I want to know what you are
doing."
<P>
The tired woman sat still for a moment.  "You haven't come here
to make a lot of difficulties?" she asked.
<P>
"No," said Ann Veronica, "but I want to know."
<P>
The tired woman shut her eyes tightly for a moment, and then
looked with them at Ann Veronica.  "What can you do?" she asked.
<P>
"Do?"
<P>
"Are you prepared to do things for us?  Distribute bills?  Write
letters?  Interrupt meetings?  Canvass at elections?  Face
dangers?"
<P>
"If I am satisfied--"
<P>
"If we satisfy you?"
<P>
"Then, if possible, I would like to go to prison."
<P>
"It isn't nice going to prison."
<P>
"It would suit me."
<P>
"It isn't nice getting there."
<P>
"That's a question of detail," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
The tired woman looked quietly at her.  "What are your
objections?" she said.
<P>
"It isn't objections exactly.  I want to know what you are doing;
how you think this work of yours really does serve women."
<P>
"We are working for the equal citizenship of men and women," said
the tired woman.  "Women have been and are treated as the
inferiors of men, we want to make them their equals."
<P>
"Yes," said Ann Veronica, "I agree to that.  But--"
<P>
The tired woman raised her eyebrows in mild protest.
<P>
"Isn't the question more complicated than that?" said Ann
Veronica.
<P>
"You could have a talk to Miss Kitty Brett this afternoon, if you
liked.  Shall I make an appointment for you?"
<P>
Miss Kitty Brett was one of the most conspicuous leaders of the
movement.  Ann Veronica snatched at the opportunity, and spent
most of the intervening time in the Assyrian Court of the British
Museum, reading and thinking over a little book upon the feminist
movement the tired woman had made her buy.  She got a bun and
some cocoa in the little refreshment-room, and then wandered
through the galleries up-stairs, crowded with Polynesian idols
and Polynesian dancing-garments, and all the simple immodest
accessories to life in Polynesia, to a seat among the mummies. 
She was trying to bring her problems to a head, and her mind
insisted upon being even more discursive and atmospheric than
usual.  It generalized everything she put to it.
<P>
"Why should women be dependent on men?" she asked; and the
question was at once converted into a system of variations upon
the theme of "Why are things as they are?"--"Why are human beings
viviparous?"--"Why are people hungry thrice a day?"--"Why does
one faint at danger?"
<P>
She stood for a time looking at the dry limbs and still human
face of that desiccated unwrapped mummy from the very beginnings
of social life.  It looked very patient, she thought, and a
little self-satisfied.  It looked as if it had taken its world
for granted and prospered on that assumption--a world in which
children were trained to obey their elders and the wills of women
over-ruled as a matter of course.  It was wonderful to think this
thing had lived, had felt and suffered.  Perhaps once it had
desired some other human being intolerably. Perhaps some one had
kissed the brow that was now so cadaverous, rubbed that sunken
cheek with loving fingers, held that stringy neck with
passionately living hands.  But all of that was forgotten.  "In
the end," it seemed to be thinking, "they embalmed me with the
utmost respect--sound spices chosen to endure--the best!  I took
my world as I found it.  THINGS ARE SO!"
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 3
<P>
<P>
Ann Veronica's first impression of Kitty Brett was that she was
aggressive and disagreeable; her next that she was a person of
amazing persuasive power.  She was perhaps three-and-twenty, and
very pink and healthy-looking, showing a great deal of white and
rounded neck above her business-like but altogether feminine
blouse, and a good deal of plump, gesticulating forearm out of
her short sleeve.  She had animated dark blue-gray eyes under her
fine eyebrows, and dark brown hair that rolled back simply and
effectively from her broad low forehead.  And she was about as
capable of intelligent argument as a runaway steam-roller. She
was a trained being--trained by an implacable mother to one end.
<P>
She spoke with fluent enthusiasm.  She did not so much deal with
Ann Veronica's interpolations as dispose of them with quick and
use-hardened repartee, and then she went on with a fine
directness to sketch the case for her agitation, for that
remarkable rebellion of the women that was then agitating the
whole world of politics and discussion.  She assumed with a kind
of mesmeric force all the propositions that Ann Veronica wanted
her to define.
<P>
"What do we want?  What is the goal?" asked Ann Veronica.
<P>
"Freedom!  Citizenship!  And the way to that--the way to
everything--is the Vote."
<P>
Ann Veronica said something about a general change of ideas.
<P>
"How can you change people's ideas if you have no power?" said
Kitty Brett.
<P>
Ann Veronica was not ready enough to deal with that
counter-stroke .
<P>
"One doesn't want to turn the whole thing into a mere sex
antagonism."
<P>
"When women get justice," said Kitty Brett, "there will be no sex
antagonism.  None at all.  Until then we mean to keep on
hammering away."
<P>
"It seems to me that much of a woman's difficulties are
economic."
<P>
"That will follow," said Kitty Brett--"that will follow."
<P>
She interrupted as Ann Veronica was about to speak again, with a
bright contagious hopefulness.  "Everything will follow," she
said.
<P>
"Yes," said Ann Veronica, trying to think where they were, trying
to get things plain again that had seemed plain enough in the
quiet of the night.
<P>
"Nothing was ever done," Miss Brett asserted, "without a certain
element of Faith.  After we have got the Vote and are recognized
as citizens, then we can come to all these other things."
<P>
Even in the glamour of Miss Brett's assurance it seemed to Ann
Veronica that this was, after all, no more than the gospel of
Miss Miniver with a new set of resonances.  And like that gospel
it meant something, something different from its phrases,
something elusive, and yet something that in spite of the
superficial incoherence of its phrasing, was largely essentially
true. There was something holding women down, holding women back,
and if it wasn't exactly man-made law, man-made law was an aspect
of it.  There was something indeed holding the whole species back
from the imaginable largeness of life. . . .
<P>
"The Vote is the symbol of everything," said Miss Brett.
<P>
She made an abrupt personal appeal.
<P>
"Oh! please don't lose yourself in a wilderness of secondary
considerations," she said.  "Don't ask me to tell you all that
women can do, all that women can be.  There is a new life,
different from the old life of dependence, possible.  If only we
are not divided.  If only we work together.  This is the one
movement that brings women of different classes together for a
common purpose.  If you could see how it gives them souls, women
who have taken things for granted, who have given themselves up
altogether to pettiness and vanity. . . ."
<P>
"Give me something to do," said Ann Veronica, interrupting her
persuasions at last.  "It has been very kind of you to see me,
but I don't want to sit and talk and use your time any longer.  I
want to do something. I want to hammer myself against all this
that pens women in.  I feel that I shall stifle unless I can do
something--and do something soon."
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 4
<P>
<P>
It was not Ann Veronica's fault that the night's work should have
taken upon itself the forms of wild burlesque.  She was in deadly
earnest in everything she did.  It seemed to her the last
desperate attack upon the universe that would not let her live as
she desired to live, that penned her in and controlled her and
directed her and disapproved of her, the same invincible
wrappering, the same leaden tyranny of a universe that she had
vowed to overcome after that memorable conflict with her father
at Morningside Park.
<P>
She was listed for the raid--she was informed it was to be a raid
upon the House of Commons, though no particulars were given
her--and told to go alone to 14, Dexter Street, Westminster, and
not to ask any policeman to direct her.  14, Dexter Street,
Westminster, she found was not a house but a yard in an obscure
street, with big gates and the name of Podgers & Carlo, Carriers
and Furniture Removers, thereon.  She was perplexed by this, and
stood for some seconds in the empty street hesitating, until the
appearance of another circumspect woman under the street lamp at
the corner reassured her.  In one of the big gates was a little
door, and she rapped at this.  It was immediately opened by a man
with light eyelashes and a manner suggestive of restrained
passion.  "Come right in," he hissed under his breath, with the
true conspirator's note, closed the door very softly and pointed,
"Through there!"
<P>
By the meagre light of a gas lamp she perceived a cobbled yard
with four large furniture vans standing with horses and lamps
alight.  A slender young man, wearing glasses, appeared from the
shadow of the nearest van.  "Are you A, B, C, or D?" he asked.
<P>
"They told me D," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
"Through there," he said, and pointed with the pamphlet he was
carrying.
<P>
Ann Veronica found herself in a little stirring crowd of excited
women, whispering and tittering and speaking in undertones.
<P>
The light was poor, so that she saw their gleaming faces dimly
and indistinctly.  No one spoke to her. She stood among them,
watching them and feeling curiously alien to them.  The oblique
ruddy lighting distorted them oddly, made queer bars and patches
of shadow upon their clothes.  "It's Kitty's idea," said one, "we
are to go in the vans."
<P>
"Kitty is wonderful," said another.
<P>
"Wonderful!"
<P>
"I have always longed for prison service," said a voice, "always.
<P>
From the beginning.  But it's only now I'm able to do it."
<P>
A little blond creature close at hand suddenly gave way to a fit
of hysterical laughter, and caught up the end of it with a sob.
<P>
"Before I took up the Suffrage," a firm, flat voice remarked, "I
could scarcely walk up-stairs without palpitations."
<P>
Some one hidden from Ann Veronica appeared to be marshalling the
assembly.  "We have to get in, I think," said a nice little old
lady in a bonnet to Ann Veronica, speaking with a voice that
quavered a little. "My dear, can you see in this light?  I think
I would like to get in.  Which is C?"
<P>
Ann Veronica, with a curious sinking of the heart, regarded the
black cavities of the vans.  Their doors stood open, and placards
with big letters indicated the section assigned to each.  She
directed the little old woman and then made her way to van D.  A
young woman with a white badge on her arm stood and counted the
sections as they entered their vans.
<P>
"When they tap the roof," she said, in a voice of authority, "you
are to come out.  You will be opposite the big entrance in Old
Palace Yard.  It's the public entrance.  You are to make for that
and get into the lobby if you can, and so try and reach the floor
of the House, crying 'Votes for Women!' as you go."
<P>
She spoke like a mistress addressing school-children.
<P>
"Don't bunch too much as you come out," she added.
<P>
"All right?" asked the man with the light eyelashes, suddenly
appearing in the doorway.  He waited for an instant, wasting an
encouraging smile in the imperfect light, and then shut the doors
of the van, leaving the women in darkness. . . .
<P>
The van started with a jerk and rumbled on its way.
<P>
"It's like Troy!" said a voice of rapture.  "It's exactly like Troy!"
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 5
<P>
<P>
So Ann Veronica, enterprising and a little dubious as ever,
mingled with the stream of history and wrote her Christian name
upon the police-court records of the land.
<P>
But out of a belated regard for her father she wrote the surname
of some one else.
<P>
Some day, when the rewards of literature permit the arduous
research required, the Campaign of the Women will find its
Carlyle, and the particulars of that marvellous series of
exploits by which Miss Brett and her colleagues nagged the whole
Western world into the discussion of women's position become the
material for the most delightful and amazing descriptions.  At
present the world waits for that writer, and the confused record
of the newspapers remains the only resource of the curious.  When
he comes he will do that raid of the pantechnicons the justice it
deserves; he will picture the orderly evening scene about the
Imperial Legislature in convincing detail, the coming and going
of cabs and motor-cabs and broughams through the chill, damp
evening into New Palace Yard, the reinforced but untroubled and
unsuspecting police about the entries of those great buildings
whose square and panelled Victorian Gothic streams up from the
glare of the lamps into the murkiness of the night; Big Ben
shining overhead, an unassailable beacon, and the incidental
traffic of Westminster, cabs, carts, and glowing omnibuses going
to and from the bridge.  About the Abbey and Abingdon Street
stood the outer pickets and detachments of the police, their
attention all directed westward to where the women in Caxton
Hall, Westminster, hummed like an angry hive.  Squads reached to
the very portal of that centre of disturbance.  And through all
these defences and into Old Palace Yard, into the very vitals of
the defenders' position, lumbered the unsuspected vans.
<P>
They travelled past the few idle sightseers who had braved the
uninviting evening to see what the Suffragettes might be doing;
they pulled up unchallenged within thirty yards of those coveted
portals.
<P>
And then they disgorged.
<P>
Were I a painter of subject pictures, I would exhaust all my
skill in proportion and perspective and atmosphere upon the
august seat of empire, I would present it gray and dignified and
immense and respectable beyond any mere verbal description, and
then, in vivid black and very small, I would put in those
valiantly impertinent vans, squatting at the base of its
altitudes and pouring out a swift, straggling rush of ominous
little black objects, minute figures of determined women at war
with the universe.
<P>
Ann Veronica was in their very forefront.
<P>
In an instant the expectant calm of Westminster was ended, and
the very Speaker in the chair blenched at the sound of the
policemen's whistles.  The bolder members in the House left their
places to go lobbyward, grinning. Others pulled hats over their
noses, cowered in their seats, and feigned that all was right
with the world.  In Old Palace Yard everybody ran.  They either
ran to see or ran for shelter.  Even two Cabinet Ministers took
to their heels, grinning insincerely.  At the opening of the van
doors and the emergence into the fresh air Ann Veronica's doubt
and depression gave place to the wildest exhilaration.  That same
adventurousness that had already buoyed her through crises that
would have overwhelmed any normally feminine girl with shame and
horror now became uppermost again.  Before her was a great Gothic
portal.  Through that she had to go.
<P>
Past her shot the little old lady in the bonnet, running
incredibly fast, but otherwise still alertly respectable, and she
was making a strange threatening sound as she ran, such as one
would use in driving ducks out of a garden--"B-r-r-r-r-r--!" and
pawing with black-gloved hands.  The policemen were closing in
from the sides to intervene.  The little old lady struck like a
projectile upon the resounding chest of the foremost of these,
and then Ann Veronica had got past and was ascending the steps.
<P>
Then most horribly she was clasped about the waist from behind
and lifted from the ground.
<P>
At that a new element poured into her excitement, an element of
wild disgust and terror.  She had never experienced anything so
disagreeable in her life as the sense of being held helplessly
off her feet.  She screamed involuntarily--she had never in her
life screamed before --and then she began to wriggle and fight
like a frightened animal against the men who were holding her.
<P>
The affair passed at one leap from a spree to a nightmare of
violence and disgust.  Her hair got loose, her hat came over one
eye, and she had no arm free to replace it.  She felt she must
suffocate if these men did not put her down, and for a time they
would not put her down.  Then with an indescribable relief her
feet were on the pavement, and she was being urged along by two
policemen, who were gripping her wrists in an irresistible expert
manner.  She was writhing to get her hands loose and found
herself gasping with passionate violence, "It's
damnable!--damnable!" to the manifest disgust of the fatherly
policeman on her right.
<P>
Then they had released her arms and were trying to push her away.
<P>
"You be off, missie," said the fatherly policeman.  "This ain't
no place for you."
<P>
He pushed her a dozen yards along the greasy pavement with flat,
well-trained hands that there seemed to be no opposing.  Before
her stretched blank spaces, dotted with running people coming
toward her, and below them railings and a statue.  She almost
submitted to this ending of her adventure.  But at the word
"home" she turned again.
<P>
"I won't go home," she said; "I won't!" and she evaded the clutch
of the fatherly policeman and tried to thrust herself past him in
the direction of that big portal. "Steady on!" he cried.
<P>
A diversion was created by the violent struggles of the little
old lady.  She seemed to be endowed with superhuman strength.  A
knot of three policemen in conflict with her staggered toward Ann
Veronica's attendants and distracted their attention.  "I WILL be
arrested! I WON'T go home!" the little old lady was screaming
over and over again.  They put her down, and she leaped at them;
she smote a helmet to the ground.
<P>
"You'll have to take her!" shouted an inspector on horseback, and
she echoed his cry:  "You'll have to take me!"  They seized upon
her and lifted her, and she screamed.  Ann Veronica became
violently excited at the sight.  "You cowards!" said Ann
Veronica, "put her down!" and tore herself from a detaining hand
and battered with her fists upon the big red ear and blue
shoulder of the policeman who held the little old lady.
<P>
So Ann Veronica also was arrested.
<P>
And then came the vile experience of being forced and borne along
the street to the police-station.  Whatever anticipation Ann
Veronica had formed of this vanished in the reality.  Presently
she was going through a swaying, noisy crowd, whose faces grinned
and stared pitilessly in the light of the electric standards. 
"Go it, miss!" cried one.  "Kick aht at 'em!" though, indeed, she
went now with Christian meekness, resenting only the thrusting
policemen's hands.  Several people in the crowd seemed to be
fighting.  Insulting cries became frequent and various, but for
the most part she could not understand what was said.  "Who'll
mind the baby nar?" was one of the night's inspirations, and very
frequent.  A lean young man in spectacles pursued her for some
time, crying "Courage!  Courage!"  Somebody threw a dab of mud at
her, and some of it got down her neck.  Immeasurable disgust
possessed her.  She felt draggled and insulted beyond redemption.
<P>
She could not hide her face.  She attempted by a sheer act of
will to end the scene, to will herself out of it anywhere.  She
had a horrible glimpse of the once nice little old lady being
also borne stationward, still faintly battling and very
muddy--one lock of grayish hair straggling over her neck, her
face scared, white, but triumphant.  Her bonnet dropped off and
was trampled into the gutter. A little Cockney recovered it, and
made ridiculous attempts to get to her and replace it.
<P>
"You must arrest me!" she gasped, breathlessly, insisting
insanely on a point already carried; "you shall!"
<P>
The police-station at the end seemed to Ann Veronica like a
refuge from unnamable disgraces.  She hesitated about her name,
and, being prompted, gave it at last as Ann Veronica Smith, 107A,
Chancery Lane. . . .
<P>
Indignation carried her through that night, that men and the
world could so entreat her.  The arrested women were herded in a
passage of the Panton Street Police-station that opened upon a
cell too unclean for occupation, and most of them spent the night
standing. Hot coffee and cakes were sent in to them in the
morning by some intelligent sympathizer, or she would have
starved all day.  Submission to the inevitable carried her
through the circumstances of her appearance before the
magistrate.
<P>
He was no doubt doing his best to express the attitude of society
toward these wearily heroic defendants, but he seemed to be
merely rude and unfair to Ann Veronica.  He was not, it seemed,
the proper stipendiary at all, and there had been some demur to
his jurisdiction that had ruffled him.  He resented being
regarded as irregular.  He felt he was human wisdom prudentially
interpolated. . . .  "You silly wimmin," he said over and over
again throughout the hearing, plucking at his blotting-pad with
busy hands.  "You silly creatures!  Ugh!  Fie upon you!"  The
court was crowded with people, for the most part supporters and
admirers of the defendants, and the man with the light eyelashes
was conspicuously active and omnipresent.
<P>
Ann Veronica's appearance was brief and undistinguished.  She had
nothing to say for herself.  She was guided into the dock and
prompted by a helpful police inspector.  She was aware of the
body of the court, of clerks seated at a black table littered
with papers, of policemen standing about stiffly with expressions
of conscious integrity, and a murmuring background of the heads
and shoulders of spectators close behind her. On a high chair
behind a raised counter the stipendiary's substitute regarded her
malevolently over his glasses. A disagreeable young man, with red
hair and a loose mouth, seated at the reporter's table, was only
too manifestly sketching her.
<P>
She was interested by the swearing of the witnesses. The kissing
of the book struck her as particularly odd, and then the
policemen gave their evidence in staccato jerks and stereotyped
phrases.
<P>
"Have you anything to ask the witness?" asked the helpful
inspector.
<P>
The ribald demons that infested the back of Ann Veronica's mind
urged various facetious interrogations upon her, as, for example,
where the witness had acquired his prose style.  She controlled
herself, and answered meekly, "No."
<P>
"Well, Ann Veronica Smith," the magistrate remarked when the case
was all before him, "you're a good-looking, strong, respectable
gell, and it's a pity you silly young wimmin can't find something
better to do with your exuberance.  Two-and-twenty! I can't
imagine what your parents can be thinking about to let you get
into these scrapes."
<P>
Ann Veronica's mind was filled with confused unutterable replies.
<P>
"You are persuaded to come and take part in these outrageous
proceedings--many of you, I am convinced, have no idea whatever
of their nature.  I don't suppose you could tell me even the
derivation of suffrage if I asked you.  No! not even the
derivation!  But the fashion's been set and in it you must be."
<P>
The men at the reporter's table lifted their eyebrows, smiled
faintly, and leaned back to watch how she took her scolding.  One
with the appearance of a bald little gnome yawned agonizingly. 
They had got all this down already--they heard the substance of
it now for the fourteenth time.  The stipendiary would have done
it all very differently.
<P>
She found presently she was out of the dock and confronted with
the alternative of being bound over in one surety for the sum of
forty pounds--whatever that might mean or a month's imprisonment.
<P>
"Second class," said some one, but first and second were all
alike to her.  She elected to go to prison.
<P>
At last, after a long rumbling journey in a stuffy windowless
van, she reached Canongate Prison--for Holloway had its quota
already.  It was bad luck to go to Canongate.
<P>
Prison was beastly.  Prison was bleak without spaciousness, and
pervaded by a faint, oppressive smell; and she had to wait two
hours in the sullenly defiant company of two unclean women
thieves before a cell could be assigned to her.  Its dreariness,
like the filthiness of the police cell, was a discovery for her.
She had imagined that prisons were white-tiled places, reeking of
lime-wash and immaculately sanitary. Instead, they appeared to be
at the hygienic level of tramps' lodging-houses.  She was bathed
in turbid water that had already been used.  She was not allowed
to bathe herself: another prisoner, with a privileged manner,
washed her.  Conscientious objectors to that process are not
permitted, she found, in Canongate. Her hair was washed for her
also.  Then they dressed her in a dirty dress of coarse serge and
a cap, and took away her own clothes.  The dress came to her only
too manifestly unwashed from its former wearer; even the
under-linen they gave her seemed unclean.  Horrible memories of
things seen beneath the microscope of the baser forms of life
crawled across her mind and set her shuddering with imagined
irritations.  She sat on the edge of the bed--the wardress was
too busy with the flood of arrivals that day to discover that she
had it down--and her skin was shivering from the contact of these
garments.  She surveyed accommodation that seemed at first merely
austere, and became more and more manifestly inadequate as the
moments fled by. She meditated profoundly through several
enormous cold hours on all that had happened and all that she had
done since the swirl of the suffrage movement had submerged her
personal affairs. . . .
<P>
Very slowly emerging out of a phase of stupefaction, these
personal affairs and her personal problem resumed possession of
her mind.  She had imagined she had drowned them altogether.
