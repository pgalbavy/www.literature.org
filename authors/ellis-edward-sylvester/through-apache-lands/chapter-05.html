"To Tom Hardynge:<br/>
&mdash;The stage which left Santa Fe on the 10th inst.,<br/>
is due at Fort Havens between the 20th and 25th, <em>but it will never<br/>
reach there</em>. It has an escort of a dozen mounted soldiers, but<br/>
they can't save it. The Apaches have arranged to attack it near<br/>
Devil's Pass, which you know is about a hundred miles northeast<br/>
from this point, among the mountains. You can't do anything to help<br/>
it; but Ned Chadmund is with it, and his father, the colonel,<br/>
offers you and me a thousand dollars apiece to save <em>him</em>. I leave<br/>
to day<br/>
&mdash;Thursday&mdash;for the pass, and you must follow the minute your<br/>
eyes see this. I will be on the lookout for you. Remember there<br/>
isn't an hour to spare.

<p>
"Dick Morris."

</p>
</div>
<p>Colonel Chadmund was the commandant at Fort Havens, whither he
was hastening with his news from the Indian country. His family
dwelt in Santa Fe, and his only child, a bright boy, about a dozen
years of age, had been permitted to start to join his father in
accordance with a promise made him a long time before. The escort
with which he had been provided would have been ample under ordinary
circumstances, and in fact, was larger than was generally customary;
but it was not sufficient.</p>

<p>Dick Morris held a position then known as "hunter to the fort"
at the post under the command of Colonel Chadmund. It was similar
to that which the renowned Kit Carson filled for a number of years
in the old days at Bent's Fort. The man was selected on account
of his skill in the use of the rifle, and his knowledge of the
habits of the game, his duty being simply to supply the command
with all the fresh food possible&mdash;a position which, it will at
once be understood, was no sinecure, involving constant activity
and many long, rapid journeys.</p>

<p>Dick was as skillful and shrewd a man as could be found in the
whole Southwest. Tom Hardynge, his friend and companion in many
a perilous adventure, understood what it all meant the instant
he had finished reading the writing upon the buffalo skin. By
some means&mdash;probably through the Indian runners encountered while
hunting his game&mdash;he had learned the particulars of the expedition
that had been arranged to attack and massacre the escort. Very
probably these swarthy wretches were mainly incited to the deed
by the knowledge that the son of Colonel Chadmund was to be with
the party. It was under the direction of this vigilant officer
that the marauding Indians of the border had received such a number
of severe blows. They were excited to the highest point of exasperation,
and would seize upon any means of revenge at their command.</p>

<p>Alarmed by the danger which threatened his beloved child, the
colonel had sent Dick Morris to the rescue at once. He would have
sent a hundred men from his fort, had he believed it possible
that they could do any good, but it was clearly out of the question
for them to reach Devil's Pass until nearly twenty-four hours
after the stage was due there. It was one of those cases wherein
all depended upon shrewdness and strategy, and where nothing was
to be gained by mere force of arms. The expectation was that the
Apaches would hold the boy at an enormous ransom, or probably
as a hostage for the safety of such of their blood-stained chiefs
as were in the hands of the Americans. This will explain the haste
of the hunter, and his anxiety to have the companionship of Tom,
who had tramped so many hundred miles through the Indian country.</p>

<p>Ten minutes after reading the dispatch Tom had fastened on the
accoutrements of his mustang and was galloping away to the northeast
on the trail of his friend. He did not pause even to hunt a little
game, after having been so long without food. He was accustomed
to privation and hardship, and, if it were required, was good
for twenty-four hours longer without permitting a particle of
food to pass his lips.</p>

<p>He was leaving the treacherous Gila far to the south. It may
be said that his course along this stream, on his return from
the Apache country, was like the base of a triangle, while he
was now following the hypothenuse. This latter route was preferable
in every sense to that which he had been using for the last few
days. The country itself was more varied, better watered and abounded
with vegetation, its only drawback being the ever-present danger
from the marauding redskins. Another advantage that belonged to
the traveler over this path was that it was really a path&mdash;so
clearly defined that a stranger could follow it without trouble.
It was, in fact, the trail between Fort Havens and Santa Fe, over
which, at certain intervals, messengers were regularly dispatched
back and forth.</p>

<p>The money with which the soldiers at Fort Havens and several
other posts were paid came down by express from Sante Fe over
this road, in charge of a proper escort, and the coach which started
from that city with little Ned Chadmund carried also one hundred
thousand dollars in crisp, crackling greenbacks stowed away in
the bottom of the vehicle. Consequently it will be seen that the
Apaches, who understood very well the value of these printed slips,
had every inciting cause to organize an overwhelming expedition
against the coach and its escort.</p>

<p>The day is waning, but his steed was fresh and fleet, and had
enjoyed such a long rest, that it would be a mercy to him to put
him through his best paces. Tom did not hesitate to do it. The
glossy black animal gave a neigh of delight as he felt the familiar
hand of his master upon the bridle, and he stretched away like
one of the Arabian coursers of the desert, fleet as the wind and
capable of keeping up the tremendous rate of speed for hours at
a time.</p>

<p>The greater portion of this journey led through the wildest mountain
scenery, and the afternoon was scarcely half gone when a striking
change in the surface was observable. Instead of that long, dreary
expanse of endless prairie, the hunter was forced to make long
detours to escape the obstructions constantly interposing in the
way. Now it was around some pile of rocks, then winding among
a mass of hills, then over a level plain for some distance, but
with the scenery steadily increasing in ruggedness at every mile
traversed. Far ahead could be discerned the chain of mountains,
their peaks looking blue and misty in the distance. It was among
these that the trail wound its way&mdash;one portion, in the very heart
of the mountains, being known as Devil's Pass, from its wild and
dangerous character; and, as the scout strained his eye in the
direction and contemplated the blue waving line against the sky,
he almost fancied he could see the smoke from the rifles of the
vengeful Apaches.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't wonder if they are at it this very minute," he muttered,
as he glanced down at the ground in front of him.</p>

<p>All the afternoon, as he sped along, he saw constantly in front
of him the footprints of another mustang, such as are made by
an animal when under full speed. So they were, as he knew very
well. Dick Morris had been over the same trail a few hours before,
at scarcely less speed than his own.</p>

<p>Every time Tom came in sight of an elevation he looked hastily
at it in the hope of catching sight of some signal from his friend.
In such a desperate enterprise as this he felt the need of companionship,
especially of such a tried and daring man as Dick Morris. But
the sun gradually went down in the western sky without bringing
him the coveted sight, and he began to believe that he would not
be overtaken before reaching Devil's Pass, which he hoped to reach
on the morrow. Then, as the sun disappeared and darkness crept
over mountain and prairie, Tom turned the head of his animal in
the direction of a clump of trees where he knew there was an abundance
of grass and water, and where, in all probability, something in
the way of food could be had for himself. The mustang needed rest
and refreshment, and the rider required them scarcely less.</p>
