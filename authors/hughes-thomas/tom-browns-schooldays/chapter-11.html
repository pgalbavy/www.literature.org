<blockquote>&quot;And Heaven's rich instincts in him grew<br>
As effortless as woodland nooks<br>
Send violets up and paint them blue.&quot;<br>&mdash;LOWELL.</blockquote>
<P>I do not mean to recount all the little troubles and annoyances
which thronged upon Tom at the beginning of this half-year, in
his new character of bear-leader to a gentle little boy straight
from home.  He seemed to himself to have become a new boy again,
without any of the long-suffering and meekness indispensable for
supporting that character with moderate success.  From morning
till night he had the feeling of responsibility on his mind, and
even if he left Arthur in their study or in the close for an
hour, was never at ease till he had him in sight again.  He
waited for him at the doors of the school after every lesson and
every calling-over; watched that no tricks were played him, and
none but the regulation questions asked; kept his eye on his
plate at dinner and breakfast, to see that no unfair
depredations were made upon his viands; in short, as East
remarked, cackled after him like a hen with one chick.</P>
<P>Arthur took a long time thawing, too, which made it all the
harder work; was sadly timid; scarcely ever spoke unless Tom
spoke to him first; and, worst of all, would agree with him in
everything - the hardest thing in the world for a Brown to bear.
He got quite angry sometimes, as they sat together of a night in
their study, at this provoking habit of agreement, and was on
the point of breaking out a dozen times with a lecture upon the
propriety of a fellow having a will of his own and speaking out,
but managed to restrain himself by the thought that he might
only frighten Arthur, and the remembrance of the lesson he had
learnt from him on his first night at Number 4.  Then he would
resolve to sit still and not say a word till Arthur began; but
he was always beat at that game, and had presently to begin
talking in despair, fearing lest Arthur might think he was vexed
at something if he didn't, and dog-tired of sitting tongue-tied.</P>
<P>It was hard work.  But Tom had taken it up, and meant to stick
to it, and go through with it so as to satisfy himself; in which
resolution he was much assisted by the chafing of East and his
other old friends, who began to call him &quot;dry-nurse,&quot; and
otherwise to break their small wit on him.  But when they took
other ground, as they did every now and then, Tom was sorely
puzzled.</P>
<P>&quot;Tell you what, Tommy,&quot; East would say; &quot;you'll spoil young
Hopeful with too much coddling.  Why can't you let him go about
by himself and find his own level?  He'll never be worth a
button if you go on keeping him under your skirts.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, but he ain't fit to fight his own way yet; I'm trying to
get him to it every day, but he's very odd.  Poor little beggar!
I can't make him out a bit.  He ain't a bit like anything I've
ever seen or heard of - he seems all over nerves; anything you
say seems to hurt him like a cut or a blow.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That sort of boy's no use here,&quot; said East; &quot;he'll only spoil.
Now I'll tell you what to do, Tommy.  Go and get a nice large
band-box made, and put him in with plenty of cotton-wool and a
pap-bottle, labelled 'With care - this side up,' and send him
back to mamma.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I think I shall make a hand of him though,&quot; said Tom, smiling,
&quot;say what you will.  There's something about him, every now and
then, which shows me he's got pluck somewhere in him.  That's
the only thing after all that'll wash, ain't it, old Scud?  But
how to get at it and bring it out?&quot;</P>
<P>Tom took one hand out of his breeches-pocket and stuck it in his
back hair for a scratch, giving his hat a tilt over his nose,
his one method of invoking wisdom.  He stared at the ground with
a ludicrously puzzled look, and presently looked up and met
East's eyes.  That young gentleman slapped him on the back, and
then put his arm round his shoulder, as they strolled through
the quadrangle together.  &quot;Tom,&quot; said he, &quot;blest if you ain't
the best old fellow ever was.  I do like to see you go into a
thing.  Hang it, I wish I could take things as you do; but I
never can get higher than a joke.  Everything's a joke.  If I
was going to be flogged next minute, I should be in a blue funk,
but I couldn't help laughing at it for the life of me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Brown and East, you go and fag for Jones on the great fives
court.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hullo, though, that's past a joke,&quot; broke out East, springing
at the young gentleman who addressed them, and catching him by
the collar.  - &quot;Here, Tommy, catch hold of him t'other side
before he can holla.&quot;</P>
<P>The youth was seized, and dragged, struggling, out of the
quadrangle into the School-house hall.  He was one of the
miserable little pretty white-handed, curly-headed boys, petted
and pampered by some of the big fellows, who wrote their verses
for them, taught them to drink and use bad language, and did all
they could to spoil them for everything * in this world and the
next.  One of the avocations in which these young gentlemen took
particular delight was in going about and getting fags for their
protectors, when those heroes were playing any game.  They
carried about pencil and paper with them, putting down the names
of all the boys they sent, always sending five times as many as
were wanted, and getting all those thrashed who didn't go.  The
present youth belonged to a house which was very jealous of the
School-house, and always picked out School-house fags when he
could find them.  However, this time he'd got the wrong sow by
the ear.  His captors slammed the great door of the hall, and
East put his back against it, while Tom gave the prisoner a
shake up, took away his list, and stood him up on the floor,
while he proceeded leisurely to examine that document.
<blockquote>* A kind and wise critic, an old Rugboean, notes here in the
margin:  &quot;The small friend system was not so utterly bad from
1841-1847.&quot;  Before that, too, there were many noble friendships
between big and little boys; but I can't strike out the passage.
Many boys will know why it is left in.</blockquote>
<P>&quot;Let me out, let me go!&quot;  screamed the boy, in a furious
passion.  &quot;I'll go and tell Jones this minute, and he'll give
you both the  - - thrashing you ever had.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Pretty little dear,&quot; said East, patting the top of his hat.  - 
&quot;Hark how he swears, Tom.  Nicely brought up young man, ain't
he, I don't think.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let me alone,  - - you,&quot; roared the boy, foaming with rage, and
kicking at East, who quietly tripped him up, and deposited him
on the floor in a place of safety.</P>
<P>&quot;Gently, young fellow,&quot; said he; &quot;'tain't improving for little
whippersnappers like you to be indulging in blasphemy; so you
stop that, or you'll get something you won't like.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'll have you both licked when I get out, that I will,&quot;
rejoined the boy, beginning to snivel.</P>
<P>&quot;Two can play at that game, mind you,&quot; said Tom, who had
finished his examination of the list.  &quot;Now you just listen
here.  We've just come across the fives court, and Jones has
four fags there already - two more than he wants.  If he'd
wanted us to change, he'd have stopped us himself.  And here,
you little blackguard, you've got seven names down on your list
besides ours, and five of them School-house.&quot;  Tom walked up to
him, and jerked him on to his legs; he was by this time whining
like a whipped puppy.  &quot;Now just listen to me.  We ain't going
to fag for Jones.  If you tell him you've sent us, we'll each of
us give you such a thrashing as you'll remember.&quot;  And Tom tore
up the list and threw the pieces into the fire.</P>
<P>&quot;And mind you, too,&quot; said East, &quot;don't let me catch you again
sneaking about the School-house, and picking up our fags.  You
haven't got the sort of hide to take a sound licking kindly.&quot;
And he opened the door and sent the young gentleman flying into
the quadrangle with a parting kick.</P>
<P>&quot;Nice boy, Tommy,&quot; said East, shoving his hands in his pockets,
and strolling to the fire.</P>
<P>&quot;Worst sort we breed,&quot; responded Tom, following his example.
&quot;Thank goodness, no big fellow ever took to petting me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You'd never have been like that,&quot; said East.  &quot;I should like to
have put him in a museum:  Christian young gentleman, nineteenth
century, highly educated.  Stir him up with a long pole, Jack,
and hear him swear like a drunken sailor.  He'd make a
respectable public open its eyes, I think.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Think he'll tell Jones?&quot; said Tom.</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; said East.  &quot;Don't care if he does.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nor I,&quot; said Tom.  And they went back to talk about Arthur.</P>
<P>The young gentleman had brains enough not to tell Jones,
reasoning that East and Brown, who were noted as some of the
toughest fags in the School, wouldn't care three straws for any
licking Jones might give them, and would be likely to keep their
words as to passing it on with interest.</P>
<P>After the above conversation, East came a good deal to their
study, and took notice of Arthur, and soon allowed to Tom that
he was a thorough little gentleman, and would get over his
shyness all in good time; which much comforted our hero.  He
felt every day, too, the value of having an object in his life - 
something that drew him out of himself; and it being the dull
time of the year, and no games going about for which he much
cared, was happier than he had ever yet been at school, which
was saying a great deal.</P>
<P>The time which Tom allowed himself away from his charge was from
locking-up till supper-time.  During this hour or hour and a
half he used to take his fling, going round to the studies of
all his acquaintance, sparring or gossiping in the hall, now
jumping the old iron-bound tables, or carving a bit of his name
on them, then joining in some chorus of merry voices - in fact,
blowing off his steam, as we should now call it.</P>
<P>This process was so congenial to his temper, and Arthur showed
himself so pleased at the arrangement, that it was several weeks
before Tom was ever in their study before supper.  One evening,
however, he rushed in to look for an old chisel, or some corks,
or other article essential to his pursuit for the time being,
and while rummaging about in the cupboards, looked up for a
moment, and was caught at once by the figure of poor little
Arthur.  The boy was sitting with his elbows on the table, and
his head leaning on his hands, and before him an open book, on
which his tears were falling fast.  Tom shut the door at once,
and sat down on the sofa by Arthur, putting his arm round his
neck.</P>
<P>&quot;Why, young un, what's the matter?&quot; said he kindly; &quot;you ain't
unhappy, are you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh no, Brown,&quot; said the little boy, looking up with the great
tears in his eyes; &quot;you are so kind to me, I'm very happy.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why don't you call me Tom?  Lots of boys do that I don't like
half so much as you.  What are you reading, then?  Hang it! you
must come about with me, and not mope yourself.&quot;  And Tom cast
down his eyes on the book, and saw it was the Bible.  He was
silent for a minute, and thought to himself, &quot;Lesson Number 2,
Tom Brown;&quot; and then said gently, &quot;I'm very glad to see this,
Arthur, and ashamed that I don't read the Bible more myself.  Do
you read it every night before supper while I'm out?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I wish you'd wait till afterwards, and then we'd read
together.  But, Arthur, why does it make you cry?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, it isn't that I'm unhappy.  But at home, while my father
was alive, we always read the lessons after tea; and I love to
read them over now, and try to remember what he said about them.
I can't remember all and I think I scarcely understand a great
deal of what I do remember.  But it all comes back to me so
fresh that I can't help crying sometimes to think I shall never
read them again with him.&quot;</P>
<P>Arthur had never spoken of his home before, and Tom hadn't
encouraged him to do so, as his blundering schoolboy reasoning
made him think that Arthur would be softened and less manly for
thinking of home.  But now he was fairly interested, and forgot
all about chisels and bottled beer; while with very little
encouragement Arthur launched into his home history, and the
prayer-bell put them both out sadly when it rang to call them to
the hall.</P>
<P>From this time Arthur constantly spoke of his home, and above
all, of his father, who had been dead about a year, and whose
memory Tom soon got to love and reverence almost as much as his
own son did.</P>
<P>Arthur's father had been the clergyman of a parish in the
Midland counties, which had risen into a large town during the
war, and upon which the hard years which followed had fallen
with fearful weight.  The trade had been half ruined; and then
came the old, sad story, of masters reducing their
establishments, men turned off and wandering about, hungry and
wan in body, and fierce in soul, from the thought of wives and
children starving at home, and the last sticks of furniture
going to the pawnshop; children taken from school, and lounging
about the dirty streets and courts, too listless almost to play,
and squalid in rags and misery; and then the fearful struggle
between the employers and men - lowerings of wages, strikes, and
the long course of oft-repeated crime, ending every now and then
with a riot, a fire, and the county yeomanry.  There is no need
here to dwell upon such tales:  the Englishman into whose soul
they have not sunk deep is not worthy the name.  You English
boys, for whom this book is meant (God bless your bright faces
and kind hearts!), will learn it all soon enough.</P>
<P>Into such a parish and state of society Arthur's father had been
thrown at the age of twenty-five - a young married parson, full
of faith, hope, and love.  He had battled with it like a man,
and had lots of fine Utopian ideas about the perfectibility of
mankind, glorious humanity, and such-like, knocked out of his
head, and a real, wholesome Christian love for the poor,
struggling, sinning men, of whom he felt himself one, and with
and for whom he spent fortune, and strength, and life, driven
into his heart.  He had battled like a man, and gotten a man's
reward - no silver tea-pots or salvers, with flowery
inscriptions setting forth his virtues and the appreciation of a
genteel parish; no fat living or stall, for which he never
looked, and didn't care; no sighs and praises of comfortable
dowagers and well-got-up young women, who worked him slippers,
sugared his tea, and adored him as &quot;a devoted man;&quot; but a manly
respect, wrung from the unwilling souls of men who fancied his
order their natural enemies; the fear and hatred of every one
who was false or unjust in the district, were he master or man;
and the blessed sight of women and children daily becoming more
human and more homely, a comfort to themselves and to their
husbands and fathers.</P>
<P>These things, of course, took time, and had to be fought for
with toil and sweat of brain and heart, and with the life-blood
poured out.  All that, Arthur had laid his account to give, and
took as a matter of course, neither pitying himself, nor looking
on himself as a martyr, when he felt the wear and tear making
him feel old before his time, and the stifling air of fever-dens
telling on his health.  His wife seconded him in everything.
She had been rather fond of society, and much admired and run
after before her marriage; and the London world to which she had
belonged pitied poor Fanny Evelyn when she married the young
clergyman, and went to settle in that smoky hole Turley; a very
nest of Chartism and Atheism, in a part of the country which all
the decent families had had to leave for years.  However,
somehow or other she didn't seem to care.  If her husband's
living had been amongst green fields and near pleasant
neighbours she would have liked it better - that she never
pretended to deny.  But there they were.  The air wasn't bad,
after all; the people were very good sort of people - civil to
you if you were civil to them, after the first brush; and they
didn't expect to work miracles, and convert them all off-hand
into model Christians.  So he and she went quietly among the
folk, talking to and treating them just as they would have done
people of their own rank.  They didn't feel that they were doing
anything out of the common way, and so were perfectly natural,
and had none of that condescension or consciousness of manner
which so outrages the independent poor.  And thus they gradually
won respect and confidence; and after sixteen years he was
looked up to by the whole neighbourhood as the just man, the man
to whom masters and men could go in their strikes, and in all
their quarrels and difficulties, and by whom the right and true
word would be said without fear or favour.  And the women had
come round to take her advice, and go to her as a friend in all
their troubles; while the children all worshipped the very
ground she trod on.</P>
<P>They had three children, two daughters and a son, little Arthur,
who came between his sisters.  He had been a very delicate boy
from his childhood; they thought he had a tendency to
consumption, and so he had been kept at home and taught by his
father, who had made a companion of him, and from whom he had
gained good scholarship, and a knowledge of and interest in many
subjects which boys in general never come across till they are
many years older.</P>
<P>Just as he reached his thirteenth year, and his father had
settled that he was strong enough to go to school, and, after
much debating with himself, had resolved to send him there, a
desperate typhus fever broke out in the town.  Most of the other
clergy, and almost all the doctors, ran away; the work fell with
tenfold weight on those who stood to their work.  Arthur and his
wife both caught the fever, of which he died in a few days; and
she recovered, having been able to nurse him to the end, and
store up his last words.  He was sensible to the last, and calm
and happy, leaving his wife and children with fearless trust for
a few years in the hands of the Lord and Friend who had lived
and died for him, and for whom he, to the best of his power, had
lived and died.  His widow's mourning was deep and gentle.  She
was more affected by the request of the committee of a
freethinking club, established in the town by some of the
factory hands (which he had striven against with might and main,
and nearly suppressed), that some of their number might be
allowed to help bear the coffin, than by anything else.  Two of
them were chosen, who, with six other labouring men, his own
fellow-workmen and friends, bore him to his grave - a man who
had fought the Lord's fight even unto the death.  The shops were
closed and the factories shut that day in the parish, yet no
master stopped the day's wages; but for many a year afterwards
the townsfolk felt the want of that brave, hopeful, loving
parson and his wife, who had lived to teach them mutual
forbearance and helpfulness, and had almost at last given them a
glimpse of what this old world would be if people would live for
God and each other instead of for themselves.</P>
<P>What has all this to do with our story?  Well, my dear boys, let
a fellow go on his own way, or you won't get anything out of him
worth having.  I must show you what sort of a man it was who had
begotten and trained little Arthur, or else you won't believe in
him, which I am resolved you shall do; and you won't see how he,
the timid, weak boy, had points in him from which the bravest
and strongest recoiled, and made his presence and example felt
from the first on all sides, unconsciously to himself, and
without the least attempt at proselytizing.  The spirit of his
father was in him, and the Friend to whom his father had left
him did not neglect the trust.</P>
<P>After supper that night, and almost nightly for years
afterwards, Tom and Arthur, and by degrees East occasionally,
and sometimes one, sometimes another, of their friends, read a
chapter of the Bible together, and talked it over afterwards.
Tom was at first utterly astonished, and almost shocked, at the
sort of way in which Arthur read the book and talked about the
men and women whose lives were there told.  The first night they
happened to fall on the chapters about the famine in Egypt, and
Arthur began talking about Joseph as if he were a living
statesman - just as he might have talked about Lord Grey and the
Reform Bill, only that they were much more living realities to
him.  The book was to him, Tom saw, the most vivid and
delightful history of real people, who might do right or wrong,
just like any one who was walking about in Rugby - the Doctor,
or the masters, or the sixth-form boys.  But the astonishment
soon passed off, the scales seemed to drop from his eyes, and
the book became at once and for ever to him the great human and
divine book, and the men and women, whom he had looked upon as
something quite different from himself, became his friends and
counsellors.</P>
<P>For our purposes, however, the history of one night's reading
will be sufficient, which must be told here, now we are on the
subject, though it didn't happen till a year afterwards, and
long after the events recorded in the next chapter of our story.</P>
<P>Arthur, Tom, and East were together one night, and read the
story of Naaman coming to Elisha to be cured of his leprosy.
When the chapter was finished, Tom shut his Bible with a slap.</P>
<P>&quot;I can't stand that fellow Naaman,&quot; said he, &quot;after what he'd
seen and felt, going back and bowing himself down in the house
of Rimmon, because his effeminate scoundrel of a master did it.
I wonder Elisha took the trouble to heal him.  How he must have
despised him!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; there you go off as usual, with a shell on your head,&quot;
struck in East, who always took the opposite side to Tom, half
from love of argument, half from conviction.  &quot;How do you know
he didn't think better of it?  How do you know his master was a
scoundrel?  His letter don't look like it, and the book don't
say so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't care,&quot; rejoined Tom; &quot;why did Naaman talk about bowing
down, then, if he didn't mean to do it?  He wasn't likely to get
more in earnest when he got back to court, and away from the
prophet.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, but, Tom,&quot; said Arthur, &quot;look what Elisha says to him - 
'Go in peace.'  He wouldn't have said that if Naaman had been in
the wrong.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't see that that means more than saying, 'You're not the
man I took you for.'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, no; that won't do at all,&quot; said East.  &quot;Read the words
fairly, and take men as you find them.  I like Naaman, and think
he was a very fine fellow.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't,&quot; said Tom positively.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I think East is right,&quot; said Arthur; &quot;I can't see but
what it's right to do the best you can, though it mayn't be the
best absolutely.  Every man isn't born to be a martyr.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of course, of course,&quot; said East; &quot;but he's on one of his pet
hobbies.  - How often have I told you, Tom, that you must drive
a nail where it'll go.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And how often have I told you,&quot; rejoined Tom, &quot;that it'll
always go where you want, if you only stick to it and hit hard
enough.  I hate half-measures and compromises.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, he's a whole-hog man, is Tom.  Must have the whole animal-
hair and teeth, claws and tail,&quot; laughed East.  &quot;Sooner have no
bread any day than half the loaf.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know;&quot; said Arthur - &quot;it's rather puzzling; but ain't
most right things got by proper compromises - I mean where the
principle isn't given up?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's just the point,&quot; said Tom; &quot;I don't object to a
compromise, where you don't give up your principle.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not you,&quot; said East laughingly. - &quot;I know him of old, Arthur,
and you'll find him out some day.  There isn't such a reasonable
fellow in the world, to hear him talk.  He never wants anything
but what's right and fair; only when you come to settle what's
right and fair, it's everything that he wants, and nothing that
you want.  And that's his idea of a compromise.  Give me the
Brown compromise when I'm on his side.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Now, Harry,&quot; said Tom, &quot;no more chaff.  I'm serious.  Look
here.  This is what makes my blood tingle.&quot;  And he turned over
the pages of his Bible and read, &quot;Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-
nego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not
careful to answer thee in this matter.  If it be so, our God
whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery
furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.  But
if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve
thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.&quot;
He read the last verse twice, emphasizing the nots, and dwelling
on them as if they gave him actual pleasure, and were hard to
part with.</P>
<P>They were silent a minute, and then Arthur said, &quot;Yes, that's a
glorious story, but it don't prove your point, Tom, I think.
There are times when there is only one way, and that the
highest, and then the men are found to stand in the breach.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There's always a highest way, and it's always the right one,&quot;
said Tom.  &quot;How many times has the Doctor told us that in his
sermons in the last year, I should like to know?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, you ain't going to convince us - is he, Arthur?  No Brown
compromise to-night,&quot; said East, looking at his watch.  &quot;But
it's past eight, and we must go to first lesson.  What a bore!&quot;</P>
<P>So they took down their books and fell to work; but Arthur
didn't forget, and thought long and often over the conversation.</P>
