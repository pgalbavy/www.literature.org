<P>
LEFT alone in the drawing-room, Moody looked at the unfastened
envelope on the table.
<P>
Considering the value of the inclosure, might he feel justified
in wetting the gum and securing the envelope for safety's sake?
After thinking it over, Moody decided that he was not justified
in meddling with the letter. On reflection, her Ladyship might
have changes to make in it or might have a postscript to add to
what she had already written. Apart too, from these
considerations, was it reasonable to act as if Lady Lydiard's
house was a hotel, perpetually open to the intrusion of
strangers? Objects worth twice five hundred pounds in the
aggregate were scattered about on the tables and in the unlocked
cabinets all round him. Moody withdrew, without further
hesitation, to order the light restorative prescribed for himself
by Mr. Sweetsir.
<P>
The footman who took the curacoa into the picture gallery found
Felix recumbent on a sofa, admiring the famous Hobbema.
<P>
"Don't interrupt me," he said peevishly, catching the servant in
the act of staring at him. "Put down the bottle and go!"
Forbidden to look at Mr. Sweetsir, the man's eyes as he left the
gallery turned wonderingly towards the famous landscape. And what
did he see? He saw one towering big cloud in the sky that
threatened rain, two withered mahogany-colored trees sorely in
want of rain, a muddy road greatly the worse for rain, and a
vagabond boy running home who was afraid of the rain. That was
the picture, to the footman's eye. He took a gloomy view of the
state of Mr. Sweetsir's brains on his return to the servants'
hall. "A slate loose, poor devil!" That was the footman's report
of the brilliant Felix.
<P>
Immediately on the servant's departure, the silence in the
picture-gallery was broken by voices penetrating into it from the
drawing-room. Felix rose to a sitting position on the sofa. He
had recognized the voice of Alfred Hardyman saying, "Don't
disturb Lady Lydiard," and the voice of Moody answering, "I will
just knock at the door of her Ladyship's room, sir; you will find
Mr. Sweetsir in the picture-gallery."
<P>
The curtains over the archway parted, and disclosed the figure of
a tall man, with a closely cropped head set a little stiffly on
his shoulders. The immovable gravity of face and manner which
every Englishman seems to acquire who lives constantly in the
society of horses, was the gravity which this gentleman displayed
as he entered the picture-gallery. He was a finely made, sinewy
man, with clearly cut, regular features. If he had not been
affected with horses on the brain he would doubtless have been
personally popular with the women. As it was, the serene and
hippic gloom of the handsome horse-breeder daunted the daughters
of Eve, and they failed to make up their minds about the exact
value of him, socially considered. Alfred Hardyman was
nevertheless a remarkable man in his way. He had been offered the
customary alternatives submitted to the younger sons of the
nobility--the Church or the diplomatic service--and had refused
the one and the other. "I like horses," he said, "and I mean to
get my living out of them. Don't talk to me about my position in
the world. Talk to my eldest brother, who gets the money and the
title." Starting in life with these sensible views, and with a
small capital of five thousand pounds, Hardyman took his own
place in the sphere that was fitted for him. At the period of
this narrative he was already a rich man, and one of the greatest
authorities on horse-breeding in England. His prosperity made no
change in him. He was always the same grave, quiet, obstinately
resolute man--true to the few friends whom he admitted to his
intimacy, and sincere to a fault in the expression of his
feelings among persons whom he distrusted or disliked. As he
entered the picture-gallery and paused for a moment looking at
Felix on the sofa, his large, cold, steady gray eyes rested on
the little man with an indifference that just verged on contempt.
Felix, on the other hand, sprang to his feet with alert
politeness and greeted his friend with exuberant cordiality.
<P>
"Dear old boy! This is so good of you," he began. "I feel it--I
do assure you I feel it!"
<P>
"You needn't trouble yourself to feel it," was the
quietly-ungracious answer. "Lady Lydiard brings me here. I come
to see the house--and the dog." He looked round the gallery in
his gravely attentive way. "I don't understand pictures," he
remarked resignedly. "I shall go back to the drawing-room."
<P>
After a moment's consideration, Felix followed him into the
drawing-room, with the air of a man who was determined not to be
repelled.
<P>
"Well?" asked Hardyman. "What is it?"
<P>
"About that matter?" Felix said, inquiringly.
<P>
"What matter?"
<P>
"Oh, you know. Will next week do?"
<P>
"Nex t week _won't_ do."
<P>
Mr. Felix Sweetsir cast one look at his friend. His friend was
too intently occupied with the decorations of the drawing-room to
notice the look.
<P>
"Will to-morrow do?" Felix resumed, after an interval.
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"At what time?"
<P>
"Between twelve and one in the afternoon."
<P>
"Between twelve and one in the afternoon," Felix repeated. He
looked again at Hardyman and took his hat. "Make my apologies to
my aunt," he said. "You must introduce yourself to her Ladyship.
I can't wait here any longer." He walked out of the room, having
deliberately returned the contemptuous indifference of Hardyman
by a similar indifference on his own side, at parting.
<P>
Left by himself, Hardyman took a chair and glanced at the door
which led into the boudoir. The steward had knocked at that door,
had disappeared through it, and had not appeared again. How much
longer was Lady Lydiard's visitor to be left unnoticed in Lady
Lydiard's house?
<P>
As the question passed through his mind the boudoir door opened.
For once in his life, Alfred Hardyman's composure deserted him.
He started to his feet, like an ordinary mortal taken completely
by surprise
<P>
Instead of Mr. Moody, instead of Lady Lydiard, there appeared in
the open doorway a young woman in a state of embarrassment, who
actually quickened the beat of Mr. Hardyman's heart the moment he
set eyes on her. Was the person who produced this amazing
impression at first sight a person of importance? Nothing of the
sort. She was only "Isabel" surnamed "Miller." Even her name had
nothing in it. Only "Isabel Miller!"
<P>
Had she any pretensions to distinction in virtue of her personal
appearance?
<P>
It is not easy to answer the question. The women (let us put the
worst judges first) had long since discovered that she wanted
that indispensable elegance of figure which is derived from
slimness of waist and length of limb. The men (who were better
acquainted with the subject) looked at her figure from their
point of view; and, finding it essentially embraceable, asked for
nothing more. It might have been her bright complexion or it
might have been the bold luster of her eyes (as the women
considered it), that dazzled the lords of creation generally, and
made them all alike incompetent to discover her faults. Still,
she had compensating attractions which no severity of criticism
could dispute. Her smile, beginning at her lips, flowed brightly
and instantly over her whole face. A delicious atmosphere of
health, freshness, and good humor seemed to radiate from her
wherever she went and whatever she did. For the rest her brown
hair grew low over her broad white forehead, and was topped by a
neat little lace cap with ribbons of a violet color. A plain
collar and plain cuffs encircled her smooth, round neck, and her
plump dimpled hands. Her merino dress, covering but not hiding
the charming outline of her bosom, matched the color of the
cap-ribbons, and was brightened by a white muslin apron
coquettishly trimmed about the pockets, a gift from Lady Lydiard.
Blushing and smiling, she let the door fall to behind her, and,
shyly approaching the stranger, said to him, in her small, clear
voice, "If you please, sir, are you Mr. Hardyman?"
<P>
The gravity of the great horse-breeder deserted him at her first
question. He smiled as he acknowledged that he was "Mr.
Hardyman"--he smiled as he offered her a chair.
<P>
"No, thank you, sir," she said, with a quaintly pretty
inclination of her head. "I am only sent here to make her
Ladyship's apologies. She has put the poor dear dog into a warm
bath, and she can't leave him. And Mr. Moody can't come instead
of me, because I was too frightened to be of any use, and so he
had to hold the dog. That's all. We are very anxious sir, to know
if the warm bath is the right thing. Please come into the room
and tell us."
<P>
She led the way back to the door. Hardyman, naturally enough, was
slow to follow her. When a man is fascinated by the charm of
youth and beauty, he is in no hurry to transfer his attention to
a sick animal in a bath. Hardyman seized on the first excuse that
he could devise for keeping Isabel to himself--that is to say,
for keeping her in the drawing-room.
<P>
"I think I shall be better able to help you," he said, "if you
will tell me something about the dog first."
<P>
Even his accent in speaking had altered to a certain degree. The
quiet, dreary monotone in which he habitually spoke quickened a
little under his present excitement. As for Isabel, she was too
deeply interested in Tommie's welfare to suspect that she was
being made the victim of a stratagem. She left the door and
returned to Hardyman with eager eyes. "What can I tell you, sir?"
she asked innocently.
<P>
Hardyman pressed his advantage without mercy.
<P>
"You can tell me what sort of dog he is?"
<P>
"Yes, sir."
<P>
"How old he is?"
<P>
"Yes, sir."
<P>
"What his name is?--what his temper is?--what his illness is?
what diseases his father and mother had?--what--"
<P>
Isabel's head began to turn giddy. "One thing at a time, sir!"
she interposed, with a gesture of entreaty. "The dog sleeps on my
bed, and I had a bad night with him, he disturbed me so, and I am
afraid I am very stupid this morning. His name is Tommie. We are
obliged to call him by it, because he won't answer to any other
than the name he had when my Lady bought him. But we spell it
with an _i e_ at the end, which makes it less vulgar than Tommy
with a _y_. I am very sorry, sir--I forget what else you wanted
to know. Please to come in here and my Lady will tell you
everything."
<P>
She tried to get back to the door of the boudoir. Hardyman,
feasting his eyes on the pretty, changeful face that looked up at
him with such innocent confidence in his authority, drew her away
from the door by the one means at his disposal. He returned to
his questions about Tommie.
<P>
"Wait a little, please. What sort of dog is he?"
<P>
Isabel turned back again from the door. To describe Tommie was a
labor of love. "He is the most beautiful dog in the world!" the
girl began, with kindling eyes. "He has the most exquisite white
curly hair and two light brown patches on his back--and, oh!
_such_ lovely dark eyes! They call him a Scotch terrier. When he
is well his appetite is truly wonderful--nothing comes amiss to
him, sir, from pate de foie gras to potatoes. He has his enemies,
poor dear, though you wouldn't think it. People who won't put up
with being bitten by him (what shocking tempers one does meet
with, to be sure!) call him a mongrel. Isn't it a shame? Please
come in and see him, sir; my Lady will be tired of waiting."
<P>
Another journey to the door followed those words, checked
instantly by a serious objection.
<P>
"Stop a minute! You must tell me what his temper is, or I can do
nothing for him."
<P>
Isabel returned once more, feeling that it was really serious
this time. Her gravity was even more charming than her gayety. As
she lifted her face to him, with large solemn eyes, expressive of
her sense of responsibility, Hardyman would have given every
horse in his stables to have had the privilege of taking her in
his arms and kissing her.
<P>
"Tommie has the temper of an angel with the people he likes," she
said. "When he bites, it generally means that he objects to
strangers. He loves my Lady, and he loves Mr. Moody, and he loves
me, and--and I think that's all. This way, sir, if you please, I
am sure I heard my Lady call."
<P>
"No," said Hardyman, in his immovably obstinate way. "Nobody
called. About this dog's temper? Doesn't he take to any
strangers? What sort of people does he bite in general?"
<P>
Isabel's pretty lips began to curl upward at the corners in a
quaint smile. Hardyman's last imbecile question had opened her
eyes to the true state of the case. Still, Tommie's future was in
this strange gentleman's hands; she felt bound to consider that.
And, moreover, it was no everyday event, in Isabel's experience,
to fascinate a famous personage, who was also a magnificent and
perfectly dressed man. She ran the risk of wasting another minute
or two, and went on with the memoirs of Tommie.
<P>
"I must own, sir," she resumed, "that he behaves a little
ungratefully--even to strangers who take an interest in him. When
he gets lost in the streets (which is very often), he sits down
on the pavement and howls till he collects a pitying crowd round
him; and when they try to read his name and address on his collar
he snaps at them. The servants generally find him and bring him
back; and as soon as he gets home he turns round on the doorstep
and snaps at the servants. I think it must be his fun. You should
see him sitting up in his chair at dinner-time, waiting to be
helped, with his fore paws on the edge of the table, like the
hands of a gentleman at a public dinner making a speech. But,
oh!" cried Isabel, checking herself, with the tears in her eyes,
"how can I talk of him in this way when he is so dreadfully ill!
Some of them say it's bronchitis, and some say it's his liver.
Only yesterday I took him to the front door to give him a little
air, and he stood still on the pavement, quite stupefied. For the
first time in his life, he snapped at nobody who went by; and,
oh, dear, he hadn't even the heart to smell a lamp-post!"
<P>
Isabel had barely stated this last afflicting circumstance when
the memoirs of Tommie were suddenly cut short by the voice of
Lady Lydiard--really calling this time--from the inner room.
<P>
"Isabel! Isabel!" cried her Ladyship, "what are you about?"
<P>
Isabel ran to the door of the boudoir and threw it open. "Go in,
sir! Pray go in!" she said.
<P>
"Without you?" Hardyman asked.
<P>
"I will follow you, sir. I have something to do for her Ladyship
first."
<P>
She still held the door open, and pointed entreatingly to the
passage which led to the boudoir "I shall be blamed, sir," she
said, "if you don't go in."
<P>
This statement of the case left Hardyman no alternative. He
presented himself to Lady Lydiard without another moment of
delay.
<P>
Having closed the drawing-room door on him, Isabel waited a
little, absorbed in her own thoughts.
<P>
She was now perfectly well aware of the effect which she had
produced on Hardyman. Her vanity, it is not to be denied, was
flattered by his admiration--he was so grand and so tall, and he
had such fine large eyes. The girl looked prettier than ever as
she stood with her head down and her color heightened, smiling to
herself. A clock on the chimney-piece striking the half-hour
roused her. She cast one look at the glass, as she passed it, and
went to the table at which Lady Lydiard had been writing.
<P>
Methodical Mr. Moody, in submitting to be employed as
bath-attendant upon Tommie, had not forgotten the interests of
his mistress. He reminded her Ladyship that she had left her
letter, with a bank-note inclosed in it, unsealed. Absorbed in
the dog, Lady Lydiard answered, "Isabel is doing nothing, let
Isabel seal it. Show Mr. Hardyman in here," she continued,
turning to Isabel, "and then seal a letter of mine which you will
find on the table." "And when you have sealed it," careful Mr.
Moody added, "put it back on the table; I will take charge of it
when her Ladyship has done with me."
<P>
Such were the special instructions which now detained Isabel in
the drawing-room. She lighted the taper, and closed and sealed
the open envelope, without feeling curiosity enough even to look
at the address. Mr. Hardyman was the uppermost subject in her
thoughts. Leaving the sealed letter on the table, she returned to
the fireplace, and studied her own charming face attentively in
the looking-glass. The time passed--and Isabel's reflection was
still the subject of Isabel's contemplation . "He must see many
beautiful ladies," she thought, veering backward and forward
between pride and humility. "I wonder what he sees in Me?"
<P>
The clock struck the hour. Almost at the same moment the
boudoir-door opened, and Robert Moody, released at last from
attendance on Tommie, entered the drawing-room.
