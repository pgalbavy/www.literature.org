<p>But there was no avoiding the risk. In silence the little party
threaded their way along the margin of the prairie, listening
for the sounds they dreaded to hear, and peering through the gloom
for the forms they held in unspeakable fear. Not until they had
progressed several hundred yards can it be said that the rancher
breathed freely. Then he checked his pony, and those behind him
did the same.</p>

<p>The next instant he was out of the saddle, with his ear once
more against the cold earth.</p>

<p>Not the slightest sound reached him through this better conductor.
If the Sioux horsemen were moving, they were too far off for the
fact to be known. When first heard, they must have been close
to the wood, on reaching which they undoubtedly dismounted and
advanced on foot.</p>

<p>In that event, they must detect the footprints of the ponies
in advance, and with their skill in trailing were certain to learn
of the course taken by the whites. Then the pursuit would be resumed
in earnest, and the perils would increase.</p>

<p>One possible remedy suggested itself, though there was no certainty
of its success. The snow was now falling so fast that it promised
to obliterate the footprints to that extent that they could not
be followed in the dark. As it was, even the lynx eyes of the
Sioux could avail them nothing. One of their number must be continually
dismounting and using his hands to make sure they were not off
the track. A half hour or more interval, and this resource would
be taken from them by the descending snow.</p>

<p>It was this belief which caused the rancher to ride Dick among
the trees, where he and the rest dismounted. Then they groped
forward with no little difficulty for some rods and halted.</p>

<p>"Be careful," he said, speaking particularly to Dot, "and do
not make any noise, for I believe those bad Indians are not far
off, and they are looking for us."</p>

<p>Dot showed her obedience by not venturing to whisper.</p>

<p>It was not Mr. Starr's purpose to lose time by staying where
they were. Accordingly, after threading their way for some distance
farther, he emerged once more on the plain, and, as they remounted,
rode straight away from the timber.</p>

<p>The object of this stratagem can be readily understood. The pursuing
Sioux, after discovering that the trail of the fugitives led along
the margin of the wood, were likely to override it for some way,
before learning the fact. Then they would turn about and hunt
until they found it again. The fact that at that point it entered
the timber must cause another delay, where the difficulty of tracing
the whites would be greatly increased. By the time they came back
again to the open plain, the fall of snow was likely to render
further pursuit almost, if not quite, impossible.</p>

<p>This was the theory which guided the rancher's actions, though
he was too wise to lose sight of the probability of serious miscalculations
on his part. There was another danger, however, of which he failed
to think, but which was not long in manifesting itself.</p>

<p>By shifting his course so often, and leaving the stream altogether,
he was sure to lose his bearings in the darkness. Instead of following
the most direct route to Fort Meade, he was liable to turn back
on his old trail, with the result that when the sun rose in the
morning he would be in the vicinity of his home, with the environing
perils more threatening than ever.</p>

<p>Beyond all question this would have been the result had not nature
come to his help. He was on the point of turning his pony's head
around, to re-enter the timber he had left, when he discovered
to his astonishment that he had already reached it. There were
the trees directly in front, with the nose of Dick almost touching
a projecting limb.</p>

<p>He was at a loss to understand it until his wife suggested that
the winding course of the stream was responsible for the situation.
Even then he hardly believed until investigation convinced him
that it was the same swift current flowing in front.</p>

<p>"We unconsciously strayed from a direct course, and must have
been going at right angles to the correct one."</p>

<p>"There is no saying, George; only I advise you not to make too
many experiments in the darkness. Several hours have passed since
night came, and we are not making much progress toward the fort."</p>

<p>"You are quite right," was the nervous response, "but safety
seemed to demand it. How are you standing it, Dot?"</p>

<p>The child made no answer.</p>

<p>"She is asleep," whispered the mother.</p>

<p>"I hope that it may last until morning. If you are tired of holding
her in your arms I will take her."</p>

<p>"When I grow weary of that," was the significant reply of the
wife, "I will let you know."</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the continually obtruding stream must be crossed,
and the precious hours were fast passing, the rancher gave every
energy to surmounting the difficulty.</p>

<p>As he led the way once more to the edge of the water, he asked
himself whether the wisest course was not to construct a raft.
The work promised to be so difficult, however, that he would have
abandoned the thought had he not come upon a heavy log, lying
half submerged at the very spot where he struck the water.</p>

<p>"This will be of great help," he said to his wife.</p>

<p>Leaning his Winchester against the nearest tree, he drew out
his rubber safe and struck a match. The appearance of the log
was encouraging, and after some lifting and tugging he succeeded
in rolling it into the stream.</p>

<p>That ended the matter. To his chagrin, the water-soaked wood
sank like so much mud.</p>

<p>"We won't experiment any longer," concluded the disappointed
rancher; "but try the same thing as before."</p>

<p>Dick was stripped again and put in the lead, with his master
following on the back of the mare. Mrs. Starr, being helped to
the ground, stood with the sleeping Dot in her arms, awaiting
the return of her husband from his disagreeable experiment.</p>

<p>"Heaven grant that this maybe the right place," was his prayer,
as he entered upon the second essay; "if we are turned back again
I shall be in despair."</p>

<p>His interest was intensified, for he was impressed with the belief
that this was to be the decisive and final test.</p>

<p>As if Dick, too, felt the seriousness of the situation, he stepped
resolutely forward, bracing himself against the strong current
which was heard washing about his limbs. It seemed to the anxious
rancher that he could discern the figure of his pony as he led
the way through the gloom, only a short distance in advance of
the mare.</p>

<p>When certain that they were fully half-way across, his heart
began to beat with hope at finding that the water did not touch
the stirrup in which one foot rested. It was plain also that the
leading horse was still firmly wading.</p>

<p>With a relief which possibly may be imagined, the horseman heard
Dick step out on the bank a few minutes later. He had waded the
whole distance, thus proving that the stream was easily fordable
at that point.</p>

<p>The delighted rancher could hardly repress a cheer. But for his
fear that the Sioux might be in the vicinity, he would have announced
the joyous fact to his wife.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, however, her sharp ears have told her the truth," was
his thought, as he wheeled the mare about and started to return,
leaving Dick to follow him, as he would be needed to help the
party over.</p>

<p>With never a thought of danger, the animal was forced hastily
through the water, coming out a few paces below where she had
entered it.</p>

<p>"We are all right," he called; "we will be over in a jiffy."</p>

<p>To his astonishment there was no response. He pronounced his
wife's name, but still no reply came. Then he moved up and down
the bank, stirred by an awful fear, but heard and found her not.</p>
