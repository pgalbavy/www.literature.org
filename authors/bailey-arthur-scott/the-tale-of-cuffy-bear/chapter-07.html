<p>Farmer Green had taken his sap-buckets off the maple trees and <u>that</u>
meant the spring was fast going. At least, that was what Mr. Bear said.
And Cuffy noticed that every day there was a little less snow than there
had been the day before.
</p>
<p>"The ice will soon go out," Mr. Bear said to Cuffy's mother at breakfast
one morning, "and then when I cross Pleasant Valley I shall have to swim
the river."
</p><p>Cuffy knew that his father meant Swift River. In summer Cuffy could look
down from Blue Mountain and see the stream as it flashed through the
valley.
</p><p>"Will the ice go out of the river to-day?" Cuffy asked.
</p><p>"Well, now--" Mr. Bear said, "it might. And then again, it might not."
Mr. Bear never said a thing was <u>so</u> unless he was sure of it.
</p><p>Now, Cuffy thought it would be great fun to go down into the valley and
find out for himself if the ice really did go out. He had an idea that
it caused a terrific splitting and crashing and thundering noise and he
thought that perhaps some fish would be tossed up on the bank and then
he would have a good lunch.
</p><p>When Mr. Bear had gone off down the mountain, "to see a bear," as he
explained to his wife, little Cuffy sneaked away from the house. His
mother was making the beds, and Silkie was pretending to help her. Now,
nobody <u>sneaks</u> unless he knows he is doing something wrong. Cuffy knew
that his parents would not let him go down into the valley alone, so he
went without asking. And when he did at last come to the river there
was ice along both banks; but between them ran a broad stream of swift
water.
</p><p>"The ice must have gone out in the night," Cuffy said to himself. And he
looked about in the hope of finding some fish on the banks. But not one
fish could he find.
</p><p>He was disappointed. And he crept out onto the ice as far as he could go
and peeped over the edge into the water. He thought maybe he could at
least catch a fish with his paw.
</p><p>Cuffy lay quite still for a long time. And then at last to his delight
he saw a fish right before him. He made a quick reach for it. And then
there was a sharp _crack!_ The ice tipped and Cuffy clung to it with all
his claws to keep from falling into the river. He backed away from the
edge and looked around. The bank was moving past him. He had never seen
such a thing and he was surprised.
</p><p>Then he gave a cry which sounded in his throat like <u>"Oug!"</u> and ended
with <u>"I-s-s-s!"</u> through his nose. It meant that Cuffy was frightened.
For he saw that the ice he was on had broken away and was floating
rapidly down the stream.
</p><p>He had not caught the fish, either. But he forgot all about that now.
