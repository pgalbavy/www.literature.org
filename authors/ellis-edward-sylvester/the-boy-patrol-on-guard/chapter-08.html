<p>The ball game having ended so summarily, the Patrols gathered
once more on the slope in front of the clubhouse to decide what
should be done during the remainder of the forenoon.</p>

<p>"That’s what I call a mystery," declared the chubby faced Corporal
Robe, alluding to the disappearance of the ball; "I wonder whether
any big bird flying overhead made off with it."</p>

<p>"The explanation is simple," said Alvin Landon as if in pity
of the ignorance of the others.</p>

<p>"Well, you are so smart," remarked the corporal, "suppose you
explain for the benefit of the rest of us.</p>

<p>"Didn’t you observe that I put all my power in that sweep of
the bat, and I caught the ball on the trade mark? Well, it is
probably still sailing through the air and most likely will be
found on the outskirts of Boothbay Harbor or at Christmas Cove."</p>

<p>"Strange we never thought of that," commented Robe, as if impressed.
"I had a notion that the ball lodged somewhere among the limbs
of the trees."</p>

<p>"I never heard of anything like that."</p>

<p>"Don’t you think there may be several things of which you never
heard?"</p>

<p>"Enough of this aimless talk," broke in the Scout Master; "we
have a visitor."</p>

<p>There was a general turning of heads toward the lake, where all
saw the cause of the last remark of the Scout Master. A birch
canoe had put out from the eastern shore and was approaching the
bungalow at a moderate speed. In the stern of the craft was seated
a man who swung the short paddle with easy powerful strokes. His
face was turned toward the group of lads.</p>

<p>"I thought Rip Van Winkle lived in the Catskills," remarked the
corporal in a low voice, whereat all smiled, for the appearance
of the stranger justified the comparison. He was bareheaded and
his long hair and beard were of snowy whiteness. The picture was
a striking one, with the curving prow of the pretty craft pointed
straight toward the landing. The crystalline water was split into
a gentle ripple by the bow, fashioned the same as the stern, and
the sparkle of the blade looked as if he was lifting and tumbling
liquid diamonds about for the party to admire.</p>

<p>You have been introduced to "Uncle Elk," and do not need any
further description of him. He and Mike Murphy were to meet some
hours later not far away in the woods.</p>

<p>Scout Master Hall and the boys walked down to the edge of the
lake to welcome their caller. They were glad to receive strangers
at any time, and believing the man to be much older than he was,
they stood ready to give him the help he might possibly need.
But he required nothing of that nature.</p>

<p>Uncle Elk seemed to be surveying the group from under his shaggy
brows, but he acted as if he saw them not. With the same regular
sweep of the paddle, he held the boat to its course, gently checking
it as the prow neared land, so that it impinged like a feather
against the shingle. He arose, stepped out, drew the craft farther
up the beach and then astonished the boys and their leader by
doing a most unexpected thing. He straightened his slightly stooping
figure, fixed his penetrating eyes on the Scout Master, and made
the Boy Scout salute. So far as his exuberant beard permitted
them to see, he was grave and solemn of manner.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! he’s one of us!" called Herbert Wood, as led by Hall,
all stood erect and returned the greeting. And almost instantly
the old man taught them precisely how the wolf makes his cry,
followed by the "baow," of the stag and the "kreece," of the eagle.
Those keen eyes which scorned all artificial aid, had observed
the flags of the three Patrols displayed along with the emblem
of their country above the roof of the bungalow.</p>

<p>Hall stepped forward and offered his hand, which was clasped
by the venerable man, who showed his pleasure in looking into
the faces of so bright a lot of youths.</p>

<p>"Will you accept me as a Boy Scout?" he asked, the movement at
the sides of his mouth showing he was smiling, while his eyes
twinkled and fine wrinkles appeared at the corners.</p>

<p>"You seem to be one already," replied the Scout Master.</p>

<p>"I have not been initiated, though I have taken pains to inform
myself about your organization. I have only one misgiving."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"I believe you accept no person who is under twelve years of
age."</p>

<p>"If you will give us your word that you have seen that number
of years, I shall be satisfied. What do you say, boys?"</p>

<p>Entering into the spirit of the moment, the lads discussed the
question. Hardly a face showed a smile, and there were grave shakings
of heads. Finally, Leader Chase said:</p>

<p>"We are willing to run the risk."</p>

<p>"With your permission," said the visitor, bowing toward Scout
Master Hall, "I shall be glad if you see your way clear to my
becoming an honorary member of your order. My name is Elkanah
Sisum, more generally known as ‘Uncle Elk’; I live by myself a
couple of miles inland from the lake" (indicating the point);
"I have a comfortable home; my latchstring always hangs outside
and I shall take it as an honor if you will come and see me often."</p>

<p>"I do not recall any rule regarding honorary members of the Boy
Scouts, but I hereby declare you to be such, Uncle Elk," said
Scout Master Hall with much heartiness.</p>

<p>In obedience to a unanimous impulse every youth made the salute,
to which the old gentleman responded.</p>

<p>"Thanks for the honor, which is appreciated. I have lived in
the Maine woods for a good many years and have hunted from Eagle
Lake away up in the wild north, to this settled section, where
not much in the way of game is left. Perhaps there may be something
relating to trees, birds, fishes and the ways of the woods that
I can teach you, though," he added with a twinkle of his bright
eyes; "boys in these days have so many advantages that they run
away from us old fellows in knowledge. None the less, you will
find that the more you learn the more there is left for you to
learn. Many a boy with a twine and bent pin can beat the best
of you in wooing fish from the water; scores of urchins much younger
than you know more of the woods and its inhabitants than you will
learn in years; I can show you lads who with the bows and arrows
made by themselves will bring down game that you can’t touch with
the latest improved firearms, while as regards trailing through
the depths of the wilderness they can teach you the rudiments."</p>

<p>"Nothing can be truer than that; the advantages we have are many,
but without brains and application they will do us little good.
Your offer to help us along these paths of knowledge is gratefully
accepted. We shall make frequent calls upon you, with the understanding
that you will often come and see us. We have studied woodcraft
a good deal, just enough to realize, as you have reminded us,
how little we know of it. We need an instructor and we hereby
close with your offer without giving you time to withdraw it."</p>

<p>Addressing the scouts, the Master said:</p>

<p>"The only matters to be settled are the title that is to go with
Uncle Elk’s office and the size of salary that is to be paid him
as instructor."</p>

<p>"Suppose you leave the latter question to me," gravely suggested
the old man.</p>

<p>Scout Master Hall pretended to be undecided and asked his boys
quizzically:</p>

<p>"Is it safe to do that?"</p>

<p>"There doesn’t seem to be any help for it," replied Patrol Leader
Chase.</p>

<p>"Then we may as well make a virtue of necessity; and now as to
the proper title which Uncle Elk is to assume. I am ready for
suggestions."</p>

<p>Uncle Elk and the Scout Master listened with amusement to the
proposals of the boys. All were eagerly interested and nearly
every one submitted at least one proposal. Some of them were overwhelming.
Perhaps the most striking was that of Gordon Calhoun, Scout 5
of Patrol 2. It was "Lieutenant-General and Supreme Counsellor
and Master of the Mysteries of the Woods."</p>

<p>Uncle Elk and Scout Master Hall laughed.</p>

<p>"If I were of the African race, that would suit me exactly, but,
as it is, the weight would crush me. Try, boys, to hit upon something
simple."</p>

<p>Calhoun joined in the merriment at his expense and gave up.</p>

<p>Isaac Rothstein, the black-haired, dark-eyed Jewish member of
the Stag Patrol, amid the hush of his comrades said:</p>

<p>"Why not call Uncle Elk ‘Instructor in Woodcraft’?"</p>

<p>"You’ve hit it," commented the pleased visitor.</p>

<p>"I agree with you," said the Scout Master, patting the shoulder
of the blushing boy who stood at his side. "The name is simple
and expressive and therefore meets every requirement without paining
the modesty of the gentleman who wears it; and now, Mr. Instructor,
may I be permitted to ask when it will suit your convenience to
begin earning your salary?"</p>

<p>Uncle Elk glanced up at the sky and noted the position of the
sun.</p>

<p>"It is now a few minutes past eleven; the day is so far along
that I propose to go back to my home and stay there until to-morrow
morning. Nothing unexpected occurring, I shall be here at half-past
eight o’clock. I shall not come in my boat but on foot, prepared
to take up my duties."</p>

<p>(Scout Master Hall slyly glanced at his watch, while the man
was speaking. The hands showed it was six minutes past eleven.)</p>

<p>"You will remain and take dinner with us." The Instructor nodded.</p>

<p>"I shall be pleased. Meanwhile, may I witness a drill of your
troop?"</p>

<p>The Scout Master blew a sharp blast on his whistle and strolled
to the front of the clubhouse, the Instructor beside him. Facing
about, the former nodded and a pretty exhibition followed. The
three patrols composing the troop, each under the command of its
leader, went through the maneuvers with a precision and unity
that were almost perfect.</p>

<p>The troop formed in two ranks, the second covering the intervals
between the scouts in the first rank, the feet turned out at an
angle of forty-five degrees, the body erect, arms hanging easily,
fingers slightly bent, head up and eyes to the front. This is
the "Alert" position. It will be remembered that the boys carried
no weapons.</p>

<p>The next command was to "stand at ease." Each left foot was shifted
eight or ten inches to the left, the weight of the body being
thus equally divided on both feet; the hands were carried behind
the back, one loosely resting on the palm of the other, the grasp
being maintained by the fingers and thumb. Then followed "dressing,"
the different turnings,—right-turn, left-turn, about-turn, and
right and left half-turn.</p>

<p>In the brief pause that occurred at this moment, Instructor Sisum
asked the Scout Master in a voice which all heard:</p>

<p>"What are the rules regarding salutes?"</p>

<p>The Scout Master nodded to Corporal Robe, who with a sly grin
passed the question to Private Harold Hopkins, and he, having
no one to whom he could shift it, promptly replied, accompanying
his words with a practical illustration:</p>

<p>"We have the half salute and the full salute. Scouts use the
half salute when they meet for the first time in the day. The
fingers are held as in the full salute, but the right hand is
raised only shoulder high, with palm to the front.</p>

<p>"For the full salute we raise the hand to the forehead, elbow
in line and nearly square with the shoulder, for one or two seconds."</p>

<p>"When should this salute be given?" asked the Instructor.</p>

<p>"When a private meets one of his officers, any commissioned officer
of the United States army, or the colors of a regiment when passing
the body at a funeral; on such occasions as the Fourth of July,
Flag Day, Memorial Day; when the Stars and Strips are hoisted,
and, if in uniform, when the ‘Star Spangled Banner’ or ‘My Country’
is played."</p>

<p>"Which hand should be employed in making the salute?"</p>

<p>"The same rule holds as in the United States army; it must be
done by the hand farthest from the person saluted. In addressing
an officer a Scout will halt two paces from him and salute and
will repeat it before withdrawing."</p>

<p>Other exercises were followed by the troop drill. The scouts
fell into line for inspection, with the assistant patrol leader
on the right of each patrol, the leader one pace in front of his
patrol and the Scout Master two paces in front of the line.</p>

<p>You will not care for a detailed description of the pleasing
drill. If you wish to learn the various movements, the best plan
is to become a Boy Scout, and at the same time improve yourself
mentally, morally and physically.</p>

<p>Having dismissed the troop with liberty to do as they pleased
until dinner time, Scout Master Hall seated himself on the piazza
extending along the front of the clubhouse, beside his visitor,
intending to spend the interval before dinner time in conversation.
He had become much interested in the old gentleman about whom
was wrapped something of mystery. Hall expected a partial explanation
or at least some reference to the cause of Uncle Elk’s self exile,
but he did not give any hint, and of course Hall was silent on
that point.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that when the Instructor in Woodcraft paddled
away in his canoe, quite early in the afternoon, neither the Scout
Master nor his boys knew anything of their visitor beyond the
fact that he was a most attractive old gentleman, with whom they
expected to spend many pleasant hours while serving as his pupils
in the woods. </p>
