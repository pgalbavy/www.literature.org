<p><em>WITH </em>the departure of Fred and Terry, Deerfoot felt
as though he had flung off a blanket that had been wrapped about
his shoulders: his arms were now free and he could use them at
will.</p>

<p>He shrewdly suspected that his young friends would fancy they
had been put upon their mettle, and would, therefore, exert themselves
to their fullest to meet his expectations. He was glad it was
so, and he would have been much better pleased could he have known
they were in the cabin at the foot of the mountains, or, better
still, safe at their home in Greville.</p>

<p>Deerfoot now stealthily approached as close to the camp-fire
as was safe. He screened his body behind a tree, but he was nigh
enough to catch every word that was said in an ordinary tone,
and he understood the Winnebago tongue well enough to want no
interpreter.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe had hardly taken his position to act as cowen, when
the venison steaks were about one-fourth broiled, which was enough
to satisfy the parties interested. Those who had charge of the
culinary operations divided the meat into a dozen slices, so that
each warrior was provided for, and the feast opened. The strong
animal appetites, and teeth like those of the steel traps that
were set at the foot of the Ozarks, soon brought the feast to
a close, after which the feasters walked the few steps necessary
to the brook near at hand, and lying down on their faces drank
their fill, just as so many pigs would have done, grunting with
satisfaction as they came back and resumed their pipes.</p>

<p>All this Deerfoot had seen so often that it had no interest to
him. He kept his eyes on two warriors&mdash;the Wolf and one whom he
had never seen before. These two sat near each other on the ground
while eating, and they talked together in low tones. Since none
of those around could overhear the words, it was impossible for
Deerfoot, with all his wonderful acuteness, to catch a syllable.
He would have given a great deal could he have done so, for he
suspected the dark plot that was taking shape in their dusky brains.
There was a dangerous flash in the black eyes of the young Shawanoe
while he watched their movements.</p>

<p>It was clear to him that the Wolf had lost prestige, instead
of gaining sympathy by his last misfortune. Having gone out to
gather wool he had come back shorn, to go out a second time and
to come back shorn to a still more ludicrous degree. The manner
in which the Wolf kept apart from the rest, affiliating only with
the single warrior at his side, showed the feeling in the party.</p>

<p>It was easy to recognize the leader or chieftain, though his
dress was precisely like the rest, but his air of authority told
the story plainly enough. The Winnebagos were a fine set of men
in their war paint, and, as I have said, were able to give a good
account of themselves in any scrimmage in which they might become
engaged.</p>

<p>As unexpectedly to the warriors as to Deerfoot himself, the Winnebago
chieftain, who was standing on one side of the fire where his
rifle with several others leaned against a tree, took his pipe
from between his lips and spoke to the Wolf in tones which caused
that redskin to look up in wonder. Seeing that the sachem hesitated,
as if waiting for him to rise, the Wolf came nimbly to his feet,
as did his friend at his elbow. The majority of the rest, however,
sat still and showed no special interest in what was going on.</p>

<p>"The Wolf was the bravest of the Winnebagos," remarked the chief,
"when our war parties met those of the Sauks and Foxes and Pottawatomies
who dared to come into our country; the heart of the Wolf bounded
with delight and no tomahawk was hurled with such swiftness as
his: no gun was fired more often; no scalping knife took back
more scalps to hang upon the ridge-pole of his wigwam.</p>

<p>"But the Wolf came across the Big Water and his heart longed
for the scalp of the pale face; he went out to hunt for it; he
came back; the tongue of the Wolf is not double and tells no lies;
the Wolf met a Shawanoe warrior who took his gun from him.</p>

<p>"It was the young Shawanoe called Deerfoot; the Winnebagos have
been told about Deerfoot, the friend of the white man; the heart
of Black Bear (meaning himself) was angry; he was chief of the
Winnebagos; he told the Wolf that he must go forth and bring back
his rifle; the Wolf went; he did not bring back his rifle, but
left his knife behind; Deerfoot saw him and took it away from
him.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is but a youth; he is not a mighty warrior; the Wolf
must get his gun and knife; he must bring back the scalp of the
Shawanoe, he shall take Wau-ko-mia-tan with him; each shall have
his gun; let them bring back the scalps of Deerfoot and the two
pale faces with him; then will Black Bear forget that the Wolf
was not always a great warrior.</p>

<p>"Let the Wolf and Wau-ko-mia-tan make haste; the Winnebagos are
on the war path; they will carry back with them the scalps of
the pale faces who are gathering the skins of the beaver and otter
and foxes by the base of the mountain."</p>

<p>It may be said that this little speech developed the plan of
the Winnebago campaign. The Wolf had fallen so low in the opinion
of his chieftain and brother warriors, that it was necessary for
him to take heroic measures to restore himself. Seeing this, the
sachem had just notified him that he must secure the scalps of
Deerfoot and the two white boys with him. Wau-ko-mia-tan (who
was the warrior that sat at the elbow of the Wolf), was to be
his companion. The chieftain knew how closely the two were allied,
and he indulged in the little fiction of allowing one to keep
company with the other, when the truth was he was afraid to let
the Wolf go alone. Since on each of the two former excursions
he had lost something, the probabilities were that if he came
back again, it would be without his scalp.</p>

<p>The eagerness with which the Wolf accepted this task, the moment
he found that he was to have a companion, showed that he was an
admirable representative of the average Indian: gratitude to him
was a vice rather than a virtue.</p>

<p>The expression on the face of Deerfoot showed that all forbearance
was ended. He had twice spared the ingrate: he would do so no
more.</p>

<p>Had the Wolf told his leader that the mercy of Deerfoot had touched
his heart, so that his arm could never more be raised in anger
against him, but that he would seek the scalps of the hunters
at the base of the mountains, the Shawanoe would have felt an
admiration for him. Had he sought out Deerfoot and asked for the
return of his weapons (though that would have been very unlike
his race), Deerfoot would have restored them to him. But now,
as it was, when they should meet it would be as mortal enemies.</p>

<p>Nothing showed the vicious ingratitude of the Wolf more vividly
than the fact that instead of waiting for the morning before entering
upon his wicked enterprise, he started within three minutes after
Black Bear, the chieftain, finished his little speech. The sachem
picked up his own rifle from where it leaned against the tree
and handed it to him, while Wau-ko-mia-tan stood at the other
end of the group, until the warrior, his ugly face glowing like
that of a demon, stepped to his side. Then the two, without a
word or motion like a farewell, turned away and vanished in the
gloom of the wood.</p>

<p>They had not taken a dozen steps, when Deerfoot glided from behind
the tree and passed after them, as if he were the shadow thrown
out by the light of the camp-fire. The expression on his face
was such as would have hushed Fred Linden and Terry Clark to awed
silence could they have seen it.</p>

<p>The two Winnebagos did not come directly back to the trail, but
fell into it at almost the precise point where Deerfoot had led
his two friends. They stopped a few minutes and talked in their
low, guttural tones, none of which was understood by the Shawanoe,
who listened with the closest attention.</p>

<p>There was considerable distance at that time between the warriors
and Fred and Terry, who had set out with the ambition to keep
up their traveling through the entire night. The Winnebagos did
not wait long, when they moved on at their usual pace.</p>

<p>Less than a mile from the camp, the warriors again came to a
halt and as before talked in a low voice. The point was where
the wood was more open, so that the moonlight which found its
way among the limbs above showed their forms quite plainly. More
than that, enough of their words were audible to enable the listening
Shawanoe, who had crept dangerously near, to catch their meaning.</p>

<p>The Winnebagos turned off at almost a right angle and left the
trail behind them. The ground was broken, but they had not gone
far, when it became evident that they were following another path,
though it was so faintly marked that no eye except that of an
American Indian could have discovered it in such an uncertain
light.</p>

<p>As they advanced, the surface became not only rougher, but the
grade which they ascended was so steep that it would have been
tiresome to an ordinary traveler.</p>

<p>Suddenly Deerfoot himself wheeled aside from the indistinct path
to which the Winnebagos clung and passed lightly and with great
speed through the wood where no one had walked before. So swiftly
did he make his way, that, though he crossed a deep ravine and
went a considerable distance, it was less than live minutes before
he came back to the shadowy trail.</p>

<p>Instead of keeping along this path, in the same direction as
that of his enemies, he turned about and advanced to meet the
red men who had dared to come that way. He walked with his usual
noiseless step, and stopped on reaching the edge of the ravine
over which he had leaped when it crossed his path only a few minutes
before.</p>

<p>This gully was more than twenty feet in depth, and about half
as wide. The trail led to the edge on one side, continuing on
the margin directly opposite, so that any one who wished to keep
to it was perforce compelled to leap the chasm&mdash;a slight task
for any Indian, though it would have been easy to make a bridge
by means of a fallen tree.</p>

<p>The moon was now directly overhead, so that a flood of light
fell into the craggy ravine, lighting up the gray rocks and bowlders,
the prostrate trees that had fallen from the sides, the vegetation
along the slopes and the mossy grass that had been watered by
the torrents when they roared through. The trees grew rank and
close to the edge at the top&mdash;so close that some of them had slidden
off and fallen part way below, carrying the gravel, sand and earth
with the prong-like roots part way to the bottom.</p>

<p>So faint was the mark of the trail opposite that even with the
help of the moonbeams, it took an eye as keen as that of Deerfoot
to tell where his enemies would appear. But he coolly awaited
them, though his calmness was the fearful calm of a fury such
as even he rarely knew.</p>
