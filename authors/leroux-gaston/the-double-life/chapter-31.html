<p><em>WHEN M. </em>Longuet had recovered from the emotion that
M. Mifroid’s explanation of the train had caused him, he went
through his pockets and handed over to M. Mifroid a revolver and
a large knife that he had found in Signor Petito’s pocket.</p>

<p>He was now perfectly rational and felt free from the influences
of Cartouche. He, however, dreaded the return of these fancies,
and asked M. Mifroid to accept these articles in order to defend
himself should he again be possessed with this evil spirit.</p>

<p>Continuing the search through his pockets, he produced seven
lamps like those of M. Mifroid, and so between them they had thirteen
of these lights, which would give them 520 hours of continuous
light. They, however, worked out that they could do ten hours
a day without light on account of sleep, and their calculations
gave them fourteen hours of light per day.</p>

<p>"M. Longuet," said M. Mifroid, "you are wonderful. Cartouche
himself could not have done better; but what is the good of carrying
them around with us? They will only be a nuisance. Are you hungry,
M. Longuet? How long do you think you could remain without food?"</p>

<p>"I am sure," he declared, "that I could remain this way forty-eight
hours."</p>

<p>"Well, you will have to remain like this for seven days, perhaps.
I will throw these ten lamps away, as after the third one I am
afraid we shall not have much need of the rest."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked M. Longuet. "No matter where," answered
his companion; "but we must go anywhere rather than stay here,
for there is not a ray of hope here. We will reflect while walking.
Walking is our only salvation, but by walking seven days we will
risk all chance of arriving anywhere, unless we make a plan."
"Why not make an exact plan?" asked M. Longuet.</p>

<p>"Because I have observed in all the stories of the catacombs
there were always marked plans which the unfortunate wanderers
have lost. They were confused by the marked places, and not understanding
anything about it, they became overwhelmed with despair. In our
situation it is necessary to shun all causes for despair. You
are not without hope, M. Longuet?"</p>

<p>"Oh, by no means, M. Mifroid. I will add, even, that were I not
so hungry, your pleasant society aiding, I should not at all regret
the roofs of the Rue Gerondo. You must tell me some stories of
the catacombs, M. Mifroid, to let me forget my hunger."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, my friend. There is the story of the ‘Jailer,’
and the story of the ‘Four Soldiers.’"</p>

<p>"With which will you begin?"</p>

<p>"I am first going to tell you of the catacombs in general; this
will make you understand why it is necessary to walk a long time
to get out of them."</p>

<p>Here M. Longuet interrupted him, asking why in ending his sentences
he always made a gesture with the thumb of his right hand.</p>

<p>"That means, M. le Commissioner, that the gesture has become
a habit with you—putting on thumb-screws?"</p>

<p>M. Mifroid declared that that was not the reason. He often gave
himself up to sculpture, and he explained to him that it was the
habit of a modeler. He buried his hand in his discoveries, just
as he did in his clay."</p>

<p>M. Longuet expressed astonishment that a police commissioner
should interest himself in sculpture. However, it afterward transpired
that M. Mifroid’s knowledge of this art was the means of their
final escape from the catacombs.</p>

<p>M. Mifroid, in reporting, the events of the catacombs, wrote
as follows:</p>

<p>"The way that we were following was a vast passage of four or
five meters high. The walls were very dry, and the electric light
which lit our way allowed us to see a hard stone, devoid of all
vegetation, even of moisture. That proof was not one to rejoice
M. Longuet’s heart, for he was beginning to be very thirsty. I
knew that in the catacombs there were some threads of running
water. I thanked heaven for not putting us on one of these threadlike
streams, for we should only have lost time in imbibing there,
and, moreover, as we could not carry away any water, it would
only have made us more thirsty.</p>

<p>"M. Longuet objected to the idea that we were walking without
caring where. I resolved to make him understand the necessity
of walking on anywhere, in relating to him that which was the
truth, that the engineers, when repairing the track, had descended
into the catacombs, and had sought in vain to discover their limits,
and to find an outlet they were obliged to give it up, and they
built those pillars as supports, and built the arch with masons’
materials; they descended directly into the hole, before closing
it finally over our heads. Not to discourage M. Longuet, I informed
him that, to my knowledge, we could count on at least 520 kilometers
of catacombs, but there was not a single reason why they should
not have had more. Evidently, if I had not warned him immediately
of the difficulty of getting out of there, he would have manifested
his despair the second day of the walk.</p>

<p>"‘I think, then,’ I said to him, ‘that they have dug this soil
from the third to the seventeenth century. For during 1400 years,
man had removed from under the soil the materials that were necessary
to construct above. If at any time there was not enough above,
there was always more below. That above returns below, and goes
out thence,’ and as we still found ourselves under the ancient
Quarter d’Enfer, I recalled to him that in 1777 a house in the
Rue d’Enfer was swallowed up by the earth below. It was precipitated
to 28 meters below the soil in its court. Some months later, in
1778, seven persons met death in a similar caving in. I cited
still several more recent examples, dwelling upon the accident
to persons. He understood, and said to me: ‘In short, it is often
more dangerous to walk above than below.’</p>

<p>"I kept on, seeing that he was impressed, and he spoke no more
of his hunger, and forgot his thirst. I profited by it to make
him lengthen his step, and I burst into the most entrancing song
which came into my mind. He took it up, and we sang in chorus:=</p>

<p>```"‘Au pas, comerade, au pas,</p>

<p>````La route est belle!</p>

<p>```J’aura du frictiti la bas,</p>

<p>````Dans la gamelle!’=</p>

<p>"It was this which made him keep step.</p>

<p>"One gets tired of singing very quickly in the catacombs, because
the voice does not carry; so when we had got tired M. Longuet
asked a hundred more questions. He asked me how many meters there
were over our heads. I told him that that could vary, from the
latest reports, from 5m.82 and 79 meters. Sometimes, I told him,
the crust of earth was so thin that it was necessary to extend
the foundations of the tombs as far as the bottom of the catacombs.
So that we might, in the course of our peregrinations, encounter
the pillars of Saint Sulpice de St. Etienne du Mont, of the Pantheon
of the Val de Grace, of the Odeon. These monuments are erected
in some way on the subterranean pilings.</p>

<p>"‘Really, in the course of our peregrinations we risk encountering
some of these subterranean pilings.’ But he had his own fixed
idea.</p>

<p>"‘And in the course of our peregrinations, is there any chance
of our coming upon an exit? Are there many ways out of the catacombs?’</p>

<p>"‘There are not,’ I replied; ‘there is need of them. First of
all, there are egresses into the quarter.’</p>

<p>"‘So much the better,’ he interrupted.</p>

<p>"‘And other ways out that some know of, but by which none are
ever admitted, but which exist, nevertheless, in the caves of
the Pantheon, in those of the College of Henry IV, of the Hospital
of the Undi, of some houses in the Rue d’Enfer, of Vangirard,
of the Tombe Issoire at Passy, at Chaillot, at Saint Maur, at
Clarenton, at Gentilly—more than sixty. In order to safeguard
building construction, an ordinance was made which closed all
the openings to the catacombs.</p>

<p>It is that ordinance, my dear M. Longuet, which has almost walled
us in.’</p>

<p>"At that moment we struck an enormous pillar. I examined its
construction, and said without stopping: ‘Here is a pillar which
was used by the architects of Louis <em>XVI </em>in 1778, then
of the Consolidation.’</p>

<p>"‘Poor Louis <em>XVI!’ </em>said M. Longuet. ‘He had better have
consolidated royalty.’</p>

<p>"M. Longuet had taken the electric lamp from my hands, and did
not cease to throw the rays to the right and left, as if he was
looking for something. I asked him the reason of this, which would
fatigue the eyes.</p>

<p>"‘I am looking for some corpses,’ he said.</p>

<p>"‘Some corpses!’</p>

<p>"‘Skeletons. I have heard that the walls of the catacombs are
hung with skeletons.’</p>

<p>"‘Oh, my friend’—I already called him friend, his serenity in
such a serious emergency delighting me so much—‘that ghastly tapestry
is only a little longer than a kilometer. That kilometer justly
called an ossuary, on account of the skulls, the radius, the cubitus,
tibias, shin-bones, phalanges, the thorax, and other small bones
which were made into unique ornaments. But what ornaments! Ornaments
of three million skeletons, that were brought from the cemeteries
and acropolis of Saint Midard Clucy, Saint Lamdry of the Carmelites,
the Benedictines, and of the Innocents.</p>

<p>"‘All bones, the little bones well sorted, arranged, co-ordinated,
classified, labeled, which made on the walls and in the cross
passages, roses, parallelopipides, triangles, rectangles, volutes,
crevices, and many other figures of marvelous regularity.</p>

<p>"‘Let us wish, my friend, to reach that domain of the dead. It
will be life. For there there are always a number of people. It
is much frequented. But we are not there. What is one kilometer
of dead men’s bones in five hundred?’</p>

<p>"‘Clearly! How many kilometers do you think we have made, M.
Mifroid?’</p>

<p>"‘We have made nine.’</p>

<p>"‘What are nine kilometers in five hundred?’</p>

<p>"I induced M. Longuet not to make these useless calculations,
and he begged me to tell him the story of the ‘Jailer’ and that
of the ‘Four Soldiers.’</p>

<p>"That made two histories which were not very long in telling.
There were only a few words in the first. There was once a jailer
of the catacombs who became lost in the catacombs. They found
his corpse eight days later. The second related to four soldiers
of the Val-de-Graces, who were descending, by the aid of a cord,
into a well of eighty meters. They were in the catacombs, and
as they did not reappear some drummers were sent down, who made
the greatest noise that they could with their drums, but in the
catacombs sound does not carry, and no one responded to the rolling.
They hunted, and at the end of forty hours they found them dying
in a blind alley.</p>

<p>"‘They had no moral courage,’ said Théophraste.</p>

<p>"‘They were foolish,’ I added. ‘Whoever is foolish enough to
wander into the catacombs deserves no pity.’</p>

<p>"We were by this time come to a crossway, and M. Longuet turned
to ask which way we would follow.</p>

<p>"I could answer him without delay. I said:</p>

<p>"‘Here are two galleries; which are you going to take? One goes
almost directly back to our starting-point, the other directly
away from it.’ As our design was to go away from our starting-point,
M. Longuet showed me the first gallery.</p>

<p>"‘I was sure of it!’ I exclaimed. ‘But you disregard the entire
principle. The experimental method has for centuries demonstrated
that at the bottom of the catacombs all individuals who wish to
come back to their point of setting out (to the entrance of the
catacombs) go away from it; then the whole logic of it is, to
go away from one’s point of starting out, one must take the way
which apparently brings one back to it.’ And so we decided on
the gallery which seemed to us to bring us back over our steps,
so we were sure of not having made a useless trip. That system
was excellent, for it led us into a certain region of the catacombs
that no one had visited before, since the fourteenth century,
otherwise it would have been known."</p>
