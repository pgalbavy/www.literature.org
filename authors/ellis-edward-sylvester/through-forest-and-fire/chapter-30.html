<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Herbert Watrous had been set upon by a huge bear, and, throwing
aside his Creedmoor, had run with might and main for a large stump,
behind which he took refuge. Had he climbed a sapling, he would
have been safe, but he was too flustered to think of that.</p>

<p>Dodging behind this shelter he squatted down, hoping that his
enemy did not notice where he had gone; but, when he heard the
brute lumbering after him, he hastily shifted his quarters to
the other side of the stump. While doing so, he emitted the ringing
cries for help which brought his friends in such haste to his
rescue.</p>

<p>The situation would have been laughable but for its element of
peril. Darting to the side of the stump opposite to that of the
bear, Herbert would drop his head, and then instantly pop up again,
like a jack-in-the-box, to see what the brute was doing. The latter,
it may be said, kept things moving.</p>

<p>When Herbert lowered his head and yelled, his voice had a muffled
sound, as though it came from a distance, but when he shot up
in sight, his cries were clear and distinct.</p>

<p>The beast, although heavy and awkward of movement, managed to
move around the stump and to reverse his course with such facility
that there can be little doubt that he would have caught the lad,
had not his friends been so prompt to rush to his help.</p>

<p>Sam and Nick felt no disposition to laugh; indeed, they were
so impressed by the danger that, without exercising the care they
would have done any other time, and which they meant to show when
talking of the matter a few minutes before, they raised their
guns together and fired.</p>

<p>Although the aim was not as deliberate as it should have been,
yet both bullets struck the bear, though neither inflicted a mortal
wound.</p>

<p>The brute stopped short in his circular pursuit, looked confusedly
about him for a second or two, and then made straight for the
lads who had fired upon him, just as the buck did in the case
of Nick Ribsam.</p>

<p>"Scatter and climb a tree!" called out Nick, who saw they had
no chance to reload.</p>

<p>Now was the time for Herbert to recover, and reload his gun and
to take another shot at the brute, so as to draw him off from
his hot pursuit of the others; but the panic-stricken youth could
not realize that the danger was removed, and that his terrible
foe was bestowing his attention elsewhere. He continued calling
for help in a louder voice than before, believing that every minute
would be his last.</p>

<p>Sam Harper whirled about to make for a sapling, but caught his
foot in an obstruction and fell violently to the ground. Nick
was so alarmed that he stopped to help him up.</p>

<p>"I'm all right," said Sam, "look out for yourself!"</p>

<p>But Nick could not desert him, until assured he was not mangled
by the fall, and by that time the bear was too close for them
to escape by climbing a tree.</p>

<p>It looked as if it would go ill with one at least (for no gun
in the party was loaded, and the brute was almost upon them),
when most providentially, but unexpectedly, the report of another
rifle broke upon their ear, and the bullet reached the heart of
the monstrous beast, who reared himself on his haunches and used
his paws as though trying to draw out the splinters which he imagined
were thrust into his body.</p>

<p>Then he swerved to one side, sagged heavily to the ground, and
then it was plain that all was over.</p>

<p>"Are any of you hurt?"</p>

<p>It was the voice of the plucky Mrs. Fowler, who hurried forward
with anxious face, the smoking rifle in her hands.</p>

<p>Herbert was still peering from behind the stump and shouting
himself hoarse, with no thought of what had taken place within
the last few minutes. By and by, however, after he had been called
to, he comprehended the facts and came forth, when a general explanation
followed.</p>

<p>Although Herbert would not admit it, there was no doubt that
of the two shots which he fired at the bear only one touched him,
and that only to a sufficient extent to graze his body and to
draw his attention to the young hunter.</p>

<p>Herbert then dropped his gun and made for the stump, which was
not a secure refuge.</p>

<p>This took place so near the cabin-home of Mrs. Fowler that she
heard the cries for help, and, taking down her rifle, hurried
to the spot, arriving just in time to save the other lads from
serious danger, if not from death.</p>

<p>The boys overwhelmed the brave woman with thanks, and though
she modestly disclaimed her right to the bear&mdash;expressing her
belief that the two shots they had fired were fatal&mdash;they would
not listen to it, but they turned to, skinned the animal, and
presented the hide to her, regretting that they had not several
others, that her husband might collect twenty dollars apiece from
Mr. Bailey, his employer.</p>

<p>"This isn't the only bear in the woods," said she, thanking them
for their kindness; "and some of you will see another before long.
But this will do for to-day."</p>

<p>They thought so, too; and, swinging their hats in the air, bade
her good-by and started homeward.</p>

<p>Sam Harper proposed that they should go out of their path to
examine the carcass of the deer, so as to learn whether the shot
of Herbert took effect; but that young gentleman was frank enough
to admit, after his experience, that it was impossible he had
come anywhere near hitting the buck. Accordingly, they continued
homeward, Herbert going back to the city a few days afterward
to find out, if he could, why his gun so often failed to hit the
object he aimed at.</p>
