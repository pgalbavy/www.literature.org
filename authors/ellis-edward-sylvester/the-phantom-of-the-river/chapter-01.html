<p>"I think there's trouble ahead, Dan'l."</p>

<p>"There isn't any doubt of it, Simon."</p>

<p>The first remark was made by the famous pioneer ranger, Simon
Kenton, and the second fell from the lips of the more famous Daniel
Boone.</p>

<p>It was at the close of a warm day in August, more than a century
ago, that these veterans of the woods came together for the purpose
of consultation. They had threaded their way along parallel lines,
separated by hardly a furlong, for a mile from their starting-point,
when the above interchange of views took place.</p>

<p>Boone had kept close to the Ohio while stealthily moving eastward,
while Kenton took the same course, gliding more deeply among the
shadows of the Kentucky forest until, disturbed by the evidence
of danger, he trended to the left and met Boone near the river.</p>

<p>The two sat down on a fallen tree, side by side, and, while talking
in low tones, did not for a moment forget their surroundings.
They had lived too long in the perilous wilderness to forget that
there was never a moment when a pioneer was absolutely safe from
the fierce or stealthy red man.</p>

<p>"Dan'l," said Kenton, in that low, musical voice which was one
of his most marked characteristics, "this 'ere bus'ness has took
the qu'arest shape of anything that you or me have been mixed
up in."</p>

<p>"I haven't been mixed up in it, Simon," corrected Boone, turning
his somewhat narrow, but clean-shaven face upon the other, and
smiling gently in a way that brought the wrinkles around a pair
of eyes as blue as those of Kenton himself.</p>

<p>"Not yet, but you're powerful sartin to be afore them folks reach
the block-house."</p>

<p>Boone nodded his head to signify that he agreed with his friend.</p>

<p>"You wasn't at the block-house, Dan'l, when the flatboat stopped
there?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Neither was I; I was tramping through the woods on my way to
make a call on Mr. Ashbridge."</p>

<p>"That's the man who put up the cabin a mile back down the river?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you see Norman Ashbridge or his son George&mdash;and the same
is a powerful likely younker&mdash;come down the Ohio last spring in
their flatboat, and stopped at the clearing a mile below us, where
they put up a tidy cabin. A few weeks ago the father started east
to bring down his family in another flatboat. George, the younker,
got tired of waiting and set out to meet 'em; him and me come
together in the woods, and had a scrimmage with the varmints afore
we got on the boat with 'em. Things were purty warm on the way
down the river, for The Panther made matters warm for us."</p>

<p>"The Panther!" repeated Boone, turning toward his friend; "I
was afraid he was mixed up in this."</p>

<p>"I should say he was&mdash;ruther," replied Kenton, with a grin over
the surprise of his older companion. "That chap sneaked onto the
boat last night, believing he had a chance to clean us all out.
Of course, I knowed what was up, but The Panther made a powerful
big mistake. He got mixed up with that darkey you seed&mdash;his name
is Jethro Juggens&mdash;and you may shoot me if the darkey didn't throw
him down and hold him fast till we made him prisoner."</p>

<p>Boone had heard something of this extraordinary exploit, but
he looked questioningly at Kenton, as though he could hardly credit
the fact.</p>

<p>"It's all as true as Gospel. We kept Wa-on-mon, which the same
is The Panther, till late that night, when Mr. Ashbridge and Altman
and me went over in a canoe to the other flatboat, which the Shawanoes
had cleaned out, to even up accounts with 'em. Sime Girty was
with 'em, but they left afore we got to the craft, and we sot
it afire and come back."</p>

<p>"I seed the light last night, but didn't know what it was."</p>

<p>"While we was gone, Mr. Altman's darter, Agnes (she ain't much
more than a child), felt so sorry for The Panther, thinking, too,
that I meant to shove him under, that she cut the cords that bound
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What a fool of a gal!"</p>

<p>"Dan'l," sternly interrupted Kenton, laying his hand on the arm
of his friend, "you mustn't speak that way of Tom Altman's child.
There ain't a finer, smarter, purtier, sweeter gal in all Ohio
or Kaintuck than little Agnes Altman. She made a powerful big
mistake, but she done it in the kindness of her heart, and, Dan'l,
you and me knows there ain't many such mistakes made. But that
little gal showed her pluck when she follered up Wa-on-mon, snatched
the knife from his hand when he warn't looking, and warned young
Ashbridge in time to save him. Wal, The Panther made a rush to
jump overboard, but he happened to step onto that darkey again,
so he was nabbed."</p>

<p>"But what's become of The Panther?" asked Boone, hoping to hear
that the career of this terrible scourge of the border was ended.</p>

<p>Kenton rested his long, formidable flintlock rifle on the log
at his side, clasped his thin iron fingers over one knee, the
foot of which was raised from the ground, and looked thoughtfully
among the trees in front. His coonskin cap was shoved back from
his forehead, and a frown settled on it, and his thin lips were
compressed for a few moments before he spoke.</p>

<p>"Dan'l, things haven't turned out altogether to suit me. As you
know, the flatboat kept on down the river till it reached the
clearing this morning. Afore we went ashore, I diskivered that
Girty and several varmints was in the cabin. They knowed we was
going there, and they meant to wait until we got inside, when
they'd clean us all out. While we was man[oe]uvring round like,
so as to trade places with 'em, a powerful qu'ar thing happened."</p>

<p>"There's a good many queer things happening in this part of the
world, Simon," curtly remarked Boone.</p>

<p>"Two of them Shawanoes was shot&mdash;one killed or the other hit
hard&mdash;and in both cases it was done by that darkey, Jethro Juggens.
He's a big, strong, simple chap, that hates work worse nor pizen,
but he knows how to shoot that gun of his in a way that'll open
your eyes."</p>

<p>"But what about The Panther?" asked Boone, feeling more interest
in him than in Jethro Juggens. Kenton's brow clouded again as
he made answer:</p>

<p>"Consarn The Panther! I forgot about him. It was agreed that
him and me would meet, all by ourselves, in the woods near the
clearing, and settle that account between us. If I come back all
right, Girty and the varmints was to leave the cabin. I come back
and they left."</p>

<p>"And you evened up matters with The Panther?" exclaimed Boone,
with a glow of satisfaction, in strong contrast to the scornful
disgust on the rugged countenance of his friend.</p>

<p>"No; I went to the spot, but The Panther didn't show himself."</p>

<p>The readers of "Shod with Silence" will recall the circumstances.
Simon Kenton hurried to the appointed place of meeting, eager
for the encounter with Wa-on-mon, the famous war chief of the
Shawanoes, but the crafty miscreant had vanished, and nothing
was seen of him.</p>

<p>"I never thought Wa-on-mon was a coward," bitterly repeated Kenton.</p>

<p>"And, Simon," said Boone, impressively, "don't make the mistake
of thinking so now; the reason why he didn't meet you wasn't that
he was afraid of you."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"You know as well as me."</p>

<p>And so he did. The savage leader of the Shawanoes merely deferred
his furious meeting with the ranger in order to strike a more
fearful blow against the pioneers.</p>

<p>The moment Wa-on-mon plunged into the woods near the clearing,
with the avowed purpose of meeting Kenton, he was off like a deer
in search of a large war party that he knew was somewhere in the
neighborhood. With them he meant to return and "wipe out" every
man, woman and child of the settlers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Altmans and Ashbridges, assisted by their companions,
removed all their goods from the flatboat against the bank and
placed them in the cabin, prepared some time before for the occupancy
of the Ashbridges. This was hardly done when Daniel Boone appeared
at the clearing with disquieting news. He advised them, however,
to stay, since their means of defence was good, but hardly was
the decision reached when a runner came in with the news that
an uprising among the surrounding tribes had already begun, and
it would not do for the pioneers to remain another day. Nothing
could save the lonely cabins and exposed dwellings except immediate
flight to the nearest settlement or block-house.</p>

<p>Ten miles from the clearing, and standing on the northern bank
of the Ohio, was the block-house in charge of Captain Bushwick.
The Altmans and Ashbridges made the sad mistake of not fastening
the flatboat to the bank and taking up their quarters at this
frontier post until the full truth was learned about the dangers
confronting them.</p>

<p>The first intention of Boone and his party was to escort the
settlers back to the block-house. They had a brush with a company
of Shawanoes, and defeated them. It was not the main body, however,
under the leadership of The Panther. That remained to be heard
from, and its whereabouts was unknown.</p>

<p>Mr. Altman, his wife, and daughter Agnes, and his negro servant,
Jethro Juggens, Mr. Ashbridge and his wife, daughter Mabel, and
their son George set out for the block-house on the Ohio side
of the river.</p>

<p>Their plan was to keep along the Kentucky bank until opposite
the post, when the means would be readily found for crossing.
The two families were in charge of the rangers that Boone had
brought with him for the purpose of acting as their escort. They
were forced to leave behind them all their earthly possessions
in the solitary cabin, with not the remotest prospect of ever
seeing them or it again.</p>

<p>Although the day was well along when the start was made, yet
the situation was so critical, because of the part The Panther
was certain to play in the coming events, that Boone and Kenton
took the advance, proceeding by parallel but separated lines,
and on the guard against any stealthy approach from the Indians.</p>

<p>It was the hope that by preventing or, rather, averting any attack
until nightfall, the prospects of the pioneers would be vastly
improved. Though the forest possessed no available trail that
could be used even in the daytime, the rangers, and especially
Kenton and Boone, were so familiar with it, that they could guide
their friends with unerring accuracy when the darkness was so
profound that it was almost worthy of the old remark that a person
could not see his hand before his face.</p>

<p>Accordingly, all yearned or prayed for the coming of darkness.</p>

<p>"Hark," whispered Kenton, turning to Boone, and raising his hand
as a gesture for silence.</p>

<p>No need of that, for the elder had caught the sound&mdash;a faint
and apparently distant cawing of a crow from some lofty tree-top.</p>

<p>Both had heard the same cry more than once that afternoon, and
instead of its being the call of a crow, they knew it came from
the throat of an Indian warrior, and therefore a relentless enemy.</p>
