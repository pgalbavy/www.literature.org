ONCE UPON A TIME, when the Sun announced his intention to take a
wife, the Frogs lifted up their voices in clamor to the sky. 
Jupiter, disturbed by the noise of their croaking, inquired the
cause of their complaint.  One of them said, "The Sun, now while
he is single, parches up the marsh, and compels us to die
miserably in our arid homes.  What will be our future condition
if he should beget other suns?'
