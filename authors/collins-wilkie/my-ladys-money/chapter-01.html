<P>
OLD Lady Lydiard sat meditating by the fireside, with three
letters lying open on her lap.
<P>
Time had discolored the paper, and had turned the ink to a
brownish hue. The letters were all addressed to the same
person--"THE RT. HON. LORD LYDIARD"--and were all signed in the
same way--"Your affectionate cousin, James Tollmidge." Judged by
these specimens of his correspondence, Mr. Tollmidge must have
possessed one great merit as a letter-writer--the merit of
brevity. He will weary nobody's patience, if he is allowed to
have a hearing. Let him, therefore, be permitted, in his own
high-flown way, to speak for himself.
<P>
_First Letter._--"My statement, as your Lordship requests, shall
be short and to the point. I was doing very well as a
portrait-painter in the country; and I had a wife and children to
consider. Under the circumstances, if I had been left to decide
for myself, I should certainly have waited until I had saved a
little money before I ventured on the serious expense of taking a
house and studio at the west end of London. Your Lordship, I
positively declare, encouraged me to try the experiment without
waiting. And here I am, unknown and unemployed, a helpless artist
lost in London--with a sick wife and hungry children, and
bankruptcy staring me in the face. On whose shoulders does this
dreadful responsibility rest? On your Lordship's!"
<P>
_Second Letter._--"After a week's delay, you favor me, my Lord,
with a curt reply. I can be equally curt on my side. I
indignantly deny that I or my wife ever presumed to see your
Lordship's name as a means of recommendation to sitters without
your permission. Some enemy has slandered us. I claim as my right
to know the name of that enemy."
<P>
_Third (and last) Letter._--"Another week has passed--and not a
word of answer has reached me from your Lordship. It matters
little. I have employed the interval in making inquiries, and I
have at last discovered the hostile influence which has estranged
you from me. I have been, it seems, so unfortunate as to offend
Lady Lydiard (how, I cannot imagine); and the all-powerful
influence of this noble lady is now used against the struggling
artist who is united to you by the sacred ties of kindred. Be it
so. I can fight my way upwards, my Lord, as other men have done
before me. A day may yet come when the throng of carriages
waiting at the door of the fashionable portrait-painter will
include her Ladyship's vehicle, and bring me the tardy expression
of her Ladyship's regret. I refer you, my Lord Lydiard, to that
day!"
<P>
Having read Mr. Tollmidge's formidable assertions relating to
herself for the second time, Lady Lydiard's meditations came to
an abrupt end. She rose, took the letters in both hands to tear
them up, hesitated, and threw them back in the cabinet drawer in
which she had discovered them, among other papers that had not
been arranged since Lord Lydiard's death.
<P>
"The idiot!" said her Ladyship, thinking of Mr. Tollmidge, "I
never even heard of him, in my husband's lifetime; I never even
knew that he was really related to Lord Lydiard, till I found his
letters. What is to be done next?"
<P>
She looked, as she put that question to herself, at an open
newspaper thrown on the table, which announced the death of "that
accomplished artist Mr. Tollmidge, related, it is said, to the
late well-known connoisseur, Lord Lydiard." In the next sentence
the writer of the obituary notice deplored the destitute
condition of Mrs. Tollmidge and her children, "thrown helpless on
the mercy of the world." Lady Lydiard stood by the table with her
eyes on those lines, and saw but too plainly the direction in
which they pointed--the direction of her check-book.
<P>
Turning towards the fireplace, she rang the bell. "I can do
nothing in this matter," she thought to herself, "until I know
whether the report about Mrs. Tollmidge and her family is to be
depended on. Has Moody come back?" she asked, when the servant
appeared at the door. "Moody" (otherwise her Ladyship's steward)
had not come back. Lady Lydiard dismissed the subject of the
artist's widow from further consideration until the steward
returned, and gave her mind to a question of domestic interest
which lay nearer to her heart. Her favorite dog had been ailing
for some time past, and no report of him had reached her that
morning. She opened a door near the fireplace, which led, through
a little corridor hung with rare prints, to her own boudoir.
"Isabel!" she called out, "how is Tommie?"
<P>
A fresh young voice answered from behind the curtain which closed
the further end of the corridor, "No better, my Lady."
<P>
A low growl followed the fresh young voice, and added (in dog's
language), "Much worse, my Lady--much worse!"
<P>
Lady Lydiard closed the door again, with a compassionate sigh for
Tommie, and walked slowly to and fro in her spacious
drawing-room, waiting for the steward's return.
<P>
Accurately described, Lord Lydiard's widow was short and fat,
and, in the matter of age, perilously near her sixtieth birthday.
But it may be said, without paying a compliment, that she looked
younger than her age by ten years at least. Her complexion was of
that delicate pink tinge which is sometimes seen in old women
with well-preserved constitutions. Her eyes (equally well
preserved) were of that hard light blue color which wears well,
and does not wash out when tried by the test of tears. Add to
this her short nose, her plump cheeks that set wrinkles at
defiance, her white hair dressed in stiff little curls; and, if a
doll could grow old, Lady Lydiard, at sixty, would have been the
living image of that doll, taking life easily on its journey
downwards to the prettiest of tombs, in a burial-ground where the
myrtles and roses grew all the year round.
<P>
These being her Ladyship's personal merits, impartial history
must acknowledge, on the list of her defects, a total want of
tact and taste in her attire. The lapse of time since Lord
Lydiard's death had left her at liberty to dress as she pleased.
She arrayed her short, clumsy figure in colors that were far too
bright for a woman of her ages. Her dresses, badly chosen as to
their hues, were perhaps not badly made, but were certainly badly
worn. Morally, as well as physically, it must be said of Lady
Lydiard that her outward side was her worst side. The anomalies
of her dress were matched by the anomalies of her character.
There were moments when she felt and spoke as became a lady of
rank; and there were other moments when she felt and spoke as
might have become the cook in the kitchen. Beneath these
superficial inconsistencies, the great heart, the essentially
true and generous nature of the woman, only waited the sufficient
occasion to assert themselves. In the trivial intercourse of
society she was open to ridicule on every side of her. But when a
serious emergency tried the metal of which she was really made,
the people who were loudest in laughing at her stood aghast, and
wondered what had become of the familiar companion of their
everyday lives.
<P>
Her Ladyship's promenade had lasted but a little while, when a
man in black clothing presented himself noiselessly at the great
door which opened on the staircase. Lady Lydiard signed to him
impatiently to enter the room.
<P>
"I have been expecting you for some time, Moody," she said. "You
look tired. Take a chair."
<P>
The man in black bowed respectfully, and took his seat.
