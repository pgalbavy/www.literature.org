<p>It was the misfortune of Mr. Cummings's first literary offering
to annoy one of the editor's friends. The Journal was brought
to the corporal at noon, while he was considering whether he should
rise from his couch or sleep another hour. Reclining among his
pillows, he glanced through Cummings's description with the subdued
giggle he always had for the good William's style but as his eye
fell upon one paragraph he started sat upright, and proceeded
to read the passage several times with anxious attention.</p>

<p>"Only two or three sources of regret occurred to mar the delight
(in which young and old participated) of that festal and dazzling
scene. One was the absence of Miss Fanchon Bareaud, one the donors;
another, that of Corporal Gray; a third was the excessive modesty
of Major Vanrevel, although present at the time, refused to receive
the ladies' sumptuous offering and insisted that Captain Marsh
was the proper person to do the honors, to which the latter reluctantly,
though gracefully consented. Also, we were sorry that the Major
appeared in citizen's dress, as all were anxious to witness him
in his uniform. However, in our humble judgment, he will be compelled
by etiquette to don it this afternoon, to receive the officers
of the regular army, who will arrive by the stage about five o'clock,
it is expected, to inspect the company and swear them into the
service of the Federal Government at the Court House. We, for
one, have little doubt that, owing to the Major's well-known talent
in matters of apparel, his appearance will far eclipse in brilliancy
that of his fellow-officers."</p>

<p>Crailey dressed slowly, returning to the paper, now and then,
with a perturbed countenance. How would Miss Betty explain this
paragraph to herself, and how account for the fact that she had
not seen Crailey, how for the fact that she had seen Tom? It seemed
unlikely that she could have overlooked the latter &mdash;Tom
was one of those whom everybody saw, wherever he went. And what
inquiries would she make? For Crailey had no means of knowing
that she would not see the Journal. Tomorrow he would be gone,
it would be all over, but he wanted this last day to run smoothly.
What wild hopes he had of things that should happen when they
all came marching home, no one can say; even if it were not to
be doubted that Crailey ever entertained hopes of any kind whatever,
since to hope is to bestow thought upon the future.</p>

<p>But, however affairs ran with him so far as hope was concerned,
he seldom lacked an idea; and one came to him presently, a notion
that put the frown to rout and brought the old smile to his lips,
his smile of the world-worn and tolerant prelate. He flicked the
paper lightly from him, and it sped across the room like a big
bird in awkward flight. For he knew how to preserve his last day
as he wished, and to make all smooth.</p>

<p>He finished his toilet with particular care, took a flower from
a vase on his table, placed it in his coat, and went down to the
dusty street, where everything was warm and bright with summer.
It was joy to be alive; there was wine enough in the air; and
Crailey made up his mind not to take a drink that day&mdash;the last
day! The last day! The three words kept ringing through his head
like a minor phrase from a song. Tomorrow, at noon, they would
be churning down the river; and this was the last day&mdash;the last
day!</p>

<p>"Still not too late to make another friend at home," he said,
stopping to pat the head of a mangy street cur that came crouching
and wobbling toward him like a staveless little keg worried by
scurries of wind. Dogs and children always fell in love with Crailey
at first sight, and he never failed to receive them in the spirit
of their approach. Now the mongrel, at his touch, immediately
turned himself over and lay upon the pavement with all paws in
air, to say: "Great lord, magnificent in the graciousness which
deigns to cast a glimpse upon this abject cluster of ribs, I perceive
that your heart is too gentle to kick me in my present helplessness;
yet do with me as you will."</p>

<p>"I doubt if you've breakfasted, brother," Crailey responded aloud,
rubbing the dog's head softly with the tip of his boot. "Will
you share the meagre fare of one who is a poet, should be a lawyer,
but is about to become a soldier? Eh, but a corporal! Rise, my
friend. Up! and be in your own small self a whole Corporal's Guard!
And if your Corporal doesn't come home from the wars, perhaps
you'll remember him kindly? Think?"</p>

<p>He made a vivacious gesture, the small animal sprang into the
air, convoluted with gratitude and new love, while Crailey, laughing
softly, led the way to the hotel. There, while he ate sparsely
himself, he provided munificently for his new acquaintance, and
recommended him, with an accompaniment of silver, to the good
offices of the Rouen House kitchen. After that, out into the sunshine
again he went, with elastic step, and a merry word and a laugh
for everyone he met. At the old English gardener's he bought four
or five bouquets, and carried them on a round of visits of farewell
to as many old ladies who had been kind to him. This done, leaving
his laughter and his flowers behind him, he went to Fanchon and
spent part of the afternoon bringing forth cunning arguments cheerily,
to prove to her that General Taylor would be in the Mexican capital
before the volunteers reached New Orleans, and urging upon her
his belief that they would all be back in Rouen before the summer
was gone.</p>

<p>But Fanchon could only sob and whisper, "Hush, hush!" in the
dim room where they sat, the windows darkened so that, after he
had gone, he should not remember how red her eyes were, and the
purple depths under them, and thus forget how pretty she had been
at her best. After a time, finding that the more he tried to cheer
her, the more brokenly she wept, he grew silent, only stroking
her head, while the summer sounds came in through the window:
the mill-whir of locusts, the small monotone of distant farm-bells,
the laughter of children in the street, and the gay arias of a
mocking-bird singing in the open window of the next house. So
they sat together through the long, still afternoon of the last
day.</p>

<p>No one in Rouen found that afternoon particularly enlivening.
Even Mrs. Tanberry gave way to the common depression, and, once
more, her doctrine of cheerfulness relegated to the ghostly ranks
of the purely theoretical, she bowed under the burden of her woe
so far as to sing "Methought I Met a Damsel Fair" (her of the
bursting sighs) at the piano. Whenever sadness lay upon her soul
she had acquired the habit of resorting to this unhappy ballad;
today she sang it four times. Mr. Carewe was not at home, and
had announced that though he intended to honor the evening meal
by his attendance, he should be away for the evening itself; as
comment upon which statement Mrs. Tanberry had offered ambiguously
the one word, "Amen!" He was stung to no reply, and she had noted
the circumstance as unusual, and also that he had appeared to
labor with the suppression of a keen excitement, which made him
anxious to escape from her sharp little eyes; an agitation for
which she easily accounted when she recalled that he had seen
Vanrevel on the previous evening. Mr. Carewe had kept his promise
to preserve the peace, as he always kept it when the two met on
neutral ground, but she had observed that his face showed a kind
of hard-leashed violence whenever he had been forced to breathe
the air of the same room with his enemy, and that the thing grew
on him.</p>

<p>Miss Betty exhibited not precisely a burning interest in the
adventure of the Damsel Fair, wandering out of the room during
the second rendition, wandering back again, and once more away.
She had moved about the house in this fashion since early morning,
wearing what Mamie described as a "peak-ed look." White-faced
and restless, with distressed eyes, to which no sleep had come
in the night, she could not read; she could no more than touch
her harp; she could not sleep; she could not remain quiet for
three minutes together. Often she sank into a chair with an air
of languor and weariness, only to start immediately out of it
and seek some other part of the house, or to go and pace the garden.
Here, in the air heavy with roses and tremulous with June, as
she walked rapidly up and down, late in the afternoon, at the
time when the faraway farm-bells were calling men from the fields
to supper, the climax of her restlessness came. That anguish and
desperation, so old in her sex, the rebellion against the law
that inaction must be her part, had fallen upon her for the first
time. She came to an abrupt stop and struck her hands together
despairingly, and spoke aloud.</p>

<p>"What shall I do! What shall I do!"</p>

<p>"Ma'am?" asked a surprised voice, just behind her.</p>

<p>She wheeled quickly about, to behold a shock-headed urchin of
ten in the path near the little clearing. He was ragged, tanned,
dusty, neither shoes nor coat trammelling his independence; and
he had evidently entered the garden through the gap in the hedge.</p>

<p>"I thought you spoke to me?" he said, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"I didn't see you," she returned. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"You Miss Carewe?" he asked; but before she could answer he said,
reassuringly, "Why, of course you are! I remember you perfect,
now I git the light on you, so to speak. Don't you remember me?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think I do."</p>

<p>"Lord!" he responded, wonderingly. "I was one of the boys with
you on them boxes the night of your pa's fire!" Mingled with the
surprise in his tone was a respectful unction which intimated
how greatly he honored her father for having been the owner of
so satisfactory a conflagration.</p>

<p>"Were you? Perhaps I'll remember you if you give me time."</p>

<p>But at this point the youth recalled the fact that he had an
errand to discharge, and, assuming an expression of businesslike
haste too pressing to permit farther parley, sought in his pocket
and produced a sealed envelope, with which he advanced upon her.</p>

<p>"Here. There's an answer. He told me not to tell nobody who sent
it, and not to give it to nobody on earth but you, and how to
slip in through the hedge and try and find you in the garden when
nobody was lookin', and he give a pencil for you to answer on
the back of it, and a dollar."</p>

<p>Miss Betty took the note, glancing once over her shoulder at
the house, but Mrs. Tanberry was still occupied with the Maiden,
and no one was in sight. She read the message hastily.</p>

<p>"I have obeyed you, and shall always. You have not sent for me.
Perhaps that was because there was no time when you thought it
safe. Perhaps you have still felt there would be a loss of dignity.
Does that weigh with you against good-by? Tell me, if you can,
that you have it in your heart to let me go without seeing you
once more, without good-by&mdash;for the last time. Or was it untrue
that you wrote me what you did? Was that dear letter but a little
fairy dream of mine? Ah, will you see me again, this once&mdash;this
once&mdash;let me look at you, let me talk with you, hear your voice?
The last time!"</p>

<p>There was no signature.</p>

<p>Miss Betty quickly wrote four lines upon the same sheet: "Yes&mdash;yes!
I must see you, must talk with you before you go. Come at dusk.
The garden&mdash;near the gap in the hedge. It will be safe for a little
while. He will not be here." She replaced the paper in its envelope,
drew a line through her own name on the letter, and wrote "Mr.
Vanrevel"  underneath.</p>

<p>"Do you know the gentleman who sent you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No'm; but he'll be waitin' at his office, 'Gray and Vanrevel,'
on Main Street, for the answer."</p>

<p>"Then hurry!" said Betty.</p>

<p>He needed no second bidding, but, with wings on his bare heels,
made off through the gap in the hedge. At the corner of the street
he encountered an adventure, a gentleman's legs and a heavy hand
at the same time. The hand fell on his shoulder, arresting his
scamper with a vicious jerk; and the boy was too awed to attempt
an escape, for he knew his captor well by sight, although never
before had he found himself so directly in the company of Rouen's
richest citizen. The note dropped from the small trembling fingers,
yet those fingers did not shake as did the man's when, like a
flash, Carewe seized upon the missive with his disengaged hand
and saw what two names were on the envelope.</p>

<p>"You were stealing, were you!" he cried, savagely. "I saw you
sneak through my hedge!"</p>

<p>"I didn't, either!"</p>

<p>Mr. Carewe ground his teeth, "What were you doing there?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" mocked Carewe. "Nothing! You didn't carry this to
the young lady in there and get her answer?"</p>

<p>"No, sir!" answered the captive, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Cross my heart I didn't. I found it!"</p>

<p>Slowly the corrugations of anger were levelled from the magnate's
face, the white heat cooled, and the prisoner marvelled to find
himself in the presence of an urbane gentleman whose placidity
made the scene of a moment ago appear some trick of distorted
vision. And yet, curious to behold, Mr. Carewe's fingers shook
even more violently than before, as he released the boy's shoulder
and gave him a friendly tap on the head, at the same time smiling
benevolently.</p>

<p>"There, there," he said, bestowing a wink upon the youngster.
"It's all right; it doesn't matter&mdash;only I think I see the chance
of a jest in this. You wait, while I read this little note, this
message that you found!" He ended by winking again with the friendliest
drollery.</p>

<p>He turned his back to the boy, and opened the note; continuing
to stand in that position while he read the two messages. It struck
the messenger that, after this, there need be no great shame in
his own lack of this much-vaunted art of reading, since it took
so famous a man as Mr. Carewe such length of time to peruse a
little note. But perhaps the great gentleman was ill, for it appeared
to the boy that he lurched several times, once so far that he
would have gone over if he had not saved himself by a lucky stagger.
And once, except for the fact that the face that had turned away
had worn an expression of such genial humor, the boy would have
believed that from it issued a sound like the gnashing of teeth.</p>

<p>But when it was turned to him again, it bore the same amiable
jocosity of mouth and eye, and nothing seemed to be the matter,
except that those fingers still shook so wildly, too wildly, indeed,
to restore the note to its envelope.</p>

<p>"There," said Mr. Carewe, "put it back, laddie, put it back yourself.
Take it to the gentleman who sent you. I see he's even disguised
his hand a trifle-ha! ha!&mdash;and I suppose he may not have expected
the young lady to write his name quite so boldly on the envelope!
What do you suppose?"</p>

<p>"I d'know," returned the boy. "I reckon I don't hardly understand."</p>

<p>"No, of course not," said Mr. Carewe, laughing rather madly.
"Ha, ha, ha! Of course you wouldn't. And how much did he give
you?"</p>

<p>"Yay!" cried the other, joyously. "Didn't he go and hand me a
dollar!"</p>

<p>"How much will you take not to tell him that I stopped you and
read it; how much not to speak of me at all?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"It's a foolish kind of joke, nothing more. I'll give you five
dollars never to tell anyone that you saw me today."</p>

<p>"Don't shoot, Colonel," exclaimed the youth, with a riotous fling
of bare feet in the air, "I'll come down!"</p>

<p>"You'll do it?"</p>

<p>"Five!" he shouted, dancing upon the boards. "Five! I'll cross
my heart to die I never hear tell of you, or ever knew they was
sich a man in the world!"</p>

<p>Carewe bent over him. "No! Say: 'God strike me dead and condemn
me eternally to the everlasting flames of hell if I ever tell!"</p>

<p>This entailed quick sobriety, though only benevolence was in
the face above him. The jig-step stopped, and the boy pondered,
frightened.</p>

<p>"Have I got to say that?"</p>

<p>Mr. Carewe produced a bank-bill about which the boy beheld a
halo. Clearly this was his day; heaven showed its approval of
his conduct by an outpouring of imperishable riches. And yet the
oath misliked him; there was a savor of the demoniacal contract;
still that was to be borne and the plunge taken, for there fluttered
the huge sum before his dazzled eyes. He took a deep breath. "'God
strike me dead' "&mdash;he began, slowly&mdash;"' if I ever '&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. 'And condemn me to the everlasting flames of hell '&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have I got to?"</p>

<p>"Yes."&mdash;"'And condemn me to&mdash;to the everlasting flames of&mdash;of
hell, if I ever tell!'"</p>

<p>He ran off, pale with the fear that he might grow up, take to
drink and some day tell in his cups, but so resolved not to coquet
with temptation that he went round a block to avoid the door of
the Rouen House bar. Nevertheless, the note was in his hand and
the fortune in his pocket.</p>

<p>And Mr. Carewe was safe. He knew that the boy would never tell,
and he knew another thing, for he had read the Journal, though
it came no more to his house: he knew that Tom Vanrevel wore his
uniform that evening, and that, even in the dusk, the brass buttons
on an officer's breast make a good mark for a gun steadied along
the ledge of a window. As he entered the gates and went toward
the house he glanced up at the window which overlooked his garden
from the cupola.</p>
