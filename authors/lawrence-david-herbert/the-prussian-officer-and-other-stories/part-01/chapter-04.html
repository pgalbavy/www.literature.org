<p>When the soldiers found him, three hours later, he was lying with
his face over his arm, his black hair giving off heat under the
sun.  But he was still alive.  Seeing the open, black mouth the
young soldiers dropped him in horror.</p>

<p>The bodies of the two men lay together, side by side, in the
mortuary, the one white and slender, but laid rigidly at rest, the
other looking as if every moment it must rouse into life again, so
young and unused, from a slumber.</p>
