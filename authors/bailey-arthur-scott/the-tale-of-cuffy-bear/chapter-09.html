<p>One day Cuffy Bear and his little sister Silkie had been making sand
pies. And now, having grown tired of that, they were squatting down on
the ground and had covered their legs with the clean white sand. Perhaps
they would have heaped the sand all over themselves, if Silkie had not
spied her father as he came climbing up the mountain. When they noticed
that he was carrying something they both sprang up and ran to see what
Mr. Bear was bringing home.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bear's mouth was stretched quite wide in what Silkie and Cuffy knew
to be his most agreeable smile. You and I might not have felt so
comfortable if we had looked past Mr. Bear's great white teeth into his
big red mouth. But it was different with Cuffy and Silkie. They saw at
once that their father was feeling very pleasant.
</p><p>"What's that?" Silkie asked. As for Cuffy, he had not stopped to ask any
questions. He was already smelling of the small white animal his father
had, and he poked it gently with his paw. He had not forgotten about the
porcupine. But this strange animal seemed quite harmless. It was covered
with things that looked a little bit like quills, only they were ever so
much shorter and smaller. And Cuffy found that they were much softer,
too, for they did not prick him at all.
</p><p>"What is it?" This time it was Cuffy who asked.
</p><p>"You'll see," Mr. Bear said again.
</p><p>"Is it a new kind of rabbit?" Silkie inquired.
</p><p>"Huh! A rabbit!" Cuffy laughed. "Of course it isn't a rabbit," he said.
</p><p>"Well--it's white, and its tail is short--" Silkie began, "and--"
</p><p>"Its ears are too small," Cuffy told her, "and its tail is all curled
up."
</p><p>"You'll see, children," Mr. Bear said again. "It's a surprise."
</p><p>"A surprise!" Cuffy and Silkie both shouted. They thought that was the
name of the--oh! I almost told what the little animal really was.
</p><p>Well! As Mr. Bear walked on toward his house, Cuffy and Silkie ran ahead
and burst in upon their mother, both of them shouting at the top of
their voices, "A surprise! A surprise! Father's bringing home a
surprise!"
</p><p>"Why, Ephraim Bear!" Mrs. Bear exclaimed, as soon as she saw her
husband. "Wherever did you get that lovely little pig?"
</p><p>There--now you know what it was that Mr. Bear had.
</p><p>"It came from Farmer Green's, my dear," Mr. Bear said. "I remembered
that this was your birthday, and so I thought I would bring home
something 'specially nice, so that we could have a real feast."
</p><p>Cuffy and Silkie had never eaten any pig before. And when there was
nothing left of the surprise except a few bones, Cuffy couldn't help
wishing that every day could be a birthday.
