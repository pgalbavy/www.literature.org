<p>Nobody knows what starts the sap along the twigs of a very young,
tender, and green woman's nature. In my case it was Samuel Foster
Crittenden, though how could he have counted on the amount of
Grandmother Nelson that was planted deep in my disposition, ready to
spring up and bear fruit as soon as I was brought in direct acquaintance
with a seed-basket and a garden hoe? Also why should Sam's return to a
primitive state have forced my ancestry up to the point of flowering on
the surface? I do hope Sam will not have to suffer consequences, but I
can't help it if he does. What's born in us is not our fault.
</p><p>"Yes, Betty, I know I'm an awful shock to you as a farmer. I ought to
have impressed it on you more thoroughly before you--you saw me in the
act. I'm sorry, dear," Sam comforted me gently and tenderly as I wept
with dismay into the sleeve of his faded blue overalls.
</p><p>"I can't understand it," I sniffed as I held on to his sustaining hand
while I balanced with him on the top of an old, moss-covered stone wall
he had begged me to climb to for a view of Harpeth Valley which he
thought might turn my attention from him. "Have you mislaid your
beautiful ambitions anywhere?"
</p><p>"I must have planted them along with my corn crop, I reckon," he
answered, quietly, as he steadied his shoulder against an old oak-tree
that grew close to the fence and then steadied my shoulder against his.
</p><p>"It is just for a little while, to get evidence about mud and animals
and things like that, isn't it?" I asked, with great and undue
eagerness, while an early blue jay flitted across from tree-top to
tree-top in so happy a spirit that I sympathized with the admiring lady
twit that came from a bush near the wall. "You are going back out into
the world where I left you, aren't you?"
</p><p>"No," answered Sam, in an even tone of voice that quieted me completely;
it was the same he had used when he made me stand still the time his
fishhook caught in my arm at about our respective sixth and tenth years.
"No, I'm going to be just a farmer. It's this way, Betty. That valley
you are looking down into has the strength to feed hundreds of thousands
of hungry men, women, and children when they come down to us over
Paradise Ridge from the crowded old world; but men have to make her
give it up and be ready for them. At first I wasn't sure I could, but
now I'm going to put enough heart and brain and muscle into my couple of
hundred acres to dig out my share of food, and that of the other folks a
great strapping thing like I am ought to help to feed. I'll plow your
name deep into the potato-field, dear," he ended, with a laugh, as he
let go my hand, which he had almost dislocated while his eyes smoldered
out over the Harpeth Valley, lying below us like an earthen cup full of
green richness, on whose surface floated a cream of mist.
</p><p>"It just breaks my heart to see you away from everything and everybody,
all burned up and scratched up and muddy, and--and--" I was saying as he
lifted me back into the road again beside my shiny new Redwheels that
looked like an enlarged and very gay sedan-chair.
</p><p>"Look, look, Betty!" Sam interrupted my distress over his farmer aspect,
which was about to become tearful, and his eyes stopped regarding me
with sad seriousness and lit with affectionate excitement as he peered
into the bushes on the side of the road. "There's my lost heifer calf!
You run your car on up to my house beyond the bend there and I'll drive
her back through the woods to meet you. Get out and head her off if she
tries to pass you." With which command he was gone just as I was about
to begin to do determined battle for his rescue.
</p><p>I did not run my car up to his farm-house. I "negotiated a turn" just as
the man I bought it from in New York had taught me to do; only he
hadn't counted on a rail fence on one side, a rock wall just fifty feet
across from it, and two stumps besides. It was almost like a maxixe, but
I finally got headed toward Providence Road, down which, five miles
away, Hayesboro is firmly planted in a beautiful, dreamy, vine-covered
rustication.
</p><p>"Oh, I wonder if it could be a devil that is possessing Sam?" I asked
myself, stemming with my tongue a large tear that was taking a
meandering course down my cheek because I was afraid to take either hand
off the steering-gear for fear I would run into a slow, old farm horse,
with a bronzed overalled driver and wagon piled high with all sorts of
uninteresting crates and bales and unspeakable pigs and chickens. As I
skidded past them I told myself I had more than a right to weep over Sam
when I thought of the last time I had seen him before this distressing
interview; the contrast was enough to cause grief.
</p><p>It had happened the night after Sam's graduation in June and just the
night before I had sailed with Mabel Vandyne and Miss Greenough for a
wander-year in Europe. Sam was perfectly wonderful to look at with his
team ribbon in the buttonhole of his dress-coat, and I was very proud of
him. We were all having dinner at the Ritz with two of Sam's classmates
and the father of one, Judge Vandyne, who is one of the greatest
corporation lawyers in New York. He had just offered Sam a chance in his
offices, together with his own son.
</p><p>"You'll buck right on up through center just as you do on the gridiron,
old man, to the Supreme bench before you are forty. I'm glad the
governor will have you, for I'll never make it. Oh, you Samboy!" said
Peter Vandyne, who was their class poet and who adored Sam from every
angle--from each of which Sam reciprocated.
</p><p>And all the rest raised their glasses and said:
</p><p>"Oh, Samboy!"
</p><p>The waiters even knew who Sam was on account of the last Thanksgiving
game, and beamed on him with the greatest awe and admiration. And I
beamed with the rest, perhaps even more proudly. Still, that twinkle in
Sam's hazel eyes ought to have made me uneasy even then. I had seen it
often enough when Sam had made up his mind to things he was not talking
about.
</p><p>"The ladies and all of us," answered Sam to Peter's toast, as he raised
his glass and set it down still full, then grinned at me as he said, so
low that the others couldn't hear, "Will you meet me in Hayesboro after
a year and a day, Betty?"
</p><p>I don't see why I didn't understand and begin to defend Sam from himself
right then instead of going carelessly and light-heartedly to Europe and
letting him manage his own affairs. I didn't even write to him, except
when I saw anything that interested or moved me, and then I just
scribbled "remind me to tell you about this" on a post-card and sent it
to him. You can seal some friends up in your heart and forget about
them, and when you take them out they are perfectly fresh and good, but
they may have changed flavor. That is what Sam did, and I am not
surprised that the rural flavor of what he offered me out there in dirt
lane shocked me slightly. I didn't think then that I liked it and I also
felt that I wished I had stayed by Sam at that wobbling period of his
career; but, on the other hand, it was plainly my duty to go to Europe
with Mabel and Peter Vandyne and Miss Greenough. The inclination to do
two things at once is a sword that slices you in two, as the man in the
Bible wanted to do to the baby to make enough of him for the two
mothers; and that is the way I felt about Peter and Sam as I whirled
along the road. I am afraid Sam is going to be the hardest to manage. He
is harder than Peter by nature. If Sam had just taken to drink instead
of farming I would have known better what to do. I reformed Peter in one
night in Naples when he took too much of that queer Italian wine merely
because it was his birthday. I used tears, and he said it should never
happen again. I don't believe it has, or he wouldn't have got an act and
a half of his "Epic of American Life" finished as he told me he had done
when I dined with him in New York the night I landed. I missed Peter
dreadfully when he left us in London in June, and so did Miss Greenough
and Mabel, though she is his sister. We all felt that if he had been
with us it wouldn't have taken us all these months of that dreadful war
to get comfortably home. Peter said at the dock that he hadn't drawn a
full breath since war had been declared until he got my feet off the
gang-plank on to American soil. He needn't have worried quite as much
as that, for we had a lovely, exciting time visiting at the Gregorys' up
in Scotland while waiting for state-rooms. And it was while hearing all
those Scotchmen and Englishmen talk about statesmanship and
jurisprudence and international law that I realized how America would
need great brains later on, more and more, as she would have to
arbitrate, maybe, for the whole world.
</p><p>I smiled inwardly as I listened, for didn't I know that in just a few
years the nation would have Samuel Foster Crittenden to rely on? Sam is
a statesman by inheritance, for he has all sorts of remarkable Tennessee
ancestry back of him from Colonial times down to his father's father,
who was one of the great generals of our own Civil War. And as I
listened to those splendid men talk about military matters, just as
Judge Crittenden had talked to Sam and me about his father, the general,
ever since we were big enough to sit up and hear about it, and discuss
what American brains and character could be depended upon to do, I
glowed with pride and confidence in Sam. I'm glad I didn't know then
about the collapsed structure of my hopes for him that Sam was even then
secretly unsettling. At the thought my hand trembled on the wheel and I
turned my car hastily away from two chickens and a dog in the road and
my mind from the anxiety of Sam to further pleasant thoughts of Peter.
</p><p>I don't believe Judge Vandyne's thoughts of Peter are as pleasant as
mine, for Peter doesn't go to the office at all any more; he spends his
waking moments at a club where players and play-writers and all men
play a great deal of the time. I forget its name, but it makes the judge
mad to mention it.
</p><p>"The dear old governor's mind is gold-bound," said Peter, sadly, after
we came away from luncheon with the judge down in Wall Street. "Why
should I grub filthy money when he has extracted the bulk of it that he
has? I must go forward and he must realize that he should urge me on up.
I ought not to be tied down to unimportant material things. I must not
be. You of all people understand me and my ambitions, Betty." As he said
it he leaned toward me across the tea-table at the Astor, where we had
dropped exhaustedly down to finish the discussion on life which the
judge's practical tirade had evoked.
</p><p>"But then, Peter, you know it was a very great thing Judge Vandyne
showed his bank how to do about that international war loan. In England
and Scotland they speak of him with bated breath. It was so brilliant
that it saved awful complications for Belgium."
</p><p>"Oh, he's the greatest ever--in all material ways," answered Peter, with
hasty loyalty and some pride, "but I was speaking of those higher
things, Betty, of the spirit. The things over which your soul and mine
seem to draw near to each other. Betty, the second act of 'The
Emergence' is almost finished, and Farrington is going to read it
himself when I have it ready. He told me so at the club just yesterday.
You know he awarded my junior prize for the 'Idyl.' Think of
it--<u>Farrington</u>!" And Peter leaned forward and took my hand.
</p><p>"Oh, Peter, I am so glad!" I said, with a catch of joy in my breath, but
I drew away my hand. I knew I liked Peter in many wonderful ways, but in
some others I was doubtful. I had only known Peter the three years I've
been away from Hayesboro, being finished in the North, and even if I did
room with his sister at the Manor on the Hudson and travel with her a
year, it is not the same as being born next door to him, as in the case
of Sam, for instance. But then I ought not to compare Peter and Sam.
Peter is of so much finer clay than Sam. Just thinking about clay made
me remember those unspeakable boots of Sam's I had encountered out on
the road, and again I determinedly turned my thoughts back to that
wonderful afternoon with Peter at the Astor a few short days ago. Miss
Greenough kept telling Mabel and me all over Europe to look at
everything as material to build nests of pleasant thoughts for our souls
to rest in, as Ruskin directed in the book she had. I've made one that
will last me for life of Peter, who is the most beautiful man in the
whole wide world; also of the yellow shade on the Astor lamp, the
fountain, and the best chicken sandwich I ever ate. It will be a warmer
place to plump down in than most of the picture-galleries and cathedrals
I had used for nest-construction purposes at Miss Greenough's direction.
</p><p>Yes, I drew my hand away from Peter's, but a little thing like that
would never stop a poet; and before the waiter had quite swept us out
with the rest of the tea paraphernalia to make way for that of dinner he
had made me see that I was positively necessary to his career,
especially as both his father and Mabel are so unsympathetic. It is a
great happiness to a woman to feel necessary to a man, though she may
not enjoy it entirely.
</p><p>"Oh, I know I can write it all--all that is in my heart if I feel that
it is--is for you, dearest dear Betty," was the last thing that Peter
said as he put me on a train headed for the Harpeth Valley that night.
</p><p>I didn't answer--I don't know that I ever did answer Peter anything, but
he never noticed that when he thought of how my loving him would help
out with the play.
</p><p>Just here I was musing so deeply on the intricacies of love that I
nearly ran over a nice, motherly old cow that had come to the middle of
the road with perfectly good faith in me when she saw me coming. And as
I rounded her off well to the left again my thoughts skidded back to Sam
and the way he had treated me as less than a heifer calf after _I_ had
not seen him for a year, and <u>she</u> had just seen him that morning at
feeding-time.
</p><p>"Head off that saucy young cow, indeed!" I sniffed, as I ran the car
into the side yard between my home and the old Crittenden house.
</p><p>"I wonder if he really expected me to be waiting there in that lane for
him?" I questioned myself. And the answer I got from the six-year-old
girl that is buried alive in me was that Sam did expect me to do as he
told me, and that something serious might happen if I didn't. As I
turned Redwheels over to old Eph, who adores it because it is the only
one he ever had his hands on, I felt a queer sinking somewhere in the
heart of that same young self. I always had helped Sam--and suppose that
unspeakable animal had got lost to him for ever just because I hadn't
done as he told me! I reached out my hand for the runabout to start
right back; then I realized it was too late. The night had erected a
lovely spangled purple tent of twilight over Hayesboro, and the
all-evening performances were about to begin.
</p><p>Lovely women were lighting lamps and drawing shades or meeting the
masculine population at front gates with babies in their arms or
beau-catcher curls set on their cheeks with deadly intent. Negro cooks
were hustling suppers on their smoking stoves, and one of the doves that
lives up in the vines under the eaves of my home moaned out and was
answered by one from under the vines that grow over the gables at the
Crittendens'. I haven't felt as lonesome as all that since the first
week of Sam's freshman year at college. As I looked across the lilac
hedge, which was just beginning to show a green sap tint along its gray
branches, I seemed to see my poor little blue-ginghamed, pigtailed self
crouched at Judge Crittenden's feet on the front steps, sobbing my
lonely heart away while he smoked his sorrow down with a long brier
pipe, and the Byrd chirped his little three-year-old protest in concert
with us both. Most eighteen-year-old men would have resented having a
motherless little brother and a long-legged girl neighbor eternally at
their heels, but Sam never had; or, if he did, he gently kicked the Byrd
and me out of the way, and we never knew that was what he was doing. We
even loved him for the kicks. Then as the tears misted across my eyes a
woman with a baby in her arms came out and called in two children who
were playing under the old willow-tree over by the side gate--the willow
that had belonged to Sam and me--and my eyes dried themselves with
indignant astonishment.
</p><p>"Who are those people over at the Crittendens', mother?" I asked, in a
stern voice, as I walked in and interrupted mother counting the
fifteenth row on a lace mat she was making.
</p><p>"Why, the Burtons bought the place from Sam after the judge's death.
Don't you remember I wrote you about it, Betty dear?" she answered, with
the gentle placidity with which she has always met all my tragic
moments. Mother raised seven boys before she produced me, and her
capacity for any sort of responsive excitement gave out long before I
needed it. After her sons a woman seems to consider a daughter just a
tame edition of a child. Mother has calmly crocheted herself through
every soul-storm I have ever had, and she is the most dear and
irresponsible parent an executive girl would wish to have leave her
affairs alone. As for daddy, he has always smiled and beckoned me away
from her into a corner and given me what I was making a stand for. My
father loves me with such confidence that he pays no attention to me
whatever except when he thinks it is about time for him to write my name
on a check. His phosphate deals have made him rich in an
un-Hayesboro-like way, and all the boys are in business for him in
different states, except the oldest one, who is Congressman from this
district, and one other who is in a Chicago bank. Yes, I know I have the
most satisfactorily aloof family in the wide world. I can just go on
feeding on their love and depend upon them not to interfere with any of
my plans for living life. However, if anything happens to me I can be
sure that their love will spring up and growl.
</p><p>Now, when I stalked into the room and asked about the Crittenden home,
daddy reared his head from his evening paper and immediately took notice
of whatever it was in my voice that sounded as if something had hurt me.
</p><p>"Daddy," I asked him, with a little gulp, "did Sam--Sam sell his
ancestral home even to the third and fourth generation and go to farming
just for sheer wickedness?"
</p><p>"No, madam, he did not," he answered, looking at me over his glasses,
and I could see a pain straighten out the corners of his mouth under his
fierce white mustache. "The judge's debts made a mortgage that nicely
blanketed the place, and Sam had only to turn it over to the creditors
and walk out to that little two-hundred-acre brier-patch the judge had
forgot to mortgage."
</p><p>"Then Sam can sell it for enough to go out and take his place in the
world," I said, with the greatest relief in my voice.
</p><p>"He could, but he won't," answered daddy, looking at me with keen
sympathy. "I tried that out on him. Just because that brier-patch has
never had a deed against it since the grant from Virginia to old Samuel
Foster Crittenden of 1793 he thinks it is his sacred duty to go out and
dig a hole in a hollow log for Byrd and himself and get in it to
sentimentalize and starve."
</p><p>"Oh, I think that is a beautiful thought about the land, and I wish I
had known it earlier! But could they be really hungry--hungry, daddy?" I
said, with a sudden vacant feeling just under my own ribs in the region
between my heart and my stomach.
</p><p>"Oh no," answered daddy, comfortably. "They both looked fat enough the
last time I saw Sam coming to town in a wagon with Byrd, leading a
remarkably fine Jersey calf. We'll go out in that new flying-machine you
brought home with you and pull them out of their burrow some day when
you get the time. Fine boy, that; and, mother, when is that
two-hundred-pound black beauty in your kitchen going to have supper?"
</p><p>I didn't tell daddy I had gone to the ends of the earth to hunt for Sam
in less than thirty-six hours after I had landed in Hayesboro, but I
went up to my room to slip into something clean and springy, walking
behind a thin mist of tears of pure sentiment. That was the third time
in about seven hours I had been crying over Sam Crittenden, and then I
had to eat a supper of fried chicken and waffles that would have been
delicious if it hadn't been flavored by restrained sobs in my throat. I
was so mad at my disloyal thoughts about a beautiful character, which
Sam's reverence for his ancestral land proves his to be, and so afraid
of what I had done to him about the calf, and so hungry to see him, that
by the time the apple-float came on the table I thought it would have to
be fed to me by old Eph. Mother made it worse by remarking, as she put a
lovely dab of thick cream right on top of my saucer:
</p><p>"Did you hear, father, that all of Sam's cows had been sick and that he
has lost his two finest calves?"
</p><p>I couldn't stand any more. I gulped the cream, remarked huskily on how
warm the April night was, and escaped down the front walk to the old
purple lilac-bush by the gate where up to my seventh year I had always
kept house with and for Sam whenever he would enter into the bonds of an
imaginary marriage with me for an hour or two. Sam made a good father of
a hollyhock doll family whenever he undertook the relation, and provided
liberally for us all in the way of honey, locusts, and grass nuts.
</p><p>"And I, maybe, let him lose the last calf he has when he is noble and
poor and alone," I sobbed into my silk sleeve, which was so thin that I
shivered in the cool April moonlight as I leaned against the gate and
looked away out at the dim blue hills that rim the Harpeth Valley, at
the foot of one of which I seemed to see Sam's and Byrd's hollow log.
</p><p>"Hello, Bettykin! Out putting our hollyhock family to bed?" laughed a
crisp, comforting, jolly voice right at my elbow as a big, rough hand
ruffled my beautifully smoothed hair and then gave a friendly shake to
my left shoulder. "How do you find all our children after a three-year
foreign sojourn?"
</p><p>"I told you five years ago, when I put it up on my head, to stop ruffing
my hair, Sam Crittenden; and did you find that cow?" I answered, with
both defiance and anxiety in my voice.
</p><p>"I did," answered Sam, cheerfully, "but how did I lose you in the
shuffle? I tied her up in the shack with a rope and then beat it in all
these five miles, partly by foot and partly by a neighbor's buggy, to
find and--er--rope you in. I am glad to see you are standing quietly at
the bars waiting for me, and as soon as I've greeted your mother and Dad
Hayes and got a little of the apple-float that I bet was the fatted calf
they killed for your prodigal return, I'll foot it the five miles back
in a relieved and contented frame of mind."
</p><p>"How did you happen to let your cows get sick, Sam?" I demanded,
sternly, instead of putting my arms around his neck to tell him how
noble I had found out he was, and how glad I was that he had come all
that way to see me, and not to be mad at me because I didn't obey him
out in the lane.
</p><p>"I don't know, Betty, I just don't know," answered Sam, as he lit a
corn-cob pipe and leaned closer to me in a thoughtful manner. "Cows are
such feminine things and so contrary. I don't know what I will do if I
lose any more. I--I may get discouraged."
</p><p>"Have you had a doctor?" I asked, briskly and unfeelingly, though I did
take his big rough hand in my own and hold on to it with a sympathy that
was not in my voice.
</p><p>"No, I've sorter doctored them by a book I have. The only good
veterinary doctor about here lives way over by Spring Hill, and it would
take him a day to drive over and back, besides costing me about ten
dollars. Still, I ought to get him. Buttercup is pretty sick," answered
Sam, and I could see that his broad shoulders under his well-cut blue
serge coat of last season seemed to sag with the weight of his animal
responsibilities.
</p><p>"I can take my car over to Spring Hill in less than an hour, get the
doctor, and have you and the doctor out to those animals by ten. This
moon will last all night; and you go get the apple-float from mother
while I make Eph run out the car and jump into my corduroys. Come on,
quick!" And as I talked I opened the gate, drew him in, and started
leading him up the front walk by the sleeve of his coat.
</p><p>"Not if I know myself, Betty, will I let you undertake such a red-cross
expedition as that. They'll have to wait. I came in to call on you and
whisper sweet nothings to you in the parlor while you tell me--"
</p><p>"Eat the float in a hurry if you want it," I interrupted him, as I
deposited him beside mother, who was still sipping a last cup of coffee
with her jelly-cake, and went for my room and my motor clothes.
</p><p>And it was one grand dash that Redwheels and I made out Providence Road
and over Paradise Ridge down to Spring Hill in less than thirty-five
minutes. In the moonlight the road was like a lovely silver ribbon that
we wound up on a spool under the machine, and a Southern spring breeze
seemed to be helping the gasoline to waft us on more rapidly in our
flight as it stung our faces with its coolness, which was scented with
the sap that was just beginning to rise against bark and bud in the
meadows and woods past which we sped.
</p><p>"It will be great to die together, won't it, Betty?" said Sam once as
Redwheels ran a few yards on two wheels, then tried the opposite two
before it settled back to the prosaic though comfortable use of four as
we took a flying leap across a little creek ditch.
</p><p>"We can't die sentimentally; we've got to get back to those suffering
cows," I answered him, firmly, as I whirled into Spring Hill and stopped
Redwheels, panting and hot, in front of the dry-goods, feed, and drug
store. There I knew we could find out anything we wanted to know about
the whereabouts or profession of any of the fifteen hundred inhabitants
of the little old hamlet which has nestled under the hills for a hundred
years or more. "Ask where the cow physician lives. Quick!"
</p><p>And at my urge Sam sprang out and across the old, uneven brick pavement
that lay between us and the store door. Then in less than two minutes he
appeared with a round, red-faced, white-headed old man who wheezed
chuckles as he talked.
</p><p>His fear of the car was only equaled by his fascination at the idea of
the long ride in it, which would be the first motor-driven sortie he had
ever made out into life.
</p><p>"Air ye sure, little missie, that you can drive the contraption so as
not to run away with us? Old folks is tetchy, like a basket of pullet
eggs," he said, as Sam seated him in the back seat and sprang to my
side.
</p><p>"I wish I had a rope to tie him in," he muttered, as he sank into his
seat. "If you run as you did coming, we'll sure lose him. He'll bounce
like a butter-ball."
</p><p>"I'm not taking any risks," I answered, and it was with greatest
mildness that we sauntered up Paradise Ridge and started down the other
side. And as I drove along carefully my mind began to work out into the
byways of the situation. I don't see how my athletic and executive
generation is going to do its appointed work in its day if we are going
to go on using the same set of social conventions that tied up our
mothers. As we neared the cross-road that turned off to Sam's
brier-patch I began to wonder how long it would take me to rush back
into Hayesboro, bundle mother into Redwheels, and get back to the cows.
It was just a quarter after nine o'clock, but I knew she would be sleepy
and would have to be forced to come with me very gently and slowly.
Still, I didn't see how I could go on out into the woods with only Sam
and the Butterball which was wheezing out cow conversation to Sam that I
was intensely interested in and ought to have been listening to rather
than wasting force on foolish proprieties. I was about to turn and take
Sam's advice on the matter when he suddenly laid his fingers on my arm
and said:
</p><p>"Stop a minute, Betty. What's that roosting on that stone wall?" And as
he spoke he peered out toward a strange, huge bird sitting by the side
of the road.
</p><p>I stopped just about opposite the object and Sam sprang out.
</p><p>"You, Byrd Crittenden, where did you come from?" I heard Sam demand of
the huddled bundle as he lifted it off the wall. It was attired in
scanty night-drawers and a short coat, and shivered as it stood, first
on one foot and then on the other.
</p><p>"I ain't a-going to stay in no country with a hoot-owl, Sam. I'm going
to somewhere that a lady lives at, too." And the manful little voice
broke as the bunch shivered up against Sam's legs.
</p><p>"Honest, Byrd, I thought you were asleep and wouldn't wake up till
morning. You never did before; but when I go--go gallivanting, have I
got to take you or not go?" And Sam's voice was bravely jocular.
</p><p>"Bring him here to me, Sam," I cried out, quickly. "Come in here with
Betty, Byrd." And I cuddled his long, thin, little legs down under my
lap-blanket beyond the steering-gear. "You didn't forget Betty while she
was away, did you?" I asked, as we snuggled to each other and I started
the motor, while Dr. Chubb chuckled and Sam still stood in the middle of
the moonlit road as if uncertain what to do next.
</p><p>"Yes, I forgot you," answered Byrd, candidly, though I had adored him
since his birth; "but I like to go see Mother Hayes and eat jelly-cake.
Can I go home with you?"
</p><p>"No. I'm going as fast as I can with you to your home to keep you from
freezing to death," I answered, quickly adopting this recovered old
friend in the double capacity of an excuse and a chaperon. "Just sit
here in the seat by me and watch me get us all back to your house in a
hurry. You sit with the doctor, Sam."
</p><p>"Oh no, Betty," answered Sam, quickly. "It is only a little over a mile
now, and the doctor and Byrd and I can walk it all right. You come out
in the morning and--"
</p><p>"I'm going on with the doctor to those cows, Sam, and if you want to go
with us, get in quick," I answered, in a tone of voice I have used on
Sam once or twice in our lives with great effect. He hopped in and I
started at top speed.
</p><p>"Hic-chew! Fine goer that," wheezed the doctor, and I didn't know
whether he alluded to me or Redwheels. But there was evident relish of
real pace in his voice, so I speeded up and shot away from the main road
into the hard dirt lane in good style.
</p><p>"I'm a bird--I'm a bird!" shouted the picked fledgling at my side as we
whizzed under dark cedar boughs that waved funereal plumes over our
heads, and over stumps and stones with utter disregard of the heavy new
tires. One of the lessons I learned early is that men are timid of a
woman's driving them in any vehicle, and I was surprised that I at last
rounded the bend and drew up beside a long, low shed which Sam had
calmly pointed out to me, without having had a single remonstrance from
the back seat.
</p><p>"Moo," came in a gentle, sad voice from the depths of the shed as we all
began to disembark at the same time.
</p><p>"Well, one is alive, anyway," said Sam as he set Byrd on the ground and
held up his arms to me. "It's good to have you back, Betty," he
whispered, in an undertone, as he turned me against his shoulder to set
me down. "It 'll all go right now that you are here to--"
</p><p>"Now tell us what to do, Doctor." I interrupted him determinedly,
because I felt that it was not the occasion for friendly
sentimentalities.
</p><p>If at any time in the three years that preceded that night I had
foreseen the way I was to spend it I would have been justified in flatly
refusing to carry out my horoscope. Suppose, for instance, while I was
in the midst of the wonderful dinner Peter Vandyne's cousin, Count Henri
de Berssan, gave me in Brussels, a week before the storm broke that
carried him before cannon and bayonet, I had seen a mental picture of
myself six months from that minute, out in the woods on the side of a
Harpeth hill under an old cedar-pole shed with my jacket off, my
embroidered blouse sleeves rolled to the shoulder, filling a tin can,
which had a long spout to be poked down a cow's throat, with a vile,
greasy mixture out of a black bottle, at the directions of a
shirt-sleeved little man and a red-headed farmer in blue overalls, while
a wisp of a boy writhed in and out and around and under a pathetic old
Jersey cow, who was being rescued from the jaws of death. Now I wonder
just what I would have done to escape such an experience? Slated myself
for Belgian widowhood, perhaps, as a kinder fate, or stayed right there
in New York to help Peter on "The Emergence." I wonder if Peter ever saw
a dear, big-eyed, trustful old Jersey cow have medicine poured down her
throat. It is called "drenching." I wish he could see it before he
finishes that play. The sight produces a peculiar kind of emotion that
might be worth recording in an all-comprehensive drama of American life.
In fact, I know that what I felt at the end was worth recording in any
kind of literature, by any kind of a poet--if we were equal to it. Old
Dr. Chubb leaned breathlessly against a rough post, I staggered down on
an upturned bucket, and Sam reached out his long, blue-overalled arms
and embraced Buttercup's neck and buried his head on her patient
shoulder, just as a faint streak of April dawn showed behind the
oak-trees, for we realized then that the dreadful cramp was gone and
that she could chew the wisp of hay offered by Byrd.
</p><p>"Hic-chew! All out of the woods," wheezed Dr. Chubb, as he looked at old
Buttercup and the two other young cows we had been working over all
night, with as fine an exaltation of achievement as any I ever saw, not
excepting that of an American man of letters I witnessed take his degree
at Oxford.
</p><p>But Sam's head was still bowed on old Buttercup's back and I went and
stood beside him.
</p><p>"Will I ever learn how to take care the right way of--of life?" he said
under his breath, as he stood up straight and tall with the early light
streaming over his great mop of sun-bronzed hair and the bare breast
from which his open shirt fell away.
</p><p>"I'll help you," I said, as I came still nearer and leaned against
Buttercup's warm, yellow side so closely that she looked around from her
meal from the Byrd's hand and mooed with grateful affection plus
surprise to find us still standing by her so determinedly. "That is,
if--if--I can learn myself."
</p><p>"You haven't found out you are a woman yet, have you, Betty?" answered
Sam, with a laugh that embarrassed me. I would have considered it
ungrateful if it hadn't sounded so comfortable and warm out in the cold
of the dawn--which had come before I realized that midnight had passed,
about which time I had intended to go home. But how could a person feel
guilty while playing Good Samaritan to a cow? I didn't.
</p><p>Then, as the streak of new day widened into a soft pink flush over the
tops of the bare trees that etched their fine twigs into an archaic
pattern against a purple sky lit by the gorgeous flame of the morning
star retreating before the coming sun, we all collected buckets and rags
and bottles and sponges. In Indian file we were led by Sam around the
hill, up a steep path that was bordered by coral-strung buck-bushes and
rasping blackberry brush, and to his little farm-house perched on a
plateau almost up to the top of the hill. It was long and low, with a
wide red roof that seemed to hover in the whitewashed walls and green
shutters; while white smoke from an old gray-rock, mud-daubed chimney
melted away among the tree-tops into the lavender of the coming day. It
looked like a great brooding white hen setting in a nest of radiant
woods, and I felt like a little cold chicken as Sam led the way through
the low, wide door for me to creep under the sheltering wings. In about
two seconds we were all sheltered in complete comfort. At a huge fire
that was a great glow of oak coals old Mammy Kitty, who had
superintended Sam's birth and childhood, as well as "neighbored" mine,
was gently stirring a mixture that smelled like the kind of breakfast
nectar they must have in heaven, while she also balanced a steaming
coffee-pot on a pair of crossed green sticks at one corner of the
chimney. In the ashes I could see little mounds which I afterward found
to be flaky, nutty com-pones, and I flew to kneel at her side with my
head on her gaudy neckerchief.
</p><p>"Dah, dah, dah, child," she crooned, as she smiled a queer, loving, old
smile that showed me how glad she was to see me, but never another word
did she utter. I almost never remember hearing Mammy say an articulate
word; but all children and those grown up who have any child left in
their hearts can understand her croon. It is cradle music--to the
initiated.
</p><p>"Mammy's rheumatism is mighty bad, but she can still shake up corn ash
cake and chicken hash with the best," said Sam, coming over to warm his
hands and tower above us, while Byrd volunteered to lead Dr. Chubb out
to what he called the wash-up bench on the back porch.
</p><p>I looked up at Sam as he stood above me in a mingling of fire-glow and
the early morning light with his low-beamed, deep-toned humble home as a
background, and he--he loomed.
</p><p>"I--I love this place," I positively gasped, as I moved still closer to
Mammy and stirred the spoon in the pot of hash.
</p><p>"Shelter, fire, a chicken in the pot, and a woman crouched on the hearth
stirring it--what more could any man want or get, no matter how he
worked?" answered Sam, as he looked down at me with the smolder in his
blue-flecked hazel eyes to which Peter had once written a poem called
"On the Gridiron."
</p><p>"Yes, but what would you do if you didn't have Mammy?" I ventured back,
as I bent across Mammy's knee and began to stir more vigorously while
she shook up her coffee-pot and raked a few last coals over the cakes
for their complete browning. "You always were a good provider, Sam," I
added, under the excitement of the bubbling over of the coffee.
</p><p>"Yes, locusts for hollyhock children and the wife of a summer day who--"
</p><p>"Whew-shk! but my stomick have got a breakfas' notice," interrupted Dr.
Chubb. He and the Byrd had come into the room as hungry as ravening
wolves.
</p><p>While Mammy stirred and shoveled off ashes I fed all three men to the
point of utter repletion, feeding myself from Sam's plate as I brought
the food back and forth. He didn't want me to wait on them, and I
suppose that is the reason I insisted on it, and partly ate his
breakfast while doing it, just as an act of defiance.
</p><p>"You taught me to eat out of your hand, even when it was unspeakably
dirty, and you had only saved me about two good bites and the core," I
answered one of his remonstrances.
</p><p>"But think of the pain it was to save even a third of a tea-cake in
your pocket when your stomach was so near it," he answered as he
finished the bottom half of a pone I had spread thick with the juicy
hash before I had greedily eaten the upper crust.
</p><p>"I'd rather eat my breakfast out of my own plate and let ladies eat
they's. Sam has to tie up cows that eat out of other's stalls, and the
old white rooster has to be put in a coop 'cause he gobbles the hen
feed; but 'cause you are company he lets you do it," the Byrd remarked,
all in one breath between two pieces of his pone. At which Dr. Chubb
wheezed and chuckled delightedly and Sam roared.
</p><p>"Women critters ain't ever so free with vittels as men; they have to
kinder toll 'em along to nibble feed, and life, too," remarked the
doctor of distressed animals as we all rose from the table just as the
sun burst in on the situation from over Paradise Ridge.
</p><p>And while he and the Byrd went to again look at the invalids, and Mammy
Kitty removed the dishes into a little cupboard that served as butler's
pantry and storeroom, Sam showed me the rest of his house--which
consisted of his own room, that "leaned-to" the long living-room
opposite that of Mammy Kitty, and a back porch. That little room made me
feel queer and choky. It was neat and poor; and a narrow, old mahogany
bed, that had always been in the Crittenden nursery, was pushed back
under the low side. It had a shelf or two with a curtain of dark chintz
under which farm clothes hung, a gun in the corner, a jolly little wood
stove, and close beside Sam's bed was the young Byrd's cot with its
little pillow my mother had made for him before he was ushered into the
world on the day his mother left it. I could almost see the big rough
hand go out to comfort the little fledgling in the dark. I choked still
further, and turned hurriedly out on to the low, wide old porch that ran
all the way across the back of the house and which apparently was
bath-room, refrigerator, seed-rack as to its beams, and the general
depositing-place of the farm; but not before I had remarked, hanging by
his door, a grass basket I had woven for Sam to bring locust pods to the
hollyhock family. Then I fled, only stopping to squeeze Mammy over her
dish-pan and get my hat off the cedar pegs that stuck out of the side of
the old chimney to serve just such a purpose.
</p><p>I found Dr. Chubb and the Byrd, who was now attired in overalls of the
exact shade and cut of Sam's, standing by Redwheels with their mouths
and eyes wide open in rapture.
</p><p>"Well, 'fore I die I've saw a horse with steel innards and rid it,"
remarked the old doctor. "Machines is jest the common sense of God
Almighty made up by men, 'ste'd er animals made up by His-self. But I
must git on, missie, or some critter over at Spring Hill will have a
conniption and die in it fer lack of a drench or a dose."
</p><p>I left Sam and the Byrd standing in the sunshine at the gate of cedar
poles that Sam had set up at the entrance of his wilderness, and I
don't believe I would have had the strength of character to go until I
had been introduced to every stick and stone on the farm if I hadn't
wanted so much to find out all about cows from Dr. Chubb. I drove slowly
and extracted the whole story from his enthusiastic old mind. What I
don't know about the bovine family now is not worth knowing, and I
believe I would enjoy undertaking to doctor a Texas herd. We parted with
vows of eternal mutual interest, and I expect to cherish that
friendship. It is not every day a girl has the chance to meet and profit
by such wisdom as a successful seventy-year-old veterinary surgeon is
obliged to possess.
</p><p>As I went up the stairs to my room I met mother coming down to her
half-after-eight breakfast, and she was mildly surprised that I had not
come home at a proper time and gone to bed; but when she heard that I
had been with Sam's sick cows all night she was perfectly satisfied,
even pleased. Mother rarely remembers that I am a girl. She has thought
in masculine terms so long that it is impossible for her to get her mind
to bear directly on the small feminine proprieties.
</p><p>"That's right, Betty, be a doer, no matter whom you do, even if it is
Sam's cow," said daddy, when I had finished my eulogy of Dr. Chubb and
beautiful old Mrs. Buttercup. Then he kissed mother and me and went on
down to his office, while she followed him to the gate, crocheting and
quite forgetting me.
</p><p>Completely exhausted, but feeling really more effective in life than I
ever had before, even at the Astor tea-table (because Peter had been
perfectly well and Sam's cows hadn't), I took a magazine with an
entrancing portrayal of a Belgian soldier apparently eleven feet tall on
the cover and went out on the side porch to sit in the cool spring
sunshine and pick up the pieces of myself. When I put myself together
again I found that I made something that looked like an illustration to
a farm article rather than the frontispiece to an American epic. Still,
if for a friend I could grasp a farm problem with that executive
enthusiasm, had I any reason to doubt that I would have any trouble in
helping along an epic of American life? I decided that I would not, and
settled down to find out about the eleven-foot Belgian before I crept
off for a nap, when an interruption came and I had to prop my eyes open.
It was Eph with a letter and the information that Redwheels had shed a
bolt in its flight last night. I settled the bolt question with a
quarter and turned to the letter. It was from Peter, and I knew by the
amount of ink splashed all over the envelope that it must contain a high
explosive splashed on the inside.
</p><p>Peter Vandyne really is a wonderful man, and he will enrich American
letters greatly after he has had time to live a lot of the things he has
planned to write. Farrington, the great producer and dramatist, had read
the first act of his epic and said good things about it, Farrington is
not a friend of Peter's sister, Mabel, nor does he own or want to buy
any of Judge Vandyne's stock in railroads or things. He's just really
the dean of the American stage. Could anybody blame Peter if he had used
ten pounds of paper, if paper comes by the pound, and a quart of ink
telling about it? But he didn't; about five of the seven pages were all
about me and Farrington. I never was so astonished. The morning I got
home I had written Peter about how all my friends had been glad to see
me, and the way the different ones had shown it, and Peter had read that
part to Mr. Farrington and he had said that Peter ought to get me to
supply some of the human comedy that Peter's play lacked. Peter knows so
much about life from his literary researches that it goes off and hides
from him when he sets out in search for it, and I understood immediately
what the great dramatist meant, though Peter probably did not.
</p><p>    So weave some of your heart spells for me, dearest dear
    Betty [Peter wrote], I am sending you the manuscript of
    Act I and part of Act II, and I know you will read them carefully
    and let me know fully what you think of them. Criticize
    them from your splendid human viewpoint. The dear old
    governor has been rather hard on me of late, and I may have
    to go into the office yet. Death! Help, rescue me, dear,
    for to put a play across will be my salvation from his prejudices.
    I must do it this summer, and then--then by the new year
    perhaps I can lay the gems of success at your feet. May I
    come down and talk to you soon about it all? No one knows
    what's in my heart but you, my own Betty. May I come?
</p><p><strong>PETER.</strong>
</p><p>I was extremely happy and excited over the poetical way in which Peter
was calling on my common sense to help him in his crisis, but I felt
weighted down with the responsibility. Yes, I understood the great
Farrington. He felt as I did--that Peter's genius needed to see and help
old Dr. Chubb drench Buttercup with a can of condition-mixture. Now,
could I supply all that, or enough of it to keep Peter from being
murdered in his father's office? The inky bundle at my side began to
look as if it weighed a ton, but my loyalty and affection for Peter made
me know that I must put my back to the burden and raise it somehow. If
it had been a simple burden, like three sick cows, it would have been
easier to take upon my shoulders. Then suddenly, as I was about to be in
a panic about it all, the thought of the cows reminded me of Sam, and
immediately, in my mind, I shared the weight of the manuscript with him
and began to breathe easier. The way Sam and Peter love each other
inspires positive awe in my heart, though Mabel says it is provoking
when they go off to their fraternity fishing-camp for week-ends instead
of coming to her delightful over-Sunday parties out on Long Island.
Judge Vandyne feels as I do about it, and he loves Sam as much as Peter
does, though I don't believe that he has any deeper affection for Peter
than Sam has. I've been intending to read up about David and Jonathan,
but I feel sure, from dim memories, that their histories about describe
Peter and Sam. I couldn't for the life of me see why any woman should
resent "a love that passes the love of" her, and I am sure she wouldn't
if one of them was a poet born to enlighten the world. Yes, I breathed
easier at the thought of Sam's affection for Peter, and went back to the
case of the giant Belgian, though I don't think the artist quite
intended him to be taken that way.
</p><p>Just as I had turned the front page I was interrupted by Clyde Tolbot,
who came whistling down the street and broke out all over with smiles
when he saw me out sunning myself.
</p><p>"Gee! Betty, but it is good to see you at home!" he said.
</p><p>They wore almost the exact words Sam had used, but they sounded
different. The sound is about all that is different in any of the things
men say to girls when they like them a lot. Tolly and I are very
appreciative of each other, and always have been.
</p><p>"You are going to settle down and have a royal good time, aren't you,
Betty? I learned a new foxtrot up in Louisville last week I'm dying to
teach you, and now that Sue Bankhead has got a great big dance machine
we can fox almost every night. Will you come with me this evening?"
</p><p>"I wish I could, Tolly," I said, with utter sincerity, for Tolly is the
very best dancer in the Harpeth Valley, not excepting Tom Pollard over
at Hillsboro. "But, Tolly, I must give up all thought of social
pleasures for a time." I spoke with a dignified reserve that fitted the
spirit that I ought to have when undertaking a great responsibility,
though I did want to dance. "I have some hard mental work to do."
</p><p>"Well, blast old Hayesboro for a sad hole! You are going to go in for
brain athletics, Sam Crittenden for farmer heroics, and the only movie
that has peeped into town is going to be closed because it ran a Latin
Quarter film the afternoon the ladies stopped in from the United
Charities sewing circle, expecting a Cuban missionary thriller. I might
as well have my left foot amputated, it itches so for good dancing."
Tolly was so furious that I was positively sorry for him, and to comfort
and calm him I told him all about Peter's letter and the play, and the
way I had to read and criticize and help. He sniffed at the idea of
Peter, but the dramatist impressed him slightly.
</p><p>"Say, that old boy is the real thing, Betty, child. He's the sure
win-out on Broadway. But how long will it take you to write that play
for your mollycoddle poet? You can get through with it before the
Country Club gets going good, can't you? We've had a new floor in the
dancing-pavilion built, and the directors ordered a foxy music machine
last night."
</p><p>"Oh yes, I ought to be able to tell Peter all I know in two and a half
months," I answered, ignoring Tolly's disrespect for my poet friend.
</p><p>"And a lot you don't know," Tolly added, with the candor of real
affection. "I wish Sam, the old calf, could be weaned from his cows and
take the position your dad is offering him at the Phosphate Works, so he
would be able to shake a foot occasionally. Can't you handle him a bit,
Betty? It's as if he just came out and looked at life and then dived
back in a hollow log."
</p><p>"I--I don't know," I answered, doubtfully. A pang shot through me at the
thought of any one extracting Sam from that wonderful retreat in the
woods, but then also this news of the honors that were coming to Peter
made me long to have Samuel Foster Crittenden come forth and take his
place in the world beside his friends. Sam, I felt sure, was made to
shine, not to have his light hid under a farm basket. Why, even Tolly,
there beside me on the steps, was the head of the new Electric Light
Company that Hayesboro has had a little over a year. He did it all
himself, though he had failed to pass his college examinations when he
went up for them with Sam.
</p><p>"I'm proud of the way you've been doing things, Tolly," I added, warmly,
putting my thoughts of Sam away where I keep them when I'm not using
them.
</p><p>"Oh, I'm just an old money-grubber and nobody's genius child, but I'll
rustle the gold boys to get up to New York to see your play, Betty, and
send you a wagon-load of florist's spinnach on the first night,"
answered Tolly, beaming at my words of praise.
</p><p>"Oh, Tolly, please don't think I'm going to write a play," I answered,
quickly. "I'm--well, I'm just going to tell Peter a whole lot of useful
things I find out about life. You see, Tolly, Peter's father has so many
millions of dollars that it has been almost impossible for Peter to
climb over them into real life as we have. I have to do it for him.
Please pity Peter, Tolly, and tell me what you think would be nice in
his play if you find anything."
</p><p>"Well--er--well, I have right in stock at present a little love-interest
tale I could unfold to you, Betty, about--Help! There comes the gentle
child Edith up the street now. I must go. I am too coarse-grained for
association with her." And before I could stop him he was gone through
the house and out the back way. That is the way it always is with Tolly
and Edith, either they are inseparable or entirely separate. They can't
seem to be coexistent citizens, and they have been fighting this way
since they both had on rompers. I wondered what Tolly had been doing
now.
</p><p>"Clyde Tolbot needn't have gone just because I came. I can endure him
when I have other people to help me," said Edith, as she kissed me and
sat down sadly. She is always sad when Tolly has been sinful.
</p><p>"What has Tolly been doing now?" I asked her, as I put that fascinating
Belgian face down on the floor and ruthlessly sat upon him, for the step
was getting cold, though the sun was delicious and had drawn out a nice
old bumblebee from his winter quarters to scout about the budding
honeysuckle over our heads.
</p><p>"I am so hurt that I wouldn't tell anybody about it but you, dear, but
last night as he walked home with me, after we had been dancing down at
Sue's to the new phonograph, he--he put his arm almost around me and I
think--I think he was going to kiss me if I hadn't prevented him--that
is, he did kiss my hair--I think." Edith is the pale-nun type, and I
wish she could have seen how lovely she was with the blush that even the
failure of Tolly to kiss her brought up under her deep-blue eyes. Edith
didn't get any farther north to school than Louisville, and her maiden
aunt, Miss Editha Shelby Morris Carruthers, brought her up perfectly
beautifully. I didn't know how to comfort her because I had been two
years at the Manor on the Hudson and then a year in Europe, and, though
nobody ever has directly kissed me, a girl's hand and hair don't seem to
count out in the world.
</p><p>To take Edith's mind off Tolly's perfidy I told her about the play, and
she was as impressed as anybody could wish her to be, and promised to
stand by me and make people understand why I couldn't dance and picnic
like other people because of this great work I had to do for a dear
friend. I told her not to tell anybody but Sue, and she went home
completely comforted by her friendly interest in Peter and me. In fact,
she really adored the idea of helping me help Peter, and seemed to
forget her anger at Tolly with a beautiful spirit.
</p><p>About that time Eph solemnly called me in to lunch. Eph is a nice,
jolly old negro until he gets a white linen jacket and apron on, and
then he turns into a black mummy. I think it is because I used to want
to talk to him at the table when I still sat in a high chair. I don't
believe he has any confidence in my discretion even now, and that is why
he seats me with such a grand and forbidding display of ceremony.
</p><p>"Betty dear," said mother, after Eph had served her chicken soup and
passed her the beaten biscuits, "I found an old note-book of my mother's
that has all the wonderful things she did to the negroes and other live
stock on her farm out in Harpeth Valley. You know she ran the whole
thousand acres herself after father's death in her twenty-seventh year,
and she was a wonderful woman, though she did have three girls and only
one son. There is a section of her notes devoted to cows and their
diseases, and Sam might be interested to hear how she managed them so
that even then her cows sold for enormous sums. Suppose you look over it
and tell him about it."
</p><p>"Oh, I will. Thank you, mother!" I answered, as I took three little
brown biscuits, to Eph's affectionate delight, and also as a shock to
his proprieties.
</p><p>I had planned to open the bundle and begin my work for Peter right after
dinner, but I sat down and devoured whole that note-book of my maternal
ancestor's. I never was so thrilled over anything, and the chapter on
gardening really reads like a beautiful idyl of summer. It changed my
entire nature. As I read I glowed to think that I could go right to
Sam's wilderness and try it all out. I didn't own any land, and it might
take a little time to force daddy to buy me some, and the planting
season and fever were upon me. There is a wide plateau to the south of
Sam's living-room, and I had in my mind cleared it of bushes, enriched
it with all the wonderful things grandmother had directed, beginning
with beautiful dead leaves, and I was planting out the row of great
blush peonies in my mind as I intended to plant it in Sam's garden when
the tall old clock in the hall toned out four long strokes. Then I
remembered that I wanted to go down to the post-office to get my mail
and to see everybody and hear the news. So with the greatest reluctance
I tucked the garden idyl in the old desk which had been that very
Grandmother Nelson's, and heaved Peter's heavy manuscript in on top of
it.
</p><p>No mass-meeting, no picnic, and no function out in the great world, even
New-Year's reception at the White House or afternoon tea at the Plaza,
could be half the fun that going to the Hayesboro post-office for the
afternoon mail is. I think the distinct flavor is imparted by the fact
that all our forefathers and foremothers have done it before us. The
Hayesboro resurrection will be held right there, I feel sure.
</p><p>And if mail-time is fun usually, it is great when all the news is about
you and your friends all swarm around you with interest. Everybody had
heard about Peter and his play, though neither Edith nor Tolly thought
they had told, and that he was soon coming down to visit me, and, of
course, that meant to visit all of Hayesboro. Miss Henrietta Spain, who
teaches literature from spelling to the English poets, in the Hayesboro
Academy, had read Peter's new poem--the one the <u>Literary Opinion</u> had
copied last month--and she was pink with excitement over the prospect of
having such a genius in our midst,
</p><p>"Look out that you don't get put in the play on the other side of the
footlights, Hayes," said the mayor, slapping daddy on the back. "Be
careful how you have a poet sitting around your house."
</p><p>"The South has long waited to have a genius come down and write a
fitting epic about her Homeric drama of Civil War, Elizabeth," said old
Colonel Menefee. "Let your young friend come, and I can give him
material, beginning with that Bedford Forest charge just before
Chickamauga that--"
</p><p>"And just remember," interrupted Mrs. Winston Polk, "how Elizabeth's
mother, Betty's own Grandmother Nelson, rode fifty miles and back in
twenty-four hours to get Morgan to send wagons for her barnful of corn
to feed his soldiers, though she and her negroes were dependent on what
she could grow between then and frost. She never faltered, but--"
</p><p>"The Nashville and Louisville papers all wrote up the way Clyde Tolbot
swam Salt River and stopped the L. &amp; N. express from going down in the
cut during the storm last year," Edith hastened to say when Mrs. Folk's
breath had given out. Tolly's ugly good face was beautiful to see when
she spoke of him thus, though Edith didn't notice it.
</p><p>When you start a Harpeth Valley town to telling how wonderful it is to
the third and fourth generation back, it is like a seething torrent and
can go on for ever. I glowed to think of all the wonderful things I
could write Peter, and we all started home from the post-office as late
as supper hour would admit.
</p><p>After I got home, escorted by the reunited Edith and Tolly, as well as
by Billy Robertson, who wants to be Peter's hero, though he wasn't
directly saying so, I sat down determinedly to write to Peter at
inspiring length and make him feel how I valued his confidence in me,
also to mention the war drama. Just then I raised my eyes and that
wonderful notebook had pushed a corner of itself out of the desk from
under the manuscript. I couldn't use my mind advising between a modern
epic and a war drama while it was plowed up ready for peonies, so I
decided to wait and ask Sam's advice about advising Peter, and I read
the rest of the peony pages in comfort. Right then, too, I made up my
mind that I was going to get ground bone to plant at the roots of all
the peonies if I had to use my own skeleton to do it and would only see
them bloom with astral eyes.
</p><p>I was still reading when the supper-bell rang, and was only interested
in reminiscences of Grandmother Nelson during the meal.
</p><p>"No, ma'am, Miss Caroline, you got it wrong. Ole Mis' didn't divide
clover pinks 'cepting every third year 'stid of second. <u>Hers</u> bloomed,
they did," Eph interrupted mother to say, indulging in perhaps his first
speech while waiting on the table during the long and honorable life as
a butler which that grandmother had started at his sixth year. He then
retired in the blackest consternation, and his yellow granddaughter, the
house-girl, brought in the wine-jelly.
</p><p>One thing is certain--I must contrive some way to get Sam back and forth
to me from The Briers in less time than it takes him to walk five miles.
He has got just one old roan plow mare and he won't ride her after he
has worked her all day, and I am afraid it won't do for me to go after
him with Redwheels every time I want him. I can go about two-thirds of
the time, but he must be allowed some liberty about expressing his
desire for my company. Of course a tactful woman can go nine-tenths of
the way in all things to meet a man she likes, and he'll think she
hasn't even started from home; but she ought to be honorable enough not
to do it at that rate. I believe in liberty for men as well as women.
</p><p>Still, I can't express the strain it was on me to wait until after eight
o'clock for Sam with Grandmother Nelson's farm-book on my knee, and I
don't want to do it ever again, especially if the Byrd or Mammy or the
cows or any of the other live stock might be sick. I felt that it must
be midnight before I got Sam seated by me on the deep old mahogany sofa
in front of one nice April blaze in behind the brass fender, and under
another from Tolly's power-house. He was pretty tired, as he had been up
since daylight, but the cows were all right and on feed again, Mammy
wasn't any stiffer than usual, and he had promised the Byrd the first
chicken that the old Dominicker hatched out to stay at home and let him
come to see me. Mammy had sent me five fresh eggs, and Sam presented
them with a queer pod of little round black seeds, and a smile that
wouldn't look me in the face.
</p><p>"Hollyhocks! I climbed over the Johnson fence about two miles from town
and stole them for you," he said, as he squirmed around from me and
picked a brown burr off the leg of his trousers.
</p><p>"Aren't they sweeties?" I exclaimed, not noticing his entirely
unnecessary bashfulness. "And that is just what I want to talk to you
about." With which I produced my ancestral treasure, and with our heads
close together we dove into it, didn't come up until after ten o'clock,
and then were breathless.
</p><p>"Oh, Sam, can I do all these things out at your farm?" I exclaimed, and
I fairly clung against his shoulder while his strong, rough hand folded
over mine as the husk did over the hollyhock seeds I had been holding
warm and moist in my palm.
</p><p>"All of them, and then some, Betty," he answered, blowing away a wisp of
my hair that he had again roughed up instead of shaking hands in
greeting, despite my reproof. "I'll plow up that southern plot for you
just after daylight to-morrow, and every minute I can take from
grubbing at the things I have to work to make the eats for all of us
I'll put in on the posy-garden for you."
</p><p>"I'm much obliged to you for the plowing, but I'll be out at about nine
o'clock and I'll bring my own spade and hoe and rake and things. I think
I'll take those two young white lilacs that are crowded over by the
fence in the front yard to start the garden. Don't you think lilacs
would be a lovely corner for a garden like my grandmother's, Sam?"
</p><p>"I--I think it would be nice to--plant the hollyhock seeds you have in
your hand the first thing, Betty," answered Sam, with the gridiron
smolder in his eyes which snapped up into a twinkle as he added, "Could
you help me set onions for a few hours later on?"
</p><p>"Oh, I'd adore it!" I answered, enthusiastically. "Of course, I mean to
help plant all the eat things, too. I may like them best. Let's see what
grandmother says about onions." And I began to ruffle back the pages of
the book that Sam held in both his hands for me.
</p><p>"Good gracious! Betty, couldn't the old lady write!" exclaimed Sam, a
half-hour later, after we had finished with onions and many other
profitable vegetables. "Why, that description of her hog's dying with
cholera and the rescue reads like a--a Greek tragedy in its simplicity."
</p><p>"Oh, Sam," I exclaimed in dismay, "that reminds me, I forgot to tell you
about the play, and now you ought to go home, with all those five miles
to walk and plowing to do at daylight." "Play? What play? Won't it
keep?" asked Sam, as he rose and reached for his hat on the table.
"Let's enjoy this last ten minutes before my hike, down at the gate."
</p><p>"Oh no, it won't keep, and I don't know exactly what I will do about it
and the garden. Here's Peter's letter; read it for yourself," I wailed,
as I drew the splashed letter out from the ruffle in the front of my
dress where I had stuck it for safe keeping, and handed it to Sam. If I
hadn't been so distressed by the collision of the play and the garden in
my heart I never would have been so dishonorable as to let Sam read the
last paragraph in Peter's letter, which was more affectionate than I
felt was really right for Peter to write me, even after the Astor
tea-party, and which had troubled me faintly until I had forgotten about
it in my excitement about Farrington and the play. I saw Sam's hand
shake as he read that last page, and he held it away from me and
finished it, as I remembered and gasped and reached for it.
</p><p>"Good old Pete," said Sam, in a voice that shook as his hand did while
he handed me back the letter. "It is a great chance for him, and if you
can help you'll have to go to it, Betty. Pete only needs ballast, and
you are it--he seems to think."
</p><p>"But how will I find time enough from making our garden to help make his
play?" I asked as I rose and clung to his sleeve as I had done in all
serious moments of my life, even when his coat-sleeve had been that of
a roundabout jacket. My heart was weak and jumpy as I asked the
question.
</p><p>"Betty," said Sam, gently, lifting my hand from his arm into his for a
second and then handing it firmly back to me, "that garden was just a
dream you and I have been having this evening. It can't be. Don't you
see, dear, I am in a hard hand-to-hand struggle with my land, which is
all I possess, for--for bread for myself and the kiddie, and I--I can't
have a woman's flower-garden. It looks as if you and old Petie can do a
real literary stunt together. Just get at it, and God bless you both.
Good night now; I must sprint." And as he spoke he was through one of
the long windows and out on the front porch in the moonlight.
</p><p>"Oh, wait, Sam, wait!" I gasped, as I flew after him and clung to him
determinedly.
</p><p>"Well," he said, patiently, as he stood on the step below me and turned
his bronze head away from me out toward his dim hills sleeping in the
soft mystery of the moonlight.
</p><p>"I will, Sam, I <u>will</u> have that garden," I said, with the same angry
determination in my voice I had used when I had clung to him and kicked
and fought to go to places with him when he didn't want me, and when my
skirts were several inches above my bare knees and his feet were
scratched and innocent of shoes.
</p><p>"Betty," said Sam, as he shook me away from him and then took my
shoulders under their thin covering of chiffon in his plow-calloused,
big, warm hands, "forget it! There are lots of dream gardens out in the
world you can play in when you have time away from the bright lights.
Everybody grows 'em without a lick of work. I have to work mine or
starve. Good night!" Then with a rough of my hair down across my eyes he
was out in the moonlit road, running away from me to his hollow log in a
way he had never done before, no matter how I had tagged him.
</p><p>I ran as far as the gate to watch him out of sight, and then I put my
head down against the tall old post that had been one of Sam's perches
when he wanted to climb away from me in former years, and sobbed and
sobbed. I had never expected Sam to cast me off.
</p><p>Girls' hearts are covered all over with little thin crystallizations of
affection, and men ought to be very careful not to smash any of them
with their superior strength. Sam had hurt me so that I didn't even dare
think about it. I knew he was poor, and I hadn't expected him to plow
and plant things for me while I went about in a picture-hat snipping
them with garden scissors. I had asked him to let me set onions and weed
beans and drop peas and corn for him and share his poverty and hard work
as a true friend, and he had shut his cedar-pole gate in my face and
heart. And I didn't understand why. I tried to think it was his
affection for Peter that made him thus rudely switch my mind from him
and his garden to Peter and his need of me, which Sam may have thought
was greater than the need of his onions and turnip salad; but I don't
see how Sam could have construed cruelty to me as generosity to Peter.
</p><p>"Please God," I prayed out into the everlasting hills toward which Sam
was running away from me and from which I had heard intoned "cometh
help," "give me dirt to work in somewhere except in just a yard if I
can't have Sam's. Help me to get somebody to help me to raise things for
people to eat and milk, as well as to inspire a play. I'll do both
things, but I must have earth with rotted leaves in it. Amen."
</p><p>Then I went to bed heartbroken for life, and my sad eyes closed on the
little glimpse which my window framed of Old Harpeth, the tallest hill
in Paradise Ridge, while my hand still folded in the moist hollyhock
seeds.
