<p>Then came the weariest time of waiting the brethren had ever
known, or were to know, although at first they did not feel it so
long and heavy. Water trickled from the walls of this cave, and
Wulf, who was parched with thirst, gathered it in his hands and
drank till he was satisfied. Then he let it run upon his head to
cool its aching; and Godwin bathed such of his brother's hurts
and bruises as could be come at, for he did not dare to remove
the hauberk, and so gave him comfort.
</p>
<p>When this was done, and he had looked to the saddles and
trappings of the horses, Wulf told of all that had passed between
him and Lozelle on the bridge. How at the first onset his spear
had caught in the links of and torn away the head-piece of his
foe, who, if the lacings had not burst, would have been hurled to
death, while that of Lozelle struck his buckler fair and
shattered on it, rending it from his arm. How they pushed past
each other, and for a moment the fore hoofs of Smoke hung over
the abyss, so that he thought he was surely sped: How at the next
course Lozelle's spear passed beneath his arm, while his,
striking full upon Sir Hugh's breast, brought down the black
horse and his rider as though a thunderbolt had smitten them, and
how Smoke, that could not check its furious pace, leapt over
them, as a horse leaps a-hunting: How he would not ride down
Lozelle, but dismounted to finish the fray in knightly fashion,
and, being shieldless, received the full weight of the great
sword upon his mail, so that he staggered back and would have
fallen had he not struck against the horse.
</p><p>Then he told of the blows that followed, and of his last that
wounded Lozelle, shearing through his mail and felling him as an
ox is felled by the butcher: How also, when he sprang forward to
kill him, this mighty and brutal man had prayed for mercy, prayed
it in the name of Christ and of their own mother, whom as a child
he knew in Essex: How he could not slaughter him, being helpless,
but turned away, saying that he left him to be dealt with by
Al-je-bal, whereupon this traitorous dog sprang up and strove to
knife him. He told also of their last fearful struggle, and how,
shaken as he was by the blow upon his back, although the point of
the dagger had not pierced his mail, he strove with Lozelle, man
to man; till at length his youth, great natural strength, and the
skill he had in wrestling, learnt in many a village bout at home,
enabled him to prevail, and, while they hung together on the
perilous edge of the gulf, to free his right hand, draw his
poniard, and make an end.
</p><p>"Yet," added Wulf, "never shall I forget the look of that man's
eyes as he fell backwards, or the whistling scream which came
from his pierced throat."
</p><p>"At least there is a rogue the less in the world, although he was
a brave one in his own knavish fashion," answered Godwin.
"Moreover, my brother," he added, placing his arm about Wulf's
neck, "I am glad it fell to you to fight him, for at the last
grip your might overcame, where I, who am not so strong, should
have failed. Further, I think you did well to show mercy, as a
good knight should; that thereby you have gained great honour,
and that if his spirit can see through the darkness, our dead
uncle is proud of you now, as I am, my brother."
</p><p>"I thank you," replied Wulf simply; "but, in this hour of
torment, who can think of such things as honour gained?"
</p><p>Then, lest he should grow stiff, who was sorely bruised beneath
his mail, they began to walk up and down the cave from where the
horses stood to where the two dead Assassins lay by the door, the
faint light gleaming upon their stern, dark features. Ill company
they seemed in that silent, lonely place.
</p><p>The time crept on; the moon sank towards the mountains.
</p><p>"What if they do not come?" asked Wulf.
</p><p>"Let us wait to think of it till dawn," answered Godwin.
</p><p>Again they walked the length of the cave and back.
</p><p>"How can they come, the door being barred?" asked Wulf.
</p><p>"How did Masouda come and go?" answered Godwin. "Oh, question me
no more; it is in the hand of God."
</p><p>"Look," said Wulf, in a whisper. "Who stand yonder at the end of
the cave--there by the dead men?"
</p><p>"Their spirits, perchance," answered Godwin, drawing his sword
and leaning forward. Then he looked, and true enough there stood
two figures faintly outlined in the gloom. They glided towards
them, and now the level moonlight shone upon their white robes
and gleamed in the gems they wore.
</p><p>"I cannot see them," said a voice. "Oh, those dead soldiers--what
do they portend?"
</p><p>"At least yonder stand their horses," answered another voice.
</p><p>Now the brethren guessed the truth, and, like men in a dream,
stepped forward from the shadow of the wall.
</p><p>"Rosamund!" they said.
</p><p>"Oh Godwin! oh Wulf!" she cried in answer. "Oh, Jesu, I thank
Thee, I thank Thee--Thee, and this brave woman!" and, casting her
arms about Masouda, she kissed her on the face.
</p><p>Masouda pushed her back, and said, in a voice that was almost
harsh: "It is not fitting, Princess, that your pure lips should
touch the cheek of a woman of the Assassins."
</p><p>But Rosamund would not be repulsed.
</p><p>"It is most fitting," she sobbed, "that I should give you thanks
who but for you must also have become 'a woman of the Assassins,'
or an inhabitant of the House of Death."
</p><p>Then Masouda kissed her back, and, thrusting her away into the
arms of Wulf, said roughly:
</p><p>"So, pilgrims Peter and John, your patron saints have brought you
through so far; and, John, you fight right well. Nay, do not stop
for our story, if you wish us to live to tell it. What! You have
the soldiers' horses with your own? Well done! I did not credit
you with so much wit. Now, Sir Wulf, can you walk? Yes; so much
the better; it will save you a rough ride, for this place is
steep, though not so steep as one you know of. Now set the
princess upon Flame, for no cat is surer-footed than that horse,
as you may remember, Peter. I who know the path will lead it.
John, take you the other two; Peter, do you follow last of all
with Smoke, and, if they hang back, prick them with your sword.
Come, Flame, be not afraid, Flame. Where I go, you can come," and
Masouda thrust her way through the bushes and over the edge of
the cliff, talking to the snorting horse and patting its neck.
</p><p>A minute more, and they were scrambling down a mountain ridge so
steep that it seemed as though they must fall and be dashed to
pieces at the bottom. Yet they fell not, for, made as it had been
to meet such hours of need, this road was safer than it appeared,
with ridges cut in the rock at the worst places.
</p><p>Down they went, and down, till at length, panting, but safe, they
stood at the bottom of the darksome gulf where only the starlight
shone, for here the rays of the low moon could not reach.
</p><p>"Mount," said Masouda. "Princess, stay you on Flame; he is the
surest and the swiftest. Sir Wulf, keep your own horse Smoke;
your brother and I will ride those of the soldiers. Though not
very swift, doubtless they are good beasts, and accustomed to
such roads." Then she leapt to the saddle as a woman born in the
desert can, and pushed her horse in front.
</p><p>For a mile or more Masouda led them along the rocky bottom of the
gulf, where because of the stones they could only travel at a
foot pace, till they came to a deep cleft on the left hand, up
which they began to ride. By now the moon was quite behind the
mountains, and such faint light as came from the stars began to
be obscured with drifting clouds. Still, they stumbled on till
they reached a little glade where water ran and grass grew.
</p><p>"Halt," said Masouda. "Here we must wait till dawn for in this
darkness the horses cannot keep their footing on the stones.
Moreover, all about us lie precipices, over one of which we might
fall."
</p><p>"But they will pursue us," pleaded Rosamund.
</p><p>"Not until they have light to see by," answered Masouda, "or at
least we must take the risk, for to go forward would be madness.
Sit down and rest a while, and let the horses drink a little and
eat a mouthful of grass, holding their reins in our hands, for we
and they may need all our strength before to-morrow's sun is set.
Sir Wulf, say, are you much hurt?"
</p><p>"But very little," he answered in a cheerful voice; "a few
bruises beneath my mail--that is all, for Lozelle's sword was
heavy. Tell us, I pray you, what happened after we rode away from
the castle bridge."
</p><p>"This, knights. The princess here, being overcome, was escorted
by the slaves back to her chambers, but Sinan bade me stay with
him awhile that he might speak to you through me. Do you know
what was in his mind? To have you killed at once, both of you,
whom Lozelle had told him were this lady's lovers, and not her
brothers. Only he feared that there might be trouble with the
people, who were pleased with the fighting, so held his hand.
Then he bade you to the supper, whence you would not have
returned; but when Sir Wulf said that he was hurt, I whispered to
him that what he wished to do could best be done on the morrow at
the wedding-feast when he was in his own halls, surrounded by his
guards.
</p><p>"'Ay,' he answered, 'these brethren shall fight with them until
they are driven into the gulf. It will be a goodly sight for me
and my queen to see.'"
</p><p>"Oh! horrible, horrible!" said Rosamund; while Godwin muttered:
</p><p>"I swear that I would have fought, not with his guards, but with
Sinan only."
</p><p>"So he suffered you to go, and I left him also. Before I went he
spoke to me, bidding me bring the princess to him privately
within two hours after we had supped, as he wished to speak to
her alone about the ceremony of her marriage on the morrow, and
to make her gifts. I answered aloud that his commands should be
obeyed, and hurried to the guest-castle. There I found your lady
recovered from her faintness, but mad with fear, and forced her
to eat and drink.
</p><p>"The rest is short. Before the two hours were gone a messenger
came, saying that the Al-je-bal bade me do what he had commanded.
</p><p>"'Return,' I answered; 'the princess adorns herself. We follow
presently alone, as it is commanded.'
</p><p>"Then I threw this cloak about her and bade her be brave, and, if
we failed, to choose whether she would take Sinan or death for
lord. Next, I took the ring you had, the Signet of the dead
Al-je-bal, who gave it to your kinsman, and held it before the
slaves, who bowed and let me pass. We came to the guards, and to
them again I showed the ring. They bowed also, but when they saw
that we turned down the passage to the left and not to the
right, as we should have done to come to the doors of the inner
palace, they would have stopped us.
</p><p>"'Acknowledge the Signet,' I answered. 'Dogs, what is it to you
which road the Signet takes?' Then they also let us pass.
</p><p>"Now, following the passage, we were out of the guest house and
in the gardens, and I led her to what is called the prison tower,
whence runs the secret way. Here were more guards whom I bade
open in the name of Sinan.
</p><p>"They said: 'We obey not. This place is shut save to the Signet
itself.'
</p><p>"'Behold it!' I answered. The officer looked and said: 'It is
the very Signet, sure enough, and there is no other.'
</p><p>"Yet he paused, studying the black stone veined with the red
dagger and the ancient writing on it.
</p><p>"'Are you, then, weary of life?' I asked. 'Fool, the Al-je-bal
himself would keep a tryst within this house, which he enters
secretly from the palace. Woe to you if he does not find his lady
there!'
</p><p>"'It is the Signet that he must have sent, sure enough,' the
captain said again, 'to disobey which is death.'
</p><p>"'Yes, open, open,' whispered his companions.
</p><p>"So they opened, though doubtfully, and we entered, and I barred
the door behind us. Then, to be short, through the darkness of
the tower basement, guiding ourselves by the wall, we crept to
the entrance of that way of which I know the secret. Ay, and
along all its length and through the rock door of escape at the
end of which I set so that none can turn it, save skilled masons
with their tools, and into the cave where we found you. It was no
great matter, having the Signet, although without the Signet it
had not been possible to-night, when every gate is guarded."
</p><p>"No great matter!" gasped Rosamund. "Oh, Godwin and Wulf! if you
could know how she thought of and made ready everything; if you
could have seen how all those cruel men glared at us, searching
out our very souls! If you could have heard how high she answered
them, waving that ring before their eyes and bidding them to obey
its presence, or to die!"
</p><p>"Which they surely have done by now," broke in Masouda quietly,
"though I do not pity them, who were wicked. Nay; thank me not; I
have done what I promised to do, neither less nor more, and--I
love danger and a high stake. Tell us your story, Sir Godwin."
</p><p>So, seated there on the grass in the darkness, he told them of
their mad ride and of the slaying of the guards, while Rosamund
raised her hands and thanked Heaven for its mercies, and that
they were without those accursed walls.
</p><p>"You may be within them again before sunset," said Masouda
grimly.
</p><p>"Yes," answered Wulf, "but not alive. Now what plan have you? To
ride for the coast towns?"
</p><p>"No," replied Masouda; "at least not straight, since to do so we
must pass through the country of the Assassins, who by this day's
light will be warned to watch for us. We must ride through the
desert mountain lands to Emesa, many miles away, and cross the
Orontes there, then down into Baalbec, and so back to Beirut."
</p><p>"Emesa?" said Godwin. "Why Saladin holds that place, and of
Baalbec the lady Rosamund is princess."
</p><p>"Which is best?" asked Masouda shortly. "That she should fall
into the hands of Salah-ed-din, or back into those of the master
of the Assassins? Choose which you wish."
</p><p>"I choose Salah-ed-din," broke in Rosamund, "for at least he is
my uncle, and will do me no wrong." Nor, knowing the case, did
the others gainsay her.
</p><p>Now at length the summer day began to break, and while it was
still too dark to travel, Godwin and Rosamund let the horses
graze, holding them by their bridles. Masouda, also, taking off
the hauberk of Wulf, doctored his bruises as best she could with
the crushed leaves of a bush that grew by the stream, having
first washed them with water, and though the time was short,
eased him much. Then, so soon as the dawn was grey, having drunk
their fill and, as they had nothing else, eaten some watercress
that grew in the stream, they tightened their saddle girths and
started. Scarcely had they gone a hundred yards when, from the
gulf beneath, that was hidden in grey mists, they heard the sound
of horse's hoofs and men's voices.
</p><p>"Push on," said Masouda, "Al-je-bal is on our tracks."
</p><p>Upwards they climbed through the gathering light, skirting the
edge of dreadful precipices which in the gloom it would have been
impossible to pass, till at length they reached a great table
land, that ran to the foot of some mountains a dozen miles or
more away. Among those mountains soared two peaks, set close
together. To these Masouda pointed, saying that their road ran
between them, and that beyond lay the valley of the Orontes.
While she spoke, far behind them they heard the sound of men
shouting, although they could see nothing because of the dense
mist.
</p><p>"Push on," said Masouda; "there is no time to spare," and they
went forward, but only at a hand gallop, for the ground was
still rough and the light uncertain.
</p><p>When they had covered some six miles of the distance between them
and the mountain pass, the sun rose suddenly and sucked up the
mist. This was what they saw. Before them lay a flat, sandy
plain; behind, the stony ground that they had traversed, and
riding over it, two miles from them, some twenty men of the
Assassins.
</p><p>"They cannot catch us," said Wulf; but Masouda pointed to the
right, where the mist still hung, and said:
</p><p>"Yonder I see spears."
</p><p>Presently it thinned, and there a league away they saw a great
body of mounted soldiers--perhaps there were four hundred.
</p><p>"Look," she said; "they have come round during the night, as I
feared they would. Now we must cross the path before them or be
taken," and she struck her horse fiercely with a stick she had
cut at the stream. Half a mile further on a shout from the great
body of men to their right, which was answered by another shout
from those behind, told them that they were seen.
</p><p>"On!" said Masouda. "The race will be close." So they began to
gallop their best.
</p><p>Two miles were done, but although that behind was far off, the
great cloud of dust to their right grew ever nearer till it
seemed as though it must reach the mouth of the mountain pass
before them. Then Godwin spoke:
</p><p>"Wulf and Rosamund ride on. Your horses are swift and can outpace
them. At the crest of the mountain pass wait a while to breathe
the beasts, and see if we come. If not, ride on again, and God be
with you."
</p><p>"Ay," said Masouda, "ride and head for the Emesa bridge--it can
be seen from far--and there yield yourselves to the officers of
Salah-ed-din."
</p><p>They hung back, but in a stern voice Godwin repeated:
</p><p>"Ride, I command you both."
</p><p>"For Rosamund's sake, so be it," answered Wulf.
</p><p>Then he called to Smoke and Flame, and they stretched
themselves out upon the sand and passed thence swifter than
swallows. Soon Godwin and Masouda, toiling behind, saw them enter
the mouth of the pass.
</p><p>"Good," she said. "Except those of their own breed, there are no
horses in Syria that can catch those two. They will come to
Emesa, have no fear."
</p><p>"Who was the man who brought them to us?" asked Godwin, as they
galloped side by side, their eyes fixed upon the ever-nearing
cloud of dust, in which the spear points sparkled.
</p><p>"My father's brother--my uncle, as I called him," she answered.
"He is a sheik of the desert, who owns the ancient breed that
cannot be bought for gold."
</p><p>"Then you are not of the Assassins, Masouda?"
</p><p>"No; I may tell you, now that the end seems near. My father was
an Arab, my mother a noble Frank, a French woman, whom he found
starving in the desert after a fight, and took to his tent and
made his wife. The Assassins fell upon us and killed him and her,
and captured me as a child of twelve. Afterwards, when I grew
older, being beautiful in those days, I was taken to the harem of
Sinan, and, although in secret I had been bred up a Christian by
my mother, they swore me of his accursed faith. Now you will
understand why I hate him so sorely who murdered my father and my
mother, and made me what I am; why I hold myself so vile also.
Yes, I have been forced to serve as his spy or be killed, who,
although he believed me his faithful slave, desired first to be
avenged upon him."
</p><p>"I do not hold you vile," panted Godwin, as he spurred his
labouring steed. "I hold you most noble."
</p><p>"I rejoice to hear it before we die," she answered, looking him
in the eyes in such a fashion that he dropped his head before her
burning gaze, "who hold you dear, Sir Godwin, for whose sake I
have dared these things, although I am nought to you. Nay, speak
not; the lady Rosamund has told me all that story--except its
answer."
</p><p>Now they were off the sand over which they had been racing side
by side, and beginning to breast the mountain slope, nor was
Godwin sorry that the clatter of their horses' hoofs upon the
stones prevented further speech between them. So far they had
outpaced the Assassins, who had a longer and a rougher road to
travel; but the great cloud of dust was not seven hundred yards
away, and in front of it, shaking their spears, rode some of the
best mounted of their soldiers.
</p><p>"These horses still have strength; they are better than I thought
them," cried Masouda. "They will not gain on us across the
mountains, but afterwards--"
</p><p>For the next league they spoke no more, who must keep their
horses from falling as they toiled up the steep path. At length
they reached the crest, and there, on the very top of it, saw
Wulf and Rosamund standing by Flame and Smoke.
</p><p>"They rest," Godwin said, then he shouted, "Mount! mount! The foe
is close."
</p><p>So they climbed to their saddles again, and, all four of them
together began to descend the long slope that stretched to the
plain two leagues beneath. Far off across this plain ran a broad
silver streak, beyond which from that height they could see the
walls of a city.
</p><p>"The Orontes!" cried Masouda. "Cross that, and we are safe." But
Godwin looked first at his horse, then at Masouda, and shook his
head.
</p><p>Well might he do so, for, stout-hearted as they were, the beasts
were much distressed that had galloped so far without drawing
rein. Down the steep road they plunged, panting; indeed at times
it was hard to keep them on their feet.
</p><p>"They will reach the plain--no more," said Godwin, and Masouda
nodded.
</p><p>The descent was almost done, and not a mile behind them the
white-robed Assassins streamed endlessly. Godwin plied his spurs
and Masouda her whip, although with little hope, for they knew
that the end was near. Down the last declivity they rushed, till
suddenly, as they reached its foot, Masouda's horse reeled,
stopped, and sank to the ground, while Godwin's pulled up beside
it.
</p><p>"Ride on!" he cried to Rosamund and Wulf in front; but they
would not. He stormed at them, but they replied: "Nay, we will
die together."
</p><p>Masouda looked at the horses Flame and Smoke, which seemed but
little troubled.
</p><p>"So be it," she said; "they have carried double before, and must
again. Mount in front of the lady, Sir Godwin; and, Sir Wulf,
give me your hand, and you will learn what this breed can do."
</p><p>So they mounted. Forward started Flame and Smoke with a long,
swinging gallop, while from the Assassins above, who thought that
they held them, went up a shout of rage and wonder.
</p><p>"Their horses are also tired, and we may beat them yet," called
the dauntless Masouda. But Godwin and Wulf looked sadly at the
ten miles of plain between them and the river bank.
</p><p>On they went, and on. A quarter of it was done. Half of it was
done, but now the first of the fedai hung upon their flanks not
two hundred yards behind. Little by little this distance
lessened. At length they were scarcely fifty yards away, and one
of them flung a spear. In her terror Rosamund sobbed aloud.
</p><p>"Spur the horses, knights," cried Masouda, and for the first time
they spurred them.
</p><p>At the sting of the steel Flame and Smoke sprang forward as
though they had but just left their stable door, and the gap
between pursuers and pursued widened. Two more miles were done,
and scarce seven furlongs from them they saw the broad mouth of
the bridge, while the towers of Emesa beyond seemed so close that
in this clear air they could discern the watchmen outlined
against the sky. Then they descended a little valley, and lost
sight of bridge and town.
</p><p>At the rise of the opposing slope the strength of Flame and Smoke
at last began to fail beneath their double burdens. They panted
and trembled; and, save in short rushes, no longer answered to
the spur. The Assassins saw, and came on with wild shouts. Nearer
and nearer they drew, and the sound of their horses hoofs beating
on the sand was like the sound of thunder. Now once more they
were fifty yards away, and now but thirty, and again the spears
began to flash, though none struck them.
</p><p>Masouda screamed to the horses in Arabic, and gallantly did they
struggle, plunging up the hill with slow, convulsive bounds.
Godwin and Wulf looked at each other, then, at a signal, checked
their speed, leapt to earth, and, turning, drew their swords.
</p><p>"On!" they cried, and lightened of their weight, once more the
reeling horses plunged forward.
</p><p>The Assassins were upon them. Wulf struck a mighty blow and
emptied the saddle of the first, then was swept to earth. As he
fell from behind him he heard a scream of joy, and struggling to
his knees, looked round. Lo! from over the crest of the rise
rushed squadron upon squadron of turbaned cavalry, who, as they
came, set their lances in rest, and shouted:
</p><p>"Salah-ed-din! Salah-ed-din!"
</p><p>The Assassins saw also, and turned to fly--too late!
</p><p>"A horse! A horse!" screamed Godwin in Arabic; and presently--
how he never knew--found himself mounted and charging with the
Saracens.
</p><p>To Wulf, too, a horse was brought, but he could not struggle to
its saddle. Thrice he strove, then fell backwards and lay upon
the sand, waving his sword and shouting where he lay, while
Masouda stood by him, a dagger in her hand, and with her Rosamund
upon her knees.
</p><p>Now the pursuers were the pursued, and dreadful was the reckoning
that they must pay. Their horses were outworn and could not fly
at speed. Some of the fedai were cut down upon them. Some
dismounted, and gathering themselves in little groups, fought
bravely till they were slain, while a few were taken prisoners.
Of all that great troup of men not a score won back alive to
Masyaf to make report to their master of how the chase of his
lost bride had ended.
</p><p>A while later and Wulf from his seat upon the ground saw Godwin
riding back towards him, his red sword in his hand. With him rode
a sturdy, bright-eyed man gorgeously apparelled, at the sight of
whom Rosamund sprang to her feet; then, as he dismounted, ran
forward and with a little cry cast her arms about him.
</p><p>"Hassan! Prince Hassan! Is it indeed you? Oh, God be praised!"
she gasped, then, had not Masouda caught her, would have fallen.
</p><p>The Emir looked at her, her long hair loose, her face stained,
her veil torn, but still clad in the silk and gleaming gems with
which she had been decked as the bride-elect of Al-je-bal. Then
low to the earth he bent his knee, while the grave Saracens
watched, and taking the hem of her garment, he kissed it.
</p><p>"Allah be praised indeed!" he said. "I, His unworthy servant,
thank Him from my heart, who never thought to see you living
more. Soldiers, salute. Before you stands the lady Rose of the
World, princess of Baalbec and niece of your lord, Salah-ed-din,
Commander of the Faithful."
</p><p>Then in stately salutation to this dishevelled, outworn, but
still queenly woman, uprose hand, and spear, and scimitar, while
Wulf cried from where he lay:
</p><p>"Why, it is our merchant of the drugged wine--none other! Oh! Sir
Saracen, does not the memory of that chapman's trick shame you
now?"
</p><p>The emir Hassan heard and grew red, muttering in his beard:
</p><p>"Like you, Sir Wulf, I am the slave of Fate, and must obey. Be
not bitter against me till you know all."
</p><p>"I am not bitter," answered Wulf, "but I always pay for my drink,
and we will settle that score yet, as I have sworn."
</p><p>"Hush!" broke in Rosamund. "Although he stole me, he is also my
deliverer and friend through many a peril, and, had it not been
for him, by now--" and she shuddered.
</p><p>"I do not know all the story, but, Princess, it seems that you
should thank not me, but these goodly cousins of yours and those
splendid horses," and Hassan pointed to Smoke and Flame, which
stood by quivering, with hollow flanks and drooping heads.
</p><p>"There is another whom I must thank also, this noble woman, as
you will call her also when you hear the story," said Rosamund,
flinging her arm about the neck of Masouda.
</p><p>"My master will reward her," said Hassan. "But oh! lady, what
must you think of me who seemed to desert you so basely? Yet I
reasoned well. In the castle of that son of Satan, Sinan," and he
spat upon the ground, "I could not have aided you, for there he
would only have butchered me. But by escaping I thought that I
might help, so I bribed the Frankish knave with the priceless
Star of my House," and he touched the great jewel that he wore in
his turban, "and with what money I had, to loose my bonds, and
while he pouched the gold I stabbed him with his own knife and
fled. But this morning I reached yonder city in command of ten
thousand men, charged to rescue you if I could; if not, to avenge
you, for the ambassadors of Salah-ed-din informed me of your
plight. An hour ago the watchmen on the towers reported that they
saw two horses galloping across the plain beneath a double
burden, pursued by soldiers whom from their robes they took to be
Assassins. So, as I have a quarrel with the Assassins, I crossed
the bridge, formed up five hundred men in a hollow, and waited,
never guessing that it was you who fled. You know the rest--and
the Assassins know it also, for," he added grimly, "you have been
well avenged."
</p><p>"Follow it up," said Wulf, "and the vengeance shall be better,
for I will show you the secret way into Masyaf--or, if I cannot,
Godwin will--and there you may hurl Sinan from his own towers."
</p><p>Hassan shook his head and answered:
</p><p>"I should like it well, for with this magician my master also has
an ancient quarrel. But he has other feuds upon his hands," and
he looked meaningly at Wulf and Godwin, "and my orders were to
rescue the princess and no more. Well, she has been rescued, and
some hundreds of heads have paid the price of all that she has
suffered. Also, that secret way of yours will be safe enough by
now. So there I let the matter bide, glad enough that it has
ended thus. Only I warn you all--and myself also--to walk warily,
since, if I know aught of him, Sinan's fedais will henceforth dog
the steps of every one of us, striving to bring us to our ends by
murder. Now here come litters; enter them, all of you, and be
borne to the city, who have ridden far enough to-day. Fear not
for your horses; they shall be led in gently and saved alive, if
skill and care can save them. I go to count the slain, and will
join you presently in the citadel."
</p><p>So the bearers came and lifted up Wulf, and helped Godwin from
his horse--for now that all was over he could scarcely stand--and
with him Rosamund and Masouda. Placing them in the litters, they
carried them, escorted by cavalry, across the bridge of the
Orontes into the city of Emesa, where they lodged them in the
citadel.
</p><p>Here also, after giving them a drink of barley gruel, and rubbing
their backs and legs with ointment, they led the horses Smoke and
Flame, slowly and with great trouble, for these could hardly
stir, and laid them down on thick beds of straw, tempting them
with food, which after awhile they ate. The four--Rosamund,
Masouda, Godwin, and Wulf--ate also of some soup with wine in
it, and after the hurts of Wulf had been tended by a skilled
doctor, went to their beds, whence they did not rise again for
two days.
