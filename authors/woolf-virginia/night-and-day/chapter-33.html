<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Considering that Mr. Hilbery lived in a house which was accurately
numbered in order with its fellows, and that he filled up forms,
paid rent, and had seven more years of tenancy to run, he had
an excuse for laying down laws for the conduct of those who lived
in his house, and this excuse, though profoundly inadequate, he
found useful during the interregnum of civilization with which
he now found himself faced. In obedience to those laws, Rodney
disappeared; Cassandra was dispatched to catch the eleven-thirty
on Monday morning; Denham was seen no more; so that only Katharine,
the lawful occupant of the upper rooms, remained, and Mr. Hilbery
thought himself competent to see that she did nothing further
to compromise herself. As he bade her good morning next day he
was aware that he knew nothing of what she was thinking, but,
as he reflected with some bitterness, even this was an advance
upon the ignorance of the previous mornings. He went to his study,
wrote, tore up, and wrote again a letter to his wife, asking her
to come back on account of domestic difficulties which he specified
at first, but in a later draft more discreetly left unspecified.
Even if she started the very moment that she got it, he reflected,
she would not be home till Tuesday night, and he counted lugubriously
the number of hours that he would have to spend in a position
of detestable authority alone with his daughter.</p>

<p>What was she doing now, he wondered, as he addressed the envelope
to his wife. He could not control the telephone. He could not
play the spy. She might be making any arrangements she chose.
Yet the thought did not disturb him so much as the strange, unpleasant,
illicit atmosphere of the whole scene with the young people the
night before. His sense of discomfort was almost physical.</p>

<p>Had he known it, Katharine was far enough withdrawn, both physically
and spiritually, from the telephone. She sat in her room with
the dictionaries spreading their wide leaves on the table before
her, and all the pages which they had concealed for so many years
arranged in a pile. She worked with the steady concentration that
is produced by the successful effort to think down some unwelcome
thought by means of another thought. Having absorbed the unwelcome
thought, her mind went on with additional vigor, derived from
the victory; on a sheet of paper lines of figures and symbols
frequently and firmly written down marked the different stages
of its progress. And yet it was broad daylight; there were sounds
of knocking and sweeping, which proved that living people were
at work on the other side of the door, and the door, which could
be thrown open in a second, was her only protection against the
world. But she had somehow risen to be mistress in her own kingdom,
assuming her sovereignty unconsciously.</p>

<p>Steps approached her unheard. It is true that they were steps
that lingered, divagated, and mounted with the deliberation natural
to one past sixty whose arms, moreover, are full of leaves and
blossoms; but they came on steadily, and soon a tap of laurel
boughs against the door arrested Katharine’s pencil as it touched
the page. She did not move, however, and sat blank-eyed as if
waiting for the interruption to cease. Instead, the door opened.
At first, she attached no meaning to the moving mass of green
which seemed to enter the room independently of any human agency.
Then she recognized parts of her mother’s face and person behind
the yellow flowers and soft velvet of the palm-buds.</p>

<p>"From Shakespeare’s tomb!" exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery, dropping the
entire mass upon the floor, with a gesture that seemed to indicate
an act of dedication. Then she flung her arms wide and embraced
her daughter.</p>

<p>"Thank God, Katharine!" she exclaimed. "Thank God!" she repeated.</p>

<p>"You’ve come back?" said Katharine, very vaguely, standing up
to receive the embrace.</p>

<p>Although she recognized her mother’s presence, she was very far
from taking part in the scene, and yet felt it to be amazingly
appropriate that her mother should be there, thanking God emphatically
for unknown blessings, and strewing the floor with flowers and
leaves from Shakespeare’s tomb.</p>

<p>"Nothing else matters in the world!" Mrs. Hilbery continued.
"Names aren’t everything; it’s what we feel that’s everything.
I didn’t want silly, kind, interfering letters. I didn’t want
your father to tell me. I knew it from the first. I prayed that
it might be so."</p>

<p>"You knew it?" Katharine repeated her mother’s words softly and
vaguely, looking past her. "How did you know it?" She began, like
a child, to finger a tassel hanging from her mother’s cloak.</p>

<p>"The first evening you told me, Katharine. Oh, and thousands
of times&mdash;dinner-parties&mdash;talking about books&mdash;the way he came
into the room&mdash;your voice when you spoke of him."</p>

<p>Katharine seemed to consider each of these proofs separately.
Then she said gravely:</p>

<p>"I’m not going to marry William. And then there’s Cassandra&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, there’s Cassandra," said Mrs. Hilbery. "I own I was a little
grudging at first, but, after all, she plays the piano so beautifully.
Do tell me, Katharine," she asked impulsively, "where did you
go that evening she played Mozart, and you thought I was asleep?"</p>

<p>Katharine recollected with difficulty.</p>

<p>"To Mary Datchet’s," she remembered.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mrs. Hilbery, with a slight note of disappointment
in her voice. "I had my little romance&mdash;my little speculation."
She looked at her daughter. Katharine faltered beneath that innocent
and penetrating gaze; she flushed, turned away, and then looked
up with very bright eyes.</p>

<p>"I’m not in love with Ralph Denham," she said.</p>

<p>"Don’t marry unless you’re in love!" said Mrs. Hilbery very quickly.
"But," she added, glancing momentarily at her daughter, "aren’t
there different ways, Katharine&mdash;different&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"We want to meet as often as we like, but to be free," Katharine
continued.</p>

<p>"To meet here, to meet in his house, to meet in the street."
Mrs. Hilbery ran over these phrases as if she were trying chords
that did not quite satisfy her ear. It was plain that she had
her sources of information, and, indeed, her bag was stuffed with
what she called "kind letters" from the pen of her sister-in-law.</p>

<p>"Yes. Or to stay away in the country," Katharine concluded.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hilbery paused, looked unhappy, and sought inspiration from
the window.</p>

<p>"What a comfort he was in that shop&mdash;how he took me and found
the ruins at once&mdash;how <em>SAFE I </em>felt with him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Safe? Oh, no, he’s fearfully rash&mdash;he’s always taking risks.
He wants to throw up his profession and live in a little cottage
and write books, though he hasn’t a penny of his own, and there
are any number of sisters and brothers dependent on him."</p>

<p>"Ah, he has a mother?" Mrs. Hilbery inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes. Rather a fine-looking old lady, with white hair." Katharine
began to describe her visit, and soon Mrs. Hilbery elicited the
facts that not only was the house of excruciating ugliness, which
Ralph bore without complaint, but that it was evident that every
one depended on him, and he had a room at the top of the house,
with a wonderful view over London, and a rook.</p>

<p>"A wretched old bird in a corner, with half its feathers out,"
she said, with a tenderness in her voice that seemed to commiserate
the sufferings of humanity while resting assured in the capacity
of Ralph Denham to alleviate them, so that Mrs. Hilbery could
not help exclaiming:</p>

<p>"But, Katharine, you <em>ARE </em>in love!" at which Katharine
flushed, looked startled, as if she had said something that she
ought not to have said, and shook her head.</p>

<p>Hastily Mrs. Hilbery asked for further details of this extraordinary
house, and interposed a few speculations about the meeting between
Keats and Coleridge in a lane, which tided over the discomfort
of the moment, and drew Katharine on to further descriptions and
indiscretions. In truth, she found an extraordinary pleasure in
being thus free to talk to some one who was equally wise and equally
benignant, the mother of her earliest childhood, whose silence
seemed to answer questions that were never asked. Mrs. Hilbery
listened without making any remark for a considerable time. She
seemed to draw her conclusions rather by looking at her daughter
than by listening to her, and, if cross-examined, she would probably
have given a highly inaccurate version of Ralph Denham’s life-history
except that he was penniless, fatherless, and lived at Highgate&mdash;all
of which was much in his favor. But by means of these furtive
glances she had assured herself that Katharine was in a state
which gave her, alternately, the most exquisite pleasure and the
most profound alarm.</p>

<p>She could not help ejaculating at last:</p>

<p>"It’s all done in five minutes at a Registry Office nowadays,
if you think the Church service a little florid&mdash;which it is,
though there are noble things in it."</p>

<p>"But we don’t want to be married," Katharine replied emphatically,
and added, "Why, after all, isn’t it perfectly possible to live
together without being married?"</p>

<p>Again Mrs. Hilbery looked discomposed, and, in her trouble, took
up the sheets which were lying upon the table, and began turning
them over this way and that, and muttering to herself as she glanced:</p>

<p>"A plus B minus C equals ‘x y z’. It’s so dreadfully ugly, Katharine.
That’s what I feel&mdash;so dreadfully ugly."</p>

<p>Katharine took the sheets from her mother’s hand and began shuffling
them absent-mindedly together, for her fixed gaze seemed to show
that her thoughts were intent upon some other matter.</p>

<p>"Well, I don’t know about ugliness," she said at length.</p>

<p>"But he doesn’t ask it of you?" Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed. "Not
that grave young man with the steady brown eyes?"</p>

<p>"He doesn’t ask anything&mdash;we neither of us ask anything."</p>

<p>"If I could help you, Katharine, by the memory of what I felt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, tell me what you felt."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hilbery, her eyes growing blank, peered down the enormously
long corridor of days at the far end of which the little figures
of herself and her husband appeared fantastically attired, clasping
hands upon a moonlit beach, with roses swinging in the dusk.</p>

<p>"We were in a little boat going out to a ship at night," she
began. "The sun had set and the moon was rising over our heads.
There were lovely silver lights upon the waves and three green
lights upon the steamer in the middle of the bay. Your father’s
head looked so grand against the mast. It was life, it was death.
The great sea was round us. It was the voyage for ever and ever."</p>

<p>The ancient fairy-tale fell roundly and harmoniously upon Katharine’s
ears. Yes, there was the enormous space of the sea; there were
the three green lights upon the steamer; the cloaked figures climbed
up on deck. And so, voyaging over the green and purple waters,
past the cliffs and the sandy lagoons and through pools crowded
with the masts of ships and the steeples of churches&mdash;here they
were. The river seemed to have brought them and deposited them
here at this precise point. She looked admiringly at her mother,
that ancient voyager.</p>

<p>"Who knows," exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery, continuing her reveries,
"where we are bound for, or why, or who has sent us, or what we
shall find&mdash;who knows anything, except that love is our faith&mdash;love&mdash;"
she crooned, and the soft sound beating through the dim words
was heard by her daughter as the breaking of waves solemnly in
order upon the vast shore that she gazed upon. She would have
been content for her mother to repeat that word almost indefinitely&mdash;a
soothing word when uttered by another, a riveting together of
the shattered fragments of the world. But Mrs. Hilbery, instead
of repeating the word love, said pleadingly:</p>

<p>"And you won’t think those ugly thoughts again, will you, Katharine?"
at which words the ship which Katharine had been considering seemed
to put into harbor and have done with its seafaring. Yet she was
in great need, if not exactly of sympathy, of some form of advice,
or, at least, of the opportunity of setting forth her problems
before a third person so as to renew them in her own eyes.</p>

<p>"But then," she said, ignoring the difficult problem of ugliness,
"you knew you were in love; but we’re different. It seems," she
continued, frowning a little as she tried to fix the difficult
feeling, "as if something came to an end suddenly&mdash;gave out&mdash;faded&mdash;an
illusion&mdash;as if when we think we’re in love we make it up&mdash;we
imagine what doesn’t exist. That’s why it’s impossible that we
should ever marry. Always to be finding the other an illusion,
and going off and forgetting about them, never to be certain that
you cared, or that he wasn’t caring for some one not you at all,
the horror of changing from one state to the other, being happy
one moment and miserable the next&mdash;that’s the reason why we can’t
possibly marry. At the same time," she continued, "we can’t live
without each other, because&mdash;" Mrs. Hilbery waited patiently for
the sentence to be completed, but Katharine fell silent and fingered
her sheet of figures.</p>

<p>"We have to have faith in our vision," Mrs. Hilbery resumed,
glancing at the figures, which distressed her vaguely, and had
some connection in her mind with the household accounts, "otherwise,
as you say&mdash;" She cast a lightning glance into the depths of disillusionment
which were, perhaps, not altogether unknown to her.</p>

<p>"Believe me, Katharine, it’s the same for every one&mdash;for me,
too&mdash;for your father," she said earnestly, and sighed. They looked
together into the abyss and, as the elder of the two, she recovered
herself first and asked:</p>

<p>"But where is Ralph? Why isn’t he here to see me?"</p>

<p>Katharine’s expression changed instantly.</p>

<p>"Because he’s not allowed to come here," she replied bitterly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hilbery brushed this aside.</p>

<p>"Would there be time to send for him before luncheon?" she asked.</p>

<p>Katharine looked at her as if, indeed, she were some magician.
Once more she felt that instead of being a grown woman, used to
advise and command, she was only a foot or two raised above the
long grass and the little flowers and entirely dependent upon
the figure of indefinite size whose head went up into the sky,
whose hand was in hers, for guidance.</p>

<p>"I’m not happy without him," she said simply.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hilbery nodded her head in a manner which indicated complete
understanding, and the immediate conception of certain plans for
the future. She swept up her flowers, breathed in their sweetness,
and, humming a little song about a miller’s daughter, left the
room.</p>

<p>The case upon which Ralph Denham was engaged that afternoon was
not apparently receiving his full attention, and yet the affairs
of the late John Leake of Dublin were sufficiently confused to
need all the care that a solicitor could bestow upon them, if
the widow Leake and the five Leake children of tender age were
to receive any pittance at all. But the appeal to Ralph’s humanity
had little chance of being heard to-day; he was no longer a model
of concentration. The partition so carefully erected between the
different sections of his life had been broken down, with the
result that though his eyes were fixed upon the last Will and
Testament, he saw through the page a certain drawing-room in Cheyne
Walk.</p>

<p>He tried every device that had proved effective in the past for
keeping up the partitions of the mind, until he could decently
go home; but a little to his alarm he found himself assailed so
persistently, as if from outside, by Katharine, that he launched
forth desperately into an imaginary interview with her. She obliterated
a bookcase full of law reports, and the corners and lines of the
room underwent a curious softening of outline like that which
sometimes makes a room unfamiliar at the moment of waking from
sleep. By degrees, a pulse or stress began to beat at regular
intervals in his mind, heaping his thoughts into waves to which
words fitted themselves, and without much consciousness of what
he was doing, he began to write on a sheet of draft paper what
had the appearance of a poem lacking several words in each line.
Not many lines had been set down, however, before he threw away
his pen as violently as if that were responsible for his misdeeds,
and tore the paper into many separate pieces. This was a sign
that Katharine had asserted herself and put to him a remark that
could not be met poetically. Her remark was entirely destructive
of poetry, since it was to the effect that poetry had nothing
whatever to do with her; all her friends spent their lives in
making up phrases, she said; all his feeling was an illusion,
and next moment, as if to taunt him with his impotence, she had
sunk into one of those dreamy states which took no account whatever
of his existence. Ralph was roused by his passionate attempts
to attract her attention to the fact that he was standing in the
middle of his little private room in Lincoln’s Inn Fields at a
considerable distance from Chelsea. The physical distance increased
his desperation. He began pacing in circles until the process
sickened him, and then took a sheet of paper for the composition
of a letter which, he vowed before he began it, should be sent
that same evening.</p>

<p>It was a difficult matter to put into words; poetry would have
done it better justice, but he must abstain from poetry. In an
infinite number of half-obliterated scratches he tried to convey
to her the possibility that although human beings are woefully
ill-adapted for communication, still, such communion is the best
we know; moreover, they make it possible for each to have access
to another world independent of personal affairs, a world of law,
of philosophy, or more strangely a world such as he had had a
glimpse of the other evening when together they seemed to be sharing
something, creating something, an ideal&mdash;a vision flung out in
advance of our actual circumstances. If this golden rim were quenched,
if life were no longer circled by an illusion (but was it an illusion
after all?), then it would be too dismal an affair to carry to
an end; so he wrote with a sudden spurt of conviction which made
clear way for a space and left at least one sentence standing
whole. Making every allowance for other desires, on the whole
this conclusion appeared to him to justify their relationship.
But the conclusion was mystical; it plunged him into thought.
The difficulty with which even this amount was written, the inadequacy
of the words, and the need of writing under them and over them
others which, after all, did no better, led him to leave off before
he was at all satisfied with his production, and unable to resist
the conviction that such rambling would never be fit for Katharine’s
eye. He felt himself more cut off from her than ever. In idleness,
and because he could do nothing further with words, he began to
draw little figures in the blank spaces, heads meant to resemble
her head, blots fringed with flames meant to represent&mdash;perhaps
the entire universe. From this occupation he was roused by the
message that a lady wished to speak to him. He had scarcely time
to run his hands through his hair in order to look as much like
a solicitor as possible, and to cram his papers into his pocket,
already overcome with shame that another eye should behold them,
when he realized that his preparations were needless. The lady
was Mrs. Hilbery.</p>

<p>"I hope you’re not disposing of somebody’s fortune in a hurry,"
she remarked, gazing at the documents on his table, "or cutting
off an entail at one blow, because I want to ask you to do me
a favor. And Anderson won’t keep his horse waiting. (Anderson
is a perfect tyrant, but he drove my dear father to the Abbey
the day they buried him.) I made bold to come to you, Mr. Denham,
not exactly in search of legal assistance (though I don’t know
who I’d rather come to, if I were in trouble), but in order to
ask your help in settling some tiresome little domestic affairs
that have arisen in my absence. I’ve been to Stratford-on-Avon
(I must tell you all about that one of these days), and there
I got a letter from my sister-in-law, a dear kind goose who likes
interfering with other people’s children because she’s got none
of her own. (We’re dreadfully afraid that she’s going to lose
the sight of one of her eyes, and I always feel that our physical
ailments are so apt to turn into mental ailments. I think Matthew
Arnold says something of the same kind about Lord Byron.) But
that’s neither here nor there."</p>

<p>The effect of these parentheses, whether they were introduced
for that purpose or represented a natural instinct on Mrs. Hilbery’s
part to embellish the bareness of her discourse, gave Ralph time
to perceive that she possessed all the facts of their situation
and was come, somehow, in the capacity of ambassador.</p>

<p>"I didn’t come here to talk about Lord Byron," Mrs. Hilbery continued,
with a little laugh, "though I know that both you and Katharine,
unlike other young people of your generation, still find him worth
reading."  She paused. "I’m so glad you’ve made Katharine read
poetry, Mr. Denham!"  she exclaimed, "and feel poetry, and look
poetry! She can’t talk it yet, but she will&mdash;oh, she will!"</p>

<p>Ralph, whose hand was grasped and whose tongue almost refused
to articulate, somehow contrived to say that there were moments
when he felt hopeless, utterly hopeless, though he gave no reason
for this statement on his part.</p>

<p>"But you care for her?" Mrs. Hilbery inquired.</p>

<p>"Good God!" he exclaimed, with a vehemence which admitted of
no question.</p>

<p>"It’s the Church of England service you both object to?" Mrs.
Hilbery inquired innocently.</p>

<p>"I don’t care a damn what service it is," Ralph replied.</p>

<p>"You would marry her in Westminster Abbey if the worst came to
the worst?" Mrs. Hilbery inquired.</p>

<p>"I would marry her in St. Paul’s Cathedral," Ralph replied. His
doubts upon this point, which were always roused by Katharine’s
presence, had vanished completely, and his strongest wish in the
world was to be with her immediately, since every second he was
away from her he imagined her slipping farther and farther from
him into one of those states of mind in which he was unrepresented.
He wished to dominate her, to possess her.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery. She thanked Him for a variety
of blessings: for the conviction with which the young man spoke;
and not least for the prospect that on her daughter’s wedding-day
the noble cadences, the stately periods, the ancient eloquence
of the marriage service would resound over the heads of a distinguished
congregation gathered together near the very spot where her father
lay quiescent with the other poets of England. The tears filled
her eyes; but she remembered simultaneously that her carriage
was waiting, and with dim eyes she walked to the door. Denham
followed her downstairs.</p>

<p>It was a strange drive. For Denham it was without exception the
most unpleasant he had ever taken. His only wish was to go as
straightly and quickly as possible to Cheyne Walk; but it soon
appeared that Mrs. Hilbery either ignored or thought fit to baffle
this desire by interposing various errands of her own. She stopped
the carriage at post-offices, and coffee-shops, and shops of inscrutable
dignity where the aged attendants had to be greeted as old friends;
and, catching sight of the dome of St. Paul’s above the irregular
spires of Ludgate Hill, she pulled the cord impulsively, and gave
directions that Anderson should drive them there. But Anderson
had reasons of his own for discouraging afternoon worship, and
kept his horse’s nose obstinately towards the west. After some
minutes, Mrs. Hilbery realized the situation, and accepted it
good-humoredly, apologizing to Ralph for his disappointment.</p>

<p>"Never mind," she said, "we’ll go to St. Paul’s another day,
and it may turn out, though I can’t promise that it <em>WILL,
</em>that he’ll take us past Westminster Abbey, which would be
even better."</p>

<p>Ralph was scarcely aware of what she went on to say. Her mind
and body both seemed to have floated into another region of quick-sailing
clouds rapidly passing across each other and enveloping everything
in a vaporous indistinctness. Meanwhile he remained conscious
of his own concentrated desire, his impotence to bring about anything
he wished, and his increasing agony of impatience.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mrs. Hilbery pulled the cord with such decision that
even Anderson had to listen to the order which she leant out of
the window to give him. The carriage pulled up abruptly in the
middle of Whitehall before a large building dedicated to one of
our Government offices. In a second Mrs. Hilbery was mounting
the steps, and Ralph was left in too acute an irritation by this
further delay even to speculate what errand took her now to the
Board of Education. He was about to jump from the carriage and
take a cab, when Mrs. Hilbery reappeared talking genially to a
figure who remained hidden behind her.</p>

<p>"There’s plenty of room for us all," she was saying. "Plenty
of room. We could find space for <em>FOUR </em>of you, William,"
she added, opening the door, and Ralph found that Rodney had now
joined their company. The two men glanced at each other. If distress,
shame, discomfort in its most acute form were ever visible upon
a human face, Ralph could read them all expressed beyond the eloquence
of words upon the face of his unfortunate companion. But Mrs.
Hilbery was either completely unseeing or determined to appear
so. She went on talking; she talked, it seemed to both the young
men, to some one outside, up in the air. She talked about Shakespeare,
she apostrophized the human race, she proclaimed the virtues of
divine poetry, she began to recite verses which broke down in
the middle. The great advantage of her discourse was that it was
self-supporting. It nourished itself until Cheyne Walk was reached
upon half a dozen grunts and murmurs.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, alighting briskly at her door, "here we are!"</p>

<p>There was something airy and ironical in her voice and expression
as she turned upon the doorstep and looked at them, which filled
both Rodney and Denham with the same misgivings at having trusted
their fortunes to such an ambassador; and Rodney actually hesitated
upon the threshold and murmured to Denham:</p>

<p>"You go in, Denham. <em>I..." </em>He was turning tail, but the
door opening and the familiar look of the house asserting its
charm, he bolted in on the wake of the others, and the door shut
upon his escape. Mrs. Hilbery led the way upstairs. She took them
to the drawing-room. The fire burnt as usual, the little tables
were laid with china and silver. There was nobody there.</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "Katharine’s not here. She must be upstairs in
her room. You have something to say to her, I know, Mr. Denham.
You can find your way?" she vaguely indicated the ceiling with
a gesture of her hand. She had become suddenly serious and composed,
mistress in her own house. The gesture with which she dismissed
him had a dignity that Ralph never forgot. She seemed to make
him free with a wave of her hand to all that she possessed. He
left the room.</p>

<p>The Hilberys’ house was tall, possessing many stories and passages
with closed doors, all, once he had passed the drawing-room floor,
unknown to Ralph. He mounted as high as he could and knocked at
the first door he came to.</p>

<p>"May I come in?" he asked.</p>

<p>A voice from within answered "Yes."</p>

<p>He was conscious of a large window, full of light, of a bare
table, and of a long looking-glass. Katharine had risen, and was
standing with some white papers in her hand, which slowly fluttered
to the ground as she saw her visitor. The explanation was a short
one. The sounds were inarticulate; no one could have understood
the meaning save themselves. As if the forces of the world were
all at work to tear them asunder they sat, clasping hands, near
enough to be taken even by the malicious eye of Time himself for
a united couple, an indivisible unit.</p>

<p>"Don’t move, don’t go," she begged of him, when he stooped to
gather the papers she had let fall. But he took them in his hands
and, giving her by a sudden impulse his own unfinished dissertation,
with its mystical conclusion, they read each other’s compositions
in silence.</p>

<p>Katharine read his sheets to an end; Ralph followed her figures
as far as his mathematics would let him. They came to the end
of their tasks at about the same moment, and sat for a time in
silence.</p>

<p>"Those were the papers you left on the seat at Kew," said Ralph
at length. "You folded them so quickly that I couldn’t see what
they were."</p>

<p>She blushed very deeply; but as she did not move or attempt to
hide her face she had the appearance of some one disarmed of all
defences, or Ralph likened her to a wild bird just settling with
wings trembling to fold themselves within reach of his hand. The
moment of exposure had been exquisitely painful&mdash;the light shed
startlingly vivid. She had now to get used to the fact that some
one shared her loneliness. The bewilderment was half shame and
half the prelude to profound rejoicing. Nor was she unconscious
that on the surface the whole thing must appear of the utmost
absurdity. She looked to see whether Ralph smiled, but found his
gaze fixed on her with such gravity that she turned to the belief
that she had committed no sacrilege but enriched herself, perhaps
immeasurably, perhaps eternally. She hardly dared steep herself
in the infinite bliss. But his glance seemed to ask for some assurance
upon another point of vital interest to him. It beseeched her
mutely to tell him whether what she had read upon his confused
sheet had any meaning or truth to her. She bent her head once
more to the papers she held.</p>

<p>"I like your little dot with the flames round it," she said meditatively.</p>

<p>Ralph nearly tore the page from her hand in shame and despair
when he saw her actually contemplating the idiotic symbol of his
most confused and emotional moments.</p>

<p>He was convinced that it could mean nothing to another, although
somehow to him it conveyed not only Katharine herself but all
those states of mind which had clustered round her since he first
saw her pouring out tea on a Sunday afternoon. It represented
by its circumference of smudges surrounding a central blot all
that encircling glow which for him surrounded, inexplicably, so
many of the objects of life, softening their sharp outline, so
that he could see certain streets, books, and situations wearing
a halo almost perceptible to the physical eye. Did she smile?
Did she put the paper down wearily, condemning it not only for
its inadequacy but for its falsity? Was she going to protest once
more that he only loved the vision of her? But it did not occur
to her that this diagram had anything to do with her. She said
simply, and in the same tone of reflection:</p>

<p>"Yes, the world looks something like that to me too."</p>

<p>He received her assurance with profound joy. Quietly and steadily
there rose up behind the whole aspect of life that soft edge of
fire which gave its red tint to the atmosphere and crowded the
scene with shadows so deep and dark that one could fancy pushing
farther into their density and still farther, exploring indefinitely.
Whether there was any correspondence between the two prospects
now opening before them they shared the same sense of the impending
future, vast, mysterious, infinitely stored with undeveloped shapes
which each would unwrap for the other to behold; but for the present
the prospect of the future was enough to fill them with silent
adoration. At any rate, their further attempts to communicate
articulately were interrupted by a knock on the door, and the
entrance of a maid who, with a due sense of mystery, announced
that a lady wished to see Miss Hilbery, but refused to allow her
name to be given.</p>

<p>When Katharine rose, with a profound sigh, to resume her duties,
Ralph went with her, and neither of them formulated any guess,
on their way downstairs, as to who this anonymous lady might prove
to be. Perhaps the fantastic notion that she was a little black
hunchback provided with a steel knife, which she would plunge
into Katharine’s heart, appeared to Ralph more probable than another,
and he pushed first into the dining-room to avert the blow. Then
he exclaimed "Cassandra!" with such heartiness at the sight of
Cassandra Otway standing by the dining-room table that she put
her finger to her lips and begged him to be quiet.</p>

<p>"Nobody must know I’m here," she explained in a sepulchral whisper.
"I missed my train. I have been wandering about London all day.
I can bear it no longer. Katharine, what am I to do?"</p>

<p>Katharine pushed forward a chair; Ralph hastily found wine and
poured it out for her. If not actually fainting, she was very
near it.</p>

<p>"William’s upstairs," said Ralph, as soon as she appeared to
be recovered. "I’ll go and ask him to come down to you." His own
happiness had given him a confidence that every one else was bound
to be happy too. But Cassandra had her uncle’s commands and anger
too vividly in her mind to dare any such defiance. She became
agitated and said that she must leave the house at once. She was
not in a condition to go, had they known where to send her. Katharine’s
common sense, which had been in abeyance for the past week or
two, still failed her, and she could only ask, "But where’s your
luggage?" in the vague belief that to take lodgings depended entirely
upon a sufficiency of luggage. Cassandra’s reply, "I’ve lost my
luggage," in no way helped her to a conclusion.</p>

<p>"You’ve lost your luggage," she repeated. Her eyes rested upon
Ralph, with an expression which seemed better fitted to accompany
a profound thanksgiving for his existence or some vow of eternal
devotion than a question about luggage. Cassandra perceived the
look, and saw that it was returned; her eyes filled with tears.
She faltered in what she was saying. She began bravely again to
discuss the question of lodging when Katharine, who seemed to
have communicated silently with Ralph, and obtained his permission,
took her ruby ring from her finger and giving it to Cassandra,
said: "I believe it will fit you without any alteration."</p>

<p>These words would not have been enough to convince Cassandra
of what she very much wished to believe had not Ralph taken the
bare hand in his and demanded:</p>

<p>"Why don’t you tell us you’re glad?" Cassandra was so glad that
the tears ran down her cheeks. The certainty of Katharine’s engagement
not only relieved her of a thousand vague fears and self-reproaches,
but entirely quenched that spirit of criticism which had lately
impaired her belief in Katharine. Her old faith came back to her.
She seemed to behold her with that curious intensity which she
had lost; as a being who walks just beyond our sphere, so that
life in their presence is a heightened process, illuminating not
only ourselves but a considerable stretch of the surrounding world.
Next moment she contrasted her own lot with theirs and gave back
the ring.</p>

<p>"I won’t take that unless William gives it me himself," she said.
"Keep it for me, Katharine."</p>

<p>"I assure you everything’s perfectly all right," said Ralph.
"Let me tell William&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was about, in spite of Cassandra’s protest, to reach the door,
when Mrs. Hilbery, either warned by the parlor-maid or conscious
with her usual prescience of the need for her intervention, opened
the door and smilingly surveyed them.</p>

<p>"My dear Cassandra!" she exclaimed. "How delightful to see you
back again! What a coincidence!" she observed, in a general way.
"William is upstairs. The kettle boils over. Where’s Katharine,
I say? I go to look, and I find Cassandra!" She seemed to have
proved something to her own satisfaction, although nobody felt
certain what thing precisely it was.</p>

<p>"I find Cassandra," she repeated.</p>

<p>"She missed her train," Katharine interposed, seeing that Cassandra
was unable to speak.</p>

<p>"Life," began Mrs. Hilbery, drawing inspiration from the portraits
on the wall apparently, "consists in missing trains and in finding&mdash;"
But she pulled herself up and remarked that the kettle must have
boiled completely over everything.</p>

<p>To Katharine’s agitated mind it appeared that this kettle was
an enormous kettle, capable of deluging the house in its incessant
showers of steam, the enraged representative of all those household
duties which she had neglected. She ran hastily up to the drawing-room,
and the rest followed her, for Mrs. Hilbery put her arm round
Cassandra and drew her upstairs. They found Rodney observing the
kettle with uneasiness but with such absence of mind that Katharine’s
catastrophe was in a fair way to be fulfilled. In putting the
matter straight no greetings were exchanged, but Rodney and Cassandra
chose seats as far apart as possible, and sat down with an air
of people making a very temporary lodgment. Either Mrs. Hilbery
was impervious to their discomfort, or chose to ignore it, or
thought it high time that the subject was changed, for she did
nothing but talk about Shakespeare’s tomb.</p>

<p>"So much earth and so much water and that sublime spirit brooding
over it all," she mused, and went on to sing her strange, half-earthly
song of dawns and sunsets, of great poets, and the unchanged spirit
of noble loving which they had taught, so that nothing changes,
and one age is linked with another, and no one dies, and we all
meet in spirit, until she appeared oblivious of any one in the
room. But suddenly her remarks seemed to contract the enormously
wide circle in which they were soaring and to alight, airily and
temporarily, upon matters of more immediate moment.</p>

<p>"Katharine and Ralph," she said, as if to try the sound. "William
and Cassandra."</p>

<p>"I feel myself in an entirely false position," said William desperately,
thrusting himself into this breach in her reflections. "I’ve no
right to be sitting here. Mr. Hilbery told me yesterday to leave
the house. I’d no intention of coming back again. I shall now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I feel the same too," Cassandra interrupted. "After what Uncle
Trevor said to me last night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have put you into a most odious position," Rodney went on,
rising from his seat, in which movement he was imitated simultaneously
by Cassandra. "Until I have your father’s consent I have no right
to speak to you&mdash;let alone in this house, where my conduct"&mdash;he
looked at Katharine, stammered, and fell silent&mdash;"where my conduct
has been reprehensible and inexcusable in the extreme," he forced
himself to continue. "I have explained everything to your mother.
She is so generous as to try and make me believe that I have done
no harm&mdash;you have convinced her that my behavior, selfish and
weak as it was&mdash;selfish and weak&mdash;" he repeated, like a speaker
who has lost his notes.</p>

<p>Two emotions seemed to be struggling in Katharine; one the desire
to laugh at the ridiculous spectacle of William making her a formal
speech across the tea-table, the other a desire to weep at the
sight of something childlike and honest in him which touched her
inexpressibly. To every one’s surprise she rose, stretched out
her hand, and said:</p>

<p>"You’ve nothing to reproach yourself with&mdash;you’ve been always&mdash;"
but here her voice died away, and the tears forced themselves
into her eyes, and ran down her cheeks, while William, equally
moved, seized her hand and pressed it to his lips. No one perceived
that the drawing-room door had opened itself sufficiently to admit
at least half the person of Mr. Hilbery, or saw him gaze at the
scene round the tea-table with an expression of the utmost disgust
and expostulation. He withdrew unseen. He paused outside on the
landing trying to recover his self-control and to decide what
course he might with most dignity pursue. It was obvious to him
that his wife had entirely confused the meaning of his instructions.
She had plunged them all into the most odious confusion. He waited
a moment, and then, with much preliminary rattling of the handle,
opened the door a second time. They had all regained their places;
some incident of an absurd nature had now set them laughing and
looking under the table, so that his entrance passed momentarily
unperceived. Katharine, with flushed cheeks, raised her head and
said:</p>

<p>"Well, that’s my last attempt at the dramatic."</p>

<p>"It’s astonishing what a distance they roll," said Ralph, stooping
to turn up the corner of the hearthrug.</p>

<p>"Don’t trouble&mdash;don’t bother. We shall find it&mdash;" Mrs. Hilbery
began, and then saw her husband and exclaimed: "Oh, Trevor, we’re
looking for Cassandra’s engagement-ring!"</p>

<p>Mr. Hilbery looked instinctively at the carpet. Remarkably enough,
the ring had rolled to the very point where he stood. He saw the
rubies touching the tip of his boot. Such is the force of habit
that he could not refrain from stooping, with an absurd little
thrill of pleasure at being the one to find what others were looking
for, and, picking the ring up, he presented it, with a bow that
was courtly in the extreme, to Cassandra. Whether the making of
a bow released automatically feelings of complaisance and urbanity,
Mr. Hilbery found his resentment completely washed away during
the second in which he bent and straightened himself. Cassandra
dared to offer her cheek and received his embrace. He nodded with
some degree of stiffness to Rodney and Denham, who had both risen
upon seeing him, and now altogether sat down. Mrs. Hilbery seemed
to have been waiting for the entrance of her husband, and for
this precise moment in order to put to him a question which, from
the ardor with which she announced it, had evidently been pressing
for utterance for some time past.</p>

<p>"Oh, Trevor, please tell me, what was the date of the first performance
of ‘Hamlet’?"</p>

<p>In order to answer her Mr. Hilbery had to have recourse to the
exact scholarship of William Rodney, and before he had given his
excellent authorities for believing as he believed, Rodney felt
himself admitted once more to the society of the civilized and
sanctioned by the authority of no less a person than Shakespeare
himself. The power of literature, which had temporarily deserted
Mr. Hilbery, now came back to him, pouring over the raw ugliness
of human affairs its soothing balm, and providing a form into
which such passions as he had felt so painfully the night before
could be molded so that they fell roundly from the tongue in shapely
phrases, hurting nobody. He was sufficiently sure of his command
of language at length to look at Katharine and again at Denham.
All this talk about Shakespeare had acted as a soporific, or rather
as an incantation upon Katharine. She leaned back in her chair
at the head of the tea-table, perfectly silent, looking vaguely
past them all, receiving the most generalized ideas of human heads
against pictures, against yellow-tinted walls, against curtains
of deep crimson velvet. Denham, to whom he turned next, shared
her immobility under his gaze. But beneath his restraint and calm
it was possible to detect a resolution, a will, set now with unalterable
tenacity, which made such turns of speech as Mr. Hilbery had at
command appear oddly irrelevant. At any rate, he said nothing.
He respected the young man; he was a very able young man; he was
likely to get his own way. He could, he thought, looking at his
still and very dignified head, understand Katharine’s preference,
and, as he thought this, he was surprised by a pang of acute jealousy.
She might have married Rodney without causing him a twinge. This
man she loved. Or what was the state of affairs between them?
An extraordinary confusion of emotion was beginning to get the
better of him, when Mrs. Hilbery, who had been conscious of a
sudden pause in the conversation, and had looked wistfully at
her daughter once or twice, remarked:</p>

<p>"Don’t stay if you want to go, Katharine. There’s the little
room over there. Perhaps you and Ralph&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We’re engaged," said Katharine, waking with a start, and looking
straight at her father. He was taken aback by the directness of
the statement; he exclaimed as if an unexpected blow had struck
him. Had he loved her to see her swept away by this torrent, to
have her taken from him by this uncontrollable force, to stand
by helpless, ignored? Oh, how he loved her! How he loved her!
He nodded very curtly to Denham.</p>

<p>"I gathered something of the kind last night," he said. "I hope
you’ll deserve her." But he never looked at his daughter, and
strode out of the room, leaving in the minds of the women a sense,
half of awe, half of amusement, at the extravagant, inconsiderate,
uncivilized male, outraged somehow and gone bellowing to his lair
with a roar which still sometimes reverberates in the most polished
of drawing-rooms. Then Katharine, looking at the shut door, looked
down again, to hide her tears.</p>
