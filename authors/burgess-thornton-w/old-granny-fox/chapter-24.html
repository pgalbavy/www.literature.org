By those who win 't is well agreed<br/>
He'll try and try who would succeed.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Old Granny Fox.

<p>It seemed to Reddy Fox as if time never had dragged so slowly
as it did this particular night while he and Granny Fox waited
until Granny thought it safe to visit Farmer Brown's henhouse
and see if by any chance there was a way of getting into it. Reddy
tried not to hope too much. Granny had found a way to get the
gate to the henyard left open, but this would do them no good
unless there was some way of getting into the house, and this
he very much doubted. But if there was a way he wanted to know
it, and he was impatient to start.</p>

<p>But Granny was in no hurry. Not that she wasn't just as hungry
for a fat hen as was Reddy, but she was too wise and clever and
altogether too sly to run any risks.</p>

<p>"There is nothing gained by being in too much of a hurry, Reddy,"
said she, "and often a great deal is lost in that way. A fat hen
will taste just as good a little later as it would now, and it
will be foolish to go up to Farmer Brown's until we are sure that
everybody up there is asleep. But to ease your mind, I'll tell
you what we will do; we'll go where we can see Farmer Brown's
house and watch until the last light winks out."</p>

<p>So they trotted to a point where they could see Farmer Brown's
house, and there they sat down to watch. It seemed to Reddy that
those lights never would wink out. But at last they did.</p>

<p>"Come on, Granny!" he cried, jumping to his feet.</p>

<p>"Not yet, Reddy. Not yet," replied Granny. "We've got to give
folks time to get sound asleep. If we should get into that henhouse,
those hens might make a racket, and if anything like that is going
to happen, we want to be sure that Farmer Brown and Farmer Brown's
boy are asleep."</p>

<p>This was sound advice, and Reddy knew it. So with a groan he
once more threw himself down on the snow to wait. At last Granny
arose, stretched, and looked up at the twinkling stars. "Come
on," said she and led the way.</p>

<p>Up back of the barn and around it they stole like two shadows
and quite as noiselessly as shadows. They heard Bowser the Hound
sighing in his sleep in his snug little house, and grinned at
each other. Silently they stole over to the henyard. The gate
was open, just as Granny had told Reddy it would be. Across the
henyard they trotted swiftly, straight to where more than once
in the daytime they had seen the hens come out of the house through
a little hole. It was closed. Reddy had expected it would be.
Still, he was dreadfully disappointed. He gave it merely a glance.</p>

<p>"I knew it wouldn't be any use," said he with a half whine.</p>

<p>But Granny paid no attention to him. She went close to the hole
and pushed gently against the little door that closed it. It didn't
move. Then she noticed that at one edge there was a tiny crack.
She tried to push her nose through, but the crack was too narrow.
Then she tried a paw. A claw caught on the edge of the door, and
it moved ever so little. Then Granny knew that the little door
wasn't fastened. Granny stretched herself flat on the ground and
went to work, first with one paw, then with the other. By and
by she caught her claws in it just right again, and it moved a
wee bit more. No, most certainly that door wasn't fastened, and
that crack was a little wider.</p>

<p>"What are you wasting your time there for?" demanded Reddy crossly.
"We'd better be off hunting if we would have anything to eat this
night."</p>

<p>Granny said nothing but kept on working. She had discovered that
this was a sliding door. Presently the crack was wide enough for
her to get her nose in. Then she pushed and twisted her head this
way and that. The little door slowly slid back, and when Reddy
turned to speak to her again, for he had had his back to her,
she was nowhere to be seen. Reddy just gaped and gaped foolishly.
There was no Granny Fox, but there was a black hole where she
had been working, and from it came the most delicious smell,&mdash;the
smell of fat hens! It seemed to Reddy that his stomach fairly
flopped over with longing. He rubbed his eyes to be sure that
he was awake. Then in a twinkling he was inside that hole himself.</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h, be still!" whispered Old Granny Fox.</p>
