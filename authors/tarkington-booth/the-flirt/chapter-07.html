<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Toward four o'clock that afternoon, a very thin, fair young man
shakily heaved himself into a hammock under the trees in that
broad backyard wherein, as Valentine Corliss had yesterday noticed,
the last iron monarch of the herd, with unabated arrogance, had
entered domestic service as a clothes-prop. The young man, who
was of delicate appearance and unhumanly pale, stretched himself
at full length on his back, closed his eyes, moaned feebly, cursed
the heat in a stricken whisper. Then, as a locust directly overhead
violently shattered the silence, and seemed like to continue the
outrage forever, the shaken lounger stopped his ears with his
fingers and addressed the insect in old Saxon.</p>

<p>A white jacketed mulatto came from the house bearing something
on a silver tray.</p>

<p>"Julip, Mist' Vilas?" he said sympathetically.</p>

<p>Ray Vilas rustily manoeuvred into a sitting position; and, with
eyes still closed, made shift to accept the julep in both hands,
drained half of it, opened his eyes, and thanked the cup-bearer
feebly, in a voice and accent reminiscent of the melodious South.</p>

<p>"And I wonder," he added, "if you can tell me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I'm Miz William Lindley's house-man, Joe Vaxdens," said the
mulatto, in the tone of an indulgent nurse. "You in Miz Lindley's
backyard right now, sittin' in a hammick."</p>

<p>"I seem to gather almost that much for myself," returned the
patient. "But I should like to know how I got here."</p>

<p>"Jes' come out the front door an' walk' aroun' the house an'
set down. Mist' Richard had to go downtown; tole me not to wake
you; but I heerd you splashin' in the bath an' you tole me you
din' want no breakfuss&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Joe, I'm aware of what's occurred since I woke," said Vilas,
and, throwing away the straws, finished the julep at one draught.
"What I want to know is how I happened to be here at Mr. Lindley's."</p>

<p>"Mist' Richard brought you las' night, suh. I don' know where
he got you, but I heered a considerable thrashum aroun', up an'
down the house, an' so I come help him git you to bed in one vem
spare-rooms." Joe chuckled ingratiatingly. "Lord name! You cert'n'y
wasn't askin' fer no <em>bed</em>!"</p>

<p>He took the glass, and the young man reclined again in the hammock,
a hot blush vanquishing his pallor. "Was <em>I&mdash;</em>was I very
bad, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you was all <em>right</em>," Joe hastened to reassure him.
"You was jes' on'y a little bit tight."</p>

<p>"Did it really seem only a little?" the other asked hopefully.</p>

<p>"Yessuh," said Joe promptly. "Nothin' at all. You jes' wanted
to rare roun' little bit. Mist' Richard took gun away from you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I tole him you wasn' goin' use it!" Joe laughed. "But you
so wile be din' know what you do. You cert'n'y was drunkes' man
<em>I</em> see in <em>long</em> while," he said admiringly. "You
pert near had us bofe wore out 'fore you give up, an' Mist' Richard
an' me, we <em>use'</em> to han'lin' drunkum man, too&mdash;use' to
have big times week-in, week-out 'ith Mist' Will&mdash;at's Mist' Richard's
brother, you know, suh, what died o' whiskey." He laughed again
in high good-humour. "You cert'n'y laid it all over any vem ole
times we had 'ith Mist' Will!"</p>

<p>Mr. Vilas shifted his position in the hammock uneasily; Joe's
honest intentions to be of cheer to the sufferer were not wholly
successful.</p>

<p>"I tole Mist' Richard," the kindly servitor continued, "it was
a mighty good thing his ma gone up Norf endurin' the hot spell.
Sence Mist' Will die she can't hardly bear to see drunkum man
aroun' the house. Mist' Richard hardly ever tech nothin' himself
no more. You goin' feel better, suh, out in the f'esh air," he
concluded, comfortingly as he moved away.</p>

<p>"Joe!"</p>

<p>"Yessuh."</p>

<p>Mr. Vilas pulled himself upright for a moment. "What use in the
world do you reckon one julep is to me?"</p>

<p>"Mist' Richard say to give you one drink ef you ask' for it,
suh," answered Joe, looking troubled.</p>

<p>"Well, you've told me enough now about last night to make any
man hang himself, and I'm beginning to remember enough more&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Pshaw, Mist' Vilas," the coloured man interrupted, deprecatingly,
"you din' broke nothin'! You on'y had couple glass' wine too much.
You din' make no trouble at all; jes' went right off to bed. You
ought seen some vem ole times me an Mist' Richard use to have
'ith Mist' Will&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Joe!"</p>

<p>"Yessuh."</p>

<p>"I want three more juleps and I want them right away."</p>

<p>The troubled expression upon the coloured man's face deepened.
"Mist' Richard say jes' one, suh," he said reluctantly. "I'm afraid&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Joe."</p>

<p>"Yessuh."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Ray Vilas slowly, "whether or not you ever
heard that I was born and raised in Kentucky."</p>

<p>"Yessuh," returned Joe humbly. "I heerd so."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the young man in a quiet voice, "you go and
get me three juleps. I'll settle it with Mr. Richard."</p>

<p>"Yessuh."</p>

<p>But it was with a fifth of these renovators that Lindley found
his guest occupied, an hour later, while upon a small table nearby
a sixth, untouched, awaited disposal beside an emptied coffee-cup.
Also, Mr. Vilas was smoking a cigarette with unshadowed pleasure;
his eye was bright, his expression care-free; and he was sitting
up in the hammock, swinging cheerfully, and singing the "Marseillaise."
Richard approached through the yard, coming from the street without
entering the house; and anxiety was manifest in the glance he
threw at the green-topped glass upon the table, and in his greeting.</p>

<p>"Hail, gloom!" returned Mr. Vilas, cordially, and, observing
the anxious glance, he swiftly removed the untouched goblet from
the table to his own immediate possession. "Two simultaneous juleps
will enhance the higher welfare," he explained airily. "Sir, your
Mr. Varden was induced to place a somewhat larger order with us
than he protested to be your intention. Trusting you to exonerate
him from all so-and-so and that these few words, etcetera!" He
depleted the elder glass of its liquor, waved it in the air, cried,
"Health, host!" and set it upon the table. "I believe I do not
err in assuming my cup-bearer's name to be Varden, although he
himself, in his simple Americo-Africanism, is pleased to pluralize
it. Do I fret you, host?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," said Richard, dropping upon a rustic bench,
and beginning to fan himself with his straw hat. "What's the use
of fretting about a boy who hasn't sense enough to fret about
himself?"</p>

<p>"`Boy?'" Mr. Vilas affected puzzlement. "Do I hear aright? Sir,
do you boy me? Bethink you, I am now the shell of five mint-juleps
plus, and am pot-valiant. And is this mere capacity itself to
be lightly <em>boyed</em>? Again, do I not wear a man's garment,
a man's garnitures? Heed your answer; for this serge, these flannels,
and these silks are yours, and though I may not fill them to the
utmost, I do to the longmost, precisely. I am the stature of a
man; had it not been for your razor I should wear the beard of
a man; therefore I'll not be boyed. What have you to say in defence?"</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better let me get Joe to bring you something to eat?"
asked Richard.</p>

<p>"Eat?" Mr. Vilas disposed of the suggestion with mournful hauteur.
"There! For the once I forgive you. Let the subject never be mentioned
between us again. We will tactfully turn to a topic of interest.
My memories of last evening, at first hazy and somewhat disconcerting,
now merely amuse me. Following the pleasant Spanish custom, I
went a-serenading, but was kidnapped from beneath the precious
casement by&mdash;by a zealous arrival. Host, `zealous arrival' is
not the julep in action: it is a triumph of paraphrase."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd let Joe take you back to bed," said Richard.</p>

<p>"Always bent on thoughts of the flesh," observed the other sadly.
"Beds are for bodies, and I am become a thing of spirit. My soul
is grateful a little for your care of its casing. You behold,
I am generous: I am able to thank my successor to Carmen!"</p>

<p>Lindley's back stiffened. "Vilas!"</p>

<p>"Spare me your protests." The younger man waved his hand languidly.
"You wish not to confer upon this subject&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It's a subject we'll omit," said Richard.</p>

<p>His companion stopped swinging, allowed the hammock to come to
rest; his air of badinage fell from him; for the moment he seemed
entirely sober; and he spoke with gentleness. "Mr. Lindley, if
you please, I am still a gentleman&mdash;at times."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Richard quickly.</p>

<p>"No need of that!" The speaker's former careless and boisterous
manner instantly resumed possession. "You must permit me to speak
of a wholly fictitious lady, a creature of my wanton fancy, sir,
whom I call Carmen. It will enable me to relieve my burdened soul
of some remarks I have long wished to address to your excellent
self."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," muttered Richard, much annoyed.</p>

<p>"Let us imagine," continued Mr. Vilas, beginning to swing again,
"that I thought I had won this Carmen&#11834;"</p>

<p>Lindley uttered an exclamation, shifted his position in his chair,
and fixed a bored attention upon the passing vehicles in the glimpse
of the street afforded between the house and the shrubberies along
the side fence. The other, without appearing to note his annoyance,
went on, cheerfully:</p>

<p>"She was a precocious huntress: early in youth she passed through
the accumulator stage, leaving it to the crude or village belle
to rejoice in numbers and the excitement of teasing cubs in the
bear-pit. It is the nature of this imagined Carmen to play fiercely
with one imitation of love after another: a man thinks he wins
her, but it is merely that she has chosen him&mdash;for a while. And
Carmen can have what she chooses; if the man exists who could
show her that she cannot, she would follow him through the devil's
dance; but neither you nor I would be that man, my dear sir. We
assume that Carmen's eyes have been mine&mdash;her heart is another
matter&mdash;and that she has grown weary of my somewhat Sicilian manner
of looking into them, and, following her nature and the law of
periodicity which Carmens must bow to, she seeks a cooler gaze
and calls Mr. Richard Lindley to come and take a turn at looking.
Now, Mr. Richard Lindley is straight as a die: he will not even
show that he hears the call until he is sure that I have been
dismissed: therefore, I have no quarrel with him. Also, I cannot
even hate him, for in my clearer julep vision I see that he is
but an interregnum. Let me not offend my friend: chagrin is to
be his as it is mine. I was a strong draught, he but the quieting
potion our Carmen took to settle it. We shall be brothers in woe
some day. Nothing in the universe lasts except Hell: Life is running
water; Love, a looking-glass; Death, an empty theatre! That reminds
me: as you are not listening I will sing."</p>

<p>He finished his drink and lifted his voice hilariously:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"The heavenly stars far above her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind of the infinite sea,<br/>
Who know all her perfidy, love her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So why call it madness in me?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, why call it madness&#11834;"

</p>
</div>
<p>He set his glass with a crash upon the table, staring over his
companion's shoulder.</p>

<p>"<em>What</em>, if you please, is the royal exile who thus seeks
refuge in our hermitage?"</p>

<p>His host had already observed the approaching visitor with some
surprise, and none too graciously. It was Valentine Corliss: he
had turned in from the street and was crossing the lawn to join
the two young men. Lindley rose, and, greeting him with sufficient
cordiality, introduced Mr. Vilas, who bestowed upon the newcomer
a very lively interest.</p>

<p>"You are as welcome, Mr. Corliss," said this previous guest,
earnestly, "as if these sylvan shades were mine. I hail you, not
only for your own sake, but because your presence encourages a
hope that our host may offer refreshment to the entire company."</p>

<p>Corliss smilingly declined to be a party to this diplomacy, and
seated himself beside Richard Lindley on the bench.</p>

<p>"Then I relapse!" exclaimed Mr. Vilas, throwing himself back
full-length in the hammock. "I am not replete, but content. I
shall meditate. Gentlemen, speak on!"</p>

<p>He waved his hand in a gracious gesture, indicating his intention
to remain silent, and lay quiet, his eyes fixed steadfastly upon
Corliss.</p>

<p>"I was coming to call on you," said the latter to Lindley, "but
I saw you from the street and thought you mightn't mind my being
as informal as I used to be, so many years ago."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Richard.</p>

<p>"I have a sinister purpose in coming," Mr. Corliss laughingly
went on. "I want to bore you a little first, and then make your
fortune. No doubt that's an old story to you, but I happen to
be one of the adventurers whose argosies are laden with real cargoes.
Nobody knows who has or hasn't money to invest nowadays, and of
course I've no means of knowing whether <em>you</em> have or not&mdash;you
see what a direct chap I am&mdash;but if you have, or can lay hold
of some, I can show you how to make it bring you an immense deal
more."</p>

<p>"Naturally," said Richard pleasantly, "I shall be glad if you
can do that."</p>

<p>"Then I'll come to the point. It is exceedingly simple; that's
certainly one attractive thing about it." Corliss took some papers
and unmounted photographs from his pocket, and began to spread
them open on the bench between himself and Richard. "No doubt
you know Southern Italy as well as I do."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't `know' it. I've been to Naples; down to Paestum;
drove from Salerno to Sorrentoby Amalfi; but that was years ago."</p>

<p>"Here's a large scale map that will refresh your memory." He
unfolded it and laid it across their knees; it was frayed with
wear along the folds, and had been heavily marked and dotted with
red and blue pencillings. "My millions are in this large irregular
section," he continued. "It's the anklebone and instep of Italy's
boot; this sizable province called Basilicata, east of Salerno,
north of Calabria. And I'll not hang fire on the point, Lindley.
What I've got there is oil."</p>

<p>"Olives?" asked Richard, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Hardly!" Corliss laughed. "Though of course one doesn't connect
petroleum with the thought of Italy, and of all Italy, Southern
Italy. But in spite of the years I've lived there, I've discovered
myself to be so essentially American and commercial that I want
to drench the surface of that antique soil with the brown, bad-smelling
crude oil that lies so deep beneath it. Basilicata is the coming
great oil-field of the world&mdash;and that's my secret. I dare to
tell it here, as I shouldn't dare in Naples."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't `dare'?" Richard repeated, with growing interest,
and no doubt having some vague expectation of a tale of the Camorra.
To him Naples had always seemed of all cities the most elusive
and incomprehensible, a laughing, thieving, begging, mandolin-playing,
music-and-murder haunted metropolis, about which anything was
plausible; and this impression was not unique, as no inconsiderable
proportion of Mr. Lindley's fellow-countrymen share it, a fact
thoroughly comprehended by the returned native.</p>

<p>"It isn't a case of not daring on account of any bodily danger,"
explained Corliss.</p>

<p>"No," Richard smiled reminiscently. "I don't believe that would
have much weight with you if it were. You certainly showed no
symptoms of that sort in your extreme youth. I remember you had
the name of being about the most daring and foolhardy boy in town."</p>

<p>"I grew up to be cautious enough in business, though," said the
other, shaking his head gravely. "I haven't been able to afford
not being careful." He adjusted the map&mdash;a prefatory gesture.
"Now, I'll make this whole affair perfectly clear to you. It's
a simple matter, as are most big things. I'll begin by telling
you of Moliterno&mdash;he's been my most intimate friend in that part
of the continent for a great many years; since I went there as
a boy, in fact."</p>

<p>He sketched a portrait of his friend, Prince Moliterno, bachelor
chief of a historic house, the soul of honour, "land-poor"; owning
leagues and leagues of land, hills and mountains, broken towers
and ruins, in central Basilicata, a province described as wild
country and rough, off the rails and not easy to reach. Moliterno
and the narrator had gone there to shoot; Corliss had seen "surface
oil" upon the streams and pools; he recalled the discovery of
oil near his own boyhood home in America; had talked of it to
Moliterno, and both men had become more and more interested, then
excited. They decided to sink a well.</p>

<p>Corliss described picturesquely the difficulties of this enterprise,
the hardships and disappointments; how they dragged the big tools
over the mountains by mule power; how they had kept it all secret;
how he and Moliterno had done everything with the help of peasant
labourers and one experienced man, who had "seen service in the
Persian oil-fields."</p>

<p>He gave the business reality, colouring it with details relevant
and irrelevant, anecdotes and wayside incidents: he was fluent,
elaborate, explicit throughout. They sank five wells, he said,
"at the angles of this irregular pentagon you see here on the
map, outlined in blue. These red circles are the wells." Four
of the wells "came in tremendous," but they had managed to get
them sealed after wasting&mdash;he was "sorry to think how many thousand
barrels of oil." The fifth well was so enormous that they had
not been able to seal it at the time of the speaker's departure
for America.</p>

<p>"But I had a cablegram this morning," he added, "letting me know
they've managed to do it at last. Here is, the cablegram." He
handed Richard a form signed "Antonio Moliterno."</p>

<p>"Now, to go back to what I said about not `daring' to speak of
this in Naples," he continued, smiling. "The fear is financial,
not physical."</p>

<p>The knowledge of the lucky strike, he explained, must be kept
from the "Neapolitan money-sharks." A third of the land so rich
in oil already belonged to the Moliterno estates, but it was necessary
to obtain possession of the other two thirds "before the secret
leaks into Naples." So far, it was safe, the peasants of Basilicata
being "as medieval a lot as one could wish." He related that these
peasants thought that the devils hiding inside the mountains had
been stabbed by the drills, and that the oil was devils' blood.</p>

<p>"You can see some of the country people hanging about, staring
at a well, in this kodak, though it's not a very good one." He
put into Richard's hand a small, blurred photograph showing a
spouting well with an indistinct crowd standing in an irregular
semicircle before it.</p>

<p>"Is this the Basilicatan peasant costume?" asked Richard, indicating
a figure in the foreground, the only one revealed at all definitely.
"It looks more oriental. Isn't the man wearing a fez?"</p>

<p>"Let me see," responded Mr. Corliss very quickly. "Perhaps I
gave you the wrong picture. Oh, no," he laughed easily, holding
the kodak closer to his eyes; "that's all right: it is a fez.
That's old Salviati, our engineer, the man I spoke of who'd worked
in Persia, you know; he's always worn a fez since then. Got in
the habit of it out there and says he'll never give it up. Moliterno's
always chaffing him about it. He's a faithful old chap, Salviati."</p>

<p>"I see." Lindley looked thoughtfully at the picture, which the
other carelessly returned to his hand. "There seems to be a lot
of oil there."</p>

<p>"It's one of the smaller wells at that. And you can see from
the kodak that it's just `blowing'&mdash;not an eruption from being
`shot,' or the people wouldn't stand so near. Yes; there's an
ocean of oil under that whole province; but we want a lot of money
to get at it. It's mountain country; our wells will all have to
go over fifteen-hundred feet, and that's expensive. We want to
pipe the oil to Salerno, where the Standard's ships will take
it from us, and it will need a great deal for that. But most of
all we want money to get hold of the land; we must control the
whole field, and it's big!"</p>

<p>"How did you happen to come here to finance it?"</p>

<p>"I was getting to that. Moliterno himself is as honourable a
man as breathes God's air. But my experience has been that Neapolitan
capitalists are about the cleverest and slipperiest financiers
in the world. We could have financed it twenty times over in Naples
in a day, but neither Moliterno nor I was willing to trust them.
The thing is enormous, you see&mdash;a really colossal fortune&mdash;and
Italian law is full of ins and outs, and the first man we talked
to confidentially would have given us his word to play straight,
and, the instant we left him, would have flown post-haste for
Basilicata and grabbed for himself the two thirds of the field
not yet in our hands. Moliterno and I talked it over many, many
times; we thought of going to Rome for the money, to Paris, to
London, to New York; but I happened to remember the old house
here that my aunt had left me &mdash;I wanted to sell it, to add
whatever it brought to the money I've already put in&mdash;and then
it struck me I might raise the rest here as well as anywhere else."</p>

<p>The other nodded. "I understand."</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll think me rather sentimental," Corliss went
on, with a laugh which unexpectedly betrayed a little shyness.
"I've never forgotten that I was born here&mdash;was a boy here. In
all my wanderings I've always really thought of this as home."</p>

<p>His voice trembled slightly and his face flushed; he smiled deprecatingly
as though in apology for these symptoms of emotion; and at that
both listeners felt (perhaps with surprise) the man's strong attraction.
There was something very engaging about him: in the frankness
of his look and in the slight tremor in his voice; there was something
appealing and yet manly in the confession, by this thoroughgoing
cosmopolite, of his real feeling for the home-town.</p>

<p>"Of course I know how very few people, even among the `old citizens,'
would have any recollection whatever of me," he went on; "but
that doesn't make any difference in my sentiment for the place
and its people. That street out yonder was named for my grandfather:
there's a statue of my great uncle in the State House yard; all
my own blood: belonged here, and though I have been a wanderer
and may not be remembered&mdash;naturally am <em>not</em> remembered&mdash;yet
the name is honoured here, and I &mdash;<em>I&#11834;" </em>He faltered
again, then concluded with quiet earnestness: "I thought that
if my good luck was destined to bring fortunes to others, it might
as well be to my own kind&mdash;that at least I'd offer them the chance
before I offered it to any one else." He turned and looked Richard
in the face. "That's why I'm here, Mr. Lindley."</p>

<p>The other impulsively put out his hand. "I understand," he said
heartily.</p>

<p>"Thank you." Corliss changed his tone for one less serious. "You've
listened very patiently and I hope you'll be rewarded for it.
Certainly you will if you decide to come in with us. May I leave
the maps and descriptions with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. I'll look them over carefully and have another
talk with you about it."</p>

<p>"Thank heaven, <em>that's</em> over!" exclaimed the lounger in
the hammock, who had not once removed his fascinated stare from
the expressive face of Valentine Corliss. "If you have now concluded
with dull care, allow me to put a vital question: Mr. Corliss,
do you sing?"</p>

<p>The gentleman addressed favoured him with a quizzical glance
from between half-closed lids, and probably checking an impulse
to remark that he happened to know that his questioner sometimes
sang, replied merely, "No."</p>

<p>"It is a pity."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," returned the other, inconsequently. "It just struck
me that you ought to sing the Toreador song."</p>

<p>Richard Lindley, placing the notes and maps in his pocket, dropped
them, and, stooping, began to gather the scattered papers with
a very red face. Corliss, however, laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"That's most flattering," he said; "though there are other things
in `Carmen' I prefer&mdash;probably because one doesn't hear them so
eternally."</p>

<p>Vilas pulled himself up to a sitting position and began to swing
again. "Observe our host, Mr. Corliss," he commanded gayly. "He
is a kind old Dobbin, much beloved, but cares damn little to hear
you or me speak of music. He'd even rather discuss your oil business
than listen to us talk of women, whereas nothing except women
ever really interests <em>you</em>, my dear sir. He's not our
kind of man," he concluded, mournfully; "not at all our kind of
man!"</p>

<p>"I hope," Corliss suggested, "he's going to be my kind of man
in the development of these oil-fields."</p>

<p>"How ridic" &mdash;Mr. Vilas triumphed over the word after a
slight struggle&mdash;"ulous! I shall review that: ridiculous of you
to pretend to be interested in oil-fields. You are not that sort
of person whatever. Nothing could be clearer than that you would
never waste the time demanded by fields of oil. Groundlings call
this `the mechanical age'&mdash;a vulgar error. My dear sir, you and
I know that it is the age of Woman! Even poets have begun to see
that she is alive. Formerly we did not speak of her at all, but
of late years she has become such a scandal that she is getting
talked about. Even our dramas, which used to be all blood, have
become all flesh. I wish I were dead&mdash;but will continue my harangue
because the thought is pellucid. Women selecting men to mate with
are of only two kinds, just as there are but two kinds of children
in a toy-shop. One child sets its fancy on one partic"&mdash;the orator
paused, then continued&mdash;"on one certain toy and will make a distressing
scene if she doesn't get it: she will have that one; she will
go straight to it, clasp it and keep it; she won't have any other.
The other kind of woman is to be understood if you will make the
experiment of taking the other kind of child to a toy-shop and
telling her you will buy her any toy in the place, but that you
will buy her only one. If you do this in the morning, she will
still be in the shop when it is closing for the night, because,
though she runs to each toy in turn with excitement and delight,
she sees another over her shoulder, and the one she has not touched
is always her choice&mdash;until she has touched it! Some get broken
in the handling. For my part, my wires are working rather rustily,
but I must obey the Stage-Manager. For my requiem I wish somebody
would ask them to play Gounod's masterpiece."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Corliss, amused.</p>

<p>"`The Funeral March of a Marionette!'"</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean that for a cheerful way of announcing that
you are a fatalist."</p>

<p>"Fatalism? That is only a word," declared Mr. Vilas gravely.
"If I am not a puppet then I am a god. Somehow, I do not seem
to be a god. If a god is a god, one thinks he would know it himself.
I now yield the floor. Thanking you cordially, I believe there
is a lady walking yonder who commands salutation."</p>

<p>He rose to his feet, bowing profoundly. Cora Madison was passing,
strolling rather briskly down the street, not in the direction
of her home. She waved her parasol with careless gayety to the
trio under the trees, and, going on, was lost to their sight.</p>

<p>"Hello!" exclaimed Corliss, looking at his watch with a start
of surprise. "I have two letters to write for the evening mail.
I must be off."</p>

<p>At this, Ray Vilas's eyes&mdash;still fixed upon him, as they had
been throughout the visit&mdash;opened to their fullest capacity, in
a gaze of only partially alcoholic wildness.</p>

<p>Entirely aware of this singular glare, but not in the least disconcerted
by it, the recipient proffered his easy farewells. "I had no idea
it was so late. Good afternoon. Mr. Vilas, I have been delighted
with your diagnosis. Lindley, I'm at your disposal when you've
looked over my data. My very warm thanks for your patience, and&mdash;addio!"</p>

<p>Lindley looked after him as he strode quickly away across the
green lawn, turning, at the street, in the direction Cora had
taken; and the troubled Richard felt his heart sink with vague
but miserable apprehension. There was a gasp of desperation beside
him, and the sound of Ray Vilas's lips parting and closing with
little noises of pain.</p>

<p>"So he knows her," said the boy, his thin body shaking. "Look
at him, damn him! See his deep chest, that conqueror's walk, the
easy, confident, male pride of him: a true-born, natural rake&mdash;the
Toreador all over!"</p>

<p>His agitation passed suddenly; he broke into a loud laugh, and
flung a reckless hand to his companion's shoulder.</p>

<p>"You good old fool," he cried. "<em>You'll</em> never play Don
Jose!"</p>
