<p>The <em>Deerfoot</em> glided through the smooth waters, and while
the afternoon was still young rounded to at the wharf, below the
long wooden bridge which spans the stream at Wiscasset, and made
fast where a score of other boats of all sizes and models were
moored. Several large vessels were anchored farther out and Captain
Alvin Landon had to slow down to thread his way among them. There
was plenty of room, and the launch was tied up opposite a small
excursion steamer which was to start southward an hour later.
A tip to the old man who was looking after a number of yachts
assured the safety of the last arrival from molestation.</p>

<p>The possibility that the <em>Water Witch</em> had preceded them
to Wiscasset caused a scrutiny of the various craft in sight by
the Captain and his crew, including Detective Calvert, but nothing
was seen of the boat.</p>

<p>"She is miles off down stream," was the remark of the officer,
"and for the present is out of the running."</p>

<p>The four walked up the easy slope to the main street, along which
they passed to the leading hotel for dinner. They were a little
late and when they went into the spacious dining room found a
table by themselves. The only other occupant was a tall, angular
man of about the same age as Calvert, similarly attired and apparently
giving his sole attention to the meal before him. He nodded to
the group in a neighborly way, but did not speak.</p>

<p>When the four took their places at the small table, Calvert faced
this person a short distance away; Chester Haynes sat with his
back to him, thus confronting the detective, while Mike and Alvin
occupied the respective ends of the board. These details sound
trifling, but they had a meaning. Calvert thus distributed his
companions apparently off-hand, but the seating of himself as
mentioned was done with a purpose. Chester then, from the position
he occupied, was the only one of the other three who observed
anything significant in that action and in what followed.</p>

<p>In the first place, the officer raised his glass of water, and
while slowly drinking looked over the top at the lone guest. Chester
noticed that he sipped the fluid longer than common, gazed at
the stranger and deliberately winked one eye. What response the
other made of course could not be seen by Chester.</p>

<p>"The two are acquaintances," was the conclusion of the lad, "and
they don't wish anyone else to know it."</p>

<p>He was curious to know whether Alvin and Mike had noticed anything
of the by-play. The Irish lad for the time devoted himself to
satisfying his vigorous hunger and cared for naught else. The
same was to be said of the Captain. Chester remained on the alert.</p>

<p>Several trifling incidents that occurred during the meal, which
was enlivened by the wit of the Irish lad, confirmed Chester in
his first suspicion. Calvert tried to divert possible suspicion
by cheery remarks and pleasant conversation as the meal proceeded.</p>

<p>"I am sure, Mike, you never had any such feasts in the old country."</p>

<p>Having said this, the detective coughed several times and held
his napkin to his mouth, but Chester knew the outburst was forced,
and was meant to carry to the other man, who rather curiously
coughed the same number of times immediately afterward.</p>

<p>"A message and its reply," was the thought of Chester, "but I
have no idea of what they mean. Mr. Calvert doesn't wish me to
see anything and I won't let him know I do."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mike made his response to the inquiring remark of
Calvert:</p>

<p>"Ye're right, me frind, as Hank McCarthy said whin dining on
one pratie and a bit of black bread, calling to mind his former
feasting in his own home. Which reminds me, Mr. Calvert, to ask,
did ye iver see the heart of an Irishman?"</p>

<p>"I'm not quite sure I grasp your meaning, Mike," was the reply,
while Alvin and Chester looked up.</p>

<p>"I can bist explain by a dimonstration, as the tacher said whin
I asked him what was meant by the chastisement of a school lad.
Now, give heed, all of ye, and I'll show ye what I meant by the
sinsible inquiry."</p>

<p>Among the different articles of food on the table was a dish
of "murphy" potatoes with their "jackets" on. That is, they had
not been mashed or peeled, though a strip was shaved off of each
end. They were mealy and white, and Mike had already placed several
where they were sure to do the most good. The tubers in boiling
had swollen so much that most of the skins had popped open in
spots from the richness within.</p>

<p>Mike reached over and carefully selected a big murphy, which
he held with the thumb of his left hand and fingers circling about
it. The upper end projected slightly above the thumb and forefinger,
as if peeping out to watch proceedings. The three stopped eating
for the moment and watched the youth. While doing this, Chester
glanced for an instant at the face of the officer, and saw him
look quickly across the room and telegraph another wink.</p>

<p>Like a professional magician, Mike was very deliberate in order
to be more impressive. The true artist does not overlook the minutest
point, and he daintily adjusted the potato, shifting it about
until it was poised exactly right. Then he slowly raised his open
right hand, with the palm downward, until it was above his head.
Like a flash he brought it down upon the upper end of the tuber,
which shot through the loose encircling grasp as if fired from
an air gun. The skin remained, but the potato itself whisked down
upon the table with such force that it popped open, and lo!</p>

<p>"There's the heart of an Irishman &mdash;Begoora! but I'm mistook!"
exclaimed Mike in dismay, for when the tuber burst open the interior
was black with decay!</p>

<p>Calvert threw back his head and roared, and Alvin and Chester
came near falling from their chairs. Even the man at the other
table joined in the boisterous merriment, which was increased
by the comical expression of Mike. With open mouth and staring
eyes he sat dumfounded. For once in his life he was caught so
fairly that he was speechless.</p>

<p>The deft little trick he had performed many times, but never
before had he been victimized by what seemed to be a rich, mealy
potato. He couldn't understand it.</p>

<p>Oddly enough the stranger was the first to recover his speech.
He must have had little liking for Hibernians, since he called:</p>

<p>"You're right, young man! You showed us the heart of a real Irishman!"</p>

<p>With lower jaw still drooping, Mike turned his head and stared
at the speaker. He yearned to crush him with a suitable reply,
but all his wit had been knocked out of him by the cruel blow
of fate. However, it could not long remain so. He picked up the
fragments of the potato, fumbled them reprovingly and gravely
laid them on the tablecloth beside his plate. Then the old grin
bisected his homely face, and addressing the three, he said:</p>

<p>"I made a slight mistake, as Jerry Sullivan said whin he stepped
out of the third story windy thinking it was the top of the stairs.
If it's all the same to yees, we'll now give our attintion to
disposing of the remaining stuff on the boord."</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, the four cut in two each of the potatoes left
in the dish. Every one was as sound as a dollar, whereat all laughed
again, Mike as heartily as any.</p>

<p>"It'll be a sorry day whin I can't take a joke, as Jim Doolin
said smiling whin his frinds pushed his cabin over on top of him
as he lay sleeping behind it, but I was niver sarved such a trick
before."</p>

<p>Chester thought the unanimous merriment caused by Mike's mishap
would open an acquaintance between the lone guest and the others,
but nothing more was said by the respective parties, nor did the
watchfulness of the youth detect any further signals while at
the table. Evidently an understanding had been brought about,
and nothing else was required.</p>

<p>The meal finished, the four rose to leave the dining room. While
there may have been nothing meant by Calvert's action in dropping
to the rear, Chester was alert and glanced back as they walked
into the hall outside. He was rewarded by seeing the officer turn
his head for an instant and give a slight nod. No doubt it was
meant for the guest left behind, whose response was invisible
to all except him for whom it was intended. The individual must
have been blessed with a good appetite, or he followed the sensible
policy of lingering long over his meals, since he began eating
before the little party and continued after their departure.</p>

<p>Reaching the pleasant, shady avenue, the four strolled through
the town and when tired came back to the hotel and sat down. Chester
was on the lookout for the stranger, but nothing was seen of him.
What did it all mean and what was the cause of the secrecy between
him and Stockham Calvert?</p>

<p>"If he chooses to explain I must wait until he is ready," was
the decision of Chester.</p>

<p>The afternoon was well forward, when they walked down the slope
to the wharf, where the <em>Deerfoot</em> awaited them. Alvin
made a hasty inspection of it and found everything seemingly all
right. As they were about to step aboard, the officer said:</p>

<p>"I shall have to bid you good-by for awhile."</p>

<p>"Why is that?" asked the Captain, in surprise.</p>

<p>"You remember I told you it was likely, but I hope soon to meet
you all again."</p>

<p>Nothing could be said by way of objection, and he stood on the
wharf as Alvin seated himself after adjusting the plug and swinging
over the fly-wheel. The boat circled out into the broad stream,
and all waved their hands to the officer, who responded similarly.
Then he turned about and went slowly up the slope, probably to
the hotel where they had dined.</p>

<p>When everything was moving easily, and the boat was gliding down
stream, Chester sitting directly beside his chum told him all
that he had observed in the dining room. Mike had gone to the
stern of the launch and sat down in his favorite position, with
his feet curled up under him.</p>
