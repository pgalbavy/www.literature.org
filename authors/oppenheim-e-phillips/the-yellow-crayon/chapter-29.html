<P>
You spoke, my dear Lucille," the  Duchess of Dorset said, "of your
departure.  Is not that a little premature?"
<P>
Lucille shrugged her beautiful shoulders, and leaned back in her
corner of the couch with half-closed eyes.  The Duchess, who was
very Anglo-Saxon, was an easy person to read, and Lucille was
anxious to know her fate.
<P>
"Why premature?" she asked.  "I was sent for to use my influence
with Reginald Brott.  Well, I did my best, and I believe that for
days it was just a chance whether I did not succeed.  However, as
it happened, I failed.  One of his friends came and pulled him away
just as he was wavering.  He has declared himself now once and for
all.  After his speech at Glasgow he cannot draw back.  I was brought
all the way from America, and I want to go back to my husband."
<P>
The Duchess pursed her lips.
<P>
"When one has the honour, my dear," she said, "of belonging to so
wonderful an organisation as this we must not consider too closely
the selfish claims of family.  I am sure that years ago I should
have laughed at any one who had told me that I, Georgina Croxton,
should ever belong to such a thing as a secret society, even though
it had some connection with so harmless and excellent an
organisation as the Primrose League."
<P>
"It does seem remarkable," Lucille murmured.
<P>
"But look what terrible times have come upon us," the Duchess
continued, without heeding the interruption.  "When I was a girl a
Radical was a person absolutely without consideration.  Now all our
great cities are hot-beds of Socialism and - and anarchism.  The
whole country seems banded together against the aristocracy and the
landowners.  Combination amongst us became absolutely necessary in
some shape or form.  When the Prince came and began to drop hints
about the way the spread of Socialism had been checked in Hungary
and Austria, and even Germany, I was interested from the first.
And when he went further, and spoke of the Society, it was I who
persuaded Dorset to join.  Dear man, he is very earnest, but very
slow, and very averse to anything at all secretive.  I am sure the
reflection that he is a member of a secret society, even although
it is simply a linking together of the aristocracy of Europe in
their own defence, has kept him awake for many a night."
<P>
Lucille was a little bored.
<P>
"The Society," she said, "is an admirable one enough, but just now
I am beginning to feel it a little exacting.  I think that the
Prince expects a good deal of one.  I shall certainly ask for my
release to-night."
<P>
The Duchess looked doubtful.
<P>
"Release!" she repeated.  "Come, is that not rather an exaggerated
expression?  I trust that your stay at Dorset House has not in any
way suggested an imprisonment."
<P>
"On the contrary," Lucille answered; "you and the Duke have been
most kind.  But you must remember that I have home of my own - and
a husband of my own."
<P>
"I have no doubt," the Duchess said, "that you will be able to
return to them some day.  But you must not be impatient.  I do not
think that the Prince has given up all hopes of Reginald Brott yet."
<P>
Lucille was silent.  So her emancipation was to be postponed.  After
all, it was what she had feared.  She sat watching idly the Duchess's
knitting needles.  Lady Carey came sweeping in, wonderful in a black
velvet gown and a display of jewels almost barbaric.
<P>
"On my way to the opera," she announced.  "The Maddersons sent me
their box.  Will any of you good people come?  What do you say,
Lucille?"
<P>
Lucille shook her head.
<P>
"My toilette is deficient," she said;, "and besides, I am staying
at home to see the Prince.  We expect him this evening."
<P>
"You'll probably be disappointed then," Lady Carey remarked, "for
he's going to join us at the opera.  Run and change your gown.
I'll wait."
<P>
"Are you sure that the Prince will be there?" Lucille asked.
<P>
"Certain."
<P>
"Then I will come," she said, "if the Duchess will excuse me."
<P>
The Duchess and Lady Carey were left alone for a few minutes.  The
former put down her knitting.
<P>
"Why do we keep that woman here," she asked, "now that Brott has
broken away from her altogether?"
<P>
Lady Carey laughed meaningly.
<P>
"Better ask the Prince," she remarked.
<P>
The Duchess frowned.
<P>
"My dear Muriel," she said, "I think that you are wrong to make such insinuations.  I am sure that
the Prince is too much devoted to our
cause to allow any personal considerations to intervene."
<P>
Lady Carey yawned.
<P>
"Rats!" she exclaimed.
<P>
The Duchess took up her knitting, and went on with it without remark.
Lady Carey burst out laughing.
<P>
"Don't look so shocked," she exclaimed.  "It's funny.  I can't help
being a bit slangy.  You do take everything so seriously.  Of course
you can see that the Prince is waiting to make a fool of himself
over Lucille.  He has been trying more or less all his life."
<P>
"He may admire her," the Duchess said.  "I am sure that he would
not allow that to influence him in his present position.  By the
bye, she is anxious to leave us now that the Brott affair is over.
Do you think that the Prince will agree?"
<P>
Lady Carey's face hardened.
<P>
"I am sure that he will not," she said coolly.  "There are reasons
why she may not at present be allowed to rejoin her husband."
<P>
The Duchess used her needles briskly.
<P>
"For my part," she said, "I can see no object in keeping her here
any longer.  Mr. Brott has shown himself quite capable of keeping
her at arm's length.  I cannot see what further use she is."
<P>
Lady Carey heard the flutter of skirts outside and rose.
<P>
"There are wheels within wheels," she remarked.  "My dear Lucille,
what a charming toilette.  We shall have the lady journalists
besieging us in our box.  Paquin, of course.  Good-night, Duchess.
Glad to see you're getting on with the socks, or stockings, do you
call them?"
<P>
Insolent aristocratic, now and then attractive in some strange
suggestive way, Lady Carey sat in front of the box and exchanged
greetings with her friends.  Presently the Prince came in and took
the chair between the two women.  Lady Carey greeted him with a nod.
<P>
"Here's Lucille dying to return to her lawful husband," she remarked.
"Odd thing, isn't it?  Most of the married women I ever knew are
dying to get away from theirs.  You can make her happy or miserable
in a few moments."
<P>
The Prince leaned over between them, but he looked only at Lucille.
<P>
"I wish that I could," he murmured.  "I wish that that were within
my power."
<P>
"It is," she answered coolly.  "Muriel is quite right.  I am most
anxious to return to my husband."
<P>
The Prince said nothing.  Lady Carey, glancing towards him at that
moment, was surprised at certain signs of disquietude in his face
which startled her.
<P>
"What is the matter with you?" she asked almost roughly.
<P>
"Matter with me?  Nothing," he answered.  "Why this unaccustomed
solicitude?"
<P>
Lady Carey looked into his face fiercely.  He was pale, and there
was a strained look about his eyes.  He seemed, too, to be listening.
&gt;From outside in the street came faintly to their ears the cry of a
newsboy.
<P>
"Get me an evening paper," she whispered in his ear.
<P>
He got up and left the box.  Lucille was watching the people below
and had not appreciated the significance of what had been passing
between the two.  Lady Carey leaned back in the box with half-closed
eyes.  Her fingers were clenched nervously together, her bosom was
rising and falling quickly.  If he had dared to defy her!  What was
it the newsboys were calling?  What a jargon!  Why did not Saxe
Leinitzer return?  Perhaps-he was afraid!  Her heart stood still
for a moment, and a little half-stifled cry broke from her lips.
Lucille looked around quickly.
<P>
"What is the matter, Muriel?" she asked.  "Are you faint?"
<P>
"Faint, no," Lady Carey answered roughly.  "I'm quite well.  Don't
take any notice of me.  Do you hear?  Don't look at me."
<P>
Lucille obeyed.  Lady Carey sat quite still with her hand pressed
to her side.  It was a stifling pain.  She was sure that she had
heard at last.  "Sudden death of a visitor at the Carlton Hotel."
The place was beginning to go round.
<P>
Saxe Leinitzer returned.  His face to her seemed positively ghastly.
He carried an evening paper in his hand.  She snatched it away from
him.  It was there before her in bold, black letters:
<P>
"Sudden death in the Carlton Hotel."
<P>
Her eyes, dim a moment ago, suddenly blazed fire upon him.
<P>
"It shall be a life for a life," she whispered.  "If you have killed
him you shall die."
<P>
Lucille looked at them bewildered.  And just then came a sharp tap
at the box door.  No one answered it, but the door was softly opened.
Mr. Sabin stood upon the threshold.
<P>
"Pray, don't let me disturb you," he said.  "I was unable to refrain
from paying you a brief visit.  Why, Prince, Lady Carey!  I can
assure you that I am no ghost."
<P>
He glanced from one to the other with a delicate smile of mockery
parting his thin lips.  For upon the Prince's forehead the
perspiration stood out like beads, and he shrank away from Mr.
Sabin as from some unholy thing.  Lady Carey had fallen back across
her chair.  Her hand was still pressed to her side, and her face
was very pale.  A nervous little laugh broke from her lips.
