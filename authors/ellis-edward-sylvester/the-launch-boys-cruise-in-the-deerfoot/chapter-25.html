<p>You will remember that Captain Alvin Landon and Second Mate Chester
Haynes were disappointed, as in the nature of things was inevitable,
in their search for the stolen motor boat <em>Deerfoot</em>, in
the cove or small inlet at the lower end of Barter Island. The
only glimpse they caught of a person on the launch, which bore
a marked resemblance to their own, was when they first sighted
the boat launch. Nothing was seen or heard of him afterward.</p>

<p>With the stealthy care used in the approach, Alvin backwatered
until the <em>Water Witch</em> had faded from view in the darkness.
Then he headed toward the southern shore, landing as nearly as
he could at the spot where they first entered the small boat.</p>

<p>It would have been an advantage had they taken an opposite course,
thereby shortening the distance they would have to walk, but they
wished to keep all knowledge of what they had done from the man
in gray, and therefore returned the borrowed boat to its former
place. They agreed that it was not best to spend the night in
the woods as they had thought of doing. They might penetrate to
a depth that would make it safe to kindle a fire, but they were
without extra garments, and now that all necessity of staying
in the neighborhood had passed, they were anxious to get away
from it as soon as possible. The stolen launch must be sought
for elsewhere, and they were concerned for the safety of Mike
Murphy, whose impulsive aggressiveness was almost certain to lead
him into trouble by this time.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the two once more tramped around the head of the
inlet, and with better fortune than might have been expected,
struck the beginning of the highway on which stood the humble
home of Uncle Ben Trotwood. The hour was so late that they were
sure the couple had gone to bed long before, but were pleased
to catch a twinkle of light from the front window, beside which
the old man was so fond of sitting.</p>

<p>The knock of Alvin was promptly answered by the thunderous "Come
in!" and the two stepped across the threshold.</p>

<p>"You hardly expected us back so soon," said Alvin, after the
salutation, "but it was a choice of spending the night out doors
or sleeping under your roof."</p>

<p>Uncle Ben was seated in his rocking chair, slowly puffing his
pipe. Peggy his wife had finished her sewing and was making ready
to go upstairs.</p>

<p>"Young chaps, you're welcome. I jedge you've been disapp'inted."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Alvin, who thereupon told his story.</p>

<p>"Our motor boat is somewhere else; I don't see how anyone can
go far with it, and we're sure of getting on its track to-morrow.
At any rate we sha'n't rest till we have it back."</p>

<p>"That little boat you've been telling me about b'longs to my
son Jim. If I had thought I'd told you of it, for I can see it
would have sarved you well. But it's a qu'ar story you tell me.
Who is that man you speak of as was dressed in gray?"</p>

<p>"He's one of the post office robbers, of course," was the confident
reply of Chester.</p>

<p>"I don't understand some of the things he's done," remarked Uncle
Ben.</p>

<p>"It looks as if he has been keeping tabs on us."</p>

<p>Uncle Ben seemed to fall into a brown study or he was debating
some question with himself. He was gazing at the cheap picture
on the opposite wall, but saw it no more than he did the other
three persons in the room. His wife knew his moods and studied
the wrinkled countenance, as did Alvin and Chester. Finally she
ended the stillness by sharply asking:</p>

<p>"Why don't you speak, Benjamin? I know what's in your mind."</p>

<p>He pulled himself abruptly together.</p>

<p>"If you know, what's the use of my telling?"</p>

<p>"That these young gentlemen may larn, though your thoughts ain't
wuth much."</p>

<p>He took a whiff or two, removed the pipe and with a whimsical
grin remarked:</p>

<p>"I was just thinking &mdash;Oh pshaw! what's the use?"</p>

<p>He shook his head and refused to explain further. It may seem
a small matter hardly worth the telling, but it would have been
well had he made his explanation. The alert brain of the octogenarian
had glimpsed something of which the youths had not as yet caught
the faintest glimmer.</p>

<p>"Do you know what I think?" he asked, bending his kindly eyes
upon his callers.</p>

<p>"We are waiting to learn," was Alvin's quick reply.</p>

<p>"It's time we all went to bed; Peggy will show you your room
and I'll foller as soon as I finish this and a couple of pipes
more. Off with you!"</p>

<p>The old lady lighted the candle from another that was burning
in an old-fashioned candlestick on the mantel and nodded to them
to follow her. At the head of the short stairs she pushed open
a door leading into a small room, furnished with a bed, a rag
carpet, and everything the pink of neatness. Stepping within she
set the light on the small stand, and then with an odd smile on
her worn countenance said almost in a whisper:</p>

<p>"I found what you put under your plates, but didn't let <em>him</em>
know about it; he would have made me give back the money to you,
and I know you didn't want me to do that."</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Chester a little taken back, as was also
his companion; "that was meant for you and we wish you to keep
it."</p>

<p>"That's what I thought. Ben is cranky. To-morrow morning at breakfast,
you must be careful he doesn't catch you when you do it again.
Good night and pleasant dreams."</p>

<p>The boys looked in each other's faces, and laughed after closing
the door.</p>

<p>"Uncle Ben's wife is more thrifty than he," said Alvin; "but
I am glad she kept the money, for she deserves it."</p>

<p>"And we mustn't forget that pointed hint she let fall. But, Alvin,
my supply of funds is running low. You will have to help me out
if we stay here for a week."</p>

<p>"I have enough to see us through, but I don't believe there will
be much more expense on our trip home."</p>

<p>A few minutes later they snuggled down in the soft bed and slept
as sweetly as a couple of infants.</p>

<p>It need not be said that neither forgot to slip a tip under his
plate at the breakfast table and made sure that Uncle Ben did
not observe the act. It may have been because Peggy was expecting
it that she saw it and smiled. Alvin and Chester could feel only
pleasure over the little by-play, for nothing could surpass her
kindness and hospitality to them.</p>

<p>"Wal," was the cheery remark of Uncle Ben, as he lighted his
pipe the moment the morning meal was over, "I 'spose you'll be
back in time for supper."</p>

<p>"Hardly, though we should be mighty glad to come."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, but you know you're as welcome as the birds in spring."</p>

<p>"We know that and we cannot thank you too much. I wish you would
allow us to pay you something for all you have done."</p>

<p>"None of that!" warned Uncle Ben, with a peremptory wave of his
hand. "We don't keep a hotel, and wish more folks would come and
oftener."</p>

<p>The lads had decided upon retracing the course of the day before.
That was to walk back to Sawyer Island and there take the first
steamer south, keeping the same keen lookout on the way for the
<em>Deerfoot</em>, but making no halt unless they actually caught
sight of the motor boat.</p>

<p>The jaunt from Barter to Sawyer Island was play for two rugged
youths, accustomed to athletics and brisk exercise, and was made
in a little more than an hour. The day promised to be warm and
sunshiny, but would not be oppressive, and they felt no fatigue
when they reached the well-known landing. Upon inquiry they were
told that the <em>Island Belle</em> on its way to Boothbay Harbor
would not arrive until nearly two hours, and for that period they
must content themselves as best they could.</p>

<p>"Why not send a telegram to Mr. Richards?" asked Chester. "He
knows what we are trying to do, and, like the good fellow he is,
will help us all he can. He may have picked up something worth
telling."</p>

<p>"Mike would say, if he were here, the suggestion is a good one,
as some of his relatives remarked when they were invited to take
a hand in a shindy. I'll do it."</p>

<p>Stepping into the little post office, which reminded them of
the one at Charmount and its bright young miss, Alvin sent a brief
inquiry to K. H. Richards, Boothbay Harbor:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Please let me know whether you have learned anything of the<br/>
<em>Deerfoot</em>. I shall be here for not quite two hours.

</p>
<p>
"<em>ALVIN LANDON</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>"More than likely Mr. Richards isn't at home; he is continually
on the go and may be in Portland or Augusta," said Chester.</p>

<p>"I think the message will catch him; I remember the bank of which
he is president holds a regular meeting of directors to-day and
he rarely misses any of them."</p>

<p>Barely half an hour had elapsed, when the young man who was the
operator called to the youths as they strolled into the room:</p>

<p>"Here's your answer."</p>

<p>Alvin took the yellow slip. Chester stood at his elbow and read
the message over his shoulder.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Your boat has been found.

</p>
<p>
"K. H. <em>RICHARDS</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>"Gee!" exclaimed the delighted Alvin; "isn't that fine? I didn't
count on such good luck as that."</p>

<p>"But why didn't he give some particulars? He could have sent
several words more without extra cost. Not a thing about Mike.
We have enough time to learn something. Try it again."</p>

<p>In a twinkling, a second message flashed over the wire. Mr. Richards
was begged to telegraph at Alvin's expense, giving fuller information,
and especially whether Mike Murphy had had anything to do with
the recovery of the motor boat.</p>
