<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>There was a sharp grue of ice in the air, as Mr. Nicholas Lovel
climbed the rickety wooden stairs to his lodgings in Chancery
Lane hard by Lincoln's Inn. That morning he had ridden in from
his manor in the Chilterns, and still wore his heavy horseman's
cloak and the long boots splashed with the mud of the Colne fords.
He had been busy all day with legal matters&mdash;conveyances on which
his opinion was sought, for, though it was the Christmas vacation,
his fame among the City merchants kept him busy in term and out
of it. Rarely, he thought, had he known London in so strange a
temper. Men scarcely dared to speak above their breath of public
things, and eyed him fearfully&mdash;even the attorneys who licked
his boots&mdash;as if a careless word spoken in his presence might
be their ruin. For it was known that this careful lawyer stood
very near Cromwell, had indeed been his comrade at bed and board
from Marston to Dunbar, and, though no Commons man, had more weight
than any ten in Parliament. Mr. Lovel could not but be conscious
of the tension among his acquaintances, and had he missed to note
it there he would have found it in the streets. Pride's troopers
were everywhere, riding in grim posses or off duty and sombrely
puffing tobacco, vast, silent men, lean from the wars. The citizens
on the causeway hurried on their errand, eager to find sanctuary
from the biting air and the menace of unknown perils. Never had
London seen such a Christmastide. Every man was moody and careworn,
and the bell of Paul's as it tolled the hours seemed a sullen
prophet of woe.</p>

<p>His servant met him on the stair.</p>

<p>"He is here," he said. "I waited for him in the Bell Yard and
brought him in secretly."</p>

<p>Lovel nodded, and stripped off his cloak, giving it to the man.
"Watch the door like a dragon, Matthew," he told him. "For an
hour we must be alone. Forbid anyone, though it were Sir Harry
himself."</p>

<p>The little chamber was bright with the glow of a coal fire. The
red curtains had been drawn and one lamp lit. The single occupant
sprawled in a winged leather chair, his stretched-out legs in
the firelight, but his head and shoulders in shadow. A man entering
could not see the face, and Lovel, whose eyes had been weakened
by study, peered a second before he closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>"I have come to you, Nick, as always when my mind is in tribulation."</p>

<p>The speaker had a harsh voice, like a bellman's which has been
ruined by shouting against crowds. He had got to his feet and
seemed an elderly man, heavy in body, with legs too short for
the proportions of his trunk. He wore a soldier's coat and belt,
but no sword. His age might have been fifty, but his face was
so reddened by weather that it was hard to judge. The thick straight
black locks had little silver in them, but the hair that sprouted
from a mole on the chin was grey. His cheeks were full and the
heavy mouth was pursed like that of a man in constant painful
meditation. He looked at first sight a grazier from the shires
or some new-made squire of a moderate estate. But the eyes forbade
that conclusion. There was something that brooded and commanded
in those eyes, something that might lock the jaw like iron and
make their possessor a hammer to break or bend the world.</p>

<p>Mr. Lovel stirred the fire very deliberately and sat himself
in the second of the two winged chairs.</p>

<p>"The King?" he queried. "You were in two minds when we last spoke
on the matter. I hoped I had persuaded you. Has some new perplexity
arisen?"</p>

<p>The other shook his big head, so that for a moment he had the
look of a great bull that paws the ground before charging.</p>

<p>"I have no clearness," he said, and the words had such passion
behind them that they were almost a groan.</p>

<p>Lovel lay back in his chair with his finger tips joined, like
a jurisconsult in the presence of a client. "Clearness in such
matters is not for us mortals," he said. "You are walking dark
corridors which the lamp of the law does not light. You are not
summoned to do justice, being no judge, but to consider the well-being
of the State. Policy, Oliver. Policy, first and last."</p>

<p>The other nodded. "But policy is two-faced, and I know not which
to choose."</p>

<p>"Is it still the business of the trial?" Lovel asked sharply.
"We argued that a fortnight since, and I thought I had convinced
you. The case has not changed. Let me recapitulate. Imprimis,
the law of England knows no court which can bring the King of
England before it."</p>

<p>"Tchut, man. Do not repeat that. Vane has been clacking it in
my ear. I tell you, as I told young Sidney, that we are beyond
courts and lawyer's quibbles, and that if England requires it
I will cut off the King's head with the crown on it."</p>

<p>Lovel smiled. "That is my argument. You speak of a trial, but
in justice there can be no trial where there is neither constituted
court nor valid law. If you judge the King, 'tis on grounds of
policy. Can you defend that policy, Oliver? You yourself have
no clearness. Who has? Not Vane. Not Fairfax. Not Whitelocke,
or Widdrington, or Lenthall. Certes, not your old comrade Nick
Lovel."</p>

<p>"The Army desires it&mdash;notably those in it who are most earnest
in God's cause."</p>

<p>"Since when have you found a politic judgment in raw soldiers?
Consider, my friend. If you set the King on his trial it can have
but the one end. You have no written law by which to judge him,
so your canon will be your view of the public weal, against which
he has most grievously offended. It is conceded your verdict must
be guilty and your sentence death. Once put him on trial and you
unloose a great stone in a hill-side which will gather speed with
every yard it journeys. You will put your King to death, and in
whose name?"</p>

<p>Cromwell raised his head which he had sunk between his hands.
"In the name of the Commons of Parliament and all the good people
of England."</p>

<p>"Folly, man. Your Commons are a disconsidered rump of which already
you have made a laughingstock. As for your good people of England,
you know well that ten out of any dozen are against you. The deed
will be done in your own name and that of the hoteads of the Army.
'Twill be an act of war. Think you that by making an end of the
King you will end the Kings party? Nay, you will give it a martyr.
You will create for every woman in England a new saint. You will
outrage all sober folk that love order and at the very moment
when you seek to lay down the sword you make it the sole arbitrament.
Whatsay you to that?"</p>

<p>"There is no need to speak of his death. What if the Court depose
him only?"</p>

<p>"You deceive yourself. Once put him on trial and you must go
through with it to the end. A deposed king will be like a keg
of gunpowder set by your hearth. You cannot hide him so that he
ceases to be a peril. You cannot bind him to terms."</p>

<p>"That is naked truth," said Cromwell grimly. "The man is filled
with a devil of pride. When Denbigh and the other lords went to
him he shut the door in their face. I will have no more of ruining
hypocritical agreements. If God's poor people are to be secure
we must draw his fangs and destroy his power for ill. But how
to do it?" And he made a gesture of despair.</p>

<p>"A way must be found. And let it not be that easy way which will
most utterly defeat your honest purpose. The knots of the State
are to be unravelled, not cut with the sword."</p>

<p>Cromwell smiled sadly, and his long face had for the moment a
curious look of a puzzled child.</p>

<p>"I believe you to be a godly man, friend Nicholas. But I fear
your soul is much overlaid with worldly things, and you lean too
much on frail understanding. I, too, am without clearness. I assent
to your wisdom, but I cannot think it concludes the matter. In
truth, we have come in this dark hour to the end of fleshly reasonings.
It cannot be that the great marvels which the Lord has shown us
can end in barrenness. His glorious dispensations must have an
honest fruition, for His arm is not shortened."</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and tightened the belt which he had unbuckled.
"I await a sign," he said. "Pray for me, friend, for I am a man
in sore perplexity. I lie o' nights at Whitehall in one of the
King's rich beds, but my eyes do not close. From you I have got
the ripeness of human wisdom, but my heart is not satisfied. I
am a seeker, with my ear intent to hear God's command, and I doubt
not that by some providence He will yet show me His blessed way."</p>

<p>Lovel stood as if in a muse while the heavy feet tramped down
the staircase. He heard a whispering below and then the soft closing
of a door. For maybe five minutes he was motionless: then he spoke
to himself after the habit he had. "The danger is not over," he
said, "but I think policy will prevail. If only Vane will cease
his juridical chatter.... Oliver is still at the cross-roads,
but he inclines to the right one.... I must see to it that Hugh
Peters and his crew manufacture no false providences. Thank God,
if our great man is one-third dreamer, he is two-thirds doer,
and can weigh his counsellors."</p>

<p>Whereupon, feeling sharp-set with the cold and the day's labour,
he replenished the fire with a beech faggot, resumed the riding
cloak he had undone and, after giving his servant some instructions,
went forth to sup in a tavern. He went unattended, as was his
custom. The city was too sunk in depression to be unruly.</p>

<p>He crossed Chancery Lane and struck through the narrow courts
which lay between Fleet Street and Holborn. His goal was Gilpin's
in Fetter Lane, a quiet place much in favour with those of the
long robe. The streets seemed curiously quiet. It was freezing
hard and threatening snow, so he flung a fold of his cloak round
his neck, muffling his ears. This deadened his hearing, and his
mind also was busy with its own thoughts, so that he did not observe
that soft steps dogged him. At the corner of an alley he was tripped
up, and a heavy garment flung over his head. He struggled to regain
his feet, but an old lameness, got at Naseby, impeded him. The
cobbles, too, were like glass, and he fell again, this time backward.
His head struck the ground, and though he did not lose consciousness,
his senses were dazed. He felt his legs and arms being deftly
tied, and yards of some soft stuff enveloping his head. He ceased
to struggle as soon as he felt the odds against him, and waited
on fortune. Voices came to his ears, and it seemed that one of
them was a woman's.</p>

<p>The crack on the causeway must have been harder than it appeared,
for Mr. Lovel fell into a doze. When he woke he had some trouble
in collecting his wits. He felt no bodily discomfort except a
little soreness at the back of his scalp. His captors had trussed
him tenderly, for his bonds did not hurt, though a few experiments
convinced him that they were sufficiently secure. His chief grievance
was a sharp recollection that he had not supped; but, being a
philosopher, he reflected that, though hungry, he was warm. He
was in a glass coach driven rapidly on a rough road, and outside
the weather seemed to be wild, for the snow was crusted on the
window. There were riders in attendance; he could hear the click-clack
of ridden horses. Sometimes a lantern flashed on the pane, and
a face peered dimly through the frost. It seemed a face that he
had seen before.</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Lovel began to consider his position. Clearly he
had been kidnapped, but by whom and to what intent? He reflected
with pain that it might be his son's doing, for that gentleman
had long been forbidden his door. A rakehell of the Temple and
married to a cast-off mistress of Goring's, his son was certainly
capable of any evil, but he reminded himself that Jasper was not
a fool and would scarcely see his profit in such an escapade.
Besides, he had not the funds to compass an enterprise which must
have cost money. He thought of the King's party, and dismissed
the thought. His opponents had a certain regard for him, and he
had the name of moderate. No, if politics touched the business,
it was Ireton's doing. Ireton feared his influence with Cromwell.
But that sober man of God was no bravo. He confessed himself at
a loss.</p>

<p>Mr. Lovel had reached this point in his meditations when the
coach suddenly stopped. The door opened, and as he peered into
the semicircle of wavering lamp light he observed a tall young
lady in a riding coat white with snowflakes. She had dismounted
from her horse, and the beast's smoking nostrils were thawing
the ice on her sleeve. She wore a mask, but she did not deceive
her father.</p>

<p>"Cecily," he cried, astounded out of his calm. "What madcap trick
is this?"</p>

<p>The girl for answer flung her bridle to a servant and climbed
into the coach beside him. Once more the wheels moved.</p>

<p>"Oh, father, dearest father, pray forgive me. I have been so
anxious. When you fell I begged Tony to give up the plan, but
he assured me you had taken no hurt. Tell me you are none the
worse."</p>

<p>Mr. Lovel began to laugh, and there was relief in his laugh,
for he had been more disquieted than he would have confessed.</p>

<p>"I am very greatly the worse!" He nodded to his bonds. "I do
not like your endearments, Cis."</p>

<p>"Promise me not to try to escape, and I will cut them." The girl
was very grave as she drew from a reticule beneath her cloak a
pair of housewife's scissors.</p>

<p>Mr. Lovel laughed louder. "I promise to bide where I am in this
foul weather."</p>

<p>Neatly and swiftly she cut the cords and he stretched arms and
legs in growing comfort.</p>

<p>"Also I have not supped."</p>

<p>"My poor father. But in two hours' time you will have supper.
We sleep at&mdash;but that I must not say."</p>

<p>"Where does this journey end? Am I to have no news at all, my
dear?"</p>

<p>"You promised, remember, so I will tell you. Tony and I are taking
you to Chastlecote."</p>

<p>Mr. Lovel whistled. "A long road and an ill. The wind blows bitter
on Cotswold in December. I would be happier in my own house."</p>

<p>"But not safe." The girl's voice was very earnest. "Believe me,
dearest father, we have thought only of you. Tony says that London
streets will soon be running blood. He has it from secret and
sure sources. There is a King's faction in the Army and already
it is in league with the Scots and our own party to compass the
fall of Cromwell. He says it will be rough work and the innocent
will die with the guilty.... When he told me that, I feared for
your life&mdash;and Tony, too, for he loves you. So we carry you to
Chastlecote till January is past, for by then Tony says there
will be peace in England."</p>

<p>"I thank you, Cis,&mdash;and Tony also, who loves me. But if your
news be right, I have a duty to do. I am of Cromwell's party,
as you and Tony are of the King's. You would not have me run from
danger."</p>

<p>She primmed her pretty mouth. "You do not run, you are carried
off. Remember your promise."</p>

<p>"But a promise given under duress is not valid in law."</p>

<p>"You are a gentleman, sir, before you are a lawyer. Besides,
there are six of Tony's men with us&mdash;and all armed."</p>

<p>Mr. Lovel subsided with a chuckle. This daughter of his should
have been a man. Would that Heaven had seen fit to grant him such
a son!</p>

<p>"Two hours to supper," was what he said. "By the slow pace of
our cattle I judge we are on Denham hill. Permit me to doze, my
dear. 'Tis the best antidote to hunger. Whew, but it is cold!
If you catch a quinsy, blame that foolish Tony of yours."</p>

<p>But, though he closed his eyes, he did not sleep. All his life
he had been something of a fatalist, and this temper had endeared
him to Cromwell, who held that no man travelled so far as he who
did not know the road he was going. But while in Oliver's case
the belief came from an ever-present sense of a directing God,
in him it was more of a pagan philosophy. Mr. Lovel was devout
after his fashion, but he had a critical mind and stood a little
apart from enthusiasm. He saw man's life as a thing foreordained,
yet to be conducted under a pretence of freedom, and while a defender
of liberty his admiration inclined more naturally to the rigour
of law. He would oppose all mundane tyrannies, but bow to the
celestial bondage.</p>

<p>Now it seemed that fate had taken charge of him through the medium
of two green lovers. He was to be spared the toil of decision
and dwell in an enforced seclusion. He was not averse to it. He
was not Cromwell with Cromwell's heavy burden; he was not even
a Parliment man; only a private citizen who wished greatly for
peace. He had laboured for peace both in field and council, and
that very evening he had striven to guide the ruler of England.
Assuredly he had done a citizen's duty and might now rest.</p>

<p>His thoughts turned to his family&mdash;the brave girl and the worthless
boy. He believed he had expunged Jasper from his mind, but the
recollection had still power to pain him. That was the stuff of
which the King's faction was made, half-witted rakes who were
arrogant without pride and volcanic without courage.... Not all,
perhaps. The good Tony was a welcome enough son-in-law, though
Cecily would always be the better man. The young Oxfordshire squire
was true to his own royalties, and a mortal could be no more.
He liked the flaxen poll of him, which contrasted well with Cecily's
dark beauty&mdash;and his jolly laugh and the noble carriage of his
head. Yet what wisdom did that head contain which could benefit
the realm of England?</p>

<p>This story of a new plot! Mr. Lovel did not reject it. It was
of a piece with a dozen crazy devices of the King. The man was
no Englishman, but an Italian priest who loved dark ways. A little
good sense, a little honesty, and long ago there would have been
a settlement. But to treat with Charles was to lay foundations
on rotten peat.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, now that he was perforce quit of any share in the
business, he found his wrath rising against the King. A few hours
back he had spoken for him. Had he after all been wrong? He wondered.
Oliver's puzzled face rose before him. He had learned to revere
that strange man's perplexities. No brain was keener to grasp
an argument, for the general was as quick at a legal point as
any lawyer. When, therefore, he still hesitated before what seemed
a final case, it was well to search for hidden flaws. Above all
when he gave no reason it was wise to hasten to him, for often
his mind flew ahead of logic, and at such times he was inspired.
Lovel himself and Vane and Fairfax had put the politic plea which
seemed unanswerable, and yet Oliver halted and asked for a sign.
Was it possible that the other course, the wild course, Ireton's
course, was the right one?</p>

<p>Mr. Lovel had bowed to fate and his captors, and conscious that
no action could follow on any conclusion he might reach, felt
free to indulge his thoughts. He discovered these growing sterner.
He reviewed is argument against the King's trial. Its gravamen
lay in the certainty that trial meant death. The plea against
death was that it would antagonise three-fourths of England, and
make a martyr out of a fool. Would it do no more? Were there no
gains to set against that loss? To his surprise he found himself
confessing a gain.</p>

<p>He had suddenly become impatient with folly. It was Cromwell's
mood, as one who, living under the eye of God, scorned the vapourings
of pedestalled mortals. Mr. Lovel by a different road reached
the same goal. An abiding sense of fate ordering the universe
made him intolerant of trivial claims of prerogative and blood.
Kingship for him had no sanctity save in so far as it was truly
kingly. Were honest folk to be harried because of the whims of
a man whose remote ancestor had been a fortunate bandit? Charles
had time and again broke faith with his people and soaked the
land in blood. In law he could do no wrong, but, unless God slept,
punishment should follow the crime, and if the law gave no aid
the law must be dispensed with. Man was not made for it, but it
for man.</p>

<p>The jurist in him pulled up with a start. He was arguing against
all his training.... But was the plea false? He had urged on Cromwell
that the matter was one of policy. Agreed. But which was the politic
road? If the King lost his head, there would beyond doubt be a
sullen struggle ahead. Sooner or later the regicides would fall&mdash;of
that he had no doubt. But what of the ultimate fate of England?
They would have struck a blow against privilege which would never
be forgotten. In future all kings would walk warily. In time the
plain man might come to his own. In the long run was not this
politic?</p>

<p>"'Tis a good thing my mouth is shut for some weeks," he told
himself. "I am coming round to Ireton. I am no fit company for
Oliver."</p>

<p>He mused a little on his inconstancy. It had not been a frequent
occurrence in his life. But now he seemed to have got a sudden
illumination, such as visited Cromwell in his prayers. He realised
how it had come about. Hitherto he had ridden his thoughts unconsciously
on the curb of caution, for a conclusion reached meant deeds to
follow. But, with the possibility of deeds removed, his mind had
been freed. What had been cloudy before now showed very bright,
and the little lamp of reason he had once used was put out by
an intolerable sunlight. He felt himself quickened to an unwonted
poetry.... His whole outlook had changed, but the change brought
no impulse to action. He submitted to be idle, since it was so
fated. He was rather glad of it, for he felt weary and giddy in
mind.</p>

<p>But the new thoughts once awakened ranged on their courses. To
destroy the false kingship would open the way for the true. He
was no leveller; he believed in kings who were kings in deed.
The world could not do without its leaders. Oliver was such a
one, and others would rise up. Why reverence a brocaded puppet
larded by a priest with oil, when there were men who needed no
robes or sacring to make them kingly? Teach the Lord's Anointed
his mortality, and there would be hope in the years to come of
a true anointing.</p>

<p>He turned to his daughter.</p>

<p>"I believe your night's work, Cis, has been a fortunate thing
for our family."</p>

<p>She smiled and patted his hand, and at the moment with a great
jolting the coach pulled up. Presently lanterns showed at the
window, the door was opened, and Sir Anthony Colledge stood revealed
in the driving snow. In the Chilterns it must have been falling
for hours, for the road was a foot deep, and the wind had made
great drifts among the beech boles. The lover looked somewhat
sheepish as he swept a bow to his prisoner.</p>

<p>"You are a noted horse-doctor, sir," he said. "The off leader
has gotten a colic. Will you treat him? Then I purpose to leave
him with a servant in some near-by farm, and put a ridden horse
in his place."</p>

<p>Mr. Lovel leaped from the coach as nimbly as his old wound permitted.
It was true that the doctoring of horses was his hobby. He loved
them and had a way with them.</p>

<p>The medicine box was got out of the locker and the party grouped
round the grey Flemish horses, which stood smoking in the yellow
slush. The one with the colic had its legs stretched wide; its
flanks heaved and spasms shook its hindquarters. Mr. Lovel set
to work and mixed a dose of spiced oil and spirits which he coaxed
down its throat. Then he very gently massaged certain corded sinews
in its belly. "Get him under cover now, Tony," he said "and tell
your man to bed him warm and give him a bucket of hot water strained
from oatmeal and laced with this phial. In an hour he will be
easy."</p>

<p>The beast was led off, another put in its place, and the postilions
were cracking their whips, when out of the darkness a knot of
mounted men rode into the lamplight. There were at least a dozen
of them, and at their head rode a man who at the sight of Lovel
pulled up sharp.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lovel!" he cried. "What brings you into these wilds in such
weather? Can I be of service? My house is not a mile off."</p>

<p>"I thank you, Colonel Flowerdue, but I think the mischief is
now righted. I go on a journey into Oxfordshire with my daughter,
and the snow has delayed us."</p>

<p>He presented the young Parliament soldier, a cousin of Fairfax,
to Cecily and Tony, the latter of whom eyed with disfavour the
posse of grave Ironside troopers.</p>

<p>"You will never get to Wendover this night," said Flowerdue.
"The road higher up is smothered four feet deep. See, I will show
you a woodland road which the wind has kept clear, and I protest
that your company sleep the night with me at Downing."</p>

<p>He would take no denial, and indeed in the face of his news to
proceed would have been folly. Even Sir Anthony Colledge confessed
it wryly. One of Flowerdue's men mounted to the postilion's place,
and the coach was guided through a belt of beeches, and over a
strip of heath to the gates of a park.</p>

<p>Cecily seized her father's hand. "You have promised, remember."</p>

<p>"I have promised," he replied. "To-morrow, if the weather clears,
I will go with you to Chastlecote."</p>

<p>He spoke no more till they were at the house door, for the sense
of fate hung over him like a cloud. His cool equable soul was
stirred to its depths. There was surely a grim fore-ordering in
this chain of incidents. But for the horse's colic there would
have been no halt. But for his skill in horse doctoring the sick
beast would have been cut loose, and Colonel Flowerdue's party
would have met only a coach laboring through the snow and would
not have halted to discover its occupants.... He was a prisoner
bound by a promise, but this meeting with Flowerdue had opened
up a channel to communicate with London and that was not forbidden.
It flashed on him suddenly that the change of mind which he had
suffered was no longer a private matter. He had now the power
to act upon it.</p>

<p>He was extraordinarily averse to the prospect. Was it mere petulance
that had swung round his opinions so violently during the journey?
He examined himself and found his new convictions unshaken. It
was what the hot-gospellers would call a "Holy Ghost conversion."
Well, let it rest there. Why spread the news beyond his own home?
There were doctors enough inspecting the health of the State.
Let his part be to stand aside.</p>

<p>With something like fear he recognised that that part was no
longer possible. He had been too directly guided by destiny to
refuse the last stage. Cromwell was waiting on a providence, and
of that providence it was clear that fate had made him the channel.
In the coach he had surrendered himself willingly to an unseen
direction, and now he dared not refuse the same docility. He,
who for usual was ripe, balanced, mellow in judgment, felt at
the moment the gloomy impulsion of the fanatic. He was only a
pipe for the Almighty to sound through.</p>

<p>In the hall at Downing the logs were stirred to a blaze, and
food and drink brought in a hospitable stir.</p>

<p>"I have a letter to write before I sleep," Mr. Lovel told his
daughter. "I will pray from Colonel Flowerdue the use of his cabinet."</p>

<p>Cecily looked at him inquiringly, and he laughed.</p>

<p>"The posts at Chastlecote are infrequent, Cis, and I may well
take the chance when it offers. I assure you I look forward happily
to a month of idleness stalking Tony's mallards and following
Tony's hounds."</p>

<p>In the cabinet he wrote half a dozen lines setting out simply
the change in his views. "If I know Oliver," he told himself,
"I have given him the sign he seeks. I am clear it is God's will,
but Heaven help the land &mdash;Heaven help us all." Having written,
he lay back in his chair and mused.</p>

<p>When Colonel Flowerdue entered he found a brisk and smiling gentleman,
sealing a letter.</p>

<p>"Can you spare a man to ride express with this missive to town?
It is for General Cromwell's private hand."</p>

<p>"Assuredly. He will start at once lest the storm worsens. It
is business of State?"</p>

<p>"High business of State, and I think the last I am likely to
meddle with."</p>

<p>Mr. Lovel had taken from his finger a thick gold ring carved
with a much-worn cognisance. He held it up in the light of the
candle.</p>

<p>"This thing was once a king's," he said. "As the letter touches
the affairs of his Majesty, I think it fitting to seal it with
a king's signet."</p>
