<p>Even in that trying moment, Starr could not help reflecting upon
the peculiar turn matters had taken. He failed to understand the
action of the solitary Sioux on the other side, who had contented
himself with the simple theft of the pack-pony, when he might
have done tenfold more injury to the fugitives.</p>

<p>And now, judging from the slight sounds that reached him, there
was another single warrior prowling through the wood, instead
of several. It might be, however, that his companions were near,
awaiting the result of his reconnoissance, and would descend upon
the whites the instant the way opened.</p>

<p>But these speculations were cut short by the alarming discovery
that some strange fatality was bringing the scout fearfully close
to where the husband and wife were standing beside their animals,
hardly daring to speak in the most guarded whispers.</p>

<p>It must have been that the ponies understood what was expected
from them, for they gave not the least sound. There was not a
stamp of a hoof, and their breathing was as gentle as an infant's.
So long as they remained mute it would seem that the peril must
pass by.</p>

<p>And so it ought to have done, for assuredly the Indian could
have gained no clew to the whereabouts of the fugitives from them
or their animals.</p>

<p>But all the same, George Starr was not long in making the uncomfortable
discovery that the red man was at his elbow, and the crisis was
upon him.</p>

<p>The rancher knew where the miscreant was, and he determined to
chance it. He silently clubbed his Winchester, brought it back
over his left shoulder, and, concentrating his utmost strength
in his arms, brought down the butt of this weapon with resistless
force.</p>

<p>It could not have been better aimed had the sun been shining.
It crashed on the crown of the unsuspecting Sioux, who sank silently
to the earth, and it is enough to say that the "subsequent proceedings
interested him no more."</p>

<p>"Sh!" whispered the husband; "there may be others near us; do
you hear anything?"</p>

<p>Neither could catch any suspicious noise, and he concluded it
was best to move on. If they should remain where they were when
daylight came, all hope would be gone. The situation would be
hardly improved if they stayed any longer in the gloom, after
what had taken place.</p>

<p>Making known his purpose to his wife, he placed himself at the
head of Dick, and holding his bit, started forward. The mare followed
the moment she heard what was going on, and the mother with her
child walked between.</p>

<p>But less than twenty steps were taken, when the leader paused
abruptly, alarmed by an altogether unexpected discovery. The twinkle
of a light appeared among the trees in front, so directly in their
path that, had they continued straight forward, they would have
stepped into the blaze.</p>

<p>This was cause for astonishment, and suggested that the fugitives
had struck a place where other Sioux had gathered, probably a
number who knew nothing of what had taken place a short time before.
If this were true, there ought not to be much difficulty in working
past them.</p>

<p>Still, critical as was the situation, he felt that the chance
to learn something ought not to be thrown away. Whispering to
his wife to remain where she was, he left her and stole forward
until he could gain sight of the blaze and those surrounding it.</p>

<p>There was the fire made by a number of sticks heaped against
the trunk of a tree, and burning vigorously, but to his surprise,
not an Indian was in sight. How many had been gathered there,
how long since they had left, whether they would return, and if
so, how soon? All these were questions that must be left to some
other time before even attempting to guess the answers.</p>

<p>He waited some minutes, thinking possibly the missing warriors
would return, but not one showed up, and he felt it would not
do to tarry longer. A goodly portion of the night had already
passed, and Fort Meade was still a long distance away, with a
dangerous stretch of country to pass.</p>

<p>It seemed to the husband and wife that they hardly breathed,
as they moved through the wood. He held his pony by the rein with
his left hand, while he used the right, grasping the Winchester,
to open the way in front. They could do nothing more, listening
meanwhile for the sounds of danger which they expected to hear
every moment.</p>

<p>But lo! while they were advancing in this guarded manner, they
suddenly came out of the wood and into the open country again.</p>

<p>The husband uttered another exclamation of thankfulness, and
checked the animals.</p>

<p>"Now it looks as if we had a chance to accomplish something,"
he said, "and I am sure you are in need of rest."</p>

<p>"I am somewhat weary, but I can stand a great deal more, George;
give no thought to me, but think only of the peril from which
we must escape this night or never."</p>

<p>He gently took the little Dot, swathed as she was in the heavy
blanket, and held her while his wife remounted the mare, without
help. We have said she was an excellent horsewoman, as she had
proved before this eventful night.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, when she was firmly seated and extended her arms
to take the child, "I am going to use my authority as a husband
over you."</p>

<p>"Have I not always been an obedient wife?" she asked, with mock
humility.</p>

<p>"No man was ever blessed with a better helpmate," was the reply.</p>

<p>"I await your commands, my lord."</p>

<p>Instead of passing the child to her, he reached up his rifle.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of that?" she asked wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Lay it across the saddle in front, where its weight will not
discommode you. I shall carry Dot."</p>

<p>"But think, George, of the risk it involves. I assure you that
it will be no task for me to take care of her now that I am in
the saddle again."</p>

<p>"All discussion is ended," he replied, with a severity which
she well knew was assumed, though she did not dispute him. She
accepted the weapon and placed it in position as he directed.
Then supporting the precious child with one arm, he mounted his
pony and placed himself by her side.</p>

<p>"We will ride abreast; if any emergency calls for the use of
my gun, I can pass Dot to you in an instant; you must remember
too, that I have a revolver, which may serve me better in any
sudden peril."</p>

<p>"I obey," she replied, "but you will not deny me the right to
think you are committing a mistake; since, however, it is actuated
by love, I appreciate it."</p>

<p>"I assure you," he said with deep feeling, "that aside from the
consideration due you, I am acting for the best. I wish you, as
long as possible, to remain at my side. We have made so many turnings
and changes in our course that I have lost all idea of the points
of the compass; I do not know whether we are going toward Fort
Meade or straying off to the right or left, with the probability
that in the morning we may be far out of the way. Help me to keep
our bearings."</p>

<p>And husband and wife rode out on the prairie in the darkness
and falling snow.</p>
