<p>AS the death-rattle was heard in McGable's throat, Mansfield
felt his head fall back upon his arm. He looked down and saw that
all was over. Laying his head gently back upon the leaves, he
straightened his limbs, and arose and looked around for his companions.
Peterson and Jenkins approached.</p>

<p>"It is all over," said our hero, sadly. "Poor man! he has paid
dearly for his sins. I pray Heaven, I may never witness another
such a death! Have you found any other bodies?"</p>

<p>"We have not looked; Dingle is searching."</p>

<p>"Let us look further. We will return this afternoon and bury
McGable. Ah! here comes Dingle! What can be the matter with him,
he looks so flustered?"</p>

<p>The ranger approached them, pale and agitated.</p>

<p>"Boys, the <em>FRONTIER ANGEL SITS OUT YONDER ON A LOG, AND SHE
IS DYIN</em>'!"</p>

<p>Without a word, Mansfield dashed toward the point indicated.
The others followed less rapidly, for that singular fear of the
mysterious being forsook them not, even at the last moment. A
few rods brought them to the spot.</p>

<p>That personage, known as the Frontier Angel in these pages, was
sitting upon one of the trees, felled by the choppers, her hand
pressed to her forehead, and her elbows resting upon her knees.
She sat perfectly motionless, and a sickening fear that she was
already dead took possession of Mansfield. The blood could be
seen dropping from her face down upon one of her moccasins, which
was clotted and stained with it. She did not look up as our friends
approached, and Mansfield paused before her and asked:</p>

<p>"Are you hurt much?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I feel wretched&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mansfield sprang forward and caught her head as she fainted.
The sight made even the hardy rangers shudder. A rough wound was
seen at the temple, from which a great amount of blood had issued.
Her dark, waving hair hung loose around her shoulders, while her
half-closed eyes gave an unearthly terror to her countenance.</p>

<p>"Quick! water! she has fainted!" exclaimed Mansfield.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
[Illustration: "'Quick! water; she has fainted,' exclaimed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mansfield."]

</p>
</div>
<p>Peterson sprang away, and in an instant returned with a jug of
water which had been brought by the woodmen in the morning for
their use. Mansfield sprinkled some in her face, and in a moment
she revived. Dingle, with ready wit, had prepared a bandage by
tearing his hunting-shirt to shreds, and this was carefully bound
over her forehead.</p>

<p>"She must be taken to the block-house at once. Bear a hand, friends,"
said Mansfield to the two rangers who were looking on. That absurd
fear made them hesitate for a moment; but, as if ashamed of their
weakness at such a time, they sprang forward and made amends by
sustaining her entire weight themselves.</p>

<p>"Run ahead, Jenkins, and notify the commander of this," said
Mansfield, "and see that no crowd is in our way."</p>

<p>Jenkins darted away, and the three moved carefully through the
wood toward the clearing. An occasional moan from their burden
was the only sign of life she gave. Not a word was spoken by the
three, as they made their way forward. The rangers hardly dared
to look down upon the form their arms sustained, but gazed anxiously
toward the block-house, evidently in fear of a curious multitude
of people. The commander, with praiseworthy foresight, had unbarred
the gates, and prepared the block-house for her reception. Though
nearly struck dumb with Jenkins's intelligence, he did not allow
it to interfere with his duty. He briefly informed those gathered
around what had happened, and besought them to retire and leave
the way clear for him. So, when Mansfield and the rangers brought
their charge, there were only one or two to receive them.</p>

<p>"Is it a bad wound?" he asked, as he closed the doors of the
block-house behind him.</p>

<p>"I fear so; you will have to take charge of her."</p>

<p>"Place her on the litter, and remain with me a moment."</p>

<p>The commander of the fort was the physician of the settlement.
It may seem strange that a man holding his position, could find
time to attend to the duties thus devolving upon him. But he did
find abundant time; for it must be remembered, that such a thing
as sickness is rarely known in a frontier settlement. The time
when his services were in requisition, was upon an occasion like
the present, directly after an engagement with an enemy.</p>

<p>After the sufferer had been placed in the lower room of the block-house,
the commander desired all to depart, so that he might be left
alone with her. His determination was to make an examination of
her wound at once. He saw that she was hurt only in the corner
of the forehead, where it seemed was a slight fracture of the
bone.</p>

<p>As he approached the bed, the Frontier Angel sprang to her feet
and screamed for him to keep away. He did his best to pacify her,
but she became more frantic each moment, until he desisted out
of fear of the consequences. After a time she seated herself upon
the bed, and speaking in a soothing manner, he gently approached
her again. But she was wilder than before, and he retreated at
once. From her actions, she seemed to imagine him to be the renegade
McGable, and no words upon his part could change the impression.</p>

<p>The good physician sat a while in a dilemma. He saw it was imperatively
necessary that her wound should be attended to, and it was impossible
for him to do this alone. After debating a moment, he called in
Mansfield and Peterson.</p>

<p>The latter entered, and the sufferer meekly submitted at once.
Mansfield took her gently but firmly by one arm, and the ranger
held the other. The physician then stepped forward, and, with
a simple instrument, examined the wound. A moment showed him the
entire truth. A bullet, years before, had glanced over the forehead
in such a manner as to press inward a thin strip of bone directly
upon the brain. This simple fact had caused that singular hallucination
which she had so long evinced. The wound had become cicatrized,
leaving the bone in this position. Another shot, precisely similar,
had glanced in the same manner, reopening the wound and increasing
her aberration. A simple action of the physician removed this
cause of her insanity.</p>

<p>"Just wash the wound, Mansfield," said the commander, "and we
will then let her rest until morning."</p>

<p>Our hero proceeded to do as requested. A moment later he exclaimed
in a suppressed voice:</p>

<p>"My heavens! see here &mdash;<em>SHE IS WHITE</em>!"</p>

<p>Such was indeed the case, and the astonishment of all was unbounded.
The water had washed off that species of paint so commonly used
among the American Indians, and left the skin perfectly clear
and transparent.</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" exclaimed the commander, "what can it mean? As it
is nearly all removed from her face, it shows what a beautiful
woman she is. Hello! what's the matter with Peterson?"</p>

<p>The ranger had turned as pale as death and fainted&mdash;a weakness
of which he had never been guilty before. Mansfield instantly
dashed some water in his face and he came to. He stared about
him totally bewildered.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter, Jim?" laughed the commander. "Are you
so tender-hearted that you must faint when a female is hurt?"</p>

<p>"Get me out of here, quick, if you value <em>her</em> life!"
he said, staggering to his feet.</p>

<p>He was assisted to the door, where the physician asked:</p>

<p>"What does this mean, Jim?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you in the morning; don't say anything to me about
it now. Just bring <em>her</em> to her senses as soon as you can."</p>

<p>Wondering and perplexed, the commander passed into the room again.
As he entered, he naturally turned his eyes toward his patient,
and it was now his turn to evince the agitation that had seized
the ranger.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, doctor?" asked Mansfield.</p>

<p>"<em>My heavens! I know that girl!</em>"</p>

<p>"Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Never mind now. I understand the meaning of Peterson's conduct.
Leave me alone, Russel, and it shall all be made plain to you
in the morning."</p>

<p>Our hero withdrew, and the commander was left alone with that
being who has figured as the Frontier Angel in these pages. She
sat bolt upright in the bed, staring at him with a look as fixed
and intense as that of a wild animal.</p>

<p>"Lie down, <em>Myra</em>!" he spoke gently.</p>

<p>"Lie down!" she repeated half to herself. "What does all this
mean? &mdash;Why am I here?&mdash;Have I been wounded?&mdash;Why is my head
bandaged? &mdash;Am I dreaming?"</p>

<p>The commander approached and laid her head back upon the pillow.
In this position she pressed her hand to her forehead and commenced
muttering to herself. The commander listened, and now and then
caught her words.</p>

<p>"Reason has returned, or is now striving to regain its place,"
he thought. "She is, in fact, in her right mind already, but it
is no wonder that her recollections still confuse her. Strange!
strange! who would have thought the Frontier Angel could have
been <em>her</em>?"</p>

<p>Soon the patient slept&mdash;a troubled, dreamy sleep. She talked
incessantly&mdash;now in soft, beseeching tones to Peterson and Holmes
(the commander), then fairly shrieking the name of McGable, and
once or twice she spoke the name of <em>Marian Abbott</em>!</p>

<p>The wind howled around the old block-house, moaning through the
forest and ridging the Ohio till the dismal beat of its waves
could be heard, when an occasional lull occurred. The rain rattled
through the village like the incessant volleys of shot, and the
pale flickering light shining through the loop-holes of the fort
was the only visible sign of life.</p>

<p>The commander paced the floor a while and then sat down and gazed
into the face of the sufferer. Her eyes were closed and her face
was of unearthly whiteness. Now and then the thin lips moved and
the broken words came forth. Once the brow compressed as if a
twinge of pain ran through her, and then she started and gasped:</p>

<p>"Oh, don't! don't! McGable, you will kill her! Let her alone!"</p>

<p>"What can she mean?" wondered Holmes. "Yes&mdash;it is Marian&mdash;there!
she spoke her name then."</p>

<p>All at once, the patient come to the sitting position, and opening
her eyes to their fullest extent, stared apparently through the
very walls of the block-house out into the wilderness. Then, raising
her hand, she repeated these words:</p>

<p>"I see them!&mdash;they are hastening to the cave!&mdash;they will kill
her!&mdash;she cannot get away!&mdash;she will die."</p>

<p>"You are excited&mdash;lie down again!" pleaded the commander. But
she heeded him not. Her dark eyes glowed with tenfold light, and
she added:</p>

<p>"I see them! they are Indians going to kill Marian Abbot! There
are two Shawnee warriors, and they are now picking their way through
the forest. She will die! she will die, if she is not saved at
once!"</p>

<p>The patient seemed as if speaking in a trance. She was in that
state which baffles all human knowledge to understand, and, without
attempting to explain what never can be understood, we give the
facts alone. What the Frontier Angel saw on that stormy night,
when neither the impenetrable walls of the block-house, nor the
miles of wilderness could bound her vision, was really occurring.
And the commander, rapt, wondering, and believing, listened. When
she had finished, she turned toward him.</p>

<p>"Franklin Holmes, I understand all, not all either; but I feel
I have passed through some dreadful darkness, and light is again
dawning upon me. There is a white captive in danger this moment.
She must be rescued! I can lead the way!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but, Myra, you cannot. Hear how the storm rages," pleaded
the commander.</p>

<p>"Have I not passed through more fearful storms than this?" she
asked, stepping upon the floor and confronting him. "Yes," she
added in a low, meaning tone, "if you value the life of Marian
Abbot, <em>who is now living</em>, it must be done. Get me one
or two companions and I will lead the way."</p>

<p>Holmes believed that it was his duty to do so, and answering
her that her wish should be gratified at once, he passed out.
He aroused Dingle and Mansfield, but Peterson was nowhere to be
found. He imparted to the ranger the identity of their guide,
and the absence of Peterson was then understood. Preparations
were made at once to start, and the impatience and excitement
of Mansfield was painful to witness.</p>

<p>The Frontier Angel&mdash;as we shall call her for a time&mdash;arrayed
herself in her usual garments, wrapping a large shawl around her
form, and covering her head securely, and was ready when Holmes
reentered the room.</p>

<p>"How many are going?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Two well-tried and reliable men."</p>

<p>"That is plenty. Let us wait no longer."</p>

<p>She passed out without a word, and the two men joined her. The
commander unbarred the gate and saw them move off in the darkness,
adding no unnecessary caution or question.</p>

<p>"Keep close to me and move as fast as possible," she said as
soon as they were alone.</p>

<p>The rain was still falling, and the wind howled dismally overhead.
The Frontier Angel led the way to the river, where they entered
one of the canoes that were always there, and were propelled across
by Dingle. As they reached the Ohio side the ranger saw a dark
form suddenly appear beside him and glide along as silently as
a shadow.</p>

<p>"Hello! who are you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"You know well enough&mdash;don't speak my name. I knowed you'd be
on some such a tramp as this."</p>

<p>Mansfield recognized the voice of Peterson, and to set their
fair guide at ease, he informed her that it was merely a friend
who had joined them.</p>

<p>The speed with which the Frontier Angel moved through the wood
was wonderful. She neither seemed to run nor walk, but to glide
as silently and swiftly as a specter over the ground. Her companions
did not run, but they executed an amount of what might properly
be termed "tall walking."</p>

<p>On&mdash;on she led them like the <em>ignis fatuus</em>, brushing
through the dripping branches, tumbling over the gnarled and twisted
roots, splashing through the watery hollows, tearing their way
through the tangled undergrowth, until after many a mile had been
passed and hours had elapsed, she halted and said:</p>

<p>"Here is the spot."</p>

<p>At first, our friends were unable to pierce the darkness; but,
after gazing steadily for a few moments, they discerned the faint
outlines of a hill or swell in the ground in front. Still at a
loss to understand how this could be their destination, Mansfield
inquired:</p>

<p>"What is there here that can assist us in our search?"</p>

<p>" &mdash;Sh! some one approaches!" admonished the guide.</p>

<p>The snapping of a twig was heard, and presently the footsteps
of persons. Our friends sank to the earth and silently waited
their approach. Scarcely more than ten feet away they halted,
and presently the guttural voice of a savage was heard. What he
said was of course unintelligible to Mansfield, although Frontier
Angel and Peterson understood every word. Despite the rain which
was still falling, a huge torch instantly flashed out and displayed
the gleaming visages of two Shawnees, stealing forward like the
panther. At the very base of the hill or knoll alluded to, they
halted. Here by the aid of the flickering torches, our friends
were enabled to gain a view of its peculiarities. It merely resembled
a mass of solid green earth, with a number of stones piled at
the base. A moment later, the dusky warriors entered the cave,
and swinging their torch overhead called out: "Pauquachoke! Pauquachoke!"</p>

<p>A shuffling, sliding over the ground was heard, and a bent, withered,
old squaw appeared. For the benefit of our readers we will translate
the Indian tongue into the English.</p>

<p>"What seeks the Shawnee chiefs?" asked the old squaw.</p>

<p>"The captive pale-face, bring her at once."</p>

<p>Thus commanded, the squaw clapped her hands three times, and
with feelings which we leave to the imagination of the reader,
our friends beheld <em>Marian Abbot</em> approach! She said nothing,
but stood with her head meekly bent as if awaiting her doom. She
appeared the same as when Mansfield had last seen her, except
she was paler and more dejected.</p>

<p>The Frontier Angel had entered the cave behind the savages, so
that all save Peterson were now within it. He had purposely remained
outside to conceal his identity. The savages standing with their
backs toward the entrance failed to see the shadows behind them,
which might be said to be in fact a part of the gloom itself,
so faint was the light of the torch.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the meaning of the savages. Their glowing
visages, doubly hideous in their horrid war paint, their weapons,
their attitude, all showed they were upon the work of death. Mansfield
felt ready to spring forward and rend the demons limb from limb;
but an emotion, that was ever after unaccountable to him, held
him in his place.</p>

<p>One of the savages, placed his hand upon the knife in his belt
and addressed Marian in broken English.</p>

<p>"White man, McGable dead&mdash;white gal die too."</p>

<p>"I am ready if you wish to kill me," she replied meekly.</p>

<p>"Pale-face wan't die. McGable say kill white gal ef he no come
back. He no come back&mdash;white gal must die."</p>

<p>"I have told you I am ready&mdash;why do you wait. Strike, now, and
may God forgive you both."</p>

<p>Still the savage hesitated. A baleful light glittered in his
black eye as he surveyed the vision of loveliness before him.
His hand toyed with the buckhorn handle of his knife, and his
chest sank and rose like the billows of the sea. Several times
the knife was partly withdrawn, until Marian wondering at the
stillness and inaction, looked up and encountered the fiery gaze
of the Indian. The latter forced his knife to its place, and sucking
his breath between his teeth, demanded,</p>

<p>"White gal no want to die?"</p>

<p>"I have not deserved death, and I do not wish to die, but I am
prepared for death and expect nothing else at your hands."</p>

<p>"Be Indian chief's squaw?" asked the Indian with the rapidity
of lightning.</p>

<p>Marian started, as if stung by an adder, and gazed into the eyes
which fairly scintillated their electric light into her own. She
comprehended the meaning of the words in an instant.</p>

<p>"No, Indian, I cannot be your squaw."</p>

<p>"Then die&mdash;think two, tree time, afore speak agin."</p>

<p>"No, never, Indian, kill me if you will."</p>

<p>"Then die&mdash;!"</p>

<p>  [Illustration: "Then die&mdash;!"]</p>

<p>Marian darted backward with a piercing shriek, as the torch was
dashed to the ground, and the savage sprang toward her. She had
caught sight of a pale, horror-struck face that shot in from the
mouth of the cave, and heard the words:</p>

<p>"We are here, Marian! Don't be frightened. We'll clear the cave
of these monsters in a second!"</p>

<p>With ready wit, Marian had sprung one side, when the torch fell
to the ground, and thus escaped the well-nigh fatal blow. All
being blank darkness her assassin was at fault, even had he repeated
the attempt. But the Indians scented danger that second, and dashing
the torch to the earth, whisked out of the cave and were gone
in a twinkling, escaping the murderous onslaught Peterson had
prepared himself to give them as they emerged.</p>

<p>A few moments of necessary confusion followed the announcement
of Mansfield's presence. Guided by the unerring instinct of love,
he soon had Marian clasped in his arms. A fervent embrace and
he led her forth. As they passed out of the entrance, the dark
body of the old squaw brushed by them and scurried off in the
darkness.</p>

<p>"Thank God, the dead is alive!" exclaimed Mansfield impulsively,
pressing a kiss upon the cold cheek of Marian. "Can you bear the
walk, dearest? it is a long way to your home; let me wrap this
blanket around you."</p>

<p>"I can bear <em>anything now</em>!" she replied in a low tone.
"Are the Indians gone?"</p>

<p>"None but friends are around you."</p>

<p>"I saw some one just now move by me."</p>

<p>"It is Pe&mdash;a friend."</p>

<p>"Let us go on then. Is this dear, good Frontier Angel here."</p>

<p>"It is to her your life is owing. She is no longer crazy."</p>

<p>"Oh, this must be a dream!" cried Marian, as she was locked in
the arms of her devoted friend. "It cannot&mdash;cannot be real."</p>

<p>For a few moments nothing but the sobbing of the two was heard.
Peterson seemed restless, and moved uneasily but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Let us go," said the Frontier Angel, "for there is a long distance
to travel."</p>

<p>The storm had partly ceased, though the wind was stronger than
ever. Through the woods again&mdash;through swamps and thickets&mdash;over
brooks and the matted undergrowth&mdash;brushing through the dripping
bushes&mdash;until as the misty light of morning was breaking over
the scene, they once more appeared upon the banks of the Ohio,
opposite the block-house.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>It was a happy reunion&mdash;one whose perfect joy our feeble pen
can never give. There were two persons who, it seemed, had risen
from the dead. The Frontier Angel and Marian Abbot. When the identity
and remarkable history of the former became known through the
settlement, there were many, even of the most intelligent, who
believed it nothing less than a miracle.</p>

<p>If the reader, who has followed us through these pages, will
examine the history of the West, he will find that in the summer
of 1788, three flat-boats were attacked by the Shawnees, a short
distance below the mouth of the great Sciota, and nearly all of
the inmates massacred. Two of the boats were sunk, and history
states that every one on board were slain. On the remaining boat
was a Methodist missionary by the name of Tucker, who fought as
only those valiant old Methodist pioneers can fight. There were
several women, who loaded their dead husband's rifles and handed
them to him, while he fired with such deadly effect, that his
boat finally escaped, and he reached Maysville, where, a few days
after, he died of his wounds.</p>

<p>In one of the boats which were sunk by the savages, was a man
named William Orr, with his family. Every one of these, it is
stated by historians, fell a victim to the fury of the Shawnees.
And here we take the liberty of saying that, not for the first
time, the historical accounts are in error. The writer traveled
over that section, where most of our scenes have been laid, some
years since, and obtained from an aged man (who had known the
rangers, Jim Peterson and Dick Dingle, years before) the following
account of the affair:</p>

<p>The boat which contained Orr and his family was the hindmost,
and upon the second volley of the Shawnees, every one was killed,
except Myra Orr, the youngest daughter. Even she was wounded.
A bullet grazed her forehead, pressing a piece of bone inward
upon the brain, in such a manner as to render <em>her crazy</em>!</p>

<p>In a few moments, the savages came up and proceeded to scalp
their victims, when noticing that she was still alive, she was
taken as a prisoner to the shore. It was subsequently ascertained
that she was demented and no harm was offered her.[A] In time,
she dressed and painted like the Indians, but she was never one
of their number. She mingled with them, but her singular manner
impressed them with the belief that she was something more than
mortal. After a year or so, she took to the woods, and somewhere
in its recesses she built herself a home. In the year 1790, she
appeared before a settlement, and warned them of an intended attack,
and from this time up to the closing scenes of our story, she
devoted her life to the one object of befriending the whites.
In time she became known all along the frontier, and the unaccountable
mystery which hung down over her, gave rise to the superstitious
belief that she was in reality an <em>angel</em>. Many attempts
were made to discover her history, but none succeeded, until her
reason was restored and she gave it herself.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
[A] A crazy or idiotic person is always regarded with<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;superstitious reverence by the North American Indian.

</p>
</div>
<p>But what is perhaps nearly as singular, is that Myra Orr, the
"Frontier Angel," and Jim Peterson, the ranger, were lovers in
their younger days. They had separated much in the same manner
that Mansfield and Marian had. When the tragic fate of his love
reached the ears of Peterson, he turned ranger and acted with
the celebrated Dingle in that capacity. He rarely referred to
his great bereavement, but there were several who knew it. Among
these, was Franklin Holmes, commander of the block-house, who
was acquainted with the Orr family, before they removed from the
East.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Peterson left Marian Abbot, as he
believed, in a dying condition, when the flat-boat was attacked.
She was desperately wounded, and without the utmost care would
have died. McGable recognized her as he boarded the flat-boat,
and carried her to the shore, where he gave her in charge of an
Indian runner, with instructions to carry her at once to Pauquachoke,
one of their old "medicine women." McGable instantly returned
and joined in the massacre. A few days after, he visited the medicine
woman, and learned that Marian would recover, although it would
necessarily require a long time. In fact, she had not been able
to walk until a month previous to her rescue. Escape was impossible,
as Pauquachoke had been instructed never to permit her to pass
out of the cave. By an accident, the Frontier Angel became aware
of the state of things and visited the captive on several different
occasions. This reached the ears of McGable, and fearful of losing
his prey through her means, he determined to kill her. His attempts
and failures to do this, have been referred to. The fearful exertion
through which Myra Orr went, on the night of Marian's rescue,
well-nigh proved fatal to her. Reason flickered and fled for a
time, but it finally returned in its full strength.</p>

<p>Marian for a long while was nearly delirious with joy&mdash;and so
were the father and mother, and Mansfield, too. And Jim Peterson,
the genial, good-hearted ranger, was heard to exclaim scores of
times, "It beats all! it's powerful queer that I've met my gal
here for nearly ten years, and was afraid she'd kill me ef she
touched me. It's queer! Powerful queer!"</p>

<p>We wish our readers could have been down at the settlement, on
the night of October 20, 1798. It would have required immense
room, to have accommodated them we suppose, but the woods were
large enough. This double wedding was a greater one than Seth
Jones' and George Graham's. Yet it was much the same, and we will
not describe it, but close our story with a paragraph.</p>

<p>Jim Peterson gave up the ranger's life and settled down as a
farmer. He had several children, and two of his grandsons are
now prominent merchants in the city of Cincinnati. In the war
of 1812, Russel Mansfield acted as Colonel, and at its close retired
to his farm near Maysville, covered with honor and glory. Here
he lived with his children and grandchildren, and it is only a
few years since that he followed his wife to her last resting-place.
Dick Dingle and Peter Jenkins became bosom friends, and spent
many years of adventure and peril together. We will dismiss them,
with the promise that their experiences shall not be withheld
from the reader, and that they both shall be heard of again.</p>
