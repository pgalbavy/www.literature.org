<p>It was still dark when he awoke with a violent start, dreaming
of loud trumpets, and found himself sitting upright on his cot,
staring into obscurity.</p>

<p>Outside on the veranda a multitude of heavy steps echoed and
re-echoed over the creaking boards; spurs clinked, sabres dragged
and clanked; a man's harsh, nasal voice sounded irritably at intervals:</p>

<p>"We're not an army&mdash;we're not yet an army; that's what's the
matter.  You can't erect an army by uniforming and drilling a
few hundred thousand clerks and farmers.  You can't manufacture
an army by brigading regiments&mdash;by creating divisions and forming
army corps.  There is only one thing on God's long-enduring earth
that can transform this mob of State troops into a National army&mdash;discipline!&mdash;and
that takes time; and we've got to take it and let experience kick
us out of one battle into another.  And some day we'll wake up
to find ourselves a real army, with real departments, really controlled
and in actual and practical working order.  Now it's every department
for itself and God help General McClellan!  He has my sympathy! 
He has a dirty job on his hands half done, and they won't let
him finish it!"</p>

<p>And again the same impatient voice broke out contemptuously:</p>

<p>"War?  These two years haven't been two years of war!  They've
been two years of a noisy, gaudy, rough and tumble!  Bull Run
was <em>opera bouffe</em>!  The rest of it has been one fantastic
and bloody carnival!  Did anybody ever before see such a grandmother's
rag bag of uniforms in an American army!  What in hell do we want
of zouaves in French uniforms, cavalry, armed with Austrian lances,
ridiculous rocket-batteries, Polish riders, Hungarian hussars,
grenadiers, mounted rifles, militia and volunteers in every garb,
carrying every arm ever created by foreign armourers and military
tailors! . . .  But I rather guess that the fancy-dress-ball era
is just about over.  I've a notion that we're coming down to the
old-fashioned army blue again.  And the sooner the better.  I
want no more red fezzes and breeches in my commands for the enemy
to blaze at a mile away!  I want no more picturesque lances. 
I want plain blue pants and Springfield rifles, by God! And I
guess I'll get them, if I make noise enough in North America!"</p>

<p>Who this impassioned military critic was, shouting opinions to
the sky, Berkley never learned; for presently there was a great
jingling and clatter and trample of horses brought around, and
the officers, whoever they were, mounted and departed as they
had arrived, in darkness, leaving Berkley on his cot in the storehouse
to stretch his limbs, and yawn and stretch again, and draw the
warm folds of the blanket closer, and lie blinking at the dark,
through which, now, a bird had begun to twitter a sweet, fitful
salute to the coming dawn.</p>

<p>Across the foot of his couch lay folded an invalid's red hospital
wrapper; beside his bed stood the slippers.  After a few moments
he rose, stepped into the slippers, and, drawing on the woolen
robe, belted it in about his thin waist.  Then he limped out to
the veranda.</p>

<p>In the dusk the bird sang timidly.  Berkley could just make out
the outlines of the nearer buildings, and of tall trees around. 
Here and there lights burned behind closed windows; but, except
for these, the world was black and still; stiller for the deadened
stamping of horses in distant unseen stalls.</p>

<p>An unmistakable taint of the hospital hung in the fresh morning
air&mdash;a vague hint of anaesthetics, of cooking&mdash;the flat odour
of sickness and open wounds.</p>

<p>Lanterns passed in the darkness toward the stables; unseen shapes
moved hither and thither, their footsteps sharply audible.  He
listened and peered about him for a while, then went back to the
store-room, picked his way among the medical supplies, and sat
down on the edge of his bed.</p>

<p>A few moments later he became aware of somebody moving on the
veranda, and of a light outside; heard his door open, lifted his
dazzled eyes in the candle rays.</p>

<p>"Are you here, Philip?" came a quiet, tired voice.  "You must
wake, now, and dress.  Colonel Arran is conscious and wishes to
see you."</p>

<p>"Ailsa! Good God!"</p>

<p>She stood looking at him placidly, the burning candle steady
in her hand, her; face very white and thin.</p>

<p>He had risen, standing there motionless in his belted invalid's
robe with the stencilled S. C.  on the shoulder.  And now he would
have gone to her, hands outstretched, haggard face joyously illumined;
but she stepped back with a swift gesture that halted him; and
in her calm, unfriendly gaze he hesitated, bewildered, doubting
his senses.</p>

<p>"Ailsa, dear, is anything wrong?"</p>

<p>"I think," she said quietly, "that we had better not let Colonel
Arran see how wrong matters have gone between us.  He is very
badly hurt.  I have talked a little with him.  I came here because
he asked for you and for no other reason."</p>

<p>"Did you know I was here?"</p>

<p>"I saw you arrive last night&mdash;from the infirmary window. . .
.  I hope your wound is healed," she added in a strained voice.</p>

<p>"Ailsa! What has happened?"</p>

<p>She shuddered slightly, looked at, him without a shadow of expression.</p>

<p>"Let us understand one another now.  I haven't the slightest
atom of&mdash;regard&mdash;left for you.  I have no desire to see you, to
hear of you again while I am alive.  That is final."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me why?"</p>

<p>She had turned to go; now she hesitated, silent, irresolute.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me, Ailsa?"</p>

<p>She said, wearily: "If you insist, I can make it plainer, some
time.  But this is not the time. . .  And you had better not ask
me at all, Philip."</p>

<p>"I do ask you."</p>

<p>"I warn you to accept your dismissal without seeking an explanation. 
It would spare&mdash;us both."</p>

<p>"I will spare neither of us.  What has changed you?"</p>

<p>"I shall choose my own convenience to answer you," she replied
haughtily.</p>

<p>"Choose it, then, and tell me when to expect your explanation."</p>

<p>"When I send for you; not before."</p>

<p>"Are you going to let me go away with that for my answer?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>He hooked his thumbs in his girdle and looked down, considering;
then, quietly raising his head:</p>

<p>"I don't know what you have found out&mdash;what has been told you. 
I have done plenty of things in my life unworthy of you, but I
thought you knew that."</p>

<p>"I know it now."</p>

<p>"You knew it before.  I never attempted to conceal anything."</p>

<p>A sudden blue glimmer made her eyes brilliant.  "That is a falsehood!"
she said deliberately.  The colour faded from his cheeks, then
he said with ashy composure:</p>

<p>"I lie much less than the average man, Ailsa.  It is nothing
to boast of, but it happens to be true.  I don't lie."</p>

<p>"You keep silent and act a lie!"</p>

<p>He reflected for a moment; then:</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better tell me?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Then his colour returned, surging, making the scar on his face
hideous; he turned, walked to the window, and stood looking into
the darkness while the departing glimmer of her candle faded on
the wall behind him.</p>

<p>Presently, scraping, ducking, chuckling, the old darky appeared
with his boots and uniform, everything dry and fairly clean; and
he dressed by lantern light, buckled his belt, drew on his gloves,
settled his forage cap, and followed the old man out into the
graying dawn.</p>

<p>They gave him some fresh light bread and a basin of coffee; he
finished and waited, teeth biting the stem of his empty pipe for
which he had no tobacco.</p>

<p>Surgeons, assistant surgeons, contract physicians, ward-masters,
nurses, passed and re-passed; stretchers filed into the dead house;
coffins were being unloaded and piled under a shed; a constant
stream of people entered and left the apothecary's office; the
Division Medical Director's premises were besieged.  Ambulances
continually drove up or departed; files of sick and wounded, able
to move without assistance, stood in line, patient, uncomplaining
men, bloody, ragged, coughing, burning with fever, weakened for
lack of nourishment; many crusted with filth and sometimes with
vermin, humbly awaiting the disposition of their battered, half-dead
bodies. . . .</p>

<p>The incipient stages of many diseases were plainly apparent among
them.  Man after man was placed on a stretcher, and hurried off
to the contagious wards; some were turned away and directed to
other hospitals, and they went without protest, dragging their
gaunt legs, even attempting some feeble jest as they passed their
wretched comrades whose turns had not yet come.</p>

<p>Presently a hospital servant came and took Berkley away to another
building.  The wards were where the schoolrooms had been. Blackboards
still decorated the wall; a half-erased exercise in Latin remained
plainly visible over the rows of cots.</p>

<p>Ailsa and the apothecary stood together in low-voiced conversation
by a window.  She merely raised her eyes when Berkley entered;
then, without giving him a second glance, continued her conversation.</p>

<p>In the heavy, ether-laden atmosphere flies swarmed horribly,
and men detailed as nurses from regimental companies were fanning
them from helpless patients.  A civilian physician, coming down
the aisle, exchanged a few words with the ward-master and then
turned to Berkley.</p>

<p>"You are trooper Ormond, orderly to Colonel Arran?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Colonel Arran desires you to remain here at his orders for the
present."</p>

<p>"Is Colonel Arran likely to recover, doctor?"</p>

<p>"He is in no immediate danger."</p>

<p>"May I see him?"</p>

<p>"Certainly.  He sent for you.  Step this way."</p>

<p>They entered another and much smaller ward in which there were
very few cots, and from which many of the flies had been driven.</p>

<p>Colonel Arran lay very white and still on his cot; only his eyes
turned as Berkley came up and stood at salute.</p>

<p>"Sit down," he said feebly.  And, after a long silence:</p>

<p>"Berkley, the world seems to be coming right.  I am grateful
that <em>I&mdash;</em>lie here&mdash;with you beside me."</p>

<p>Berkley's throat closed; he could not speak; nor did he know
what he might have said could he have spoken, for within him all
had seemed to crash softly into chaos, and he had no mind, no
will, no vigour, only a confused understanding of emotion and
pain, and a fierce longing.</p>

<p>Colonel Arran's sunken eyes never left his, watching, wistful,
patient.  And at last the boy bent forward and rested his elbows
on his knees and dropped his face in both hands.  Time ebbed away
in silence; there was no sound in the ward save the blue flies'
buzz or the slight movement of some wounded man easing his tortured
body.</p>

<p>"Philip!"</p>

<p>The boy lifted his face from his hands.</p>

<p>"Can you forgive me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have. . . .  There was only one thing to forgive.  I
don't count&mdash;myself."</p>

<p>"I count it&mdash;bitterly."</p>

<p>"You need not. . . .  It was only&mdash;my mother&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I know, my boy.  The blade of justice is double-edged.  No mortal
can wield it safely; only He who forged it. . . .  I have never
ceased to love&mdash;your mother."</p>

<p>Berkley's face became ashen.</p>

<p>Colonel Arran said: "Is there punishment more terrible than that
for any man?"</p>

<p>Presently Berkley drew his chair closer.</p>

<p>"I wish you to know how mother died," he said simply.  "It is
your right to know. . . .  Because, there will come a time when
she and&mdash;you will be together again . . .  if you believe such
things."</p>

<p>"I believe."</p>

<p>For a while the murmur of Berkley's voice alone broke the silence.
Colonel Arran lay with eyes closed, a slight flush on his sunken
cheeks; and, before long, Berkley's hand lay over his and remained
there.</p>

<p>The brilliant, ominous flies whirled overhead or drove headlong
against the window-panes, falling on their backs to kick and buzz
and scramble over the sill; slippered attendants moved softly
along the aisle with medicines; once the ward-master came and
looked down at Colonel Arran, touched the skin of his face, his
pulse, and walked noiselessly away.  Berkley's story had already
ended.</p>

<p>After a while he said: "If you will get well&mdash;whatever I am&mdash;we
two men have in common a memory that can never die.  If there
were nothing else &mdash;God knows whether there is&mdash;that memory
is enough, to make us live at peace with one another. . . .  I
do not entirely understand how it is with me, but I know that
some things have been washed out of my heart&mdash;leaving little of
the bitterness&mdash;nothing now of anger.  It has all been too sad
for such things&mdash;a tragedy too deep for the lesser passions to
meddle with. . . .  Let us forgive each other. . . .  She will
know it, somehow."</p>

<p>Their hands slowly closed together and remained.</p>

<p>"Philip!"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"Ailsa is here."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Will you say to her that I would like to see her?"</p>

<p>For a moment Berkley hesitated, then rose quietly and walked
into the adjoining ward.</p>

<p>Ailsa was bending over a sick man, fanning away the flies that
clustered around the edge of the bowl from which he was drinking.
And Berkley waited until the patient had finished the broth.</p>

<p>"Ailsa, may I speak to you a moment?"</p>

<p>She had been aware of his entrance, and was not startled.  She
handed the bowl and fan to an attendant, turned leisurely, and
came out into the aisle.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Colonel Arran wishes to see you.  Can you come?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>She led the way; and as she walked he noticed that all the lithe
grace, all the youth and spring to her step had vanished.  She
moved wearily; her body under the gray garb was thin; blue veins
showed faintly in temple and wrist; only her superb hair and eyes
had suffered no change.</p>

<p>Colonel Arran's eyes opened as she stooped at his bedside and
laid her lips lightly on his forehead.</p>

<p>"Is there another chair?" he asked wearily.</p>

<p>Ailsa's glance just rested on Berkley, measuring him in expressionless
disdain.  Then, as he brought another chair, she seated herself.</p>

<p>"You, too, Philip," murmured the wounded man.</p>

<p>Ailsa's violet eyes opened in surprise at the implied intimacy
between these men whom she had vaguely understood were anything
but friends.  But she remained coldly aloof, controlling even
a shiver of astonishment when Colonel Arran's hand, which held
hers, groped also for Berkley's, and found it.</p>

<p>Then with an effort he turned his head and looked at them.</p>

<p>"I have long known that you loved each other," he whispered. 
"It is a happiness that God sends me as well as you.  If it be
His will that <em>I&mdash;</em>do not recover, this makes it easy for
me.  If He wills it that I live, then, in His infinite mercy,
He also gives me the reason for living."</p>

<p>Icy cold, Ailsa's hand lay there, limply touching Berkley's;
the sick man's eyes were upon them.</p>

<p>"Philip!"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"My watch is hanging from a nail on the wall.  There is a chamois
bag hanging with it.  Give&mdash;it&mdash;to me."</p>

<p>And when it lay in his hand he picked at the string, forced it
open, drew out a key, and laid it in Berkley's hand with a faint
smile.</p>

<p>"You remember, Philip?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The wounded man looked at Ailsa wistfully.</p>

<p>"It is the key to my house, dear.  One day, please God, you and
Philip will live there." . . .  He closed his eyes, groping for
both their hands, and retaining them, lay silent as though asleep.</p>

<p>Berkley's palm burned against hers; she never stirred, never
moved a muscle, sitting there as though turned to stone.  But
when the wounded man's frail grasp relaxed, cautiously, silently,
she freed her fingers, rose, looked down, listening to his breathing,
then, without a glance at Berkley, moved quietly toward the door.</p>

<p>He was behind her a second later, and she turned to confront
him in the corridor lighted by a single window.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me what has changed you?" he said.</p>

<p>"Something which that ghastly farce cannot influence!" she said,
hot faced, eyes brilliant with anger.  "I loved Colonel Arran
enough to endure it&mdash;endure your touch&mdash;which shames&mdash;defiles&mdash;which&mdash;which
outrages every instinct in me!"</p>

<p>Breathless, scornful, she drew back, still facing him.</p>

<p>"The part you have played in my life!" she said bitterly&mdash;"think
it over.  Remember what you have been toward me from the first&mdash;a
living insult!  And when you remember&mdash;all&mdash;remember that in spite
of <em>all</em> I &mdash;I loved you&mdash;stood before you in the
rags of my pride&mdash;all that you had left me to clothe myself!&mdash;stood
upright, unashamed, and acknowledged that I loved you!"</p>

<p>She made a hopeless gesture.</p>

<p>"Oh, you had all there was of my heart!  I gave it; I laid it
beside my pride, under your feet.  God knows what madness was
upon me&mdash;and you had flung my innocence into my face!  And you
had held me in your embrace, and looked me in the eyes, and said
you would not marry me.  And I still loved you!"</p>

<p>Her hands flew to her breast, higher, clasped against the full,
white throat.</p>

<p>"Now, have I not dragged my very soul naked under your eyes? 
Have I not confessed enough.  What more do you want of me before
you consent to keep your distance and trouble me no more?"</p>

<p>"I want to know what has angered you against me," he said quietly.</p>

<p>She set her teeth and stared at him, with beautiful resolute
eyes.</p>

<p>"Before I answer that," she said, "I demand to know why you refused
to marry me."</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you, Ailsa."</p>

<p>In a white rage she whispered:</p>

<p>"No, you dare not tell me!&mdash;you coward! I had to learn the degrading
reason from others!"</p>

<p>He grew deathly white, caught her arms in a grasp of steel, held
her twisting wrists imprisoned.</p>

<p>"Do you know what you are saying?" he stammered.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know! Your cruelty&mdash;your shame&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Be silent!" he said between his teeth.  "My shame is my pride! 
Do you understand!"</p>

<p>Outraged, quivering all over, she twisted out of his grasp.</p>

<p>"Then go to her!" she whispered.  "Why don't you go to her?"</p>

<p>And, as his angry eyes became blank:</p>

<p>"Don't you understand?  She is there&mdash;just across the road!"
She flung open the window and pointed with shaking anger.</p>

<p>"Didn't anybody tell you she is there?  Then I'll tell you. 
Now go to her!  You are&mdash;worthy&mdash;of one another!"</p>

<p>"Of whom are you speaking&mdash;in God's name!" he breathed.</p>

<p>Panting, flushed, flat against the wall, she looked back out
of eyes that had become dark and wide, fumbling in the bosom of
her gray garb.  And, just where the scarlet heart was stitched
across her breast, she drew out a letter, and, her fascinated
gaze still fixed on him, extended her arm.</p>

<p>He took the crumpled sheets from her in a dazed sort of way,
but did not look at them.</p>

<p>"<em>Who</em> is there&mdash;across the road?" he repeated stupidly.</p>

<p>"Ask&mdash;Miss &mdash;Lynden."</p>

<p>"Letty!"</p>

<p>But she suddenly turned and slipped swiftly past him, leaving
him there in the corridor by the open window, holding the letter
in his hand.</p>

<p>For a while he remained there, leaning against the wall.  Sounds
from the other ward came indistinctly&mdash;a stifled cry, a deep groan,
the hurried tread of feet, the opening or closing of windows. 
Once a dreadful scream rang out from a neighbouring ward, where
a man had suddenly gone insane; and he could hear the sounds of
the struggle, the startled orders, the shrieks, the crash of a
cot; then the dreadful uproar grew fainter, receding.  He roused
himself, passed an unsteady hand across his eyes, looked blindly
at the letter, saw only a white blurr, and, crushing it in his
clenched fist, he went down the kitchen stairs and out across
the road.</p>

<p>A hospital guard stopped him, but on learning who he was and
that he had business with Miss Lynden, directed him toward a low,
one-storied, stone structure, where, under the trees, a figure
wrapped in a shawl lay asleep in a chair.</p>

<p>"She's been on duty all night," observed the guard.  "If you've
got to speak to her, go ahead."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Berkley in a dull voice, "I've got to speak to her."
And he walked toward her across the dead brown grass.</p>

<p>Letty's head lay on a rough pine table; her slim body, supported
by a broken chair, was covered by a faded shawl; and, as he looked
down at her, somehow into his memory came the recollection of
the first time he ever saw her so&mdash;asleep in Casson's rooms, her
childish face on the table, the room reeking with tobacco smoke
and the stale odour of wine and dying flowers.</p>

<p>He stood for a long while beside her, looking down at the thin,
pale face.  Then, in pity, he turned away; and at the same moment
she stirred, sat up, confused, and saw him.</p>

<p>"Letty, dear," he said, coming back, both hands held out to her,
"I did not mean to rob you of your sleep."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;it doesn't matter!  I am so glad&mdash;" She sat up suddenly,
staring at him.  The next moment the tears rushed to her eyes.</p>

<p>"<em>O&mdash;</em>h," she whispered, "I wished so to see you.  I am
so thankful you are here.  There is&mdash;there has been such&mdash;a terrible
change&mdash;something has happened&#11834;"</p>

<p>She rose unsteadily; laid her trembling hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"I don't know what it is," she said piteously, "but Ailsa&mdash;something
dreadful has angered her against me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Against <em>you</em>!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes.  I <em>don't</em> know all of it; I know&mdash;partly."</p>

<p>Sleep and fatigue still confused her mind; she pressed both frail
hands to her eyes, her forehead:</p>

<p>"It was the day I returned from seeing you at Paigecourt. . .
.  I was deadly tired when the ambulance drove into Azalea; and
when it arrived here I had fallen asleep. . . .  I woke up when
it stopped. Ailsa was sitting here&mdash;in this same chair, I think&mdash;and
I remember as I sat up in the ambulance that an officer was just
leaving her &mdash;Captain Hallam."</p>

<p>She looked piteously at Berkley.</p>

<p>"He was one of the men I have avoided.  Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"No. . . .  Was he&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, he often came to the &mdash;Canterbury.  He had never spoken
to me there, but Ione Carew knew him; and I was certain he would
recognise me. . . .  I thought I had succeeded in avoiding him,
but he must have seen me when I was not conscious of his presence&mdash;he
must have recognised me."</p>

<p>She looked down at her worn shoes; the tears fell silently; she
smoothed her gray gown for lack of employment for her restless
hands.</p>

<p>"Dear," he said, "do you believe he went to Ailsa with his story
about you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, I am sure.  What else could it be that has angered
her&mdash;that drives me away from her&mdash;that burns me with the dreadful
gaze she turns on me&mdash;chills me with her more dreadful silence?
. . .  Why did he do it? I don't know&mdash;oh, I don't know. . . . 
Because I had never even spoken to him&mdash;in those days that I have
tried so hard&mdash;so hard to forget&#11834;"</p>

<p>He said slowly: "He is a coward.  I have known that for a long
time.  But most men are.  The disgrace lies in acting like one.
. . And <em>I&mdash;</em>that is why I didn't run in battle. . . . 
Because, that first day, when they fired on our waggons, <em>I
saw him riding in the road behind us</em>.  Nobody else suspected
him to be within miles.  I saw him.  And&mdash;<em>he galloped the
wrong way</em>.   And that is why <em>I&mdash;</em>did what I did! 
He shocked me into doing it. . . .  But I never before have told
a soul.  I would not tell even you&mdash;but the man, yesterday, put
himself beyond the pale.  And it can make no difference now, for
he carries the mark into his grave."</p>

<p>He shuddered slightly.  "God forbid I hold him up to scorn. 
I might, this very moment, be what he is now.  No man may know&mdash;no
man can foretell how he will bear himself in time of stress. 
I have a sorry record of my own.  Battle is not the only conflict
that makes men or cowards."</p>

<p>He stood silent, gazing into space.  Letty's tears dried as she
watched him.</p>

<p>"Have you seen&mdash;her?" she asked tremulously.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The girl sighed and looked down.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry about Colonel Arran . . . .  I believe, somehow,
he will get well."</p>

<p>"Do you really believe it, Letty?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  The wound is clean.  I have seen many recover who were
far more dangerously hurt. . . .  His age is against him, but
I do truly believe he will get well."</p>

<p>He thought a moment.  "Have you heard about Stephen Craig?"</p>

<p>"They have telegraphed to his affianced&mdash;a Miss Lent.  You probably
know her.  Her brother was killed a day or two ago.  Poor little
thing!  I believe that Miss Lent is coming.  Mrs. Craig wishes
to take her boy North as soon as he can be moved.  And, unless
the wound becomes infected, I don't believe he is going to die."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"At Paigecourt.  Many transports are waiting at the landing.
. . . They say that there was another severe engagement near there
yesterday, and that our army is victorious.  I have heard, also,
that we were driven in, and that your regiment lost a great many
men and horses . . .  I don't know which is true," she added,
listlessly picking at her frayed gown; "only, as we haven't heard
the guns to-day, it seems to me that if we had lost the battle
we'd have Confederate cannon thundering all around us."</p>

<p>"That seems reasonable," he admitted absently. . . .  "Is Dr.
Benton here still?"</p>

<p>"No," she said softly.</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"At Paigecourt.  I asked him to go because he is the best doctor
I ever knew.  He came down here to see me; he is not detailed
for duty under contract.  I asked him to go and see Stephen Craig. 
He grumbled&mdash;and went."</p>

<p>She looked up shyly at Berkley, smiled for the first time, then
her pale young face grew beautiful and solemn.</p>

<p>"You dear girl," he said impulsively, taking both her hands and
kissing them.  "I am so glad for you&mdash;and for him.  I knew it
would come true."</p>

<p>"Yes.  But I had to tell him &mdash;I started to tell him&mdash;and&mdash;oh,
would you believe how splendid he is!  He <em>knew</em> already! 
He stopped me short&mdash;and I never can forget the look in his face. 
And he said: 'Child&mdash;child!  You can tell me nothing I am not
already aware of. And I am aware of nothing except your goodness.'"</p>

<p>"I <em>thought</em> I knew Phineas Benton," said Berkley, warmly. 
"He was too upright a character for me to enjoy with any comfort&mdash;a
few years back. . . .  I'm trying harder than you ever had to,
Letty. You always desired to be decent; I didn't."  He shook both
her hands heartily.</p>

<p>"You deserve every atom of your happiness, you dear, sweet girl! 
I only wish you were safely out of here and back in the North!"</p>

<p>Letty began to cry softly:</p>

<p>"Forgive me, please; I'm not naturally as tearful as this.  I
am just tired.  I've done too much&mdash;seen too much&mdash;and it hasn't
hardened me; it has made me like a silly child, ready to sniffle
at anything."</p>

<p>Berkley laughed gently.</p>

<p>"Why are you crying now, Letty?"</p>

<p>"B-because they have offered me a furlough.  I didn't apply. 
But Dr. Benton has made me take it.  And it almost kills me to
go North and leave Ailsa&mdash;alone&mdash;and so strangely changed toward
me&#11834;"</p>

<p>She straightened her shoulders resolutely; brushed the tears
from her lashes; strove to smile at him.</p>

<p>"Shall we walk a little?  I am not on duty, you know; and I've
had enough sleep.  There's such a pretty lane along the creek
behind the chapel. . . .  What are you doing here, anyway?  I
suppose you are acting orderly to poor Colonel Arran?  How splendidly
the Lancers have behaved! . . .  And those darling Zouaves!&mdash;oh,
we are just bursting with pride over our Zou-zous&#11834;"</p>

<p>They had turned away together, walking slowly through the grove
toward a little cart road deep in golden seeded grass which wound
down a hollow all moist with ferns and brambles and young trees
in heavy leaf.</p>

<p>Her hand, unconsciously, had sought his nestling into it with
a confidence that touched him; her pale, happy face turned continually
to meet his as she chatted innocently of the things which went
to make up the days of life for her, never conscious of herself,
or that the artless chatter disclosed anything admirable in her
own character.  She prattled on at random, sometimes naive, sometimes
wistful, sometimes faintly humourous&mdash;a brave, clean spirit that
was content to take the consequence of duty done&mdash;a tender, gentle
soul, undeformed amid the sordid horrors that hardened or crippled
souls less innocent.</p>

<p>Calm, resourceful, patient, undismayed amid conditions that sickened
mature experience to the verge of despair, she went about her
business day after day, meeting all requisitions upon her slender
endurance without faltering, without even supposing there was
anything unusual or praiseworthy in what she did.</p>

<p>She was only one of many women who did full duty through the
darkest days the nation ever knew&mdash;saints in homespun, martyrs
uncanonised save in the hearts of the stricken.</p>

<p>There was a small wooden foot-bridge spanning the brook, with
a rough seat nailed against the rail.</p>

<p>"One of my convalescents made it for me," she said proudly. 
"He could use only one arm, and he had such a hard time sawing
and hammering! and the foolish boy wouldn't let anybody help him."</p>

<p>She seated herself in the cool shade of a water oak, retaining
his hand in hers and making room for him beside her.</p>

<p>"I wonder," she said, "if you know how good you have been to
me. You changed all my life.  Do you realise it?"</p>

<p>"You changed it yourself, Letty."</p>

<p>She sighed, leaned back, dreamy eyed, watching the sun spots
glow and wane on the weather-beaten footbridge.</p>

<p>"In war time&mdash;here in the wards&mdash;men seem gentler to women&mdash;kinder&mdash;than
in times of peace.  I have stood beside many thousands; not one
has been unkind&mdash;lacking in deference. . . ."  A slight smile
grew on her lips; she coloured a little, looked up at Berkley,
humorously.</p>

<p>"It would surprise you to know how many have asked me to marry
them. . . .  Such funny boys. . . .  I scolded some of them and
made them write immediately to their sweethearts. . . .  The older
men were more difficult to manage&mdash;men from the West&mdash;such fine,
simple-natured fellows&mdash;just sick and lonely enough to fall in
love with any woman who fanned them and brought them lemonade.
. . .  I loved them all dearly.  They have been very sweet to
me. . . .  Men <em>are</em> good. . . .  If a woman desires it.
. . .  The world is so full of people who don't mean to do wrong."</p>

<p>She bent her head, considering, lost in the retrospection of
her naive philosophy.</p>

<p>Berkley, secretly amused, was aware of several cadaverous convalescents
haunting the bushes above, dodging the eyes of this pretty nurse
whom one and all adored, and whom they now beheld, with jealous
misgivings, in intimate and unwarrantable tete-a-tete with a common
and disgustingly healthy cavalryman.</p>

<p>Then his weather-tanned features grew serious.</p>

<p>The sunny moments slipped away as the sunlit waters slipped under
the bridge; a bird or two, shy and songless in their moulting
fever, came to the stream to drink, looking up, bright eyed, at
the two who sat there in the mid-day silence.  One, a cardinal,
ruffled his crimson crest, startled, as Berkley moved slightly.</p>

<p>"The Red Birds," he said, half aloud.  "To me they are the sweetest
singers of all.  I remember them as a child, Letty."</p>

<p>After a while Letty rose; her thin hand lingered, on his shoulder
as she stood beside him, and he got to his feet and adjusted belt
and sabre.</p>

<p>"I love to be with you," she said wistfully.  "It's only because
I do need a little more sleep that I am going back."</p>

<p>"Of course," he nodded.  And they retraced their steps together.</p>

<p>He left her at the door of the quaint, one-storied stone building
where, she explained, she had a cot.</p>

<p>"You <em>will</em> come to see me again before you go back to
your regiment, won't you?" she pleaded, keeping one hand in both
of hers.</p>

<p>"Of course I will.  Try to get some sleep, Letty.  You're tremendously
pretty when you've had plenty of sleep."</p>

<p>They both laughed; then she went indoors and he turned away across
the road, under the windows of the ward where Ailsa was on duty,
and so around to his store-room dwelling-place, where he sat down
on the cot amid the piles of boxes and drew from his pocket the
crumpled sheets of the letter that Ailsa had given him.</p>

<p>The handwriting seemed vaguely familiar to him; he glanced curiously
down the page; his eyes became riveted; he reddened to the roots
of his hair; then he deliberately began at the beginning, reading
very carefully.</p>

<p>The letter had been written several weeks ago; it was dated,
and signed with Hallam's name:</p>

<p>"MY <em>DEAR MRS. PAIGE</em>:</p>

<p>"Only my solemn sense of duty to all pure womanhood enables me
to indite these lines to you; and, by so doing, to invite, nay,
to encourage a cruel misunderstanding of my sincerest motives.</p>

<p>"But my letter is not dictated by malice or inspired by the natural
chagrin which animates a man of spirit when he reflects upon the
undeserved humiliation which he has endured from her who was once
dearer to him than life itself.  Mine is a nature susceptible
and sensitive, yet, I natter myself, incapable of harbouring sentiments
unworthy of a gentleman and a soldier.</p>

<p>"To forgive, to condone, is always commendable in man; but, madam,
there is a higher duty men owe to womanhood&mdash;to chaste and trusting
womanhood, incapable of defending itself from the wiles and schemes
which ever are waiting to ensnare it.</p>

<p>"It is for this reason, and for this reason alone, that, my suspicions
fully aroused, I have been at some pains to verify them. A heart
conscious of its moral rectitude does not flinch from the duty
before it or from the pain which, unfortunately, the execution
of that duty so often inflicts upon the innocent.</p>

<p>"Believe me, dear Mrs. Paige, it is a sad task that lies before
me. Woman is frail and weak by nature.  Man's noblest aspiration
can attain no loftier consummation than in the protection of a
pure woman against contamination.</p>

<p>"Mine becomes the unhappy mission of unmasking two unworthy people
whom you, in your innocence and trust, have cherished close to
your heart.  I speak of the trooper Ormond&mdash;whose name I believe
you know is Philip Berkley&mdash;and, if you now hear it for the first
time, it is proof additional of his deceit and perfidy.</p>

<p>"The other is Miss Lynden, known, in a certain immoral resort
called the Canterbury, as Letty Lynden, or 'Daisy' Lynden.</p>

<p>"She was a dancer in the Canterbury Music Hall.  I enclose photographs
of her in costume, also receipts from her landlady, washing lists,
her contract with the Canterbury, all in her own handwriting,
and all gathered for me at my request by a New York detective,
and forwarded to me here.  Among these papers you will find several
notes written to her in the spring and summer of 1861 by the trooper
Berkley and discovered in her room by her landlady after her departure. 
A perusal of them is sufficient to leave no doubt concerning the
character of this young woman&mdash;who, apparently, neglected by the
fellow, Berkley, pleaded piteously with him for an interview,
and was, as you see, cynically rebuffed.</p>

<p>"I enclose, also, an affidavit made by Miss Lynden's landlady
that she, Letty, or 'Daisy' Lynden, was commonly understood to
be the mistress of Berkley; that he took her from the Canterbury
and from her lodgings, paid her board bills, and installed her
in rooms at the enclosed address, where she remained until she
found employment with a Doctor Benton.</p>

<p>"What her relations were with him I do not pretend to know. 
It is evident, however, that they continue, as he writes to her. 
It will also be apparent to you that she has not scrupled to continue
her relations with the man Berkley.</p>

<p>"I will now further prove to you the truth of my assertion concerning
this degrading and demoralising condition of affairs.</p>

<p>"It came to my knowledge that a certain Arthur Wye, serving in
the volunteer artillery, and a certain subaltern in a zouave regiment,
were not only intimates of the trooper Berkley, but had also been
on dubious terms with the Lynden girl.</p>

<p>"Therefore, in company with an agent of the United States Secret
Service detailed for the duty by Surgeon-General Hammond at my
request, I held a private examination of these two men, and, with
some adroitness, succeeded in making them identify the photographs
of the Lynden girl, and later, unobserved by her, attempted to
make them identify her as she was sitting outside the field hospital.
But this they refused to do.</p>

<p>"However, that evidence was not necessary.  Among her effects,
scraps of letters in the waste-basket, etc., which she had imprudently
left at her lodgings, were discovered fragments which, when pasted
together, showed conclusively that she was on speaking terms at
least with the artilleryman, Wye.</p>

<p>"This evidence I deem it my duty to lay before you.  As a sensitive
and chaste woman, gently born, the condition of affairs will horrify
you.  But the knowledge of them will also enable you to take measures
for self-protection, and to clearly understand the measure which
I shall now take to rid the Sanitary Service of this abandoned
woman, who, as your friend and intimate associate, conceals her
true character under the garb of Sainte Ursula, and who continues
her intrigues with the trooper Berkley under the very roof that
shelters you.</p>

<p>"I am, madam, with sincere pain and deepest sympathy and respect,</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Obediently your humble servant,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"<em>EUGENE HALLAM,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"</em>Capt. 8th N. Y. Cav."

</p>
</div>
<p>He laid the letter and the enclosed papers on the bunk beside
him, and sat there thinking.</p>

<p>He knew that the evidence before him had been sufficient to drive
Letty from the Sanitary Service.  Why had she not been driven? 
The evidence and the letter were weeks old now.  What had prevented
their use?  And now Hallam was a fugitive&mdash;a deserter in the face
of the enemy.  It was too late for him to work more mischief if
he would.  But why had he held his hand against Letty?</p>

<p>Sunset found him still sitting there, thinking.  The old negro
came shuffling in, bringing hot hoe-cake and bacon for his dinner. 
He ate obediently; later he submitted to the razor and clothes
brush, absently pondering the problem that obsessed him: "Why
had Hallam spared Letty; how could he convey the truth to Ailsa
Paige?"</p>

<p>At dusk he reported to the ward-master; but Colonel Arran was
asleep, and there were no orders for him.</p>

<p>Then, slowly, he went into the adjoining ward.  Ailsa was off
duty, lying down in her room.  His message asking a moment's interview
was refused.</p>

<p>So he turned away again, head bent, and wandered over to his
store-room quarters, pondering the problem before him.</p>
