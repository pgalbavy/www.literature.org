<p><em>YOUNG BRAINERD </em>had a mortal fear that the existence
of the steam man would be discovered by some outsider, when a
large crowd would probably collect around his house, and his friends
would insist on a display of the powers of the extraordinary mechanism.</p>

<p>But there was no one in the secret except his mother, and there
was no danger of her revealing it. So the boy experimented with
his invention until there was nothing more left for him to do,
except to sit and watch its workings.</p>

<p>Finally, when he began to wonder at the prolonged delay of the
trapper, who had visited him some weeks before, he made his appearance
as suddenly as if he had risen from the ground, with the inquiry:</p>

<p>'Have you got that thundering old thing ready?'</p>

<p>'Yes: he has been ready for a week, and waiting.'</p>

<p>'Wal, start her out then, fur I'm in a hurry.'</p>

<p>'You will have to wait awhile, for we can't get ready under half
a day.'</p>

<p>It was the hunter's supposition that the boy was going to start
the man right off up street, and then toward the West; but he
speedily revealed a far different plan.</p>

<p>It was to box up the man and take it to Independence by steamboat.
At that place they would take it out upon the prairie, set it
up and start it off, without any fear of disturbance from the
crowds which usually collect at such places, as they could speedily
run away from them.</p>

<p>When the plan was explained to Baldy, he fully indorsed it, and
the labor was begun at once. The legs of the steam man being doubled
up, they were able to get it in a box, which gave it the appearance
of an immense piano under transportation. This, with considerable
difficulty, was transported to the wharf, where, with much grumbling
upon the part of the men, it was placed on board the steamboat,
quickly followed by the wagon and the few necessary tools.</p>

<p>The boy then bade his mother good-by, and she, suspecting he
would be gone but a short time, said farewell to him, with little
of the regret she would otherwise have felt, and a few hours later
the party were steaming rapidly up the 'Mad Missouri.'</p>

<p>Nothing worthy of notice occurred on the passage, and they reached
Independence in safety. They secured a landing somewhat above
the town, on the western side, where they had little fear of disturbance.</p>

<p>Here the extraordinary foresight and skill of the boy was manifest,
for, despite the immense size of the steam man, it was so put
together that they were able to load it upon the wagon, and the
two, without any other assistance, were able to drag it out upon
the prairie.</p>

<p>'You see, it may break down entirely,' remarked young Brainerd,
'and then we can load it on the wagon and drag it along.'</p>

<p>'That must be a powerful strong wagon to carry such a big baby
in if, as that.'</p>

<p>'So it is; it will hold five times the weight without being hurt
in the least.'</p>

<p>It was early in the forenoon when they drew It out upon the prairie
in this manner, and began putting it together. It certainly had
a grotesque and fearful look when it was stripped of all its bandages,
and stood before them in all its naked majesty.</p>

<p>It had been so securely and carefully put away, that it was found
uninjured in the least. The trapper could not avoid laughing when
the boy clambered as nimbly up its shoulder as another Gulliver,
and made a minute examination of every portion of the machinery.</p>

<p>While thus employed, Baldy took the shafts of the wagon, and
trotted to a farm-house, which he descried in the distance, where
he loaded it down with wood and filled the tank with water. By
the time he returned, Johnny had everything in readiness, and
they immediately began 'firing up.'</p>

<p>In this they bore quite a resemblance to the modern steam fire
engines, acquiring a head of steam with remarkable quickness.
As the boy had never yet given the man such an opportunity to
stretch his legs as he was now about to do, he watched its motions
with considerable anxiety.</p>

<p>Everything was secured in the most careful manner, a goodly quantity
of fuel piled on, the boiler filled with water, and they patiently
waited the generation of a sufficient head of steam.</p>

<p>'Is it all good prairie land in that direction?' inquired the
boy, pointing to the West.</p>

<p>'Thar's all yer kin want.'</p>

<p>'Then we'll start. Look out!'</p>

<p>Despite the warning thus kindly given, the steam man started
with a sudden jerk, that both of them came near being thrown out
of the wagon.</p>

<p>The prairie was quite level and hard, so that everything was
favorable, and the wagon went bounding over the ground at a rate
so fast that both the occupants were considerably frightened,
and the boy quickly brought it down to a more moderate trot.</p>

<p>This speed soon became monotonous, and as it ran so evenly, Baldy
said:</p>

<p>'Let her go, younker, and show us what she can do.'</p>

<p>The rod controlling the valve was given a slight pull, and away
they went, coursing like a locomotive over the prairies, the wheels
spinning round at a tremendous rate, while the extraordinary speed
caused the wind thus created almost to lift the caps from their
heads, and a slight swell in the prairie sent the wagon up with
a bound that threatened to unseat them both.</p>

<p>It worked splendidly. The black smoke puffed rapidly from the
top of the hat, and the machinery worked so smoothly that there
was scarcely a click heard. The huge spiked feet came lightly
to the ground, and were lifted but a short distance from it, and
their long sweep and rapid movement showed unmistakably that the
steam man was going at a pace which might well defy anything that
had yet swept the prairies.</p>

<p>As there was no little risk in running at this speed, and as
young Brainerd had not yet become accustomed to controlling it,
he slackened the rate again, so that it sank to an easy gliding
motion, equal to the rapid trot of an ordinary horse.</p>

<p>Fully ten minutes were passed in this manner, when steam was
entirely shut off, whereupon the giant came to such a sudden halt
that both were thrown violently forward and bruised somewhat.</p>

<p>'Skulp me! but don't stop quite so sudden like,' said the hunter.
'It's a little unhandy fur me to hold up so quick!'</p>

<p>'I'll soon learn to manage it,' replied Johnny. 'I see it won't
do to shut off all at once.'</p>

<p>Descending from his perch, he examined every portion of the engine.
Several parts were found heated, and the fuel was getting low.
The water in the boiler, however, was just right, the engineer
having been able to control that from his seat in the wagon.</p>

<p>Throwing in a lot of wood, they remounted to their perch and
started forward again. There was an abundance of steam, and the
boy readily acquired such a familiarity with the working of his
man, that he controlled it with all the skill of an experienced
engineer.</p>

<p>The speed was slackened, then increased. It stopped and then
started forward again with all the ease and celerity that it could
have done if really human, while it showed a reserve of power
and velocity capable of performing wonders, if necessary.</p>

<p>As yet they had seen nothing of any travelers. They were quite
anxious to come across some, that they might show them what they
were capable of doing.</p>

<p>'There must be some passing over the plains,' remarked Johnny,
when they had passed some thirty or forty miles.</p>

<p>'Plenty of 'em; but we've got out of the track of 'em. If you'll
turn off summat to the left, we'll run foul of 'em afore dark.'</p>

<p>The boy did as directed, and the rattling pace was kept up for
several hours. When it was noon they helped themselves to a portion
of the food which they brought with them, without checking their
progress in the least. True, while the boy was eating, he kept
one eye on the giant who was going at such rapid strides; but
that gentleman continued his progress in an unexceptionable manner,
and needed no attention.</p>

<p>When the afternoon was mostly gone, Baldy declared that they
had gone the better part of a hundred miles.</p>

<p>The boy could hardly credit it at first; but, when he recalled
that they had scarcely paused for seven hours, and had gone a
portion of the distance at a very high rate, he saw that his friend
was not far out of the way.</p>

<p>It lacked yet several hours of dusk, when the trapper exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Yonder is an emigrant train, now make for 'em!' </p>
