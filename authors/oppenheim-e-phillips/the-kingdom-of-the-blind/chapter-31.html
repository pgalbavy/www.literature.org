<P>
Ambrose announced a visitor, early on the following morning, with some show of
interest.
<P>
"Captain Granet to see you, sir.  We've a good many notes about him.  Would
you like the book?"
<P>
Thomson shook his head.
<P>
"Thank you," he answered drily, "I have it in my desk but I think I can
remember.  Is he outside now?"
<P>
"Yes, sir!  He said he wouldn't keep you for more than a few minutes, if you
could spare him a short interview."
<P>
"Any luck last night?"
<P>
Ambrose sighed.
<P>
"I was up till three o'clock again.  Once I thought I was on the track of it. 
I have come to the conclusion now that it's one of those codes that depend
upon shifting quantities.  I shall start again to-night on a different idea. 
Shall I show Captain Granet in, sir?"
<P>
Thomson assented, and a few minutes later Granet entered the room.  He made no
attempt to shake hands or to take a seat.  Thomson looked at him coldly.
<P>
"Well," he asked, abruptly, "what can I do for you?"
<P>
"I don't suppose you can do anything," Granet replied, "but I am going to
spend to-day and to-morrow, too, if necessary, in this place, bothering every
one I ever heard of.  You have some influence, I know.  Get me a job out of
this country."
<P>
Thomson raised his eyebrows slightly.
<P>
"You want to go abroad again?"
<P>
"Anywhere--anyhow!  If they won't have me back in France, although heaven
knows why not, can I be sent to the Dardanelles, or even East Africa?  I'll
take out Territorials, if you like.  I'll do anything sooner than be ordered
to one of these infernal country towns to train young tradespeople.  If I
don't worry, I know I shall get a home appointment directly, and I don't want
it."
<P>
Thomson studied his visitor, for a moment, carefully.
<P>
"So you want to be fighting again, eh?" he remarked.
<P>
"I do," Granet answered firmly.
<P>
Major Thomson drew a little locked book towards him, unfastened it with a key
from his chain and held his hand over the page.  It was noticeable that his
right hand slipped open a few inches the right-hand drawer of his desk.
<P>
"You have come to me, Captain Granet," he said, "to ask my aid in getting you
a job.  Well, if I could give you one where I was perfectly certain that you
would be shot in your first skirmish, I would give it to you, with pleasure. 
Under present conditions, however, it is my impression that the further you
are from any British fighting force, the better it will be fore the safety and
welfare of that force."
<P>
Granet's face was suddenly rigid.  He had turned a little paler and his eyes
flashed.
<P>
"What do you mean?" he demanded.
<P>
Thomson had removed his hand and was glancing at the open page.
<P>
"There are a few notes here about you," he said.  "I will not read them all
but I will give you some extracts.  There is your full name and parentage,
tracing out the amount of foreign blood which I find is in your veins.  There
is a verbatim account of a report made to me by your Brigadier-General, in
which it seems that in the fighting under his command you were three times
apparently taken prisoner, three times you apparently escaped; the information
which you brought back led to at least two disasters; the information which
exactly at the time you were absent seemed to come miraculously into the hands
of the enemy, resulted in even greater trouble for us."
<P>
"Do you insinuate, then, that I am a traitor?" Granet asked fiercely.
<P>
"I insinuate nothing," Thomson replied quietly.  "So far as you and I are
concerned, we may as well, I presume, understand one another.  You are,
without doubt, aware that my post as inspector of hospitals is a blind.  I am,
as a matter of fact, chief of the Intelligence Department, with a rank which
at present I do not choose to use.  I have been myself to your
Brigadier-General and bought home this report, and if it is any satisfaction
to you to know it, I brought also an urgent request that you should not be
allowed to rejoin any part of the force under his control."
<P>
"It was simply rotten luck," Granet muttered.
<P>
"I come here to a few more notes," Thomson proceeded.  "I meet you some weeks
ago at a luncheon party at the Ritz.  A Belgian waiter, who I learned, by
later inquiries was present as a prisoner in the village where you were being
entertained as a guest at the German headquarters, recognised you and was on
the point of making a disclosure.  The excitement, however, was too much for
him and he fainted.  He was at once removed, under your auspices, and died a
few days later, at one of your uncle's country houses, before he could make
any statement."
<P>
"This is ridiculous!" Granet exclaimed.  "I never saw the fellow before in my
life."
<P>
"Ridiculous, doubtless, but a coincidence," Major Thomson replied, turning
over the next page of his book.  "A little later I find you taking an immense
interest in our new destroyers, trying, in fact, to induce young Conyers to
explain our wire netting system, following him down to Portsmouth and doing
your best to discover also the meaning of a new device attached to his
destroyer."
<P>
"That is simply absurd," Granet protested.  "I was interested in the subject,
as any military officer would be in an important naval development.  My
journey to Portsmouth was simply an act of courtesy to Miss Conyers and her
cousin."
<P>
"I find you next," Thomson went on immovably, "visiting the one French
statesmen whom we in England had cause to fear, in his hotel in London.  I
find that very soon afterwards that statesman is in possession of an autograph
letter from the Kaiser, offering peace to the French people on extraordinary
terms.  Who was the intermediary who brought that document, Captain Granet?"
<P>
Granet's face never twitched.  He held himself with cold composure.
<P>
"These," he declared, "are fairy tales.  Pailleton was a friend of mine. 
During my visit we did not speak of politics.
<P>
"More coincidences," Major Thomson remarked.  "We pass on, then, to that night
at Market Burnham Hall, when a Zeppelin was guided to the spot where Sir
Meyville Worth was experimenting on behalf of the British Government, and
dropped destructive bombs.  A man was shot dead by the side of the flare. 
That man was one of your companions at the Dormy House Club."
<P>
"I neither spoke to him nor saw him there, except as a casual visitor," Granet
insisted.
<P>
"That I venture to doubt," Major Thomson replied.  "At any rate, there is
enough circumstantial evidence against you in this book to warrant my taking
the keenest interest in your future.  As a matter of fact, you would have been
at the Tower, or underneath it, at this very moment, but for the young lady
who probably perjured herself to save you.  Now that you know my opinion of
you, Captain Granet, you will understand that I should hesitate before
recommending you to any post whatever in the service of this country."
<P>
Granet made a stealthy movement forward.  He had been edging a little closer
to the desk and he was barely two yards away.  He suddenly paused.  Thomson
had closed the drawer now and he was holding a small revolver very steadily in
his right hand.
<P>
"Granet," he said, "that sort of thing won't do.  You know now what I think of
you.  Besides these little incidents which I have related, you are suspected
of having, in the disguise of an American clergyman, delivered a message from
the German Government to an English Cabinet Minister, and, to come to more
personal matters, I myself suspect you of having made two attempts on my life. 
It is my firm belief that you are nothing more nor less than a common and
dangerous German spy.  Keep back!"
<P>
The veins were standing out like whipcord on Granet's flushed forehead.  He
swayed on his feet.  Twice he had seemed as though he would spring at his
opponent.
<P>
"Now listen to me," Thomson continued.  "On Monday I am going from Southampton
to Boulogne for forty-eight hours, to attend a court martial there.  There is
only one decent thing you can do.  You know what that is.  I'll have you
exchanged, if you are willing, into a line regiment with your present rank. 
Your colonel will have a hint.  It will be your duty to meet the first German
bullet you can find.  If you are content with that, I'll arrange it for you. 
If not--"
<P>
Major Thomson paused.  There was a queer twisted smile at the corners of his
lips.
<P>
"If not," he concluded, "there is one more little note to add in this book and
the account will be full.  You know now the terms, Captain Granet, on which
you can go to the Front.  I will give you ten days to consider."
<P>
"If I accept an offer like this," Granet protested, "I shall be pleading
guilty to all the rubbish you have talked."
<P>
"If it weren't for the fact," Major Thomson told him sternly, "that you have
worn his Majesty's uniform, that you are a soldier, and that the horror of it
would bring pain to every man who has shared with you that privilege, I have
quite enough evidence here to bring your career to a disgraceful end.  I give
you your chance, not for your own sake but for the honour of the Army.  What
do you say?"
<P>
Granet picked up his hat.
<P>
"I'll think it over," he muttered.
<P>
He walked out of the room without any attempt at farewell, pushed his way
along the corridors, down the steps and out into Whitehall.  His face was
distorted by a new expression.  A sudden hatred of Thomson had blazed up in
him.  He was at bay, driven there by a relentless enemy, the man who had
tracked him down, as he honestly believed, to some extent through jealousy. 
The thoughts framed themselves quickly in his mind.  With unseeing eyes he
walked across Trafalgar Square and made his way to his club in Pall Mall. 
Here he wrote a few lines to Isabel Worth, regretting that he was called out
of town on military business for forty-eight hours.  Afterwards he took a taxi
and called at his rooms, walked restlessly up and down while Jarvis threw a
few clothes into a bag, changed his own apparel for a rough tweed suit, and
drove to Paddington.  A few minutes later he took his place in the Cornish
Express.
