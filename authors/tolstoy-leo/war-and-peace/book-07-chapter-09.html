<p>Christmas came and except for the ceremonial Mass, the solemn and
wearisome Christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants, and
the new dresses everyone put on, there were no special festivities,
though the calm frost of twenty degrees Reaumur, the dazzling sunshine
by day, and the starlight of the winter nights seemed to call for some
special celebration of the season.</p>

<p>On the third day of Christmas week, after the midday dinner, all the
inmates of the house dispersed to various rooms. It was the dullest
time of the day. Nicholas, who had been visiting some neighbors that
morning, was asleep on the sitting-room sofa. The old count was
resting in his study. Sonya sat in the drawing room at the round
table, copying a design for embroidery. The countess was playing
patience. Nastasya Ivanovna the buffoon sat with a sad face at the
window with two old ladies. Natasha came into the room, went up to
Sonya, glanced at what she was doing, and then went up to her mother
and stood without speaking.</p>

<p>&quot;Why are you wandering about like an outcast?&quot; asked her mother.
&quot;What do you want?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Him... I want him... now, this minute! I want him!&quot; said Natasha,
with glittering eyes and no sign of a smile.</p>

<p>The countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't look at me, Mamma! Don't look; I shall cry directly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sit down with me a little,&quot; said the countess.</p>

<p>&quot;Mamma, I want him. Why should I be wasted like this, Mamma?&quot;</p>

<p>Her voice broke, tears gushed from her eyes, and she turned
quickly to hide them and left the room.</p>

<p>She passed into the sitting room, stood there thinking awhile, and
then went into the maids' room. There an old maidservant was grumbling
at a young girl who stood panting, having just run in through the cold
from the serfs' quarters.</p>

<p>&quot;Stop playing- there's a time for everything,&quot; said the old woman.</p>

<p>&quot;Let her alone, Kondratevna,&quot; said Natasha. &quot;Go, Mavrushka, go.&quot;</p>

<p>Having released Mavrushka, Natasha crossed the dancing hall and went
to the vestibule. There an old footman and two young ones were playing
cards. They broke off and rose as she entered.</p>

<p>&quot;What can I do with them?&quot; thought Natasha.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Nikita, please go... where can I send him?... Yes, go to the
yard and fetch a fowl, please, a cock, and you, Misha, bring me some
oats.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just a few oats?&quot; said Misha, cheerfully and readily.</p>

<p>&quot;Go, go quickly,&quot; the old man urged him.</p>

<p>&quot;And you, Theodore, get me a piece of chalk.&quot;</p>

<p>On her way past the butler's pantry she told them to set a
samovar, though it was not at all the time for tea.</p>

<p>Foka, the butler, was the most ill-tempered person in the house.
Natasha liked to test her power over him. He distrusted the order
and asked whether the samovar was really wanted.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh dear, what a young lady!&quot; said Foka, pretending to frown at
Natasha.</p>

<p>No one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble
as Natasha did. She could not see people unconcernedly, but had to
send them on some errand. She seemed to be trying whether any of
them would get angry or sulky with her; but the serfs fulfilled no
one's orders so readily as they did hers. &quot;What can I do, where can
I go?&quot; thought she, as she went slowly along the passage.</p>

<p>&quot;Nastasya Ivanovna, what sort of children shall I have?&quot; she asked
the buffoon, who was coming toward her in a woman's jacket.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, fleas, crickets, grasshoppers,&quot; answered the buffoon.</p>

<p>&quot;O Lord, O Lord, it's always the same! Oh, where am I to go? What am
I to do with myself?&quot; And tapping with her heels, she ran quickly
upstairs to see Vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story.</p>

<p>Two governesses were sitting with the Vogels at a table, on which
were plates of raisins, walnuts, and almonds. The governesses were
discussing whether it was cheaper to live in Moscow or Odessa. Natasha
sat down, listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air,
and then got up again.</p>

<p>&quot;The island of Madagascar,&quot; she said, &quot;Ma-da-gas-car,&quot; she repeated,
articulating each syllable distinctly, and, not replying to Madame
Schoss who asked her what she was saying, she went out of the room.</p>

<p>Her brother Petya was upstairs too; with the man in attendance on
him he was preparing fireworks to let off that night.</p>

<p>&quot;Petya! Petya!&quot; she called to him. &quot;Carry me downstairs.&quot;</p>

<p>Petya ran up and offered her his back. She jumped on it, putting her
arms round his neck, and he pranced along with her.</p>

<p>&quot;No, don't... the island of Madagascar!&quot; she said, and jumping off
his back she went downstairs.</p>

<p>Having as it were reviewed her kingdom, tested her power, and made
sure that everyone was submissive, but that all the same it was
dull, Natasha betook herself to the ballroom, picked up her guitar,
sat down in a dark corner behind a bookcase, and began to run her
fingers over the strings in the bass, picking out a passage she
recalled from an opera she had heard in Petersburg with Prince Andrew.
What she drew from the guitar would have had no meaning for other
listeners, but in her imagination a whole series of reminiscences
arose from those sounds. She sat behind the bookcase with her eyes
fixed on a streak of light escaping from the pantry door and
listened to herself and pondered. She was in a mood for brooding on
the past.</p>

<p>Sonya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand. Natasha glanced
at her and at the crack in the pantry door, and it seemed to her
that she remembered the light failing through that crack once before
and Sonya passing with a glass in her hand. &quot;Yes it was exactly the
same,&quot; thought Natasha.</p>

<p>&quot;Sonya, what is this?&quot; she cried, twanging a thick string.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you are there!&quot; said Sonya with a start, and came near and
listened. &quot;I don't know. A storm?&quot; she ventured timidly, afraid of
being wrong.</p>

<p>&quot;There! That's just how she started and just how she came up smiling
timidly when all this happened before,&quot; thought Natasha, &quot;and in
just the same way I thought there was something lacking in her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's the chorus from The Water-Carrier, listen! &quot; and Natasha
sang the air of the chorus so that Sonya should catch it. &quot;Where
were you going?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;To change the water in this glass. I am just finishing the design.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You always find something to do, but I can't,&quot; said Natasha. &quot;And
where's Nicholas?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Asleep, I think.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sonya, go and wake him,&quot; said Natasha. &quot;Tell him I want him to come
and sing.&quot;</p>

<p>She sat awhile, wondering what the meaning of it all having happened
before could be, and without solving this problem, or at all
regretting not having done so, she again passed in fancy to the time
when she was with him and he was looking at her with a lover's eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, if only he would come quicker! I am so afraid it will never be!
And, worst of all, I am growing old- that's the thing! There won't
then be in me what there is now. But perhaps he'll come today, will
come immediately. Perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing
room. Perhaps he came yesterday and I have forgotten it.&quot; She rose,
put down the guitar, and went to the drawing room.</p>

<p>All the domestic circle, tutors, governesses, and guests, were
already at the tea table. The servants stood round the table- but
Prince Andrew was not there and life was going on as before.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, here she is!&quot; said the old count, when he saw Natasha enter.
&quot;Well, sit down by me.&quot; But Natasha stayed by her mother and glanced
round as if looking for something.</p>

<p>&quot;Mamma!&quot; she muttered, &quot;give him to me, give him, Mamma, quickly,
quickly!&quot; and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs.</p>

<p>She sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between
the elders and Nicholas, who had also come to the table. &quot;My God, my
God! The same faces, the same talk, Papa holding his cup and blowing
in the same way!&quot; thought Natasha, feeling with horror a sense of
repulsion rising up in her for the whole household, because they
were always the same.</p>

<p>After tea, Nicholas, Sonya, and Natasha went to the sitting room, to
their favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began.</p>
