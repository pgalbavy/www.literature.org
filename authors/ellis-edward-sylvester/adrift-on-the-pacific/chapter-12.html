<p>As Captain Bergen descended the rigging to the deck of the schooner
he was greatly depressed, for the conviction was strong upon him
that in entering this promised land&mdash;as he had sometimes termed
the little circle of coral and earth which he had named Pearl
Island&mdash;he would never leave it. The immense wealth which lay
hidden along its coast, awaiting the coming of some one to gather
it, would never be carried away by those who had already come
more than half-way round the globe to garner it.</p>

<p>As the captain stepped upon deck, Redvignez and Brazzier respectfully
saluted him, and looked as if they were the most loyal of sailors.</p>

<p>Captain Bergen forced himself to respond to their salute, and
then he walked quietly over to where Abe stood at the wheel.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you make of it?" asked the mate, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"It's the island!" replied Bergen.</p>

<p>"Are you sure of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; there can be no doubt. I made out the landmark that Grebbens
told me would identify it beyond all question. That's the mast
which they erected on the shore, close to the inlet. You can see
it without the glass," added the captain, turning about and looking
in that direction.</p>

<p>Such was the case, and Storms observed it plainly.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, captain?" asked the mate, bringing his gaze
back to the face of his friend, and scrutinizing him keenly. "You
look pale and agitated. Have your nerves given out after this
strain?"</p>

<p>"Abe," said the captain, in a carefully-guarded voice, and glancing
over his shoulder, "I learned, a few minutes ago, that those two
men forward intend to mutiny and run away with the pearls."</p>

<p>"Is that all? Why, I knew that weeks ago!"</p>

<p>"You did?" demanded the astounded captain. "Why, then, didn't
you tell me?"</p>

<p>"I thought it was better to wait till we reached the island,
by which time their plans were likely to be more fully developed."</p>

<p>"That sort of reasoning I don't understand," said the captain,
anything but pleased with his mate. "But never mind about it now.
Tell me what you have learned."</p>

<p>"Not a great deal more than you have told. Those two men, I am
satisfied, are old acquaintances, who have been partners in more
than one crime, though we supposed them strangers at the time
we shipped them; and I have no doubt they began planning our deaths
from the day we sailed out of San Francisco harbor."</p>

<p>"What about Pomp?"</p>

<p>"They had a hard time, but they have won him over, and he is
pledged to go with them."</p>

<p>"And you have tried to gain the good will of Pomp?"</p>

<p>"I have done my utmost, and have treated him with unusual leniency,
making him many presents, some of which I gave him to understand
came from you. But they've got him, for all that. There's our
greatest safeguard."</p>

<p>As the mate spoke, he pointed to Inez, who, at that moment, came
bounding up the steps of the cabin and ran laughing forward.</p>

<p>"Pomp thinks all the world of her, and she will be the peacemaker,
perhaps."</p>

<p>"But don't they like her as well?"</p>

<p>"No; they wouldn't hesitate any more over killing her than they
would in killing us."</p>

<p>"The villains!" muttered the horrified captain. "I never conceived
it possible that any human being could fail to love such beauty
and innocence as hers."</p>

<p>"There is no immediate danger," said the mate, somewhat surprised
to observe how completely the discovery had taken possession of
the mind of the captain. "Let's give our attention now to the
business upon which we came, and there will be time enough to
think of the other matter between now and nightfall."</p>

<p>Captain Bergen was sorely perplexed, but the circumstances were
such that he was able to follow the suggestion of his faithful
mate. They were now close to the island, which was of that singular
formation so frequently seen in the Pacific. Countless millions
of tiny insects, toiling through many years, had gradually lifted
the foundations of coral from the depths of the ocean, until the
mass, in the form of a gigantic ring or horse-shoe, was above
the surface. Upon this had gradually gathered sand, seeds and
vegetable matter, in the usual way, until beneath the tropical
sun and the balmy climate the "desert blossomed like the rose."
This took a long while, but the process it went through was similar
to that of hundreds of much larger islands which to-day rest like
nosegays upon the bosom of the vast Pacific.</p>

<p>Among these fruits were the banana, plantain, breadfruit, and
a sort of mango, found in Farther India, and which, at first disliked,
becomes in time a great favorite with every one. Most singular
of all was the fact that at two widely-separated points burst
forth a spring of clear, fresh water.</p>

<p>One might well wonder where the supply for this came from, since
the whole island had its foundation in salt water&mdash;but there are
many strange distillations going on at all times in nature's laboratory
beyond the power of man to fathom.</p>

<p>These were probably stored away in some of the hidden vaults
of the island, and bubbled forth, the fountain being renewed before
the precious contents were exhausted.</p>

<p>The entrance to the interior was through a deep passage, toward
which Mr. Storms directed the vessel. As the <em>Coral</em> glided
into this "inland sea," Captain Bergen took the helm, being as
familiar with the contour of the atoll as if he had spent a dozen
years upon it. He knew where the best anchorage was to be found,
and he headed over toward the eastern shore, where it was safe
to run close enough in to spring from the deck to the land. He
was a good seaman, and he brought his craft to with as much skill
as a stage-driver brings his team to a halt before the door of
an inn. The anchor was let go at the proper moment, and the <em>Coral</em>
slowly swung at her mooring in the very position her master desired,
both bow and stern being so close to shore that there would be
no occasion to use the small boat which is generally called into
requisition on such occasions.</p>

<p>The scenery and situation were peculiar and novel in the highest
degree. These atolls are the natural harbors of the ocean, and
if any vessel can run through the openings into the calm waters
within, she may ride in safety from the severest tempest.</p>

<p>The water within the lagoon was as calm as the surface of a mill-pond.
On every hand rose the trees and vegetation so dense that the
only portion where a glimpse of the ocean could be caught was
at the entrance, which, it would seem, the builders of the island
had left on purpose for the ingress and exit of endangered shipping.</p>

<p>Despite the alarming discovery which Captain Bergen had made
but a short time previous, he carried out the purpose formed weeks
before, and which the mate urged him to fulfil. The schooner having
been secured in position and everything put in ship-shape order,
he addressed the three men who composed the crew:</p>

<p>"My friends, when I engaged you to go upon this voyage, I did
not tell you whither, and you may think it is late in the day
to give you such information, now that we have reached our destination.
Some time ago, before I sailed, I received information that a
bed of oysters existed at a certain portion of this island unusually
rich in pearls. It is to obtain them I have come, and now I wish
to say, what I determined to say from the first, that if you work
faithfully, and give me all the assistance you can, each of you
three shall receive enough to make you rich for life. In an enterprise
of this kind the business is a partnership, and you shall be liberally
treated, provided you prove worthy."</p>

<p>During the utterance of these words, both the captain and the
mate carefully watched the faces of the three men to see the effect
produced.</p>

<p>Had the African been alone he would have been won over, and as
it was he turned about in an inquiring way, and looked toward
the two men as if seeking to see how they took it. Their countenances
were so immobile that he gained no information from the looks
there; but both the officers did. Abe Storms, especially, was
a skilful physiognomist, and that which he saw convinced him that
the speech, coming as it did, was a mistake. As is frequently
the case, it was accepted as an evidence of timidity on the part
of the officers, and the conspirators were given a confidence
which otherwise would not have been theirs.</p>

<p>"It was a blunder," whispered Storms, when the captain stepped
beside him. "Those wretches mean mischief, and it is coming within
twenty-four hours."</p>
