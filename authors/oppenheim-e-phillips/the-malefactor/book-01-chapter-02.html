<P>
Three men were together in a large and handsomely furnished sitting room of
the Clarence Hotel, in Piccadilly. One, pale, quiet, and unobtrusive, dressed
in sober black, the typical lawyer's clerk, was busy gathering up a collection
of papers and documents from the table, over which they had been strewn. His
employer, who had more the appearance of a country gentleman than the junior
partner in the well-known firm of Rocke and Son, solicitors, had risen to his
feet, and was drawing on his gloves. At the head of the table was the client.
<P>
"I trust, Sir Wingrave, that you are satisfied with this account of our
stewardship," the solicitor said, as his clerk left the room. "We have felt it
a great responsibility at times, but everything seems to have turned out very
well. The investments, of course, are all above suspicion."
<P>
"Perfectly satisfied, I thank you," was the quiet reply. "You seem to have
studied my interests in a very satisfactory manner."
<P>
Mr. Rocke had other things to say, but his client's manner seemed designed to
create a barrier of formality between them. He hesitated, unwilling to leave,
yet finding it exceedingly difficult to say the things which were in his mind.
He temporized by referring back to matters already discussed, solely for the
purpose of prolonging the interview.
<P>
"You have quite made up your mind, then, to put the Tredowen property on the
market," he remarked. "You will excuse my reminding you of the fact that you
have large accumulated funds in hand, and nearly a hundred thousand pounds
worth of easily realizable securities. Tredowen has been in your mother's
family for a good many years, and I should doubt whether it will be easily
disposed of."
<P>
The man at the head of the table raised his head. He looked steadily at the
lawyer, who began to wish that he had left the room with his clerk. Decidedly,
Sir Wingrave Seton was not an easy man to get on with.
<P>
"My mind is quite made up, thank you, on this and all other matters concerning
which I have given you instructions," was the calm reply. "I have had plenty
of time for consideration," he added drily.
<P>
The lawyer had his opening at last, and he plunged.
<P>
"Sir Wingrave," he said, "we were at college together, and our connection is
an old one. You must forgive me if I say how glad I am to see you here, and to
know that your bad time is over. I can assure you that you have had my deepest
sympathy. Nothing ever upset me so much as that unfortunate affair. I
sincerely trust that you will do your best now to make up for lost time. You
are still young, and you are rich. Let us leave business alone now, for the
moment. What can I do for you as a friend, if you will allow me to call you
so?"
<P>
Wingrave turned slightly in his chair. In his altered position, a ray of
sunshine fell for the first time upon his gaunt but striking face. Lined and
hardened, as though by exposure and want of personal care, there was also a
lack of sensibility, an almost animal callousness, on the coldly lit eyes and
unflinching mouth, which readily suggested some terrible and recent
experience--something potent enough to have dried up the human nature out of
the man and left him soulless. His clothes had the impress of the ready-made,
although he wore them with a distinction which was obviously inherent; and
notwithstanding the fact that he seemed to have been writing, he wore gloves.
<P>
"I am much obliged to you, Rocke," he said. "Let me repeat your question. What
is there that you can do for me?"
<P>
Mr. Rocke was apparently a little nonplussed. The absolute imperturbability of
the man who had once been his friend was disconcerting.
<P>
"Well," he said, "the governor sent me instead of coming himself, because he
thought that I might be more useful to you. London changes so quickly--you
would hardly know your way about now. I should like you to come and dine with
me tonight, and I'll take you round anywhere you care to go; and then if you
don't want to go back to your old tradespeople, I could take you to my tailor
and bookmaker."
<P>
"Is that all?" Wingrave asked calmly.
<P>
Rocke was again taken aback.
<P>
"Certainly not," he answered. "There must be many ways in which I could be
useful to you, but I can't think of them all at once. I am here to serve you
professionally or as a friend, to the best of my ability. Can you suggest
anything yourself? What do you want?"
<P>
"That is the question," Wingrave said, "which I have been asking myself.
Unfortunately, up to now, I have not been able to answer it. Regarding myself,
however, from the point of view of a third party, I should say that the thing
I was most in need of was the society of my fellow creatures."
<P>
"Exactly," Rocke declared. "That is what I thought you would say! It won't
take us long to arrange something of the sort for you."
<P>
"Can you put me up," Wingrave asked, "at your club, and introduce me to your
friends there?"
<P>
Rocke flinched before the steady gaze of those cold enquiring eyes, in which
he fancied, too, that a gleam of malice shone. The color mounted to his
cheeks. It was a most embarrassing situation.
<P>
"I can introduce you to some decent fellows, of course, and to some very
charming ladies," he said hesitatingly, "but as to the club--I--well, don't
you think yourself that it would scarcely be wise to--"
<P>
"Exactly," Wingrave interrupted. "And these ladies that you spoke of--"
<P>
"Oh! There's no difficulty about that," Rocke declared with an air of relief.
"I can make up a little dinner party for tonight, if you like. There's an
awfully smart American woman over here, with the Fanciful Fan Company--I'm
sure you'd like her, and she'd come like a shot. Then I'd get Daisy
Vane--she's all right. They don't know anything, and wouldn't care if they
did. Besides, you could call yourself what you liked."
<P>
"Thank you," Wingrave said. "I am afraid I did not make myself quite clear. I
was not thinking of play fellows. I was thinking of the men and women of my
own order. Shall I put the matter quite clearly? Can I take my place in
society under my own name, renew my old friendships and build up new ones? Can
I do this even at the risk of a few difficulties at first? I am not a
sensitive man. I am prepared for the usual number of disagreeable incidents.
But can I win my way through?"
<P>
With his back against the wall, Rocke displayed more courage. Besides, what
was the use of mincing matters with a man who had all the appearance of a
human automaton, who never flinched or changed color, and whose passions
seemed dried up and withered things?
<P>
"I am afraid not, Sir Wingrave," he said. "I should not recommend you to try,
at any rate for the present."
<P>
"Give me your reasons," was the cool response.
<P>
"I will do so with pleasure," Rocke answered. "About the time of the trial and
immediately afterwards, there was a certain amount of sympathy for you. People
felt that you must have received a good deal of provocation, and there were
several unexplained incidents which told in your favor. Today, I should think
that the feeling amongst those who remember the affair at all is rather the
other way. You heard, I believe, that Lady Ruth married Lumley Barrington?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"Barrington has been very successful at the Bar, and they say that he is
certain of a judgeship before long. His wife has backed him up well, they have
entertained lavishly, and today I should think that she is one of the most
popular hostesses in London. In her earlier days, I used to hear that she was
one of the very fast hunting set--that was the time when you knew her. I can
assure you that if ever that was true, she is a completely altered woman
today. She is patroness of half a dozen great charitable schemes, she writes
very clever articles in the Reviews on the Betterment of the Poor Question,
and royalty itself visits at her house."
<P>
"I see," Wingrave said drily. "I was not aware of these changes."
<P>
"If ever," Mr. Rocke continued, "people were inclined to look a little askance
at her, that has all gone by. Today she is one of the last women in the world
of whom people would be likely to believe ill."
<P>
Wingrave nodded slowly.
<P>
"I am very much obliged to you," he said, "for this information. You seem to
have come here today, Mr. Rocke, with good intentions towards me. Let me ask
you to put yourself in my place. I am barely forty years old, and I am rich. I
want to make the most of my life--under the somewhat peculiar circumstances.
How and where should you live?"
<P>
"It depends a little upon your tastes, of course," Rocke answered. "You are a
sportsman, are you not?"
<P>
"I am fond of sport," "Wingrave answered. "At least I was. At present I am not
conscious of having any positive tastes."
<P>
"I think," Rocke continued, "that I should first of all change my name. Then,
without making any effort to come into touch with your old friends, I should
seek acquaintance amongst the Bohemian world of London and Paris. There I
might myself, perhaps, be able to help you. For sport, you might fish in
Norway or Iceland, or shoot in Hungary; you could run to a yacht if you cared
about it, and if you fancy big game, why, there's all Africa before you."
<P>
Wingrave listened, without changing a muscle of his face.
<P>
"Your programme," he remarked, "presupposes that I have no ambitions beyond
the pursuit of pleasure."
<P>
Rocke shrugged his shoulders. He was becoming more at his ease. He felt that
his advice was sound, that he was showing a most comprehensive grasp of the
situation.
<P>
"I am afraid," he said, "that none of what we call the careers are open to
you. You could not enter Parliament, and you are too old for the professions.
The services, of course, are impossible. You might write, if your tastes ran
that way. Nowadays, it seems to be the fashion to record one's experiences in
print, if--if they should happen to be in any way exceptional. I can think of
nothing else!"
<P>
"I am very much obliged to you," Wingrave said. "Your suggestions are
eminently practical. I will think them over. Don't let me keep you any
longer!"
<P>
"About this evening," Rocke remarked. "Shall I fix up that little dinner
party? You have only to say the word!"
<P>
"I am very much obliged to you, but I think not," answered Wingrave. "I will
dine with you alone some evening, with pleasure! Not just as present!"
<P>
Rocke looked, as he felt, puzzled. He honestly wished to be of service to this
man, but he was at a loss to know what further suggestion he could make. There
was something impenetrable about his client, something which he could not
arrive at, behind the hard, grim face and measured words. He could not even
guess as to what the man's hopes or intentions were. Eventually, although with
some reluctance, he took up his hat.
<P>
"Well, Sir Wingrave," he said, "if there is really nothing I can do for you, I
will go. If you should change your mind, you have only to telephone. You can
command me at any time. I am only anxious to be of service to you."
<P>
"You have already been of service to me," Wingrave answered quietly. "You have
spoken the truth! You have helped me to realize my position more exactly. Will
you give your father my compliments and thanks, and say that I am entirely
satisfied with the firm's conduct of affairs during my--absence?"
<P>
Rocke nodded.
<P>
"Certainly," he said. "That will please the governor! I must be off now. I
hope you'll soon be feeling quite yourself again, Sir Wingrave! It must seem a
bit odd at first, I suppose, but it will wear off all right. What you want,
after all, is society. Much better let me arrange that little dinner for
tonight!"
<P>
Wingrave shook his head.
<P>
"Later on, perhaps," he answered. "Good morning!"
