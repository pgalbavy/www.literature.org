<p>The picture upon which Deerfoot looked recalled many similar
ones in Ohio and Kentucky. There were six warriors seated on the
ground, most of the party in lolling postures, three smoking long-stemmed
pipes, and all had evidently partaken of food a short time before,
for a faint odor of broiling venison or bison meat was in the
air, and the signs within the camp showed that a meal had been
prepared and eaten.</p>

<p>The burning sticks were piled against the base of a tree more
than two feet in diameter and were burning so vigorously that
the circle of light reached well beyond the group and pierced
the shadows among the pines and cedars. A brief survey of the
group left no doubt that they were awaiting the arrival of friends,
as they had been doing for hours past, and might continue to do
through the remaining night.</p>

<p>There was no reason why the Shawanoe should lose any time in
surveying the Assiniboines, for he felt no interest in them. He
was surprised to note that every one had a rifle, none being armed
with the primitive bow and arrows. He tarried only long enough
to decide in his mind who was the leader, and therefore the new
proprietor of Whirlwind. Deerfoot had no special enmity against
him, for it was Amokeat, the Nez Perce chieftain, who was responsible
for the loss of the stallion.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe had straightened up and was silently withdrawing
from his advanced position, holding the sheltering tree between
him and the camp fire, when he was startled by a whinny from some
point in the gloom close at hand. Turning his head he caught the
dim outlines of Whirlwind making his way among the trees toward
him. The sagacious stallion, through that wonderfully acute sense
of smell which his species often show, had discovered the proximity
of his master and had set out to find him. The space between the
two was so brief that Deerfoot had hardly paused and looked behind
him when the silken nose of Whirlwind was thrust against his face,
and after his old fashion he touched his tongue to the cool cheek
of his master and then affectionately rested his head on his shoulder.</p>

<p>It was a critical situation, for the steed had already warned
the Assiniboines that something unusual was going on, but the
delight and gratitude of the Shawanoe were so deep that he could
not deny himself the pleasure of caressing his steed. He touched
his lips to his nose, patted his forehead and neck and murmured:</p>

<p>"Whirlwind! Deerfoot's heart is thankful! He is happy, for he
has found his best friend. No one shall part us again!"</p>

<p>But in that joyful moment the delicate situation could not be
forgotten. Instead of leaping upon the back of the horse where
the trees and limbs would interfere with a rapid flight, in addition
to placing the rider at a disadvantage in case of attack, Deerfoot
told Whirlwind to pass out of the timber and wait for him. The
horse promptly obeyed, for he understood the whispered words.
Then the youth placed himself directly behind the horse, ready
to fight off any and all assailants, and followed the steed, thus
forming his rear guard.</p>

<p>Between Deerfoot and the camp fire loomed the form of an Assiniboine
warrior. His sensitive ear had heard the soft neigh, and even
the low voice of Deerfoot. He knew that a thief was in the grove&mdash;he
must have thought he was a Nez Perce&mdash;and was making off with
Whirlwind, who was held in higher esteem than all the other horses
together.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe saw that a fight was inevitable. He passed his rifle
to the right hand, over whose arm his blanket was resting, and
drew his hunting knife. Even in that crisis the chivalry of the
Shawanoe would not allow him to take full advantage of the situation.
He could have struck down his enemy without the least risk to
himself. He chose rather to give his antagonist warning.</p>

<p>"Dog of an Assiniboine!" he muttered in the Blackfoot tongue.
"The Shawanoe fears you not!"</p>

<p>The warrior leaped forward like a crouching tiger. He had caught
sight of the lithe form in the faint glow of the firelight, and
he assailed it with all the vicious vigor of his nature. The lightning-like
blow of his knife made a hissing sound as it cut the air and buried
its point in the blanket which Deerfoot thrust forward to receive
it. Then the Shawanoe delivered <em>his</em> blow. Enough said.</p>

<p>Brief as was the terrific encounter, it occurred too close to
camp for the other Assiniboines to remain in doubt for a moment.
Moreover, when the victim of the Shawanoe's prowess went down
not to rise again he uttered an ear-splitting screech which echoed
through the grove.</p>

<p>Deerfoot turned and ran among the trees after Whirlwind. From
some cause the stallion had changed his direction and was waiting
on the edge of the wood several rods from where his master emerged.
The latter glanced hastily around in the gloom without seeing
him. He uttered a low signal which the horse instantly obeyed,
and with another neigh of delight trotted to his master.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was about to vault upon his back, but hesitated. The
sounds indicated that the whole five Assiniboines had rushed to
the spot and were already within arm's reach of master and stallion.
They would be so near when Whirlwind made his dash that they would
fire a volley which was certain to kill one or the other, and
not unlikely both rider and animal.</p>

<p>Nor could anything be gained by turning at bay and fighting the
whole five, though the Shawanoe would not have hesitated to do
that had no other recourse been left to him. With that quick perception
which approached the marvelous in him he ordered Whirlwind to
gallop along the side of the timber and again wait for him. Then
Deerfoot dived among the trees as if in fear of the fierce warriors
closing in upon him. His aim was to draw the attention of the
party from the stallion to himself, and he succeeded.</p>

<p>For three or four minutes he dodged in and out, where in the
gloom he could not escape more than one collision with the limbs.
The whole party plunged after him. They knew that the audacious
stranger had slain one of their number and were determined he
should not escape their vengeance, for with him disposed of the
black stallion could be recovered at leisure.</p>

<p>All the time that Deerfoot was whisking here and there, leaping
to the right and left, and getting forward as fast as he could,
he held his knife grasped and ready to use on the instant the
emergency arose. He was so handicapped by the obstructions and
the darkness that he could do little more than hold his own. His
enemies were too near for him to hide himself from them. Had he
attempted to do so the whole lot would have descended upon him
like an avalanche.</p>

<p>There was no chance to select his route; all he could do was
to drive ahead and avoid being driven at bay. He took care not
to pass near the fire, where the glow would have betrayed him.
He feared his foes would shoot, though everything was so obscured
that they were likely to wait in the hope of capturing him or
gaining a fairer aim.</p>

<p>A faint lighting up in front showed that he was nearing the edge
of the wood. Two bounds carried him clear, and then, with the
utmost speed of which he was capable, he ran along the margin
to a slight turn in the conformation of the grove, when he leaped
out into the open air and was off with as great fleetness as he
displayed on the home-stretch in his race with Ralph Genther,
after the turkey shoot at Woodvale.</p>

<p>By his dodging and trickery he had gained an important start,
but not enough to put him beyond sight of the Assiniboines, who
debouched from the timber at the moment the form of the Shawanoe
was fast dissolving in the gloom. They were fleet of foot, and
in the belief that they could speedily run the fugitive to earth
they made after him. Hardly had the singular race opened when
the astounded pursuers saw no fugitive before them! He had been
swallowed up in the darkness like an arrow launched from a powerful
bow. The Assiniboines must have come to the belief that whoever
the stranger was he knew how to run. You and I came to that belief
long ago.</p>

<p>One of the chagrined pursuers fired in the direction of the flying
fugitive. The bullet probably passed within fifty feet of him,
certainly not near enough for Deerfoot to hear the whistle of
the missile.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe was too wise to maintain his flight in a direct
line, for there was no saying how long his enemies would hunt
for him. He made a wide detour to the right and passed around
the head of the lake, moving as silently as a shadow and issuing
no call to Whirlwind to join him. Reaching the point he had in
mind he stopped, peered around in the gloom and carefully located
himself. Then he placed his thumb and forefinger between his teeth
and pierced the stillness with that peculiar whistle which could
have been heard a mile away.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, if we can believe that animals are capable of reasoning,
Whirlwind must have had some uncomfortable thoughts. He was listening
for the next orders of his master and could make nothing of the
tumult going on near him. He would have been eager to lend a helping
hand, or, rather, hoof, but did not know how to lend it. He might
make matters worse by the attempt. He had received his commands
and it only remained for him to obey them.</p>

<p>While thus waiting, the Assiniboine leader&mdash;he who claimed him
as his particular property&mdash;assumed form in the starlight and
drew near. Whirlwind snuffed suspiciously. He could not understand
matters, but he had seen his master and comrade and resented any
impertinence from others.</p>

<p>The Assiniboine hurried up and extended one hand to grasp the
forelock of the stallion, in order to lead him back to his place
on the other side of the camp. At that moment the signal of Deerfoot
rang out.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Assiniboine suspected the meaning of the call, for
he darted forward and seized the forelock. Whirlwind instantly
reared, and with a single blow of his hoof knocked the red man
senseless. He did not kill him, but it is safe to conclude that
when the Assiniboine regained his senses he knew a good deal more
than he ever knew before.</p>

<p>The waiting Shawanoe heard the sound of hoofs, and a minute later
saw the form of the stallion as he galloped up and paused with
his nose thrust forward, asking for another caress.</p>

<p>He received it and in his mute way expressed his own pleasure
at being with his master again. The danger was not yet over, and
the Shawanoe deferred further petting until the opportunity was
more fitting. Resting one hand upon the neck of the stallion he
leaped lightly astride of him, still keeping the blanket about
his own shoulders, for the night was keen and the horse did not
need the protection.</p>

<p>Whirlwind yearned to stretch his limbs and speed away with his
master on his back. But it would have been unsafe. After leaving
the vicinity of the lake the country was rough, and in the darkness
the surest-footed horse was liable to fall. Moreover, there was
no need of haste.</p>

<p>So the stallion passed out into the night at his usual graceful
walk, while his rider for the time listened and peered into the
darkness behind him for sound or sight of the Assiniboines who
would have given much for a chance to revenge themselves upon
the daring youth that had outwitted them.</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour Deerfoot slipped from the back of
his steed and pressed his ear to the earth. If the Assiniboines
were following and were near he would learn the fact through this
better conductor of sound. He heard nothing and once more vaulted
upon Whirlwind.</p>

<p>Relieved for the time of all cause for fear, Deerfoot now gave
grateful attention to the proud stallion that was bearing him
southward. He first tested his recollection of the words of command
which he had taught him, and which you will remember were in a
peculiar language known only to the two. Whirlwind proved his
excellent memory by promptly responding to every order addressed
to him. Then the Shawanoe guided him by pressure of his knees,
and by a certain manner of striking the heels of his moccasins
against his sides. The result could not have been more satisfactory.</p>

<p>"Whirlwind is a bad horse," said Deerfoot, feeling that it was
time to have a little sport with him. "He ran away from Deerfoot
on purpose. If he had had any sense he would have left the Assiniboines
and set out to find Deerfoot instead of making Deerfoot travel
so far to find him."</p>

<p>It would be absurd to pretend that a horse, even with the rare
intelligence of Whirlwind, could grasp the meaning of these words.
However, he understood the sharp pinch which his master gave him
on the side of his neck, followed by a brisk slap with his hand.
The stallion reached his head around and nipped at the leg of
Deerfoot, who drew it back and flipped the nose of the animal.</p>

<p>Then Whirlwind flung his head around his other shoulder and snapped
at the leg on that side, which was hardly snatched out of the
way in time to escape. Deerfoot gently smote the nose to remind
the steed that with all his strength and wisdom the youth was
still his master. Thus they parried and played and plagued each
other until Deerfoot, with that curious refinement of cruelty
which we often show to those we love most, pretended to be offended.</p>

<p>"If Whirlwind wishes to bite Deerfoot he may do so."</p>

<p>And to show he meant what he said he reached forward and placed
his hand between the lips of the horse. The latter instantly opened
his jaws, so as to inclose the hand with his teeth. A slight effort
would have crushed the fingers out of all semblance of symmetry
and beauty. Whirlwind did bring his jaws nearly together, but
took good care that the pressure was not sufficient to harm a
fly.</p>

<p>Deerfoot's heart smoke him. He could not stand this cruelty to
as true a friend as ever lived. Resting his rifle across his thighs,
so as to leave his hands free, he leaned forward, and, inclosing
the satin neck in his grasp, gave the noble creature as fervent
an embrace as wooer ever gave to sweetheart.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot loves Whirlwind, and his heart would have been sad
all his life if he had not found him. None shall take him away
from Deerfoot again. Deerfoot knows that we shall meet in that
land that our Father is saving for those who do His will, and
then Deerfoot and Whirlwind shall hunt and roam the forests and
prairies forever."</p>

<p>If the meaning of the words was vague to the stallion, he could
not mistake the meaning of the embrace and the reposing of the
side of the Shawanoe's face in the luxuriant mane. He was fully
repaid for the indignities he had suffered and the grief that
had come to him because of the separation of the two. Had Whirlwind
been able to put his ideas in words it is conceivable that he
would have reproached the Shawanoe for deserting and leaving him
among strangers. Had he not done so, no search with its attendant
dangers would have been forced upon the youth.</p>

<p>And had this rebuke been given to Deerfoot, surely he would have
admitted the justice of the charge, for we know how he reproached
himself for his conduct. But we blame others for ills which we
know are caused by ourselves, and we chide unjustly those whom
we love most, knowing all the time how unjust we are, and that
if we loved less the reproof would not be given at all.</p>
