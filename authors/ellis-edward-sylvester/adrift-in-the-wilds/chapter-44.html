<p>The instant the hindmost Indian uttered his exclamation of surprise,
the others paused, and thus, before Elwood Brandon fully realized
his danger, he found himself confronted by the whole force. Resistance
or flight was not to be thought of, so he merely stood still and
tremblingly awaited their will regarding him.</p>

<p>They were plainly surprised at finding a boy pressing against
the rooks with an appearance of the greatest terror, and they
gazed at him a moment as if uncertain what to do about it. However,
they didn't seem to be particularly savage or blood-thirsty, nor
frightened, as they kept their guns in their hands and their knives
in their belts.</p>

<p>He who stood nearest to Elwood reached out his brawny arm, grasped
him firmly and drew him out from his hiding-place. All then scrutinized
him as if to make sure whether he was some wild animal or human
being. Satisfied on this point, the boy was then shoved forward
so as to be between the savages, and as they stepped off he was
motioned to do the same. Elwood understood that he was a prisoner,
and he philosophically submitted to his fate.</p>

<p>As yet they had not disturbed his weapons; but he had gone a
short distance only when the Indian directly behind him placed
his hand upon the muzzle of the gun which was protruding over
the youngster's shoulder and began drawing it. The latter disliked
very much to part with the rifle, and held it as tightly as possible;
but as the savage only drew it the more powerfully, he finally
let go and it instantly went from his possession.</p>

<p>Elwood could not forbear looking around at the one who had thus
deprived him of his property. As he gazed into his face he was
at a loss to understand the expression. The Indian fixed his black
eyes upon him, but his lips were closed and not a feature moved
or twitched. The boy could not withstand the fierceness of those
orbs and was glad to turn his head again.</p>

<p>They walked quite rapidly up the path, making a turn that gave
them a very steep ascent. The thunder was booming louder than
ever, and the rain by this time was falling furiously. The party
hurried forward until they reached the camp which Tim O'Rooney
and Howard had so recently deserted. Here Elwood took the liberty
of protecting himself by backing against the overhanging rock.
This was precisely the position which he occupied when Howard
Lawrence gazed over and missed seeing him by such a narrow chance.</p>

<p>When the descent of the rain became so copious as to scatter
the savages, two of them ran up beside Elwood and imitated his
action in protecting himself from the descending deluge. This
was only a partial success, yet much preferable to standing in
the open air and receiving the full pelting of the storm.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Howard Lawrence waited until he saw
the Indians hurry away for shelter, when he returned to Tim O'Rooney
and the two effected a safe retreat from the dangerous locality.
They saw nothing more of the savages, and their conjecture that
Elwood was a prisoner among them was merely a conjecture, although
absolutely correct.</p>

<p>The tiny stream running so quietly at the feet of the two aboriginal
Americans and Elwood Brandon increased so rapidly that it was
evident it would speedily become a torrent that would sweep them
off their feet, and that the only safety was to effect as speedy
an escape as possible. Taking him between them, they started directly
up the path in the direction of their companions. The falling
rain and splashing water almost blinded Elwood, but he pressed
bravely forward until conscious that they were beneath some kind
of covering, and looking around, saw that they stood in a sort
of cave, and where they had rejoined the three Indians who had
fled some time before.</p>

<p>The shelter proved a secure one, although it was reached rather
late to be of much benefit to Elwood, who was thoroughly wetted
to the skin. He was, however, rather pleased at the lenient disposition
shown by his captors. They had not offered him the least violence,
rudeness or insult, and appeared to maintain a very indifferent
watch over him. He did not believe they intended him any bodily
harm, although he trembled at the consequences when they joined
another party or should reach their own homes. They probably intended
to hold him a prisoner so long as he was no particular trouble
to them; but their leniency was more the result of indifference
than of genuine kindness&mdash;and indifference that would as soon
witness death as life, and that would not stretch out the hand
to avert the impending doom.</p>

<p>The storm raged with unabated fury for several hours, and the
tiny stream, whose murmur could scarcely be heard as it coursed
its way through the hills, was now swelled to the dimensions of
a torrent, and roared through its course with a clamor almost
deafening. A vast amount of water had fallen within the few hours,
and it would have been very perilous had any of the party remained
where the fire that cooked the antelope was kindled. A yellow
stream some six feet in depth rushed furiously through the narrow
passage, like some river when compressed into its narrow canyon.</p>

<p>The Indians stood as motionless as the rocks themselves until
the storm was over. Each had his blanket slung over his shoulder,
extending down to his knees, and effectually protecting their
bodies from the rain which had so thoroughly soaked poor Elwood.
None of them sported the defiant scalp-locks so common among the
more northern Indians; but their long, black, stiff hair, resembling
precisely that of a horse's mane, dangled around their shoulders,
neck and ears and over their breasts. Mixed in among the hair
on the crown were a number of painted feathers, which, having
had a touch of rain, drooped down like those of an humbled chanticleer
that has been rescued from the river by some kind hand. Their
faces being daubed over with green, yellow and red, mixed and
mingled with a sublime disregard of proportion, gave their features
a peculiarly unnatural appearance, such as we see when we survey
our particular friends through differently and highly colored
pieces of glass. They were fine specimens of the "noble red man"
that are occasionally met with now-a-days; but they are of that
species of sights of which it may be said "distance lends enchantment
to the view." However, they were happy, for as yet they had not
come in contact with civilization, and had had no taste for the
white man's "fire-water," that scourge of the aboriginal race,
and which seems destined finally to sweep them from the continent.</p>

<p>Elwood occupied himself in looking from one of these Indians
to the other, and speculating regarding their thoughts and opinions
about himself, of whose presence they seemed so unconscious. Indeed,
they scarcely looked at him except when he sneezed, and then their
heads shot round as suddenly as if they were moved by machinery
and the spasm had let on the steam.</p>

<p>Finally, when the falling of the rain ceased, two of the Indians
went out to look for the remainder of their prisoner's party,
which they knew, if not already there, had been so recently among
the hills. The vast rush of water, of course, had obliterated
all signs where they had made any, and they could only hope to
find them by discovering the trail made since the storm, or by
the sight of themselves.</p>

<p>Not a word did the savages exchange with each other. They appeared
to understand what each thought, and what duty was required of
them, which duty for the present resembled that of watching and
waiting.</p>

<p>As the day wore away the boy began to feel chilly and hungry.
His wet clothes were anything but comfortable, and his hollow
stomach was a poor protection against the sinking feeling. As
his captors showed no disposition to leave the place, or even
to change their statue-like positions, he began to grow anxious.
He feared an attack of sickness if his wants were not supplied;
and after debating with himself a few moments, he walked up to
the tallest Indian and motioned that he needed something to eat.</p>

<p>The reply was startling and decisive. The dusky rascal surveyed
him sharply a moment, and then drew his knife and raised it in
a menacing manner over his head. And thereupon Elwood retreated
to his position, and concluded he wasn't quite as hungry as he
first imagined.</p>

<p>It is hard to tell what this singular captivity of Elwood Brandon's
would have eventuated in had not an unexpected diversion occurred
in his favor. Just as it was getting dark, the two Indiana who
had gone out at the close of the storm returned. They had a companion
with them, and we leave our readers to imagine what the boy's
feelings were when he recognized in the third his old friend Shasta,
the Pah Utah.</p>
