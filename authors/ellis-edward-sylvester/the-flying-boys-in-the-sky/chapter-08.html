<p>The last remark of Professor Morgan threw Bohunkus Johnson into
a state of excitement. He had obeyed Harvey and remained mute
during the conversation, but he now addressed the visitor directly:</p>

<p>"Did yo’ say Afriky, boss?"</p>

<p>The man looked in his direction and nodded his head.</p>

<p>"That’s what I said, sir."</p>

<p>"Dat’s where my fader libs."</p>

<p>Harvey felt it his duty to explain:</p>

<p>"My colored friend claims to be the son of a distinguished African
chief, whom he hopes to visit some day."</p>

<p>"What is the name of the chief?" asked the Professor.</p>

<p>"His given name is the same as his; the full name is Bohunkus
Foozleum."</p>

<p>"I can’t say I ever heard of him," remarked the Professor without
cracking a smile.</p>

<p>"I sent him a letter a month ago, in de care ob Colonel Roosevelt
and it’s ’bout time I got an answer. I’m sure de Colonel will
call on him while he’s hunting in Afriky."</p>

<p>"Well, when my machine is perfected, I’ll take you with me and
it sha’n’t cost you a penny," said Professor Morgan.</p>

<p>Bohunkus chuckled with delight and settled down to listen. The
visitor now ignored him and addressed the others.</p>

<p>"Aviation is the theme that fills nearly all minds and it is
daily growing in importance. The possibilities are boundless;
it will revolutionize travel, social life and the methods of warfare.
It will render the destruction of life and property so appallingly
easy that no nation will dare array itself against another. You
and I are likely to see that day when:—</p>

<p>
"‘The war drum throbs no longer and the battle flags are furled<br/>
O’er the parliament of nations, o’er a reunited world.’

</p>

<p>"We can remember the universality of the bicycle; then came,
and it stays with us, the automobile, and now it is the aeroplane.
The day is near when there will be numberless routes established
between cities and countries and when the ocean will be crossed
east and west by a procession of heavier-than-air machines, and
every family will have its hangar and its occupant awaiting the
wish of the owner."</p>

<p>The Professor showed a disposition to quiz the young aviator,
who met him as best he could, though sensible of his lack of knowledge
as compared with one who had given so much thought and experimentation
to it.</p>

<p>"Naturally," said he, "men’s first ideas were of using wings
as birds do, but it would take a Samson or a Hercules to put forth
the necessary strength. But it has been tried times without number.
I think the ancient Greeks wove many romantic tales of aerial
flights—"</p>

<p>The Professor paused and Harvey accepted the invitation:</p>

<p>"Such as Daedalus and Icarus, who were said to have flown to
the sun and back again. The Greek Achytus made a dove of wood,
driven by heated air, and one of his countrymen constructed a
brass fly which kept above the ground for some minutes."</p>

<p>"Do you recall what aviator first came to grief?"</p>

<p>"‘Simon the Magician,’ who during the reign of the emperor Nero
made a short flight before a Roman crowd but tumbled to death,
as did a good many during the Middle Ages."</p>

<p>"The Chinese were centuries ahead of the rest of the world in
the use of the mariner’s compass, printing, gunpowder and the
flying of kites. There are authentic records of balloon flights
in the fourteenth century, and a hundred years later discoveries
were made of which present aviators have taken advantage. You
have learned that although America was visited a thousand years
ago and even earlier by white men, the glory of the discovery
is given to Christopher Columbus. So the credit of the first real
step in aviation belongs to two Frenchmen. Can you help me to
recall their names?"</p>

<p>"I don’t think you need any help," laughed Harvey, who saw the
drift of his friend’s quizzing, "but the men you have in mind
were Joseph and Etienne Montgolfier, who lived at Annonay, about
forty miles from Lyons."</p>

<p>"What was their idea of aerostation?"</p>

<p>"They learned from many experiments that a light globe filled
with hot air will rise because its weight is less than the surrounding
atmosphere, just as a cork or bit of pine comes to the surface
of water. They made a globular ball, thirty-five feet in diameter,
of varnished silk, and in June, 1783, in the presence of an immense
crowd at Annonay built a fire under the mouth on the lower side.
Soon after when the ropes were loosened, the balloon mounted upward
for more than a mile, then was carried to one side by a current
of air and as the vapor within cooled, came gently down to earth
again.</p>

<p>"The incident caused a sensation and Paris subscribed money for
manufacturing hydrogen, a very buoyant gas to take the place of
hot air. The brothers sent up such a balloon in Paris in the latter
part of August. It sailed aloft for half a mile, finally drifted
out of sight and came down fifteen miles from the starting point."</p>

<p>"Did it carry any passenger?" asked the Professor.</p>

<p>"No; the time had not come for that venture, but soon after the
brothers sent up a second hot air balloon at Versailles, in the
presence of the king and queen. A wicker cage was suspended below
and in it were a duck, a rooster and a sheep, all of which showed
less excitement than the cheering thousands. It rose about a fourth
of a mile, and eight minutes after leaving the ground descended
two miles away."</p>

<p>"Who was the first man to go up in a balloon?" asked Abisha Wharton.</p>

<p>"I don’t remember his name; can you tell me, Professor?"</p>

<p>"Pilatre de Rozier, whose ascent was made on the 15th of October,
1783, in an oval balloon constructed by the Montgolfiers. It was
not quite fifty feet in diameter and half again as high. A circular
wicker basket was suspended beneath, and under the neck of the
balloon in the center was an iron grate or brazier supported by
chains, the whole structure weighing sixteen hundred pounds. M.
de Rozier fed the flames with straw and wood and thus kept the
air sufficiently heated to lift him eighty-four feet, where held
by ropes, the balloon remained suspended for four and a half minutes
and then gently came back to earth.</p>

<p>"This incident blazed the way for successful aerostation. M.
de Rozier accomplished higher and more durable ascents and occasionally
took a passenger with him. We must remember, however, that in
all these instances, the balloon was restrained by ropes and could
not wander off. The aeronauts chafed under such restriction, and
on November 21, 1783, M. de Rozier and the Marquis d’Arlandes
cut loose from the earth in front of a royal palace in the Bois
de Boulogne, it being the first time such a thing was ever done.
The ascent lasted not quite half an hour, when the aeronauts came
safely down in a field five miles distant from the starting point."

<p>Footnote 1:</p>

<p>  It is well to bear the following distinctions in mind: aerostation
is   the art of flying in a balloon; when the balloon is equipped
with   motor and propellers so as to be navigable, it is dirigible;
an   aerocar is any kind of a flying machine; an aeronaut is any
one who   navigates the air in a balloon; an aeroplane is a flying
machine which   is heavier than air; a monoplane is a one-planed
and a biplane a   two-planed flying machine; a triplane consists
of three superposed   planes; a quadruplane of four planes; airmen
are either aeronauts or   aviators; aviation is the art of flying
in an aeroplane and an aviator   is one who so flies; aeronef
is an aeroplane as defined by   International Congress; a hangar
corresponds to a garage for an   automobile; ornithopter is a
heavier-than-air machine, with wings upon   which it depends for
support and propulsion; petrol is the European   name for gasoline.</p>
