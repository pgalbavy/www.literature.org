<p><em>MEN </em>trained in the profession of the cowboys think and
act quickly. Within a half hour following their meeting with Herbert
Watrous, the party were travelling the other way, and shortly
after emerged from the hills, where the ground was perfectly level,
and advantage could be taken of the faint moonlight which would
soon aid them.</p>

<p>As soon as they were fairly out in the open country, the Texans
halted and sat motionless for a moment. They were listening for
sounds which they heard not. Then Lattin slipped from the saddle
and held his ear for a full minute pressed flat against the earth.</p>

<p>"It’s all right," he remarked, swinging himself over the back
of his pony. The three broke into a moderate gallop, riding almost
abreast, for there was abundant room for them to do so.</p>

<p>It was about a mile from where the last change of direction took
place that Strubell drew his horse down to a walk and edged in
as close as he could to the hills, his companions, of course,
doing the same. It was apparent that he was looking for the "new
route" that had been spoken of. Herbert did all he could to aid,
but when an abrupt change was made he saw no cause for it.</p>

<p>"That’s the reason why so few know about this," explained the
elder Texan, after stating that they had struck the right spot;
"if it was plain enough to be seen miles off, Bell would have
known all about it."</p>

<p>"Ard and me found it out by accident," added Lattin; "you observe
how you turn here, just as if you was passing behind a door, before
you hit the pass: that door hides it from the sight of anyone
out on the prairie."</p>

<p>The peculiar conformation had been noticed by Herbert, who replied
that he could not have noticed it at noonday.</p>

<p>"The queerest thing," added Lattin, "is that it’s just the same
on the other side; if it wasn’t, the pass would have been found
from that direction; me and Ard was chasin’ a couple of Kioways
one day that had stolen a horse, when they dodged in here and
gave us the slip; that’s the way we hit it."</p>

<p>An expert engineer could not have constructed a finer cut through
the ridge—that is, for the present purpose. At no place was it
more than a hundred or less than fifty feet in width, and the
ground was so level that, had they chosen, their horses might
have galloped the whole distance. There was little doubt that
the ridge had been broken apart at this point by some terrific
convulsion of nature, the opposite sides corresponding so perfectly
that they would have dovetailed, could they have been pushed together.</p>

<p>This being the fact, a brief time only elapsed, when the three
horsemen, whose sole purpose now was to overtake the party that
was making off with Nick Ribsam, rode out upon the open plain
beyond.</p>

<p>Here was another brief halt, while the younger Texan held his
ear against the earth, the other neither moving nor speaking.
He remained in his prone posture so long that it was evident he
had detected something. He must have caught a suspicious sound
and was trying to locate it.</p>

<p>"It’s right ahead," he said, as he once more climbed into the
saddle, "and not fur off."</p>

<p>Since the movements were now based on the discovery of the younger
cowboy, the elder dropped slightly back and joined Herbert as
an intimation that Lattin had become the leader.</p>

<p>The latter kept his pony on a walk, and the youth was close enough
to him to observe that he frequently turned his head in different
directions, showing that he was looking and listening with the
utmost care. All at once he drew rein and the others halted by
his side.</p>

<p>"<em>Sh!</em> you hear ‘em," he whispered.</p>

<p>Herbert noticed the stamp of a horse, as he judged it to be,
which could not have been far in advance, though the night was
so still that a slight sound could be heard a long way. He was
tempted to ask whether it was not true that if they could discover
others close by, the strangers had the same chance of learning
about them, but he was sure his friends understood themselves
too well to commit a blunder which <em>he</em> would detect.</p>

<p>Without another word between the men the younger let himself
silently to the ground and moved forward in the gloom. It seemed
to the youth that he showed rashness by this act, for, instead
of crouching over and stealing along, step by step, he remained
erect and walked with his ordinary gait, except perhaps he lifted
and set down his feet more lightly.</p>

<p>It need not be said, however, that Baker Lattin understood what
he was doing, and, when at the end of a few minutes he came back,
he brought the very news which Strubell expected and which confirmed
the theory formed by the cowboys.</p>

<p>The three pack horses belonging to the Americans were less than
two hundred yards distant. A couple were lying down while the
third was cropping the grass. No person was nearer than the owners,
so that it was proven that they had been left there by Bell Rickard
and his companion to be picked up by Jim-John and Brindage, who
were to follow them at a more leisurely pace.</p>

<p>The animals were not picketed, for they were not likely to wander
beyond easy reach during the few hours that must elapse before
the rear guard could come up with them. Their loads had been placed
on the ground and their bridles removed, so that they were free
to wander whither they chose.</p>

<p>The tidings were pleasing to our friends, who were thus given
the means of procuring what they were sure to need before reaching
the end of their journey. Strubell brought forth the blankets,
extra suits for stormy weather, and a goodly number of articles
that insured comfort for a good while to come.</p>

<p>It seemed odd that after recovering their animals and property
the Texans should coolly turn them over to the thieves, but the
reader will see that it was the only thing to be done. Rickard
and Slidham had abandoned them for the sake of speed, and for
their pursuers to take them up would be to handicap themselves
in the same fatal fashion.</p>

<p>The fugitives, as they may be called, had got what they wanted
from the pack horses, and, when Strubell and Lattin did the same,
the loads were much lightened.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, without the slightest hesitation that, after
procuring their supplies, our friends resumed their advance, leaving
the couple among the hills to explain by what means the Texans
had flanked them.</p>

<p>Strubell had hopes of overtaking Rickard and Slidham before daylight,
his belief being that they would go into camp after riding a number
of miles. They had been in the saddle so continuously during the
last few days, it would seem they ought to need rest as much as
their animals, but as the darkness wore on without sight or sound
of them, he and Lattin agreed that the scamps were pushing their
horses to the utmost.</p>

<p>The pursuers were also pressing their animals hard, and to a
higher degree than they would have done under other circumstances,
but the Texans showed an eagerness to reach the other party that
caused Herbert alarm. He was certain there must be a cause for
this haste which they refused to explain to him.</p>

<p>At long intervals one of the men resorted to the usual test of
placing his ear to the ground with the hope of catching the sounds
of footsteps. Once he stated that he heard something of the kind,
and for a half hour they believed they were coming up with the
company in front. It proved, however, that some kind of animals
were moving across the country that were not likely to be those
they were seeking.</p>

<p>To settle the question the pursuit was forced, and they overtook
a couple of mavericks or stray cattle. One of them was turned
to account, for Strubell shot it, and the party went into camp.</p>

<p>It was high time they did so, for their ponies were worn out
and they themselves were tired and sleepy. Enough fuel was found
to start a fire, over which a good meal was prepared, sufficient
being cooked and laid aside to allow them to keep up the pursuit
for a couple of days without stopping for food.</p>

<p>The fear of Herbert Watrous was that a mistake had been made
by his friends who had wandered from the trail, but when daylight
dawned, and the Texans made an investigation, they found they
were right. Rickard and Slidham were following the very course
named by them—that is, in the direction of New Mexico.</p>

<p>"It looks as if it’s going to be a long chase," said Strubell;
"but unless something unexpected happens we shall win."</p>
