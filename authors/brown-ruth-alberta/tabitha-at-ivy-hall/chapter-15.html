<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>That first night at Ivy Hall&mdash;for this was the name of the boarding
school&mdash;was long remembered by Tabitha. Fifty bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked
girls gathered with the little staff of instructors around the
long tables in the breezy dining hall, laughing and chattering
merrily about their happy vacations, greeting friends of the previous
year with girlish enthusiasm, and welcoming the strangers among
their number with a cordiality that made them feel as if they
had always belonged there. It was such a wonderful experience
to our little maid from the desert that she could scarcely touch
the tempting meal spread before her, but sat like a statue, drinking
in the happy scene with a hungry heart.</p>

<p>"See that little dark-eyed lady at the end of our table?" said
a winsome-faced girl at Tabitha's right, who answered to the name
of Jessie Wayne. "She is Madame DuBois, the French teacher, who
is in charge of our floor. Your room is across from Carrie's,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Tabitha, shyly. "She looks as if she might be
lovely."</p>

<p>"Oh, she is! Next to Miss Pomeroy, she is the most popular teacher
here. The red-headed, cross-looking, fat woman at the second table
is Miss White, who has classes in music and drawing. She is lots
better than she looks. Miss Summers is the next teacher. People
often mistake her for a pupil here. Isn't that a joke? She does
look awfully young, but this is her fourth year at Ivy Hall. She
is a darling, too."</p>

<p>"Who teaches Latin?" ventured Tabitha, as her talkative companion
lapsed into silence long enough to take a bite of bread. "Carrie
said there was to be a change this year."</p>

<p>"Yes, we have a new Latin instructor. Her name is Miss Cornwall.
She is the one sitting in the corner, wearing glasses. She looks
mighty severe, but I'll bet she can be jolly. Miss Pomeroy never
has a cross teacher here. I heard her tell Madame that Miss Cornwall
is to be on our floor, too. I suppose she will have the room next
to Carrie's, as that is the only vacant one at that end of the
corridor."</p>

<p>"Who is the tall lady at Miss Pomeroy's table?" asked inquisitive
Tabitha, eager to make the acquaintance of all the staff of teachers.</p>

<p>"Miss King, of the domestic science department. Oh, you will
like her! She is splendid!"</p>

<p>"That's what you've said about them all," laughed the black-eyed
girl, privately thinking she had found the Garden of Eden.</p>

<p>"Well, they are! Really, I believe Ivy Hall is the loveliest
boarding school there is in the world. We are just like one great,
big family here. Miss Pomeroy makes the <em>dearest</em> mother."</p>

<p>"What are the other teachers, then? Aunts?" Tabitha asked.</p>

<p>Jessie shouted. "I never thought of it before, but that is surely
what they are, and they do give us the loveliest times, and make
the lessons so interesting that it doesn't seem like study at
all. But they are awfully particular. They won't take <em>any</em>
kind of a girl here. She has to be well recommended and even then
there are always about twice as many girls who want to enter as
there is room for. This year there were forty who couldn't get
in."</p>

<p>"Oh!" breathed Tabitha, recalling with alarm Miss Pomeroy's words
on the stairs. "Do they ever send them away after they have begun
school here?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't&mdash;know. Why, yes, sometimes. There was a girl
here last year who cheated and took things that didn't belong
to her and was real saucy to the teachers; and when she went home
at Christmas time she never came back. She told us that she didn't
want to, but I think Miss Pomeroy wouldn't let her. There goes
the signal for assembly. We always meet just after tea each evening
for chapel services."</p>

<p>"Chapel services?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We sing a hymn or two and listen to a short talk from one
of the teachers before going up to our rooms for study. Likely
Miss Pomeroy will speak tonight, as this is the first evening.
Sit anywhere you wish. Here's a hymn-book."</p>

<p>Tabitha accepted the book, slipped into a vacant seat in the
corner, and marvelled at the sudden hush that fell over the noisy
throng as the silvery-haired principal arose to address them.
This wise lady was not given to sermonizing, but talked in a confidential,
motherly fashion, telling them of her hopes and expectations for
the school year lying before them, explaining the few rules it
had been found necessary to lay down for the governing of so many
active little bodies, and filling each girlish heart with inspiration
and a desire to win this dear woman's approval.</p>

<p>"It is not our aim to make our school a prison," said the sweet
voice to the attentive throng, drinking in every word. "We want
our girls to be happy and light-hearted and gay; we hope to fill
every hour with sunshine and music and laughter. We are anxious
that each one of you shall love Ivy Hall with your whole heart&mdash;not
merely because of the merry days you enjoyed inside its walls,
but because of the lasting help you shall have gained here, for
we are gathered under this roof to study, you know, and not to
idle away the golden hours, but you will find there are many lessons
to be learned in boarding school that are not contained in books.
You are all away from home and its influences, many of you for
the first time in all your lives; and it is the duty of this little
band of teachers to train and instruct the minds and bodies intrusted
to our care. This is a pleasant task for us, and we shall do our
best for each individual girl, but in return we shall expect you
to do your best for us.</p>

<p>"Our lives are like gardens; our faults are the weeds, our good
traits the flowers, and we are the gardeners. If we are careless
and do not try to overcome the faults, they flourish and grow
stronger each year, and in the end will choke out all the flowers.
While if we honestly seek to cultivate the good qualities we all
possess, and to weed out the unworthy acts and thoughts, our gardens
will grow beautiful and will be a pleasure to all our friends,
as well as to ourselves. I hope my girls will all try to root
out the weeds in your lives&mdash;the hot tempers" &mdash;Tabitha thought
the kindly eyes looked straight at her as these words were spoken&mdash;"thoughtless
words, selfish habits, envy, jealousy, and the countless other
things that make so many lives unhappy. Cultivate kind thoughts,
gentle words, good deeds, unselfishness and sunny dispositions.
Don't let bickerings or harsh speeches or unkind acts mar the
spirit of harmony we want in our school. Take for your motto the
Golden Rule, and treat all your companions as you would like them
to treat you. Be the best girl you know how to be."</p>

<p>From her corner of the room Tabitha sat glowering at Chrystobel
opposite, trying to absorb the teacher's helpful words, while
in her heart she was blaming her room-mate for the scene of the
previous hour, and wondering how she could get even with the enemy.
Chrystobel returned the sour looks with interest, even making
a wry face occasionally behind her hand when Miss Pomeroy chanced
to be looking in the other direction, for this spoiled maid was
equally as sure that Tabitha was the sole cause of the disturbance.</p>

<p>But when the girls were all in bed that night, the lights turned
out and the great building silent, Tabitha's anger abated, Miss
Pomeroy's words kept repeating themselves in her mind, Jessie's
unconscious warning filled her with uneasiness, gentle Mrs. Vane's
motherly lectures came back to haunt her, and Mr. Carson's advice
of long ago suddenly sprang into memory and would not let her
rest. When she closed her eyes they rose before her inner vision
in such a provoking fashion that sleep refused to come to soothe
the tired, aching body.</p>

<p>"I have been hateful and horrid," sighed the weary girl at last,
giving up the struggle and facing the accusing conscience. "No
one will like me if I behave like that. I promised Mrs. Vane to
be good and just see what a beginning I have made! A scolding
already and I haven't been here a day. Oh, dear! Chrystobel <em>was</em>
selfish, but maybe if I had been good, she would have given up
that drawer and the hooks without any fuss. I acted like a perfect&mdash;cat!
Because she was selfish and&mdash;mean, yes, I think she was mean&mdash;that
was no reason for my being hateful. Oh, it is such hard work to
be good! I wonder if it will ever be any easier. Carrie doesn't
seem to have any trouble that way at all, and her room-mate is
a spoiled darling, too. If she can put up with Cassandra, I ought
to be able to deal with Chrystobel. I suppose &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>ought
to&mdash;tell her I am sorry. I hate to think of doing such a thing,
for maybe she will be a&mdash;cat. Perhaps I needn't tell her, but
just explain to Miss Pomeroy how bad I feel to think I made such
a scene&mdash;no, I didn't fight with Miss Pomeroy, and apologizing
to her won't make Chrystobel feel any better toward me. Oh, dear,
I suppose I must do it! Well, here goes &mdash;I've got the shivers
clear to my toe-tips already, thinking of what she may say. Chrystobel!"</p>

<p>She spoke the name softly, but the occupant of the other bed
heard, and slowly turned over facing the window, surprised, wondering
whether or not her ears could have deceived her.</p>

<p>"Chrystobel!"</p>

<p>There was no mistaking that sound. Should she answer? Chrystobel,
too, had passed a very uncomfortable evening, and found bed far
from agreeable. Away from her mother for the first time, she was
battling with pangs of homesickness as well as with her conscience,
for she had suddenly come to realize just how selfish her acts
must have seemed not only to the queer little girl, who was to
share this room with her, but also to the white-haired principal,
whom she wanted to love her. But fear that Tabitha would only
say something to make matters worse held her silent when she heard
the whispered name from the bed by the window.</p>

<p>"Chrystobel!"</p>

<p>The voice was not only insistent, but pleading, and the elder
girl lifted herself somewhat impatiently on her elbow, as she
muttered ungraciously, "Well?"</p>

<p>"I was afraid you would be asleep," came the relieved reply.
"Say, Chrystobel, I'm sorry I got mad this afternoon. Maybe if
I had had more patience I could have shown you just how selfish
you were without all that fuss and squabble. Will you forget the
hateful things I said and be friends with me? You can have both
big drawers and twenty-one hooks in the closet if you want them."</p>

<p>Chrystobel gasped, overcome by mingled emotions. Surprise, anger,
regret in turn filled her heart, and for a moment she was silent
because the lump in her throat choked her.</p>

<p>Tabitha, misconstruing the deep pause, began again anxiously,
"I've got the worst temper in seven counties. I reckon it's my
name; I have always hated it, but that doesn't help matters any.
I am always sorry after I get mad like that, but it is awfully
hard to say so. I never know how to say it so the other person
will believe me. But I really mean it, Chrystobel. I am sorry
I was so horrid to you. We ought to be friends, and then you could
help me keep from getting mad, and I could help you not to be
such a pig. Will you, Chrystobel?"</p>

<p>"Well," breathed her astounded room-mate, "you are the queerest
girl I ever saw, and you say the oddest things. I &mdash;I don't
know what to think."</p>

<p>"I don't mean to say odd things. I am truly sorry, and I wish
you would believe me."</p>

<p>The plaintive voice was too much for the haughty Chrystobel,
and with a quick spring she scrambled out of bed and groped her
way to where Tabitha lay curled under the covers, saying with
more real feeling than her companion had given her credit for,
"I do believe you, and I am just as sorry as you are for my actions&mdash;sorrier,
for I was to blame for the whole fuss. I <em>am</em> a selfish
pig, but no one ever dared to tell me that before, so I have gone
on being thoughtless and unkind and horrid. I have no brothers
or sisters at home to share things with, and I have always had
my own way until I've come to expect it from everybody, I am afraid.
Forgive me, Tabitha, I never knew before how really selfish I
was."</p>

<p>Chrystobel's arms had encircled Tabitha in an impulsive embrace,
and before the astonished girl had recovered her breath sufficiently
for a reply, there was a quick kiss pressed upon her lips, and
Chrystobel had slipped away in the dark to her own bed.</p>

<p>For a moment Tabitha lay motionless on her pillow, almost too
surprised for utterance at this turn of affairs; then she smiled
happily in the dark and whispered shyly, "I don't hate you, Chrystobel.
I didn't mean all those hateful things I said to you. I was mad
and that's why I spoke that way. I &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>love you."</p>

<p>"Then I'm glad," came the joyful answer through the blackness
of the room, "I take back all the mean things I said about you,
too, Tabitha. I am sure we are going to be splendid friends."</p>

<p>"So am I. Good-night, Chrystobel!"</p>

<p>"Good-night, Tabitha!"</p>

<p>A great peace descended upon both hearts, and the two girls drifted
away to happy dreams, their differences forgiven and forgotten.</p>

<p>Oh, no, they did not become saints on the spot; they were only
human beings like the rest of us, and many and frequent were the
girlish squabbles that marred the serenity of those happy school
days, but they honestly tried to do better, and that is half the
battle. Chrystobel <em>was</em> selfish and Tabitha <em>was</em>
a pepperpot, and neither of those faults is easily overcome, but
thanks to the common sense of the kindly principal and her staff
of teachers, the battle was not unsuccessfully waged.</p>

<p>Tabitha soon became a favorite among her mates, who were quick
to discover the sweet spirit under the fierce, hot temper, and
quick to feel the lonely girl's craving for affection. Understanding
that her home life had never been as glad and joyous as theirs,
they one and all strove to make the new surroundings bright and
beautiful, succeeding so well that gradually Tabitha forgot her
old griefs and vexations, and blossomed into a serene loveliness
that captivated both teachers and mates.</p>

<p>The name which Bertha had given her the day of her arrival clung,
and Kitty she became to the whole school,&mdash;the mascot of the second
floor. At one time this title would have been an added affliction
to her over-sensitive nature, but Tabitha was growing wise, and
was learning that people do not care how ugly one's name may be,
if the heart is good and beautiful. True, she had not ceased to
mourn because other girls were blessed with the pretty names which
had been denied her, but she was beginning to understand the sentiment:</p>
