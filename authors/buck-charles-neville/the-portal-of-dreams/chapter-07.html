<p>Pongee pajamas and a revolver belt constitute a light equipment even for
the tropics, but that was the least pressing of my concerns.
</p><p>How long I had remained insensible I can only estimate, but often there
come back to me, from that time, wraith-like shreds of memory in which I
seem to have drifted down the centuries. I recall for one thing a
stunned and throbbing aching back of the eyes and a half-conscious
gazing up at rocking stars.
</p><p>At all events, when rational understanding returned to me, the sun was
glaring insufferably from a scorched zenith. I began to patch together
fragments of memory and to call loudly for Mansfield. There was no
answer, and when I attempted to rise I found myself roughly lashed to
the life-raft by several turns of a line so tightly drawn that the
sensory nerves in my legs gave no response to my movements.
</p><p>My support was rocking in its lodgment between two weed-trailing
boulders, stained like verdigris and licked smooth by the lapping of the
sea. Off to my front stretched waters, so quiet that they seemed almost
tideless, though at a distance I could hear the running of surf. To look
behind involved a painful twisting of my neck, but I made the effort,
and was rewarded with the sight of land. A quarter of a mile away smooth
reaches of white sand met the water in a graciously inviting beach.
Beyond it and mounting upward from palm fringe to snow-cap rose the very
respectable proportions of a volcanic island. The coral rocks which had
caught my raft were outposts of many others that went trooping
shoreward, breaking, here and there, the surface of jade-green shallows.
</p><p>From the deep turquoise of the outer sea to the white rim of the sands
ran a gamut of colorful beauty. The mountain, as symmetrically coned as
Fuji-yama, stood over it all in grave dominance. Off to the left
sponge-like cliffs broke steeply upward from the level of the beach and
about their clefts circled endless flights of gulls. There I knew the
rising tide would thunder and break itself to pieces in a thousand
plumes of spray.
</p><p>But how had I reached this place and what had become of Mansfield? It
must have been he who had lashed me to the raft. From no one else on the
<u>Wastrel</u> could I have expected better treatment than "a cutlass swipe
or an ounce of lead." Palpably, he had emerged from the battle victor,
and, save for myself, sole survivor. I conjectured that when he had
floated the raft from the partly submerged deck, he had found the spark
of life still lurking in my pulses and had made me fast upon its
timbers. Perhaps an over-trust in his ability to remain afloat had made
him less careful of himself. Possibly he had lost consciousness as we
drifted and had been washed over-side, to fall prey to the prowling
sharks. I could not hope to know what his end had been, but I wished
that I might have shared it with him.
</p><p>I fumbled at the soaked knots of my rope with fingers that had grown
numb. When, at last, I was free and had to some extent restored the
circulation in my stagnant veins, I began the task of freeing my oarless
craft from its wedged position so that the insetting tide might carry me
to the shore.
</p><p>In the pocket of my pajama jacket, soaked with salt water and almost
reduced to a pulp, I found the letter which I stood charged to deliver
to the girl in Sussex. I laughed. I knew that I was not in reality the
solitary survivor of the <u>Wastrel</u>. I was merely the latest survivor. I
was to die more slowly than my fellows. This sun, at the end of my
lingering, would beat down on my bones, whitened, disjointed and perhaps
vulture-plucked. The revolver in my belt was already clouding into red
rust under the washing of the night's salt water. I experimentally
turned the cylinder and found that the corrosion had not yet attacked
the mechanism. One cartridge could cheat my sentence of slow death, yet
I did not fire the shot.
</p><p>Life had heretofore been a thing I would have willingly surrendered.
Now, I found myself standing precariously on the narrow and very
slippery edge of existence, and with Death advancing on me I no longer
wished to die. The very odds against me brought a dogged desire to cling
until my feet should slip and my fingers could no longer hold their
life-grip. Meantime I should probably go mad, but that lay hereafter. At
present I had only to wait for the tide. Since I could not hurry the
ocean pulse, I must lie there thinking.
</p><p>From the sea I could look for rescue only by a miracle. What had been
Coulter's course or destination he had not confided, but I knew that we
had for days been in imperfectly charted waters where our screws had
perhaps kicked up a virgin wake. We had passed atolls marked, on the
chart, P. D. and even E. D. ("position doubtful" and "existence
doubtful"), and to hope that some other wanderer might shortly follow
would be taxing coincidence too far.
</p><p>Only God knew what type of human, animal and reptilian life the island
held. I could view it across the accursedly beautiful waterway and
speculate upon its nature, but I could beat up no confidence in its
treatment of me. Its aspect would have been magnificent had its lush
greenery not wrapped and softened every commanding crag and angle, but
it was a loveliness which suggested treacherous menace; the deceptive
beauty of the panther or of the soft-gliding snake that charms its prey
to death.
</p><p>Isolation here would sap my mental essence and atrophy my brain, unless
some device could be found by which I could side-focus and divert my
trend of thought. Even had the young girl's diary remained to me, I
might by it have kept myself reminded of life in those civilized spots
which I could hardly hope to revisit; and so I might die sane. A single
book would have helped. I had been credited with a sense of the
ludicrous so whimsical as to be almost irresponsible. If now I could
invoke that facetious quality to my salvation I might hope to be
regarded as a consistent humorist.
</p><p>At length I saw that the tide was setting in, carrying my raft with it,
and realized that I was hungry. When I had once more under my feet the
feel of solid earth, the sun was hanging near the snow-capped crater of
the volcano. I left for to-morrow all problems of exploration, and
stripping to the skin, ran up and down the soft sand of the beach until
the blood was once more pulsing regularly through my naked body. Then on
hands and knees I pursued and devoured numbers of the unpalatable crabs
that scuttled to hiding under slimy tangles of sea weed. My throat was
hot and sticky with the parch of thirst, but as night fell the jungle
began to loom darkly, a forbidding hinterland, and no fresh water came
down to my beach.
</p><p>The melting snow was a guarantee of springs and a man can endure three
days without drinking if he must. I stretched myself between two large
rocks just upward of the high-tide line, cursing stout Cortez and all
those perniciously active souls who insisted on discovering the Pacific
Ocean.
</p><p>Sleep did not at once come to my relief. I saw the stars, close and
lustrous, parade across the night, and instead of planning while I lay
awake practical things for the morrow, as a good woodsman might have
done, I was thinking futilely of the psychological features of my
predicament. Possibly the doctor's prediction of insanity had lain
dormant in some brain cell from which it was now emerging to frighten
me. I feared less for the hunger of my body than for the impossibility
of feeding my mind. It occurred to me that keeping a record of my
emotions would at once serve to fight back atrophy and leave an
interesting record for those who might, but almost certainly would not,
come in after days to the island. Then I recalled that in my penless and
paperless plight I was as far from the possibility of writing as from
the power to ring for a taxicab and drive home.
</p><p>Yet the idea of a diary fascinated me. I wished to write in frankness
what it felt like to die at the foot of an undiscovered volcano. There
came to my mind an example I wished to emulate. I had come upon a report
made public by the Naval Department of Japan in which was quoted a
letter written by Lieutenant Sakuma, from the bottom of Hiroshima Bay,
where his submarine had struck and failed to rise again.
</p><p>Most of his crew lay dead in the sunken vessel, and he himself was
slowly and painfully succumbing to strangulation. He devoted to a note
of apology addressed to his Emperor those hours spent in dying, and
expressed the hope that his message might, in future, be of value in the
avoidance of similar fatalities. He praised the gallantry of his
subordinates.
</p><p>The letter, read in the Mikado's palace a week later, when the submarine
had been raised with its dead, was in the stoic style of the race and
severely official. It culminated in a broken sentence.
</p><p>"It is now 12:30 P. M. My breathing is so difficult and painful--I
thought I could blow out gasoline but I am intoxicated with it--Captain
Nakano--it is now 12:40 P. M.--I----"
</p><p>There it ended. It seemed to me that if I could busy myself in faint
duplicate, with so human a record of approaching the ferry, I could be
in a measure consoled. Then gazing at the Southern Cross, before sleep
brought respite, I found myself thinking once more of the elusive lady
who had so often escaped my inquisitive glance and whose face I should
now never see.
