<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>One night I was riding alone towards Horton Pen. A large moon
hung itself up above me like an enormous white plate. Finally
the sloping roof of the Ferry Inn, with one dishevelled palm tree
drooping over it, rose into the disk. The window lights were reflected
like shaken torches in the river. A mass of objects, picked out
with white globes, loomed in the high shadow of the inn, standing
motionless. They resolved themselves into a barouche, with four
horses steaming a great deal, and an army of negresses with bandboxes
on their heads. A great lady was on the road; her querulous voice
was calling to someone within the open door that let down a soft
yellow light from the top of the precipitous steps. A nondescript
object, with apparently two horns and a wheel, rested inert at
the foot of the sign-post; two negroes were wiping their foreheads
beside it. That resolved itself into a man slumbering in a wheelbarrow,
his white face turned up to the moon. A sort of buzz of voices
came from above; then a man in European clothes was silhouetted
against the light in the doorway. He held a full glass very carefully
and started to descend. Suddenly he stopped emotionally. Then
he turned half-right and called back, "Sir Charles! Sir Charles!
Here's the very man! I protest, the very man!" There was an interrogative
roar from within. It was like being outside a lion's cage.</p>

<p>People appeared and disappeared in front of the lighted door;
windows stood open, with heads craning out all along the inn face.
I was hurrying off the back of my horse when the admiral came
out on to the steps. Someone lit a torch, and the admiral became
a dark, solid figure, with the flash of the gold lace on his coat.
He stood very high in the leg; had small white whiskers, and a
large nose that threw a vast shadow on to his forehead in the
upward light; his high collar was open, and a mass of white appeared
under his chin; his head was uncovered. A third male face, very
white, bobbed up and down beside his shining left shoulder. He
kept on saying:</p>

<p>"What? what? what? Hey, what?... That man?" He appeared to be
halfway between supreme content and violent anger. At last he
delivered himself. "Let's duck him... hey?... Let's duck him!"
He spoke with a sort of benevolent chuckle, then raised his voice
and called, "Tinsley! Tinsley! Where the deuce is Tinsley?"</p>

<p>A high nasal sound came from the carriage window. "Sir Charles!
Sir Charles! Let there be no scene in my presence, I beg."</p>

<p>I suddenly saw, halfway up, laboriously ascending the steps,
a black figure, indistinguishable at first on account of deformities.
It was David Macdonald. Since his last, really terrible comments
on the failure of the boat-attack, he had been lying hidden somewhere.
It came upon me in a flash that he was making his way from one
hiding place to another. In making his escape from Spanish Town,
either to Kingston or the Vale, he had run against the admiral
and his party returning from the Topnambos' ball. It was hardly
a coincidence: everyone on the road met at the Ferry Inn. But
that hardly made the thing more pleasant.</p>

<p>Sir Charles continued to clamour for Tinsley, his flag lieutenant,
who, as a matter of fact, was the man drunk in the wheelbarrow.
When this was explained by the shouts of the negroes, he grunted,
"Umph!" turned on the man at his side, and said, "Here, Oldham;
you lend a hand to duck the little toad." It was the sort of thing
that the thirsty climate of Jamaica rendered frequent enough.
Oldham dropped his glass and protested. Macdonald continued silently
and enigmatically to climb the steps; now he was in for it he
showed plenty of pluck. No doubt he recognized that, if the admiral
made a fool of himself, he would be afraid to issue warrants in
soberness. I could not stand by and see them bully the wretched
little creature. At the same time I didn't, most decidedly, want
to identify myself with him.</p>

<p>I called out impulsively, "Sir Charles, surely you would not
use violence to a cripple."</p>

<p>Then, very suddenly, they all got to action, David Macdonald
reaching the top of the steps. Shrieks came from the interior
of the carriage, and from the waiting négresses. I saw three men
were falling upon a little thing like a damaged cat. I couldn't
stand that, come what might of it.</p>

<p>I ran hastily up the steps, hoping to be able to make them recover
their senses, a force of purely conventional emotion impelling
me. It was no business of mine; I didn't want to interfere, and
I felt like a man hastening to separate half a dozen fighting
dogs too large to be pleasant.</p>

<p>When I reached the top, there was a sort of undignified scuffle,
and in the end I found myself standing above a ghastly white gentleman
who, from a sitting posture, was gasping out, "I'll commit you!...
I swear I'll commit you!..." I helped him to his feet rather apologetically,
while the admiral behind me was asking insistently who the deuce
I was. The man I had picked up retreated a little, and then turned
back to look at me. The light was shining on my face, and he began
to call out, "I know him. I know him perfectly well. He's John
Kemp. I'll commit him at once. The papers are in the barouche."
After that he seemed to take it into his head that I was going
to assault him again. He bolted out of sight, and I was left facing
the admiral. He stared at me contemptuously. I was streaming with
perspiration and upbraiding him for assaulting a cripple.</p>

<p>The admiral said, "Oh, that's what you think? I will settle with
you presently. This is rank mutiny." I looked at Oldham, who was
the admiral's secretary. He was extremely dishevelled about his
neck, much as if a monkey had been clawing him thereabouts. Half
of his roll collar flapped on his heaving chest; his stock hung
down behind like a cue. I had seen him kneeling on the ground
with his head pinned down by the hunchback. I said loftily:</p>

<p>"What did you set him on a little beggar like that for? You were
three to one. What did you expect?"</p>

<p>The admiral swore. Oldham began to mop with a lace handkerchief
at a damaged upper lip from which a stream of blood was running;
he even seemed to be weeping a little. Finally, he vanished in
at the door, very much bent together. The undaunted David hopped
in after him coolly.</p>

<p>The admiral said, "I know your kind. You're a treasonous dog,
sir. This is mutiny. You shall be made an example of."</p>

<p>All the same he must have been ashamed of himself, for presently
he and the two others went down the steps without even looking
at me, and their carriage rolled away.</p>

<p>Inside the inn I found a couple of merchant captains, one asleep
with his head on the table and little rings shining in his great
red ears; the other very spick and span&mdash;of what they called the
new school then. His name was Williams &mdash;Captain Williams
of the <em>Lion</em>, which he part owned; a man of some note
for the dinners he gave on board his ship. His eyes sparkled blue
and very round in a round rosy face, and he clawed effusively
at my arm.</p>

<p>"Well done!" he bubbled over. "You gave it them; strike me, you
did! It did me good to see and hear. I wasn't going to poke my
nose in, not I. But I admire you, my boy."</p>

<p>He was a quite guileless man with a strong dislike for the admiral's
blundering&mdash;a dislike that all the seamen shared&mdash;and for people
of the Topnambo kidney who affected to be above his dinners. He
assured me that I had burst upon those gentry roaring... "like
the Bull of Bashan. You should have seen!" and he drank my health
in a glass of punch.</p>

<p>David Macdonald joined us, looming through wreaths of tobacco
smoke. He was always very nice in his dress, and had washed himself
into a state of enviable coolness.</p>

<p>"They won't touch me now," he said. "I wanted that assault and
battery...." He suddenly turned vivid, sarcastic black eyes upon
me. "But you," he said&mdash;"my dear Kemp! You're in a devil of a
scrape! They'll have a warrant out against you under the Black
Act. I know the gentry."</p>

<p>"Oh, he won't mind," Williams struck in, "I know him; he's a
trump. Afraid of nothing."</p>

<p>David Macdonald made a movement of his head that did duty for
an ominous shake:</p>

<p>"It's a devil of a mess," he said. "But I'll touch them up. Why
did you hit Topnambo? He's the spitefullest beast in the island.
They'll make it out high treason. They are capable of sending
you home on this charge."</p>

<p>"Oh, never say die." Williams turned to me, "Come and dine with
me on board at Kingston to-morrow night. If there's any fuss I'll
see what I can do. Or you can take a trip with me to Havana till
it blows over. My old woman's on board." His face fell. "But there,
you'll get round her. I'll see you through."</p>

<p>They drank some sangaree and became noisy. I wasn't very happy;
there was much truth in what David Macdonald had said. Topnambo
would certainly do his best to have me in jail&mdash;to make an example
of me as a Separationist to please the admiral and the Duke of
Manchester. Under the spell of his liquor Williams became more
and more pressing with his offers of help.</p>

<p>"It's the devil that my missus should be on board, just this
trip. But hang it! come and dine with me. I'll get some of the
Kingston men&mdash;the regular hot men&mdash;to stand up for you. They will
when they hear the tale."</p>

<p>There was a certain amount of sense in what he said. If warrants
were out against me, he or some of the Kingston merchants whom
he knew, and who had no cause to love the admiral, might help
me a good deal.</p>

<p>Accordingly, I did go down to Kingston. It happened to be the
day when the seven pirates were hanged at Port Royal Point. I
had never seen a hanging, and a man who hadn't was rare in those
days. I wanted to keep out of the way, but it was impossible to
get a boatman to row me off to the <em>Lion</em>. They were all
dying to see the show, and, half curious, half reluctant, I let
myself drift with the crowd.</p>

<p>The gallows themselves stood high enough to be seen&mdash;a long very
stout beam supported by posts at each end. There was a blazing
sun, and the crowd pushed and shouted and craned its thousands
of heads every time one heard the cry of "Here they come," for
an hour or so. There was a very limpid sky, a very limpid sea,
a scattering of shipping gliding up and down, and the very silent
hills a long way away. There was a large flavour of Spaniards
among the crowd. I got into the middle of a knot of them, jammed
against the wheels of one of the carriages, standing, hands down,
on tiptoe, staring at the long scaffold. There were a great many
false alarms, sudden outcries, hushing again rather slowly. In
between I could hear someone behind me talk Spanish to the occupants
of the carriage. I thought the voice was Ramon's, but I could
not turn, and the people in the carriage answered in French, I
thought. A man was shouting "Cool Drinks" on the other side of
them.</p>

<p>Finally, there was a roar, an irresistible swaying, a rattle
of musket ramrods, a rhythm of marching feet, and the grating
of heavy iron-bound wheels. Seven men appeared in sight above
the heads, clinging to each other for support, and being drawn
slowly along. The little worsted balls on the infantry shakos
bobbed all round their feet. They were a sorry-looking group,
those pirates; very wild-eyed, very ragged, dust-stained, weather-beaten,
begrimed till they had the colour of unpolished mahogany. Clinging
still to each other as they stood beneath the dangling ropes of
the long beam, they had the appearance of a group of statuary
to forlorn misery. Festoons of chains completed the "composition."</p>

<p>One was a very old man with long yellow-white hair, one a negro
whose skin had no lustre at all. The rest were very dark-skinned,
peak-bearded, and had long hair falling round their necks. A soldier
with a hammer and a small anvil climbed into the cart, and bent
down out of sight. There was a ring of iron on iron, and the man
next the very old man raised his arms and began to speak very
slowly, very distinctly, and very mournfully. It was quite easy
to understand him; he declared his perfect innocence. No one listened
to him; his name was Pedro Nones. He ceased speaking, and someone
on a horse, the High Sheriff, I think, galloped impatiently past
the cart and shouted. Two men got into the cart, one pulled the
rope, the other caught the pirate by the elbows. He jerked himself
loose, and began to cry out; he seemed to be lost in amazement,
and shrieked:</p>

<p>"<em>Adonde está el padre?... Adonde está el padre?</em>" No
one answered; there wasn't a priest of any denomination; I don't
know whether the omission was purposed. The man's face grew convulsed
with agony, his eyeballs stared out very white and vivid, as he
struggled with the two men. He began to curse us epileptically
for compassing his damnation. A hoarse patter of Spanish imprecations
came from the crowd immediately round me. The man with the voice
like Ramon's groaned in a lamentable way; someone else said, "What
infamy . . . what infamy!"</p>

<p>An aged voice said tremulously in the carriage, "This shall be
a matter of official remonstrance." Another said, "Ah, these English
heretics!"</p>

<p>There was a forward rush of the crowd, which carried me away.
Someone in front began to shout orders, and the crowd swayed back
again. The infantry muskets rattled. The commotion lasted some
time. When it ceased, I saw that the man about to die had been
kissing the very old man; tears were streaming down the gray,
parchment-coloured cheeks. Pedro Nones had the rope round his
neck; it curved upwards loosely towards the beam, growing taut
as the cart jolted away. He shouted:</p>

<p>"<em>Adiôs, viejo, para siempre adi<hr></em>"</p>

<p>My whole body seemed to go dead all over. I happened to look
downwards at my hands; they were extraordinarily white, with the
veins standing out all over them. They felt as if they had been
sodden in water, and it was quite a long time before they recovered
their natural colour. The rest of the men were hung after that,
the cart jolting a little way backwards and forwards and growing
less crowded after every journey. One man, who was very large
framed and stout, had to go through it twice because the rope
broke. He made a good deal of fuss. My head ached, and after the
involuntary straining and craning to miss no details was over,
I felt sick and dazed. The people talked a great deal as they
streamed back, loosening over the broader stretch of pebbles;
they seemed to wish to remind each other of details. I have an
idea that one or two, in the sheer largeness of heart that seizes
one after occasions of popular emotions, asked me in exulting
voices if I had seen the nigger's tongue sticking out.</p>

<p>Others thought that there wasn't very much to be exultant over.
We had not really captured the pirates; they had been handed over
to the admiral by the Havana authorities&mdash;as an international
courtesy I suppose, or else because they were pirates of no account
and short in funds, or because the admiral had been making a fuss
in front of the Morro. It was even asserted by the anti-admiral
faction that the seven weren't pirates at all, but merely Cuban
<em>mauvais sujets</em>, hawkers of derogatory <em>coplas</em>,
and known freethinkers. In any case, excited people cheered the
High Sheriff and the returning infantry, because it was pleasant
to hang any kind of Spaniard. I got nearly knocked down by the
kettle-drummers, who came through the scattering crowd at a swinging
quick-step. As I cannoned off the drums, a hand caught at my arm,
and someone else began to speak to me. It was old Ramon, who was
telling me that he had a special kind of Manchester goods at his
store. He explained that they had arrived very lately, and that
he had come from Spanish Town solely on their account. One made
the eighth of a penny a yard more on them than on any other kind.
If I would deign to have some of it offered to my inspection,
he had his little curricle just off the road. He was drawing me
gently towards it all the time, and I had not any idea of resisting.
He had been behind in the crowd, he said, beside the carriage
of the commissioner and the judge of the Marine Court sent by
the Havana authorities to deliver the pirates.</p>

<p>It was after that, that in Ramon's dusky store, I had my first
sight of Seraphina and of her father, and then came my meeting
with Carlos. I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw him come
out with extended hand. It was an extraordinary sensation, that
of talking to Carlos again. He seemed to have worn badly. His
face had lost its moist bloom, its hardly distinguishable subcutaneous
flush. It had grown very, very pale. Dark blue circles took away
from the blackness and sparkle of his eyes. And he coughed, and
coughed.</p>

<p>He put his arm affectionately round my shoulders and said, "How
splendid to see you again, my Juan." His eyes had affection in
them, there was no doubt about that, but I felt vaguely suspicious
of him. I remembered how we had parted on board the <em>Thames</em>.
"We can talk here," he added; "it is very pleasant. You shall
see my uncle, that great man, the star of Cuban law, and my cousin
Seraphina, your kinsfolk. They love you; I have spoken well of
you." He smiled gayly, and went on, "This is not a place befitting
his greatness, nor my cousin's, nor, indeed, my own." He smiled
again. "But I shall be very soon dead, and to me it matters little."
He frowned a little, and then laughed. "But you should have seen
the faces of your officers when my uncle refused to go to their
governor's palace; there was to have been a <em>fiesta</em>, a
'reception'; is it not the word? It will cause a great scandal."</p>

<p>He smiled with a good deal of fine malice, and looked as if he
expected me to be pleased. I said that I did not quite understand
what had offended his uncle.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was because there was no priest," Carlos answered, "when
those poor devils were hung. They were <em>canaille</em>. Yes;
but one gives that much even to such. And my uncle was there in
his official capacity as a a plenipotentiary. He was very much
distressed: we were all. You heard, my uncle himself had advised
their being surrendered to your English. And when there was no
priest he repented very bitterly. Why, after all, it was an infamy."</p>

<p>He paused again, and leant back against the counter. When his
eyes were upon the ground and his face not animated by talking,
there became lamentably insistent his pallor, the deep shadows
under his eyes, and infinite sadness in the droop of his features,
as if he were preoccupied by an all-pervading and hopeless grief.
When he looked at me, he smiled, however.</p>

<p>"Well, at worst it is over, and my uncle is here in this dirty
place instead of at your palace. We sail back to Cuba this very
evening." He looked round him at Ramon's calicos and sugar tubs
in the dim light, as if he accepted almost incredulously the fact
that they could be in such a place, and the manner of his voice
indicated that he thought our governor's palace would have been
hardly less barbarous. "But I am sorry," he said suddenly, "because
I wanted you&mdash;you and all your countrymen&mdash;to make a good impression
on him. You must do it yourself alone. And you will. You are not
like these others. You are our kinsman, and I have praised you
very much. You saved my life."</p>

<p>I began to say that I had done nothing at all, but he waved his
hand with a little smile.</p>

<p>"You are very brave," he said, as if to silence me. "I am not
ungrateful."</p>

<p>He began again to ask for news from home&mdash;from my home. I told
him that Veronica had a baby, and he sighed.</p>

<p>"She married the excellent Rooksby?" he asked. "Ah, what a waste."
He relapsed into silence again. "There was no woman in your land
like her. She might have<hr> And to marry that&mdash;that excellent
personage, my good cousin. It is a tragedy."</p>

<p>"It was a very good match," I answered.</p>

<p>He sighed again. "My uncle is asleep in there, now," he said,
after a pause, pointing at the inner door. "We must not wake him;
he is a very old man. You do not mind talking to me? You will
wait to see them? Dona Seraphina is here, too."</p>

<p>"You have not married your cousin?" I asked.</p>

<p>I wanted very much to see the young girl who had looked at me
for a moment, and I certainly should have been distressed if Carlos
had said she was married.</p>

<p>He answered, "What would you have?" and shrugged his shoulders
gently. A smile came into his face. "She is very willful. I did
not please her, I do not know why. Perhaps she has seen too many
men like me."</p>

<p>He told me that, when he reached Cuba, after parting with me
on the <em>Thames</em>, his uncle, "in spite of certain influences,"
had received him quite naturally as his heir, and the future head
of the family. But Seraphina, whom by the laws of convenience
he ought to have married, had quite calmly refused him.</p>

<p>"I did not impress her; she is romantic. She wanted a very bold
man, a Cid, something that it is not easy to have."</p>

<p>He paused again, and looked at me with some sort of challenge
in his eyes.</p>

<p>"She could have met no one better than you," I said.</p>

<p>He waved his hand a little. "Oh, for that<hr>" he said deprecatingly.
"Besides, I am dying. I have never been well since I went into
your cold sea, over there, after we left your sister. You remember
how I coughed on board that miserable ship."</p>

<p>I did remember it very well.</p>

<p>He went to the inner door, looked in, and then came back to me.</p>

<p>"Seraphina needs a guide&mdash;a controller&mdash;someone very strong and
gentle, and kind and brave. My uncle will never ask her to marry
against her wish; he is too old and has too little will. And for
any man who would marry her&mdash;except one&mdash;there would be great
dangers, for her and for him. It would need a cool man, and a
brave man, and a good one, too, to hazard, perhaps even life,
for her sake. She will be very rich. All our lands, all our towns,
all our gold." There was a suggestion of fabulousness in his dreamy
voice. "They shall never be mine," he added. "<em>Vaya</em>."</p>

<p>He looked at me with his piercing eyes set to an expression that
might have been gentle mockery. At any rate, it also contained
intense scrutiny, and, perhaps, a little of appeal. I sighed myself.</p>

<p>"There is a man called O'Brien in there," he said. "He does us
the honour to pretend to my cousin's hand."</p>

<p>I felt singularly angry. "Well, he's not a Spaniard," I said.</p>

<p>Carlos answered mockingly, "Oh, for Spaniard, no. He is a descendant
of the Irish kings."</p>

<p>"He's an adventurer," I said. "You ought to be on your guard.
You don't know these bog-trotting fortune-hunters. They're the
laughter of Europe, kings and all."</p>

<p>Carlos smiled again. "He's a very dangerous man for all that,"
he said. "I should not advise any one to come to Rio Medio, my
uncle's town, without making a friend of the Señor O'Brien."</p>

<p>He went once more to the inner door, and, after a moment's whispering
with someone within, returned to me.</p>

<p>"My uncle still sleeps," he said. "I must keep you a little longer.
Ah, yes, the Señor O'Brien. He shall marry my cousin, I think,
when I am dead."</p>

<p>"You don't know these fellows," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know them very well," Carlos smiled, "there are many of
them at Havana. They came there after what they call the '98,
when there was great rebellion in Ireland, and many good Catholics
were killed and ruined."</p>

<p>"Then he's a rebel, and ought to be hung," I said.</p>

<p>Carlos laughed as of old. "It may be, but, my good Juan, we Christians
do not see eye to eye with you. This man rebelled against your
government, but, also, he suffered for the true faith. He is a
good Catholic; he has suffered for it; and in the Ever Faithful
Island, that is a passport. He has climbed very high; he is a
judge of the Marine Court at Havana. That is why he is here to-day,
attending my uncle in this affair of delivering up the pirates.
My uncle loves him very much. O'Brien was at first my uncle's
clerk, and my uncle made him a <em>juez</em>, and he is also the
intendant of my uncle's estates, and he has a great influence
in my uncle's town of Rio Medio. I tell you, if you come to visit
us, it will be as well to be on good terms with the Señor Juez
O'Brien. My uncle is a very old man, and if I die before him,
this O'Brien, I think, will end by marrying my cousin, because
my poor uncle is very much in his hands. There are other pretenders,
but they have little chance, because it is so very dangerous to
come to my uncle's town of Rio Medio, on account of this man's
intrigues and of his power with the populace."</p>

<p>I looked at Carlos intently. The name of the town had seemed
to be familiar to me. Now I suddenly remembered that it was where
Nicolas el Demonio, the pirate who was so famous as to be almost
mythical, had beaten off Admiral Rowley's boats.</p>

<p>"Come, you had better see this Irish hidalgo who wants to do
us so much honour,"&mdash;he gave an inscrutable glance at me,&mdash;"but
do not talk loudly till my uncle wakes."</p>

<p>He threw the door open. I followed him into the room, where the
vision of the ancient Don and the charming apparition of the young
girl had retreated only a few moments before.</p>
