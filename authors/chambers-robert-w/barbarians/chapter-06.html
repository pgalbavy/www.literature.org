<p>It was a dirty trick that they played Stent and Brown&mdash;the three
Mysterious Sisters, Fate, Chance, and Destiny. But they’re always
billed for any performance, be it vaudeville or tragedy; and there’s
no use hissing them off: they’ll dog you from the stage entrance
if they take a fancy to you.</p>

<p>They dogged Wayland from the dock at Calais, where the mule transport
landed, all the way to Paris, then on a slow train to Quimperlé,
and then, by stagecoach, to that little lost house on the moors,
where ties held him most closely&mdash;where all he cared for in this
world was gathered under a humble roof.</p>

<p>In spite of his lameness he went duck-shooting the week after
his arrival. It was rather forcing his convalescence, but he believed
it would accelerate it to go about in the open air, as though
there were nothing the matter with his shattered leg.</p>

<p>So he hobbled down to the point he knew so well. He had longed
for the sea off Eryx. It thundered at his feet.</p>

<p>And, now, all around him through clamorous obscurity a watery
light glimmered; it edged the low-driven clouds hurrying in from
the sea; it outlined the long point of rocks thrust southward
into the smoking smother.</p>

<p>The din of the surf filled his ears; through flying patches of
mist he caught glimpses of rollers bursting white against the
reef; heard duller detonations along unseen sands, and shattering
reports where heavy waves exploded among basalt rocks.</p>

<p>His lean face of an invalid glistened with spray; salt water
dripped from cap and coat, spangled the brown barrels of his fowling-piece,
and ran down the varnished supports of both crutches where he
leaned on them, braced forward against an ever-rising wind.</p>

<p>At moments he seemed to catch glimpses of darker specks dotting
the heaving flank of some huge wave. But it was not until the
wild ducks rose through the phantom light and came whirring in
from the sea that his gun, poked stiffly skyward, flashed in the
pallid void. And then, sometimes, he hobbled back after the dead
quarry while it still drove headlong inland, slanting earthward
before the gale.</p>

<p>Once, amid the endless thundering, in the turbulent desolation
around him, through the roar of wind in his ears, he seemed to
catch deadened sounds resembling distant seaward cannonading&mdash;<em>real</em>
cannonading&mdash;as though individual shots, dully distinct, dominated
for a few moments the unbroken uproar of surf and gale.</p>

<p>He listened, straining his ears, alert, intent upon the sounds
he ought to recognize&mdash;the sounds he knew so well.</p>

<p>Only the ceaseless pounding of the sea assailed his ears.</p>

<p>Three wild duck, widgeon, came speeding through the fog; he breasted
the wind, balanced heavily on both crutches and one leg, and shoved
his gun upward.</p>

<p>At the same instant the mist in front and overhead became noisy
with wild fowl, rising in one great, panic-stricken, clamoring
cloud. He hesitated; a muffled, thudding sound came to him over
the unseen sea, growing louder, nearer, dominating the gale, increasing
to a rattling clatter.</p>

<p>Suddenly a great cloudy shape loomed up through the whirling
mist ahead&mdash;an enormous shadow in the fog&mdash;a gigantic spectre
rushing inland on vast and ghostly pinions.</p>

<p>As the man shrank on his crutches, looking up, the aëroplane
swept past overhead&mdash;a wounded, wavering, unsteady, unbalanced
thing, its right aileron dangling, half stripped, and almost mangled
to a skeleton.</p>

<p>Already it was slanting lower toward the forest like a hard-hit
duck, wing-crippled, fighting desperately for flight-power to
the very end. Then the inland mist engulfed it.</p>

<p>And after it hobbled Wayland, painfully, two brace of dead ducks
and his slung fowling piece bobbing on his back, his rubber-shod
crutches groping and probing among drenched rocks and gullies
full of kelp, his left leg in splints hanging heavily.</p>

<p>He could not go fast; he could not go very far. Further inland,
foggy gorse gave place to broom and blighted bracken, all wet,
sagging with rain. Then he crossed a swale of brown reeds and
tussock set with little pools of water, opaque and grey in the
rain.</p>

<p>Where the outer moors narrowed he turned westward; then a strip
of low, thorn-clad cliff confronted him, up which he toiled along
a V-shaped cleft choked with ferns.</p>

<p>The spectral forest of Läis lay just beyond, its wind-tortured
branches tossing under a leaden sky.</p>

<p>East and west lonely moors stretched away into the depths of
the mist; southward spread the sea; to the north lay the wide
woods of Läis, equally deserted now in this sad and empty land.</p>

<p>He hobbled to the edge of the forest and stood knee deep in discoloured
ferns, listening. The sombre beech-woods spread thick on either
hand, a wilderness of crossed limbs and meshed branches to which
still clung great clots of dull brown leaves.</p>

<p>He listened, peering into sinister, grey depths. In the uncertain
light nothing stirred except the clashing branches overhead; there
was no sound except the wind’s flowing roar and the ghostly noise
of his own voice, hallooing through the solitude&mdash;a voice in the
misty void that seemed to carry less sound than the straining
cry of a sleeper in his dreams.</p>

<p>If the aëroplane had landed, there was no sign here. How far
had it struggled on, sheering the tree-tops, before it fell?&mdash;if
indeed it had fallen somewhere in the wood’s grey depths?</p>

<p>As long as he had sufficient strength he prowled along the forest,
entering it here and there, calling, listening, searching the
foggy corridors of trees. The rotting brake crackled underfoot;
the tree tops clashed and creaked above him.</p>

<p>At last, having only enough strength left to take him home, he
turned away, limping through the blotched and broken ferns, his
crippled leg hanging stiffly in its splints, his gun and the dead
ducks bobbing on his back.</p>

<p>The trodden way was soggy with little pools full of drenched
grasses and dead leaves; but at length came rising ground, and
the blue-green, glimmering wastes of gorse stretching away before
him through the curtained fog.</p>

<p>A sheep path ran through; and after a little while a few trees
loomed shadowy in the mist, and a low stone house took shape,
whitewashed, flanked by barn, pigpen, and a stack of rotting seaweed.</p>

<p>A few wet hens wandered aimlessly by the doorstep; a tiny bed
of white clove-pinks and tall white phlox exhaled a homely welcome
as the lame man hobbled up the steps, pulled the leather latchstring,
and entered.</p>

<p>In the kitchen an old Breton woman, chopping herbs, looked up
at him out of aged eyes, shaking her head under its white coiffe.</p>

<p>"It is nearly noon," she said. "You have been out since dawn.
Was it wise, for a convalescent, Monsieur Jacques?"</p>

<p>"Very wise, Marie-Josephine. Because the more exercise I take
the sooner I shall be able to go back."</p>

<p>"It is too soon to go out in such weather."</p>

<p>"Ducks fly inland only in such weather," he retorted, smiling.
"And we like roast widgeon, you and I, Marie-Josephine."</p>

<p>And all the while her aged blue eyes were fixed on him, and over
her withered cheeks the soft bloom came and faded&mdash;that pretty
colour which Breton women usually retain until the end.</p>

<p>"Thou knowest, Monsieur Jacques," she said, with a curiously
quaint mingling of familiarity and respect, "that I do not counsel
caution because I love thee and dread for thee again the trenches.
But with thy leg hanging there like the broken wing of a <em>vanneau</em>&#11834;"</p>

<p>He replied good humouredly:</p>

<p>"Thou dost not know the Legion, Marie-Josephine. Every day in
our trenches we break a comrade into pieces and glue him together
again, just to make him tougher. Broken bones, once mended, are
stronger than before."</p>

<p>He was looking down at her where she sat by the hearth, slicing
vegetables and herbs, but watching him all the while out of her
lovely, faded eyes.</p>

<p>"I understand, Monsieur Jacques, that you are like your father
&mdash;God knows he was hardy and without fear&mdash;to the last"&mdash;she
dropped her head&mdash;"Mary, glorious&mdash;intercede&mdash;" she muttered over
her bowl of herbs.</p>

<p>Wayland, resting on his crutches, unslung his ducks, laid them
on the table, smoothed their beautiful heads and breasts, then
slipped the soaking <em>bandoulière</em> of his gun from his shoulder
and placed the dripping piece against the chimney corner.</p>

<p>"After I have scrubbed myself," he said, "and have put on dry
clothes, I shall come to luncheon; and I shall have something
very strange to tell you, Marie-Josephine."</p>

<p>He limped away into one of the two remaining rooms&mdash;the other
was hers&mdash;and closed his door.</p>

<p>Marie-Josephine continued to prepare the soup. There was an egg
for him, too; and a slice of cold pork and a <em>brioche</em>
and a jug of cider.</p>

<p>In his room Wayland was whistling "Tipperary."</p>

<p>Now and again, pausing in her work, she turned her eyes to his
closed door&mdash;wonderful eyes that became miracles of tenderness
as she listened.</p>

<p>He came out, presently, dressed in his odd, ill-fitting uniform
of the Legion, tunic unbuttoned, collarless of shirt, his bright,
thick hair, now of decent length, in boyish disorder.</p>

<p>Delicious odours of soup and of Breton cider greeted him; he
seated himself; Marie-Josephine waited on him, hovered over him,
tucked a sack of feathers under his maimed leg, placed his crutches
in the corner beside the gun.</p>

<p>Still eating, leisurely, he began:</p>

<p>"Marie-Josephine&mdash;a strange thing has happened on Quesnel Moors
which troubles me.... Listen attentively. It was while waiting
for ducks on the Eryx Rocks, that once I thought I heard through
the roar of wind and sea the sound of a far cannonading. But I
said to myself that it was only the imagination of a haunted mind;
that in my ears still thundered the cannonade of Lens."</p>

<p>"Was it nevertheless true?" She had turned around from the fire
where her own soup simmered in the kettle. As she spoke again
she rose and came to the table.</p>

<p>He said: "It must have been cannon that I heard. Because, not
long afterward, out of the fog came a great aëroplane rushing
inland from the sea&mdash;flying swiftly above me&mdash;right over me!&mdash;and
staggering like a wounded duck&mdash;it had one aileron broken&mdash;and
sheered away into the fog, northward, Marie-Josephine."</p>

<p>Her work-worn hands, tightly clenched, rested now on the table
and she leaned there, looking down at him.</p>

<p>"Was it an enemy&mdash;this airship, Jacques?"</p>

<p>"In the mist flying and the ragged clouds I could not tell. It
might have been English. It must have been, I think&mdash;coming as
it came from the sea. But I am troubled, Marie-Josephine. Were
the guns at sea an enemy’s guns? Did the aëroplane come to earth
in safety? Where? In the Forest of Laïs? I found no trace of it."</p>

<p>She said, tremulous perhaps from standing too long motionless
and intent:</p>

<p>"Is it possible that the Boches would come into these solitary
moors, where there are no people any more, only the creatures
of the Laïs woods, and the curlew and the lapwings which pass
at evening?"</p>

<p>He ate thoughtfully and in silence for a while; then:</p>

<p>"They go, usually&mdash;the Boches&mdash;where there is plunder&mdash;murder
to be done.... Spying to be done.... God knows what purpose animates
the Huns.... After all, Lorient is not so far away.... Yet it
surely must have been an English aëroplane, beaten off by some
enemy ship&mdash;a submarine perhaps. God send that the rocks of the
Isle des Chouans take care of her&mdash;with their teeth!"</p>

<p>He drank his cider&mdash;a sip or two only&mdash;then, setting aside the
glass:</p>

<p>"I went from the Rocks of Eryx to Laïs Woods. I called as loudly
as I could; the wind whirled my voice back into my throat....
I am not yet very strong....</p>

<p>"Then I went into the wood as far as my strength permitted. I
heard and saw nothing, Marie-Josephine."</p>

<p>"Would they be dead?" she asked.</p>

<p>"They were planing to earth. I don’t know how much control they
had, whether they could steer&mdash;choose a landing place. There are
plenty of safe places on these moors."</p>

<p>"If their airship is crippled, what can they do, these English
flying men, out there on the moors in the rain and wind? When
the coast guard passes we must tell him."</p>

<p>"After lunch I shall go out again as far as my strength allows....
If the rain would cease and the mist lift, one might see something&mdash;be
of some use, perhaps&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Ought you to go, Monsieur Jacques?"</p>

<p>"Could I fail to try to find them &mdash;Englishmen&mdash;and perhaps
injured? Surely I should go, Marie-Josephine."</p>

<p>"The coast guard&#11834;"</p>

<p>"He passed the Eryx Rocks at daylight. He is at Sainte-Ylva now.
Tonight, when I see his comrade’s lantern, I shall stop him and
report. But in the meanwhile I must go out and search."</p>

<p>"Spare thyself&mdash;for the trenches, Jacques. Remain indoors today."
She began to unpin the coiffe which she always wore ceremoniously
at meals when he was present.</p>

<p>He smiled: "Thou knowest I must go, Marie-Josephine."</p>

<p>"And if thou come upon them in the forest and they are Huns?"</p>

<p>He laughed: "They are English, I tell thee, Marie-Josephine!"</p>

<p>She nodded; under her breath, staring at the rain-lashed window:
"Like thy father, thou must go forth," she muttered; "go always
where thy spirit calls. And once <em>he</em> went. And came no
more. And God help us all in Finistère, where all are born to
grief."</p>
