<p>The morning after gentle Sister South Wind arrived on the Green
Meadows, Peter Rabbit came hopping and skipping down the Lone
Little Path from the Green Forest. Peter was happy. He didn't
know why. He just was happy. It was in the air. Everybody else
seemed happy, too. Peter had to stop every few minutes just to
kick up his heels and try to jump over his own shadow. He had
felt just that way ever since gentle Sister South Wind arrived.</p>

"I simply have to kick and dance!<br/>
&nbsp;I cannot help but gaily prance!<br/>
&nbsp;Somehow I feel it in my toes<br/>
&nbsp;Whenever gentle South Wind blows."

<p>So sang Peter Rabbit as he hopped and skipped down the Lone Little
Path. Suddenly he stopped right in the middle of the verse. He
sat up very straight and stared down at Johnny Chuck's house.
Some one was sitting on Johnny Chuck's door-step. It looked like
Johnny Chuck. No, it looked like the shadow of Johnny Chuck. Peter
rubbed his eyes and looked again. Then he hurried as fast as he
could, lipperty-lipperty-lip. The nearer he got, the less like
Johnny Chuck looked the one sitting on Johnny Chuck's door-step.
Johnny Chuck had gone to sleep round and fat and roly-poly, so
fat he could hardly waddle. This fellow was thin, even thinner
than Peter Rabbit himself. He waved a thin hand to Peter.</p>

<p>"Hello, Peter Rabbit! I told you that I would see you in the
spring. How did you stand the long winter?"</p>

<p>That certainly was Johnny Chuck's voice. Peter was so delighted
that in his hurry he fell over his own feet. "Is it really and
truly you, Johnny Chuck?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Of course it's me; who did you think it was?" replied Johnny
Chuck rather crossly, for Peter was staring at him as if he had
never seen him before.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;I &</em>mdash;I didn't know," confessed Peter Rabbit.
"I thought it was you and I thought it wasn't you. What have you
been doing to yourself, Johnny Chuck? Your coat looks three sizes
too big for you, and when I last saw you it didn't look big enough."
Peter hopped all around Johnny Chuck, looking at him as if he
didn't believe his own eyes.</p>

<p>{Illustration: "Is it really and truly you, Johnny Chuck?" he
cried.}</p>

<p>"Oh, Johnny's all right. He's just been living on his own fat,"
said another voice. It was Jimmy Skunk who had spoken, and he
now stood holding out his hand to Johnny Chuck and grinning good-naturedly.
He had come up without either of the others seeing him.</p>

<p>Peter's big eyes opened wider than ever. "Do you mean to say
that he has been eating his own fat?" he gasped.</p>

<p>Johnny Chuck and Jimmy Skunk both laughed. "No," said Jimmy Skunk,
"he didn't eat it, but he lived on it just the same while he was
asleep all winter. Don't you see he hasn't got a particle of fat
on him now?"</p>

<p>"But how could he live on it, if he didn't eat it?" asked Peter,
staring at Johnny Chuck as if he had never seen him before.</p>

<p>Jimmy Skunk shrugged his shoulders. "Don't ask me. That is one
of Old Mother Nature's secrets; you'll have to ask her," he replied.</p>

<p>"And don't ask me," said Johnny Chuck, "for I've been asleep
all the time. My, but I'm hungry!"</p>

<p>"So am I!" said another voice. There was Reddy Fox grinning at
them. Johnny Chuck dove into the doorway of his house with Peter
Rabbit at his heels, for there was nowhere else to go. Jimmy Skunk
just stood still and chuckled. He knew that Reddy Fox didn't dare
touch him.</p>
