<P>But poor Rosa, in her secluded chamber, could not have known 
of whom or of what Cornelius was dreaming.</P>
<P>From what he had said she was more ready to believe that he 
dreamed of the black tulip than of her; and yet Rosa was 
mistaken.</P>
<P>But as there was no one to tell her so, and as the words of 
Cornelius's thoughtless speech had fallen upon her heart 
like drops of poison, she did not dream, but she wept.</P>
<P>The fact was, that, as Rosa was a high-spirited creature, of 
no mean perception and a noble heart, she took a very clear 
and judicious view of her own social position, if not of her 
moral and physical qualities.</P>
<P>Cornelius was a scholar, and was wealthy,  -  at least he had 
been before the confiscation of his property; Cornelius 
belonged to the merchant-bourgeoisie, who were prouder of 
their richly emblazoned shop signs than the hereditary 
nobility of their heraldic bearings. Therefore, although he 
might find Rosa a pleasant companion for the dreary hours of 
his captivity, when it came to a question of bestowing his 
heart it was almost certain that he would bestow it upon a 
tulip,  -  that is to say, upon the proudest and noblest of 
flowers, rather than upon poor Rosa, the jailer's lowly 
child.</P>
<P>Thus Rosa understood Cornelius's preference of the tulip to 
herself, but was only so much the more unhappy therefor.</P>
<P>During the whole of this terrible night the poor girl did 
not close an eye, and before she rose in the morning she had 
come to the resolution of making her appearance at the 
grated window no more.</P>
<P>But as she knew with what ardent desire Cornelius looked 
forward to the news about his tulip; and as, notwithstanding 
her determination not to see any more a man her pity for 
whose fate was fast growing into love, she did not, on the 
other hand, wish to drive him to despair, she resolved to 
continue by herself the reading and writing lessons; and, 
fortunately, she had made sufficient progress to dispense 
with the help of a master when the master was not to be 
Cornelius.</P>
<P>Rosa therefore applied herself most diligently to reading 
poor Cornelius de Witt's Bible, on the second fly leaf of 
which the last will of Cornelius van Baerle was written.</P>
<P>&quot;Alas!&quot; she muttered, when perusing again this document, 
which she never finished without a tear, the pearl of love, 
rolling from her limpid eyes on her pale cheeks  -  &quot;alas! at 
that time I thought for one moment he loved me.&quot;</P>
<P>Poor Rosa! she was mistaken. Never had the love of the 
prisoner been more sincere than at the time at which we are 
now arrived, when in the contest between the black tulip and 
Rosa the tulip had had to yield to her the first and 
foremost place in Cornelius's heart.</P>
<P>But Rosa was not aware of it.</P>
<P>Having finished reading, she took her pen, and began with as 
laudable diligence the by far more difficult task of 
writing.</P>
<P>As, however, Rosa was already able to write a legible hand 
when Cornelius so uncautiously opened his heart, she did not 
despair of progressing quickly enough to write, after eight 
days at the latest, to the prisoner an account of his tulip.</P>
<P>She had not forgotten one word of the directions given to 
her by Cornelius, whose speeches she treasured in her heart, 
even when they did not take the shape of directions.</P>
<P>He, on his part, awoke deeper in love than ever. The tulip, 
indeed, was still a luminous and prominent object in his 
mind; but he no longer looked upon it as a treasure to which 
he ought to sacrifice everything, and even Rosa, but as a 
marvellous combination of nature and art with which he would 
have been happy to adorn the bosom of his beloved one.</P>
<P>Yet during the whole of that day he was haunted with a vague 
uneasiness, at the bottom of which was the fear lest Rosa 
should not come in the evening to pay him her usual visit. 
This thought took more and more hold of him, until at the 
approach of evening his whole mind was absorbed in it.</P>
<P>How his heart beat when darkness closed in! The words which 
he had said to Rosa on the evening before and which had so 
deeply afflicted her, now came back to his mind more vividly 
than ever, and he asked himself how he could have told his 
gentle comforter to sacrifice him to his tulip,  -  that is 
to say, to give up seeing him, if need be,  -  whereas to him 
the sight of Rosa had become a condition of life.</P>
<P>In Cornelius's cell one heard the chimes of the clock of the 
fortress. It struck seven, it struck eight, it struck nine. 
Never did the metal voice vibrate more forcibly through the 
heart of any man than did the last stroke, marking the ninth 
hour, through the heart of Cornelius.</P>
<P>All was then silent again. Cornelius put his hand on his 
heart, to repress as it were its violent palpitation, and 
listened.</P>
<P>The noise of her footstep, the rustling of her gown on the 
staircase, were so familiar to his ear, that she had no 
sooner mounted one step than he used to say to himself,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Here comes Rosa.&quot;</P>
<P>This evening none of those little noises broke the silence 
of the lobby, the clock struck nine, and a quarter; the 
half-hour, then a quarter to ten, and at last its deep tone 
announced, not only to the inmates of the fortress, but also 
to all the inhabitants of Loewestein, that it was ten.</P>
<P>This was the hour at which Rosa generally used to leave 
Cornelius. The hour had struck, but Rosa had not come.</P>
<P>Thus then his foreboding had not deceived him; Rosa, being 
vexed, shut herself up in her room and left him to himself.</P>
<P>&quot;Alas!&quot; he thought, &quot;I have deserved all this. She will come 
no more, and she is right in staying away; in her place I 
should do just the same.&quot;</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding all this, Cornelius listened, waited, 
and hoped until midnight, then he threw himself upon the 
bed, with his clothes on.</P>
<P>It was a long and sad night for him, and the day brought no 
hope to the prisoner.</P>
<P>At eight in the morning, the door of his cell opened; but 
Cornelius did not even turn his head; he had heard the heavy 
step of Gryphus in the lobby, but this step had perfectly 
satisfied the prisoner that his jailer was coming alone.</P>
<P>Thus Cornelius did not even look at Gryphus.</P>
<P>And yet he would have been so glad to draw him out, and to 
inquire about Rosa. He even very nearly made this inquiry, 
strange as it would needs have appeared to her father. To 
tell the truth, there was in all this some selfish hope to 
hear from Gryphus that his daughter was ill.</P>
<P>Except on extraordinary occasions, Rosa never came during 
the day. Cornelius therefore did not really expect her as 
long as the day lasted. Yet his sudden starts, his listening 
at the door, his rapid glances at every little noise towards 
the grated window, showed clearly that the prisoner 
entertained some latent hope that Rosa would, somehow or 
other, break her rule.</P>
<P>At the second visit of Gryphus, Cornelius, contrary to all 
his former habits, asked the old jailer, with the most 
winning voice, about her health; but Gryphus contented 
himself with giving the laconical answer,  - </P>
<P>&quot;All's well.&quot;</P>
<P>At the third visit of the day, Cornelius changed his former 
inquiry:  - </P>
<P>&quot;I hope nobody is ill at Loewestein?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nobody,&quot; replied, even more laconically, the jailer, 
shutting the door before the nose of the prisoner.</P>
<P>Gryphus, being little used to this sort of civility on the 
part of Cornelius, began to suspect that his prisoner was 
about to try and bribe him.</P>
<P>Cornelius was now alone once more; it was seven o'clock in 
the evening, and the anxiety of yesterday returned with 
increased intensity.</P>
<P>But another time the hours passed away without bringing the 
sweet vision which lighted up, through the grated window, 
the cell of poor Cornelius, and which, in retiring, left 
light enough in his heart to last until it came back again.</P>
<P>Van Baerle passed the night in an agony of despair. On the 
following day Gryphus appeared to him even more hideous, 
brutal, and hateful than usual; in his mind, or rather in 
his heart, there had been some hope that it was the old man 
who prevented his daughter from coming.</P>
<P>In his wrath he would have strangled Gryphus, but would not 
this have separated him for ever from Rosa?</P>
<P>The evening closing in, his despair changed into melancholy, 
which was the more gloomy as, involuntarily, Van Baerle 
mixed up with it the thought of his poor tulip. It was now 
just that week in April which the most experienced gardeners 
point out as the precise time when tulips ought to be 
planted. He had said to Rosa,  - </P>
<P>&quot;I shall tell you the day when you are to put the bulb in 
the ground.&quot;</P>
<P>He had intended to fix, at the vainly hoped for interview, 
the following day as the time for that momentous operation. 
The weather was propitious; the air, though still damp, 
began to be tempered by those pale rays of the April sun 
which, being the first, appear so congenial, although so 
pale. How if Rosa allowed the right moment for planting the 
bulb to pass by,  -  if, in addition to the grief of seeing 
her no more, he should have to deplore the misfortune of 
seeing his tulip fail on account of its having been planted 
too late, or of its not having been planted at all!</P>
<P>These two vexations combined might well make him leave off 
eating and drinking.</P>
<P>This was the case on the fourth day.</P>
<P>It was pitiful to see Cornelius, dumb with grief, and pale 
from utter prostration, stretch out his head through the 
iron bars of his window, at the risk of not being able to 
draw it back again, to try and get a glimpse of the garden 
on the left spoken of by Rosa, who had told him that its 
parapet overlooked the river. He hoped that perhaps he might 
see, in the light of the April sun, Rosa or the tulip, the 
two lost objects of his love.</P>
<P>In the evening, Gryphus took away the breakfast and dinner 
of Cornelius, who had scarcely touched them.</P>
<P>On the following day he did not touch them at all, and 
Gryphus carried the dishes away just as he had brought them.</P>
<P>Cornelius had remained in bed the whole day.</P>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot; said Gryphus, coming down from the last visit, &quot;I 
think we shall soon get rid of our scholar.&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa was startled.</P>
<P>&quot;Nonsense!&quot; said Jacob. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He doesn't drink, he doesn't eat, he doesn't leave his bed. 
He will get out of it, like Mynheer Grotius, in a chest, 
only the chest will be a coffin.&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa grew pale as death.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah!&quot; she said to herself, &quot;he is uneasy about his tulip.&quot;</P>
<P>And, rising with a heavy heart, she returned to her chamber, 
where she took a pen and paper, and during the whole of that 
night busied herself with tracing letters.</P>
<P>On the following morning, when Cornelius got up to drag 
himself to the window, he perceived a paper which had been 
slipped under the door.</P>
<P>He pounced upon it, opened it, and read the following words, 
in a handwriting which he could scarcely have recognized as 
that of Rosa, so much had she improved during her short 
absence of seven days,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Be easy; your tulip is going on well.&quot;</P>
<P>Although these few words of Rosa's somewhat soothed the 
grief of Cornelius, yet he felt not the less the irony which 
was at the bottom of them. Rosa, then, was not ill, she was 
offended; she had not been forcibly prevented from coming, 
but had voluntarily stayed away. Thus Rosa, being at 
liberty, found in her own will the force not to come and see 
him, who was dying with grief at not having seen her.</P>
<P>Cornelius had paper and a pencil which Rosa had brought to 
him. He guessed that she expected an answer, but that she 
would not come before the evening to fetch it. He therefore 
wrote on a piece of paper, similar to that which he had 
received,  - </P>
<P>&quot;It was not my anxiety about the tulip that has made me ill, 
but the grief at not seeing you.&quot;</P>
<P>After Gryphus had made his last visit of the day, and 
darkness had set in, he slipped the paper under the door, 
and listened with the most intense attention, but he neither 
heard Rosa's footsteps nor the rustling of her gown.</P>
<P>He only heard a voice as feeble as a breath, and gentle like 
a caress, which whispered through the grated little window 
in the door the word,  - </P>
<P>&quot;To-morrow!&quot;</P>
<P>Now to-morrow was the eighth day. For eight days Cornelius 
and Rosa had not seen each other. </P></div>
