I came to live in London, as I shall tell you, when I was nearly
twenty-two.  Wimblehurst dwindles in perspective, is now in this
book a little place far off, Bladesover no more than a small
pinkish speck of frontage among the distant Kentish hills; the
scene broadens out, becomes multitudinous and limitless, full of
the sense of vast irrelevant movement.  I do not remember my
second coming to London as I do my first, for my early
impressions, save that an October memory of softened amber
sunshine stands out, amber sunshine falling on grey house fronts
I know not where.  That, and a sense of a large tranquillity.
<P>
I could fill a book, I think, with a more or less imaginary
account of how I came to apprehend London, how first in one
aspect and then in another it grew in my mind.  Each day my
accumulating impressions were added to and qualified and brought
into relationship with new ones; they fused inseparably with
others that were purely personal and accidental.  I find myself
with a certain comprehensive perception of London, complete
indeed, incurably indistinct in places and yet in some way a
whole that began with my first visit and is still being mellowed
and enriched.
<P>
London!
<P>
At first, no doubt, it was a chaos of streets and people and
buildings and reasonless going to and fro.  I do not remember
that I ever struggled very steadily to understand it, or explored
it with any but a personal and adventurous intention.  Yet in
time there has grown up in me a kind of theory of London; I do
think I see lines of an ordered structure out of which it has
grown, detected a process that is something more than a confusion
of casual accidents though indeed it may be no more than a
process of disease.
<P>
I said at the outset of my first book that I find in Bladesover
the clue to all England.  Well, I certainly imagine it is the
clue to the structure of London.  There have been no revolutions
no deliberate restatements or abandonments of opinion in England
since the days of the fine gentry, since 1688 or thereabouts, the
days when Bladesover was built; there have been changes,
dissolving forest replacing forest, if you will; but then it was
that the broad lines of the English system set firmly.  And as I
have gone to and fro in London in certain regions constantly the
thought has recurred this is Bladesover House, this answers to
Bladesover House.  The fine gentry may have gone; they have
indeed largely gone, I think; rich merchants may have replaced
them, financial adventurers or what not.  That does not matter;
the shape is still Bladesover.
<P>
I am most reminded of Bladesover and Eastry by all those regions
round about the West End parks; for example, estate parks, each
more or less in relation to a palace or group of great houses. 
The roads and back ways of Mayfair and all about St. James's
again, albeit perhaps of a later growth in point of time, were of
the very spirit and architectural texture of the Bladesover
passages and yards; they had the same smells, the space, the
large cleanest and always going to and fro where one met
unmistakable Olympians and even more unmistakable valets,
butlers, footmen in mufti. There were moments when I seemed to
glimpse down areas the white panelling, the very chintz of my
mother's room again.
<P>
I could trace out now on a map what I would call the Great-House
region; passing south-westward into Belgravia, becoming diffused
and sporadic westward, finding its last systematic outbreak round
and about Regent's Park.  The Duke of Devonshire's place in
Piccadilly, in all its insolent ugliness, pleases me
particularly; it is the quintessence of the thing; Apsley House
is all in the manner of my theory, Park Lane has its quite
typical mansions, and they run along the border of the Green Park
and St. James's.  And I struck out a truth one day in Cromwell
Road quite suddenly,  as I looked over the Natural History Museum
"By Jove," said I "but this is the little assemblage of cases of
stuffed birds and animals upon the Bladesover staircase grown
enormous, and yonder as the corresponding thing to the
Bladesover curios and porcelain is the Art Museume and there in
the little observatories in Exhibition Road is old Sir Cuthbert's
Gregorian telescope that I hunted out in the storeroom and put
together."   And diving into the Art Museum under this
inspiration, I came to a little reading-room and found as I had
inferred, old brown books!
<P>
It was really a good piece of social comparative anatomy I did
that day; all these museums and libraries that are dotted over
London between Piccadilly and West Kensington, and indeed the
museum and library movement throughout the world, sprang from the
elegant leisure of the gentlemen of taste.  Theirs were the.
first libraries, the first houses of culture; by my rat-like
raids into the Bladesover saloon I became, as it were, the last
dwindled representative of such a man of letters as Swift.  But
now these things have escaped out of the Great House altogether,
and taken on a strange independent life of their own.
<P>
It is this idea of escaping parts from the seventeenth century
system of Bladesover, of proliferating and overgrowing elements
from the Estates, that to this day seems to me the best
explanation, not simply of London, but of all England.  England
is a country of great Renascence landed gentlefolk who have been
unconsciously  outgrown and overgrown.  The proper shops for
Bladesover custom were still to be found in Regent Street and
Bond Street in my early London days in those days they had been
but lightly touched by the American's profaning hand--and in
Piccadilly.  I found the doctor's house of the country village or
country town up and down Harley Street, multiplied but not
otherwise different, and the family solicitor (by the hundred)
further eastward in the abandoned houses of a previous generation
of gentlepeople, and down in Westminster, behind Palladian
fronts, the public offices sheltered in large Bladesoverish rooms
and looked out on St. James's Park.  The Parliament Houses of
lords and gentlemen, the parliament house that was horrified when
merchants and brewers came thrusting into it a hundred years ago,
stood out upon its terrace gathering the whole system together
into a head.
<P>
And the more I have paralleled these things with my
Bladesover-Eastry model, the more evident it has become to me
that the balance is not the same, and the more evident is the
presence of great new forces, blind forces of invasion, of
growth.  The railway termini on the north side of London have
been kept as remote as Eastry had kept the railway-station from
Wimblehurst, they stop on the very outskirts of the estates, but
from the south, the South Eastern railway had butted its great
stupid rusty iron head of Charing Cross station, that great head
that came smashing down in 1905--clean across the river, between
Somerset House and Whitehall.  The south side had no protecting
estate.  Factory chimneys smoke right over against Westminster
with an air of carelessly not having permission, and the whole
effect of industrial London and of all London east of Temple Bar
and of the huge dingy immensity of London port is to me of
something disproportionately large, something morbidly expanded,
without plan or intention, dark and sinister toward the clean
clear social assurance of the West End.  And south of this
central London, south-east, south-west, far west, north-west, all
round the northern hills, are similar disproportionate growths,
endless streets of undistinguished houses, undistinguished 
industries, shabby families, second-rate shops, inexplicable
people who in a once fashionable phrase do not "exist."  All
these aspects have suggested to my mind at times, do suggest to
this day, the unorganised, abundant substance of some tumorous
growth-process, a process which indeed bursts all the outlines of
the affected carcass and protrudes such masses as ignoble
comfortable Croydon, as tragic impoverished West Ham.  To this
day I ask myself will those masses ever become structural, will
they indeed shape into anything new whatever, or is that
cancerous image their true and ultimate diagnosis?...
<P>
Moreover, together with this hypertrophy there is an immigration
of elements that have never understood and never will understand
the great tradition, wedges of foreign settlement embedded in the
heart of this yeasty English expansion.  One day I remember
wandering  eastward out of pure curiosity--it must have been in
my early student days--and discovering a shabbily bright foreign
quarter, shops displaying Hebrew placards and weird, unfamiliar
commodities and a concourse of bright-eyed, eagle-nosed people
talking some incomprehensible gibberish between the shops and
the barrows.  And soon I became quite familiar with the devious. 
vicious, dirtily-pleasant eroticism of Soho.  I found those
crowded streets a vast relief from the dull grey exterior of
Brompton where I lodged and lived my daily life.  In Soho,
indeed, I got my first inkling of the factor of replacement that
is so important in both the English and the American process.
<P>
Even in the West End, in Mayfair and the square, about Pall Mall,
Ewart was presently to remind me the face of the old aristocratic
dignity was fairer than its substance; here were actors and
actresses, here money lenders and Jews, here bold financial
adventurers, and I thought of my uncle's frayed cuff as he
pointed out this house in Park Lane and that.  That was so and
so's who made a corner in borax, and that palace belonged to that
hero among modern adventurers, Barmentrude, who used to be an
I.D.B.,--an illicit diamond buyer that is to say.  A city of
Bladesovers, the capital of a kingdom of Bladesovers, all much
shaken and many altogether in decay, parasitically occupied,
insidiously replaced by alien, unsympathetic and irresponsible
elements;  and with a ruling an adventitious and miscellaneous
empire of a quarter of this daedal earth complex laws,
intricate social necessities, disturbing insatiable suggestions,
followed from this.  Such was the world into which I had come,
into which I had in some way to thrust myself and fit my problem,
my temptations, my efforts, my patriotic instinct, all my moral
instincts, my physical appetites, my dreams and my sanity.
<P>
London! I came up to it, young and without advisers, rather
priggish, rather dangerously open-minded and very open-eyed, and
with something--it is, I think, the common gift of imaginative
youth, and I claim it unblushingly--fine in me, finer than the
world and seeking fine responses.  I did not want simply to live
or simply to live happily or well; I wanted to serve and do and
make--with some nobility.  It was in me.  It is in half the youth
of the world.
<P>
II
<P>
I had come to London as a scholar.  I had taken the Vincent
Bradley scholarship of the Pharmaceutical Society, but I threw
this up when I found that my work of the Science and Art
Department in mathematics, physics and chemistry had given me one
of the minor Technical Board Scholarships at the Consolidated 
Technical Schools at South Kensington.  This latter was in
mechanics and metallurgy; and I hesitated between the two.  The
Vincent Bradley gave me L70 a year and quite the best start-off a
pharmaceutical chemist could have; the South Kensington thing was
worth about twenty-two shillings a week, and the prospects it
opened were vague.  But it meant far more scientific work than
the former, and I was still under the impulse of that great
intellectual appetite that is part of the adolescence of men of
my type.  Moreover it seemed to lead towards engineering, in
which I imagined--I imagine to this day--my particular use is to
be found.  I took its greater uncertainty as a fair risk.  I came
up very keen, not doubting that the really hard and steady
industry that had carried me through Wimblehurst would go on
still in the new surroundings.
<P>
Only from the very first it didn't....
<P>
When I look back now at my Wimblehurst days, I still find myself
surprised at the amount of steady grinding study, of strenuous
self-discipline that I maintained  throughout my apprenticeship. 
In many ways I think that time was the most honourable period in
my life.  I wish I could say with a certain mind that my motives
in working so well were large and honourable too.  To a certain
extent they were so; there was a fine sincere curiosity, a desire
for the strength and power of scientific knowledge and a passion
for intellectual  exercise; but I do not think those forces alone
would have kept me at it so grimly and closely if Wimblehurst 
had not been so dull, so limited and so observant.  Directly I
came into the London atmosphere, tasting freedom, tasting
irresponsibility and the pull of new forces altogether, my
discipline fell from me like a garment.  Wimblehurst to a
youngster in my position offered no temptations worth counting,
no interests to conflict with study, no vices--such vices as it
offered were coarsely stripped of any imaginative glamourfull 
drunkenness, clumsy leering shameful lust, no social intercourse
even to waste one's time, and on the other hand it would minister
greatly to the self-esteem of a conspicuously industrious
student.  One was marked as "clever," one played up to the part,
and one's little accomplishment stood out finely in one's private
reckoning  against the sunlit small ignorance of that agreeable
place.  One went with an intent rush across the market square,
one took one's exercise with as dramatic a sense of an ordered
day as an Oxford don, one burnt the midnight oil quite
consciously at the rare respectful, benighted  passer-by.  And
one stood out finely in the local paper with one's unapproachable
yearly harvest of certificates.  Thus I was not only a genuinely
keen student, but also a little of a prig and poseur in those
days--and the latter kept the former at it, as London made clear.
<P>
Moreover Wimblehurst had given me no outlet in any other
direction.
<P>
But I did not realise all this when I came to London, did not
perceive how the change of atmosphere began at once to warp and
distribute my energies.  In the first place I became invisible. 
If I idled for a day, no one except my fellow-students (who
evidently had no awe for me) remarked it.  No one saw my midnight
taper; no one pointed me out as I crossed the street as an
astonishing intellectual phenomenon.  In the next place I became
inconsiderable.  In Wimblehurst I felt I stood for Science;
nobody there seemed to have so much as I and to have it so fully
and completely.  In London I walked ignorant in an immensity, and
it was clear that among my fellow-students from the midlands and
the north I was ill-equipped and under-trained.  With the utmost
exertion I should only take a secondary position among them.  And
finally, in the third place, I was distracted by voluminous new
interests; London took hold of me, and Science, which had been
the universe, shrank back to the dimensions of tiresome little
formulae compacted in a book.  I came to London in late
September, and it was a very different London from that great
greyly-overcast, smoke-stained house-wilderness  of my first
impressions.  I reached it by Victoria and not by Cannon Street,
and its centre was now in Exhibition Road.  It shone, pale amber,
blue-grey and tenderly spacious and fine under clear autumnal
skies. a London of hugely handsome buildings and vistas and
distances, a London of gardens and labyrinthine tall museums, of
old trees and remote palaces and artificial waters.  I lodged
near by in West Brompton at a house in a little square.
<P>
So London faced me the second time, making me forget altogether
for a while the grey, drizzling city visage that had first looked
upon me.  I settled down and went to and fro to my lectures and
laboratory; in the beginning I worked hard, and only slowly did
the curiosity that presently possessed me to know more of this
huge urban province arise, the desire to find something beyond
mechanism that I could serve, some use other than learning.  With
this was a growing sense of loneliness, a desire for adventure
and intercourse.  I found myself in the evenings poring over a
map of London I had bought, instead of copying out lecture
notes--and on Sundays I made explorations, taking omnibus rides
east and west and north and south, and to enlarging and
broadening the sense of great swarming hinterlands of humanity
with whom I had no dealings, of whom I knew nothing....
<P>
The whole illimitable place teemed with suggestions of indefinite
and sometimes outrageous possibility, of hidden but magnificent
meanings.
<P>
It wasn't simply that I received a vast impression of space and
multitude and opportunity; intimate things also were suddenly
dragged from neglected, veiled and darkened corners into an acute
vividness of perception.  Close at hand in the big art museum I
came for the first time upon the beauty of nudity, which I had
hitherto held to be a shameful secret, flaunted and gloried in; I
was made aware of beauty as not only permissible, but desirable
and frequent and of a thousand hitherto unsuspected rich aspects
of life.  One night in a real rapture, I walked round the upper
gallery of the Albert Hall and listened for the first time to
great music; I believe now that it was a rendering of Beethoven's
Ninth Symphony....
<P>
My apprehension of spaces and places was reinforced by a
quickened apprehension of persons.  A constant stream of people
passed by me, eyes met and challenged mine and passed--more and
more I wanted then to stay--if I went eastward towards
Piccadilly, women who seemed then to my boyish inexperience
softly splendid and alluring, murmured to me as they passed.
Extraordinarily life unveiled.  The very hoardings clamoured
strangely at one's senses and curiosities.  One bought pamphlets
and papers full of strange and daring ideas transcending one's
boldest; in the parks one heard men discussing the very existence
of God, denying the rights of property, debating a hundred things
that one dared not think about in Wimblehurst.  And after the
ordinary overcast day, after dull mornings, came twilight, and
London lit up and became a thing of white and yellow and red
jewels of light and wonderful floods of golden illumination and
stupendous and unfathomable  shadows--and there were no longer
any mean or shabby people--but a great mysterious movement of
unaccountable beings....
<P>
Always I was coming on the queerest new aspects.  Late one
Saturday night I found myself one of a great slow-moving crowd
between the blazing shops and the flaring barrows in the Harrow
Road; I got into conversation with two bold-eyed girls, bought
them boxes of chocolate, made the acquaintance of father and
mother and various younger brothers and sisters, sat in a
public-house hilariously with them all, standing and being stood
drinks, and left them in the small hours at the door of "home,"
never to see them again.  And once I was accosted on the
outskirts of a Salvation Army meeting in one of the parks by a
silk-hatted young man of eager and serious discourse, who argued
against scepticism with me, invited me home to tea into a clean
and cheerful family of brothers and sisters and friends, and
there I spent the evening singing hymns to the harmonium (which
reminded me of half-forgotten Chatham), and wishing all the
sisters were not so obviously engaged....
<P>
Then on the remote hill of this boundless city-world I found
Ewart.
<P>
III
<P>
How well I remember the first morning, a bright Sunday morning in
early October, when I raided in upon Ewart!  I found my old
schoolfellow in bed in a room over an oil-shop in a back street
at the foot of Highgate Hill.  His landlady, a pleasant, dirty
young woman with soft-brown eyes, brought down his message for me
to come up; and up I went.  The room presented itself as ample
and interesting in detail and shabby with a quite commendable
shabbiness.  I had an impression of brown walls--they were
papered with brown paper-- of a long shelf along one side of the
room, with dusty plaster casts and a small cheap lay figure of a
horse, of a table and something of grey wax partially covered
with a cloth, and of scattered drawings.  There was a gas stove
in one corner, and some enameled ware that had been used for
overnight cooking.  The oilcloth on the floor was streaked with a
peculiar white dust.  Ewart himself was not in the first instance
visible, but only a fourfold canvas screen at the end of the room
from which shouts proceeded of "Come on!" then his wiry black
hair, very much rumpled, and a staring red-brown eye and his
stump of a nose came round the edge of this at a height of about
three feet from the ground "It's old Ponderevo!" he said, "the
Early bird! And he's caught the worm! By Jove, but it's cold this
morning! Come round here and sit on the bed!" 
<P>
I walked round, wrung his hand, and we surveyed one another.
<P>
He was lying on a small wooden fold-up bed, the scanty covering
of which was supplemented by an overcoat and an elderly but still
cheerful pair of check trousers, and he was wearing pajamas of a
virulent pink and green.  His neck seemed longer and more stringy
than it had been even in our schooldays, and his upper lip had a
wiry black moustache.  The rest of his ruddy, knobby countenance,
his erratic hair and his general hairy leanness had not even--to
my perceptions grown.
<P>
"By Jove!" he said, "you've got quite decent-looking, Ponderevo!
What do you think of me?"
<P>
"You're all right.  What are you doing here?" 
<P>
"Art, my son--sculpture! And incidentally--" He hesitated.  "I
ply a trade.  Will you hand me that pipe and those smoking
things?  So!  You can't make coffee, eh?  Well, try your hand. 
Cast down this screen--no--fold it up and so we'll go into the
other room.  I'll keep in bed all the same.  The fire's a gas
stove.  Yes.  Don't make it bang too loud as you light it--I
can't stand it this morning.  You won't smoke ?... Well, it does
me good to see you again, Ponderevo.  Tell me what you're doing,
and how you're getting on."  
<P>
He directed me in the service of his simple hospitality, and
presently I came back to his bed and sat down and smiled at him
there, smoking comfortably, with his hands under his head,
surveying me.
<P>
"How's Life's Morning, Ponderevo?  By Jove, it must be nearly six
years since we met!  They've got moustaches.  We've fleshed
ourselves a bit, eh?  And you?" 
<P>
I felt a pipe was becoming after all, and that lit, I gave him a
favourable sketch of my career.
<P>
"Science!  And you've worked like that!  While I've been potting
round doing odd jobs for stone-masons and people, and trying to
get to sculpture.  I've a sort of feeling that the chisel--I
began with painting, Ponderevo, and found I was colour-blind,
colour-blind enough to stop it.  I've drawn about and thought
about--thought more particularly.  I give myself three days a
week as an art student, and the rest of the time I've a sort of
trade that keeps me.  And we're still in the beginning of things,
young men starting.  Do you remember the old times at Goudhurst,
our doll's-house island, the Retreat of the Ten Thousand Young
Holmes and the rabbits, eh?  It's surprising, if you think of it,
to find we are still young.  And we used to talk of what we would
be, and we used to talk of love!  I suppose you know all about
that now, Ponderevo?" 
<P>
I finished and hesitated on some vague foolish lie, "No," I said,
a little ashamed of the truth.  "Do you?  I've been too busy."  
<P>
"I'm just beginning--just as we were then.  Things happen."
<P>
He sucked at his pipe for a space and stared at the plaster cast
of a flayed hand that hung on the wall.
<P>
"The fact is, Ponderevo, I'm beginning to find life a most
extraordinary queer set-out; the things that pull one, the things
that don't.  The wants--This business of sex.  It's a net.  No
end to it, no way out of it, no sense in it.  There are times
when women take possession of me, when my mind is like a painted
ceiling at Hampton Court with the pride of the flesh sprawling
all over it.  WHY?...  And then again sometimes when I have to
encounter a woman, I am overwhelmed by a terror of tantalising
boredom--I fly, I hide, I do anything.  You've got your
scientific explanations perhaps;  what's Nature and the universe
up to in that matter?" 
<P>
"It's her way, I gather, of securing the continuity of the
species."  
<P>
"But it doesn't," said Ewart.  "That's just it!  No.  I have
succumbed to--dissipation--down the hill there.  Euston Road way.
<P>
And it was damned ugly and mean, and I hate having done it.  And
the continuity of the species--Lord!... And why does Nature make
a man so infernally ready for drinks?  There's no sense in that
anyhow."  He sat up in bed, to put this question with the greater
earnestness.  "And why has she given me a most violent desire
towards sculpture and an equally violent desire to leave off work
directly I begin it, eh?... Let's have some more coffee.  I put
it to you, these things puzzle me, Ponderevo.  They dishearten
me.  They keep me in bed."  
<P>
He had an air of having saved up these difficulties for me for
some time.  He sat with his chin almost touching his knees,
sucking at his pipe.
<P>
"That's what I mean," he went on, "when I say life is getting on
to me as extraordinarily queer, I don't see my game, nor why I
was invited.  And I don't make anything of the world outside
either.  What do you make of it?" 
<P>
"London," I began.  "It's--so enormous!" 
<P>
"Isn't it!  And it's all up to nothing.  You find chaps keeping
grocers' shops--why the DEVIL, Ponderevo, do they keep grocers'
shops?  They all do it very carefully,  very steadily, very
meanly.  You find people running about and doing the most
remarkable things being policemen, for example, and burglars. 
They go about these businesses quite gravely and earnestly.  I
somehow--can't go about mine.  Is there any sense in it at
all--anywhere?" 
<P>
"There must be sense in it," I said.  "We're young."  
<P>
"We're young--yes.  But one must inquire.  The grocer's a grocer
because, I suppose, he sees he comes in there.  Feels that on the
whole it amounts to a call....  But the bother is I don't see
where I come in at all.  Do you?" 
<P>
"Where you come in?" 
<P>
"No, where you come in."  
<P>
"Not exactly, yet," I said.  "I want to do some good in the
world--something--something effectual, before I die.  I have a
sort of idea my scientific work-- I don't know."  
<P>
"Yes," he mused."  And I've got a sort of idea my sculpture,--but
now it is to come in and WHY,--I've no idea at all."  He hugged
his knees for a space. "That's what puzzles me, Ponderevo, no
end."  
<P>
He became animated.  "If you will look in that cupboard," he
said, "you will find an old respectable looking roll on a plate
and a knife somewhere and a gallipot containing butter.  You give
them me and I'll make my breakfast, and then if you don't mind
watching me paddle about at my simple toilet I'll get up.  Then
we'll go for a walk and talk about this affair of life further. 
And about Art and Literature and anything  else that crops up on
the way.... Yes, that's the gallipot.  Cockroach got in it?
Chuck him out--damned interloper...."  
<P>
So in the first five minutes of our talk, as I seem to remember
it now, old Ewart struck the note that ran through all that
morning's intercourse....
<P>
To me it was a most memorable talk because it opened out quite
new horizons of thought.  I'd been working rather close and out
of touch with Ewart's free gesticulating  way.  He was
pessimistic that day and sceptical to the very root of things. 
He made me feel clearly, what I had not felt at all before, the
general adventurousness of life, particularly of life at the
stage we had reached, and also the absence of definite objects,
of any concerted purpose in the lives that were going on all
round us.  He made me feel, too, how ready I was to take up
commonplace assumptions.  Just as I had always imagined that
somewhere in social arrangements there was certainly a
Head-Master who would intervene if one went too far, so I had
always had a sort of implicit belief that in our England there
were somewhere people who understood what we were all, as a
nation, about.  That crumpled into his pit of doubt and vanished.
<P>
He brought out, sharply cut and certain, the immense effect of
purposelessness in London that I was already indistinctly
feeling.  We found ourselves at last returning through Highgate
Cemetery and Waterlow Park--and Ewart was talking.
<P>
"Look at it there," he said, stopping and pointing to the great
vale of London spreading wide and far. "It's like a sea--and we
swim in it.  And at last down we go, and then up we come--washed
up here."  He swung his arms to the long slopes about us, tombs
and headstones in long perspectives, in limitless rows.
<P>
"We're young, Ponderevo, but sooner or later our whitened
memories will wash up on one of these beaches, on some such beach
as this.  George Ponderevo, F.R.S., Sidney Ewart, R.I.P.  Look at
the rows of 'em!" 
<P>
He paused.  "Do you see that hand?  The hand, I mean, pointing
upward, on the top of a blunted obelisk.  Yes.  Well, that's what
I do for a living--when I'm not thinking, or drinking, or
prowling, or making love, or pretending I'm trying to be a
sculptor without either the money or the morals for a model. 
See?  And I do those hearts afire and those pensive angel
guardians with the palm of peace.  Damned well I do 'em and
damned cheap!  I'm a sweated victim, Ponderevo..."  
<P>
That was the way of it, anyhow.  I drank deep of talk that day;
we went into theology, into philosophy; I had my first glimpse of
socialism.  I felt as though I had been silent in a silence since
I and he had parted. At the thought of socialism Ewart's moods
changed for a time to a sort of energy.  "After all, all this
confounded  vagueness might be altered.  If you could get men to
work together..."  
<P>
It was a good talk that rambled through all the universe.   I
thought I was giving my mind refreshment, but indeed it was
dissipation.  All sorts of ideas, even now, carry me back as it
were to a fountain-head, to Waterlow Park and my resuscitated
Ewart.  There stretches away south of us long garden slopes and
white gravestones and the wide expanse of London, and somewhere 
in the picture is a red old wall, sun-warmed, and a great blaze
of Michaelmas daisies set off with late golden sunflowers and a
drift of mottled, blood-red, fallen leaves.  It was with me that
day as though I had lifted my head suddenly out of dull and
immediate things and looked at life altogether.... But it played
the very devil with the copying up of my arrears of notes to
which I had vowed the latter half of that day.
<P>
After that reunion Ewart and I met much and talked much, and in
our subsequent encounters his monologue was interrupted and I
took my share.  He had exercised me so greatly that I lay awake
at nights thinking him over, and discoursed and answered him in
my head as I went in the morning to the College.  I am by nature
a doer and only by the way a critic; his philosophical assertion 
of the incalculable vagueness of life which fitted his natural
indolence roused my more irritable and energetic  nature to
active protests.  "It's all so pointless,"  I said, "because
people are slack and because it's in the ebb of an age.  But
you're a socialist.  Well, let's bring that about!  And there's a
purpose.  There you are!" 
<P>
Ewart gave me all my first conceptions of socialism; in a little
while I was an enthusiastic socialist and he was a passive
resister to the practical exposition of the theories he had
taught me.  "We must join some organisation,"  I said.  "We ought
to do things.... We ought to go and speak at street corners. 
People don't know."  
<P>
You must figure me a rather ill-dressed young man in a state of
great earnestness, standing up in that shabby studio of his and
saying these things, perhaps with some gesticulations, and Ewart
with a clay-smudged face, dressed perhaps in a flannel shirt and
trousers, with a pipe in his mouth, squatting philosophically at
a table, working at some chunk of clay that never got beyond
suggestion.
<P>
"I wonder why one doesn't want to," he said.
<P>
It was only very slowly I came to gauge Ewart's real position in
the scheme of things, to understand how deliberate and complete
was this detachment of his from the moral condemnation and
responsibilities that played so fine a part in his talk.  His was
essentially the nature of an artistic appreciator; he could find
interest and beauty in endless aspects of things that I marked as
evil, or at least as not negotiable; and the impulse I had
towards self-deception, to sustained and consistent
self-devotion, disturbed and detached and pointless as it was at
that time, he had indeed a sort of admiration for but no
sympathy.  Like many fantastic and ample talkers he was at bottom
secretive, and he gave me a series of little shocks of discovery
throughout our intercourse. 
<P>
The first of these came in the realisation that he quite
seriously meant to do nothing in the world at all towards
reforming the evils he laid bare in so easy and dexterous a
manner.  The next came in the sudden appearance of a person
called "Milly"--I've forgotten her surname--whom I found in his
room one evening, simply attired in a blue wrap--the rest of her
costume behind the screen--smoking cigarettes and sharing a
flagon of an amazingly cheap and self-assertive grocer's wine
Ewart affected, called "Canary Sack."  "Hullo!"  said Ewart, as I
came in.  "This is Milly, you know.  She's been being a
model--she IS a model really.... (keep calm, Ponderevo!) Have
some sack?" 
<P>
Milly was a woman of thirty, perhaps, with a broad, rather pretty
face, a placid disposition, a bad accent and delightful blond
hair that waved off her head with an irrepressible variety of
charm; and whenever Ewart spoke she beamed at him.  Ewart was
always sketching this hair of hers and embarking upon clay
statuettes of her that were never finished.  She was, I know now,
a woman of the streets, whom Ewart had picked up in the most
casual manner, and who had fallen in love with him, but my
inexperience in those days was too great for me to place her
then, and Ewart offered no elucidations.  She came to him, he
went to her, they took holidays together in the country when
certainly she sustained her fair share of their expenditure.  I
suspect him now even of taking money from her.  Odd old Ewart! 
It was a relationship so alien to my orderly conceptions of
honour, to what I could imagine any friend of mine doing, that I
really hardly saw it with it there under my nose.  But I see it
and I think I understand it now....
<P>
Before I fully grasped the discursive manner in which Ewart was
committed to his particular way in life, I did, I say, as the
broad constructive ideas of socialism took hold of me, try to get
him to work with me in some definite fashion as a socialist.
<P>
"We ought to join on to other socialists," I said.
<P>
"They've got something."  
<P>
"Let's go and look at some first."  
<P>
After some pains we discovered the office of the Fabian Society,
lurking in a cellar in Clement's Inn; and we went and interviewed
a rather discouraging secretary who stood astraddle in front of a
fire and questioned us severely and seemed to doubt the integrity
of our intentions profoundly.  He advised us to attend the next
open meeting in Clifford's Inn and gave us the necessary data. 
We both contrived to get to the affair, and heard a discursive
gritty paper on Trusts and one of the most inconclusive
discussions you can imagine.  Three-quarters of the speakers
seemed under some jocular obsession which took the form of
pretending to be conceited.  It was a sort of family joke, and as
strangers to the family we did not like it....  As we came out
through the narrow passage from Clifford's Inn to the Strand,
Ewart suddenly pitched upon a wizened, spectacled little man in a
vast felt hat and a large orange tie.
<P>
"How many members are there in this Fabian Society of yours?" he
asked.
<P>
The little man became at once defensive in his manner.
<P>
"About seven hundred," he said; "perhaps eight."  
<P>
"Like--like the ones here?" 
<P>
The little man gave a nervous self-satisfied laugh. "I suppose
they're up to sample," he said.
<P>
The little man dropped out of existence and we emerged upon the
Strand.  Ewart twisted his arm into a queerly eloquent gesture
that gathered up all the tall facades of the banks, the business
places, the projecting clock and towers of the Law Courts, the
advertisements, the luminous signs, into one social immensity,
into a capitalistic system gigantic and invincible.
<P>
"These socialists have no sense of proportion," he said.  "What
can you expect of them?" 
<P>
IV
<P>
Ewart, as the embodiment of talk, was certainly a leading factor
in my conspicuous failure to go on studying.  Social theory in
its first crude form of Democratic Socialism gripped my
intelligence more and more powerfully.  I argued in the
laboratory with the man who shared my bench until we quarreled
and did not speak and also I fell in love.
<P>
The ferment of sex had been creeping into my being like a slowly
advancing tide through all my Wimblehurst days, the stimulus of
London was like the rising of a wind out of the sea that brings
the waves in fast and high.  Ewart had his share in that.  More
and more acutely and unmistakably did my perception of beauty,
form and sound, my desire for adventure, my desire for
intercourse, converge on this central and commanding business of
the individual life.  I had to get me a mate.
<P>
I began to fall in love faintly with girls I passed in the
street, with women who sat before me in trains, with girl
fellow-students, with ladies in passing carriages, with
loiterers at the corners, with neat-handed waitresses in shops
and tea-rooms, with pictures even of girls and women.  On my rare
visits to the theatre I always became exalted, and found the
actresses and even the spectators about me mysterious,
attractive, creatures of deep interest and desire.  I had a
stronger and stronger sense that among these glancing, passing
multitudes there was somewhere one who was for me. And in spite
of every antagonistic force in the world, there was something in
my very marrow that insisted: "Stop! Look at this one!  Think of
her!  Won't she do ? This signifies--this before all things
signifies!  Stop!  Why are you hurrying by?  This may be the
predestined person--before all others."  
<P>
It is odd that I can't remember when first I saw Marion, who
became my wife--whom I was to make wretched, who was to make me
wretched, who was to pluck that fine generalised possibility of
love out of my early manhood and make it a personal conflict.  I
became  aware of her as one of a number of interesting attractive
figures that moved about in my world, that glanced back at my
eyes, that flitted by with a kind of averted watchfulness.  I
would meet her coming through the Art Museum, which was my short
cut to the Brompton  Road, or see her sitting, reading as I
thought, in one of the bays of the Education Library.  But
really, as I found out afterwards, she never read.  She used to
come there to eat a bun in quiet.  She was a very
gracefully-moving figure of a girl then, very plainly dressed,
with dark brown hair I remember, in a knot low on her neck behind
that confessed the pretty roundness of her head and harmonised
with the admirable lines of ears and cheek, the grave serenity of
mouth and brow.
<P>
She stood out among the other girls very distinctly because they
dressed more than she did, struck emphatic notes of colour,
startled one by novelties in hats and bows and things.  I've
always hated the rustle, the disconcerting colour boundaries, the
smart unnatural angles of women's clothes.  Her plain black dress
gave her a starkness....
<P>
I do remember, though, how one afternoon I discovered  the
peculiar appeal of her form for me.  I had been restless with my
work and had finally slipped out of the Laboratory and come over
to the Art Museum to lounge among the pictures.  I came upon her
in an odd corner of the Sheepshanks gallery, intently copying
something from a picture that hung high.  I had just been in the
gallery of casts from the antique, my mind was all alive with my
newly awakened sense of line, and there she stood with face
upturned, her body drooping forward from the hips just a
little--memorably graceful--feminine.
<P>
After that I know I sought to see her, felt a distinctive 
emotion at her presence, began to imagine things about her.  I no
longer thought of generalised womanhood or of this casual person
or that.  I thought of her.
<P>
An accident brought us together.  I found myself one Monday
morning in an omnibus staggering westward from Victoria--I was
returning from a Sunday I'd spent at Wimblehurst in response to a
unique freak of hospitality on the part of Mr. Mantell.  She was
the sole other inside passenger.  And when the time came to pay
her fare, she became an extremely scared, disconcerted and
fumbling young woman; she had left her purse at home.
<P>
Luckily I had some money.
<P>
She looked at me with startled, troubled brown eyes; she
permitted my proffered payment to the conductor with a certain
ungraciousness that seemed a part of her shyness, and then as she
rose to go, she thanked me with an obvious affectation of ease.
<P>
"Thank you so much," she said in a pleasant soft voice; and then
less gracefully, "Awfully kind of you, you know."  
<P>
I fancy I made polite noises.  But just then I wasn't disposed to
be critical.  I was full of the sense of her presence; her arm
was stretched out over me as she moved past me, the gracious
slenderness of her body was near me.  The words we used didn't
seem very greatly to matter.  I had vague ideas of getting out
with her--and I didn't.
<P>
That encounter, I have no doubt, exercised me enormously.   I lay
awake at night rehearsing it, and wondering  about the next phase
of our relationship.  That took the form of the return of my
twopence.  I was in the Science Library, digging something out of
the Encyclopedia  Britannica, when she appeared beside me and
placed on the open page an evidently premeditated thin envelope,
bulgingly confessing the coins within.
<P>
"It was so very kind of you," she said, "the other day.  I don't
know what I should have done, Mr.--"
<P>
I supplied my name.  "I knew," I said, "you were a student here."
<P>
"Not exactly a student.  I--"
<P>
"Well, anyhow, I knew you were here frequently.  And I'm a
student myself at the Consolidated Technical Schools."  
<P>
I plunged into autobiography and questionings, and so entangled
her in a conversation that got a quality of intimacy through the
fact that, out of deference to our fellow-readers, we were
obliged to speak in undertones.  And I have no doubt that in
substance it was singularly banal.  Indeed I have an impression
that all our early conversations were incredibly banal.  We met
several times in a manner half-accidental, half furtive and
wholly awkward.  Mentally I didn't take hold of her. I never did
take hold of her mentally.  Her talk, I now know all too clearly,
was shallow, pretentious, evasive.  Only--even to this day--I
don't remember it as in any way vulgar.  She was, I could see
quite clearly, anxious to overstate or conceal her real social
status, a little desirous to be taken for a student in the art
school and a little ashamed that she wasn't.  She came to the
museum to "copy things," and this, I gathered, had something to
do with some way of partially earning her living that I wasn't to
inquire into.  I told her things about myself, vain things that I
felt might appeal to her, but that I learnt long afterwards made
her think me "conceited."  We talked of books, but there she was
very much on her guard and secretive, and rather more freely of
pictures.  She "liked" pictures.  I think from the outset I
appreciated and did not for a moment resent that hers was a
commonplace mind, that she was the unconscious custodian of
something that had gripped my most intimate instinct, that she
embodied the hope of a possibility, was the careless proprietor
of a physical quality that had turned my head like strong wine. 
I felt I had to stick to our acquaintance, flat as it was. 
Presently we should get through these irrelevant exterior things,
and come to the reality of love beneath.
<P>
I saw her in dreams released, as it were, from herself, 
beautiful, worshipful, glowing.  And sometimes when we were
together, we would come on silences through sheer lack of matter,
and then my eyes would feast on her, and the silence seemed like
the drawing back of a curtain--her superficial self.  Odd, I
confess.  Odd, particularly, the enormous hold of certain things
about her upon me, a certain slight rounded duskiness of skin, a
certain perfection of modelling in her lips, her brow, a certain
fine flow about the shoulders.  She wasn't indeed beautiful to
many people--these things are beyond explaining.  She had
manifest defects of form and feature, and they didn't matter at
all.  Her complexion was bad, but I don't think it would have
mattered if it had been positively unwholesome.  I had
extraordinarily limited, extraordinarily painful, desires. I
longed intolerably to kiss her lips.
<P>
V
<P>
The affair was immensely serious and commanding to me.  I don't
remember that in these earlier phases I had any thought of
turning back at all.  It was clear to me that she regarded me
with an eye entirely more critical than I had for her, that she
didn't like my scholarly untidiness, my want of even the most
commonplace  style.  "Why do you wear collars like that?" she
said, and sent me in pursuit of gentlemanly neckwear.  I remember
when she invited me a little abruptly one day to come to tea at
her home on the following Sunday and meet her father and mother
and aunt, that I immediately doubted whether my hitherto
unsuspected best clothes would create the impression she desired
me to make on her belongings.  I put off the encounter until the
Sunday after, to get myself in order.  I had a morning coat made
and I bought a silk hat, and had my reward in the first glance of
admiration she ever gave me.  I wonder how many of my sex are as
preposterous.  I was, you see, abandoning all my beliefs, my
conventions unasked.  I was forgetting myself immensely.  And
there was a conscious shame in it all.  Never a word--did I
breathe to Ewart--to any living soul of what was going on.
<P>
Her father and mother and aunt struck me as the dismalest of
people, and her home in Walham Green was chiefly notable for its
black and amber tapestry carpets and curtains and table-cloths,
and the age and irrelevance of its books, mostly books with faded
gilt on the covers.  The windows were fortified against the
intrusive eye by cheap lace curtains and an "art pot" upon an
unstable octagonal table.  Several framed Art School drawings of
Marion's, bearing official South Kensington marks of approval,
adorned the room, and there was a black and gilt piano with a
hymn-book on the top of it.  There were draped mirrors over all
the mantels, and above the sideboard in the dining-room in which
we sat at tea was a portrait of her father, villainously truthful
after the manner of such works.  I couldn't see a trace of the
beauty I found in her in either parent, yet she somehow contrived
to be like them both.
<P>
These people pretended in a way that reminded me of the Three
Great Women in my mother's room, but they had not nearly so much
social knowledge and did not do it nearly so well.  Also, I
remarked, they did it with an eye on Marion.  They had wanted to
thank me, they said, for the kindness to their daughter in the
matter of the 'bus fare, and so accounted for anything unusual in
their invitation.  They posed as simple gentlefolk,  a little
hostile to the rush and gadding-about of London, preferring a
secluded and unpretentious quiet.
<P>
When Marion got out the white table-cloth from the
sideboard-drawer for tea, a card bearing the word "APARTMENTS"
fell to the floor.  I picked it up and gave it to her before I
realised from her quickened colour that I should not have seen
it; that probably had been removed from the window in honour of
my coming.
<P>
Her father spoke once in a large remote way of he claims of
business engagements, and it was only long afterwards I realised
that he was a supernumerary clerk in the Walham Green Gas Works
and otherwise a useful man at home.  He was a large, loose,
fattish man with unintelligent brown eyes magnified by
spectacles; he wore an ill-fitting frock-coat and a paper collar,
and he showed me, as his great treasure and interest, a large
Bible which he had grangerised with photographs of pictures. 
Also he cultivated the little garden-yard behind the house, and
he had a small greenhouse with tomatoes.  "I wish I 'ad 'eat," he
said.  "One can do such a lot with 'eat.  But I suppose you can't
'ave everything you want in this world."  
<P>
Both he and Marion's mother treated her with a deference that
struck me as the most natural thing in the world.  Her own manner
changed, became more authoritative and watchful, her shyness
disappeared.  She had taken a line of her own I gathered, draped
the mirror, got the second-hand piano, and broken her parents in.
<P>
Her mother must once have been a pretty woman; she had regular
features and Marion's hair without its lustre, but she was thin
and careworn.  The aunt, Miss Ramboat, was a large, abnormally
shy person very like her brother, and I don't recall anything she
said on this occasion.
<P>
To begin with there was a good deal of tension, Marion was
frightfully nervous and every one was under the necessity of
behaving in a mysteriously unreal fashion until I plunged, became
talkative and made a certain ease and interest.  I told them of
the schools, of my lodgings, of Wimblehurst and my apprenticeship
days.  "There's a lot of this Science about nowadays,"  Mr.
Ramboat reflected; "but I sometimes wonder a bit what good it
is?" 
<P>
I was young enough to be led into what he called "a bit of a
discussion," which Marion truncated before our voices became
unduly raised.  "I dare say, "she said, "there's much to be said
on both sides."  
<P>
I remember Marion's mother asked me what church I attended, and
that I replied evasively.  After tea there was music and we sang
hymns.  I doubted if I had a voice when this was proposed, but
that was held to be a trivial objection, and I found sitting
close beside the sweep of hair from Marion's brow had many
compensations.  I discovered her mother sitting in the horsehair
armchair and regarding us sentimentally.  I went for a walk with
Marion towards Putney Bridge, and then there was more singing and
a supper of cold bacon and pie, after which Mr. Ramboat and I
smoked. During that walk, I remember, she told me the import of
her sketchings and copyings in the museum.  A cousin of a friend
of hers whom she spoke of as Smithie, had developed an original
business in a sort of tea-gown garment which she called a Persian
Robe, a plain sort of wrap with a gaily embroidered yoke, and
Marion went there and worked in the busy times.  In the times
that weren't busy she designed novelties in yokes by an assiduous
use of eyes and note-book in the museum, and went home and traced
out the captured forms on the foundation material.  "I don't get
much," said Marion, "but it's interesting, and in the busy times
we work all day.  Of course the workgirls are dreadfully common,
but we don't say much to them.  And Smithie talks enough for
ten."  
<P>
I quite understood the workgirls were dreadfully common.
<P>
I don't remember that the Walham Green menage and the quality
of these people, nor the light they threw on Marion, detracted in
the slightest degree at that time from the intent resolve that
held me to make her mine.  I didn't like them.  But I took them
as part of the affair.  Indeed, on the whole, I think they threw
her up by an effect of contrast; she was so obviously controlling
them, so consciously superior to them.
<P>
More and more of my time did I give to this passion that
possessed me.  I began to think chiefly of ways of pleasing
Marion, of acts of devotion, of treats, of sumptuous presents for
her, of appeals she would understand.   If at times she was
manifestly unintelligent, in her ignorance became indisputable, I
told myself her simple instincts were worth all the education and
intelligence in the world.  And to this day I think I wasn't
really wrong about her.  There was something extraordinarily 
fine about her, something simple and high, that flickered in and
out of her ignorance and commonness  and limitations like the
tongue from the mouth of a snake....
<P>
One night I was privileged to meet her and bring her home from an
entertainment at the Birkbeck Institute.  We came back on the
underground railway and we travelled first-class--that being the
highest class available.  We were alone in the carriage, and for
the first time I ventured to put my arm about her.
<P>
"You mustn't," she said feebly.
<P>
"I love you," I whispered suddenly with my heart beating wildly,
drew her to me, drew all her beauty to me and kissed her cool and
unresisting lips.
<P>
"Love me?" she said, struggling away from me, "Don't!" and then,
as the train ran into a station, "You must tell no one.... I
don't know.... You shouldn't have done that...."  
<P>
Then two other people got in with us and terminated my wooing for
a time.
<P>
When we found ourselves alone together, walking towards
Battersea, she had decided to be offended.  I parted from her
unforgiven and terribly distressed.
<P>
When we met again, she told me I must never say "that" again.
<P>
I had dreamt that to kiss her lips was ultimate satisfaction.  
But it was indeed only the beginning of desires.  I told her my
one ambition was to marry her.
<P>
"But," she said, "you're not in a position-- What's the good of
talking like that?" 
<P>
I stared at her.  "I mean to," I said.
<P>
"You can't," she answered.  "It will be years"
<P>
"But I love you," I insisted.
<P>
I stood not a yard from the sweet lips I had kissed; I stood
within arm's length of the inanimate beauty I desired to quicken,
and I saw opening between us a gulf of years, toil, waiting,
disappointments and an immense uncertainty.
<P>
"I love you," I said.  "Don't you love me?" 
<P>
She looked me in the face with grave irresponsive eyes.
<P>
"I don't know," she said.  "I LIKE you, of course.... One has to
be sensibl..."  
<P>
I can remember now my sense of frustration by her unresilient
reply.  I should have perceived then that for her my ardour had
no quickening fire.  But how was I to know?  I had let myself
come to want her, my imagination endowed her with infinite
possibilities.  I wanted her and wanted her, stupidly and
instinctively....
<P>
"But," I said "Love--!" 
<P>
"One has to be sensible," she replied.  "I like going about with
you.  Can't we keep as we are?'"
<P>
VI
<P>
Well, you begin to understand my breakdown now, I have been
copious enough with these apologia.  My work got more and more
spiritless, my behaviour degenerated,  my punctuality declined; I
was more and more outclassed in the steady grind by my
fellow-students.  Such supplies of moral energy as I still had at
command shaped now in the direction of serving Marion rather than
science.
<P>
I fell away dreadfully, more and more I shirked and skulked; the
humped men from the north, the pale men with thin, clenched
minds, the intent, hard-breathing  students I found against me,
fell at last from keen rivalry to moral contempt.  Even a girl
got above me upon one of the lists.  Then indeed I made it a
point of honour to show by my public disregard of every rule that
I really did not even pretend to try.
<P>
So one day I found myself sitting in a mood of considerable
astonishment in Kensington Gardens, reacting  on a recent heated
interview with the school Registrar in which I had displayed more
spirit than sense.  I was astonished chiefly at my stupendous
falling  away from all the militant ideals of unflinching study I
had brought up from Wimblehurst.  I had displayed myself, as the
Registrar put it, "an unmitigated rotter."  My failure to get
marks in the written examination had only been equalled by the
insufficiency of my practical work.
<P>
"I ask you," the Registrar had said, "what will become of you
when your scholarship runs out?" 
<P>
It certainly was an interesting question.  What was going to
become of me?
<P>
It was clear there would be nothing for me in the schools as I
had once dared to hope; there seemed, indeed, scarcely anything
in the world except an illpaid  assistantship in some provincial
organized Science School or grammar school.  I knew that for that
sort of work, without a degree or any qualification, one earned
hardly a bare living and had little leisure to struggle up to
anything better.  If only I had even as little as fifty pounds I
might hold out in London and take my B.Sc. degree, and quadruple
my chances!  My bitterness against my uncle returned at the
thought.  After all, he had some of my money still, or ought to
have.  Why shouldn't I act within my rights, threaten to 'take
proceedings'?  I meditated for a space on the idea, and then
returned to the Science Library and wrote him a very considerable
and occasionally pungent letter.
<P>
That letter to my uncle was the nadir of my failure. Its
remarkable consequences, which ended my student days altogether,
I will tell in the next chapter.
<P>
I say "my failure."  Yet there are times when I can even doubt
whether that period was a failure at all, when I become
defensively critical of those exacting courses I did not follow,
the encyclopaedic process of scientific exhaustion from which I
was distracted.  My mind was not inactive, even if it fed on
forbidden food.  I did not learn what my professors and
demonstrators had resolved I should learn, but I learnt many
things.  My mind learnt to swing wide and to swing by itself.
<P>
After all, those other fellows who took high places in the
College examinations and were the professor's model boys haven't
done so amazingly.  Some are professors themselves, some
technical experts; not one can show things done such as I,
following my own interest, have achieved.  For I have built boats
that smack across the water like whiplashes; no one ever dreamt
of such boats until I built them; and I have surprised three
secrets that are more than technical discoveries, in the
unexpected hiding-places of Nature. I have come nearer flying
than any man has done. Could I have done as much if I had had a
turn for obeying those rather mediocre professors at the college
who proposed to train my mind?  If I had been trained in
research--that ridiculous contradiction in terms--should I have
done more than produce additions to the existing store of little
papers with blunted conclusions, of which there are already too
many?  I see no sense in mock modesty upon this matter.  Even by
the standards  of worldly success I am, by the side of my
fellow-students, no failure.  I had my F.R.S. by the time I was
thirty-seven, and if I am not very wealthy poverty is as far from
me as the Spanish Inquisition.  Suppose I had stamped down on the
head of my wandering curiosity, locked my imagination in a box
just when it wanted to grow out to things, worked by so-and-so's
excellent method and so-and-so's indications, where should I be
now?
<P>
I may be all wrong in this.  It may be I should be a far more
efficient man than I am if I had cut off all those divergent
expenditures of energy, plugged up my curiosity about society
with more currently acceptable rubbish or other, abandoned
Ewart, evaded Marion instead of pursuing her, concentrated.  But
I don't believe it!
<P>
However, I certainly believed it completely and was filled with
remorse on that afternoon when I sat dejectedly in Kensington
Gardens and reviewed, in the light of the Registrar's pertinent
questions my first two years in London.
