<p>Nick Ribsam thought not of himself, in his anxiety for his sister.
He had left her but a few brief minutes before, sitting on the
shore of the lake, and now when he returned she was missing.</p>

<p>He had called to her repeatedly without receiving any answer,
and when he looked about him in the smoke and gloom, he could
see nothing of her loved figure.</p>

<p>He noticed that it was very hot where he stood, and there could
be no doubt that the flames were advancing in that direction.
His dread was that Nellie had lost her wits in the presence of
the new danger, and had run blindly into the burning woods where
there could be no escape for her.</p>

<p>"Nellie! Nellie!" he shouted in agonized tones; "Where are you?
Why don't you answer me?"</p>

<p>He thought he heard something like a faint response, but it was
not repeated, and poor Nick was half distracted. For the first
time since entering the burning forest he lost his self-control,
and not doubting that his sister was somewhere close at hand,
he dashed among the trees, still calling to her at the height
of his voice.</p>

<p>He had gone but a short distance when he was brought face to
face with such a fierce blast of flame that he was forced to turn
and run back to the water's edge, where he stopped for a minute
or two gasping for breath.</p>

<p>This repulse served to give him time to collect his wits, and
he tried hard to decide what was best to do, for he was resolved
never to leave that place until he learned the fate of Nellie.</p>

<p>"She had good sense," he added to himself, "and she would not
have done such a foolish thing. She has gone to some other spot
along the shore and is waiting for me."</p>

<p>Possibly this was so, but it did not explain the curious fact
that all the calls of Nick remained unanswered. The space inclosing
the pond was so slight that his voice must have penetrated every
portion of it, and it did seem that if she were in any place safe
for her to be, she could not fail to hear him.</p>

<p>Nick found a long branch, which answered for a pole with which
to guide the raft, and stepping on it he began pushing it along
shore as rapidly as he could, looking into the gloom about him
and often pronouncing the name of his sister. His heart sank within
him when this continued several minutes, and half the circuit
of the pond was completed without bringing him the first evidence
of the whereabouts of Nellie.</p>

<p>Finally he paused, wearied and distressed beyond description.</p>

<p>The darkness of night rested on Shark Pond and the surrounding
woods. The murky volumes of smoke seemed to shut out all light,
excepting when the tongues of fire shot through them. The wind
blew a gale, stirring the water into tiny waves, and the roaring
of the fire through the woods, the sound of trees crashing to
the earth, and the millions of sparks, with blazing bits of wood,
were carried a great distance through the air. Some of these flaming
brands fell on the raft on which Nick Ribsam stood, and they continually
dropped hissing into the water around him.</p>

<p>The problem was, how the children had escaped thus far; and as
the sturdy lad stood out on the pond with the long limb grasped
in his hand, staring around him, he could not but wonder how it
was he had been preserved after driving directly into the forest
when it was literally aflame from one end to the other.</p>

<p>But these thoughts were only for the moment; he had left Nellie,
not expecting to be out of her sight, much less beyond her hearing,
and she had vanished as mysteriously as if the earth had opened
and swallowed her up.</p>

<p>And yet he could not believe she was lost. She had proven that
she was not the weak girl to do anything rashly, or to sit down
and fold her hands and make no attempt to save herself. Something
more than the general danger which impended over both must have
arisen, during that brief period, to drive her from her post.</p>

<p>"Nellie! Nellie!" he called again, shoving the pole vigorously
against the bottom of the pond.</p>

<p>He was sure he heard the faint response this time, and so distinctly
that he caught the direction; it was from a point on the shore
very nearly opposite where he had left her.</p>

<p>"I hear you," he called back, working the unwieldy float toward
the spot; "I'll soon be there."</p>

<p>The distance was not great and it took but a few minutes to approach
quite close to the land, where, with a delight which can scarcely
be imagined, he saw Nellie standing close to the water's edge,
beckoning him to make all haste.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" he asked, as he forced the craft close to her.</p>

<p>"No," she answered, with a strange laugh, "but I thought my last
moment had come."</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear me call you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I did; any one within a mile could hear you."</p>

<p>"Why then didn't you answer me?"</p>

<p>"I was afraid to."</p>

<p>"Afraid of what?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you see him?" was the puzzling question of Nellie in
return, as she stepped carefully upon the raft, helped by the
extended hand of her brother.</p>

<p>"Nellie, stop talking in puzzles," said Nick; "I was so scared
about you that I won't get over it for a week; I called to, and
hunted for you, and you say you heard me; you must have known
how frightened I was, and yet you stood still and never made any
answer, except a minute ago, when I just managed to hear you.
If you think it is right, I don't&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>He turned away offended, when she said:</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Nick; but I was afraid to answer you."</p>

<p>"Afraid of <em>what</em>?"</p>

<p>"Of that <em>bear</em>&mdash;you must have seen him," was the astonishing
answer of the girl.</p>

<p>Nellie then told her story: she was standing on the shore awaiting
the return of her brother, when she was terrified almost out of
senses by the appearance of a large black bear, which was evidently
driven out of the burning forest by the flames.</p>

<p>He did not seem to notice the girl, but when he began lumbering
toward her, as if seeking a good spot where he might enter the
pond, Nellie did not stay on the order of her going, but fled
from the new peril, hardly conscious of what direction she took.
She knew better than to venture among the blazing trees from which
she and her brother had had such a narrow escape, and she sped
forward around the lake until she reached a point nearly opposite.
On the way she never looked behind her once, certain as she was
that the creature was ready to seize and devour her.</p>

<p>She was sure she heard him crashing almost upon her heels; but
when she paused, and finally turned her frightened looks backward,
nothing of the brute was to be seen, and she did not know what
had become of him.</p>

<p>"That's the other bear which Mrs. Fowler saw, and which she told
Sam Harper, Herbert Watrous, and me, we would see some time or
other."</p>

<p>"But that was almost two years ago."</p>

<p>"I know that; don't you suppose a bear will keep that long? This
one has known enough to stay out of sight until the fire has forced
him from his hiding-place."</p>

<p>After Nellie had heard her brother call to her, she was fearful
that if she answered she would betray herself to the brute, who
would instantly make for her; so she held her peace, even though
she saw nothing of the bear, and venturing on a rather feeble
answer when the tones of Nick told how much apprehension he was
suffering over his failure to find her.</p>

<p>Now that the two were on the raft, which was shoved out in the
deep water, something like confidence came back to her, and she
was willing to talk about the beast.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine what has become of him," said the brother, after
her story was told; "from what I have heard and read, the bear
is not afraid of water, and they often go in to bathe, just like
us boys, for the fun of the thing. I don't see why he should have
waited when he had the fire to urge him on."</p>

<p>"Maybe he is swimming around the lake now," whispered Nellie,
looking over as much of the surface as was visible through the
hot smoke.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be surprised, though it is odd that I did not see
him," said Nick, pressing his pole against the bottom; "he is
not far off, you may depend."</p>

<p>"There! didn't you hear him?" asked Nellie, a moment later, as
something like the grunt of a huge hog alarmed both brother and
sister.</p>
