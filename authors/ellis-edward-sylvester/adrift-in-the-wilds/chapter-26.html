<p>If the Pah Utah in the extremity of his suffering had been betrayed
into the extraordinary weakness of manifesting it, he now seemed
anxious to make amends for the humiliating fact. It may have been
that among his own people he would have restrained those utterances
which declared his agony, and borne the utmost with the stoicism
of his race; but knowing that civilization does not teach such
outward indifference to pain, he had adopted the surest means
to reach the sympathy of the white strangers; or, if we may conjecture
still further, the consciousness of the instinctive feud between
the American and Caucasian race told him that the plan he took
was the only one that offered safety to himself. What reason had
he to believe that the hunters were kind of heart? If he hid his
distress, would he not be treated as a well Indian? And was there
any but the one common ground upon which the two races met?</p>

<p>But the fever had passed and he was himself again. True, he was
still feeble, and his limbs trembled at times like those of an
old man; but the disease had gone, and the stern, unbending will
had resumed its sway. He was not a child, but he was Shasta, the
Pah Utah Indian.</p>

<p>The inexperience of Elwood Brandon and Howard Lawrence with these
strange people made this savage an enigma to them. As he stood
with his arms folded, his blanket wrapped around him, his long
black hair streaming over his shoulders, and the mingling of the
paint on his crown and over his face, and his midnight eyes fixed
upon them, it was hard indeed to conjecture the thoughts filtrating
through his brain.</p>

<p>But there is a language in which the human heart can speak&mdash;that
of emotion. The boys felt no fear&mdash;ingratitude is not an element
of the savage character, though sad to say it is sometimes manifested
among us of greater moral pretensions.</p>

<p>He looked at them as they came up and paused a few feet from
him.</p>

<p>"You seem to be better?" asked Elwood, feeling it incumbent that
he should make some remark, even though it was incomprehensible
to their dusky friend. He muttered something and then stretched
out his arms as if to show that he had recovered from his illness.</p>

<p>At this point Terror went up to the savage and snuffed around
him, as if to satisfy himself of his identity. The latter laid
his hand upon his knife and watched the dog narrowly, but he appeared
to judge the animal by the company, and quietly removed his hand
and folded his arms again.</p>

<p>He stood thus a moment, when he pointed to the eastern shore
and then down the river, nodding his head and gesticulating somewhat
excitedly. The boys in return nodded, which satisfied the aborigine.
All at once he moved off and strode rapidly to the other side
of the island, where he drew forth a tiny canoe and shoved it
into the water.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "The Indian drew forth a tiny canoe and shoved
it into the water"]</p>

<p>When it was launched he turned again toward his friends, and
looking steadily at them a moment, once more pointed down stream,
sprang into the boat and dipped his paddle first upon one side
and then upon the other.</p>

<p>It was a sight to see him manage the canoe! It seemed made to
contain a single person, and the way it skimmed over the water
was a perfect marvel to the spectators. It appeared fairly to
fly, scarcely touching the water, while human art could not have
exceeded the skill with which he managed the paddle. He sat as
motionless as a statue, like the artistic violinist. It could
not be seen that he raised his arms above the elbow.</p>

<p>The sun was just going over the western hills, and the reflection
of the water as it flashed and rippled from his paddle gave a
fairy-like appearance to the Indian as he sped down stream that
was pleasing to the last degree.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" asked Elwood.</p>

<p>"It means that he is going to the rescue of Tim."</p>

<p>"If he goes after him he will bring him back. Just see the way
in which he manages that canoe! It is worth going a hundred miles
to see!"</p>

<p>"No doubt he has practiced it long enough."</p>

<p>"But what of our remaining here?"</p>

<p>"I don't see how it can be helped."</p>

<p>"Suppose those Indians that have followed Tim take it into their
heads to pay us a visit?"</p>

<p>"He will take all their attention, if Shasta concludes to have
a part in the matter, and they won't have time to think of us."</p>

<p>"But suppose they <em>do</em> come back here?"</p>

<p>"We must be prepared at any rate; but don't let the thought make
us uneasy. We have two good guns, and Terror would be worth half
a dozen men if we get into close quarters."</p>

<p>"He may be all that; but a rifle-shot could quickly stretch him
out lifeless. It won't do for us to go to sleep until Tim or Shasta
come back."</p>

<p>"Of course not. I do not feel like it, even if we were satisfied
that it was safe for us to do so."</p>

<p>"Look at Shasta!"</p>

<p>The Indian was far down the stream, still speeding with his extraordinary
velocity, using his arms as though they would never tire.</p>

<p>"So sick a few hours ago!"</p>

<p>"Well enough now."</p>

<p>"Didn't you notice how he trembled?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he is still weak, but an Indian soon recovers himself."</p>

<p>"All he needed was the root which he chewed and which cured him
almost immediately. These savages are what you call Thomsonians
I suppose."</p>

<p>"They are the original ones no doubt. I have heard that some
of their medicine men are the most skillful of physicians."</p>

<p>"Yes; we hear all kinds of things about them. What stories we
have read, and yet they don't look and act as I imagined they
would. I thought they would suffer and die without showing the
least pain, and yet Shasta wasn't anyways backward about it."</p>

<p>"No doubt the poor fellow felt bad enough, and he hasn't got
over it yet. You can tell that from his appearance."</p>

<p>"It will take all his skill to help Tim. Just as like as not
he will take Shasta for an enemy and shoot him."</p>

<p>"If they only see each other before dark, so that Tim can understand
that he has a friend at work."</p>

<p>"But you see it is nearly dark now, and it is likely he is in
the woods by this time."</p>

<p>"What danger can he be in then?"</p>

<p>"The Indians may cross over to follow him."</p>

<p>They were silent a while when Elwood suddenly exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Suppose Shasta is an enemy and has gone to help his people?"</p>

<p>Howard shook his head.</p>

<p>"No fear of that. That is the last thing that can occur."</p>

<p>The night gradually deepened and proved to be quite dark, a faint
moon shedding a luster that made the dim light more impressive.
The boys walked back and forth, watching and listening for some
evidence of the approach of their friends, and gradually becoming
apprehensive despite the attempt each made to cheer the spirits
of the other.</p>

<p>It was not until quite late that Terror gave utterance to a low,
warning growl, and as they looked across the river they descried
a dark object cautiously approaching.</p>

<p>"What is it?" whispered Elwood.</p>

<p>"It is too dark to tell; but it can't be Tim or Shasta for it's
coming from the wrong direction."</p>

<p>"Aisy now, Mr. Shasta, aisy I say, for the boys may be asleep
and we won't come upon them too sudden't like, as me uncle said
when he sat on a barrel of gun-powder and it blowed up with him.
Aisy, Mr. Shasta, aisy!"</p>
