<p>Once more Lightfoot the Deer was playing hide and seek in the
Green Forest. But it was a very different game from the one he
had played just a short time before. You remember that then it
had been for his life that he had played, and he was the one who
had done all the hiding. Now, he was "it", and some one else was
doing the hiding. Instead of the dreadful fear which had filled
him in that other game, he was now filled with longing,&mdash;longing
to find and make friends with the beautiful stranger of whom he
had just once caught a glimpse, but of whom every day he found
tracks.</p>

<p>At times Lightfoot would lose his temper. Yes, Sir, Lightfoot
would lose his temper. That was a foolish thing to do, but it
seemed to him that he just couldn't help it. He would stamp his
feet angrily and thrash the bushes with his great spreading antlers
as if they were an enemy with whom he was fighting. More than
once when he did this a pair of great, soft, gentle eyes were
watching him, though he didn't know it. If he could have seen
them and the look of admiration in them, he would have been more
eager than ever to find that beautiful stranger.</p>

<p>At other times Lightfoot would steal about through the Green
Forest as noiselessly as a shadow. He would peer into thickets
and behind tangles of fallen trees and brush piles, hoping to
surprise the one he sought. He would be very, very patient. Perhaps
he would come to the thicket which he knew from the signs the
stranger had left only a few moments before. Then his patience
would vanish in impatience, and he would dash ahead, eager to
catch up with the shy stranger. But always it was in vain. He
had thought himself very clever but this stranger was proving
herself more clever.</p>

<p>Of course it wasn't long before all the little people in the
Green Forest knew what was going on. They knew all about that
game of hide and seek just as they had known all about that other
game of hide and seek with the hunters. But now, instead of trying
to help Lightfoot as they did then, they gave him no help at all.
The fact is, they were enjoying that game. Mischievous Sammy Jay
even went so far as to warn the stranger several times when Lightfoot
was approaching. Of course Lightfoot knew when Sammy did this,
and each time he lost his temper. For the time being, he quite
forgot all that Sammy had done for him when he was the one that
was being hunted.</p>

<p>Once Lightfoot almost ran smack into Buster Bear and was so provoked
by his own carelessness that instead of bounding away he actually
threatened to fight Buster. But when Buster grinned good-naturedly
at him, Lightfoot thought better of it and bounded away to continue
his search.</p>

<p>Then there were times when Lightfoot would sulk and would declare
over and over to himself, "I don't care anything about that stranger.
I won't spend another minute looking for her," And then within
five minutes he would be watching, listening and seeking some
sign that she was still in the Green Forest.</p>
