I find it very difficult to trace how form was added to form and 
interpretation followed interpretation in my ever-spreading, ever-
deepening, ever-multiplying and enriching vision of this world into 
which I had been born.  Every day added its impressions, its hints, 
its subtle explications to the growing understanding.  Day after day 
the living interlacing threads of a mind weave together.  Every 
morning now for three weeks and more (for to-day is Thursday and I 
started on a Tuesday) I have been trying to convey some idea of the 
factors and early influences by which my particular scrap of 
subjective tapestry was shaped, to show the child playing on the 
nursery floor, the son perplexed by his mother, gazing aghast at his 
dead father, exploring interminable suburbs, touched by first 
intimations of the sexual mystery, coming in with a sort of confused 
avidity towards the centres of the life of London.  It is only by 
such an effort to write it down that one realises how marvellously 
crowded, how marvellously analytical and synthetic those ears must 
be.  One begins with the little child to whom the sky is a roof of 
blue, the world a screen of opaque and disconnected facts, the home 
a thing eternal, and "being good" just simple obedience to 
unquestioned authority; and one comes at last to the vast world of 
one's adult perception, pierced deep by flaring searchlights of 
partial understanding, here masked by mists, here refracted and 
distorted through half translucent veils, here showing broad 
prospects and limitless vistas and here impenetrably dark.
<P>
I recall phases of deep speculation, doubts and even prayers by 
night, and strange occasions when by a sort of hypnotic 
contemplation of nothingness I sought to pierce the web of 
appearances about me.  It is hard to measure these things in 
receding perspective, and now I cannot trace, so closely has mood 
succeeded and overlaid and obliterated mood, the phases by which an 
utter horror of death was replaced by the growing realisation of its 
necessity and dignity.  Difficulty of the imagination with infinite 
space, infinite time, entangled my mind; and moral distress for the 
pain and suffering of bygone ages that made all thought of 
reformation in the future seem but the grimmest irony upon now 
irreparable wrongs.  Many an intricate perplexity of these 
broadening years did not so much get settled as cease to matter.  
Life crowded me away from it.
<P>
I have confessed myself a temerarious theologian, and in that 
passage from boyhood to manhood I ranged widely in my search for 
some permanently satisfying Truth.  That, too, ceased after a time 
to be urgently interesting.  I came at last into a phase that 
endures to this day, of absolute tranquillity, of absolute 
confidence in whatever that Incomprehensible Comprehensive which 
must needs be the substratum of all things, may be.  Feeling OF IT, 
feeling BY IT, I cannot feel afraid of it.  I think I had got quite 
clearly and finally to that adjustment long before my Cambridge days 
were done.  I am sure that the evil in life is transitory and finite 
like an accident or distress in the nursery; that God is my Father 
and that I may trust Him, even though life hurts so that one must 
needs cry out at it, even though it shows no consequence but 
failure, no promise but pain. . . .
<P>
But while I was fearless of theology I must confess it was 
comparatively late before I faced and dared to probe the secrecies 
of sex.  I was afraid of sex.  I had an instinctive perception that 
it would be a large and difficult thing in my life, but my early 
training was all in the direction of regarding it as an irrelevant 
thing, as something disconnected from all the broad significances of 
life, as hostile and disgraceful in its quality.  The world was 
never so emasculated in thought, I suppose, as it was in the 
Victorian time. . . .
<P>
I was afraid to think either of sex or (what I have always found 
inseparable from a kind of sexual emotion) beauty.  Even as a boy I 
knew the thing as a haunting and alluring mystery that I tried to 
keep away from.  Its dim presence obsessed me none the less for 
all the extravagant decency, the stimulating silences of my 
upbringing. . . .
<P>
The plaster Venuses and Apollos that used to adorn the vast aisle 
and huge grey terraces of the Crystal Palace were the first 
intimations of the beauty of the body that ever came into my life.  
As I write of it I feel again the shameful attraction of those 
gracious forms.  I used to look at them not simply, but curiously 
and askance.  Once at least in my later days at Penge, I spent a 
shilling in admission chiefly for the sake of them. . . .
<P>
The strangest thing of all my odd and solitary upbringing seems to 
me now that swathing up of all the splendours of the flesh, that 
strange combination of fanatical terrorism and shyness that fenced 
me about with prohibitions.  It caused me to grow up, I will not say 
blankly ignorant, but with an ignorance blurred and dishonoured by 
shame, by enigmatical warnings, by cultivated aversions, an 
ignorance in which a fascinated curiosity and desire struggled like 
a thing in a net.  I knew so little and I felt so much.  There was 
indeed no Aphrodite at all in my youthful Pantheon, but instead 
there was a mysterious and minatory gap.  I have told how at last a 
new Venus was born in my imagination out of gas lamps and the 
twilight, a Venus with a cockney accent and dark eyes shining out of 
the dusk, a Venus who was a warm, passion-stirring atmosphere rather 
than incarnate in a body.  And I have told, too, how I bought a 
picture.
<P>
All this was a thing apart from the rest of my life, a locked 
avoided chamber. . . .
<P>
It was not until my last year at Trinity that I really broke down 
the barriers of this unwholesome silence and brought my secret 
broodings to the light of day.  Then a little set of us plunged 
suddenly into what we called at first sociological discussion.  I 
can still recall even the physical feeling of those first tentative 
talks.  I remember them mostly as occurring in the rooms of Ted 
Hatherleigh, who kept at the corner by the Trinity great gate, but 
we also used to talk a good deal at a man's in King's, a man named, 
if I remember rightly, Redmayne.  The atmosphere of Hatherleigh's 
rooms was a haze of tobacco smoke against a background brown and 
deep.  He professed himself a socialist with anarchistic leanings--
he had suffered the martyrdom of ducking for it--and a huge French 
May-day poster displaying a splendid proletarian in red and black on 
a barricade against a flaring orange sky, dominated his decorations.  
Hatherleigh affected a fine untidiness, and all the place, even the 
floor, was littered with books, for the most part open and face 
downward; deeper darknesses were supplied by a discarded gown and 
our caps, all conscientiously battered, Hatherleigh's flopped like 
an elephant's ear and inserted quill pens supported the corners of 
mine; the highlights of the picture came chiefly as reflections from 
his chequered blue mugs full of audit ale.  We sat on oak chairs, 
except the four or five who crowded on a capacious settle, we drank 
a lot of beer and were often fuddled, and occasionally quite drunk, 
and we all smoked reckless-looking pipes,--there was a transient 
fashion among us for corn cobs for which Mark Twain, I think, was 
responsible.  Our little excesses with liquor were due far more to 
conscience than appetite, indicated chiefly a resolve to break away 
from restraints that we suspected were keeping us off the 
instructive knife-edges of life.  Hatherleigh was a good Englishman 
of the premature type with a red face, a lot of hair, a deep voice 
and an explosive plunging manner, and it was he who said one 
evening--Heaven knows how we got to it--" Look here, you know, it's 
all Rot, this Shutting Up about Women.  We OUGHT to talk about them.  
What are we going to do about them?  It's got to come.  We're all 
festering inside about it.  Let's out with it.  There's too much 
Decency altogether about this Infernal University!"
<P>
We rose to his challenge a little awkwardly and our first talk was 
clumsy, there were flushed faces and red ears, and I remember 
Hatherleigh broke out into a monologue on decency.  "Modesty and 
Decency," said Hatherleigh, "are Oriental vices.  The Jews brought 
them to Europe.  They're Semitic, just like our monasticism here and 
the seclusion of women and mutilating the dead on a battlefield.  
And all that sort of thing."
<P>
Hatherleigh's mind progressed by huge leaps, leaps that were usually 
wildly inaccurate, and for a time we engaged hotly upon the topic of 
those alleged mutilations and the Semitic responsibility for 
decency.  Hatherleigh tried hard to saddle the Semitic race with the 
less elegant war customs of the Soudan and the northwest frontier of 
India, and quoted Doughty, at that time a little-known author, and 
Cunninghame Graham to show that the Arab was worse than a county-
town spinster in his regard for respectability.  But his case was 
too preposterous, and Esmeer, with his shrill penetrating voice and 
his way of pointing with all four long fingers flat together, 
carried the point against him.  He quoted Cato and Roman law and the 
monasteries of Thibet.
<P>
"Well, anyway," said Hatherleigh, escaping from our hands like an 
intellectual frog, "Semitic or not, I've got no use for decency."
<P>
We argued points and Hatherleigh professed an unusually balanced and 
tolerating attitude.  "I don't mind a certain refinement and 
dignity," he admitted generously.  "What I object to is this 
spreading out of decency until it darkens the whole sky, until it 
makes a man's father afraid to speak of the most important things, 
until it makes a man afraid to look a frank book in the face or 
think--even think! until it leads to our coming to--to the business 
at last with nothing but a few prohibitions, a few hints, a lot of 
dirty jokes and, and "--he waved a hand and seemed to seek and catch 
his image in the air--" oh, a confounded buttered slide of 
sentiment, to guide us.  I tell you I'm going to think about it and 
talk about it until I see a little more daylight than I do at 
present.  I'm twenty-two.  Things might happen to me anywhen.  You 
men can go out into the world if you like, to sin like fools and 
marry like fools, not knowing what you are doing and ashamed to ask.  
You'll take the consequences, too, I expect, pretty meekly, 
sniggering a bit, sentimentalising a bit, like--like Cambridge 
humorists. . . .  I mean to know what I'm doing."
<P>
He paused to drink, and I think I cut in with ideas of my own.  But 
one is apt to forget one's own share in a talk, I find, more than 
one does the clear-cut objectivity of other people's, and I do not 
know how far I contributed to this discussion that followed.  I am, 
however, pretty certain that it was then that ideal that we were 
pleased to call aristocracy and which soon became the common 
property of our set was developed.  It was Esmeer, I know, who laid 
down and maintained the proposition that so far as minds went there 
were really only two sorts of man in the world, the aristocrat and 
the man who subdues his mind to other people's.
<P>
"'I couldn't THINK of it, Sir,'" said Esmeer in his elucidatory 
tones; "that's what a servant says.  His mind even is broken in to 
run between fences, and he admits it.  WE'VE got to he able to think 
of anything.  And 'such things aren't for the Likes of Us!'  That's 
another servant's saying.  Well, everything IS for the Likes of Us.  
If we see fit, that is."
<P>
A small fresh-coloured man in grey objected.
<P>
"Well," exploded Hatherleigh, "if that isn't so what the deuce are 
we up here for?  Instead of working in mines?  If some things aren't 
to be thought about ever!  We've got the privilege of all these 
extra years for getting things straight in our heads, and then we 
won't use 'em.  Good God! what do you think a university's for?" . . .
<P>
Esmeer's idea came with an effect of real emancipation to several of 
us.  We were not going to be afraid of ideas any longer, we were 
going to throw down every barrier of prohibition and take them in 
and see what came of it.  We became for a time even intemperately 
experimental, and one of us, at the bare suggestion of an eminent 
psychic investigator, took hashish and very nearly died of it within 
a fortnight of our great elucidation.
<P>
The chief matter of our interchanges was of course the discussion of 
sex.  Once the theme had been opened it became a sore place in our 
intercourse; none of us seemed able to keep away from it.  Our 
imaginations got astir with it.  We made up for lost time and went 
round it and through it and over it exhaustively.  I recall 
prolonged discussion of polygamy on the way to Royston, muddy 
November tramps to Madingley, when amidst much profanity from 
Hatherleigh at the serious treatment of so obsolete a matter, we 
weighed the reasons, if any, for the institution of marriage.  The 
fine dim night-time spaces of the Great Court are bound up with the 
inconclusive finales of mighty hot-eared wrangles; the narrows of 
Trinity Street and Petty Cury and Market Hill have their particular 
associations for me with that spate of confession and free speech, 
that almost painful goal delivery of long pent and crappled and 
sometimes crippled ideas.
<P>
And we went on a reading party that Easter to a place called 
Pulborough in Sussex, where there is a fishing inn and a river that 
goes under a bridge.  It was a late Easter and a blazing one, and we 
boated and bathed and talked of being Hellenic and the beauty of the 
body until at moments it seemed to us that we were destined to 
restore the Golden Age, by the simple abolition of tailors and 
outfitters.
<P>
Those undergraduate talks! how rich and glorious they seemed, how 
splendidly new the ideas that grew and multiplied in our seething 
minds!  We made long afternoon and evening raids over the Downs 
towards Arundel, and would come tramping back through the still keen 
moonlight singing and shouting.  We formed romantic friendships with 
one another, and grieved more or less convincingly that there were 
no splendid women fit to be our companions in the world.  But 
Hatherleigh, it seemed, had once known a girl whose hair was 
gloriously red.  "My God!" said Hatherleigh to convey the quality of 
her; just simply and with projectile violence: "My God!
<P>
Benton had heard of a woman who lived with a man refusing to be 
married to him--we thought that splendid beyond measure,--I cannot 
now imagine why.  She was "like a tender goddess," Benton said.  A 
sort of shame came upon us in the dark in spite of our liberal 
intentions when Benton committed himself to that.  And after such 
talk we would fall upon great pauses of emotional dreaming, and if 
by chance we passed a girl in a governess cart, or some farmer's 
daughter walking to the station, we became alertly silent or 
obstreperously indifferent to her.  For might she not be just that 
one exception to the banal decency, the sickly pointless 
conventionality, the sham modesty of the times in which we lived?
<P>
We felt we stood for a new movement, not realising how perennially 
this same emancipation returns to those ancient courts beside the 
Cam.  We were the anti-decency party, we discovered a catch phrase 
that we flourished about in the Union and made our watchword, 
namely, "stark fact."  We hung nude pictures in our rooms much as if 
they had been flags, to the earnest concern of our bedders, and I 
disinterred my long-kept engraving and had it framed in fumed oak, 
and found for it a completer and less restrained companion, a 
companion I never cared for in the slightest degree. . . .
<P>
This efflorescence did not prevent, I think indeed it rather helped, 
our more formal university work, for most of us took firsts, and 
three of us got Fellowships in one year or another.  There was 
Benton who had a Research Fellowship and went to Tubingen, there was 
Esmeer and myself who both became Residential Fellows.  I had taken 
the Mental and Moral Science Tripos (as it was then), and three 
years later I got a lectureship in political science.  In those days 
it was disguised in the cloak of Political Economy.
<P>

<P>
It was our affectation to be a little detached from the main stream 
of undergraduate life.  We worked pretty hard, but by virtue of our 
beer, our socialism and suchlike heterodoxy, held ourselves to be 
differentiated from the swatting reading man.  None of us, except 
Baxter, who was a rowing blue, a rather abnormal blue with an 
appetite for ideas, took games seriously enough to train, and on the 
other hand we intimated contempt for the rather mediocre, 
deliberately humorous, consciously gentlemanly and consciously wild 
undergraduate men who made up the mass of Cambridge life.  After the 
manner of youth we were altogether too hard on our contemporaries.  
We battered our caps and tore our gowns lest they should seem new, 
and we despised these others extremely for doing exactly the same 
things; we had an idea of ourselves and resented beyond measure a 
similar weakness in these our brothers.
<P>
There was a type, or at least there seemed to us to be a type--I'm a 
little doubtful at times now whether after all we didn't create it--
for which Hatherleigh invented the nickname the "Pinky Dinkys," 
intending thereby both contempt and abhorrence in almost equal 
measure.  The Pinky Dinky summarised all that we particularly did 
not want to be, and also, I now perceive, much of what we were and 
all that we secretly dreaded becoming.
<P>
But it is hard to convey the Pinky Dinky idea, for all that it meant 
so much to us.  We spent one evening at least during that reading 
party upon the Pinky Dinky; we sat about our one fire after a walk 
in the rain--it was our only wet day--smoked our excessively virile 
pipes, and elaborated the natural history of the Pinky Dinky.  We 
improvised a sort of Pinky Dinky litany, and Hatherleigh supplied 
deep notes for the responses.
<P>
"The Pinky Dinky extracts a good deal of amusement from life," said 
some one.
<P>
"Damned prig! " said Hatherleigh.
<P>
"The Pinky Dinky arises in the Union and treats the question with a 
light gay touch.  He makes the weird ones mad.  But sometimes he 
cannot go on because of the amusement he extracts."
<P>
"I want to shy books at the giggling swine," said Hatherleigh.
<P>
"The Pinky Dinky says suddenly while he is making the tea, 'We're 
all being frightfully funny.  It's time for you to say something 
now.'"
<P>
"The Pinky Dinky shakes his head and says: 'I'm afraid I shall never 
be a responsible being.'  And he really IS frivolous."
<P>
"Frivolous but not vulgar," said Esmeer.
<P>
"Pinky Dinkys are chaps who've had their buds nipped," said 
Hatherleigh.  "They're Plebs and they know it.  They haven't the 
Guts to get hold of things.  And so they worry up all those silly 
little jokes of theirs to carry it off." . . .
<P>
We tried bad ones for a time, viciously flavoured.
<P>
Pinky Dinkys are due to over-production of the type that ought to 
keep outfitters' shops.  Pinky Dinkys would like to keep outfitters' 
shops with whimsy 'scriptions on the boxes and make your bill out 
funny, and not be snobs to customers, no!--not even if they had 
titles."
<P>
"Every Pinky Dinky's people are rather good people, and better than 
most Pinky Dinky's people.  But he does not put on side."
<P>
"Pinky Dinkys become playful at the sight of women."
<P>
"'Croquet's my game,' said the Pinky Dinky, and felt a man 
condescended."
<P>
"But what the devil do they think they're up to, anyhow?" roared old 
Hatherleigh suddenly, dropping plump into bottomless despair.
<P>
We felt we had still failed to get at the core of the mystery of the 
Pinky Dinky.
<P>
We tried over things about his religion.  "The Pinky Dinky goes to 
King's Chapel, and sits and feels in the dusk.  Solemn things!  Oh 
HUSH!  He wouldn't tell you--"
<P>
"He COULDN'T tell you."
<P>
"Religion is so sacred to him he never talks about it, never reads 
about it, never thinks about it.  Just feels!"
<P>
"But in his heart of hearts, oh! ever so deep, the Pinky Dinky has a 
doubt--"
<P>
Some one protested.
<P>
"Not a vulgar doubt," Esmeer went on, "but a kind of hesitation 
whether the Ancient of Days is really exactly what one would call 
good form. . . .  There's a lot of horrid coarseness got into the 
world somehow.  SOMEBODY put it there. . . .  And anyhow there's no 
particular reason why a man should be seen about with Him.  He's 
jolly Awful of course and all that--"
<P>
"The Pinky Dinky for all his fun and levity has a clean mind."
<P>
"A thoroughly clean mind.  Not like Esmeer's--the Pig!"
<P>
"If once he began to think about sex, how could he be comfortable at 
croquet?"
<P>
"It's their Damned Modesty," said Hatherleigh suddenly, "that's 
what's the matter with the Pinky Dinky.  It's Mental Cowardice 
dressed up as a virtue and taking the poor dears in.  Cambridge is 
soaked with it; it's some confounded local bacillus.  Like the thing 
that gives a flavour to Havana cigars.  He comes up here to be made 
into a man and a ruler of the people, and he thinks it shows a nice 
disposition not to take on the job!  How the Devil is a great Empire 
to be run with men like him?"
<P>
"All his little jokes and things," said Esmeer regarding his feet on 
the fender, "it's just a nervous sniggering--because he's afraid. . . .  
Oxford's no better."
<P>
"What's he afraid of?" said I.
<P>
"God knows!" exploded Hatherleigh and stared at the fire.
<P>
"LIFE!" said Esmeer.  "And so in a way are we," he added, and made a 
thoughtful silence for a time.
<P>
"I say," began Carter, who was doing the Natural Science Tripos, 
"what is the adult form of the Pinky Dinky?"
<P>
But there we were checked by our ignorance of the world.
<P>
"What is the adult form of any of us?" asked Benton, voicing the 
thought that had arrested our flow.
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
I do not remember that we ever lifted our criticism to the dons and 
the organisation of the University.  I think we took them for 
granted.  When I look back at my youth I am always astonished by the 
multitude of things that we took for granted.  It seemed to us that 
Cambridge was in the order of things, for all the world like having 
eyebrows or a vermiform appendix.  Now with the larger scepticism of 
middle age I can entertain very fundamental doubts about these old 
universities.  Indeed I had a scheme--
<P>
I do not see what harm I can do now by laying bare the purpose of 
the political combinations I was trying to effect.
<P>
My educational scheme was indeed the starting-point of all the big 
project of conscious public reconstruction at which I aimed.  I 
wanted to build up a new educational machine altogether for the 
governing class out of a consolidated system of special public 
service schools.  I meant to get to work upon this whatever office I 
was given in the new government.  I could have begun my plan from 
the Admiralty or the War Office quite as easily as from the 
Education Office.  I am firmly convinced it is hopeless to think of 
reforming the old public schools and universities to meet the needs 
of a modern state, they send their roots too deep and far, the cost 
would exceed any good that could possibly be effected, and so I have 
sought a way round this invincible obstacle.  I do think it would be 
quite practicable to side-track, as the Americans say, the whole 
system by creating hardworking, hard-living, modern and scientific 
boys' schools, first for the Royal Navy and then for the public 
service generally, and as they grew, opening them to the public 
without any absolute obligation to subsequent service.  
Simultaneously with this it would not be impossible to develop a new 
college system with strong faculties in modern philosophy, modern 
history, European literature and criticism, physical and biological 
science, education and sociology.
<P>
We could in fact create a new liberal education in this way, and cut 
the umbilicus of the classical languages for good and all.  I should 
have set this going, and trusted it to correct or kill the old 
public schools and the Oxford and Cambridge tradition altogether.  I 
had men in my mind to begin the work, and I should have found 
others.  I should have aimed at making a hard-trained, capable, 
intellectually active, proud type of man.  Everything else would 
have been made subservient to that.  I should have kept my grip on 
the men through their vacation, and somehow or other I would have 
contrived a young woman to match them.  I think I could have seen to 
it effectually enough that they didn't get at croquet and tennis 
with the vicarage daughters and discover sex in the Peeping Tom 
fashion I did, and that they realised quite early in life that it 
isn't really virile to reek of tobacco.  I should have had military 
manoeuvres, training ships, aeroplane work, mountaineering and so 
forth, in the place of the solemn trivialities of games, and I 
should have fed and housed my men clean and very hard--where there 
wasn't any audit ale, no credit tradesmen, and plenty of high 
pressure douches. . . .
<P>
I have revisited Cambridge and Oxford time after time since I came 
down, and so far as the Empire goes, I want to get clear of those 
two places. . . .
<P>
Always I renew my old feelings, a physical oppression, a sense of 
lowness and dampness almost exactly like the feeling of an 
underground room where paper moulders and leaves the wall, a feeling 
of ineradicable contagion in the Gothic buildings, in the narrow 
ditch-like rivers, in those roads and roads of stuffy little villas.  
Those little villas have destroyed all the good of the old monastic 
system and none of its evil. . . .
<P>
Some of the most charming people in the world live in them, but 
their collective effect is below the quality of any individual among 
them.  Cambridge is a world of subdued tones, of excessively subtle 
humours, of prim conduct and free thinking; it fears the Parent, but 
it has no fear of God; it offers amidst surroundings that vary 
between disguises and antiquarian charm the inflammation of 
literature's purple draught; one hears there a peculiar thin scandal 
like no other scandal in the world--a covetous scandal--so that I am 
always reminded of Ibsen in Cambridge.  In Cambridge and the plays 
of Ibsen alone does it seem appropriate for the heroine before the 
great crisis of life to "enter, take off her overshoes, and put her 
wet umbrella upon the writing desk." . . .
<P>
We have to make a new Academic mind for modern needs, and the last 
thing to make it out of, I am convinced, is the old Academic mind.  
One might as soon try to fake the old VICTORY at Portsmouth into a 
line of battleship again.  Besides which the old Academic mind, like 
those old bathless, damp Gothic colleges, is much too delightful in 
its peculiar and distinctive way to damage by futile patching.
<P>
My heart warms to a sense of affectionate absurdity as I recall dear 
old Codger, surely the most "unleaderly" of men.  No more than from 
the old Schoolmen, his kindred, could one get from him a School for 
Princes.  Yet apart from his teaching he was as curious and adorable 
as a good Netsuke.  Until quite recently he was a power in 
Cambridge, he could make and bar and destroy, and in a way he has 
become the quintessence of Cambridge in my thoughts.
<P>
I see him on his way to the morning's lecture, with his plump 
childish face, his round innocent eyes, his absurdly non-prehensile 
fat hand carrying his cap, his grey trousers braced up much too 
high, his feet a trifle inturned, and going across the great court 
with a queer tripping pace that seemed cultivated even to my naive 
undergraduate eye.  Or I see him lecturing.  He lectured walking up 
and down between the desks, talking in a fluting rapid voice, and 
with the utmost lucidity.  If he could not walk up and down he could 
not lecture.  His mind and voice had precisely the fluid quality of 
some clear subtle liquid; one felt it could flow round anything and 
overcome nothing.  And its nimble eddies were wonderful!  Or again I 
recall him drinking port with little muscular movements in his neck 
and cheek and chin and his brows knit--very judicial, very 
concentrated, preparing to say the apt just thing; it was the last 
thing he would have told a lie about.
<P>
When I think of Codger I am reminded of an inscription I saw on some 
occasion in Regent's Park above two eyes scarcely more limpidly 
innocent than his--"Born in the Menagerie."  Never once since Codger 
began to display the early promise of scholarship at the age of 
eight or more, had he been outside the bars.  His utmost travel had 
been to lecture here and lecture there.  His student phase had 
culminated in papers of quite exceptional brilliance, and he had 
gone on to lecture with a cheerful combination of wit and mannerism 
that had made him a success from the beginning.  He has lectured 
ever since.  He lectures still.  Year by year he has become plumper, 
more rubicund and more and more of an item for the intelligent 
visitor to see.  Even in my time he was pointed out to people as 
part of our innumerable enrichments, and obviously he knew it.  He 
has become now almost the leading Character in a little donnish 
world of much too intensely appreciated Characters.
<P>
He boasted he took no exercise, and also of his knowledge of port 
wine.  Of other wines he confessed quite frankly he had no "special 
knowledge."  Beyond these things he had little pride except that he 
claimed to have read every novel by a woman writer that had ever 
entered the Union Library.  This, however, he held to be remarkable 
rather than ennobling, and such boasts as he made of it were tinged 
with playfulness.  Certainly he had a scholar's knowledge of the 
works of Miss Marie Corelli, Miss Braddon, Miss Elizabeth Glyn and 
Madame Sarah Grand that would have astonished and flattered those 
ladies enormously, and he loved nothing so much in his hours of 
relaxation as to propound and answer difficult questions upon their 
books.  Tusher of King's was his ineffectual rival in this field, 
their bouts were memorable and rarely other than glorious for 
Codger; but then Tusher spread himself too much, he also undertook 
to rehearse whole pages out of Bradshaw, and tell you with all the 
changes how to get from any station to any station in Great Britain 
by the nearest and cheapest routes. . . .
<P>
Codger lodged with a little deaf innocent old lady, Mrs. Araminta 
Mergle, who was understood to be herself a very redoubtable 
Character in the Gyp-Bedder class; about her he related quietly 
absurd anecdotes.  He displayed a marvellous invention in ascribing 
to her plausible expressions of opinion entirely identical in import 
with those of the Oxford and Harvard Pragmatists, against whom he 
waged a fierce obscure war. . . .
<P>
It was Codger's function to teach me philosophy, philosophy! the 
intimate wisdom of things.  He dealt in a variety of Hegelian stuff 
like nothing else in the world, but marvellously consistent with 
itself.  It was a wonderful web he spun out of that queer big active 
childish brain that had never lusted nor hated nor grieved nor 
feared nor passionately loved,--a web of iridescent threads.  He had 
luminous final theories about Love and Death and Immortality, odd 
matters they seemed for him to think about! and all his woven 
thoughts lay across my perception of the realities of things, as 
flimsy and irrelevant and clever and beautiful, oh!--as a dew-wet 
spider's web slung in the morning sunshine across the black mouth of 
a gun. . . .

<P>
All through those years of development I perceive now there must 
have been growing in me, slowly, irregularly, assimilating to itself 
all the phrases and forms of patriotism, diverting my religious 
impulses, utilising my esthetic tendencies, my dominating idea, the 
statesman's idea, that idea of social service which is the 
protagonist of my story, that real though complex passion for 
Making, making widely and greatly, cities, national order, 
civilisation, whose interplay with all those other factors in life I 
have set out to present.  It was growing in me--as one's bones grow, 
no man intending it.
<P>
I have tried to show how, quite early in my life, the fact of 
disorderliness, the conception of social life as being a 
multitudinous confusion out of hand, came to me.  One always of 
course simplifies these things in the telling, but I do not think I 
ever saw the world at large in any other terms.  I never at any 
stage entertamed the idea which sustained my mother, and which 
sustains so many people in the world,--the idea that the universe, 
whatever superficial discords it may present, is as a matter of fact 
"all right," is being steered to definite ends by a serene and 
unquestionable God.  My mother thought that Order prevailed, and 
that disorder was just incidental and foredoomed rebellion; I feel 
and have always felt that order rebels against and struggles against 
disorder, that order has an up-hill job, in gardens, experiments, 
suburbs, everything alike; from the very beginnings of my experience 
I discovered hostility to order, a constant escaping from control.
<P>
The current of living and contemporary ideas in which my mind was 
presently swimming made all in the same direction; in place of my 
mother's attentive, meticulous but occasionally extremely irascible 
Providence, the talk was all of the Struggle for Existenc and the 
survival not of the Best--that was nonsense, but of the fittest to 
survive.
<P>
The attempts to rehabilitate Faith in the form of the 
Individualist's LAISSEZ FAIRE never won upon me.  I disliked Herbert 
Spencer all my life until I read his autobiography, and then I 
laughed a little and loved him.  I remember as early as the City 
Merchants' days how Britten and I scoffed at that pompous question-
begging word "Evolution," having, so to speak, found it out.  
Evolution, some illuminating talker had remarked at the Britten 
lunch table, had led not only to man, but to the liver-fluke and 
skunk, obviously it might lead anywhere; order came into things only 
through the struggling mind of man.  That lit things wonderfully for 
us.  When I went up to Cambridge I was perfectly clear that life was 
a various and splendid disorder of forces that the spirit of man 
sets itself to tame.  I have never since fallen away from that 
persuasion.
<P>
I do not think I was exceptionally precocious in reaching these 
conclusions and a sort of religious finality for myself by eighteen 
or nineteen.  I know men and women vary very much in these matters, 
just as children do in learning to talk.  Some will chatter at 
eighteen months and some will hardly speak until three, and the 
thing has very little to do with their subsequent mental quality.  
So it is with young people; some will begin their religious, their 
social, their sexual interests at fourteen, some not until far on in 
the twenties.  Britten and I belonged to one of the precocious 
types, and Cossington very probably to another.  It wasn't that 
there was anything priggish about any of us; we should have been 
prigs to have concealed our spontaneous interests and ape the 
theoretical boy.
<P>
The world of man centred for my imagination in London, it still 
centres there; the real and present world, that is to say, as 
distinguished from the wonder-lands of atomic and microscopic 
science and the stars and future time.  I had travelled scarcely at 
all, I had never crossed the Channel, but I had read copiously and I 
had formed a very good working idea of this round globe with its 
mountains and wildernesses and forests and all the sorts and 
conditions of human life that were scattered over its surface.  It 
was all alive, I felt, and changing every day; how it was changing, 
and the changes men might bring about, fascinated my mind beyond 
measure.
<P>
I used to find a charm in old maps that showed The World as Known to 
the Ancients, and I wish I could now without any suspicion of self-
deception write down compactly the world as it was known to me at 
nineteen.  So far as extension went it was, I fancy, very like the 
world I know now at forty-two; I had practically all the mountains 
and seas, boundaries and races, products and possibilities that I 
have now.  But its intension was very different.  All the interval 
has been increasing and deepening my social knowledge, replacing 
crude and second-hand impressions by felt and realised distinctions.
<P>
In 1895--that was my last year with Britten, for I went up to 
Cambridge in September--my vision of the world had much the same 
relation to the vision I have to-day that an ill-drawn daub of a 
mask has to the direct vision of a human face.  Britten and I looked 
at our world and saw--what did we see?  Forms and colours side by 
side that we had no suspicion were interdependent.  We had no 
conception of the roots of things nor of the reaction of things.  It 
did not seem to us, for example, that business had anything to do 
with government, or that money and means affected the heroic issues 
of war.  There were no wagons in our war game, and where there were 
guns, there it was assumed the ammunition was gathered together.  
Finance again was a sealed book to us; we did not so much connect it 
with the broad aspects of human affairs as regard it as a sort of 
intrusive nuisance to be earnestly ignored by all right-minded men.  
We had no conception of the quality of politics, nor how "interests" 
came into such affairs; we believed men were swayed by purely 
intellectual convictions and were either right or wrong, honest or 
dishonest (in which ease they deserved to be shot), good or bad.  We 
knew nothing of mental inertia, and could imagine the opinion of a 
whole nation changed by one lucid and convincing exposition.  We 
were capable of the most incongruous transfers from the scroll of 
history to our own times, we could suppose Brixton ravaged and 
Hampstead burnt in civil wars for the succession to the throne, or 
Cheapside a lane of death and the front of the Mansion House set 
about with guillotines in the course of an accurately transposed 
French Revolution.  We rebuilt London by Act of Parliament, and once 
in a mood of hygienic enterprise we transferred its population EN 
MASSE to the North Downs by an order of the Local Government Board.  
We thought nothing of throwing religious organisations out of 
employment or superseding all the newspapers by freely distributed 
bulletins.  We could contemplate the possibility of laws abolishing 
whole classes; we were equal to such a dream as the peaceful and 
orderly proclamation of Communism from the steps of St. Paul's 
Cathedral, after the passing of a simply worded bill,--a close and 
not unnaturally an exciting division carrying the third reading.  I 
remember quite distinctly evolving that vision.  We were then fully 
fifteen and we were perfectly serious about it.  We were not fools; 
it was simply that as yet we had gathered no experience at all of 
the limits and powers of legislation and conscious collective 
intention. . . .
<P>
I think this statement does my boyhood justice, and yet I have my 
doubts.  It is so hard now to say what one understood and what one 
did not understand.  It isn't only that every day changed one's 
general outlook, but also that a boy fluctuates between phases of 
quite adult understanding and phases of tawdrily magnificent 
puerility.  Sometimes I myself was in those tumbrils that went along 
Cheapside to the Mansion House, a Sydney Cartonesque figure, a white 
defeated Mirabean; sometimes it was I who sat judging and condemning 
and ruling (sleeping in my clothes and feeding very simply) the soul 
and autocrat of the Provisional Government, which occupied, of all 
inconvenient places! the General Post Office at St. Martin's-le-
Grand! . . .
<P>
I cannot trace the development of my ideas at Cambridge, but I 
believe the mere physical fact of going two hours' journey away from 
London gave that place for the first time an effect of unity in my 
imagination.  I got outside London.  It became tangible instead of 
being a frame almost as universal as sea and sky.
<P>
At Cambridge my ideas ceased to live in a duologue; in exchange for 
Britten, with whom, however, I corresponded lengthily, stylishly and 
self-consciously for some years, I had now a set of congenial 
friends.  I got talk with some of the younger dons, I learnt to 
speak in the Union, and in my little set we were all pretty busily 
sharpening each other's wits and correcting each other's 
interpretations.  Cambridge made politics personal and actual.  At 
City Merchants' we had had no sense of effective contact; we 
boasted, it is true, an under secretary and a colonial governor 
among our old boys, but they were never real to us; such 
distinguished sons as returned to visit the old school were allusive 
and pleasant in the best Pinky Dinky style, and pretended to be in 
earnest about nothing but our football and cricket, to mourn the 
abolition of "water," and find a shuddering personal interest in the 
ancient swishing block.  At Cambridge I felt for the first time that 
I touched the thing that was going on.  Real living statesmen came 
down to debate in the Union, the older dons had been their college 
intimates, their sons and nephews expounded them to us and made them 
real to us.  They invited us to entertain ideas; I found myself for 
the first time in my life expected to read and think and discuss, my 
secret vice had become a virtue.
<P>
That combination-room world is at last larger and more populous and 
various than the world of schoolmasters.  The Shoesmiths and Naylors 
who had been the aristocracy of City Merchants' fell into their 
place in my mind; they became an undistinguished mass on the more 
athletic side of Pinky Dinkyism, and their hostility to ideas and to 
the expression of ideas ceased to limit and trouble me.  The 
brighter men of each generation stay up; these others go down to 
propagate their tradition, as the fathers of families, as mediocre 
professional men, as assistant masters in schools.  Cambridge which 
perfects them is by the nature of things least oppressed by them,--
except when it comes to a vote in Convocation.
<P>
We were still in those days under the shadow of the great 
Victorians.  I never saw Gladstone (as I never set eyes on the old 
Queen), but he had resigned office only a year before I went up to 
Trinity, and the Combination Rooms were full of personal gossip 
about him and Disraeli and the other big figures of the gladiatorial 
stage of Parlimentary history, talk that leaked copiously into such 
sets as mine.  The ceiling of our guest chamber at Trinity was 
glorious with the arms of Sir William Harcourt, whose Death Duties 
had seemed at first like a socialist dawn.  Mr. Evesham we asked to 
come to the Union every year, Masters, Chamberlain and the old Duke 
of Devonshire; they did not come indeed, but their polite refusals 
brought us all, as it were, within personal touch of them.  One 
heard of cabinet councils and meetings at country houses.  Some of 
us, pursuing such interests, went so far as to read political 
memoirs and the novels of Disraeli and Mrs. Humphry Ward.  From 
gossip, example and the illustrated newspapers one learnt something 
of the way in which parties were split, coalitions formed, how 
permanent officials worked and controlled their ministers, how 
measures were brought forward and projects modified.
<P>
And while I was getting the great leading figures on the political 
stage, who had been presented to me in my schooldays not so much as 
men as the pantomimic monsters of political caricature, while I was 
getting them reduced in my imagination to the stature of humanity, 
and their motives to the quality of impulses like my own, I was also 
acquiring in my Tripos work a constantly developing and enriching 
conception of the world of men as a complex of economic, 
intellectual and moral processes. . . .
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
Socialism is an intellectual Proteus, but to the men of my 
generation it came as the revolt of the workers.  Rodbertus we never 
heard of and the Fabian Society we did not understand; Marx and 
Morris, the Chicago Anarchists, JUSTICE and Social Democratic 
Federation (as it was then) presented socialism to our minds.  
Hatherleigh was the leading exponent of the new doctrines in 
Trinity, and the figure upon his wall of a huge-muscled, black-
haired toiler swaggering sledgehammer in hand across a revolutionary 
barricade, seemed the quintessence of what he had to expound.  
Landlord and capitalist had robbed and enslaved the workers, and 
were driving them quite automatically to inevitable insurrection.  
They would arise and the capitalist system would flee and vanish 
like the mists before the morning, like the dews before the sunrise, 
giving place in the most simple and obvious manner to an era of 
Right and Justice and Virtue and Well Being, and in short a 
Perfectly Splendid Time.
<P>
I had already discussed this sort of socialism under the guidance of 
Britten, before I went up to Cambridge.  It was all mixed up with 
ideas about freedom and natural virtue and a great scorn for kings, 
titles, wealth and officials, and it was symbolised by the red ties 
we wore.  Our simple verdict on existing arrangements was that they 
were "all wrong."  The rich were robbers and knew it, kings and 
princes were usurpers and knew it, religious teachers were impostors 
in league with power, the economic system was an elaborate plot on 
the part of the few to expropriate the many.  We went about feeling 
scornful of all the current forms of life, forms that esteemed 
themselves solid, that were, we knew, no more than shapes painted on 
a curtain that was presently to be torn aside. . . .
<P>
It was Hatherleigh's poster and his capacity for overstating things, 
I think, that first qualified my simple revolutionary enthusiasm.  
Perhaps also I had met with Fabian publications, but if I did I 
forget the circumstances.  And no doubt my innate constructiveness 
with its practical corollary of an analytical treatment of the 
material supplied, was bound to push me on beyond this melodramatic 
interpretation of human affairs.
<P>
I compared that Working Man of the poster with any sort of working 
man I knew.  I perceived that the latter was not going to change, 
and indeed could not under any stimulus whatever be expected to 
change, into the former.  It crept into my mind as slowly and surely 
as the dawn creeps into a room that the former was not, as I had at 
first rather glibly assumed, an "ideal," but a complete 
misrepresentation of the quality and possibilities of things.
<P>
I do not know now whether it was during my school-days or at 
Cambridge that I first began not merely to see the world as a great 
contrast of rich and poor, but to feel the massive effect of that 
multitudinous majority of people who toil continually, who are for 
ever anxious about ways and means, who are restricted, ill clothed, 
ill fed and ill housed, who have limited outlooks and continually 
suffer misadventures, hardships and distresses through the want of 
money.  My lot had fallen upon the fringe of the possessing 
minority; if I did not know the want of necessities I knew 
shabbiness, and the world that let me go on to a university 
education intimated very plainly that there was not a thing beyond 
the primary needs that my stimulated imagination might demand that 
it would not be an effort for me to secure.  A certain aggressive 
radicalism against the ruling and propertied classes followed almost 
naturally from my circumstances.  It did not at first connect itself 
at all with the perception of a planless disorder in human affairs 
that had been forced upon me by the atmosphere of my upbringing, nor 
did it link me in sympathy with any of the profounder realities of 
poverty.  It was a personal independent thing.  The dingier people 
one saw in the back streets and lower quarters of Bromstead and 
Penge, the drift of dirty children, ragged old women, street 
loafers, grimy workers that made the social background of London, 
the stories one heard of privation and sweating, only joined up very 
slowly with the general propositions I was making about life.  We 
could become splendidly eloquent about the social revolution and the 
triumph of the Proletariat after the Class war, and it was only by a 
sort of inspiration that it came to me that my bedder, a garrulous 
old thing with a dusty black bonnet over one eye and an 
ostentatiously clean apron outside the dark mysteries that clothed 
her, or the cheeky little ruffians who yelled papers about the 
streets, were really material to such questions.
<P>
Directly any of us young socialists of Trinity found ourselves in 
immediate contact with servants or cadgers or gyps or bedders or 
plumbers or navvies or cabmen or railway porters we became 
unconsciously and unthinkingly aristocrats.  Our voices altered, our 
gestures altered.  We behaved just as all the other men, rich or 
poor, swatters or sportsmen or Pinky Dinkys, behaved, and exactly as 
we were expected to behave.  On the whole it is a population of poor 
quality round about Cambridge, rather stunted and spiritless and 
very difficult to idealise.  That theoretical Working Man of ours!--
if we felt the clash at all we explained it, I suppose, by assuming 
that he came from another part of the country; Esmeer, I remember, 
who lived somewhere in the Fens, was very eloquent about the Cornish 
fishermen, and Hatherleigh, who was a Hampshire man, assured us we 
ought to know the Scottish miner.  My private fancy was for the 
Lancashire operative because of his co-operative societies, and 
because what Lancashire thinks to-day England thinks to-morrow. . . .  
And also I had never been in Lancashire.
<P>
By little increments of realisation it was that the profounder 
verities of the problem of socialism came to me.  It helped me very 
much that I had to go down to the Potteries several times to discuss 
my future with my uncle and guardian; I walked about and saw Bursley 
Wakes and much of the human aspects of organised industrialism at 
close quarters for the first time.  The picture of a splendid 
Working Man cheated out of his innate glorious possibilities, and 
presently to arise and dash this scoundrelly and scandalous system 
of private ownership to fragments, began to give place to a 
limitless spectacle of inefficiency, to a conception of millions of 
people not organised as they should be, not educated as they should 
be, not simply prevented from but incapable of nearly every sort of 
beauty, mostly kindly and well meaning, mostly incompetent, mostly 
obstinate, and easily humbugged and easily diverted.  Even the 
tragic and inspiring idea of Marx, that the poor were nearing a 
limit of painful experience, and awakening to a sense of intolerable 
wrongs, began to develop into the more appalling conception that the 
poor were simply in a witless uncomfortable inconclusive way--
"muddling along"; that they wanted nothing very definitely nor very 
urgently, that mean fears enslaved them and mean satisfactions 
decoyed them, that they took the very gift of life itself with a 
spiritless lassitude, hoarding it, being rather anxious not to lose 
it than to use it in any way whatever.
<P>
The complete development of that realisation was the work of many 
years.  I had only the first intimations at Cambridge.  But I did 
have intimations.  Most acutely do I remember the doubts that 
followed the visit of Chris Robinson.  Chris Robinson was heralded 
by such heroic anticipations, and he was so entirely what we had not 
anticipated.
<P>
Hatherleigh got him to come, arranged a sort of meeting for him at 
Redmayne's rooms in King's, and was very proud and proprietorial.  
It failed to stir Cambridge at all profoundly.  Beyond a futile 
attempt to screw up Hatherleigh made by some inexpert duffers who 
used nails instead of screws and gimlets, there was no attempt to 
rag.  Next day Chris Robinson went and spoke at Bennett Hall in 
Newnham College, and left Cambridge in the evening amidst the cheers 
of twenty men or so.  Socialism was at such a low ebb politically in 
those days that it didn't even rouse men to opposition.
<P>
And there sat Chris under that flamboyant and heroic Worker of the 
poster, a little wrinkled grey-bearded apologetic man in ready-made 
clothes, with watchful innocent brown eyes and a persistent and 
invincible air of being out of his element.  He sat with his stout 
boots tucked up under his chair, and clung to a teacup and saucer 
and looked away from us into the fire, and we all sat about on 
tables and chair-arms and windowsills and boxes and anywhere except 
upon chairs after the manner of young men.  The only other chair 
whose seat was occupied was the one containing his knitted woollen 
comforter and his picturesque old beach-photographer's hat.  We were 
all shy and didn't know how to take hold of him now we had got him, 
and, which was disconcertingly unanticipated, he was manifestly 
having the same difficulty with us.  We had expected to be gripped.
<P>
"I'll not be knowing what to say to these Chaps," he repeated with a 
north-country quality in his speech.
<P>
We made reassuring noises.
<P>
The Ambassador of the Workers stirred his tea earnestly through an 
uncomfortable pause.
<P>
"I'd best tell 'em something of how things are in Lancashire, what 
with the new machines and all that," he speculated at last with red 
reflections in his thoughtful eyes.
<P>
We had an inexcusable dread that perhaps he would make a mess of the 
meeting.
<P>
But when he was no longer in the unaccustomed meshes of refined 
conversation, but speaking with an audience before him, he became a 
different man.  He declared he would explain to us just exactly what 
socialism was, and went on at once to an impassioned contrast of 
social conditions.  "You young men," he said "come from homes of 
luxury; every need you feel is supplied--"
<P>
We sat and stood and sprawled about him, occupying every inch of 
Redmayne's floor space except the hearthrug-platform, and we 
listened to him and thought him over.  He was the voice of wrongs 
that made us indignant and eager.  We forgot for a time that he had 
been shy and seemed not a little incompetent, his provincial accent 
became a beauty of his earnest speech, we were carried away by his 
indignations.  We looked with shining eyes at one another and at the 
various dons who had dropped in and were striving to maintain a 
front of judicious severity.  We felt more and more that social 
injustice must cease, and cease forthwith.  We felt we could not 
sleep upon it.  At the end we clapped and murmured our applause and 
wanted badly to cheer.
<P>
Then like a lancet stuck into a bladder came the heckling.  Denson, 
that indolent, liberal-minded sceptic, did most of the questioning.  
He lay contorted in a chair, with his ugly head very low, his legs 
crossed and his left boot very high, and he pointed his remarks with 
a long thin hand and occasionally adjusted the unstable glasses that 
hid his watery eyes.  "I don't want to carp," he began.  "The 
present system, I admit, stands condemned.  Every present system 
always HAS stood condemned in the minds of intelligent men.  But 
where it seems to me you get thin, is just where everybody has been 
thin, and that's when you come to the remedy."
<P>
"Socialism," said Chris Robinson, as if it answered everything, and 
Hatherleigh said "Hear! Hear!" very resolutely.
<P>
"I suppose I OUGHT to take that as an answer," said Denson, getting 
his shoulder-blades well down to the seat of his chair; "but I 
don't.  I don't, you know.  It's rather a shame to cross-examine you 
after this fine address of yours"--Chris Robinson on the hearthrug 
made acquiescent and inviting noises--"but the real question 
remains how exactly are you going to end all these wrongs?  There 
are the admimstrative questions.  If you abolish the private owner, 
I admit you abolish a very complex and clumsy way of getting 
businesses run, land controlled and things in general administered, 
but you don't get rid of the need of administration, you know."
<P>
"Democracy," said Chris Robinson.
<P>
"Organised somehow," said Denson.  "And it's just the How perplexes 
me.  I can quite easily imagine a socialist state administered in a 
sort of scrambling tumult that would be worse than anything we have 
got now.
<P>
"Nothing could be worse than things are now," said Chris Robinson.  
"I have seen little children--"
<P>
"I submit life on an ill-provisioned raft, for example, could easily 
be worse--or life in a beleagured town."
<P>
Murmurs.
<P>
They wrangled for some time, and it had the effect upon me of coming 
out from the glow of a good matinee performance into the cold 
daylight of late afternoon.  Chris Robinson did not shine in 
conflict with Denson; he was an orator and not a dialectician, and 
he missed Denson's points and displayed a disposition to plunge into 
untimely pathos and indignation.  And Denson hit me curiously hard 
with one of his shafts.  "Suppose," he said, "you found yourself 
prime minister--"
<P>
I looked at Chris Robinson, bright-eyed and his hair a little 
ruffled and his whole being rhetorical, and measured him against the 
huge machine of government muddled and mysterious.  Oh! but I was 
perplexed!
<P>
And then we took him back to Hatherleigh's rooms and drank beer and 
smoked about him while he nursed his knee with hairy wristed hands 
that protruded from his flannel shirt, and drank lemonade under the 
cartoon of that emancipated Worker, and we had a great discursive 
talk with him.
<P>
"Eh! you should see our big meetings up north?" he said.
<P>
Denson had ruffled him and worried him a good deal, and ever and 
again he came back to that discussion.  "It's all very easy for your 
learned men to sit and pick holes," he said, "while the children 
suffer and die.  They don't pick holes up north.  They mean 
business."
<P>
He talked, and that was the most interesting part of it all, of his 
going to work in a factory when he was twelve--" when you Chaps were 
all with your mammies "--and how he had educated himself of nights 
until he would fall asleep at his reading.
<P>
"It's made many of us keen for all our lives," he remarked, "all 
that clemming for education.  Why! I longed all through one winter 
to read a bit of Darwin.  I must know about this Darwin if I die for 
it, I said.  And I couldno' get the book."
<P>
Hatherleigh made an enthusiastic noise and drank beer at him with 
round eyes over the mug.
<P>
"Well, anyhow I wasted no time on Greek and Latin," said Chris 
Robinson.  "And one learns to go straight at a thing without 
splitting straws.  One gets hold of the Elementals."
<P>
(Well, did they?  That was the gist of my perplexity.)
<P>
"One doesn't quibble," he said, returning to his rankling memory of 
Denson, "while men decay and starve."
<P>
"But suppose," I said, suddenly dropping into opposition, "the 
alternatve is to risk a worse disaster--or do something patently 
futile."
<P>
"I don't follow that," said Chris Robinson.  "We don't propose 
anything futile, so far as I can see."

The prevailing force in my undergraduate days was not Socialism but 
Kiplingism.  Our set was quite exceptional in its socialistic 
professions.  And we were all, you must understand, very distinctly 
Imperialists also, and professed a vivid sense of the "White Man's 
Burden."
<P>
It is a little difficult now to get back to the feelings of that 
period; Kipling has since been so mercilessly and exhaustively 
mocked, criticised and torn to shreds;--never was a man so violently 
exalted and then, himself assisting, so relentlessly called down.  
But in the middle nineties this spectacled and moustached little 
figure with its heavy chin and its general effect of vehement 
gesticulation, its wild shouts of boyish enthusiasm for effective 
force, its lyric delight in the sounds and colours, in the very 
odours of empire, its wonderful discovery of machinery and cotton 
waste and the under officer and the engineer, and "shop" as a poetic 
dialect, became almost a national symbol.  He got hold of us 
wonderfully, he filled us with tinkling and haunting quotations, he 
stirred Britten and myself to futile imitations, he coloured the 
very idiom of our conversation.  He rose to his climax with his 
"Recessional," while I was still an undergraduate.
<P>
What did he give me exactly?
<P>
He helped to broaden my geographical sense immensely, and he 
provided phrases for just that desire for discipline and devotion 
and organised effort the Socialism of our time failed to express, 
that the current socialist movement still fails, I think, to 
express.  The sort of thing that follows, for example, tore 
something out of my inmost nature and gave it a shape, and I took it 
back from him shaped and let much of the rest of him, the tumult and 
the bullying, the hysteria and the impatience, the incoherence and 
inconsistency, go uncriticised for the sake of it:--
<P>
<P>
"Keep ye the Law--be swift in all obedience--
Clear the land of evil, drive the road and bridge the ford,
Make ye sure to each his own
That he reap where he hath sown;
By the peace among Our peoples let men know we serve the Lord!"
<P>
<P>
And then again, and for all our later criticism, this sticks in my 
mind, sticks there now as quintessential wisdom:
<P>
<P>
The 'eathen in 'is blindness bows down to wood an' stone;
'E don't obey no orders unless they is 'is own;
'E keeps 'is side-arms awful: 'e leaves 'em all about
An' then comes up the regiment an' pokes the 'eathen out.
     All along o' dirtiness, all along o' mess,
     All along o' doin' things rather-more-or-less,
     All along of abby-nay, kul, an' hazar-ho,
     Mind you keep your rifle an' yourself jus' so!"
<P>
<P>
It is after all a secondary matter that Kipling, not having been 
born and brought up in Bromstead and Penge, and the war in South 
Africa being yet in the womb of time, could quite honestly entertain 
the now remarkable delusion that England had her side-arms at that 
time kept anything but "awful."  He learnt better, and we all learnt 
with him in the dark years of exasperating and humiliating struggle 
that followed, and I do not see that we fellow learners are 
justified in turning resentfully upon him for a common ignorance and 
assumption. . . .
<P>
South Africa seems always painted on the back cloth of my Cambridge 
memories.  How immense those disasters seemed at the time, disasters 
our facile English world has long since contrived in any edifying or 
profitable sense to forget!  How we thrilled to the shouting 
newspaper sellers as the first false flush of victory gave place to 
the realisation of defeat.  Far away there our army showed itself 
human, mortal and human in the sight of all the world, the pleasant 
officers we had imagined would change to wonderful heroes at the 
first crackling of rifles, remained the pleasant, rather incompetent 
men they had always been, failing to imagine, failing to plan and 
co-operate, failing to grip.  And the common soldiers, too, they 
were just what our streets and country-side had made them, no sudden 
magic came out of the war bugles for them.  Neither splendid nor 
disgraceful were they,--just ill-trained and fairly plucky and 
wonderfully good-tempered men--paying for it.  And how it lowered 
our vitality all that first winter to hear of Nicholson's Nek, and 
then presently close upon one another, to realise the bloody waste 
of Magersfontein, the shattering retreat from Stormberg, Colenso--
Colenso, that blundering battle, with White, as it seemed, in 
Ladysmith near the point of surrender! and so through the long 
unfolding catalogue of bleak disillusionments, of aching, 
unconcealed anxiety lest worse should follow.  To advance upon your 
enemy singing about his lack of cleanliness and method went out of 
fashion altogether!  The dirty retrogressive Boer vanished from our 
scheme of illusion.
<P>
All through my middle Cambridge period, the guns boomed and the 
rifles crackled away there on the veldt, and the horsemen rode and 
the tale of accidents and blundering went on.  Men, mules, horses, 
stores and money poured into South Africa, and the convalescent 
wounded streamed home.  I see it in my memory as if I had looked at 
it through a window instead of through the pages of the illustrated 
papers; I recall as if I had been there the wide open spaces, the 
ragged hillsides, the open order attacks of helmeted men in khaki, 
the scarce visible smoke of the guns, the wrecked trains in great 
lonely places, the burnt isolated farms, and at last the blockhouses 
and the fences of barbed wire uncoiling and spreading for endless 
miles across the desert, netting the elusive enemy until at last, 
though he broke the meshes again and again, we had him in the toils.  
If one's attention strayed in the lecture-room it wandered to those 
battle-fields.
<P>
And that imagined panorama of war unfolds to an accompaniment of 
yelling newsboys in the narrow old Cambridge streets, of the flicker 
of papers hastily bought and torn open in the twilight, of the 
doubtful reception of doubtful victories, and the insensate 
rejoicings at last that seemed to some of us more shameful than 
defeats. . . .

A book that stands out among these memories, that stimulated me 
immensely so that I forced it upon my companions, half in the spirit 
of propaganda and half to test it by their comments, was Meredith's 
ONE OF OUR CONQUERORS.  It is one of the books that have made me.  
In that I got a supplement and corrective of Kipling.  It was the 
first detached and adverse criticism of the Englishman I had ever 
encountered.  It must have been published already nine or ten years 
when I read it.  The country had paid no heed to it, had gone on to 
the expensive lessons of the War because of the dull aversion our 
people feel for all such intimations, and so I could read it as a 
book justified.  The war endorsed its every word for me, underlined 
each warning indication of the gigantic dangers that gathered 
against our system across the narrow seas.  It discovered Europe to 
me, as watching and critical.
<P>
But while I could respond to all its criticisms of my country's 
intellectual indolence, of my country's want of training and 
discipline and moral courage, I remember that the idea that on the 
continent there were other peoples going ahead of us, mentally alert 
while we fumbled, disciplined while we slouched, aggressive and 
preparing to bring our Imperial pride to a reckoning, was extremely 
novel and distasteful to me.  It set me worrying of nights.  It put 
all my projects for social and political reconstruction upon a new 
uncomfortable footing.  It made them no longer merely desirable but 
urgent.  Instead of pride and the love of making one might own to a 
baser motive.  Under Kipling's sway I had a little forgotten the 
continent of Europe, treated it as a mere envious echo to our own 
world-wide display.  I began now to have a disturbing sense as it 
were of busy searchlights over the horizon. . . .
<P>
One consequence of the patriotic chagrin Meredith produced in me was 
an attempt to belittle his merit.  "It isn't a good novel, anyhow," 
I said.
<P>
The charge I brought against it was, I remember, a lack of unity.  
It professed to be a study of the English situation in the early 
nineties, but it was all deflected, I said, and all the interest was 
confused by the story of Victor Radnor's fight with society to 
vindicate the woman he had loved and never married.  Now in the 
retrospect and with a mind full of bitter enlightenment, I can do 
Meredith justice, and admit the conflict was not only essential but 
cardinal in his picture, that the terrible inflexibility of the rich 
aunts and the still more terrible claim of Mrs. Burman Radnor, the 
"infernal punctilio," and Dudley Sowerby's limitations, were the 
central substance of that inalertness the book set itself to assail.  
So many things have been brought together in my mind that were once 
remotely separated.  A people that will not valiantly face and 
understand and admit love and passion can understand nothing 
whatever.  But in those days what is now just obvious truth to me 
was altogether outside my range of comprehension. . . .

As I seek to recapitulate the interlacing growth of my apprehension 
of the world, as I flounder among the half-remembered developments 
that found me a crude schoolboy and left me a man, there comes out, 
as if it stood for all the rest, my first holiday abroad.  That did 
not happen until I was twenty-two.  I was a fellow of Trinity, and 
the Peace of Vereeniging had just been signed.
<P>
I went with a man named Willersley, a man some years senior to 
myself, who had just missed a fellowship and the higher division of 
the Civil Service, and who had become an enthusiastic member of the 
London School Board, upon which the cumulative vote and the support 
of the "advanced" people had placed him.  He had, like myself, a 
small independent income that relieved him of any necessity to earn 
a living, and he had a kindred craving for social theorising and 
some form of social service.  He had sought my acquaintance after 
reading a paper of mine (begotten by the visit of Chris Robinson) on 
the limits of pure democracy.  It had marched with some thoughts of 
his own.
<P>
We went by train to Spiez on the Lake of Thun, then up the Gemmi, 
and thence with one or two halts and digressions and a little modest 
climbing we crossed over by the Antrona pass (on which we were 
benighted) into Italy, and by way of Domo D'ossola and the Santa 
Maria Maggiore valley to Cannobio, and thence up the lake to Locarno 
(where, as I shall tell, we stayed some eventful days) and so up the 
Val Maggia and over to Airolo and home.
<P>
As I write of that long tramp of ours, something of its freshness 
and enlargement returns to me.  I feel again the faint pleasant 
excitement of the boat train, the trampling procession of people 
with hand baggage and laden porters along the platform of the 
Folkestone pier, the scarcely perceptible swaying of the moored boat 
beneath our feet.  Then, very obvious and simple, the little emotion 
of standing out from the homeland and seeing the long white Kentish 
cliffs recede.  One walked about the boat doing one's best not to 
feel absurdly adventurous, and presently a movement of people 
directed one's attention to a white lighthouse on a cliff to the 
east of us, coming up suddenly; and then one turned to scan the 
little different French coast villages, and then, sliding by in a 
pale sunshine came a long wooden pier with oddly dressed children 
upon it, and the clustering town of Boulogne.
<P>
One took it all with the outward calm that became a young man of 
nearly three and twenty, but one was alive to one's finger-tips with 
pleasing little stimulations.  The custom house examination excited 
one, the strangeness of a babble in a foreign tongue; one found the 
French of City Merchants' and Cambridge a shy and viscous flow, and 
then one was standing in the train as it went slowly through the 
rail-laid street to Boulogne Ville, and one looked out at the world 
in French, porters in blouses, workmen in enormous purple trousers, 
police officers in peaked caps instead of helmets and romantically 
cloaked, big carts, all on two wheels instead of four, green 
shuttered casements instead of sash windows, and great numbers of 
neatly dressed women in economical mourning.
<P>
"Oh! there's a priest!" one said, and was betrayed into suchlike 
artless cries.
<P>
It was a real other world, with different government and different 
methods, and in the night one was roused from uneasy slumbers and 
sat blinking and surly, wrapped up in one's couverture and with 
one's oreiller all awry, to encounter a new social phenomenon, the 
German official, so different in manner from the British; and when 
one woke again after that one had come to Bale, and out one tumbled 
to get coffee in Switzerland. . . .
<P>
I have been over that route dozens of times since, but it still 
revives a certain lingering youthfulness, a certain sense of 
cheerful release in me.
<P>
I remember that I and Willersley became very sociological as we ran 
on to Spiez, and made all sorts of generalisations from the steeply 
sloping fields on the hillsides, and from the people we saw on 
platforms and from little differences in the way things were done.
<P>
The clean prosperity of Bale and Switzerland, the big clean 
stations, filled me with patriotic misgivings, as I thought of the 
vast dirtiness of London, the mean dirtiness of Cambridgeshire.  It 
came to me that perhaps my scheme of international values was all 
wrong, that quite stupendous possibilities and challenges for us and 
our empire might be developing here--and I recalled Meredith's 
Skepsey in France with a new understanding.
<P>
Willersley had dressed himself in a world-worn Norfolk suit of 
greenish grey tweeds that ended unfamiliarly at his rather 
impending, spectacled, intellectual visage.  I didn't, I remember, 
like the contrast of him with the drilled Swiss and Germans about 
us.  Convict coloured stockings and vast hobnail boots finished him 
below, and all his luggage was a borrowed rucksac that he had tied 
askew.  He did not want to shave in the train, but I made him at one 
of the Swiss stations--I dislike these Oxford slovenlinesses--and 
then confound him! he cut himself and bled. . . .
<P>
Next morning we were breathing a thin exhilarating air that seemed 
to have washed our very veins to an incredible cleanliness, and 
eating hard-boiled eggs in a vast clear space of rime-edged rocks, 
snow-mottled, above a blue-gashed glacier.  All about us the 
monstrous rock surfaces rose towards the shining peaks above, and 
there were winding moraines from which the ice had receded, and then 
dark clustering fir trees far below.
<P>
I had an extraordinary feeling of having come out of things, of 
being outside.
<P>
"But this is the round world!" I said, with a sense of never having 
perceived it before; "this is the round world!"
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
That holiday was full of big comprehensive effects; the first view 
of the Rhone valley and the distant Valaisian Alps, for example, 
which we saw from the shoulder of the mountain above the Gemmi, and 
the early summer dawn breaking over Italy as we moved from our 
night's crouching and munched bread and chocolate and stretched our 
stiff limbs among the tumbled and precipitous rocks that hung over 
Lake Cingolo, and surveyed the winding tiring rocky track going down 
and down to Antronapiano.
<P>
And our thoughts were as comprehensive as our impressions.  
Willersley's mind abounded in historical matter; he had an 
inaccurate abundant habit of topographical reference; he made me see 
and trace and see again the Roman Empire sweep up these winding 
valleys, and the coming of the first great Peace among the warring 
tribes of men. . . .
<P>
In the retrospect each of us seems to have been talking about our 
outlook almost continually.  Each of us, you see, was full of the 
same question, very near and altogether predominant to us, the 
question: "What am I going to do with my life?"  He saw it almost as 
importantly as I, but from a different angle, because his choice was 
largely made and mine still hung in the balance.
<P>
"I feel we might do so many things," I said, "and everything that 
calls one, calls one away from something else."
<P>
Willersley agreed without any modest disavowals.
<P>
"We have got to think out," he said, "just what we are and what we 
are up to.  We've got to do that now.  And then--it's one of those 
questions it is inadvisable to reopen subsequently."
<P>
He beamed at me through his glasses.  The sententious use of long 
words was a playful habit with him, that and a slight deliberate 
humour, habits occasional Extension Lecturing was doing very much to 
intensify.
<P>
"You've made your decision?"
<P>
He nodded with a peculiar forward movement of his head.
<P>
"How would you put it?"
<P>
"Social Service--education.  Whatever else matters or doesn't 
matter, it seems to me there is one thing we MUST have and increase, 
and that is the number of people who can think a little--and have "--
he beamed again--" an adequate sense of causation."
<P>
"You're sure it's worth while."
<P>
"For me--certainly.  I don't discuss that any more."
<P>
"I don't limit myself too narrowly," he added.  "After all, the work 
is all one.  We who know, we who feel, are building the great modern 
state, joining wall to wall and way to way, the new great England 
rising out of the decaying old . . . we are the real statesmen--I 
like that use of 'statesmen.'. . ."
<P>
"Yes," I said with many doubts.  "Yes, of course. . . ."
<P>
Willersley is middle-aged now, with silver in his hair and a 
deepening benevolence in his always amiable face, and he has very 
fairly kept his word.  He has lived for social service and to do 
vast masses of useful, undistinguished, fertilising work.  Think of 
the days of arid administrative plodding and of contention still 
more arid and unrewarded, that he must have spent!  His little 
affectations of gesture and manner, imitative affectations for the 
most part, have increased, and the humorous beam and the humorous 
intonations have become a thing he puts on every morning like an old 
coat.  His devotion is mingled with a considerable whimsicality, and 
they say he is easily flattered by subordinates and easily offended 
into opposition by colleagues; he has made mistakes at times and 
followed wrong courses, still there he is, a flat contradiction to 
all the ordinary doctrine of motives, a man who has foregone any 
chances of wealth and profit, foregone any easier paths to 
distinction, foregone marriage and parentage, in order to serve the 
community.  He does it without any fee or reward except his personal 
self-satisfaction in doing this work, and he does it without any 
hope of future joys and punishments, for he is an implacable 
Rationalist.  No doubt he idealises himself a little, and dreams of 
recognition.  No doubt he gets his pleasure from a sense of power, 
from the spending and husbanding of large sums of public money, and 
from the inevitable proprietorship he must feel in the fair, fine, 
well-ordered schools he has done so much to develop.  "But for me," 
he can say, "there would have been a Job about those diagrams, and 
that subject or this would have been less ably taught." . . .
<P>
The fact remains that for him the rewards have been adequate, if not 
to content at any rate to keep him working.  Of course he covets the 
notice of the world he has served, as a lover covets the notice of 
his mistress.  Of course he thinks somewhere, somewhen, he will get 
credit.  Only last year I heard some men talking of him, and they 
were noting, with little mean smiles, how he had shown himself self-
conscious while there was talk of some honorary degree-giving or 
other; it would, I have no doubt, please him greatly if his work 
were to flower into a crimson gown in some Academic parterre.  Why 
shouldn't it?  But that is incidental vanity at the worst; he goes 
on anyhow.  Most men don't.
<P>
But we had our walk twenty years and more ago now.  He was oldish 
even then as a young man, just as he is oldish still in middle age.  
Long may his industrious elderliness flourish for the good of the 
world!  He lectured a little in conversation then; he lectures more 
now and listens less, toilsomely disentangling what you already 
understand, giving you in detail the data you know; these are things 
like callosities that come from a man's work.
<P>
Our long three weeks' talk comes back to me as a memory of ideas and 
determinations slowly growing, all mixed up with a smell of wood 
smoke and pine woods and huge precipices and remote gleams of snow-
fields and the sound of cascading torrents rushing through deep 
gorges far below.  It is mixed, too, with gossips with waitresses 
and fellow travellers, with my first essays in colloquial German and 
Italian, with disputes about the way to take, and other things that 
I will tell of in another section.  But the white passion of human 
service was our dominant theme.  Not simply perhaps nor altogether 
unselfishly, but quite honestly, and with at least a frequent self-
forgetfulness, did we want to do fine and noble things, to help in 
their developing, to lessen misery, to broaden and exalt life.  It 
is very hard--perhaps it is impossible--to present in a page or two 
the substance and quality of nearly a month's conversation, 
conversation that is casual and discursive in form, that ranges 
carelessly from triviality to immensity, and yet is constantly 
resuming a constructive process, as workmen on a wall loiter and 
jest and go and come back, and all the while build.
<P>
We got it more and more definite that the core of our purpose 
beneath all its varied aspects must needs be order and discipline.  
"Muddle," said I, "is the enemy."  That remains my belief to this 
day.  Clearness and order, light and foresight, these things I know 
for Good.  It was muddle had just given us all the still freshly 
painful disasters and humiliations of the war, muddle that gives us 
the visibly sprawling disorder of our cities and industrial country-
side, muddle that gives us the waste of life, the limitations, 
wretchedness and unemployment of the poor.  Muddle!  I remember 
myself quoting Kipling--
<P>
<P>
    "All along o' dirtiness, all along o' mess,
     All along o' doin' things rather-more-or-less."
<P>
<P>
"We build the state," we said over and over again.  "That is what we 
are for--servants of the new reorganisation!"
<P>
We planned half in earnest and half Utopianising, a League of Social 
Service.
<P>
We talked of the splendid world of men that might grow out of such 
unpaid and ill-paid work as we were setting our faces to do.  We 
spoke of the intricate difficulties, the monstrous passive 
resistances, the hostilities to such a development as we conceived 
our work subserved, and we spoke with that underlying confidence in 
the invincibility of the causes we adopted that is natural to young 
and scarcely tried men.
<P>
We talked much of the detailed life of politics so far as it was 
known to us, and there Willersley was more experienced and far 
better informed than I; we discussed possible combinations and 
possible developments, and the chances of some great constructive 
movement coming from the heart-searchings the Boer war had 
occasioned.  We would sink to gossip--even at the Suetonius level.  
Willersley would decline towards illuminating anecdotes that I 
capped more or less loosely from my private reading.  We were 
particularly wise, I remember, upon the management of newspapers, 
because about that we knew nothing whatever.  We perceived that 
great things were to be done through newspapers.  We talked of 
swaying opinion and moving great classes to massive action.
<P>
Men are egotistical even in devotion.  All our splendid projects 
were thickset with the first personal pronoun.  We both could write, 
and all that we said in general terms was reflected in the 
particular in our minds; it was ourselves we saw, and no others, 
writing and speaking that moving word.  We had already produced 
manuscript and passed the initiations of proof reading; I had been a 
frequent speaker in the Union, and Willersley was an active man on 
the School Board.  Our feet were already on the lower rungs that led 
up and up.  He was six and twenty, and I twenty-two.  We intimated 
our individual careers in terms of bold expectation.  I had 
prophetic glimpses of walls and hoardings clamorous with "Vote for 
Remington," and Willersley no doubt saw himself chairman of this 
committee and that, saying a few slightly ironical words after the 
declaration of the poll, and then sitting friendly beside me on the 
government benches.  There was nothing impossible in such dreams.  
Why not the Board of Education for him?  My preference at that time 
wavered between the Local Government Board--I had great ideas about 
town-planning, about revisions of municipal areas and re-organised 
internal transit--and the War Office.  I swayed strongly towards the 
latter as the journey progressed.  My educational bias came later.
<P>
The swelling ambitions that have tramped over Alpine passes!  How 
many of them, like mine, have come almost within sight of 
realisation before they failed?
<P>
There were times when we posed like young gods (of unassuming 
exterior), and times when we were full of the absurdest little 
solicitudes about our prospects.  There were times when one surveyed 
the whole world of men as if it was a little thing at one's feet, 
and by way of contrast I remember once lying in bed--it must have 
been during this holiday, though I cannot for the life of me fix 
where--and speculating whether perhaps some day I might not be a 
K. C. B., Sir Richard Remington, K. C. B., M. P.
<P>
But the big style prevailed. . . .
<P>
We could not tell from minute to minute whether we were planning for 
a world of solid reality, or telling ourselves fairy tales about 
this prospect of life.  So much seemed possible, and everything we 
could think of so improbable.  There were lapses when it seemed to 
me I could never be anything but just the entirely unimportant and 
undistinguished young man I was for ever and ever.  I couldn't even 
think of myself as five and thirty.
<P>
Once I remember Willersley going over a list of failures, and why 
they had failed--but young men in the twenties do not know much 
about failures.
<P>
<P>

<P>
Willersley and I professed ourselves Socialists, but by this time I 
knew my Rodbertus as well as my Marx, and there was much in our 
socialism that would have shocked Chris Robinson as much as anything 
in life could have shocked him.  Socialism as a simple democratic 
cry we had done with for ever.  We were socialists because 
Individualism for us meant muddle, meant a crowd of separated, 
undisciplined little people all obstinately and ignorantly doing 
things jarringly, each one in his own way.  "Each," I said quoting 
words of my father's that rose apt in my memory, "snarling from his 
own little bit of property, like a dog tied to a cart's tail."
<P>
"Essentially," said Willersley, "essentially we're for conscription, 
in peace and war alike.  The man who owns property is a public 
official and has to behave as such.  That's the gist of socialism as 
I understand it."
<P>
"Or be dismissed from his post," I said, " and replaced by some 
better sort of official.  A man's none the less an official because 
he's irresponsible.  What he does with his property affects people 
just the same.  Private!  No one is really private but an outlaw. . . .
<P>
Order and devotion were the very essence of our socialism, and a 
splendid collective vigour and happiness its end.  We projected an 
ideal state, an organised state as confident and powerful as modern 
science, as balanced and beautiful as a body, as beneficent as 
sunshine, the organised state that should end muddle for ever; it 
ruled all our ideals and gave form to all our ambitions.
<P>
Every man was to be definitely related to that, to have his 
predominant duty to that.  Such was the England renewed we had in 
mind, and how to serve that end, to subdue undisciplined worker and 
undisciplined wealth to it, and make the Scientific Commonweal, 
King, was the continuing substance of our intercourse.
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
Every day the wine of the mountains was stronger in our blood, and 
the flush of our youth deeper.  We would go in the morning sunlight 
along some narrow Alpine mule-path shouting large suggestions for 
national re-organisation, and weighing considerations as lightly as 
though the world was wax in our hands.  "Great England," we said in 
effect, over and over again, "and we will be among the makers!  
England renewed!  The country has been warned; it has learnt its 
lesson.  The disasters and anxieties of the war have sunk in.  
England has become serious. . . .  Oh! there are big things before 
us to do; big enduring things!"
<P>
One evening we walked up to the loggia of a little pilgrimage 
church, I forget its name, that stands out on a conical hill at the 
head of a winding stair above the town of Locarno.  Down below the 
houses clustered amidst a confusion of heat-bitten greenery.   I had 
been sitting silently on the parapet, looking across to the purple 
mountain masses where Switzerland passes into Italy, and the drift 
of our talk seemed suddenly to gather to a head.
<P>
I broke into speech, giving form to the thoughts that had been 
accumulating.  My words have long since passed out of my memory, the 
phrases of familiar expression have altered for me, but the 
substance remains as clear as ever.  I said how we were in our 
measure emperors and kings, men undriven, free to do as we pleased 
with life; we classed among the happy ones, our bread and common 
necessities were given us for nothing, we had abilities,--it wasn't 
modesty but cowardice to behave as if we hadn't--and Fortune watched 
us to see what we might do with opportunity and the world.
<P>
"There are so many things to do, you see," began Willersley, in his 
judicial lecturer's voice.
<P>
"So many things we may do," I interrupted, "with all these years 
before us. . . .  We're exceptional men.  It's our place, our duty, 
to do things."
<P>
"Here anyhow," I said, answering the faint amusement of his face; 
"I've got no modesty.  Everything conspires to set me up.  Why 
should I run about like all those grubby little beasts down there, 
seeking nothing but mean little vanities and indulgencies--and then 
take credit for modesty?  I KNOW I am capable.  I KNOW I have 
imagination.  Modesty!  I know if I don't attempt the very biggest 
things in life I am a damned shirk.  The very biggest!  Somebody has 
to attempt them.  I feel like a loaded gun that is only a little 
perplexed because it has to find out just where to aim itself. . . ."
<P>
The lake and the frontier villages, a white puff of steam on the 
distant railway to Luino, the busy boats and steamers trailing 
triangular wakes of foam, the long vista eastward towards 
battlemented Bellinzona, the vast mountain distances, now tinged 
with sunset light, behind this nearer landscape, and the southward 
waters with remote coast towns shining dimly, waters that merged at 
last in a luminous golden haze, made a broad panoramic spectacle.  
It was as if one surveyed the world,--and it was like the games I 
used to set out upon my nursery floor.  I was exalted by it; I felt 
larger than men.  So kings should feel.
<P>
That sense of largness came to me then, and it has come to me since, 
again and again, a splendid intimation or a splendid vanity.  Once, 
I remember, when I looked at Genoa from the mountain crest behind 
the town and saw that multitudinous place in all its beauty of width 
and abundance and clustering human effort, and once as I was 
steaming past the brown low hills of Staten Island towards the 
towering vigour and clamorous vitality of New York City, that mood 
rose to its quintessence.  And once it came to me, as I shall tell, 
on Dover cliffs.  And a hundred times when I have thought of England 
as our country might be, with no wretched poor, no wretched rich, a 
nation armed and ordered, trained and purposeful amidst its vales 
and rivers, that emotion of collective ends and collective purposes 
has returned to me.  I felt as great as humanity.  For a brief 
moment I was humanity, looking at the world I had made and had still 
to make. . . .
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
And mingled with these dreams of power and patriotic service there 
was another series of a different quality and a different colour, 
like the antagonistic colour of a shot silk.  The white life and the 
red life, contrasted and interchanged, passing swiftly at a turn 
from one to another, and refusing ever to mingle peacefully one with 
the other.  I was asking myself openly and distinctly: what are you 
going to do for the world?  What are you going to do with yourself? 
and with an increasing strength and persistence Nature in spite of 
my averted attention was asking me in penetrating undertones: what 
are you going to do about this other fundamental matter, the beauty 
of girls and women and your desire for them?
<P>
I have told of my sisterless youth and the narrow circumstances of 
my upbringing.  It made all women-kind mysterious to me.  If it had 
not been for my Staffordshire cousins I do not think I should have 
known any girls at all until I was twenty.  Of Staffordshire I will 
tell a little later.  But I can remember still how through all those 
ripening years, the thought of women's beauty, their magic presence 
in the world beside me and the unknown, untried reactions of their 
intercourse, grew upon me and grew, as a strange presence grows in a 
room when one is occupied by other things.  I busied myself and 
pretended to be wholly occupied, and there the woman stood, full 
half of life neglected, and it seemed to my averted mind sometimes 
that she was there clad and dignified and divine, and sometimes 
Aphrodite shining and commanding, and sometimes that Venus who 
stoops and allures.
<P>
This travel abroad seemed to have released a multitude of things in 
my mind; the clear air, the beauty of the sunshine, the very blue of 
the glaciers made me feel my body and quickened all those 
disregarded dreams.  I saw the sheathed beauty of women's forms all 
about me, in the cheerful waitresses at the inns, in the pedestrians 
one encountered in the tracks, in the chance fellow travellers at 
the hotel tables.  "Confound it!" said I, and talked all the more 
zealously of that greater England that was calling us.
<P>
I remember that we passed two Germans, an old man and a tall fair 
girl, father and daughter, who were walking down from Saas.   She 
came swinging and shining towards us, easy and strong.  I worshipped 
her as she approached.
<P>
"Gut Tag!" said Willersley, removing his hat.
<P>
"Morgen!" said the old man, saluting.
<P>
I stared stockishly at the girl, who passed with an indifferent 
face.
<P>
That sticks in my mind as a picture remains in a room, it has kept 
there bright and fresh as a thing seen yesterday, for twenty 
years. . . .
<P>
I flirted hesitatingly once or twice with comely serving girls, and 
was a little ashamed lest Willersley should detect the keen interest 
I took in them, and then as we came over the pass from Santa Maria 
Maggiore to Cannobio, my secret preoccupation took me by surprise 
and flooded me and broke down my pretences.
<P>
The women in that valley are very beautiful--women vary from valley 
to valley in the Alps and are plain and squat here and divinities 
five miles away--and as we came down we passed a group of five or 
six of them resting by the wayside.  Their burthens were beside 
them, and one like Ceres held a reaping hook in her brown hand.  She 
watched us approaching and smiled faintly, her eyes at mine.
<P>
There was some greeting, and two of them laughed together.
<P>
We passed.
<P>
"Glorious girls they were," said Willersley, and suddenly an immense 
sense of boredom enveloped me.  I saw myself striding on down that 
winding road, talking of politics and parties and bills of 
parliament and all sorts of dessicated things.  That road seemed to 
me to wind on for ever down to dust and infinite dreariness.  I knew 
it for a way of death.  Reality was behind us.
<P>
Willersley set himself to draw a sociological moral.  "I'm not so 
sure," he said in a voice of intense discriminations, "after all, 
that agricultural work isn't good for women."
<P>
"Damn agricultural work!" I said, and broke out into a vigorous 
cursing of all I held dear.  "Fettered things we are!" I cried.  "I 
wonder why I stand it!"
<P>
"Stand what?"
<P>
"Why don't I go back and make love to those girls and let the world 
and you and everything go hang?  Deep breasts and rounded limbs--and 
we poor emasculated devils go tramping by with the blood of youth in 
us! . . ."
<P>
"I'm not quite sure, Remington," said Willersley, looking at me with 
a deliberately quaint expression over his glasses, "that picturesque 
scenery is altogether good for your morals."
<P>
That fever was still in my blood when we came to Locarno.
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
Along the hot and dusty lower road between the Orrido of Traffiume 
and Cannobio Willersley had developed his first blister.  And partly 
because of that and partly because there was a bag at the station 
that gave us the refreshment of clean linen and partly because of 
the lazy lower air into which we had come, we decided upon three or 
four days' sojourn in the Empress Hotel.
<P>
We dined that night at a table-d'hote, and I found myself next to an 
Englishwoman who began a conversation that was resumed presently in 
the hotel lounge.  She was a woman of perhaps thirty-three or 
thirty-four, slenderly built, with a warm reddish skin and very 
abundant fair golden hair, the wife of a petulant-looking heavy-
faced man of perhaps fifty-three, who smoked a cigar and dozed over 
his coffee and presently went to bed.  "He always goes to bed like 
that," she confided startlingly.  "He sleeps after all his meals.  I 
never knew such a man to sleep."
<P>
Then she returned to our talk, whatever it was.
<P>
We had begun at the dinner table with itineraries and the usual 
topographical talk, and she had envied our pedestrian travel.  "My 
husband doesn't walk," she said.  "His heart is weak and he cannot 
manage the hills."
<P>
There was something friendly and adventurous in her manner; she 
conveyed she liked me, and when presently Willersley drifted off to 
write letters our talk sank at once to easy confidential undertones.  
I felt enterprising, and indeed it is easy to be daring with people 
one has never seen before and may never see again.  I said I loved 
beautiful scenery and all beautiful things, and the pointing note in 
my voice made her laugh.  She told me I had bold eyes, and so far as 
I can remember I said she made them bold.  "Blue they are," she 
remarked, smiling archly.  "I like blue eyes."  Then I think we 
compared ages, and she said she was the Woman of Thirty, "George 
Moore's Woman of Thirty."
<P>
I had not read George Moore at the time, but I pretended to 
understand.
<P>
That, I think, was our limit that evening.  She went to bed, smiling 
good-night quite prettily down the big staircase, and I and 
Willersley went out to smoke in the garden.  My head was full of 
her, and I found it necessary to talk about her.  So I made her a 
problem in sociology.  "Who the deuce are these people?" I said, and 
how do they get a living?  They seem to have plenty of money.  He 
strikes me as being--Willersley, what is a drysalter?  I think he's 
a retired drysalter."
<P>
Willersley theorised while I thought of the woman and that 
provocative quality of dash she had displayed.  The next day at 
lunch she and I met like old friends.  A huge mass of private 
thinking during the interval had been added to our effect upon one 
another.  We talked for a time of insignificant things.
<P>
"What do you do," she asked rather quickly, "after lunch?  Take a 
siesta?"
<P>
"Sometimes," I said, and hung for a moment eye to eye.
<P>
We hadn't a doubt of each other, but my heart was beating like a 
steamer propeller when it lifts out of the water.
<P>
"Do you get a view from your room?" she asked after a pause.
<P>
"It's on the third floor, Number seventeen, near the staircase.  My 
friend's next door."
<P>
She began to talk of books.  She was interested in Christian 
Science, she said, and spoke of a book.  I forget altogether what 
that book was called, though I remember to this day with the utmost 
exactness the purplish magenta of its cover.  She said she would 
lend it to me and hesitated.
<P>
Wlllersley wanted to go for an expedition across the lake that 
afternoon, but I refused.  He made some other proposals that I 
rejected abruptly.  " I shall write in my room," I said.
<P>
"Why not write down here?"
<P>
"I shall write in my room," I snarled like a thwarted animal, and he 
looked at me curiously.  "Very well," he said; "then I'll make some 
notes and think about that order of ours out under the magnolias."
<P>
I hovered about the lounge for a time buying postcards and 
feverishly restless, watching the movements of the other people.  
Finally I went up to my room and sat down by the windows, staring 
out.  There came a little tap at the unlocked door and in an 
instant, like the go of a taut bowstring, I was up and had it open.
<P>
"Here is that book," she said, and we hesitated.
<P>
"COME IN!" I whispered, trembling from head to foot.
<P>
"You're just a boy," she said in a low tone.
<P>
I did not feel a bit like a lover, I felt like a burglar with the 
safe-door nearly opened.  "Come in," I said almost impatiently, for 
anyone might be in the passage, and I gripped her wrist and drew her 
towards me.
<P>
"What do you mean?" she answered with a faint smile on her lips, and 
awkward and yielding.
<P>
I shut the door behind her, still holding her with one hand, then 
turned upon her--she was laughing nervously--and without a word drew 
her to me and kissed her.  And I remember that as I kissed her she 
made a little noise almost like the purring miaow with which a cat 
will greet one and her face, close to mine, became solemn and 
tender.
<P>
She was suddenly a different being from the discontented wife who 
had tapped a moment since on my door, a woman transfigured. . . .
<P>
That evening I came down to dinner a monster of pride, for behold! I 
was a man.  I felt myself the most wonderful and unprecedented of 
adventurers.  It was hard to believe that any one in the world 
before had done as much.  My mistress and I met smiling, we carried 
things off admirably, and it seemed to me that Willersley was the 
dullest old dog in the world.  I wanted to give him advice.  I 
wanted to give him derisive pokes.  After dinner and coffee in the 
lounge I was too excited and hilarious to go to bed, I made him come 
with me down to the cafe under the arches by the pier, and there 
drank beer and talked extravagant nonsense about everything under 
the sun, in order not to talk about the happenings of the afternoon.  
All the time something shouted within me: "I am a man!  I am a 
man!" . . .
<P>
"What shall we do to-morrow?" said he.
<P>
"I'm for loafing," I said.  "Let's row in the morning and spend to-
morrow afternoon just as we did to-day."
<P>
"They say the church behind the town is worth seeing."
<P>
"We'll go up about sunset; that's the best time for it.  We can 
start about five."
<P>
We heard music, and went further along the arcade to discover a 
place where girls in operatic Swiss peasant costume were singing and 
dancing on a creaking, protesting little stage.  I eyed their 
generous display of pink neck and arm with the seasoned eye of a man 
who has lived in the world.  Life was perfectly simple and easy, I 
felt, if one took it the right way.
<P>
Next day Willersley wanted to go on, but I delayed.  Altogether I 
kept him back four days.  Then abruptly my mood changed, and we 
decided to start early the following morning.  I remember, though a 
little indistinctly, the feeling of my last talk with that woman 
whose surname, odd as it may seem, either I never learnt or I have 
forgotten.  (Her christian name was Milly.)  She was tired and 
rather low-spirited, and disposed to be sentimental, and for the 
first time in our intercourse I found myself liking her for the sake 
of her own personality.  There was something kindly and generous 
appearing behind the veil of naive and uncontrolled sensuality she 
had worn.  There was a curious quality of motherliness in her 
attitude to me that something in my nature answered and approved.  
She didn't pretend to keep it up that she had yielded to my 
initiative.  "I've done you no harm," she said a little doubtfully, 
an odd note for a man's victim!  And, "we've had a good time.  You 
have liked me, haven't you?"
<P>
She interested me in her lonely dissatisfied life; she was childless 
and had no hope of children, and her husband was the only son of a 
rich meat salesman, very mean, a mighty smoker--"he reeks of it," 
she said, "always"--and interested in nothing but golf, billiards 
(which he played very badly), pigeon shooting, convivial Free 
Masonry and Stock Exchange punting.  Mostly they drifted about the 
Riviera.  Her mother had contrived her marriage when she was 
eighteen.  They were the first samples I ever encountered of the 
great multitude of functionless property owners which encumbers 
modern civilisation--but at the time I didn't think much of that 
aspect of them. . . .
<P>
I tell all this business as it happened without comment, because I 
have no comment to make.  It was all strange to me, strange rather 
than wonderful, and, it may be, some dream of beauty died for ever 
in those furtive meetings; it happened to me, and I could scarcely 
have been more irresponsible in the matter or controlled events less 
if I had been suddenly pushed over a cliff into water.  I swam, of 
course--finding myself in it.  Things tested me, and I reacted, as I 
have told.  The bloom of my innocence, if ever there had been such a 
thing, was gone.  And here is the remarkable thing about it; at the 
time and for some days I was over-weeningly proud; I have never been 
so proud before or since; I felt I had been promoted to virility; I 
was unable to conceal my exultation from Willersley.  It was a mood 
of shining shameless ungracious self-approval.  As he and I went 
along in the cool morning sunshine by the rice fields in the throat 
of the Val Maggia a silence fell between us.
<P>
"You know?" I said abruptly,--"about that woman?"
<P>
Willersley did not answer for a moment.  He looked at me over the 
corner of his spectacles.
<P>
"Things went pretty far?" he asked.
<P>
"Oh! all the way!" and I had a twinge of fatuous pride in my 
unpremeditated achievement.
<P>
"She came to your room?"
<P>
I nodded.
<P>
"I heard her.  I heard her whispering. . . .  The whispering and 
rustling and so on.  I was in my room yesterday. . . .  Any one 
might have heard you."
<P>
I went on with my head in the air.
<P>
"You might have been caught, and that would have meant endless 
trouble.  You might have incurred all sorts of consequences.  What 
did you know about her? . . .  We have wasted four days in that hot 
close place.  When we found that League of Social Service we were 
talking about," he said with a determined eye upon me, "chastity 
will be first among the virtues prescribed."
<P>
"I shall form a rival league," I said a little damped.  "I'm hanged 
if I give up a single desire in me until I know why."
<P>
He lifted his chin and stared before him through his glasses at 
nothing.  "There are some things," he said, "that a man who means to 
work--to do great public services--MUST turn his back upon.  I'm not 
discussing the rights or wrongs of this sort of thing.  It happens 
to be the conditions we work under.  It will probably always be so.  
If you want to experiment in that way, if you want even to discuss 
it,--out you go from political life.  You must know that's so. . . .  
You're a strange man, Remington, with a kind of kink in you.  You've 
a sort of force.  You might happen to do immense things. . . .  
Only--"
<P>
He stopped.  He had said all that he had forced himself to say.
<P>
"I mean to take myself as I am," I said.  "I'm going to get 
experience for humanity out of all my talents--and bury nothing."
<P>
Willersley twisted his face to its humorous expression.  "I doubt if 
sexual proclivities," he said drily, come within the scope of the 
parable."
<P>
I let that go for a little while.  Then I broke out.  "Sex!" said I, 
"is a fundamental thing in life.  We went through all this at 
Trinity.  I'm going to look at it, experience it, think about it--
and get it square with the rest of life.  Career and Politics must 
take their chances of that.  It's part of the general English 
slackness that they won't look this in the face.  Gods! what a 
muffled time we're coming out of!  Sex means breeding, and breeding 
is a necessary function in a nation.  The Romans broke up upon that.  
The Americans fade out amidst their successes.  Eugenics--"
<P>
"THAT wasn't Eugenics," said Willersley.
<P>
"It was a woman," I said after a little interval, feeling oddly that 
I had failed altogether to answer him, and yet had a strong dumb 
case against him.
<P>
