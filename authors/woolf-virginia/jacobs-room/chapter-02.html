<p>"<em>MRS. FLANDERS"&mdash;"</em>Poor Betty Flanders"&mdash;"Dear Betty"&mdash;"She's
very attractive still"&mdash;"Odd she don't marry again!" "There's
Captain Barfoot to be sure&mdash;calls every Wednesday as regular as
clockwork, and never brings his wife."</p>

<p>"But that's Ellen Barfoot's fault," the ladies of Scarborough
said. "She don't put herself out for no one."</p>

<p>"A man likes to have a son&mdash;that we know."</p>

<p>"Some tumours have to be cut; but the sort my mother had you
bear with for years and years, and never even have a cup of tea
brought up to you in bed."</p>

<p>(Mrs. Barfoot was an invalid.)</p>

<p>Elizabeth Flanders, of whom this and much more than this had
been said and would be said, was, of course, a widow in her prime.
She was half-way between forty and fifty. Years and sorrow between
them; the death of Seabrook, her husband; three boys; poverty;
a house on the outskirts of Scarborough; her brother, poor Morty's,
downfall and possible demise&mdash;for where was he? what was he? Shading
her eyes, she looked along the road for Captain Barfoot&mdash;yes,
there he was, punctual as ever; the attentions of the Captain&mdash;all
ripened Betty Flanders, enlarged her figure, tinged her face with
jollity, and flooded her eyes for no reason that any one could
see perhaps three times a day.</p>

<p>True, there's no harm in crying for one's husband, and the tombstone,
though plain, was a solid piece of work, and on summer's days
when the widow brought her boys to stand there one felt kindly
towards her. Hats were raised higher than usual; wives tugged
their husbands' arms. Seabrook lay six foot beneath, dead these
many years; enclosed in three shells; the crevices sealed with
lead, so that, had earth and wood been glass, doubtless his very
face lay visible beneath, the face of a young man whiskered, shapely,
who had gone out duck-shooting and refused to change his boots.</p>

<p>"Merchant of this city," the tombstone said; though why Betty
Flanders had chosen so to call him when, as many still remembered,
he had only sat behind an office window for three months, and
before that had broken horses, ridden to hounds, farmed a few
fields, and run a little wild&mdash;well, she had to call him something.
An example for the boys.</p>

<p>Had he, then, been nothing? An unanswerable question, since even
if it weren't the habit of the undertaker to close the eyes, the
light so soon goes out of them. At first, part of herself; now
one of a company, he had merged in the grass, the sloping hillside,
the thousand white stones, some slanting, others upright, the
decayed wreaths, the crosses of green tin, the narrow yellow paths,
and the lilacs that drooped in April, with a scent like that of
an invalid's bedroom, over the churchyard wall. Seabrook was now
all that; and when, with her skirt hitched up, feeding the chickens,
she heard the bell for service or funeral, that was Seabrook's
voice&mdash;the voice of the dead.</p>

<p>The rooster had been known to fly on her shoulder and peck her
neck, so that now she carried a stick or took one of the children
with her when she went to feed the fowls.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like my knife, mother?" said Archer.</p>

<p>Sounding at the same moment as the bell, her son's voice mixed
life and death inextricably, exhilaratingly.</p>

<p>"What a big knife for a small boy!" she said. She took it to
please him. Then the rooster flew out of the hen-house, and, shouting
to Archer to shut the door into the kitchen garden, Mrs. Flanders
set her meal down, clucked for the hens, went bustling about the
orchard, and was seen from over the way by Mrs. Cranch, who, beating
her mat against the wall, held it for a moment suspended while
she observed to Mrs. Page next door that Mrs. Flanders was in
the orchard with the chickens.</p>

<p>Mrs. Page, Mrs. Cranch, and Mrs. Garfit could see Mrs. Flanders
in the orchard because the orchard was a piece of Dods Hill enclosed;
and Dods Hill dominated the village. No words can exaggerate the
importance of Dods Hill. It was the earth; the world against the
sky; the horizon of how many glances can best be computed by those
who have lived all their lives in the same village, only leaving
it once to fight in the Crimea, like old George Garfit, leaning
over his garden gate smoking his pipe. The progress of the sun
was measured by it; the tint of the day laid against it to be
judged.</p>

<p>"Now she's going up the hill with little John," said Mrs. Cranch
to Mrs. Garfit, shaking her mat for the last time, and bustling
indoors. Opening the orchard gate, Mrs. Flanders walked to the
top of Dods Hill, holding John by the hand. Archer and Jacob ran
in front or lagged behind; but they were in the Roman fortress
when she came there, and shouting out what ships were to be seen
in the bay. For there was a magnificent view &mdash;moors behind, sea
in front, and the whole of Scarborough from one end to the other
laid out flat like a puzzle. Mrs. Flanders, who was growing stout,
sat down in the fortress and looked about her.</p>

<p>The entire gamut of the view's changes should have been known
to her; its winter aspect, spring, summer and autumn; how storms
came up from the sea; how the moors shuddered and brightened as
the clouds went over; she should have noted the red spot where
the villas were building; and the criss-cross of lines where the
allotments were cut; and the diamond flash of little glass houses
in the sun. Or, if details like these escaped her, she might have
let her fancy play upon the gold tint of the sea at sunset, and
thought how it lapped in coins of gold upon the shingle. Little
pleasure boats shoved out into it; the black arm of the pier hoarded
it up. The whole city was pink and gold; domed; mist-wreathed;
resonant; strident. Banjoes strummed; the parade smelt of tar
which stuck to the heels; goats suddenly cantered their carriages
through crowds. It was observed how well the Corporation had laid
out the flower-beds. Sometimes a straw hat was blown away. Tulips
burnt in the sun. Numbers of sponge-bag trousers were stretched
in rows. Purple bonnets fringed soft, pink, querulous faces on
pillows in bath chairs. Triangular hoardings were wheeled along
by men in white coats. Captain George Boase had caught a monster
shark. One side of the triangular hoarding said so in red, blue,
and yellow letters; and each line ended with three differently
coloured notes of exclamation.</p>

<p>So that was a reason for going down into the Aquarium, where
the sallow blinds, the stale smell of spirits of salt, the bamboo
chairs, the tables with ash-trays, the revolving fish, the attendant
knitting behind six or seven chocolate boxes (often she was quite
alone with the fish for hours at a time) remained in the mind
as part of the monster shark, he himself being only a flabby yellow
receptacle, like an empty Gladstone bag in a tank. No one had
ever been cheered by the Aquarium; but the faces of those emerging
quickly lost their dim, chilled expression when they perceived
that it was only by standing in a queue that one could be admitted
to the pier. Once through the turnstiles, every one walked for
a yard or two very briskly; some flagged at this stall; others
at that.</p>

<p>But it was the band that drew them all to it finally; even the
fishermen on the lower pier taking up their pitch within its range.</p>

<p>The band played in the Moorish kiosk. Number nine went up on
the board. It was a waltz tune. The pale girls, the old widow
lady, the three Jews lodging in the same boarding-house, the dandy,
the major, the horse-dealer, and the gentleman of independent
means, all wore the same blurred, drugged expression, and through
the chinks in the planks at their feet they could see the green
summer waves, peacefully, amiably, swaying round the iron pillars
of the pier.</p>

<p>But there was a time when none of this had any existence (thought
the young man leaning against the railings). Fix your eyes upon
the lady's skirt; the grey one will do&mdash;above the pink silk stockings.
It changes; drapes her ankles&mdash;the nineties; then it amplifies&mdash;the
seventies; now it's burnished red and stretched above a crinoline&mdash;the
sixties; a tiny black foot wearing a white cotton stocking peeps
out. Still sitting there? Yes&mdash;she's still on the pier. The silk
now is sprigged with roses, but somehow one no longer sees so
clearly. There's no pier beneath us. The heavy chariot may swing
along the turnpike road, but there's no pier for it to stop at,
and how grey and turbulent the sea is in the seventeenth century!
Let's to the museum. Cannon-balls; arrow-heads; Roman glass and
a forceps green with verdigris. The Rev. Jaspar Floyd dug them
up at his own expense early in the forties in the Roman camp on
Dods Hill&mdash;see the little ticket with the faded writing on it.</p>

<p>And now, what's the next thing to see in Scarborough?</p>

<p>Mrs. Flanders sat on the raised circle of the Roman camp, patching
Jacob's breeches; only looking up as she sucked the end of her
cotton, or when some insect dashed at her, boomed in her ear,
and was gone.</p>

<p>John kept trotting up and slapping down in her lap grass or dead
leaves which he called "tea," and she arranged them methodically
but absent-mindedly, laying the flowery heads of the grasses together,
thinking how Archer had been awake again last night; the church
clock was ten or thirteen minutes fast; she wished she could buy
Garfit's acre.</p>

<p>"That's an orchid leaf, Johnny. Look at the little brown spots.
Come, my dear. We must go home. Ar-cher! Ja-cob!"</p>

<p>"Ar-cher! Ja-cob!" Johnny piped after her, pivoting round on
his heel, and strewing the grass and leaves in his hands as if
he were sowing seed. Archer and Jacob jumped up from behind the
mound where they had been crouching with the intention of springing
upon their mother unexpectedly, and they all began to walk slowly
home.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" said Mrs. Flanders, shading her eyes.</p>

<p>"That old man in the road?" said Archer, looking below.</p>

<p>"He's not an old man," said Mrs. Flanders. "He's&mdash;no, he's not
&mdash;I thought it was the Captain, but it's Mr. Floyd. Come
along, boys."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother Mr. Floyd!" said Jacob, switching off a thistle's
head, for he knew already that Mr. Floyd was going to teach them
Latin, as indeed he did for three years in his spare time, out
of kindness, for there was no other gentleman in the neighbourhood
whom Mrs. Flanders could have asked to do such a thing, and the
elder boys were getting beyond her, and must be got ready for
school, and it was more than most clergymen would have done, coming
round after tea, or having them in his own room &mdash;as he could
fit it in&mdash;for the parish was a very large one, and Mr. Floyd,
like his father before him, visited cottages miles away on the
moors, and, like old Mr. Floyd, was a great scholar, which made
it so unlikely&mdash;she had never dreamt of such a thing. Ought she
to have guessed? But let alone being a scholar he was eight years
younger than she was. She knew his mother&mdash;old Mrs. Floyd. She
had tea there. And it was that very evening when she came back
from having tea with old Mrs. Floyd that she found the note in
the hall and took it into the kitchen with her when she went to
give Rebecca the fish, thinking it must be something about the
boys.</p>

<p>"Mr. Floyd brought it himself, did he? &mdash;I think the cheese
must be in the parcel in the hall&mdash;oh, in the hall&mdash;" for she
was reading. No, it was not about the boys.</p>

<p>"Yes, enough for fish-cakes to-morrow certainly &mdash;Perhaps
Captain Barfoot&mdash;" she had come to the word "love." She went into
the garden and read, leaning against the walnut tree to steady
herself. Up and down went her breast. Seabrook came so vividly
before her. She shook her head and was looking through her tears
at the little shifting leaves against the yellow sky when three
geese, half-running, half-flying, scuttled across the lawn with
Johnny behind them, brandishing a stick.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flanders flushed with anger.</p>

<p>"How many times have I told you?" she cried, and seized him and
snatched his stick away from him.</p>

<p>"But they'd escaped!" he cried, struggling to get free.</p>

<p>"You're a very naughty boy. If I've told you once, I've told
you a thousand times. I won't have you chasing the geese!" she
said, and crumpling Mr. Floyd's letter in her hand, she held Johnny
fast and herded the geese back into the orchard.</p>

<p>"How could I think of marriage!" she said to herself bitterly,
as she fastened the gate with a piece of wire. She had always
disliked red hair in men, she thought, thinking of Mr. Floyd's
appearance, that night when the boys had gone to bed. And pushing
her work-box away, she drew the blotting-paper towards her, and
read Mr. Floyd's letter again, and her breast went up and down
when she came to the word "love," but not so fast this time, for
she saw Johnny chasing the geese, and knew that it was impossible
for her to marry any one&mdash;let alone Mr. Floyd, who was so much
younger than she was, but what a nice man&mdash;and such a scholar
too.</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Floyd," she wrote.&mdash;"Did I forget about the cheese?"
she wondered, laying down her pen. No, she had told Rebecca that
the cheese was in the hall. "I am much surprised..." she wrote.</p>

<p>But the letter which Mr. Floyd found on the table when he got
up early next morning did not begin "I am much surprised," and
it was such a motherly, respectful, inconsequent, regretful letter
that he kept it for many years; long after his marriage with Miss
Wimbush, of Andover; long after he had left the village. For he
asked for a parish in Sheffield, which was given him; and, sending
for Archer, Jacob, and John to say good-bye, he told them to choose
whatever they liked in his study to remember him by. Archer chose
a paper-knife, because he did not like to choose anything too
good; Jacob chose the works of Byron in one volume; John, who
was still too young to make a proper choice, chose Mr. Floyd's
kitten, which his brothers thought an absurd choice, but Mr. Floyd
upheld him when he said: "It has fur like you." Then Mr. Floyd
spoke about the King's Navy (to which Archer was going); and about
Rugby (to which Jacob was going); and next day he received a silver
salver and went&mdash;first to Sheffield, where he met Miss Wimbush,
who was on a visit to her uncle, then to Hackney&mdash;then to Maresfield
House, of which he became the principal, and finally, becoming
editor of a well-known series of Ecclesiastical Biographies, he
retired to Hampstead with his wife and daughter, and is often
to be seen feeding the ducks on Leg of Mutton Pond. As for Mrs.
Flanders's letter&mdash;when he looked for it the other day he could
not find it, and did not like to ask his wife whether she had
put it away. Meeting Jacob in Piccadilly lately, he recognized
him after three seconds. But Jacob had grown such a fine young
man that Mr. Floyd did not like to stop him in the street.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Mrs. Flanders, when she read in the Scarborough
and Harrogate Courier that the Rev. Andrew Floyd, etc., etc.,
had been made Principal of Maresfield House, "that must be our
Mr. Floyd."</p>

<p>A slight gloom fell upon the table. Jacob was helping himself
to jam; the postman was talking to Rebecca in the kitchen; there
was a bee humming at the yellow flower which nodded at the open
window. They were all alive, that is to say, while poor Mr. Floyd
was becoming Principal of Maresfield House.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flanders got up and went over to the fender and stroked
Topaz on the neck behind the ears.</p>

<p>"Poor Topaz," she said (for Mr. Floyd's kitten was now a very
old cat, a little mangy behind the ears, and one of these days
would have to be killed).</p>

<p>"Poor old Topaz," said Mrs. Flanders, as he stretched himself
out in the sun, and she smiled, thinking how she had had him gelded,
and how she did not like red hair in men. Smiling, she went into
the kitchen.</p>

<p>Jacob drew rather a dirty pocket-handkerchief across his face.
He went upstairs to his room.</p>

<p>The stag-beetle dies slowly (it was John who collected the beetles).
Even on the second day its legs were supple. But the butterflies
were dead. A whiff of rotten eggs had vanquished the pale clouded
yellows which came pelting across the orchard and up Dods Hill
and away on to the moor, now lost behind a furze bush, then off
again helter-skelter in a broiling sun. A fritillary basked on
a white stone in the Roman camp. From the valley came the sound
of church bells. They were all eating roast beef in Scarborough;
for it was Sunday when Jacob caught the pale clouded yellows in
the clover field, eight miles from home.</p>

<p>Rebecca had caught the death's-head moth in the kitchen.</p>

<p>A strong smell of camphor came from the butterfly boxes.</p>

<p>Mixed with the smell of camphor was the unmistakable smell of
seaweed. Tawny ribbons hung on the door. The sun beat straight
upon them.</p>

<p>The upper wings of the moth which Jacob held were undoubtedly
marked with kidney-shaped spots of a fulvous hue. But there was
no crescent upon the underwing. The tree had fallen the night
he caught it. There had been a volley of pistol-shots suddenly
in the depths of the wood. And his mother had taken him for a
burglar when he came home late. The only one of her sons who never
obeyed her, she said.</p>

<p>Morris called it "an extremely local insect found in damp or
marshy places." But Morris is sometimes wrong. Sometimes Jacob,
choosing a very fine pen, made a correction in the margin.</p>

<p>The tree had fallen, though it was a windless night, and the
lantern, stood upon the ground, had lit up the still green leaves
and the dead beech leaves. It was a dry place. A toad was there.
And the red underwing had circled round the light and flashed
and gone. The red underwing had never come back, though Jacob
had waited. It was after twelve when he crossed the lawn and saw
his mother in the bright room, playing patience, sitting up.</p>

<p>"How you frightened me!" she had cried. She thought something
dreadful had happened. And he woke Rebecca, who had to be up so
early.</p>

<p>There he stood pale, come out of the depths of darkness, in the
hot room, blinking at the light.</p>

<p>No, it could not be a straw-bordered underwing.</p>

<p>The mowing-machine always wanted oiling. Barnet turned it under
Jacob's window, and it creaked&mdash;creaked, and rattled across the
lawn and creaked again.</p>

<p>Now it was clouding over.</p>

<p>Back came the sun, dazzlingly.</p>

<p>It fell like an eye upon the stirrups, and then suddenly and
yet very gently rested upon the bed, upon the alarum clock, and
upon the butterfly box stood open. The pale clouded yellows had
pelted over the moor; they had zigzagged across the purple clover.
The fritillaries flaunted along the hedgerows. The blues settled
on little bones lying on the turf with the sun beating on them,
and the painted ladies and the peacocks feasted upon bloody entrails
dropped by a hawk. Miles away from home, in a hollow among teasles
beneath a ruin, he had found the commas. He had seen a white admiral
circling higher and higher round an oak tree, but he had never
caught it. An old cottage woman living alone, high up, had told
him of a purple butterfly which came every summer to her garden.
The fox cubs played in the gorse in the early morning, she told
him. And if you looked out at dawn you could always see two badgers.
Sometimes they knocked each other over like two boys fighting,
she said.</p>

<p>"You won't go far this afternoon, Jacob," said his mother, popping
her head in at the door, "for the Captain's coming to say good-bye."
It was the last day of the Easter holidays.</p>

<p>Wednesday was Captain Barfoot's day. He dressed himself very
neatly in blue serge, took his rubber-shod stick&mdash;for he was lame
and wanted two fingers on the left hand, having served his country&mdash;and
set out from the house with the flagstaff precisely at four o'clock
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>At three Mr. Dickens, the bath-chair man, had called for Mrs.
Barfoot.</p>

<p>"Move me," she would say to Mr. Dickens, after sitting on the
esplanade for fifteen minutes. And again, "That'll do, thank you,
Mr. Dickens." At the first command he would seek the sun; at the
second he would stay the chair there in the bright strip.</p>

<p>An old inhabitant himself, he had much in common with Mrs. Barfoot
&mdash;James Coppard's daughter. The drinking-fountain, where
West Street joins Broad Street, is the gift of James Coppard,
who was mayor at the time of Queen Victoria's jubilee, and Coppard
is painted upon municipal watering-carts and over shop windows,
and upon the zinc blinds of solicitors' consulting-room windows.
But Ellen Barfoot never visited the Aquarium (though she had known
Captain Boase who had caught the shark quite well), and when the
men came by with the posters she eyed them superciliously, for
she knew that she would never see the Pierrots, or the brothers
Zeno, or Daisy Budd and her troupe of performing seals. For Ellen
Barfoot in her bath-chair on the esplanade was a prisoner&mdash;civilization's
prisoner&mdash;all the bars of her cage falling across the esplanade
on sunny days when the town hall, the drapery stores, the swimming-bath,
and the memorial hall striped the ground with shadow.</p>

<p>An old inhabitant himself, Mr. Dickens would stand a little behind
her, smoking his pipe. She would ask him questions&mdash;who people
were&mdash;who now kept Mr. Jones's shop&mdash;then about the season&mdash;and
had Mrs. Dickens tried, whatever it might be&mdash;the words issuing
from her lips like crumbs of dry biscuit.</p>

<p>She closed her eyes. Mr. Dickens took a turn. The feelings of
a man had not altogether deserted him, though as you saw him coming
towards you, you noticed how one knobbed black boot swung tremulously
in front of the other; how there was a shadow between his waistcoat
and his trousers; how he leant forward unsteadily, like an old
horse who finds himself suddenly out of the shafts drawing no
cart. But as Mr. Dickens sucked in the smoke and puffed it out
again, the feelings of a man were perceptible in his eyes. He
was thinking how Captain Barfoot was now on his way to Mount Pleasant;
Captain Barfoot, his master. For at home in the little sitting-room
above the mews, with the canary in the window, and the girls at
the sewing-machine, and Mrs. Dickens huddled up with the rheumatics&mdash;at
home where he was made little of, the thought of being in the
employ of Captain Barfoot supported him. He liked to think that
while he chatted with Mrs. Barfoot on the front, he helped the
Captain on his way to Mrs. Flanders. He, a man, was in charge
of Mrs. Barfoot, a woman.</p>

<p>Turning, he saw that she was chatting with Mrs. Rogers. Turning
again, he saw that Mrs. Rogers had moved on. So he came back to
the bath-chair, and Mrs. Barfoot asked him the time, and he took
out his great silver watch and told her the time very obligingly,
as if he knew a great deal more about the time and everything
than she did. But Mrs. Barfoot knew that Captain Barfoot was on
his way to Mrs. Flanders.</p>

<p>Indeed he was well on his way there, having left the tram, and
seeing Dods Hill to the south-east, green against a blue sky that
was suffused with dust colour on the horizon. He was marching
up the hill. In spite of his lameness there was something military
in his approach. Mrs. Jarvis, as she came out of the Rectory gate,
saw him coming, and her Newfoundland dog, Nero, slowly swept his
tail from side to side.</p>

<p>"Oh, Captain Barfoot!" Mrs. Jarvis exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Good-day, Mrs. Jarvis," said the Captain.</p>

<p>They walked on together, and when they reached Mrs. Flanders's
gate Captain Barfoot took off his tweed cap, and said, bowing
very courteously:</p>

<p>"Good-day to you, Mrs. Jarvis."</p>

<p>And Mrs. Jarvis walked on alone.</p>

<p>She was going to walk on the moor. Had she again been pacing
her lawn late at night? Had she again tapped on the study window
and cried: "Look at the moon, look at the moon, Herbert!"</p>

<p>And Herbert looked at the moon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jarvis walked on the moor when she was unhappy, going as
far as a certain saucer-shaped hollow, though she always meant
to go to a more distant ridge; and there she sat down, and took
out the little book hidden beneath her cloak and read a few lines
of poetry, and looked about her. She was not very unhappy, and,
seeing that she was forty-five, never perhaps would be very unhappy,
desperately unhappy that is, and leave her husband, and ruin a
good man's career, as she sometimes threatened.</p>

<p>Still there is no need to say what risks a clergyman's wife runs
when she walks on the moor. Short, dark, with kindling eyes, a
pheasant's feather in her hat, Mrs. Jarvis was just the sort of
woman to lose her faith upon the moors&mdash;to confound her God with
the universal that is&mdash;but she did not lose her faith, did not
leave her husband, never read her poem through, and went on walking
the moors, looking at the moon behind the elm trees, and feeling
as she sat on the grass high above Scarborough... Yes, yes, when
the lark soars; when the sheep, moving a step or two onwards,
crop the turf, and at the same time set their bells tinkling;
when the breeze first blows, then dies down, leaving the cheek
kissed; when the ships on the sea below seem to cross each other
and pass on as if drawn by an invisible hand; when there are distant
concussions in the air and phantom horsemen galloping, ceasing;
when the horizon swims blue, green, emotional&mdash;then Mrs. Jarvis,
heaving a sigh, thinks to herself, "If only some one could give
me... if I could give some one...." But she does not know what
she wants to give, nor who could give it her.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Flanders stepped out only five minutes ago, Captain," said
Rebecca. Captain Barfoot sat him down in the arm-chair to wait.
Resting his elbows on the arms, putting one hand over the other,
sticking his lame leg straight out, and placing the stick with
the rubber ferrule beside it, he sat perfectly still. There was
something rigid about him. Did he think? Probably the same thoughts
again and again. But were they "nice" thoughts, interesting thoughts?
He was a man with a temper; tenacious, faithful. Women would have
felt, "Here is law. Here is order. Therefore we must cherish this
man. He is on the Bridge at night," and, handing him his cup,
or whatever it might be, would run on to visions of shipwreck
and disaster, in which all the passengers come tumbling from their
cabins, and there is the captain, buttoned in his pea-jacket,
matched with the storm, vanquished by it but by none other. "Yet
I have a soul," Mrs. Jarvis would bethink her, as Captain Barfoot
suddenly blew his nose in a great red bandanna handkerchief, "and
it's the man's stupidity that's the cause of this, and the storm's
my storm as well as his"... so Mrs. Jarvis would bethink her when
the Captain dropped in to see them and found Herbert out, and
spent two or three hours, almost silent, sitting in the arm-chair.
But Betty Flanders thought nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>"Oh, Captain," said Mrs. Flanders, bursting into the drawing-room,
"I had to run after Barker's man... I hope Rebecca... I hope Jacob..."</p>

<p>She was very much out of breath, yet not at all upset, and as
she put down the hearth-brush which she had bought of the oil-man,
she said it was hot, flung the window further open, straightened
a cover, picked up a book, as if she were very confident, very
fond of the Captain, and a great many years younger than he was.
Indeed, in her blue apron she did not look more than thirty-five.
He was well over fifty.</p>

<p>She moved her hands about the table; the Captain moved his head
from side to side, and made little sounds, as Betty went on chattering,
completely at his ease&mdash;after twenty years.</p>

<p>"Well," he said at length, "I've heard from Mr. Polegate."</p>

<p>He had heard from Mr. Polegate that he could advise nothing better
than to send a boy to one of the universities.</p>

<p>"Mr. Floyd was at Cambridge... no, at Oxford... well, at one
or the other," said Mrs. Flanders.</p>

<p>She looked out of the window. Little windows, and the lilac and
green of the garden were reflected in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Archer is doing very well," she said. "I have a very nice report
from Captain Maxwell."</p>

<p>"I will leave you the letter to show Jacob," said the Captain,
putting it clumsily back in its envelope.</p>

<p>"Jacob is after his butterflies as usual," said Mrs. Flanders
irritably, but was surprised by a sudden afterthought, "Cricket
begins this week, of course."</p>

<p>"Edward Jenkinson has handed in his resignation," said Captain
Barfoot.</p>

<p>"Then you will stand for the Council?" Mrs. Flanders exclaimed,
looking the Captain full in the face.</p>

<p>"Well, about that," Captain Barfoot began, settling himself rather
deeper in his chair.</p>

<p>Jacob Flanders, therefore, went up to Cambridge in October, 1906.</p>
