<p>'Well, Mabel, and what are you going to do with yourself?' asked Joe,
with foolish flippancy. He felt quite safe himself. Without listening for
an answer, he turned aside, worked a grain of tobacco to the tip of his
tongue, and spat it out. He did not care about anything, since he felt
safe himself.</p>

<p>The three brothers and the sister sat round the desolate breakfast table,
attempting some sort of desultory consultation. The morning's post had
given the final tap to the family fortunes, and all was over. The dreary
dining-room itself, with its heavy mahogany furniture, looked as if it
were waiting to be done away with.</p>

<p>But the consultation amounted to nothing. There was a strange air of
ineffectuality about the three men, as they sprawled at table, smoking
and reflecting vaguely on their own condition. The girl was alone, a
rather short, sullen-looking young woman of twenty-seven. She did not
share the same life as her brothers. She would have been good-looking,
save for the impassive fixity of her face, 'bull-dog', as her brothers
called it.</p>

<p>There was a confused tramping of horses' feet outside. The three men all
sprawled round in their chairs to watch. Beyond the dark holly-bushes
that separated the strip of lawn from the highroad, they could see a
cavalcade of shire horses swinging out of their own yard, being taken for
exercise. This was the last time. These were the last horses that would
go through their hands. The young men watched with critical, callous
look. They were all frightened at the collapse of their lives, and the
sense of disaster in which they were involved left them no inner freedom.</p>

<p>Yet they were three fine, well-set fellows enough. Joe, the eldest, was a
man of thirty-three, broad and handsome in a hot, flushed way. His face
was red, he twisted his black moustache over a thick finger, his eyes
were shallow and restless. He had a sensual way of uncovering his teeth
when he laughed, and his bearing was stupid. Now he watched the horses
with a glazed look of helplessness in his eyes, a certain stupor of
downfall.</p>

<p>The great draught-horses swung past. They were tied head to tail, four of
them, and they heaved along to where a lane branched off from the
highroad, planting their great hoofs floutingly in the fine black mud,
swinging their great rounded haunches sumptuously, and trotting a few
sudden steps as they were led into the lane, round the corner. Every
movement showed a massive, slumbrous strength, and a stupidity which held
them in subjection. The groom at the head looked back, jerking the
leading rope. And the calvalcade moved out of sight up the lane, the tail
of the last horse, bobbed up tight and stiff, held out taut from the
swinging great haunches as they rocked behind the hedges in a motionlike
sleep.</p>

<p>Joe watched with glazed hopeless eyes. The horses were almost like his
own body to him. He felt he was done for now. Luckily he was engaged to a
woman as old as himself, and therefore her father, who was steward of a
neighbouring estate, would provide him with a job. He would marry and go
into harness. His life was over, he would be a subject animal now.</p>

<p>He turned uneasily aside, the retreating steps of the horses echoing in
his ears. Then, with foolish restlessness, he reached for the scraps of
bacon-rind from the plates, and making a faint whistling sound, flung
them to the terrier that lay against the fender. He watched the dog
swallow them, and waited till the creature looked into his eyes. Then a
faint grin came on his face, and in a high, foolish voice he said:</p>

<p>'You won't get much more bacon, shall you, you little b -  - ?'</p>

<p>The dog faintly and dismally wagged its tail, then lowered his haunches,
circled round, and lay down again.</p>

<p>There was another helpless silence at the table. Joe sprawled uneasily in
his seat, not willing to go till the family conclave was dissolved. Fred
Henry, the second brother, was erect, clean-limbed, alert. He had watched
the passing of the horses with more <span style="text-decoration: underline">sang-froid</span>. If he was an animal,
like Joe, he was an animal which controls, not one which is controlled.
He was master of any horse, and he carried himself with a well-tempered
air of mastery. But he was not master of the situations of life. He
pushed his coarse brown moustache upwards, off his lip, and glanced
irritably at his sister, who sat impassive and inscrutable.</p>

<p>'You'll go and stop with Lucy for a bit, shan't you?' he asked. The girl
did not answer.</p>

<p>'I don't see what else you can do,' persisted Fred Henry.</p>

<p>'Go as a skivvy,' Joe interpolated laconically.</p>

<p>The girl did not move a muscle.</p>

<p>'If I was her, I should go in for training for a nurse,' said Malcolm,
the youngest of them all. He was the baby of the family, a young man of
twenty-two, with a fresh, jaunty <span style="text-decoration: underline">museau</span>.</p>

<p>But Mabel did not take any notice of him. They had talked at her and
round her for so many years, that she hardly heard them at all.</p>

<p>The marble clock on the mantel-piece softly chimed the half-hour, the dog
rose uneasily from the hearthrug and looked at the party at the breakfast
table. But still they sat on in ineffectual conclave.</p>

<p>'Oh, all right,' said Joe suddenly, <span style="text-decoration: underline">&agrave; propos</span> of nothing. 'I'll get a
move on.'</p>

<p>He pushed back his chair, straddled his knees with a downward jerk, to
get them free, in horsy fashion, and went to the fire. Still he did not
go out of the room; he was curious to know what the others would do or
say. He began to charge his pipe, looking down at the dog and saying, in
a high, affected voice:</p>

<p>'Going wi' me? Going wi' me are ter? Tha'rt goin' further than tha counts
on just now, dost hear?'</p>

<p>The dog faintly wagged its tail, the man stuck out his jaw and covered
his pipe with his hands, and puffed intently, losing himself in the
tobacco, looking down all the while at the dog with an absent brown eye.
The dog looked up at him in mournful distrust. Joe stood with his knees
stuck out, in real horsy fashion.</p>

<p>'Have you had a letter from Lucy?' Fred Henry asked of his sister.</p>

<p>'Last week,' came the neutral reply.</p>

<p>'And what does she say?'</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>'Does she <span style="text-decoration: underline">ask</span> you to go and stop there?' persisted Fred Henry.</p>

<p>'She says I can if I like.'</p>

<p>'Well, then, you'd better. Tell her you'll come on Monday.'</p>

<p>This was received in silence.</p>

<p>'That's what you'll do then, is it?' said Fred Henry, in some
exasperation.</p>

<p>But she made no answer. There was a silence of futility and irritation in
the room. Malcolm grinned fatuously.</p>

<p>'You'll have to make up your mind between now and next Wednesday,' said
Joe loudly, 'or else find yourself lodgings on the kerbstone.'</p>

<p>The face of the young woman darkened, but she sat on immutable.</p>

<p>'Here's Jack Fergusson!' exclaimed Malcolm, who was looking aimlessly out
of the window.</p>

<p>'Where?' exclaimed Joe, loudly.</p>

<p>'Just gone past.'</p>

<p>'Coming in?'</p>

<p>Malcolm craned his neck to see the gate.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said.</p>

<p>There was a silence. Mabel sat on like one condemned, at the head of the
table. Then a whistle was heard from the kitchen. The dog got up and
barked sharply. Joe opened the door and shouted:</p>

<p>'Come on.'</p>

<p>After a moment a young man entered. He was muffled up in overcoat and a
purple woollen scarf, and his tweed cap, which he did not remove, was
pulled down on his head. He was of medium height, his face was rather
long and pale, his eyes looked tired.</p>

<p>'Hello, Jack! Well, Jack!' exclaimed Malcolm and Joe. Fred Henry merely
said, 'Jack.'</p>

<p>'What's doing?' asked the newcomer, evidently addressing Fred Henry.</p>

<p>'Same. We've got to be out by Wednesday. - Got a cold?'</p>

<p>'I have - got it bad, too.'</p>

<p>'Why don't you stop in?'</p>

<p>'<span style="text-decoration: underline">Me</span> stop in? When I can't stand on my legs, perhaps I shall have a
chance.' The young man spoke huskily. He had a slight Scotch accent.</p>

<p>'It's a knock-out, isn't it,' said Joe, boisterously, 'if a doctor goes
round croaking with a cold. Looks bad for the patients, doesn't it?'</p>

<p>The young doctor looked at him slowly.</p>

<p>'Anything the matter with <span style="text-decoration: underline">you</span>, then?' he asked sarcastically.</p>

<p>'Not as I know of. Damn your eyes, I hope not. Why?'</p>

<p>'I thought you were very concerned about the patients, wondered if you
might be one yourself.'</p>

<p>'Damn it, no, I've never been patient to no flaming doctor, and hope I
never shall be,' returned Joe.</p>

<p>At this point Mabel rose from the table, and they all seemed to become
aware of her existence. She began putting the dishes together. The young
doctor looked at her, but did not address her. He had not greeted her.
She went out of the room with the tray, her face impassive and unchanged.</p>

<p>'When are you off then, all of you?' asked the doctor.</p>

<p>'I'm catching the eleven-forty,' replied Malcolm. 'Are you goin' down wi'
th' trap, Joe?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I've told you I'm going down wi' th' trap, haven't I?'</p>

<p>'We'd better be getting her in then. - So long, Jack, if I don't see you
before I go,' said Malcolm, shaking hands.</p>

<p>He went out, followed by Joe, who seemed to have his tail between his
legs.</p>

<p>'Well, this is the devil's own,' exclaimed the doctor, when he was left
alone with Fred Henry. 'Going before Wednesday, are you?'</p>

<p>'That's the orders,' replied the other.</p>

<p>'Where, to Northampton?'</p>

<p>'That's it.'</p>

<p>'The devil!' exclaimed Fergusson, with quiet chagrin.</p>

<p>And there was silence between the two.</p>

<p>'All settled up, are you?' asked Fergusson.</p>

<p>'About.'</p>

<p>There was another pause.</p>

<p>'Well, I shall miss yer, Freddy, boy,' said the young doctor.</p>

<p>'And I shall miss thee, Jack,' returned the other.</p>

<p>'Miss you like hell,' mused the doctor.</p>

<p>Fred Henry turned aside. There was nothing to say. Mabel came in again,
to finish clearing the table.</p>

<p>'What are <span style="text-decoration: underline">you</span> going to do, then, Miss Pervin?' asked Fergusson. 'Going
to your sister's, are you?'</p>

<p>Mabel looked at him with her steady, dangerous eyes, that always made him
uncomfortable, unsettling his superficial ease.</p>

<p>'No,' she said.</p>

<p>'Well, what in the name of fortune <span style="text-decoration: underline">are</span> you going to do? Say what you
mean to do,' cried Fred Henry, with futile intensity.</p>

<p>But she only averted her head, and continued her work. She folded the
white table-cloth, and put on the chenille cloth.</p>

<p>'The sulkiest bitch that ever trod!' muttered her brother.</p>

<p>But she finished her task with perfectly impassive face, the young doctor
watching her interestedly all the while. Then she went out.</p>

<p>Fred Henry stared after her, clenching his lips, his blue eyes fixing in
sharp antagonism, as he made a grimace of sour exasperation.</p>

<p>'You could bray her into bits, and that's all you'd get out of her,' he
said, in a small, narrowed tone.</p>

<p>The doctor smiled faintly.</p>

<p>'What's she <span style="text-decoration: underline">going</span> to do, then?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Strike me if I know!' returned the other.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Then the doctor stirred.</p>

<p>'I'll be seeing you tonight, shall I?' he said to his friend.</p>

<p>'Ay - where's it to be? Are we going over to Jessdale?'</p>

<p>'I don't know. I've got such a cold on me. I'll come round to the Moon
and Stars, anyway.'</p>

<p>'Let Lizzie and May miss their night for once, eh?'</p>

<p>'That's it - if I feel as I do now.'</p>

<p>'All's one - '</p>

<p>The two young men went through the passage and down to the back door
together. The house was large, but it was servantless now, and desolate.
At the back was a small bricked house-yard, and beyond that a big square,
gravelled fine and red, and having stables on two sides. Sloping, dank,
winter-dark fields stretched away on the open sides.</p>

<p>But the stables were empty. Joseph Pervin, the father of the family, had
been a man of no education, who had become a fairly large horse dealer.
The stables had been full of horses, there was a great turmoil and
come-and-go of horses and of dealers and grooms. Then the kitchen was
full of servants. But of late things had declined. The old man had
married a second time, to retrieve his fortunes. Now he was dead and
everything was gone to the dogs, there was nothing but debt and
threatening.</p>

<p>For months, Mabel had been servantless in the big house, keeping the home
together in penury for her ineffectual brothers. She had kept house for
ten years. But previously, it was with unstinted means. Then, however
brutal and coarse everything was, the sense of money had kept her proud,
confident. The men might be foul-mouthed, the women in the kitchen might
have bad reputations, her brothers might have illegitimate children. But
so long as there was money, the girl felt herself established, and
brutally proud, reserved.</p>

<p>No company came to the house, save dealers and coarse men. Mabel had no
associates of her own sex, after her sister went away. But she did not
mind. She went regularly to church, she attended to her father. And she
lived in the memory of her mother, who had died when she was fourteen,
and whom she had loved. She had loved her father, too, in a different
way, depending upon him, and feeling secure in him, until at the age of
fifty-four he married again. And then she had set hard against him. Now
he had died and left them all hopelessly in debt.</p>

<p>She had suffered badly during the period of poverty. Nothing, however,
could shake the curious sullen, animal pride that dominated each member
of the family. Now, for Mabel, the end had come. Still she would not cast
about her. She would follow her own way just the same. She would always
hold the keys of her own situation. Mindless and persistent, she endured
from day to day. Why should she think? Why should she answer anybody? It
was enough that this was the end, and there was no way out. She need not
pass any more darkly along the main street of the small town, avoiding
every eye. She need not demean herself any more, going into the shops and
buying the cheapest food. This was at an end. She thought of nobody, not
even of herself. Mindless and persistent, she seemed in a sort of ecstasy
to be coming nearer to her fulfilment, her own glorification, approaching
her dead mother, who was glorified.</p>

<p>In the afternoon she took a little bag, with shears and sponge and a
small scrubbing brush, and went out. It was a grey, wintry day, with
saddened, dark-green fields and an atmosphere blackened by the smoke of
foundries not far off. She went quickly, darkly along the causeway,
heeding nobody, through the town to the churchyard.</p>

<p>There she always felt secure, as if no one could see her, although as a
matter of fact she was exposed to the stare of everyone who passed along
under the churchyard wall. Nevertheless, once under the shadow of the
great looming church, among the graves, she felt immune from the world,
reserved within the thick churchyard wall as in another country.</p>

<p>Carefully she clipped the grass from the grave, and arranged the
pinky-white, small chrysanthemums in the tin cross. When this was done,
she took an empty jar from a neighbouring grave, brought water, and
carefully, most scrupulously sponged the marble headstone and the
coping-stone.</p>

<p>It gave her sincere satisfaction to do this. She felt in immediate
contact with the world of her mother. She took minute pains, went through
the park in a state bordering on pure happiness, as if in performing this
task she came into a subtle, intimate connexion with her mother. For the
life she followed here in the world was far less real than the world of
death she inherited from her mother.</p>

<p>The doctor's house was just by the church. Fergusson, being a mere hired
assistant, was slave to the countryside. As he hurried now to attend to
the outpatients in the surgery, glancing across the graveyard with his
quick eye, he saw the girl at her task at the grave. She seemed so intent
and remote, it was like looking into another world. Some mystical element
was touched in him. He slowed down as he walked, watching her as if
spell-bound.</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes, feeling him looking. Their eyes met. And each looked
again at once, each feeling, in some way, found out by the other. He
lifted his cap and passed on down the road. There remained distinct in
his consciousness, like a vision, the memory of her face, lifted from the
tombstone in the churchyard, and looking at him with slow, large,
portentous eyes. It <span style="text-decoration: underline">was</span> portentous, her face. It seemed to mesmerize
him. There was a heavy power in her eyes which laid hold of his whole
being, as if he had drunk some powerful drug. He had been feeling weak
and done before. Now the life came back into him, he felt delivered from
his own fretted, daily self.</p>

<p>He finished his duties at the surgery as quickly as might be, hastily
filling up the bottles of the waiting people with cheap drugs. Then, in
perpetual haste, he set off again to visit several cases in another part
of his round, before teatime. At all times he preferred to walk, if he
could, but particularly when he was not well. He fancied the motion
restored him.</p>

<p>The afternoon was falling. It was grey, deadened, and wintry, with a
slow, moist, heavy coldness sinking in and deadening all the faculties.
But why should he think or notice? He hastily climbed the hill and turned
across the dark-green fields, following the black cinder-track. In the
distance, across a shallow dip in the country, the small town was
clustered like smouldering ash, a tower, a spire, a heap of low, raw,
extinct houses. And on the nearest fringe of the town, sloping into the
dip, was Oldmeadow, the Pervins' house. He could see the stables and the
outbuildings distinctly, as they lay towards him on the slope. Well, he
would not go there many more times! Another resource would be lost to
him, another place gone: the only company he cared for in the alien, ugly
little town he was losing. Nothing but work, drudgery, constant hastening
from dwelling to dwelling among the colliers and the iron-workers. It
wore him out, but at the same time he had a craving for it. It was a
stimulant to him to be in the homes of the working people, moving as it
were through the innermost body of their life. His nerves were excited
and gratified. He could come so near, into the very lives of the rough,
inarticulate, powerfully emotional men and women. He grumbled, he said he
hated the hellish hole. But as a matter of fact it excited him, the
contact with the rough, strongly-feeling people was a stimulant applied
direct to his nerves.</p>

<p>Below Oldmeadow, in the green, shallow, soddened hollow of fields, lay a
square, deep pond. Roving across the landscape, the doctor's quick eye
detected a figure in black passing through the gate of the field, down
towards the pond. He looked again. It would be Mabel Pervin. His mind
suddenly became alive and attentive.</p>

<p>Why was she going down there? He pulled up on the path on the slope
above, and stood staring. He could just make sure of the small black
figure moving in the hollow of the failing day. He seemed to see her in
the midst of such obscurity, that he was like a clairvoyant, seeing
rather with the mind's eye than with ordinary sight. Yet he could see her
positively enough, whilst he kept his eye attentive. He felt, if he
looked away from her, in the thick, ugly falling dusk, he would lose her
altogether.</p>

<p>He followed her minutely as she moved, direct and intent, like something
transmitted rather than stirring in voluntary activity, straight down the
field towards the pond. There she stood on the bank for a moment. She
never raised her head. Then she waded slowly into the water.</p>

<p>He stood motionless as the small black figure walked slowly and
deliberately towards the centre of the pond, very slowly, gradually
moving deeper into the motionless water, and still moving forward as the
water got up to her breast. Then he could see her no more in the dusk of
the dead afternoon.</p>

<p>'There!' he exclaimed. 'Would you believe it?'</p>

<p>And he hastened straight down, running over the wet, soddened fields,
pushing through the hedges, down into the depression of callous wintry
obscurity. It took him several minutes to come to the pond. He stood on
the bank, breathing heavily. He could see nothing. His eyes seemed to
penetrate the dead water. Yes, perhaps that was the dark shadow of her
black clothing beneath the surface of the water.</p>

<p>He slowly ventured into the pond. The bottom was deep, soft clay, he sank
in, and the water clasped dead cold round his legs. As he stirred he
could smell the cold, rotten clay that fouled up into the water. It was
objectionable in his lungs. Still, repelled and yet not heeding, he moved
deeper into the pond. The cold water rose over his thighs, over his
loins, upon his abdomen. The lower part of his body was all sunk in the
hideous cold element. And the bottom was so deeply soft and uncertain, he
was afraid of pitching with his mouth underneath. He could not swim, and
was afraid.</p>

<p>He crouched a little, spreading his hands under the water and moving them
round, trying to feel for her. The dead cold pond swayed upon his chest.
He moved again, a little deeper, and again, with his hands underneath, he
felt all around under the water. And he touched her clothing. But it
evaded his fingers. He made a desperate effort to grasp it.</p>

<p>And so doing he lost his balance and went under, horribly, suffocating in
the foul earthy water, struggling madly for a few moments. At last, after
what seemed an eternity, he got his footing, rose again into the air and
looked around. He gasped, and knew he was in the world. Then he looked at
the water. She had risen near him. He grasped her clothing, and drawing
her nearer, turned to take his way to land again.</p>

<p>He went very slowly, carefully, absorbed in the slow progress. He rose
higher, climbing out of the pond. The water was now only about his legs;
he was thankful, full of relief to be out of the clutches of the pond. He
lifted her and staggered on to the bank, out of the horror of wet, grey
clay.</p>

<p>He laid her down on the bank. She was quite unconscious and running with
water. He made the water come from her mouth, he worked to restore her.
He did not have to work very long before he could feel the breathing
begin again in her; she was breathing naturally. He worked a little
longer. He could feel her live beneath his hands; she was coming back. He
wiped her face, wrapped her in his overcoat, looked round into the dim,
dark-grey world, then lifted her and staggered down the bank and across
the fields.</p>

<p>It seemed an unthinkably long way, and his burden so heavy he felt he
would never get to the house. But at last he was in the stable-yard, and
then in the house-yard. He opened the door and went into the house. In
the kitchen he laid her down on the hearthrug, and called. The house was
empty. But the fire was burning in the grate.</p>

<p>Then again he kneeled to attend to her. She was breathing regularly, her
eyes were wide open and as if conscious, but there seemed something
missing in her look. She was conscious in herself, but unconscious of her
surroundings.</p>

<p>He ran upstairs, took blankets from a bed, and put them before the fire
to warm. Then he removed her saturated, earthy-smelling clothing, rubbed
her dry with a towel, and wrapped her naked in the blankets. Then he went
into the dining-room, to look for spirits. There was a little whisky. He
drank a gulp himself, and put some into her mouth.</p>

<p>The effect was instantaneous. She looked full into his face, as if she
had been seeing him for some time, and yet had only just become conscious
of him.</p>

<p>'Dr. Fergusson?' she said.</p>

<p>'What?' he answered.</p>

<p>He was divesting himself of his coat, intending to find some dry clothing
upstairs. He could not bear the smell of the dead, clayey water, and he
was mortally afraid for his own health.</p>

<p>'What did I do?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Walked into the pond,' he replied. He had begun to shudder like one
sick, and could hardly attend to her. Her eyes remained full on him, he
seemed to be going dark in his mind, looking back at her helplessly. The
shuddering became quieter in him, his life came back in him, dark and
unknowing, but strong again.</p>

<p>'Was I out of my mind?' she asked, while her eyes were fixed on him all
the time.</p>

<p>'Maybe, for the moment,' he replied. He felt quiet, because his strength
had come back. The strange fretful strain had left him.</p>

<p>'Am I out of my mind now?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Are you?' he reflected a moment. 'No,' he answered truthfully, 'I don't
see that you are.' He turned his face aside. He was afraid now, because
he felt dazed, and felt dimly that her power was stronger than his, in
this issue. And she continued to look at him fixedly all the time. 'Can
you tell me where I shall find some dry things to put on?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Did you dive into the pond for me?' she asked.</p>

<p>'No,' he answered. 'I walked in. But I went in overhead as well.'</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. He hesitated. He very much wanted to go
upstairs to get into dry clothing. But there was another desire in him.
And she seemed to hold him. His will seemed to have gone to sleep, and
left him, standing there slack before her. But he felt warm inside
himself. He did not shudder at all, though his clothes were sodden on
him.</p>

<p>'Why did you?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Because I didn't want you to do such a foolish thing,' he said.</p>

<p>'It wasn't foolish,' she said, still gazing at him as she lay on the
floor, with a sofa cushion under her head. 'It was the right thing to do.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> knew best, then.'</p>

<p>'I'll go and shift these wet things,' he said. But still he had not the
power to move out of her presence, until she sent him. It was as if she
had the life of his body in her hands, and he could not extricate
himself. Or perhaps he did not want to.</p>

<p>Suddenly she sat up. Then she became aware of her own immediate
condition. She felt the blankets about her, she knew her own limbs. For a
moment it seemed as if her reason were going. She looked round, with wild
eye, as if seeking something. He stood still with fear. She saw her
clothing lying scattered.</p>

<p>'Who undressed me?' she asked, her eyes resting full and inevitable on
his face.</p>

<p>'I did,' he replied, 'to bring you round.'</p>

<p>For some moments she sat and gazed at him awfully, her lips parted.</p>

<p>'Do you love me then?' she asked.</p>

<p>He only stood and stared at her, fascinated. His soul seemed to melt.</p>

<p>She shuffled forward on her knees, and put her arms round him, round his
legs, as he stood there, pressing her breasts against his knees and
thighs, clutching him with strange, convulsive certainty, pressing his
thighs against her, drawing him to her face, her throat, as she looked up
at him with flaring, humble eyes, of transfiguration, triumphant in first
possession.</p>

<p>'You love me,' she murmured, in strange transport, yearning and
triumphant and confident. 'You love me. I know you love me, I know.'</p>

<p>And she was passionately kissing his knees, through the wet clothing,
passionately and indiscriminately kissing his knees, his legs, as if
unaware of every thing.</p>

<p>He looked down at the tangled wet hair, the wild, bare, animal shoulders.
He was amazed, bewildered, and afraid. He had never thought of loving
her. He had never wanted to love her. When he rescued her and restored
her, he was a doctor, and she was a patient. He had had no single
personal thought of her. Nay, this introduction of the personal element
was very distasteful to him, a violation of his professional honour. It
was horrible to have her there embracing his knees. It was horrible. He
revolted from it, violently. And yet - and yet - he had not the power to
break away.</p>

<p>She looked at him again, with the same supplication of powerful love, and
that same transcendent, frightening light of triumph. In view of the
delicate flame which seemed to come from her face like a light, he was
powerless. And yet he had never intended to love her. He had never
intended. And something stubborn in him could not give way.</p>

<p>'You love me,' she repeated, in a murmur of deep, rhapsodic assurance.
'You love me.'</p>

<p>Her hands were drawing him, drawing him down to her. He was afraid, even
a little horrified. For he had, really, no intention of loving her. Yet
her hands were drawing him towards her. He put out his hand quickly to
steady himself, and grasped her bare shoulder. A flame seemed to burn the
hand that grasped her soft shoulder. He had no intention of loving her:
his whole will was against his yielding. It was horrible. And yet
wonderful was the touch of her shoulders, beautiful the shining of her
face. Was she perhaps mad? He had a horror of yielding to her. Yet
something in him ached also.</p>

<p>He had been staring away at the door, away from her. But his hand
remained on her shoulder. She had gone suddenly very still. He looked
down at her. Her eyes were now wide with fear, with doubt, the light was
dying from her face, a shadow of terrible greyness was returning. He
could not bear the touch of her eyes' question upon him, and the look of
death behind the question.</p>

<p>With an inward groan he gave way, and let his heart yield towards her. A
sudden gentle smile came on his face. And her eyes, which never left his
face, slowly, slowly filled with tears. He watched the strange water rise
in her eyes, like some slow fountain coming up. And his heart seemed to
burn and melt away in his breast.</p>

<p>He could not bear to look at her any more. He dropped on his knees and
caught her head with his arms and pressed her face against his throat.
She was very still. His heart, which seemed to have broken, was burning
with a kind of agony in his breast. And he felt her slow, hot tears
wetting his throat. But he could not move.</p>

<p>He felt the hot tears wet his neck and the hollows of his neck, and he
remained motionless, suspended through one of man's eternities. Only now
it had become indispensable to him to have her face pressed close to him;
he could never let her go again. He could never let her head go away from
the close clutch of his arm. He wanted to remain like that for ever, with
his heart hurting him in a pain that was also life to him. Without
knowing, he was looking down on her damp, soft brown hair.</p>

<p>Then, as it were suddenly, he smelt the horrid stagnant smell of that
water. And at the same moment she drew away from him and looked at him.
Her eyes were wistful and unfathomable. He was afraid of them, and he
fell to kissing her, not knowing what he was doing. He wanted her eyes
not to have that terrible, wistful, unfathomable look.</p>

<p>When she turned her face to him again, a faint delicate flush was
glowing, and there was again dawning that terrible shining of joy in her
eyes, which really terrified him, and yet which he now wanted to see,
because he feared the look of doubt still more.</p>

<p>'You love me?' she said, rather faltering.</p>

<p>'Yes.' The word cost him a painful effort. Not because it wasn't true.
But because it was too newly true, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">saying</span> seemed to tear open again
his newly-torn heart. And he hardly wanted it to be true, even now.</p>

<p>She lifted her face to him, and he bent forward and kissed her on the
mouth, gently, with the one kiss that is an eternal pledge. And as he
kissed her his heart strained again in his breast. He never intended to
love her. But now it was over. He had crossed over the gulf to her, and
all that he had left behind had shrivelled and become void.</p>

<p>After the kiss, her eyes again slowly filled with tears. She sat still,
away from him, with her face drooped aside, and her hands folded in her
lap. The tears fell very slowly. There was complete silence. He too sat
there motionless and silent on the hearthrug. The strange pain of his
heart that was broken seemed to consume him. That he should love her?
That this was love! That he should be ripped open in this way! - Him, a
doctor! - How they would all jeer if they knew! - It was agony to him to
think they might know.</p>

<p>In the curious naked pain of the thought he looked again to her. She was
sitting there drooped into a muse. He saw a tear fall, and his heart
flared hot. He saw for the first time that one of her shoulders was quite
uncovered, one arm bare, he could see one of her small breasts; dimly,
because it had become almost dark in the room.</p>

<p>'Why are you crying?' he asked, in an altered voice.</p>

<p>She looked up at him, and behind her tears the consciousness of her
situation for the first time brought a dark look of shame to her eyes.</p>

<p>'I'm not crying, really,' she said, watching him half frightened.</p>

<p>He reached his hand, and softly closed it on her bare arm.</p>

<p>'I love you! I love you!' he said in a soft, low vibrating voice, unlike
himself.</p>

<p>She shrank, and dropped her head. The soft, penetrating grip of his hand
on her arm distressed her. She looked up at him.</p>

<p>'I want to go,' she said. 'I want to go and get you some dry things.'</p>

<p>'Why?' he said. 'I'm all right.'</p>

<p>'But I want to go,' she said. 'And I want you to change your things.'</p>

<p>He released her arm, and she wrapped herself in the blanket, looking at
him rather frightened. And still she did not rise.</p>

<p>'Kiss me,' she said wistfully.</p>

<p>He kissed her, but briefly, half in anger.</p>

<p>Then, after a second, she rose nervously, all mixed up in the blanket. He
watched her in her confusion, as she tried to extricate herself and wrap
herself up so that she could walk. He watched her relentlessly, as she
knew. And as she went, the blanket trailing, and as he saw a glimpse of
her feet and her white leg, he tried to remember her as she was when he
had wrapped her in the blanket. But then he didn't want to remember,
because she had been nothing to him then, and his nature revolted from
remembering her as she was when she was nothing to him.</p>

<p>A tumbling, muffled noise from within the dark house startled him. Then
he heard her voice: - 'There are clothes.' He rose and went to the foot of
the stairs, and gathered up the garments she had thrown down. Then he
came back to the fire, to rub himself down and dress. He grinned at his
own appearance when he had finished.</p>

<p>The fire was sinking, so he put on coal. The house was now quite dark,
save for the light of a street-lamp that shone in faintly from beyond the
holly trees. He lit the gas with matches he found on the mantel-piece.
Then he emptied the pockets of his own clothes, and threw all his wet
things in a heap into the scullery. After which he gathered up her sodden
clothes, gently, and put them in a separate heap on the copper-top in the
scullery.</p>

<p>It was six o'clock on the clock. His own watch had stopped. He ought to
go back to the surgery. He waited, and still she did not come down. So he
went to the foot of the stairs and called:</p>

<p>'I shall have to go.'</p>

<p>Almost immediately he heard her coming down. She had on her best dress
of black voile, and her hair was tidy, but still damp. She looked at
him - and in spite of herself, smiled.</p>

<p>'I don't like you in those clothes,' she said.</p>

<p>'Do I look a sight?' he answered.</p>

<p>They were shy of one another.</p>

<p>'I'll make you some tea,' she said.</p>

<p>'No, I must go.'</p>

<p>'Must you?' And she looked at him again with the wide, strained, doubtful
eyes. And again, from the pain of his breast, he knew how he loved her.
He went and bent to kiss her, gently, passionately, with his heart's
painful kiss.</p>

<p>'And my hair smells so horrible,' she murmured in distraction. 'And I'm
so awful, I'm so awful! Oh, no, I'm too awful.' And she broke into
bitter, heart-broken sobbing. 'You can't want to love me, I'm horrible.'</p>

<p>'Don't be silly, don't be silly,' he said, trying to comfort her, kissing
her, holding her in his arms. 'I want you, I want to marry you, we're
going to be married, quickly, quickly - to-morrow if I can.'</p>

<p>But she only sobbed terribly, and cried:</p>

<p>'I feel awful. I feel awful. I feel I'm horrible to you.'</p>

<p>'No, I want you, I want you,' was all he answered, blindly, with that
terrible intonation which frightened her almost more than her horror lest
he should <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> want her.</p>
