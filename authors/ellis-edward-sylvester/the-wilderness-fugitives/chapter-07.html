<p>There was one matter that caused Ned Clinton so much uneasiness
that he appealed to the Mohawk to know whether some attention
should not be paid to it. That was the report of the gun which
they had heard while on the way to, and only a short distance
from, this place. If a gun was fired, it followed that some one
must have fired it, and the probabilities were the marksman was
not far away. Such was the view of the young scout when he reflected
upon the affair. Furthermore, nothing seemed so likely to attract
the notice of friend or foe, at night, as the blazing camp fire&mdash;the
most conspicuous object possible at such a time in the forest.</p>

<p>Lena-Wingo was not the one to forget an occurrence like the firing
of a gun, and when the question was put to him by Ned, he answered
in the most satisfactory manner. Upon his first approach to the
camp fire, when conducting his friends thither, he had made a
complete circuit of the place, walking so far from the blazing
sticks that the reconnoissance was as complete as it could be
made. Failing to detect any sign of danger, he concluded that
there was none. The gun whose report they had noticed he believed
was fired by some white man who was lurking in the neighborhood,
in the hope of being able to protect his property, or, more probably,
with a view of securing something in the way of food, it might
be, for a party of fugitives in hiding at no great distance.</p>

<p>There were many instances of such flight and concealment during
the few days of, and succeeding, the massacre of Wyoming. Parties
of men and women, who had not been demented by the atrocities
that marked that dreadful era in the history of the settlement,
were, in some instances, wise enough to seek some good hiding-place
before exhausting themselves in the frantic efforts to flee.</p>

<p>By keeping a vigilant watch against the approach of their enemies,
and by studiously avoiding an exposure of themselves, except when
forced thereto, and by stealing out at night in quest of food,
they were able to emerge from the reign of terror far better than
hundreds of their neighbors did.</p>

<p>Lena-Wingo was positive that the gun which alarmed them was discharged
by a member of such a party, though what his precise reason was
for the conclusion was more than any of the three could comprehend
or suspect, and he did not make it clear to them. And so the supper
of roast pig was eaten in peace, and with an enjoyment that has
already been referred to. When it was finished, Jo said:</p>

<p>"Now, as there is no telling when we will be able to secure the
next meal&mdash;for we can't expect Colonel Butler to keep up his supply
of roast pig &mdash;I think we ought to take some of this with
us to provide for emergencies."</p>

<p>"Where shall we get it?" was the pertinent question of his sister.</p>

<p>"Why, take along what is left."</p>

<p>"Have you any left?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, I haven't any, but I suppose the others have."</p>

<p>"Take a look, and let us know how much there is!"</p>

<p>Jo took the look, as suggested, and the result was, as might
have been suspected, there was not so much as an ounce of meat
to be found. And yet, they had eaten every particle they wished,
so that a more well-ordered meal could not have been furnished.</p>

<p>"What is the use of taking thought for the morrow?" asked Rosa.
"Has not Lena-Wingo proved himself able to provide us with all
we want in the way of food?"</p>

<p>"There is no denying that, but I only wanted to assist him in
a simple matter; and if we are all to possess such appetites as
we have shown to-night, it may not be an easy matter, after all,
to keep up the quartermaster's supplies. However," he added, cheerfully,
"we won't borrow trouble after the great good fortune that has
followed us from the beginning."</p>

<p>They succeeded in making themselves comfortable in this respect,
though now and then the manner in which the Mohawk acted caused
a doubt to rise. Instead of sitting still, as did the others,
while he was eating, he frequently rose to his feet and went off
in the woods, the direction from which he reappeared showing that
he had been making another of his reconnoissances of their own
position. Rosa explained to her companions that such was his invariable
custom whenever he was in camp, and it was accepted as a way he
had of conducting his own business.</p>

<p>As the party had secured a meal, the next thing was to find the
canoe with which to cross the Susquehanna, a proceeding that had
been delayed so long that more than one of the little company
began to feel a superstitious fear that it might be they were
doomed to stay forever on this side. This was a duty which, as
a matter of course, belonged to the Mohawk, and, after his usual
admonition to his friends about keeping silent during his absence,
he went off again. As there was no telling how long the red scout
would be gone, it remained for the three friends to content themselves
as best they could until his return. This was a comparatively
easy matter, or would have been, but for the memory of that single
rifle shot heard but a short time before reaching this spot.</p>

<p>"I think the best thing we can do," said Ned Clinton, "is to
let this fire go out, or leave it altogether. We are too conspicuous
here, and, as the night is quite warm, we can stay in one part
as well as another."</p>

<p>"I would rather do it than not," replied Jo, "if we had only
asked Red Jack before he went away; but it seems to be always
an unlucky thing for us when we disregard his instructions."</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?" asked Ned, turning to Rosa, who, up
to this time, had held her peace.</p>

<p>"I suppose Lena-Wingo would not be likely to make any objection,
and if he did, I don't see why we should stay here and expose
ourselves to danger on his account."</p>

<p>"Very well, I agree to that&mdash;"</p>

<p>To the amazement of all, a second report, apparently of the same
gun, broke in upon their startled ears.</p>

<p>By a common instinct, they sprang to their feet, and started
off in the gloom, expecting to learn the cause of the strange
firing. The sound of some one hurrying rapidly over the leaves
was heard by all, and Ned Clinton whispered to the rest:</p>

<p>"Quick! Back, out of the way!"</p>

<p>While the words were still in his mouth, the three retreated
into the darkness of the woods beyond the light of the camp fire,
and paused, waiting, watching and listening. The rustling of the
leaves, which had alarmed them so much a short time before, was
heard no more, and the same oppressive, because suggestive, silence
held reign. Who had fired the gun? At whom was it pointed? Was
the marksman a white or red man? Were there more of the Iroquois
in the immediate vicinity, and were they stealing up to this camp
where the little party of fugitives had taken supper? Were the
friends being drawn into a skilfully laid ambush? Such were some
of the questions they asked themselves as they stood in the darkness
of the forest, waiting for the cause of all this apprehension
to come forth and show himself.</p>

<p>Suddenly the same soft rustling of the leaves was detected and
whoever was the cause thereof was plainly approaching the camp
fire. Then a form issued into view and paused. It was Lena-Wingo,
the Mohawk. His friends instantly gathered about him to learn
the success of his errand, and the explanation of the report of
the rifle.</p>

<p>"You hear gun?" asked the red scout.</p>

<p>"Of course we did," answered Ned, "and what did it mean?"</p>

<p>The old grin came back to the face of the Mohawk as he replied:
"That gun fired by white man. He aim at Lena-Wingo!" was the astounding
information he gave his companions.</p>
