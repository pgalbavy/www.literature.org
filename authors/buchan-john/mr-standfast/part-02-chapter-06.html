<p>He pointed to the slip on the table.</p>

<p>"You have seen the orders?"</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"The long day’s work is over. You must rejoice, for your part
has been the hardest, I think. Some day you will tell me about
it?"</p>

<p>The man’s face was honest and kindly, rather like that of the
engineer Gaudian, whom two years before I had met in Germany.
But his eyes fascinated me, for they were the eyes of the dreamer
and fanatic, who would not desist from his quest while life lasted.
I thought that Ivery had chosen well in his colleague.</p>

<p>"My task is not done yet," I said. "I came here to see Chelius."</p>

<p>"He will be back tomorrow evening."</p>

<p>"Too late. I must see him at once. He has gone to Italy, and
I must overtake him."</p>

<p>"You know your duty best," he said gravely.</p>

<p>"But you must help me. I must catch him at Santa Chiara, for
it is a business of life and death. Is there a car to be had?"</p>

<p>"There is mine. But there is no chauffeur. Chelius took him."</p>

<p>"I can drive myself and I know the road. But I have no pass to
cross the frontier."</p>

<p>"That is easily supplied," he said, smiling.</p>

<p>In one bookcase there was a shelf of dummy books. He unlocked
this and revealed a small cupboard, whence he took a tin dispatch-box.
From some papers he selected one, which seemed to be already signed.</p>

<p>"Name?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Call me Hans Gruber of Brieg," I said. "I travel to pick up
my master, who is in the timber trade."</p>

<p>"And your return?"</p>

<p>"I will come back by my old road," I said mysteriously; and if
he knew what I meant it was more than I did myself.</p>

<p>He completed the paper and handed it to me. "This will take you
through the frontier posts. And now for the car. The servants
will be in bed, for they have been preparing for a long journey,
but I will myself show it you. There is enough petrol on board
to take you to Rome."</p>

<p>He led me through the hall, unlocked the front door, and we crossed
the snowy lawn to the garage. The place was empty but for a great
car, which bore the marks of having come from the muddy lowlands.
To my joy I saw that it was a Daimler, a type with which I was
familiar. I lit the lamps, started the engine, and ran it out
on to the road.</p>

<p>"You will want an overcoat," he said.</p>

<p>"I never wear them."</p>

<p>"Food?"</p>

<p>"I have some chocolate. I will breakfast at Santa Chiara."</p>

<p>"Well, God go with you!"</p>

<p>A minute later I was tearing along the lake-side towards St Anton
village.</p>

<p>I stopped at the cottage on the hill. Peter was not yet in bed.
I found him sitting by the fire, trying to read, but I saw by
his face that he had been waiting anxiously on my coming.</p>

<p>"We’re in the soup, old man," I said as I shut the door. In a
dozen sentences I told him of the night’s doings, of Ivery’s plan
and my desperate errand.</p>

<p>"You wanted a share," I cried. "Well, everything depends on you
now. I’m off after Ivery, and God knows what will happen. Meantime,
you have got to get on to Blenkiron, and tell him what I’ve told
you. He must get the news through to <em>G.H.Q. </em>somehow.
He must trap the Wild Birds before they go. I don’t know how,
but he must. Tell him it’s all up to him and you, for I’m out
of it. I must save Mary, and if God’s willing I’ll settle with
Ivery. But the big job is for Blenkiron—and you. Somehow he has
made a bad break, and the enemy has got ahead of him. He must
sweat blood to make up. My God, Peter, it’s the solemnest moment
of our lives. I don’t see any light, but we mustn’t miss any chances.
I’m leaving it all to you."</p>

<p>I spoke like a man in a fever, for after what I had been through
I wasn’t quite sane. My coolness in the Pink Chalet had given
place to a crazy restlessness. I can see Peter yet, standing in
the ring of lamplight, supporting himself by a chair back, wrinkling
his brows and, as he always did in moments of excitement, scratching
gently the tip of his left ear. His face was happy.</p>

<p>"Never fear, Dick," he said. "It will all come right. <em>Ons
sal ’n plan maak.</em>"</p>

<p>And then, still possessed with a demon of disquiet, I was on
the road again, heading for the pass that led to Italy.</p>

<p>The mist had gone from the sky, and the stars were shining brightly.
The moon, now at the end of its first quarter, was setting in
a gap of the mountains, as I climbed the low col from the St Anton
valley to the greater Staubthal. There was frost and the hard
snow crackled under my wheels, but there was also that feel in
the air which preludes storm. I wondered if I should run into
snow in the high hills. The whole land was deep in peace. There
was not a light in the hamlets I passed through, not a soul on
the highway.</p>

<p>In the Staubthal I joined the main road and swung to the left
up the narrowing bed of the valley. The road was in noble condition,
and the car was running finely, as I mounted through forests of
snowy Pines to a land where the mountains crept close together,
and the highway coiled round the angles of great crags or skirted
perilously some profound gorge, with only a line of wooden posts
to defend it from the void. In places the snow stood in walls
on either side, where the road was kept open by man’s labour.
In other parts it lay thin, and in the dim light one might have
fancied that one was running through open meadowlands.</p>

<p>Slowly my head was getting clearer, and I was able to look round
my problem. I banished from my mind the situation I had left behind
me. Blenkiron must cope with that as best he could. It lay with
him to deal with the Wild Birds, my job was with Ivery alone.
Sometime in the early morning he would reach Santa Chiara, and
there he would find Mary. Beyond that my imagination could forecast
nothing. She would be alone—I could trust his cleverness for that;
he would try to force her to come with him, or he might persuade
her with some lying story. Well, please God, I should come in
for the tail end of the interview, and at the thought I cursed
the steep gradients I was climbing, and longed for some magic
to lift the Daimler beyond the summit and set it racing down the
slope towards Italy.</p>

<p>I think it was about half-past three when I saw the lights of
the frontier post. The air seemed milder than in the valleys,
and there was a soft scurry of snow on my right cheek. A couple
of sleepy Swiss sentries with their rifles in their hands stumbled
out as I drew up.</p>

<p>They took my pass into the hut and gave me an anxious quarter
of an hour while they examined it. The performance was repeated
fifty yards on at the Italian post, where to my alarm the sentries
were inclined to conversation. I played the part of the sulky
servant, answering in monosyllables and pretending to immense
stupidity.</p>

<p>"You are only just in time, friend," said one in German. "The
weather grows bad and soon the pass will close. Ugh, it is as
cold as last winter on the Tonale. You remember, Giuseppe?"</p>

<p>But in the end they let me move on. For a little I felt my way
gingerly, for on the summit the road had many twists and the snow
was confusing to the eyes. Presently came a sharp drop and I let
the Daimler go. It grew colder, and I shivered a little; the snow
became a wet white fog around the glowing arc of the headlights;
and always the road fell, now in long curves, now in steep short
dips, till I was aware of a glen opening towards the south. From
long living in the wilds I have a kind of sense for landscape
without the testimony of the eyes, and I knew where the ravine
narrowed or widened though it was black darkness.</p>

<p>In spite of my restlessness I had to go slowly, for after the
first rush downhill I realised that, unless I was careful, I might
wreck the car and spoil everything. The surface of the road on
the southern slope of the mountains was a thousand per cent worse
than that on the other. I skidded and side-slipped, and once grazed
the edge of the gorge. It was far more maddening than the climb
up, for then it had been a straight-forward grind with the Daimler
doing its utmost, whereas now I had to hold her back because of
my own lack of skill. I reckon that time crawling down from the
summit of the Staub as some of the weariest hours I ever spent.</p>

<p>Quite suddenly I ran out of the ill weather into a different
climate. The sky was clear above me, and I saw that dawn was very
near. The first pinewoods were beginning, and at last came a straight
slope where I could let the car out. I began to recover my spirits,
which had been very dashed, and to reckon the distance I had still
to travel.... And then, without warning, a new world sprang up
around me. Out of the blue dusk white shapes rose like ghosts,
peaks and needles and domes of ice, their bases fading mistily
into shadow, but the tops kindling till they glowed like jewels.
I had never seen such a sight, and the wonder of it for a moment
drove anxiety from my heart. More, it gave me an earnest of victory.
I was in clear air once more, and surely in this diamond ether
the foul things which loved the dark must be worsted....</p>

<p>And then I saw, a mile ahead, the little square red-roofed building
which I knew to be the inn of Santa Chiara.</p>

<p>It was here that misfortune met me. I had grown careless now,
and looked rather at the house than the road. At one point the
hillside had slipped down—it must have been recent, for the road
was well kept—and I did not notice the landslide till I was on
it. I slewed to the right, took too wide a curve, and before I
knew the car was over the far edge. I slapped on the brakes, but
to avoid turning turtle I had to leave the road altogether. I
slithered down a steep bank into a meadow, where for my sins I
ran into a fallen tree trunk with a jar that shook me out of my
seat and nearly broke my arm. Before I examined the car I knew
what had happened. The front axle was bent, and the off front
wheel badly buckled.</p>

<p>I had not time to curse my stupidity. I clambered back to the
road and set off running down it at my best speed. I was mortally
stiff, for Ivery’s rack was not good for the joints, but I realised
it only as a drag on my pace, not as an affliction in itself.
My whole mind was set on the house before me and what might be
happening there.</p>

<p>There was a man at the door of the inn, who, when he caught sight
of my figure, began to move to meet me. I saw that it was Launcelot
Wake, and the sight gave me hope.</p>

<p>But his face frightened me. It was drawn and haggard like one
who never sleeps, and his eyes were hot coals.</p>

<p>"Hannay," he cried, "for God’s sake what does it mean?"</p>

<p>"Where is Mary?" I gasped, and I remember I clutched at a lapel
of his coat.</p>

<p>He pulled me to the low stone wall by the roadside.</p>

<p>"I don’t know," he said hoarsely. "We got your orders to come
here this morning. We were at Chiavagno, where Blenkiron told
us to wait. But last night Mary disappeared.... I found she had
hired a carriage and come on ahead. I followed at once, and reached
here an hour ago to find her gone.... The woman who keeps the
place is away and there are only two old servants left. They tell
me that Mary came here late, and that very early in the morning
a closed car came over the Staub with a man in it. They say he
asked to see the young lady, and that they talked together for
some time, and that then she went off with him in the car down
the valley.... I must have passed it on my way up.... There’s
been some black devilment that I can’t follow. Who was the man?
Who was the man?"</p>

<p>He looked as if he wanted to throttle me.</p>

<p>"I can tell you that," I said. "It was Ivery."</p>

<p>He stared for a second as if he didn’t understand. Then he leaped
to his feet and cursed like a trooper. "You’ve botched it, as
I knew you would. I knew no good would come of your infernal subtleties."
And he consigned me and Blenkiron and the British army and Ivery
and everybody else to the devil.</p>

<p>I was past being angry. "Sit down, man," I said, "and listen
to me." I told him of what had happened at the Pink Chalet. He
heard me out with his head in his hands. The thing was too bad
for cursing.</p>

<p>"The Underground Railway!" he groaned. "The thought of it drives
me mad. Why are you so calm, Hannay? She’s in the hands of the
cleverest devil in the world, and you take it quietly. You should
be a raving lunatic."</p>

<p>"I would be if it were any use, but I did all my raving last
night in that den of Ivery’s. We’ve got to pull ourselves together,
Wake. First of all, I trust Mary to the other side of eternity.
She went with him of her own free will. I don’t know why, but
she must have had a reason, and be sure it was a good one, for
she’s far cleverer than you or me.... We’ve got to follow her
somehow. Ivery’s bound for Germany, but his route is by the Pink
Chalet, for he hopes to pick me up there. He went down the valley;
therefore he is going to Switzerland by the Marjolana. That is
a long circuit and will take him most of the day. Why he chose
that way I don’t know, but there it is. We’ve got to get back
by the Staub."</p>

<p>"How did you come?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That’s our damnable luck. I came in a first-class six-cylinder
Daimler, which is now lying a wreck in a meadow a mile up the
road. We’ve got to foot it."</p>

<p>"We can’t do it. It would take too long. Besides, there’s the
frontier to pass."</p>

<p>I remembered ruefully that I might have got a return passport
from the Portuguese Jew, if I had thought of anything at the time
beyond getting to Santa Chiara.</p>

<p>"Then we must make a circuit by the hillside and dodge the guards.
It’s no use making difficulties, Wake. We’re fairly up against
it, but we’ve got to go on trying till we drop. Otherwise I’ll
take your advice and go mad."</p>

<p>"And supposing you get back to St Anton, you’ll find the house
shut up and the travellers gone hours before by the Underground
Railway."</p>

<p>"Very likely. But, man, there’s always the glimmering of a chance.
It’s no good chucking in your hand till the game’s out."</p>

<p>"Drop your proverbial philosophy, Mr Martin Tupper, and look
up there."</p>

<p>He had one foot on the wall and was staring at a cleft in the
snow-line across the valley. The shoulder of a high peak dropped
sharply to a kind of nick and rose again in a long graceful curve
of snow. All below the nick was still in deep shadow, but from
the configuration of the slopes I judged that a tributary glacier
ran from it to the main glacier at the river head.</p>

<p>"That’s the Colle delle Rondini," he said, "the Col of the Swallows.
It leads straight to the Staubthal near Grünewald. On a good day
I have done it in seven hours, but it’s not a pass for winter-time.
It has been done of course, but not often.... Yet, if the weather
held, it might go even now, and that would bring us to St Anton
by the evening. I wonder"—and he looked me over with an appraising
eye—"I wonder if you’re up to it."</p>

<p>My stiffness had gone and I burned to set my restlessness to
physical toil.</p>

<p>"If you can do it, I can," I said.</p>

<p>"No. There you’re wrong. You’re a hefty fellow, but you’re no
mountaineer, and the ice of the Colle delle Rondini needs knowledge.
It would be insane to risk it with a novice, if there were any
other way. But I’m damned if I see any, and I’m going to chance
it. We can get a rope and axes in the inn. Are you game?"</p>

<p>"Right you are. Seven hours, you say. We’ve got to do it in six."</p>

<p>"You will be humbler when you get on the ice," he said grimly.
"We’d better breakfast, for the Lord knows when we shall see food
again."</p>

<p>We left the inn at five minutes to nine, with the sky cloudless
and a stiff wind from the north-west, which we felt even in the
deep-cut valley. Wake walked with a long, slow stride that tried
my patience. I wanted to hustle, but he bade me keep in step.
"You take your orders from me, for I’ve been at this job before.
Discipline in the ranks, remember."</p>

<p>We crossed the river gorge by a plank bridge, and worked our
way up the right bank, past the moraine, to the snout of the glacier.
It was bad going, for the snow concealed the boulders, and I often
floundered in holes. Wake never relaxed his stride, but now and
then he stopped to sniff the air.</p>

<p>I observed that the weather looked good, and he differed. "It’s
too clear. There’ll be a full-blown gale on the Col and most likely
snow in the afternoon." He pointed to a fat yellow cloud that
was beginning to bulge over the nearest peak. After that I thought
he lengthened his stride.</p>

<p>"Lucky I had these boots resoled and nailed at Chiavagno," was
the only other remark he made till we had passed the <em>seracs</em>
of the main glacier and turned up the lesser ice-stream from the
Colle delle Rondini.</p>

<p>By half-past ten we were near its head, and I could see clearly
the ribbon of pure ice between black crags too steep for snow
to lie on, which was the means of ascent to the Col. The sky had
clouded over, and ugly streamers floated on the high slopes. We
tied on the rope at the foot of the <em>bergschrund</em>, which
was easy to pass because of the winter’s snow. Wake led, of course,
and presently we came on to the icefall.</p>

<p>In my time I had done a lot of scrambling on rocks and used to
promise myself a season in the Alps to test myself on the big
peaks. If I ever go it will be to climb the honest rock towers
around Chamonix, for I won’t have anything to do with snow mountains.
That day on the Colle delle Rondini fairly sickened me of ice.
I daresay I might have liked it if I had done it in a holiday
mood, at leisure and in good spirits. But to crawl up that couloir
with a sick heart and a desperate impulse to hurry was the worst
sort of nightmare. The place was as steep as a wall of smooth
black ice that seemed hard as granite. Wake did the step-cutting,
and I admired him enormously. He did not seem to use much force,
but every step was hewn cleanly the right size, and they were
spaced the right distance. In this job he was the true professional.
I was thankful Blenkiron was not with us, for the thing would
have given a squirrel vertigo. The chips of ice slithered between
my legs and I could watch them till they brought up just above
the <em>bergschrund</em>.</p>

<p>The ice was in shadow and it was bitterly cold. As we crawled
up I had not the exercise of using the axe to warm me, and I got
very numb standing on one leg waiting for the next step. Worse
still, my legs began to cramp. I was in good condition, but that
time under Ivery’s rack had played the mischief with my limbs.
Muscles got out of place in my calves and stood in aching lumps,
till I almost squealed with the pain of it. I was mortally afraid
I should slip, and every time I moved I called out to Wake to
warn him. He saw what was happening and got the pick of his axe
fixed in the ice before I was allowed to stir. He spoke often
to cheer me up, and his voice had none of its harshness. He was
like some ill-tempered generals I have known, very gentle in a
battle.</p>

<p>At the end the snow began to fall, a soft powder like the overspill
of a storm raging beyond the crest. It was just after that that
Wake cried out that in five minutes we would be at the summit.
He consulted his wrist-watch. "Jolly good time, too. Only twenty-five
minutes behind my best. It’s not one o’clock."</p>

<p>The next I knew I was lying flat on a pad of snow easing my cramped
legs, while Wake shouted in my ear that we were in for something
bad. I was aware of a driving blizzard, but I had no thought of
anything but the blessed relief from pain. I lay for some minutes
on my back with my legs stiff in the air and the toes turned inwards,
while my muscles fell into their proper place.</p>

<p>It was certainly no spot to linger in. We looked down into a
trough of driving mist, which sometimes swirled aside and showed
a knuckle of black rock far below. We ate some chocolate, while
Wake shouted in my ear that now we had less step-cutting. He did
his best to cheer me, but he could not hide his anxiety. Our faces
were frosted over like a wedding-cake and the sting of the wind
was like a whiplash on our eyelids.</p>

<p>The first part was easy, down a slope of firm snow where steps
were not needed. Then came ice again, and we had to cut into it
below the fresh surface snow. This was so laborious that Wake
took to the rocks on the right side of the couloir, where there
was some shelter from the main force of the blast. I found it
easier, for I knew something about rocks, but it was difficult
enough with every handhold and foothold glazed. Presently we were
driven back again to the ice, and painfully cut our way through
a throat of the ravine where the sides narrowed. There the wind
was terrible, for the narrows made a kind of funnel, and we descended,
plastered against the wall, and scarcely able to breathe, while
the tornado plucked at our bodies as if it would whisk us like
wisps of grass into the abyss.</p>

<p>After that the gorge widened and we had an easier slope, till
suddenly we found ourselves perched on a great tongue of rock
round which the snow blew like the froth in a whirlpool. As we
stopped for breath, Wake shouted in my ear that this was the Black
Stone.</p>

<p>"The what?" I yelled.</p>

<p>"The Schwarzstein. The Swiss call the pass the Schwarzsteinthor.
You can see it from Grünewald."</p>

<p>I suppose every man has a tinge of superstition in him. To hear
that name in that ferocious place gave me a sudden access of confidence.
I seemed to see all my doings as part of a great predestined plan.
Surely it was not for nothing that the word which had been the
key of my first adventure in the long tussle should appear in
this last phase. I felt new strength in my legs and more vigour
in my lungs. "A good omen," I shouted. "Wake, old man, we’re going
to win out."</p>

<p>"The worst is still to come," he said.</p>

<p>He was right. To get down that tongue of rock to the lower snows
of the couloir was a job that fairly brought us to the end of
our tether. I can feel yet the sour, bleak smell of wet rock and
ice and the hard nerve pain that racked my forehead. The Kaffirs
used to say that there were devils in the high berg, and this
place was assuredly given over to the powers of the air who had
no thought of human life. I seemed to be in the world which had
endured from the eternity before man was dreamed of. There was
no mercy in it, and the elements were pitting their immortal strength
against two pigmies who had profaned their sanctuary. I yearned
for warmth, for the glow of a fire, for a tree or blade of grass
or anything which meant the sheltered homeliness of mortality.
I knew then what the Greeks meant by panic, for I was scared by
the apathy of nature. But the terror gave me a kind of comfort,
too. Ivery and his doings seemed less formidable. Let me but get
out of this cold hell and I could meet him with a new confidence.</p>

<p>Wake led, for he knew the road and the road wanted knowing. Otherwise
he should have been last on the rope, for that is the place of
the better man in a descent. I had some horrible moments following
on when the rope grew taut, for I had no help from it. We zigzagged
down the rock, sometimes driven to the ice of the adjacent couloirs,
sometimes on the outer ridge of the Black Stone, sometimes wriggling
down little cracks and over evil boiler-plates. The snow did not
lie on it, but the rock crackled with thin ice or oozed ice water.
Often it was only by the grace of God that I did not fall headlong,
and pull Wake out of his hold to the <em>bergschrund</em> far
below. I slipped more than once, but always by a miracle recovered
myself. To make things worse, Wake was tiring. I could feel him
drag on the rope, and his movements had not the precision they
had had in the morning. He was the mountaineer, and I the novice.
If he gave out, we should never reach the valley.</p>

<p>The fellow was clear grit all through. When we reached the foot
of the tooth and sat huddled up with our faces away from the wind,
I saw that he was on the edge of fainting. What that effort must
have cost him in the way of resolution you may guess, but he did
not fail till the worst was past. His lips were colourless, and
he was choking with the nausea of fatigue. I found a flask of
brandy in his pocket, and a mouthful revived him.</p>

<p>"I’m all out," he said. "The road’s easier now, and I can direct
you about the rest.... You’d better leave me. I’ll only be a drag.
I’ll come on when I feel better."</p>

<p>"No, you don’t, you old fool. You’ve got me over that infernal
iceberg, and I’m going to see you home."</p>

<p>I rubbed his arms and legs and made him swallow some chocolate.
But when he got on his feet he was as doddery as an old man. Happily
we had an easy course down a snow gradient, which we glissaded
in very unorthodox style. The swift motion freshened him up a
little, and he was able to put on the brake with his axe to prevent
us cascading into the <em>bergschrund</em>. We crossed it by a
snow bridge, and started out on the <em>seracs</em> of the Schwarzstein
glacier.</p>

<p>I am no mountaineer—not of the snow and ice kind, anyway—but
I have a big share of physical strength and I wanted it all now.
For those <em>seracs</em> were an invention of the devil. To traverse
that labyrinth in a blinding snowstorm, with a fainting companion
who was too weak to jump the narrowest crevasse, and who hung
on the rope like lead when there was occasion to use it, was more
than I could manage. Besides, every step that brought us nearer
to the valley now increased my eagerness to hurry, and wandering
in that maze of clotted ice was like the nightmare when you stand
on the rails with the express coming and are too weak to climb
on the platform. As soon as possible I left the glacier for the
hillside, and though that was laborious enough in all conscience,
yet it enabled me to steer a straight course. Wake never spoke
a word. When I looked at him his face was ashen under a gale which
should have made his cheeks glow, and he kept his eyes half closed.
He was staggering on at the very limits of his endurance....</p>

<p>By and by we were on the moraine, and after splashing through
a dozen little glacier streams came on a track which led up the
hillside. Wake nodded feebly when I asked if this was right. Then
to my joy I saw a gnarled pine.</p>

<p>I untied the rope and Wake dropped like a log on the ground.
"Leave me," he groaned. "I’m fairly done. I’ll come on later."
And he shut his eyes.</p>

<p>My watch told me that it was after five o’clock.</p>

<p>"Get on my back," I said. "I won’t part from you till I’ve found
a cottage. You’re a hero. You’ve brought me over those damned
mountains in a blizzard, and that’s what no other man in England
would have done. Get up."</p>

<p>He obeyed, for he was too far gone to argue. I tied his wrists
together with a handkerchief below my chin, for I wanted my arms
to hold up his legs. The rope and axes I left in a cache beneath
the pine-tree. Then I started trotting down the track for the
nearest dwelling.</p>

<p>My strength felt inexhaustible and the quicksilver in my bones
drove me forward. The snow was still falling, but the wind was
dying down, and after the inferno of the pass it was like summer.
The road wound over the shale of the hillside and then into what
in spring must have been upland meadows. Then it ran among trees,
and far below me on the right I could hear the glacier river churning
in its gorge. Soon little empty huts appeared, and rough enclosed
paddocks, and presently I came out on a shelf above the stream
and smelt the wood-smoke of a human habitation.</p>

<p>I found a middle-aged peasant in the cottage, a guide by profession
in summer and a woodcutter in winter.</p>

<p>"I have brought my Herr from Santa Chiara," I said, "over the
Schwarzsteinthor. He is very weary and must sleep."</p>

<p>I decanted Wake into a chair, and his head nodded on his chest.
But his colour was better.</p>

<p>"You and your Herr are fools," said the man gruffly, but not
unkindly. "He must sleep or he will have a fever. The Schwarzsteinthor
in this devil’s weather! Is he English?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "like all madmen. But he’s a good Herr, and a
brave mountaineer."</p>

<p>We stripped Wake of his Red Cross uniform, now a collection of
sopping rags, and got him between blankets with a huge earthenware
bottle of hot water at his feet. The woodcutter’s wife boiled
milk, and this, with a little brandy added, we made him drink.
I was quite easy in my mind about him, for I had seen this condition
before. In the morning he would be as stiff as a poker, but recovered.</p>

<p>"Now I’m off for St Anton," I said. "I must get there tonight."</p>

<p>"You are the hardy one," the man laughed. "I will show you the
quick road to Grünewald, where is the railway. With good fortune
you may get the last train."</p>

<p>I gave him fifty francs on my Herr’s behalf, learned his directions
for the road, and set off after a draught of goat’s milk, munching
my last slab of chocolate. I was still strung up to a mechanical
activity, and I ran every inch of the three miles to the Staubthal
without consciousness of fatigue. I was twenty minutes too soon
for the train, and, as I sat on a bench on the platform, my energy
suddenly ebbed away. That is what happens after a great exertion.
I longed to sleep, and when the train arrived I crawled into a
carriage like a man with a stroke. There seemed to be no force
left in my limbs. I realised that I was leg-weary, which is a
thing you see sometimes with horses, but not often with men.</p>

<p>All the journey I lay like a log in a kind of coma, and it was
with difficulty that I recognised my destination, and stumbled
out of the train. But I had no sooner emerged from the station
of St Anton than I got my second wind. Much snow had fallen since
yesterday, but it had stopped now, the sky was clear, and the
moon was riding. The sight of the familiar place brought back
all my anxieties. The day on the Col of the Swallows was wiped
out of my memory, and I saw only the inn at Santa Chiara, and
heard Wake’s hoarse voice speaking of Mary. The lights were twinkling
from the village below, and on the right I saw the clump of trees
which held the Pink Chalet.</p>

<p>I took a short cut across the fields, avoiding the little town.
I ran hard, stumbling often, for though I had got my mental energy
back my legs were still precarious. The station clock had told
me that it was nearly half-past nine.</p>

<p>Soon I was on the high-road, and then at the Chalet gates. I
heard as in a dream what seemed to be three shrill blasts on a
whistle. Then a big car passed me, making for St Anton. For a
second I would have hailed it, but it was past me and away. But
I had a conviction that my business lay in the house, for I thought
Ivery was there, and Ivery was what mattered.</p>

<p>I marched up the drive with no sort of plan in my head, only
a blind rushing on fate. I remembered dimly that I had still three
cartridges in my revolver.</p>

<p>The front door stood open and I entered and tiptoed down the
passage to the room where I had found the Portuguese Jew. No one
hindered me, but it was not for lack of servants. I had the impression
that there were people near me in the darkness, and I thought
I heard German softly spoken. There was someone ahead of me, perhaps
the speaker, for I could hear careful footsteps. It was very dark,
but a ray of light came from below the door of the room. Then
behind me I heard the hall door clang, and the noise of a key
turned in its lock. I had walked straight into a trap and all
retreat was cut off.</p>

<p>My mind was beginning to work more clearly, though my purpose
was still vague. I wanted to get at Ivery and I believed that
he was somewhere in front of me. And then I thought of the door
which led from the chamber where I had been imprisoned. If I could
enter that way I would have the advantage of surprise.</p>

<p>I groped on the right-hand side of the passage and found a handle.
It opened upon what seemed to be a dining-room, for there was
a faint smell of food. Again I had the impression of people near,
who for some unknown reason did not molest me. At the far end
I found another door, which led to a second room, which I guessed
to be adjacent to the library. Beyond it again must lie the passage
from the chamber with the rack. The whole place was as quiet as
a shell.</p>

<p>I had guessed right. I was standing in the passage where I had
stood the night before. In front of me was the library, and there
was the same chink of light showing. Very softly I turned the
handle and opened it a crack....</p>

<p>The first thing that caught my eye was the profile of Ivery.
He was looking towards the writing-table, where someone was sitting.</p>
