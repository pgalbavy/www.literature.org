<p>By this time night was closing over forest and river. The sun
had set, and a strong west wind blew steadily up stream. Masses
of clouds were drifting across the sky, and when the moon should
appear its light would be treacherous and uncertain.</p>

<p>"We must wait no longer," said Hastings, "for we shall run the
risk of an attack where we are, and that would be almost as bad
as an ambush."</p>

<p>"True," remarked Altman, with a shudder, as he glanced around
them, "we are without any protection at all in this open ground.
We must hit upon a better place than this in which to make our
halt."</p>

<p>The leader nodded toward two of his men, who advanced to where
the sleeping Jim lay on the ground, as helpless and inanimate
as a log. Each taking him by a shoulder lifted him to his feet.
Then they let go, and he dropped like a bundle of rags.</p>

<p>He was yanked up again, shaken, slapped, and vigorously told
to stand up.</p>

<p>"I'm all right," mumbled Jim, "fetch on (hic) your rattler; let
'em bite&mdash;who cares? Whiskey'll cure him&mdash;fetch on your whiskey."</p>

<p>After some more heroic treatment, the man was finally roused
to that degree that he was able to wobble forward, partly supported
by his two friends, one of whom took charge of his gun.</p>

<p>"If I had known nothing was the matter with him," said the disgusted
Mr. Altman, "he wouldn't have gotten a drop from me. The only
man who can give us the information we need might just as well
be dead."</p>

<p>The company advanced much in the same fashion as earlier in the
day, except that still greater precaution was observed. The females
were kept near the centre and the husbands close to them, so that
there was a rude resemblance to a hollow square.</p>

<p>Hastings took the lead, as he always did in the absence of Kenton
and Boone, and had not gone far when he became aware that he was
following a well-marked path. A companion on his right and another
on his left had noted something of the kind some minutes before.
The three paths, not to mention others, converged and became one
a little further on.</p>

<p>These, as had been intimated, were the trails made by wild animals
on their way to the salt lick lying some distance on the other
side of Rattlesnake Gulch. The pioneers were now quite close to
that ill-omened spot, and the burden of the expedition rested
wholly upon the shoulders of Weber Hastings, who maintained a
position never less than fifty feet in advance of his nearest
companion.</p>

<p>Hastings caught a faint, momentary rustling directly in front
of him. He instantly stopped and listened. It sounded the next
moment further to the right. He knew it made by one of the Shawanoes,
who, with all their skill, could not advance in perfect silence
amid such gloom any more than could the white man.</p>

<p>Suddenly he detected a different sound. It was as if something
was gliding over the leaves, and was accompanied by a delicate
whirring noise, which Hastings recognized on the instant, for
many a time and oft he had heard it before.</p>

<p>Those of our readers who have caught the warning of the rattlesnake
can make no mistake when they hear it a second time.</p>

<p>Another of those baleful reptiles was gliding across the path
of the pioneers, as if to apprise them of the appropriateness
of the name of the gulch, which was now near at hand.</p>

<p>The greatest annoying hindrance in this stealthy groping among
the trees was the condition of Jim Deane, who had taken a prodigious
over-dose of the universal remedy for the rattlesnake's venom.
When in his sober senses, he was one of the bravest and most skilful
scouts in the west, and was held in special high esteem by Capt.
Bushwick, for whom he had performed arduous and perilous service.</p>

<p>But, naturally enough, he was now another person, the opposite
of himself. In order to leave their escort free to attend to their
delicate task, George Ashbridge and his father took charge of
Jim, and, in assuming the contract, they found it was all they
could do to "deliver the goods."</p>

<p>Deane rallied after several stumbles, and managed to walk with
less help from the father and son, though he swayed from side
to side and leaned heavily upon both. He continued muttering and
talking, partly to himself and partly to those who were aiding
him in locomotion.</p>

<p>"Going to the gulch&mdash;all right," he mumbled, when they were quite
near their destination, "want to go into the fort; that's the
place for you folks."</p>

<p>The scout stopped as suddenly as if he had run against the trunk
of a tree. Despite his broken utterance, a vague sense of his
situation was gradually forcing itself upon him.</p>

<p>He realized, in a dim but increasingly distinct way, the necessity
of throwing off the spell which muddled his brain. As he repeated
and renewed the effort, he gained more strength.</p>

<p>Holding himself somewhat unsteadily, he looked around in the
gloom at his elder escort, and demanded:</p>

<p>"Where going?"</p>

<p>"We are trying to reach the block-house, but it's a long way
off. We are now close to Rattlesnake Gulch."</p>

<p>"That's all right," repeated Deane, wobbling forward again; "going
to the fort&mdash;our fort."</p>

<p>Jim Deane stopped abruptly as before, and blinked and started
in the vain effort to penetrate the gloom in which all were enveloped.
His companions noted that he was now able to maintain the erect
position without any help from them.</p>

<p>"Can't you get a candle?" he asked, his brain still muddled,
"too dark to see; get candle, and I'll show you the fort."</p>

<p>The company was now so near Rattlesnake Gulch that Weber Hastings,
the guide, decided it would not do to approach any closer. They
must await the coming of Kenton before doing anything further.</p>

<p>Gradually, or with less difficulty than would be suspected, the
ranger brought all his men together, or they gathered around the
families whom they had set out to escort to the block-house. Although
they could hardly see each other's forms in the darkness, a few
minutes sufficed to prove none were missing. All were there, but,
ah! for how long should this be said of them? "We are so near
Rattlesnake Gulch," explained Hastings, "that if we go a hundred
yards further, we'll walk straight into the ambush the varmints
have set for us."</p>

<p>"What is to be done?" asked Mr. Altman, in a guarded undertone.</p>

<p>"We'll move a little further down the slope to the edge of the
river, and wait for Kenton or Boone; one of them will be here
purty soon."</p>

<p>Mr. Ashbridge now made known what Jim Deane had declared in his
broken way. Before he could be questioned, the fellow, who was
still nearer sobriety, said:</p>

<p>"Boys, you think I don't know what I'm saying; I'm not as sober
as I oughter be, but I give it to you straight; you've made a
big mistake, and I'll prove it to you."</p>
