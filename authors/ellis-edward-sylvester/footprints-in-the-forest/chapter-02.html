<p>"But who were the Indians?" asked Jack Carleton.</p>

<p>Deerfoot shook his head, smiled in his faint, shadowy way and
pointed to the west.</p>

<p>"They came from the land of the setting sun; Hay-uta knows not
their totem; he never saw any of their tribe before and knows
not whither they went."</p>

<p>"I should, think that even an Indian would have enough curiosity
to ask some questions."</p>

<p>"He <em>did</em> ask the questions," replied Deerfoot, "but the
strange warriors did not give him answer."</p>

<p>"Then all that we know is that Otto was turned over to four red
men who went westward with him."</p>

<p>Deerfoot nodded his head to signify that such was the fact, and
then he continued his conversation with Hay-uta.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton recalled that when he and Deerfoot were guessing
the fate of Otto, the suggestion was made that probably such had
been the experience of the poor fellow. He had been bartered to
a party of red men, who had gone westward with him, and beyond
that important fact nothing whatever was known.</p>

<p>My reader will remember also that I spoke in "Campfire and Wigwam,"
of the strange Indians who were sometimes met by the hunters and
trappers, and well as by the red men themselves. They were dusky
explorers, as they may be termed, who like Columbus of the olden
time, had the daring to pass beyond the boundaries of their own
land, and grope through strange countries they had never seen.</p>

<p>The four warriors had come from some point to the west, and Hay-uta
said they could not speak a word which the Sauks understood, nor
could the Sauks utter any thing that was clear to them. But the
sign-language never fails, and had the strangers chosen, they
could have given a great deal of information to the Sauks.</p>

<p>A little reflection will show how limitless was the field of
speculation that was opened by this news. Beyond the bare fact,
as I have said, that the custodians of Otto Relstaub came from
and went toward the west, little, if any thing, was known. Their
hunting grounds may have been not far away on the confines of
the present state of Kansas or the Indian Nation, or traversing
those hundreds of miles of territory, they may have built their
tepees around the headwaters of the Arkansas, in Colorado (as
now called), New Mexico or the Llano Estacado of Texas. It was
not to be supposed that they had come from any point beyond, since
that would have required the passage of the Rocky Mountains&mdash;a
feat doubtless often performed by red men, before the American
Pathfinder led his little band across that formidable barrier,
but the theory that Otto's new masters traveled from beyond, was
too unreasonable to be accepted.</p>

<p>Yet from the little camp where the three persons were lounging,
it was more than half a thousand miles to the Rocky Mountains,
while the territory stretched far to the north and south, so that
an army might lose itself beyond recovery in the vast wilderness.</p>

<p>The task, therefore, which faced them at the beginning was to
learn whither the four warriors had gone with the hapless Otto.</p>

<p>It need not be said that none understood this necessity better
than Deerfoot himself. Consequently he drew from Hay-uta, the
Sauk, every particle of knowledge which he possessed; that, however,
amounted to little more than has already been told. But that which
the Shawanoe sought was a full account of their dress, their looks,
arms and accouterments&mdash;such an account being more important to
the young warrior than would be supposed.</p>

<p>The information he gained may be summed up: the strangers were
taller, more powerful and better formed than Sauks. Each carried
a rifle, tomahawk and knife as his weapons; they had blankets,
and their clothing, while nearly the same as that of the Sauks,
was of a darker and more sober color. They had no beads or ornaments;
their leggings, moccasins, and the fringe of their hunting shirts,
were less gaudy in color than those of the other party. Their
moccasins were well worn, from which it was fair to infer they
had traveled a long distance.</p>

<p>Hay-uta stated another fact which should be known: when the two
parties discovered each other, the strangers showed a desire to
engage in a fight, not that there was any special cause for so
doing, but as may be said, on general principles. Though the Sauks
were five to their four, they were afraid of the strangers, and
they opened the negotiations for the transfer of Otto, with a
view of diverting hostile intentions. The Sauks had the reputation
of being brave and warlike, but they did not feel safe until many
miles of trackless woods lay between them and the strangers.</p>

<p>So much, therefore, was known, and surely it was little enough.
Hay-uta added the remark that as nearly as he could tell, Deerfoot
and Jack were close to the very path which the strangers had taken
on their way home. It might be they were on the trail itself,
if such a thing be deemed possible, where no footprints in the
forest existed, for since the passage of the four dusky aliens
and their prisoner, the wilderness had been swept by storms which
had not left the slightest trace on the leaves that could be followed,
and, though our friends might be stepping in their very tracks,
it was hardly possible that the lynx eyes of the young warrior
could detect it.</p>

<p>When Deerfoot and Hay-uta had talked awhile longer, the former
turned to Jack and amazed him by the remark:</p>

<p>"Hay-uta will go with us to give what help he can to find our
brother who is lost."</p>

<p>The news was as pleasant as it was surprising. It did seem singular
that the one who had helped take Otto Relstaub prisoner, and then
sold him to strangers, should now offer to do what he could to
bring back the lad to his friends. He could not fail to be a valuable
ally, for, though vanquished by Deerfoot, he ranked among the
best warriors of his people.</p>

<p>"I wonder what led him to volunteer?" said Jack.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot asked him, and he was kind enough to do so."</p>

<p>"That's because you overcame him."</p>

<p>The young Shawanoe had given a short account of his extraordinary
meeting with Hay-uta, when the older warrior tried to take his
life, but Jack knew nothing more than the main incident. He had
not been told of the aboriginal sermon which Deerfoot delivered
on that "auspicious occasion".</p>

<p>It was only natural that the Sauk should feel a strong admiration
for the remarkable youth, but the Word which Deerfoot expounded
to him had far more to do with his seeking the companionship of
the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>The latter made no answer to the remark of Jack, but turning
toward Hay-uta continued the conversation which had been broken
several times. Young Carleton, believing there was nothing for
him to do, spread his blanket near the fire, and, lying down,
so as to infold himself from head to feet, was not long in sinking
into slumber.</p>

<p>Ordinarily his rest would not have been broken, for his confidence
in Deerfoot was so strong, that he felt fully as safe as if lying
at home in his own bed, but, from some slight cause, he gradually
regained his senses, until he recalled where he was. He was lying
with his back to the blaze, but the reflection on the leaves in
front, showed the fire was burning briskly. He heard too, the
low murmur of a voice, which he knew belonged to Deerfoot.</p>

<p>"What mischief can be going on?" he asked himself, silently turning
his head, so that he could look across to his friend.</p>

<p>The scene was one which could never be forgotten. Deerfoot was
lying or rather reclining on one side, the upper part of his body
resting on his elbow, so that his shoulders and head were several
inches above the ground. In the hand of the arm which thus supported
him, was held his little Bible, the light from the camp-fire falling
on the page, from which he was reading in his low, musical voice
that is he was translating the English into the Sauk tongue, seeking
to put the words in such shape that the listener could understand
them. It would be hard to imagine a more difficult task.</p>

<p>Between Deerfoot and Jack was stretched the Sauk, his posture
such that his features were in sight. He lay on his face, his
arms half folded under his chest, so that his shoulders were also
held clear of the ground. His dark eyes were fixed upon the countenance
of the Shawanoe youth, with a rapt expression that made him unconscious
of every thing else. Into that heart was penetrating the partial
light of a mystery which mortal man has never fully solved; he
was learning the great lesson beside which all others sink into
insignificance.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton moved as softly as he could, so as to view the
picture without bodily discomfort. Deerfoot glanced at him, without
checking himself, but Hay-uta heard him not. Watchful and vigilant
as he was, an enemy might have stolen forward and driven his tomahawk
through his brain, without any thought on his part of his peril.</p>

<p>"I wish I could understand what Deerfoot is saying," was the
thought of Jack, whose eyes filled at the touching sight.</p>

<p>"A full-blooded Indian is urging the Christian religion on another
Indian. Even I, who have a praying mother, have been reproved
by him, and with good cause too."</p>

<p>By and by the senses of the young Kentuckian left him, and again
he slept. This time he did not open his eyes until broad daylight.</p>
