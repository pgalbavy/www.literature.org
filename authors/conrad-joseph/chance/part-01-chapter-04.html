<p>And the best of it was that the danger was all over already. 
There was no danger any more.  The supposed nephew's appearance
had a purpose.  He had come, full, full to trembling&mdash;with the
bigness of his news.  There must have been rumours already as
to the shaky position of the de Barral's concerns; but only amongst
those in the very inmost know.  No rumour or echo of rumour had
reached the profane in the West-End&mdash;let alone in the guileless
marine suburb of Hove.  The Fynes had no suspicion; the governess,
playing with cold, distinguished exclusiveness the part of mother
to the fabulously wealthy Miss de Barral, had no suspicion; the
masters of music, of drawing, of dancing to Miss de Barral, had
no idea; the minds of her medical man, of her dentist, of the
servants in the house, of the tradesmen proud of having the name
of de Barral on their books, were in a state of absolute serenity. 
Thus, that fellow, who had unexpectedly received a most alarming
straight tip from somebody in the City arrived in Brighton, at
about lunch-time, with something very much in the nature of a
deadly bomb in his possession.  But he knew better than to throw
it on the public pavement.  He ate his lunch impenetrably, sitting
opposite Flora de Barral, and then, on some excuse, closeted himself
with the woman whom little Fyne's charity described (with a slight
hesitation of speech however) as his "Aunt."</p>

<p>What they said to each other in private we can imagine.  She
came out of her own sitting-room with red spots on her cheek-bones,
which having provoked a question from her "beloved" charge, were
accounted for by a curt "I have a headache coming on."  But we
may be certain that the talk being over she must have said to
that young blackguard: "You had better take her out for a ride
as usual."  We have proof positive of this in Fyne and Mrs. Fyne
observing them mount at the door and pass under the windows of
their sitting-room, talking together, and the poor girl all smiles;
because she enjoyed in all innocence the company of Charley. 
She made no secret of it whatever to Mrs. Fyne; in fact, she had
confided to her, long before, that she liked him very much: a
confidence which had filled Mrs. Fyne with desolation and that
sense of powerless anguish which is experienced in certain kinds
of nightmare.  For how could she warn the girl?  She did venture
to tell her once that she didn't like Mr. Charley.  Miss de Barral
heard her with astonishment.  How was it possible not to like
Charley?  Afterwards with naive loyalty she told Mrs. Fyne that,
immensely as she was fond of her she could not hear a word against
Charley&mdash;the wonderful Charley.</p>

<p>The daughter of de Barral probably enjoyed her jolly ride with
the jolly Charley (infinitely more jolly than going out with a
stupid old ridingmaster), very much indeed, because the Fynes
saw them coming back at a later hour than usual.  In fact it was
getting nearly dark.  On dismounting, helped off by the delightful
Charley, she patted the neck of her horse and went up the steps. 
Her last ride.  She was then within a few days of her sixteenth
birthday, a slight figure in a riding habit, rather shorter than
the average height for her age, in a black bowler hat from under
which her fine rippling dark hair cut square at the ends was hanging
well down her back.  The delightful Charley mounted again to take
the two horses round to the mews.  Mrs. Fyne remaining at the
window saw the house door close on Miss de Barral returning from
her last ride.</p>

<p>And meantime what had the governess (out of a nobleman's family)
so judiciously selected (a lady, and connected with well-known
county people as she said) to direct the studies, guard the health,
form the mind, polish the manners, and generally play the perfect
mother to that luckless child&mdash;what had she been doing?  Well,
having got rid of her charge by the most natural device possible,
which proved her practical sense, she started packing her belongings,
an act which showed her clear view of the situation.  She had
worked methodically, rapidly, and well, emptying the drawers,
clearing the tables in her special apartment of that big house,
with something silently passionate in her thoroughness; taking
everything belonging to her and some things of less unquestionable
ownership, a jewelled penholder, an ivory and gold paper knife
(the house was full of common, costly objects), some chased silver
boxes presented by de Barral and other trifles; but the photograph
of Flora de Barral, with the loving inscription, which stood on
her writing desk, of the most modern and expensive style, in a
silver-gilt frame, she neglected to take.  Having accidentally,
in the course of the operations, knocked it off on the floor she
let it lie there after a downward glance.  Thus it, or the frame
at least, became, I suppose, part of the assets in the de Barral
bankruptcy.</p>

<p>At dinner that evening the child found her company dull and brusque. 
It was uncommonly slow.  She could get nothing from her governess
but monosyllables, and the jolly Charley actually snubbed the
various cheery openings of his "little chum"&mdash;as he used to call
her at times,&mdash;but not at that time.  No doubt the couple were
nervous and preoccupied.  For all this we have evidence, and for
the fact that Flora being offended with the delightful nephew
of her profoundly respected governess sulked through the rest
of the evening and was glad to retire early.  Mrs., Mrs. &mdash;I've
really forgotten her name&mdash;the governess, invited her nephew to
her sitting-room, mentioning aloud that it was to talk over some
family matters.  This was meant for Flora to hear, and she heard
it&mdash;without the slightest interest.  In fact there was nothing
sufficiently unusual in such an invitation to arouse in her mind
even a passing wonder.  She went bored to bed and being tired
with her long ride slept soundly all night.  Her last sleep, I
won't say of innocence&mdash;that word would not render my exact meaning,
because it has a special meaning of its own&mdash;but I will say: of
that ignorance, or better still, of that unconsciousness of the
world's ways, the unconsciousness of danger, of pain, of humiliation,
of bitterness, of falsehood.  An unconsciousness which in the
case of other beings like herself is removed by a gradual process
of experience and information, often only partial at that, with
saving reserves, softening doubts, veiling theories.  Her unconsciousness
of the evil which lives in the secret thoughts and therefore in
the open acts of mankind, whenever it happens that evil thought
meets evil courage; her unconsciousness was to be broken into
with profane violence with desecrating circumstances, like a temple
violated by a mad, vengeful impiety.  Yes, that very young girl,
almost no more than a child&mdash;this was what was going to happen
to her.  And if you ask me, how, wherefore, for what reason? 
I will answer you: Why, by chance!  By the merest chance, as things
do happen, lucky and unlucky, terrible or tender, important or
unimportant; and even things which are neither, things so completely
neutral in character that you would wonder why they do happen
at all if you didn't know that they, too, carry in their insignificance
the seeds of further incalculable chances.</p>

<p>Of course, all the chances were that de Barral should have fallen
upon a perfectly harmless, naive, usual, inefficient specimen
of respectable governess for his daughter; or on a commonplace
silly adventuress who would have tried, say, to marry him or work
some other sort of common mischief in a small way.  Or again he
might have chanced on a model of all the virtues, or the repository
of all knowledge, or anything equally harmless, conventional,
and middle class.  All calculations were in his favour; but, chance
being incalculable, he fell upon an individuality whom it is much
easier to define by opprobrious names than to classify in a calm
and scientific spirit&mdash;but an individuality certainly, and a temperament
as well.  Rare?   No.  There is a certain amount of what I would
politely call unscrupulousness in all of us.  Think for instance
of the excellent Mrs. Fyne, who herself, and in the bosom of her
family, resembled a governess of a conventional type.  Only, her
mental excesses were theoretical, hedged in by so much humane
feeling and conventional reserves, that they amounted to no more
than mere libertinage of thought; whereas the other woman, the
governess of Flora de Barral, was, as you may have noticed, severely
practical&mdash;terribly practical.  No!  Hers was not a rare temperament,
except in its fierce resentment of repression; a feeling which
like genius or lunacy is apt to drive people into sudden irrelevancy. 
Hers was feminine irrelevancy.  A male genius, a male ruffian,
or even a male lunatic, would not have behaved exactly as she
did behave.  There is a softness in masculine nature, even the
most brutal, which acts as a check.</p>

<p>While the girl slept those two, the woman of forty, an age in
itself terrible, and that hopeless young "wrong 'un" of twenty-three
(also well connected I believe) had some sort of subdued row in
the cleared rooms: wardrobes open, drawers half pulled out and
empty, trunks locked and strapped, furniture in idle disarray,
and not so much as a single scrap of paper left behind on the
tables.  The maid, whom the governess and the pupil shared between
them, after finishing with Flora, came to the door as usual, but
was not admitted.  She heard the two voices in dispute before
she knocked, and then being sent away retreated at once&mdash;the only
person in the house convinced at that time that there was "something
up."</p>

<p>Dark and, so to speak, inscrutable spaces being met with in life
there must be such places in any statement dealing with life. 
In what I am telling you of now&mdash;an episode of one of my humdrum
holidays in the green country, recalled quite naturally after
all the years by our meeting a man who has been a blue-water sailor&mdash;this
evening confabulation is a dark, inscrutable spot.  And we may
conjecture what we like.  I have no difficulty in imagining that
the woman&mdash;of forty, and the chief of the enterprise&mdash;must have
raged at large.  And perhaps the other did not rage enough.  Youth
feels deeply it is true, but it has not the same vivid sense of
lost opportunities.  It believes in the absolute reality of time. 
And then, in that abominable scamp with his youth already soiled,
withered like a plucked flower ready to be flung on some rotting
heap of rubbish, no very genuine feeling about anything could
exist&mdash;not even about the hazards of his own unclean existence. 
A sneering half-laugh with some such remark as: "We are properly
sold and no mistake" would have been enough to make trouble in
that way.  And then another sneer, "Waste time enough over it
too," followed perhaps by the bitter retort from the other party
"You seemed to like it well enough though, playing the fool with
that chit of a girl."  Something of that sort.  Don't you see
it&mdash;eh . . . "</p>

<p>Marlow looked at me with his dark penetrating glance.  I was
struck by the absolute verisimilitude of this suggestion.  But
we were always tilting at each other.  I saw an opening and pushed
my uncandid thrust.</p>

<p>"You have a ghastly imagination," I said with a cheerfully sceptical
smile.</p>

<p>"Well, and if I have," he returned unabashed.  "But let me remind
you that this situation came to me unasked.  I am like a puzzle-headed
chiefmate we had once in the dear old <em>Samarcand</em> when
I was a youngster.  The fellow went gravely about trying to "account
to himself"&mdash;his favourite expression&mdash;for a lot of things no
one would care to bother one's head about.  He was an old idiot
but he was also an accomplished practical seaman.  I was quite
a boy and he impressed me.  I must have caught the disposition
from him."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;go on with your accounting then," I said, assuming an
air of resignation.</p>

<p>"That's just it."  Marlow fell into his stride at once.  "That's
just it. Mere disappointed cupidity cannot account for the proceedings
of the next morning; proceedings which I shall not describe to
you&mdash;but which I shall tell you of presently, not as a matter
of conjecture but of actual fact. Meantime returning to that evening
altercation in deadened tones within the private apartment of
Miss de Barral's governess, what if I were to tell you that disappointment
had most likely made them touchy with each other, but that perhaps
the secret of his careless, railing behaviour, was in the thought,
springing up within him with an emphatic oath of relief "Now there's
nothing to prevent me from breaking away from that old woman." 
And that the secret of her envenomed rage, not against this miserable
and attractive wretch, but against fate, accident and the whole
course of human life, concentrating its venom on de Barral and
including the innocent girl herself, was in the thought, in the
fear crying within her "Now I have nothing to hold him with .
. . "</p>

<p>I couldn't refuse Marlow the tribute of a prolonged whistle "Phew! 
So you suppose that . . . "</p>

<p>He waved his hand impatiently.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose.  It was so.  And anyhow why shouldn't you accept
the supposition.  Do you look upon governesses as creatures above
suspicion or necessarily of moral perfection?  I suppose their
hearts would not stand looking into much better than other people's. 
Why shouldn't a governess have passions, all the passions, even
that of libertinage, and even ungovernable passions; yet suppressed
by the very same means which keep the rest of us in order: early
training&mdash;necessity&mdash;circumstances&mdash;fear of consequences; till
there comes an age, a time when the restraint of years becomes
intolerable&mdash;and infatuation irresistible . . . "</p>

<p>"But if infatuation&mdash;quite possible I admit," I argued, "how
do you account for the nature of the conspiracy."</p>

<p>"You expect a cogency of conduct not usual in women," said Marlow. 
"The subterfuges of a menaced passion are not to be fathomed. 
You think it is going on the way it looks, whereas it is capable,
for its own ends, of walking backwards into a precipice.</p>

<p>When one once acknowledges that she was not a common woman, then
all this is easily understood.  She was abominable but she was
not common.  She had suffered in her life not from its constant
inferiority but from constant self-repression.  A common woman
finding herself placed in a commanding position might have formed
the design to become the second Mrs. de Barral.  Which would have
been impracticable.  De Barral would not have known what to do
with a wife.  But even if by some impossible chance he had made
advances, this governess would have repulsed him with scorn. 
She had treated him always as an inferior being with an assured,
distant politeness.  In her composed, schooled manner she despised
and disliked both father and daughter exceedingly.  I have a notion
that she had always disliked intensely all her charges including
the two ducal (if they were ducal) little girls with whom she
had dazzled de Barral.  What an odious, ungratified existence
it must have been for a woman as avid of all the sensuous emotions
which life can give as most of her betters.</p>

<p>She had seen her youth vanish, her freshness disappear, her hopes
die, and now she felt her flaming middle-age slipping away from
her.  No wonder that with her admirably dressed, abundant hair,
thickly sprinkled with white threads and adding to her elegant
aspect the piquant distinction of a powdered coiffure&mdash;no wonder,
I say, that she clung desperately to her last infatuation for
that graceless young scamp, even to the extent of hatching for
him that amazing plot.  He was not so far gone in degradation
as to make him utterly hopeless for such an attempt. She hoped
to keep him straight with that enormous bribe.  She was clearly
a woman uncommon enough to live without illusions&mdash;which, of course,
does not mean that she was reasonable.  She had said to herself,
perhaps with a fury of self-contempt "In a few years I shall be
too old for anybody. Meantime I shall have him&mdash;and I shall hold
him by throwing to him the money of that ordinary, silly, little
girl of no account."  Well, it was a desperate expedient&mdash;but
she thought it worth while.  And besides there is hardly a woman
in the world, no matter how hard, depraved or frantic, in whom
something of the maternal instinct does not survive, unconsumed
like a salamander, in the fires of the most abandoned passion. 
Yes there might have been that sentiment for him too.  There <em>was</em>
no doubt.  So I say again: No wonder!  No wonder that she raged
at everything&mdash;and perhaps even at him, with contradictory reproaches:
for regretting the girl, a little fool who would never in her
life be worth anybody's attention, and for taking the disaster
itself with a cynical levity in which she perceived a flavour
of revolt.</p>

<p>And so the altercation in the night went on, over the irremediable. 
He arguing "What's the hurry?  Why clear out like this?" perhaps
a little sorry for the girl and as usual without a penny in his
pocket, appreciating the comfortable quarters, wishing to linger
on as long as possible in the shameless enjoyment of this already
doomed luxury.  There was really no hurry for a few days.  Always
time enough to vanish.  And, with that, a touch of masculine softness,
a sort of regard for appearances surviving his degradation: "You
might behave decently at the last, Eliza."  But there was no softness
in the sallow face under the gala effect of powdered hair, its
formal calmness gone, the dark-ringed eyes glaring at him with
a sort of hunger.  "No!  No!  If it is as you say then not a day,
not an hour, not a moment."  She stuck to it, very determined
that there should be no more of that boy and girl philandering
since the object of it was gone; angry with herself for having
suffered from it so much in the past, furious at its having been
all in vain.</p>

<p>But she was reasonable enough not to quarrel with him finally. 
What was the good?  She found means to placate him.  The only
means.  As long as there was some money to be got she had hold
of him.  "Now go away.  We shall do no good by any more of this
sort of talk.  I want to be alone for a bit."  He went away, sulkily
acquiescent.  There was a room always kept ready for him on the
same floor, at the further end of a short thickly carpeted passage.</p>

<p>How she passed the night, this woman with no illusions to help
her through the hours which must have been sleepless I shouldn't
like to say. It ended at last; and this strange victim of the
de Barral failure, whose name would never be known to the Official
Receiver, came down to breakfast, impenetrable in her everyday
perfection.  From the very first, somehow, she had accepted the
fatal news for true.  All her life she had never believed in her
luck, with that pessimism of the passionate who at bottom feel
themselves to be the outcasts of a morally restrained universe. 
But this did not make it any easier, on opening the morning paper
feverishly, to see the thing confirmed.  Oh yes!  It was there. 
The Orb had suspended payment&mdash;the first growl of the storm faint
as yet, but to the initiated the forerunner of a deluge.  As an
item of news it was not indecently displayed.  It was not displayed
at all in a sense.  The serious paper, the only one of the great
dailies which had always maintained an attitude of reserve towards
the de Barral group of banks, had its "manner."  Yes! a modest
item of news!  But there was also, on another page, a special
financial article in a hostile tone beginning with the words "We
have always feared" and a guarded, half-column leader, opening
with the phrase: "It is a deplorable sign of the times" what was,
in effect, an austere, general rebuke to the absurd infatuations
of the investing public.  She glanced through these articles,
a line here and a line there&mdash;no more was necessary to catch beyond
doubt the murmur of the oncoming flood.  Several slighting references
by name to de Barral revived her animosity against the man, suddenly,
as by the effect of unforeseen moral support.  The miserable wretch!
. . . "</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>" &mdash;You understand," Marlow interrupted the current of his
narrative, "that in order to be consecutive in my relation of
this affair I am telling you at once the details which I heard
from Mrs. Fyne later in the day, as well as what little Fyne imparted
to me with his usual solemnity during that morning call.  As you
may easily guess the Fynes, in their apartments, had read the
news at the same time, and, as a matter of fact, in the same august
and highly moral newspaper, as the governess in the luxurious
mansion a few doors down on the opposite side of the street. But
they read them with different feelings.  They were thunderstruck.
Fyne had to explain the full purport of the intelligence to Mrs.
Fyne whose first cry was that of relief.  Then that poor child
would be safe from these designing, horrid people.  Mrs. Fyne
did not know what it might mean to be suddenly reduced from riches
to absolute penury.  Fyne with his masculine imagination was less
inclined to rejoice extravagantly at the girl's escape from the
moral dangers which had been menacing her defenceless existence. 
It was a confoundedly big price to pay.  What an unfortunate little
thing she was!  "We might be able to do something to comfort that
poor child at any rate for the time she is here," said Mrs. Fyne. 
She felt under a sort of moral obligation not to be indifferent.
But no comfort for anyone could be got by rushing out into the
street at this early hour; and so, following the advice of Fyne
not to act hastily, they both sat down at the window and stared
feelingly at the great house, awful to their eyes in its stolid,
prosperous, expensive respectability with ruin absolutely standing
at the door.</p>

<p>By that time, or very soon after, all Brighton had the information
and formed a more or less just appreciation of its gravity.  The
butler in Miss de Barral's big house had seen the news, perhaps
earlier than anybody within a mile of the Parade, in the course
of his morning duties of which one was to dry the freshly delivered
paper before the fire&mdash;an occasion to glance at it which no intelligent
man could have neglected. He communicated to the rest of the household
his vaguely forcible impression that something had gone d&mdash;-bly
wrong with the affairs of "her father in London."</p>

<p>This brought an atmosphere of constraint through the house, which
Flora de Barral coming down somewhat later than usual could not
help noticing in her own way.  Everybody seemed to stare so stupidly
somehow; she feared a dull day.</p>

<p>In the dining-room the governess in her place, a newspaper half-concealed
under the cloth on her lap, after a few words exchanged with lips
that seemed hardly to move, remaining motionless, her eyes fixed
before her in an enduring silence; and presently Charley coming
in to whom she did not even give a glance.  He hardly said good
morning, though he had a halfhearted try to smile at the girl,
and sitting opposite her with his eyes on his plate and slight
quivers passing along the line of his clean-shaven jaw, he too
had nothing to say.  It was dull, horribly dull to begin one's
day like this; but she knew what it was.  These never-ending family
affairs!  It was not for the first time that she had suffered
from their depressing after-effects on these two.  It was a shame
that the delightful Charley should be made dull by these stupid
talks, and it was perfectly stupid of him to let himself be upset
like this by his aunt.</p>

<p>When after a period of still, as if calculating, immobility,
her governess got up abruptly and went out with the paper in her
hand, almost immediately afterwards followed by Charley who left
his breakfast half eaten, the girl was positively relieved.  They
would have it out that morning whatever it was, and be themselves
again in the afternoon.  At least Charley would be.  To the moods
of her governess she did not attach so much importance.</p>

<p>For the first time that morning the Fynes saw the front door
of the awful house open and the objectionable young man issue
forth, his rascality visible to their prejudiced eyes in his very
bowler hat and in the smart cut of his short fawn overcoat.  He
walked away rapidly like a man hurrying to catch a train, glancing
from side to side as though he were carrying something off.  Could
he be departing for good?  Undoubtedly, undoubtedly!  But Mrs.
Fyne's fervent "thank goodness" turned out to be a bit, as the
Americans&mdash;some Americans&mdash;say "previous."  In a very short time
the odious fellow appeared again, strolling, absolutely strolling
back, his hat now tilted a little on one side, with an air of
leisure and satisfaction.  Mrs. Fyne groaned not only in the spirit,
at this sight, but in the flesh, audibly; and asked her husband
what it might mean.  Fyne naturally couldn't say.  Mrs. Fyne believed
that there was something horrid in progress and meantime the object
of her detestation had gone up the steps and had knocked at the
door which at once opened to admit him.</p>

<p>He had been only as far as the bank.</p>

<p>His reason for leaving his breakfast unfinished to run after
Miss de Barral's governess, was to speak to her in reference to
that very errand possessing the utmost possible importance in
his eyes.  He shrugged his shoulders at the nervousness of her
eyes and hands, at the half-strangled whisper "I had to go out. 
I could hardly contain myself."  That was her affair.  He was,
with a young man's squeamishness, rather sick of her ferocity. 
He did not understand it.  Men do not accumulate hate against
each other in tiny amounts, treasuring every pinch carefully till
it grows at last into a monstrous and explosive hoard.  He had
run out after her to remind her of the balance at the bank.  What
about lifting that money without wasting any more time?  She had
promised him to leave nothing behind.</p>

<p>An account opened in her name for the expenses of the establishment
in Brighton, had been fed by de Barral with deferential lavishness. 
The governess crossed the wide hall into a little room at the
side where she sat down to write the cheque, which he hastened
out to go and cash as if it were stolen or a forgery.  As observed
by the Fynes, his uneasy appearance on leaving the house arose
from the fact that his first trouble having been caused by a cheque
of doubtful authenticity, the possession of a document of the
sort made him unreasonably uncomfortable till this one was safely
cashed.  And after all, you know it was stealing of an indirect
sort; for the money was de Barral's money if the account was in
the name of the accomplished lady.  At any rate the cheque was
cashed.  On getting hold of the notes and gold he recovered his
jaunty bearing, it being well known that with certain natures
the presence of money (even stolen) in the pocket, acts as a tonic,
or at least as a stimulant.  He cocked his hat a little on one
side as though he had had a drink or two&mdash;which indeed he might
have had in reality, to celebrate the occasion.</p>

<p>The governess had been waiting for his return in the hall, disregarding
the side-glances of the butler as he went in and out of the dining-room
clearing away the breakfast things.  It was she, herself, who
had opened the door so promptly.  "It's all right," he said touching
his breast-pocket; and she did not dare, the miserable wretch
without illusions, she did not dare ask him to hand it over. 
They looked at each other in silence.  He nodded significantly:
"Where is she now?" and she whispered "Gone into the drawing-room. 
Want to see her again?" with an archly black look which he acknowledged
by a muttered, surly: "I am damned if I do.  Well, as you want
to bolt like this, why don't we go now?"</p>

<p>She set her lips with cruel obstinacy and shook her head.  She
had her idea, her completed plan.  At that moment the Fynes, still
at the window and watching like a pair of private detectives,
saw a man with a long grey beard and a jovial face go up the steps
helping himself with a thick stick, and knock at the door.  Who
could he be?</p>

<p>He was one of Miss de Barral's masters.  She had lately taken
up painting in water-colours, having read in a high-class woman's
weekly paper that a great many princesses of the European royal
houses were cultivating that art.  This was the water-colour morning;
and the teacher, a veteran of many exhibitions, of a venerable
and jovial aspect, had turned up with his usual punctuality. 
He was no great reader of morning papers, and even had he seen
the news it is very likely he would not have understood its real
purport.  At any rate he turned up, as the governess expected
him to do, and the Fynes saw him pass through the fateful door.</p>

<p>He bowed cordially to the lady in charge of Miss de Barral's
education, whom he saw in the hall engaged in conversation with
a very good-looking but somewhat raffish young gentleman.  She
turned to him graciously: "Flora is already waiting for you in
the drawing-room."</p>

<p>The cultivation of the art said to be patronized by princesses
was pursued in the drawing-room from considerations of the right
kind of light.  The governess preceded the master up the stairs
and into the room where Miss de Barral was found arrayed in a
holland pinafore (also of the right kind for the pursuit of the
art) and smilingly expectant.  The water-colour lesson enlivened
by the jocular conversation of the kindly, humorous, old man was
always great fun; and she felt she would be compensated for the
tiresome beginning of the day.</p>

<p>Her governess generally was present at the lesson; but on this
occasion she only sat down till the master and pupil had gone
to work in earnest, and then as though she had suddenly remembered
some order to give, rose quietly and went out of the room.</p>

<p>Once outside, the servants summoned by the passing maid without
a bell being rung, and quick, quick, let all this luggage be taken
down into the hall, and let one of you call a cab.  She stood
outside the drawing-room door on the landing, looking at each
piece, trunk, leather cases, portmanteaus, being carried past
her, her brows knitted and her aspect so sombre and absorbed that
it took some little time for the butler to muster courage enough
to speak to her.  But he reflected that he was a free-born Briton
and had his rights.  He spoke straight to the point but in the
usual respectful manner.</p>

<p>"Beg you pardon, ma'am&mdash;but are you going away for good?"</p>

<p>He was startled by her tone.  Its unexpected, unlady-like harshness
fell on his trained ear with the disagreeable effect of a false
note.  "Yes.  I am going away.  And the best thing for all of
you is to go away too, as soon as you like.  You can go now, to-day,
this moment.  You had your wages paid you only last week.  The
longer you stay the greater your loss.  But I have nothing to
do with it now.  You are the servants of Mr. de Barral&mdash;you know."</p>

<p>The butler was astounded by the manner of this advice, and as
his eyes wandered to the drawing-room door the governess extended
her arm as if to bar the way.  "Nobody goes in there."  And that
was said still in another tone, such a tone that all trace of
the trained respectfulness vanished from the butler's bearing. 
He stared at her with a frank wondering gaze. "Not till I am gone,"
she added, and there was such an expression on her face that the
man was daunted by the mystery of it.  He shrugged his shoulders
slightly and without another word went down the stairs on his
way to the basement, brushing in the hall past Mr. Charles who
hat on head and both hands rammed deep into his overcoat pockets
paced up and down as though on sentry duty there.</p>

<p>The ladies' maid was the only servant upstairs, hovering in the
passage on the first floor, curious and as if fascinated by the
woman who stood there guarding the door.  Being beckoned closer
imperiously and asked by the governess to bring out of the now
empty rooms the hat and veil, the only objects besides the furniture
still to be found there, she did so in silence but inwardly fluttered. 
And while waiting uneasily, with the veil, before that woman who,
without moving a step away from the drawingroom door was pinning
with careless haste her hat on her head, she heard within a sudden
burst of laughter from Miss de Barral enjoying the fun of the
water-colour lesson given her for the last time by the cheery
old man.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Fyne ambushed at their window&mdash;a most incredible
occupation for people of their kind&mdash;saw with renewed anxiety
a cab come to the door, and watched some luggage being carried
out and put on its roof.  The butler appeared for a moment, then
went in again.  What did it mean?  Was Flora going to be taken
to her father; or were these people, that woman and her horrible
nephew, about to carry her off somewhere?  Fyne couldn't tell. 
He doubted the last, Flora having now, he judged, no value, either
positive or speculative.  Though no great reader of character
he did not credit the governess with humane intentions.  He confessed
to me naively that he was excited as if watching some action on
the stage.  Then the thought struck him that the girl might have
had some money settled on her, be possessed of some means, of
some little fortune of her own and therefore&mdash;</p>

<p>He imparted this theory to his wife who shared fully his consternation.
"I can't believe the child will go away without running in to
say goodbye to us," she murmured.  "We must find out!  I shall
ask her."  But at that very moment the cab rolled away, empty
inside, and the door of the house which had been standing slightly
ajar till then was pushed to.</p>

<p>They remained silent staring at it till Mrs. Fyne whispered doubtfully
"I really think I must go over."  Fyne didn't answer for a while
(his is a reflective mind, you know), and then as if Mrs. Fyne's
whispers had an occult power over that door it opened wide again
and the white-bearded man issued, astonishingly active in his
movements, using his stick almost like a leaping-pole to get down
the steps; and hobbled away briskly along the pavement.  Naturally
the Fynes were too far off to make out the expression of his face. 
But it would not have helped them very much to a guess at the
conditions inside the house.  The expression was humorously puzzled&mdash;nothing
more.</p>

<p>For, at the end of his lesson, seizing his trusty stick and coming
out with his habitual vivacity, he very nearly cannoned just outside
the drawing-room door into the back of Miss de Barral's governess. 
He stopped himself in time and she turned round swiftly.  It was
embarrassing; he apologised; but her face was not startled; it
was not aware of him; it wore a singular expression of resolution. 
A very singular expression which, as it were, detained him for
a moment.  In order to cover his embarrassment, he made some inane
remark on the weather, upon which, instead of returning another
inane remark according to the tacit rules of the game, she only
gave him a smile of unfathomable meaning.  Nothing could have
been more singular.  The good-looking young gentleman of questionable
appearance took not the slightest notice of him in the hall. 
No servant was to be seen.  He let himself out pulling the door
to behind him with a crash as, in a manner, he was forced to do
to get it shut at all.</p>

<p>When the echo of it had died away the woman on the landing leaned
over the banister and called out bitterly to the man below "Don't
you want to come up and say good-bye."  He had an impatient movement
of the shoulders and went on pacing to and fro as though he had
not heard.  But suddenly he checked himself, stood still for a
moment, then with a gloomy face and without taking his hands out
of his pockets ran smartly up the stairs. Already facing the door
she turned her head for a whispered taunt: "Come! Confess you
were dying to see her stupid little face once more,"&mdash;to which
he disdained to answer.</p>

<p>Flora de Barral, still seated before the table at which she had
been wording on her sketch, raised her head at the noise of the
opening door. The invading manner of their entrance gave her the
sense of something she had never seen before.  She knew them well. 
She knew the woman better than she knew her father.  There had
been between them an intimacy of relation as great as it can possibly
be without the final closeness of affection.  The delightful Charley
walked in, with his eyes fixed on the back of her governess whose
raised veil hid her forehead like a brown band above the black
line of the eyebrows.  The girl was astounded and alarmed by the
altogether unknown expression in the woman's face.  The stress
of passion often discloses an aspect of the personality completely
ignored till then by its closest intimates.  There was something
like an emanation of evil from her eyes and from the face of the
other, who, exactly behind her and overtopping her by half a head,
kept his eyelids lowered in a sinister fashion&mdash;which in the poor
girl, reached, stirred, set free that faculty of unreasoning explosive
terror lying locked up at the bottom of all human hearts and of
the hearts of animals as well.  With suddenly enlarged pupils
and a movement as instinctive almost as the bounding of a startled
fawn, she jumped up and found herself in the middle of the big
room, exclaiming at those amazing and familiar strangers.</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>You will note that she cried: What do you want?  Not: What has
happened? She told Mrs. Fyne that she had received suddenly the
feeling of being personally attacked.  And that must have been
very terrifying.  The woman before her had been the wisdom, the
authority, the protection of life, security embodied and visible
and undisputed.</p>

<p>You may imagine then the force of the shock in the intuitive
perception not merely of danger, for she did not know what was
alarming her, but in the sense of the security being gone.  And
not only security.  I don't know how to explain it clearly.  Look! 
Even a small child lives, plays and suffers in terms of its conception
of its own existence.  Imagine, if you can, a fact coming in suddenly
with a force capable of shattering that very conception itself. 
It was only because of the girl being still so much of a child
that she escaped mental destruction; that, in other words she
got over it.  Could one conceive of her more mature, while still
as ignorant as she was, one must conclude that she would have
become an idiot on the spot&mdash;long before the end of that experience.
Luckily, people, whether mature or not mature (and who really
is ever mature?) are for the most part quite incapable of understanding
what is happening to them: a merciful provision of nature to preserve
an average amount of sanity for working purposes in this world
. . . "</p>

<p>"But we, my dear Marlow, have the inestimable advantage of understanding
what is happening to others," I struck in.  "Or at least some
of us seem to.  Is that too a provision of nature?  And what is
it for?  Is it that we may amuse ourselves gossiping about each
other's affairs?  You for instance seem&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't know what I seem," Marlow silenced me, "and surely life
must be amused somehow.  It would be still a very respectable
provision if it were only for that end.  But from that same provision
of understanding, there springs in us compassion, charity, indignation,
the sense of solidarity; and in minds of any largeness an inclination
to that indulgence which is next door to affection.  I don't mean
to say that I am inclined to an indulgent view of the precious
couple which broke in upon an unsuspecting girl.  They came marching
in (it's the very expression she used later on to Mrs. Fyne) but
at her cry they stopped. It must have been startling enough to
them.  It was like having the mask torn off when you don't expect
it.  The man stopped for good; he didn't offer to move a step
further.  But, though the governess had come in there for the
very purpose of taking the mask off for the first time in her
life, she seemed to look upon the frightened cry as a fresh provocation. 
"What are you screaming for, you little fool?" she said advancing
alone close to the girl who was affected exactly as if she had
seen Medusa's head with serpentine locks set mysteriously on the
shoulders of that familiar person, in that brown dress, under
that hat she knew so well.  It made her lose all her hold on reality. 
She told Mrs. Fyne: "I didn't know where I was.  I didn't even
know that I was frightened.  If she had told me it was a joke
I would have laughed.  If she had told me to put on my hat and
go out with her I would have gone to put on my hat and gone out
with her and never said a single word; I should have been convinced
I had been mad for a minute or so, and I would have worried myself
to death rather than breathe a hint of it to her or anyone.  But
the wretch put her face close to mine and I could not move. Directly
I had looked into her eyes I felt grown on to the carpet."</p>

<p>It was years afterwards that she used to talk like this to Mrs.
Fyne&mdash;and to Mrs. Fyne alone.  Nobody else ever heard the story
from her lips.  But it was never forgotten.  It was always felt;
it remained like a mark on her soul, a sort of mystic wound, to
be contemplated, to be meditated over.  And she said further to
Mrs. Fyne, in the course of many confidences provoked by that
contemplation, that, as long as that woman called her names, it
was almost soothing, it was in a manner reassuring. Her imagination
had, like her body, gone off in a wild bound to meet the unknown;
and then to hear after all something which more in its tone than
in its substance was mere venomous abuse, had steadied the inward
flutter of all her being.</p>

<p>"She called me a little fool more times than I can remember. 
I!  A fool! Why, Mrs. Fyne!  I do assure you I had never yet thought
at all; never of anything in the world, till then.  I just went
on living.  And one can't be a fool without one has at least tried
to think.  But what had I ever to think about?"</p>

<p>"And no doubt," commented Marlow, "her life had been a mere life
of sensations&mdash;the response to which can neither be foolish nor
wise.  It can only be temperamental; and I believe that she was
of a generally happy disposition, a child of the average kind. 
Even when she was asked violently whether she imagined that there
was anything in her, apart from her money, to induce any intelligent
person to take any sort of interest in her existence, she only
caught her breath in one dry sob and said nothing, made no other
sound, made no movement.  When she was viciously assured that
she was in heart, mind, manner and appearance, an utterly common
and insipid creature, she remained still, without indignation,
without anger.  She stood, a frail and passive vessel into which
the other went on pouring all the accumulated dislike for all
her pupils, her scorn of all her employers (the ducal one included),
the accumulated resentment, the infinite hatred of all these unrelieved
years of &mdash;I won't say hypocrisy.  The practice of perfect
hypocrisy is a relief in itself, a secret triumph of the vilest
sort, no doubt, but still a way of getting even with the common
morality from which some of us appear to suffer so much.  No! 
I will say the years, the passionate, bitter years, of restraint,
the iron, admirably mannered restraint at every moment, in a never-failing
perfect correctness of speech, glances, movements, smiles, gestures,
establishing for her a high reputation, an impressive record of
success in her sphere.  It had been like living half strangled
for years.</p>

<p>And all this torture for nothing, in the end!  What looked at
last like a possible prize (oh, without illusions! but still a
prize) broken in her hands, fallen in the dust, the bitter dust,
of disappointment, she revelled in the miserable revenge&mdash;pretty
safe too&mdash;only regretting the unworthiness of the girlish figure
which stood for so much she had longed to be able to spit venom
at, if only once, in perfect liberty.  The presence of the young
man at her back increased both her satisfaction and her rage. 
But the very violence of the attack seemed to defeat its end by
rendering the representative victim as it were insensible.  The
cause of this outrage naturally escaping the girl's imagination
her attitude was in effect that of dense, hopeless stupidity. 
And it is a fact that the worst shocks of life are often received
without outcries, without gestures, without a flow of tears and
the convulsions of sobbing.  The insatiable governess missed these
signs exceedingly.  This pitiful stolidity was only a fresh provocation. 
Yet the poor girl was deadly pale.</p>

<p>"I was cold," she used to explain to Mrs. Fyne.  "I had had time
to get terrified.  She had pushed her face so near mine and her
teeth looked as though she wanted to bite me.  Her eyes seemed
to have become quite dry, hard and small in a lot of horrible
wrinkles.  I was too afraid of her to shudder, too afraid of her
to put my fingers to my ears.  I didn't know what I expected her
to call me next, but when she told me I was no better than a beggar&mdash;that
there would be no more masters, no more servants, no more horses
for me &mdash;I said to myself: Is that all?  I should have laughed
if I hadn't been too afraid of her to make the least little sound."</p>

<p>It seemed that poor Flora had to know all the possible phases
of that sort of anguish, beginning with instinctive panic, through
the bewildered stage, the frozen stage and the stage of blanched
apprehension, down to the instinctive prudence of extreme terror&mdash;the
stillness of the mouse. But when she heard herself called the
child of a cheat and a swindler, the very monstrous unexpectedness
of this caused in her a revulsion towards letting herself go. 
She screamed out all at once "You mustn't speak like this of Papa!"</p>

<p>The effort of it uprooted her from that spot where her little
feet seemed dug deep into the thick luxurious carpet, and she
retreated backwards to a distant part of the room, hearing herself
repeat "You mustn't, you mustn't" as if it were somebody else
screaming.  She came to a chair and flung herself into it.  Thereupon
the somebody else ceased screaming and she lolled, exhausted,
sightless, in a silent room, as if indifferent to everything and
without a single thought in her head.</p>

<p>The next few seconds seemed to last for ever so long; a black
abyss of time separating what was past and gone from the reappearance
of the governess and the reawakening of fear.  And that woman
was forcing the words through her set teeth: "You say I mustn't,
I mustn't.  All the world will be speaking of him like this to-morrow. 
They will say it, and they'll print it.  You shall hear it and
you shall read it&mdash;and then you shall know whose daughter you
are."</p>

<p>Her face lighted up with an atrocious satisfaction.  "He's nothing
but a thief," she cried, "this father of yours.  As to you I have
never been deceived in you for a moment.  I have been growing
more and more sick of you for years.  You are a vulgar, silly
nonentity, and you shall go back to where you belong, whatever
low place you have sprung from, and beg your bread&mdash;that is if
anybody's charity will have anything to do with you, which I doubt&mdash;"</p>

<p>She would have gone on regardless of the enormous eyes, of the
open mouth of the girl who sat up suddenly with the wild staring
expression of being choked by invisible fingers on her throat,
and yet horribly pale.  The effect on her constitution was so
profound, Mrs. Fyne told me, that she who as a child had a rather
pretty delicate colouring, showed a white bloodless face for a
couple of years afterwards, and remained always liable at the
slightest emotion to an extraordinary ghost-like whiteness. The
end came in the abomination of desolation of the poor child's
miserable cry for help: "Charley!  Charley!" coming from her throat
in hidden gasping efforts.  Her enlarged eyes had discovered him
where he stood motionless and dumb.</p>

<p>He started from his immobility, a hand withdrawn brusquely from
the pocket of his overcoat, strode up to the woman, seized her
by the arm from behind, saying in a rough commanding tone: "Come
away, Eliza."  In an instant the child saw them close together
and remote, near the door, gone through the door, which she neither
heard nor saw being opened or shut.  But it was shut.  Oh yes,
it was shut.  Her slow unseeing glance wandered all over the room. 
For some time longer she remained leaning forward, collecting
her strength, doubting if she would be able to stand. She stood
up at last.  Everything about her spun round in an oppressive
silence.  She remembered perfectly&mdash;as she told Mrs. Fyne&mdash;that
clinging to the arm of the chair she called out twice "Papa! 
Papa!"  At the thought that he was far away in London everything
about her became quite still.  Then, frightened suddenly by the
solitude of that empty room, she rushed out of it blindly.</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>With that fatal diffidence in well doing, inherent in the present
condition of humanity, the Fynes continued to watch at their window.
"It's always so difficult to know what to do for the best," Fyne
assured me.  It is.  Good intentions stand in their own way so
much.  Whereas if you want to do harm to anyone you needn't hesitate. 
You have only to go on.  No one will reproach you with your mistakes
or call you a confounded, clumsy meddler.  The Fynes watched the
door, the closed street door inimical somehow to their benevolent
thoughts, the face of the house cruelly impenetrable.  It was
just as on any other day.  The unchanged daily aspect of inanimate
things is so impressive that Fyne went back into the room for
a moment, picked up the paper again, and ran his eyes over the
item of news.  No doubt of it.  It looked very bad.  He came back
to the window and Mrs. Fyne.  Tired out as she was she sat there
resolute and ready for responsibility.  But she had no suggestion
to offer.  People do fear a rebuff wonderfully, and all her audacity
was in her thoughts.  She shrank from the incomparably insolent
manner of the governess.  Fyne stood by her side, as in those
old-fashioned photographs of married couples where you see a husband
with his hand on the back of his wife's chair.  And they were
about as efficient as an old photograph, and as still, till Mrs.
Fyne started slightly.  The street door had swung open, and, bursting
out, appeared the young man, his hat (Mrs. Fyne observed) tilted
forward over his eyes.  After him the governess slipped through,
turning round at once to shut the door behind her with care. Meantime
the man went down the white steps and strode along the pavement,
his hands rammed deep into the pockets of his fawn overcoat. 
The woman, that woman of composed movements, of deliberate superior
manner, took a little run to catch up with him, and directly she
had caught up with him tried to introduce her hand under his arm. 
Mrs. Fyne saw the brusque half turn of the fellow's body as one
avoids an importunate contact, defeating her attempt rudely. 
She did not try again but kept pace with his stride, and Mrs.
Fyne watched them, walking independently, turn the corner of the
street side by side, disappear for ever.</p>

<p>The Fynes looked at each other eloquently, doubtfully: What do
you think of this?  Then with common accord turned their eyes
back to the street door, closed, massive, dark; the great, clear-brass
knocker shining in a quiet slant of sunshine cut by a diagonal
line of heavy shade filling the further end of the street.  Could
the girl be already gone?  Sent away to her father?  Had she any
relations?  Nobody but de Barral himself ever came to see her,
Mrs. Fyne remembered; and she had the instantaneous, profound,
maternal perception of the child's loneliness&mdash;and a girl too!
It was irresistible.  And, besides, the departure of the governess
was not without its encouraging influence.  "I am going over at
once to find out," she declared resolutely but still staring across
the street.  Her intention was arrested by the sight of that awful,
sombrely glistening door, swinging back suddenly on the yawning
darkness of the hall, out of which literally flew out, right out
on the pavement, almost without touching the white steps, a little
figure swathed in a holland pinafore up to the chin, its hair
streaming back from its head, darting past a lamp-post, past the
red pillar-box . . . "Here," cried Mrs. Fyne; "she's coming here! 
Run, John!  Run!"</p>

<p>Fyne bounded out of the room.  This is his own word.  Bounded! 
He assured me with intensified solemnity that he bounded; and
the sight of the short and muscular Fyne bounding gravely about
the circumscribed passages and staircases of a small, very high
class, private hotel, would have been worth any amount of money
to a man greedy of memorable impressions.  But as I looked at
him, the desire of laughter at my very lips, I asked myself: how
many men could be found ready to compromise their cherished gravity
for the sake of the unimportant child of a ruined financier with
an ugly, black cloud already wreathing his head.  I didn't laugh
at little Fyne.  I encouraged him: "You did!&mdash;very good . . .
Well?"</p>

<p>His main thought was to save the child from some unpleasant interference.
There was a porter downstairs, page boys; some people going away
with their trunks in the passage; a railway omnibus at the door,
white-breasted waiters dodging about the entrance.</p>

<p>He was in time.  He was at the door before she reached it in
her blind course.  She did not recognize him; perhaps she did
not see him.  He caught her by the arm as she ran past and, very
sensibly, without trying to check her, simply darted in with her
and up the stairs, causing no end of consternation amongst the
people in his way.  They scattered.  What might have been their
thoughts at the spectacle of a shameless middleaged man abducting
headlong into the upper regions of a respectable hotel a terrified
young girl obviously under age, I don't know.  And Fyne (he told
me so) did not care for what people might think.  All he wanted
was to reach his wife before the girl collapsed.  For a time she
ran with him but at the last flight of stairs he had to seize
and half drag, half carry her to his wife.  Mrs. Fyne waited at
the door with her quite unmoved physiognomy and her readiness
to confront any sort of responsibility, which already characterized
her, long before she became a ruthless theorist.  Relieved, his
mission accomplished, Fyne closed hastily the door of the sitting-room.</p>

<p>But before long both Fynes became frightened.  After a period
of immobility in the arms of Mrs. Fyne, the girl, who had not
said a word, tore herself out from that slightly rigid embrace. 
She struggled dumbly between them, they did not know why, soundless
and ghastly, till she sank exhausted on a couch.  Luckily the
children were out with the two nurses. The hotel housemaid helped
Mrs. Fyne to put Flora de Barral to bed.  She was as if gone speechless
and insane.  She lay on her back, her face white like a piece
of paper, her dark eyes staring at the ceiling, her awful immobility
broken by sudden shivering fits with a loud chattering of teeth
in the shadowy silence of the room, the blinds pulled down, Mrs.
Fyne sitting by patiently, her arms folded, yet inwardly moved
by the riddle of that distress of which she could not guess the
word, and saying to herself: "That child is too emotional&mdash;much
too emotional to be ever really sound!"  As if anyone not made
of stone could be perfectly sound in this world.  And then how
sound?  In what sense&mdash;to resist what?  Force or corruption? 
And even in the best armour of steel there are joints a treacherous
stroke can always find if chance gives the opportunity.</p>

<p>General considerations never had the power to trouble Mrs. Fyne
much.  The girl not being in a state to be questioned she waited
by the bedside. Fyne had crossed over to the house, his scruples
overcome by his anxiety to discover what really had happened. 
He did not have to lift the knocker; the door stood open on the
inside gloom of the hall; he walked into it and saw no one about,
the servants having assembled for a fatuous consultation in the
basement.  Fyne's uplifted bass voice startled them down there,
the butler coming up, staring and in his shirt sleeves, very suspicious
at first, and then, on Fyne's explanation that he was the husband
of a lady who had called several times at the house &mdash;Miss
de Barral's mother's friend&mdash;becoming humanely concerned and communicative,
in a man to man tone, but preserving his trained high-class servant's
voice: "Oh bless you, sir, no!  She does not mean to come back. 
She told me so herself"&mdash;he assured Fyne with a faint shade of
contempt creeping into his tone.</p>

<p>As regards their young lady nobody downstairs had any idea that
she had run out of the house.  He dared say they all would have
been willing to do their very best for her, for the time being;
but since she was now with her mother's friends . . .</p>

<p>He fidgeted.  He murmured that all this was very unexpected. 
He wanted to know what he had better do with letters or telegrams
which might arrive in the course of the day.</p>

<p>"Letters addressed to Miss de Barral, you had better bring over
to my hotel over there," said Fyne beginning to feel extremely
worried about the future.  The man said "Yes, sir," adding, "and
if a letter comes addressed to Mrs. . . . "</p>

<p>Fyne stopped him by a gesture.  "I don't know . . . Anything
you like."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir."</p>

<p>The butler did not shut the street door after Fyne, but remained
on the doorstep for a while, looking up and down the street in
the spirit of independent expectation like a man who is again
his own master.  Mrs. Fyne hearing her husband return came out
of the room where the girl was lying in bed.  "No change," she
whispered; and Fyne could only make a hopeless sign of ignorance
as to what all this meant and how it would end.</p>

<p>He feared future complications&mdash;naturally; a man of limited means,
in a public position, his time not his own.  Yes.  He owned to
me in the parlour of my farmhouse that he had been very much concerned
then at the possible consequences.  But as he was making this
artless confession I said to myself that, whatever consequences
and complications he might have imagined, the complication from
which he was suffering now could never, never have presented itself
to his mind.  Slow but sure (for I conceive that the Book of Destiny
has been written up from the beginning to the last page) it had
been coming for something like six years&mdash;and now it had come. 
The complication was there!  I looked at his unshaken solemnity
with the amused pity we give the victim of a funny if somewhat
ill-natured practical joke.</p>

<p>"Oh hang it," he exclaimed&mdash;in no logical connection with what
he had been relating to me.  Nevertheless the exclamation was
intelligible enough.</p>

<p>However at first there were, he admitted, no untoward complications,
no embarrassing consequences.  To a telegram in guarded terms
dispatched to de Barral no answer was received for more than twenty-four
hours.  This certainly caused the Fynes some anxiety.  When the
answer arrived late on the evening of next day it was in the shape
of an elderly man.  An unexpected sort of man.  Fyne explained
to me with precision that he evidently belonged to what is most
respectable in the lower middle classes.  He was calm and slow
in his speech.  He was wearing a frockcoat, had grey whiskers
meeting under his chin, and declared on entering that Mr. de Barral
was his cousin.  He hastened to add that he had not seen his cousin
for many years, while he looked upon Fyne (who received him alone)
with so much distrust that Fyne felt hurt (the person actually
refusing at first the chair offered to him) and retorted tartly
that he, for his part, had <em>never</em> seen Mr. de Barral,
in his life, and that, since the visitor did not want to sit down,
he, Fyne, begged him to state his business as shortly as possible. 
The man in black sat down then with a faint superior smile.</p>

<p>He had come for the girl.  His cousin had asked him in a note
delivered by a messenger to go to Brighton at once and take "his
girl" over from a gentleman named Fyne and give her house-room
for a time in his family. And there he was.  His business had
not allowed him to come sooner.  His business was the manufacture
on a large scale of cardboard boxes.  He had two grown-up girls
of his own.  He had consulted his wife and so that was all right. 
The girl would get a welcome in his home.  His home most likely
was not what she had been used to but, etc. etc.</p>

<p>All the time Fyne felt subtly in that man's manner a derisive
disapproval of everything that was not lower middle class, a profound
respect for money, a mean sort of contempt for speculators that
fail, and a conceited satisfaction with his own respectable vulgarity.</p>

<p>With Mrs. Fyne the manner of the obscure cousin of de Barral
was but little less offensive.  He looked at her rather slyly
but her cold, decided demeanour impressed him.  Mrs. Fyne on her
side was simply appalled by the personage, but did not show it
outwardly.  Not even when the man remarked with false simplicity
that Florrie&mdash;her name was Florrie wasn't it? would probably miss
at first all her grand friends.  And when he was informed that
the girl was in bed, not feeling well at all he showed an unsympathetic
alarm.  She wasn't an invalid was she?  No.  What was the matter
with her then?</p>

<p>An extreme distaste for that respectable member of society was
depicted in Fyne's face even as he was telling me of him after
all these years.  He was a specimen of precisely the class of
which people like the Fynes have the least experience; and I imagine
he jarred on them painfully.  He possessed all the civic virtues
in their very meanest form, and the finishing touch was given
by a low sort of consciousness he manifested of possessing them. 
His industry was exemplary.  He wished to catch the earliest possible
train next morning.  It seems that for seven and twenty years
he had never missed being seated on his office-stool at the factory
punctually at ten o'clock every day.  He listened to Mrs. Fyne's
objections with undisguised impatience.  Why couldn't Florrie
get up and have her breakfast at eight like other people?  In
his house the breakfast was at eight sharp.  Mrs. Fyne's polite
stoicism overcame him at last.  He had come down at a very great
personal inconvenience, he assured her with displeasure, but he
gave up the early train.</p>

<p>The good Fynes didn't dare to look at each other before this
unforeseen but perfectly authorized guardian, the same thought
springing up in their minds: Poor girl!  Poor girl!  If the women
of the family were like this too! . . . And of course they would
be.  Poor girl!  But what could they have done even if they had
been prepared to raise objections.  The person in the frock-coat
had the father's note; he had shown it to Fyne.  Just a request
to take care of the girl&mdash;as her nearest relative&mdash;without any
explanation or a single allusion to the financial catastrophe,
its tone strangely detached and in its very silence on the point
giving occasion to think that the writer was not uneasy as to
the child's future. Probably it was that very idea which had set
the cousin so readily in motion.  Men had come before out of commercial
crashes with estates in the country and a comfortable income,
if not for themselves then for their wives.  And if a wife could
be made comfortable by a little dexterous management then why
not a daughter?  Yes.  This possibility might have been discussed
in the person's household and judged worth acting upon.</p>

<p>The man actually hinted broadly that such was his belief and
in face of Fyne's guarded replies gave him to understand that
he was not the dupe of such reticences.  Obviously he looked upon
the Fynes as being disappointed because the girl was taken away
from them.  They, by a diplomatic sacrifice in the interests of
poor Flora, had asked the man to dinner.  He accepted ungraciously,
remarking that he was not used to late hours.  He had generally
a bit of supper about half-past eight or nine. However . . .</p>

<p>He gazed contemptuously round the prettily decorated dining-room. 
He wrinkled his nose in a puzzled way at the dishes offered to
him by the waiter but refused none, devouring the food with a
great appetite and drinking ("swilling" Fyne called it) gallons
of ginger beer, which was procured for him (in stone bottles)
at his request.  The difficulty of keeping up a conversation with
that being exhausted Mrs. Fyne herself, who had come to the table
armed with adamantine resolution.  The only memorable thing he
said was when, in a pause of gorging himself "with these French
dishes" he deliberately let his eyes roam over the little tables
occupied by parties of diners, and remarked that his wife did
for a moment think of coming down with him, but that he was glad
she didn't do so.  "She wouldn't have been at all happy seeing
all this alcohol about.  Not at all happy," he declared weightily.</p>

<p>"You must have had a charming evening," I said to Fyne, "if I
may judge from the way you have kept the memory green."</p>

<p>"Delightful," he growled with, positively, a flash of anger at
the recollection, but lapsed back into his solemnity at once. 
After we had been silent for a while I asked whether the man took
away the girl next day.</p>

<p>Fyne said that he did; in the afternoon, in a fly, with a few
clothes the maid had got together and brought across from the
big house.  He only saw Flora again ten minutes before they left
for the railway station, in the Fynes' sitting-room at the hotel. 
It was a most painful ten minutes for the Fynes.  The respectable
citizen addressed Miss de Barral as "Florrie" and "my dear," remarking
to her that she was not very big "there's not much of you my dear"
in a familiarly disparaging tone.  Then turning to Mrs. Fyne,
and quite loud "She's very white in the face.  Why's that?"  To
this Mrs. Fyne made no reply.  She had put the girl's hair up
that morning with her own hands.  It changed her very much, observed
Fyne.  He, naturally, played a subordinate, merely approving part. 
All he could do for Miss de Barral personally was to go downstairs
and put her into the fly himself, while Miss de Barral's nearest
relation, having been shouldered out of the way, stood by, with
an umbrella and a little black bag, watching this proceeding with
grim amusement, as it seemed.  It was difficult to guess what
the girl thought or what she felt.  She no longer looked a child. 
She whispered to Fyne a faint "Thank you," from the fly, and he
said to her in very distinct tones and while still holding her
hand: "Pray don't forget to write fully to my wife in a day or
two, Miss de Barral."  Then Fyne stepped back and the cousin climbed
into the fly muttering quite audibly: "I don't think you'll be
troubled much with her in the future;" without however looking
at Fyne on whom he did not even bestow a nod.  The fly drove away.</p>
