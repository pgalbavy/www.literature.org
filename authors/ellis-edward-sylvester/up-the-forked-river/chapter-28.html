<p>In his haste General Yozarro had given no orders to secure the
tugboat in place, nor was there need of doing so. The water was
deep enough to permit the craft to lie against the bank, where
it was held by the gentle turning of the screw. With a few more
vigorous revolutions, the prow would have gouged into the bank,
or taken the boat into the river on the proper direction of the
wheel.</p>

<p>Running across the gangplank, with a firearm in each hand, Major
Starland bounded up the few steps leading to the upper deck. The
Captain of the boat was seated in the pilot house, calmly smoking
a cigarette while he waited. His gaze being turned dreamily toward
the river, he saw nothing of the intruder, or, if he heard his
footsteps, he was not disturbed. His awakening came, when the
athletic American strode forward and thrust a revolver through
the window of the pilot house.</p>

<p>"Do as I tell you and you won't be hurt; try to do different
and I'll blow your brains out!"</p>

<p>These words, uttered in Spanish, were to the point. Without them,
the action of the officer would have made his meaning clear. The
Captain was cooler and braver than any of his countrymen. He did
not stir, but looking into the face of the other, removed his
cigarette and said:</p>

<p>"I shall be pleased, Se単or, to be told in what way I can serve
you."</p>

<p>"You shall learn in a moment; at present continue smoking, and
hold yourself ready for orders."</p>

<p>He bowed and with a smile that showed his even white teeth, replied:</p>

<p>"I am happy to do as you say."</p>

<p>"Are you armed?"</p>

<p>"I am the Captain of this boat; General Yozarro does not allow
me to attend to any other duty; I have no weapon on me; would
you prefer to search me?"</p>

<p>"I accept your word."</p>

<p>The Major turned to look for Guzman and Martella. The sound of
voices showed that they were on the boat.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "A <em>DARING CAPTURE</em>."]</p>

<p>"Warrenia," he called, "come aboard!"</p>

<p>She was alert and moved quickly up the plank.</p>

<p>"Now, Captain, steam out into the river."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, do you not wish the gangplank drawn in?"</p>

<p>"We have no time; do not wait."</p>

<p>The Captain was on his feet, one hand resting on a spoke of the
wheel, while the other gripped the curved piece of brass, which
being drawn upward twice sent an order to the engineer to back
the boat. Major Starland stood listening with some misgiving,
for he did not know how things had gone below. The response, however,
indicated that all was well, for almost on the instant, the screw
began churning, and the boat slowly receded, allowing the gangplank,
after being drawn askew, to drop with a splash into the water.</p>

<p>Knowing the purpose of their leader, Guzman and Martella had
hurried into the engine room, where Valentin Herrera, the engineer,
was found dozing. The place was smotheringly hot, and below, the
firemen were asleep, so used to it that they would have slumbered
in tophet itself.</p>

<p>There was consternation for a moment, but it did not take the
visitors long to impress upon the men that the boat had been captured
and that their lives depended upon their prompt acceptance of
the changed conditions.</p>

<p>"How many are with you?" asked the engineer, who knew his former
fireman so well that he did not feel much personal fear of him.</p>

<p>"Enough to hold you all at our mercy."</p>

<p>"You know Captain Ortega is in the wheelhouse."</p>

<p>"Major Starland has attended to him."</p>

<p>"I have heard no pistol shot."</p>

<p>"The Captain is a wise man and has surrendered; Valentin, I want
to make General Yozarro angrier than before," added Martella with
a grin.</p>

<p>"He cannot be any angrier than he has been ever since I gave
him your message; but I accept the situation. He cannot condemn
his men for being overpowered when he leaves them no weapons with
which to fight. You needn't fret about the firemen or me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then the gong clinked in response to the switching in the
pilot house above.</p>

<p>"That means go back."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't wait, Valentin; our leader, <em>el Americano</em>,
is impatient, and is quick to use the revolver he carries."</p>

<p>"It is my duty to obey orders," commented the engineer, with
another grin, as he made the necessary shifting of cranks and
levers to set the machinery to plunging and swinging. The drowsy
firemen cared little for what was going on over their heads and
slouchily threw wood into the furnace.</p>

<p>"It is my wish to go to Zalapata," Major Starland explained to
the Captain of the tug; "General Yozarro set out to take my sister
there last night, but seems to have changed his mind, for he brought
her only part way. We will now complete the journey."</p>

<p>"At the highest speed, Se単or?"</p>

<p>The American did not catch the significance of this question,
but accidentally he made the best answer.</p>

<p>"There is no haste necessary; we shall be able to reach there
soon after sunrise; you know how fast to go; am I understood?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, Se単or."</p>

<p>Feeling himself master of the craft, Starland now went back into
the Captain's cabin to see his sister, whom he found seated in
the quarters which had been occupied by her and the Se単orita Estacardo
the evening before. Although this species of craft are not intended
to carry passengers, outside the necessary equipment, General
Yozarro had caused the small compartment to be fitted up and furnished
suitably for the entertainment of guests. The swinging lamp was
lighted overhead, and the bottles, glasses and fragments of cigarettes
showed how the Dictator and his friends had spent most of the
time in coming from Atlamalco.</p>

<p>Miss Starland was flustered and nervous, but the cool self possession
of her brother greatly reassured her.</p>

<p>"That was a clever trick we played upon the scamp," said he with
a smile.</p>

<p>"What do you intend to do with the boat?"</p>

<p>"Take you to Zalapata; it would serve him right if I scuttled
it, but I will turn it over to Bambos to keep or destroy as he
pleases&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was about to speak, when shouts and calls caused both to
hurry outside. As might have been anticipated, General Yozarro
and his party had speedily returned and had halted on the edge
of the river, the President shouting his orders for Captain Ortega
to return at once. The Major, standing beside the pilot house,
could not deny himself the pleasure of answering for the other.</p>

<p>"The Captain is under my orders; he cannot obey you."</p>

<p>"That is my boat!" howled General Yozarro; "return at once or
suffer the consequences of your thievery."</p>

<p>"I'll suffer the consequences, but I am only borrowing it for
a little while; you did not seem to be able to deliver Miss Starland
to Zalapata, and I will do it myself; I place at your disposal
the small boat we left behind."</p>

<p>"I shall make known your crime to your government," shouted the
Dictator, for nothing better to say.</p>

<p>"I shall be glad; perhaps it would be better to lay it before
The Hague Tribunal. The whole world will be interested in learning
what a cowardly wretch calls himself President of the Atlamalcan
Republic."</p>
