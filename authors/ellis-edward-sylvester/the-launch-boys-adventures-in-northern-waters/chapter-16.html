<p>Chester bounded out of bed and hunted to the door, which he unlocked
and opened for a few inches. He could see nothing in the gloom,
and asked in a whisper:</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"It is I &mdash;Nora. Mamma and I are awfully scared."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Somebody is in the store downstairs."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"Mamma heard the window raised and woke me. She asked me to call
you boys."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment and we'll be with you."</p>

<p>It showed how lightly Alvin and Mike were sleeping when they
were instantly roused by the slight noise made in opening the
door. Each sat on the side of his couch and listened. In the deep
silence they heard the snatch of conversation and hurriedly began
putting on their clothes. They wrought silently and without lighting
the lamp.</p>

<p>"I expected it," remarked Chester, imitating them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Friestone joined her daughter in the dark hall, she being
too wise to use a light. A moment later the whole party stood
together in the gloom, where neither could see the face of the
others.</p>

<p>"Hark!" whispered the mother.</p>

<p>The five stood for a minute without stirring or speaking and
hardly breathing. Not the slightest sound reached their ears.
Then Chester asked in a guarded undertone:</p>

<p>"Are you sure you were not mistaken, Mrs. Friestone?"</p>

<p>"I could not have been; the sound of the raising of the window
was too distinct for me to be deceived&mdash;hark!" she warned again.</p>

<p>This time all heard something. It was a faint, rasping noise
such as might have been caused by the cautious pushing of a box
or large smooth object over the floor. If this were so, the article
could not have been moved more than a few inches, for the sound
ceased immediately.</p>

<p>"You are right," said Alvin; "you have visitors. About what time
do you suppose it is?"</p>

<p>"The clock struck twelve quite awhile ago. There! it is now one,"
she added as a silvery tinkle came from the parlor.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" asked Nora, echoing the question that was
in the mind of every one.</p>

<p>And then a strange council was held in a place so dark that all
who took part were mutually invisible.</p>

<p>It would seem that the common sense course was to make a noise
that would be heard by the burglars and would scare them off.
That is to say that theoretically this would occur, but it might
not. Knowing how much loot was within their reach, if not already
in hand, one or two of them were likely to hurry upstairs and
compel those that were there to hold their peace, hesitating at
no violence to enforce their orders.</p>

<p>While the boys were eager to take the risk, the mother would
not agree and the plan had to be abandoned.</p>

<p>The next proposal was for each to thrust his or her head out
of a window and call for help. The cry would rouse the village
and it would not take long for many citizens to rush thither.
Beartown had no police force, the only officer of the peace being
a constable who was lame and cross-eyed and lived at the farthest
end of the village. No dependence could be placed on him, but
there were plenty of others who would gladly hasten to the help
of mother and daughter.</p>

<p>This was the only thing to do, and it would have been done but
for the hysterical opposition of Nora Friestone. She declared
that the dreadful robbers&mdash;she was sure of it&mdash;would hurry upstairs
the instant the first scream was made and kill every one before
any help could arrive! It might not take more than five or ten
minutes for friends to run to the spot, but that would be enough
for the burglars to complete their awful work.</p>

<p>Possibly the girl might have been argued out of her absurd fear
had she not won her mother to her side. She took the same view.</p>

<p>"What then is to be done?" asked Chester a trifle impatiently.</p>

<p>"Nothing; they can't get the safe open, if they work till daylight."</p>

<p>"They can do it in a few minutes if they use dynamite, and at
the same time blow out the whole end of your house."</p>

<p>To this terrifying declaration the lady could make no reply except
to say:</p>

<p>"We may as well go back to our rooms."</p>

<p>It was on the point of Chester's tongue to ask in view of this
conclusion why Nora had knocked on their door, but he thought
best to refrain.</p>

<p>"Whisht!" whispered Mike; "let's go to the parlor, where we have
the moonlight to help us."</p>

<p>Walking on tiptoe and as silent as so many cats, the party moved
through the hall to the front room. The straining ears heard nothing
more from below stairs, though there could be no doubt that their
visitors were still there.</p>

<p>As Mike had intimated, the round, clear moon was in the sky,
and looking from the windows it seemed almost as bright as day.
The party stood just far enough back to be invisible to anyone
in the street below. A row of elms lined each side of the highway,
being mutually separated by a dozen yards or so. They were small,
having been set out only a few years before, but were in full
foliage and the most remote ones cast a shadow into the highway.
On the same side of what was the main street, each frame house
that served for a dwelling had a yard, shrubbery and flowers in
front. Farther to the left was the small grocery store, while
to the right on the same side as the post office was the pert
little village church to which reference has already been made.</p>

<p>At this hour all Beartown seemed to be sunk in slumber, as was
quite proper should be the case. From not a single window twinkled
a light nor was man, woman or boy seen on the street. A solitary
dog, with nose down and travelling diagonally as canines sometimes
do, trotted to the front gate of the house opposite the post office,
jumped over and passed from view to the rear.</p>

<p>"I wonder what that man is waiting there for."</p>

<p>It was Nora who whispered this question, which instantly put
the others on the <em>qui vive</em>.</p>

<p>"I don't see any man; where is he?" asked Chester.</p>

<p>"Under that tree opposite; he's in plain sight."</p>

<p>Such was the fact now that she had directed attention to him.
The elm was directly across the street, and had a trunk not more
than six or eight inches in diameter. A man was standing motionless
under the dense foliage several feet above his head, doing nothing
except simply to stand there.</p>

<p>"He is the lookout," said Chester.</p>

<p>"What's a lookout?" asked the nervous Nora.</p>

<p>"He is there to watch for danger that may threaten the others
who are inside and working at your mother's safe. If he sees anything
wrong he will give a signal, probably by means of a whistle, and
the fellows below will run."</p>

<p>"Why couldn't you give the signal?"</p>

<p>"I could if I knew what it is, but I don't."</p>

<p>"Look! he is coming over here!" exclaimed the affrighted Nora,
as the man stepped from the shadow, walked half way across the
street, and then halted as if in doubt whether to advance farther.</p>

<p>"No fear of his visiting us," Alvin assured her; "but it is best
to keep out of sight."</p>

<p>All shrank still farther back, when there was no possibility
of being seen in the first place. The man did not look up, but
kept his slouch hat pulled so far down that nothing of his face
was visible. He held his position for perhaps five minutes, when
he turned about and went back to his post. There could be no doubt
that he was the lookout of the gang, as Chester had said when
he was first noticed. Not once did he look up before reaching
his place, so that none of our friends caught a glimpse of his
features.</p>

<p>What a unique situation! One or more burglars were at work on
the safe below stairs, and there were five persons on the floor
above who knew it, but did not raise voice or a hand to interfere
with them. It has been explained why, though it should be added
that in the way of firearms there was only the single worthless
Springfield rifle in the house. It was mother and daughter who
held the three lads supine. Had they been left free they would
have acted immediately on first learning of the presence of the
criminals.</p>

<p>Chester had spoken the word "dynamite," and it was that terrific
explosive which he and his companions dreaded unspeakably. If
the charge were fired, it would not only blow the massive safe
apart, but was likely to wreck the building itself and probably
inflict death to more than one in the dwelling.</p>

<p>Mike Murphy chafed more than his comrades. Reflecting on the
exasperating state of affairs, he determined to do something despite
the opposition of the mother and daughter. A few minutes' thought
suggested a plan. He would have revealed it to Alvin and Chester,
but feared they would prevent action or that his whispering in
the darkness of the room would awaken the suspicion of the other
two.</p>

<p>Only when near the front windows could the members of the party
dimly see one another. They had withdrawn so far at sight of the
approach of the man on guard that the light ill served them. Mike
stealthily retreated to the open door leading into the hall. Neither
of his comrades heard him, and he groped along the passage, with
hands outstretched on each side to guide him. The feet were lifted
and set down without noise, and by and by he came to the opening
leading to the bedroom. Across this he made his way with the same
noiseless stealth, until the groping hand touched the battered
rifle, which he lifted from its resting place. Back into the hall
again, and then through the dining room, inch by inch, to where
he remembered seeing the head of the stairs, though he knew nothing
beyond that. He would have struck a match but for fear of attracting
the notice of those below.</p>

<p>"I've only to feel each step," he reflected, "and I'll soon arrive,
and then won't fur of the spalpeens fly?"</p>

<p>His unfamiliarity with the stairs made him think they were not
so nearly perpendicular as was the fact. While the thought was
in his mind, he made a misstep and, unable to check himself, went
bumping all the way to the bottom.</p>
