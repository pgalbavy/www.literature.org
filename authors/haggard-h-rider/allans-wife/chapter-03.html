<p>I make no apology to myself, or to anybody who may happen to read this
narrative in future, for having set out the manner of my meeting with
Indaba-zimbi: first, because it was curious, and secondly, because he
takes some hand in the subsequent events. If that old man was a
humbug, he was a very clever one. What amount of truth there was in his
pretensions to supernatural powers it is not for me to determine, though
I may have my own opinion on the subject. But there was no mistake as to
the extraordinary influence he exercised over his fellow-natives. Also
he quite got round my poor father. At first the old gentleman declined
to have him at the station, for he had a great horror of these Kaffir
wizards or witch-finders. But Indaba-zimbi persuaded him that he was
anxious to investigate the truths of Christianity, and challenged him to
a discussion. The argument lasted two years--to the time of my father’s
death, indeed. At the conclusion of each stage Indaba-zimbi would
remark, in the words of the Roman Governor, “Almost, praying white man,
thou persuadest me to become a Christian,” but he never quite became
one--indeed, I do not think he ever meant to. It was to him that my
father addressed his “Letters to a Native Doubter.” This work, which,
unfortunately, remains in manuscript, is full of wise saws and learned
instances. It ought to be published together with a <u>précis</u> of the
doubter’s answers, which were verbal.
</p><p>So the talk went on. If my father had lived I believe it would be going
on now, for both the disputants were quite inexhaustible. Meanwhile
Indaba-zimbi was allowed to live on the station on condition that he
practised no witchcraft, which my father firmly believed to be a wile of
the devil. He said that he would not, but for all that there was never
an ox lost, or a sudden death, but he was consulted by those interested.
</p><p>When he had been with us a year, a deputation came to him from the tribe
he had left, asking him to return. Things had not gone well with them
since he went away, they said, and now the chief, his enemy, was
dead. Old Indaba-zimbi listened to them till they had done, and, as he
listened, raked sand into a little heap with his toes. Then he spoke,
pointing to the little heap, “There is your tribe to-day,” he said.
Then he lifted his heel and stamped the heap flat. “There is your tribe
before three moons are gone. Nothing is left of it. You drove me away: I
will have no more to do with you; but when you are being killed think of
my words.”
</p><p>The messengers went. Three months afterwards I heard that the whole
community had been wiped out by an Impi of raiding Pondos.
</p><p>When I was at length ready to start upon my expedition, I went to old
Indaba-zimbi to say good-bye to him, and was rather surprised to find
him engaged in rolling up medicine, assegais, and other sundries in his
blankets.
</p><p>“Good-bye, Indaba-zimbi,” I said, “I am going to trek north.”
</p><p>“Yes, Macumazahn,” he answered, with his head on one side; “and so am
I--I want to see that country. We will go together.”
</p><p>“Will we!” I said; “wait till you are asked, you old humbug.”
</p><p>“You had better ask me, then, Macumazahn, for if you don’t you will
never come back alive. Now that the old chief (my father) is gone to
where the storms come from,” and he nodded to the sky, “I feel myself
getting into bad habits again. So last night I just threw up the bones
and worked out about your journey, and I can tell you this, that if you
don’t take me you will die, and, what is more, you will lose one who is
dearer to you than life in a strange fashion. So just because you gave
me that hint a couple of years ago, I made up my mind to come with you.”
</p><p>“Don’t talk stuff to me,” I said.
</p><p>“Ah, very well, Macumazahn, very well; but what happened to my own
people six months ago, and what did I tell the messengers would happen?
They drove me away, and they are gone. If you drive me away you will
soon be gone too,” and he nodded his white lock at me and smiled. Now
I was not more superstitious than other people, but somehow old
Indaba-zimbi impressed me. Also I knew his extraordinary influence over
every class of native, and bethought me that he might be useful in that
way.
</p><p>“All right,” I said: “I appoint you witch-finder to the expedition
without pay.”
</p><p>“First serve, then ask for wages,” he answered. “I am glad to see that
you have enough imagination not to be altogether a fool, like most white
men, Macumazahn. Yes, yes, it is want of imagination that makes
people fools; they won’t believe what they can’t understand. You can’t
understand my prophecies any more than the fool at the kraal could
understand that I was his master with the lightning. Well, it is time to
trek, but if I were you, Macumazahn, I should take one waggon, not two.”
</p><p>“Why?” I said.
</p><p>“Because you will lose your waggons, and it is better to lose one than
two.”
</p><p>“Oh, nonsense!” I said.
</p><p>“All right, Macumazahn, live and learn.” And without another word he
walked to the foremost waggon, put his bundle into it, and climbed on to
the front seat.
</p><p>So having bid an affectionate adieu to my white friends, including the
old Scotchman who got drunk in honour of the event, and quoted Burns
till the tears ran down his face, at length I started, and travelled
slowly northwards. For the first three weeks nothing very particular
befell me. Such Kaffirs as we came in contact with were friendly, and
game literally swarmed. Nobody living in those parts of South Africa
nowadays can have the remotest idea of what the veldt was like even
thirty years ago.
</p><p>Often and often I have crept shivering on to my waggon-box just as the
sun rose and looked out. At first one would see nothing but a vast field
of white mist suffused towards the east by a tremulous golden glow,
through which the tops of stony koppies stood up like gigantic beacons.
From the dense mist would come strange sounds--snorts, gruntings,
bellows, and the thunder of countless hoofs. Presently this great
curtain would grow thinner, then it would melt, as the smoke from a
pipe melts into the air, and for miles on miles the wide rolling country
interspersed with bush opened to the view. But it was not tenantless as
it is now, for as far as the eye could reach it would be literally black
with game. Here to the right might be a herd of vilderbeeste that could
not number less than two thousand. Some were grazing, some gambolled,
whisking their white tails into the air, while all round the old bulls
stood upon hillocks sniffing suspiciously at the breeze. There, in
front, a hundred yards away, though to the unpractised eye they looked
much closer, because of the dazzling clearness of the atmosphere, was
a great herd of springbok trekking along in single file. Ah, they have
come to the waggon-track and do not like the look of it. What will they
do?--go back? Not a bit of it. It is nearly thirty feet wide, but that
is nothing to a springbok. See, the first of them bounds into the air
like a ball. How beautifully the sunshine gleams upon his golden
hide! He has cleared it, and the others come after him in numberless
succession, all except the fawns, who cannot jump so far, and have to
scamper over the doubtful path with a terrified <u>bah</u>. What is that
yonder, moving above the tops of the mimosa, in the little dell at the
foot of the koppie? Giraffes, by George! three of them; there will be
marrow-bones for supper to-night. Hark! the ground shakes behind us, and
over the brow of the rise rush a vast herd of blesbock. On they come at
full gallop, their long heads held low, they look like so many bearded
goats. I thought so--behind them is a pack of wild dogs, their fur
draggled, their tongues lolling. They are in full cry; the giraffes hear
them and are away, rolling round the koppie like a ship in a heavy sea.
No marrow-bones after all. See! the foremost dogs are close on a buck.
He has galloped far and is outworn. One springs at his flank and misses
him. The buck gives a kind of groan, looks wildly round and sees the
waggon. He seems to hesitate a moment, then in his despair rushes up
to it, and falls exhausted among the oxen. The dogs pull up some thirty
paces away, panting and snarling. Now, boy, the gun--no, not the rifle,
the shot-gun loaded with loopers.
</p><p>Bang! bang! there, my friends, two of you will never hunt buck again.
No, don’t touch the buck, for he has come to us for shelter, and he
shall have it.
</p><p>Ah, how beautiful is nature before man comes to spoil it!
</p><p>Such a sight as this have I seen many a hundred times, and I hope to see
it again before I die.
</p><p>The first real adventure that befell me on this particular journey was
with elephants, which I will relate because of its curious termination.
Just before we crossed the Orange River we came to a stretch of
forest-land some twenty miles broad. The night we entered this forest
we camped in a lovely open glade. A few yards ahead tambouki grass was
growing to the height of a man, or rather it had been; now, with the
exception of a few stalks here and there, it was crushed quite flat. It
was already dusk when we camped; but after the moon got up I walked from
the fire to see how this had happened. One glance was enough for me;
a great herd of elephants had evidently passed over the tall grass not
many hours before. The sight of their spoor rejoiced me exceedingly,
for though I had seen wild elephants, at that time I had never shot
one. Moreover, the sight of elephant spoor to the African hunter is what
“colour in the pan” is to the prospector of gold. It is by the ivory
that he lives, and to shoot it or trade it is his chief aim in life. My
resolution was soon taken. I would camp the waggons for a while in the
forest, and start on horseback after the elephants.
</p><p>I communicated my decision to Indaba-zimbi and the other Kaffirs. The
latter were not loth, for your Kaffir loves hunting, which means plenty
of meat and congenial occupation, but Indaba-zimbi would express no
opinion. I saw him retire to a little fire that he had lit for himself,
and go through some mysterious performances with bones and clay mixed
with ashes, which were watched with the greatest interest by the other
Kaffirs. At length he rose, and, coming forward, informed me that it was
all right, and that I did well to go and hunt the elephants, as I should
get plenty of ivory; but he advised me to go on foot. I said I should
do nothing of the sort, but meant to ride. I am wiser now; this was
the first and last time that I ever attempted to hunt elephants on
horseback.
</p><p>Accordingly we started at dawn, I, Indaba-zimbi, and three men; the rest
I left with the waggons. I was on horseback, and so was my driver, a
good rider and a skilful shot for a Kaffir, but Indaba-zimbi and the
others walked. From dawn till mid-day we followed the trail of the herd,
which was as plain as a high road. Then we off-saddled to let the horses
rest and feed, and about three o’clock started on again. Another hour or
so passed, and still there was no sign of elephants. Evidently the herd
had travelled fast and far, and I began to think that we should have to
give it up, when suddenly I caught sight of a brown mass moving through
the thorn-trees on the side of a slope about a quarter of a mile away.
My heart seemed to jump into my mouth. Where is the hunter who has not
felt like this at the sight of his first elephant?
</p><p>I called a halt, and then the wind being right, we set to work to stalk
the bull. Very quietly I rode down the hither side of the slope till we
came to the bottom, which was densely covered with bush. Here I saw the
elephants had been feeding, for broken branches and upturned trees lay
all about. I did not take much notice, however, for all my thoughts
were fixed upon the bull I was stalking, when suddenly my horse gave
a violent start that nearly threw me from the saddle, and there came a
mighty rush and upheaval of something in front of me. I looked: there
was the hinder part of a second bull elephant not four yards off. I
could just catch sight of its outstretched ears projecting on either
side. I had disturbed it sleeping, and it was running away.
</p><p>Obviously the best thing to do would have been to let it run, but I was
young in those days and foolish, and in the excitement of the moment I
lifted my “roer” or elephant gun and fired at the great brute over my
horse’s head. The recoil of the heavy gun nearly knocked me off the
horse. I recovered myself, however, and, as I did so, saw the bull
lurch forward, for the impact of a three-ounce bullet in the flank will
quicken the movement even of an elephant. By this time I had realized
the folly of the shot, and devoutly hoped that the bull would take
no further notice of it. But he took a different view of the matter.
Pulling himself up in a series of plunges, he spun round and came for
me with outstretched ears and uplifted trunk, screaming terribly. I was
quite defenceless, for my gun was empty, and my first thought was of
escape. I dug my heels into the sides of my horse, but he would not move
an inch. The poor animal was paralyzed with terror, and he simply stood
still, his fore-legs outstretched, and quivering all over like a leaf.
</p><p>On rushed the elephant, awful to see; I made one more vain effort to
stir the horse. Now the trunk of the great bull swung aloft above my
head. A thought flashed through my brain. Quick as light I rolled from
the saddle. By the side of the horse lay a fallen tree, as thick through
as a man’s body. The tree was lifted a little off the ground by the
broken boughs which took its weight, and with a single movement, so
active is one in such necessities, I flung myself beneath it. As I did
so, I heard the trunk of the elephant descend with a mighty thud on the
back of my poor horse, and the next instant I was almost in darkness,
for the horse, whose back was broken, fell over across the tree under
which I lay ensconced. But he did not stop there long. In ten seconds
more the bull had wound his trunk about my dead nag’s neck, and, with a
mighty effort, hurled him clear of the tree. I wriggled backwards as far
as I could towards the roots of the tree, for I knew what he was after.
Presently I saw the red tip of the bull’s trunk stretching itself
towards me. If he could manage to hook it round any part of me I was
lost. But in the position I occupied, that was just what he could not
do, although he knelt down to facilitate his operations. On came the
snapping tip like a great open-mouthed snake; it closed upon my hat,
which vanished. Again it was thrust down, and a scream of rage was
bellowed through it within four inches of my head. Now it seemed to
elongate itself. Oh, heavens! now it had me by the hair, which, luckily
for myself, was not very long. Then it was my turn to scream, for next
instant half a square inch of hair was dragged from my scalp by the
roots. I was being plucked alive, as I have seen cruel Kaffir kitchen
boys pluck a fowl.
</p><p>The elephant, however, disappointed with these moderate results, changed
his tactics. He wound his trunk round the fallen tree and lifted. The
tree stirred, but fortunately the broken branches embedded in the spongy
soil, and some roots, which still held, prevented it from being turned
over, though he lifted it so much that, had it occurred to him, he could
now easily have drawn me out with his trunk. Again he hoisted with all
his mighty strength, and I saw that the tree was coming, and roared
aloud for help. Some shots were fired close by in answer, but if they
hit the bull, their only effect was to stir his energies to more active
life. In another few seconds my shelter would be torn away, and I should
be done for. A cold perspiration burst out over me as I realized that I
was lost. Then of a sudden I remembered that I had a pistol in my belt,
which I often used for despatching wounded game. It was loaded and
capped. By this time the tree was lifted so much that I could easily get
my hand down to my middle and draw the pistol from its case. I drew and
cocked it. Now the tree was coming over, and there, within three feet of
my head, was the great brown trunk of the elephant. I placed the
muzzle of the pistol within an inch of it and fired. The result was
instantaneous. Down sunk the tree again, giving one of my legs a
considerable squeeze, and next instant I heard a crashing sound. The
elephant had bolted.
</p><p>By this time, what between fright and struggling, I was pretty well
tired. I cannot remember how I got from under the fallen tree, or indeed
anything, until I found myself sitting on the ground drinking some peach
brandy from a flask, and old Indaba-zimbi opposite to me nodding
his white lock sagely, while he fired off moral reflections on the
narrowness of my escape, and my unwisdom in not having taken his advice
to go on foot. That reminded me of my horse--I got up and went to look
at it. It was quite dead, the blow of the elephant’s trunk had fallen
on the saddle, breaking the framework, and rendering it useless. I
reflected that in another two seconds it would have fallen on <u>me</u>. Then
I called to Indaba-zimbi and asked which way the elephants had gone.
</p><p>“There!” he said, pointing down the gully, “and we had better go after
them, Macumazahn. We have had the bad luck, now for the good.”
</p><p>There was philosophy in this, though, to tell the truth, I did not feel
particularly sharp set on elephants at the moment. I seemed to have had
enough of them. However, it would never do to show the white feather
before the boys, so I assented with much outward readiness, and we
started, I on the second horse, and the others on foot. When we had
travelled for the best part of an hour down the valley, all of a sudden
we came upon the whole herd, which numbered a little more than eighty.
Just in front of them the bush was so thick that they seemed to hesitate
about entering it, and the sides of the valley were so rocky and steep
at this point that they could not climb them.
</p><p>They saw us at the same moment as we saw them, and inwardly I was filled
with fears lest they should take it into their heads to charge back up
the gully. But they did not; trumpeting aloud, they rushed at the thick
bush which went down before them like corn before a sickle. I do not
think that in all my experiences I ever heard anything to equal the
sound they made as they crashed through and over the shrubs and trees.
Before them was a dense forest belt from a hundred to a hundred and
fifty feet in width. As they rushed on, it fell, so that behind them
was nothing but a level roadway strewed with fallen trunks, crushed
branches, and here and there a tree, too strong even for them, left
stranded amid the wreck. On they went, and, notwithstanding the nature
of the ground over which they had to travel, they kept their distance
ahead of us. This sort of thing continued for a mile or more, and then
I saw that in front of the elephants the valley opened into a space
covered with reeds and grass--it might have been five or six acres in
extent--beyond which the valley ran on again.
</p><p>The herd reached the edge of this expanse, and for a moment pulled up,
hesitating--evidently they mistrusted it. My men yelled aloud, as only
Kaffirs can, and that settled them. Headed by the wounded bull, whose
martial ardour, like my own, was somewhat cooled, they spread out and
dashed into the treacherous swamp--for such it was, though just then
there was no water to be seen. For a few yards all went well with them,
though they clearly found it heavy going; then suddenly the great bull
sank up to his belly in the stiff peaty soil, and remained fixed. The
others, mad with fear, took no heed of his struggles and trumpetings,
but plunged on to meet the same fate. In five minutes the whole herd of
them were hopelessly bogged, and the more they struggled to escape, the
deeper they sunk. There was one exception, indeed, a cow managed to win
back to firm shore, and, lifting her trunk, prepared to charge us as we
came up. But at that moment she heard the scream of her calf, and rushed
back to its assistance, only to be bogged with the others.
</p><p>Such a scene I never saw before or since. The swamp was spotted all
over with the large forms of the elephants, and the air rang with their
screams of rage and terror as they waved their trunks wildly to and fro.
Now and then a monster would make a great effort and drag his mass from
its peaty bed, only to stick fast again at the next step. It was a most
pitiable sight, though one that gladdened the hearts of my men. Even the
best natives have little compassion for the sufferings of animals.
</p><p>Well, the rest was easy. The marsh that would not bear the elephants
carried our weight well enough. Before midnight all were dead, for we
shot them by moonlight. I would gladly have spared the young ones and
some of the cows, but to do so would only have meant leaving them to
perish of hunger; it was kinder to kill them at once. The wounded bull I
slew with my own hand, and I cannot say that I felt much compunction in
so doing. He knew me again, and made a desperate effort to get at me,
but I am glad to say that the peat held him fast.
</p><p>The pan presented a curious sight when the sun rose next morning. Owing
to the support given by the soil, few of the dead elephants had fallen:
there they stood as though they were asleep.
</p><p>I sent back for the waggons, and when they arrived on the morrow, formed
a camp, about a mile away from the pan. Then began the work of cutting
out the elephants’ tusks; it took over a week, and for obvious reasons
was a disgusting task. Indeed, had it not been for the help of some
wandering bushmen, who took their pay in elephant meat, I do not think
we could ever have managed it.
</p><p>At last it was done. The ivory was far too cumbersome for us to carry,
so we buried it, having first got rid of our bushmen allies. My boys
wanted me to go back to the Cape with it and sell it, but I was too much
bent on my journey to do this. The tusks lay buried for five years. Then
I came and dug them up; they were but little harmed. Ultimately I sold
the ivory for something over twelve hundred pounds--not bad pay for one
day’s shooting.
</p><p>This was how I began my career as an elephant hunter. I have shot many
hundreds of them since, but have never again attempted to do so on
horseback.
