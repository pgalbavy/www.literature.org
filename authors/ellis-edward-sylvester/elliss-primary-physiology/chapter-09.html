<p>Many persons are drowned every month, and almost every day. Hundreds
doubtless could be saved by a knowledge of the art of swimming,
while others could have been revived, had the proper means been
used.</p>

<p>When any one believes he is drowning, he becomes frantic and
his fierce struggles only hasten his death. If a friend swims
to his rescue, there is danger that he will throw his arms around
his rescuer and cause both to drown.</p>

<p>[Illustration:</p>

<p>  <em>GOING TO THE RESCUE</em>.]</p>

<p>If the person in danger will keep still, when his friend seizes
his hair or arm, he can readily be taken ashore. If a swimmer
finds his sinking friend frantic, it may be necessary to strike
him a violent blow between the eyes so as to stun him for a minute
or two.</p>

<p>A drowning person generally rises twice before sinking the last
time. Those who have been unconscious ten, fifteen, twenty minutes
and sometimes longer, have been resuscitated or brought back to
life. What is done, therefore, must be done without delay. Should
you be present when a drowned person is taken from the water,
you ought to know exactly what to do.</p>

<p>If any one can be spared to go for the doctor, let him run with
all speed. The instant the body is brought to land, turn it upon
the face, with a hard roll of clothing under the pit of the stomach.
This roll can be readily made from your own clothing or that of
others if present. Put one wrist of the patient under his forehead
so as to keep his mouth off the ground.</p>

<p>[Illustration]</p>

<p>Then, with your hands well spread upon the patient's back, above
the roll of clothing, press down with the whole weight of your
body, pushing forward at the same time. Repeat this two or three
times, with quickness and vigor. The object of the movement is
to force the water from the lungs, and it must occupy very little
time, for there is none to throw away.</p>

<p>[Illustration]</p>

<p>Having freed the lungs so far as possible from water, turn the
patient on his back, face upward, with the hard roll of clothing
beneath his back. Bend the head backward and downward, so that
the throat is stretched to the utmost. Place his hands on top
of his head, and, if there be any one standing near, let him tie
the wrists with a single twist of the handkerchief.</p>

<p>All the clothing must be instantly stripped off to the waist.
Kneel astride the patient's hips; grasp the front part of the
chest on both sides of the pit of the stomach, your thumbs pointing
to the patient's chin and your fingers fitting into the grooves
between the short ribs.</p>

<p>Brace your elbows firmly, making them rigid with your sides and
hips, while your knees serve as a pivot. Press the sides of the
patient firmly together, throwing yourself slowly forward for
a second or two until your face almost touches his and your whole
weight presses upon his chest. End this pressure with a sudden
short push, which will send you back to the kneeling posture.</p>

<p>Stop for two or three seconds, so as to allow the ribs to spring
back into position. Then repeat this bellows-blowing movement
as before, gradually increasing the rate from seven to ten times
a minute. Watch closely, and if you detect a natural gasp, do
not interrupt it, but as the ribs sink, gently press them and
deepen the gasp into a long breath. Continue to give this help,
until the natural breathing is fully resumed, but do not cease
your efforts for fully an hour or longer.</p>

<p>Avoid impatient vertical pushes; the force must be upward and
inward. If a second person is present, he should pull the end
of the tongue of the patient out of a corner of his mouth and
hold it there, using his handkerchief or piece of cotton rag.
This helps to give the air free passage to and from the lungs.</p>

<p>  What causes a great many deaths from drowning?</p>

<p>  How does a person act when he believes he is drowning? What
is he   likely to do if a friend swims to his rescue?</p>

<p>  What may be done if the drowning person keeps still? What,
if he   becomes frantic?</p>

<p>  How often does a drowning person generally rise? How long after  
drowning has a person been resuscitated or brought back to life?</p>

<p>  What about the doctor? Now, describe very carefully the first
step   to be taken the instant a drowned person is brought to
land. What   should be done with his wrist?</p>

<p>  What next should be done? In what manner and how often should
this   be done? What is the object of the movement?</p>

<p>  After freeing the lungs, so far as possible, from water, what
is the   next step? What should be done with his hands?</p>

<p>  What of the patient's clothing? What next should be done?</p>

<p>  Having placed yourself astride the patient's hips, describe
what   should be done next.</p>

<p>  What are the next steps? What should be done if a natural gasp
is   detected? How long should you continue your efforts to restore
the   patient to life?</p>

<p>  What should be avoided? What should be done by a spectator,
if there   be one?</p>

<p>  Now tell me precisely what to do from the moment a drowned
person is   taken out of the water until he is resuscitated or
it is proven he   is beyond help. (The teacher must insist on
an answer, correct in   every particular, for it is evident that
unless he knows every step,   the pupil's knowledge is useless.) </p>
