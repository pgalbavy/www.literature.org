<P>
Dropping to the ground once more he picked up the trail
of the girl and her captors, which he followed easily
along what appeared to be a well-beaten trail. It was
not long before he came to a small stream, where he quenched
his thirst, and thereafter he saw that the trail followed in the
general direction of the stream, which ran southwesterly. Here
and there were cross trails and others which joined the main
avenue, and always upon each of them were the tracks and
scent of the great cats, of Numa, the lion, and Sheeta, the
panther.
<P>
With the exception of a few small rodents there appeared to
be no other wild life on the surface of the valley. There was no
indication of Bara, the deer, or Horta, the boar, or of Gorgo,
the buffalo, Buto, Tantor, or Duro. Histah, the snake, was
there. He saw him in the trees in greater numbers than he ever
had seen Histah before; and once beside a reedy pool he
caught a scent that could have belonged to none other than
Gimla the crocodile, but upon none of these did the Tar-
mangani care to feed.
<P>
And so, as he craved meat, he turned his attention to the
birds above him. His assailants of the night before had not
disarmed him. Either in the darkness and the rush of the
charging lions the human foe had overlooked him or else they
had considered him dead; but whatever the reason he still
retained his weapons -- his spear and his long knife, his bow
and arrows, and his grass rope.
<P>
Fitting a shaft to his bow Tarzan awaited an opportunity to
bring down one of the larger birds, and when the opportunity
finally presented itself he drove the arrow straight to its mark.
As the gaily plumaged creature fluttered to earth its compan-
ions and the little monkeys set up a most terrific chorus of
wails and screaming protests. The whole forest became
suddenly a babel of hoarse screams and shrill shrieks.
<P>
Tarzan would not have been surprised had one or two birds
in the immediate vicinity given voice to terror as they fled, but
that the whole life of the jungle should set up so weird a pro-
test filled him with disgust. It was an angry face that he turned
up toward the monkeys and the birds as there suddenly stirred
within him a savage inclination to voice his displeasure and
his answer to what he considered their challenge. And so it
was that there broke upon this jungle for the first time Tarzan's
hideous scream of victory and challenge.
<P>
The effect upon the creatures above him was instantaneous.
Where before the air had trembled to the din of their voices,
now utter silence reigned and a moment later the ape-man was
alone with his puny kill.
<P>
The silence following so closely the previous tumult carried
a sinister impression to the ape-man, which still further
aroused his anger. Picking the bird from where it had fallen
he withdrew his arrow from the body and returned it to his
quiver. Then with his knife he quickly and deftly removed the
skin and feathers together. He ate angrily, growling as though
actually menaced by a near-by foe, and perhaps, too, his
growls were partially induced by the fact that he did not care
for the flesh of birds. Better this, however, than nothing and
from what his senses had told him there was no flesh in the
vicinity such as he was accustomed to and cared most for.
How he would have enjoyed a juicy haunch from Pacco, the
zebra, or a steak from the loin of Gorgo, the buffalo! The very
thought made his mouth water and increased his resentment
against this unnatural forest that harbored no such delicious
quarry.
<P>
He had but partially consumed his kill when he suddenly
became aware of a movement in the brush at no great distance
from him and downwind, and a moment later his nostrils
picked up the scent of Numa from the opposite direction, and
then upon either side he caught the fall of padded feet and the
brushing of bodies against leafy branches. The ape-man
smiled. What stupid creature did they think him, to be sur-
prised by such clumsy stalkers? Gradually the sounds and
scents indicated that lions were moving upon him from all
directions, that he was in the center of a steadily converging
circle of beasts. Evidently they were so sure of their prey that
they were making no effort toward stealth, for he heard twigs
crack beneath their feet, and the brushing of their bodies
against the vegetation through which they forced their way.
<P>
He wondered what could have brought them. It seemed
unreasonable to believe that the cries of the birds and the
monkeys should have summoned them, and yet, if not, it was
indeed a remarkable coincidence. His judgment told him that
the death of a single bird in this forest which teemed with
birds could scarce be of sufficient moment to warrant that
which followed. Yet even in the face of reason and past experi-
ence he found that the whole affair perplexed him.
<P>
He stood in the center of the trail awaiting the coming of
the lions and wondering what would be the method of their
attack or if they would indeed attack. Presently a maned lion
came into view along the trail below him. At sight of him the
lion halted. The beast was similar to those that had attacked
him earlier in the day, a trifle larger and a trifle darker than
the
lions of his native jungles, but neither so large nor so black as
Numa of the pit.
<P>
Presently he distinguished the outlines of other lions in the
surrounding brush and among the trees. Each of them halted
as it came within sight of the ape-man and there they stood
regarding him in silence. Tarzan wondered how long it would
be before they charged and while he waited he resumed his
feeding, though with every sense constantly alert.
<P>
One by one the lions lay down, but always their faces were
toward him and their eyes upon him. There had been no
growling and no roaring -- just the quiet drawing of the silent
circle about him. It was all so entirely foreign to anything that
Tarzan ever before had seen lions do that it irritated him so
that presently, having finished his repast, he fell to making
insulting remarks to first one and then another of the lions,
after the habit he had learned from the apes of his childhood.
<P>
"Dango, eater of carrion," he called them, and he compared
them most unfavorably with Histah, the snake, the most
loathed and repulsive creature of the jungle. Finally he threw
handfuls of earth at them and bits of broken twigs, and then
the lions growled and bared their fangs, but none of them
advanced.
<P>
"Cowards," Tarzan taunted them. "Numa with a heart of
Bara, the deer." He told them who he was, and after the
manner of the jungle folk he boasted as to the horrible things
he would do to them, but the lions only lay and watched him.
<P>
It must have been a half hour after their coming that Tar-
zan caught in the distance along the trail the sound of foot-
steps approaching. They were the footsteps of a creature who
walked upon two legs, and though Tarzan could catch no
scent spoor from that direction he knew that a man was
approaching. Nor had he long to wait before his judgment
was confirmed by the appearance of a man who halted in the
trail directly behind the first lion that Tarzan had seen.
<P>
At sight of the newcomer the ape-man realized that here
was one similar to those who had given off the unfamiliar
scent spoor that he had detected the previous night, and he
saw that not only in the matter of scent did the man differ
from other human beings with whom Tarzan was familiar.
<P>
The fellow was strongly built with skin of a leathery ap-
pearance, like parchment yellowed with age. His hair, which
was coal black and three or four inches in length, grew out
stiffly at right angles to his scalp. His eyes were close set and
the irises densely black and very small, so that the white of
the eyeball showed around them. The man's face was smooth
except for a few straggly hairs on his chin and upper lip.
The nose was aquiline and fine, but the hair grew so far down
on the forehead as to suggest a very low and brutal type.
The upper lip was short and fine while the lower lip was
rather heavy and inclined to be pendulous, the chin being
equally weak. Altogether the face carried the suggestion of
a once strong and handsome countenance entirely altered by
physical violence or by degraded habits and thoughts. The
man's arms were long, though not abnormally so, while his
legs were short, though straight.
<P>
He was clothed in tight-fitting nether garments and a loose,
sleeveless tunic that fell just below his hips, while his feet
were shod in soft-soled sandals, the wrappings of which ex-
tended halfway to his knees, closely resembling a modern
spiral military legging. He carried a short, heavy spear, and
at his side swung a weapon that at first so astonished the ape-
man that he could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses
-- a heavy saber in a leather-covered scabbard. The man's
tunic appeared to have been fabricated upon a loom -- it was
certainly not made of skins, while the garments that covered
his legs were quite as evidently made from the hides of
rodents.
<P>
Tarzan noted the utter unconcern with which the man
approached the lions, and the equal indifference of Numa to
him. The fellow paused for a moment as though appraising
the ape-man and then pushed on past the lions, brushing
against the tawny hide as he passed him in the trail.
<P>
About twenty feet from Tarzan the man stopped, addressing
the former in a strange jargon, no syllable of which was
intelligible to the Tarmangani. His gestures indicated numer-
ous references to the lions surrounding them, and once he
touched his spear with the forefinger of his left hand and
twice he struck the saber at his hip.
<P>
While he spoke Tarzan studied the fellow closely, with the
result that there fastened itself upon his mind a strange con-
viction -- that the man who addressed him was what might
only be described as a rational maniac. As the thought came
to the ape-man he could not but smile, so paradoxical the
description seemed. Yet a closer study of the man's features,
carriage, and the contour of his head carried almost incon-
trovertibly the assurance that he was insane, while the tones
of his voice and his gestures resembled those of a sane and
intelligent mortal.
<P>
Presently the man had concluded his speech and appeared
to be waiting questioningly Tarzan's reply. The ape-man
spoke to the other first in the language of the great apes, but
he soon saw that the words carried no conviction to his
listener. Then with equal futility he tried several native
dialects but to none of these did the man respond.
<P>
By this time Tarzan began to lose patience. He had wasted
sufficient time by the road, and as he had never depended
much upon speech in the accomplishment of his ends, he now
raised his spear and advanced toward the other. This, evi-
dently, was a language common to both, for instantly the
fellow raised his own weapon and at the same time a low
call broke from his lips, a call which instantly brought to
action every lion in the hitherto silent circle. A volley of
roars shattered the silence of the forest and simultaneously
lions sprang into view upon all sides as they closed in rapidly
upon their quarry. The man who had called them stepped
back, his teeth bared in a mirthless grin.
<P>
It was then that Tarzan first noticed that the fellow's upper
canines were unusually long and exceedingly sharp. It was
just a flashing glimpse he got of them as he leaped agilely
from the ground and, to the consternation of both the lions
and their master, disappeared in the foliage of the lower
terrace, flinging back over his shoulder as he swung rapidly
away: "I am Tarzan of the Apes; mighty hunter; mighty
fighter! None in the jungle more powerful, none more cun-
ning than Tarzan!"
<P>
A short distance beyond the point at which they had sur-
rounded him, Tarzan came to the trail again and sought for
the spoor of Bertha Kircher and Lieutenant Smith-Oldwick.
He found them quickly and continued upon his search for the
two. The spoor lay directly along the trail for another half-
mile when the way suddenly debouched from the forest into
open land and there broke upon the astonished view of the
ape-man the domes and minarets of a walled city.
<P>
Directly before him in the wall nearest him Tarzan saw a
low-arched gateway to which a well-beaten trail led from
that which he had been following. In the open space between
the forest and the city walls, quantities of garden stuff was
growing, while before him at his feet, in an open man-made
ditch, ran a stream of water! The plants in the garden were
laid out in well-spaced, symmetrical rows and appeared to
have been given excellent attention and cultivation. Tiny
streams were trickling between the rows from the main ditch
before him and at some distance to his right he could see
people at work among the plants.
<P>
The city wall appeared to be about thirty feet in height,
its plastered expanse unbroken except by occasional em-
brasures. Beyond the wall rose the domes of several struc-
tures and numerous minarets dotted the sky line of the city.
The largest and central dome appeared to be gilded, while
others were red, or blue, or yellow. The architecture of the
wall itself was of uncompromising simplicity. It was of a
cream shade and appeared to be plastered and painted. At
its base was a line of well-tended shrubs and at some distance
towards its eastern extremity it was vine covered to the top.
<P>
As he stood in the shadow of the trail, his keen eyes taking
in every detail of the picture before him, he became aware of
the approach of a party in his rear and there was borne to
him the scent of the man and the lions whom he had so
readily escaped. Taking to the trees Tarzan moved a short
distance to the west and, finding a comfortable crotch at the
edge of the forest where he could watch the trail leading
through the gardens to the city gate, he awaited the return of
his would-be captors. And soon they came -- the strange man
followed by the pack of great lions. Like dogs they moved
along behind him down the trail among the gardens to the
gate.
<P>
Here the man struck upon the panels of the door with the
butt of his spear, and when it opened in response to his signal
he passed in with his lions. Beyond the open door Tarzan,
from his distant perch, caught but a fleeting glimpse of life
within the city, just enough to indicate that there were other
human creatures who abode there, and then the door closed.
<P>
Through that door he knew that the girl and the man whom
he sought to succor had been taken into the city. What fate
lay in store for them or whether already it had been meted
out to them he could not even guess, nor where, within that
forbidding wall, they were incarcerated he could not know.
But of one thing he was assured: that if he were to aid them
he could not do it from outside the wall. He must gain
entrance to the city first, nor did he doubt, that once within,
his keen senses would eventually reveal the whereabouts of
those whom he sought.
<P>
The low sun was casting long shadows across the gardens
when Tarzan saw the workers returning from the eastern field.
A man came first, and as he came he lowered little gates along
the large ditch of running water, shutting off the streams that
had run between the rows of growing plants; and behind him
came other men carrying burdens of fresh vegetables in great
woven baskets upon their shoulders. Tarzan had not realized
that there had been so many men working in the field, but
now as he sat there at the close of the day he saw a procession
filing in from the east, bearing the tools and the produce back
into the city.
<P>
And then, to gain a better view, the ape-man ascended to
the topmost branches of a tall tree where he overlooked the
nearer wall. From this point of vantage he saw that the city
was long and narrow, and that while the outer walls formed
a perfect rectangle, the streets within were winding. Toward
the center of the city there appeared to be a low, white
building around which the larger edifices of the city had been
built, and here, in the fast-waning light, Tarzan thought that
between two buildings he caught the glint of water, but of
that he was not sure. His experience of the centers of civiliza-
tion naturally inclined him to believe that this central area
was a plaza about which the larger buildings were grouped
and that there would be the most logical place to search first
for Bertha Kircher and her companion.
<P>
And then the sun went down and darkness quickly en-
veloped the city -- a darkness that was accentuated for the
ape-man rather than relieved by the artificial lights which
immediately appeared in many of the windows visible to him.
<P>
Tarzan had noticed that the roofs of most of the buildings
were flat, the few exceptions being those of what he imagined
to be the more pretentious public structures. How this city
had come to exist in this forgotten part of unexplored Africa
the ape-man could not conceive. Better than another, he
realized something of the unsolved secrets of the Great Dark
Continent, enormous areas of which have as yet been un-
touched by the foot of civilized man. Yet he could scarce
believe that a city of this size and apparently thus well con-
structed could have existed for the generations that it must
have been there, without intercourse with the outer world.
Even though it was surrounded by a trackless desert waste, as
he knew it to be, he could not conceive that generation after
generation of men could be born and die there without at-
tempting to solve the mysteries of the world beyond the
confines of their little valley.
<P>
And yet, here was the city surrounded by tilled land and
filled with people!
<P>
With the coming of night there arose throughout the jungle
the cries of the great cats, the voice of Numa blended with
that of Sheeta, and the thunderous roars of the great males
reverberated through the forest until the earth trembled, and
from within the city came the answering roars of other lions.
<P>
A simple plan for gaining entrance to the city had occurred
to Tarzan, and now that darkness had fallen he set about to
put it into effect. Its success hinged entirely upon the strength
of the vines he had seen surmounting the wall toward the
east. In this direction he made his way, while from out of
the forest about him the cries of the flesh-eaters increased in
volume and ferocity. A quarter of a mile intervened between
the forest and the city wall -- a quarter of a mile of cultivated
land unrelieved by a single tree. Tarzan of the Apes realized
his limitations and so he knew that it would undoubtedly
spell death for him to be caught in the open space by one of
the great black lions of the forest if, as he had already sur-
mised, Numa of the pit was a specimen of the forest lion of the
valley.
<P>
He must, therefore, depend entirely upon his cunning and
his speed, and upon the chance that the vine would sustain
his weight.
<P>
He moved through the middle terrace, where the way is
always easiest, until he reached a point opposite the vine-clad
portion of the wall, and there he waited, listening and scenting,
until he might assure himself that there was no Numa within
his immediate vicinity, or, at least, none that sought him. And
when he was quite sure that there was no lion close by in the
forest, and none in the clearing between himself and the wall,
he dropped lightly to the ground and moved stealthily out into
the open.
<P>
The rising moon, just topping the eastern cliffs, cast its
bright rays upon the long stretch of open garden beneath the
wall. And, too, it picked out in clear relief for any curious
eyes that chanced to be cast in that direction, the figure of the
giant ape-man moving across the clearing. It was only chance,
of course, that a great lion hunting at the edge of the forest
saw the figure of the man halfway between the forest and the
wall. Suddenly there broke upon Tarzan's ears a menacing
sound. It was not the roar of a hungry lion, but the roar of
a lion in rage, and, as he glanced back in the direction from
which the sound came, he saw a huge beast moving out from
the shadow of the forest toward him.
<P>
Even in the moonlight and at a distance Tarzan saw that
the lion was huge; that it was indeed another of the black-
maned monsters similar to Numa of the pit. For an instant
he was impelled to turn and fight, but at the same time the
thought of the helpless girl imprisoned in the city flashed
through his brain and, without an instant's hesitation, Tarzan
of the Apes wheeled and ran for the wall. Then it was that
Numa charged.
<P>
Numa, the lion, can run swiftly for a short distance, but he
lacks endurance. For the period of an ordinary charge he
can cover the ground with greater rapidity possibly than any
other creature in the world. Tarzan, on the other hand, could
run at great speed for long distances, though never as rapidly
as Numa when the latter charged.
<P>
The question of his fate, then, rested upon whether, with
his start he could elude Numa for a few seconds; and, if so,
if the lion would then have sufficient stamina remaining to
pursue him at a reduced gait for the balance of the distance
to the wall.
<P>
Never before, perhaps, was staged a more thrilling race,
and yet it was run with only the moon and stars to see. Alone
and in silence the two beasts sped across the moonlit clearing.
Numa gained with appalling rapidity upon the fleeing man,
yet at every bound Tarzan was nearer to the vine-clad wall.
Once the ape-man glanced back. Numa was so close upon
him that it seemed inevitable that at the next bound he should
drag him down; so close was he that the ape-man drew his
knife as he ran, that he might at least give a good account of
himself in the last moments of his life.
<P>
But Numa had reached the limit of his speed and endurance.
Gradually he dropped behind but he did not give up the
pursuit, and now Tarzan realized how much hinged upon the
strength of the untested vines.
<P>
If, at the inception of the race, only Goro and the stars had
looked down upon the contestants, such was not the case at
its finish, since from an embrasure near the summit of the
wall two close-set black eyes peered down upon the two.
Tarzan was a dozen yards ahead of Numa when he reached
the wall. There was no time to stop and institute a search
for sturdy stems and safe handholds. His fate was in the
hands of chance and with the realization he gave a final spurt
and running catlike up the side of the wall among the vines,
sought with his hands for something that would sustain his
weight. Below him Numa leaped also.
