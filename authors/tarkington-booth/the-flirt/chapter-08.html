<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Hedrick Madison, like too many other people, had never thought
seriously about the moon; nor ever had he encouraged it to become
his familiar; and he underwent his first experience of its incomparable
betrayals one brilliant night during the last week of that hot
month. The preface to this romantic evening was substantial and
prosaic: four times during dinner was he copiously replenished
with hash, which occasioned so rich a surfeit within him that,
upon the conclusion of the meal, he found himself in no condition
to retort appropriately to a solicitous warning from Cora to keep
away from the cat. Indeed, it was half an hour later, and he was
sitting&mdash;to his own consciousness too heavily&mdash;upon the back fence,
when belated inspiration arrived. But there is no sound where
there is no ear to hear, and no repartee, alas! when the wretch
who said the first part has gone, so that Cora remained unscathed
as from his alley solitude Hedrick hurled in the teeth of the
rising moon these bitter words:</p>

<p>"Oh, no; <em>our</em> cat only eats <em>soft</em> meat!"</p>

<p>He renewed a morbid silence, and the moon, with its customary
deliberation, swung clear of a sweeping branch of the big elm
in the front yard and shone full upon him. Nothing warned the
fated youth not to sit there; no shadow of imminent catastrophe
tinted that brightness: no angel whisper came to him, bidding
him begone&mdash;and to go in a hurry and as far as possible. No; he
sat upon the fence an inoffensive lad, and&mdash;except for still feeling
his hash somewhat, and a gradually dispersing rancour concerning
the cat&mdash;at peace. It is for such lulled mortals that the ever-lurking
Furies save their most hideous surprises.</p>

<p>Chin on palms, he looked idly at the moon, and the moon inscrutably
returned his stare. Plausible, bright, bland, it gave no sign
that it was at its awful work. For the bride of night is like
a card-dealer whose fingers move so swiftly through the pack the
trickery goes unseen.</p>

<p>This moon upon which he was placidly gazing, because he had nothing
else to do, betokened nought to Hedrick: to him it was the moon
of any other night, the old moon; certainly no moon of his delight.
Withal, it may never be gazed upon so fixedly and so protractedly&mdash;no
matter how languidly&mdash;with entire impunity. That light breeds
a bug in the brain. Who can deny how the moon wrought this thing
under the hair of unconscious Hedrick, or doubt its responsibility
for the thing that happened?</p>

<p>"<em>Little boy</em>!"</p>

<p>It was a very soft, small voice, silky and queer; and at first
Hedrick had little suspicion that it could be addressing him:
the most rigid self-analysis could have revealed to him no possibility
of his fitting so ignominious a description.</p>

<p>"Oh, little boy!"</p>

<p>He looked over his shoulder and saw, standing in the alley behind
him, a girl of about his own age. She was daintily dressed and
had beautiful hair which was all shining in pale gold.</p>

<p>"Little boy!"</p>

<p>She was smiling up at him, and once more she used that wantonly
inaccurate vocative:</p>

<p>"Little boy!"</p>

<p>Hedrick grunted unencouragingly. "Who you callin' `little boy'?"</p>

<p>For reply she began to climb the fence. It was high, but the
young lady was astonishingly agile, and not even to be deterred
by several faint wails from tearing and ripping fabrics&mdash;casualties
which appeared to be entirely beneath her notice. Arriving at
the top rather dishevelled, and with irregular pennons here and
there flung to the breeze from her attire, she seated herself
cosily beside the dumbfounded Hedrick.</p>

<p>She turned her face to him and smiled&mdash;and there was something
about her smile which Hedrick did not like. It discomforted him;
nothing more. In sunlight he would have had the better chance
to comprehend; but, unhappily, this was moonshine.</p>

<p>"Kiss me, little boy!" she said.</p>

<p>"I won't!" exclaimed the shocked and indignant Hedrick, edging
uneasily away from her.</p>

<p>"Let's play," she said cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Play what?"</p>

<p>"I like chickens. Did you know I like chickens?"</p>

<p>The rather singular lack of connection in her remarks struck
him as a misplaced effort at humour.</p>

<p>"You're having lots of fun with me, aren't you?" he growled.</p>

<p>She instantly moved close to him and lifted her face to his.</p>

<p>"Kiss me, darling little boy!" she said.</p>

<p>There was something more than uncommonly queer about this stranger,
an unearthliness of which he was confusedly perceptive, but she
was not without a curious kind of prettiness, and her pale gold
hair was beautiful. The doomed lad saw the moon shining through
it.</p>

<p>"Kiss me, darling little boy!" she repeated.</p>

<p>His head whirled; for the moment she seemed divine.</p>

<p>George Washington used profanity at the Battle of Monmouth. Hedrick
kissed her.</p>

<p>He instantly pushed her away with strong distaste. "There!" he
said angrily. "I hope that'll satisfy you!" He belonged to his
sex.</p>

<p>"Kiss me some more, darling little boy!" she cried, and flung
her arms about him.</p>

<p>With a smothered shout of dismay he tried to push her off, and
they fell from the fence together, into the yard, at the cost
of further and almost fatal injuries to the lady's apparel.</p>

<p>Hedrick was first upon his feet. "Haven't you got <em>any</em>
sense?" he demanded.</p>

<p>She smiled unwaveringly, rose (without assistance) and repeated:
"Kiss me some more, darling little boy!"</p>

<p>"No, I won't! I wouldn't for a thousand dollars!"</p>

<p>Apparently, she did not consider this discouraging. She began
to advance endearingly, while he retreated backward. "Kiss me
some&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I won't, I tell you!" Hedrick kept stepping away, moving in
a desperate circle. He resorted to a brutal formula: "You make
me sick!"</p>

<p>"Kiss me some more, darling lit&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I won't!" he bellowed. "And if you say that again I'll&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Kiss me some more, darling little boy!" She flung herself at
him, and with a yell of terror he turned and ran at top-speed.</p>

<p>She pursued, laughing sweetly, and calling loudly as she ran,
"Kiss me some more, darling little boy! Kiss me some more, darling
little boy!"</p>

<p>The stricken Hedrick knew not whither to direct his flight: he
dared not dash for the street with this imminent tattered incubus&mdash;she
was almost upon him&mdash;and he frantically made for the kitchen door,
only to swerve with a gasp of despair as his foot touched the
step, for she was at his heels, and he was sickeningly assured
she would cheerfully follow him through the house, shouting that
damning refrain for all ears. A strangling fear took him by the
throat&mdash;if Cora should come to be a spectator of this unspeakable
flight, if Cora should hear that horrid plea for love! Then farewell
peace; indeed, farewell all joy in life forever!</p>

<p>Panting sobbingly, he ducked under the amorous vampire's arm
and fled on. He zigzagged desperately to and fro across the broad,
empty backyard, a small hand ever and anon managing to clutch
his shoulder, the awful petition in his ears:</p>

<p>"Kiss me some more, darling little boy!"</p>

<p>"<em>Hedrick</em>!"</p>

<p>Emerging from the kitchen door, Laura stood and gazed in wonder
as the two eerie figures sped by her, circled, ducked, dodged,
flew madly on. This commonplace purlieu was become the scene of
a witch-chase; the moonlight fell upon the ghastly flitting face
of the pursued, uplifted in agony, white, wet, with fay eyes;
also it illumined the unreal elf following close, a breeze-blown
fantasy in rags.</p>

<p>"Kiss me some more, darling little boy!"</p>

<p>Laura uttered a sharp exclamation. "Stand still, Hedrick!" she
called. "You must!"</p>

<p>Hedrick made a piteous effort to increase his speed.</p>

<p>"It's Lolita Martin," called Laura. "She must have her way or
nothing can be done with her. Stand <em>still</em>!"</p>

<p>Hedrick had never heard of Lolita Martin, but the added information
concerning her was not ineffective: it operated as a spur; and
Laura joined the hunt.</p>

<p>"Stand still!" she cried to the wretched quarry. "She's run away.
She must be taken home. Stop, Hedrick! You <em>must</em> stop!"</p>

<p>Hedrick had no intention of stopping, but Laura was a runner,
and, as he dodged the other, caught and held him fast. The next
instant, Lolita, laughing happily, flung her arms round his neck
from behind.</p>

<p>"Lemme go!" shuddered Hedrick. "Lemme go!"</p>

<p>"Kiss me again, darl&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>woof!" He became inarticulate.</p>

<p>"She isn't quite right," his sister whispered hurriedly in his
ear. "She has spells when she's weak mentally. You must be kind
to her. She only wants you to&#11834;"</p>

<p>"`<em>Only</em>'!" he echoed hoarsely. "I won't ki&#11834;" He was
unable to finish the word.</p>

<p>"We must get her home," said Laura anxiously. "Will you come
with me, Lolita, dear?"</p>

<p>Apparently Lolita had no consciousness whatever of Laura's presence.
Instead of replying, she tightened her grasp upon Hedrick and
warmly reiterated her request.</p>

<p>"Shut up, you parrot!" hissed the goaded boy.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she'll go if you let her walk with her arms round your
neck," suggested Laura.</p>

<p>"If I <em>what</em>?"</p>

<p>"Let's try it. We've got to get her home; her mother must be
frantic about her. Come, let's see if she'll go with us that way."</p>

<p>With convincing earnestness, Hedrick refused to make the experiment
until Laura suggested that he remain with Lolita while she summoned
assistance; then, as no alternative appeared, his spirit broke
utterly, and he consented to the trial, stipulating with a last
burst of vehemence that the progress of the unthinkable pageant
should be through the alley.</p>

<p>"Come, Lolita," said Laura coaxingly. "We're going for a nice
walk." At the adjective, Hedrick's burdened shoulders were racked
with a brief spasm, which recurred as his sister added: "Your
darling little boy will let you keep hold of him."</p>

<p>Lolita seemed content. Laughing gayly, she offered no opposition,
but, maintaining her embrace with both arms and walking somewhat
sidewise, went willingly enough; and the three slowly crossed
the yard, passed through the empty stable and out into the alley.
When they reached the cross-street at the alley's upper end, Hedrick
balked flatly.</p>

<p>Laura expostulated, then entreated. Hedrick refused with sincere
loathing to be seen upon the street occupying his present position
in the group. Laura assured him that there was no one to see;
he replied that the moon was bright and the evening early; he
would die, and readily, but he would not set foot in the street.
Unfortunately, he had selected an unfavourable spot for argument:
they were already within a yard or two of the street; and a strange
boy, passing, stopped and observed, and whistled discourteously.</p>

<p>"Ain't he the spooner!" remarked this unknown with hideous admiration.</p>

<p>"I'll thank you," returned Hedrick haughtily, "to go on about
your own business."</p>

<p>"Kiss me some more, darling little boy!" said Lolita.</p>

<p>The strange boy squawked, wailed, screamed with laughter, howled
the loving petition in a dozen keys of mockery, while Hedrick
writhed and Lolita clung. Enriched by a new and great experience,
the torturer trotted on, leaving viperish cachinnations in his
wake.</p>

<p>But the martyrdom was at an end. A woman, hurrying past, bareheaded,
was greeted by a cry of delight from Lolita, who released Hedrick
and ran to her with outstretched arms.</p>

<p>"We were bringing her home, Mrs. Martin," said Laura, reassuringly.
"She's all right; nothing's the matter except that her dress got
torn. We found her playing in our yard."</p>

<p>"I thank you a thousand times, Miss Madison," cried Lolita's
mother, and flutteringly plunged into a description of her anxiety,
her search for Lolita, and concluded with renewed expressions
of gratitude for the child's safe return, an outpouring of thankfulness
and joy wholly incomprehensible to Hedrick.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Laura cheerfully. "Come, Hedrick. We'll go
home by the street, I think." She touched his shoulder, and he
went with her in stunned obedience. He was not able to face the
incredible thing that had happened to him: he walked in a trance
of horror.</p>

<p>"Poor little girl!" said Laura gently, with what seemed to her
brother an indefensibly misplaced compassion. "Usually they have
her live in an institution for people afflicted as she is, but
they brought her home for a visit last week, I believe. Of course
you didn't understand, but I think you should have been more thoughtful.
Really, you shouldn't have flirted with her."</p>

<p>Hedrick stopped short.</p>

<p>"`<em>Flirted</em>'!" His voice was beginning to show symptoms
of changing, this year; it rose to a falsetto wail, flickered
and went out.</p>

<p>With the departure of Lolita in safety, what had seemed bizarre
and piteous became obscured, and another aspect of the adventure
was presented to Laura. The sufferings of the arrogant are not
wholly depressing to the spectator; and of arrogance Hedrick had
ever been a master. She began to shake; a convulsion took her,
and suddenly she sat upon the curbstone without dignity, and laughed
as he had never seen her.</p>

<p>A horrid distrust of her rose within him: he began to realize
in what plight he stood, what terrors o'erhung.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said miserably, "are you&mdash;you aren't&mdash;you don't
have to go and&mdash;and <em>talk</em> about this, do you?"</p>

<p>"No, Hedrick," she responded, rising and controlling herself
somewhat. "Not so long as you're good."</p>

<p>This was no reassuring answer.</p>

<p>"And politer to Cora," she added.</p>

<p>Seemingly he heard the lash of a slave-whip crack in the air.
The future grew dark.</p>

<p>"I know you'll try"&mdash;she said; and the unhappy lad felt that
her assurance was justified; but she had not concluded the sentence&mdash;"darling
little boy," she capped it, choking slightly.</p>

<p>"No other little girl ever fell in love with you, did there,
Hedrick?" she asked, and, receiving an incoherent but furious
reply, she was again overcome, so that she must lean against the
fence to recover. "It seems&mdash;so&mdash;so <em>curious</em>," she explained,
gasping, "that the first one&mdash;the&mdash;the only one&mdash;should be an&mdash;a&mdash;an&#11834;"
She was unable to continue.</p>

<p>Hedrick's distrust became painfully increased: he began to feel
that he disliked Laura.</p>

<p>She was still wiping her eyes and subject to recurrent outbursts
when they reached their own abode; and as he bitterly flung himself
into a chair upon the vacant front porch, he heard her stifling
an attack as she mounted the stairs to her own room. He swung
the chair about, with its back to the street, and sat facing the
wall. He saw nothing. There are profundities in the abyss which
reveal no glimpse of the sky.</p>

<p>Presently he heard his father coughing near by; and the sound
was hateful, because it seemed secure and unshamed. It was a cough
of moral superiority; and just then the son would have liked to
believe that his parent's boyhood had been one of degradation
as complete as his own; but no one with this comfortable cough
could ever have plumbed such depths: his imagination refused the
picture he was bitterly certain that Mr. Madison had never kissed
an idiot.</p>

<p>Hedrick had a dread that his father might speak to him; he was
in no condition for light conversation. But Mr. Madison was unaware
of his son's near presence, and continued upon his purposeless
way. He was smoking his one nightly cigar and enjoying the moonlight.
He drifted out toward the sidewalk and was accosted by a passing
acquaintance, a comfortable burgess of sixty, leading a child
of six or seven, by the hand.</p>

<p>"Out taking the air, are you, Mr. Madison?" said the pedestrian,
pausing.</p>

<p>"Yes; just trying to cool off," returned the other. "How are
you, Pryor, anyway? I haven't seen you for a long time."</p>

<p>"Not since last summer," said Pryor. "I only get here once or
twice a year, to see my married daughter. I always try to spend
August with her if I can. She's still living in that little house,
over on the next street, I bought for her through your real-estate
company. I suppose you're still in the same business?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Pretty slack, these days."</p>

<p>"I suppose so, I suppose so," responded Mr. Pryor, nodding. "Summer,
I suppose it usually is. Well, I don't know when I'll be going
out on the road again myself. Business is pretty slack all over
the country this year."</p>

<p>"Let's see &mdash;I've forgotten," said Madison ruminatively.
"You travel, don't you?"</p>

<p>"For a New York house," affirmed Mr. Pryor. He did not, however,
mention his "line." "Yes-sir," he added, merely as a decoration,
and then said briskly: "I see you have a fine family, Mr. Madison;
yes-sir, a fine family; I've passed here several times lately
and I've noticed 'em: fine family. Let's see, you've got four,
haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Three," said Madison. "Two girls and a boy."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, that's mighty nice," observed Mr. Pryor; "<em>mighty</em>
nice! I only have my one daughter, and of course me living in
New York when I'm at home, and her here, why, I don't get to see
much of her. You got both your daughters living with you, haven't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, right here at home."</p>

<p>"Let's see: neither of 'em's married, I believe?"</p>

<p>"No; not yet."</p>

<p>"Seems to me now," said Pryor, taking off his glasses and wiping
them, "seems to me I did hear somebody say one of 'em was going
to be married engaged, maybe."</p>

<p>"No," said Madison. "Not that I know of."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you'd be the first to know! Yes-sir." And both
men laughed their appreciation of this folly. "They're mighty
good-looking girls, <em>that's</em> certain," continued Mr. Pryor.
"And one of 'em's as fine a dresser as you'll meet this side the
Rue de la Paix."</p>

<p>"You mean in Paris?" asked Madison, slightly surprised at this
allusion. "You've been over there, Pryor?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sometimes," was the response. "My business takes me over,
now and then. I <em>think</em> it's one of your daughters I've
noticed dresses so well. Isn't one of 'em a mighty pretty girl
about twenty-one or two, with a fine head of hair sort of lightish
brown, beautiful figure, and carries a white parasol with a green
lining sometimes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's Cora, I guess."</p>

<p>"Pretty name, too," said Pryor approvingly. "Yes-sir. I saw her
going into a florist's, downtown, the other day, with a fine-looking
young fellow &mdash;I can't think of his name. Let's see: my daughter
was with me, and she'd heard his name&mdash;said his family used to
be big people in this town and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Madison, "young Corliss."</p>

<p>"Corliss!" exclaimed Mr. Pryor, with satisfaction. "That's it,
Corliss. Well, sir," he chuckled, "from the way he was looking
at your Miss Cora it struck me he seemed kind of anxious for her
name to be Corliss, too."</p>

<p>"Well, hardly I expect," said the other. "They just barely know
each other: he's only been here a few weeks; they haven't had
time to get much acquainted, you see."</p>

<p>"I suppose not," agreed Mr. Pryor, with perfect readiness. "I
suppose not. I'll bet <em>he</em> tries all he can to get acquainted
though; he looked pretty smart to me. Doesn't he come about as
often as the law allows?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be surprised," said Madison indifferently. "He doesn't
know many people about here any more, and it's lonesome for him
at the hotel. But I guess he comes to see the whole family; I
left him in the library a little while ago, talking to my wife."</p>

<p>"That's the way! Get around the old folks first!" Mr. Pryor chuckled
cordially; then in a mildly inquisitive tone he said: "Seems to
be a fine, square young fellow, I expect?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so."</p>

<p>"Pretty name, `Cora'," said Pryor.</p>

<p>"What's this little girl's name?" Mr. Madison indicated the child,
who had stood with heroic patience throughout the incomprehensible
dialogue.</p>

<p>"Lottie, for her mother. She's a good little girl."</p>

<p>"She is <em>so</em>! I've got a young son she ought to know,"
remarked Mr. Madison serenely, with an elderly father's total
unconsciousness of the bridgeless gap between seven and thirteen.
"He'd like to play with her. I'll call him."</p>

<p>"I expect we better be getting on," said Pryor. "It's near Lottie's
bedtime; we just came out for our evening walk."</p>

<p>"Well, he can come and shake hands with her anyway," urged Hedrick's
father. "Then they'll know each other, and they can play some
other time." He turned toward the house and called loudly:</p>

<p>"Hedrick!"</p>

<p>There was no response. Behind the back of his chair Hedrick could
not be seen. He was still sitting immovable, his eyes torpidly
fixed upon the wall.</p>

<p>"Hed-<em>rick</em>!"</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>Hed</em>-rick!" shouted his father. "Come out here!
I want you to meet a little girl! Come and see a nice little girl!"</p>

<p>Mr. Pryor's grandchild was denied the pleasure. At the ghastly
words "<em>little girl</em>," Hedrick dropped from his chair flat
upon the floor, crawled to the end of the porch, wriggled through
the railing, and immersed himself in deep shadow against the side
of the house.</p>

<p>Here he removed his shoes, noiselessly mounted to the sill of
one of the library windows, then reconnoitred through a slit in
the blinds before entering.</p>

<p>The gas burned low in the "drop-light"&mdash;almost too dimly to reveal
the two people upon a sofa across the room. It was a faint murmur
from one of them that caused Hedrick to pause and peer more sharply.
They were Cora and Corliss; he was bending close to her; her face
was lifting to his.</p>

<p>"Ah, kiss me! Kiss me!" she whispered.</p>

<p>Hedrick dropped from the sill, climbed through a window of the
kitchen, hurried up the back-stairs, and reached his own apartment
in time to be violently ill in seclusion.</p>
