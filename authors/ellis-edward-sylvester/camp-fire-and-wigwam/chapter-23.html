<p>From what has been told concerning Deerfoot, the reader knows
that the tribe which held Jack Carleton prisoner were Sauks, or
Sacs, as the name is often spelled. They belonged to the great
Algonquin division, and, when first known to Europeans, inhabited
the country near Detroit River and Saginaw Bay, but were driven
beyond Lake Michigan by the powerful Iroquois. They themselves
were of a restless and warlike nature and were the bitter enemies
of the Sioux and Iroquois. They were the allies of the famous
war-chief Pontiac who besieged Detroit so long, and, during the
Revolution fought on the side of the English. They were closely
associated with the Foxes, and frequently moved from one section
of the country to another, in which respect they resembled the
majority of American Indians.</p>

<p>The chief who has been referred to as Ogallah was one of the
most fiery-tempered and quarrelsome members of the Sauk tribe.
In one of the expeditions against the Sioux, he not only performed
wonderful deeds of daring, but tomahawked several of his own warriors,
because, in his judgment, they showed a timidity in attacking
the common foe. One of the Sauks who fell by the hand of the wrathful
sachem was the brother of the leading chief. This precipitated
a fierce quarrel between the two, the upshot of which was that
Ogallah, and a number of followers, drew off from the main tribe
and began "keeping house" for themselves. Migrating southward
with the purpose of placing a long stretch of country between
them and the parent tribe, they finally erected their lodges on
the banks of a stream on the Ozark region, in what is now Southern
Missouri and upper Arkansas.</p>

<p>I have already said the Indians gave the white men little trouble
in that section during the pioneer days. In that respect, no comparison
can be made with Kentucky and Ohio. As early as 1720, the lead
deposits in Missouri attracted notice, and its oldest town, Saint
Genevieve, was founded in 1755. St. Louis became the depot for
the fur trade of the vast region beyond, and at the breaking out
of the Revolution, was a town of considerable importance.</p>

<p>The warrior Hay-uta with whom Deerfoot had his remarkable interview
was a fair representative of the Sauk nation, and especially of
that division which was under the following of Ogallah. Some of
the warriors were constantly roaming through the wilderness in
quest of scalps. While they were nothing loth to engage in a scrimmage
with the hunters and trappers, yet they preferred those of their
own race above all others. No Sioux or Iroquois could have approached
within hundreds of miles without the certainty of an encounter
with the warlike Sauks.</p>

<p>The Sauk party which appeared so close to the settlement of Martinsville
had been out for several weeks looking for "game" in the form
of Sioux, who lived far to the northward. They had found some
of it too, and were returning home in a leisurely manner. They
took a careful survey of the settlement, and even discussed the
wisdom of making an attack on it; but they saw it could not be
destroyed by so small a force, and though they might have shot
several of the settlers before they could know their danger, they
decided to pass on without making any demonstration at all.</p>

<p>When Jack Carleton and Otto Relstaub walked up to the party,
it was no more than natural that they should be made prisoners.
No particular reason can be assigned for the separation of the
party, one division of which took Jack and the other Otto, except
that a survey of the land passed over could be better made by
that means. However, this point will be dwelt upon more fully
in another place.</p>

<p>Probably no person ever played the part of captive among a tribe
of savages without devoting most of his thoughts to the question
of escape. It is inevitable that he should do so, for the fate
is so painful in every respect that, but for the hope, one would
be ready to lie down and die.</p>

<p>Jack had turned the question over and over in his mind, and had
done his utmost to give his captors the slip while on the road,
but misfortune attended every venture, and at last he found himself
in the lodge of the chieftain Ogallah himself, where it looked
as if he was likely to remain indefinitely.</p>

<p>"Well, this beats everything," he exclaimed, after finishing
the meal and seating himself at the side of the lodge, so as to
be out of the way of the housewife, as she moved back and forth
and here and there while attending to her duties; "I've come a
long distance through the woods, and it'll take some time to find
my way back to Martinsville, after I once make a start."</p>

<p>He could not persuade himself that his captivity might last for
months and possibly for years. He was confident that no matter
how vigilant the watch maintained, he would gain a chance to give
the Indians the slip within two or three days at the furthest.</p>

<p>"I did my best to make Ogallah and the others think I wasn't
anxious to leave, but the work was all thrown away. These people
are not fools, and no matter how well I may act, they know of
a surety that the whole prayer of my life is to part company with
them."</p>

<p>The conclusion reached by Jack was common sense, though the story-writers
sometimes make it appear that the keen minded American Indian
may be duped in that transparent fashion. The utmost that Jack
Carleton could hope to do was to show his captors that, while
he longed to return to his friends, he saw no means of doing so,
and therefore was not likely to make the attempt. Such he resolved
would be his course.</p>

<p>The boy was fatigued in mind and body, and, when he bowed his
head in prayer (much to the astonishment of Ogallah and his squaw),
and lay down on the bison robe, he sank into a refreshing slumber,
from which he did not awake until morning, and then, when he did
so, he came to his senses with a yell that almost raised the roof.</p>

<p>The Sauks, like all their race, were extremely fond of dogs,
and the mongrel curs seemed to be everywhere. Jack had noticed
them trotting through the village, playing with the children and
basking in the sun. A number sniffed at his heels, as he passed
by with Ogallah, but did not offer to disturb him.</p>

<p>The chief was the owner of a mangy cur, which seemed to have
been off on some private business of his own, when his master
returned, inasmuch as he did not put in an appearance until early
the following morning, when he trotted sideways up to the lodge
and entered, as he could readily do, inasmuch as the "latch string
was always out." The canine was quick to notice the stranger lying
on the bison skin with his eyes closed and his mouth open. With
an angry growl he trotted in the same sidelong fashion across
the space, and pushing his nose under Jack's legs gave him a smart
bite, just below the knee, as though he meant to devour him, and
concluded that was the best part of his anatomy on which to make
a beginning.</p>

<p>The foregoing will explain why Jack Carleton awoke with a yell
and stared around him for an explanation of the insult. The vigor
of his kicks, and the resonant nature of his cries, filled the
dog with a panic, and he skurried out of the lodge with his tail
between his legs, and cast affrighted glances behind him.</p>

<p>"Confound the cur," muttered Jack, rubbing the injured limb,
"is that the style of these dogs when a stranger calls?"</p>

<p>Ogallah was entering the door of his home just as the canine
was going out. Suspecting what mischief he had been committing,
he placed his moccasin under the brute and elevated him several
feet in the air, with a force which caused him to turn end over
end, with an accompaniment of yelps and howls which were kept
up until he was out of sight and hearing.</p>

<p>The wife of Ogallah was preparing breakfast, which was of the
simplest character, consisting of nothing but meat cooked over
the coals as on the evening before. There was nothing in the nature
of vegetables, though something of the kind was growing on the
cleared land without.</p>

<p>Jack longed for the pure, fresh air of the outside. The smoke
of the chieftain's pipe, the smell of burning meat, and the untidiness
of the place and people, left a stale odor, which was nauseating
to one unaccustomed to it.</p>

<p>He wanted a drink of cold water as it bubbled from the earth,
and, rising to his feet, passed outdoors. The squaw merely glanced
up, while Ogallah addressed several rapidly spoken words to him.
Then recollecting that nothing he said could be understood, he
smiled grimly, and turned his back on the lad.</p>

<p>Reaching the outside, Jack stood still for a minute, uncertain
what course to take. The warriors, squaws, and children were astir;
but no one seemed to observe him when he paused in front of the
chieftain's lodge.</p>

<p>"I'll try the river," was his conclusion, as he stepped briskly
off, his heart beating rapidly, for he knew from his experience
of the previous night, that much curiosity respecting him was
felt, and he was certain to attract annoying attention. But he
reached the stream, where he stooped and bathed his face and hands,
wiping them on the handkerchief he carried, and still heard and
saw nothing to cause misgiving.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether they drink from this," he said, rising to his
feet, and looking around; "I can't say that I fancy it, for it
isn't as clear as it looked to be when I was further off; then
the youngsters bathe and play in it&mdash;helloa!"</p>

<p>He saw an Indian woman making her way toward one of the wigwams
on the edge of the village, carrying a large gourd of water in
her arms. It was filled almost to the brim, and slopped over the
edge, as it was disturbed by her movement in walking. It was fair
to conclude that she had taken it from the spring for which Jack
was looking, and he immediately moved toward her. She stopped
abruptly when she saw him approach, and stared in such open-mouthed
amazement that it was evident that this was the first glance she
had obtained of the captive.</p>

<p>Jack made signs of comity, and sheered off so as to reach the
path considerably to the rear of the squaw, who, with a grunt,
made an equally wide circuit in the opposite direction, so that
the two avoided each other by a liberal space of ground.</p>

<p>The boy saw that he was moving over a well-worn path, which he
was confident led to the spring he wished to find. Nearly every
step was marked by the drippings of water from the gourd of the
woman he had just met.</p>

<p>Sure enough, he had gone less than a hundred yards beyond the
village when he came upon the spring, which bubbled from under
the twisted black roots of an oak, throwing up the sand in a continual
fountain-like tumble of melted silver. The lad looked down at
it for a moment, and then sinking to his hands and knees, pressed
his lips against the cold, crystal-fluid, the most refreshing
element in all nature.</p>

<p>Had not his nose and eyes been so close to the water, Jack Carleton
would have caught the reflection of another face just behind his
own&mdash;a face which would have driven all thirst away and caused
him to bound to his feet, as though he had heard the whirr of
a coiled rattlesnake at his elbow.</p>

<p>But Jack saw and suspected nothing. He had taken three good swallows
when some one gave the back of his head such a smart push, that
the nose was shoved down among the silver sands, which streamed
from his face, as he sprang to his feet, and stared gasping, blinking,
and furious.</p>

<p>"Who the deuce did that?" he demanded, forgetting himself in
his anger.</p>

<p>His own eyes answered the question. Three Indian boys were standing,
laughing as if ready to hurt themselves over his discomfiture.
Two of them were very nearly the height and age of Jack, while
the third, who had played the trick on him, was older and taller.</p>

<p>The captive was angry enough to assail all three, and it required
a smart exercise of the will to restrain himself. But he saw the
folly of such a step. The affray would quickly bring others to
the spot, and very speedily Jack would find himself attacked by
overwhelming numbers, and possibly would be beaten to death. No;
he must use ordinary prudence and swallow the insult.</p>

<p>He looked in the grinning faces of the homely youths, and made
quite a successful effort to join their laughter (though precious
little mirth was there in the essay), and then started back toward
the lodge of Ogallah.</p>

<p>The youth tried to walk with a dignified step, but he was sadly
thrown out by a dexterous trip from one of the moccasins, which
sent him stumbling forward with a very narrow escape from falling
on his hands and knees.</p>

<p>It was the tallest of the three who had tripped him, and all
laughed like a lot of clowns, as the angered Jack glared at them.</p>

<p>"I wish I had you alone," muttered the boy between his set teeth;
"I wouldn't need more than five minutes to give you a lesson you'd
remember all your life."</p>
