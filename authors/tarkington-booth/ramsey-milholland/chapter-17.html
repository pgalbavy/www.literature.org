<p>Throughout the term Ramsey's calculation of probabilities against
the happening of another interview with Dora seemed to be well
founded, but at the beginning of the second "semester" he found
her to be a fellow member of a class in biology. More than that,
this class had every week a two-hour session in the botanical
laboratory, where the structure of plants was studied under microscopic
dissection. The students worked in pairs, a special family of
plants being assigned to each couple; and the instructor selected
the couples with an eye to combinations of the quick with the
slow. D. Yocum and R. Milholland (the latter in a strange state
of mind and complexion) were given two chairs, but only one desk
and one microscope. Their conversation was strictly botanical.</p>

<p>Thenceforth it became the most pressing care of Ramsey's life
to prevent his roommate from learning that there was any conversation
at all, even botanical. Fortunately, Fred was not taking the biological
courses, though he appeared to be taking the sentimental ones
with an astonishing thoroughness; and sometimes, to Fred's hilarious
delight, Ramsey attempted to turn the tables and rally him upon
whatever last affair seemed to be engaging his fancy. The old
Victorian and pre-Victorian <em>blague</em> word "petticoat" had
been revived in Fred's vocabulary, and in others, as "skirt."
The lightsome sprig was hourly to be seen, even when university
rulings forbade, dilly-dallying giddily along the campus paths
or the town sidewalks with some new and pretty Skirt. And when
Ramsey tried to fluster him about such a matter Fred would profess
his ardent love for the new lady in shouts and impromptu song.
Nothing could be done to him, and Ramsey, utterly unable to defend
his own sensibilities in like manner, had always to retire in
bafflement. Sometimes he would ponder upon the question thus suggested:
Why couldn't he do this sort of thing, since Fred could? But he
never discovered a satisfying answer.</p>

<p>Ramsey's watchfulness was so careful (lest he make some impulsive
admission in regard to the botanical laboratory, for instance)
that Mr. Mitchell's curiosity gradually became almost quiescent;
but there arrived a day in February when it was piqued into the
liveliest activity. It was Sunday, and Fred, dressing with a fastidiousness
ever his daily habit, noticed that Ramsey was exhibiting an unusual
perplexity about neckties.</p>

<p>"Keep the black one on," Fred said, volunteering the suggestion,
as Ramsey muttered fiercely at a mirror. "It's in better taste
for church, anyhow. You're going to church, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Are you?"</p>

<p>"No. I've got a luncheon engagement."</p>

<p>"Well, you could go to church first, couldn't you? You better;
you've got a lot of church absences against you."</p>

<p>"Then one more won't hurt. No church in mine this morning, thanks!
G'by, ole sox; see you at the 'frat house' for dinner."</p>

<p>He went forth, whistling syncopations, and began a brisk trudge
into the open country. There was a professor's daughter who also
was not going to church that morning; and she lived a little more
than three miles beyond the outskirts of the town. Unfortunately,
as the weather was threatening, all others of her family abandoned
the idea of church that day, and Fred found her before a cozy
fire, but surrounded by parents, little brothers, and big sisters.
The professor was talkative; Fred's mind might have been greatly
improved, but with a window in range he preferred a melancholy
contemplation of the snow, which had begun to fall in quantity.
The professor talked until luncheon, throughout luncheon, and
was well under way to fill the whole afternoon with talk, when
Fred, repenting all the errors of his life, got up to go.</p>

<p>Heartily urged to remain, for there was now something just under
a blizzard developing, he said No; he had a great deal of "cirriculum
work" to get done before the morrow, and passed from the sound
of the professor's hospitable voice and into the storm. He had
a tedious struggle against the wind and thickening snow, but finally
came in sight of the town, not long before dark. Here the road
led down into a depression, and, lifting his head as he began
the slight ascent on the other side, Fred was aware of two figures
outlined upon the low ridge before him. They were dimmed by the
driving snow and their backs were toward him, but he recognized
them with perfect assurance. They were Dora Yocum and Ramsey Milholland.</p>

<p>They were walking so slowly that their advance was almost imperceptible,
but it could be seen that Dora was talking with great animation;
and she was a graceful thing, thus gesticulating, in her long,
slim fur coat with the white snow frosting her brown fur cap.
Ramsey had his hands deep in his overcoat pockets and his manner
was wholly that of an audience.</p>

<p>Fred murmured to himself, "'What did you say to her?' 'Nothin'.
I started to, but'&mdash;" Then he put on a burst of speed and passed
them, sweeping off his hat with operatic deference, yet hurrying
by as if fearful of being thought a killjoy if he lingered. He
went to the "frat house," found no one downstairs, and established
himself in a red leather chair to smoke and ruminate merrily by
a great fire in the hall.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Ramsey entered, stamped off the snow, hung
up his hat and coat, and sat himself down defiantly in the red
leather chair on the other side of the fireplace.</p>

<p>"Well, go on," he said. "Commence!"</p>

<p>"Not at all!" Fred returned, amiably. "Fine spring weather to-day.
Lovely to see all the flowers and the birds as we go a-strolling
by. The little bobolinks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You look here! That's the only walk I ever took with her in
my life. I mean by&mdash;by asking her and her saying she would and
so forth. That other time just sort of happened, and you know
it. Well, the weather wasn't just the best in the world, maybe,
but she's an awful conscientious girl and once she makes an engagement&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, of course," Fred finished for him, "She'd be too pious
to break it just on account of a mere little blizzard or anything.
Wonder how the weather will be next Sunday?"</p>

<p>"I don't know and I don't care," said Ramsey. "You don't suppose
I asked her to go <em>again</em>, do you?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Well, for one thing, you don't suppose I want her to think I'm
a perfect fool, do you?"</p>

<p>Fred mused a moment or two, looking at the fire. "What was the
lecture?"  he asked, mildly.</p>

<p>"What lecture?"</p>

<p>"She seemed to me to be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That wasn't lecturing; she was just&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just what?"</p>

<p>"Well; she thinks war for the United States is coming closer
and closer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it isn't."</p>

<p>"Well, she thinks so, anyhow," said Ramsey, "and she's all broken
up about it. Of course she thinks we oughtn't to fight and she's
trying to get everybody else she can to keep working against it.
She isn't goin' home again next summer, she's goin' back to that
settlement work in Chicago and work there among those people against
our goin' to war; and here in college she wants to get everybody
she can to talk against it, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did you say?" Fred asked, and himself supplied the reply:
"Nothin'. I started to, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ramsey got up. "Now look here! You know the 'frat' passed a rule
that if we broke any more furniture in this house with our scrappin'
we'd both be fined the cost of repairs and five dollars apiece.
Well, I can afford five dollars this month better than you can,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I take it back!" Fred interposed, hastily. "But you just listen
to me; you look out&mdash;letting her think you're on her side like
that."</p>

<p>"I don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You <em>don't?</em>"</p>

<p>Ramsey looked dogged. "I'm not goin' around always arguin' about
everything when arguin' would just hurt people's feelings about
something they're all excited about, and wouldn't do a bit o'
good in the world&mdash;and you know yourself just <em>talk</em> hardly
ever settles anything&mdash;so I don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aha!" Fred cried. "I thought so! Now you listen to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>But at this moment they were interrupted. Someone slyly opened
the door, and a snowball deftly thrown from without caught Ramsey
upon the back of the neck and head, where it flattened and displayed
itself as an ornamental star. Shouting fiercely, both boys sprang
up, ran to the door, were caught there in a barrage of snowballs,
ducked through it in spite of all damage, charged upon a dozen
besweatered figures awaiting them and began a mad battle in the
blizzard. Some of their opponents treacherously joined them, and
turned upon the ambushers.</p>

<p>In the dusk the merry conflict waged up and down the snow-covered
lawn, and the combatants threw and threw, or surged back and forth,
or clenched and toppled over into snow banks, yet all coming to
chant an extemporized battle-cry in chorus, even as they fought
the most wildly.</p>

<p>"Who? Who? Who?" they chanted. "Who? Who? <em>Who</em> says there
ain't goin' to be no war?"</p>
