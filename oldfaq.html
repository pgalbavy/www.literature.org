    <H2>Frequently Asked Questions</H2>

    <P><B>Before sending e-mail, please read this. Most of the common
    questions that people e-mail to us are answered here. </B>

    Please note that we do not have time to respond to common
    questions like those in the FAQ - we do however appreciate
    comments on the site in general or original questions that are not
    just asking us to help with your homework.

    <p>Before reporting any other problems with this server, please
    note that one of our most frequently asked questions or problem
    reports is when a page or chapter from a book doesn't appear
    correctly. Please try <b>forcing</b> your web browser to reload
    the page by pressing the Shift <i>or</i> Control key and the
    Refresh/Reload button with your mouse - depending on your
    browser. Thanks.

    <P>Readers do e-mail us with requests for further information
    about particular books, whether they can copy them to local
    servers and so on. I will try to answer some of those questions
    here.

    <h3>"Cliff" Notes</h3>

    <b>PLEASE LET ME MAKE THIS CLEAR</b>: We do NOT have, so we cannot
    send you these so-called "Cliff" notes. As far as we can make out,
    "Cliff" notes are some commercial "cheat at my exam" books
    published only in the USA. We do not come from the USA. Read the
    damned book for crying out loud. Read, learn, think.

    <H3>Where do the books come from ?</H3>

    <p>Most of the books are already in text form by the time they get
    to me. There are a number of very good projects under way on the
    Internet to get books scanned or typed in. A couple of the major
    ones are at <A HREF="http://wiretap.area.com/">Wiretap</A> <b>(NO LONGER THERE)</b>
    and at <A HREF="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenburg</A>.

    <h3>Can I copy your pages ?</h3>

    <p>Yes. Since all the works here are, to the best of my knowledge,
    out of copyright the works are in the public domain. I make
    them available for your pleasure and education - if you can use
    them for some purpose yourself please feel free - after all I
    have only converted text into web pages - the original transcription
    was the main job.

    <h3>I am doing a class project - can you tell me about a book ?</h3>

    <p>No. Sorry - I haven't the time or the information. If you have
    been asked to read and write about a particular work, then please
    try to do it yourself. The reason that you have been set a task in
    class is probably to help you understand some concept. Finding
    quick answers will not help you in the long run.

    <h3>I think I found an error. Will you please fix it ?</h3>

    <p>I will try my best - please e-mail me the details.

    <h3> Where should I send e-mail ? </h3>

    <p>To <a href="mailto:peter@literature.org">peter@literature.org</a>.
