<p>As it was the height of the hunting season, the reports of guns
were heard at varying distances through the woods, so that Sam
could only judge when they were fired by his friends from their
nearness to him.</p>

<p>He was well satisfied that the last shot was from the Remington
of Herbert, while the one that preceded it a few minutes, he was
convinced came from the muzzle-loader of Nick Ribsam, owned by
Mr. Marston.</p>

<p>"The boys seem to have found something too do, but I don't believe
they have seen anything of the bear&mdash;hallo!"</p>

<p>His last exclamation was caused by his unexpected arrival at
a clearing, in the center of which stood a log cabin, while the
half acre surrounding it showed that it had been cultivated during
the season to the highest extent.</p>

<p>There was that air of thrift and cleanliness about the place
which told the lad that whoever lived within was industrious,
frugal, and neat.</p>

<p>"That's a queer place to build a house," said Sam, as he surveyed
the scene; "no one can earn a living there, and it must make a
long walk to reach the neighborhood where work is to be had."</p>

<p>Prompted by a natural curiosity, Sam walked over the faintly
marked path until he stepped upon the piece of hewed log, which
answered for a porch, directly in front of the door.</p>

<p>Although the latch string hung invitingly out, he did not pull
it, but knocked rather gently.</p>

<p>"Come in!" was called out in a female voice, and the boy immediately
opened the door.</p>

<p>A pleasing, neatly-clad young woman was working with her dishes
at a table, while a fat chub of a boy, about two years old, was
playing on the floor with a couple of kittens.</p>

<p>The mother, as she evidently was, turned her head so as to face
the visitor, nodded cheerily, bade him good afternoon, and told
him to help himself to one of the chairs, whose bottoms were made
of white mountain ash, as fine and pliable as silken ribbons.</p>

<p>Sam was naturally courteous, and, thanking the lady for her invitation,
he sat down, placing his cap on his knee. He said he was out on
a hunt with some friends, and coming upon the cabin thought he
would make a call, and learn whether he could be of any service
to the lady and her child.</p>

<p>The mother thanked him, and said that fortunately she was not
in need of any help, as her husband was well and able to provide
her with all she needed.</p>

<p>Without giving the conversation in detail, it may be said that
Sam Harper learned a lesson, during his brief stay in that humble
cabin, which will go with him through life: it was a lesson of
cheerfulness and contentment, to which he often refers, and which
makes him thankful that he was led to turn aside from his sport
even for a short while.</p>

<p>The husband of the woman worked for a farmer who lived fully
four miles away, on the northern edge of the woods, and who paid
only scant wages. The employee walked the four miles out so as
to reach the farm by seven o'clock in the morning, and he did
not leave until six in the evening. He did this summer and winter,
through storm and sunshine, and was happy.</p>

<p>He lived in the lonely log cabin, because his employer owned
it and gave him the rent free. It had been erected by some wood-choppers
several years before, and was left by them when through with their
contract, so that it was nothing to any one who did not occupy
it.</p>

<p>The young man, although now the embodiment of rugged health and
strength, had lain on a bed of sickness for six months, during
which he hovered between life and death. His wife never left his
side during that time for more than a few minutes, and the physician
was scarcely less faithful. At last the wasting fever vanished,
and the husband and father came back to health and strength again.</p>

<p>But he was in debt to the extent of $200, and he and his wife
determined on the most rigid economy until the last penny should
be paid.</p>

<p>"If Fred keeps his health," said the cheery woman, "we shall
be out of debt at the end of two years more. Won't you bring your
friends and stay with us to-night?"</p>

<p>This invitation was given with great cordiality, and Sam would
have been glad to accept it, but he declined, through consideration
for the brave couple, who would certainly be put to inconvenience
by entertaining three visitors.</p>

<p>Sam thanked her for her kindness, and, rising to go, drew back
the door and remarked:</p>

<p>"I notice you have a good rifle over the mantle; I don't see
how your husband can get much time to use it."</p>

<p>"He doesn't; it is I who shoot the game, which saves half the
cost of food; but," added the plucky little woman, "there is one
game which I am very anxious to bring down."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"<em>A bear.</em>"</p>

<p>"Do you know whether there are any in the woods?"</p>

<p>"There is one, and I think more. My husband has seen it twice,
and he took the gun with him when going to work, in the hope of
gaining a chance to shoot it; but, when I caught sight of it on
the edge of the clearing, he thought it best to leave the rifle
for me to use."</p>

<p>"Why are you so anxious to shoot the bear?" asked Sam.</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't a very pleasant neighbor, and I have to keep
little Tommy in the house all the time for fear the brute will
seize him. Then, beside that, the bear has carried off some of
Mr. Bailey's (that's the man my husband works for) pigs, and has
so frightened his family that Mr. Bailey said he would give us
twenty dollars for the hide of every bear we brought him."</p>

<p>"I hope it may be your fortune to shoot all in the woods," said
Sam, as he bade her good-day again, and passed out and across
the clearing into the forest.</p>

<p>"That's about the bravest woman I ever saw," said the lad to
himself, as he moved thoughtfully in the direction of the limestone-rock,
where it was agreed the three should meet to spend the night;
"she ought to win, and if this crowd of bear hunters succeed in
bagging the old fellow we will present him to her."</p>

<p>The thought was a pleasing one to Sam, who walked a short way
farther, when he added, with a grim smile, "But I don't think
that bear will lose any night's sleep on account of being disturbed
by <em>this</em> crowd."</p>
