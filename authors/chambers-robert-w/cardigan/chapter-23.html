<p>Like a red lamp the sun swung above the smoky east, its round,
inflamed lens peering through the smother beneath which Boston
lay, blanketed by the thick vapours of the bay.</p>

<p>From my window I could distinguish the shadowy ship-yards close
by. Northeast, across Green Lane, lay the Mill Pond, sheeted in
mist, separated from the bay by an indented causeway.</p>

<p>On Corps Hill the paling signal-fires went out, one by one; a
green light twinkled aloft in the dusky tangle of a war-ship's
rigging; the smoky beacon in its iron basket flared, sank, glimmered,
and went out.</p>

<p>Across the street, through the white mist lifting, spectral warehouses
loomed, every shutter locked, iron gates dripping rust.</p>

<p>Jack Mount came in, and sat down on the edge of the bed with
a silent nod of greeting, clasping his large hands between his
knees.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking of that damned thief-taker," he said, yawning.
"If he's tracked me from Pitt he's a good dog, and his wife should
cast a prime dropper some day."</p>

<p>A servant brought us a bowl of stirabout and some rusks and salted
codfish, and we breakfasted there in my chamber, scarcely speaking.
Instead of exultation at my nearness to Silver Heels, a foreboding
had weighed on me since first I unclosed my eyes. The depression
deepened as I sat brooding by the window where the white sea-fog
rolled against the sweating panes. Mount ate in silence; I could
scarcely swallow any food. Presently I pushed away my plate, drew
paper and ink before me, and fell to composing a letter. From
the tap-room below a boy came to bring us our morning cups, and
we washed the salty tang from our throats. Mount lighted his yard
of clay and lay back, puffing smoke at the smeared window-panes.
I wrote slowly, drinking at intervals.</p>

<p>The morning draught refreshed us; and when at length sunshine
broke out over the bay, something of our dormant spirits stirred
to greet it.</p>

<p>"How silent is the world outside," said I, listening to the sea-birds'
mewing, and mending my quill with my hunting-knife.</p>

<p>"Misery breeds silence," he said.</p>

<p>"Are men starving here around us?" I asked, trying to realize
what I had heard.</p>

<p>"Ay, and dying of it. The sun yonder no longer signals breakfast
for Boston. Better finish your fish while you may."</p>

<p>He pulled slowly at his pipe. "If I am right," he drawled, "it
would be close to mid-day now in England&mdash;the King's dinner-hour.
His Majesty should be greasing his chin with hot goose-gravy."</p>

<p>His blue eyes began to shine; the long pipe-stem snapped short
between forefinger and thumb; the smoking bowl dropped, and he
set his moccasined heel upon it, grinding clay and fire into the
stone floor. I watched him for a moment, and then resumed my writing.</p>

<p>"God save the King," he sneered, "and smear his maw thick with
good fat meat! Let the rebel babes o' Boston die snivelling at
their rebel mothers' dried-up breasts! It's a merry life, Cardigan.
I dreamed last night a naked skeleton rode through Boston streets
a-beating a jolly ringadoon on his bones:</p>

<p>"I must first send my letter," said I; and began to re-read it:</p>

<p>
<em>BOSTON, </em><em>October 29, 1774</em>.

</p>
<p>
"<em>To Mistress Felicity Warren</em>:

</p>
<p>
"<em>DEAR, DEAR SILVER HEELS,<br/>
&</em>mdash;Being cured of my hurts and having<br/>
done with Johnson Hall and my dishonourable kinsman, Sir John<br/>
Johnson, Bart: I now take my pen in hand to acquaint you that<br/>
I know all, how that through the mercy of Providence you have<br/>
been reunited with your hon'rd parents, long supposed to<br/>
have been with God, their name and quality I know not nor<br/>
doubt that it is most honourable. I did think to receive a<br/>
letter from you ere I left the Hall, yet none came, so I<br/>
insulted Sir John and took Warlock who is mine of a right and<br/>
I am come to Boston to pay my respects to y'r hon'rd<br/>
parents and to acquaint them that I mean to wed you as I love<br/>
you my hon'rd cozzen but feel no happiness in as much as a<br/>
deathly fear hath possessed me for some hours that I am never<br/>
again to see you, this same haunting dread that all may not<br/>
be well with you does not subdue and chill those ardent<br/>
sentiments which of a truth burn as hotly now as they burned<br/>
that sweet noonday at Roanoke Plain.

</p>
<p>
"I further acquaint you that my solicitor, Mr. Peter Weaver<br/>
of Albany, hath news that my uncle, Sir Terence Cardigan,<br/>
Bart, is at a low ebb of life being close to his Maker<br/>
through much wine and excesses, and hath sent for me, but I<br/>
would not stir a peg till I have found you dear Silver Heels<br/>
to ask you if you do still love that foolish lad who will<br/>
soon be Sir Michael Cardigan to the world but ever the same<br/>
Micky to you, though if war comes to us I doubt not that my<br/>
title and estate will be confiscated in as much as I shall<br/>
embrace the cause of the colonies and do what harm I may to<br/>
the soldiers of our King.

</p>
<p>
"My sweet Silver Heels, this letter is to be delivered to y'r<br/>
solicitor Mr. Thomas Foxcroft and by him instantly into your<br/>
own hands, there being nothing in it not honourable and<br/>
proper. I strive in vain to shake off the depression which so<br/>
weighs down my heart that it is heavy with the dread that all<br/>
may not be well with you, for I do distrust Sir John his<br/>
word, and I do despise him heartily and deem it strange that<br/>
he did conduct you to Boston under pretence of a business<br/>
affair which he has since refused to discuss with me.

</p>
<p>
"Dear maid, if y'r honourable parents will permit, I shall<br/>
this day venture to present myself and formally demand your<br/>
hand in that sweet alliance which even death cannot end but<br/>
must perforce render immortal for all time.

</p>
<p>
"Your faithful and obedient<br/>
"servant and devoted lover<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<em>MICHAEL CARDIGAN</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>The writing of this letter comforted me. I directed it to "Miss
Warren, in care of Mr. Thomas Foxcroft, to be delivered immediately,"
and summoning a servant, charged him to bear it instantly to Mr.
Foxcroft.</p>

<p>"It is but a step to Queen Street," I said to the lank lad; "so
if by chance the young lady herself be living there, you shall
wait her pleasure and bring me my answer." And I gave him three
bright shillings fresh struck from the mint that year.</p>

<p>"You will go with me, Jack?" I asked, as the messenger vanished.</p>

<p>Mount, sprawling by the window, turned his massive head towards
me like a sombre-eyed mastiff.</p>

<p>"Daylight is no friend o' mine," he said, slowly. "In Boston
here they peddle ballads about me and Cade; and some puling quill-mender
has writ a book about me, the same bearing a gallows on the cover."</p>

<p>"Then you had best stay here," I said; "I can manage very well
alone, Jack."</p>

<p>"Once," continued Mount, thoughtfully, polishing his hatchet
on his buckskin breeches&mdash;"once I went strolling on the Neck,
yonder, and no thought o' the highway either, when a large, fat
man came a-waddling with two servants, and a pair o' saddle-bags
as fat as the man, every bit."</p>

<p>He licked his lips and slowly turned his eyes away from mine.</p>

<p>"The moon was knee-high over the salt-grass," he continued; "the
devil's in the moon when it's knee-high."</p>

<p>"So you robbed him," I added, disgusted. Mount glanced guiltily
around the room&mdash;anywhere but at me.</p>

<p>"I only asked him what his saddle-bags might weigh," he muttered,
"and the fat fool bawled, 'Thief! Help!' If he had not put it
in my mind to scotch him!&mdash;but the great booby must out with his
small-sword and call up his men. So, when he fell a-roaring that
he was a King's magistrate&mdash;why&mdash;why, I rubbed a pistol under
his nose. And would you believe it, lad, the next thing I knew,
Cade and I could scarce walk for the weight o' the half-crowns
in our breeches-pockets! It amazes me even yet&mdash;it does indeed!"</p>

<p>"You'd best look to your neck, then," I said, shortly. "Remember
Bishop's buxom daughter on the Philadelphia coach last night.
Where the kitten runs the catamount prowls."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll take the air by night," observed Mount, with perfect
good-humour. "The night air o' Boston is famous medicine for troubles
like mine."</p>

<p>"You will do no more tricks on the highway?" I demanded, suspiciously.</p>

<p>He buried his nose in a pot of beer without replying. An hour
passed in silence, save for the continual trotting to and fro
of the boy from the tap-room, bearing deep, frothing tankards
for Mount.</p>

<p>"Have a care," I said, at length; "if you drink like that you'll
be out and abroad and into every foolish mischief, as you were
in Pittsburg. Be a man, Jack!"</p>

<p>"I'm all salty inside like a split herring," he said, reaching
for a fresh pewter, and blowing the foam till it scattered over
the floor like flakes of snow.</p>

<p>Two hours had dragged on towards their finish, and already the
clocks in the tavern were tolling the death of another hour, when
my lank messenger came breathless to the door with a letter for
me, and at the first glance I saw that the writing was the hand
of Silver Heels herself.</p>

<p>Mount gaped at me, then one of his rare and delicate instincts
moved him to withdraw. I heard him leave the room, but did not
heed his going, for I was already deep in the pages of the letter:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"<em>DEAR LAD, MY OLD COMRADE,<br/>
&</em>mdash;Mr. Foxcroft did summon me to<br/>
consider your letter of last evening, how it were best to<br/>
inform you of what you should know.

</p>
<p>
"Now comes your letter of this morning by your messenger, and<br/>
leaves me a-tremble to breathe its perfume of the love which<br/>
I had, days since, resigned.

</p>
<p>
"For I did write you constantly to Johnstown in care of Sir<br/>
John, and no answer came save one, from Sir John, saying you<br/>
cared not to answer me my letters. This cruel insult from Sir<br/>
John could not have been the truth in light of the letter now<br/>
folded in my bosom, and softly rustling nestled against my<br/>
breast.

</p>
<p>
"But it is plain to me, dear heart, that you as yet know<br/>
nothing of what great change has come to me. And so, before I<br/>
dare give you the answer which burns my mouth and thrills<br/>
this poor body o' mine which aches for you, I must, for<br/>
honour's sake, reveal to you what manner of maid you would<br/>
now court, and into what desperate conditions I am come; not<br/>
that I doubt you, Michael, dear soul of chivalry and tender<br/>
truth!

</p>
<p>
"Know then, my friend, that I am hopelessly poor in this<br/>
world's goods; know, too, that the new name I bear is a name<br/>
marked for pity or contempt by those few who have not long<br/>
since forgotten it. It is the death of my pride to say this.<br/>
Yet I say it.

</p>
<p>
"My father is old and broken. His faculties have failed; he<br/>
is like a child who forgets what his tongue utters, even<br/>
while voicing his harmless desires. His property is gone; he<br/>
does not know it. He sees around him the shadows of the past;<br/>
he talks with the dead as though they sat at his elbow.

</p>
<p>
"His house is an empty shell; his lands have grown into<br/>
thickets; his estate is lost to him through taxes long<br/>
unpaid. Yet everywhere the phantoms of dead scenes surround<br/>
him; ghosts walk with him through spectral domains, ride with<br/>
him to hounds, carry his colours to victory on the<br/>
race-course, sit with him at table, pour water for him which,<br/>
in his wrapped eyes, bubbles like wine.

</p>
<p>
"Believe me, dear friend, it is pitiful and sad&mdash;sad past all<br/>
I have ever known.

</p>
<p>
"For me, too, it is so strange, so hopeless, that, even after<br/>
these long days, it is still an untrue dream from which I<br/>
seem too weary and stunned to rouse and drive the gray vision<br/>
from me.

</p>
<p>
"Long ago, in a distant year of sunlight, I remember a child<br/>
called Silver Heels, whose mad desire for rank and power<br/>
crammed her silly head, till, of a sweet May day, love came<br/>
to her. Love drove her to folly; love reclaimed her; love<br/>
lies still in her heart, watching for you with tireless eyes.

</p>
<p>
"Dear heart, would you take me? Even after all you now know?<br/>
Do you want me, Michael?&mdash;me?&mdash;when all the world lies before<br/>
you?

</p>
<p>
"I once most wickedly said that if I had been humbly born, I<br/>
would not for my pride's sake wed with you. It is not true,<br/>
Michael; I will wed with you. But, if after what you have<br/>
learned, you care no longer to wed me, do not write me; do<br/>
not come to give me reasons.

</p>
<p>
"Mr. Foxcroft attends me. We will await you at his house, at<br/>
noon, and if you come&mdash;as, God help me I believe you<br/>
will&mdash;then I shall teach you what a maid's love can mean. Oh,<br/>
to have you again, as I held you those long days on the<br/>
trail; but you were too near death to know it!&mdash;too close to<br/>
death to hear all I promised you if only you would live!

</p>
<p>
"<em>FELICITY</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>"Mount!" I cried, all of a-tremble, "I shall wed this noon! Get
me a parson, man!" And I began tearing off my buckskins and flinging
them right and left, shouting for Jack the while, and dressing
in my finest linen and my silver-gray velvet.</p>

<p>Now choking with the tears that I could not crush back, now smiling
at the sunlight which yellowed the white walls of my chamber,
I shouted at intervals for Mount, until the tap-boy came to say
that Mount had gone out. So I bade the tap-boy hasten forth and
buy me a large nosegay with streamers, and fetch it to me instantly;
and then returned to my toilet with a feverish haste that defeated
its own purpose.</p>

<p>At last, however, I hung my sword, dusted the hair-powder from
frill and ruffle, buckled shoon and knees, and shook out the long
soft lace over my cuffs. Then I found the ring I had bought in
Albany, and placed it in my silver-webbed waistcoat with its flowered
flaps of orange silk.</p>

<p>The inn clocks chimed for ten as the lad brought me a huge nosegay
all fluttering with white silken streamers.</p>

<p>"Where is my companion?" I asked, red as a poppy under his grins.</p>

<p>"Below, sir," replied the lad, hesitating.</p>

<p>"Drunk?" I demanded, angrily.</p>

<p>"Tolerable," said the lad.</p>

<p>With that I seized my nosegay, set my small French hat on my
head, and went down the side stairway to the street.</p>

<p>Mount, swaggering on the tap-room porch, spied me and rubbed
his startled eyes. But I seized him by the painted cape of his
fox-trimmed hunting-shirt, and jerked him to and fro savagely.</p>

<p>"Idiot! Tippler! Pottle-pot!" I cried, in a rage. "I'm to be
married&mdash;d'ye hear? Married! Married! Get me a parson! Take my
nosegay! So! Now walk behind me as if you knew what decent folk
are accustomed to do at a sudden wedding!"</p>

<p>"How can I get you a parson if I'm to march here behind you,
bearing this nosegay?" he remonstrated, sidling away towards the
tavern again.</p>

<p>"You stay where you are!" I said; then I called a servant and
bade him find a parson to go instantly to the house of Thomas
Foxcroft in Queen Street, and there await my coming.</p>

<p>Mount, almost sobered, through sheer astonishment, regarded me
wildly.</p>

<p>"Jack, old friend," I said, in a burst of happiness, "I've found
her, and she will be my wife by noon! Give me joy, Jack!&mdash;and
mind that nosegay, idiot! Hold it aloft, else the streamers will
trail in the dust! Now, then! Follow me! Gingerly, idiot, gingerly!"</p>

<p>And away I marched, scarce knowing what I did in my excitement,
but turning now and again to see that Mount followed, bearing
the nosegay with proper care.</p>

<p>"If you are to be wedded at noon," he said, timidly, as we were
hurrying through Cambridge Street, "what are we going to do until
then&mdash;walk the streets like this? Lord, what a fool I feel!"</p>

<p>I stopped short. It was quite true that I was not expected at
Mr. Foxcroft's before noon, and it was now but ten o'clock or
a little after.</p>

<p>"I can't sit still in that tavern," I said. "Let us walk, Jack.
Two hours are quickly past. Come, step beside me&mdash;and mind those
ribbons! Jack! I am mad with happiness!"</p>

<p>"Then let us drink to it," suggested Mount, but I jerked him
to my side, and scarcely knowing what to do or where to go, started
on, with the vague idea of circling the city in a triumphal march.</p>

<p>I shall never forget my first glimpse of the city by daylight:
its brick houses streaked with sea-fog, its bare wooden wharves
glimmering in the sunshine, as Mount and I passed through Lyna
Street and out along the water by Lee's ship-yard and Waldo's
Wharf.</p>

<p>Northward across the misty water the roofs and steeples of Charlestown
reddened in the sun; to the west the cannon on Corps Hill glittered,
pointing seaward over the Northwest Water Mill. From somewhere
in the city came the beating of drums and the faint squealing
of fifes; the lion banner of England flapped from Beacon Hill;
white tents crowned the summit of Valley Acre; the ashes of the
beacon smoked.</p>

<p>In the northwestern portion of the city the quiet of death reigned;
there was not a sign of life in the streets; the wooden houses
were closed and darkened; the ship-yards and wharves deserted;
not a living soul was to be seen abroad. Mount's noiseless moccasined
tread awoke no echoes, but my smart heels clattered as we turned
southeast through squalid Hawkins Street, through Sudbury, Hanover,
Wings Lane, Dock Square, by the Town Dock, and then south, past
the Long Wharf and Battery Marsh, above which, on Fort Hill, another
British flag rippled against the blue sky.</p>

<p>"The damned rag flies high to-day," muttered Mount.</p>

<p>"Are you not done with cursing it?" I said, impatiently. "This
is no day for bitterness."</p>

<p>"It's a slave's flag," retorted Mount&mdash;"parry that!"</p>

<p>"It flew for centuries above free men; let that plead for it!"
I answered.</p>

<p>There was an inn on Milk Street, near Bishop's Alley, and the
first open house we had encountered. Mount, before I could prevent
him, had nosed out the tap-room, and I followed perforce, although
I knew well enough that it was an ill-advised proceeding, the
place being full of British soldiery and Mount in a quarrelsome
mood.</p>

<p>The soldiers eyed Mount and his nosegay askance, and Mount cocked
his fox-skin cap and ruffled it offensively, outstaring the most
insolent of them. But presently, to my relief, the soldiers left
without accepting the opportunity for a quarrel, and Mount, somewhat
dejected, refilled his glass and emptied it, with a disagreeable
laugh. Then we went out by way of Winter Street to the Mall, Jack
bearing my nosegay as though it had been a hostile ensign to flaunt
before all England.</p>

<p>There seemed to be many people abroad on Common Street; the shops
were open all along Treamount and King streets, and the Boston
citizens went about their affairs as soberly and quietly as though
the city were not choking to death with England's heavy fist at
its throat.</p>

<p>As for the Boston people, they resembled our good townsmen of
Tryon County somewhat, though their clothes were of a more elegant
cut, and even the snuffiest of them wore lace and buckles. Their
limbs and features, however, appeared long and thin, a characteristic
I had already noticed in New England folk.</p>

<p>Through the double rows of trees I could see the tents of the
marines pitched on the Mall, and beyond them a park of artillery
and some low redoubts. Soldiers were passing everywhere: here
a company marching to the drum across the Common, black gaiters
twinkling; there a squadron of Light Horse, in blue and silver,
riding, two abreast, to their barracks on George Street. Anon
comes a company of red-necked Highlanders, bagpipes squawling,
and it made me think of Johnson Hall to see their bare shins passing,
sporrans a-swing, and the crawling whine of their pipes in my
ears.</p>

<p>I looked at my watch; it was eleven o'clock. Mount and I leaned
back against the railing of the south burying-ground, watching
the busy life of the camp on the Common. I had never before seen
so many soldiers together, nor such a brilliant variety of uniforms.
The towns-people, too, lingered to watch the soldiers, some sullenly,
some indifferently, some in open enjoyment. These latter were
doubtless Tories, for in their faces one could not mistake the
expression of sneering triumph. Also many of them talked to the
soldiers, which earned them unconcealed scowls from passing citizens.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mount, "have you seen enough of the lobster-backs?
The sight of them," he continued, raising his voice, "sours my
stomach, and I care not who knows it."</p>

<p>Several people near us looked at him.</p>

<p>"Keep quiet!" I said, sharply. "I have no desire to spend the
day in the provost cell yonder. Can you not remember what this
day means to me?"</p>

<p>Mount shrugged his broad shoulders, lighted his pipe, and sat
down on the grass under a tall elm.</p>

<p>"Sit beside me, lad," he said, "and I'll tell you all about these
gay birds, and how to know them by their plumage. Mark! Yonder
comes an officer in black and scarlet, wearing a single gold epaulette
and a gold gorget, with the royal arms in gold on his white baldric.
That's the royal artillery, Mr. Cardigan. That gay old buck beside
him is a colonel of foot. He's all scarlet trimmed up with yellow
and white. Most of them wear white breeches and black gaiters.
There! That fellow in blue and silver, with orange cuffs and top-boots,
is a trooper of Light Horse. See the steel head-piece with its
roll of bear-skin and the orange plume on the left side. Some
of 'em wear red cuffs and plumes, but you can tell them by their
laced blue vests and jack-boots, and the officers by white baldrics
and two silver epaulettes."</p>

<p>"What is that fellow there with the bear-skin cap and white plume
and tassels?" I asked, with a pretence of interest which in my
anxiety and excitement I could not feel. The splendid uniform
which I pointed out glittered in stripes of silver and pale blue
embroidery over a scarlet coat.</p>

<p>"That lad is a drummer of the Grenadiers," said Mount. "The soldier
beside him with the green facings and green-and-gold stock is
one of the Twenty-fourth Foot&mdash;a sergeant by his baldric and cross-spear.
Oh, they're gay and godless, as the Weasel would say&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused and looked down. The slightest tremor twitched his
underlip. I laid my hand lightly on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," he said, "I'm lost without him&mdash;I don't know what to
do &mdash;I don't know. I see him in my sleep; he comes in dreams
o' the woods. I wake laughing at his dry jests, and find my face
twisted wi' tears. There's never a leaf stirs on a bough but I
listen for Cade's padded footfall behind me; there's never a free
wind blows but I hark for his voice a-calling me back to the sweet
green forest and the spice o' the birch camp-fire. Lad! lad! He's
dead and buried these long weeks, and I am but a weird-hound on
a spectre trail, dogging his wraith."</p>

<p>We sat there on the grass watching the marines drilling; the
artillery trotted clanking past for exercise at the Fox Hill redoubt,
and presently we heard the dull boom-booming of their cannon along
the west shore of the bay.</p>

<p>"They even shoot at the rebel fishes," sneered Mount, raising
his voice for the benefit of his neighbours.</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet impatiently, adjusted my sword, and dusted
the skirts of my coat.</p>

<p>"It's not half-past eleven yet," observed Mount.</p>

<p>"I don't care," I muttered; "I shall go to Queen Street now.
Come, Jack! I cannot endure this delay, I tell you."</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>

<p>"Come, Jack," I repeated, turning around to summon him. "What
are you staring at, man?"</p>

<p>As I spoke a roughly clad man pushed in between me and Mount,
swinging a knobbed stick; another man followed, then another.
Mount had leaped to his feet and backed up to my side.</p>

<p>"It's Billy Bishop's gang!" he said, thickly. "Leave me, lad,
or they'll take us both!"</p>

<p>Before I could comprehend what was on foot, half a dozen men
suddenly surrounded Mount, and silently began to close in on him.</p>

<p>"Go!" muttered Mount, fiercely, pushing me violently from him.</p>

<p>"No, you don't!" said a cool voice at my elbow; "we want the
Weasel, too, for all his fine clothes!"</p>

<p>The next instant a man in a red neck-cloth had seized my hands
in a grip of iron, and, ere I knew what had happened, he clapped
the gyves on one of my wrists. With a cry of rage and amazement
I tore at my manacled hand, and, partly helpless as I was, I sprang
at the fellow. He struck me a fierce blow with his cudgel, and
ran around the edge of the swaying knot of human figures which
was slowly bearing Mount to the ground.</p>

<p>Then Mount rose, hurling the pack from him, and striking right
and left with his huge arms. I saw the nosegay fly into a shower
of blossoms, and the silken ribbons flutter down under the trampling
feet.</p>

<p>For a moment I caught Mount's eye, as he stood like a deeply
breathing bull at bay, then swinging the steel manacle which was
locked on my right wrist, I beat my way to Mount's side, and faced
the thief-taker and his bailiffs.</p>

<p>They rushed us against the fence of the burying-ground, bruising
us with their heavy cudgels, and knocking the war-hatchet from
Mount's fist. I had my sword out, but could not use it, the manacles
on my wrist clogging the guard and confusing me. In the uproar
around us I heard cries of: "Death to the highwaymen!" "Kill the
rogues!" A vast crowd was surging up on all sides; soldiers drew
their hangers and pushed their way to the side of the baffled
bailiffs.</p>

<p>"Give up, Jack Mount!" cried the stout man with the red neck-cloth&mdash;"give
up, in the King's name! It's all over with you now! I've run you
from Johnstown on a broad trail, God wot! and I want your brush
and pads, old fox!"</p>

<p>Mount displayed his broad knife coolly. The sunlight played over
the blade of the murderous weapon; the crowd around us broke into
a swelling roar.</p>

<p>Suddenly a soldier struck heavily at Mount with his hanger, but
Mount sent the sword whirling with the broad, short blade in his
hand.</p>

<p>"If you'll let this gentleman go, I'll give up," said Mount,
sullenly. "Answer me, Billy Bishop!"</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Bishop, in a bantering voice, "we know all
about this gentleman, Jack. Don't you worry; we'll take care he
has a view of the Roxbury Cross-road as well as you!"</p>

<p>The taunt of the cross-roads gallows transformed Mount into a
demon. He hurled his huge bulk at the solid mass of people; I
followed, making what play I could with my small-sword, but in
a moment I was down in the dust, blood pouring from my face, groping
blindly for the enemies who were already clapping the irons on
my other wrist.</p>

<p>Through the roar and tumult of frantic voices I was dragged into
a stony street, crushed into the pit of a crowd, which hurried
me on resistlessly. White, excited faces looked into mine; hundreds
of clinched fists tossed above the dense masses on either side.
Again and again I plunged at those who drove me, but they thrust
me onward. Far ahead in the throng I saw the head and shoulders
of Jack Mount overtopping them all.</p>

<p>The mob halted at a cross-street to allow a cavalcade of horsemen
to pass. Above the heads of the people I could see the cavalry
riding, sabres bared, the riders glancing curiously down at the
rabble and its prisoners. A coach passed, escorted by dragoons;
a gentleman looked out to seek the reason of the uproar. From
his coach window his head leaned so close to me that I could have
touched it. The gentleman was Walter Butler.</p>

<p>"A thief, sir," cried a bailiff; "taken by Bishop on the Mall.
Would your lordship be pleased to see his comrade, the notorious
Jack Mount?"</p>

<p>"Drive on," said Butler, impassively. Then the crowd began to
hoot and jeer as the bailiffs pushed me forward once more through
the dust of Cornhill up Queen Street.</p>

<p>And so, crushed by the awful disgrace which had fallen on me,
writhing, resisting, dishevelled, I was forced into the Court-house
on Queen Street, across the yard, and into the gates of the prison,
which crashed behind me, drowning the roars of the people in my
stunned ears.</p>
