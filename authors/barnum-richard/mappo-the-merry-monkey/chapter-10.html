<p>Mappo, as soon as he got outside the traveling circus cage on wheels,
looked all about him to see if any one were watching him. But no one
seemed to be doing so.
</p><p>His man friend, who had trained him to do many tricks, was riding on the
seat with the driver of the big monkey-cage wagon, and this man never
looked around, as Mappo slipped out. All the other circus men were too
busy to look after one monkey.
</p><p>Mappo slipped down to the dusty country road, along which the circus
procession was then going, and quickly running across it, the merry
little monkey hid in the bushes on the other side.
</p><p>Slowly the big circus wagons rumbled past the place where Mappo was
hiding in the bushes. When the cage, in which Sharp-Tooth, the tiger,
was pacing up and down, came along, the big striped beast growled and
roared, and to Mappo it sounded just as if he were saying:
</p><p>"Where's that monkey? Oh, wait until I get hold of him! He wouldn't let
me out of my cage, and I'll fix him!"
</p><p>When the last wagon in, the procession had gone past--and it was the
steam piano which brought up at the end--Mappo breathed a long breath.
</p><p>"Now I'm all right!" he thought. "They can't find me now. I'm going over
into those woods. Maybe there is a jungle where I can find cocoanuts."
</p><p>Scrambling over rocks, stones and fences, Mappo made his way to the big
woods. It looked cool and green there, much better than the hot, dusty
road, down which the circus procession was rumbling, with the big red,
green and gold wagons.
</p><p>Mappo was much disappointed when he reached the woods. He could not see
any cocoanuts or bananas, and those were the things he liked best of
all.
</p><p>"I wonder what I shall eat," said Mappo, for he was quite hungry.
</p><p>He ran about, climbing trees, going away up to the top, and hanging down
by his tail. He had not had a chance to do this since he had been with
the circus, and, really, it was lots of fun for him.
</p><p>Soon he felt hungry again, and he looked around for something to chew.
He saw nothing.
</p><p>"Oh dear!" he cried out loud. "I wonder what I can eat."
</p><p>"Ha!" cried a grunting little voice near him, "why don't you eat acorns,
as I do?"
</p><p>"What's that? Who are you? Where are you?" asked Mappo, looking up and
down.
</p><p>"Here I am, under this bush," the voice went on, and out walked a little
pig.
</p><p>"What's your name?" asked Mappo.
</p><p>"My name is Squinty," answered the little pig. I suppose you had guessed
that before I told you--at least those of you who have read my other
book, called "Squinty, the Comical Pig."
</p><p>"Squinty, eh?" remarked Mappo. "That's a queer name."
</p><p>"They call me that because one of my eyes squints," said the little pig.
"See!" and he looked up at Mappo in such a funny way, with one eye half
shut, and the other wide open, and with one ear cocked forward and the
other backward, that Mappo had to laugh.
</p><p>"My name is Mappo, and I'm from the circus. I've run away, and I'm
hungry," the monkey said.
</p><p>"Ha! I'm running away myself," said Squinty, "and I was hungry too, but
I found some acorns to eat."
</p><p>"What are acorns, and where did you run from?" asked Mappo.
</p><p>"Acorns are nuts, good for pigs to eat," Squinty answered, "and I ran
away from my pen."
</p><p>"I wish I had something to eat," said Mappo. "I am very hungry."
</p><p>"Come with me, and I'll see if I can't find you something to eat,"
Squinty said. "Then you can tell me all about the circus, and I'll tell
you all about my pen."
</p><p>"All right," agreed Mappo, and the two little animal friends went off
together into the woods.
</p><p>"Are there any cocoanuts here?" asked Mappo, when they had gone on for
some distance.
</p><p>"I don't know," answered Squinty. "What are cocoanuts?"
</p><p>Mappo told the little pig how cocoanuts and bananas grew in the jungle,
and the little pig told about how he liked sour milk and things like
that. And, after a while, they managed to find some berries for Mappo to
eat, as he did not like the acorn nuts.
</p><p>The two friends went on in the woods for some distance, and they were
having a good time, telling each other about their adventures, when,
all of a sudden, as Mappo was swinging along by his tail on a tree
branch, he stopped short and cried:
</p><p>"Ha! They're after me. I guess I'd better run."
</p><p>"Who is after you?" asked Squinty.
</p><p>"The circus men. They must have found out I ran away."
</p><p>Mappo and Squinty looked through the bushes, and they saw a number of
men in red coats and blue trousers coming through the woods. Squinty
also saw something else.
</p><p>"Oh, look!" cried the little pig. "What is that funny animal with two
tails? I'm afraid of him, he's so big!"
</p><p>Mappo looked and laughed.
</p><p>"He hasn't two tails," he said. "One is his tail and the other is his
trunk. That is Tum Tum, the circus elephant. And you needn't be afraid
of him, for he is the jolliest elephant in the whole show.
</p><p>"But I'm not going to be caught," went on Mappo. "I want to run away
farther, and have more adventures. So I guess I'll go before Tum Tum and
the men see me. Good-by, Squinty. I'm glad I met you."
</p><p>"And I'm glad that I met you," said the comical little pig. Then he ran
one way through the woods, for he did not want to be caught, either,
and Mappo ran the other way.
</p><p>On and on through the woods roamed the merry little monkey, and many
things happened to him. He met Slicko, the jumping girl squirrel, and in
the book about Slicko you may read all about her wonderful adventures.
</p><p>At first Mappo had lots of fun, after running away from the circus. It
was warm, and he managed to make himself a little house of leaves, in
the woods where he slept nights, or when it rained. But, for all that,
he did not have as good things to eat as he had had when he was in his
cage. He missed doing his tricks, too, and he missed seeing the boys and
girls and their parents, in the big tent.
</p><p>One day, as Mappo was asleep in the woods, he was suddenly awakened by
feeling himself caught by two hands, and a voice cried:
</p><p>"Oh, I've caught a monkey. I'm going to take him home and keep him. Oh,
a real, live monkey!"
</p><p>Mappo opened his eyes, and he saw that a boy was holding him, and
holding him so tightly that the little monkey could not get away.
</p><p>"Well, I'm caught!" thought Mappo, but he was not very sorry.
