<p>The others had seen the same object which so startled Bohunkus.
Several hundred feet up in the air and slightly to the north,
the gleam of a red light showed. It was moving slowly in the direction
of the three, all of whom were standing and studying it with wondering
curiosity. It was as if some aerial wanderer was flourishing a
danger lantern through the realms of space.</p>

<p>"What can it be?" asked Abisha Wharton in an awed voice.</p>

<p>Not knowing the proper answer, Harvey Hamilton held his peace,
but Bohunkus had an explanation ready.</p>

<p>"It am de comet!" he exclaimed, having in mind the celestial
visitor named in honor of Halley the astronomer, over which the
world had been stirred a short time before; "it hab broke loose
and is gwine to hit de airth; we’d better dodge."</p>

<p>And he plunged into the house, where the wife had lighted a candle
and set it on the table in the front room. The others left him
to his own devices while they kept their eyes on the mysterious
visitant to the upper world.</p>

<p>They saw that the light was moving in a circle a hundred feet
in diameter, and gradually descending. Whatever connection anything
else had with it was invisible in the gloom. If the peculiar motion
continued, it must come down in the clearing where Harvey’s biplane
had settled to rest some time before.</p>

<p>Suddenly a fanlike stream of light shot out from a point directly
above the crimson glow. It darted here and there, whisked over
the small plain, flitted above the treetops and then flashed into
the faces of the two persons who were standing side by side.</p>

<p>"It’s another aeroplane!" cried Harvey; "it carries a searchlight
and the man is hunting a spot to land."</p>

<p>At this juncture, Bohunkus’s curiosity got the better of him.
He came timidly to the open door and peeped out.</p>

<p>"Hab it struck yet?" he asked; "it’ll be mighty bad when it swipes
yo’ alongside de head. Better come in here——"</p>

<p>At that instant the blinding ray hit the dusky youth in the face,
and with another gasp of affright, he dashed to the farthest corner
of the room, where he cowered in trembling expectancy.</p>

<p>[Illustration: A <em>FANLIKE STREAM OF LIGHT SHOT OUT</em>.]</p>

<p>The couple outside were too much absorbed in what they saw to
give heed to him.</p>

<p>"You’re right," said Wharton; "it’s an aeroplane and the aviator
means to alight."</p>

<p>The searchlight continued darting here and there, but the spreading
glow finally settled upon the ground near where the biplane stood
silent and motionless.</p>

<p>"It is unaccountable that it makes no noise. Look!"</p>

<p>The aviator now demonstrated that he was an expert in the management
of his machine. He oscillated downward, zig-zagging to the right
and left, until he gently touched the earth and the wheels running
a short distance settled to rest. The searchlight flitted toward
different points several times and then was abruptly extinguished.
Harvey and Wharton walked across the ground toward the machine.
Before they reached it, they made out the dim forms of a monoplane
and a man standing beside it. To the youth he was the tallest
and slimmest person he had ever seen. His stature must have been
six and a half feet and in common language he was as thin as a
rail. He had observed the approach of the two and silently awaited
them.</p>

<p>"Good evening!" saluted Harvey, who was slightly in advance of
his companion.</p>

<p>"How do you do, sir?"</p>

<p>The voice would have won an engagement for the owner as the basso
profundo in an opera troupe. It was like the muttering of thunder,
and as Abisha Wharton expressed it, seemed to come from his shoes.</p>

<p>Since Wharton left it to his young friend to do the honors, Harvey,
pausing a few paces away, exerted himself to play the host.</p>

<p>"I see that your machine is a monoplane; you seem to have it
under good control."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn’t I? I made every part of it."</p>

<p>"Even to the searchlight?"</p>

<p>"Of course; is that biplane yours?"</p>

<p>"It is; we landed several hours ago, having been kindly furnished
a meal and lodgings for the night. I presume you will keep us
company; my friend here, I am sure, will be glad to do what he
can for you."</p>

<p>"Kerrect," added Wharton; "you’re as welcome as the flowers in
spring."</p>

<p>"Don’t you travel by night?" asked the visitor, ignoring the
invitation.</p>

<p>"Not when I can avoid it; it is too risky to land in the darkness."</p>

<p>"Night is the favorite period with me."</p>

<p>"But you can’t keep in the air all the time."</p>

<p>"What do you know about it, young man?" asked the other in his
sepulchral tones; "I don’t expect to make a landing till after
sunrise to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I never heard of such a thing."</p>

<p>"There are lots of things you never heard of; I built this monoplane,
without help from any one; it embodies a number of new principles,
one of which is the ability to keep in the air for twelve hours
without renewing the gasoline; I mix a certain chemical with that
fluid which increases its power tenfold; I shall not rest until
it is multiplied a hundred times."</p>

<p>"You have an invention that will make you wealthier than Carnegie
or Rockefeller."</p>

<p>"I’m not seeking wealth," said the other sourly, as if not pleased
with the suggestion; "there are better things in life than riches."</p>

<p>"All the same, it’s mighty pleasant to have them," replied Harvey,
nettled as much by the manner as by the words of the stranger.</p>

<p>"See here," interposed the hospitable Wharton; "we are keeping
you standing——"</p>

<p>"There is no compulsion about it, sir; I am doing what pleases
me best."</p>

<p>"Will you walk into my house and have something to eat? There
isn’t much style about us, but my wife will give you a good cup
of coffee and some corn bread and fried chicken."</p>

<p>"I’ll go to your house, but I’ll not eat for I’m not hungry."</p>

<p>Wharton led the way to the porch. Harvey, who was curious to
learn more of this strange individual, deftly placed his chair
so that the rays from the candle fell through the open window
upon him. In obedience to the youth’s order, Bohunkus brought
out a fourth stool, so that all were seated, the woman of the
house remaining inside and attending to her duties, as if she
felt no interest in what was going on.</p>

<p>The negro sat close to his companion and huskily whispered:</p>

<p>"Am he de feller dat rid down on de comet?"</p>

<p>"Bunk, the best thing you can do is to keep still and listen;
our conversation is likely to be above your head."</p>

<p>"Jest like de comet; all right; I ain’t saying nuffin."</p>

<p>A part of the yellow rays touched Harvey, and the stranger turned
and scrutinized him as if impelled by curiosity similar to that
of the youth. The movement revealed the visitor’s face plainly,
and it may be said it was in keeping with the impression he had
already made. He wore a motorman’s cap, and a long, linen duster,
buttoned to the chin and reaching downward to his slim tan shoes.
What clothing was within this envelope was out of sight.</p>

<p>The face was long and covered with a grizzled beard that reached
well down on his breast. He had removed his buckskin gloves, crossed
his legs, and placed one of the hand coverings in his lap, while
he loosely grasped the other and idly flipped the first with it
as he talked.</p>

<p>But his eyes were the most striking feature of the remarkable
man. They were overhung by shaggy brows, were of a piercing black
color, and glowed as if with fire. Their startling glare caused
a sudden suspicion in the mind of Harvey Hamilton that the man
was partially insane. At least, he must be the curious individual
best described by the word "crank," one whom much study and research
had made mad. As is well known, such a person often succeeds in
hiding his affliction from his friends, or gains the reputation
of being simply eccentric.</p>

<p>"What is your name and why are you here?" he abruptly asked,
still looking in the face of Harvey, who said he lived at Mootsport,
something more than a hundred miles distant.</p>

<p>"I have started on an outing with my colored friend, without
any particular destination in view; when we have had enough sport,
we shall return. Who are you?" queried the youth, feeling warranted
in asking a few equally pointed questions.</p>

<p>"My name is Milo Morgan; I have no special home, but stop where
the notion takes me; my business is invention, as it relates to
the aeroplane."</p>

<p>"May I ask what improvements you have made, Professor?"</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment as if uncertain what to reply.</p>

<p>"Not half as many as I am sure of making in the near future.
The rigging of a searchlight cannot be called an invention, for
it has long been in common use on warships and others, and all
aeroplanes are supplied with electricity. I have rigged up a wireless
telegraph, so as to pick out messages from the air; I have succeeded
in compounding a fluid which as I told you is ten times stronger
than gasoline; I run without noise, and my uplifter will carry
me vertically upward, as high as I care to go."</p>

<p>"I should think you were blamed near the limit," suggested Abisha
Wharton, profoundly interested in what the Professor was saying.</p>

<p>"I have only begun; and I intend to justify the name of my monoplane."</p>

<p>"I didn’t hear it."</p>

<p>"Because I haven’t spoken it, but when you have a daylight view
of my machine you will see the name painted on the under side
of the wings, ‘The Dragon of the Skies.’"</p>

<p>This was said with so much solemnity that Harvey had hard work
to hide his smile. He no longer doubted that he was talking with
a crank.</p>

<p>"Do you mind telling me what is the great object you have in
view?"</p>

<p>"It is to build a machine that will keep afloat and travel at
an average speed of sixty miles an hour,—probably greater. That
will enable me to cross the Atlantic in a little more than two
days and I shall have no difficulty in sailing to Asia or Africa." </p>
