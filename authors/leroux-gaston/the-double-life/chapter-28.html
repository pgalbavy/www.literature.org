<p>AS Théophraste was searching through the pocketbook of Signor
Petito, he had wandered unconsciously away from the track into
the fields. Upon returning, he was astonished to find the carriage
had disappeared. He looked up and down the track, but could find
no trace of it. Which was the most astonishing, the disappearance
or the apparition of the train? He could not make it out, and
the events had thrown him into a state bordering on prostration.</p>

<p>He went down the track, examined the switch, and put it back
in its original position and locked it, taking the key with him.</p>

<p>He walked on to the upper station, but with the exception of
the signalman everybody had gone out in search of the train. He
interrogated him, but could only learn that the train had been
reported but never came.</p>

<p>Théophraste insisted. "They certainly did report the express
to you from the preceding station?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I am certain. Look at my signal. It is still put to
allow the train to pass. The station master and all the men of
the station preceding saw the express pass and telegraphed to
us. In short, monsieur, you see my little yellow arm. A catastrophe
between the preceding station and this one is not possible; there
is not a single bridge or viaduct. I was mounted on the ladder
that you see leaning against that great vat. From there one can
see the whole line, as far as the other station. I saw our people
gesticulating on the line, but did not see the train."</p>

<p>"Strange, very strange!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. You must trust my little yellow arm."</p>

<p>"Inexplicable."</p>

<p>"There is nothing more inexplicable."</p>

<p>"There are things more inexplicable still than that which have
happened."</p>

<p>"What, then?"</p>

<p>"A carriage without a locomotive appeared and disappeared, and
no one could tell from whence it came. It disappeared, as it appeared....
Did you not see a carriage with a man at the door pass by here?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said the signalman angrily, "you mock me! You are
exaggerating because you do not believe the story of the express
which did not come. But look, monsieur, at my signal; that is
proof enough. It cannot make a mistake."</p>

<p>M. Longuet replied to the signalman: "If you did not see the
express, neither did I."</p>

<p>In that "neither did I" commenced the inward thoughts of M. Longuet,
who went away in Signor Petito’s clothes. M. Longuet had an idea.
His misfortune was so extreme and so incurable that he resolved
to die for the others. With a little cunning this was possible,
since he had reclothed himself in Signor Petito’s clothes. Nothing
would hinder him from leaving his on the bank of the first river
he came to.</p>

<p>This would constitute a suicidal act, according to the law.</p>

<p>M. Longuet was moved to the thought of addressing a letter to
Marceline and Adolphe. On the banks of what river would he put
his clothes? How could he re-enter Paris? However, these thoughts
passed through his head momentarily, for there was only one thing
which was really of importance to him, and that was the explanation
of the disappearance of the train.</p>

<p>This explanation was given to Théophraste by M. Mifroid, under
the circumstances which we shall now report.</p>
