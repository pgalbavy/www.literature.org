The guardsmen paid not the slightest attention to their wards,
for the red men could not move over two feet from the great rings
to which they were padlocked, though each had seized a weapon upon
which he had been engaged when I entered the room, and stood ready
to join me could they have but done so.
<P>
The yellow men devoted all their attention to me, nor were they long
in discovering that the three of them were none too many to defend the
armory against John Carter.  Would that I had had my own good long-sword
in my hand that day; but, as it was, I rendered a satisfactory account
of myself with the unfamiliar weapon of the yellow man.
<P>
At first I had a time of it dodging their villainous hook-swords,
but after a minute or two I had succeeded in wresting a second straight
sword from one of the racks along the wall, and thereafter, using it
to parry the hooks of my antagonists, I felt more evenly equipped.
<P>
The three of them were on me at once, and but for a lucky
circumstance my end might have come quickly.  The foremost
guardsman made a vicious lunge for my side with his hook after the
three of them had backed me against the wall, but as I sidestepped
and raised my arm his weapon but grazed my side, passing into a
rack of javelins, where it became entangled.
<P>
Before he could release it I had run him through, and then,
falling back upon the tactics that have saved me a hundred times
in tight pinches, I rushed the two remaining warriors, forcing them
back with a perfect torrent of cuts and thrusts, weaving my sword
in and out about their guards until I had the fear of death upon them.
<P>
Then one of them commenced calling for help, but it was too late
to save them.
<P>
They were as putty in my hands now, and I backed them about the
armory as I would until I had them where I wanted them--within
reach of the swords of the shackled slaves.  In an instant
both lay dead upon the floor.  But their cries had not been
entirely fruitless, for now I heard answering shouts and the
footfalls of many men running and the clank of accouterments
and the commands of officers.
<P>
"The door!  Quick, John Carter, bar the door!" cried Tardos Mors.
<P>
Already the guard was in sight, charging across the open court
that was visible through the doorway.
<P>
A dozen seconds would bring them into the tower.  A single
leap carried me to the heavy portal.  With a resounding bang I
slammed it shut.
<P>
"The bar!" shouted Tardos Mors.
<P>
I tried to slip the huge fastening into place, but it defied
my every attempt.
<P>
"Raise it a little to release the catch," cried one of the red men.
<P>
I could hear the yellow warriors leaping along the flagging just
beyond the door.  I raised the bar and shot it to the right
just as the foremost of the guardsmen threw himself against the
opposite side of the massive panels.
<P>
The barrier held--I had been in time, but by the fraction of
a second only.
<P>
Now I turned my attention to the prisoners.  To Tardos Mors I
went first, asking where the keys might be which would unfasten
their fetters.
<P>
"The officer of the guard has them," replied the Jeddak of Helium,
"and he is among those without who seek entrance.  You will have
to force them."
<P>
Most of the prisoners were already hacking at their bonds with
the swords in their hands.  The yellow men were battering at the
door with javelins and axes.
<P>
I turned my attention to the chains that held Tardos Mors.
Again and again I cut deep into the metal with my sharp blade,
but ever faster and faster fell the torrent of blows upon the portal.
<P>
At last a link parted beneath my efforts, and a moment later
Tardos Mors was free, though a few inches of trailing chain still
dangled from his ankle.
<P>
A splinter of wood falling inward from the door announced the
headway that our enemies were making toward us.
<P>
The mighty panels trembled and bent beneath the furious onslaught
of the enraged yellow men.
<P>
What with the battering upon the door and the hacking of the
red men at their chains the din within the armory was appalling.
No sooner was Tardos Mors free than he turned his attention to
another of the prisoners, while I set to work to liberate Mors Kajak.
<P>
We must work fast if we would have all those fetters cut before
the door gave way.  Now a panel crashed inward upon the floor,
and Mors Kajak sprang to the opening to defend the way until
we should have time to release the others.
<P>
With javelins snatched from the wall he wrought havoc among
the foremost of the Okarians while we battled with the insensate
metal that stood between our fellows and freedom.
<P>
At length all but one of the prisoners were freed, and then
the door fell with a mighty crash before a hastily improvised
battering-ram, and the yellow horde was upon us.
<P>
"To the upper chambers!" shouted the red man who was still
fettered to the floor.  "To the upper chambers!  There you may
defend the tower against all Kadabra.  Do not delay because of me,
who could pray for no better death than in the service of
Tardos Mors and the Prince of Helium."
<P>
But I would have sacrificed the life of every man of us rather
than desert a single red man, much less the lion-hearted hero who
begged us to leave him.
<P>
"Cut his chains," I cried to two of the red men, "while the
balance of us hold off the foe."
<P>
There were ten of us now to do battle with the Okarian guard,
and I warrant that that ancient watchtower never looked down upon
a more hotly contested battle than took place that day within
its own grim walls.
<P>
The first inrushing wave of yellow warriors recoiled from the
slashing blades of ten of Helium's veteran fighting men.  A dozen
Okarian corpses blocked the doorway, but over the gruesome barrier
a score more of their fellows dashed, shouting their hoarse and
hideous war-cry.
<P>
Upon the bloody mound we met them, hand to hand, stabbing where
the quarters were too close to cut, thrusting when we could push
a foeman to arm's length; and mingled with the wild cry of the
Okarian there rose and fell the glorious words:  "For Helium!
For Helium!" that for countless ages have spurred on the bravest of
the brave to those deeds of valor that have sent the fame of Helium's
heroes broadcast throughout the length and breadth of a world.
<P>
Now were the fetters struck from the last of the red men,
and thirteen strong we met each new charge of the soldiers
of Salensus Oll.  Scarce one of us but bled from a score
of wounds, yet none had fallen.
<P>
From without we saw hundreds of guardsmen pouring into the courtyard,
and along the lower corridor from which I had found my way to the
armory we could hear the clank of metal and the shouting of men.
<P>
In a moment we should be attacked from two sides, and with
all our prowess we could not hope to withstand the unequal odds
which would thus divide our attention and our small numbers.
<P>
"To the upper chambers!" cried Tardos Mors, and a moment later
we fell back toward the runway that led to the floors above.
<P>
Here another bloody battle was waged with the force of yellow
men who charged into the armory as we fell back from the doorway.
Here we lost our first man, a noble fellow whom we could ill spare;
but at length all had backed into the runway except myself, who
remained to hold back the Okarians until the others were safe above.
<P>
In the mouth of the narrow spiral but a single warrior could
attack me at a time, so that I had little difficulty in holding
them all back for the brief moment that was necessary.  Then,
backing slowly before them, I commenced the ascent of the spiral.
<P>
All the long way to the tower's top the guardsmen pressed me closely.
When one went down before my sword another scrambled over the dead man to
take his place; and thus, taking an awful toll with each few feet gained,
I came to the spacious glass-walled watchtower of Kadabra.
<P>
Here my companions clustered ready to take my place, and for a
moment's respite I stepped to one side while they held the enemy off.
<P>
From the lofty perch a view could be had for miles in every direction.
Toward the south stretched the rugged, ice-clad waste to the edge of
the mighty barrier.  Toward the east and west, and dimly toward the
north I descried other Okarian cities, while in the immediate foreground,
just beyond the walls of Kadabra, the grim guardian shaft reared its
somber head.
<P>
Then I cast my eyes down into the streets of Kadabra, from which
a sudden tumult had arisen, and there I saw a battle raging,
and beyond the city's walls I saw armed men marching in great
columns toward a near-by gate.
<P>
Eagerly I pressed forward against the glass wall of the observatory,
scarce daring to credit the testimony of my own  eyes.  But at last
I could doubt no longer, and with a shout of joy that rose strangely
in the midst of the cursing and groaning of the battling men at the
entrance to the chamber, I called to Tardos Mors.
<P>
As he joined me I pointed down into the streets of Kadabra and
to the advancing columns beyond, above which floated bravely in
the arctic air the flags and banners of Helium.
<P>
An instant later every red man in the lofty chamber had seen
the inspiring sight, and such a shout of thanksgiving arose as I
warrant never before echoed through that age-old pile of stone.
<P>
But still we must fight on, for though our troops had entered Kadabra,
the city was yet far from capitulation, nor had the palace been
even assaulted.  Turn and turn about we held the top of the runway
while the others feasted their eyes upon the sight of our valiant
countrymen battling far beneath us.
<P>
Now they have rushed the palace gate!  Great battering-rams
are dashed against its formidable surface.  Now they are repulsed
by a deadly shower of javelins from the wall's top!
<P>
Once again they charge, but a sortie by a large force of Okarians
from an intersecting avenue crumples the head of the column,
and the men of Helium go down, fighting, beneath an overwhelming force.
<P>
The palace gate flies open and a force of the jeddak's own guard,
picked men from the flower of the Okarian army, sallies forth
to shatter the broken regiments.  For a moment it looks as
though nothing could avert defeat, and then I see a noble figure
upon a mighty thoat--not the tiny thoat of the red man, but one of
his huge cousins of the dead sea bottoms.
<P>
The warrior hews his way to the front, and behind him rally the
disorganized soldiers of Helium.  As he raises his head aloft
to fling a challenge at the men upon the palace walls I see
his face, and my heart swells in pride and happiness as the
red warriors leap to the side of their leader and win back
the ground that they had but just lost--the face of him upon
the mighty thoat is the face of my son--Carthoris of Helium.
<P>
At his side fights a huge Martian war-hound, nor did I need a
second look to know that it was Woola--my faithful Woola who had
thus well performed his arduous task and brought the succoring
legions in the nick of time.
<P>
"In the nick of time?"
<P>
Who yet might say that they were not too late to save, but surely
they could avenge!  And such retribution as that unconquered army
would deal out to the hateful Okarians!  I sighed to think that I
might not be alive to witness it.
<P>
Again I turned to the windows.  The red men had not yet forced
the outer palace wall, but they were fighting nobly against the
best that Okar afforded--valiant warriors who contested every inch
of the way.
<P>
Now my attention was caught by a new element without the city wall--
a great body of mounted warriors looming large above the red men.
They were the huge green allies of Helium--the savage hordes from
the dead sea bottoms of the far south.
<P>
In grim and terrible silence they sped on toward the gate,
the padded hoofs of their frightful mounts giving forth no sound.
Into the doomed city they charged, and as they wheeled across the
wide plaza before the palace of the Jeddak of Jeddaks I saw, riding at
their head, the mighty figure of their mighty leader--Tars Tarkas,
Jeddak of Thark.
<P>
My wish, then, was to be gratified, for I was to see my old friend
battling once again, and though not shoulder to shoulder with him,
I, too, would be fighting in the same cause here in the high tower of Okar.
<P>
Nor did it seem that our foes would ever cease their stubborn attacks,
for still they came, though the way to our chamber was often clogged
with the bodies of their dead.  At times they would pause long enough
to drag back the impeding corpses, and then fresh warriors would forge
upward to taste the cup of death.
<P>
I had been taking my turn with the others in defending the
approach to our lofty retreat when Mors Kajak, who had been
watching the battle in the street below, called aloud in
sudden excitement.  There was a note of apprehension in his voice
that brought me to his side the instant that I could turn my place
over to another, and as I reached him he pointed far out across the
waste of snow and ice toward the southern horizon.
<P>
"Alas!" he cried, "that I should be forced to witness cruel fate
betray them without power to warn or aid; but they be past either now."
<P>
As I looked in the direction he indicated I saw the cause of
his perturbation.  A mighty fleet of fliers was approaching
majestically toward Kadabra from the direction of the ice-barrier.
On and on they came with ever increasing velocity.
<P>
"The grim shaft that they call the Guardian of the North is
beckoning to them," said Mors Kajak sadly, "just as it beckoned to
Tardos Mors and his great fleet; see where they lie, crumpled and
broken, a grim and terrible monument to the mighty force of
destruction which naught can resist."
<P>
I, too, saw; but something else I saw that Mors Kajak did not;
in my mind's eye I saw a buried chamber whose walls were lined with
strange instruments and devices.
<P>
In the center of the chamber was a long table, and before it sat a
little, pop-eyed old man counting his money; but, plainest of all,
I saw upon the wall a great switch with a small magnet inlaid
within the surface of its black handle.
<P>
Then I glanced out at the fast-approaching fleet.  In five minutes
that mighty armada of the skies would be bent and worthless scrap,
lying at the base of the shaft beyond the city's wall, and yellow
hordes would be loosed from another gate to rush out upon the few
survivors stumbling blindly down through the mass of wreckage;
then the apts would come.  I shuddered at the thought, for I could
vividly picture the whole horrible scene.
<P>
Quick have I always been to decide and act.  The impulse
that moves me and the doing of the thing seem simultaneous;
for if my mind goes through the tedious formality of reasoning,
it must be a subconscious act of which I am not objectively aware.
Psychologists tell me that, as the subconscious does not reason,
too close a scrutiny of my mental activities might prove anything
but flattering; but be that as it may, I have often won success
while the thinker would have been still at the endless task of
comparing various judgments.
<P>
And now celerity of action was the prime essential to the
success of the thing that I had decided upon.
<P>
Grasping my sword more firmly in my hand, I called to the red man
at the opening to the runway to stand aside.
<P>
"Way for the Prince of Helium!" I shouted; and before the
astonished yellow man whose misfortune it was to be at the fighting
end of the line at that particular moment could gather his wits
together my sword had decapitated him, and I was rushing like a
mad bull down upon those behind him.
<P>
"Way for the Prince of Helium!" I shouted as I cut a path
through the astonished guardsmen of Salensus Oll.
<P>
Hewing to right and left, I beat my way down that warrior-choked
spiral until, near the bottom, those below, thinking that an army
was descending upon them, turned and fled.
<P>
The armory at the first floor was vacant when I entered it,
the last of the Okarians having fled into the courtyard, so none
saw me continue down the spiral toward the corridor beneath.
<P>
Here I ran as rapidly as my legs would carry me toward the
five corners, and there plunged into the passageway that led
to the station of the old miser.
<P>
Without the formality of a knock, I burst into the room.
There sat the old man at his table; but as he saw me he
sprang to his feet, drawing his sword.
<P>
With scarce more than a glance toward him I leaped for the great switch;
but, quick as I was, that wiry old fellow was there before me.
<P>
How he did it I shall never know, nor does it seem credible
that any Martian-born creature could approximate the marvelous
speed of my earthly muscles.
<P>
Like a tiger he turned upon me, and I was quick to see why
Solan had been chosen for this important duty.
<P>
Never in all my life have I seen such wondrous swordsmanship
and such uncanny agility as that ancient bag of bones displayed.
He was in forty places at the same time, and before I had half a chance
to awaken to my danger he was like to have made a monkey of me,
and a dead monkey at that.
<P>
It is strange how new and unexpected conditions bring out
unguessed ability to meet them.
<P>
That day in the buried chamber beneath the palace of Salensus Oll
I learned what swordsmanship meant, and to what heights of sword
mastery I could achieve when pitted against such a wizard of the
blade as Solan.
<P>
For a time he liked to have bested me; but presently the latent
possibilities that must have been lying dormant within me for a
lifetime came to the fore, and I fought as I had never dreamed
a human being could fight.
<P>
That that duel-royal should have taken place in the dark recesses
of a cellar, without a single appreciative eye to witness it has
always seemed to me almost a world calamity--at least from
the viewpoint Barsoomian, where bloody strife is the first
and greatest consideration of individuals, nations, and races.
<P>
I was fighting to reach the switch, Solan to prevent me;
and, though we stood not three feet from it, I could not win
an inch toward it, for he forced me back an inch for the
first five minutes of our battle.
<P>
I knew that if I were to throw it in time to save the oncoming
fleet it must be done in the next few seconds, and so I tried my
old rushing tactics; but I might as well have rushed a brick wall
for all that Solan gave way.
<P>
In fact, I came near to impaling myself upon his point for my pains;
but right was on my side, and I think that that must give a man
greater confidence than though he knew himself to be battling
in a wicked cause.
<P>
At least, I did not want in confidence; and when I next rushed
Solan it was to one side with implicit confidence that he must turn
to meet my new line of attack, and turn he did, so that now we
fought with our sides towards the coveted goal--the great switch
stood within my reach upon my right hand.
<P>
To uncover my breast for an instant would have been to court
sudden death, but I saw no other way than to chance it, if by so
doing I might rescue that oncoming, succoring fleet; and so, in the
face of a wicked sword-thrust, I reached out my point and caught
the great switch a sudden blow that released it from its seating.
<P>
So surprised and horrified was Solan that he forgot to finish
his thrust; instead, he wheeled toward the switch with a loud shriek--
a shriek which was his last, for before his hand could touch the
lever it sought, my sword's point had passed through his heart.
