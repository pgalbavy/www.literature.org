<p>William extricated his arm, huskily muttering words which were
lost in the general outcry, "Car's coming!" The young people poured
out through the gate, and, as the car stopped, scrambled aboard.
For a moment everything was hurried and confused. William struggled
anxiously to push through to Miss Pratt and climb up beside her,
but Mr. George Crooper made his way into the crowd in a beaming,
though bull-like manner, and a fat back in a purple-and-white
"blazer" flattened William's nose, while ponderous heels damaged
William's toes; he was shoved back, and just managed to clamber
upon the foot-board as the car started. The friendly hand of Joe
Bullitt pulled him to a seat, and William found himself rubbing
his nose and sitting between Joe and Johnnie Watson, directly
behind the dashing Crooper and Miss Pratt. Mr. Crooper had already
taken Flopit upon his lap.</p>

<p>"Dogs are always crazy 'bout me," they heard him say, for his
high voice was but too audible over all other sounds. "Dogs and
chuldren. I dunno why it is, but they always take to me. My name's
George Crooper, Third, Johnnie Watson's cousin. He was tryin'
to intradooce me before the car came along, but he never got the
chance. I guess as this shindig's for you, and I'm the only other
guest from out o' town, we'll have to intradooce ourselves&mdash;the
two guests of honor, as it were."</p>

<p>Miss Pratt laughed her silvery laugh, murmured politely, and
turned no freezing glance upon her neighbor. Indeed, it seemed
that she was far from regarding him with the distaste anticipated
by William and Joe Bullitt. "Flopit look so toot an' tunnin',"
she was heard to remark. "Flopit look so 'ittle on dray, big,
'normous man's lap."</p>

<p>Mr. Crooper laughed deprecatingly. "He does look kind of small
compared with the good ole man that's got charge of him, now!
Well, I always was a good deal bigger than the fellas I went with.
I dunno why it is, but I was always kind of quicker, too, as it
were&mdash;and the strongest in any crowd I ever got with. I'm kind
of musclebound, I guess, but I don't let that interfere with my
quickness any. Take me in an automobile, now &mdash;I got a racin'-car
at home&mdash;and I keep my head better than most people do, as it
were. I can kind of handle myself better; I dunno why it is. My
brains seem to work better than other people's, that's all it
is. I don't mean that I got more sense, or anything like that;
it's just the way my brains work; they kind of put me at an advantage,
as it were. Well, f'rinstance, if I'd been livin' here in this
town and joined in with the crowd to get up this party, well,
it would of been done a good deal diff'rent. I won't say better,
but diff'rent. That's always the way with me if I go into anything,
pretty soon I'm running the whole shebang; I dunno why it is.
The other people might try to run it their way for a while, but
pretty soon you notice 'em beginning to step out of the way for
good ole George. I dunno why it is, but that's the way it goes.
Well, if I'd been running <em>THIS </em>party I'd of had automobiles
to go out in, not a trolley-car where you all got to sit together&mdash;and
I'd of sent over home for my little racer and I'd of taken you
out in her myself. I wish I'd of sent for it, anyway. We could
of let the rest go out in the trolley, and you and I could of
got off by ourselves: I'd like you to see that little car. Well,
anyway, I bet you'd of seen something pretty different and a whole
lot better if I'd of come over to this town in time to get up
this party for you!"</p>

<p>"For US," Miss Pratt corrected him, sunnily.</p>

<p>"Bofe strangers&mdash;party for us two&mdash;all bofe!" And she gave him
one of her looks.</p>

<p>Mr. Crooper flushed with emotion; he was annexed; he became serious.
"Say," he said, "that's a mighty smooth hat you got on." And he
touched the fluffy rim of it with his forefinger. His fat shoulders
leaned toward her yearningly.</p>

<p>"We'd cert'nly of had a lot better time sizzin' along in that
little racer I got," he said. "I'd like to had you see how I handle
that little car. Girls over home, they say they like to go out
with me just to watch the way I handle her; they say it ain't
so much just the ride, but more the way I handle that little car.
I dunno why it is, but that's what they say. That's the way I
do anything I make up my mind to tackle, though. I don't try to
tackle everything&mdash;there's lots o' things I wouldn't take enough
interest in 'em, as it were&mdash;but just lemme make up my mind once,
and it's all off; I dunno why it is. There was a brakeman on the
train got kind of fresh: he didn't know who I was. Well, I just
put my hand on his shoulder and pushed him down in his seat like
this"&mdash;he set his hand upon Miss Pratt's shoulder. "I didn't want
to hit him, because there was women and chuldren in the car, so
I just shoved my face up close to him, like this. 'I guess you
don't know how much stock my father's got in this road,' I says.
Did he wilt? Well, you ought of seen that brakeman when I got
through tellin' him who I was!"</p>

<p>"Nassy ole brateman!" said Miss Pratt, with unfailing sympathy.</p>

<p>Mr. Crooper's fat hand, as if unconsciously, gave Miss Pratt's
delicate shoulder a little pat in reluctant withdrawal. "Well,
that's the way with me," he said. "Much as I been around this
world, nobody ever tried to put anything over on me and got away
with it. They always come out the little end o' the horn; I dunno
why it is. Say, that's a mighty smooth locket you got on the end
o' that chain, there." And again stretching forth his hand, in
a proprietor-like way, he began to examine the locket.</p>

<p>Three hot hearts, just behind, pulsated hatred toward him; for
Johnnie Watson had perceived his error, and his sentiments were
now linked to those of Joe Bullitt and William. The unhappiness
of these three helpless spectators was the more poignant because
not only were they witnesses of the impression of greatness which
George Crooper was obviously producing upon Miss Pratt, but they
were unable to prevent themselves from being likewise impressed.</p>

<p>They were not analytical; they dumbly accepted George at his
own rating, not even being able to charge him with lack of modesty.
Did he not always accompany his testimonials to himself with his
deprecating falsetto laugh and "I dunno why it is," an official
disclaimer of merit, "as it were"? Here was a formidable candidate,
indeed&mdash;a traveler, a man of the world, with brains better and
quicker than other people's brains; an athlete, yet knightly&mdash;he
would not destroy even a brakeman in the presence of women and
children&mdash;and, finally, most enviable and deadly, the owner and
operator of a "little racer"! All this glitter was not far short
of overpowering; and yet, though accepting it as fact, the woeful
three shared the inconsistent belief that in spite of everything
George was nothing but a big, fat lummox. For thus they even rather
loudly whispered of him&mdash;almost as if hopeful that Miss Pratt,
and mayhap George himself, might overhear.</p>

<p>Impotent their seething! The overwhelming Crooper pursued his
conquering way. He leaned more and more toward the magnetic girl,
his growing tenderness having that effect upon him, and his head
inclining so far that his bedewed brow now and then touched the
fluffy hat. He was constitutionally restless, but his movements
never ended by placing a greater distance between himself and
Miss Pratt, though they sometimes discommoded Miss Parcher, who
sat at the other side of him&mdash;a side of him which appeared to
be without consciousness. He played naively with Miss Pratt's
locket and with the filmy border of her collar; he flicked his
nose for some time with her little handkerchief, loudly sniffing
its scent; and finally he became interested in a ring she wore,
removed it, and tried unsuccessfully to place it upon one of his
own fingers.</p>

<p>"I've worn lots o' girls' rings on my watch-fob. I'd let 'em
wear mine on a chain or something. I guess they like to do that
with me," he said. "I dunno why it is."</p>

<p>At this subtle hint the three unfortunates held their breath,
and then lost it as the lovely girl acquiesced in the horrible
exchange. As for William, life was of no more use to him. Out
of the blue heaven of that bright morning's promise had fallen
a pall, draping his soul in black and purple. He had been horror-stricken
when first the pudgy finger of George Crooper had touched the
fluffy edge of that sacred little hat; then, during George's subsequent
pawings and leanings, William felt that he must either rise and
murder or go mad. But when the exchange of rings was accomplished,
his spirit broke and even resentment oozed away. For a time there
was no room in him for anything except misery.</p>

<p>Dully, William's eyes watched the fat shoulders hitching and
twitching, while the heavy arms flourished in gesture and in further
pawings. Again and again were William's ears afflicted with, "I
dunno why it is,"  following upon tribute after tribute paid by
Mr. Crooper to himself, and received with little cries of admiration
and sweet child-words on the part of Miss Pratt. It was a long
and accursed ride.</p>
