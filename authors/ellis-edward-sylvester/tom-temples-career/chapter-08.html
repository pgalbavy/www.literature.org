<p><em>THE SUPPER </em>was as excellent as the dinner, and Tom,
made hungry by his exertions upon the river, enjoyed it.</p>

<p>By accident he found himself seated next to Mary Somers, the
poor cousin. The two conversed quite socially, rather to the disgust
of Imogene, who, hearing that Tom was rich, wished to monopolize
him herself. She was vexed to find that he was considerably more
attentive to her penniless cousin than he had been to herself.</p>

<p>If Mary had been homely, and she herself handsome, she could
have been quite friendly, but Mary’s fresh color and bright eyes
showed to such advantage compared with her own sallow complexion
and dull eyes that she envied and hated her.</p>

<p>"Did you have a pleasant afternoon, Mr. Temple?" asked Mary.</p>

<p>"Very pleasant," said Tom. "We had an adventure, too."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"We saved a little Irish boy from drowning."</p>

<p>"That is new business for Cousin James," said Mary, smiling.</p>

<p>"You needn’t lay it to me," said James. "I didn’t have anything
to do with the little brat."</p>

<p>"You speak as if it were discreditable," said Tom. "I’ll stand
the blame."</p>

<p>"I didn’t want him to drown," said James, "but I am not partial
to ragged boys."</p>

<p>"It is always well to be humane," said Lawyer Davenport. "I am
glad that my boy was instrumental in preserving the life of a
fellow-being."</p>

<p>Mary and Tom continued their conversation, while Imogene grew
more and more vexed with her cousin, till she had the ill-breeding
to say, in an ill-natured tone:</p>

<p>"Really, Mary, you talk so much that nobody else gets a chance."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said Mary blushing.</p>

<p>"I am just as much to blame," said Tom good-naturedly. "I’ve
been asking your cousin questions."</p>

<p>"I hate to see girls so forward," said Imogene spitefully.</p>

<p>Mary looked pained, and there was some spirit in her answer.</p>

<p>"I didn’t think it would be polite to refuse answering Mr. Temple,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Imogene is right," said Mrs. Davenport, who thoroughly sympathized
with her daughter. "You are too forward."</p>

<p>Mary’s mouth quivered with mortification, but she said nothing.
Neither did Tom. He was indignant at the petty malice of Imogene,
and determined, if he could not speak to Mary, he would not speak
at all. He only answered the questions of the rest in monosyllables
during the remainder of the meal.</p>

<p>When supper was over, Mrs. Davenport said:</p>

<p>"We will go into the parlor. Imogene, can’t you play for Mr.
Temple?"</p>

<p>"Do you like music, Mr. Temple?" asked Imogene.</p>

<p>"Pretty well," said Tom, "but I am not much of a judge of it."</p>

<p>"I have taken lessons for three years," said Imogene complacently.</p>

<p>"Have you? Do you like it?"</p>

<p>"I am passionately fond of it," said the young lady.</p>

<p>"Does your cousin play, too?"</p>

<p>"A little," said Imogene ungraciously. "She hasn’t much taste
for it, but it is really necessary for her to learn."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because she is to be a governess," said Imogene. "She is very
poor—in fact she has nothing of her own. Pa kindly agreed to take
her and give her an education, so as to qualify her to earn her
own living. She’ll be a governess, or teach school, or something
of the kind, when she’s old enough."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she won’t have to," said Tom, who liked to annoy his
companion.</p>

<p>"She has got to earn her living."</p>

<p>"I mean she may get married."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Imogene, "but, of course, she can’t expect to make
much of a match. She may get a farmer, or mechanic, perhaps."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Tom, "<em>you</em> would not marry a farmer
or mechanic?"</p>

<p>"I should think not," said Imogene, tossing her head. "I have
a right to look higher. I may marry a lawyer like pa. What do
you expect to be, Mr. Temple?"</p>

<p>"I haven’t thought about it," said Tom.</p>

<p>"I suppose you won’t have to do anything. You are rich, are you
not?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Tom, who was not inclined to boast of his
wealth, "but I shouldn’t be willing to be idle."</p>

<p>"You might buy an estate and take care of it, and live on your
income."</p>

<p>"Then I should be a farmer."</p>

<p>"Oh, that’s different. You wouldn’t have to work yourself. What
shall I play for you?" asked the young lady, who was now seated
at the piano.</p>

<p>"I’m not particular. I like songs best."</p>

<p>Imogene sang a fashionable song, but her voice was thin and shrill,
and Tom could not in conscience praise the performance. He thanked
her, but did not ask for another. Imogene, however, played two
other pieces, and then rose from the piano.</p>

<p>"Miss Mary," said Tom, "won’t you play something?"</p>

<p>"Shall I aunt?" asked Mary.</p>

<p>"If Mr. Temple wishes to hear you," said Mrs. Davenport ungraciously.
"He will make allowances, as he can hardly expect you to perform
as well as Imogene."</p>

<p>So Mary took her place at the piano.</p>

<p>"I do not play very much," she said apologetically.</p>

<p>"I’m not a critic," said Tom. "I sha’n’t find fault. Do you sing?"</p>

<p>"A few common songs, such as ‘Sweet Home.’"</p>

<p>"That’s just what I like."</p>

<p>So Mary played and sang "Sweet Home." Her voice was sweet and
fresh, far superior to her cousin’s, and her performance was wholly
free from affectation.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Tom, at the conclusion of the song. "I enjoyed
it very much."</p>

<p>He was about to ask for another song, when Imogene said:</p>

<p>"Don’t bang away on the piano any more, Mary, I am sure Mr. Temple
will gladly excuse you."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," said Tom, "I particularly enjoy your cousin’s
singing."</p>

<p>"I want to show you some engravings," said Imogene, determined
to separate the two.</p>

<p>Mary rose from the piano. It would be impossible to continue
after such a broad hint.</p>

<p>"I shall hope to hear you again," said Tom, as he led her to
a seat.</p>

<p>"Some other time I will sing to you, if you wish," said Mary.
"Imogene doesn’t want me to now."</p>

<p>"What a spiteful girl her cousin is!" thought Tom. "She’s a little
more disagreeable than James, if possible. If she expects to make
any impression on me, she’s very much mistaken."</p>

<p>Tom had no further opportunity to converse with Mary Somers that
evening. Imogene laid herself out to entertain him, and at all
events succeeded in monopolizing his attention. Tom was not unaccustomed
to society, and although he was weary of his companion, he was
too polite to say so. He permitted her to show him several collections
of engravings, and forced himself to converse, though his eyes
frequently wandered to Mary, who was sitting at the other end
of the room, wholly neglected. Neither James nor Edwin thought
it necessary to go near her, but were playing a game of checkers,
while Mr. Davenport was nodding over his newspaper, and Mrs. Davenport
was attending to some feminine work.</p>

<p>Our hero was glad when the time came to go. He found the Middletons
curious to hear the particulars of his reception by the great
man of the place.</p>

<p>"What do you think of Miss Imogene?" asked Nathan.</p>

<p>"She’s thin and bony," said Tom; "not at all good-looking."</p>

<p>"Really," said Nathan, rather shocked, "I think you are unjust.
She is considered a very stylish young lady."</p>

<p>"Her cousin Mary is pretty," said Tom.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know she is only a poor relation."</p>

<p>"I know all about that," said Tom, laughing. "Imogene told me.
She thought I was paying her too much attention."</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Middleton exchanged glances. They understood that
the great man’s daughter was pleased with Tom, and thought more
of him accordingly.</p>

<p>"Will you have some refreshments before you retire?" asked Mrs.
Middleton.</p>

<p>"No, thank you. I had a jolly supper at Mr. Davenport’s."</p>

<p>Mrs. Middleton was relieved to hear this, and did not press her
invitation.</p>

<p>The next day Tom went on an exploring expedition. He was returning
about the middle of the afternoon, when he was startled by a young
girl’s shriek. Turning his head he saw a terrified figure pursued
by a fierce dog. A moment’s glance revealed to him that it was
Mary Somers.</p>

<p>She recognized him at the same moment.</p>

<p>"Oh, save me, Mr. Temple!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands.</p>

<p>"I will," said Tom resolutely.</p>
