<p>The fugitives felt like congratulating themselves upon the acquisition
of so valuable a man as the patriot Worrell. A hunter like him,
who had spent years in wandering through the woods, must be acquainted
with all those places that were the most available as a means
of concealment. There were many retreats which had proven of the
greatest benefit to other fugitives, but they were those that
had been seized upon in the frenzy of flight, when the thirsting
pursuers were as eager as those whom they were hunting, and the
slightest incident was frequently sufficient to turn aside the
human bloodhounds. But something had now become necessary, for
there was the danger of a carefully managed hunt by the Indians
themselves, in which case the whites would need to take advantage
of every expedient possible. What more likely, therefore, than
that this man could give them the very assistance they needed
in that respect?</p>

<p>The thought occurred to Ned Clinton and Jo Minturn at the same
moment. Rosa remained seated when he came up, bowing politely
to the stranger, but contenting herself with merely looking on
and studying him as best she could. She was not much disturbed
until she saw the expression of disappointment on the upper part
of his face when he learned that Lena-Wingo, the Mohawk, had charge
of the party and was expected soon to return. The opportunity
of studying the character of the man from his face was limited
on account of the shaggy, luxuriant beard; but woman has an intuitive
perception, which avails her more than the reasoning power of
man; and, although the maiden felt it was possible she was mistaken
in what she saw there, the impression remained that he was one
who ought to be regarded with distrust, if not suspicion. And
yet she determined to say and do nothing that could interfere
with any plans of her companions. She felt that she had already
said much in that direction, and well convinced as she was that
they were abundantly qualified to take care of themselves, it
seemed to her the crisis was too grave for her to delay any movement
by objections for which she could give no valid reason.</p>

<p>"You've had that Mohawk to help you ever since you left Forty
Fort?" was the inquiring remark of Worrell, in answer to the information
of Ned Clinton that the Indian was a member of the party.</p>

<p>"Yes; we couldn't have gotten along without him. There can be
no doubt that we would have fallen into the hands of the Iroquois
long ago but for his presence."</p>

<p>"Me and Red Jack&mdash;though I believe he likes his name of Lena-Wingo
the best&mdash;have been on many a hunt together, and he beats anything
I ever saw."</p>

<p>"There is no cause for his being otherwise, when he has spent
so many years as a hunter and scout. The Iroquois would give a
great deal to secure his scalp."</p>

<p>"You can just bet they would, and so would Colonel Butler, Captain
Bagley or any of the Tories. You know that the fellow has done
too much against the scamps to be forgiven. But where has he gone?"</p>

<p>"He is off taking a look through the neighborhood to see how
the land lies, and what is the best thing for us to do."</p>

<p>"When do you expect him back?"</p>

<p>"We expect him from this time forward till he comes, but there
is no telling when that will be. He is master of his own motions,
and will return, I suppose, when he deems the hour is best for
him to do so."</p>

<p>"I found that out long ago, but you don't know where he has gone?"</p>

<p>"No more than you. You seem interested."</p>

<p>"Well, Red Jack and me are old friends, and if I knowed where
he was I might go out to hunt him up and give him a point or two
about the lay of the land in these parts."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are acquainted with it all?"</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't the man to boast, and don't know that it is bragging
to tell the truth. But if there is a spot I don't know all about
in this neighborhood I'm ready to pay a good reward for a sight
of the same."</p>

<p>"It seems to me you might be able to do us a good turn."</p>

<p>"I'll do anything in the world for you and the lady, if I have
the chance. What have you in mind?"</p>

<p>"We feel that, as long as we occupy this position, we are in
danger of being swooped down upon by the Iroquois&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can bet on that! Didn't I tell you a minute ago how many
narrer escapes I made while poking round in these woods? Why,
it ain't an hour ago since I saw three Indians that must have
been some of the painted Iroquois who are looking around for you!"</p>

<p>"Is that the case?" asked Jo Minturn, rising to his feet and
walking closer to their visitor. "How far off were they?"</p>

<p>"Not more than a quarter of a mile at the most, and it took careful
work on my part to keep out of their way."</p>

<p>The youths looked at each other with something like dismay, while
Rosa became deeply interested.</p>

<p>"There can scarcely be a doubt that they were hunting for us,"
said Jo, in an undertone that was intended to escape his sister,
but of which every word reached her ear. "It isn't a pleasant
situation, with Lena-Wingo gone, and no one knowing when he will
be back. He is the shrewdest fellow in the world, but no one is
smart enough to save himself from mistake at all times. Who knows
but that he has gone in just such a direction that he will escape
seeing the very Indians from whom the visit is most likely to
come?"</p>

<p>"I think that we had better get this fellow to take us to some
good hiding-places where we can place Rosa&mdash;at least, till the
Mohawk comes back. I don't believe he has any idea of trying to
run into Wilkesbarre while it is day, but is getting up some plan
for stealing in at night with her."</p>

<p>"It does look that way, which means our waiting in some place
of hiding till the time shall come to make the attempt."</p>

<p>"And this isn't much of a hiding-place, when the minute I climbed
a tree I was seen by Worrell, there."</p>

<p>"It makes Lena-Wingo angry," continued Jo, who felt a hesitation
about running directly in the face of the well-known wishes of
the dusky scout, "for us to disregard his instructions on a point
like this; but I think if he understood the chance we have of
helping him in this matter he would be glad for us to avail ourselves
of it."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't see that there is any great risk run in allowing
Worrell to conduct us to shelter. This will never be of any use
to us, and I can't feel safe here one minute after what he has
told us. I propose that we get him to find us other quarters."</p>

<p>"I'm favorable to the plan, because he is a good hunter, and
while Lena-Wingo is operating in one direction, he may be of help
in the way, also, of getting food for us."</p>

<p>And so it was that, look at the matter in whatever light they
chose, it seemed a wise step for them to call in the services
of the straggling patriot that had joined them in the rather curious
manner already told. The only hesitation with the young men came
from the consciousness that they were sure to violate either the
expressed or understood command of the Mohawk. But they argued
themselves into a justification of the step by the manifest advantages
to be gained in taking it.</p>

<p>"Find out what Rosa thinks about it," finally suggested Ned,
when the two had gone over all the arguments to each other.</p>

<p>Jo stepped over to where his sister was sitting and put the question
to her.</p>

<p>"Whatever you think best," was her answer. "I don't feel, Jo,
that I am competent to give advice."</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt that it is the best thing for us to do,
but we hesitate because it will be a direct disregard of the wishes
of Lena-Wingo himself."</p>

<p>"If the move is for the best, he will find no fault with you.
But, Jo, are you sure that if you put yourself under charge of
that man it <em>will</em> be for the best?"</p>
