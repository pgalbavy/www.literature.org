<p>The mustang, trained as he was to this sort of hunting, steadily
drew up again to the buffalo, which was plunging forward with
unabated speed, while Ned held his rifle ready to fire whenever
the critical moment should come. He concluded that the proper
place at which to aim was the head, and, drawing his gun to his
shoulder, he did not hesitate, although he knew the aim was anything
but a good one. It struck the bison beyond all question, but did
no more than irritate him; for, without any other warning than
a sudden lowering of the head, he wheeled, and turned directly
upon the horse, with the evident purpose of disemboweling him.</p>

<p>But the latter had seen this sort of business before, and was
prepared for it.</p>

<p>Without attempting to turn to the one side or the other, or to
check his speed in the least, he made a terrific flying leap upward,
going clear over the head of the buffalo, landing upon the other
side, and continuing his flight at his leisure, as it may be said.</p>

<p>This was a clever trick of the mustang, but it proved the undoing
of his rider, who had no other saddle than the Indian blanket
strapped to the horse's back. This was good enough, except in
such a sudden emergency as the present, when Ned was entirely
unprepared for it. It was done in a twinkling, the end of it being
that he found himself lying upon the green sward of the prairie,
considerably bruised, and with horse and buffalo rapidly speeding
from view.</p>

<p>"This is a go," said the lad, rising to his feet and looking
about him. "I don't see where the fun of buffalo hunting comes
in."</p>

<p>During the minutes of excitement when the mustang was coursing
with such speed over the prairie, the rider had no idea of the
direction taken, nor could he conjecture how far he had gone;
but the result was that he was separated by a much greater distance
than he supposed from his friends. Ned stood and gazed carefully
about him. Off to the west were the dust, and thousands upon thousands
of buffaloes. The latter were too far removed to be distinguished,
but that tramping and the heavy cloud indicated where the mass
of life was plunging tumultuously forward toward some destination
unknown even to themselves. Nothing was to be seen of the hunters.
They had sent the lad off on this hunt on purpose to give him
a taste of buffalo hunting, not supposing, of course, that any
accident would result.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" was the question the boy asked himself, as
he stood, rifle in hand, and looked around him. "If there was
some way in which I could get a good supper, I wouldn't mind this
camping out, for Tom and Dick will be sure to find me in the morning."</p>

<p>Looking toward the north, he fancied that he dimly discerned
the dark outline of something which resembled a grove of trees,
and he turned his footsteps in that direction.</p>

<p>"If they are trees," he reflected, as he trudged along, "it's
more than likely there's water there, and now that I've got a
gun, I've some chance of shooting something; and that reminds
me of poor Corporal Hugg's warning, always to reload my gun the
first thing after firing it."</p>

<p>He had enough sense to carry out this resolution on the spot,
and then he resumed his journey in the direction of the object
that had attracted his attention. A short distance further he
was pleased to find his first impression correct. He was approaching
a clump of trees where he could rest with a much greater sense
of security than upon the open prairie. Thoroughly weary and worn
out, faint with hunger, he felt like throwing himself upon the
ground and sleeping for a week. But, continuing, he entered a
grove of trees something like a hundred yards in extent, through
which, in the stillness of the night, he caught distinctly the
ripple of flowing water. It required but a moment to discover
this and he lay down upon the margin, quaffed his full and flung
himself upon the grass to sleep until morning. Five minutes after
his eyes were shut he was wrapped in a sound slumber which remained
undisturbed until morning when, as he opened his eyes, he found
the sun shining through the branches upon him.</p>

<p>"Gracious!" he exclaimed, starting up. "Where am I?"</p>

<p>It took several minutes before he could collect his senses and
tell where he was; and then as he recalled the separation from
his friends, he hurried out to the edge of the wood in the hope
of discovering them somewhere near at hand; but, look in whatsoever
direction he chose, nothing was to be seen but the broad sweeping
prairie, stretching away until sky and earth joined in the distance.
Far off, low down in the horizon, the blue wavy outline of a mountain
spur was to be seen. Miles and miles away, it would probably require
days of traveling before it could be reached.</p>

<p>"That's strange!" murmured Ned, as a feeling of alarm began stealing
over him. "Where can Tom and Dick be? They must be somewhere in
this neighborhood, and yet I cannot see any signs of them."</p>

<p>He moved around the grove, carefully gazing in every direction;
but after making the complete circuit he came back without having
detected anything that told him what had become of his friends.</p>

<p>The grove in which he had taken shelter abounded with undergrowth,
so dense in many places, that he made his way with considerable
difficulty. He had no thought of any one else being in the same
place, but, while moving along in his careless manner, he was
aroused to a sense of imprudence by the sound of something on
his right. Turning his head, his surprise may be imagined when
he saw a solitary buffalo standing scarcely a dozen feet distant,
and staring straight at him. Ned was so astonished that for the
moment he forgot that he carried a loaded gun, and stared at the
creature in turn, the two forming as striking a tableau as it
is possible to imagine.</p>

<p>The buffalo may have known the capacity of the weapon which the
boy carried in his hand, for, with a sniff of alarm, he wheeled
and started away on a run. As quick as thought the lad seemed
to awake to a sense of his situation, and, raising his gun, he
blazed away.</p>

<p>The shot, fired at random, could not have been better aimed by
the most veteran of hunters. The ball entered directly behind
the fore-leg just as it was thrown forward in the act of running,
and, penetrating to the heart, the result was that the animal
never made another bound. His own momentum carried him a few feet
forward, when he tumbled and rolled over in a heap.</p>

<p>"Now I'll have a meal!" exclaimed the delighted lad, as he ran
forward to claim his prize. "I feel as if I could eat the whole
buffalo."</p>

<p>There seemed to be no reason why he should not provide himself
with the most substantial kind of dinner. He knew very little
about a buffalo, but it was no difficult task to cut off a good
sized piece, which he placed upon some green leaves, while he
looked about for some means of starting a fire.</p>

<p>"Well, there!" he exclaimed in delighted amazement, "if that
isn't the most wonderful thing yet!"</p>

<p>This exclamation was caused by the sight of a smoking wad lying
at his very feet, just as if Providence had sent it that he might
be provided with the indispensable fire. Picking it up and blowing
it, he saw that it was in a vigorous state, and could be utilized
without trouble. A few leaves were hurriedly gathered together,
dried twigs placed upon these, and then the tiny blaze that required
considerable blowing to produce, was carefully nursed into a larger
one until a good roaring, crackling fire was the result.</p>

<p>Leaving this to burn by itself, Ned took the meat to the side
of the stream, where he carefully washed and dressed it, ready
for cooking. When this was completed, he skewered it upon some
green twigs, and began toasting it. The process was rather tardy,
but as soon as a bite of the meat had spluttered and crisped for
a moment, Ned bit it off, and went to masticating it. The cooking
continued rapidly enough to keep his jaws going, and was a good
arrangement, for it prevented his eating too fast, and gave him
the fullest enjoyment imaginable of the meal. All of an hour was
occupied in this way, during which Ned was in as happy a frame
of mind as can be conceived. For the first half of the time he
seemed to be growing more hungry with each mouthful he swallowed.
Then came a standstill, and soon he began to gain upon it, the
end being that he thoroughly satisfied that appetite which at
one time had seemed unappeasable. With no further necessity of
thinking of the wants of the inner man, the lad began to debate
as to what he should do to get out of the rather unpleasant position
in which he was placed. There he was, his horse gone, his two
friends missing, and himself still a long distance from home.
He knew not in what direction to turn to reach Fort Havens, and,
even if he did, he had little assurance of ever reaching it. Indeed,
with the exception of the rather important fact that he had secured
possession of a rifle and some ammunition, it may be said that
his position was very similar to what it was before he came across
Dick Morris and Tom Hardynge.</p>
