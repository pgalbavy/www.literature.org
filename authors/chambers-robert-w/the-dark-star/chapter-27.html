<p>The Princess Mistchenka and Rue Carew had retired to their respective
rooms for that hour between four and five in the afternoon, which
the average woman devotes to cat-naps or to that aimless feminine
fussing which must ever remain a mystery to man.</p>

<p>The afternoon had turned very warm; Neeland, in his room, lay
on the lounge in his undershirt and trousers, having arrived so
far toward bathing and changing his attire.</p>

<p>No breeze stirred the lattice blinds hanging over both open windows;
the semi-dusk of the room was pierced here and there by slender
shafts of sunlight which lay almost white across the carpet and
striped the opposite wall; the rue Soleil d'Or was very silent
in the July afternoon.</p>

<p>And Neeland lay there thinking about all that had happened to
him and trying to bring it home to himself and make it seem plausible
and real; and could not.</p>

<p>For even now the last ten days of his life seemed like a story
he had read concerning someone else. Nor did it seem to him that
he personally had known all those people concerned in this wild,
exaggerated, grotesque story. They, too, took their places on
the printed page, appearing, lingering, disappearing, reappearing,
as chapter succeeded chapter in a romance too obvious, too palpably
sensational to win the confidence and credulity of a young man
of today.</p>

<p>Fed to repletion on noisy contemporary fiction, his finer perception
blunted by the daily and raucous yell of the New York press, his
imagination too long over-strained by Broadway drama and now flaccid
and incapable of further response to its leering or shrieking
appeal, the din of twentieth-century art fell on nerveless ears
and on a brain benumbed and sceptical.</p>

<p>And so when everything that he had found grotesque, illogical,
laboured, obvious, and clamorously redundant in literature and
the drama began to happen and continued to happen in real life
to him&mdash;and went on happening and involving himself and others
all around him in the pleasant July sunshine of 1914, this young
man, made intellectually <em>blasé</em>, found himself without
sufficient capacity to comprehend it.</p>

<p>There was another matter with which his mind was struggling as
he lay there, his head cradled on one elbow, watching the thin
blue spirals from his cigarette mount straight to the ceiling,
and that was the metamorphosis of Rue Carew.</p>

<p>Where was the thin girl he remembered&mdash;with her untidy chestnut
hair and freckles, and a rather sweet mouth&mdash;dressed in garments
the only mission of which was to cover a flat chest and frail
body and limbs whose too rapid growth had outstripped maturity?</p>

<p>To search for her he went back to the beginning, where a little
girl in a pink print dress, bare-legged and hatless, loitered
along an ancient rail fence and looked up shyly at him as he warned
her to keep out of range of the fusillade from the bushes across
the pasture.</p>

<p>He thought of her again at the noisy party in Gayfield on that
white night in winter; visualised the tall, shy, overgrown girl
who danced with him and made no complaint when her slim foot was
trodden on. And again he remembered the sleigh and the sleighbells
clashing and tinkling under the moon; the light from her doorway,
and how she stood looking back at him; and how, on the mischievous
impulse of the moment, he had gone back and kissed her&#11834;</p>

<p>At the memory an odd sensation came over him, scaring him a little.
How on earth had he ever had the temerity to do such a thing to
her!</p>

<p>And, as he thought of this exquisite, slender, clear-eyed young
girl who had greeted him at the Paris terminal&mdash;this charming
embodiment of all that is fresh and sweet and fearless&mdash;in her
perfect hat and gown of <em>mondaine</em> youth and fashion, the
memory of his temerity appalled him.</p>

<p>Imagine his taking an unencouraged liberty now!</p>

<p>Nor could he dare imagine encouragement from the Rue Carew so
amazingly revealed to him.</p>

<p>Out of what, in heaven's name, had this lovely girl developed?
Out of a shy, ragged, bare-legged child, haunting the wild blackberry
tangles in Brookhollow?</p>

<p>Out of the frail, charmingly awkward, pathetic, freckled mill-hand
in her home-made party clothes, the rather sweet expression of
whose mouth once led him to impudent indiscretion?</p>

<p>Out of what had she been evolved&mdash;this young girl whom he had
left just now standing beside her boudoir door with the Princess
Naïa's arm around her waist? Out of the frightened, white-lipped,
shabby girl who had come dragging her trembling limbs and her
suitcase up the dark stairway outside his studio? Out of the young
thing with sagging hair, crouched in an armchair beside his desk,
where her cheap hat lay with two cheap hatpins sticking in the
crown? Out of the fragile figure buried in the bedclothes of a
stateroom berth, holding out to him a thin, bare arm in voiceless
adieu?</p>

<p>And Neeland lay there thinking, his head on his elbow, the other
arm extended&mdash;from the fingers of which the burnt-out cigarette
presently fell to the floor.</p>

<p>He thought to himself:</p>

<p>"She is absolutely beautiful; there's no denying that. It's not
her clothes or the way she does her hair, or her voice, or the
way she moves, or how she looks at a man; it's the whole business.
And the whole bally business is a miracle, that's all. Good Lord!
And to think I ever had the nerve&mdash;the <em>nerve</em>!"</p>

<p>He swung himself to a sitting posture, sat gazing into space
for a few moments, then continued to undress by pulling off one
shoe, lighting a cigarette, and regarding his other foot fixedly.</p>

<p>That is the manner in which the vast majority of young men do
their deepest thinking.</p>

<p>However, before five o'clock he had scrubbed himself and arrayed
his well constructed person in fresh linen and outer clothing;
and now he sauntered out through the hallway and down the stairs
to the rear drawing-room, where a tea-table had been brought in
and tea paraphernalia arranged. Although the lamp under the kettle
had been lighted, nobody was in the room except a West Highland
terrier curled up on a lounge, who, without lifting his snow-white
head, regarded Neeland out of the wisest and most penetrating
eyes the young man had ever encountered.</p>

<p>Here was a personality! Here was a dog not to be approached lightly
or with flippant familiarity. No! That small, long, short-legged
body with its thatch of wiry white hair was fairly instinct with
dignity, wisdom, and uncompromising self-respect.</p>

<p>"That dog," thought Neeland, venturing to seat himself on a chair
opposite, "is a Presbyterian if ever there was one. And I, for
one, haven't the courage to address him until he deigns to speak
to me."</p>

<p>He looked respectfully at the dog, glanced at the kettle which
had begun to sizzle a little, then looked out of the long windows
into the little walled garden where a few slender fruit trees
grew along the walls in the rear of well-kept flower beds, now
gay with phlox, larkspur, poppies, and heliotrope, and edged with
the biggest and bluest pansies he had ever beheld.</p>

<p>On the wall a Peacock butterfly spread its brown velvet and gorgeously
eyed wings to the sun's warmth; a blackbird with brilliant yellow
bill stood astride a peach twig and poured out a bubbling and
incessant melody full of fluted grace notes. And on the grass
oval a kitten frisked with the ghosts of last month's dandelions,
racing after the drifting fluff and occasionally keeling over
to attack its own tail, after the enchanting manner of all kittens.</p>

<p>A step behind him and Neeland turned. It was Marotte, the butler,
who presented a thick, sealed envelope to him on his salver, bent
to turn down the flame under the singing silver kettle, and withdrew
without a sound.</p>

<p>Neeland glanced at the letter in perplexity, opened the envelope
and the twice-folded sheets of letter paper inside, and read this
odd communication:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

*       *       *       *       *

</p>
</div>
<p>Have I been fair to you? Did I keep my word? Surely you must
now, in your heart, acquit me of treachery&mdash;of any premeditated
violence toward you.</p>

<p>I never dreamed that those men would come to my stateroom. That
plan <em>had</em> been discussed, but was abandoned because it
appeared impossible to get hold of you.</p>

<p>And also&mdash;may I admit it without being misunderstood? &mdash;I
absolutely refused to permit any attempt involving your death.</p>

<p>When the trap shut on you, there in my stateroom, it shut also
on me. I was totally unprepared; I was averse to murder; and also
I had given you my word of honour.</p>

<p>Judge, then, of my shame and desperation&mdash;my anger at being entrapped
in a false position involving the loss in your eyes of my personal
honour!</p>

<p>It was unbearable: and I did what I could to make it clear to
you that I had not betrayed you. But my comrades do not yet know
that I had any part in it; do not yet understand why the ship
was not blown to splinters. They are satisfied that I made a mistake
in the rendezvous. And, so far, no suspicion attaches to me; they
believe the mechanism of the clock failed them. And perhaps it
is well for me that they believe this.</p>

<p>It is, no doubt, a matter of indifference to you how the others
and I reached safety. I have no delusions concerning any personal
and kindly feeling on your part toward me. But one thing you can
not&mdash;dare not&mdash;believe, and that is that I proved treacherous
to you and false to my own ideas of honour.</p>

<p>And now let me say one more thing to you&mdash;let me say it out of
a&mdash;friendship&mdash;for which you care nothing&mdash;could not care anything.
And that is this: your task is accomplished. You could not possibly
have succeeded. There is no chance for recovery of those papers.
Your mission is definitely ended.</p>

<p>Now, I beg of you to return to America. Keep clear of entanglement
in these events which are beginning to happen in such rapid succession
in Europe. They do not concern you; you have nothing to do with
them, no interest in them. Your entry into affairs which can not
concern you would be insulting effrontery and foolish bravado.</p>

<p>I beg you to heed this warning. I know you to be personally courageous;
I suppose that fear of consequences would not deter you from intrusion
into any affair, however dangerous; but I dare hope that perhaps
in your heart there may have been born a little spark of friendliness&mdash;a
faint warmth of recognition for a woman who took some slight chance
with death to prove to you that her word of honour is not lightly
given or lightly broken.</p>

<p>So, if you please, our ways part here with this letter sent to
you by hand.</p>

<p>I shall not forget the rash but generous boy I knew who called
me</p>
