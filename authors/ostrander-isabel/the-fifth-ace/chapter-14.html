<p>"We'll be late," Angie observed as she and Willa waited in the
drawing-room for the rest of the family.  It was the first remark she
had voluntarily addressed to her cousin since she had come upon the
tête-à-tête in the library.  "Not that I care, of course, these dinners
are always stupid, but the Erskines are so horribly particular.  I've
heard that the Bishop was late once and they went in without him."
</p><p>Willa smiled.
</p><p>"I wonder who will be there?"
</p><p>"The same old crowd, I suppose," Angie shrugged.  "For heaven's sake,
Willa, if they send you in again with Harrington Chase, don't
monopolize him as you did at the Wadleighs'.  It's horribly bad form; I
wonder that mother didn't tell you."
</p><p>"Did I monopolize him?  I wasn't conscious of it," Willa said
reflectively.  "He interests me."
</p><p>"Evidently!" Angie sneered.  "So do a few others, I imagine, but you
shouldn't show it so plainly.  I admit that you've gotten on very well
so far, but your methods are horribly crude, still."
</p><p>"My methods?"  Willa was honestly puzzled.  "I wasn't aware that I had
any.  When people bore me I let them alone; but those I find
interesting for one reason or another I listen to.  Is it crude to
discriminate?"
</p><p>Angie bit her lip.
</p><p>"You can be very simple and naïve when you want to!" she burst out.
"But do reserve it for outsiders, and spare us!  I know you for what
you are: sly and sneaking and mean!  Your cheap, common little airs and
graces don't deceive me, they only disgust me more and more!  I wish
Mr. North had left you where he found you, with your gamblers and
horse-thieves and roustabouts!"
</p><p>"So do I," Willa retorted frankly.  "They were men, anyway.  You are
unjust because you are hurt, and I am sorry for you.  I wish you could
understand, but I am afraid you will not believe me.  Mr. Wiley----"
</p><p>"Will you kindly leave his name out of this discussion?" demanded
Angie.  "I am not in the least jealous, I assure you!  He is nothing to
me, I merely object to the underhand way you maneuvered to receive him
alone.  That sort of thing may be all right where you came from, but it
is a little bit too raw to put in practice here."
</p><p>The appearance of the others brought the quarrel to a close and they
went out to the waiting limousine in a constrained silence.  Mrs.
Halstead glanced from her daughter's flushed face to Willa's pale one,
and her lips tightened.  Had Angie been foolish enough to betray
herself to this interloper?
</p><p>Willa was sincerely distressed.  There had never been any real
congeniality between the two girls, but her heart ached for the other's
evident suffering.  Her own conscience was not quite clear for she had
permitted Wiley to show his hand without stopping to think of Angie, so
determined had she been to learn the depths to which this man would
descend in his ruthless self-seeking.  She had weighed her cousin
shrewdly and she did not believe her capable of deep and lasting
affection, yet she shuddered at the thought of any girl's heart in
Starr Wiley's keeping.
</p><p>They were late, as Angie had prophesied.  The Erskine drawing-room was
crowded, and Willa stared about blankly, her mind still burdened with
her cousin's resentment.  Then all at once she became conscious of a
tall figure which disengaged itself from a nearby group and came
eagerly forward.
</p><p>Mechanically she held out her hand, and a voice sounded in her ears
which drove all else from her thoughts and sent the hot-blood flooding
her cheeks and neck in a crimson tide.
</p><p>"We meet again, Miss Murdaugh.  I told you that it would be soon!"
</p><p>She found herself looking up into Kearn Thode's eyes, and the wonder of
it held her dumb.  As unconscious as a child of the instinctive
movement, she extended both hands, and he caught and pressed them
tightly for a moment before releasing them.
</p><p>"Mr. Thode!  I had almost given up hope."  The words sprang to her
lips.  "I thought you would come before and I used to look about for
you everywhere we went at first.  It was silly, of course, for I knew
that you had your work to do down there, but it would have been nice to
see a really familiar face."
</p><p>The young engineer, too, flushed.
</p><p>"I meant to come before, but I was delayed----"  He broke off.  "Was it
so awful then, the first plunge?  May I remind you that you have
fulfilled my prophecy?  Just to look at you now makes me half believe
those Limasito days were a dream!"
</p><p>"They're still real to me," Willa said gravely.  "They are the only
real things and real people I have known.  All this up here--oh! it's
very pleasant, of course, and new and amusing, but it doesn't reach
deep down.  It doesn't seem to mean anything."
</p><p>"So soon?"  He raised his eyebrows in whimsical dismay.  "My sister
wrote me of your success and I was very glad.  I knew it would not
change you, but I did not think the glamour would wear off so quickly."
</p><p>"Your sister?" Willa cried.  "I'm so sorry that I only met her once.
She dined with us, but since then I have not seen her.  I should like
to have known her better."
</p><p>"She called twice, but you were not at home.  After that she went South
and she has only just returned.  May I bring her to call to-morrow?"
</p><p>"I shall be delighted," Willa paused, regarding him with a little,
puzzled frown.  "Do you know you have changed, somehow, Mr. Thode?  You
are ever so much thinner, and pale beneath your tan, and you look--oh,
almost as if you had been suffering!  Am I imagining things, or have
you been ill?"
</p><p>"I had an accident just after you left Limasito.  It was nothing
serious, just a slight concussion, but it laid me up for some weeks,"
Thode replied easily.  "That is what delayed my work and prevented my
return before."
</p><p>He looked beyond her as he spoke, and his face darkened swiftly.
Willa, noting the transition, glanced over her shoulder to see Starr
Wiley, smiling and urbane, standing just within the doorway.
</p><p>"Another reminder of Limasito," she remarked.  "A most unwelcome one.
But tell me about your accident.  I am so sorry----"
</p><p>His hostess claimed Thode at that juncture and bore him away to fresh
introductions, and Willa started across the room to Mrs. Halstead when
Starr Wiley intercepted her coolly.
</p><p>"How do you do?" he asked.  Then, without waiting for her reply, he
went on: "But that is a superfluous question, isn't it?  You are
looking as distractingly charming as ever.  So our knight errant has
put in an appearance once more!  He looks a little the worse for wear."
</p><p>"Mr. Thode has been ill," Willa remarked through stiffened lips.
"There was an accident----"
</p><p>"A hootch bottle in the hands of a jealous Señorita becomes an
effective weapon, but I would call it more like fate than accident."
Wiley laughed unpleasantly.  "There were some interesting rumors afloat
about our friend's conquests after your departure from Limasito.  He'd
be an expert porch-climber if his practice in gaining access to certain
balconies on certain back streets counted for anything.  I could have
told you before, but I did not want to shatter your illusions
concerning the local Paul Revere."
</p><p>"You are trying to now, however."  Willa looked straight into his eyes
and then quickly away in immeasurable disdain.  "I have no ears for
idle, malicious slander, Mr. Wiley.  Please, let me pass."
</p><p>"It does rather jar on one, doesn't it?  A reminder of the low,
primitive life down there is out of place in this highly esthetic
atmosphere."  He made no move to step aside, and a shade of deeper
meaning crept into his tones.  "It would be a pity if one were
compelled to return to it.  The charms of Limasito would pall, I fancy,
after all this; yet such things sometimes happen."
</p><p>"I trust not, for your sake," Willa responded.  "You would scarcely
find the climate of Limasito a healthy one, if your activities were
fully comprehended there."
</p><p>"I was not thinking of myself----" he smiled once more--"but of an old
fairy tale which I mentioned to you in the Park.  You look a very
confident Cinderella, but midnight is not far off, and only you can
stop the hands of the clock, remember."
</p><p>"I am not fond of riddles."  Willa shrugged and turned away to greet
her host, who came forward with one of the inevitable callow youths in
tow.
</p><p>Dinner was announced almost immediately and Willa sat through it with
the food untouched before her.  Wiley's insinuations against Kearn
Thode she had dismissed utterly from her thoughts, but his renewed
taunt of the morning filled her in spite of herself with dread
foreboding.  Could fate have indeed been playing with her after all,
and was it possible that Wiley held within his hands the strings of her
future destiny?
</p><p>She was Willa Murdaugh, of course.  Mason North and the Halsteads had
satisfied themselves of that beyond a shadow of a doubt.  But what if
Wiley had really stumbled upon some facts unknown to them all which
might throw a shadow across her title?  Was it an idle threat to coerce
her or a very tangible menace?
</p><p>She raised troubled eyes to meet Kearn Thode's smiling ones across the
table and her native courage came back in a swift rush.  Surely she had
nothing to fear; she would meet Wiley and beat him at his own game, and
then . . . she smiled again into Thode's eyes.  What did anything else
matter, now that he had returned?
</p><p>An informal dance was the order of the evening and Willa and the young
engineer gravitated to a seat on the stairs after a romping fox-trot.
Both were flushed and sparkling, but when they found themselves alone
together a diffident silence fell upon them.
</p><p>"It must seem good to you to get back," Willa ventured at last when the
pause had become oppressive.
</p><p>"It is."  His glance rested upon her with a world of contentment.  "I
can't begin to tell you how wonderful it seems!"
</p><p>"And your work down there?" she pursued hurriedly.  "You have finished
it?  You will not have to return again?"
</p><p>The contentment faded and in its place there came a look of bitterness
and dogged determination.
</p><p>"It has scarcely begun.  I wonder if you ever heard an old legend
around Limasito concerning the lost location of a marvelous oil well?"
</p><p>Willa laughed nervously, a little taken aback by the abruptness of the
question.
</p><p>"One hears so many legends in every country of lost or buried or hidden
treasure," she parried.  "Scarcely anyone pays attention to them except
the tenderfoots.  You know up in the mining country one is forever
hearing such tales of vast deposits of ore, but nobody can ever find
the lead."
</p><p>"This particular one concerns a well in a mysterious pool of water
where a massacre is supposed to have taken place.  It dates back to the
time of the Spaniards' coming."
</p><p>He paused, but Willa said nothing.  She was striving to mask her
thoughts in continued composure lest his quick mind grasp the
significance of her interest.
</p><p>"The place is spoken of as the Pool of the Lost Souls," Thode went on.
"Surely you have heard of it?  The people to whom you were so kind, old
Tia Juana and her grandson, knew more than anyone else about it.  Did
they not mention it to you?"
</p><p>"Tia Juana?"  Willa glanced up quickly, but she could not meet his
eyes.  "She is very secretive, you know, and jealous of the old legends
which to her form the sacred history of her beloved country.  Suppose
you tell me the legend yourself."
</p><p>Briefly he recounted it to her and, she listened until the end in a
dismayed chaos of mind which culminated in a staggering blow.
</p><p>"I have found it."  There was no jubilation in his tone, but
paradoxically a note of defeat.
</p><p>"You!" she stammered breathlessly.
</p><p>"Yes.  You seem surprised?" he added with a quick glance at her.  "I
know these old legends are mostly regarded as bunk, but now and then
one proves to be a straight tip.  Generations have searched vainly for
the Pool, as I thought you must have heard, but they did not know where
to look."
</p><p>"Then how did you, a newcomer, discover it?"  Willa scarcely recognized
her own voice.
</p><p>"By the simple expedient of following someone else who had stolen a
march on me in a despicable fashion."  His jaw set in the old
characteristic way she remembered.  "I don't mind admitting that I
would have taken almost any means to locate it; that was my main
objective in Mexico and I was acting under instructions from my chief.
But I would scarcely have stooped to the method employed by the man of
whom I speak."
</p><p>"Starr Wiley?"  The question was wrung from Willa's lips.
</p><p>He stared at her.
</p><p>"You know, then?"
</p><p>"I--I guessed," she countered hurriedly.  "I knew that you two were
enemies, of course, and it came to me that if anyone had played a false
trick upon you it must have been he.  You say you found the Pool by
following him.  How did he know where to search?"
</p><p>Thode hesitated.
</p><p>"I found a map of its location, but I had scarcely got my hands upon it
when I was struck down from behind and the paper stolen."
</p><p>Willa uttered a startled exclamation, but he continued, unheeding.
</p><p>"Someone found me, hours later, lying unconscious and carried me into
Limasito, where your good friend, Jim Baggott, took care of me.  It was
weeks before I was able to be about again, but I had time to think it
all out, Of course, I had not seen my assailant, but I had had an
uncanny intuition all day that I was being shadowed--it was the very
day of your departure, by the way--and I knew of only one other beside
myself who had taken that legend seriously.  Wiley was doing his best
to locate the Pool; he was aware that I was there for the same purpose
and he would have stopped at nothing to win out, for, as you know,
there was bad blood between us.  If he did not actually strike the blow
that felled me I solemnly believe that he was instrumental in it in
some way.  Please, don't think me ungenerous toward an enemy that I
tell you this, or even harbor such a thought, but events really seemed
to bear out my suspicions."
</p><p>"No."  Willa was gazing moodily straight before her.  "I do not think
you are ungenerous, and I am very glad that you are telling me.  I
believe, too, that you are right; I feel sure that he must have been
responsible for your injury.  But I am amazed about the map."
</p><p>"I found it in the ashes of Tia Juana's fire; the little fire in the
grove of zapote trees where she cooked her tortillas, and brewed her
strange concoctions.  You had told me of it, do you remember?  But
perhaps you have not heard: Tia Juana and the boy, José, have
disappeared.  They must have gone on the very day you started for New
York, and no one has been able to discover a trace of them, except one.
That is a very significant trace indeed, though.--Have you no curiosity
about the Pool?"
</p><p>He turned to her suddenly, but Willa could not raise her eyes to meet
his now.
</p><p>"Of course," she stammered.
</p><p>"It is located on a grapefruit ranch known as the Trevino hacienda,
about two hundred miles due north of Limasito.  Wiley made the best of
his time while I was laid by the heels, but his treachery didn't do him
any good, in the end.  He found the Pool, but another had been before
him; old Tia Juana, herself!"
</p><p>Willa's lips moved, but no sound came from them.  She was praying that
he would not look at her again.
</p><p>"A few days before Tia Juana and the boy disappeared, the Trevino
hacienda changed hands.  It was sold for twenty-five thousand dollars,
to one Juana Reyes.--Reyes, if you recall, was the name of the old
Spaniard who owned the Pool originally and whose daughter, Dolores, was
killed by the Indians on her wedding night.  Reyes is also the almost
forgotten surname of Tia Juana, so it looks as if the old lady had come
into her own, at last.  It is a mystery, of course, where she got the
money to purchase the hacienda, but it may have been hoarded in her
family for generations.  It is possible, too, that she only then
succeeded in deciphering the map, and tracing the location of the Pool
from it."
</p><p>"So you and Starr Wiley both failed."  Willa spoke as if to herself.
</p><p>"Not I!"  Thode's eyes flashed with determination.  "I told you I had
only just begun.  I am going to find Tia Juana if she is above ground
and buy out her claim.  To her it only means the ancestral estate.
That is much, to be sure, if she has gone through her long life in
poverty and want in order to hoard her riches for its purchase, but it
is only a sentimental consideration.  When she learns that she has a
fortune in petroleum, worthless without the money to develop it, I
think she will agree to share her interest.  The casa and the land
about it can still be hers, we only want to drain and develop the Pool,
and my chief will be strictly fair with her.  The old lady will be rich
beyond her wildest dreams and we will have the greatest producer known
since the Dos Bocas gusher went up in flames!"
</p><p>Willa rose.
</p><p>"If you find Tia Juana, Mr. Thode, don't build your hopes too high.
Should she prove to be indeed the owner of the Pool of the Lost Souls,
I am confident that you can never gain possession of it."
</p><p>"I can try."  He took the hand she held out to him.  "You seem very
sure, Miss Murdaugh."
</p><p>"I cannot imagine Tia Juana relinquishing anything which she could
claim, especially if, as you surmise, the property may once have
belonged to her ancestors.  Cousin Irene is signaling me.  I must go!"
she added.  "You will come to-morrow?"
</p><p>Thode promised, but he watched her slender figure disappear with a
frown of troubled thought.  How much did she know?  Could it be that
she, too, was interested in the Pool of the Lost Souls?  Instead of a
mere contest between himself and Wiley had it become a three-corner
affair, with Willa the apex of the triangle?
</p><p>Had he but known it, he was destined not to keep his promise of the
morrow, and once more it was Starr Wiley who intervened.
</p><p>It happened that Thode stopped in at the club after taking leave of the
Erskines, and arrived at a most opportune moment.  He was emerging from
the coat-room when a familiar voice came to his ears through the
half-open door of one of the smaller card-rooms, and the words arrested
him like a command.
</p><p>"The little Murdaugh?  Very naïve, very charming, but I knew her in the
Never-Never Land, you know, and I can assure you she's not as
unsophisticated as she seems."
</p><p>"Oh, come, Starr!  You're tight!" a strange voice intervened.  "Ladies'
names, you know----it's not done here."
</p><p>"'Lady'?" Wiley hiccoughed derisively.  "Who mentioned a lady?  I'm
speakin' of Willa Murdaugh.  Gentleman Geoff's Billie they used to call
her; pet of an old card-sharp, and mascot of a gambling-hell----"
</p><p>He got no farther.  Someone had seized him by the shoulders and spun
him around like a top and he found himself confronting Kearn Thode's
blazing eyes.  His half-fuddled companions shrank back in consternation.
</p><p>"Take that back, you miserable cur!"  Thode's voice was scarcely
recognizable.  "Take back your damnable lies or I'll ram them down your
throat!"
</p><p>But an alcoholic courage possessed Wiley and he leered: "The
knight-errant, by Jove!  You know whether it's true or not!  You ought
to know better than anyone else----"
</p><p>A crashing blow straight on his maudlin mouth sent him reeling back
against the table.  His wildly groping hand found a tall glass and with
an oath he hurled it full in the face of the man advancing upon him.  A
moment later, he was lifted clear of the table by an impact that flung
him against the wall a sodden, inert heap with the last ray of dazed
consciousness gone.
