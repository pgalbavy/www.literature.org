<p><h1>THE WHOLE OF THE STORY</h1>
</p>
<p>I do not know whether many people realize how much more than is ever
written there really is in a story--how many parts of it are never
told--how much more really happened than there is in the book one holds
in one's hand and pores over. Stories are something like letters. When a
letter is written, how often one remembers things omitted and says, "Ah,
why did I not tell them that?" In writing a book one relates all that
one remembers at the time, and if one told all that really happened
perhaps the book would never end. Between the lines of every story there
is another story, and that is one that is never heard and can only be
guessed at by the people who are good at guessing. The person who writes
the story may never know all of it, but sometimes he does and wishes he
had the chance to begin again.</u>
</p><p>When I wrote the story of "Sara Crewe" I guessed that a great deal
more had happened at Miss Minchin's than I had had time to find out
just then. I knew, of course, that there must have been chapters full
of things going on all the time; and when I began to make a play out
of the book and called it "A Little Princess," I discovered three acts
full of things. What interested me most was that I found that there
had been girls at the school whose names I had not even known before.
There was a little girl whose name was Lottie, who was an amusing
little person; there was a hungry scullery-maid who was Sara's adoring
friend; Ermengarde was much more entertaining than she had seemed at
first; things happened in the garret which had never been hinted at in
the book; and a certain gentleman whose name was Melchisedec was an
intimate friend of Sara's who should never have been left out of the
story if he had only walked into it in time. He and Becky and Lottie
lived at Miss Minchin's, and I cannot understand why they did not
mention themselves to me at first. They were as real as Sara, and it
was careless of them not to come out of the story shadowland and say,
"Here I am--tell about me." But they did not--which was their fault
and not mine. People who live in the story one is writing ought to
come forward at the beginning and tap the writing person on the
shoulder and say, "Hallo, what about me?" If they don't, no one can
be blamed but themselves and their slouching, idle ways.
</p><p>After the play of "A Little Princess" was produced in New York, and so
many children went to see it and liked Becky and Lottie and Melchisedec,
my publishers asked me if I could not write Sara's story over again and
put into it all the things and people who had been left out before, and
so I have done it; and when I began I found there were actually pages
and pages of things which had happened that had never been put even into
the play, so in this new "Little Princess" I have put all I have been
able to discover.
