<p>  _(Extracts from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P.)_
</p>
<p>It is an extraordinary thing that I never seem to get any peace.
I am a man who likes a quiet life. I like my Club, my rubber of
Bridge, a well-cooked meal, a sound wine. I like England in the
summer, and the Riviera in the winter. I have no desire to
participate in sensational happenings. Sometimes, in front of a
good fire, I do not object to reading about them in the newspaper.
But that is as far as I am willing to go. My object in life is to
be thoroughly comfortable. I have devoted a certain amount of
thought, and a considerable amount of money, to further that end.
But I cannot say that I always succeed. If things do not actually
happen to me, they happen round me, and frequently, in spite of
myself, I become involved. I hate being involved.
</p><p>All this because Guy Pagett came into my bedroom this morning with
a telegram in his hand and a face as long as a mute at a funeral.
</p><p>Guy Pagett is my secretary, a zealous, painstaking, hard-working
fellow, admirable in every respect. I know no one who annoys me
more. For a long time I have been racking my brains as to how to
get rid of him. But you cannot very well dismiss a secretary
because he prefers work to play, likes getting up early in the
morning, and has positively no vices. The only amusing thing about
the fellow is his face. He has the face of a fourteenth-century
poisoner—the sort of man the Borgias got to do their odd jobs for
them.
</p><p>I wouldn’t mind so much if Pagett didn’t make me work too. My idea
of work is something that should be undertaken lightly and
airily—trifled with, in fact! I doubt if Guy Pagett has ever
trifled with anything in his life. He takes everything seriously.
That is what makes him so difficult to live with.
</p><p>Last week I had the brilliant idea of sending him off to Florence.
He talked about Florence and how much he wanted to go there.
</p><p>“My dear fellow,” I cried, “you shall go to-morrow. I will pay all
your expenses.”
</p><p>January isn’t the usual time for going to Florence, but it would
be all one to Pagett. I could imagine him going about, guide-book
in hand, religiously doing all the picture galleries. And a week’s
freedom was cheap to me at the price.
</p><p>It has been a delightful week. I have done everything I wanted to,
and nothing that I did not want to do. But when I blinked my eyes
open, and perceived Pagett standing between me and the light at
the unearthly hour of 9 a.m. this morning, I realized that freedom
was over.
</p><p>“My dear fellow,” I said, “has the funeral already taken place, or
is it for later in the morning?”
</p><p>Pagett does not appreciate dry humour. He merely stared.
</p><p>“So you know, Sir Eustace?”
</p><p>“Know what?” I said crossly. “From the expression of your face I
inferred that one of your near and dear relatives was to be interred
this morning.”
</p><p>Pagett ignored the sally as far as possible.
</p><p>“I thought you couldn’t know about this.” He tapped the telegram.
“I know you dislike being aroused early—but it <u>is</u> nine
o’clock”—Pagett insists on regarding 9 a.m. as practically the
middle of the day—“and I thought that under the circumstances——”
He tapped the telegram again.
</p><p>“What is that thing?” I asked.
</p><p>“It’s a telegram from the police at Marlow. A woman has been
murdered in your house.”
</p><p>That aroused me in earnest.
</p><p>“What colossal cheek,” I exclaimed. “Why in <u>my</u> house? Who murdered
her?”
</p><p>“They don’t say. I suppose we shall go back to England at once,
Sir Eustace?”
</p><p>“You need suppose nothing of the kind. Why should we go back?”
</p><p>“The police——”
</p><p>“What on earth have I to do with the police?”
</p><p>“Well, it was your house.”
</p><p>“That,” I said, “appears to be more my misfortune than my fault.”
</p><p>Guy Pagett shook his head gloomily.
</p><p>“It will have a very unfortunate effect upon the constituency,” he
remarked lugubriously.
</p><p>I don’t see why it should have—and yet I have a feeling that in
such matters Pagett’s instincts are always right. On the face of
it, a Member of Parliament will be none the less efficient because
a stray young woman comes and gets herself murdered in an empty
house that belongs to him—but there is no accounting for the view
the respectable British public takes of a matter.
</p><p>“She’s a foreigner too, and that makes it worse,” continued Pagett
gloomily.
</p><p>Again I believe he is right. If it is disreputable to have a woman
murdered in your house, it becomes more disreputable if the woman
is a foreigner. Another idea struck me.
</p><p>“Good heavens,” I exclaimed, “I hope this won’t upset Caroline.”
</p><p>Caroline is the lady who cooks for me. Incidentally she is the wife
of my gardener. What kind of a wife she makes I do not know, but
she is an excellent cook. James, on the other hand, is not a good
gardener—but I support him in idleness and give him the lodge to
live in solely on account of Caroline’s cooking.
</p><p>“I don’t suppose she’ll stay after this,” said Pagett.
</p><p>“You always were a cheerful fellow,” I said.
</p><p>I expect I shall have to go back to England. Pagett clearly intends
that I shall. And there is Caroline to pacify.
</p><p><u>Three days later.</u>
</p><p>It is incredible to me that any one who can get away from England
in winter does not do so! It is an abominable climate. All this
trouble is very annoying. The house-agents say it will be next to
impossible to let the Mill House after all the publicity. Caroline
has been pacified—with double pay. We could have sent her a cable
to that effect from Cannes. In fact, as I have said all along,
there was no earthly purpose to serve by our coming over. I shall
go back to-morrow.
</p><p><u>One day later.</u>
</p><p>Several very surprising things have occurred. To begin with, I met
Augustus Milray, the most perfect example of an old ass the present
Government has produced. His manner oozed diplomatic secrecy as he
drew me aside in the Club into a quiet corner. He talked a good
deal. About South Africa and the industrial situation there. About
the growing rumours of a strike on the Rand. Of the secret causes
actuating that strike. I listened as patiently as I could. Finally,
he dropped his voice to a whisper and explained that certain
documents had come to light which ought to be placed in the hands
of General Smuts.
</p><p>“I’ve no doubt you’re quite right,” I said, stifling a yawn.
</p><p>“But how are we to get them to him? Our position in the matter is
delicate—very delicate.”
</p><p>“What’s wrong with the post?” I said cheerfully. “Put a two-penny
stamp on and drop ’em in the nearest letter-box.”
</p><p>He seemed quite shocked at the suggestion.
</p><p>“My dear Pedler! The common post!”
</p><p>It has always been a mystery to me why Governments employ Kings’
Messengers and draw such attention to their confidential documents.
</p><p>“If you don’t like the post, send one of your young Foreign Office
fellows. He’ll enjoy the trip.”
</p><p>“Impossible,” said Milray, wagging his head in a senile fashion.
“There are reasons, my dear Pedler—I assure you there are reasons.”
</p><p>“Well,” I said, rising, “all this is very interesting, but I must
be off——”
</p><p>“One minute, my dear Pedler, one minute, I beg of you. Now tell
me, in confidence, is it not true that you intend visiting South
Africa shortly yourself? You have large interests in Rhodesia, I
know, and the question of Rhodesia joining in the Union is one in
which you have a vital interest.”
</p><p>“Well, I had thought of going out in about a month’s time.”
</p><p>“You couldn’t possibly make it sooner? This month? This week, in
fact?”
</p><p>“I could,” I said, eyeing him with some interest. “But I don’t know
that I particularly want to.”
</p><p>“You would be doing the Government a great service—a very great
service. You would not find them—er—ungrateful.”
</p><p>“Meaning, you want me to be the postman?”
</p><p>“Exactly. Your position is an unofficial one, your journey is <u>bona
fide.</u> Everything would be eminently satisfactory.”
</p><p>“Well,” I said slowly, “I don’t mind if I do. The one thing I am
anxious to do is to get out of England again as soon as possible.”
</p><p>“You will find the climate of South Africa delightful—quite
delightful.”
</p><p>“My dear fellow, I know all about the climate. I was out there
shortly before the war.”
</p><p>“I am really much obliged to you, Pedler. I will send you round
the package by messenger. To be placed in General Smuts’s own
hands, you understand? The <u>Kilmorden Castle</u> sails on Saturday—quite
a good boat.”
</p><p>I accompanied him a short way along Pall Mall before we parted. He
shook me warmly by the hand, and thanked me again effusively.
</p><p>I walked home reflecting on the curious by-ways of Governmental
policy.
</p><p>It was the following evening that Jarvis, my butler, informed me
that a gentleman wished to see me on private business, but declined
to give his name. I have always a lively apprehension of insurance
touts, so told Jarvis to say I could not see him. Guy Pagett,
unfortunately, when he might for once have been of real use, was
laid up with a bilious attack. These earnest, hard-working young
men with weak stomachs are always liable to bilious attacks.
</p><p>Jarvis returned.
</p><p>“The gentleman asked me to tell you, Sir Eustace, that he comes to
you from Mr. Milray.”
</p><p>That altered the complexion of things. A few minutes later I was
confronting my visitor in the library. He was a well-built young
fellow with a deeply tanned face. A scar ran diagonally from the
corner of his eye to the jaw, disfiguring what would otherwise have
been a handsome though somewhat reckless countenance.
</p><p>“Well,” I said, “what’s the matter?”
</p><p>“Mr. Milray sent me to you, Sir Eustace. I am to accompany you to
South Africa as your secretary.”
</p><p>“My dear fellow,” I said, “I’ve got a secretary already. I don’t
want another.”
</p><p>“I think you do, Sir Eustace. Where is your secretary now?”
</p><p>“He’s down with a bilious attack,” I explained.
</p><p>“You are sure it’s only a bilious attack?”
</p><p>“Of course it is. He’s subject to them.”
</p><p>My visitor smiled.
</p><p>“It may or may not be a bilious attack. Time will show. But I can
tell you this, Sir Eustace, Mr. Milray would not be surprised if
an attempt were made to get your secretary out of the way. Oh, you
need have no fear for yourself”—I suppose a momentary alarm had
flickered across my face—“you are not threatened. Your secretary
out of the way, access to you would be easier. In any case, Mr.
Milray wishes me to accompany you. The passage-money will be our
affair, of course, but you will take the necessary steps about the
passport, as though you had decided that you needed the services
of a second secretary.”
</p><p>He seemed a determined young man. We stared at each other and he
stared me down.
</p><p>“Very well,” I said feebly.
</p><p>“You will say nothing to any one as to my accompanying you.”
</p><p>“Very well,” I said again.
</p><p>After all, perhaps it was better to have this fellow with me, but
I had a premonition that I was getting into deep waters. Just when
I thought I had attained peace!
</p><p>I stopped my visitor as he was turning to depart.
</p><p>“It might be just as well if I knew my new secretary’s name,” I
observed sarcastically.
</p><p>He considered for a minute.
</p><p>“Harry Rayburn seems quite a suitable name,” he observed.
</p><p>It was a curious way of putting it.
</p><p>“Very well,” I said for the third time.
