<p>I had hardly recovered from the surprise into which this new
discovery had plunged me, when Rouletabille touched me on the
shoulder and asked me to follow him into his room.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do there?"</p>

<p>"To think the matter over."</p>

<p>I confess I was in no condition for doing much thinking, nor
could I understand how Rouletabille could so control himself as
to be able calmly to sit down for reflection when he must have
known that Mademoiselle Stangerson was at that moment almost on
the point of death. But his self-control was more than I could
explain. Closing the door of his room, he motioned me to a chair
and, seating himself before me, took out his pipe. We sat there
for some time in silence and then I fell asleep.</p>

<p>When I awoke it was daylight. It was eight o’clock by my watch.
Rouletabille was no longer in the room. I rose to go out when
the door opened and my friend re-entered. He had evidently lost
no time.</p>

<p>"How about Mademoiselle Stangerson?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"Her condition, though very alarming, is not desperate."</p>

<p>"When did you leave this room?"</p>

<p>"Towards dawn."</p>

<p>"I guess you have been hard at work?"</p>

<p>"Rather!"</p>

<p>"Have you found out anything?"</p>

<p>"Two sets of footprints!"</p>

<p>"Do they explain anything?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have they anything to do with the mystery of the keeper’s body?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the mystery is no longer a mystery. This morning, walking
round the chateau, I found two distinct sets of footprints, made
at the same time, last night. They were made by two persons walking
side by side. I followed them from the court towards the oak grove.
Larsan joined me. They were the same kind of footprints as were
made at the time of the assault in "The Yellow Room"&mdash;one set
was from clumsy boots and the other was made by neat ones, except
that the big toe of one of the sets was of a different size from
the one measured in "The Yellow Room" incident. I compared the
marks with the paper patterns I had previously made.</p>

<p>"Still following the tracks of the prints, Larsan and I passed
out of the oak grove and reached the border of the lake. There
they turned off to a little path leading to the high road to Epinay
where we lost the traces in the newly macadamised highway.</p>

<p>"We went back to the chateau and parted at the courtyard. We
met again, however, in Daddy Jacques’s room to which our separate
trains of thinking had led us both. We found the old servant in
bed. His clothes on the chair were wet through and his boots very
muddy. He certainly did not get into that state in helping us
to carry the body of the keeper. It was not raining then. Then
his face showed extreme fatigue and he looked at us out of terror-stricken
eyes.</p>

<p>"On our first questioning him he told us that he had gone to
bed immediately after the doctor had arrived. On pressing him,
however, for it was evident to us he was not speaking the truth,
he confessed that he had been away from the chateau. He explained
his absence by saying that he had a headache and went out into
the fresh air, but had gone no further than the oak grove. When
we then described to him the whole route he had followed, he sat
up in bed trembling.</p>

<p>"‘And you were not alone!’ cried Larsan.</p>

<p>"‘Did you see it then?’ gasped Daddy Jacques.</p>

<p>"‘What?’ I asked.</p>

<p>"‘The phantom&mdash;the black phantom!’</p>

<p>"Then he told us that for several nights he had seen what he
kept calling the black phantom. It came into the park at the stroke
of midnight and glided stealthily through the trees; it appeared
to him to pass through the trunks of the trees. Twice he had seen
it from his window, by the light of the moon and had risen and
followed the strange apparition. The night before last he had
almost overtaken it; but it had vanished at the corner of the
donjon. Last night, however, he had not left the chateau, his
mind being disturbed by a presentiment that some new crime would
be attempted. Suddenly he saw the black phantom rush out from
somewhere in the middle of the court. He followed it to the lake
and to the high road to Epinay, where the phantom suddenly disappeared.</p>

<p>"‘Did you see his face?’ demanded Larsan.</p>

<p>"‘No! &mdash;I saw nothing but black veils.’</p>

<p>"‘Did you go out after what passed on the gallery?’</p>

<p>"‘I could not! &mdash;I was terrified.’</p>

<p>"‘Daddy Jacques,’ I said, in a threatening voice, ‘you did not
follow it; you and the phantom walked to Epinay together&mdash;arm
in arm!’</p>

<p>"‘No!’ he cried, turning his eyes away, ‘I did not. It came on
to pour, and &mdash;I turned back. I don’t know what became of
the black phantom."</p>

<p>"We left him, and when we were outside I turned to Larsan, looking
him full in the face, and put my question suddenly to take him
off his guard:</p>

<p>"‘An accomplice?’</p>

<p>"‘How can I tell?’ he replied, shrugging his shoulders. ‘You
can’t be sure of anything in a case like this. Twenty-four hours
ago I would have sworn that there was no accomplice!’ He left
me saying he was off to Epinay."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you make of it?" I asked Rouletabille, after he
had ended his recital. "Personally I am utterly in the dark. I
can’t make anything out of it. What do you gather?"</p>

<p>"Everything! Everything!" he exclaimed. "But," he said abruptly,
"let’s find out more about Mademoiselle Stangerson."</p>
