<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Outside of the kangarooing of Rubes, the coming and going of prisoners,
and such exceptional entertainment as that put up by Pecos Dalhart
upon his initiation into the brotherhood, there were only two events a
day in the Geronimo jail—breakfast and dinner. Breakfast, as with the
French, was served late, and dinner at the hour of four. On account
of the caterer being otherwise engaged in the early morning the
<u>café-au-lait</u> in bed was dispensed with and <u>déjeuner</u> served promptly
at nine. It was a hard-looking aggregation of citizens that crept out
of their cells at the clanging of the interlocking gates and there was
not a man among them who dared look Pecos in the eye as they slunk
down the corridor to wash. Battered in body and cowed in spirit they
glanced up at him deprecatingly as he stood with the strap in his hand,
and there was no mercy written in the cattle-rustler's scowling visage.
These were the men who would have put their heels in his face if he
had gone down before their rush—they were cowards and ran in packs,
like wolves. They were grafters, too; the slinking, servile slaves of
jail alcaldes, yegg sheriffs, and Boone Morgan's swaggering deputies.
More than that, they would mob him if he gave them half a chance. So he
stood silent, watching them, man after man, and there was not one who
could look him in the face.
</p><p>It was Bill Todhunter who opened the gates that morning—the same
keen-eyed, silent deputy who had fetched Pecos down from the
mountains—and as his former prisoner, now transformed into the stern
master of Geronimo jail, came near, he looked him over gravely.
</p><p>"Feelin' any better?" he inquired.
</p><p>"Nope," scowled Pecos, and there the matter dropped. After the affair
of the night before he had expected to be put in irons, at least, or
thrown into the dungeon, but nobody seemed to be worrying about him,
and the prison routine went on as usual. The drunks in the jag-cell
woke up and began to wrangle; the long-termers in the deck above
scuffled sullenly around over the resounding boiler plate; and from
the outer office they could hear the cheerful voices of old-timers
and politicians discussing affairs of state. A long-term trusty came
clattering down the iron stairs and passed out through the two barred
doors to work up an appetite for breakfast by mowing the court-house
lawn. As for Pecos, he was used to having his breakfast early and his
Trojan exertions of the night before had left him gaunted, though he
carried off his stoic part bravely. Nevertheless he showed a more than
human interest in the steel front gate, and when at last, just as the
clock tolled nine, it swung open, admitting the Chinese <u>restaurateur</u>
who contracted for their meals, there was a general chorus of
approval. Hung Wo was the name of this caterer to the incarcerated,
and he looked it; but though his face was not designed for a laughing
picture his shoulders were freighted with two enormous cans which
more than made up for that. Without a word to any one he lowered the
cans to the floor, jerked off the covers, and began to dish up on the
prison plates. To every man he gave exactly the same—a big spoonful of
beans, a potato, a hunk of meat, half a loaf of bread, and a piece of
pie—served with the rapidity of an automaton.
</p><p>Without waiting for orders the prisoners retreated noisily into their
cells and waited, the more fastidious shoving sheets of newspaper
through the small openings at the bottom of their doors to keep their
plates off the floor. But here again there was trouble. The incessant
hammering of pint coffee cups emphasized the starved impatience of
the inmates; the food grew cold on the plates; only one thing lay in
the way of the belated breakfast—Pecos refused to go into a cell.
Before the fall of the kangaroo court it had been the privilege and
prerogative of Mike Slattery to remain in the corridor and assist
in the distribution of the food, but Mike was in the bridal chamber
now with his jowls swathed in cotton, sucking a little nourishment
through a tube. Pete Monat was there also, his head bandaged to the
limit of the physician's art, and mourning the fate which had left him
such a hard-looking mug on the eve of a jury trial. The verdict would
be guilty, that was a cinch. But at least Pete was able to eat his
breakfast, whereas there were about forty avid kangaroos in the tanks
who were raising their combined voices in one agonizing appeal for
food. It was a desperate situation, but Pecos, as usual, was obdurate.
</p><p>"Let the Chink come in—I won't hurt 'im!" he said; but Bill Todhunter
shook his head.
</p><p>"The Chink won't come," he said.
</p><p>"Whassa malla <u>Mike</u>?" inquired Hung Wo nervously. "He go Yuma?"
</p><p>"No, Charley," returned Todhunter, "last night he have one hell of a
big fight—this man break his jaw."
</p><p>"Whassa malla <u>Pete</u>?"
</p><p>"This man break his head with chair."
</p><p>"Ooo!" breathed Hung Wo, peering through the bars, "me no go in."
</p><p>"Well, now, you see what you git for your cussedness," observed the
deputy coldly. "The Chink won't come in and the chances are you'll
starve to death; that is, providin' them other fellers don't beat you
to death first, for makin' 'em lose their breakfast. Feelin' pretty
cagey, ain't they?"
</p><p>They were, and Pecos realized that if he didn't square himself with
Hung Wo right away and get him to feed the animals, he would have a
bread riot on his hands later—and besides, he was hungry himself. So he
spoke quickly and to the point.
</p><p>"What's the matter, Charley?" he expostulated, "you 'fraid of me?"
</p><p>"Me no likee!" said the Chinaman impersonally.
</p><p>"No, of course not; but here—lemme tell you! You savvy Pete Monat—all
same alcalde, eh? You savvy Mike—all same boss, hey? Well, last night
me lick Pete and Mike. You see this strap? All right; <u>me</u> boss now—you
give me big pie every day, you come in!"
</p><p>"Me no got big pie to-day," protested Hung Wo anxiously.
</p><p>"Oh, that's all right—me takum other feller's pie, this time—you come
in!"
</p><p>"Allite!" agreed the simple-minded Oriental, and when the iron doors
rolled apart he entered without a quiver. Back where he came from a
bargain is a bargain and it is a poor boss indeed who does not demand
his rake-off. The day was won and, throwing back his head imperiously,
Pecos stalked down the line of cells until he came to the one where the
inmates were making the most noise.
</p><p>"Here!" he said, and when they looked up he remarked: "You fellers are
too gay to suit me—I'll jest dock you your pieces of pie!" And when the
Chinaman arrived Pecos carefully lifted the pie from each plate and
piled all up on his own. "This'll teach you to keep your mouths shut!"
he observed, and retiring to the iron gates he squatted down on his
heels and ate greedily.
</p><p>"Well, the son-of-a-gun," murmured Bill Todhunter, as he took notice
of this final triumph, and the men in the cells became as quiet as a
cage of whip-broke beasts when the lion tamer stands in their midst.
As Pecos Dalhart drank his second cup of coffee and finished up the
last slab of pie a realizing sense of his mastery came over him and he
smiled grimly at the watchful faces that peered out through the cell
gratings, blinking and mowing like monkeys in a zoo. They were beaten,
that was plain, but somehow as he looked them over he was conscious of
a primordial cunning written on every savage visage—they bowed before
him; but like the leopards before their tamer, they crouched, too. That
was it—they crouched and bided their time, and when the time came they
would hurl themselves at his throat. But what was it for which they
were waiting? All the morning he pondered on it as he paced to and fro
or sat with his back to the bars, watching. Then, as the day warmed up
and his head sank momentarily against his breast he woke with a start
to behold a prison-bleached hand reaching, reaching for his strap.
Instantly he rose up from his place and dealt out a just retribution,
laying on his strap with the accuracy of a horse-wrangler, but even
with the howling of his victim in his ears he was afraid, for he read
the hidden meaning of that act. With the nerveless patience of the
beast they were waiting for him to go to sleep!
</p><p>Once before, on the open range, Pecos Dalhart had arrayed himself
against society, and lost, even as he was losing now. Sooner or later,
by day or by night, these skulking hyenas of the jail-pack would catch
him asleep, and he shuddered to think how they might mangle him. He
saw it clearly now, the fate of the man who stands alone, without a
friend to watch over him or a government to protect his life. Not in
two hurly-burly days and nights had he closed his bloodshot eyes,
and as the heaviness of sleep crept upon him he paced up and down
the corridor, wrestling with the spectre that was stealing away his
wits and hoping against hope that Boone Morgan would come to his aid,
for Boone had seen his finish from the first. In sodden abandonment
to his destiny he looked one of the cells over to see if it could be
barricaded, but when one door was open they were all open and there
was no protection against stealth or assault. He had not even the
protection of the cave-dweller who, when sleep overcame him, could
retire and roll a great stone against his door. Yet as the possession
of sleep took hold upon him he routed out the inmates of the cell
nearest to the gate, climbed into the upper bunk and lay there, rigid,
fighting to keep awake.
</p><p>It was quiet now and the shuffling of the long-termers above him came
fainter and fainter; some drunk out in the jag-cell woke up from his
long slumber and began to sing mournfully; and Pecos, struggling
against the deadly anæsthetic of his weariness, listened intently to
every word.
</p><p>    "My friends and relations has caused a separation,"
</p><p>chanted the dirge-like voice of the singer,
</p><p>    "Concerning the part of some favorite one.
    Besides their vexation and great trubbelation
    They will some time be sorry for what they have done."
</p><p>The voice sounded familiar to Pecos—or was it the music?—well, never
mind, he would hear it to the end.
</p><p>    "My fortune is small, I will truly confess it,
    But what I have got it is all of my own,
    I might have lived long in this world and enjoyed it
    If my cruel friends could have left me alone.
</p><p>    "Farewell to this country, I now must leave it,
    And seek my way to some far distant land.
    My horse and my saddle is a source of all pleasure
    And when I meet friend I'll join heart and hand.
</p><p>    "Farewell to the girl that I no more shall see,
    This world is wide and I'll spend it in pleasures,
    And I don't care for no girl that don't care for me,
    I'll drink and be jolly and not care for no downfall.
</p><p>    "I'll drownd my troubles in a bottle of wine;
    I'll drownd them away in a full-flowing bumper
    And ride through the wild to pass away time.
    And when Death calls for me I'll follow him home.
</p><p>    "No wife, no children will be left to suffer,
    Not even a sweetheart will be left to mourn.
    I'll be honest and fair in all my transactions,
    Whatever I do, I intend to be true.
</p><p>    "Here is health and good wishes to all you fair ladies—
    It is hard, boys, to find one that will always be true."
</p><p>A hush fell upon the jail as the singer wailed forth his sad lament,
and when the song was ended a murmur ran along the hall. Pecos
listened, half in a doze, to the muttered comments; then with a jerk he
sat up and stared. The man in the next cell had said,
</p><p>"That's old Babe, singin' his jag-song. He'll be in here pretty soon."
</p><p>Babe! And he would be in there pretty soon! At that magic word a new
life swept through Pecos Dalhart's veins; his drowsiness left him, and
rousing up from his bunk he struggled forth and washed his face at the
tap. Time and again he slapped the cool water upon his neck and hair;
he drank a last draught of its freshness and paced the length of the
corridor, his head bowed as if in thought—but listening above all other
noises for the sound of Angy's voice. Bill Todhunter came and glanced
at him impersonally, as he might gaze at a bronc that was about to be
broke, but Pecos made no appeal. He had started out to wreck Boone
Morgan's jail for him, break up his Kangaroo Court, and establish the
revolution, and with Angy's help he would do it, yet. The jail gang
edged in on him a little closer, dogging his steps as the wolf-pack
follows its kill, but at every turn of his shaggy head they slunk away.
Then at last, just as the clock tolled four, the keys clanked in the
outer door; Hung Wo slipped in with his coffee-pot and can, and after
him came Angevine Thorne, escorted by the deputy.
</p><p>"Hello, Babe!" chimed a chorus from behind the bars. "Hey, Babe—sing
'Kansas'! Oh, Babe!" But Angevine Thorne had no thought for his quondam
prison mates, he was placing himself on record in a protest against the
law.
</p><p>"The Constitution of the United States guarantees to every man a fair
and speedy trial," he declaimed with drunken vehemence, "but look here
and see what a mockery you have made the law! Look at these poor men,
caged up here yet, waiting for their trial! Is that a fair and speedy
hearing? Look at me; arrested for no offence; confined without cause;
condemned without a hearing; imprisoned for no crime! Is that justice?
Justice forsooth! It is conspiracy—treachery—crime! Yes, I say <u>crime</u>!
You are the criminals and we the helpless victims of your hands! I
appeal to God, if there is a God, to bear witness of my innocence!
What? I must go in? Then throw open your prison doors—I die a martyr to
the Cause!"
</p><p>The clanging of the cell doors gave no pause to his impassioned
eloquence, nor yet his sudden injection into jail; but when, as he
swayed upon his heels, his eyes fell upon the haggard features of Pecos
Dalhart, the apostle of civic equality stopped short and struck his
brow with a despairing hand.
</p><p>"What!" he cried. "Are you here, Cumrad? Then let me die forthwith,
for tyranny has done its worst! Pecos Dalhart, immured within prison
walls, torn from the fond embrace of his—but hush, I go too far. Pecos,
old boy, in the years to come your name shall go down to posterity
as a martyr to the Cause. You have been arrested, sir, for no crime
in law or fact, but simply for your outspoken opposition to the foul
conspiracy of capitalism. Oh, that I might stand before the people and
plead your cause—But enough; how are you, Old Hoss?"
</p><p>He gathered Pecos into his arms and embraced him, and to the
astonishment of Hung Wo and the prisoners Pecos hugged him to his
breast.
</p><p>"I'm dam' glad to see you, Angy," he murmured, "and no mistake.
Here—take this strap and keep them fellers off—I'm dyin' for a sleep."
He reached back for the floor, slipped gently down and stretched out
upon the hard concrete. When Angevine Thorne lifted up his head he was
asleep.
</p><p>"Poor old Pecos," said Angy, holding out his hands as Mark Antony did
over Cæsar, "there he lies, a victim to his country's laws. But sleep,
old friend, and the first man that disturbs your dreams will feel the
weight of this!" He held up the alcalde's strap for emphasis, and a low
rumble of disapproval went up from the rows of cells.
</p><p>"He broke every head in jail last night," volunteered the deputy, "an'
it's about time he was kangarooed!"
</p><p>"Not while I live!" declared Angy tragically. "Right or wrong, the
first man that lays hands on this poor corse will fight it out with me!"
</p><p>A chorus of defiance and derision was his only answer, but Angevine
Thorne, being a natural-born orator, knew better than to reiterate
his remarks for emphasis. He balanced the big strap in his hand as
a warrior might test his sword, and squatted down to eat. While the
dinner hour lasted he was safe—after that he would feel his way. So
he put his back to the bars and began to take a little nourishment,
gnashing belligerently at his hunk of meat and fortifying himself
with coffee—but that was not to be the limit of his fare. As he
scuttled back and forth with the prison plates, Hung Wo had kept an
attentive eye upon the prostrate form of his boss and, seeing no
signs of returning animation, had looked worried. At last, as Angy's
protectorate became evident, he returned to his copper can and produced
a fine big pie.
</p><p>"This for boss," he said, and placed it by Pecos's head.
</p><p>"All right, Wo," responded Angy, "my friend, he sleep. Bimeby wakum
up, I give him pie." He finished up his plate, glanced at the surly
faces behind the bars, and cast a longing look at the fresh-baked pie.
There was going to be a ruction, that was sure, and ructions are bad
for pies. He took Pecos by the shoulder and shook him tentatively; then
with a sigh of Christian resignation he reached over and picked up the
pie. "Dam' shame to go and waste it," he muttered, "an' it's all right,
too."
</p><p>The prisoners watched him eat his way through the crust and down
through the middle until finally he licked his finger-tips and smiled.
</p><p>"Him good pie, Wo," he observed, rising to his feet, "make me hip
stlong." He shoved Pecos back into the corner, took his place before
him, and balanced the strap for battle. "All right, deputy," he said,
"turn them tarriers loose, and if I don't tan their hides with this
strap they ain't no hell no mo'!"
</p><p>The cell doors clanged and flew open, the balked cohorts of the enemy
stepped forth and gathered about him, and as Angy paced back and forth
before his friend he opened wide the flood-gates of his wrath.
</p><p>"See the skulkin' curs and cowards," he cried, lashing out at them with
his strap, "see them cringe before the whip like the servile slaves
they are. What has this man done that you should fall upon him? Broke
up your court, hey? Well, what was the court to you? Didn't it punish
you whether you were right or wrong? Didn't it tyrannize over you and
force you to do its will? Ah, despicable dogs, that would lick the hand
that strikes you—come out here, any one of you, and I swear I'll beat
you to death. Hah! You are afraid! You are afraid to face an honest
man and fight him hand to hand! Or is it something else?" The defiant
tone left his voice of a sudden and he looked eagerly into their tense
faces. "Or is it something else?" he cried. "Friends, you have been
shut up here for months by that great crime they call the law. You
know that law—how it protects the rich and crushes down the poor! What
then—do you still worship its outworn forms so that you must suffer
them even in jail? Must you still have a sheriff to harass you, a judge
to condemn you, a district attorney to talk you blind? Must you still
be tyrannized over by a false and illegal court, even in the shadow of
the jail? God forbid! But what then? Ah, yes; what then! Friends, I
bring you the Gospel of Equality; I stand before you to proclaim as our
forebears proclaimed before us, that all men are born free and equal;
I call upon you, even in this prison, to cast aside the superstition
of government and proclaim the revolution! To hell with the Kangaroo
Court! My friend here has beaten up its officers—let us abolish it
forever! What? Is it a go? Then here's to the revolution!"
</p><p>He waved his hand above his head, smiling upward at that fair Goddess
of Liberty whom he discerned among the rods; and the gaping prisoners,
carried away by his eloquence, let out a mighty yell of joy. Worn and
jaded by the dull monotony of their life they seized upon the new
religion with undiscriminating zest, passing up the big words and the
moonshine and rejoicing in their noble freedom from restraint. As the
first symptoms of a jail-riot began to develop Boone Morgan and his
deputies rushed out to quell the disturbance, but the revolution gave
no promise of a rough-house. As was to be expected, the prostrate
form of Pecos Dalhart was draped across the foreground—and served him
right, for trying to get too gay—but the other figures were not in good
support. Angevine Thorne stood above the body of his friend, waving
the alcalde's strap, but the Roman mob was sadly out of part. It was
dancing around the room singing "Kansas."
</p><p>    "I'll tell you what they do—<u>in Kansas</u>,"
</p><p>they howled.
</p><p>    "I'll tell you what they do—<u>in Kansas</u>,"
</p><p>and at the end of each refrain Angy lifted up his vibrant tenor and
added yet another chapter to the shameless tale. It was a bacchanalia
of song, perhaps; or a saturnalia of inter-State revilings; but none
of the onlookers recognized in the progressive dirtiness of the words
a spirit of protest against the law. The revolution had come, but
like many another promising child it was too young to be clearly
differentiated from its twin brothers, License and Liberty.
