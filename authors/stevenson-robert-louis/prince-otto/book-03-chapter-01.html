<p>The porter, drawn by the growing turmoil, had vanished from the postern,
and the door stood open on the darkness of the night.  As Seraphina fled
up the terraces, the cries and loud footing of the mob drew nearer the
doomed palace; the rush was like the rush of cavalry; the sound of
shattering lamps tingled above the rest; and, overtowering all, she heard
her own name bandied among the shouters.  A bugle sounded at the door of
the guard-room; one gun was fired; and then with the yell of hundreds,
Mittwalden Palace was carried at a rush.
</p>
<p>Sped by these dire sounds and voices, the Princess scaled the long
garden, skimming like a bird the starlit stairways; crossed the Park,
which was in that place narrow; and plunged upon the farther side into
the rude shelter of the forest.  So, at a bound, she left the discretion
and the cheerful lamps of Palace evenings; ceased utterly to be a
sovereign lady; and, falling from the whole height of civilisation, ran
forth into the woods, a ragged Cinderella.
</p><p>She went direct before her through an open tract of the forest, full of
brush and birches, and where the starlight guided her; and, beyond that
again, must thread the columned blackness of a pine grove joining
overhead the thatch of its long branches.  At that hour the place was
breathless; a horror of night like a presence occupied that dungeon of
the wood; and she went groping, knocking against the boles—her ear,
betweenwhiles, strained to aching and yet unrewarded.
</p><p>But the slope of the ground was upward, and encouraged her; and presently
she issued on a rocky hill that stood forth above the sea of forest.  All
around were other hill-tops, big and little; sable vales of forest
between; overhead the open heaven and the brilliancy of countless stars;
and along the western sky the dim forms of mountains.  The glory of the
great night laid hold upon her; her eyes shone with stars; she dipped her
sight into the coolness and brightness of the sky, as she might have
dipped her wrist into a spring; and her heart, at that ethereal shock,
began to move more soberly.  The sun that sails overhead, ploughing into
gold the fields of daylight azure and uttering the signal to man’s
myriads, has no word apart for man the individual; and the moon, like a
violin, only praises and laments our private destiny.  The stars alone,
cheerful whisperers, confer quietly with each of us like friends; they
give ear to our sorrows smilingly, like wise old men, rich in tolerance;
and by their double scale, so small to the eye, so vast to the
imagination, they keep before the mind the double character of man’s
nature and fate.
</p><p>There sat the Princess, beautifully looking upon beauty, in council with
these glad advisers.  Bright like pictures, clear like a voice in the
porches of her ear, memory re-enacted the tumult of the evening: the
Countess and the dancing fan, the big Baron on his knees, the blood on
the polished floor, the knocking, the swing of the litter down the avenue
of lamps, the messenger, the cries of the charging mob; and yet all were
far away and phantasmal, and she was still healingly conscious of the
peace and glory of the night.  She looked towards Mittwalden; and above
the hill-top, which already hid it from her view, a throbbing redness
hinted of fire.  Better so: better so, that she should fall with tragic
greatness, lit by a blazing palace!  She felt not a trace of pity for
Gondremark or of concern for Grünewald: that period of her life was
closed for ever, a wrench of wounded vanity alone surviving.  She had but
one clear idea: to flee;—and another, obscure and half-rejected, although
still obeyed: to flee in the direction of the Felsenburg.  She had a duty
to perform, she must free Otto—so her mind said, very coldly; but her
heart embraced the notion of that duty even with ardour, and her hands
began to yearn for the grasp of kindness.
</p><p>She rose, with a start of recollection, and plunged down the slope into
the covert.  The woods received and closed upon her.  Once more, she
wandered and hasted in a blot, uncheered, unpiloted.  Here and there,
indeed, through rents in the wood-roof, a glimmer attracted her; here and
there a tree stood out among its neighbours by some force of outline;
here and there a brushing among the leaves, a notable blackness, a dim
shine, relieved, only to exaggerate, the solid oppression of the night
and silence.  And betweenwhiles, the unfeatured darkness would redouble
and the whole ear of night appear to be gloating on her steps.  Now she
would stand still, and the silence, would grow and grow, till it weighed
upon her breathing; and then she would address herself again to run,
stumbling, falling, and still hurrying the more.  And presently the whole
wood rocked and began to run along with her.  The noise of her own mad
passage through the silence spread and echoed, and filled the night with
terror.  Panic hunted her: Panic from the trees reached forth with
clutching branches; the darkness was lit up and peopled with strange
forms and faces.  She strangled and fled before her fears.  And yet in
the last fortress, reason, blown upon by these gusts of terror, still
shone with a troubled light.  She knew, yet could not act upon her
knowledge; she knew that she must stop, and yet she still ran.
</p><p>She was already near madness, when she broke suddenly into a narrow
clearing.  At the same time the din grew louder, and she became conscious
of vague forms and fields of whiteness.  And with that the earth gave
way; she fell and found her feet again with an incredible shock to her
senses, and her mind was swallowed up.
</p><p>When she came again to herself, she was standing to the mid-leg in an icy
eddy of a brook, and leaning with one hand on the rock from which it
poured.  The spray had wet her hair.  She saw the white cascade, the
stars wavering in the shaken pool, foam flitting, and high overhead the
tall pines on either hand serenely drinking starshine; and in the sudden
quiet of her spirit she heard with joy the firm plunge of the cataract in
the pool.  She scrambled forth dripping.  In the face of her proved
weakness, to adventure again upon the horror of blackness in the groves
were a suicide of life or reason.  But here, in the alley of the brook,
with the kind stars above her, and the moon presently swimming into
sight, she could await the coming of day without alarm.
</p><p>This lane of pine-trees ran very rapidly down-hill and wound among the
woods; but it was a wider thoroughfare than the brook needed, and here
and there were little dimpling lawns and coves of the forest, where the
starshine slumbered.  Such a lawn she paced, taking patience bravely; and
now she looked up the hill and saw the brook coming down to her in a
series of cascades; and now approached the margin, where it welled among
the rushes silently; and now gazed at the great company of heaven with an
enduring wonder.  The early evening had fallen chill, but the night was
now temperate; out of the recesses of the wood there came mild airs as
from a deep and peaceful breathing; and the dew was heavy on the grass
and the tight-shut daisies.  This was the girl’s first night under the
naked heaven; and now that her fears were overpast, she was touched to
the soul by its serene amenity and peace.  Kindly the host of heaven
blinked down upon that wandering Princess; and the honest brook had no
words but to encourage her.
</p><p>At last she began to be aware of a wonderful revolution, compared to
which the fire of Mittwalden Palace was but the crack and flash of a
percussion-cap.  The countenance with which the pines regarded her began
insensibly to change; the grass too, short as it was, and the whole
winding staircase of the brook’s course, began to wear a solemn freshness
of appearance.  And this slow transfiguration reached her heart, and
played upon it, and transpierced it with a serious thrill.  She looked
all about; the whole face of nature looked back, brimful of meaning,
finger on lip, leaking its glad secret.  She looked up.  Heaven was
almost emptied of stars.  Such as still lingered shone with a changed and
waning brightness, and began to faint in their stations.  And the colour
of the sky itself was the most wonderful; for the rich blue of the night
had now melted and softened and brightened; and there had succeeded in
its place a hue that has no name, and that is never seen but as the
herald of morning.  ‘O!’ she cried, joy catching at her voice, ‘O! it is
the dawn!’
</p><p>In a breath she passed over the brook, and looped up her skirts and
fairly ran in the dim alleys.  As she ran, her ears were aware of many
pipings, more beautiful than music; in the small dish-shaped houses in
the fork of giant arms, where they had lain all night, lover by lover,
warmly pressed, the bright-eyed, big-hearted singers began to awaken for
the day.  Her heart melted and flowed forth to them in kindness.  And
they, from their small and high perches in the clerestories of the wood
cathedral, peered down sidelong at the ragged Princess as she flitted
below them on the carpet of the moss and tassel.
</p><p>Soon she had struggled to a certain hill-top, and saw far before her the
silent inflooding of the day.  Out of the East it welled and whitened;
the darkness trembled into light; and the stars were extinguished like
the street-lamps of a human city.  The whiteness brightened into silver,
the silver warmed into gold, the gold kindled into pure and living fire;
and the face of the East was barred with elemental scarlet.  The day drew
its first long breath, steady and chill; and for leagues around the woods
sighed and shivered.  And then, at one bound, the sun had floated up; and
her startled eyes received day’s first arrow, and quailed under the
buffet.  On every side, the shadows leaped from their ambush and fell
prone.  The day was come, plain and garish; and up the steep and solitary
eastern heaven, the sun, victorious over his competitors, continued
slowly and royally to mount.
</p><p>Seraphina drooped for a little, leaning on a pine, the shrill joy of the
woodlands mocking her.  The shelter of the night, the thrilling and
joyous changes of the dawn, were over; and now, in the hot eye of the
day, she turned uneasily and looked sighingly about her.  Some way off
among the lower woods, a pillar of smoke was mounting and melting in the
gold and blue.  There, surely enough, were human folk, the
hearth-surrounders.  Man’s fingers had laid the twigs; it was man’s
breath that had quickened and encouraged the baby flames; and now, as the
fire caught, it would be playing ruddily on the face of its creator.  At
the thought, she felt a-cold and little and lost in that great
out-of-doors.  The electric shock of the young sun-beams and the unhuman
beauty of the woods began to irk and daunt her.  The covert of the house,
the decent privacy of rooms, the swept and regulated fire, all that
denotes or beautifies the home life of man, began to draw her as with
cords.  The pillar of smoke was now risen into some stream of moving air;
it began to lean out sideways in a pennon; and thereupon, as though the
change had been a summons, Seraphina plunged once more into the labyrinth
of the wood.
</p><p>She left day upon the high ground.  In the lower groves there still
lingered the blue early twilight and the seizing freshness of the dew.
But here and there, above this field of shadow, the head of a great
outspread pine was already glorious with day; and here and there, through
the breaches of the hills, the sun-beams made a great and luminous entry.
Here Seraphina hastened along forest paths.  She had lost sight of the
pilot smoke, which blew another way, and conducted herself in that great
wilderness by the direction of the sun.  But presently fresh signs
bespoke the neighbourhood of man; felled trunks, white slivers from the
axe, bundles of green boughs, and stacks of firewood.  These guided her
forward; until she came forth at last upon the clearing whence the smoke
arose.  A hut stood in the clear shadow, hard by a brook which made a
series of inconsiderable falls; and on the threshold the Princess saw a
sun-burnt and hard-featured woodman, standing with his hands behind his
back and gazing skyward.
</p><p>She went to him directly: a beautiful, bright-eyed, and haggard vision;
splendidly arrayed and pitifully tattered; the diamond ear-drops still
glittering in her ears; and with the movement of her coming, one small
breast showing and hiding among the ragged covert of the laces.  At that
ambiguous hour, and coming as she did from the great silence of the
forest, the man drew back from the Princess as from something elfin.
</p><p>‘I am cold,’ she said, ‘and weary.  Let me rest beside your fire.’
</p><p>The woodman was visibly commoved, but answered nothing.
</p><p>‘I will pay,’ she said, and then repented of the words, catching perhaps
a spark of terror from his frightened eyes.  But, as usual, her courage
rekindled brighter for the check.  She put him from the door and entered;
and he followed her in superstitious wonder.
</p><p>Within, the hut was rough and dark; but on the stone that served as
hearth, twigs and a few dry branches burned with the brisk sounds and all
the variable beauty of fire.  The very sight of it composed her; she
crouched hard by on the earth floor and shivered in the glow, and looked
upon the eating blaze with admiration.  The woodman was still staring at
his guest: at the wreck of the rich dress, the bare arms, the bedraggled
laces and the gems.  He found no word to utter.
</p><p>‘Give me food,’ said she,—‘here, by the fire.’
</p><p>He set down a pitcher of coarse wine, bread, a piece of cheese, and a
handful of raw onions.  The bread was hard and sour, the cheese like
leather; even the onion, which ranks with the truffle and the nectarine
in the chief place of honour of earth’s fruits, is not perhaps a dish for
princesses when raw.  But she ate, if not with appetite, with courage;
and when she had eaten, did not disdain the pitcher.  In all her life
before, she had not tasted of gross food nor drunk after another; but a
brave woman far more readily accepts a change of circumstances than the
bravest man.  All that while, the woodman continued to observe her
furtively, many low thoughts of fear and greed contending in his eyes.
She read them clearly, and she knew she must begone.
</p><p>Presently she arose and offered him a florin.
</p><p>‘Will that repay you?’ she asked.
</p><p>But here the man found his tongue.  ‘I must have more than that,’ said
he.
</p><p>‘It is all I have to give you,’ she returned, and passed him by serenely.
</p><p>Yet her heart trembled, for she saw his hand stretched forth as if to
arrest her, and his unsteady eyes wandering to his axe.  A beaten path
led westward from the clearing, and she swiftly followed it.  She did not
glance behind her.  But as soon as the least turning of the path had
concealed her from the woodman’s eyes, she slipped among the trees and
ran till she deemed herself in safety.
</p><p>By this time the strong sunshine pierced in a thousand places the
pine-thatch of the forest, fired the red boles, irradiated the cool
aisles of shadow, and burned in jewels on the grass.  The gum of these
trees was dearer to the senses than the gums of Araby; each pine, in the
lusty morning sunlight, burned its own wood-incense; and now and then a
breeze would rise and toss these rooted censers, and send shade and
sun-gem flitting, swift as swallows, thick as bees; and wake a brushing
bustle of sounds that murmured and went by.
</p><p>On she passed, and up and down, in sun and shadow; now aloft on the bare
ridge among the rocks and birches, with the lizards and the snakes; and
anon in the deep grove among sunless pillars.  Now she followed wandering
wood-paths, in the maze of valleys; and again, from a hill-top, beheld
the distant mountains and the great birds circling under the sky.  She
would see afar off a nestling hamlet, and go round to avoid it.  Below,
she traced the course of the foam of mountain torrents.  Nearer hand, she
saw where the tender springs welled up in silence, or oozed in green
moss; or in the more favoured hollows a whole family of infant rivers
would combine, and tinkle in the stones, and lie in pools to be a
bathing-place for sparrows, or fall from the sheer rock in rods of
crystal.  Upon all these things, as she still sped along in the bright
air, she looked with a rapture of surprise and a joyful fainting of the
heart; they seemed so novel, they touched so strangely home, they were so
hued and scented, they were so beset and canopied by the dome of the blue
air of heaven.
</p><p>At length, when she was well weary, she came upon a wide and shallow
pool.  Stones stood in it, like islands; bulrushes fringed the coast; the
floor was paved with the pine needles; and the pines themselves, whose
roots made promontories, looked down silently on their green images.  She
crept to the margin and beheld herself with wonder, a hollow and
bright-eyed phantom, in the ruins of her palace robe.  The breeze now
shook her image; now it would be marred with flies; and at that she
smiled; and from the fading circles, her counterpart smiled back to her
and looked kind.  She sat long in the warm sun, and pitied her bare arms
that were all bruised and marred with falling, and marvelled to see that
she was dirty, and could not grow to believe that she had gone so long in
such a strange disorder.
</p><p>Then, with a sigh, she addressed herself to make a toilette by that
forest mirror, washed herself pure from all the stains of her adventure,
took off her jewels and wrapped them in her handkerchief, re-arranged the
tatters of her dress, and took down the folds of her hair.  She shook it
round her face, and the pool repeated her thus veiled.  Her hair had
smelt like violets, she remembered Otto saying; and so now she tried to
smell it, and then shook her head, and laughed a little, sadly, to
herself.
</p><p>The laugh was returned upon her in a childish echo.
</p><p>She looked up; and lo! two children looking on,—a small girl and a yet
smaller boy, standing, like playthings, by the pool, below a spreading
pine.  Seraphina was not fond of children, and now she was startled to
the heart.
</p><p>‘Who are you?’ she cried hoarsely.
</p><p>The mites huddled together and drew back; and Seraphina’s heart
reproached her that she should have frightened things so quaint and
little, and yet alive with senses.  She thought upon the birds and looked
again at her two visitors; so little larger and so far more innocent.  On
their clear faces, as in a pool, she saw the reflection of their fears.
With gracious purpose she arose.
</p><p>‘Come,’ she said, ‘do not be afraid of me,’ and took a step towards them.
</p><p>But alas! at the first moment, the two poor babes in the wood turned and
ran helter-skelter from the Princess.
</p><p>The most desolate pang was struck into the girl’s heart.  Here she was,
twenty-two—soon twenty-three—and not a creature loved her; none but Otto;
and would even he forgive?  If she began weeping in these woods alone, it
would mean death or madness.  Hastily she trod the thoughts out like a
burning paper; hastily rolled up her locks, and with terror dogging her,
and her whole bosom sick with grief, resumed her journey.
</p><p>Past ten in the forenoon, she struck a high-road, marching in that place
uphill between two stately groves, a river of sunlight; and here, dead
weary, careless of consequences, and taking some courage from the human
and civilised neighbourhood of the road, she stretched herself on the
green margin in the shadow of a tree.  Sleep closed on her, at first with
a horror of fainting, but when she ceased to struggle, kindly embracing
her.  So she was taken home for a little, from all her toils and sorrows,
to her Father’s arms.  And there in the meanwhile her body lay exposed by
the highwayside, in tattered finery; and on either hand from the woods
the birds came flying by and calling upon others, and debated in their
own tongue this strange appearance.
</p><p>The sun pursued his journey; the shadow flitted from her feet, shrank
higher and higher, and was upon the point of leaving her altogether, when
the rumble of a coach was signalled to and fro by the birds.  The road in
that part was very steep; the rumble drew near with great deliberation;
and ten minutes passed before a gentleman appeared, walking with a sober
elderly gait upon the grassy margin of the highway, and looking
pleasantly around him as he walked.  From time to time he paused, took
out his note-book and made an entry with a pencil; and any spy who had
been near enough would have heard him mumbling words as though he were a
poet testing verses.  The voice of the wheels was still faint, and it was
plain the traveller had far outstripped his carriage.
</p><p>He had drawn very near to where the Princess lay asleep, before his eye
alighted on her; but when it did he started, pocketed his note-book, and
approached.  There was a milestone close to where she lay; and he sat
down on that and coolly studied her.  She lay upon one side, all curled
and sunken, her brow on one bare arm, the other stretched out, limp and
dimpled.  Her young body, like a thing thrown down, had scarce a mark of
life.  Her breathing stirred her not.  The deadliest fatigue was thus
confessed in every language of the sleeping flesh.  The traveller smiled
grimly.  As though he had looked upon a statue, he made a grudging
inventory of her charms: the figure in that touching freedom of
forgetfulness surprised him; the flush of slumber became her like a
flower.
</p><p>‘Upon my word,’ he thought, ‘I did not think the girl could be so pretty.
And to think,’ he added, ‘that I am under obligation not to use one word
of this!’  He put forth his stick and touched her; and at that she awoke,
sat up with a cry, and looked upon him wildly.
</p><p>‘I trust your Highness has slept well,’ he said, nodding.
</p><p>But she only uttered sounds.
</p><p>‘Compose yourself,’ said he, giving her certainly a brave example in his
own demeanour.  ‘My chaise is close at hand; and I shall have, I trust,
the singular entertainment of abducting a sovereign Princess.’
</p><p>‘Sir John!’ she said, at last.
</p><p>‘At your Highness’s disposal,’ he replied.
</p><p>She sprang to her feet.  ‘O!’ she cried, ‘have you come from Mittwalden?’
</p><p>‘This morning,’ he returned, ‘I left it; and if there is any one less
likely to return to it than yourself, behold him!’
</p><p>‘The Baron—’ she began, and paused.
</p><p>‘Madam,’ he answered, ‘it was well meant, and you are quite a Judith; but
after the hours that have elapsed, you will probably be relieved to hear
that he is fairly well.  I took his news this morning ere I left.  Doing
fairly well, they said, but suffering acutely.  Hey?—acutely.  They could
hear his groans in the next room.’
</p><p>‘And the Prince,’ she asked, ‘is anything known of him?’
</p><p>‘It is reported,’ replied Sir John, with the same pleasurable
deliberation, ‘that upon that point your Highness is the best authority.’
</p><p>‘Sir John,’ she said eagerly, ‘you were generous enough to speak about
your carriage.  Will you, I beseech you, will you take me to the
Felsenburg?  I have business there of an extreme importance.’
</p><p>‘I can refuse you nothing,’ replied the old gentleman, gravely and
seriously enough.  ‘Whatever, madam, it is in my power to do for you,
that shall be done with pleasure.  As soon as my chaise shall overtake
us, it is yours to carry you where you will.  But,’ added he, reverting
to his former manner, ‘I observe you ask me nothing of the Palace.’
</p><p>‘I do not care,’ she said.  ‘I thought I saw it burning.’
</p><p>‘Prodigious!’ said the Baronet.  ‘You thought?  And can the loss of forty
toilettes leave you cold?  Well, madam, I admire your fortitude.  And the
state, too?  As I left, the government was sitting,—the new government,
of which at least two members must be known to you by name: Sabra, who
had, I believe, the benefit of being formed in your employment—a footman,
am I right?—and our old friend the Chancellor, in something of a
subaltern position.  But in these convulsions the last shall be first,
and the first last.’
</p><p>‘Sir John,’ she said, with an air of perfect honesty, ‘I am sure you mean
most kindly, but these matters have no interest for me.’
</p><p>The Baronet was so utterly discountenanced that he hailed the appearance
of his chaise with welcome, and, by way of saying something, proposed
that they should walk back to meet it.  So it was done; and he helped her
in with courtesy, mounted to her side, and from various receptacles (for
the chaise was most completely fitted out) produced fruits and truffled
liver, beautiful white bread, and a bottle of delicate wine.  With these
he served her like a father, coaxing and praising her to fresh exertions;
and during all that time, as though silenced by the laws of hospitality,
he was not guilty of the shadow of a sneer.  Indeed his kindness seemed
so genuine that Seraphina was moved to gratitude.
</p><p>‘Sir John,’ she said, ‘you hate me in your heart; why are you so kind to
me?’
</p><p>‘Ah, my good lady,’ said he, with no disclaimer of the accusation, ‘I
have the honour to be much your husband’s friend, and somewhat his
admirer.’
</p><p>‘You!’ she cried.  ‘They told me you wrote cruelly of both of us.’
</p><p>‘Such was the strange path by which we grew acquainted,’ said Sir John.
‘I had written, madam, with particular cruelty (since that shall be the
phrase) of your fair self.  Your husband set me at liberty, gave me a
passport, ordered a carriage, and then, with the most boyish spirit,
challenged me to fight.  Knowing the nature of his married life, I
thought the dash and loyalty he showed delightful.  “Do not be afraid,”
says he; “if I am killed, there is nobody to miss me.”  It appears you
subsequently thought of that yourself.  But I digress.  I explained to
him it was impossible that I could fight!  “Not if I strike you?” says
he.  Very droll; I wish I could have put it in my book.  However, I was
conquered, took the young gentleman to my high favour, and tore up my
bits of scandal on the spot.  That is one of the little favours, madam,
that you owe your husband.’
</p><p>Seraphina sat for some while in silence.  She could bear to be misjudged
without a pang by those whom she contemned; she had none of Otto’s
eagerness to be approved, but went her own way straight and head in air.
To Sir John, however, after what he had said, and as her husband’s
friend, she was prepared to stoop.
</p><p>‘What do you think of me?’ she asked abruptly.
</p><p>‘I have told you already,’ said Sir John: ‘I think you want another glass
of my good wine.’
</p><p>‘Come,’ she said, ‘this is unlike you.  You are not wont to be afraid.
You say that you admire my husband: in his name, be honest.’
</p><p>‘I admire your courage,’ said the Baronet.  ‘Beyond that, as you have
guessed, and indeed said, our natures are not sympathetic.’
</p><p>‘You spoke of scandal,’ pursued Seraphina.  ‘Was the scandal great?’
</p><p>‘It was considerable,’ said Sir John.
</p><p>‘And you believed it?’ she demanded.
</p><p>‘O, madam,’ said Sir John, ‘the question!’
</p><p>‘Thank you for that answer!’ cried Seraphina.  ‘And now here, I will tell
you, upon my honour, upon my soul, in spite of all the scandal in this
world, I am as true a wife as ever stood.’
</p><p>‘We should probably not agree upon a definition,’ observed Sir John.
</p><p>‘O!’ she cried, ‘I have abominably used him—I know that; it is not that I
mean.  But if you admire my husband, I insist that you shall understand
me: I can look him in the face without a blush.’
</p><p>‘It may be, madam,’ said Sir John; ‘nor have I presumed to think the
contrary.’
</p><p>‘You will not believe me?’ she cried.  ‘You think I am a guilty wife?
You think he was my lover?’
</p><p>‘Madam,’ returned the Baronet, ‘when I tore up my papers, I promised your
good husband to concern myself no more with your affairs; and I assure
you for the last time that I have no desire to judge you.’
</p><p>‘But you will not acquit me!  Ah!’ she cried, ‘<u>he</u> will—he knows me
better!’
</p><p>Sir John smiled.
</p><p>‘You smile at my distress?’ asked Seraphina.
</p><p>‘At your woman’s coolness,’ said Sir John.  ‘A man would scarce have had
the courage of that cry, which was, for all that, very natural, and I
make no doubt quite true.  But remark, madam—since you do me the honour
to consult me gravely—I have no pity for what you call your distresses.
You have been completely selfish, and now reap the consequence.  Had you
once thought of your husband, instead of singly thinking of yourself, you
would not now have been alone, a fugitive, with blood upon your hands,
and hearing from a morose old Englishman truth more bitter than scandal.’
</p><p>‘I thank you,’ she said, quivering.  ‘This is very true.  Will you stop
the carriage?’
</p><p>‘No, child,’ said Sir John, ‘not until I see you mistress of yourself.’
</p><p>There was a long pause, during which the carriage rolled by rock and
woodland.
</p><p>‘And now,’ she resumed, with perfect steadiness, ‘will you consider me
composed?  I request you, as a gentleman, to let me out.’
</p><p>‘I think you do unwisely,’ he replied.  ‘Continue, if you please, to use
my carriage.’
</p><p>‘Sir John,’ she said, ‘if death were sitting on that pile of stones, I
would alight!  I do not blame, I thank you; I now know how I appear to
others; but sooner than draw breath beside a man who can so think of me,
I would—O!’ she cried, and was silent.
</p><p>Sir John pulled the string, alighted, and offered her his hand; but she
refused the help.
</p><p>The road had now issued from the valleys in which it had been winding,
and come to that part of its course where it runs, like a cornice, along
the brow of the steep northward face of Grünewald.  The place where they
had alighted was at a salient angle; a bold rock and some wind-tortured
pine-trees overhung it from above; far below the blue plains lay forth
and melted into heaven; and before them the road, by a succession of bold
zigzags, was seen mounting to where a tower upon a tall cliff closed the
view.
</p><p>‘There,’ said the Baronet, pointing to the tower, ‘you see the
Felsenburg, your goal.  I wish you a good journey, and regret I cannot be
of more assistance.’
</p><p>He mounted to his place and gave a signal, and the carriage rolled away.
</p><p>Seraphina stood by the wayside, gazing before her with blind eyes.  Sir
John she had dismissed already from her mind: she hated him, that was
enough; for whatever Seraphina hated or contemned fell instantly to
Lilliputian smallness, and was thenceforward steadily ignored in thought.
And now she had matter for concern indeed.  Her interview with Otto,
which she had never yet forgiven him, began to appear before her in a
very different light.  He had come to her, still thrilling under recent
insult, and not yet breathed from fighting her own cause; and how that
knowledge changed the value of his words!  Yes, he must have loved her!
this was a brave feeling—it was no mere weakness of the will.  And she,
was she incapable of love?  It would appear so; and she swallowed her
tears, and yearned to see Otto, to explain all, to ask pity upon her
knees for her transgressions, and, if all else were now beyond the reach
of reparation, to restore at least the liberty of which she had deprived
him.
</p><p>Swiftly she sped along the highway, and, as the road wound out and in
about the bluffs and gullies of the mountain, saw and lost by glimpses
the tall tower that stood before and above her, purpled by the mountain
air.
