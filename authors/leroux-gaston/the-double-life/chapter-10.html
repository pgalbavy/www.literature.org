<p><em>THE </em>following day Théophraste and Marceline returned
to the quiet life of the Villa Flots-d’Azure. Théophraste had
not mentioned a word of the discovery, and his wife refrained
from questioning him. Marceline knew nothing yet of the terrible
discovery. Théophraste’s face was full of consternation, and it
was evident to Marceline that he had terrible things on his mind.</p>

<p>Adolphe was to join them in a few days; two days passed very
quietly in the villa. Marceline attended to her household duties,
and Théophraste silently prepared his fishing tackle, as he had
promised Adolphe a few days’ fishing in the Marne. On the third
day, Théophraste, who had passed a good night, showed a less agitated
countenance, and began to smile and was cheered at the prospect
of Adolphe’s coming. M. Lecamus arrived before noon, and they
both received him with delight.</p>

<p>Taking their places at lunch their conversation turned on angling,
but nothing was said of the mysterious proceedings of the week
before. After lunch they prepared for their fishing expedition;
Théophraste took care of the lines, the rods and the bait, and
Adolphe took the nets.</p>

<p>Going down to the water’s edge, Théophraste turned to Adolphe
and said, "Tell me, have you any news? While we are fishing I
will listen to you. I have prepared a lot of sport, but I don’t
think we will do very much to-day, if you have important news
for me."</p>

<p>Adolphe replied, "There is some good, and some bad news. But
I must tell you that there is more bad than good. No doubt many
stories have been invented about you, but the real truth is not
entirely pleasant."</p>

<p>"Are you well informed, and is your information authentic?"</p>

<p>"I have been to the very fountain-head, I have seen the authentic
documents. I am going to tell you what I know. If I am mistaken,
correct me."</p>

<p>Théophraste threw his half-prepared bait into the water, and
said, "Go on. I must have a full explanation."</p>

<p>"First," said Adolphe, "you were born in the month of October,
1693. You were called Louis Dominique Cartouche."</p>

<p>"But it is needless to call me Cartouche, no one need know that.
Call me L’Enfant. I like it much better and no one will understand."</p>

<p>"Yes," insisted Adolphe, "but you know that your name is Cartouche.
It is not an assumed name. It is said that you studied hard in
Clermont College. That you were the schoolfellow of Voltaire,
and there is a legend that while you learned to read, in the course
of time, thanks to the gypsies who taught you reading, you were
never able to write."</p>

<p>"Well, that’s funny," cried Théophraste, "for if I never learned
to write, how could I have drawn up the document in the dungeon
of the Conciergerie?"</p>

<p>"At the time of your trial, you declared that you did not know
how to write. You signed your depositions with a cross and you
have never written a line to show who it was."</p>

<p>"But," Théophraste said, "it was never necessary to write. In
my position I should have dreaded to compromise myself. But the
document is there."</p>

<p>"Evidently. Let us return to your eleventh year. One day you
were in the Saint Laurent Faire, with some comrades, when you
fell in with a band of gypsies. The gypsies carried you away.
They stole you. They taught you the play of the cudgel, the sword,
to shoot a pistol, to jump, and to rob the pockets of the bourgeoisie
without being discovered. At your twelfth year you were an adept
at this, and without an equal for bringing back handkerchiefs,
snuff boxes, and watches. The band of gypsies found themselves
at Rouen, when little Louis Dominique fell ill. He was taken to
a hospital in Rouen, and it was there that an uncle discovered
him. He recognized him, and swore to restore him to his parents."</p>

<p>Here Théophraste interrupted with a word as to his uncle, and
Lecamus becoming impatient, begged him to cease his continual
interruptions, declaring it would take some time to tell the story
of Cartouche if he would not listen to it silently.</p>

<p>"I would like to see you in my place," said Théophraste.</p>

<p>Adolphe continued: "In a while Cartouche became the chief of
a band of brigands. He commanded about three thousand men, had
more than fifty lieutenants; it was their habit to dress exactly
alike, in cinnamon-colored coats, and doublets of silk and amaranthine,
showing a piece of black taffeta underneath the left eye. They
brought against him more than one hundred and fifty personal assassinations,
and put a price upon his head. He was tried and broken on the
wheel." "Upon hearing this Théophraste showed evident signs of
alarm. He dropped his fishing tackle, losing it in the swift current
of the river. He could not give his mind to fishing any more that
day, and so they resolved to give up the attempt. They did not
wait for sundown, to return to the Villa Flots-d’Azure. Swinging
their meagre spoils lightly in their nets they sadly retraced
their steps. Cartouche filled their minds, and their return journey
was occupied in thoughts of this dual personality.</p>
