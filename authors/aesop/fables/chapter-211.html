THE PEACOCK made complaint to Juno that, while the nightingale
pleased every ear with his song, he himself no sooner opened his
mouth than he became a laughingstock to all who heard him.  The
Goddess, to console him, said, "But you far excel in beauty and
in size.  The splendor of the emerald shines in your neck and you
unfold a tail gorgeous with painted plumage."  "But for what
purpose have I," said the bird, "this dumb beauty so long as I am
surpassed in song?'   "The lot of each," replied Juno, "has been
assigned by the will of the Fates--to thee, beauty; to the eagle, 
strength; to the nightingale, song; to the raven, favorable, 
and to the crow, unfavorable auguries.  These are all contented 
with the endowments allotted to them."
