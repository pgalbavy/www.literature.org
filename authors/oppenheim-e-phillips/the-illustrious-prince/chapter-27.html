<P>
Dr. Spencer Whiles was sitting in a very comfortable easy chair,
smoking a particularly good cigar, with a pile of newspapers by
his side. His appearance certainly showed no signs of hardship.
His linen, and the details of his toilet generally, supplied from
some mysterious source into which he had not inquired, were much
improved. Notwithstanding his increased comfort, however, he was
looking perplexed, even a little worried, and the cause of it was
there in front of him, in the advertisement sheets of the various
newspapers which had been duly laid upon his table.
<P>
The Prince came in quietly and closed the door behind him.
<P>
"Good afternoon, my friend!" he said. "I understood that you
wished to see me."
<P>
The doctor had made up his mind to adopt a firm attitude.
Nevertheless the genial courtesy of the Prince's tone and manner
had the same effect upon him as it had upon most people. He half
rose to his feet and became at once apologetic.
<P>
"I hope that I have not disturbed you, Prince," he said. "I
thought that I should like to have a word or two with you
concerning something which I have come across in these journals."
<P>
<P>
He tapped them with his forefinger, and the Prince nodded
thoughtfully.
<P>
"Your wonderful Press!" he exclaimed. "How much it is responsible
for! Well, Dr. Whiles, what have the newspapers to say to you?"
<P>
The doctor handed across a carefully folded journal and pointed
to a certain paragraph.
<P>
"Will you kindly read this?" he begged.
<P>
The Prince accepted the sheet and read the paragraph aloud:
<P>
"FIFTY POUNDS REWARD! Disappeared from his home in Long Whatton
on Wednesday morning last, Herbert Spencer Whiles, Surgeon. The
above reward will be paid to any one giving information which
will lead to the discovery of his present whereabouts. Was last
seen in a motor car, Limousine body, painted dark green, leaving
Long Whatton in the direction of London."
<P>
The Prince laid down the paper, smiling.
<P>
"Well?" he asked. "That seems clear enough.  Some one is willing
to give fifty pounds to know where you are."
<P>
The doctor tapped the advertisement with his forefinger
impressively.
<P>
"Fifty pounds!" he repeated. "There isn't a person in the world
to whom the knowledge of my movements is worth fifty
pounds--except--"
<P>
"Except?" the Prince murmured.
<P>
"Except Mr. Inspector Jacks," Dr. Whiles said slowly.
<P>
The Prince seemed scarcely to grasp the situation.
<P>
"Well," he said, "fifty pounds is not a great deal of money. Some
unknown person--possibly, as you suggest, Mr. Jacks--is willing
to give fifty pounds to discover your whereabouts. I, on the
other hand, am giving a thousand guineas to keep you here as my
guest. The odds do not seem even, do they?"
<P>
"Put in that way," Dr. Whiles admitted, "they certainly do not.
But there is another thing which has come into my mind."
<P>
The Prince smiled and helped himself to one of the very excellent
cigarettes which had been provided for the delectation of his
visitor.
<P>
"Pray treat me with every confidence, Dr. Whiles," he said. "Tell
me exactly what is in your thoughts."
<P>
"Well, then, I will," the doctor answered. "Sitting here with
nothing particular to do, one has plenty of leisure to think. For
the first time, I have seriously tried to puzzle out what Mr.
Inspector Jacks really wanted with me, why he came down to ask me
about the person whom I treated for injuries resulting from a
bicycle accident one Wednesday evening not long ago, why he took
me up to London to see if I could identify that person in a very
different guise. I have tried to put the pieces together and to
ask myself what he meant by it all."
<P>
"With so much time upon your hands, Dr. Whiles," the Prince
remarked, "you can scarcely fail to have arrived at some
reasonable explanation."
<P>
"I don't know whether it is reasonable or not," the doctor
answered, "but the obvious explanation is getting on my nerves.
There are two things which I cannot get away from. One is that I
cannot for the life of me imagine your riding a bicycle twelve or
fifteen miles north of London between eleven o'clock and
midnight; and the other--"
<P>
"Come, the other?" the Prince remarked encouragingly.
<P>
"The other," the doctor continued, "is the fact that within half
a mile of my house runs the main London and North Western line."
<P>
"The London and North Western Railway line," the Prince repeated,
"and what has that to do with it?"
<P>
"This much," the doctor answered, "that on that very night, about
half an hour before your--shall we call it bicycle accident?--the
special train from Liverpool to London passed along that line.
You will remember the tragic occurrence which took place before
she reached London, the murder of the man Hamilton Fynes. If you
read the report of the evidence at the inquest, you will notice
the engine driver's declaration that the only time on the whole
journey when he travelled at less than forty miles an hour was
when passing over the viaduct and before entering the tunnel
which is plainly visible from my house."
<P>
"This is very interesting," the Prince remarked, "but it is not
new. We have known all this before. Perhaps, though, some fresh
thing has come into your mind connected with these happenings. If
so, please do not hesitate. Let me hear it."
<P>
"It is a fresh thing to me," the doctor said,--"fresh, in a
sense, though all the time I have had an uneasy feeling at the
back of my head. I know now what it was which brought Inspector
Jacks to see me. I know now what it was he had at the back of his
head concerning the man who met with a bicycle accident at this
psychological moment."
<P>
"Inspector Jacks is a very shrewd fellow," the Prince said. "I
should not be in the least surprised if you were entirely right."
<P>
The doctor moved restlessly in his chair. His eyes remained on
his companion's face, as though fascinated.
<P>
"Can't you understand," he said, "that Inspector Jacks is on your
track? Rightly or wrongly, he believes that you had something to
do with the murder on the train that night."
<P>
The Prince nodded amiably. He seemed in no way discomposed.
<P>
"I feel convinced," he said, "that you are right. I agree with
you. I believe that Inspector Jacks has had that idea for some
little time now."
<P>
The doctor gripped the sides of his chair and stared at this man
who discussed a matter so terrible with calm and perfect ease.
<P>
"Yes, I have felt that more than once," the Prince continued. "My
presence upon the spot at that precise moment with injuries which
had to be explained somehow or other, was, without doubt,
unfortunate."
<P>
The two men sat for several moments without further speech. The
doctor's features seemed to reflect something of the horror which
he undoubtedly felt. The Prince appeared only a trifle bored.
<P>
"So that is why," the former exclaimed hoarsely, "I have been
appointed your physician in chief!"
<P>
"I had given you the credit, my dear doctor," the Prince said
smoothly, "of having arrived at that decision some time ago. To a
man of your perceptions there can scarcely have been any question
about it at all. Besides, even Princes, you know, do not give
fees of a thousand guineas for nothing."
<P>
Dr. Whiles rose slowly to his feet.
<P>
"You know the secret of that murder!" he declared.
<P>
"Why ask me?" the Prince answered. "If I tell you that I do, you
may find conscientious scruples about remaining here. A man is
not bound, you know, to give himself away. Make the best of
things, and do not try to see too far."
<P>
The doctor was looking a little shaken.
<P>
"If you were mixed up in that affair," he said, "and if I remain
here when my evidence is needed, I become an accomplice."
<P>
"Only if you remain here voluntarily," the Prince reminded him
cheerfully. "Remember that and be comforted. No effort that you
could make now would bring you into touch with Mr. Inspector
Jacks until I am quite prepared. So you see, my dear doctor, that
you have nothing with which to reproach yourself. I will not
insult you," he continued, "by suggesting that a reward of fifty
pounds could possibly have influenced your attitude. If you have
suffered your mind to dwell upon it for a single moment, try and
remember the relative unimportance of such an amount when
compared with a thousand guineas."
<P>
The doctor moved to the window and back again.
<P>
"Supposing," he said, "I decline to remain here? Supposing I say
that, believing you now to have a guilty knowledge of this
murder, I repudiate our bargain? Supposing I say that I will have
nothing more to do with your thousand guineas,--that I will leave
this house?"
<P>
"Then we come to close quarters," the Prince answered, "and you
force me to tell you in plain words that, until I am ready for
you to leave it, you are as much a prisoner in this room as
though the keys of the strongest fortress in Europe were turned
upon you. I have told you this before. I thought that we
perfectly understood one another."
<P>
"I did not understand," the doctor protested. "I knew that there
was trouble, but I did not know that it was this!"
<P>
"The fact of your knowing or not knowing makes no difference,"
the Prince answered. "You are no longer a free agent. The only
question for you to decide is whether you remain here willingly
or whether you will force me to remind you of our bargain."
<P>
The doctor was sitting down again now. All the time he watched
the Prince with a gleam in his eyes, partly of horror, partly of
fear. He no longer doubted but that he was in the presence of a
criminal.
<P>
"I am sorry," the Prince continued, "that you have allowed this
little matter to disturb you. I thought that we had arranged it
all at our last interview. If you did not surmise my reasons for
keeping you here, then I am afraid I gave you credit for more
intelligence than you possess. You will excuse me now, I am
sure," he added, rising. "I have some letters to send off before
I change. By the bye, do you care to give me your parole? It
might, perhaps, lessen the inconvenience to which you are
unfortunately subject."
<P>
The doctor shook his head.
<P>
"No," he said, "I will not give my parole!"
<P>
Late that night, he tried the handle of his door and found it
open. The corridor outside was in thick darkness. He felt his way
along by the wall. Suddenly, from behind, a pair of large soft
hands gripped him by the throat. Slowly he was drawn back--almost
strangled.
<P>
"Let me go!" he called out, struggling in vain to find a body
upon which he could gain a grip.
<P>
The grasp only tightened.
<P>
"Back to your rooms!" came a whisper through the darkness.
<P>
The doctor returned. When he staggered into his sitting room, he
turned up the electric light. There were red marks upon his
throat and perspiration upon his forehead. He opened the door
once more and looked out upon the landing, striking a match and
holding it over his head. There was no one in sight, yet all the
time he had the uncomfortable feeling that he was being watched.
For the first time in his life he wondered whether a thousand
guineas was, after all, such a magnificent fee!
<P>
Almost at the same time the Prince sat back in the shadows of the
Duchess of Devenham's box at the Opera and talked quietly to Lady
Grace.
<P>
"But tell me, Prince," she begged, "I know that you are glad to
go home, but won't you really miss this a little,--the music, the
life, all these things that make up existence here? Your own
country is wonderful, I know, but it has not progressed so far,
has it?"
<P>
He shook his head.
<P>
"I think," he said, "that the portion of our education which we
have most grievously neglected is the development of our
recreations. But then you must remember that we are to a certain
extent without that craving for amusement which makes these
things necessary for you others. We are perhaps too serious in my
country, Lady Grace. We lack altogether that delightful air of
irresponsibility with which you Londoners seem to make your
effortless way through life."
<P>
She was a little perplexed.
<P>
"I don't believe," she said, "that in your heart you approve of
us at all."
<P>
"Do not say that, Lady Grace," he begged. "It is simply that I
have been brought up in so different a school. This sort of thing
is very wonderful, and I shall surely miss it. Yet nowadays the
world is being linked together in marvellous fashion. Tokio and
London are closer today than ever they have been in the world's
history."
<P>
"And our people?" she asked. "Do you really think that our people
are so far apart? Between you and me, for instance," she added,
meaning to ask the question naturally enough, but suddenly losing
confidence and looking away from him,--"between you and me there
seems no radical difference of race. You might almost be an
Englishman--not one of these men of fashion, of course, but a
statesman or a man of letters, some one who had taken hold of the
serious side of life."
<P>
"You pay me a very delightful compliment," he murmured.
<P>
"Please repay me, then, by being candid," she answered. "Consider
for a moment that I am a typical English girl, and tell me
whether I am so very different from the Japanese women of your
own class?"
<P>
He hesitated for a moment. The question was not without its
embarrassments.
<P>
"Men," he said, "are very much the same, all the world over. They
are like the coarse grass which grows everywhere. But the
flowers, you know, are different in every country."
<P>
Lady Grace sighed. Perhaps she had been a trifle too daring! She
was willing enough, at any rate, to let the subject drift away.
<P>
"Soon the curtain will go up," she said, "and we can talk no
longer. I should like to tell you, though, how glad I am--how
glad we all are--that you can come to us next week."
<P>
"I can assure you that I am looking forward to it," he answered a
little gravely. "It is my farewell to all of you, you know, and
it seems to me that those who will be your father's guests are
just those with whom I have been on the most intimate terms since
I came to England.
<P>
She nodded.
<P>
"Penelope is coming," she said quickly,--"you know
that?--Penelope and Sir Charles Somerfield."
<P>
"Yes," he answered, "I heard so."
<P>
The curtain went up. The faint murmur of the violins was suddenly
caught up and absorbed in the thunderous music of a march. Lady
Grace moved nearer to the front. Prince Maiyo remained where he
was among the shadows. The music was in his ears, but his eyes
were half closed.
