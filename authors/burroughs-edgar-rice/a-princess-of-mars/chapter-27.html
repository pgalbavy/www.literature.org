For ten days the hordes of Thark and their wild allies were
feasted and entertained, and, then, loaded with costly
presents and escorted by ten thousand soldiers of Helium
commanded by Mors Kajak, they started on the return journey
to their own lands.  The jed of lesser Helium with a small
party of nobles accompanied them all the way to Thark to
cement more closely the new bonds of peace and friendship.
<P>
Sola also accompanied Tars Tarkas, her father, who before
all his chieftains had acknowledged her as his daughter.
<P>
Three weeks later, Mors Kajak and his officers, accompanied
by Tars Tarkas and Sola, returned upon a battleship that
had been dispatched to Thark to fetch them in time for
the ceremony which made Dejah Thoris and John Carter one.
<P>
For nine years I served in the councils and fought in the
armies of Helium as a prince of the house of Tardos Mors.
The people seemed never to tire of heaping honors upon me,
and no day passed that did not bring some new proof of
their love for my princess, the incomparable Dejah Thoris.
<P>
In a golden incubator upon the roof of our palace lay a
snow-white egg.  For nearly five years ten soldiers of the
jeddak's Guard had constantly stood over it, and not a day
passed when I was in the city that Dejah Thoris and I did
not stand hand in hand before our little shrine planning for
the future, when the delicate shell should break.
<P>
Vivid in my memory is the picture of the last night as we
sat there talking in low tones of the strange romance which
had woven our lives together and of this wonder which was
coming to augment our happiness and fulfill our hopes.
<P>
In the distance we saw the bright-white light of an
approaching airship, but we attached no special
significance to so common a sight.  Like a bolt of
lightning it raced toward Helium until its very speed
bespoke the unusual.
<P>
Flashing the signals which proclaimed it a dispatch bearer
for the jeddak, it circled impatiently awaiting the tardy
patrol boat which must convoy it to the palace docks.
<P>
Ten minutes after it touched at the palace a message
called me to the council chamber, which I found filling with
the members of that body.
<P>
On the raised platform of the throne was Tardos Mors,
pacing back and forth with tense-drawn face.  When all were
in their seats he turned toward us.
<P>
"This morning," he said, "word reached the several
governments of Barsoom that the keeper of the atmosphere
plant had made no wireless report for two days, nor had
almost ceaseless calls upon him from a score of capitals
elicited a sign of response.
<P>
"The ambassadors of the other nations asked us to take
the matter in hand and hasten the assistant keeper to the
plant.  All day a thousand cruisers have been searching for
him until just now one of them returns bearing his dead
body, which was found in the pits beneath his house horribly
mutilated by some assassin.
<P>
"I do not need to tell you what this means to Barsoom.  It
would take months to penetrate those mighty walls, in fact
the work has already commenced, and there would be little
to fear were the engine of the pumping plant to run as it
should and as they all have for hundreds of years now; but the
worst, we fear, has happened.  The instruments show a rapidly
decreasing air pressure on all parts of Barsoom--the engine has stopped."
<P>
"My gentlemen," he concluded, "we have at best three days to live."
<P>
There was absolute silence for several minutes, and then
a young noble arose, and with his drawn sword held high
above his head addressed Tardos Mors.
<P>
"The men of Helium have prided themselves that they have
ever shown Barsoom how a nation of red men should live,
now is our opportunity to show them how they should die.
Let us go about our duties as though a thousand useful years
still lay before us."
<P>
The chamber rang with applause and as there was nothing
better to do than to allay the fears of the people by our
example we went our ways with smiles upon our faces and
sorrow gnawing at our hearts.
<P>
When I returned to my palace I found that the rumor already
had reached Dejah Thoris, so I told her all that I had heard.
<P>
"We have been very happy, John Carter," she said, "and I thank
whatever fate overtakes us that it permits us to die together."
<P>
The next two days brought no noticeable change in the
supply of air, but on the morning of the third day breathing
became difficult at the higher altitudes of the rooftops.
The avenues and plazas of Helium were filled with people.
All business had ceased.  For the most part the people looked
bravely into the face of their unalterable doom.  Here and
there, however, men and women gave way to quiet grief.
<P>
Toward the middle of the day many of the weaker commenced
to succumb and within an hour the people of Barsoom
were sinking by thousands into the unconsciousness
which precedes death by asphyxiation.
<P>
Dejah Thoris and I with the other members of the royal
family had collected in a sunken garden within an inner
courtyard of the palace.  We conversed in low tones, when
we conversed at all, as the awe of the grim shadow of death
crept over us.  Even Woola seemed to feel the weight of the
impending calamity, for he pressed close to Dejah Thoris
and to me, whining pitifully.
<P>
The little incubator had been brought from the roof of
our palace at request of Dejah Thoris and now she sat gazing
longingly upon the unknown little life that now she would
never know.
<P>
As it was becoming perceptibly difficult to breathe Tardos
Mors arose, saying,
<P>
"Let us bid each other farewell.  The days of the greatness
of Barsoom are over.  Tomorrow's sun will look down upon a
dead world which through all eternity must go swinging through
the heavens peopled not even by memories.  It is the end."
<P>
He stooped and kissed the women of his family, and laid
his strong hand upon the shoulders of the men.
<P>
As I turned sadly from him my eyes fell upon Dejah
Thoris.  Her head was drooping upon her breast, to all
appearances she was lifeless.  With a cry I sprang to her
and raised her in my arms.
<P>
Her eyes opened and looked into mine.
<P>
"Kiss me, John Carter," she murmured.  "I love you!
I love you!  It is cruel that we must be torn apart who
were just starting upon a life of love and happiness."
<P>
As I pressed her dear lips to mine the old feeling of
unconquerable power and authority rose in me.  The fighting
blood of Virginia sprang to life in my veins.
<P>
"It shall not be, my princess," I cried.  "There is, there
must be some way, and John Carter, who has fought his way
through a strange world for love of you, will find it."
<P>
And with my words there crept above the threshold of my
conscious mind a series of nine long forgotten sounds.  Like a
flash of lightning in the darkness their full purport dawned
upon me--the key to the three great doors of the atmosphere plant!
<P>
Turning suddenly toward Tardos Mors as I still clasped my
dying love to my breast I cried.
<P>
"A flier, Jeddak!  Quick!  Order your swiftest flier to the
palace top.  I can save Barsoom yet."
<P>
He did not wait to question, but in an instant a guard was racing
to the nearest dock and though the air was thin and almost gone
at the rooftop they managed to launch the fastest one-man,
air-scout machine that the skill of Barsoom had ever produced.
<P>
Kissing Dejah Thoris a dozen times and commanding Woola,
who would have followed me, to remain and guard her,
I bounded with my old agility and strength to the high
ramparts of the palace, and in another moment I was headed
toward the goal of the hopes of all Barsoom.
<P>
I had to fly low to get sufficient air to breathe, but I took
a straight course across an old sea bottom and so had to rise
only a few feet above the ground.
<P>
I traveled with awful velocity for my errand was a race
against time with death.  The face of Dejah Thoris hung
always before me.  As I turned for a last look as I left
the palace garden I had seen her stagger and sink upon the
ground beside the little incubator.  That she had dropped
into the last coma which would end in death, if the air
supply remained unreplenished, I well knew, and so, throwing
caution to the winds, I flung overboard everything but the
engine and compass, even to my ornaments, and lying on my
belly along the deck with one hand on the steering wheel
and the other pushing the speed lever to its last notch I
split the thin air of dying Mars with the speed of a meteor.
<P>
An hour before dark the great walls of the atmosphere
plant loomed suddenly before me, and with a sickening thud
I plunged to the ground before the small door which was
withholding the spark of life from the inhabitants of an
entire planet.
<P>
Beside the door a great crew of men had been laboring
to pierce the wall, but they had scarcely scratched the flint-
like surface, and now most of them lay in the last sleep from
which not even air would awaken them.
<P>
Conditions seemed much worse here than at Helium, and
it was with difficulty that I breathed at all.  There were
a few men still conscious, and to one of these I spoke.
<P>
"If I can open these doors is there a man who can start
the engines?" I asked.
<P>
"I can," he replied, "if you open quickly.  I can last but a
few moments more.  But it is useless, they are both dead
and no one else upon Barsoom knew the secret of these awful
locks.  For three days men crazed with fear have surged
about this portal in vain attempts to solve its mystery."
<P>
I had no time to talk, I was becoming very weak and it
was with difficulty that I controlled my mind at all.
<P>
But, with a final effort, as I sank weakly to my knees I
hurled the nine thought waves at that awful thing before me.
The Martian had crawled to my side and with staring eyes
fixed on the single panel before us we waited in the silence
of death.
<P>
Slowly the mighty door receded before us.  I attempted to
rise and follow it but I was too weak.
<P>
"After it," I cried to my companion, "and if you reach the
pump room turn loose all the pumps.  It is the only chance
Barsoom has to exist tomorrow!"
<P>
From where I lay I opened the second door, and then the
third, and as I saw the hope of Barsoom crawling weakly on
hands and knees through the last doorway I sank unconscious
upon the ground.
