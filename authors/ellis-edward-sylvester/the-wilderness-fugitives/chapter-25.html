<p>Twenty minutes or more was consumed by Worrell, in conducting
the fugitives to the hiding-place, where he promised they should
be secure from all molestation from their enemies. In making this
journey they walked slowly, often pausing to examine the ground
passed over, and to listen for those unfavorable signals which
the straggling settler was sure he heard from the Iroquois. Thus
it was that, in spite of the time consumed in making the expedition,
they were really at no great distance from the starting point,
and both Ned and Jo were confident that they could retrace their
steps without difficulty.</p>

<p>"Here we are!"</p>

<p>As the guide uttered these words, he paused before a mass of
boulders, or large stones, where there was an abundance of undergrowth,
and the trees were so numerous that the view in all directions
was almost cut off.</p>

<p>"I see we are here," responded Ned. "But what for?"</p>

<p>"Here is the hiding-place I told you about."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>All three were looking inquiringly around, but their eyes saw
nothing that could explain why the man called this a place of
concealment.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that we are to crouch behind some of these stones,
just as you did behind the rock, when you found I was looking
at you?" asked Ned Clinton, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Not exactly. Wait and I'll show you."</p>

<p>He walked forward a few steps further and turned to the right,
approaching a large stone that looked heavy enough to require
the strength of a Hercules to stir it. Nevertheless, with one
hand he turned it aside, it being so nicely poised that there
was no trouble in using it as a door on hinges. Drawn back, the
astonished whites saw the entrance to a cave beyond. The indications
were that, at some remote time, the stones had been placed in
position by a party of aborigines of the country, and used by
them as a retreat or dwelling.</p>

<p>"It is the very place," said Rosa; "for I have been inside."</p>

<p>"You? When?" asked her brother.</p>

<p>"Lena-Wingo brought me here one day last fall, when we were caught
in a storm in these mountains!"</p>

<p>"What kind of a place is it?"</p>

<p>"There could be no better one for us. I thought of it this morning,
and spoke to Lena-Wingo about it."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"He replied that he would probably take us here, if he found
we had to keep out of sight for awhile."</p>

<p>"That is well, then. Mr. Worrell has done for us what the Mohawk
meant to do later in the day."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I would not have proposed to you that we should
come here after he left, if I had been sure of finding my way,
but I wasn't."</p>

<p>"Is the interior comfortable?"</p>

<p>"It is in warm weather, for none of the sun's rays can enter,
and the stones seem to give it coolness."</p>

<p>"As dark as a wolf's mouth, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. There are several windows, made by crevices between
the stones, which let in enough light to help us see where we
are."</p>

<p>"The young lady speaks the truth," said Worrell. "She has been
in and remembers all about it."</p>

<p>"How came you to find it when it is so well concealed?"</p>

<p>"I was hunting a bear in these mountains some two years ago and
wounded him, when he started to retreat. I followed him as fast
as I could, when he put straight for this heap of stones, and
he would have got away if I hadn't come in sight just in time
to see him pull that door aside with one paw and start in. I gave
him a shot as he was doing so, and it finished him before he could
get out of my reach."</p>

<p>The reports of the cavern being so favorable, the fugitives were
glad to avail themselves of its shelter without further delay.
Ned Clinton was the first to explore the retreat, he being obliged
to assume a stooping position to enter it. As soon as he was inside,
he called to the others to follow, and Worrell himself obeyed,
Jo going next, while Rosa came last.</p>

<p>The place was not a disappointment in the least when viewed from
the inside. The windows of which Rosa spoke proved sufficient
to give all the light they could ask, and more than the young
scouts expected to see. Besides, when they were fairly within
it was noticed that the roof ascended, while the floor was lowered
to that extent that they could easily stand at their full height&mdash;a
luxury which any one in their situation would have appreciated.
It was dry, and there was nothing to make them uncomfortable.
Expressions of delight came from all, excepting him who had taken
them to the retreat. He seemed to enjoy listening to the praise
bestowed upon his choice.</p>

<p>"Ah! if some of the poor fellows who were fleeing from Monacacy
and the woods, after the battle," said Ned, "could have stumbled
upon this they would have been safe."</p>

<p>"And even if they had been seen," added Jo, "they could have
turned it into a fort itself, and held out against ten times their
number."</p>

<p>"Then why can we not make the same use of it?" asked Rosa. "It
will serve us if Colonel Butler happens to discover where we are
hid."</p>

<p>"He isn't going to discover us," put in Worrell, with a confidence
which gave the youths greater faith in their safety than before;
but which, strange to say, impressed Rosa in the opposite manner.</p>

<p>It was the manner rather than the words that grated on her sensibilities,
and she found her old mistrust of the man deeper than before.
It struck her that he was too ready to declare they were now beyond
the reach of Colonel Butler and his men. It was like parrying
a blow before it was struck, though the young men readily saw
in the words which called out the remark sufficient cause for
the same. With this suspicion came a conviction that, despite
the critical position in which they seemed to be placed, when
awaiting the return of the Mohawk, they had committed a perilous
blunder in leaving the spot where he would expect to find them.</p>

<p>"I said there was no danger of our being discovered by Colonel
Butler or any of his men; but maybe that was putting it too strong,
for I suppose that we are always in danger as long as them redskins
are within a dozen miles of us; but what I meant to say was, that
there ain't any spot anywhere among these mountains where you
can feel safer from the enemy than here."</p>

<p>This is what he ought to have said in the first place, as it
seemed to Rosa, and yet the after effect of the words was almost
as if they had been uttered at the right time. A strange compound
is that which goes to make up the emotions of man and woman; for
with the expression just given, Rosa Minturn experienced something
like a revulsion of feeling, and reproved herself that she should
have suspected the man at all. She saw in him nothing but a simple-minded
hunter-settler, who was a fugitive for the time being like themselves,
and was anxious to befriend them to the best of his ability. The
most circumspect and devoted ally would have acted as he did.
Because he was dressed in rather shabby attire, and was unattractive
in person, should she doubt his loyalty? Had she not lived long
enough to learn that "the rank is but a guinea's stamp," and that,
though repulsive without, he might be "a man for a' that?"</p>
