<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>On the eighth day of last December, Mon. Gerbois, professor of
mathematics at the College of Versailles, while rummaging in an old
curiosity-shop, unearthed a small mahogany writing-desk which pleased
him very much on account of the multiplicity of its drawers.
</p><p>"Just the thing for Suzanne's birthday present," thought he. And as he
always tried to furnish some simple pleasures for his daughter,
consistent with his modest income, he enquired the price, and, after
some keen bargaining, purchased it for sixty-five francs. As he was
giving his address to the shopkeeper, a young man, dressed with elegance
and taste, who had been exploring the stock of antiques, caught sight
of the writing-desk, and immediately enquired its price.
</p><p>"It is sold," replied the shopkeeper.
</p><p>"Ah! to this gentleman, I presume?"
</p><p>Monsieur Gerbois bowed, and left the store, quite proud to be the
possessor of an article which had attracted the attention of a gentleman
of quality. But he had not taken a dozen steps in the street, when he
was overtaken by the young man who, hat in hand and in a tone of perfect
courtesy, thus addressed him:
</p><p>"I beg your pardon, monsieur; I am going to ask you a question that you
may deem impertinent. It is this: Did you have any special object in
view when you bought that writing-desk?"
</p><p>"No, I came across it by chance and it struck my fancy."
</p><p>"But you do not care for it particularly?"
</p><p>"Oh! I shall keep it--that is all."
</p><p>"Because it is an antique, perhaps?"
</p><p>"No; because it is convenient," declared Mon. Gerbois.
</p><p>"In that case, you would consent to exchange it for another desk that
would be quite as convenient and in better condition?"
</p><p>"Oh! this one is in good condition, and I see no object in making an
exchange."
</p><p>"But----"
</p><p>Mon. Gerbois is a man of irritable disposition and hasty temper. So he
replied, testily:
</p><p>"I beg of you, monsieur, do not insist."
</p><p>But the young man firmly held his ground.
</p><p>"I don't know how much you paid for it, monsieur, but I offer you
double."
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"Three times the amount."
</p><p>"Oh! that will do," exclaimed the professor, impatiently; "I don't wish
to sell it."
</p><p>The young man stared at him for a moment in a manner that Mon. Gerbois
would not readily forget, then turned and walked rapidly away.
</p><p>An hour later, the desk was delivered at the professor's house on the
Viroflay road. He called his daughter, and said:
</p><p>"Here is something for you, Suzanne, provided you like it."
</p><p>Suzanne was a pretty girl, with a gay and affectionate nature. She threw
her arms around her father's neck and kissed him rapturously. To her,
the desk had all the semblance of a royal gift. That evening, assisted
by Hortense, the servant, she placed the desk in her room; then she
dusted it, cleaned the drawers and pigeon-holes, and carefully arranged
within it her papers, writing material, correspondence, a collection of
post-cards, and some souvenirs of her cousin Philippe that she kept in
secret.
</p><p>Next morning, at half past seven, Mon. Gerbois went to the college. At
ten o'clock, in pursuance of her usual custom, Suzanne went to meet him,
and it was a great pleasure for him to see her slender figure and
childish smile waiting for him at the college gate. They returned home
together.
</p><p>"And your writing desk--how is it this morning?"
</p><p>"Marvellous! Hortense and I have polished the brass mountings until they
look like gold."
</p><p>"So you are pleased with it?"
</p><p>"Pleased with it! Why, I don't see how I managed to get on without it
for such a long time."
</p><p>As they were walking up the pathway to the house, Mon. Gerbois said:
</p><p>"Shall we go and take a look at it before breakfast?"
</p><p>"Oh! yes, that's a splendid idea!"
</p><p>She ascended the stairs ahead of her father, but, on arriving at the
door of her room, she uttered a cry of surprise and dismay.
</p><p>"What's the matter?" stammered Mon. Gerbois.
</p><p>"The writing-desk is gone!"
</p><hr/>
<p>When the police were called in, they were astonished at the admirable
simplicity of the means employed by the thief. During Suzanne's absence,
the servant had gone to market, and while the house was thus left
unguarded, a drayman, wearing a badge--some of the neighbors saw
it--stopped his cart in front of the house and rang twice. Not knowing
that Hortense was absent, the neighbors were not suspicious;
consequently, the man carried on his work in peace and tranquility.
</p><p>Apart from the desk, not a thing in the house had been disturbed. Even
Suzanne's purse, which she had left upon the writing-desk, was found
upon an adjacent table with its contents untouched. It was obvious that
the thief had come with a set purpose, which rendered the crime even
more mysterious; because, why did he assume so great a risk for such a
trifling object?
</p><p>The only clue the professor could furnish was the strange incident of
the preceding evening. He declared:
</p><p>"The young man was greatly provoked at my refusal, and I had an idea
that he threatened me as he went away."
</p><p>But the clue was a vague one. The shopkeeper could not throw any light
on the affair. He did not know either of the gentlemen. As to the desk
itself, he had purchased it for forty francs at an executor's sale at
Chevreuse, and believed he had resold it at its fair value. The police
investigation disclosed nothing more.
</p><p>But Mon. Gerbois entertained the idea that he had suffered an enormous
loss. There must have been a fortune concealed in a secret drawer, and
that was the reason the young man had resorted to crime.
</p><p>"My poor father, what would we have done with that fortune?" asked
Suzanne.
</p><p>"My child! with such a fortune, you could make a most advantageous
marriage."
</p><p>Suzanne sighed bitterly. Her aspirations soared no higher than her
cousin Philippe, who was indeed a most deplorable object. And life, in
the little house at Versailles, was not so happy and contented as of
yore.
</p><p>Two months passed away. Then came a succession of startling events, a
strange blending of good luck and dire misfortune!
</p><p>On the first day of February, at half-past five, Mon. Gerbois entered
the house, carrying an evening paper, took a seat, put on his
spectacles, and commenced to read. As politics did not interest him, he
turned to the inside of the paper. Immediately his attention was
attracted by an article entitled:
</p><p>"Third Drawing of the Press Association Lottery.
</p><p>"No. 514, series 23, draws a million."
</p><p>The newspaper slipped from his fingers. The walls swam before his eyes,
and his heart ceased to beat. He held No. 514, series 23. He had
purchased it from a friend, to oblige him, without any thought of
success, and behold, it was the lucky number!
</p><p>Quickly, he took out his memorandum-book. Yes, he was quite right. The
No. 514, series 23, was written there, on the inside of the cover. But
the ticket?
</p><p>He rushed to his desk to find the envelope-box in which he had placed
the precious ticket; but the box was not there, and it suddenly occurred
to him that it had not been there for several weeks. He heard footsteps
on the gravel walk leading from the street.
</p><p>He called:
</p><p>"Suzanne! Suzanne!"
</p><p>She was returning from a walk. She entered hastily. He stammered, in a
choking voice:
</p><p>"Suzanne ... the box ... the box of envelopes?"
</p><p>"What box?"
</p><p>"The one I bought at the Louvre ... one Saturday ... it was at the end
of that table."
</p><p>"Don't you remember, father, we put all those things away together."
</p><p>"When?"
</p><p>"The evening ... you know ... the same evening...."
</p><p>"But where?... Tell me, quick!... Where?"
</p><p>"Where? Why, in the writing-desk."
</p><p>"In the writing-desk that was stolen?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Oh, mon Dieu!... In the stolen desk!"
</p><p>He uttered the last sentence in a low voice, in a sort of stupor. Then
he seized her hand, and in a still lower voice, he said:
</p><p>"It contained a million, my child."
</p><p>"Ah! father, why didn't you tell me?" she murmured, naively.
</p><p>"A million!" he repeated. "It contained the ticket that drew the grand
prize in the Press Lottery."
</p><p>The colossal proportions of the disaster overwhelmed them, and for a
long time they maintained a silence that they feared to break. At last,
Suzanne said:
</p><p>"But, father, they will pay you just the same."
</p><p>"How? On what proof?"
</p><p>"Must you have proof?"
</p><p>"Of course."
</p><p>"And you haven't any?"
</p><p>"It was in the box."
</p><p>"In the box that has disappeared."
</p><p>"Yes; and now the thief will get the money."
</p><p>"Oh! that would be terrible, father. You must prevent it."
</p><p>For a moment he was silent; then, in an outburst of energy, he leaped
up, stamped on the floor, and exclaimed:
</p><p>"No, no, he shall not have that million; he shall not have it! Why
should he have it? Ah! clever as he is, he can do nothing. If he goes to
claim the money, they will arrest him. Ah! now, we will see, my fine
fellow!"
</p><p>"What will you do, father?"
</p><p>"Defend our just rights, whatever happens! And we will succeed. The
million francs belong to me, and I intend to have them."
</p><p>A few minutes later, he sent this telegram:
</p><p>     "Governor Crédit Foncier
</p><p>     "rue Capucines, Paris.
</p><pre>
     "Am holder of No. 514, series 23. Oppose by all legal means any
     other claimant.
     "GERBOIS."</pre>
<p>Almost at the same moment, the Crédit Foncier received the following
telegram:
</p><p>     "No. 514, series 23, is in my possession.
</p><p><strong>"ARSÈNE LUPIN."</strong>
</p><hr/>
<p>Every time I undertake to relate one of the many extraordinary
adventures that mark the life of Arsène Lupin, I experience a feeling of
embarrassment, as it seems to me that the most commonplace of those
adventures is already well known to my readers. In fact, there is not a
movement of our "national thief," as he has been so aptly described,
that has not been given the widest publicity, not an exploit that has
not been studied in all its phases, not an action that has not been
discussed with that particularity usually reserved for the recital of
heroic deeds.
</p><p>For instance, who does not know the strange history of "The Blonde
Lady," with those curious episodes which were proclaimed by the
newspapers with heavy black headlines, as follows: "Lottery Ticket No.
514!" ... "The Crime on the Avenue Henri-Martin!" ... "The Blue
Diamond!" ... The interest created by the intervention of the celebrated
English detective, Herlock Sholmes! The excitement aroused by the
various vicissitudes which marked the struggle between those famous
artists! And what a commotion on the boulevards, the day on which the
newsboys announced: "Arrest of Arsène Lupin!"
</p><p>My excuse for repeating these stories at this time is the fact that I
produce the key to the enigma. Those adventures have always been
enveloped in a certain degree of obscurity, which I now remove. I
reproduce old newspaper articles, I relate old-time interviews, I
present ancient letters; but I have arranged and classified all that
material and reduced it to the exact truth. My collaborators in this
work have been Arsène Lupin himself, and also the ineffable Wilson, the
friend and confidant of Herlock Sholmes.
</p><p>Every one will recall the tremendous burst of laughter which greeted the
publication of those two telegrams. The name "Arsène Lupin" was in
itself a stimulus to curiosity, a promise of amusement for the gallery.
And, in this case, the gallery means the entire world.
</p><p>An investigation was immediately commenced by the Crédit Foncier, which
established these facts: That ticket No. 514, series 23, had been sold
by the Versailles branch office of the Lottery to an artillery officer
named Bessy, who was afterward killed by a fall from his horse. Some
time before his death, he informed some of his comrades that he had
transferred his ticket to a friend.
</p><p>"And I am that friend," affirmed Mon. Gerbois.
</p><p>"Prove it," replied the governor of the Crédit Foncier.
</p><p>"Of course I can prove it. Twenty people can tell you that I was an
intimate friend of Monsieur Bessy, and that we frequently met at the
Café de la Place-d'Armes. It was there, one day, I purchased the ticket
from him for twenty francs--simply as an accommodation to him.
</p><p>"Have you any witnesses to that transaction?"
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"Well, how do you expect to prove it?"
</p><p>"By a letter he wrote to me."
</p><p>"What letter?"
</p><p>"A letter that was pinned to the ticket."
</p><p>"Produce it."
</p><p>"It was stolen at the same time as the ticket."
</p><p>"Well, you must find it."
</p><p>It was soon learned that Arsène Lupin had the letter. A short paragraph
appeared in the <u>Echo de France</u>--which has the honor to be his official
organ, and of which, it is said, he is one of the principal
shareholders--the paragraph announced that Arsène Lupin had placed in
the hands of Monsieur Detinan, his advocate and legal adviser, the
letter that Monsieur Bessy had written to him--to him personally.
</p><p>This announcement provoked an outburst of laughter. Arsène Lupin had
engaged a lawyer! Arsène Lupin, conforming to the rules and customs of
modern society, had appointed a legal representative in the person of a
well-known member of the Parisian bar!
</p><p>Mon. Detinan had never enjoyed the pleasure of meeting Arsène Lupin--a
fact he deeply regretted--but he had actually been retained by that
mysterious gentleman and felt greatly honored by the choice. He was
prepared to defend the interests of his client to the best of his
ability. He was pleased, even proud, to exhibit the letter of Mon.
Bessy, but, although it proved the transfer of the ticket, it did not
mention the name of the purchaser. It was simply addressed to "My Dear
Friend."
</p><p>"My Dear Friend! that is I," added Arsène Lupin, in a note attached to
Mon. Bessy's letter. "And the best proof of that fact is that I hold the
letter."
</p><p>The swarm of reporters immediately rushed to see Mon. Gerbois, who could
only repeat:
</p><p>"My Dear Friend! that is I.... Arsène Lupin stole the letter with the
lottery ticket."
</p><p>"Let him prove it!" retorted Lupin to the reporters.
</p><p>"He must have done it, because he stole the writing-desk!" exclaimed
Mon. Gerbois before the same reporters.
</p><p>"Let him prove it!" replied Lupin.
</p><p>Such was the entertaining comedy enacted by the two claimants of ticket
No. 514; and the calm demeanor of Arsène Lupin contrasted strangely with
the nervous perturbation of poor Mon. Gerbois. The newspapers were
filled with the lamentations of that unhappy man. He announced his
misfortune with pathetic candor.
</p><p>"Understand, gentlemen, it was Suzanne's dowry that the rascal stole!
Personally, I don't care a straw for it,... but for Suzanne! Just think
of it, a whole million! Ten times one hundred thousand francs! Ah! I
knew very well that the desk contained a treasure!"
</p><p>It was in vain to tell him that his adversary, when stealing the desk,
was unaware that the lottery ticket was in it, and that, in any event,
he could not foresee that the ticket would draw the grand prize. He
would reply;
</p><p>"Nonsense! of course, he knew it ... else why would he take the trouble
to steal a poor, miserable desk?"
</p><p>"For some unknown reason; but certainly not for a small scrap of paper
which was then worth only twenty francs."
</p><p>"A million francs! He knew it;... he knows everything! Ah! you do not
know him--the scoundrel!... He hasn't robbed you of a million francs!"
</p><p>The controversy would have lasted for a much longer time, but, on the
twelfth day, Mon. Gerbois received from Arsène Lupin a letter, marked
"confidential," which read as follows:
</p><pre>
     "Monsieur, the gallery is being amused at our expense. Do you not
     think it is time for us to be serious? The situation is this: I
     possess a ticket to which I have no legal right, and you have the
     legal right to a ticket you do not possess. Neither of us can do
     anything. You will not relinquish your rights to me; I will not
     deliver the ticket to you. Now, what is to be done?
     "I see only one way out of the difficulty: Let us divide the
     spoils. A half-million for you; a half-million for me. Is not that
     a fair division? In my opinion, it is an equitable solution, and an
     immediate one. I will give you three days' time to consider the
     proposition. On Thursday morning I shall expect to read in the
     personal column of the Echo de France a discreet message addressed
     to <u>M. Ars. Lup</u>, expressing in veiled terms your consent to my
     offer. By so doing you will recover immediate possession of the
     ticket; then you can collect the money and send me half a million
     in a manner that I will describe to you later.
     "In case of your refusal, I shall resort to other measures to
     accomplish the same result. But, apart from the very serious
     annoyances that such obstinacy on your part will cause you, it will
     cost you twenty-five thousand francs for supplementary expenses.
     "Believe me, monsieur, I remain your devoted servant, ARSÈNE
     LUPIN."</pre>
<p>In a fit of exasperation Mon. Gerbois committed the grave mistake of
showing that letter and allowing a copy of it to be taken. His
indignation overcame his discretion.
</p><p>"Nothing! He shall have nothing!" he exclaimed, before a crowd of
reporters. "To divide my property with him? Never! Let him tear up the
ticket if he wishes!"
</p><p>"Yet five hundred thousand francs is better than nothing."
</p><p>"That is not the question. It is a question of my just right, and that
right I will establish before the courts."
</p><p>"What! attack Arsène Lupin? That would be amusing."
</p><p>"No; but the Crédit Foncier. They must pay me the million francs."
</p><p>"Without producing the ticket, or, at least, without proving that you
bought it?"
</p><p>"That proof exists, since Arsène Lupin admits that he stole the
writing-desk."
</p><p>"But would the word of Arsène Lupin carry any weight with the court?"
</p><p>"No matter; I will fight it out."
</p><p>The gallery shouted with glee; and wagers were freely made upon the
result with the odds in favor of Lupin. On the following Thursday the
personal column in the <u>Echo de France</u> was eagerly perused by the
expectant public, but it contained nothing addressed to <u>M. Ars. Lup</u>.
Mon. Gerbois had not replied to Arsène Lupin's letter. That was the
declaration of war.
</p><p>That evening the newspapers announced the abduction of Mlle. Suzanne
Gerbois.
</p><hr/>
<p>The most entertaining feature in what might be called the Arsène Lupin
dramas is the comic attitude displayed by the Parisian police. Arsène
Lupin talks, plans, writes, commands, threatens and executes as if the
police did not exist. They never figure in his calculations.
</p><p>And yet the police do their utmost. But what can they do against such a
foe--a foe that scorns and ignores them?
</p><p>Suzanne had left the house at twenty minutes to ten; such was the
testimony of the servant. On leaving the college, at five minutes past
ten, her father did not find her at the place she was accustomed to wait
for him. Consequently, whatever had happened must have occurred during
the course of Suzanne's walk from the house to the college. Two
neighbors had met her about three hundred yards from the house. A lady
had seen, on the avenue, a young girl corresponding to Suzanne's
description. No one else had seen her.
</p><p>Inquiries were made in all directions; the employees of the railways and
street-car lines were questioned, but none of them had seen anything of
the missing girl. However, at Ville-d'Avray, they found a shopkeeper who
had furnished gasoline to an automobile that had come from Paris on the
day of the abduction. It was occupied by a blonde woman--extremely
blonde, said the witness. An hour later, the automobile again passed
through Ville-d'Avray on its way from Versailles to Paris. The
shopkeeper declared that the automobile now contained a second woman
who was heavily veiled. No doubt, it was Suzanne Gerbois.
</p><p>The abduction must have taken place in broad daylight, on a frequented
street, in the very heart of the town. How? And at what spot? Not a cry
was heard; not a suspicious action had been seen. The shopkeeper
described the automobile as a royal-blue limousine of twenty-four
horse-power made by the firm of Peugeon &amp; Co. Inquiries were then made
at the Grand-Garage, managed by Madame Bob-Walthour, who made a
specialty of abductions by automobile. It was learned that she had
rented a Peugeon limousine on that day to a blonde woman whom she had
never seen before nor since.
</p><p>"Who was the chauffeur?"
</p><p>"A young man named Ernest, whom I had engaged only the day before. He
came well recommended."
</p><p>"Is he here now?"
</p><p>"No. He brought back the machine, but I haven't seen him since," said
Madame Bob-Walthour.
</p><p>"Do you know where we can find him?"
</p><p>"You might see the people who recommended him to me. Here are the
names."
</p><p>Upon inquiry, it was learned that none of these people knew the man
called Ernest. The recommendations were forged.
</p><p>Such was the fate of every clue followed by the police. It ended
nowhere. The mystery remained unsolved.
</p><p>Mon. Gerbois had not the strength or courage to wage such an unequal
battle. The disappearance of his daughter crushed him; he capitulated
to the enemy. A short announcement in the <u>Echo de France</u> proclaimed
his unconditional surrender.
</p><p>Two days later, Mon. Gerbois visited the office of the Crédit Foncier
and handed lottery ticket number 514, series 23, to the governor, who
exclaimed, with surprise:
</p><p>"Ah! you have it! He has returned it to you!"
</p><p>"It was mislaid. That was all," replied Mon. Gerbois.
</p><p>"But you pretended that it had been stolen."
</p><p>"At first, I thought it had ... but here it is."
</p><p>"We will require some evidence to establish your right to the ticket."
</p><p>"Will the letter of the purchaser, Monsieur Bessy, be sufficient!"
</p><p>"Yes, that will do."
</p><p>"Here it is," said Mon. Gerbois, producing the letter.
</p><p>"Very well. Leave these papers with us. The rules of the lottery allow
us fifteen days' time to investigate your claim. I will let you know
when to call for your money. I presume you desire, as much as I do, that
this affair should be closed without further publicity."
</p><p>"Quite so."
</p><p>Mon. Gerbois and the governor henceforth maintained a discreet silence.
But the secret was revealed in some way, for it was soon commonly known
that Arsène Lupin had returned the lottery ticket to Mon. Gerbois. The
public received the news with astonishment and admiration. Certainly, he
was a bold gamester who thus threw upon the table a trump card of such
importance as the precious ticket. But, it was true, he still retained a
trump card of equal importance. However, if the young girl should
escape? If the hostage held by Arsène Lupin should be rescued?
</p><p>The police thought they had discovered the weak spot of the enemy, and
now redoubled their efforts. Arsène Lupin disarmed by his own act,
crushed by the wheels of his own machination, deprived of every sou of
the coveted million ... public interest now centered in the camp of his
adversary.
</p><p>But it was necessary to find Suzanne. And they did not find her, nor did
she escape. Consequently, it must be admitted, Arsène Lupin had won the
first hand. But the game was not yet decided. The most difficult point
remained. Mlle. Gerbois is in his possession, and he will hold her until
he receives five hundred thousand francs. But how and where will such an
exchange be made? For that purpose, a meeting must be arranged, and then
what will prevent Mon. Gerbois from warning the police and, in that way,
effecting the rescue of his daughter and, at the same time, keeping his
money? The professor was interviewed, but he was extremely reticent. His
answer was:
</p><p>"I have nothing to say."
</p><p>"And Mlle. Gerbois?"
</p><p>"The search is being continued."
</p><p>"But Arsène Lupin has written to you?"
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"Do you swear to that?"
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"Then it is true. What are his instructions?"
</p><p>"I have nothing to say."
</p><p>Then the interviewers attacked Mon. Detinan, and found him equally
discreet.
</p><p>"Monsieur Lupin is my client, and I cannot discuss his affairs," he
replied, with an affected air of gravity.
</p><p>These mysteries served to irritate the gallery. Obviously, some secret
negotiations were in progress. Arsène Lupin had arranged and tightened
the meshes of his net, while the police maintained a close watch, day
and night, over Mon. Gerbois. And the three and only possible
dénouements--the arrest, the triumph, or the ridiculous and pitiful
abortion--were freely discussed; but the curiosity of the public was
only partially satisfied, and it was reserved for these pages to reveal
the exact truth of the affair.
</p><hr/>
<p>On Monday, March 12th, Mon. Gerbois received a notice from the Crédit
Foncier. On Wednesday, he took the one o'clock train for Paris. At two
o'clock, a thousand bank-notes of one thousand francs each were
delivered to him. Whilst he was counting them, one by one, in a state of
nervous agitation--that money, which represented Suzanne's ransom--a
carriage containing two men stopped at the curb a short distance from
the bank. One of the men had grey hair and an unusually shrewd
expression which formed a striking contrast to his shabby make-up. It
was Detective Ganimard, the relentless enemy of Arsène Lupin. Ganimard
said to his companion, Folenfant:
</p><p>"In five minutes, we will see our clever friend Lupin. Is everything
ready?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"How many men have we?"
</p><p>"Eight--two of them on bicycles."
</p><p>"Enough, but not too many. On no account, must Gerbois escape us; if he
does, it is all up. He will meet Lupin at the appointed place, give half
a million in exchange for the girl, and the game will be over."
</p><p>"But why doesn't Gerbois work with us? That would be the better way, and
he could keep all the money himself."
</p><p>"Yes, but he is afraid that if he deceives the other, he will not get
his daughter."
</p><p>"What other?"
</p><p>"Lupin."
</p><p>Ganimard pronounced the word in a solemn tone, somewhat timidly, as if
he were speaking of some supernatural creature whose claws he already
felt.
</p><p>"It is very strange," remarked Folenfant, judiciously, "that we are
obliged to protect this gentleman contrary to his own wishes."
</p><p>"Yes, but Lupin always turns the world upside down," said Ganimard,
mournfully.
</p><p>A moment later, Mon. Gerbois appeared, and started up the street. At the
end of the rue des Capucines, he turned into the boulevards, walking
slowly, and stopping frequently to gaze at the shop-windows.
</p><p>"Much too calm, too self-possessed," said Ganimard. "A man with a
million in his pocket would not have that air of tranquillity."
</p><p>"What is he doing?"
</p><p>"Oh! nothing, evidently.... But I have a suspicion that it is
Lupin--yes, Lupin!"
</p><p>At that moment, Mon. Gerbois stopped at a news-stand, purchased a paper,
unfolded it and commenced to read it as he walked slowly away. A moment
later, he gave a sudden bound into an automobile that was standing at
the curb. Apparently, the machine had been waiting for him, as it
started away rapidly, turned at the Madeleine and disappeared.
</p><p>"Nom de nom!" cried Ganimard, "that's one of his old tricks!"
</p><p>Ganimard hastened after the automobile around the Madeleine. Then, he
burst into laughter. At the entrance to the Boulevard Malesherbes, the
automobile had stopped and Mon. Gerbois had alighted.
</p><p>"Quick, Folenfant, the chauffeur! It may be the man Ernest."
</p><p>Folenfant interviewed the chauffeur. His name was Gaston; he was an
employee of the automobile cab company; ten minutes ago, a gentleman had
engaged him and told him to wait near the news-stand for another
gentleman.
</p><p>"And the second man--what address did he give?" asked Folenfant.
</p><p>"No address. 'Boulevard Malesherbes ... avenue de Messine ... double
pourboire.' That is all."
</p><p>But, during this time, Mon. Gerbois had leaped into the first passing
carriage.
</p><p>"To the Concorde station, Metropolitan," he said to the driver.
</p><p>He left the underground at the Place du Palais-Royal, ran to another
carriage and ordered it to go to the Place de la Bourse. Then a second
journey by the underground to the Avenue de Villiers, followed by a
third carriage drive to number 25 rue Clapeyron.
</p><p>Number 25 rue Clapeyron is separated from the Boulevard des Batignolles
by the house which occupies the angle formed by the two streets. He
ascended to the first floor and rang. A gentleman opened the door.
</p><p>"Does Monsieur Detinan live here?"
</p><p>"Yes, that is my name. Are you Monsieur Gerbois?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"I was expecting you. Step in."
</p><p>As Mon. Gerbois entered the lawyer's office, the clock struck three. He
said:
</p><p>"I am prompt to the minute. Is he here?"
</p><p>"Not yet."
</p><p>Mon. Gerbois took a seat, wiped his forehead, looked at his watch as if
he did not know the time, and inquired, anxiously:
</p><p>"Will he come?"
</p><p>"Well, monsieur," replied the lawyer, "that I do not know, but I am
quite as anxious and impatient as you are to find out. If he comes, he
will run a great risk, as this house has been closely watched for the
last two weeks. They distrust me."
</p><p>"They suspect me, too. I am not sure whether the detectives lost sight
of me or not on my way here."
</p><p>"But you were--"
</p><p>"It wouldn't be my fault," cried the professor, quickly. "You cannot
reproach me. I promised to obey his orders, and I followed them to the
very letter. I drew the money at the time fixed by him, and I came here
in the manner directed by him. I have faithfully performed my part of
the agreement--let him do his!"
</p><p>After a short silence, he asked, anxiously:
</p><p>"He will bring my daughter, won't he?"
</p><p>"I expect so."
</p><p>"But ... you have seen him?"
</p><p>"I? No, not yet. He made the appointment by letter, saying both of you
would be here, and asking me to dismiss my servants before three o'clock
and admit no one while you were here. If I would not consent to that
arrangement, I was to notify him by a few words in <u>the Echo de France</u>.
But I am only too happy to oblige Mon. Lupin, and so I consented."
</p><p>"Ah! how will this end?" moaned Mon. Gerbois.
</p><p>He took the bank-notes from his pocket, placed them on the table and
divided them into two equal parts. Then the two men sat there in
silence. From time to time, Mon. Gerbois would listen. Did someone
ring?... His nervousness increased every minute, and Monsieur Detinan
also displayed considerable anxiety. At last, the lawyer lost his
patience. He rose abruptly, and said:
</p><p>"He will not come.... We shouldn't expect it. It would be folly on his
part. He would run too great a risk."
</p><p>And Mon. Gerbois, despondent, his hands resting on the bank-notes,
stammered:
</p><p>"Oh! Mon Dieu! I hope he will come. I would give the whole of that money
to see my daughter again."
</p><p>The door opened.
</p><p>"Half of it will be sufficient, Monsieur Gerbois."
</p><p>These words were spoken by a well-dressed young man who now entered the
room and was immediately recognized by Mon. Gerbois as the person who
had wished to buy the desk from him at Versailles. He rushed toward him.
</p><p>"Where is my daughter--my Suzanne?"
</p><p>Arsène Lupin carefully closed the door, and, while slowly removing his
gloves, said to the lawyer:
</p><p>"My dear maître, I am indebted to you very much for your kindness in
consenting to defend my interests. I shall not forget it."
</p><p>Mon. Detinan murmured:
</p><p>"But you did not ring. I did not hear the door--"
</p><p>"Doors and bells are things that should work without being heard. I am
here, and that is the important point."
</p><p>"My daughter! Suzanne! Where is she!" repeated the professor.
</p><p>"Mon Dieu, monsieur," said Lupin, "what's your hurry? Your daughter will
be here in a moment."
</p><p>Lupin walked to and fro for a minute, then, with the pompous air of an
orator, he said:
</p><p>"Monsieur Gerbois, I congratulate you on the clever way in which you
made the journey to this place."
</p><p>Then, perceiving the two piles of bank-notes, he exclaimed:
</p><p>"Ah! I see! the million is here. We will not lose any time. Permit me."
</p><p>"One moment," said the lawyer, placing himself before the table. "Mlle.
Gerbois has not yet arrived."
</p><p>"Well?"
</p><p>"Is not her presence indispensable?"
</p><p>"I understand! I understand! Arsène Lupin inspires only a limited
confidence. He might pocket the half-million and not restore the
hostage. Ah! monsieur, people do not understand me. Because I have been
obliged, by force of circumstances, to commit certain actions a little
... out of the ordinary, my good faith is impugned ... I, who have
always observed the utmost scrupulosity and delicacy in business
affairs. Besides, my dear monsieur if you have any fear, open the window
and call. There are at least a dozen detectives in the street."
</p><p>"Do you think so?"
</p><p>Arsène Lupin raised the curtain.
</p><p>"I think that Monsieur Gerbois could not throw Ganimard off the
scent.... What did I tell you? There he is now."
</p><p>"Is it possible!" exclaimed the professor. "But I swear to you--"
</p><p>"That you have not betrayed me?... I do not doubt you, but those fellows
are clever--sometimes. Ah! I can see Folenfant, and Greaume, and
Dieuzy--all good friends of mine!"
</p><p>Mon. Detinan looked at Lupin in amazement. What assurance! He laughed as
merrily as if engaged in some childish sport, as if no danger threatened
him. This unconcern reassured the lawyer more than the presence of the
detectives. He left the table on which the bank-notes were lying. Arsène
Lupin picked up one pile of bills after the other, took from each of
them twenty-five bank-notes which he offered to Mon. Detinan, saying:
</p><p>"The reward of your services to Monsieur Gerbois and Arsène Lupin. You
well deserve it."
</p><p>"You owe me nothing," replied the lawyer.
</p><p>"What! After all the trouble we have caused you!"
</p><p>"And all the pleasure you have given me!"
</p><p>"That means, my dear monsieur, that you do not wish to accept anything
from Arsène Lupin. See what it is to have a bad reputation."
</p><p>He then offered the fifty thousand francs to Mon. Gerbois, saying:
</p><p>"Monsieur, in memory of our pleasant interview, permit me to return you
this as a wedding-gift to Mlle. Gerbois."
</p><p>Mon. Gerbois took the money, but said:
</p><p>"My daughter will not marry."
</p><p>"She will not marry if you refuse your consent; but she wishes to
marry."
</p><p>"What do you know about it?"
</p><p>"I know that young girls often dream of such things unknown to their
parents. Fortunately, there are sometimes good genii like Arsène Lupin
who discover their little secrets in the drawers of their writing
desks."
</p><p>"Did you find anything else?" asked the lawyer. "I confess I am curious
to know why you took so much trouble to get possession of that desk."
</p><p>"On account of its historic interest, my friend. Although despite the
opinion of Monsieur Gerbois, the desk contained no treasure except the
lottery ticket--and that was unknown to me--I had been seeking it for a
long time. That writing-desk of yew and mahogany was discovered in the
little house in which Marie Walêwska once lived in Boulogne, and, on one
of the drawers there is this inscription: '<u>Dedicated to Napoleon I,
Emperor of the French, by his very faithful servant, Mancion</u>.' And
above it, these words, engraved with the point of a knife: 'To you,
Marie.' Afterwards, Napoleon had a similar desk made for the Empress
Josephine; so that the secretary that was so much admired at the
Malmaison was only an imperfect copy of the one that will henceforth
form part of my collection."
</p><p>"Ah! if I had known, when in the shop, I would gladly have given it up
to you," said the professor.
</p><p>Arsène Lupin smiled, as he replied:
</p><p>"And you would have had the advantage of keeping for your own use
lottery ticket number 514."
</p><p>"And you would not have found it necessary to abduct my daughter."
</p><p>"Abduct your daughter?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"My dear monsieur, you are mistaken. Mlle. Gerbois was not abducted."
</p><p>"No?"
</p><p>"Certainly not. Abduction means force or violence. And I assure you that
she served as hostage of her own free will."
</p><p>"Of her own free will!" repeated Mon. Gerbois, in amazement.
</p><p>"In fact, she almost asked to be taken. Why, do you suppose that an
intelligent young girl like Mlle. Gerbois, and who, moreover, nourishes
an unacknowledged passion, would hesitate to do what was necessary to
secure her dowry. Ah! I swear to you it was not difficult to make her
understand that it was the only way to overcome your obstinacy."
</p><p>Mon. Detinan was greatly amused. He replied to Lupin:
</p><p>"But I should think it was more difficult to get her to listen to you.
How did you approach her?"
</p><p>"Oh! I didn't approach her myself. I have not the honor of her
acquaintance. A friend of mine, a lady, carried on the negotiations."
</p><p>"The blonde woman in the automobile, no doubt."
</p><p>"Precisely. All arrangements were made at the first interview near the
college. Since then, Mlle. Gerbois and her new friend have been
travelling in Belgium and Holland in a manner that should prove most
pleasing and instructive to a young girl. She will tell you all about it
herself--"
</p><p>The bell of the vestibule door rang, three rings in quick succession,
followed by two isolated rings.
</p><p>"It is she," said Lupin. "Monsieur Detinan, if you will be so kind--"
</p><p>The lawyer hastened to the door.
</p><p>Two young women entered. One of them threw herself into the arms of Mon.
Gerbois. The other approached Lupin. The latter was a tall woman of a
good figure, very pale complexion, and with blond hair, parted over her
forehead in undulating waves, that glistened and shone like the setting
sun. She was dressed in black, with no display of jewelled ornaments;
but, on the contrary, her appearance indicated good taste and refined
elegance. Arsène Lupin spoke a few words to her; then, bowing to Mlle.
Gerbois, he said:
</p><p>"I owe you an apology, mademoiselle, for all your troubles, but I hope
you have not been too unhappy--"
</p><p>"Unhappy! Why, I should have been very happy, indeed, if it hadn't been
for leaving my poor father."
</p><p>"Then all is for the best. Kiss him again, and take advantage of the
opportunity--it is an excellent one--to speak to him about your cousin."
</p><p>"My cousin! What do you mean? I don't understand."
</p><p>"Of course, you understand. Your cousin Philippe. The young man whose
letters you kept so carefully."
</p><p>Suzanne blushed; but, following Lupin's advice, she again threw herself
into her father's arms. Lupin gazed upon them with a tender look.
</p><p>"Ah! Such is my reward for a virtuous act! What a touching picture! A
happy father and a happy daughter! And to know that their joy is your
work, Lupin! Hereafter these people will bless you, and reverently
transmit your name unto their descendants, even unto the fourth
generation. What a glorious reward, Lupin, for one act of kindness!"
</p><p>He walked to the window.
</p><p>"Is dear old Ganimard still waiting?... He would like very much to be
present at this charming domestic scene!... Ah! he is not there.... Nor
any of the others.... I don't see anyone. The deuce! The situation is
becoming serious. I dare say they are already under the porte-cochere
... talking to the concierge, perhaps ... or, even, ascending the
stairs!"
</p><p>Mon. Gerbois made a sudden movement. Now, that his daughter had been
restored to him, he saw the situation in a different light. To him, the
arrest of his adversary meant half-a-million francs. Instinctively, he
made a step forward. As if by chance, Lupin stood in his way.
</p><p>"Where are you going, Monsieur Gerbois? To defend me against them! That
is very kind of you, but I assure you it is not necessary. They are more
worried than I."
</p><p>Then he continued to speak, with calm deliberation:
</p><p>"But, really, what do they know? That you are here, and, perhaps, that
Mlle. Gerbois is here, for they may have seen her arrive with an unknown
lady. But they do not imagine that I am here. How is it possible that I
could be in a house that they ran-sacked from cellar to garret this
morning? They suppose that the unknown lady was sent by me to make the
exchange, and they will be ready to arrest her when she goes out--"
</p><p>At that moment, the bell rang. With a brusque movement, Lupin seized
Mon. Gerbois, and said to him, in an imperious tone:
</p><p>"Do not move! Remember your daughter, and be prudent--otherwise--As to
you, Monsieur Detinan, I have your promise."
</p><p>Mon. Gerbois was rooted to the spot. The lawyer did not stir. Without
the least sign of haste, Lupin picked up his hat and brushed the dust
from off it with his sleeve.
</p><p>"My dear Monsieur Detinan, if I can ever be of service to you.... My
best wishes, Mademoiselle Suzanne, and my kind regards to Monsieur
Philippe."
</p><p>He drew a heavy gold watch from his pocket.
</p><p>"Monsieur Gerbois, it is now forty-two minutes past three. At forty-six
minutes past three, I give you permission to leave this room. Not one
minute sooner than forty-six minutes past three."
</p><p>"But they will force an entrance," suggested Mon. Detinan.
</p><p>"You forget the law, my dear monsieur! Ganimard would never venture to
violate the privacy of a French citizen. But, pardon me, time flies, and
you are all slightly nervous."
</p><p>He placed his watch on the table, opened the door of the room and
addressing the blonde lady he said:
</p><p>"Are you ready my dear?"
</p><p>He drew back to let her pass, bowed respectfully to Mlle. Gerbois, and
went out, closing the door behind him. Then they heard him in the
vestibule, speaking, in a loud voice: "Good-day, Ganimard, how goes it?
Remember me to Madame Ganimard. One of these days, I shall invite her to
breakfast. Au revoir, Ganimard."
</p><p>The bell rang violently, followed by repeated rings, and voices on the
landing.
</p><p>"Forty-five minutes," muttered Mon. Gerbois.
</p><p>After a few seconds, he left the room and stepped into the vestibule.
Arsène Lupin and the blonde lady had gone.
</p><p>"Papa!... you mustn't! Wait!" cried Suzanne.
</p><p>"Wait! you are foolish!... No quarter for that rascal!... And the
half-million?"
</p><p>He opened the outer door. Ganimard rushed in.
</p><p>"That woman--where is she? And Lupin?"
</p><p>"He was here ... he is here."
</p><p>Ganimard uttered a cry of triumph.
</p><p>"We have him. The house is surrounded."
</p><p>"But the servant's stairway?" suggested Mon. Detinan.
</p><p>"It leads to the court," said Ganimard. "There is only one exit--the
street-door. Ten men are guarding it."
</p><p>"But he didn't come in by the street-door, and he will not go out that
way."
</p><p>"What way, then?" asked Ganimard. "Through the air?"
</p><p>He drew aside a curtain and exposed a long corridor leading to the
kitchen. Ganimard ran along it and tried the door of the servants'
stairway. It was locked. From the window he called to one of his
assistants:
</p><p>"Seen anyone?"
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"Then they are still in the house!" he exclaimed. "They are hiding in
one of the rooms! They cannot have escaped. Ah! Lupin, you fooled me
before, but, this time, I get my revenge."
</p><hr/>
<p>At seven o'clock in the evening, Mon. Dudonis, chief of the detective
service, astonished at not receiving any news, visited the rue
Clapeyron. He questioned the detectives who were guarding the house,
then ascended to Mon. Detinan's apartment. The lawyer led him into his
room. There, Mon. Dudonis beheld a man, or rather two legs kicking in
the air, while the body to which they belonged was hidden in the depths
of the chimney.
</p><p>"Ohé!... Ohé!" gasped a stifled voice. And a more distant voice, from on
high, replied:
</p><p>"Ohé!... Ohé!"
</p><p>Mon. Dudonis laughed, and exclaimed:
</p><p>"Here! Ganimard, have you turned chimney-sweep?"
</p><p>The detective crawled out of the chimney. With his blackened face, his
sooty clothes, and his feverish eyes, he was quite unrecognizable.
</p><p>"I am looking for <u>him</u>," he growled.
</p><p>"Who?"
</p><p>"Arsène Lupin ... and his friend."
</p><p>"Well, do you suppose they are hiding in the chimney?"
</p><p>Ganimard arose, laid his sooty hand on the sleeve of his superior
officer's coat, and exclaimed, angrily:
</p><p>"Where do you think they are, chief? They must be somewhere! They are
flesh and blood like you and me, and can't fade away like smoke."
</p><p>"No, but they have faded away just the same."
</p><p>"But how? How? The house is surrounded by our men--even on the roof."
</p><p>"What about the adjoining house?"
</p><p>"There's no communication with it."
</p><p>"And the apartments on the other floors?"
</p><p>"I know all the tenants. They have not seen anyone."
</p><p>"Are you sure you know all of them?"
</p><p>"Yes. The concierge answers for them. Besides, as an extra precaution, I
have placed a man in each apartment. They can't escape. If I don't get
them to-night, I will get them to-morrow. I shall sleep here."
</p><p>He slept there that night and the two following nights. Three days and
nights passed away without the discovery of the irrepressible Lupin or
his female companion; more than that, Ganimard did not unearth the
slightest clue on which to base a theory to explain their escape. For
that reason, he adhered to his first opinion.
</p><p>"There is no trace of their escape; therefore, they are here."
</p><p>It may be that, at the bottom of his heart, his conviction was less
firmly established, but he would not confess it. No, a thousand times,
no! A man and a woman could not vanish like the evil spirits in a fairy
tale. And, without losing his courage, he continued his searches, as if
he expected to find the fugitives concealed in some impenetrable
retreat, or embodied in the stone walls of the house.
