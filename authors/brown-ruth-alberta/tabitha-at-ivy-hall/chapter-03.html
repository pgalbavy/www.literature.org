<p>"What's your name?"</p>

<p>Tabitha wheeled with a start, lost her balance, and toppled off
the great rock to the hard ground, where she lay staring up at
the fair-haired stranger bending over her with anxiety and alarm
filling the pretty blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" inquired the soft voice. "I didn't mean to make
you jump. I'm lonesome and when you moved in the nearest house
to ours I was glad to think there was another girl about my size,
for maybe you will play with me. Will you?"</p>

<p>Still Tabitha made no reply, but lay as she had fallen, not daring
to trust her ears or believe her eyes&mdash;it was not unusual for
anyone to make friendly advances toward her, though she had longed
all her lonely little life for a playmate. Why, it couldn't be
possible! They were on the desert now in a forlorn little mining
town located in a hollow between two mountain ranges and straggling
over a vast area of barren, rocky hills, with not a tree in sight
anywhere, except the ugly, uncompromising yuccas, and they could
scarcely be dignified by the name of trees. Nothing but sagebrush,
greasewood, mesquite and cactus; not even a sprill of grass!</p>

<p>To poor homesick Tabitha it seemed as if they had dropped off
the earth into nowhere. She had never seen such a place in all
her life, nor even dreamed that towns like that existed. Wherever
they had gone heretofore, there had always been trees and flowers,
which in a measure took the place of the friends she had never
known but always missed. Now there was not even to be this solace;
how could there be any friends?</p>

<p>So she remained silent and the little blue-eyed girl was puzzled,
almost frightened. Then a bright idea came to her.</p>

<p>"Are you an Indian?" she asked timidly, wondering if she had
better run, supposing the black-eyed child should prove to be
the daughter of a redman.</p>

<p>"No, I ain't an Indian!" Tabitha bounced on the ground with a
startling suddenness that froze the other child in her tracks.</p>

<p>Poor Tabitha! Tormented ever since she could remember because
of her unfortunate name, and now to be called an Indian! She had
sprung to her feet with fists clenched and eyes blazing, yet somehow
she seemed to understand that this plump little body was different
from the teasing children who had made the days miserable for
her wherever she went, and she could not strike the avenging blow.
But the insult, unintentional as it evidently was, rankled bitterly
nevertheless; and dropping to the ground again, she hid her face
in her faded skirts.</p>

<p>Instantly two soft arms slipped around her and she heard the
gentle voice saying sorrowfully, "Oh, please don't cry, little
girl! I didn't mean to make you mad. Of course you aren't an Indian,
'cause your hair curls some, and Indians have awful straight,
stiff hair, and they are redder than you are. I guess you've lived
on the desert until you are real brown."</p>

<p>"I never lived on the desert before, and I hate it, hate it,
hate it! Almost as bad as I do Dad! I ain't crying, and I ain't
mad&mdash;at you." Tabitha lifted her head and the other child saw
two very bright, black, beautiful eyes in the thin tanned face,
but the tears she expected to see were not there.</p>

<p>They sat and stared at each other in silence a moment and then
the strange girl said, "My name is Carrie Carson. What's yours?"</p>

<p>"Theodora Marcella Gabrielle Julianna Victoria Emeline Catt."</p>

<p>Carrie gasped. So did Tabitha, but for a different reason. Carrie
was amazed at the length of the name and the ease with which its
owner spoke it. Tabitha was astonished to think the idea of dropping
her own obnoxious name and adopting a new one had never occurred
to her before. No thought of deception ever entered her mind;
she merely hated "Tabitha" with all the strength of her passionate
nature; she had found a name that filled her with delight; she
had adopted it at first in play, but it had become very real to
her, and now as she spoke the words that were so beautiful to
her, it seemed as if they belonged to her.</p>

<p>"How do you ever remember them all?" asked Carrie. "Must people
use that whole long name when they speak to you?"</p>

<p>"Not unless they want to," answered Tabitha with restored composure.
"Theodora Gabrielle is enough."</p>

<p>"Well, Theodora Gabrielle, have you got any sisters?"</p>

<p>"No, only one brother, To&mdash; Dionysius Ulysses Humphrey Llewelyn."</p>

<p>"My! what long names you do have in your family! Will you say
it again, please? I couldn't quite make it out."</p>

<p>So Tabitha repeated the words slowly, adding, "<em>I</em> always
call him all of them, but he would just as soon folks would call
him Ulysses. He was named after General Grant who fought in the
Civil War. To&mdash; Dionysius Ulysses Humphrey Llewelyn taught me
how to read, 'cause we move so much that sometimes we miss a lot
of school, and I've gone clear through the United States history.
Have you?"</p>

<p>"Mercy, no!" ejaculated Carrie in astonishment. "I'm not through
with geography yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't s'pose I am, either, but we have three histories
and no geographies at our house, so I couldn't read up geography.
To&mdash; Dionysius Ulysses Humphrey Llewelyn explains when I don't
understand, and he draws maps to show how the battles were fought.
We learn poetry about fights, too. To&mdash; my brother is going to
be a soldier when he gets big."</p>

<p>The name with which she had so generously supplied her brother
was becoming very hard to manage, and she sat silently eyeing
her bare feet while she tried in vain to think of some way out
of the dilemma. She had told Carrie that she always called her
brother his full name. What could she do but prove it?</p>

<p>Carrie's voice interrupted her meditations. "Don't you hate to
speak before people &mdash;I mean, speak pieces? It always scares
me so I forget half of my verses and then papa is so disappointed.
Mamma always says, 'Never mind, dearie,</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
'If at first you don't succeed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try, try again.'

</p>
</div>
<p>So I keep on trying and maybe some day I can remember them all
right."</p>

<p>"Oh, I just love to speak!" Tabitha cried. "I've just learned
<em>Barbara Fritchie</em>, and it is <em>grand</em>!</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'who touches a hair in yon gray head<br/>
&nbsp;Dies like a dog! March on!' he said."

</p>
</div>
<p>Carrie clapped her hands. "Oh, say the whole of it, Theodora
Gabrielle, please!"</p>

<p>So Tabitha flew to the top of the rock from which she had been
surveying the waste of desert when Carrie had first put in appearance,
and with ringing voice declaimed the stirring words to her admiring
audience.</p>

<p>That was the beginning of the first real friendship poor Tabitha
had ever known, and the world that opened before her was a beautiful
fairyland. The Carson home was so unlike her own that unconsciously
she held her breath whenever she entered the big house where the
superintendent of the Silver Legion Mines lived, fearing that
she might wake up and find it after all only a dream&mdash;the sweet-faced
mother who kissed little Carrie every day, the smiling, genial
father who always had some pretty gift in his pocket for his only
child, the dainty furnishings of the big house which seemed so
gorgeously splendid to the neglected girl, and particularly the
wonderful toys and story-books that belonged to the flaxen-haired
fairy who opened the door of this wonderland for her to enter.</p>

<p>Having never known a mother's love herself, Tabitha regarded
dainty Mrs. Carson with a feeling of awe which deepened into worship
as the acquaintance progressed, but proved to be a great barrier
between them for a long time. She spoke of her in a hushed voice,
treasured every smile as if it had been some precious gem, and
hungered for the caresses so freely bestowed upon little Carrie,
but feared to approach near enough this beautiful goddess to receive
them herself.</p>

<p>Mr. Carson she could understand better. He was another Tom grown
up, only where Tom was silent and shy, this man was jolly and
friendly. He laughed a great deal, said funny things, never teased
little girls except in a playful way that made one like to meet
him, and was always very, very kind. She never heard him say a
cross word to anyone, and once when she asked Carrie if he ever
got mad and punished her, the blue-eyed girl was very indignant.</p>

<p>"My papa is <em>never</em> mad," she stoutly declared. "When
I do naughty things, he just looks so disappointed and says, 'I
am so sorry,' in such a way that it makes me sorry, too."</p>

<p>To Tabitha this seemed a very queer way for a father to act,
but for big brother Tom it was perfectly natural; so in her scale
of relationship, Mr. Carson slipped down a peg and became a brother,
bringing him much closer to her than he would otherwise have been,
and making his influence over her much greater.</p>

<p>At first the Carsons did not much favor the friendship that had
sprung up between the two girls, for Tabitha seemed so wild and
passionate they feared her association with their little daughter
might not be for the best; but by chance the superintendent met
Tom one day in the surveyor's office, where the boy had found
employment running errands and doing other odd jobs, and he was
delighted with the unusual intelligence of the lad, as well as
with the ambition Tom had for an education.</p>

<p>Like Tabitha, Tom craved fellowship with understanding people,
and his appreciation of real kindness was as touching as it was
keen. Mr. Carson made inquiry concerning the boy, learned the
unfortunate circumstances of his starved life, and became his
fast friend. So the two girls were allowed to play together unrestricted,
each helping the other unconsciously in the building of character,
&mdash;Carrie being taught reliance and self-confidence, while
Tabitha was learning to subdue the fierceness of her untamed nature
and to overcome her extreme sensitiveness.</p>

<p>Though Mr. Carson knew the truth about the unhappy names of brother
and sister, he never so much as smiled, nor did he betray Tabitha's
secret; and while he never called Tom by the name she thought
so grand, he always addressed her as Theodora Gabrielle; and she
was happy.</p>

<p>So for many precious weeks the world looked very bright to the
black-eyed girl. The father was miles away most of the time, prospecting
among the mountains; Aunt Maria seldom called her anything but
Child; Tom's pet name, when he forgot her grand title, was Puss;
and she began to think the hateful Tabitha was forever laid aside
and forgotten.</p>

<p>The dreariness of the desert which had so oppressed her when
they first arrived in Silver Bow slipped from her; she forgot
the lack of trees and grass; the yuccas and Spanish bayonets lost
their grimness; she grew to like the queer place with its queer
vegetation; and the sunrises and sunsets were a source of intense
delight to her, as they are to many another soul&mdash;for where in
all the world are there such beautiful cloud pictures as on the
desert with the mountains beyond, mysterious and wonderful in
their purple haze or in the glistening white of the snow?</p>

<p>The Catts arrived at Silver Bow only a few weeks before school
began, and owing to the fact that the cottage they had rented
stood half hidden from the rest of the town by one of the many
hills, with only the Carson house and a vacant bungalow for neighbors,
Tabitha made the acquaintance of none of the other children in
town until the commencement of the fall term. Usually this was
an event to be dreaded by the sensitive girl, but it was with
a feeling almost of pleasure that Tabitha accompanied pretty Carrie
to the old weather-beaten schoolhouse of the mining camp the first
Monday of September for the opening session.</p>

<p>Tom was too far advanced for the branches taught in the little
school, so he was to remain with the surveyor and study in the
evening under Mr. Carson's direction; but he knew from former
experience what a scene Tabitha usually created before she could
be persuaded to begin school each year, and dreaded the ordeal
almost as much as did the passionate little sister.</p>

<p>Tabitha had confessed to Tom that Carrie called her by the wonderful
name, Theodora Gabrielle, but he thought it was just in play and
rejoiced that the superintendent's charming little daughter was
so friendly and kind. He was unusually busy with his own thoughts
and plans, for Mr. Carson had laid out a course of study for him
by which he might prepare himself for college, the goal of his
ambitions; and the world was looking very bright to him as well
as to Tabitha, so perhaps he was excusable if he day-dreamed a
little. But he never forgave himself for relaxing his vigilance
over the small sister even in this slight measure, for it cost
her many hours of bitter anguish. If only he had inquired about
the name Tabitha had adopted, and discovered how real it had become!
But intent upon his own thoughts, he missed this part of Tabitha's
confession, and watched her set out for school hand in hand with
Carrie, serene in the belief that all was well, and happy at her
unexpected behavior in regard to school.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm beat!" Aunt Maria exclaimed as the two girls skipped
joyously up the path and disappeared over the summit of the hill.
"I thought sure she'd raise a fuss, but she never said a word."</p>

<p>"She is so wrapped up in Carrie that she has forgotten all about
her name," answered Tom in his ignorance.</p>

<p>The aunt sighed, "Well, it's a shame she has to answer to it
when she despises it so; though I can't see that it is much worse
than Maria. I never paid much attention to my name that I remember.
But if I'd had my way about it, I should have called you Peter
Augustus, and her Aurora Isadena," (she pronounced them "A-roo-rie
Isi-deen-ie") "but your pa had different notions. Said he'd suffered
torment all his days being called Manx Cat and he was going to
get even with folks for once; though I can't see how naming innocent
children such names would help him any in his grouch against the
world."</p>

<p>Neither could Tom, but it was seldom that Aunt Maria volunteered
any information of this sort, and he made the most of his opportunity
by asking, "Is Dad's other name Lynne?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but the boys plagued him when he was little calling him
'lean cat,' so he took to going by his middle name, Maximilian,
but folks nicknamed that, too, and he got sulky." Then as if fearing
she had said too much, she added, "That assaying man will be looking
for you if you don't get up to the office pretty quick."</p>

<p>So though Tom had any quantity of questions he wanted to ask,
he put on his cap and left the house. The school-bell was ringing
its final summons when he reached the top of the hill, and he
paused to look down the steep slope into the yard where the children
were marching in double file into the building, smiling as he
saw Tabitha's long, lean legs keeping step behind the short, plump
ones of little Carrie, and mentally hoping that the day would
go well with the little spitfire sister.</p>

<p>It did. A bright-faced woman stood at her desk and received the
children as they entered, shook hands with them and gave them
their seats, smiling all the while until Tabitha thought she had
never seen anyone so pretty, except Mrs. Carson.</p>

<p>"Now children, my name is Miss Brooks," the new teacher began
with an important air which would have told an older observer
that this was her first experience in teaching. "I shall expect
you always to address me in that manner. If I ask you a question,
you must say, 'Yes, Miss Brooks,' or 'No, Miss Brooks,' for that
is polite. Now, the first thing I intend to do this morning is
to take down your names and get you classified. This little girl
in the front seat of the outside row, what is your name?"</p>

<p>"Theodora Marcella Gabrielle Julianna Victoria Emeline Catt,
Miss Brooks." Tabitha responded in one breath without a break,
her voice ringing clearly through the silence of the room, for
everyone was craning to see the new scholar and listening to catch
her name.</p>

<p>The teacher gasped, the children tittered, and Tabitha crimsoned
angrily, but before she had even time to clench the little fists
that were accustomed to fight her battles, Carrie saved the day.
"That's her whole name, Miss Brooks, but we call her just Theodora
Gabrielle. She is a lovely speaker."</p>

<p>The flush of annoyance on the teacher's face died instantly,
and she smiled down into the beautiful eyes of the child before
her as she said, "That is a very pretty name, I am sure. Now tell
me where you are in your studies."</p>

<p>An answering smile came to Tabitha's face, and she replied with
more confidence, "I've finished United States history, which is
grand, 'specially Grant; I've reached Europe in geography, which
isn't bad; I've got to 'emotion' in language, which is horrid;
and in 'rithmetic I am stuck in decimal fractions, which is the
worst yet. My brother, Dionysius Ulysses Humphrey Llewelyn, taught
me history when he was studying it. I hain't had it in school
yet."</p>

<p>This time the scholars as well as the teacher were silent in
astonishment, but no one laughed; and seeing the surprised faces
all around her, Tabitha again assumed a belligerent attitude,
thinking they did not believe her.</p>

<p>"Well, that's so," she exclaimed defiantly, glaring at the strange
children.</p>

<p>"Yes," added Carrie, "and she has read through the Fourth Reader
and knows lots of pieces. You ought to hear her speak <em>Barbara
Fritchie</em>."</p>

<p>"But I'm an awful speller," admitted the mollified Tabitha.</p>

<p>At this the teacher smiled again, and laying her hand on the
black head she said, "You are a little girl to be so far along
in your lessons. I am afraid I can't classify you just now. We
will have to wait until I get the other girls and boys arranged
according to studies, and then we will see where to put you. Now,
children, I hope you will follow Theodora Gabrielle's example
and study hard."</p>

<p>"Teacher's pet," whispered the boy across the aisle, but Tabitha
was soaring in the realms of bliss and the teacher's smile, so
she did not hear or care what the others might say. The world
was growing very bright and she was finding how sweet the days
could be.</p>
