<P>
It was late September when Anne and Gilbert were able
to pay Four Winds light their promised visit.  They had
often planned to go, but something always occurred to
prevent them.  Captain Jim had "dropped in" several
times at the little house.
<P>
"I don't stand on ceremony, Mistress Blythe," he told
Anne.  "It's a real pleasure to me to come here, and
I'm not going to deny myself jest because you haven't
got down to see me.  There oughtn't to be no
bargaining like that among the race that knows Joseph. 
I'll come when I can, and you come when you can, and so
long's we have our pleasant little chat it don't matter
a mite what roof's over us."
<P>
Captain Jim took a great fancy to Gog and Magog, who
were presiding over the destinies of the hearth in the
little house with as much dignity and aplomb as they
had done at Patty's Place.
<P>
"Aren't they the cutest little cusses?" he would say
delightedly; and he bade them greeting and farewell as
gravely and invariably as he did his host and hostess. 
Captain Jim was not going to offend household deities
by any lack of reverence and ceremony.
<P>
"You've made this little house just about perfect," he
told Anne.  "It never was so nice before.  Mistress
Selwyn had your taste and she did wonders; but folks in
those days didn't have the pretty little curtains and
pictures and nicknacks you have.  As for Elizabeth, she
lived in the past.  You've kinder brought the future
into it, so to speak.  I'd be real happy even if we
couldn't talk at all, when I come here--jest to sit and
look at you and your pictures and your flowers would be
enough of a treat.  It's beautiful--beautiful."
<P>
Captain Jim was a passionate worshipper of beauty. 
Every lovely thing heard or seen gave him a deep,
subtle, inner joy that irradiated his life.  He was
quite keenly aware of his own lack of outward
comeliness and lamented it.
<P>
"Folks say I'm good," he remarked whimsically upon one
occasion, "but I sometimes wish the Lord had made me
only half as good and put the rest of it into looks. 
But there, I reckon He knew what He was about, as a
good Captain should.  Some of us have to be homely, or
the purty ones--like Mistress Blythe here--wouldn't
show up so well."
<P>
One evening Anne and Gilbert finally walked down to the
Four Winds light.  The day had begun sombrely in gray
cloud and mist, but it had ended in a pomp of scarlet
and gold.  Over the western hills beyond the harbor
were amber deeps and crystalline shallows, with the
fire of sunset below.  The north was a mackerel sky of
little, fiery golden clouds.  The red light flamed on
the white sails of a vessel gliding down the channel,
bound to a southern port in a land of palms.  Beyond
her, it smote upon and incarnadined the shining, white,
grassless faces of the sand dunes.  To the right, it
fell on the old house among the willows up the brook,
and gave it for a fleeting space casements more
splendid than those of an old cathedral.  They glowed
out of its quiet and grayness like the throbbing,
blood-red thoughts of a vivid soul imprisoned in a dull
husk of environment.
<P>
"That old house up the brook always seems so lonely,"
said Anne.  "I never see visitors there.  Of course,
its lane opens on the upper road--but I don't think
there's much coming and going.  It seems odd we've
never met the Moores yet, when they live within fifteen
minutes' walk of us.  I may have seen them in church,
of course, but if so I didn't know them.  I'm sorry
they are so unsociable, when they are our only near
neighbors."
<P>
"Evidently they don't belong to the race that knows
Joseph," laughed Gilbert.  "Have you ever found out
who that girl was whom you thought so beautiful?"
<P>
"No.  Somehow I have never remembered to ask about her. 
But I've never seen her anywhere, so I suppose she must
have been a stranger.  Oh, the sun has just
vanished--and there's the light."
<P>
As the dusk deepened, the great beacon cut swathes of
light through it, sweeping in a circle over the fields
and the harbor, the sandbar and the gulf.
<P>
"I feel as if it might catch me and whisk me leagues
out to sea," said Anne, as one drenched them with
radiance; and she felt rather relieved when they got so
near the Point that they were inside the range of those
dazzling, recurrent flashes.
<P>
As they turned into the little lane that led across the
fields to the Point they met a man coming out of it--a
man of such extraordinary appearance that for a moment
they both frankly stared.  He was a decidedly
fine-looking person-tall, broad-shouldered, well-
featured, with a Roman nose and frank gray eyes; he was
dressed in a prosperous farmer's Sunday best; in so far
he might have been any inhabitant of Four Winds or the
Glen.  But, flowing over his breast nearly to his
knees, was a river of crinkly brown beard; and adown
his back, beneath his commonplace felt hat, was a
corresponding cascade of thick, wavy, brown hair.
<P>
"Anne," murmured Gilbert, when they were out of
earshot, "you didn't put what Uncle Dave calls `a
little of the Scott Act' in that lemonade you gave me
just before we left home, did you?"
<P>
"No, I didn't," said Anne, stifling her laughter, lest
the retreating enigma should hear here.  "Who in the
world can he be?"
<P>
"I don't know; but if Captain Jim keeps apparitions
like that down at this Point I'm going to carry cold
iron in my pocket when I come here.  He wasn't a
sailor, or one might pardon his eccentricity of
appearance; he must belong to the over-harbor clans. 
Uncle Dave says they have several freaks over there."
<P>
"Uncle Dave is a little prejudiced, I think.  You know
all the over-harbor people who come to the Glen Church
seem very nice.  Oh, Gilbert, isn't this beautiful?"
<P>
The Four Winds light was built on a spur of red
sand-stone cliff jutting out into the gulf.  On one
side, across the channel, stretched the silvery sand
shore of the bar; on the other, extended a long,
curving beach of red cliffs, rising steeply from the
pebbled coves.  It was a shore that knew the magic and
mystery of storm and star.  There is a great solitude
about such a shore.  The woods are never solitary--
they are full of whispering, beckoning, friendly life. 
But the sea is a mighty soul, forever moaning of some
great, unshareable sorrow, which shuts it up into
itself for all eternity.  We can never pierce its
infinite mystery--we may only wander, awed and
spellbound, on the outer fringe of it.  The woods call
to us with a hundred voices, but the sea has one
only--a mighty voice that drowns our souls in its
majestic music.  The woods are human, but the sea is of
the company of the archangels.
<P>
Anne and Gilbert found Uncle Jim sitting on a bench
outside the lighthouse, putting the finishing touches
to a wonderful, full-rigged, toy schooner.  He rose and
welcomed them to his abode with the gentle,
unconscious courtesy that became him so well.
<P>
"This has been a purty nice day all through, Mistress
Blythe, and now, right at the last, it's brought its
best.  Would you like to sit down here outside a bit,
while the light lasts?  I've just finished this bit of
a plaything for my little grand nephew, Joe, up at the
Glen.  After I promised to make it for him I was kinder
sorry, for his mother was vexed.  She's afraid he'll be
wanting to go to sea later on and she doesn't want the
notion encouraged in him.  But what could I do,
Mistress Blythe?  I'd PROMISED him, and I think it's
sorter real dastardly to break a promise you make to a
child.  Come, sit down.  It won't take long to stay an
hour."
<P>
The wind was off shore, and only broke the sea's
surface into long, silvery ripples, and sent sheeny
shadows flying out across it, from every point and
headland, like transparent wings.  The dusk was
hanging a curtain of violet gloom over the sand dunes
and the headlands where gulls were huddling.  The sky
was faintly filmed over with scarfs of silken vapor. 
Cloud fleets rode at anchor along the horizons.  An
evening star was watching over the bar.
<P>
"Isn't that a view worth looking at?" said Captain
Jim, with a loving, proprietary pride.  "Nice and far
from the market-place, ain't it?  No buying and selling
and getting gain.  You don't have to pay anything--all
that sea and sky free--`without money and without
price.'  There's going to be a moonrise purty soon,
too--I'm never tired of finding out what a moonrise can
be over them rocks and sea and harbor.  There's a
surprise in it every time."
<P>
They had their moonrise, and watched its marvel and
magic in a silence that asked nothing of the world or
each other.  Then they went up into the tower, and
Captain Jim showed and explained the mechanism of the
great light.  Finally they found themselves in the
dining room, where a fire of driftwood was weaving
flames of wavering, elusive, sea-born hues in the open
fireplace.
<P>
"I put this fireplace in myself," remarked Captain
Jim.  "The Government don't give lighthouse keepers
such luxuries.  Look at the colors that wood makes.  If
you'd like some driftwood for your fire, Mistress
Blythe, I'll bring you up a load some day.  Sit down. 
I'm going to make you a cup of tea."
<P>
Captain Jim placed a chair for Anne, having first
removed therefrom a huge, orange-colored cat and a
newspaper.
<P>
"Get down, Matey.  The sofa is your place.  I must put
this paper away safe till I can find time to finish the
story in it.  It's called A Mad Love.  'Tisn't my
favorite brand of fiction, but I'm reading it jest to
see how long she can spin it out.  It's at the
sixty-second chapter now, and the wedding ain't any
nearer than when it begun, far's I can see.  When
little Joe comes I have to read him pirate yarns. 
Ain't it strange how innocent little creatures like
children like the blood-thirstiest stories?"
<P>
"Like my lad Davy at home," said Anne.  "He wants
tales that reek with gore."
<P>
Captain Jim's tea proved to be nectar.  He was pleased
as a child with Anne's compliments, but he affected a
fine indifference.
<P>
"The secret is I don't skimp the cream," he remarked
airily.  Captain Jim had never heard of Oliver Wendell
Holmes, but he evidently agreed with that writer's
dictum that "big heart never liked little cream pot."
<P>
"We met an odd-looking personage coming out of your
lane," said Gilbert as they sipped.  "Who was he?"
<P>
Captain Jim grinned.
<P>
"That's Marshall Elliott--a mighty fine man with jest
one streak of foolishness in him.  I s'pose you
wondered what his object was in turning himself into a
sort of dime museum freak."
<P>
"Is he a modern Nazarite or a Hebrew prophet left over
from olden times?" asked Anne.
<P>
"Neither of them.  It's politics that's at the bottom
of his freak.  All those Elliotts and Crawfords and
MacAllisters are dyed-in-the-wool politicians.  They're
born Grit or Tory, as the case may be, and they live
Grit or Tory, and they die Grit or Tory; and what
they're going to do in heaven, where there's probably
no politics, is more than I can fathom.  This Marshall
Elliott was born a Grit.  I'm a Grit myself in
moderation, but there's no moderation about Marshall. 
Fifteen years ago there was a specially bitter general
election.  Marshall fought for his party tooth and
nail.  He was dead sure the Liberals would win--so
sure that he got up at a public meeting and vowed that
he wouldn't shave his face or cut his hair until the
Grits were in power.  Well, they didn't go in--and
they've never got in yet--and you saw the result today
for yourselves.  Marshall stuck to his word."
<P>
"What does his wife think of it?" asked Anne.
<P>
"He's a bachelor.  But if he had a wife I reckon she
couldn't make him break that vow.  That family of
Elliotts has always been more stubborn than natteral. 
Marshall's brother Alexander had a dog he set great
store by, and when it died the man actilly wanted to
have it buried in the graveyard, `along with the other
Christians,' he said.  Course, he wasn't allowed to; so
he buried it just outside the graveyard fence, and
never darkened the church door again.  But Sundays he'd
drive his family to church and sit by that dog's grave
and read his Bible all the time service was going on. 
They say when he was dying he asked his wife to bury
him beside the dog; she was a meek little soul but she
fired up at THAT.  She said SHE wasn't going to be
buried beside no dog, and if he'd rather have his last
resting place beside the dog than beside her, jest to
say so.  Alexander Elliott was a stubborn mule, but he
was fond of his wife, so he give in and said, `Well,
durn it, bury me where you please.  But when Gabriel's
trump blows I expect my dog to rise with the rest of
us, for he had as much soul as any durned Elliott or
Crawford or MacAllister that ever strutted.'  Them was
HIS parting words.  As for Marshall, we're all used to
him, but he must strike strangers as right down
peculiar- looking.  I've known him ever since he was
ten--he's about fifty now--and I like him.  Him and me
was out cod-fishing today.  That's about all I'm good
for now--catching trout and cod occasional.  But
'tweren't always so--not by no manner of means.  I used
to do other things, as you'd admit if you saw my
life-book."
<P>
Anne was just going to ask what his life-book was when
the First Mate created a diversion by springing upon
Captain Jim's knee.  He was a gorgeous beastie, with a
face as round as a full moon, vivid green eyes, and
immense, white, double paws.  Captain Jim stroked his
velvet back gently.
<P>
"I never fancied cats much till I found the First
Mate," he remarked, to the accompaniment of the Mate's
tremendous purrs.  "I saved his life, and when you've
saved a creature's life you're bound to love it.  It's
next thing to giving life.  There's some turrible
thoughtless people in the world, Mistress Blythe.  Some
of them city folks who have summer homes over the
harbor are so thoughtless that they're cruel.  It's the
worst kind of cruelty--the thoughtless kind.  You can't
cope with it.  They keep cats there in the summer, and
feed and pet 'em, and doll 'em up with ribbons and
collars.  And then in the fall they go off and leave
'em to starve or freeze.  It makes my blood boil,
Mistress Blythe.  One day last winter I found a poor
old mother cat dead on the shore, lying against the
skin-and-bone bodies of her three little kittens. 
She'd died trying to shelter 'em.  She had her poor
stiff paws around 'em.  Master, I cried.  Then I swore. 
Then I carried them poor little kittens home and fed
'em up and found good homes for 'em.  I knew the woman
who left the cat and when she come back this summer I
jest went over the harbor and told her my opinion of
her.  It was rank meddling, but I do love meddling in a
good cause."
<P>
"How did she take it?" asked Gilbert.
<P>
"Cried and said she `didn't think.'  I says to her,
says I, `Do you s'pose that'll be held for a good
excuse in the day of Jedgment, when you'll have to
account for that poor old mother's life?  The Lord'll
ask you what He give you your brains for if it wasn't
to think, I reckon.'  I don't fancy she'll leave cats
to starve another time."
<P>
"Was the First Mate one of the forsaken?" asked Anne,
making advances to him which were responded to
graciously, if condescendingly.
<P>
"Yes.  I found HIM one bitter cold day in winter,
caught in the branches of a tree by his durn-fool
ribbon collar.  He was almost starving.  If you could
have seen his eyes, Mistress Blythe!  He was nothing
but a kitten, and he'd got his living somehow since
he'd been left until he got hung up.  When I loosed him
he gave my hand a pitiful swipe with his little red
tongue.  He wasn't the able seaman you see now.  He was
meek as Moses.  That was nine years ago.  His life has
been long in the land for a cat.  He's a good old pal,
the First Mate is."
<P>
"I should have expected you to have a dog," said
Gilbert.
<P>
Captain Jim shook his head.
<P>
"I had a dog once.  I thought so much of him that when
he died I couldn't bear the thought of getting another
in his place.  He was a FRIEND--you understand,
Mistress Blythe?  Matey's only a pal.  I'm fond of
Matey--all the fonder on account of the spice of
devilment that's in him--like there is in all cats. 
But I LOVED my dog.  I always had a sneaking sympathy
for Alexander Elliott about HIS dog.  There isn't any
devil in a good dog.  That's why they're more lovable
than cats, I reckon.  But I'm darned if they're as
interesting.  Here I am, talking too much.  Why don't
you check me?  When I do get a chance to talk to
anyone I run on turrible.  If you've done your tea I've
a few little things you might like to look at--picked
'em up in the queer corners I used to be poking my nose
into."
<P>
Captain Jim's "few little things" turned out to be a
most interesting collection of curios, hideous, quaint
and beautiful.  And almost every one had some striking
story attached to it.
<P>
Anne never forgot the delight with which she listened
to those old tales that moonlit evening by that
enchanted driftwood fire, while the silver sea called
to them through the open window and sobbed against the
rocks below them.
<P>
Captain Jim never said a boastful word, but it was
impossible to help seeing what a hero the man had
been--brave, true, resourceful, unselfish.  He sat
there in his little room and made those things live
again for his hearers.  By a lift of the eyebrow, a
twist of the lip, a gesture, a word, he painted a whole
scene or character so that they saw it as it was.
<P>
Some of Captain Jim's adventures had such a marvellous
edge that Anne and Gilbert secretly wondered if he were
not drawing a rather long bow at their credulous
expense.  But in this, as they found later, they did
him injustice.  His tales were all literally true. 
Captain Jim had the gift of the born storyteller,
whereby "unhappy, far-off things" can be brought
vividly before the hearer in all their pristine
poignancy.
<P>
Anne and Gilbert laughed and shivered over his tales,
and once Anne found herself crying.  Captain Jim
surveyed her tears with pleasure shining from his face.
<P>
"I like to see folks cry that way," he remarked. 
"It's a compliment.  But I can't do justice to the
things I've seen or helped to do.  I've 'em all jotted
down in my life-book, but I haven't got the knack of
writing them out properly.  If I could hit on jest the
right words and string 'em together proper on paper I
could make a great book.  It would beat A Mad Love
holler, and I believe Joe'd like it as well as the
pirate yarns.  Yes, I've had some adventures in my
time; and, do you know, Mistress Blythe, I still lust
after 'em.  Yes, old and useless as I be, there's an
awful longing sweeps over me at times to sail
out--out--out there--forever and ever."
<P>
"Like Ulysses, you would
<P>
    `Sail beyond the sunset and the baths     Of all
the western stars until you die,'"
<P>
said Anne dreamily.
<P>
"Ulysses?  I've read of him.  Yes, that's just how I
feel--jest how all us old sailors feel, I reckon.  I'll
die on land after all, I s'pose.  Well, what is to be
will be.  There was old William Ford at the Glen who
never went on the water in his life, 'cause he was
afraid of being drowned.  A fortune-teller had
predicted he would be.  And one day he fainted and fell
with his face in the barn trough and was drowned.  Must
you go?  Well, come soon and come often.  The doctor is
to do the talking next time.  He knows a heap of things
I want to find out.  I'm sorter lonesome here by times. 
It's been worse since Elizabeth Russell died.  Her and
me was such cronies."
<P>
Captain Jim spoke with the pathos of the aged, who see
their old friends slipping from them one by
one--friends whose place can never be quite filled by
those of a younger generation, even of the race that
knows Joseph.  Anne and Gilbert promised to come soon
and often.
<P>
"He's a rare old fellow, isn't he?" said Gilbert, as
they walked home.
<P>
"Somehow, I can't reconcile his simple, kindly
personality with the wild, adventurous life he has
lived," mused Anne.
<P>
"You wouldn't find it so hard if you had seen him the
other day down at the fishing village.  One of the men
of Peter Gautier's boat made a nasty remark about some
girl along the shore.  Captain Jim fairly scorched the
wretched fellow with the lightning of his eyes.  He
seemed a man transformed.  He didn't say much--but the
way he said it!  You'd have thought it would strip the
flesh from the fellow's bones.  I understand that
Captain Jim will never allow a word against any woman
to be said in his presence."
<P>
"I wonder why he never married," said Anne.  "He
should have sons with their ships at sea now, and
grandchildren climbing over him to hear his
stories--he's that kind of a man.  Instead, he has
nothing but a magnificent cat."
<P>
But Anne was mistaken.  Captain Jim had more than that. 
He had a memory.
