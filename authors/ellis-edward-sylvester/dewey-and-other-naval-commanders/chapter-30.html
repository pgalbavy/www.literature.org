<p>The Movement Against Cuba&mdash;The Destruction of Cervera's Fleet
&mdash;Admiral Sampson&mdash;Admiral Schley&mdash;"Fighting Bob" Evans &mdash;Commodore
John C. Watson&mdash;Commodore John W. Philip &mdash;Lieutenant Commander
Richard Wainwright.</p>

<p>Since the war with Spain was undertaken for the liberation of
Cuba from the most frightful atrocities that mind can conceive,
it was natural that the chief attention of our Government should
be directed to the expulsion of the Spaniards from that island.
Neither the Ladrones nor Philippines entered into the question;
but, inasmuch as they were valuable possessions of Spain, their
conquest was a natural and effective blow against the nation with
which we were at war.</p>

<p>In view of what subsequently occurred, we can smile at the general
uneasiness and fear which prevailed in this country at the opening
of hostilities regarding the fleets of Spain. She was known to
have a formidable navy and a great many believed it was superior
to our own. There was no telling where it would strike the first
blow. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington and other seaboard
cities made powerful preparations against the dread fleet, which
in truth was no more to be feared than the ferryboats on the North
River, and yet but for the preparations referred to it is more
than probable we should have suffered.</p>

<p>The most formidable fleet was under the command of Admiral Cervera.
Our own squadrons were engaged for weeks in hunting for it, and
it was reported in a dozen different places. Finally it was learned
that it had taken refuge in the harbor of Santiago, the city of
that name being besieged by the land forces under General Shafter.
Immediately the American fleet of Admiral Sampson blockaded the
ships of the enemy, determined to hold it powerless inside the
broad harbor, for it followed, as a matter of course, that so
long as it was bottled up there it could do nothing to help Spain.</p>

<p>No one could know his weakness better than the Spanish Admiral.
He had fine ships and fine guns, but his crews were undisciplined.
They were wretched marksmen and in no respect to be compared with
our gunners, who demonstrated in the War of 1812 that they have
no equals in the whole world. Knowing all this, Admiral Cervera
was loth to venture out of the harbor of Santiago, and the days
and weeks passed in idleness while the monotonous blockade continued.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>ADMIRAL CERVERA</em>.]</p>

<p>It was the fear that the Spanish ships would make a dash on some
dark, stormy night and escape that led to one of the most striking
and brilliant exploits of the war. That is the sinking of the
collier <em>Merrimac</em> in the channel of the harbor by Lieutenant
Richmond Pearson Hobson, on the night of June 3. That the effort
was not wholly successful does not detract from the glory of the
brave men who went unflinchingly to what looked like almost certain
death.</p>

<p>The companions of Lieutenant Hobson in this remarkable achievement
were Osborn Deignan, George F. Phillips, Francis Kelly, George
Charette, Daniel Montague, <em>J.C. </em>Murphy and Randolph Clausen.
The last named was not one of the original six chosen, but he
had been at work on the <em>Merrimac</em> preparing her for the
attempt and hid himself away on the lumbersome craft and they
were obliged to take him.</p>

<p>As soon as the Spaniards discovered the approach of the <em>Merrimac</em>,
in the darkness, they opened upon her with their batteries from
both shores, and she was subjected to a fire which it would seem
must riddle her like a sieve and kill every man. But under the
direction of the cool-headed and daring Lieutenant the collier
was swung into the right position, and, but for the shooting away
of the rudder, would have been sunk directly across the channel,
which would have been effectively blocked. The position of the
wreck as a consequence was diagonal and left the passage partly
open.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>LIEUTENANT RICHMOND PEARSON HOBSON</em>.]</p>

<p>Having accomplished as nearly as possible the perilous task the
brave party were obliged to remain clinging to a raft until morning,
when the Spaniards discovered and made them prisoners. Admiral
Cervera himself helped to take Hobson out of the water and was
so filled with admiration of the extraordinary daring of himself
and companions that he sent a flag of truce to Admiral Sampson
with the welcome news that all the men were safe in his hands.
They were confined first in Morro Castle and later in the city
of Santiago. They were treated with the respect their heroism
deserved and on July 6 were exchanged for a number of prisoners
held by our forces.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>ADMIRAL WILLIAM T. SAMPSON</em>.]</p>

<p>Just one month after this exploit, that is on the morning of
July 3, 1898, Admiral Cervera attempted to escape from the harbor
of Santiago. The smoke of his vessels was discerned over the hills,
and the watchful ships outside signalled the fact to the other
members of the squadron. A few minutes later the bow of one of
the Spanish steamers came into sight from behind the Estrella
Battery. The <em>Brooklyn</em>, <em>Iowa</em> and <em>Oregon</em>,
some two and a half miles distant, crowded on all steam and headed
for the harbor. The first Spanish cruiser to show itself was the
<em>Infanta Maria Teresa</em>, followed by the <em>Vizcaya</em>,
the <em>Almirante Oquendo</em> and the <em>Cristobal Colon</em>,
with the torpedo boats <em>Pluton</em> and <em>Furor</em> bringing
up the rear. The <em>Infanta Maria Teresa</em>, leading the procession,
was the flagship of Admiral Cervera. He sent a shell toward the
American vessels, but, in accordance with the rule, it went wide
of the mark. The <em>Texas</em> opened with her big guns and her
companions quickly joined in the thunderous chorus.</p>

<p>No sooner were the Spanish ships clear of the harbor than they
turned westward and strained every nerve to escape, firing at
their pursuers, who were equally determined to overtake or destroy
them. The <em>Brooklyn</em>, further away from shore, changed
her course so as to follow a parallel direction, and, as soon
as she attained a fair range, opened a tremendous and well directed
fire. The <em>Texas</em>, whose course was somewhat diagonal,
singled out the <em>Vizcaya</em>, and, unable to outspeed her,
pounded her savagely with her shells.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>CAPTAIN JOHN PHILIP, OF THE "TEXAS</em>."]</p>

<p>Every movement of the splendid battleship was directed by her
Captain, John W. Philip. The <em>Texas</em> was struck several
times, but did not receive any material damage, while she wrought
frightful havoc on the <em>Vizcaya</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Oregon</em>, the finest ship in our navy, which had come
more than 14,000 miles from the Pacific coast, was ploughing forward
under forced draught, and, with a tremendous burst of speed, shot
past the <em>Texas</em> and drew up on the <em>Brooklyn</em> in
the effort to head off the leading fugitive, while the <em>Iowa</em>
was doing her utmost to maintain her killing pace and was firing
her great guns with splendid precision. Suddenly the <em>Vizcaya</em>
broke into flames and headed for shore. Knowing that she was doomed,
the <em>Brooklyn</em> and <em>Oregon</em> gave her a few parting
shots and kept up their furious pursuit of the <em>Almirante Oquendo</em>
and the <em>Cristobal Colon</em>.</p>

<p>Just then the torpedo boat destroyers <em>Pluton</em> and <em>Furor</em>
were discovered speeding also to the westward. Lieutenant Commander
Richard Wainwright, who was an officer on the <em>Maine</em> when
she was destroyed, was now in command of the auxiliary cruiser
<em>Gloucester</em>, and, without hesitation, he dashed after
the destroyers, though for a part of the time he received the
fire of Morro Castle, the <em>Vizcaya</em> and both of the dangerous
craft he was chasing. But the <em>Gloucester</em> seemed to bear
a charmed life, or, more truthfully speaking, the Spanish gunners
didn't know how to shoot.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Admiral Sampson, he had gone some miles away
to hold a conference with General Shafter when the Spanish fleet
made its attempt to escape, but he now came up with the <em>New
York</em>, eagerly rushing forward to bear a hand in the fight.
The <em>Pluton</em> and <em>Furor</em> fled before her, while
the <em>Indiana</em> shelled the first destroyer so mercilessly
that she turned and headed for the mouth of the harbor, several
miles distant. The vigilant <em>Gloucester</em> joined the <em>Indiana</em>
and one of the destroyers displayed a flag of truce. She was ablaze
from bow to stern and her crew ran her ashore, where she blew
up. The second was also beached and deserted by her crew. Meanwhile
the <em>Vizcaya</em> ran up the white flag and the <em>Texas</em>
stopped firing. She, like the <em>Infanta Maria Teresa</em>, was
on fire and her crews could do nothing but take to the shore in
the desperate effort to save themselves.</p>

<p>The <em>Almirante Oquendo</em> and the <em>Colon</em> were still
fleeing for life, with the <em>Iowa, Oregon, Brooklyn</em> and
<em>Texas</em> hard after them. Suddenly the <em>Almirante Oquendo</em>
turned toward shore. The <em>Brooklyn</em> and <em>Oregon</em>
kept after the <em>Cristobal Colon</em>, leaving the <em>Texas</em>
to dispose of the <em>Almirante Oquendo</em>. But the latter was
in flames and the flag at her stern was pulled down. The <em>Texas</em>
was approaching when the Spanish ship was torn by a tremendous
explosion. The Americans broke into cheers. Captain Philip threw
up his hand and called:</p>

<p>"Don't cheer, boys; the poor fellows are dying!"</p>

<p>It was chivalrous and thoughtful on the part of the American
commander and will never be forgotten.</p>

<p>The <em>Cristobal Colon</em> steamed along the coast with the
speed of a race horse, but the <em>Brooklyn</em>, <em>Texas</em>
and <em>Oregon</em> seemed to feel the prick of the spur and ran
as never before and as their captains did not believe them capable
of doing. The <em>Brooklyn</em> gradually drew ahead and the Spaniard,
seeing that escape was out of the question, hauled down his flag.
Thus the victory became complete.</p>

<p>The news was just in time to help in the universal rejoicing
and celebration of the Fourth of July. The Spanish fleet on the
other side of the globe had been destroyed and now the second
fleet was wiped out. In the former instance not a life was lost
and in the latter only one man was killed on our side, while the
loss of the enemy was severe. Never was a more decisive victory
gained by one nation over another in the whole history of the
world.</p>

<p>All my readers are familiar with the events that immediately
followed, but perhaps they would like to know something concerning
the naval heroes who did so much to contribute to the grand naval
victory off Santiago.</p>

<p>William T. Sampson was born in Palmyra, <em>N.Y., </em>February
9, 1840. He was the son of an ordinary day laborer and had few
early educational advantages, but he was appointed to the Naval
Academy and was graduated at the head of his class. He was on
the frigate <em>Potomac</em>, with the rank of master, when the
war broke out, but was too young to secure a command during the
war. He became a lieutenant in July, 1862, and served with that
rank on the practice ship <em>John Adams</em> at the Naval Academy
and on the ironclad <em>Patapsco</em>. On January 15, 1865, the
<em>Patapsco</em> attempted to force an entrance into the harbor
of Charleston, which was one network of mines. Sampson exposed
himself fearlessly and the ship met with a fearful disaster by
being blown up by a submarine mine. Seventy went down to death
as did those on the <em>Maine</em>, while Sampson and more than
a score of others, after being blown a hundred feet through the
air, saved themselves by swimming until they were picked up. Sampson
was commissioned as lieutenant commander in 1866, was at the Naval
Academy from 1868 to 1871, cruised for two years in European waters
and first commanded the <em>Alert</em> in 1874. Appointed to the
superintendency of the Naval Academy in 1888, he held the situation
for four years.</p>

<p>With the construction of the new navy, Sampson commanded in turn
two modern ships, the cruiser <em>San Francisco</em> and the battleship
<em>Iowa</em>. He was a close student of ordnance matters, gave
special attention to torpedo work and was chief of the Bureau
of Naval Ordnance from 1893 to 1897. There can be no question
of his fine ability nor that, had the opportunity presented, Rear
Admiral Sampson, as he had become, would have proven himself among
the foremost officers in our navy. It was a great personal misfortune
that he happened to be absent from the front of Santiago when
the Spanish fleet made its venture, but it must not be forgotten
that, in anticipation of such action, he had planned the battle
that was fought by the American ships.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>VIEW OF CHARLESTON HARBOR, SHOWING THE SUNKEN
VESSELS</em>.]</p>

<p>Winfield Scott Schley was born in Frederick, Md., October 9,
1839, and was graduated from the Naval Academy at the beginning
of the Civil War. After brief service on the storeship <em>Potomac</em>
he was promoted to master in 1861, and served on the <em>Winona</em>,
of the West Gulf blockading squadron, 1862-63. He there gained
a taste of real war and performed a number of exploits which proved
his coolness and daring. He received honorable mention for his
services in the engagements which led to the capture of Port Hudson.
He was commissioned lieutenant in July, 1862, and was executive
officer of the <em>Wateree</em> from 1864 to 1865, having been
made lieutenant commander in July, 1866, after which he spent
three years again at the Naval Academy, serving as instructor
of modern languages.</p>

<p>Admiral Schley has done brilliant service outside of what is
generally considered the routine duty of his profession. When
he was in Eastern waters in 1864 he landed 100 men, who protected
the American consulate when threatened during a native insurrection
among the natives of the Chin-Chi Islands. His most famous exploit
was the rescue of the Greely Arctic expedition. In 1881 Lieutenant
Adolphus W. Greely commanded an expedition of twenty-five men,
which established an observation station at the farthest point
in the polar regions then attained. The expedition, when in a
starving condition and with only seven men alive, was rescued
at Cape Sabine, Grinnell Land, in 1884 by Captain Schley. He was
rewarded for this service by a gold medal from Congress and promoted
by President Arthur to chief of the Bureau of Equipment and made
captain in 1888.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>COMMODORE WINFIELD SCOTT SCHLEY</em>.]</p>

<p>After resigning this position Captain Schley commanded the cruiser
<em>Baltimore</em>, which bore the remains of Ericsson, the great
Swedish inventor, to his native land, whose king presented Schley
with a gold medal in recognition of this service. He won the commendation
of the Navy Department for his tactful success in settling threatened
trouble over the stoning of a number of American sailors from
the <em>Baltimore</em> by a party of Chilians at Valparaiso. Commodore
Schley is a fine tactician, possesses a winning personality and
his work with the <em>Brooklyn,</em> off Santiago, on July 3,
was neither more nor less than his friends expected of him.</p>

<p>Robley D. Evans, known everywhere as "Fighting Bob," was born
in Virginia in 1846. When his father died he made his home with
his uncle in Washington, <em>D.C., </em>where he attended Gonzaga
College. In 1859 a Congressional Representative from Utah appointed
him to the Naval Academy. It was necessary for the boy to take
up a nominal residence in that distant territory, and on the journey
thither and back he encountered many personal dangers through
all of which he conducted himself with the pluck and bravery which
afterward distinguished him in the service of his country. He
entered the academy in 1860 and upon his graduation became a midshipman
and ensign, first on the frigate <em>Powhatan</em>, and before
he had attained his majority took part in the desperate assault
on Fort Fisher. He was stretched on the ground, dreadfully wounded
and with so many dead men piled upon him that he barely escaped
suffocation. He was wounded twice in the body and shot through
both legs. It seemed scarcely possible for him to live, and he
lay in the hospital for months. But when a surgeon prepared to
amputate one of his legs Evans, who had managed to procure a revolver,
warned him that upon his first attempt to do so he would shoot
him. The leg was saved, but Evans was lamed for life.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>CAPTAIN ROBLEY D. EVANS, OF THE "IOWA</em>."]</p>

<p>As soon as he was able to get about he applied for active service
and his application was granted. He was engaged in various duties
and in October, 1891, he arrived in command of the <em>Yorktown</em>
at Valparaiso, directly after the attack of a mob of Chilians
upon the sailors of the <em>Baltimore</em>. When some of the refugees
fled for safety to the <em>Yorktown</em> and the Chilians demanded
their surrender "Fighting Bob" replied that he would defend them
until the <em>Yorktown</em> went to the bottom. Some time later
the captain's launch was stoned, for the Chilians hated the Americans
as intensely as did the Spaniards. Captain Evans placed a rapid
fire gun in the bow of the launch, filled her with armed men and
went ashore. Hunting out the authorities, he notified them that
if any more stones were thrown at his launch he would make life
a burden for every Chilian within reach of the Yorktown's guns.
The launch was not stoned again.</p>

<p>It is a mistaken though general impression of "Fighting Bob"
that he is simply a headlong and reckless fighter. Such is far
from being the case, for he is deliberate, thoughtful and tactful.
He is a fine scholar, possesses a thorough knowledge of international
law and is simply resolute in protecting the rights of himself
and countrymen. This was proven by his conduct when in charge
of the American fleet in the Bering Sea, placed there to prevent
the illegal killing of seals. There was a good deal of friction
at that time between this country and England and had Captain
Evans been the reckless "scrapper" that many supposed he could
not have failed to involve us in trouble with that country. There
was not a word of censure upon his course. Out of 108 vessels
engaged in the illegal trade he captured 98 and of the several
hundred seals unlawfully killed he captured every one. Like all
the other officers and sailors who took part in the destruction
of Cervera's fleet, he was energetic, skilful, brave and chivalrous,
for when Captain Eulate, of the captured <em>Vizcaya</em>, offered
his sword to the Captain of the <em>Iowa</em> that gentleman kindly
waved him back and told him to keep the weapon he had used so
well.</p>

<p>Captain Evans does not like the name "Fighting Bob", for he feels
he has no more claim to the distinction than the rest of his associates.
Many of the stories told of his roughness of speech and profanity
are not true, though it cannot be denied that he has a habit of
expressing himself very vigorously when his feelings are stirred.
By his own request, Captain Evans was relieved, September 15,
1898, of the command of the <em>Iowa</em>, he having served more
than his regular term of sea service. At present he is a member
of the Board of Inspection and Survey.</p>

<p>John C. Watson was born in Frankfort, Ky., August 24, 1842, and
is a member of one of the leading families of the State. He entered
the Naval Academy at the age of fourteen and was graduated near
the head of his class in June, 1860. He was a midshipman on the
<em>Susquehanna</em> in Europe, at the breaking out of the war,
and was made master in August, 1861.</p>

<p>It is proof of the worth of the man that he was assigned as navigator
of the flagship <em>Hartford</em>, commanded by the lion-hearted
Farragut. He became lieutenant in June, 1862, and flag lieutenant
to Farragut in January, 1864.</p>

<p>The reader of these pages has learned something of the great
battles of New Orleans, Mobile Bay, Vicksburg and Port Hudson.
Watson took part in all of them and none acquitted himself better.
In a letter to his son, Admiral Farragut wrote: "I am almost as
fond of Watson as I am of your own dear self." In his report of
the battle of Mobile Bay, where Watson was wounded, Farragut wrote:
"Lieutenant Watson has been brought to your attention in former
times. He was on the poop attending to the signals and performed
his duty, as might be expected, thoroughly. He is a scion worthy
of the noble stock he springs from, and I commend him to your
attention."</p>

<p>A squadron of invincible power was made up for Watson in the
summer of 1898, with which it was intended Commodore Watson should
pay a hostile visit to the coast of Spain. But for the signing
of the peace protocol, that visit under its gallant and distinguished
commander would have proved one that the decrepit monarchy would
remember to the end of time.</p>

<p>Captain John W. Philip, promoted to the rank of commodore for
his superb work with the <em>Texas</em> off Santiago, is brave,
modest, devout and fond of practical joking. He is genial, exceedingly
popular with his associates and men and one of the finest officers
in the navy. The little incident well illustrates his character,
when, in the midst of the wild rejoicing of his men over the destruction
of the Spanish fleet, he checked them with the words: "Don't cheer,
boys; the poor fellows are dying!"</p>

<p>Lieutenant Commander Richard Wainwright performed an unequalled
exploit when in command of the <em>Gloucester</em>, formerly the
yacht <em>Corsair</em>, he wiped out the two torpedo boat destroyers
<em>Pluton</em> and <em>Furor</em>. At the time of that exploit
he was only forty-eight years old and the youngest man of his
grade in the navy. He is a fine officer and is a son of the late
Commodore Wainwright, who died in the service of his country during
the Civil War. Like many of our naval heroes, he seems to inherit
his fine fighting qualities, though it would not be far from the
truth to say that such is the rightful heritage of every American
soldier and sailor.</p>
