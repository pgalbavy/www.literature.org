<p>Don Luis once more addressed himself to Vorski:
</p><p>"We're agreed, aren't we, Kamerad? All that I'm saying exactly expresses
the truth?"
</p><p>Vorski had closed his eyes, his head was drooping, and the veins on his
temple were immoderately swollen. To prevent any interference by
Stéphane, Don Luis exclaimed:
</p><p>"You will speak, my fine fellow! Ah, the pain is beginning to grow
serious, is it? The brain is giving way? . . . Remember, just one
whistle, a bar or two of <u>Tipperary</u> and I interrupt my speech . . . .
You won't? You're not ripe yet? So much the worse for you! . . . And
you, Stéphane, have no fear for François. I answer for everything. But
no pity for this monster, please! No, no and again no! Don't forget that
he prepared and contrived everything of his own free will! Don't forget
. . . But I'm getting angry. What's the use?"
</p><p>Don Luis unfolded the page of the note-book on which Vorski had written
down the prophecy and, holding it under his eyes, continued:
</p><p>"What remains to be said is not so important, once the general
explanation is accepted. Nevertheless, we must go into detail to some
slight extent, show the mechanism of the affair imagined and built up
by Vorski and lastly come to the part played by our attractive ancient
Druid . . . . So we are now in the month of June. This is the season
fixed for the execution of the thirty victims. It was evidently
appointed by Brother Thomas because the rhythm of his verse called for a
month in one syllable, just as the year fourteen and three was selected
because three rhymes with be and tree and just as Brother Thomas decided
upon the number of thirty victims because thirty is the number of the
Sarek reefs and coffins. But Vorski takes it as a definite command.
Thirty victims are needed in June '17. They will be provided. They will
be provided on condition that the twenty-nine inhabitants of Sarek--we
shall see presently that Vorski has his thirtieth victim handy--consent
to stay on the island and await their destruction. Well, Vorski suddenly
hears of the departure of Honorine and Maguennoc. Honorine will come
back in time. But how about Maguennoc? Vorski does not hesitate: he
sends Elfride and Conrad on his tracks, with instructions to kill him
and to wait. He hesitates the less because he believes, from certain
words which he has overheard, that Maguennoc has taken with him the
precious stone, the miraculous gem which must not be touched but which
must be left in its leaden sheath (this is the actual phrase used by
Maguennoc)!
</p><p>"Elfride and Conrad therefore set out. One morning, at an inn, Elfride
mixes poison with the coffee which Maguennoc is drinking (the prophecy
has stated that there will be poison). Maguennoc continues his journey.
But in an hour or two he is seized with intolerable pain and dies,
almost immediately, on the bank by the road-side. Elfride and Conrad
come up and go through his pockets. They find nothing, no gem, no
precious stone. Vorski's hopes have not been realized. All the same, the
corpse is there. What are they to do with it? For the time being, they
fling it into a half-demolished hut, which Vorski and his accomplices
had visited some months before. Here Véronique d'Hergemont discovers the
body . . . and an hour later fails to find it there. Elfride and Conrad,
keeping watch close at hand, have taken it away and hidden it, still for
the time being, in the cellars of a little empty country-house.
</p><p>"There's one victim accounted for. We may observe, in passing, that
Maguennoc's predictions relating to the order in which the thirty
victims are to be executed--beginning with himself--have no basis. The
prophecy doesn't mention such a thing. In any case, Vorski goes to work
at random. At Sarek he carries off François and Stéphane Maroux and
then, both as a measure of precaution and in order to cross the island
without attracting attention and to enter the Priory more easily, he
dresses himself in Stéphane's clothes, while Raynold puts on François'.
The job before them is an easy one. The only people in the house are an
old man, M. d'Hergemont, and a woman, Marie Le Goff. As soon as these
are got rid of, the rooms and Maguennoc's in particular will be
searched. Vorski, as yet unaware of the result of Elfride's expedition,
would not be surprised if Maguennoc had left the miraculous jewel at the
Priory.
</p><p>"The first to fall is the cook, Marie Le Goff, whom Vorski takes by the
throat and stabs with a knife. But it so happens that the ruffian's
face gets covered with blood; and, seized with one of those fits of
cowardice to which he is subject, he runs away, after loosing Raynold
upon M. d'Hergemont.
</p><p>"The fight between the boy and the old man is a long one. It is
continued through the house and, by a tragic chance, ends before
Véronique d'Hergemont's eyes. M. d'Hergemont is killed. Honorine arrives
at the same moment. She drops, making the fourth victim.
</p><p>"Matters now begin to go quickly. Panic sets in during the night. The
people of Sarek, frightened out of their wits, seeing that Maguennoc's
predictions are being fulfilled and that the hour of the disaster which
has so long threatened their island is about to strike, make up their
minds to go. This is what Vorski and his son are waiting for. Taking up
their position in the motor-boat which they have stolen, they rush after
the runaways and the abominable hunt begins, the great disaster foretold
by Brother Thomas:
</p><p>"'There will be shipwrecks, terrors, grief and crimes.'
</p><p>"Honorine, who witnesses the scene and whose brain is already greatly
upset, goes mad and throws herself from the cliff.
</p><p>"Thereupon we have a lull of a few days, during which Véronique
d'Hergemont explores the Priory and the island without being disturbed.
As a matter of fact, after their successful hunt, leaving only Otto, who
spends his time drinking in the cells, the father and son have gone off
in the boat to fetch Elfride and Conrad and to bring back Maguennoc's
body and fling it in the water within sight of Sarek, since Maguennoc
of necessity has one of the thirty coffins earmarked for his reception.
</p><p>"At that moment, that is when he returns to Sarek, Vorski's bag numbers
twenty-four victims. Stéphane and François are prisoners, guarded by
Otto. The rest consists of four women reserved for crucifixion,
including the three sisters Archignat, all locked up in their
wash-house. It is their turn next. Véronique d'Hergemont tries to
release them, but it is too late. Waylaid by the band, shot at by
Raynold, who is an expert archer, the sisters Archignat are wounded by
arrows (for arrows, see the prophecy) and fall into the enemy's hands.
That same evening they are strung up on the three oaks, after Vorski has
first relieved them of the fifty thousand-franc notes which they carried
concealed on their persons. Total: twenty-nine victims. Who will be the
thirtieth? Who will be the fourth woman?"
</p><p>Don Luis paused and continued:
</p><p>"As to this, the prophecy speaks very plainly in two places, each of
which complements the other:
</p><p>"'Before his mother's eyes, Abel kills Cain.'
</p><p>"And, a few lines lower down:
</p><p>"'His wedded wife one night in June hath slain.'
</p><p>"Vorski, from the moment when he became aware of this document, had
interpreted the two lines in his own fashion. Being, in fact, unable at
that time to dispose of Véronique, for whom he has vainly been hunting
all over France, he temporizes with the decrees of destiny. The fourth
woman to be tortured shall be a wife, but she shall be his first wife,
Elfride. And this will not be absolutely contrary to the prophecy,
which, if need be, can apply to the mother of Cain just as well as to
the mother of Abel. And observe that the other prophecy, that which was
communicated to him by word of mouth in the old days, also failed to
specify the woman who was to die:
</p><p>"'Vorski's wife shall perish on the cross.'
</p><p>"Which wife? Elfride.
</p><p>"So his dear, devoted accomplice is to perish. It's terrible for Vorski;
it breaks his heart. But the god Moloch must be obeyed; and, considering
that Vorski, to accomplish his task, decided to sacrifice his son
Raynold, it would be inexcusable if he refused to sacrifice his wife
Elfride. So all will be well.
</p><p>"But, suddenly, a dramatic incident occurs. While pursuing the sisters
Archignat, he sees and recognizes Véronique d'Hergemont!
</p><p>"A man like Vorski could not fail to behold in this yet another favour
vouchsafed by the powers above. The woman whom he has never forgotten is
sent to him at the very moment when she is to take her place in the
great adventure. She is given to him as a miraculous victim which he can
destroy . . . or conquer. What a prospect! And how the heavens brighten
with unexpected light! Vorski loses his head. He becomes more and more
convinced that he is the Messiah, the chosen one, the apostle,
missionary, the man who is 'obeying destiny.' He is linked up with the
line of the high-priests, the guardians of the God-Stone. He is a Druid,
an arch-druid; and, as such, on the night when Véronique d'Hergemont
burns the bridge, on the sixth night after the moon, he goes and cuts
the sacred mistletoe with a golden sickle!
</p><p>"And the siege of the Priory begins. I will not linger over this.
Véronique d'Hergemont has told you the whole story, Stéphane, and we
know her sufferings, the part played by the delightful All's Well, the
discovery of the underground passage and the cells, the fight for
François, the fight for you, Stéphane, whom Vorski imprisoned in one of
the torture-cells called 'death-chambers' in the prophecy. Here you are
surprised with Madame d'Hergemont. The young monster, Raynold, hurls you
into the sea. François and his mother escape. Unfortunately, Vorski and
his band succeed in reaching the Priory. François is captured. His
mother joins him. And then . . . and then the most tragic scenes ensue,
scenes upon which I will not enlarge: the interview between Vorski and
Véronique d'Hergemont, the duel between the two brothers, between Cain
and Abel, before Véronique d'Hergemont's very eyes. For the prophecy
insists upon it:
</p><p>"'Before his mother's eyes, Abel kills Cain.'
</p><p>"And the prophecy likewise demands that she shall suffer beyond
expression and that Vorski shall be subtle in doing evil. 'A cruel
prince,' he puts marks on the two combatants; and, when Abel is on the
point of being defeated, he himself wounds Cain so that Cain may be
killed.
</p><p>"The monster is mad. He's mad and drunk. The climax is close at hand. He
drinks and drinks; for Véronique d'Hergemont's martyrdom is to take
place that evening:
</p><p>    "'By thousand deaths and lingering agony,
    His wedded wife one night of June hath slain.'
</p><p>"The thousand deaths Véronique has already undergone; and the agony will
be lingering. The hour comes. Supper, funeral procession, preparations,
the setting up of the ladder, the binding of the victim and then . . .
and then the ancient Druid!"
</p><p>Don Luis gave a hearty laugh as he uttered the last words:
</p><p>"Here, upon my word, things begin to get amusing! From this moment
onward, tragedy goes hand in hand with comedy, the gruesome with the
burlesque. Oh, that ancient Druid, what a caution! To you, Stéphane, and
you, Patrice, who were behind the scenes, the story is devoid of
interest. But to you, Vorski, what exciting revelations! . . . I say,
Otto, just put the ladder against the trunk of the tree, so that your
employer can rest his feet on the top rung. Is that easier for you,
Vorski? Mark you, my little attention does not come from any ridiculous
feeling of pity. Oh, dear, no! But I'm afraid that you might go phut;
and besides I want you to be in a comfortable position to listen to the
ancient Druid's confession."
</p><p>He had another burst of laughter. There was no doubt about it: the
ancient Druid was a great source of entertainment to Don Luis.
</p><p>"The ancient Druid's arrival," he said, "introduces order and reason
into the adventure. What was loose and vague becomes more compact.
Incoherent crime turns into logical punishment. We have no longer blind
obedience to Brother Thomas' doggerel, but the submission to common
sense, the rigorous method of a man who knows what he wants and who has
no time to lose. Really, the ancient Druid deserves all our admiration.
</p><p>"The ancient Druid, whom we may call either Don Luis Perenna or Arsène
Lupin--you suspect that, don't you?--knew very little of the story when
the periscope of his submarine, the <u>Crystal Stopper</u>, emerged in sight
of the coast of Sarek at mid-day yesterday."
</p><p>"Very little?" Stéphane Maroux cried, in spite of himself.
</p><p>"One might say, nothing," Don Luis declared.
</p><p>"What! All those facts about Vorski's past, all those precise details
about what he did at Sarek, about his plans and the part played by
Elfride and the poisoning of Maguennoc?"
</p><p>"I learnt all that here, yesterday," said Don Luis.
</p><p>"But from whom? We never left one another?"
</p><p>"Believe me when I say that the ancient Druid, when he landed yesterday
on the coast of Sarek, knew nothing at all. But the ancient Druid lays
claim to be at least as great a favourite of the gods as you are,
Vorski. And in fact he at once had the luck to see, on a lonely little
beach, our friend Stéphane, who himself had had the luck to fall into a
pretty deep pool of water and thus to escape the fate which you and your
son had prepared for him. Rescue-work, conversation. In half an hour,
the ancient Druid had the facts. Forthwith, investigations. He ended by
reaching the cells, where he found in yours, Vorski, a white robe which
he needed for his own use and a scrap of paper with a copy of the
prophecy written by yourself. Excellent. The ancient Druid knows the
enemy's plans.
</p><p>"He begins by following the tunnel down which François and his mother
fled, but is unable to pass because of the subsidence which has been
produced. He retraces his steps and comes out on the Black Heath.
Exploration of the island. Meeting with Otto and Conrad. The enemy burns
the foot-bridge. It is six o'clock in the evening. Query: how to get to
the Priory? Stéphane suggests, by the Postern path. The ancient Druid
returns to the <u>Crystal Stopper</u>. They circumnavigate the island under
the direction of Stéphane, who knows all the channels--and besides, my
dear Vorski, the <u>Crystal Stopper</u> is a very docile submarine. She can
slip in anywhere; the ancient Druid had her built to his own
designs--and at last they land at the spot where François' boat is
hanging. Here, meeting with All's Well, who is sleeping under the boat,
the ancient Druid introduces himself. Immediate display of sympathy.
They make a start. But, half-way up the ascent, All's Well branches off.
At this place the wall is the cliff is, so to speak, patched with
movable blocks of stone. In the middle of these stones is an opening, an
opening made by Maguennoc, as the ancient Druid discovered later, in
order to enter the hall of sacrifices and the mortuary crypts. Thus, the
ancient Druid finds himself in the thick of the plot, master above
ground and below. Only, it is eight o'clock in the evening.
</p><p>"As regards François, there is no immediate anxiety. The prophecy says,
'Abel kills Cain.' But Véronique d'Hergemont was to perish 'one night of
June.' Had she undergone the horrible martyrdom? Was it too late to
rescue her?"
</p><p>Don Luis turned to Stéphane:
</p><p>"You remember, Stéphane, the agony through which you and the ancient
Druid passed and your relief at discovering the tree prepared with the
inscription, 'V. d'H.' The tree has no victim on it yet. Véronique will
be saved; and in fact we hear a sound of voices coming from the Priory.
It is the grim procession. It slowly climbs the grassy slope amid the
thickening darkness. The lantern is waved. A halt is called. Vorski
spouts and holds forth. The last scene is at hand. Soon we shall rush to
the assault and Véronique will be delivered.
</p><p>"But here an incident occurs which will amuse you, Vorski. Yes, we make
a strange discovery, my friends and I: we find a woman prowling round
the dolmen, who hides as we come up. We seize her. Stéphane recognizes
her by the light of an electric torch. Do you know who it was, Vorski? I
give you a hundred guesses. Elfride! Yes, Elfride, your accomplice, the
one whom you meant to crucify at first! Curious, wasn't it? In an
extreme state of excitement, half crazy, she tells us that she consented
to the duel between the two boys on your promise that her son would be
the victor and kill Véronique's son. But you had locked her up, in the
morning; and, in the evening, when she succeeded in making her escape,
it was Raynold's dead body that she found. She has now come to be
present at the torture of the rival whom she detests and then to avenge
herself on you and kill you, my poor old chap.
</p><p>"A capital idea! The ancient Druid approves; and, while you go up to the
dolmen and Stéphane keeps an eye on you, he continues to question
Elfride. But, lo and behold, Vorski, at the sound of your voice, the
jade begins to kick! She veers round unexpectedly. Her master's voice
stimulates her to an unparalleled display of ardour. She wants to see
you, to warn you of your danger, to save you; and suddenly she makes a
rush at the ancient Druid with a dagger in her hand. The ancient Druid
is obliged, in self-defence, to knock her down, half-stunning her; and
the sight of this moribund woman at once suggests to him a means of
turning the incident to good account. The wretched creature is tied up
in the twinkling of an eye. The ancient Druid intends you yourself to
punish her, Vorski, and make her undergo the fate which you had reserved
for her before. So he slips his robe on Stéphane, gives him his
instructions, shoots an arrow in your direction the moment you come up
and, while you go running in pursuit of a white robe, does a
conjuring-trick and substitutes Elfride for Véronique, the first wife
for the second. How? That's my business. All you need know is that the
trick was played and succeeded to perfection!" Don Luis stopped to draw
breath. One would really have thought, from his familiar and
confidential tone, that he was telling Vorski an amusing story, a good
joke, which Vorski ought to be the first to laugh at.
</p><p>"That's not all," he continued. "Patrice Belval and some of my
Moors--you may as well know that we have eighteen of them on board--have
been working in the underground rooms. There's no getting away from the
prophecy. The moment the wife has expired
</p><p>    "'Fire and loud noise will issue from the earth.
    In secrecy where the great treasure lies.'
</p><p>"Of course, Brother Thomas never knew where the great treasure lay, nor
did any one else. But the ancient Druid has guessed; and he wants Vorski
to receive his signal and to drop ready-roasted into his mouth. For this
he needs an outlet issuing near the Fairies' Dolmen. Captain Belval
looks for one and finds it. They clear an old stairway. They clear the
inside of the dead tree. They take from the submarine some
dynamite-cartridges and signal-rockets and place them in position. And,
when you, Vorski, from your perch, start proclaiming like a herald,
'She's dead! The fourth woman has died upon the cross!' bang, bang,
bang! Thunder, flame, uproar, the whole bag of tricks. That does it: you
are more and more the darling of the gods, the pet of destiny; and you
burn with the noble longing to fling yourself down the chimney and
gobble up the God-Stone. Next day, therefore, after sleeping off your
brandy and your rum, you start to work again, smiling. You killed your
thirty victims, according to the rites prescribed by Brother Thomas. You
have surmounted every obstacle. The prophecy is fulfilled.
</p><p>    "'And man again will on the stone set eyes
    Once stolen from wild men in bye-gone days
    O'er sea: the God-stone which gives life or death.'
</p><p>"The ancient Druid has no choice but to give in and to hand you the key
of Paradise. But first, of course, a little interlude, a few capers and
wizard's tricks, just for a bit of fun. And then hey for the God-Stone
guarded by the Sleeping Beauty!"
</p><p>Don Luis nimbly cut a few of those capers of which he seemed so fond.
Then he said to Vorski:
</p><p>"Well, old chap, I have a vague impression that you've had enough of my
speech and that you would prefer to reveal François' hiding-place to me
at once, rather then stay here any longer. I'm awfully sorry, but you
really must learn how the matter stands with the Sleeping Beauty and the
unexpected presence of Véronique d'Hergemont. However, two minutes will
be sufficient. Pardon me."
</p><p>Dropping the character of the ancient Druid and speaking in his own
name, Don Luis continued:
</p><p>"What you want to know is why I took Véronique d'Hergemont to that place
after snatching her from your clutches. The answer is very simple. Where
would you have me take her? To the submarine? An absurd suggestion! The
sea was rough that night and Véronique needed rest. To the Priory?
Never! That would have been too far from the scene of operations and I
should have had no peace of mind. In reality there was only one place
sheltered from the storm and sheltered from attack; and that was the
hall of sacrifices. That was why I took her there and why she was
sleeping there, quietly, under the influence of a strong narcotic, when
you saw her. I confess that the pleasure of treating you to this
spectacle counted for something in my decision. And how splendidly I was
rewarded! Oh, if you could have seen the face you pulled! Such a ghastly
sight! Véronique raised from the dead! Véronique brought back to life!
So horrible was the vision that you ran away helter-skelter.
</p><p>"But to cut a long story short: you find the exit blocked. Thereupon you
change your mind. Conrad returns to the offensive. He attacks me by
stealth while I am preparing to move Véronique d'Hergemont to the
submarine. Conrad receives a mortal blow from one of the Moors. Second
comic interlude. Conrad, dressed up in the ancient Druid's robe, is laid
on the floor in one of the crypts; and of course your first thought is
to leap on him and wreak your vengeance on him. And, when you see
Elfride's body, which has taken the place of Véronique d'Hergemont in
the sacred table, whoosh . . . you jump on that too and reduce the woman
whom you have already crucified to a bleeding pulp! Blunder upon
blunder! And the end of the whole story likewise strikes a comic note.
You are strung up on the pillory while I deliver straight at you a
speech which does for you and which proves that, if you have won the
God-Stone by virtue of your thirty coffins, I am taking possession of it
by my own intrinsic virtue. There's the whole adventure for you, my dear
Vorski. Except for a few secondary incidents, or some others, of greater
importance, which there is no need for you to know, you know as much as
I do. You've been quite comfortable and have had lots of time to think.
So I am confidently expecting your answer about François. Come, out with
your little song:
</p><p>    "'It's a long, long way to Tipperary.
    It's a long way to go . . . .'
</p><p>"Well? Are you feeling in a chatty mood?"
</p><p>Don Luis had climbed a few rungs. Stéphane and Patrice had come near and
were anxiously listening. It was evident that Vorski meant to speak.
</p><p>He had opened his eyes and was staring at Don Luis with a look of
mingled hatred and fear. This extraordinary man must have appeared to
him as one of those persons against whom it is absolutely useless to
fight and to whom it is equally useless to appeal for compassion. Don
Luis represented the conqueror; and, in the presence of one stronger
than yourself, there is nothing for it but to yield in all humility.
Besides, Vorski was incapable of further resistance. The torture was
becoming intolerable.
</p><p>He spoke a few words in an unintelligible voice.
</p><p>"A little louder, please," said Don Luis. "I can't hear. Where's
François?"
</p><p>He climbed the ladder. Vorski stammered:
</p><p>"Shall I be free?"
</p><p>"On my word of honour. We shall all leave this place, except Otto, who
will release you."
</p><p>"At once?"
</p><p>"At once."
</p><p>"Then . . ."
</p><p>"Then what?"
</p><p>"Well, François is alive."
</p><p>"You mutton-head. I know that. But where is he?"
</p><p>"Tied into the boat."
</p><p>"The one hanging at the foot of the cliff?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>Don Luis struck his forehead with his hand:
</p><p>"Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! . . . Don't mind: I'm speaking of myself. Yes, I
ought to have guessed that! Why, All's Well was sleeping under the boat,
peacefully, like a good dog sleeping beside his master! Why, when we
sent All's Well on François' trail, he led Stéphane straight to the
boat. It's true enough, there are times when the cleverest of us behave
like simpletons! But you, Vorski, did you know that there was a way down
there and a boat?"
</p><p>"I knew it since yesterday."
</p><p>"And, you artful dog, you intended to skedaddle in her?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Well, Vorski, you shall skedaddle in her, with Otto. I'll leave her for
you. Stéphane!"
</p><p>But Stéphane Maroux was already running towards the cliff, escorted by
All's Well.
</p><p>"Release him, Stéphane," cried Don Luis.
</p><p>And he added, addressing the Moors:
</p><p>"Help him, you others. And get the submarine under way. We shall sail in
ten minutes."
</p><p>He turned to Vorski:
</p><p>"Good-bye, my dear chap . . . . Oh, just one more word! Every
well-regulated adventure contains a love-story. Ours appears to be
without one, for I should never dare to allude to the feelings that
urged you towards the sainted woman who bore your name. And yet I must
tell you of a very pure and noble affection. Did you notice the
eagerness with which Stéphane flew to François' assistance? Obviously he
loves his young pupil, but he loves the mother still more. And, since
everything that pleases Véronique d'Hergemont is bound to please you, I
wish to admit that he is not indifferent to her, that his wonderful love
has touched her heart, that it was with real joy that she saw him
restored to her this morning and that this will all end in a wedding
. . . as soon as she's a widow, of course. You follow me, don't you? The
only obstacle to their happiness is yourself. Therefore, as you are a
perfect little gentleman, you will not like to . . . But I need not go
on. I rely on your good manners to die as soon as you can. Good-bye, old
fellow, I won't offer you my hand, but my heart's with you. Otto, in ten
minutes, unless you hear to the contrary, release your employer. You'll
find the boat at the bottom of the cliff. Good luck, my friends!"
</p><p>It was finished. The battle between Don Luis and Vorski was ended: and
the issue had not been in doubt for a single instant. From the first
minute, one of the two adversaries had so consistently dominated the
other, that the latter, in spite of all his daring and his training as a
criminal, had been nothing more than a grotesque, absurd, disjointed
puppet in his opponent's hands. After succeeding in the entire execution
of his plan, after attaining and surpassing his object, he, the master
of events, in the moment of victory, found himself suddenly strung up on
the tree of torture; and there he remained, gasping and captive like an
insect pinned to a strip of cork.
</p><p>Without troubling any further about his victims, Don Luis went off with
Patrice Belval, who could not help saying to him:
</p><p>"All the same, you're letting those vile scoundrels down very lightly!"
</p><p>"Pooh, it won't be long before they get themselves nabbed elsewhere,"
said Don Luis, chuckling. "What do you expect them to do?"
</p><p>"Well, first of all, to take the God-Stone."
</p><p>"Out of the question! It would need twenty men to do that, with a
scaffolding and machinery. I myself am giving up the idea for the
present. I shall come back after the war."
</p><p>"But, look here, Don Luis, what is this miraculous stone?"
</p><p>"Ah, now you're asking something!" said Don Luis, without making further
reply.
</p><p>They set out; and Don Luis, rubbing his hands, said:
</p><p>"I worked the thing well. It's not much over twenty-four hours since we
landed at Sarek. And the riddle had lasted twenty-four centuries. One
century an hour. My congratulations, Lupin."
</p><p>"I should be glad to offer you mine, Don Luis," said Patrice Belval,
"but they are not worth as much as those of an expert like yourself."
</p><p>When they reached the sands of the little beach, François' boat had
already been lowered and was empty. Farther away, on the right, the
<u>Crystal Stopper</u> was floating on the calm sea. François came running up
to them, stopped a few yards from Don Luis and looked at him with
wide-open eyes:
</p><p>"I say," he murmured, "then it's you? It's you I was expecting?"
</p><p>"Faith," said Don Luis, laughing. "I don't know if you were expecting me
. . . but I'm sure it's me!"
</p><p>"You . . . you . . . Don Luis Perenna! . . . That is to say . . ."
</p><p>"Hush, no other names! Perenna's enough for me . . . . Besides, we won't
talk about me, if you don't mind. I was just a chance, a gentleman who
happened to drop in at the right moment. Whereas you . . . by Jove,
youngster, but you've done jolly well! . . . So you spent the night in
the boat?"
</p><p>"Yes, under the tarpaulin, lashed to the bottom and tightly gagged."
</p><p>"Uncomfortable?"
</p><p>"Not at all. I hadn't been there ten minutes when All's Well appeared.
So . . ."
</p><p>"But the man, the scoundrel: what had he threatened to do to you?"
</p><p>"Nothing. After the duel, while the others were attending to my
opponent, he brought me down here, pretending that he was going to take
me to mother and put us both on board the boat. Then, when we got to the
boat, he laid hold of me without a word."
</p><p>"Do you know the man? Do you know his name?"
</p><p>"I know nothing about him. All I can say is that he was persecuting us,
mother and me."
</p><p>"For reasons which I shall explain to you, François. In any case, you
have nothing to fear from him now."
</p><p>"Oh, but you haven't killed him?"
</p><p>"No, but I have put it out of his power to do any more harm. This will
all be explained to you; but I think that, for the moment, the most
urgent thing is that we should go to your mother."
</p><p>"Stéphane told me that she was resting over there, in the submarine, and
that you had saved her too. Does she expect me?"
</p><p>"Yes; we had a talk last night, she and I, and I promised to find you. I
felt that she trusted me. All the same, Stéphane, you had better go
ahead and prepare her."
</p><p>The <u>Crystal Stopper</u> lay at the end of a reef of rocks which formed a
sort of natural jetty. Some ten or twelve Moors were running to and fro.
Two had drawn apart and were whispering together. Two of them were
holding a gangway which Don Luis and François crossed a minute later.
</p><p>In one of the cabins, arranged as a drawing-room, Véronique lay
stretched on a couch. Her pale face bore the marks of the unspeakable
suffering which she had undergone. She seemed very weak, very weary. But
her eyes, full of tears, were bright with happiness.
</p><p>François rushed into her arms. She burst into sobs, without speaking a
word.
</p><p>Opposite them, All's Well, seated on his haunches, beat the air with his
fore-paws and looked at them, with his head a little on one side:
</p><p>"Mother," said François, "Don Luis is here."
</p><p>She took Don Luis' hand and pressed a long kiss upon it, while François
murmured:
</p><p>"You saved mother . . . . You saved us both . . . ."
</p><p>Don Luis interrupted him:
</p><p>"Will you give me pleasure, François? Well, don't thank me. If you
really want to thank somebody, there, thank your friend All's Well. He
does not look as if he had played a very important part in the piece.
And yet, compared with the scoundrel who persecuted you, he was the good
genius, always discreet, intelligent, modest and silent."
</p><p>"So are you!"
</p><p>"Oh, I am neither modest nor silent; and that's why I admire All's Well.
Here, All's Well, come along with me and, for goodness' sake, stop
sitting up! You might have to do it all night, for they will be shedding
tears together for hours, the mother and son . . . ."
