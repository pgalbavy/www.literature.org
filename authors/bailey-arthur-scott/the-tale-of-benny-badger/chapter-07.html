<p>The next evening, just at dusk, Benny Badger left his den and set forth
on his usual nightly ramble.
</p>
<p>By way of exercise, and for the sake of the fun it gave him, and to
improve his appetite, he dug a few holes. And by the time it was dark he
was hungry as a bear and ready to look once more for fresh holes made by
Ground Squirrels.
</p><p>He had decided not to wait for Mr. Coyote to join him, before beginning
his search. And he even hoped that Mr. Coyote had forgotten all about
his promise to meet him and help him hunt.
</p><p>But Benny Badger was to have no such good fortune as that. It was not
long before he heard Mr. Coyote calling to him. And though he made no
answer, thinking that Mr. Coyote might not be able to find him, in a few
minutes that sharp-faced gentleman came bounding up at top speed.
</p><p>"Here I am!" he cried, as soon as he spied Benny Badger. "I see you
started out without waiting for me. You didn't think I'd disappoint you,
did you?"
</p><p>"I was afraid you wouldn't," Benny answered--a remark that Mr. Coyote
seemed not to understand. For a moment or two he looked somewhat
puzzled. But he decided, evidently, that Benny <u>meant</u> to be pleasant,
but didn't know how to be.
</p><p>"Now, then," Mr. Coyote said, while Benny Badger shuddered at his harsh
voice, "now then, where do you think we'd better look for a hole?"
</p><p>"For pity's sake, don't howl so loud!" Benny Badger besought him.
"You'll waken all the Ground Squirrels in the neighborhood if you're so
noisy."
</p><p>"Pardon me!" said Mr. Coyote very meekly, lowering his voice, but
promptly raising it again. "Do you know of any fresh holes around here?"
</p><p>Benny Badger said that he didn't.
</p><p>"Then you'd better hunt for one at once," Mr. Coyote declared, sitting
down on his haunches as if he hadn't the slightest notion of doing any
of the searching himself. "While you're looking, I'll sing a little
song," he announced.
</p><p>"You needn't trouble yourself to do that," Benny Badger told him
hastily.
</p><p>"Oh, it's no trouble at all, I assure you," Mr. Coyote replied.
</p><p>"Well--don't you do it, anyhow," Benny warned him. "If you sing, you'll
spoil everything, because I shall not be able to look for any hole."
</p><p>"I see," said Mr. Coyote, looking more than pleased. "You'd want to stop
and listen to me, of course."
</p><p>"It's not that," Benny Badger corrected him. "I may as well tell you
that I don't like your songs at all."
</p><p>"I have some that you've never heard," Mr. Coyote explained.
</p><p>"I don't want to hear them," Benny Badger informed him. "I may as well
tell you that your songs drive me almost crazy."
</p><p>It would not have been surprising if Mr. Coyote had flown into a great
rage. But he did not. Instead, he pretended to wipe a tear away from
each of his eyes. "It's a pity"--he sighed--"it's a pity that you don't
understand music. Some time I will teach you to sing--with the help of
my six brothers."
</p><p>Benny Badger showed no joy over that promise. But he felt relieved when
Mr. Coyote agreed not to sing that night. And then Benny set out alone
to look for a fresh Ground Squirrel's hole, leaving Mr. Coyote with his
face hidden in his pocket-handkerchief.
