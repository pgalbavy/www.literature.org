<p>As a rule the American Indian is not partial to cigarette smoking,
that being a vice that he is willing to leave to his more civilized
brother; but the Comanche in front of Avon Burnet, and so near
him, left no doubt of his purpose.</p>

<p>As the tiny flame burned more brightly, he shaded it with his
hands and puffed the twisted roll of tobacco, like one who knew
how liable the blaze was to be blown out by the wind that rustled
among the mesquite bushes. He was such an expert at the business,
however, that he met with no difficulty.</p>

<p>The glow of the flame shone between the fingers, where they slightly
touched each other, giving them a crimson hue, while the point
of the nose, the eyes, and the front of the face were revealed
almost as distinctly as was the countenance of the warrior whom
Dinah discovered in the act of firing the roof of the cabin.</p>

<p>This Comanche was more ill-favored than the other and was in
middle life. There was something in his appearance which gave
the youth the suspicion that he was the chief or leader of the
band of raiders, though there could be no certainty on that point.</p>

<p>Nothing would have been easier than for Avon, from where he stood,
to shoot down the savage and appropriate his horse for himself.
There was an instant when he meditated such a step, but though
many a veteran of the frontier would have seized the chance with
eagerness, he shrank from such a deliberate taking of human life.</p>

<p>The youth had already shown his pluck and readiness to use his
weapon when necessary, but he could not justify himself in an
act like the one named.</p>

<p>But he did not mean to stand idle when there was a call for instant
and decisive action.</p>

<p>While the Comanche used his two hands in manipulating his match
and cigarette, his rifle leaned against the limbs of one of the
largest mesquite bushes, where he could snatch it up without stirring
a foot.</p>

<p>It was not to be supposed that he had dismounted for the purpose
of kindling his cigarette, for he could have done that on the
back of his mustang, as well as when on the ground. He must have
decided that he was nigh enough to the other warriors to light
his tobacco before joining them on foot.</p>

<p>The youth was sure the steed before him was a fine one, for it
is rare to see one of those people without an excellent horse,
and he resolved to capture it.</p>

<p>At the instant the match was at its best, and the point of the
cigarette was glowing red, Avon stepped toward the motionless
steed, passing along the side which was furthest from his master.
The beast saw him on the instant, and gave a slight whinny and
recoiled.</p>

<p>His master spoke sharply, while the cigarette was between his
teeth. Not suspecting the cause of his alarm, he supposed it was
trifling and gave it no attention. But when his animal, with a
loud snort, wheeled and started off on a gallop, the Indian threw
down his match, called out angrily, and, grasping his gun, sprang
forward to intercept him.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the darkness was more dense in the
mesquite bush than on the open prairie, and, although he caught
a glimpse of the vanishing mustang, he saw nothing of the figure
on his back, for the reason that, when the nimble youth vaulted
thither, he threw himself forward on his neck.</p>

<p>The Indian must have been astonished by the action of his animal,
but he probably concluded he would not wander far, and would be
within reach in the morning when needed. So he refrained from
attempting anything like pursuit, which would have been foolish
under the circumstances.</p>

<p>It was a clever exploit on the part of Avon Burnet, and he could
not repress a feeling of exultation over the success. Boldness,
dash, and peculiarly favoring circumstances had taken him through
the Comanche lines, when a repetition of the attempt would fail
ninety-nine times out of a hundred.</p>

<p>But while he was justified in being grateful, there was enough
serious business still before him. He could not forget that the
friends in the cabin were in dire peril and no time ought to be
wasted in bringing them relief.</p>

<p>The first indispensable act was to locate himself, so as to gain
an idea of the points of the compass, without which it was beyond
his power to reach the camp of his friends.</p>

<p>A brief walk brought the horse out of the bush and he stood on
the open prairie. The mustang was without saddle or bridle, except
a single buffalo thong, that was twisted over his nose and by
which his master guided him. Avon had ridden the animals in the
same way, and since this mustang became tractable the instant
he felt anyone on his back, such an equestrian as the young Texan
met with no difficulty whatever.</p>

<p>But he realized that a serious difficulty confronted him when
he attempted to locate himself. The flurry in the bush had so
mixed up his ideas of direction, that he was all at sea.</p>

<p>Not a star twinkled in the cloudy sky, nor could he tell in what
quarter of the heavens the moon was hidden. Looking in the supposed
direction of the cabin, he saw only gloom, while it was equally
dark when he gazed toward the spot where he believed the camp
of the cowboys lay.</p>

<p>Between the home of Captain Shirril and the spot where his men
awaited his coming were several elevations and depressions of
land, so that had the Texans been burning a fire, as was likely,
it would not show until more than half the intervening distance
was passed. The cattle were herded to the northward, so that in
the event of a stampede it was easier to head them on the right
course over the Great Cattle Trail.</p>

<p>A person placed in the situation of young Burnet is apt to go
astray, no matter how extended his experience in wandering abroad
at night, unless he is able to start right. This was the difficulty
with Avon, who was too wise to depend upon what impressions took
possession of him, since it is almost the invariable rule that
such impressions are wrong.</p>

<p>There was one faint hope: the Comanches in the vicinity of the
cabin had been indulging in shouting and firing their guns. These
sounds would prove of great help, but to his dismay, though he
sat for several minutes motionless on his mustang and listening,
he heard nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>He knew the wind was unfavorable, but he was compelled to believe
that he had ridden much further than he first supposed, in order
to be beyond reach of the reports. After mounting his mustang,
he had sent him scurrying on a dead run through the bush, and
kept it up for several minutes, before emerging into the open
country: that was sufficient to take him a long way and, as he
believed, excluded the one means of guidance which otherwise would
have been his.</p>

<p>"Helloa! what does that mean?"</p>

<p>In peering around in the gloom, he saw, apparently a long way
off to the left, a star-like point on the prairie, which shone
out with an increasing gleam. Wondering what it could signify,
he sat for a minute or two, attentively watching it, but unable
to solve the interesting question.</p>

<p>"These Comanches are as fond of smoking as are our men, and I
suppose one of them has some trouble in lighting his pipe or cigarette&mdash;helloa!
there it goes!"</p>

<p>The light which was so interesting to him suddenly went out,
and all was blank darkness again.</p>

<p>He waited and looked for several minutes, but it did not reappear.
At the moment it vanished, he fancied he heard a slight sound,
but it was too indefinite to identify.</p>

<p>Had the young man but known that the light which he had seen
was burning on the roof of his own home, and that it was Dinah
who extinguished it so abruptly, he would have shaped his course
far differently.</p>
