<p>"The Apaches are coming! The Apaches are coming!" shouted Sut
Simpson, as his mustang thundered up to the edge of the valley,
while his clear, powerful voice rang out like a bugle.</p>

<p>The words were startling enough, and the sudden dropping of a
dozen bombshells among the unfinished dwellings of New Boston
could not have created greater consternation, emphasized as they
were by the towering form of the hunter and steed, who looked
as if they had been fired from the throat of some immense Columbiad,
and had not as yet recovered from their bewilderment. There was
some system, however, in the movements of the pioneers, for there
was ever present in their thoughts the very danger which had now
come upon them so suddenly.</p>

<p>In the structure which was nearest completion were placed the
dozen women and children, while the other houses that were in
a condition to afford the means of defense were taken possession
of by the men, gun in hand, ready to defend themselves to the
last. Fortunately enough, the horses happened to be corraled within
the inclosure, so that, unless the defense should utterly fail,
there was little danger of their being stampeded by the Indians.</p>

<p>While these hurried preparations were going on, the hunter remained
seated upon his mustang, looking down upon the pioneers with a
gathering calmness, as though he were a general watching the evolutions
of his army. Now and then he anxiously gazed off over the prairie,
his manner showing that he was mentally comparing the speed of
the approaching Apaches with that of the labors of his friends.</p>

<p>To Fred Munson, perched in the top of the lofty tree, the whole
scene seemed like a hurrying panorama of a dream. He never once
thought of his own personal danger, in the intensity of his interest
in what was going on before his eyes.</p>

<p>The hunter had scarcely checked his mustang when the lad saw
the Apaches appear upon a ridge some distance behind. It was less
than two miles away, and they all dashed over at the place where
the <em>avant courier</em> had come at his break-neck pace; and
as soon as they were all over, and stretching away in the direction
of the settlement, Fred had some chance of estimating their number.</p>

<p>"There must be a thousand of them," he muttered, in a terrified
voice. "They will murder us all&mdash;none can get away."</p>

<p>His imagination, however, intensified matters. The Apaches numbered
several hundred, and, armed to the teeth as they were, brave,
daring, and mounted upon the best of horses, they were as formidable
a party as if they were composed of so many white desperadoes
of the border. A month before they would have walked over this
party of pioneers; but there is no teacher like experience, and
in the long journey across the plains, marked by innumerable skirmishes
with the red-skins, the settlers had acquired a coolness and steadiness
under fire which was invaluable in such emergencies as this.</p>

<p>But Simpson still maintained his position, glancing from the
settlement below him to the approaching Apaches, with that quick,
nervous motion which showed only too plainly that he felt a crisis
was at hand, and he could delay only a few moments longer.</p>

<p>It was a thrilling sight, the hurried preparations of the pioneers,
and the swift approach of their assailants. The latter came in
no regular order, but swept along like so many Centaurs, at first
well together, but, as they approached the valley, gradually separating
and spreading out, like a slowly opening fan, until the crescent
was several hundred yards in breadth, and it looked as if they
intended to surround the settlement.</p>

<p>Such being their apparent purpose, the hunter speedily saw that
it would not do to stay another second. He had come to warn the
whites of their danger, and now that it had burst upon them, he
emphasized his good intentions by dashing down the valley, and,
leaping from the back of his mustang, took his place among a dozen
defenders who were gathered in the building with the women and
children.</p>

<p>His horse was covered with foam and sweat, for his master had
ridden like Paul Revere, and he needed the rest that was now given
him. He possessed extraordinary intelligence, and Sut knew that
he could be thoroughly depended upon in case matters got mixed,
and a stampede was attempted by the assailants.</p>

<p>There was no dilly-dallying. The most serious kind of business
impended, and all were forced to prepare for it. In a twinkling,
as it seemed, the hurry, bustle, and confusion suddenly ceased.
Everything settled down into quiet, and the defenders, with their
loaded rifles, calmly awaited the assault that was soon to be
made.</p>

<p>As the Apaches neared the valley, they gradually slackened their
speed, but all reached the margin, from which they could look
down upon the pioneers, with their steeds upon a gallop, and then,
without checking them, branched still further apart, and, speeding
down the slope, began the battle forthwith.</p>

<p>In an instant the sharp crack! crack! of rifles was heard from
different directions, as the Apaches opened fire upon the whites,
who showed an equal readiness in replying. The Indians never allowed
their steeds to rest. They were constantly in motion, back and
forth, round and round, circling here and there, seemingly at
times in inextricable confusion, but with a certain system, as
shown in the evolutions of a large party upon a stage, and with
the result of never interfering with one another's efficiency.</p>

<p>Some of the Apaches, in the very wantonness of their skillful
horsemanship, threw themselves from side to side upon the backs
of their steeds, firing under the neck or belly with as much accuracy
as if from the saddle. None of them were furnished with the regulation
saddle; some had blankets, while the most were mounted bareback.
Their skill was little short of the marvelous. Again and again,
one of the red-skins would make a lunge over the side of his animal,
as though he were going to plunge headlong into the earth; but,
catching his toe over the spine of his horse, he would sustain
himself apparently by no other means, while he kept up his fusilade.
When his horse wheeled, so as to expose the rider to the fire
of the whites, the Indian would quickly swing over the other side,
where he would continue the same demonstrations.</p>

<p>Thus it was that within five minutes after the Apaches came down
in the valley, the settlement was surrounded by the several hundred,
who were circling back and forth, and sending in their shots,
whenever the opportunity presented itself.</p>

<p>The wood to which frequent reference has been made, it will be
remembered, was situated some distance from the settlement, and,
as Fred Munson was perched in a tree upon the other side, many
of the gyrating horsemen were frequently shut out from his view
by the intervening trees; but enough was constantly in view to
keep his excitement up to the highest pitch, and to cause him
to forget his own prominence as a target.</p>

<p>As has been already said, the settlers, from behind their intrenchments,
were prompt in returning the fire of their assailants. The effect
upon persons who had never been brought in collision with Indians
would have been to bewilder and terrify them. It is very probable
that such was one of the principal objects of the Apaches in making
their attack as they did; but it failed utterly in that respect.
Carefully avoiding any exposure of themselves, they popped away
right and left, the reports of the rifles mingling together, while
the warriors, as they tumbled to the ground here and there, showed
how effectual the defense of the pioneers was.</p>

<p>The Apaches scarcely expected such a vigorous defense, and, after
losing several of their best men, they widened their circle so
as to avoid such a close range, and fired more seldom, but with
greater care.</p>

<p>New Boston was a peculiarly built, or rather laid out, city.
If Caleb Barnwell committed an absurdity in attempting to plant
a settlement in the valley of the Rio Pecos, when the entire surrounding
country was hostile, he showed some wisdom in the manner in which
he conducted matters after the attempt was made. The town was
in an irregular circle, with a grassy court in the centre, in
which were pitched their horses.</p>

<p>Knowing how indispensable these animals were to men in such circumstances,
there could be but little doubt that the Apaches would make a
desperate attempt to stampede them, and the whites were therefore
on the look-out for such an effort. Not only Sut Simpson, but
Barnwell and a number of the principal men, held fire after the
first repulse, so as to meet such an essay at the very instant
it was attempted.</p>

<p>The Apaches edged away some distance, under the galling fire
of the pioneers, until the watchful hunter saw them hurriedly
massing on the slope above. He knew the meaning of that the moment
he perceived the action.</p>

<p>"Be ready! they're coming for the animals!" he shouted, in a
voice so loud that the words were distinctly heard by Fred Munson
from his perch in the tree.</p>

<p>All those who held empty rifles hastily reloaded them, and the
others, raising the hammers of their weapons, fixed their eyes
upon the hideously painted forms, which resembled so many demons
about to sweep down upon them. There was barely time for preparation,
and in another minute the horde came rushing down the slope, like
a mountain torrent, their objective point being the square where
the horses were secured. Before they could reach them, however,
the settlers poured in their most murderous volleys, bringing
many a glaring red-skin to earth, wounding a number of their animals,
and creating such a panic that the foremost swerved off to the
right and dashed up the valley, followed by the others, while
the property of the whites remained uninjured.</p>

<p>The first attack of the Apaches resulted in a repulse, and that,
too, when led by Lone Wolf; but the peril was not past. That war-chief
had learned the situation fully, and there was no danger of his
repeating this blunder. The next time he was sure to succeed.</p>
