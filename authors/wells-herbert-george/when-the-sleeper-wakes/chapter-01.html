<P>
One afternoon, at low water, Mr. Isbister, a young
artist lodging at Boscastle, walked from that place to 
the picturesque cove of Pentargen, desiring to examine 
the caves there. Halfway down the precipitous path 
to the Pentargen beach he came suddenly upon a man 
sitting in an attitude of profound distress beneath 
a projecting mass of rock. The hands of this man 
hung limply over his knees, his eyes were red and 
staring before him, and his face was wet with tears.   
<P>
He glanced round at Isbister's footfall. Both men 
were disconcerted, Isbister the more so, and, to 
override the awkwardness of his involuntary pause, he 
remarked, with an air of mature conviction, that the 
weather was hot for the time of year.
<P>
"Very," answered the stranger shortly, hesitated a 
second, and added in a colourless tone, "I can't sleep." 
<P>
Isbister stopped abruptly. "No?" was all he said, 
but his bearing conveyed his helpful impulse.   
<P>
"It may sound incredible," said the stranger, turning 
weary eyes to Isbister's face and emphasizing his 
words with a languid hand, "but I have had no sleep
--- no sleep at all for six nights."
<P>
"Had advice?"
<P>
"Yes. Bad advice for the most part. Drugs. My
nervous system... . They are all very well for
the run of people. It's hard to explain. I dare not
take . . . sufficiently powerful drugs."
<P>
"That makes it difficult," said Isbister.
<P>
He stood helplessly in the narrow path, perplexed 
what to do. Clearly the man wanted to talk. An idea 
natural enough under the circumstances, prompted 
him to keep the conversation going. "I've never suffered 
from sleeplessness myself," he said in a tone of 
commonplace gossip, "but in those cases I have 
known, people have usually found something--"   
<P>
"I dare make no experiments."
<P>
He spoke wearily. He gave a gesture of rejection, 
and for a space both men were silent.   
<P>
"Exercise?" suggested Isbister diffidently, with a 
glance from his interlocutor's face of wretchedness to 
the touring costume he wore.   
<P>
"That is what I have tried. Unwisely perhaps. I 
have followed the coast, day after day--from New 
Quay. It has only added muscular fatigue to the mental. 
The cause of this unrest was overwork-- trouble. 
There was something--"
<P>
He stopped as if from sheer fatigue. He rubbed his 
forehead with a lean hand. He resumed speech like 
one who talks to himself.   
<P>
"I am a lone wolf, a solitary man, wandering 
through a world in which I have no part. I am wifeless--
childless--who is it speaks of the childless as
the dead twigs on the tree of life? I am wifeless,
I childless--I could find no duty to do. No desire 
even in my heart. One thing at last I set myself to do.   
<P>
"I said, I will do this, and to do it, to overcome 
the inertia of this dull body, I resorted to drugs. Great 
God, I've had enough of drugs! I don't know if __you__ 
feel the heavy inconvenience of the body, its 
exasperating demand of time from the mind--time-- 
life! Live! We only live in patches. We have 
to eat, and then comes the dull digestive complacencies--
or irritations. We have to take the air or else 
our thoughts grow sluggish, stupid, run into gulfs 
and blind alleys. A thousand distractions arise from 
within and without, and then comes drowsiness and 
sleep. Men seem to live for sleep. How little of a 
man's day is his own--even at the best! And then 
come those false friends, those Thug helpers, the 
alkaloids that stifle natural fatigue and kill rest-- 
black coffee, cocaine--"   
<P>
"I see," said Isbister.   
<P>
"I did my work," said the sleepless man with a 
querulous intonation.   
<P>
"And this is the price? "   
<P>
"Yes."   
For a little while the two remained without speaking.   
<P>
"You cannot imagine the craving for rest that I 
feel--a hunger and thirst. For six long days, since 
my work was done, my mind has been a whirlpool, 
swift, unprogressive and incessant, a torrent of 
thoughts leading nowhere, spinning round swift and
steady--"
<P>
He paused. "Towards the gulf."
<P>
"You must sleep," said Isbister decisively, and
with an air of a remedy discovered. "Certainly you
must sleep."
<P>
"My mind is perfectly lucid. It was never clearer.
But I know I am drawing towards the vortex.
Presently--"
<P>
"Yes?"
<P>
"You have seen things go down an eddy? Out of
the light of the day, out of this sweet world of sanity--
down--"
<P>
"But," expostulated Isbister.
<P>
The man threw out a hand towards him, and his
eyes were wild, and his voice suddenly high. "I shall
kill myself. If in no other way--at the foot of yonder 
dark precipice there, where the waves are green,
and the white surge lifts and falls, and that little
thread of water trembles down. There at any rate is
. . . sleep."
<P>
" That's unreasonable," said Isbister, startled at the
man's hysterical gust of emotion. "Drugs are better
than that."
<P>
" There at any rate is sleep," repeated the stranger,
not heeding him.
<P>
Isbister looked at him and wondered transitorily if
some complex Providence had indeed brought them
together that afternoon. "It's not a cert, you know,"
he remarked. " There's a cliff like that at Lulworth
Cove--as high, anyhow--and a little girl fell from
top to bottom. And lives to-day--sound and well."
<P>
"But those rocks there? "
<P>
"One might lie on them rather dismally through a
cold night, broken bones grating as one shivered, chill
water splashing over you. Eh? "
<P>
Their eyes met. "Sorry to upset your ideals," said
Isbister with a sense of devil-may-careish brilliance.
<P>
"But a suicide over that cliff (or any cliff for the matter 
of that), really, as an artist--" He laughed.
"It's so damned amateurish."
<P>
"But the other thing," said the sleepless man irritably, 
"the other thing. No man can keep sane if
night after night--"
<P>
"Have you been walking along this coast alone? "
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"Silly sort of thing to do. If you'll excuse my
saying so. Alone! As you say; body fag is no cure
for brain fag. Who told you to? No wonder;
walking! And the sun on your head, heat, fag, solitude, 
all the day long, and then, I suppose, you go to
bed and try very hard--eh?"
<P>
Isbister stopped short and looked at the sufferer
doubtfully.
<P>
"Look at these rocks!" cried the seated man with
a sudden force of gesture. "Look at that sea that
has shone and quivered there for ever! See the white
spume rush into darkness under that great cliff. And
this blue vault, with the blinding sun pouring from
the dome of it. It is your world. You accept it, you
rejoice in it. It warms and supports and delights you.
And for me--"
<P>
He turned his head and showed a ghastly face,
bloodshot pallid eyes and bloodless lips. He spoke
almost in a whisper. "It is the garment of my misery.
The whole world . . . is the garment of 
my misery."
<P>
Isbister looked at all the wild beauty of the sunlit
cliffs about them and back to that face of despair
For a moment he was silent.
<P>
He started, and made a gesture of impatient rejection. 
"You get a night's sleep," he said, "and you
won't see much misery out here. Take my word
for it."
<P>
He was quite sure now that this was a providential
encounter. Only half an hour ago he had been feeling 
horribly bored. Here was employment the bare
thought of which was righteous self-applause. He
took possession forthwith. It seemed to him that the
first need of this exhausted being was companionship
He flung himself down on the steeply sloping turf
beside the motionless seated figure, and deployed
forthwith into a skirmishing line of gossip.
<P>
His hearer seemed to have lapsed into apathy;
he stared dismally seaward, and spoke only in answer
to Isbister's direct questions--and not to all of those
But he made no sign of objection to this benevolent
intrusion upon his despair.
<P>
In a helpless way he seemed even grateful, and
when presently Isbister, feeling that his unsupported
talk was losing vigour, suggested that they should
reascend the steep and return towards Boscastle,
alleging the view into Blackapit, he submitted quietly.
Halfway up he began talking to himself, and abruptly
turned a ghastly face on his helper. "What can be
happening?" he asked with a gaunt illustrative hand.
"What can be happening? Spin, spin, spin, spin. It
goes round and round, round and round for evermore."
<P>
He stood with his hand circling
<P>
"It's all right, old chap," said Isbister with the air
of an old friend. "Don't worry yourself. Trust to
me."
<P>
The man dropped his hand and turned again. They
went over the brow in single file and to the headland
beyond Penally, with the sleepless man gesticulating
ever and again, and speaking fragmentary things 
concerning his whirling brain. At the headland they
stood for a space by the seat that looks into the dark
mysteries of Blackapit, and then he sat down. Isbister
had resumed his talk whenever the path had widened
sufficiently for them to walk abreast. He was enlarging 
upon the complex difficulty of making Boscastle
Harbour in bad weather, when suddenly and quite
irrelevantly his companion interrupted him again.
<P>
"My head is not like what it was," he said, gesticulating 
for want of expressive phrases. "It's not like
what it was. There is a sort of oppression, a weight.
No--not drowsiness, would God it were! It is like
a shadow, a deep shadow falling suddenly and swiftly
across something busy. Spin, spin into the darkness
The tumult of thought, the confusion, the eddy and
eddy. I can't express it. I can hardly keep my mind
on it--steadily enough to tell you."
<P>
He stopped feebly.
<P>
" Don't trouble, old chap," said Isbister. "I think
I can understand. At any rate, it don't matter very 
much just at present about telling me, you know."
<P>
The sleepless man thrust his knuckles into his eyes
and rubbed them. Isbister talked for awhile while
this rubbing continued, and then he had a fresh idea.
"Come down to my room," he said, "and try a pipe.
I can show you some sketches of this Blackapit. If
you'd care? "
<P>
The other rose obediently and followed him down
the steep.
<P>
Several times Isbister heard him stumble as they
came down, and his movements were slow and hesitating. 
"Come in with me," said Isbister, "and try
some cigarettes and the blessed gift of alcohol. If
you take alcohol?"
<P>
The stranger hesitated at the garden gate. He
seemed no longer clearly aware of his actions. "I
don't drink," he said slowly, coming up the garden
path, and after a moment's interval repeated absently,
"No--I don't drink. It goes round. Spin, it goes
--spin--"
<P>
He stumbled at the doorstep and entered the room
with the bearing of one who sees nothing.
<P>
Then he sat down abruptly and heavily in the easy
chair, seemed almost to fall into it. He leant forward
with his brows on his hands and became motionless.
<P>
Presently he made a faint sound in his throat.
Isbister moved about the room with the nervousness
of an inexperienced host, making little remarks that
scarcely required answering. He crossed the room
to his portfolio, placed it on the table and noticed
the mantel clock.
<P>
"I don't know if you'd care to have supper with
me," he said with an unlighted cigarette in his hand--
his mind troubled with a design of the furtive administration 
of chloral. "Only cold mutton, you know,
but passing sweet. Welsh. And a tart, I believe."
He repeated this after momentary silence.
<P>
The seated man made no answer. Isbister stopped,
match in hand, regarding him.
<P>
The stillness lengthened. The match went out, the
cigarette was put down unlit. The man was certainly
very still. Isbister took up the portfolio, opened it,
put it down, hesitated, seemed about to speak.
"Perhaps," he whispered doubtfully. Presently he
glanced at the door and back to the figure. Then he
stole on tiptoe out of the room, glancing at his 
companion after each elaborate pace.
<P>
He closed the door noiselessly. The house door
was standing open, and he went out beyond the porch,
and stood where the monkshood rose at the corner
of the garden bed. From this point he could see the
stranger through the open window, still and dim,
sitting head on hand. He had not moved.
<P>
A number of children going along the road stopped
and regarded the artist curiously. A boatman exchanged 
civilities with him. He felt that possibly his
circumspect attitude and position seemed peculiar and
unaccountable. Smoking, perhaps, might seem more
natural. He drew pipe and pouch from his pocket,
filled the pipe slowly.
<P>
"I wonder," . . . he said, with a scarcely perceptible 
loss of complacency. " At any rate we must
give him a chance." He struck a match in the virile
way, and proceeded to light his pipe.
<P>
Presently he heard his landlady behind him, coming
with his lamp lit from the kitchen. He turned, 
gesticulating with his pipe, and stopped her at the door
of his sitting-room. He had some difficulty in 
explaining the situation in whispers, for she did not
know he had a visitor. She retreated again with the
lamp, still a little mystified to judge from her manner,
and he resumed his hovering at the corner of the
porch, flushed and less at his ease.
<P>
Long after he had smoked out his pipe, and when
the bats were abroad, his curiosity dominated his
complex hesitations, and he stole back into his 
darkling sitting-room. He paused in the doorway. The
stranger was still in the same attitude, dark against
the window. Save for the singing of some sailors
aboard one of the little slate-carrying ships in the 
harbour, the evening was very still. Outside, the spikes
of monkshood and delphinium stood erect and motionless 
against the shadow of the hillside. Something
flashed into Isbister's mind; he started, and leaning
over the table, listened. An unpleasant suspicion
grew stronger; became conviction. Astonishment
seized him and became--dread!
<P>
No sound of breathing came from the seated figure!
<P>
He crept slowly and noiselessly round the table,
pausing twice to listen. At last he could lay his hand
on the back of the armchair. He bent down until the
two heads were ear to ear.
<P>
Then he bent still lower to look up at his visitor's
face. He started violently and uttered an exclamation. 
The eyes were void spaces of white.
<P>
He looked again and saw that they were open and
with the pupils rolled under the lids. He was 
suddenly afraid. Overcome by the strangeness of the
man's condition, he took him by the shoulder and
shook him. "Are you asleep?" he said, with his voice
jumping into alto, and again, "Are you asleep?"
<P>
A conviction took possession of his mind that this
man was dead. He suddenly became active and
noisy, strode across the room, blundering against the
table as he did so, and rang the bell.
<P>
"Please bring a light at once," he said in the passage. 
"There is something wrong with my friend."
<P>
Then he returned to the motionless seated figure,
grasped the shoulder, shook it, and shouted. The
room was flooded with yellow glare as his astonished
landlady entered with the light. His face was white
as he turned blinking towards her. "I must fetch
a doctor at once," he said. "It is either death or a
fit. Is there a doctor in the village? Where is a
doctor to be found? "
