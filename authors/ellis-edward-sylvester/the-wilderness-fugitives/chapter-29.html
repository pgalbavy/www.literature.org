<p>Ned and Jo had said nothing to each other about the continued
absence of the Mohawk, for whatever they might utter would necessarily
be conjecture, and would only excite the alarm of Rosa without
accomplishing any good. But it was in the thoughts of both, and
when Ned bade the two good-bye for a season, it occupied more
of his speculations than did the movements of the man who had
played them false.</p>

<p>"One can never lose faith in Lena-Wingo, and yet the pitcher
may go to the fountain once too often," he mused, as he picked
his way with the greatest care. "And that great scout is likely
to fall at any time. A single rifle ball may do it, and he cannot
tell whether there is not more than one of his own race in hiding,
waiting patiently till he shall come that way and receive his
death. He has escaped so often that he must become careless of
his own safety, and will pay the penalty one of these days."</p>

<p>Ned had fixed the route so clearly in his own mind that he found
no difficulty in retracing the steps taken when he was following
the leadership of Worrell. He was apprehensive that he would meet
him on his return, probably with a number of Indians. He therefore
picked his way with all the care and stealth of which he was master.
He imitated the actions of Lena-Wingo under similar circumstances.
Frequently pausing and listening for sounds of his enemies, he
used his eyes as keenly as he could for the detection of the first
sign of approaching danger. This kind of progress was not of the
most rapid order, but it was the wisest that could have been adopted,
and he continued it for half an hour. At the end of that time,
he reached the base of the tree from the branches of which he
fired the shot that brought Worrell from behind the rock.</p>

<p>"Here is where we met him," he said to himself, "and I have a
feeling that he isn't very far away now. What a wise girl Rosa
is!" he added, with a blush, as if fearful she had heard the complimentary
words. "She mistrusted that villain from the first, and gave us
the alarm just in time to save ourselves."</p>

<p>Having reached the spot for which he set out, the question with
the youth was whether he should stay where he was or go further.
He had seen nothing of Lena-Wingo and Worrell&mdash;a disappointment
in both cases, though of a different nature.</p>

<p>"I can't see why the Indian stays away so long, unless something
unusual has happened. He must know how much we are alarmed over
his absence, and he would be back if it were possible."</p>

<p>Waiting a short time, he concluded to advance a little farther,
so as to meet either of the two men if they were approaching,
while at a greater distance from the cavern, though he was not
unmindful that he was liable to miss them altogether. However,
he had gone less than a hundred yards when he detected the signs
of some one coming immediately in front. It was his ear which
heard a crackling of a twig, so close that he had barely time
to leap aside and conceal himself from view when the figure of
Worrell, closely followed by Captain Bagley, came up a sort of
path toward the open space from which Ned had fled in such haste.
The youth barely caught sight of them when the forms of six Iroquois
appeared, one by one, immediately in the rear of the two white
men.</p>

<p>When Ned saw the latter, he was much concerned, fearing that
they would detect the slight trail he must have left in his hurry
for cover. But it was too late to make any further flight, as
he would be discovered from the noise, if not by the sight.</p>

<p>From his concealment he watched the party, their manner of marching
being peculiar, as the eight walked in Indian file. Worrell, being
the guide, took the lead. Bagley kept so close that they could
hold a conversation in low tones, while the Iroquois stalked along
like so many phantoms of the wood.</p>

<p>If Ned was alarmed at sight of the redmen, knowing their skill
in detecting and following a trail of an enemy, he was thrown
into a cold perspiration of dread when the whole party halted
in the open space from which he had bounded when he heard the
crackling twig. The clear space covered something like an eighth
of an acre, and Clinton was too disturbed to notice that the particular
spot where the group was gathered was so far removed from his
footprints that there was really little danger of their being
noticed. But when they had stood awhile, and the two white men
began a conversation, he noticed the gratifying fact and became
composed enough to listen to the words that passed between Captain
Bagley and Worrell.</p>

<p>"You may say what you please," said the former, "but there is
more risk in this business than I want to assume. You are so anxious
to get the reward promised by Colonel Butler that you can't see
the difficulties in the way."</p>

<p>"If there were any difficulties I would see them, but they ain't
there. Where's the difficulty in eight armed men taking possession
of two who are asleep, and a woman who is also unconscious?"</p>

<p>"None, of course, when you put it in that way; but the Mohawk
is somewhere about, and, as I told you a while ago, he has a way
of turning up just when you don't want to see him."</p>

<p>"These Iroquois say they want to meet him, and if he is there,
they'll have the chance."</p>

<p>"But I ain't anxious to meet him, and if he is about, as I feel
in my bones he is, there'll be the mischief to pay."</p>

<p>Worrell uttered an imprecation. He had been obliged to keep up
an argument with the captain ever since they started from the
house with the Indians&mdash;even before; and now the man had halted
again, more loth than ever to proceed. It was plain that he held
the Mohawk in great fear.</p>

<p>"Where is this cave in which you say the party are asleep?" he
asked, in reply to the explanation of the guide.</p>

<p>"You have only to go a little way further with me and you'll
see it," replied Worrell, who was evidently unwilling that any
one should share so valuable a secret with him.</p>

<p>"Colonel Butler has all of twenty of the best Iroquois with him,
and the wisest thing for us is to go to his camp, tell him how
the case stands, and get him to let us have eight or ten more;
then we can come back and lay regular siege to the place. Then
we shall be sure of catching them sooner or later."</p>

<p>"Yes, at the end of a month or so, and it won't do for Butler
to stay much longer in the valley. He knows it, and will leave
in a day or two."</p>

<p>"But why speak of waiting a month before they can be taken, when
thirst and starvation will bring them to terms in a couple of
days at the most?"</p>

<p>"It will, eh?" said Worrell, contemptuously. "There is a spring
of water in one corner of the cavern, and they have enough provisions
stored there to last all of a month."</p>

<p>"How came the provisions in that place?"</p>

<p>"I took them there myself, for I have used the cave many a time."</p>

<p>This was a falsehood, so far as the water and food were concerned,
the cavern containing nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>"Do not any of these Iroquois know where the place is?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, and there is no danger of the Mohawk finding
it under two or three days' hunt."</p>

<p>"You needn't tell me such stuff as that," said Captain Bagley.
"There's nothing that you can hide from him."</p>

<p>"This is a pretty crowd that is afraid to go forward because
there happens to be a single Indian somewhere in the woods. If
you want to stay behind, let me have the warriors, and I will
take them to the spot, and deliver the three into the hands of
Colonel Butler inside of an hour. What do you say to that?"</p>

<p>"You are so determined, you may lead on, and we'll follow."</p>

<p>"Well, let's do it, then, without any more&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that instant, the crack of a rifle broke the stillness, and
the man Worrell threw up his hand and fell forward on his face,
dead!</p>
