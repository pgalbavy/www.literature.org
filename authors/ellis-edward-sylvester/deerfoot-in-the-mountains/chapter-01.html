<p>Deerfoot the Shawanoe, Mul-tal-la the Blackfoot, and the twin
brothers, George and Victor Shelton, had completed their long
journey from the Ohio River to the Pacific slope, and, standing
on an elevation near the Columbia, spent hours in looking out
upon the face of the mightiest ocean of the globe. They feasted
their vision on the magnificent scene, with the miles of wilderness,
mountain, vale, river and Indian villages spread between their
feet and the ocean.</p>

<p>It was a picture worth journeying across the continent to see.
From beyond the convex world a ship had sailed up to view, its
snowy sails looking at first like a tiny but growing cloud in
the soft sky. As the craft drew steadily nearer, they saw it careening
to one side under the impulse of the wind against the bellying
canvas, while the curling foam at the bows spread out like a fan
and dissolved in the clear waters beyond the stern.</p>

<p>Deerfoot had taken the glass after Mul-tal-la was through, and
he stood for a long time gazing at the waste of waters. None spoke,
for there was that in the scene and the occasion which made all
thoughtful. The grandeur, the majesty, the vastness filled them
with awe and held them mute. Finally, the Shawanoe lowered the
instrument, and turning toward the boys, said gravely, as he pointed
first to the east and then to the west:</p>

<p>"Yonder is the endless forest of wood, and yonder the endless
forest of water; they shall all become the home of the white man."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt you are right," replied George Shelton, "but it
will be hundreds of years after you and I are dead; there is room
between here and the Ohio for millions upon millions, but where
will they come from?"</p>

<p>"The white men will become like the leaves in the forest and
the sands on the seashore; no one can count the numbers that will
overspread the land; they will be everywhere."</p>

<p>"And what of your own people, Deerfoot?" asked Victor.</p>

<p>The dusky youth shook his head, as if the problem was beyond
him.</p>

<p>"The two ought to live in peace side by side, for such is the
will of the Great Spirit. The white man cannot become like the
red man, but the red man may grow into the ways of the pale-faces,
and all may be brothers, and so live till time shall be no more."</p>

<p>The theme was too profound for the youths, though it was manifest
that the Shawanoe had given much thought to it. He added nothing,
and while the day was young they walked back to the Columbia,
re-entered the canoe and headed up stream.</p>

<p>Henceforward their work was different from that which they faced
when descending the river. There were long stretches where, despite
the current, the dusky boatmen found no special trouble in driving
the craft eastward; but, as they progressed, the labor became
severer, for the stream narrowed and the velocity of its flow
became greater. The portages were long and toilsome, and, as the
party advanced, many places were met where these portages became
necessary on account of the rapidity of the current alone. All,
however, bent resolutely to work, Victor and George taxing their
strength to the utmost. Deerfoot seemed tireless, but he could
never be inconsiderate to others. He could have outworn Mul-tal-la,
though not till after the exhaustion of the boys, who agreed between
themselves that the job was the biggest they had ever tackled;
and yet their adult companions not only did the work the twins
were doing, but swung the paddles in addition.</p>

<p>Our friends stayed one night at the Echeloot or Upper Chinook
village, which they had visited when coming down the river. You
will remember that it was there they first saw wooden houses made
by Indians. The explorers were treated as hospitably as before,
but, as you will also recall, the natives were Flatheads, and
the sight of the misshapen skulls, towering at the rear like the
ridge of a roof, was so disagreeable that the travelers were glad
to turn their backs upon them.</p>

<p>You have not forgotten the thrilling descent of the Falls of
the Columbia, where all the skill of Deerfoot and Mul-tal-la was
needed to save the canoe from being dashed upon the rocks.</p>

<p>"Are you going to paddle through them again?" asked Victor.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot does not wish to see his brother scared so bad as he
was before."</p>

<p>"I was about to say that if you and Mul-tal-la don't feel equal
to the task, George and I are ready to take it off your hands."</p>

<p>"The heart of Deerfoot is made glad to hear the words of his
brother," replied the Shawanoe, handing his paddle to the youth.
Not expecting that, Victor scratched his head and looked quizzically
at George.</p>

<p>"Shall we show those fellows how to do such things?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it is worth while; they won't appreciate it."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is sorry," was all that was said by the Shawanoe, as
the boat was drawn out of the waters and hoisted upon the shoulders
of the party.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe gave another illustration of his stern principles
when, at the close of day, the canoe was run into shore at the
point where the travelers had encamped beside the pile of lumber
from which they were led to take what fuel they needed through
the misrepresentation of the three Indians who called upon them.
The night was one of the coldest of several weeks, and at their
elbows, as may be said, was enough fuel to make them comfortable
for months.</p>

<p>The brothers looked longingly at the mass of lumber, but did
not dare touch it in the presence of their friend.</p>

<p>"I wonder if we can't persuade him to look the other way for
a little while," said Victor in a low tone to George.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't make any difference if he did&mdash;he would see us just
the same; the only thing to do is to appeal to his common sense."</p>

<p>"You try it; he won't pay any attention to me."</p>

<p>"See here," said the shivering lad; "it seems to me, Deerfoot,
that since we have already stolen some lumber from that pile,
it can't be any harm to steal a little more; you see, with your
good sense, that it will be only taking two bites from the same
apple."</p>

<p>The Shawanoe looked gravely at his young friends, whom no one
understood better than he, and abruptly asked:</p>

<p>"How much do two and two make?"</p>

<p>"As near as I can figure out," interposed Victor, "the answer
to that problem is four."</p>

<p>"When we used the wood we thought we had the right to take it;
we should pay the owner if we could find him. If we use any of
it now it will be a sin, as sure as two and two make four, for
we know it belongs to another; it is better to freeze than to
steal wood. Deerfoot does not wish to hear his brothers say anything
more."</p>

<p>"I suppose he is right," growled Victor, "but doesn't he draw
it mighty fine? We may as well prepare to spend one of the worst
nights we have had since leaving the Ohio."</p>

<p>The canoe was drawn up the bank and then turned over, so as to
shield the property beneath. Then the blankets were spread so
that the four lay near one another and thus secured mutual warmth.
The region had become familiar to our friends because of their
former visit, and they knew that all the natives were friendly.
Deerfoot, therefore, said there was no need of mounting guard.
They had eaten enough dried salmon to stay the pangs of hunger,
though the boys would have relished something warm and more palatable.</p>

<p>All slept soundly, and the night passed without the slightest
disturbance from prowling man or animal. Victor Shelton was the
first to awake. He was lying on his side with his back against
that of his brother, and his face so covered by his blanket that
only a small orifice was left through which to breathe. His first
sensation was that of pressure, as if a heavy weight was distributed
over the blanket and was bearing him down. He moved his arm and
found that the blanket, from some cause, was really heavier than
usual. A vigorous flirt freed his shoulder from the wrapping,
and he then saw the cause of the peculiar feeling he had noticed:
the earth was covered with several inches of snow. Anyone coming
upon the camp in the gray light of morning would have noted nothing
but the mass of lumber, the flowing river, the overturned canoe
and several white mounds. The snowfall had ceased, and fortunately
there had been a considerable rise of temperature. The snow was
soft and wet, and one could move about without extra protection,
and not suffer from cold.</p>

<p>Victor lay still for a minute or two, engaged in thinking. Then
he gently pushed the blanket off his shoulder and body, so as
to leave his limbs free. With the same stealth he rose to his
feet and looked around. There lay his three friends, encased even
to their heads and feet in the warm protection.</p>

<p>"I think there couldn't be a better time for me to settle my
accounts with you fellows," muttered the lad, looking down on
the mounds.</p>

<p>"Master George Shelton, you have a bad habit of making slurring
remarks about my walking pretty fast from the wounded antelope,
forgetting that by doing so I drew him on to his own destruction.
You need a lesson and I'm going to give it to you.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mul-tal-la, you didn't say much at the time I was explaining
that little matter to George, but I saw the grin on your face,
and I knew you were thinking a good deal more than you had any
right to think. You need to be taught better manners.</p>

<p>"As for you, Mr. Deerfoot, you are the worst of all. I can't
forget the scandalous tricks you have played on me. It will take
a long time to even matters between us, but I'm going to make
a good start to-day."</p>

<p>Knowing how lightly the Shawanoe slept, Victor picked his way
with great skill until he had taken a dozen or more steps. The
down-like carpet enabled him to do this absolutely without noise,
a fact which explains why Deerfoot did not awake.</p>

<p>Victor now stooped and began silently manufacturing snowballs.
He packed the soft substance as hard as he could while circling
it about in his palms and rounding it into shape. When the missile
suggested a 12-pound shot he laid it at his feet, with the whispered
words:</p>

<p>"That's for you, Master George Shelton."</p>

<p>The second sphere was compressed and modeled with the same pains
and placed beside the first.</p>

<p>"That's for you, Mr. Mul-tal-la, and you're going to get it good!
As for you, Mr. Deerfoot, you shall have a double dose."</p>

<p>Crooking his left arm at the elbow, Victor laid three of the
nicely molded snowballs in the hollow, which served as a quiver
serves for arrows. The fourth missile was grasped in his right
hand, and he drew it slowly back and sighted carefully at his
brother. Victor was a fine thrower, and when the ball flashed
from his hand it landed on the top of George's cap and burst into
fragments. The sleeper was in the midst of a dream in which Zigzag
played a leading part, and the youth's first impression was that
he had received the full force of a kick on his crown.</p>

<p>Paying no further attention to him, Victor quickly let fly at
Mul-tal-la, and the throw was as good as the first.</p>

<p>The disturbance, slight as it was, roused Deerfoot, who flung
the blanket off his face and raised his head. He was just in time
to receive the compact sphere between the eyes, and before he
could dodge the second it landed on his ear, packed the passage
full of snow and plastered the side of his face with the snowy
particles.</p>

<p>"I meant those for you and here's another!" shouted Victor, who,
having exhausted his ammunition, snatched up a handful of snow
and began hastily molding a new missile.</p>

<p>"You needn't scramble and claw about! I've got you down and I'm
going to pay you for beating me at wrestling, for tickling my
nose, for stealing my clothes when I was swimming, and"&#11834;</p>

<p>The reason why the lad ceased his remarks so abruptly was because
a snowball, fired as if from a cannon, crashed into his mouth
that instant and half strangled him. Before he could pull himself
together he knew his nose was flattened by another missile and
Deerfoot was on the point of launching a third shot. This was
more than Victor had bargained for, and, wheeling, he "ran for
life," yelling at the top of his voice for George and Mul-tal-la
to come to his help.</p>

<p>"Soak him, George! Give it to him, Mul-tal-la; don't you see
he's killing me?"</p>

<p>Now, there was no reason why the two thus appealed to should
heed the prayer, since each had suffered at the hands of the youth
who was in extremity. Nevertheless, Mul-tal-la and George attacked
Deerfoot, observing which, Victor was unprincipled enough to turn
back and join the assailants. Thus the Shawanoe was forced to
defend himself against three, every one of whom was a good thrower.
Right bravely did the dusky youth do his work&mdash;never yielding
an inch, but driving his missiles right and left, with the merciless
accuracy and the power of an arrow from his bow, or a bullet from
his rifle. So lightning-like were his throws that neither the
man nor the boys were able to dodge them, unless they widened
the space between themselves and their master. Deerfoot's last
missile cracked like a pistol when the ball impinged against the
side of Mul-tal-la's head, and the latter gave up the contest.</p>

<p>This left only the boys. The Shawanoe hastily fashioned a couple
of balls, and with one in either hand started for the brothers,
who called out, "Enough!" and flung their own ammunition to the
ground in token of surrender. He looked from one to the other
and said:</p>

<p>"Let us not stop; Deerfoot is beginning to like it."</p>

<p>"That's the trouble," replied George; "you like it too much;
I don't want any more; maybe Victor does."</p>

<p>"I'll do my own talking," replied the latter; "didn't you see
me throw down my snowball? What do you 'spose I did that for?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you throw it at Deerfoot?" asked the Shawanoe. "The shot
came as near hitting him as some of those you threw."</p>

<p>"We'll take up the fight again some time," was the vague promise
of Victor, panting from his exertion.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot hopes you will do so."</p>

<p>But the good-natured contest was never renewed. Not again could
the lads expect to have such a golden opportunity, and their defeat
was so decisive that they knew better than to repeat it.</p>

<p>The labor of the return grew heavier as they progressed, and
the time came when it was so hard to make headway against the
powerful current that the effort was given up. The last few miles
became a real portage, though when our friends were descending
the river the passage could not have been easier.</p>

<p>And so in due time the four reached the Nez Perce village, where
they had left their horses and some of their property. Henceforth
the journey to the Blackfoot country was to be made by land. The
former task had proved one of the severest of their lives, and
glad indeed were all when it was over.</p>
