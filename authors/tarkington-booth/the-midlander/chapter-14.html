<p><em>ADMITTED </em>by a coloured housemaid who drowsily said,
"Yes’m, she still up," in response to his inquiry, Harlan had
only to step into the Shelbys’ marble-floored "front hall" to
dispel his slight doubts concerning the identity of Martha’s callers;
his brother was unquestionably one of them.</p>

<p>The heavy doors leading from the hall into the drawing-room sheltering
Mr. Shelby’s Corot were closed, but Dan’s voice was audible and
although his words were indistinguishable he was evidently in
high spirits and holding forth upon some subject that required
a great deal of emphatic expounding. Harlan stepped forward to
open the doors and go in but halted abruptly, for at this moment
Martha made her appearance at the other end of the hall. She came
from the rear of the house and carried an oval silver tray whereon
gleamed, among delicate napery and china, a silver coffee pot
of unusually ample dimensions.</p>

<p>Her serious but untroubled look was upon the tray; then she glanced
up, saw Harlan, and in surprise uttered a vague sound of exclamation.
He went quickly toward her, but before he reached her she nodded
to the housemaid in dismissal. "You can go to bed now, Emma."</p>

<p>"Yes’m, thank you," said Emma. "I’m full ready," she added, as
she disappeared.</p>

<p>"I came over because I was afraid you——" Harlan began.</p>

<p>But Martha interrupted him at once. "You needn’t be," she said.
"There’s nothing the matter."</p>

<p>"I only thought their coming here—disturbing you at this hour——"</p>

<p>"It doesn’t disturb me," she said. "It isn’t very late."</p>

<p>"But wouldn’t your father——"</p>

<p>At that Martha laughed. "The chandelier in there fell down one
night last winter, and <em>it</em> didn’t wake him up! At least
I do run the house when he’s asleep. Don’t look so tragic!"</p>

<p>"But I’m afraid they——"</p>

<p>"It’s nothing at all, Harlan. I’d gone upstairs, but not to bed,
when the bell rang; and when Emma told me Dan and Fred Oliphant
were here, I came down and brought them in and lit the fire for
them. They <em>were</em> rather damp!"</p>

<p>"But why didn’t you——"</p>

<p>"Send them home? Because Dan wanted to tell me all about the
baby."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!"</p>

<p>"Not at all!" she said; and as his expression still remained
gloomy, she laughed. "Won’t you open the door for me? I made coffee
for them because I thought it might do them good—especially your
cousin Fred."</p>

<p>Harlan uttered an exclamation of reproach addressed to himself:
"Idiot! To let you stand there holding that heavy tray!" He would
have taken it from her, but she objected.</p>

<p>"No; you might spill something. Just open the door for me."</p>

<p>He obeyed, then followed her into the drawing-room and closed
the door. Before him, in a damask-covered armchair, was seated
his second cousin, Mr. Frederic Oliphant, a young gentleman of
considerable pretensions to elegance, especially when he had spent
an evening at the club. In fact, since the installation of this
club, which the well-to-do of the town had not recognized as a
necessary bit of comfort until recently, Fred had formed the habit
of arriving home every evening with such a complete set of eighteenth-century
manners that there was no little uneasiness about him in his branch
of the Oliphant family.</p>

<p>At present he was leaning forward in his chair, a hand politely
cupped about his ear to give an appearance of more profound attention
to what Dan was saying. The latter stood at the other end of the
room, before the fire, and with great earnestness addressed this
ardent listener; but Harlan was relieved to see that although
his brother’s eyes were extraordinarily bright and his cheeks
ruddier than usual, there appeared no other symptoms, except his
eloquence, of his dalliance at the club. "No, and always no!"
he was protesting as the door opened. "If we lose that, we lose
everything! This country——"</p>

<p>But here Fred sprang up to take the tray from Martha. "Permit
me! Indeed permit me!" he begged. "It must not be said of an Oliphant
that he allowed a lady to perform menial——"</p>

<p>"No, no!" She laughed, and evading his assistance, set the tray
upon a table. "Do sit down, Fred."</p>

<p>"Since it is <em>you</em> who command it!" he said gallantly
and returned to his chair; but on the way perceived the gloomy
Harlan and bowed to him. "My dear sir!" he said. "This is an honour
as unexpected as it is gracious; an honour not only to our hostess
but to——"</p>

<p>"Sit down!" Harlan said brusquely.</p>

<p>"Since it is <em>you</em> who command it!" the other returned
with the happy air of a man who delivers an entirely novel bit
of repartee; then bowed again and complied.</p>

<p>Dan came forward from his place before the fire. "Why, Harlan!"
he exclaimed. "I thought you went to spend the evening with grandma."</p>

<p>"I did," Harlan returned, and added pointedly: "Several hours
ago!"</p>

<p>"But it isn’t late, is it?"</p>

<p>"No," Martha said quickly;—"it isn’t. Won’t you both please sit
down and let me give you some coffee?"</p>

<p>"Really——" Harlan began, but she checked him and had her way;
though Dan did not sit down. Instead, he returned to the fireplace
with the coffee she gave him. "What I was tryin’ to explain to
Fred when you came in," he said;—"it was something I don’t think
he understood at all, but I believe <em>you</em> would, Martha."</p>

<p>"I beg you; I beg you," the courtly Frederic interposed. "I was
never gifted, yet I understood you perfectly. You said, ‘If we
lose that, we lose everything.’ I think you must have been speaking
of champagne."</p>

<p>"No, no," Dan said, and for a moment appeared to be slightly
annoyed; then he brightened. "I told you several times I meant
our work for the new generation. The minute a man gets to be a
father he belongs to the <em>old</em> generation, and the only
use he is, it’s to plan for the new one. From then on, that’s
what his whole life ought to be—just buildin’ up the world for
his son. Now you take this boy o’ mine——"</p>

<p>"Excuse me," his cousin interrupted earnestly. "You’re referring
now to the one who was born late this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"I mean my <em>boy</em>!" Dan replied; and his face glowed with
the triumphant word. "I have a son! Didn’t you know it?"</p>

<p>"It’s been mentioned, I believe, during the evening," Frederic
answered. "Excuse me, pray."</p>

<p>"When he grows up," Dan went on radiantly, "he’s got to find
everything better because of the work the old generation’s got
to do to make it that way. That’s what we’re put in the world
<em>for</em>! I never knew what I was for until to-day. I knew
I was meant for <em>something</em>; I knew I ought to be makin’
plans and tryin’ to build <em>up</em>; but I didn’t see just what
for. I thought I did, but I didn’t. That’s what I wanted to explain
to Martha, because she’s the only one that could understand. It’s
the reason for the universe."</p>

<p>"You surprise me," Frederic remarked; and he replaced his cup
with careful accuracy upon its saucer on the arm of his chair.
"Correct me if I fail to follow you, but are you fair to your
son? If he’s the reason for the universe he ought to be able to
grasp a few simple truths. You say Martha is the only person who
could understand, but have you even tried to make <em>him</em>
understand?"</p>

<p>Dan laughed happily, in high good humour. "That boy’ll understand
soon enough!" he cried. "You wait till he’s old enough for me
to drive him out to Ornaby and let him look it over and see where
his father fought, bled, and died to build it for him! You wait
till he learns to drive an automobile from his father’s and his
uncle’s own factory!"</p>

<p>"His uncle’s?" Frederic repeated, turning to Harlan. "Forgive
me if I trespass upon private ground, but I haven’t heard——"</p>

<p>"I have nothing to do with it," Harlan said, frowning with an
annoyance that had been increasing since his entrance into the
room. "He means his wife’s brother." He leaned toward Martha,
who sat looking quietly at the radiant Dan. "Did you ever hear
wilder nonsense?" he said in a low voice. "I really suspect he’s
a little mad. Do tell us to go home."</p>

<p>"No, no," she whispered, and returned her attention instantly
to Dan, who was explaining to his cousin.</p>

<p>"My brother-in-law in New York, George McMillan, wrote me he’d
got hold of an engineer who’d made designs for a wonderful improvement
in automobile engines. McMillan wants to come out here, and he
and I think of goin’ into it together. We want to build a factory
over on the west edge of Ornaby, where it won’t interfere with
the residential section."</p>

<p>"The residential section?" his cousin repeated in a tone of gentle
inquiry. "Do I comprehend you? It’s over where you’ve got that
tool shed?"</p>

<p>"<em>No</em>, sir!" Dan exclaimed triumphantly. "We moved the
tool shed this very morning because yesterday the lot it stood
on was sold. Yes, sir; Ornaby Addition has begun to exist!"</p>

<p>At this Martha’s quiet attitude altered; she leaned forward and
clapped her hands. "Dan! Is it true? Have you sold some lots?"</p>

<p>"The first one," he answered proudly. "The very first lot was
sold the day before my son was born!"</p>

<p>"How splendid!" she cried. "And they’ll build on it right away?"</p>

<p>"No; not right away," he admitted. "That is, not much of a house,
so to speak. It was bought by a man that wants to own a small
picnic ground of his own, because he’s got a large family; and
at first he’s only goin’ to have a sort of shack there. But he
<em>will</em> build when he sees the other houses goin’ up all
around him."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said Frederic Oliphant. "Which other houses are
you mentioning now?"</p>

<p>"The houses that <em>will</em> go up there," Dan returned promptly.
"The houses that’ll be there for my young son to see."</p>

<p>"Your ‘young son?’" Fred repeated. "Your son is still young yet,
then? It’s remarkable when you consider he’s the meaning of the
universe. You feel that when he grows up he’ll have houses to
look at?"</p>

<p>Dan’s chest expanded with the great breath he took; his high
colour grew higher, his bright eyes brighter. "Just <em>think</em>
what he’ll have to look at when he grows up! Why, the nurse let
me hold him a few minutes, and I got to thinkin’ about how I’m
goin’ to work for him, and then about how this country’s moved
ahead every minute since it was begun, goin’ ahead faster and
faster till now it just jumps out from under your feet if you
stand still a <em>second</em>—and it grows so big and it grows
so magnificent that when I thought of what sort of a world it’s
goin to be for my son, I declare I was almost afraid to look at
him; it was like lookin’ at somebody that’s born to be a god!"</p>

<p>He spoke with such honest fervour, and with such belief in what
he said, that, for the moment, even his bibulous cousin said nothing,
but sat in an emotional silence, staring at him. As for Martha,
an edge of tears suddenly showed along her eyelids; but Harlan
was not so susceptible. "Dear me!" he said dryly. "After that
burst of eloquence don’t you think we’d better be starting for
home? At least it would avoid an anti-climax."</p>

<p>Dan had been so rapt in his moment of vision, his exultant glimpse
of a transcendent world for his son’s heritage, that his brother’s
dry voice confused him;—he was like a balloonist who unexpectedly
finds the earth rising swiftly to meet him. "What?" he said blankly;
and then, as secondary perceptions clarified Harlan’s suggestion
to him, he laughed. "Why, yes; of course we ought to be goin’;
we mustn’t keep Martha up," he said. "Harlan, you always do find
a way to make me look mighty ridiculous. I guess I am, too!"</p>

<p>With that, shaking his head and laughing, he brought his cup
and saucer to the tray upon the table beside Martha, and turned
to her. "Good-night, Martha. I guess I talk like a fool, but you
know it doesn’t happen every day, my gettin’ to be a father! I
want to bring him over to see you the first time they’ll let him
outdoors. I want you to be his godmother, Martha. I want you to
help bring him up." She rose, and he took her hand as he said
good-night again; and then, going toward the door, he added cheerfully,
with a complete unconsciousness that there might be thought something
a little odd about such a speech: "What I hope most is, I hope
he’ll grow up to be like <em>you</em>!"</p>

<p>Martha’s colour deepened as she met Harlan’s gaze for an instant;
and she turned quickly to say good-night to the solemn Frederic,
who was bowing profoundly before her. "Permit me, indeed," he
murmured, and followed Dan out into the hall.</p>

<p>Thus, for a moment, Martha and Harlan were alone together; and
he stepped nearer to her. "Mother wanted me to apologize for him,"
he said. "I do hope you’ll——"</p>

<p>"Apologize for him?" she echoed incredulously. "Why? Don’t you
suppose I’m glad he wanted to come here?"</p>

<p>"But under the circumstances——"</p>

<p>"No," she said proudly. "I’d always be glad—under any circumstances."</p>

<p>He looked at her, smiled with a melancholy humour not devoid
of some compassion for her, as well as for himself, and assented
in a rueful voice, "I suppose so!" But, having turned to go, he
paused and asked wistfully: "Are there any circumstances under
which anything <em>I</em> could do would make you glad?"</p>

<p>"In some ways, why, of course," she answered with a cordiality
that did not hearten him; for he sighed, understanding in what
ways he had no power to make her glad.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, and, straightening his drooped shoulders,
strode out to join his brother and cousin in the hall.</p>

<p>Young Mr. Frederic Oliphant was lost in a thoughtful silence
while the three went down the path to the gate, but as they passed
this portal, his attention was caught by external circumstances.
"Excuse me if I appear to seek assistance upon a point of natural
history," he said;—"but wasn’t it raining or something when we
came in here?" And, being assured that rain had fallen at the
time he mentioned, he went on: "That makes it all the more remarkable,
my not noticing it’s cleared up until we got all the way out here
to the sidewalk. I was thinking about Dan’s speech."</p>

<p>"Never you mind about my ‘speech.’" Dan returned jovially. "You’ll
make speeches yourself if you ever have a son. I could make speeches
all night long! Want to hear me?"</p>

<p>"Don’t begin till we reach your gate," Fred said. "I’m going
to leave you and Harlan there and go back to the club. But when
I spoke of your speech I didn’t mean the one you made over by
the fireplace, the one all about your son’s being the meaning
of the universe and gods and everything. I meant your last speech—not
a speech exactly, but what you said to Martha."</p>

<p>"I didn’t say anything to her except ‘good-night.’"</p>

<p>"It <em>seemed</em> to me you did," Fred said apologetically.
"I may be wrong, but it seemed to me you said something more.
Didn’t it seem so to you, Harlan?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it did," Harlan answered briefly. The group had paused
at the Oliphants’ gate, and he opened it, about to pass within.</p>

<p>But his cousin detained him. "Wait a moment, I mean about Dan’s
hoping the baby would grow up to look like Martha. Didn’t it strike
you——"</p>

<p>Dan laughed. "Oh, that? No; I said something about hoping he’d
grow up to be like her: I meant I hoped he’d have her qualities."</p>

<p>"I see," young Mr. Oliphant said pensively. "The only reason
it struck me as peculiar was I thought that was what the father
usually said to the mother."</p>

<p>Thereupon he lifted his hat politely, bowed and walked away,
leaving both of the brothers staring after him. </p>
