<p>"He's either the biggest wretch among the Shawanoes," said Wharton,
"always excepting Blazing Arrow, or he is working like a major
to help us."</p>

<p>"Look at him!"</p>

<p>The Indian whom they were discussing was standing in the same
position as before, but was excitedly beckoning for them to approach.</p>

<p>Both boys broke into a trot and quickly joined him.</p>

<p>"Dat Blazing Arrow," said Arqu-wao; "he kill white folks."</p>

<p>"How is it that he and the others did not kill my father and
mother as they rode along the trail?"</p>

<p>"No see 'em," was the quick reply.</p>

<p>"But why not? I do not understand."</p>

<p>"Arqu-wao no tell&mdash;don't know&mdash;not be looking."</p>

<p>This, apparently, was the explanation possible, but it did not
satisfy the youths.</p>

<p>"Come wid me," said the Shawanoe, motioning the boys to follow
him, which, despite their anxiety, they did.</p>

<p>"See dere&mdash;eh&mdash;see dat?"</p>

<p>The Indian stooped, and with his forefinger almost on the ground,
pointed to the imprint of a shoe. It was not made by a moccasin,
but by a regular heavy-soled shoe or boot.</p>

<p>"Who made that?" asked the astonished Wharton.</p>

<p>"White man," replied Arqu-wao, with almost a chuckle. "White
man like him on hoss&mdash;he friend &mdash;Blazing Arrow don't know
dat."</p>

<p>It seemed incredible that this half-demented creature had discovered
signs which had escaped the eye of the fierce Shawanoe leader
and his companions, but such was the fact, as afterwards came
to light.</p>

<p>After much labored explanation, the guide made clear to the boys
a state of facts hitherto unsuspected by them, whose existence
they still half doubted.</p>

<p>A white man from the block-house had passed over the trail after
the two horses. This was readily determined by studying his footprints
where they interfered with those of the animals. He had walked
at a rapid gait, as was evidenced by the length of the stride.
In all probability he was an experienced ranger, for even while
following the path he made an effort to hide his footprints. It
was only at rare intervals that he stepped in the trail itself;
he had generally walked at the side, where the leaves and harder
earth hid the impressions from sight.</p>

<p>Had Blazing Arrow and his companions been searching for this
stranger's footprints it is not to be supposed that they would
have missed them, for their eyes were as keen as those of Arqu-wao,
but the presumption was that they were not looking for them.</p>

<p>The rapid stride of the strange white man was accepted by the
guide as a proof that he was trying to overtake those on horseback.
It might be that, after their departure from the block-house,
news had reached the small garrison there of the ambush the couple
were liable to run into, and this runner had set out to warn them;
or it might be that he had struck the trail a short distance off,
and was seeking to join the two for the sake of their companionship,
or for some reason of his own.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it must be remembered that, though the presumption
was strongly in favor of the two riders being the father and mother
of Wharton, it was not yet absolutely certain that such was the
case. That could not be known for some time to come.</p>

<p>It was evident that some curious complication had taken place,
since all three of the party had passed Blazing Arrow and his
men without their detection. There was nothing remarkable in the
single person doing so, since he had given evidence of unusual
care in his action. Skilled in the ways of the woods and Indian
subtlety, he knew enough to avoid the most cunning ambush, but
the hostiles must have been derelict to allow a mounted man and
woman to pass unnoticed.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, Wharton and Larry were as resolute as ever
in following the party. If it should prove that the parents had
passed that point on their way to the settlement, there was no
call for approaching any nearer to the block-house.</p>

<p>"We will go back," said Wharton, with only a moment's hesitation.
"Lead the way, Arqu-wao, and serve us as well as you have already
done."</p>

<p>"Me good Indian," he replied. "Me take care ob you."</p>

<p>"We know that. We shall depend on you. You needn't run, for we
don't want to overtake Blazing Arrow too soon."</p>

<p>The Shawanoe showed a remarkable quickness in comprehending the
wishes of the boys. He asked them to stand where they were until
he signalled them to follow. They watched his figure out of sight,
when he turned, with the same sidelong attitude as before, and
beckoned them to come on.</p>

<p>"We've got to trust him now," said Larry.</p>

<p>"There's no help for it; but we couldn't ask much better proof
of friendship than he has given already."</p>

<p>"But we'll keep our eyes on him. It may be he's fixing things
so as to gather in the whole lot of us."</p>

<p>Wharton thought his companion was unduly suspicious, but at the
same time he recognized the prudence of his words, for he knew
that these people sometimes show a boundless patience in waiting
for the minute when they can make their vengeance the more complete.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe walked so fast that Larry was forced to break into
a trot now and then to keep pace with him and the cleaner-limbed
Wharton. The presence of the three hostiles at no great distance
in front rendered necessary the precaution of Arqu-wao; for, if
he ran upon them with the youths at his heels, a collision would
be inevitable, with disastrous consequences.</p>

<p>The guide was putting forth all the cunning of which he was capable.
It was necessary to come up with Blazing Arrow and his companions,
and at the same time prevent their knowing it.</p>

<p>The journey was pushed in this manner for nearly a mile, and
Wharton recognized, from familiar sights, that they were drawing
near the turn in the dry ravine where he had had his singular
encounter with Blazing Arrow when he recovered his gun from him.</p>

<p>Somehow or other the conviction had fastened upon him that the
spot was again to be the scene of stirring events.</p>

<p>"Halloo!" he exclaimed in an undertone. "He has discovered something,
and we must wait till he signals us to go on."</p>
