<p>What in all the world so sweet as young love's dream?  It is
the old, old story, and yet it is as new and fresh and blissful
to the soul as it will be to the end of time, or until these natures
of ours are changed by the same Hand that framed them.</p>

<p>What more bewitching romance could cast its halo about the divine
passion than that which enshrined the affection of Fred Ashman
for the wonderful Ariel, the only child of the grim Haffgo, king
of the Murhapas?</p>

<p>He had met and chatted and exchanged glances with the beauties
of his own clime, and yet his heart remained unscathed.  He reverenced
the sex to which his adored mother and sister belonged, and yet
never had he felt the thrill that stirred his nature to the profoundest
depths, when his eyes met those of the barbarian princess and
the two smiled without either uttering a word.</p>

<p>"What care I for the gold and the diamonds and the precious stones
of the Matto Grosso?" the ardent lover asked himself; "is not
she the Koh-i-noor of them all?&mdash;the one gem whose preciousness
is worth more than all the world?"</p>

<p>He was willing that the Professor and Jared Long should risk
their lives in searching for the enchanted lake, and the burning
mountain where such priceless wealth existed.  Thousands of their
kind had done it before, and countless thousands would follow
in their footsteps through the generations to come.</p>

<p>But as for <em>him</em>, a new mission had broken upon his consciousness;
he had a sacred duty to perform.  Somewhere, in this broad world,
a human soul is always waiting for its mate.  Perchance it never
comes, and the weary one may be joined to that which heaven never
intended it to be joined, or it repines and goes to the grave
unloved.</p>

<p>Fred Ashman was as sure as if he heard a voice from the stars,
telling him that Ariel, the daughter of Haffgo, was his other
self.  He could never rest, he could not really live until it
should be his lot to carry her from this lonely wilderness to
his own home thousands of miles away.</p>

<p>To the young lover, aglow and happy in his new passion, all things
are possible.  It is he who can appreciate even the days of chivalry,
when the valiant knight went forth, with lance and buckler to
win his lady against all comers, counting it his highest happiness
to face the perils of flood and field if perchance he could but
win her smile.</p>

<p>And yet, amid all the roseate dreams which fairly lifted Fred
Ashman from the gross earth, he could not entirely lose sight
of his peculiar situation and the formidable difficulties which
environed his path.  He would not admit they were insurmountable,
but they were hard to climb.</p>

<p>To come down to facts, he felt that the first, and, indeed, the
indispensable step was to secure a meeting with the princess that
had taken such complete possession of his heart.</p>

<p>Guarded as she was by her father, who was sure to resent with
instant death any such presumption on his part, he might well
shrink from the appalling attempt; but love has many ways of picking
the locks that may be fastened to keep hearts apart.</p>

<p>"Ziffak!"</p>

<p>That was the name which came to his tongue again and again, with
the question whether his friendship could not be enlisted on the
side of the youth, who had come so strangely to the Murhapa village. 
He was a shrewd fellow who must suspect the truth of those stolen
glances.  He had shown a sudden and strong affection for the explorers,
and especially for Ashman to whom he surrendered.  Was what friendship
strong enough to lead him to a step that would insure a rupture
with his royal brother and probably bring about war in his little
kingdom?</p>

<p>"I wonder what revelation he was on the point of making when
he sat down with us in his mother's home," Ashman muttered, as
he slowly walked along the bank of the Upper Xingu, unmindful
of the creeping shadow behind him.</p>

<p>That it bore upon that interview and related to the angry quarrel
he did not doubt, but he could only conjecture its nature which
was not encouraging when he recalled that Ziffak had told him
and his friends, without protest on his part, that they were likely
to be compelled to leave the village that night.</p>

<p>Ashman ceased in his walk, for he saw, in spite of his absorbing
reverie, that he had passed above the uppermost house of the village.
The condition under which he was allowed to stay in peace, even
for a brief time, was that he should not wander beyond the limits
of the town.</p>

<p>It was useless to excite resentment without reason, and he was
about to turn and retrace his steps, when a slight rustling of
the undergrowth, which marked the boundary of the forest on the
south caused him to turn his head, stop, and hold his rifle ready
for danger.</p>

<p>His old habit of caution came back the instant peril seemed to
threaten.</p>

<p>While he debated whether to advance and force the stranger to
reveal himself, the outlines of a form were distinguished and
a slight figure stepped forth in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Ashman's heart seemed to stop beating and life itself hang in
suspense, when he recognized the very being that had taken such
full possession of his thoughts.</p>

<p>Ay, Ariel, daughter of King Haffgo, stood before him.</p>

<p>For a moment, neither spoke or moved.  It was not strange perhaps
that she was the first to recover the power of utterance.</p>

<p>Advancing timidly, she said in a tremulous voice and with an
accent just broken enough to make it all the sweeter:</p>

<p>"You are in danger and I could not help coming to tell you."</p>

<p>"Heaven bless you!" he exclaimed, taking a step toward her, but
still observing a respectful distance.  "You have braved danger
yourself to give me the warning."</p>

<p>"I left my home and waited for a chance to speak to you; I dared
not go to the door of Ziffak's house for I would have been seen. 
Then, while I was wondering what to do, I saw you come forth and
walk toward the river.  I thought you would go to the end of the
village, so I hurried on and hid among the bushes until I could
speak to you without any one seeing me."</p>

<p>Ashman's head was in a swirl.  He was trembling in every limb,
while she seemed to be devoid of any agitation whatever.</p>

<p>"Your father King Haffgo was angry this afternoon, because I
looked at you; but," added the lover, "I could not have helped
doing it, if I knew my life would have paid for the act.  Ziffak
told me about you, so you see I did not feel that you were a stranger,
even though I then saw you for the first time and never heard
the music of your voice until now."</p>

<p>"The king is angry," said she, withdrawing a little as the happy
fellow took another step; "he says you shall be killed, but Ziffak
persuaded him to say your life should be spared if you went away
to-night."</p>

<p>Ashman felt another delicious thrill as he reflected that if
such were the understanding, there would seem to be no cause for
the lovely Ariel to come thus far out of her way to repeat what
Ziffak was sure to explain before the departure of the explorers.</p>

<p>Ah, it must have been because of her interest in him that she
had sought this perilous stolen interview.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said he mournfully, "I must depart and never see
you again.  Death would be preferable to <em>that</em>!"</p>

<p>"But you may come back some time," said she in such a tremulous,
hesitating voice, that he impulsively sprang forward and caught
her dainty hand before she could escape him.</p>

<p>"O don't!" she plead like a timid bird, striving to withdraw
the imprisoned fingers which he still held fast.</p>

<p>"Nay, but you must, if I am never to see you again," he exclaimed
vehemently; "O, Ariel, I had hoped that I might stay here until
I could see and talk with you and tell you that I can never, never
leave you; that if I go, you must go with me; I will take you
to my home which is many many long miles away, but I will be your
slave; I will love you; I will make you happy; you shall never
sigh for the land and the people you leave behind you&#11834;"</p>

<p>There is no saying when the impetuous lover would have stopped
his wooing in this cyclone-like fashion hut for an alarming interruption.
He had been smitten profoundly, and the urgency of the case impelled
him to an ardor which could not have found expression under any
other conditions; but, all the time the frightened maiden was
striving to free her imprisoned hand, and the lover felt he ought
to release it but could not.</p>

<p>Suddenly she ceased her efforts and looked beyond him with a
gasp and such a startled expression, that he knew some unusual
cause had produced it.</p>
