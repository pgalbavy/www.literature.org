<p>At six o'clock in the evening, having finished all he had to do, M.
Filluel, accompanied by M. Bredoux, his clerk, stood waiting for the
carriage which was to take him back to Dieppe. He seemed restless,
nervous. Twice over, he asked:
</p><p>"You haven't seen anything of young Beautrelet, I suppose?"
</p><p>"No, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, I can't say I have."
</p><p>"Where on earth can he be? I haven't set eyes on him all day!"
</p><p>Suddenly, he had an idea, handed his portfolio to Bredoux, ran round
the chateau and made for the ruins. Isidore Beautrelet was lying near
the cloisters, flat on his face, with one arm folded under his head, on
the ground carpeted with pine-needles. He seemed drowsing.
</p><p>"Hullo, young man, what are you doing here? Are you asleep?"
</p><p>"I'm not asleep. I've been thinking."
</p><p>"Ever since this morning?"
</p><p>"Ever since this morning."
</p><p>"It's not a question of thinking! One must see into things first, study
facts, look for clues, establish connecting links. The time for
thinking comes after, when one pieces all that together and discovers
the truth."
</p><p>"Yes, I know.--That's the usual way, the right one, I dare say.--Mine
is different.--I think first, I try, above all, to get the general hang
of the case, if I may so express myself. Then I imagine a reasonable
and logical hypothesis, which fits in with the general idea. And then,
and not before, I examine the facts to see if they agree with my
hypothesis."
</p><p>"That's a funny method and a terribly complicated one!"
</p><p>"It's a sure method, M. Filleul, which is more than can be said of
yours."
</p><p>"Come, come! Facts are facts."
</p><p>"With your ordinary sort of adversary, yes. But, given an enemy endowed
with a certain amount of cunning, the facts are those which he happens
to have selected. Take the famous clues upon which you base your
inquiry: why, he was at liberty to arrange them as he liked. And you
see where that can lead you, into what mistakes and absurdities, when
you are dealing with a man like Arsene Lupin. Holmlock Shears himself
fell into the trap."
</p><p>"Arsene Lupin is dead."
</p><p>"No matter. His gang remains and the pupils of such a master are
masters themselves."
</p><p>M. Filleul took Isidore by the arm and, leading him away:
</p><p>"Words, young man, words. Here is something of more importance. Listen
to me. Ganimard is otherwise engaged at this moment and will not be
here for a few days. On the other hand, the Comte de Gesvres has
telegraphed to Holmlock Shears, who has promised his assistance next
week. Now don't you think, young man, that it would be a feather in our
cap if we were able to say to those two celebrities, on the day of
their arrival, 'Awfully sorry, gentlemen, but we couldn't wait. The
business is done'?"
</p><p>It was impossible for M. Filleul to confess helplessness with greater
candor. Beautrelet suppressed a smile and, pretending not to see
through the worthy magistrate, replied:
</p><p>"I confess. Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, that, if I was not present
at your inquiry just now, it was because I hoped that you would consent
to tell me the results. May I ask what you have learned?"
</p><p>"Well, last night, at eleven o'clock, the three gendarmes whom Sergeant
Quevillon had left on guard at the chateau received a note from the
sergeant telling them to hasten with all speed to Ouville, where they
are stationed. They at once rode off, and when they arrived at
Ouville--"
</p><p>"They discovered that they had been tricked, that the order was a
forgery and that there was nothing for them to do but return to
Ambrumesy."
</p><p>"This they did, accompanied by Sergeant Quevillon. But they were away
for an hour and a half and, during this time, the crime was committed."
</p><p>"In what circumstances?"
</p><p>"Very simple circumstances, indeed. A ladder was removed from the farm
buildings and placed against the second story of the chateau. A pane of
glass was cut out and a window opened. Two men, carrying a dark
lantern, entered Mlle. de Gesvres's room and gagged her before she
could cry out. Then, after binding her with cords, they softly opened
the door of the room in which Mlle. de Saint-Veran was sleeping. Mlle.
de Gesvres heard a stifled moan, followed by the sound of a person
struggling. A moment later, she saw two men carrying her cousin, who
was also bound and gagged. They passed in front of her and went out
through the window. Then Mlle. de Gesvres, terrified and exhausted,
fainted."
</p><p>"But what about the dogs? I thought M. de Gesvres had bought two almost
wild sheep-dogs, which were let loose at night?"
</p><p>"They were found dead, poisoned."
</p><p>"By whom? Nobody could get near them."
</p><p>"It's a mystery. The fact remains that the two men crossed the ruins
without let or hindrance and went out by the little door which we have
heard so much about. They passed through the copsewood, following the
line of the disused quarries. It was not until they were nearly half a
mile from the chateau, at the foot of the tree known as the Great Oak,
that they stopped--and executed their purpose."
</p><p>"If they came with the intention of killing Mlle. de Saint-Veran, why
didn't they murder her in her room?"
</p><p>"I don't know. Perhaps the incident that settled their determination
only occurred after they had left the house. Perhaps the girl succeeded
in releasing herself from her bonds. In my opinion, the scarf which was
picked up was used to fasten her wrists. In any case, the blow was
struck at the foot of the Great Oak. I have collected indisputable
proofs--"
</p><p>"But the body?"
</p><p>"The body has not been found, but there is nothing excessively
surprising in that. As a matter of fact, the trail which I followed
brought me to the church at Varengeville and the old cemetery perched
on the top of the cliff. From there it is a sheer precipice, a fall of
over three hundred feet to the rocks and the sea below. In a day or
two, a stronger tide than usual will cast up the body on the beach."
</p><p>"Obviously. This is all very simple."
</p><p>"Yes, it is all very simple and doesn't trouble me in the least. Lupin
is dead, his accomplices heard of it and, to revenge themselves, have
killed Mlle. de Saint-Veran. These are facts which did not even require
checking. But Lupin?"
</p><p>"What about him?"
</p><p>"What has become of him? In all probability, his confederates removed
his corpse at the same time that they carried away the girl; but what
proof have we? None at all. Any more than of his staying in the ruins,
or of his death, or of his life. And that is the real mystery, M.
Beautrelet. The murder of Mlle. Raymonde solves nothing. On the
contrary, it only complicates matters. What has been happening during
the past two months at the Chateau d'Ambrumesy? If we don't clear up
the riddle, young man, others will give us the go-by."
</p><p>"On what day are those others coming?"
</p><p>"Wednesday--Tuesday perhaps--"
</p><p>Beautrelet seemed to be making an inward calculation and then declared:
</p><p>"Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, this is Saturday. I have to be back at
school on Monday evening. Well, if you will have the goodness to be
here at ten o'clock exactly on Monday morning, I will try to give you
the key to the riddle."
</p><p>"Really, M. Beautrelet--do you think so? Are you sure?"
</p><p>"I hope so, at any rate."
</p><p>"And where are you going now?"
</p><p>"I am going to see if the facts consent to fit in with the general
theory which I am beginning to perceive."
</p><p>"And if they don't fit in?"
</p><p>"Well, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction," said Beautrelet, with a laugh,
"then it will be their fault and I must look for others which, will
prove more tractable. Till Monday, then?"
</p><p>"Till Monday."
</p><p>A few minutes later, M. Filleul was driving toward Dieppe, while
Isidore mounted a bicycle which he had borrowed from the Comte de
Gesvres and rode off along the road to Yerville and Caudebec-en-Caux.
</p><p>There was one point in particular on which the young man was anxious to
form a clear opinion, because this just appeared to him to be the
enemy's weakest point. Objects of the size of the four Rubens pictures
cannot be juggled away. They were bound to be somewhere. Granting that
it was impossible to find them for the moment, might one not discover
the road by which they had disappeared?
</p><p>What Beautrelet surmised was that the four pictures had undoubtedly
been carried off in the motor car, but that, before reaching Caudebec,
they were transferred to another car, which had crossed the Seine
either above Caudebec or below it. Now the first horse-boat down the
stream was at Quillebeuf, a greatly frequented ferry and, consequently,
dangerous. Up stream, there was the ferry-boat at La Mailleraie, a
large, but lonely market-town, lying well off the main road.
</p><p>By midnight, Isidore had covered the thirty-five or forty miles to La
Mailleraie and was knocking at the door of an inn by the waterside. He
slept there and, in the morning, questioned the ferrymen.
</p><p>They consulted the counterfoils in the traffic-book. No motor-car had
crossed on Thursday the 23rd of April.
</p><p>"A horse-drawn vehicle, then?" suggested Beautrelet. "A cart? A van?"
</p><p>"No, not either."
</p><p>Isidore continued his inquiries all through the morning. He was on the
point of leaving for Quillebeuf, when the waiter of the inn at which he
had spent the night said:
</p><p>"I came back from my thirteen days' training on the morning of which
you are speaking and I saw a cart, but it did not go across."
</p><p>"Really?"
</p><p>"No, they unloaded it onto a flat boat, a barge of sorts, which was
moored to the wharf."
</p><p>"And where did the cart come from?"
</p><p>"Oh, I knew it at once. It belonged to Master Vatinel, the carter."
</p><p>"And where does he live?"
</p><p>"At Louvetot."
</p><p>Beautrelet consulted his military map. The hamlet of Louvetot lay where
the highroad between Yvetot and Caudebec was crossed by a little
winding road that ran through the woods to La Mailleraie.
</p><p>Not until six o'clock in the evening did Isidore succeed in discovering
Master Vatinel, in a pothouse. Master Vatinel was one of those artful
old Normans who are always on their guard, who distrust strangers, but
who are unable to resist the lure of a gold coin or the influence of a
glass or two:
</p><p>"Well, yes, sir, the men in the motor car that morning had told me to
meet them at five o'clock at the crossroads. They gave me four great,
big things, as high as that. One of them went with me and we carted the
things to the barge."
</p><p>"You speak of them as if you knew them before."
</p><p>"I should think I did know them! It was the sixth time they were
employing me."
</p><p>Isidore gave a start:
</p><p>"The sixth time, you say? And since when?"
</p><p>"Why every day before that one, to be sure! But it was other things
then--great blocks of stone--or else smaller, longish ones, wrapped up
in newspapers, which they carried as if they were worth I don't know
what. Oh, I mustn't touch those on any account!--But what's the matter?
You've turned quite white."
</p><p>"Nothing--the heat of the room--"
</p><p>Beautrelet staggered out into the air. The joy, the surprise of the
discovery made him feel giddy. He went back very quietly to
Varengeville, slept in the village, spent an hour at the mayor's
offices with the school-master and returned to the chateau. There he
found a letter awaiting him "care of M. le Comte de Gesvres." It
consisted of a single line:
</p><p>"Second warning. Hold your tongue. If not--"
</p><p>"Come," he muttered. "I shall have to make up my mind and take a few
precautions for my personal safety. If not, as they say--"
</p><p>It was nine o'clock. He strolled about among the ruins and then lay
down near the cloisters and closed his eyes.
</p><p>"Well, young man, are you satisfied with the results of your campaign?"
</p><p>It was M. Filleul.
</p><p>"Delighted, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction."
</p><p>"By which you mean to say--?"
</p><p>"By which I mean to say that I am prepared to keep my promise--in spite
of this very uninviting letter."
</p><p>He showed the letter to M. Filleul.
</p><p>"Pooh! Stuff and nonsense!" cried the magistrate. "I hope you won't let
that prevent you--"
</p><p>"From telling you what I know? No, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction. I
have given my word and I shall keep it. In less than ten minutes, you
shall know--a part of the truth."
</p><p>"A part?"
</p><p>"Yes, in my opinion, Lupin's hiding-place does not constitute the whole
of the problem. Far from it. But we shall see later on."
</p><p>"M. Beautrelet, nothing that you do could astonish me now. But how were
you able to discover--?"
</p><p>"Oh, in a very natural way! In the letter from old man Harlington to M.
Etienne de Vaudreix, or rather to Lupin--"
</p><p>"The intercepted letter?"
</p><p>"Yes. There is a phrase which always puzzled me. After saying that the
pictures are to be forwarded as arranged, he goes on to say, 'You may
add THE REST, if you are able to succeed, which I doubt.'"
</p><p>"Yes, I remember."
</p><p>"What was this 'rest'? A work of art, a curiosity? The chateau contains
nothing of any value besides the Rubenses and the tapestries. Jewelry?
There is very little and what there is of it is not worth much. In that
case, what could it be?--On the other hand, was it conceivable that
people so prodigiously clever as Lupin should not have succeeded in
adding 'the rest,' which they themselves had evidently suggested? A
difficult undertaking, very likely; exceptional, surprising, I dare
say; but possible and therefore certain, since Lupin wished it."
</p><p>"And yet he failed: nothing has disappeared."
</p><p>"He did not fail: something has disappeared."
</p><p>"Yes, the Rubenses--but--"
</p><p>"The Rubenses and something besides--something which has been replaced
by a similar thing, as in the case of the Rubenses; something much more
uncommon, much rarer, much more valuable than the Rubenses."
</p><p>"Well, what? You're killing me with this procrastination!"
</p><p>While talking, the two men had crossed the ruins, turned toward the
little door and were now walking beside the chapel. Beautrelet stopped:
</p><p>"Do you really want to know, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction?"
</p><p>"Of course, I do."
</p><p>Beautrelet was carrying a walking-stick, a strong, knotted stick.
Suddenly, with a back stroke of this stick, he smashed one of the
little statues that adorned the front of the chapel.
</p><p>"Why, you're mad!" shouted M. Filleul, beside himself, rushing at the
broken pieces of the statue. "You're mad! That old saint was an
admirable bit of work--"
</p><p>"An admirable bit of work!" echoed Isidore, giving a whirl which
brought down the Virgin Mary.
</p><p>M. Filleul took hold of him round the body:
</p><p>"Young man, I won't allow you to commit--"
</p><p>A wise man of the East came toppling to the ground, followed by a
manger containing the Mother and Child. . . .
</p><p>"If you stir another limb, I fire!"
</p><p>The Comte de Gesvres had appeared upon the scene and was cocking his
revolver. Beautrelet burst out laughing:
</p><p>"That's right, Monsieur le Comte, blaze away!--Take a shot at them, as
if you were at a fair!--Wait a bit--this chap carrying his head in his
hands--"
</p><p>St. John the Baptist fell, shattered to pieces.
</p><p>"Oh!" shouted the count, pointing his revolver. "You young
vandal!--Those masterpieces!"
</p><p>"Sham, Monsieur le Comte!"
</p><p>"What? What's that?" roared M. Filleul, wresting the Comte de Gesvres's
weapon from him.
</p><p>"Sham!" repeated Beautrelet. "Paper-pulp and plaster!"
</p><p>"Oh, nonsense! It can't be true!"
</p><p>"Hollow plaster, I tell you! Nothing at all!"
</p><p>The count stooped and picked up a sliver of a statuette.
</p><p>"Look at it, Monsieur le Comte, and see for yourself: it's plaster!
Rusty, musty, mildewed plaster, made to look like old stone--but
plaster for all that, plaster casts!--That's all that remains of your
perfect masterpiece!--That's what they've done in just a few
days!-That's what the Sieur Charpenais who copied the Rubenses,
prepared a year ago." He seized M. Filleul's arm in his turn. "What do
you think of it, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction? Isn't it fine? Isn't
it grand? Isn't it gorgeous? The chapel has been removed! A whole
Gothic chapel collected stone by stone! A whole population of statues
captured and replaced by these chaps in stucco! One of the most
magnificent specimens of an incomparable artistic period confiscated!
The chapel, in short, stolen! Isn't it immense? Ah, Monsieur le Juge
d'Instruction, what a genius the man is!"
</p><p>"You're allowing yourself to be carried away, M. Beautrelet."
</p><p>"One can't be carried away too much, monsieur, when one has to do with
people like that. Everything above the average deserves our admiration.
And this man soars above everything. There is in his flight a wealth of
imagination, a force and power, a skill and freedom that send a thrill
through me!"
</p><p>"Pity he's dead," said M. Filleul, with a grin. "He'd have ended by
stealing the towers of Notre-Dame."
</p><p>Isidore shrugged his shoulders:
</p><p>"Don't laugh, monsieur. He upsets you, dead though he may be."
</p><p>"I don't say not, I don't say not, M. Beautrelet, I confess that I feel
a certain excitement now that I am about to set eyes on him--unless,
indeed, his friends have taken away the body."
</p><p>"And always admitting," observed the Comte de Gesvres, "that it was
really he who was wounded by my poor niece."
</p><p>"It was he, beyond a doubt, Monsieur le Comte," declared Beautrelet;
"it was he, believe me, who fell in the ruins under the shot fired by
Mlle. de Saint-Veran; it was he whom she saw rise and who fell again
and dragged himself toward the cloisters to rise again for the last
time--this by a miracle which I will explain to you presently--to rise
again for the last time and reach this stone shelter--which was to be
his tomb."
</p><p>And Beautrelet struck the threshold of the chapel with his stick.
</p><p>"Eh? What?" cried M. Filleul, taken aback. "His tomb?--Do you think
that that impenetrable hiding-place--"
</p><p>"It was here--there," he repeated.
</p><p>"But we searched it."
</p><p>"Badly."
</p><p>"There is no hiding-place here," protested M. de Gesvres. "I know the
chapel."
</p><p>"Yes, there is, Monsieur le Comte. Go to the mayor's office at
Varengeville, where they have collected all the papers that used to be
in the old parish of Ambrumesy, and you will learn from those papers,
which belong to the eighteenth century, that there is a crypt below the
chapel. This crypt doubtless dates back to the Roman chapel, upon the
site of which the present one was built."
</p><p>"But how can Lupin have known this detail?" asked M. Filleul.
</p><p>"In a very simple manner: because of the works which he had to execute
to take away the chapel."
</p><p>"Come, come, M. Beautrelet, you're exaggerating. He has not taken away
the whole chapel. Look, not one of the stones of this top course has
been touched."
</p><p>"Obviously, he cast and took away only what had a financial value: the
wrought stones, the sculptures, the statuettes, the whole treasure of
little columns and carved arches. He did not trouble about the
groundwork of the building itself. The foundations remain."
</p><p>"Therefore, M. Beautrelet, Lupin was not able to make his way into the
crypt."
</p><p>At that moment, M. de Gesvres, who had been to call a servant, returned
with the key of the chapel. He opened the door. The three men entered.
After a short examination Beautrelet said:
</p><p>"The flag-stones on the ground have been respected, as one might
expect. But it is easy to perceive that the high altar is nothing more
than a cast. Now, generally, the staircase leading to the crypt opens
in front of the high altar and passes under it."
</p><p>"What do you conclude?"
</p><p>"I conclude that Lupin discovered the crypt when working at the altar."
</p><p>The count sent for a pickaxe and Beautrelet attacked the altar. The
plaster flew to right and left. He pushed the pieces aside as he went
on.
</p><p>"By Jove!" muttered M. Filleul, "I am eager to know--"
</p><p>"So am I," said Beautrelet, whose face was pale with anguish.
</p><p>He hurried his blows. And, suddenly, his pickaxe, which, until then,
had encountered no resistance, struck against a harder material and
rebounded. There was a sound of something falling in; and all that
remained of the altar went tumbling into the gap after the block of
stone which had been struck by the pickaxe. Beautrelet bent forward. A
puff of cold air rose to his face. He lit a match and moved it from
side to side over the gap:
</p><p>"The staircase begins farther forward than I expected, under the
entrance-flags, almost. I can see the last steps, there, right at the
bottom."
</p><p>"Is it deep?"
</p><p>"Three or four yards. The steps are very high--and there are some
missing."
</p><p>"It is hardly likely," said M. Filleul, "that the accomplices can have
had time to remove the body from the cellar, when they were engaged in
carrying off Mlle. de Saint-Veran--during the short absence of the
gendarmes. Besides, why should they?--No, in my opinion, the body is
here."
</p><p>A servant brought them a ladder. Beautrelet let it down through the
opening and fixed it, after groping among the fallen fragments. Holding
the two uprights firmly:
</p><p>"Will you go down, M. Filleul?" he asked.
</p><p>The magistrate, holding a candle in his hand, ventured down the ladder.
The Comte de Gesvres followed him and Beautrelet, in his turn, placed
his foot on the first rung.
</p><p>Mechanically, he counted eighteen rungs, while his eyes examined the
crypt, where the glimmer of the candle struggled against the heavy
darkness. But, at the bottom, his nostrils were assailed by one of
those foul and violent smells which linger in the memory for many a
long day. And, suddenly, a trembling hand seized him by the shoulder.
</p><p>"Well, what is it?"
</p><p>"B-beautrelet," stammered M. Filleul. "B-beau-trelet--"
</p><p>He could not get a word out for terror.
</p><p>"Come, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, compose yourself!"
</p><p>"Beautrelet--he is there--"
</p><p>"Eh?"
</p><p>"Yes--there was something under the big stone that broke off the
altar--I pushed the stone--and I touched--I shall never--shall never
forget.--"
</p><p>"Where is it?"
</p><p>"On this side.--Don't you notice the smell?--And then look--see."
</p><p>He took the candle and held it towards a motionless form stretched upon
the ground.
</p><p>"Oh!" exclaimed Beautrelet, in a horror-stricken tone.
</p><p>The three men bent down quickly. The corpse lay half-naked, lean,
frightful. The flesh, which had the greenish hue of soft wax, appeared
in places through the torn clothes. But the most hideous thing, the
thing that had drawn a cry of terror from the young man's lips, was the
head, the head which had just been crushed by the block of stone, the
shapeless head, a repulsive mass in which not one feature could be
distinguished.
</p><p>Beautrelet took four strides up the ladder and fled into the daylight
and the open air.
</p><p>M. Filleul found him again lying flat on the around, with his hands
glued to his face:
</p><p>"I congratulate you, Beautrelet," he said. "In addition to the
discovery of the hiding-place, there are two points on which I have
been able to verify the correctness of your assertions. First of all,
the man on whom Mlle. de Saint-Veran fired was indeed Arsene Lupin, as
you said from the start. Also, he lived in Paris under the name of
Etienne de Vaudreix. His linen is marked with the initials E. V. That
ought to be sufficient proof, I think: don't you?"
</p><p>Isidore did not stir.
</p><p>"Monsieur le Comte has gone to have a horse put to. They're sending for
Dr. Jouet, who will make the usual examination. In my opinion, death
must have taken place a week ago, at least. The state of decomposition
of the corpse--but you don't seem to be listening--"
</p><p>"Yes, yes."
</p><p>"What I say is based upon absolute reasons. Thus, for instance--"
</p><p>M. Filleul continued his demonstrations, without, however, obtaining
any more manifest marks of attention. But M. de Gesvres's return
interrupted his monologue. The comte brought two letters. One was to
tell him that Holmlock Shears would arrive next morning.
</p><p>"Capital!" cried M. Filleul, joyfully. "Inspector Ganimard will be here
too. It will be delightful."
</p><p>"The other letter is for you, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction," said the
comte.
</p><p>"Better and better," said M. Filleul, after reading it. "There will
certainly not be much for those two gentlemen to do. M. Beautrelet, I
hear from Dieppe that the body of a young woman was found by some
shrimpers, this morning, on the rocks."
</p><p>Beautrelet gave a start:
</p><p>"What's that? The body--"
</p><p>"Of a young woman.--The body is horribly mutilated, they say, and it
would be impossible to establish the identity, but for a very narrow
little gold curb-bracelet on the right arm which has become encrusted
in the swollen skin. Now Mlle. de Saint-Veran used to wear a gold
curb-bracelet on her right arm. Evidently, therefore, Monsieur le
Comte, this is the body of your poor niece, which the sea must have
washed to that distance. What do you think, Beautrelet?"
</p><p>"Nothing--nothing--or, rather, yes--everything is connected, as you
see--and there is no link missing in my argument. All the facts, one
after the other, however contradictory, however disconcerting they may
appear, end by supporting the supposition which I imagined from the
first."
</p><p>"I don't understand."
</p><p>"You soon will. Remember, I promised you the whole truth."
</p><p>"But it seems to me--"
</p><p>"A little patience, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction. So far, you have
had no cause to complain of me. It is a fine day. Go for a walk, lunch
at the chateau, smoke your pipe. I shall be back by four o'clock. As
for my school, well, I don't care: I shall take the night train."
</p><p>They had reached the out-houses at the back of the chateau. Beautrelet
jumped on his bicycle and rode away.
</p><p>At Dieppe, he stopped at the office of the local paper, the Vigie, and
examined the file for the last fortnight. Then he went on to the
market-town of Envermeu, six or seven miles farther. At Envermeu, he
talked to the mayor, the rector and the local policeman. The
church-clock struck three. His inquiry was finished.
</p><p>He returned singing for joy. He pressed upon the two pedals turn by
turn, with an equal and powerful rhythm; his chest opened wide to take
in the keen air that blew from the sea. And, from time to time, he
forgot himself to the extent of uttering shouts of triumph to the sky,
when he thought of the aim which he was pursuing and of the success
that was crowning his efforts.
</p><p>Ambrumesy appeared in sight. He coasted at full speed down the slope
leading to the chateau. The top rows of venerable trees that line the
road seemed to run to meet him and to vanish behind him forthwith. And,
all at once, he uttered a cry. In a sudden vision, he had seen a rope
stretched from one tree to another, across the road.
</p><p>His machine gave a jolt and stopped short. Beautrelet was flung three
yards forward, with immense violence, and it seemed to him that only
chance, a miraculous chance, caused him to escape a heap of pebbles on
which, logically, he ought to have broken his head.
</p><p>He lay for a few seconds stunned. Then, all covered with bruises, with
the skin flayed from his knees, he examined the spot. On the right lay
a small wood, by which his aggressor had no doubt fled. Beautrelet
untied the rope. To the tree on the left around which it was fastened a
small piece of paper was fixed with string. Beautrelet unfolded it and
read:
</p><p>"The third and last warning."
</p><p>He went on to the chateau, put a few questions to the servants and
joined the examining magistrate in a room on the ground floor, at the
end of the right wing, where M. Filleul used to sit in the course of
his operations. M. Filleul was writing, with his clerk seated opposite
to him. At a sign from him, the clerk left the room; and the magistrate
exclaimed:
</p><p>"Why, what have you been doing to yourself, M. Beautrelet? Your hands
are covered with blood."
</p><p>"It's nothing, it's nothing," said the young man. "Just a fall
occasioned by this rope, which was stretched in front of my bicycle. I
will only ask you to observe that the rope comes from the chateau. Not
longer than twenty minutes ago, it was being used to dry linen on,
outside the laundry."
</p><p>"You don't mean to say so!"
</p><p>"Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, I am being watched here, by some one
in the very heart of the place, who can see me, who can hear me and
who, minute by minute, observes my actions and knows my intentions."
</p><p>"Do you think so?"
</p><p>"I am sure of it. It is for you to discover him and you will have no
difficulty in that. As for myself, I want to have finished and to give
you the promised explanations. I have made faster progress than our
adversaries expected and I am convinced that they mean to take vigorous
measures on their side. The circle is closing around me. The danger is
approaching. I feel it."
</p><p>"Nonsense, Beautrelet--"
</p><p>"You wait and see! For the moment, let us lose no time. And, first, a
question on a point which I want to have done with at once. Have you
spoken to anybody of that document which Sergeant Quevillon picked up
and handed you in my presence?"
</p><p>"No, indeed; not to a soul. But do you attach any value--?"
</p><p>"The greatest value. It's an idea of mine, an idea, I confess, which
does not rest upon a proof of any kind--for, up to the present, I have
not succeeded in deciphering the document. And therefore I am
mentioning it--so that we need not come back to it."
</p><p>Beautrelet pressed his hand on M. Filleul's and whispered:
</p><p>"Don't speak--there's some one listening--outside--"
</p><p>The gravel creaked. Beautrelet ran to the window and leaned out:
</p><p>"There's no one there--but the border has been trodden down--we can
easily identify the footprints--"
</p><p>He closed the window and sat down again:
</p><p>"You see, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, the enemy has even ceased to
take the most ordinary precautions--he has not time left--he too feels
that the hour is urgent. Let us be quick, therefore, and speak, since
they do not wish us to speak."
</p><p>He laid the document on the table and held it in position, unfolded:
</p><p>"One observation, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, to begin with. The
paper consists almost entirely of dots and figures. And in the first
three lines and the fifth--the only ones with which we have to do at
present, for the fourth seems to present an entirely different
character--not one of those figures is higher than the figure 5. There
is, therefore, a great chance that each of these figures represents one
of the five vowels, taken in alphabetical order. Let us put down the
result."
</p><p>He wrote on a separate piece of paper:
</p><p>  E . A . A . . E . . E . A . . A . .<br/>
   A . . . E . E .      . E OI . E . . E .
   . OU . . E . O . . . E . . E . O . . E
   AI . UI . . E           . . EU . E
</p>
<p>Then he continued:
</p><p>"As you see, this does not give us much to go upon. The key is, at the
same time, very easy, because the inventor has contented himself with
replacing the vowels by figures and the consonants by dots, and very
difficult, if not impossible, because he has taken no further trouble
to complicate the problem."
</p><p>"It is certainly pretty obscure."
</p><p>"Let us try to throw some light upon it. The second line is divided
into two parts; and the second part appears in such a way that it
probably forms one word. If we now seek to replace the intermediary
dots by consonants, we arrive at the conclusion, after searching and
casting about, that the only consonants which are logically able to
support the vowels are also logically able to produce only one word,
the word DEMOISELLES."
</p><p>"That would refer to Mlle. de Gesvres and Mlle. de Saint-Veran."
</p><p>"Undoubtedly."
</p><p>"And do you see nothing more?"
</p><p>"Yes. I also note an hiatus in the middle of the last line; and, if I
apply a similar operation to the beginning of the line, I at once see
that the only consonant able to take the place of the dot between the
diphthongs FAI and UI is the letter G and that, when I have thus formed
the first five letters of the word, AIGUI, it is natural and inevitable
that, with the two next dots and the final E, I should arrive at the
word AIGUILLE."
</p><p>"Yes, the word AIGUILLE forces itself upon us."
</p><p>"Finally, for the last word, I have three vowels and three consonants.
I cast about again, I try all the letters, one after the other, and,
starting with the principle that the two first letters are necessary
consonants, I find that three words apply: F<em>EUVE, PREUVE and CREUSE. I
eliminate the words F</em>EUVE and PREUVE, as possessing no possible
relation to a needle, and I keep the word CREUSE."
</p><p>"Making 'hollow needle'! By jove! I admit that your solution is
correct, because it needs must be; but how does it help us?"
</p><p>"Not at all," said Beautrelet, in a thoughtful tone. "Not at all, for
the moment.--Later on, we shall see.--I have an idea that a number of
things are included in the puzzling conjunction of those two words,
AIGUILLE CREUSE. What is troubling me at present is rather the material
on which the document is written, the paper employed.--Do they still
manufacture this sort of rather coarse-grained parchment? And then this
ivory color.--And those folds--the wear of those folds--and, lastly,
look, those marks of red sealing-wax, on the back--"
</p><p>At that moment Beautrelet, was interrupted by Bredoux, the magistrate's
clerk, who opened the door and announced the unexpected arrival of the
chief public prosecutor. M. Filleul rose:
</p><p>"Anything new? Is Monsieur le Procureur General downstairs?"
</p><p>"No, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction. Monsieur le Procureur General has
not left his carriage. He is only passing through Ambrumesy and begs
you to be good enough to go down to him at the gate. He only has a word
to say to you."
</p><p>"That's curious," muttered M. Filleul. "However--we shall see. Excuse
me, Beautrelet, I shan't be long."
</p><p>He went away. His footsteps sounded outside. Then the clerk closed the
door, turned the key and put it in his pocket.
</p><p>"Hullo!" exclaimed Beautrelet, greatly surprised. "What are you locking
us in for?"
</p><p>"We shall be able to talk so much better," retorted Bredoux.
</p><p>Beautrelet rushed toward another door, which led to the next room. He
had understood: the accomplice was Bredoux, the clerk of the examining
magistrate himself. Bredoux grinned:
</p><p>"Don't hurt your fingers, my young friend. I have the key of that door,
too."
</p><p>"There's the window!" cried Beautrelet.
</p><p>"Too late," said Bredoux, planting himself in front of the casement,
revolver in hand.
</p><p>Every chance of retreat was cut off. There was nothing more for Isidore
to do, nothing except to defend himself against the enemy who was
revealing himself with such brutal daring. He crossed his arms.
</p><p>"Good," mumbled the clerk. "And now let us waste no time." He took out
his watch. "Our worthy M. Filleul will walk down to the gate. At the
gate, he will find nobody, of course: no more public prosecutor than my
eye. Then he will come back. That gives us about four minutes. It will
take me one minute to escape by this window, clear through the little
door by the ruins and jump on the motor cycle waiting for me. That
leaves three minutes, which is just enough."
</p><p>Bredoux was a queer sort of misshapen creature, who balanced on a pair
of very long spindle-legs a huge trunk, as round as the body of a
spider and furnished with immense arms. A bony face and a low, small
stubborn forehead pointed to the man's narrow obstinacy.
</p><p>Beautrelet felt a weakness in the legs and staggered. He had to sit
down:
</p><p>"Speak," he said. "What do you want?"
</p><p>"The paper. I've been looking for it for three days."
</p><p>"I haven't got it."
</p><p>"You're lying. I saw you put it back in your pocket-book when I came
in."
</p><p>"Next?"
</p><p>"Next, you must undertake to keep quite quiet. You're annoying us.
Leave us alone and mind your own business. Our patience is at an end."
</p><p>He had come nearer, with the revolver still aimed at the young man's
head, and spoke in a hollow voice, with a powerful stress on each
syllable that he uttered. His eyes were hard, his smile cruel.
</p><p>Beautrelet gave a shudder. It was the first time that he was
experiencing the sense of danger. And such danger! He felt himself in
the presence of an implacable enemy, endowed with blind and
irresistible strength.
</p><p>"And next?" he asked, with less assurance in his voice.
</p><p>"Next? Nothing.--You will be free.--We will forget--"
</p><p>There was a pause. Then Bredoux resumed:
</p><p>"There is only a minute left. You must make up your mind. Come, old
chap, don't be a fool.--We are the stronger, you know, always and
everywhere.--Quick, the paper--"
</p><p>Isidore did not flinch. With a livid and terrified face, he remained
master of himself, nevertheless, and his brain remained clear amid the
breakdown of his nerves. The little black hole of the revolver was
pointing at six inches from his eyes. The finger was bent and obviously
pressing on the trigger. It only wanted a moment--
</p><p>"The paper," repeated Bredoux. "If not--"
</p><p>"Here it is," said Beautrelet.
</p><p>He took out his pocket-book and handed it to the clerk, who seized it
eagerly.
</p><p>"Capital! We've come to our senses. I've no doubt there's something to
be done with you.--You're troublesome, but full of common sense. I'll
talk about it to my pals. And now I'm off. Good-bye!"
</p><p>He pocketed his revolver and turned back the fastening of the window.
There was a noise in the passage.
</p><p>"Good-bye," he said again. "I'm only just in time."
</p><p>But the idea stopped him. With a quick movement, he examined the
pocket-book:
</p><p>"Damn and blast it!" He grated through his teeth. "The paper's not
there.--You've done me--"
</p><p>He leaped into the room. Two shots rang out. Isidore, in his turn, had
seized his pistol and fired.
</p><p>"Missed, old chap!" shouted Bredoux. "Your hand's shaking.--You're
afraid--"
</p><p>They caught each other round the body and came down to the floor
together. There was a violent and incessant knocking at the door.
Isidore's strength gave way and he was at once over come by his
adversary. It was the end. A hand was lifted over him, armed with a
knife, and fell. A fierce pain burst into his shoulder. He let go.
</p><p>He had an impression of some one fumbling in the inside pocket of his
jacket and taking the paper from it. Then, through the lowered veil of
his eyelids, he half saw the man stepping over the window-sill.
</p><hr/>
<p>The same newspapers which, on the following morning, related the last
episodes that had occurred at the Chateau d'Ambrumesy--the trickery at
the chapel, the discovery of Arsene Lupin's body and of Raymonde's body
and, lastly, the murderous attempt made upon Beautrelet by the clerk to
the examining magistrate--also announced two further pieces of news:
the disappearance of Ganimard, and the kidnapping of Holmlock Shears,
in broad daylight, in the heart of London, at the moment when he was
about to take the train for Dover.
</p><p>Lupin's gang, therefore, which had been disorganized for a moment by
the extraordinary ingenuity of a seventeen-year-old schoolboy, was now
resuming the offensive and was winning all along the line from the
first. Lupin's two great adversaries, Shears and Ganimard, were put
away. Isidore Beautrelet was disabled. The police were powerless. For
the moment there was no one left capable of struggling against such
enemies.
