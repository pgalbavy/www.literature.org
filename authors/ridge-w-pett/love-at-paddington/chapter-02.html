<p>Mr. Trew could scarcely be suspected of exceeding his instructions; he
had, upon his return, given privately an account of the words used,
with frequent use of the phrases, "I says to him," and "He says to me."
But as evenings of the week went by, and other girls at Hilbert's, on
leaving at the hour of seven, were met by courageous youths near the
door, and by shyer lads at a more reticent spot (some of these took
ambush in doorways, affecting to read cricket results in the evening
paper), then Gertie Higham began to wonder whether the message had been
communicated in the precise tone and manner that she had given it.  The
blue pinafored girls, stitching gold thread in the workroom at
Hilbert's, cultivated little reserve, and when they had occasion to
enter the office they sometimes told her of young men encountered (say)
at a dance, of ardent protestations of love, faithful promises to meet
again.
</p>
<p>"And from that day to this," the accounts finished, "not so much as a
sign of his lordship."
</p><p>There was encouragement in the thought that he knew the number in Great
Titchfield Street; was aware that she walked thence to Praed Street.
And each evening on the way home a straw hat temporarily imposed upon
her, a tall boyish figure and an eager method of walking deceived.  At
Praed Street, Mrs. Mills, noting that time had not been wasted on the
journey, beamed approval and made much of her niece, telling her she
was a good, sensible girl; one bound to get on in the world.  Gertie
did not leave again after her arrival, but turned out a room upstairs,
and swept and dusted with extraordinary energy.
</p><p>Good spirits increased at Great Titchfield Street when Friday came, and
men at the looms above sang loudly; girls who had borrowed small sums
were reminded by lenders that the moment for payment was close at hand.
At the hour, wages were given through the pigeon-hole of the windows by
Madame, with the assistance of Gertie, and the young women hung up
pinafores, pinned hats, and flew off with the sums as though there was
danger of a refund being demanded.  When they had gone, Madame,
dispirited by the paying out of money, said there was not now the
profit in the business that there had been in her father's day, when
you charged what you liked, and everybody paid willingly.  To restore
cheerfulness, the two faced each other at the sloping desks, and Madame
dictated whilst Gertie took bills, headed "Hilbert's Military
Accoutrement Manufacturers," and wrote the words, "To a/c rendered."
Later, she left to Madame the task of locking up.
</p><p>Near the print shop over the way, a tall young figure in a tweed suit
marched from one unlighted lamp-post to another; the girl drew back to
the staircase, snatching a space for consideration.  The next moment
she was crossing the street with the air of an art patron anxious to
inspect before making a purchase.
</p><p>"You gave me such a start," she declared, as a hand touched her
shoulder lightly.  "I'd begun to think you'd disappeared altogether.
Where've you been hiding?"
</p><p>"Do you mind very much," he asked, gazing down at her contentedly, "if
I honour you with my company a part of the way?"
</p><p>"No objection whatever.  Hasn't it been a scorcher?  Up there, what
with the heat and the noise of the machines going, it's made my head
ache."
</p><p>"You won't care to go to a concert then.  Shall we have a boat again in
Regent's Park?  We are both magnificent sailors."
</p><p>"I'd rather be somewheres where we can talk."
</p><p>"Why," he declared, "that is just what I should prefer.  The similarity
in our tastes is almost alarming."
</p><p>"Primrose Hill is rather a nice open space."
</p><p>"Sounds perfectly delightful," he agreed; "but I can't in the least
guess where it is."
</p><p>"I know my way about London," said Gertie Higham.
</p><p>They walked along Oxford Street, the girl endeavouring to keep in step
with him, and he attempting to keep in step with her; they appeared to
decide near to Wells Street that it would be more convenient to fall
back on individual methods.  At the corner of Tottenham Court Road
Gertie hailed a yellow omnibus which was on the point of starting; she
skipped up the steps with a confidence that made the conductor's
warning "'Old tight!" superfluous.
</p><p>"You didn't mind my sending out that message the other evening?"
Beginning the conversation breathlessly.
</p><p>"I considered it kind of you to be so thoughtful."
</p><p>"It wasn't exactly that.  I didn't want a row with aunt.  What did you
think of Mr. Trew?"
</p><p>"Do you know, it occurred to me that he looked rather like an omnibus
driver."
</p><p>"He is an omnibus driver."
</p><p>"A relative?"
</p><p>"Better than that--a friend.  I s'pose you're somewhat particular about
relations?"
</p><p>The conductor came, and the girl had thought of other questions by the
time fares to the Adelaide were paid.  A man on the seat in front
turned to ask her companion for a match; he handed over a silver box
that bore a monogram.  She begged permission, when it was given back,
to look at the case.
</p><p>"Which stands for the Christian name?"
</p><p>"The H."
</p><p>"And D. is for the surname then--H. D."
</p><p>"Henry Douglass," he said.
</p><p>"I like the sound of it," she declared.  "What do you think the name of
the forewoman at our place of business is?"  She chattered on, and he
listened attentively, as though the sound of her voice was all that
mattered.
</p><p>At the Adelaide they alighted, and, walking up the short hill, found
Regent's Park Road; she explained the geography of the district,
pointed out that away south it was all open country until you came to
Marylebone Road.  And was it not wonderful how fresh and bracing the
air seemed up here, even on a summer's evening; you could easily
imagine yourself miles and miles away from London.  Did he care for the
country?  She did not.  For one thing, the people there had such an odd
way of speaking that it was a trouble to realize what they were driving
at.  She sometimes wondered whether they understood each other.
</p><p>"You're letting me do all the talk," she remarked, as they took seats
in the enclosed space at the top of the hill.  Boys were playing on the
slopes, punctuating the game with frequent disputes.  A young couple
seated near a tree attracted her notice; the girl's eyes were closed,
head resting on the shoulder of the young man, who had an aspect of
gloomy resignation.
</p><p>"Sillies some people make of themselves, don't they?" she said.
</p><p>"I suppose we are, most of us, ludicrous to other people."
</p><p>"Do you laugh at me sometimes?"
</p><p>"No, no," he said earnestly; "I like you too much to do that."
</p><p>"You think you're a bit fond of me," she said, gazing ahead and
speaking deliberately, "because I'm different from most of the girls
you're in the habit of meeting, and my ways make a change for you.
That's about all.  You'd soon get tired of me and my manner if we saw
much of each other.  I know it won't last."
</p><p>"I shall not trouble to contradict that," he remarked good-temperedly,
"because I know you don't believe it yourself.  Why, it would be
absolutely splendid to be always with you."
</p><p>Another couple walked by, breathless after the climb.  Gertie,
recognizing her friend Miss Radford, nodded; and that young lady, after
a short scream of astonishment, gave a bow, and nudged her blushing
companion as an instruction to imitate the example by raising his hat.
</p><p>"I'm glad she's seen us," said Gertie.  "Didn't the young fellow turn
red?"
</p><p>"He's a junior clerk in my office."
</p><p>"What a score for me!" she cried exultantly.  "I've a good mind to ask
you now what you do for a living exactly, only that I'd rather find
everything out bit by bit."
</p><p>"You queer little person," he said affectionately.  "Tell me instead
about yourself.  What is a day like at your place of business?  Do you
mind--it helps to concentrate my attention--if I hold your hand whilst
you talk?"
</p><p>"Why should I?" asked Gertie.
</p><p>There could be no doubt, as she progressed with the description of
Great Titchfield Street, that her mind was well occupied with the daily
work; she gave the recital clearly and well, avoiding repetition and
excluding any suggestion of monotony.  Every moment of the hours there
seemed to engage her interest.  It was her duty to keep the books, and
keep them straight; to answer the telephone, and sometimes make
purchases of reels of gold thread and of leather.  The looms and the
netting machine were worked by men; the rest was done by girls.  The
forewoman was described, and her domestic troubles lightly sketched
(Miss Rabbit's father backed horses, excepting when they came in
first).  Madame herself was spoken of in lowered respectful
tones--partly because of her high position, partly because of shrewd
and businesslike methods.  Madame, it appeared, attributed any success
she attained to the circumstance that she had steered clear of
matrimony.  Madame told the girls sometimes that you could wed yourself
to business, or you could wed yourself to a man, but women who tried to
do both found themselves punished for bigamy, sooner or later.  Gertie
was a favourite of Madame's; the main reason was, the girl thought,
that--
</p><p>"Shan't tell you!" she said, interrupting herself.
</p><p>"Let me hear the worst," begged young Douglass cheerfully.  "I have,
just for the moment, the courage of a lion."
</p><p>"Well, the reason is that she's under the impression I don't care much
for--for anybody special."
</p><p>"And is Madame correct in her sanguine anticipations?"
</p><p>"She was.  Until a month or so ago."
</p><p>He took the other hand quickly.
</p><p>"Let's move on," she recommended, rising sedately.  "I don't want to be
too late on pay night.  Aunt will be thinking I've been knocked down
and robbed of my purse.  She's country-bred--Berkshire--and she says
she doesn't trust Londoners."  They went down the slope.
</p><p>"Does she happen to know the town of Wallingford, I wonder?"
</p><p>He declared, on receiving the answer, that nothing could be more
fortunate; this was, indeed, pure luck.  For he too was acquainted with
Wallingford, and especially well he knew a village not far off: if he
could but meet Gertie's aunt, here was a subject of mutual interest.
Throwing away the serious manner that came intermittently, he
challenged her to race him down to the Albert Road gate; and she went
at her best speed, not discouraged by shouts from youngsters of "Go it,
little 'un!"  They arrived together at the gate, where Gertie had to
rest for a few moments to regain breath.  She pointed out that skirts
hampered one; he admitted he ought to have given her fifty yards start.
They took Regent's Park more demurely.
</p><p>"When you get a colour," he said, "you look like a schoolgirl."
</p><p>"As a matter of fact, I shan't see twenty again."
</p><p>"Do you want to?"
</p><p>"No," she replied candidly; "I'm as happy just now as ever I want to
be.  It'll always be something to look back upon."
</p><p>"I wish," he said with earnestness, "that you wouldn't talk as though
our friendship was only going to be temporary."
</p><p>"We never know our luck," she remarked.  "Aunt was saying only the
other evening, 'Gertie,' she said--Now I've been and let you know my
name."
</p><p>He repeated it twice quietly to himself.
</p><p>"Have you been fond of any one before this?" she asked.  The girl had
so many questions that her mind jumped from one topic to another.
</p><p>"Oh yes," he answered.  "When I was a schoolboy at Winchester I fell in
love--deeply in love.  She was a widow, and kept a confectioner's shop.
Good shop, too."
</p><p>"Nothing more serious than that?"  He shook his head.  "Glad I'm the
first," she said.  "And I wish my plan for getting you acquainted with
aunt had come off the other night.  It would have made it all seem more
legal, somehow."
</p><p>"We'll manage it," he promised.  "Meanwhile, and always, don't forget
that you are my dear sweetheart."
</p>
<p>Miss Radford called at Praed Street, inquiring anxiously; and Mrs.
Mills, summoning invention to her aid, said Gertie was not in.  Mrs.
Mills followed this up by mentioning that an occasional visit from Miss
Radford could be tolerated, but it was not necessary for her to be
always in and out of the place.  Miss Radford, asserting that she never
forced her company upon any one, swung out of the shop; and Mrs. Mills
said to the cat that they did not want too many flighters about.
</p><p>"Why, Mr. Bulpert!"  With a quick change of manner to a newcomer.
"This is a pleasant surprise.  Mr. Trew was talking about you not two
days ago."
</p><p>The young man took the chair near the counter and, giving it a twirl,
sat down heavily, and rested his chin on the back.  "I'm putting on too
much avoirdupois," he said gloomily.  "Saturday, I had to get into
evening dress, and it was as much as I could do to make the waistcoat
buttons meet."
</p><p>"You ought to take more exercise."
</p><p>"What's the use of talking like that?  If I take more exercise, I find
myself with a bigger appetite, and then I'm worse off than ever."  He
dismissed the problem as insoluble.  "Where's Gertie?  I've got a new
recitation that she'd very much like to hear.  I place a certain value
on her criticism."
</p><p>"I'll call her down.  And, Mr. Bulpert, I want you to be as nice and
pleasant to her as you can.  I had to talk rather sharply to her not
many days ago; now I'd like to make it up.  I'm bound to say she took
it very well."
</p><p>"You won't forget," he urged, "that I'm a man who can always get any
amount of refined society.  Sought after as I am for <u>al fresco</u>
concerts and what not--"
</p><p>"I know," agreed Mrs. Mills.  "Only Gertie hasn't many friends, and I
want her, just now, to make the most of 'em."
</p><p>She called her niece, and Gertie came, turning the page of a book,
entitled, "Hints for Gentlewomen."  Gertie offered her hand to Bulpert,
and remarked that he was growing stout; he advised her, with some
vehemence, to take to glasses before her eyesight became further
impaired.  Mrs. Mills went back to the shop with a waggish caution
against too much love-making.  Bulpert, after shifting furniture, took
up a position on the white hearthrug, and gave a stirring adventure in
the life of a coastguardsman who saved from a wreck his wife and child.
At the end, Bulpert mopped face, readjusted collar, and waited for
congratulations.
</p><p>"Did you make it up out your own head, Mr. Bulpert?"
</p><p>"I did not make it up out of my own head," he said resentfully.  "That
isn't my line, and well you know it.  It was written by a chap your
cousin, Clarence Mills, introduced me to."
</p><p>"Ask him to write it again.  It seems to me a stupid piece.  The wife's
been away for ten years, and the baby is eighteen months old."
</p><p>"That does require a slight alteration.  But what about my rendering of
it?"
</p><p>"Overdone," answered Gertie.  "If only you'd stand up and say them
quietly, your pieces would go a lot better."
</p><p>"But I've got to convey the meaning to the ordience."
</p><p>"Give 'em credit for some intelligence.  When the coastguardsman is
going out to the wreck, it isn't necessary to wave your arms about like
a windmill.  You say he's swimming, and that's enough.  And if a
floating spar knocked him senseless before he got to the wreck, I don't
believe he could take them both in his arms and swim back to the shore."
</p><p>"It says he did in the poetry," contended Bulpert with warmth.  "The
whole fact of the matter is that you don't in the least know what
you're talking about."  A sound of voices came from the shop, and
Gertie flushed.  "Now it's no use your getting hot-tempered about it,"
he went on.  "You speak your mind to me, and I'm entitled to speak my
mind to you.  What you suffer from is nothing more nor less than sheer
ignorance.  Imperfect education; that's what the complaint is called."
</p><p>"Gertie!"  A call from the shop.
</p><p>"Yes, aunt."
</p><p>"Do come here just a moment.  Here's the strangest coincidence I ever
came across."  Gertie obeyed with signs of nervousness.  "This young
gentleman tells me that he knows Ewelme, and he's actually been inside
the house where I was born!"
</p><p>"How do you do?" said Gertie.
</p><p>"And he's going down there again shortly," went on Mrs. Mills with
animation, "and he means to bring me back some roses from the garden.
Isn't it good of him?"
</p><p>"Your daughter is fond of flowers?"
</p><p>"She's only my niece," explained Mrs. Mills volubly.  "Her mother
kicked the bucket some years ago, and her father--What's Wallingford
like now, sir?  I've said over and over again that I'd one day take the
Great Western to go and have a look and see what alterations had been
made.  But," regretfully, "it's never been anything more than talk.
I'd like Gertie to see the place though, so that she could tell whether
it comes up to my description."
</p><p>He seemed inclined to make an impetuous offer, but a brief shake of the
girl's head arrested him.  A boy entered and asked for an evening
newspaper, and Gertie attended to the transaction.
</p><p>"By the bye," turning to the stationery counter, "I want one or two
magazines."  Their heads came closely together as a selection was being
made; she whispered a caution not to stay too long.  In a louder voice,
Gertie announced that the total cost was two shillings and sixpence.
Mrs. Mills beamed across from the tobacco counter, and asked whether he
knew who was keeping "The Lamb"; Henry Douglass could not supply the
information, but guaranteed to obtain particulars, and bring them to
Praed Street.  Mrs. Mills declared herself ashamed to give so much
trouble.
</p><p>"Are you in business, sir, may I ask?"
</p><p>"I am, in a very small way, an architect."
</p><p>"Really?" said Gertie interestedly.
</p><p>"But," said Mrs. Mills, "you're not wearing a white tie!"
</p><p>"She's thinking of an archbishop," remarked Bulpert, coming forward.
"I'm pleased to make your acquaintance, sir.  Daresay you know me by
name."  He found a card in his letter-case, and Henry took it near the
light to examine the wording.
</p><p>"'Fred W. Bulpert,'" he read.  "'Society Entertainer and Elocutionist.'"
</p><p>"That's in the evenings, of course," said Bulpert.  "By day, I'm in the
West Central district.  Post Office, to tell you the truth.  I'll
trouble you for the card back, because I'm running somewhat short of
them.  And if you should be arranging a concert at any time, either for
your own benefit or any body else's, you might bear me in mind.  F. W.
B. is a great draw, if I may say so, because, you see, a lot of people
have heard him before."
</p><p>The customer asked whether there was an underground station near; Mrs.
Mills instructed Gertie to walk along with the young gentleman, and to
point out the building.  As they left, she urged Henry not to forget
his promise concerning the roses.
</p><p>"Nice, quiet-spoken lad," she commented.  "I wish Gertie would take up
with some one like him, or even you, and forget all about that society
young man she's been seen strolling with."
</p><p>"I hadn't heard about that," said Bulpert seriously.  "What are the
solid facts of the matter?  Why am I kept in the dark about everything?"
