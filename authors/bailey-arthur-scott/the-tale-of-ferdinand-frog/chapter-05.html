<p>Ferdinand Frog always looked so cheerful that no one ever suspected that
he had a secret sorrow. But it is true, nevertheless, that something
troubled him, though he took great pains not to let a single one of his
neighbors know that anything grieved him.
</p>
<p>His trouble was simply this: he had never been invited to attend the
singing-parties which the Frog family held almost every evening in Cedar
Swamp.
</p><p>Now, Ferdinand Frog loved to sing at night.
</p><p>Indeed, he liked nothing better than to go to the lake not far from the
Beaver dam and practice his songs among the lily pads near the shore. He
had a deep, powerful bass voice, which one could hear a mile or more
across the water on a still evening.
</p><p>Often he dressed himself with the greatest care and went to the lake
alone, where he stayed half the night and sang so loudly that a good
many of the wild folk who lived in the neighborhood thought him a great
nuisance. Not caring for music, they objected to being forced to listen
to Ferdinand Frog's favorite songs.
</p><p>"Why don't you go over to Cedar Swamp, if you want to make a noise?" one
of the Beaver family who was known as Tired Tim asked Mr. Frog one
evening. "You have come here for nine nights running; and your racket
has upset me so that I haven't done a stroke of work in all this time."
</p><p>Mr. Frog had puffed himself up and had just opened his mouth to begin a
new song. But upon being spoken to so rudely he closed his mouth quickly
and swallowed several times. For just a second or two he was speechless,
he was so surprised. And then presently he began to giggle.
</p><p>"I believe you," he said. "I believe that you haven't done a stroke of
work for ninety nights." He knew--as did everybody else--that Tired Tim
was the laziest person for miles around.
</p><p>"I said nine--not ninety," Tired Tim corrected him.
</p><p>"Oh! My mistake!" Mr. Frog replied.
</p><p>"You haven't answered my question," Tired Tim reminded him with a wide
yawn. "I asked you why you didn't attend the singing-parties over in
Cedar Swamp. You could croak your head off there and no one would stop
you."
</p><p>But Mr. Frog shook his head. And at the same time, he sighed.
</p><p>"No!" he said. "I'd rather sing here on the border of the lake. The
trouble is, <u>I sing too well</u> for those fellows over in Cedar Swamp."
</p><p>"Why don't you join them and teach them how to sing, if you know so much
about it?" Tired Tim persisted.
</p><p>"Oh, I've no time for that," Ferdinand Frog answered.
</p><p>And then it was his companion's turn to snicker.
</p><p>"You appear to have plenty of time to waste here," he observed. "It's my
opinion that there's just one reason why you don't go to the Cedar Swamp
singing parties."
</p><p>"What's that?" Mr. Frog inquired with a slight trace of uneasiness.
</p><p>"They haven't invited you."
</p><p>"How did you guess that?" Ferdinand Frog asked him.
</p><p>He wished, the next moment, that he had not put that question to Tired
Tim. For he saw at once that he had given his sad secret away.
