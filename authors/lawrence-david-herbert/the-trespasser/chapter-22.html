<p>Siegmund went up to Victoria. He was in no hurry to get down to
Wimbledon. London was warm and exhausted after the hot day, but this
peculiar lukewarmness was not unpleasant to him. He chose to walk from
Victoria to Waterloo.</p>

<p>The streets were like polished gun-metal glistened over with gold. The
taxi-cabs, the wild cats of the town, swept over the gleaming floor
swiftly, soon lessening in the distance, as if scornful of the other
clumsy-footed traffic. He heard the merry click-clock of the swinging
hansoms, then the excited whirring of the motor-buses as they charged
full-tilt heavily down the road, their hearts, as it seemed, beating
with trepidation; they drew up with a sigh of relief by the kerb, and
stood there panting - great, nervous, clumsy things. Siegmund was always
amused by the headlong, floundering career of the buses. He was pleased
with this scampering of the traffic; anything for distraction. He was
glad Helena was not with him, for the streets would have irritated her
with their coarse noise. She would stand for a long time to watch the
rabbits pop and hobble along on the common at night; but the tearing
along of the taxis and the charge of a great motor-bus was painful to
her. 'Discords,' she said, 'after the trees and sea.' She liked the
glistening of the streets; it seemed a fine alloy of gold laid down for
pavement, such pavement as drew near to the pure gold streets of Heaven;
but this noise could not be endured near any wonderland.</p>

<p>Siegmund did not mind it; it drummed out his own thoughts. He watched
the gleaming magic of the road, raced over with shadows, project itself
far before him into the night. He watched the people. Soldiers, belted
with scarlet, went jauntily on in front. There was a peculiar charm in
their movement. There was a soft vividness of life in their carriage; it
reminded Siegmund of the soft swaying and lapping of a poised
candle-flame. The women went blithely alongside. Occasionally, in
passing, one glanced at him; then, in spite of himself, he smiled; he
knew not why. The women glanced at him with approval, for he was ruddy;
besides, he had that carelessness and abstraction of despair. The eyes
of the women said, 'You are comely, you are lovable,' and
Siegmund smiled.</p>

<p>When the street opened, at Westminster, he noticed the city sky, a
lovely deep purple, and the lamps in the square steaming out a vapour of
grey-gold light.</p>

<p>'It is a wonderful night,' he said to himself. 'There are not two such
in a year.'</p>

<p>He went forward to the Embankment, with a feeling of elation in his
heart. This purple and gold-grey world, with the fluttering flame-warmth
of soldiers and the quick brightness of women, like lights that clip
sharply in a draught, was a revelation to him.</p>

<p>As he leaned upon the Embankment parapet the wonder did not fade, but
rather increased. The trams, one after another, floated loftily over the
bridge. They went like great burning bees in an endless file into a
hive, past those which were drifting dreamily out, while below, on the
black, distorted water, golden serpents flashed and twisted to and fro.</p>

<p>'Ah!' said Siegmund to himself; 'it is far too wonderful for me. Here,
as well as by the sea, the night is gorgeous and uncouth. Whatever
happens, the world is wonderful.'</p>

<p>So he went on amid all the vast miracle of movement in the city night,
the swirling of water to the sea, the gradual sweep of the stars, the
floating of many lofty, luminous cars through the bridged darkness, like
an army of angels filing past on one of God's campaigns, the purring
haste of the taxis, the slightly dancing shadows of people. Siegmund
went on slowly, like a slow bullet winging into the heart of life. He
did not lose this sense of wonder, not in the train, nor as he walked
home in the moonless dark.</p>

<p>When he closed the door behind him and hung up his hat he frowned. He
did not think definitely of anything, but his frown meant to him: 'Now
for the beginning of Hell!'</p>

<p>He went towards the dining-room, where the light was, and the uneasy
murmur. The clock, with its deprecating, suave chime, was striking ten,
Siegmund opened the door of the room. Beatrice was sewing, and did not
raise her head. Frank, a tall, thin lad of eighteen, was bent over a
book. He did not look up. Vera had her fingers thrust in among her hair,
and continued to read the magazine that lay on the table before her.
Siegmund looked at them all. They gave no sign to show they were aware
of his entry; there was only that unnatural tenseness of people who
cover their agitation. He glanced round to see where he should go. His
wicker arm-chair remained by the fireplace; his slippers were standing
under the sideboard, as he had left them. Siegmund sat down in the
creaking chair; he began to feel sick and tired.</p>

<p>'I suppose the children are in bed,' he said.</p>

<p>His wife sewed on as if she had not heard him; his daughter noisily
turned over a leaf and continued to read, as if she were pleasantly
interested and had known no interruption. Siegmund waited, with his
slipper dangling from his hand, looking from one to another.</p>

<p>'They've been gone two hours,' said Frank at last, still without raising
his eyes from his book. His tone was contemptuous, his voice was
jarring, not yet having developed a man's fullness.</p>

<p>Siegmund put on his slipper, and began to unlace the other boot. The
slurring of the lace through the holes and the snacking of the tag
seemed unnecessarily loud. It annoyed his wife. She took a breath to
speak, then refrained, feeling suddenly her daughter's scornful
restraint upon her. Siegmund rested his arms upon his knees, and sat
leaning forward, looking into the barren fireplace, which was littered
with paper, and orange-peel, and a banana-skin.</p>

<p>'Do you want any supper?' asked Beatrice, and the sudden harshness of
her voice startled him into looking at her.</p>

<p>She had her face averted, refusing to see him. Siegmund's heart went
down with weariness and despair at the sight of her.</p>

<p>'Aren't <span style="text-decoration: underline">you</span> having any?' he asked.</p>

<p>The table was not laid. Beatrice's work-basket, a little wicker
fruit-skep, overflowed scissors, and pins, and scraps of holland, and
reels of cotton on the green serge cloth. Vera leaned both her elbows on
the table.</p>

<p>Instead of replying to him, Beatrice went to the sideboard. She took out
a table-cloth, pushing her sewing litter aside, and spread the cloth
over one end of the table. Vera gave her magazine a little knock
with her hand.</p>

<p>'Have you read this tale of a French convent school in here, Mother?'
she asked.</p>

<p>'In where?'</p>

<p>In this month's <span style="text-decoration: underline">Nash's</span>.'</p>

<p>'No,' replied Beatrice. 'What time have I for reading, much less for
anything else?'</p>

<p>'You should think more of yourself, and a little less of other people,
then,' said Vera, with a sneer at the 'other people'. She rose. 'Let me
do this. You sit down; you are tired, Mother,' she said.</p>

<p>Her mother, without replying, went out to the kitchen. Vera followed
her. Frank, left alone with his father, moved uneasily, and bent his
thin shoulders lower over his book. Siegmund remained with his arms on
his knees, looking into the grate. From the kitchen came the chinking of
crockery, and soon the smell of coffee. All the time Vera was heard
chatting with affected brightness to her mother, addressing her in fond
tones, using all her wits to recall bright little incidents to retail to
her. Beatrice answered rarely, and then with utmost brevity.</p>

<p>Presently Vera came in with the tray. She put down a cup of coffee, a
plate with boiled ham, pink and thin, such as is bought from a grocer,
and some bread-and-butter. Then she sat down, noisily turning over the
leaves of her magazine. Frank glanced at the table; it was laid solely
for his father. He looked at the bread and the meat, but restrained
himself, and went on reading, or pretended to do so. Beatrice came in
with the small cruet; it was conspicuously bright.</p>

<p>Everything was correct: knife and fork, spoon, cruet, all perfectly
clean, the crockery fine, the bread and butter thin - in fact, it was
just as it would have been for a perfect stranger. This scrupulous
neatness, in a household so slovenly and easy-going, where it was an
established tradition that something should be forgotten or wrong,
impressed Siegmund. Beatrice put the serving knife and fork by the
little dish of ham, saw that all was proper, then went and sat down. Her
face showed no emotion; it was calm and proud. She began to sew.</p>

<p>'What do you say, Mother?' said Vera, as if resuming a conversation.
'Shall it be Hampton Court or Richmond on Sunday?'</p>

<p>'I say, as I said before,' replied Beatrice: 'I cannot afford to go
out.'</p>

<p>'But you must begin, my dear, and Sunday shall see the beginning. _D&icirc;tes
donc_!'</p>

<p>'There are other things to think of,' said Beatrice.</p>

<p>'Now, <span style="text-decoration: underline">maman, nous avons chang&eacute; tout cela</span>! We are going out - a jolly
little razzle!' Vera, who was rather handsome, lifted up her face and
smiled at her mother gaily.</p>

<p>'I am afraid there will be no <span style="text-decoration: underline">razzle</span>' - Beatrice accented the word,
smiling slightly - 'for me. You are slangy, Vera.'</p>

<p>'<span style="text-decoration: underline">Un doux argot, ma m&egrave;re</span>. You look tired.'</p>

<p>Beatrice glanced at the clock.</p>

<p>'I will go to bed when I have cleared the table,' she said.</p>

<p>Siegmund winced. He was still sitting with his head bent down, looking
in the grate. Vera went on to say something more. Presently Frank looked
up at the table, and remarked in his grating voice:</p>

<p>'There's your supper, Father.'</p>

<p>The women stopped and looked round at this. Siegmund bent his head
lower. Vera resumed her talk. It died out, and there was silence.</p>

<p>Siegmund was hungry.</p>

<p>'Oh, good Lord, good Lord! bread of humiliation tonight!' he said to
himself before he could muster courage to rise and go to the table. He
seemed to be shrinking inwards. The women glanced swiftly at him and
away from him as his chair creaked and he got up. Frank was watching
from under his eyebrows.</p>

<p>Siegmund went through the ordeal of eating and drinking in presence of
his family. If he had not been hungry, he could not have done it,
despite the fact that he was content to receive humiliation this night.
He swallowed the coffee with effort. When he had finished he sat
irresolute for some time; then he arose and went to the door.</p>

<p>'Good night!' he said.</p>

<p>Nobody made any reply. Frank merely stirred in his chair. Siegmund shut
the door and went.</p>

<p>There was absolute silence in the room till they heard him turn on the
tap in the bathroom; then Beatrice began to breathe spasmodically,
catching her breath as if she would sob. But she restrained herself. The
faces of the two children set hard with hate.</p>

<p>'He is not worth the flicking of your little finger, Mother,' said Vera.</p>

<p>Beatrice moved about with pitiful, groping hands, collecting her sewing
and her cottons.</p>

<p>'At any rate, he's come back red enough,' said Frank, in his grating
tone of contempt. 'He's like boiled salmon.'</p>

<p>Beatrice did not answer anything. Frank rose, and stood with his back to
the grate, in his father's characteristic attitude.</p>

<p>'He <span style="text-decoration: underline">would</span> come slinking back in a funk!' he said, with a young man's
sneer.</p>

<p>Stretching forward, he put a piece of ham between two pieces of bread,
and began to eat the sandwich in large bites. Vera came to the table at
this, and began to make herself a more dainty sandwich. Frank watched
her with jealous eyes.</p>

<p>'There is a little more ham, if you'd like it,' said Beatrice to him. 'I
kept you some.'</p>

<p>'All right, Ma,' he replied. Fetch it in.'</p>

<p>Beatrice went out to the kitchen.</p>

<p>'And bring the bread and butter, too, will you?' called Vera after her.</p>

<p>'The damned coward! Ain't he a rotten funker?' said Frank, <span style="text-decoration: underline">sotto voce</span>,
while his mother was out of the room.</p>

<p>Vera did not reply, but she seemed tacitly to agree.</p>

<p>They petted their mother, while she waited on them. At length Frank
yawned. He fidgeted a moment or two, then he went over to his mother,
and, putting his hand on her arm - the feel of his mother's round arm
under the black silk sleeve made his tears rise - he said, more gratingly
than ever:</p>

<p>'Ne'er mind, Ma; we'll be all right to you.' Then he bent and kissed
her. 'Good night, Mother,' he said awkwardly, and he went out of
the room.</p>

<p>Beatrice was crying.</p>
