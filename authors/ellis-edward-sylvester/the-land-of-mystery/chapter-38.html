<p>Such being the case, Ashman concluded that the time had arrived
when he should also take a hand.</p>

<p>Ziffak and King Haffgo placed their backs against the face of
the rocks, along which the ledge ran, so as to open a clear course
for the archer.  The latter fitted his arrow with great care and
then straightening up drew back the string and slowly levelled,
the missile at the head and breast of the American.</p>

<p>"Does that fool imagine I am going to keep still and let him
practice on me?" the latter asked himself, an instant before discharging
his rifle, whose bullet went straight through the dusky miscreant
and sent him toppling off the side of the ledge as dead as dead
could be.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the ball wounded the warrior directly behind
him, causing him to utter a howl which rang with piercing force
from side to side of the cavern of diamonds.</p>

<p>This prompt act caused something like a panic, Ziffak seemed
the most terrified of any.  Facing about, he flung his arms aloft
and shouted to the rest to hurry away before the white man killed
them all.</p>

<p>They lost no time in obeying, and it was noticeable that King
Haffgo, being well at the rear, added his frenzied commands for
his warriors to lose no time in leaving the fatal spot.</p>

<p>Ashman could have sent a succession of shots along the ridge,
as the party scrambled away, which would have toppled the dusky
barbarians off like so many ten-pins; but he had no desire to
inflict needless slaughter, and, in answer to the appeal of the
shrinking Ariel, he had promised her that, so far as he was concerned,
her parent should receive no harm.</p>

<p>He therefore contented himself with watching them, until a bend
in the ledge hid them from sight, with the exception of their
heads, and they, too, soon disappeared; because the frightened
warriors, glancing back, and seeing their peril, crouched low
to escape the bullets which they seemed to expect would come whistling
about their crowns.</p>

<p>As long as the natives kept at such a distance, they could do
no harm to the defenders; for they were too far off to make use
of their javelins, and the single archer left was not likely to
attempt to bring his weapon into play.</p>

<p>Naturally, Ashman and Ariel, finding they were left to themselves
for a time, fell to speculating upon what was likely to be the
next move of their enemies.  He believed they would make an attempt
to bridge the chasm separating them, a task which, as will be
seen, was comparatively easy of accomplishment.</p>

<p>But should such a structure be laid, it must be so strait that
only one could pass at a time, and the American could pick them
off as often as they presented themselves.  There were now no
firearms at the command of the Murhapas, unless some one recovered
the weapon of Burkhardt, and even then, Ashman would feel little
fear of harm from the savages.</p>

<p>Ariel thought her parent and his little company would simply
keep guard at the entrance of the cavern, in order to intercept
them, if they discovered some way of re-crossing the chasm and
attempted to leave.</p>

<p>But both were wrong.</p>

<p>The young man was resolved that no march should be stolen upon
him.  It was impossible for the Murhapas to pass far enough around
to leave the place, without being seen, provided he kept unremitting
watch, which he felt competent to do for a number of hours to
come.</p>

<p>If the siege was prolonged, he could take turns with Ariel, whose
bright eyes were quicker of perception than his.</p>

<p>In the cavern of diamonds, there was no means of telling when
it was day or night on the earth outside.  Lit by the eternal
fires of the volcano, it was always day; but he carried a watch,
which told him that the night was far advanced, and that the bright
sun would soon shine upon mountain, forest, and river again, though
his heart sank at the faint prospect of it ever being his privilege
to greet the orb again.</p>

<p>The incidents of the next hour mystified both Ashman and Ariel.</p>

<p>The first movement which attracted their notice, was Ziffak,
who, rising to the upright posture, so that his immense shoulders
were in plain sight, was seen picking his way along the ledge,
until he reached the opening on the other side.  Through this
he passed and was seen no more.</p>

<p>It was useless to speculate as to the meaning of this proceeding,
which could not be explained until made clear by occurrences themselves. 
It was safe to assume, however, that it was ostensibly in the
interests of King Haffgo, and therefore against those of the fugitive
lovers.</p>

<p>Probably a half-hour after the disappearance of the chieftain,
two of the party were seen stealing along the ledge in the direction
of the entrance to the cavern.  These, however, were of such slight
stature, when compared with Ziffak, and they made such efforts
to conceal their movements, that it was hard to follow or identify
them.  Ashman thought that Haffgo was one of the number, but he
could not make certain, and, since Ariel did not catch as favoring
a glimpse as he, she could give no help in solving the question.</p>

<p>The best solution of the singular acts was that while the Murhapas
seemed to try to hide themselves from the lovers, they still took
pains to allow enough to be disclosed to reveal the movements,
which they wished the couple to observe.</p>

<p>And here again, both Ashman and Ariel were in error.</p>

<p>Strange that a possibility which had once been thought of by
the two did not occur again to them.</p>

<p>King Haffgo, despite his confidence in Ziffak, began to feel
some distrust of him.  His refusal to attempt the leap of the
chasm, and his former friendship for the explorers, might have
been reasonably explained, but his failure to drive his javelin
through the white man, who was so near and who never stirred from
his position, could not be an accident.  He knew the marvellous
skill of the head chieftain, who could have had but one cause
for missing Ashman: that was an intentional deviation of his weapon,
which, slight though it was, proved as effective as if hurled
in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>And yet, shrewd as was Ziffak; he really believed he had deceived
his royal brother.  No suspicion of the distrust in the mind of
the king came to the chieftain, when he was directed to return
to the village and bring ten more warriors with him.</p>

<p>But this errand secured the absence of Ziffak for a couple of
hours at least, and that was the sole purpose of Haffgo in sending
him out of the cavern of diamonds.</p>

<p>When the chieftain was gone, the archer was directed to ascertain
how far he could steal around the cavern, by taking the opposite
course. Haffgo followed, directing the others to stay where they
were until further orders were given them.</p>

<p>The archer set out at once, ahead of the king, both doing their
best to avoid detection.</p>

<p>Fortune favored them in an unexpected manner.  The ledge was
found easier of travel than they expected, and, by using great
care, they worked their way to a point less than two hundred feet
from where the fugitives were standing on guard.  They had traversed
the whole distance, too, without detection.</p>

<p>When King Haffgo peered carefully over the shoulders of the crouching
bowman, he saw the couple standing with their backs toward him,
as they faced the chasm which had been found impassable for the
Murhapas.</p>

<p>The slumbering anger in the parent's breast was kindled to a
white heat, when he observed the white man holding the hand of
his daughter, and he saw him lean over and touch his lips to hers. 
He whispered to the warrior to lose no time.</p>

<p>The latter quickly examined his arrows, and picked out the one
which not only seemed the best, but was most plentifully provided
with the deadly poison.  This was speedily fitted to the string,
and he deliberately took aim, his nerves like steel, for the king
had whispered to him that he must not fail.</p>

<p>At the instant the string twanged, something caused Ariel to
look behind them.</p>

<p>She uttered a faint scream as she caught sight of the two crouching
figures.  She descried a flitting shadow which she knew was the
approaching missile on its deadly mission.</p>

<p>Knowing that it was aimed at her lover, she threw both her arms
around his neck and interposed her body to protect him while he
stood bewildered, not comprehending what it all meant.</p>

<p>Her figure was too slight to serve the purpose of a shield. 
The poisoned arrow whizzed straight at the breast of Ashman, who
had turned about, but instead of entering his body, the point,
surcharged with venom, was imbedded in the snowy arm of Ariel
herself!</p>
