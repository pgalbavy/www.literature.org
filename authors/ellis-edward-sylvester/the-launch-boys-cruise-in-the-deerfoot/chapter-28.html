<p>The words of George struck Alvin and Chester like "the knell
of doom." They looked in each other's faces, white and silent
for a brief spell; then Alvin whispered:</p>

<p>"He must have fallen overboard."</p>

<p>"And he couldn't swim a stroke," added Chester, in the same husky
undertone.</p>

<p>They said no more, but, keeping their feet, stared at the <em>Deerfoot</em>
wallowing in the gentle sea, like a helpless wreck. A faint hope
sprang up in their hearts that, after all, Mike might have been
overcome by sleep and would be found curled up in the cockpit.
They could not see the bottom of the compartment until quite near.
Then a single searching glance told them it was empty. He might
have crept under the deck forward or aft, but it was hardly possible
he had done so.</p>

<p>George ran the <em>Shark</em> with skill close beside the other
boat. The moment it was within reach Alvin leaped across, landing
on the stern, from which he bounded down into the cockpit and
peered into the obscurity in front. That too was devoid of a sign
of life. He and his chum were the only ones on the motor boat.</p>

<p>Now that their worst fears seemed to be confirmed a strange calmness
came over both. Their voices were low but even, as are those of
people in the presence of death.</p>

<p>"What do you think stopped the boat?" asked Chester.</p>

<p>"It is easy to find out."</p>

<p>His first action answered the question. A glance into the gasoline
tank showed that it was empty of all fluid. The source of power
had been used up.</p>

<p>"There may have been other causes, but that was enough," remarked
Alvin. "I'll look into things on our way back."</p>

<p>His first plan was to borrow enough gasoline from George to run
the <em>Deerfoot</em> on the homeward trip, but George thought
he had none to spare.</p>

<p>"I can tow you to town," he added.</p>

<p>"That will do as well."</p>

<p>The tow-line was passed over the bow and George made it fast
to a cleat on the stern deck of the <em>Shark</em>. Then he resumed
his moderate speed toward Boothbay Harbor. It was not a long run
and Alvin spent much of the time in inspecting the mechanism of
his motor boat. To repress so far as he could his profound grief,
he kept up a running commentary or explanation to Chester, who
really did not require it, for he knew a good deal about motor
boats. But he listened as if it were all new to him, and asked
questions. His purpose was the same as his friend's: they talked
about everything else in the vain effort to keep their minds from
the awful theme that bowed them both with a sorrow they had never
known before.</p>

<p>"If when the ignition system is in good order, the carburettor
properly adjusted and the compression cocks closed, there is a
lack of power, it may be due to carbon or some foreign substance
on the seats of the exhaust or inlet valves. Even so small a thing
as a flake of metal or of emery left from a former grinding may
lodge on the valve seat or under the valve stem and cause loss
of power, or a crack in the head of the piston or cylinder or
a broken or worn piston ring may give the same result."</p>

<p>"I have heard of those and other causes," said Chester, as the
two sat side by side, "but what is the most common one?"</p>

<p>"The valves, when they need grinding. I have not had that trouble
yet with the <em>Deerfoot</em>, and when I do I shall not try
to do the grinding myself. The work is so delicate that it should
be done only by an expert mechanic."</p>

<p>"What causes backfiring, through the carburettor, Alvin?"</p>

<p>"The ignition of the gas in the inlet pipe by a flame in the
cylinder left over from a former explosion after the inlet valve
opens, or by too weak a mixture, by dirt in the carburettor, a
leaky inlet valve, or too small a fuel pipe. I have known an open
throttle and late spark to cause backfiring. If with low speed
and a little more feeding of fuel the backfiring continues, you
must look for carbon deposits in the combustion chamber."</p>

<p>"Many persons are puzzled by explosions in the muffler. Are you?"</p>

<p>"I learned from my instructor that they are produced by an unignited
charge entering the muffler and being fired by the hot gases from
the next explosion in the cylinder. This does no harm, and if
the muffler is strong is a good thing, for it blows out the smoke
and dirt that have accumulated."</p>

<p>"The trouble with&mdash;with&mdash;<em>him</em>, you say, was the lack
of fuel."</p>

<p>"Yes, but he might have had plenty of gasoline and found the
engine dead on his hands. Water or dirt in the carburettor plays
the mischief."</p>

<p>And so the questions and answers went on&mdash;so many of them that
you would find their reading tedious. The pitiful part of the
whole business was that, as I have said, Chester could have made
clear everything asked as well as his chum and the chum knew it.
It was a pathetic attempt to hold their minds from the one gruesome,
oppressive truth.</p>

<p>But they were too manly to shirk their duty. Nothing was to be
gained by turning from that which sooner or later must be faced.
Two of the saddest calls upon them must be answered.</p>

<p>"Shall we search for the body before letting his father and mother
know?" asked Chester, when they had passed McKown Point and were
entering the harbor of Boothbay.</p>

<p>"I don't know what is best. They will soon hear of it and will
be frantic until the body is found."</p>

<p>"It is not likely to come up and float for several days, and
there's no saying where the currents will take it. A few years
ago a fisherman was drowned off the eastern side of Squirrel and
was found a week later several miles up the Damariscotta. Some
one will come upon poor Mike sooner or later, when not looking
for him."</p>

<p>"Our search may be a short one, for I don't think the body will
drift far for some time to come. We must not stop until it is
found."</p>

<p>"Now no one beside ourselves knows what has happened except George,
who is towing us. We will get him to say nothing about it, until
he has permission from us. In that way the secret will be safe
for a few days."</p>

<p>George gave his promise, and the boys decided not to make the
woeful truth known to the parents until all hope of recovering
the body through their efforts was gone.</p>

<p>For years a huge box-like structure has floated in the harbor
of Boothbay, upon which is painted in big letters the announcement
that it has gasoline for sale. Towed beside this, Alvin speedily
had his tank filled with the fuel. The inspection which he had
made of his launch showed that nothing was the matter with it,
and when put to the test the engine ran with its usual ease and
smoothness. He paid George for his services, taking the occasion
to remind him of his pledge to say nothing about their unfortunate
friend until he received permission. Then, without going to the
float or wharf, where many landings are made, Alvin whirled over
the wheel, turned the boat round and headed southward toward the
Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>Naturally it seemed to them that their search should begin in
the neighborhood of where the drifting <em>Deerfoot</em> was discovered.
It was strange that with vessels of all kinds passing at no great
distance none of them had noticed the plight of the motor boat.
Had it not been taken in tow by the runabout, it could not have
remained an estray much longer.</p>

<p>Passing to the eastward of Squirrel Island, Alvin continued southward
until he had rounded Fisherman, when he diverged so as to leave
the Hypocrites on his left and the upper of the White Islands
on his right. This brought him into the section where the derelict
had been sighted.</p>

<p>"Now," said Chester, who sat directly behind his chum and close
enough for both to talk freely, "if poor Mike had known how to
swim there might be a faint hope that he had reached one of the
small islands not far off."</p>

<p>"I can't understand how he could have fallen overboard; it would
seem that when he found himself going, he would have grasped something.
He might have seized hold of one of the propeller blades."</p>

<p>"To do that he would have had to keep himself afloat for a brief
time, and we know he could not do that."</p>

<p>Alvin always carried a pair of binoculars on the boat, though
they were not the equal in excellence of those belonging on the
runabout. Chester made continual use of these, while the Captain
depended upon his unassisted eyes to scan the waste of waters.
He held the <em>Deerfoot</em> to a low speed, for he meant to
make the search as thorough as he could.</p>

<p>"There's no saying how far out to sea Mike went before turning
back&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Hark!</em>" gasped Alvin, almost leaping from his seat.</p>

<p>And then through the soft still air they heard the call:</p>

<p>"<em>Arrah, now, ye spalpeens! Come to me arms and obsarve me
give an imitation of a gintleman starving to death!</em>"</p>
