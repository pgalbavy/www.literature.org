<p>Standing in the black group under gaunt trees at the cemetery,
three days later, Bibbs unwillingly let an old, old thought become
definite in his mind: the sickly brother had buried the strong
brother, and Bibbs wondered how many million times that had happened
since men first made a word to name the sons of one mother. Almost
literally he had buried his strong brother, for Sheridan had gone
to pieces when he saw his dead son. He had nothing to help him
meet the shock, neither definite religion nor "philosophy" definite
or indefinite. He could only beat his forehead and beg, over and
over, to be killed with an ax, while his wife was helpless except
to entreat him not to "take on," herself adding a continuous lamentation.
Edith, weeping, made truce with Sibyl and saw to it that the mourning
garments were beyond criticism. Roscoe was dazed, and he shirked,
justifying himself curiously by saying he "never had any experience
in such matters." So it was Bibbs, the shy outsider, who became,
during this dreadful little time, the master of the house; for
as strange a thing as that, sometimes, may be the result of a
death. He met the relatives from out of town at the station; he
set the time for the funeral and the time for meals; he selected
the flowers and he selected Jim's coffin; he did all the grim
things and all the other things. Jim had belonged to an order
of Knights, who lengthened the rites with a picturesque ceremony
of their own, and at first Bibbs wished to avoid this, but upon
reflection he offered no objection&mdash;he divined that the Knights
and their service would be not precisely a consolation, but a
satisfaction to his father. So the Knights led the procession,
with their band playing a dirge part of the long way to the cemetery;
and then turned back, after forming in two lines, plumed hats
sympathetically in hand, to let the hearse and the carriages pass
between.</p>

<p>"Mighty fine-lookin' men," said Sheridan, brokenly. "They all&mdash;all
liked him. He was&mdash;" His breath caught in a sob and choked him.
"He was&mdash;a Grand Supreme Herald."</p>

<p>Bibbs had divined aright.</p>

<p>"Dust to dust," said the minister, under the gaunt trees; and
at that Sheridan shook convulsively from head to foot. All of
the black group shivered, except Bibbs, when it came to "Dust
to dust." Bibbs stood passive, for he was the only one of them
who had known that thought as a familiar neighbor; he had been
close upon dust himself for a long, long time, and even now he
could prophesy no protracted separation between himself and dust.
The machine-shop had brought him very close, and if he had to
go back it would probably bring him closer still; so close&mdash;as
Dr. Gurney predicted&mdash;that no one would be able to tell the difference
between dust and himself. And Sheridan, if Bibbs read him truly,
would be all the more determined to "make a man" of him, now that
there was a man less in the family. To Bibbs's knowledge, no one
and nothing had ever prevented his father from carrying through
his plans, once he had determined upon them; and Sheridan was
incapable of believing that any plan of his would not work out
according to his calculations. His nature unfitted him to accept
failure. He had the gift of terrible persistence, and with unflecked
confidence that his way was the only way he would hold to that
way of "making a man" of Bibbs, who understood very well, in his
passive and impersonal fashion, that it was a way which might
make, not a man, but dust of him. But he had no shudder for the
thought.</p>

<p>He had no shudder for that thought or for any other thought.
The truth about Bibbs was in the poem which Edith had adopted:
he had so thoroughly formed the over-sensitive habit of hiding
his feelings that no doubt he had forgotten&mdash;by this time&mdash;where
he had put some of them, especially those which concerned himself.
But he had not hidden his feelings about his father where they
could not be found. He was strange to his father, but his father
was not strange to him. He knew that Sheridan's plans were conceived
in the stubborn belief that they would bring about a good thing
for Bibbs himself; and whatever the result was to be, the son
had no bitterness. Far otherwise, for as he looked at the big,
woeful figure, shaking and tortured, an almost unbearable pity
laid hands upon Bibbs's throat. Roscoe stood blinking, his lip
quivering; Edith wept audibly; Mrs. Sheridan leaned in half collapse
against her husband; but Bibbs knew that his father was the one
who cared.</p>

<p>It was over. Men in overalls stepped forward with their shovels,
and Bibbs nodded quickly to Roscoe, making a slight gesture toward
the line of waiting carriages. Roscoe understood &mdash;Bibbs
would stay and see the grave filled; the rest were to go. The
groups began to move away over the turf; wheels creaked on the
graveled drive; and one by one the carriages filled and departed,
the horses setting off at a walk. Bibbs gazed steadfastly at the
workmen; he knew that his father kept looking back as he went
toward the carriage, and that was a thing he did not want to see.
But after a little while there were no sounds of wheels or hoofs
on the gravel, and Bibbs, glancing up, saw that every one had
gone. A coupe had been left for him, the driver dozing patiently.</p>

<p>The workmen placed the flowers and wreaths upon the mound and
about it, and Bibbs altered the position of one or two of these,
then stood looking thoughtfully at the grotesque brilliancy of
that festal-seeming hillock beneath the darkening November sky.
"It's too bad!" he half whispered, his lips forming the words&mdash;and
his meaning was that it was too bad that the strong brother had
been the one to go. For this was his last thought before he walked
to the coupe and saw Mary Vertrees standing, all alone, on the
other side of the drive.</p>

<p>She had just emerged from a grove of leafless trees that grew
on a slope where the tombs were many; and behind her rose a multitude
of the barbaric and classic shapes we so strangely strew about
our graveyards: urn-crowned columns and stone-draped obelisks,
shop-carved angels and shop-carved children poising on pillars
and shafts, all lifting&mdash;in unthought pathos&mdash;their blind stoniness
toward the sky. Against such a background, Bibbs was not incongruous,
with his figure, in black, so long and slender, and his face so
long and thin and white; nor was the undertaker's coupe out of
keeping, with the shabby driver dozing on the box and the shaggy
horses standing patiently in attitudes without hope and without
regret. But for Mary Vertrees, here was a grotesque setting&mdash;she
was a vivid, living creature of a beautiful world. And a graveyard
is not the place for people to look charming.</p>

<p>She also looked startled and confused, but not more startled
and confused than Bibbs. In "Edith's" poem he had declared his
intention of hiding his heart "among the stars"; and in his boyhood
one day he had successfully hidden his body in the coal-pile.
He had been no comrade of other boys or of girls, and his acquaintances
of a recent period were only a few fellow-invalids and the nurses
at the Hood Sanitarium. All his life Bibbs had kept himself to
himself&mdash;he was but a shy onlooker in the world. Nevertheless,
the startled gaze he bent upon the unexpected lady before him
had causes other than his shyness and her unexpectedness. For
Mary Vertrees had been a shining figure in the little world of
late given to the view of this humble and elusive outsider, and
spectators sometimes find their hearts beating faster than those
of the actors in the spectacle. Thus with Bibbs now. He started
and stared; he lifted his hat with incredible awkwardness, his
fingers fumbling at his forehead before they found the brim.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sheridan," said Mary, "I'm afraid you'll have to take me
home with you. <em>I&mdash;" </em>She stopped, not lacking a momentary
awkwardness of her own.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;yes," Bibbs stammered. "I'll&mdash;I'll be de &mdash;Won't
you get in?"</p>

<p>In that manner and in that place they exchanged their first words.
Then Mary without more ado got into the coupe, and Bibbs followed,
closing the door.</p>

<p>"You're very kind," she said, somewhat breathlessly. "I should
have had to walk, and it's beginning to get dark. It's three miles,
I think."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bibbs. "It&mdash;it is beginning to get dark. I &mdash;I
noticed that."</p>

<p>"I ought to tell you &mdash;<em>I&mdash;" </em>Mary began, confusedly.
She bit her lip, sat silent a moment, then spoke with composure.
"It must seem odd, my&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no!" Bibbs protested, earnestly. "Not in the&mdash;in the least."</p>

<p>"It does, though," said Mary. "I had not intended to come to
the cemetery, Mr. Sheridan, but one of the men in charge at the
house came and whispered to me that 'the family wished me to'
&mdash;I think your sister sent him. So I came. But when we reached
here <em>I&mdash;</em>oh, I felt that perhaps I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bibbs nodded gravely. "Yes, yes," he murmured.</p>

<p>"I got out on the opposite side of the carriage," she continued.
"I mean opposite from&mdash;from where all of you were. And I wandered
off over in the other direction; and I didn't realize how little
time it takes. From where I was I couldn't see the carriages leaving&mdash;at
least I didn't notice them. So when I got back, just now, you
were the only one here. I didn't know the other people in the
carriage I came in, and of course they didn't think to wait for
me. That's why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bibbs, "<em>I&mdash;" </em>And that seemed all he had
to say just then.</p>

<p>Mary looked out through the dusty window. "I think we'd better
be going home, if you please," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes," Bibbs agreed, not moving. "It will be dark before we get
there."</p>

<p>She gave him a quick little glance. "I think you must be very
tired, Mr. Sheridan; and I know you have reason to be," she said,
gently. "If you'll let me, I'll&mdash;" And without explaining her
purpose she opened the door on her side of the coupe and leaned
out.</p>

<p>Bibbs started in blank perplexity, not knowing what she meant
to do.</p>

<p>"Driver!" she called, in her clear voice, loudly. "Driver! We'd
like to start, please! Driver! Stop at the house just north of
Mr. Sheridan's, please." The wheels began to move, and she leaned
back beside Bibbs once more. "I noticed that he was asleep when
we got in," she said. "I suppose they have a great deal of night
work."</p>

<p>Bibbs drew a long breath and waited till he could command his
voice. "I've never been able to apologize quickly," he said, with
his accustomed slowness, "because if I try to I stammer. My brother
Roscoe whipped me once, when we were boys, for stepping on his
slate-pencil. It took me so long to tell him it was an accident,
he finished before I did."</p>

<p>Mary Vertrees had never heard anything quite like the drawling,
gentle voice or the odd implication that his not noticing the
motionless state of their vehicle was an "accident." She had formed
a casual impression of him, not without sympathy, but at once
she discovered that he was unlike any of her cursory and vague
imaginings of him. And suddenly she saw a picture he had not intended
to paint for sympathy: a sturdy boy hammering a smaller, sickly
boy, and the sickly boy unresentful. Not that picture alone; others
flashed before her. Instantaneously she had a glimpse of Bibbs's
life and into his life. She had a queer feeling, new to her experience,
of knowing him instantly. It startled her a little; and then,
with some surprise, she realized that she was glad he had sat
so long, after getting into the coupe, before he noticed that
it had not started. What she did not realize, however, was that
she had made no response to his apology, and they passed out of
the cemetery gates, neither having spoken again.</p>

<p>Bibbs was so content with the silence he did not know that it
was silence. The dusk, gathering in their small inclosure, was
filled with a rich presence for him; and presently it was so dark
that neither of the two could see the other, nor did even their
garments touch. But neither had any sense of being alone. The
wheels creaked steadily, rumbling presently on paved streets;
there were the sounds, as from a distance, of the plod-plod of
the horses; and sometimes the driver became audible, coughing
asthmatically, or saying, "You, <em>JOE!" </em>with a spiritless
flap of the whip upon an unresponsive back. Oblongs of light from
the lamps at street-corners came swimming into the interior of
the coupe and, thinning rapidly to lances, passed utterly, leaving
greater darkness. And yet neither of these two last attendants
at Jim Sheridan's funeral broke the silence.</p>

<p>It was Mary who preceived the strangeness of it&mdash;too late. Abruptly
she realized that for an indefinite interval she had been thinking
of her companion and not talking to him. "Mr. Sheridan," she began,
not knowing what she was going to say, but impelled to say anything,
as she realized the queerness of this drive&mdash;"Mr. Sheridan, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>The coupe stopped. "You, <em>JOE!" </em>said the driver, reproachfully,
and climbed down and opened the door.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?" Bibbs inquired.</p>

<p>"Lady said stop at the first house north of Mr. Sheridan's, sir."</p>

<p>Mary was incredulous; she felt that it couldn't be true and that
it mustn't be true that they had driven all the way without speaking.</p>

<p>"What?" Bibbs demanded.</p>

<p>"We're there, sir," said the driver, sympathetically. "Next house
north of Mr. Sheridan's."</p>

<p>Bibbs descended to the curb. "Why, yes," he said. "Yes, you seem
to be right." And while he stood staring at the dimly illuminated
front windows of Mr. Vertrees's house Mary got out, unassisted.</p>

<p>"Let me help you," said Bibbs, stepping toward her mechanically;
and she was several feet from the coupe when he spoke.</p>

<p>"Oh no," she murmured. "I think I can&mdash;" She meant that she could
get out of the coupe without help, but, perceiving that she had
already accomplished this feat, she decided not to complete the
sentence.</p>

<p>"You, <em>JOE!" </em>cried the driver, angrily, climbing to his
box. And he rumbled away at his team's best pace&mdash;a snail's.</p>

<p>"Thank you for bringing me home, Mr. Sheridan," said Mary, stiffly.
She did not offer her hand. "Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night," Bibbs said in response, and, turning with her,
walked beside her to the door. Mary made that a short walk; she
almost ran. Realization of the queerness of their drive was growing
upon her, beginning to shock her; she stepped aside from the light
that fell through the glass panels of the door and withheld her
hand as it touched the old-fashioned bell-handle.</p>

<p>"I'm quite safe, thank you," she said, with a little emphasis.
"Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night," said Bibbs, and went obediently. When he reached
the street he looked back, but she had vanished within the house.</p>

<p>Moving slowly away, he caromed against two people who were turning
out from the pavement to cross the street. They were Roscoe and
his wife.</p>

<p>"Where are your eyes, Bibbs?" demanded Roscoe. "Sleep-walking,
as usual?"</p>

<p>But Sibyl took the wanderer by the arm. "Come over to our house
for a little while, Bibbs," she urged. "I want to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I'd better&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. I want you to. Your father's gone to bed, and they're all
quiet over there&mdash;all worn out. Just come for a minute."</p>

<p>He yielded, and when they were in the house she repeated herself
with real feeling: "'All worn out!' Well, if anybody is, <em>YOU
</em>are, Bibbs! And I don't wonder; you've done every bit of
the work of it. You mustn't get down sick again. I'm going to
make you take a little brandy."</p>

<p>He let her have her own way, following her into the dining-room,
and was grateful when she brought him a tiny glass filled from
one of the decanters on the sideboard. Roscoe gloomily poured
for himself a much heavier libation in a larger glass; and the
two men sat, while Sibyl leaned against the sideboard, reviewing
the episodes of the day and recalling the names of the donors
of flowers and wreaths. She pressed Bibbs to remain longer when
he rose to go, and then, as he persisted, she went with him to
the front door. He opened it, and she said:</p>

<p>"Bibbs, you were coming out of the Vertreeses' house when we
met you. How did you happen to be there?"</p>

<p>"I had only been to the door," he said. "Good night, Sibyl."</p>

<p>"Wait," she insisted. "We saw you coming out."</p>

<p>"I wasn't," he explained, moving to depart. "I'd just brought
Miss Vertrees home."</p>

<p>"What?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, and stepped out upon the porch, "that was it.
Good night, Sibyl."</p>

<p>"Wait!" she said, following him across the threshold. "How did
that happen? I thought you were going to wait while those men
filled the&mdash;the&mdash;" She paused, but moved nearer him insistently.</p>

<p>"I did wait. Miss Vertrees was there," he said, reluctantly.
"She had walked away for a while and didn't notice that the carriages
were leaving. When she came back the coupe waiting for me was
the only one left."</p>

<p>Sibyl regarded him with dilating eyes. She spoke with a slow
breathlessness. "And she drove home from Jim's funeral&mdash;with you!"</p>

<p>Without warning she burst into laughter, clapped her hand ineffectually
over her mouth, and ran back uproariously into the house, hurling
the door shut behind her.</p>
