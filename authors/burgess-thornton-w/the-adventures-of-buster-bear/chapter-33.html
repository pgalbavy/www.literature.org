<p>The question is, did Buster Bear steal Farmer Brown's boy's pail?
To steal is to take something which belongs to some one else.
There is no doubt that he stole the berries that were in the pail
when he found it, for he deliberately ate them. He knew well enough
that some one must have picked them&mdash;for whoever heard of blueberries
growing in tin pails? So there is no doubt that when Buster took
them, he stole them. But with the pail it was different. He took
the pail, but he didn't mean to take it. In fact, he didn't want
that pail at all.</p>

<p>You see it was this way: When Buster found that big tin pail
brimming full of delicious berries in the shade of that big bush
in the Old Pasture, he didn't stop to think whether or not he
had a right to them. Buster is so fond of berries that from the
very second that his greedy little eyes saw that pailful, he forgot
everything but the feast that was waiting for him right under
his very nose. He didn't think anything about the right or wrong
of helping himself. There before him were more berries than he
had ever seen together at one time in all his life, and all he
had to do was to eat and eat and eat. And that is just what he
did do. Of course he upset the pail, but he didn't mind a little
thing like that. When he had gobbled up all the berries that rolled
out, he thrust his nose into the pail to get all that were left
in it. Just then he heard a little noise, as if some one were
coming. He threw up his head to listen, and somehow, he never
did know just how, the handle of the pail slipped back over his
ears and caught there.</p>

<p>This was bad enough, but to make matters worse, just at that
very minute he heard a shrill, angry voice shout, "Hi, there!
Get out of there!" He didn't need to be told whose voice that
was. It was the voice of Farmer Brown's boy. Right then and there
Buster Bear nearly had a fit. There was that awful pail fast over
his head so that he couldn't see a thing. Of course, that meant
that he couldn't run away, which was the thing of all things he
most wanted to do, for big as he is and strong as he is, Buster
is very shy and bashful when human beings are around. He growled
and whined and squealed. He tried to back out of the pail and
couldn't. He tried to shake it off and couldn't. He tried to pull
it off, but somehow he couldn't get hold of it. Then there was
another yell. If Buster hadn't been so frightened himself, he
might have recognized that second yell as one of fright, for that
is what it was. You see Farmer Brown's boy had just discovered
Buster Bear. When he had yelled the first time, he had supposed
that it was one of the young cattle who live in the Old Pasture
all summer, but when he saw Buster, he was just as badly frightened
as Buster himself. In fact, he was too surprised and frightened
even to run. After that second yell he just stood still and stared.</p>

<p>Buster clawed at that awful thing on his head more frantically
than ever. Suddenly it slipped off, so that he could see. He gave
one frightened look at Farmer Brown's boy, and then with a mighty
"Woof!" he started for the Green Forest as fast as his legs could
take him, and this was very fast indeed, let me tell you. He didn't
stop to pick out a path, but just crashed through the bushes as
if they were nothing at all, just nothing at all. But the funniest
thing of all is this&mdash;he took that pail with him! Yes, Sir, Buster
Bear ran away with the big tin pail of Farmer Brown's boy! You
see when it slipped off his head, the handle was still around
his neck, and there he was running away with a pail hanging from
his neck! He didn't want it. He would have given anything to get
rid of it. But he took it because he couldn't help it. And that
brings us back to the question, did Buster steal Farmer Brown's
boy's pail? What do you think?</p>
