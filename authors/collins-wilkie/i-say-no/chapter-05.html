<P>
Left by herself, Miss de Sor turned back again by way of the
trees.
<P>
So far, her interview with the drawing-master had helped to pass
the time. Some girls might have found it no easy task to arrive
at a true view of the character of Alban Morris. Francine's
essentially superficial observation set him down as "a little
mad," and left him there, judged and dismissed to her own entire
satisfaction.
<P>
Arriving at the lawn, she discovered Emily pacing backward and
forward, with her head down and her hands behind her, deep in
thought. Francine's high opinion of herself would have carried
her past any of the other girls, unless they had made special
advances to her. She stopped and looked at Emily.
<P>
It is the sad fate of little women in general to grow too fat and
to be born with short legs. Emily's slim finely-strung figure
spoke for itself as to the first of these misfortunes, and
asserted its happy freedom from the second, if she only walked
across a room. Nature had built her, from head to foot, on a
skeleton-scaffolding in perfect proportion. Tall or short matters
little to the result, in women who possess the first and foremost
advantage of beginning well in their bones. When they live to old
age, they often astonish thoughtless men, who walk behind them in
the street. "I give you my honor, she was as easy and upright as
a young girl; and when you got in front of her and looked--white
hair, and seventy years of age."
<P>
Francine approached Emily, moved by a rare impulse in her
nature--the impulse to be sociable. "You look out of spirits,"
she began. "Surely you don't regret leaving school?"
<P>
In her present mood, Emily took the opportunity (in the popular
phrase) of snubbing Francine. "You have guessed wrong; I do
regret," she answered. "I have found in Cecilia my dearest friend
at school. And school brought with it the change in my life which
has helped me to bear the loss of my father. If you must know
what I was thinking of just now, I was thinking or my aunt. She
has not answered my last letter--and I'm beginning to be afraid
she is ill."
<P>
"I'm very sorry," said Francine.
<P>
"Why? You don't know my aunt; and you have only known me since
yesterday afternoon. Why are you sorry?"
<P>
Francine remained silent. Without realizing it, she was beginning
to feel the dominant influence that Emily exercised over the
weaker natures that came in contact with her. To find herself
irresistibly attracted by a stranger at a new school--an
unfortunate little creature, whose destiny was to earn her own
living--filled the narrow mind of Miss de Sor with perplexity.
Having waited in vain for a reply, Emily turned away, and resumed
the train of thought which her schoolfellow had interrupted.
<P>
<P>
<P>
By an association of ideas, of which she was not herself aware,
she now passed from thinking of her aunt to thinking of Miss
Jethro. The interview of the previous night had dwelt on her mind
at intervals, in the hours of the new day.
<P>
Acting on instinct rather than on reason, she had kept that
remarkable incident in her school life a secret from every one.
No discoveries had been made by other persons. In speaking to her
staff of teachers, Miss Ladd had alluded to the affair in the
most cautious terms. "Circumstances of a private nature have
obliged the lady to retire from my school. When we meet after the
holidays, another teacher will be in her place." There, Miss
Ladd's explanation had begun and ended. Inquiries addressed to
the servants had led to no result. Miss Jethro's luggage was to
be forwarded to the London terminus of the railway--and Miss
Jethro herself had baffled investigation by leaving the school on
foot. Emily's interest in the lost teacher was not the transitory
interest of curiosity; her father's mysterious friend was a
person whom she honestly desired to see again. Perplexed by the
difficulty of finding a means of tracing Miss Jethro, she reached
the shady limit of the trees, and turned to walk back again.
Approaching the place at which she and Francine had met, an idea
occurred to her. It was just possible that Miss Jethro might not
be unknown to her aunt.
<P>
Still meditating on the cold reception that she had encountered,
and still feeling the influence which mastered her in spite of
herself, Francine interpreted Emily's return as an implied
expression of regret. She advanced with a constrained smile, and
spoke first.
<P>
"How are the young ladies getting on in the schoolroom?" she
asked, by way of renewing the conversation.
<P>
Emily's face assumed a look of surprise which said plainly, Can't
you take a hint and leave me to myself?
<P>
Francine was constitutionally impenetrable to reproof of this
sort; her thick skin was not even tickled. "Why are you not
helping them," she went on; "you who have the clearest head among
us and take the lead in everything?"
<P>
It may be a humiliating confession to make, yet it is surely true
that we are all accessible to flattery. Different tastes
appreciate different methods of burning incense--but the perfume
is more or less agreeable to all varieties of noses. Francine's
method had its tranquilizing effect on Emily. She answered
indulgently, "Miss de Sor, I have nothing to do with it."
<P>
"Nothing to do with it? No prizes to win before you leave
school?"
<P>
"I won all the prizes years ago."
<P>
"But there are recitations. Surely you recite?"
<P>
Harmless words in themselves, pursuing the same smooth course of
flattery as before--but with what a different result! Emily's
face reddened with anger the moment they were spoken. Having
already irritated Alban Morris, unlucky Francine, by a second
mischievous interposition of accident, had succeeded in making
Emily smart next. "Who has told you," she burst out; "I insist on
knowing!"
<P>
"Nobod y has told me anything!" Francine declared piteously.
<P>
"Nobody has told you how I have been insulted?"
<P>
"No, indeed! Oh, Miss Brown, who could insult _you?_"
<P>
In a man, the sense of injury does sometimes submit to the
discipline of silence. In a woman--never. Suddenly reminded of
her past wrongs (by the pardonable error of a polite
schoolfellow), Emily committed the startling inconsistency of
appealing to the sympathies of Francine!
<P>
"Would you believe it? I have been forbidden to recite--I, the
head girl of the school. Oh, not to-day! It happened a month
ago--when we were all in consultation, making our arrangements.
Miss Ladd asked me if I had decided on a piece to recite. I said,
'I have not only decided, I have learned the piece.' 'And what
may it be?' 'The dagger-scene in Macbeth.' There was a howl--I
can call it by no other name--a howl of indignation. A man's
soliloquy, and, worse still, a murdering man's soliloquy, recited
by one of Miss Ladd's young ladies, before an audience of parents
and guardians! That was the tone they took with me. I was as firm
as a rock. The dagger-scene or nothing. The result is--nothing!
An insult to Shakespeare, and an insult to Me. I felt it--I feel
it still. I was prepared for any sacrifice in the cause of the
drama. If Miss Ladd had met me in a proper spirit, do you know
what I would have done? I would have played Macbeth in costume.
Just hear me, and judge for yourself. I begin with a dreadful
vacancy in my eyes, and a hollow moaning in my voice: 'Is this a
dagger that I see before me--?'"
<P>
Reciting with her face toward the trees, Emily started, dropped
the character of Macbeth, and instantly became herself again:
herself, with a rising color and an angry brightening of the
eyes. "Excuse me, I can't trust my memory: I must get the play."
With that abrupt apology, she walked away rapidly in the
direction of the house.
<P>
In some surprise, Francine turned, and looked at the trees. She
discovered--in full retreat, on his side--the eccentric
drawing-master, Alban Morris.
<P>
Did he, too, admire the dagger-scene? And was he modestly
desirous of hearing it recited, without showing himself? In that
case, why should Emily (whose besetting weakness was certainly
not want of confidence in her own resources) leave the garden the
moment she caught sight of him? Francine consulted her instincts.
She had just arrived at a conclusion which expressed itself
outwardly by a malicious smile, when gentle Cecilia appeared on
the lawn--a lovable object in a broad straw hat and a white
dress, with a nosegay in her bosom--smiling, and fanning herself.
<P>
"It's so hot in the schoolroom," she said, "and some of the
girls, poor things, are so ill-tempered at rehearsal--I have made
my escape. I hope you got your breakfast, Miss de Sor. What have
you been doing here, all by yourself?"
<P>
"I have been making an interesting discovery," Francine replied.
<P>
"An interesting discovery in our garden? What _can_ it be?"
<P>
"The drawing-master, my dear, is in love with Emily. Perhaps she
doesn't care about him. Or, perhaps, I have been an innocent
obstacle in the way of an appointment between them."
<P>
Cecilia had breakfasted to her heart's content on her favorite
dish--buttered eggs. She was in such good spirits that she was
inclined to be coquettish, even when there was no man present to
fascinate. "We are not allowed to talk about love in this
school," she said--and hid her face behind her fan. "Besides, if
it came to Miss Ladd's ears, poor Mr. Morris might lose his
situation."
<P>
"But isn't it true?" asked Francine.
<P>
"It may be true, my dear; but nobody knows. Emily hasn't breathed
a word about it to any of us. And Mr. Morris keeps his own
secret. Now and then we catch him looking at her--and we draw our
own conclusions."
<P>
"Did you meet Emily on your way here?"
<P>
"Yes, and she passed without speaking to me."
<P>
"Thinking perhaps of Mr. Morris."
<P>
Cecilia shook her head. "Thinking, Francine, of the new life
before her--and regretting, I am afraid, that she ever confided
her hopes and wishes to me. Did she tell you last night what her
prospects are when she leaves school?"
<P>
"She told me you had been very kind in helping her. I daresay I
should have heard more, if I had not fallen asleep. What is she
going to do?"
<P>
"To live in a dull house, far away in the north," Cecilia
answered; "with only old people in it. She will have to write and
translate for a great scholar, who is studying mysterious
inscriptions--hieroglyphics, I think they are called--found among
the ruins of Central America. It's really no laughing matter,
Francine! Emily made a joke of it, too. 'I'll take anything but a
situation as a governess,' she said; 'the children who have Me to
teach them would be to be pitied indeed!' She begged and prayed
me to help her to get an honest living. What could I do? I could
only write home to papa. He is a member of Parliament: and
everybody who wants a place seems to think he is bound to find it
for them. As it happened, he had heard from an old friend of his
(a certain Sir Jervis Redwood), who was in search of a secretary.
Being in favor of letting the women compete for employment with
the men, Sir Jervis was willing to try, what he calls, 'a
female.' Isn't that a horrid way of speaking of us? and Miss Ladd
says it's ungrammatical, besides. Papa had written back to say he
knew of no lady whom he could recommend. When he got my letter
speaking of Emily, he kindly wrote again. In the interval, Sir
Jervis had received two applications for the vacant place. They
were both from old ladies--and he declined to employ them."
<P>
"Because they were old," Francine suggested maliciously.
<P>
"You shall hear him give his own reasons, my dear. Papa sent me
an extract from his letter. It made me rather angry; and (perhaps
for that reason) I think I can repeat it word for word:--'We are
four old people in this house, and we don't want a fifth. Let us
have a young one to cheer us. If your daughter's friend likes the
terms, and is not encumbered with a sweetheart, I will send for
her when the school breaks up at midsummer.' Coarse and
selfish--isn't it? However, Emily didn't agree with me, when I
showed her the extract. She accepted the place, very much to her
aunt's surprise and regret, when that excellent person heard of
it. Now that the time has come (though Emily won't acknowledge
it), I believe she secretly shrinks, poor dear, from the
prospect."
<P>
"Very likely," Francine agreed--without even a pretense of
sympathy. "But tell me, who are the four old people?"
<P>
"First, Sir Jervis himself--seventy, last birthday. Next, his
unmarried sister--nearly eighty. Next, his man-servant, Mr.
Rook--well past sixty. And last, his man-servant's wife, who
considers herself young, being only a little over forty. That is
the household. Mrs. Rook is coming to-day to attend Emily on the
journey to the North; and I am not at all sure that Emily will
like her."
<P>
"A disagreeable woman, I suppose?"
<P>
"No--not exactly that. Rather odd and flighty. The fact is, Mrs.
Rook has had her troubles; and perhaps they have a little
unsettled her. She and her husband used to keep the village inn,
close to our park: we know all about them at home. I am sure I
pity these poor people. What are you looking at, Francine?"
<P>
Feeling no sort of interest in Mr. and Mrs. Rook, Francine was
studying her schoolfellow's lovely face in search of defects. She
had already discovered that Cecilia's eyes were placed too widely
apart, and that her chin wanted size and character.
<P>
"I was admiring your complexion, dear," she answered coolly.
"Well, and why do you pity the Rooks?"
<P>
Simple Cecilia smiled, and went on with her story.
<P>
"They are obliged to go out to service in their old age, through
a misfortune for which they are in no way to blame. Their
customers deserted the inn, and Mr. Rook became bankrupt. The inn
got what they call a bad name--in a very dreadful way. There was
a murder committed in the house."
<P>
"A murder?" cried Francine. "Oh, this is exciting! You provoking
girl, why didn't you tell me about it before?"
<P>
"I didn't think of it," said Cecilia placidly.
<P>
"Do go on! Were you at home when it happened?"
<P>
"I w as here, at school."
<P>
"You saw the newspapers, I suppose?"
<P>
"Miss Ladd doesn't allow us to read newspapers. I did hear of it,
however, in letters from home. Not that there was much in the
letters. They said it was too horrible to be described. The poor
murdered gentleman--"
<P>
Francine was unaffectedly shocked. "A gentleman!" she exclaimed.
"How dreadful!"
<P>
"The poor man was a stranger in our part of the country," Cecilia
resumed; "and the police were puzzled about the motive for a
murder. His pocketbook was missing; but his watch and his rings
were found on the body. I remember the initials on his linen
because they were the same as my mother's initial before she was
married--'J. B.' Really, Francine, that's all I know about it."
<P>
"Surely you know whether the murderer was discovered?"
<P>
"Oh, yes--of course I know that! The government offered a reward;
and clever people were sent from London to help the county
police. Nothing came of it. The murderer has never been
discovered, from that time to this."
<P>
"When did it happen?"
<P>
"It happened in the autumn."
<P>
"The autumn of last year?"
<P>
"No! no! Nearly four years since."
