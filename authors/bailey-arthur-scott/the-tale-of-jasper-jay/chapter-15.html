<p>THE morning was not gone before Jasper Jay had four callers. There was
Bobbie Bobolink, Jolly Robin, Miss Kitty Catbird and Buddy
Brown-Thrasher.
</p>
<p>Jasper Jay was surprised to see them, because it was seldom that anybody
but his relations called on him. Of course, if one makes himself
disagreeable--as Jasper generally did--people do not go out of their way
to see him. But it was different with Jasper Jay's relations. Some of
them were just as unmannerly and ill-bred as he was. When they came to
see Jasper they were usually looking for a quarrel. And they always
found what they were looking for at the house of their cousin, Jasper
Jay.
</p><p>Naturally, he did not like to disappoint his own cousins. He had even
been known to quarrel with his great-grandfather--which is something
most people refuse flatly to do.
</p><p>"Are you hunting for trouble?" Jasper inquired, as he raised his crest
and snapped his bill together, looking as fierce as he could.
</p><p>Such conduct was enough to frighten any lady. And it was no wonder that
Jasper's actions--as well as his words--sent Miss Kitty Catbird into a
flutter of alarm. Her companions, however, told her there was no danger.
And Jolly Robin, who was a bold fellow, hopped forward to do the talking
for the callers.
</p><p>"We're a committee," said he, "chosen to call on you and invite you to
join the Pleasant Valley Singing Society."
</p><p>When he heard Jolly Robin's explanation, Jasper Jay laughed in his
callers' faces.
</p><p>"I'm not musical," he said. "And people who get up early in the morning
to sing before breakfast always amuse me. They're silly--that's what
they are!" he cried.
</p><p>"Well, the Society wants you, all the same," Jolly insisted.
</p><p>Jasper Jay said nothing for a few moments. He was thinking. And it
occurred to him, as he thought, that he could have a good deal of sport
by joining the Society and spoiling its concerts. So he said at last:
</p><p>"I'll become a member of your Society on one condition."
</p><p>"What's that?" Jolly Robin inquired.
</p><p>"You must let me sing all I want to."
</p><p>Jolly Robin looked at his companions. And seeing that they all nodded
their heads, he asked Jasper if he would promise to sing his best.
</p><p>Jasper Jay said promptly that he would. So Jolly told him that it was a
bargain. "You shall come to our next meeting and make all the music you
want to," he promised.
</p><p>So that was the way Jasper Jay became a member of the Pleasant Valley
Singing Society.
</p><p>"When's your next meeting?" Jasper asked.
</p><p>"To-night, just before sunset!" Jolly replied. "We'll gather in the
maple grove, near the sugar-house. And we'll look for you."
</p><p>"I'll be there without fail," Jasper Jay assured him.
</p><p>The committee left him then. And Jasper's unpleasant laughter rang in
their ears for a long time afterward.
</p><p>But when he stopped laughing, Jasper decided to keep very still for the
rest of the day. He wanted to save his voice for the concert at sunset.
