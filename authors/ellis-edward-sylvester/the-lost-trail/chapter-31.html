<p>When Deerfoot the Shawanoe encountered his enemy in the path
and turned over the rifle to him, he knew that his leniency toward
his implacable foe had not softened his heart in the least.  He
only awaited the opportunity to turn like a rattlesnake on his
magnanimous master, and the youth therefore took particular care
that such opportunity should not be given him.</p>

<p>Deerfoot held his tomahawk tightly grasped and poised, determined
to hurl it with resistless and unerring aim on the very first
move of the warrior against him.  He remained as rigid as bronze
until the other was a couple of rods distant.  Then he noiselessly
shoved back the tomahawk in his girdle, picked up his bow and
vanished like a shadow.  When the warrior turned, as the reader
will recall, he saw no one.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was confident that after such a meeting, the one whom
he had spared would not follow him.  He would be glad enough to
escape altogether without arousing the wrath of him who would
not show mercy a second time.  Nevertheless, the matchless youth
sped along the path in the gathering gloom, with that swiftness
which earned him his expressive name while he was yet a mere boy. 
No man, American or Caucasian, could hold his own against him
in his phenomenal fleetness.  He swept through the forest, never
pausing, but darting forward like a bird on the wing, that eludes
by the marvelous quickness of eye the labyrinth of limbs and obstructions
which interpose almost every second across his line of flight.</p>

<p>Not until he had sped fully a half mile did slacken in the slightest
his astonishing pace, and then there was not the least quickening
of the pulse or hastening of the gentle breath.  Had chose, he
could have maintained the same for hours without discomfort or
fatigue.</p>

<p>While, in one sense, Deerfoot was fleeing a Shawanoe, he was,
in the same sense, pursue another, in whom his chief interest
centered. The night deepened, and the moon, climbing above the
tree tops, penetrated the gloomy recesses in few places with its
silvery beams. When a mile had been passed, the young warrior
paused and listened.</p>

<p>"He cannot follow me when his eyes see no trail," he said to
himself, alluding to the Shawanoe whom he had spared.</p>

<p>It followed as a corollary that the same difficulty confronted
him in pursuing his friends and the enemy who clung so close to
their footprints.  He stopped and softly passed his hand over
the leafy ground.  Not the slightest artificial depression was
there; he had lost the trail of the party.</p>

<p>As it was utterly out of the question to learn how far he had
diverged from the path, it was also beyond his power to return
to it&mdash;that is, so long as the night lasted.  The hoof-prints
of the horse were cut so deep in the yielding earth that, with
considerable trouble, he could have traced them among the trees;
but even then he would lack the great help which the scout is
generally able to command.  In following a trail at night, he
needs to possess a thorough knowledge of the country, so as to
reason out the probable destination of his enemies, and consequently
the general route they will take.  More than likely they will
aim for some crossing or camping ground, many miles in advance. 
The knowledge of the hunter may enable him to take a shorter course
and, by putting his horse to his best, reach of them.  About all
he does, when engaged in this hot chase, is to take his observations
at widely separated points, with a view of learning he is going
astray.</p>

<p>It was precisely in this manner that the greatest scout of modern
days, Kit Carson, led a party on the heels of a party of Mexican
horse-thieves, with his steeds on a fall gallop the night thoroughly
overtook the criminals at daylight, chastised them and recaptured
the stolen property.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was lacking in that one requisite&mdash;familiarity with
the country.  He had journeyed up and down the shores of the Mississippi,
had visited the settlement further west, and had gain much knowledge
of the southwestern portion of the present State of Missouri;
but this member of our Union occupies an immense area, and years
would be needed to enable him to act as guide through every section
of it. He had never traveled in many parts, and it will be perceived,
therefore, that it was out of his power to theorize in the wonderfully
brilliant manner which often made his successes due to an intuitive
inspiration that at times seemed to hover on the verge of the
unknowable sixth sense.</p>

<p>But strange must be the occasion in which Deerfoot would feel
compelled to fold his, arms and say, "I can do no more."</p>

<p>He had stood less than three minutes in the attitude of deep
attention, when he emitted a peculiar fluttering whistle, such
as a timid night bird sometimes makes from its perch in the up
most branches, while calling to its mate.  It was still trembling
on the air, when a response came from a point not far away and
to the right.  Could any one have seen the face of the youthful
Shawanoe, he would have observed a faint but grim smile playing
around his mouth.</p>

<p>He had uttered the signal which the Shawanoes rarely used.  When
members of their scouts became temporarily lost from each other,
while in the immediate neighborhood of an enemy, and it was necessary
they should locate themselves, they did so by means of the signal
described.  They refrained from appealing to it except in cases
of the utmost urgency, for if used too often it was likely to
become known to their enemies and its usefulness thus destroyed.</p>

<p>Deerfoot had secured a reply from the Shawanoe for whom he was
hunting, and thus learned his precise whereabouts.  He instantly
began stealing his way toward him.</p>

<p>The usage among this remarkable tribe of Indians required him
to repeat the peculiar cry after hearing it, and the party of
the second should respond similarly.  When the call had been wafted
back and forth in this fashion, Shawanoe law forbade its repetition,
except after a considerable interval, and then only under the
most urgent necessity.</p>

<p>Deerfoot held his peace, though he knew warrior was awaiting
his answer.  Failing to call the response, the other would conclude
that the signal was in truth the call of a bird; but to guard
against any error, he repeated the tremulous whistle, when the
stealthy Deerfoot was within a few rods.</p>

<p>The latter could have taken his life with suddenness almost of
the lightning bolt, but he had no wish to do so.  If Jack Carleton
and Otto Relstaub were in danger it would be from this warrior
alone, and so long as Deerfoot could keep him "in hand" no such
danger existed.</p>

<p>In the open forest, where the moonlight penetrated, a shadowy
figure assumed shape, and the pursuer recognized it as that of
the Indian whom he was so anxious to find.  He had concluded to
wait no longer, and was advancing in a blind way along the trail
of the lads.</p>

<p>Deerfoot stooped and passed his hand over the ground.  One sweep
was enough to, identify the prints of the horse's hoofs, and the
more delicate impressions made by shoes and moccasins.  The young
Shawanoe, by a careful examination of the trail, did that which
will scarcely be believed: he ascertained that one pair of moccasins
went forward and the other took the opposite course.  Consequently,
the Shawanoes had parted company at a point slightly in advance
(it could not be far), and the warrior whom he saw must have waited
where he was while the night was closing in.</p>

<p>A few rods further and a second examination revealed the trail
of a single pair of moccasins, the line of demarcation had been
passed.</p>

<p>All this time the elder was pushing among trees, Deerfoot catching
a glimpse of him now and then, so as to be able to regulate his
own pace that of his enemy.  It was needful also that much circumspection
should be used, for when one person can trace the movements of
another, it follows that the possibilities are reciprocal and
the law vice versa obtains.  The youth therefore held resolutely
back, and so guarded his movements that he was assured against
detection by any glance the warrior might cast behind him.</p>

<p>The trees in front diminished in number and soon ceased altogether.
The Shawanoe had reached the edge of a natural opening or clearing.
Pausing a moment, he stepped out where the moon shone full upon
him, and then halted again.  Having the advantage of cover, Deerfoot
slipped carefully forward, until he stood within a few yards of
the red man, who little dreamed of the dreaded one that was within
the throw of a tomahawk.</p>

<p>The elder Indian seemed to be speculating the probable course
of the unconscious fugitives.  It could not be supposed that he
was familiar with the country (since his home was on the other
side of the Mississippi), but like the majority of mankind when
in difficulty, he was able to form a theory, but unlike that majority,
he proved his faith in it by his works.  Instead of following
the footprints, he diverged to the right and coursed along the
edge of the clearing, where he was almost entirely concealed by
the shadow of the trees.</p>

<p>He had not gone far, when Deerfoot silently emerged from the
wood. His keen eye revealed what must have been noticed by the
other: on that spot the boys had stopped with the intention of
encamping for the night.  Had they remained, beyond all doubt
one or both would have been slain, but from some cause (long since
explained to the reader) they passed on.</p>

<p>Deerfoot hurried on with a speed that was almost reckless, for
that marvelous intuition seemed to whisper that the crisis was
near.  His friends could not be far off, and the question of safety
or danger must be speedily settled.</p>

<p>Just beyond the clearing, while hastening forward, he caught,
the glow of the fire shining through the rents and crevices of
the shabby skin of the Osage wigwam.  He heard the of voices within,
and a few seconds later he was peeping through the same orifice
that had a similar purpose for jack Carleton when played the part
of eavesdropper.</p>
