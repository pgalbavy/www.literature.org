<p>"Wall, that ere little matter was settled without any hard words,"
muttered the scout, as he rode up the ravine. "It ain't the way
Lone Wolf generally manages them things, but that affair me and
him had, when I took my hoss away from him, I s'pose had something
to do with it."</p>

<p>The scout had considerable cause to feel grateful and pleased
over the turn of events. He had his horse and gun, and it now
only remained for him to rejoin his companions. He had already
passed the point where Mickey O'Rooney had left the ravine, and
he felt the impropriety of turning back and presuming upon any
further indulgence of the Apaches.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he slackened the speed of his mustang until he reached
an avenue of escape. He was forced to go quite a distance before
finding one, but he did, at last, and turned his horse into it.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether that ar Irishman can find the way back
to whar we left the younker, but I suppose he'll try, so I'll
aim at the same p'int."</p>

<p>The night was pretty well gone, and his mustang had struggled
nobly until he showed signs of weariness, and the scout concluded
to wait until daylight before pushing his hunt any further. They
were miles away from the Apache camp, and he had no fears of disturbance
from that quarter. So he drew rein in a secluded spot, and sprang
to the ground.</p>

<p>At the very moment of doing so, his horse gave a whinny, which
was instantly responded to by a whinny from another horse, less
than a hundred feet away.</p>

<p>"That's qua'ar," muttered the scout, as he grasped his rifle.
"Whar thar's a hoss in these parts, thar's generally a man, and
whar thar's a man, you kin set him down as an Injun. And as this
can't be Lone Wolf, I'll find out who he is."</p>

<p>His own mustang being a strayer, he managed to tie him to a small,
scrubby bush, after which he moved forward, with caution and stealth,
in the direction whence came the whinny that had arrested his
attention. His purpose was to prevent the other animal discovering
his approach&mdash;an exceedingly difficult task, as the mustangs of
the Southwest are among the very best sentinels that are known,
frequently detecting the approach of danger when their masters
fail to do so. However, Sut succeeded in getting so close, that
he could plainly detect the outlines of the animal, which was
standing motionless, with head erect, and his nose turned in the
direction of the other mustang, as though he were all attention,
and on the look-out for danger.</p>

<p>The scout paused to study the matter, for he did not understand
the precise situation of things. The mustang which he saw might
be only one of a dozen others, whose owners were near at hand,
with possible several searching for him. The conclusion was inevitable
that it was necessary for him to reconnoitre a little further
before allowing his own position to be uncovered.</p>

<p>Before he could advance any further, he caught sight of a man,
who moved silently forward between him and the horse, where he
could be seen with greater distinctness. He held his rifle in
hand, and seemed disturbed at the action of his horse, which was
clearly an admonition for him to be on his guard.</p>

<p>The scout studied him for a minute, and then cautiously raised
the hammer of his rifle. Guarded as was the movement, the faint
click caught the ear of the other, who started, and was on the
point of leaping back, when Sut called out:</p>

<p>"Stop, or I'll bore a hole through yer!"</p>

<p>The figure did not move.</p>

<p>"Come forward and surrender."</p>

<p>The form remained like a statue.</p>

<p>"Throw down that gun or I'll shoot."</p>

<p>This brought a response, which came in the shape of a well-known
voice:</p>

<p>"Not while I have the spirit of a man left, as me uncle obsarved
when his wife commanded him to come down from a tree that she
might pummel him. How are ye, old boy?"</p>

<p>The scout had suspected the identity of his friend from the first,
and had made the attempt to frighten him from the innate love
of the thing. The two grasped hands cordially and were rejoiced
beyond measure at this fortunate meeting.</p>

<p>Mickey explained that he had not been scratched by a bullet,
nor had his horse suffered injury. It was a most singular escape
indeed. But no more singular than that of the scout himself, who
had received mercy at the hands of Lone Wolf, who had never been
known to be guilty of such a weakness. It had been a providential
deliverance all around, and the men could not be otherwise than
in the best sprits.</p>

<p>"The next thing is to hunt up the younker," said the scout, as
they sat upon the the ground discussing incidents of the past
few days. "I'm a little troubled about him, 'cause we've been
away longer than we expected, and some of the varmints may have
got on his trail."</p>

<p>"How far from this place do ye reckon him to be?"</p>

<p>"That's powerful hard to tell, but it can't be much less than
a mile, and that's a good ways in such a hilly country as this.
Yer can't git over it faster than yer kin run."</p>

<p>"But ye know the way thar, as I understand ye to remark?"</p>

<p>The scout signified that he would have no more trouble in reaching
it then in making his way across a room. They decided, though,
that the best thing they could do was to wait where they were
until daylight, and then take up the hunt. They remained talking
and smoking for an hour or two longer, neither closing their eyes
in slumber, although the occasion was improved to its utmost by
their animals. The scout was capable of losing a couple of nights'
rest without being materially effected thereby, while Mickey's
experience almost enabled him to do the same.</p>

<p>As soon as it was fairly light the two were on the move, Sut
leading the course in the direction of the spot where they had
left Fred Munson the day before, and which he had vacated very
suddenly. They were picking their way along as best they could,
when they struck a small stream, when the scout paused so suddenly
that his comrade inquired the cause.</p>

<p>"That's quar, powerful quar," he said looking down at the ground
and speaking as if to himself.</p>

<p>"One horse has been 'long har, and I think it war mine, and that
he had that younker on his back."</p>

<p>"Which way was the young spalpeen traveling?"</p>

<p>The scout indicated the course, and then added, in an excited
undertone:</p>

<p>"It looks to me as if he got scared out and had to leave, and
it ain't no ways likely that anything would have scared him short
of Injuns&mdash;so it's time we j'ined him."</p>

<p>The Irishman was decidedly of the same opinion, and the trail
was at once taken.</p>

<p>"Be the powers! do you mind that?" demanded Mickey, in an excited
voice.</p>

<p>"Mind what?" asked the scout, somewhat startled at his manner.</p>

<p>"Jes' look yonder, will ye?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he pointed up the slope ahead of them. There, but
a comparatively short distance away, was Fred Munson, in plain
sight, seated upon the back of his mustang, apparently scrutinizing
the two horsemen, as if in doubt as to their identity. The parties
recognized each other at the same moment, and Fred waved his hat,
which salutation was returned by his friends. The scout motioned
to him to ride down to where he and Mickey were waiting.</p>

<p>"He's off the trail altogether, and if he keeps on that course,
he'll fetch up in New Orleans, or Galveston," he added, by way
of explanation.</p>

<p>The lad lost no time in rejoining them, and the trio formed a
joyous party. Not one was injured, each had a good swift horse,
and a weapon of some kind, and was far better equipped for a homeward
journey than they had dared to hope.</p>

<p>"Thar's only one thing to make a slight delay," said the Irishman,
after pretty much everything had been explained.</p>

<p>His friends looked to him for an explanation.</p>

<p>"I resaved notice from me family physician in London this mornin',
that it was dangerous when in this part of the world to travel
on an empty stomach."</p>

<p>All three felt the need of food and Sut considered the spot where
they were as good for camping purposes as any they were likely
to find. So they dismounted, and while Mickey and Fred busied
themselves in gathering wood, and preparing the fire, the scout
went off in search of game.</p>

<p>"Do ye mind," called out Mickey, "that ye mustn't return till
ye bring something wid ye? I'm so hungry that I'm not particular.
A biled Apache will answer, if ye can't find anything else."</p>

<p>"If he gets anything," said Fred, "we must make away with all
we can, and try to eat enough to last us two or three days."</p>

<p>"That's what I always do at each meal," promptly replied his
friend. "Thar's nothing like being prepared for emergencies, as
me cousin, Butt O'Norghoghon, remarked when he presented the gal
he was coortin' with a set of teeth and a whig, which she didn't
naad any more than does me hoss out thar."</p>

<p>The scout returned before he was expected, and with a superabundance
of food, which was cooked and fully enjoyed, and as speedily as
possible they were mounted and on the road again. The traveling
was exceedingly difficult, and although they struck the main pass
near noon, and put their horses to their best speed, yet it was
dark when they succeeded in clearing themselves of the mountains
and reached the edge of the prairies, which stretched away almost
unbrokenly for hundreds of miles. They saw Indians several times
but did not exchange shots during the day. It was not a general
rule with Sut Simpson to avoid an encounter with redskins, but
he did it on the present occasion on account of his companions,
and especially for the lad's sake. A safe place for the encampment
was selected, the mustangs so placed that they would be certain
to detect the approach of any enemies during the night, and all
laid down to slumber.</p>

<p>Providence, that had so kindly watched over them through all
their perils, did not forget them when they lay stretched helpless
upon the ground.</p>

<p>The night passed away without molestation, and, making a breakfast
from the cooked meat that they had preserved, they struck out
upon the prairie in the direction of New Boston.</p>

<p>They had scarcely started, when a party of Indians, probably
Comanches, saw them and gave chase. The pursuers were well mounted,
and, for a time, the danger was critical, as they numbered fully
twenty; but the mustangs of the fugitives were also fleet of foot,
and, at last, they carried them beyond all danger from that source.</p>

<p>As the friends galloped along at an easy pace, Sut Simpson struck
them with horror by telling them the story of the massacre, which
he had heard discussed among the Apaches when he was a prisoner.
All were anxious to learn the extent of the horrible tale, and
they pressed their steeds to the utmost.</p>

<p>The site of the town was reached late in the afternoon, when
it was speedily seen that the young chief had told the truth.
New Boston was among the things of the past, having actually died
while in the struggles of birth. The unfinished houses had been
burned to the ground, the stock run off, and most of the inhabitants
massacred. The fight had been a desperate one, but when Lone Wolf
sent his warriors a second time they were resistless, and carried
everything before them.</p>

<p>"If any of 'em got away, they've reached Fort Severn," said the
scout, who was impressed by the evidences of the terrible scenes
that had been enacted here, within a comparatively few hours;
"but I don't think thar's much chance."</p>

<p>The remains of those who had fallen on the spot were so mutilated,
and in many cases partly burned, that they could not be recognized.
Among the wreck and ruin of matter were discovered a number of
shovels. The three set themselves to dig a trench, into which
all these remains were placed and carefully covered over with
earth.</p>

<p>"We'll take a shovel along," said Sut, as he threw one over his
shoulder, and sprang upon his horse. "We'll be likely to find
need for it afore we reach the fort."</p>

<p>This prediction was verified. As they rode along they constantly
came upon bodies of men and women, whose horses had given out,
or who had been shot while fleeing for life. In every case the
poor fugitives had been scalped and mutilated. They were gathered
up and tenderly buried, with no headstone to mark their remains,
there to sleep until the last trump shall sound.</p>

<p>Fort Severn was reached in the afternoon of the second day. There
were found, just six men and two women, the fleetness of whose
steeds had enabled them to win in the race for life. All the others
had fallen, among them Caleb Barnwell, the leader of the Quixotic
scheme, and the founder of the town which died with him. The valley
of the Rio Pecos was not prepared for any settlement unless one
organized upon a scale calculated to overawe all combinations
of the Apaches, Commanches, and Kiowas.</p>

<p>From Fort Severn, Mickey O'Rooney and Fred Munson, under the
escort, or rather guidance, of Sut Simpson, made their way overland
to Fort Aubray, where Mr. Munson, the father of Fred, was found.
The latter thanked heaven for the sickness which had detained
him and could not fully express his gratitude for the wonderful
preservation of Mickey and his son. Sut Simpson, the scout, was
well paid for his services, and, bidding them good-bye, he went
to his field of duty in the southwest, while Mr. Munson, Mickey
and Fred were glad enough to return east.</p>
