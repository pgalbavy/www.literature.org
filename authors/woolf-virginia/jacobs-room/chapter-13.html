<p>"The Height of the season," said Bonamy.</p>

<p>The sun had already blistered the paint on the backs of the green
chairs in Hyde Park; peeled the bark off the plane trees; and
turned the earth to powder and to smooth yellow pebbles. Hyde
Park was circled, incessantly, by turning wheels.</p>

<p>"The height of the season," said Bonamy sarcastically.</p>

<p>He was sarcastic because of Clara Durrant; because Jacob had
come back from Greece very brown and lean, with his pockets full
of Greek notes, which he pulled out when the chair man came for
pence; because Jacob was silent.</p>

<p>"He has not said a word to show that he is glad to see me," thought
Bonamy bitterly.</p>

<p>The motor cars passed incessantly over the bridge of the Serpentine;
the upper classes walked upright, or bent themselves gracefully
over the palings; the lower classes lay with their knees cocked
up, flat on their backs; the sheep grazed on pointed wooden legs;
small children ran down the sloping grass, stretched their arms,
and fell.</p>

<p>"Very urbane," Jacob brought out.</p>

<p>"Urbane" on the lips of Jacob had mysteriously all the shapeliness
of a character which Bonamy thought daily more sublime, devastating,
terrific than ever, though he was still, and perhaps would be
for ever, barbaric, obscure.</p>

<p>What superlatives! What adjectives! How acquit Bonamy of sentimentality
of the grossest sort; of being tossed like a cork on the waves;
of having no steady insight into character; of being unsupported
by reason, and of drawing no comfort whatever from the works of
the classics?</p>

<p>"The height of civilization," said Jacob.</p>

<p>He was fond of using Latin words.</p>

<p>Magnanimity, virtue&mdash;such words when Jacob used them in talk
with Bonamy meant that he took control of the situation; that
Bonamy would play round him like an affectionate spaniel; and
that (as likely as not) they would end by rolling on the floor.</p>

<p>"And Greece?" said Bonamy. "The Parthenon and all that?"</p>

<p>"There's none of this European mysticism," said Jacob.</p>

<p>"It's the atmosphere. I suppose," said Bonamy. "And you went
to Constantinople?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jacob.</p>

<p>Bonamy paused, moved a pebble; then darted in with the rapidity
and certainty of a lizard's tongue.</p>

<p>"You are in love!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Jacob blushed.</p>

<p>The sharpest of knives never cut so deep.</p>

<p>As for responding, or taking the least account of it, Jacob stared
straight ahead of him, fixed, monolithic&mdash;oh, very beautiful!&mdash;like
a British Admiral, exclaimed Bonamy in a rage, rising from his
seat and walking off; waiting for some sound; none came; too proud
to look back; walking quicker and quicker until he found himself
gazing into motor cars and cursing women. Where was the pretty
woman's face? Clara's&mdash;Fanny's &mdash;Florinda's? Who was the
pretty little creature?</p>

<p>Not Clara Durrant.</p>

<p>The Aberdeen terrier must be exercised, and as Mr. Bowley was
going that very moment&mdash;would like nothing better than a walk&mdash;they
went together, Clara and kind little Bowley &mdash;Bowley who
had rooms in the Albany, Bowley who wrote letters to the "Times"
in a jocular vein about foreign hotels and the Aurora Borealis
&mdash;Bowley who liked young people and walked down Piccadilly
with his right arm resting on the boss of his back.</p>

<p>"Little demon!" cried Clara, and attached Troy to his chain.</p>

<p>Bowley anticipated&mdash;hoped for&mdash;a confidence. Devoted to her mother,
Clara sometimes felt her a little, well, her mother was so sure
of herself that she could not understand other people being&mdash;being&mdash;"as
ludicrous as I am," Clara jerked out (the dog tugging her forwards).
And Bowley thought she looked like a huntress and turned over
in his mind which it should be&mdash;some pale virgin with a slip of
the moon in her hair, which was a flight for Bowley.</p>

<p>The colour was in her cheeks. To have spoken outright about her
mother&mdash;still, it was only to Mr. Bowley, who loved her, as everybody
must; but to speak was unnatural to her, yet it was awful to feel,
as she had done all day, that she <em>MUST </em>tell some one.</p>

<p>"Wait till we cross the road," she said to the dog, bending down.</p>

<p>Happily she had recovered by that time.</p>

<p>"She thinks so much about England," she said. "She is so anxious&#11834;"</p>

<p>Bowley was defrauded as usual. Clara never confided in any one.</p>

<p>"Why don't the young people settle it, eh?" he wanted to ask.
"What's all this about England?"&mdash;a question poor Clara could
not have answered, since, as Mrs. Durrant discussed with Sir Edgar
the policy of Sir Edward Grey, Clara only wondered why the cabinet
looked dusty, and Jacob had never come. Oh, here was Mrs. Cowley
Johnson...</p>

<p>And Clara would hand the pretty china teacups, and smile at the
compliment&mdash;that no one in London made tea so well as she did.</p>

<p>"We get it at Brocklebank's," she said, "in Cursitor Street."</p>

<p>Ought she not to be grateful? Ought she not to be happy?</p>

<p>Especially since her mother looked so well and enjoyed so much
talking to Sir Edgar about Morocco, Venezuela, or some such place.</p>

<p>"Jacob! Jacob!" thought Clara; and kind Mr. Bowley, who was ever
so good with old ladies, looked; stopped; wondered whether Elizabeth
wasn't too harsh with her daughter; wondered about Bonamy, Jacob&mdash;which
young fellow was it?&mdash;and jumped up directly Clara said she must
exercise Troy.</p>

<p>They had reached the site of the old Exhibition. They looked
at the tulips. Stiff and curled, the little rods of waxy smoothness
rose from the earth, nourished yet contained, suffused with scarlet
and coral pink. Each had its shadow; each grew trimly in the diamond-shaped
wedge as the gardener had planned it.</p>

<p>"Barnes never gets them to grow like that," Clara mused; she
sighed.</p>

<p>"You are neglecting your friends," said Bowley, as some one,
going the other way, lifted his hat. She started; acknowledged
Mr. Lionel Parry's bow; wasted on him what had sprung for Jacob.</p>

<p>("Jacob! Jacob!" she thought.)</p>

<p>"But you'll get run over if I let you go," she said to the dog.</p>

<p>"England seems all right," said Mr. Bowley.</p>

<p>The loop of the railing beneath the statue of Achilles was full
of parasols and waistcoats; chains and bangles; of ladies and
gentlemen, lounging elegantly, lightly observant.</p>

<p>"'This statue was erected by the women of England...'" Clara
read out with a foolish little laugh. "Oh, Mr. Bowley! Oh!" Gallop&mdash;gallop&mdash;gallop&mdash;a
horse galloped past without a rider. The stirrups swung; the pebbles
spurted.</p>

<p>"Oh, stop! Stop it, Mr. Bowley!" she cried, white, trembling,
gripping his arm, utterly unconscious, the tears coming.</p>

<p>"Tut-tut!" said Mr. Bowley in his dressing-room an hour later.
"Tut-tut!"&mdash;a comment that was profound enough, though inarticulately
expressed, since his valet was handing his shirt studs.</p>

<p>Julia Eliot, too, had seen the horse run away, and had risen
from her seat to watch the end of the incident, which, since she
came of a sporting family, seemed to her slightly ridiculous.
Sure enough the little man came pounding behind with his breeches
dusty; looked thoroughly annoyed; and was being helped to mount
by a policeman when Julia Eliot, with a sardonic smile, turned
towards the Marble Arch on her errand of mercy. It was only to
visit a sick old lady who had known her mother and perhaps the
Duke of Wellington; for Julia shared the love of her sex for the
distressed; liked to visit death-beds; threw slippers at weddings;
received confidences by the dozen; knew more pedigrees than a
scholar knows dates, and was one of the kindliest, most generous,
least continent of women.</p>

<p>Yet five minutes after she had passed the statue of Achilles
she had the rapt look of one brushing through crowds on a summer's
afternoon, when the trees are rustling, the wheels churning yellow,
and the tumult of the present seems like an elegy for past youth
and past summers, and there rose in her mind a curious sadness,
as if time and eternity showed through skirts and waistcoasts,
and she saw people passing tragically to destruction. Yet, Heaven
knows, Julia was no fool. A sharper woman at a bargain did not
exist. She was always punctual. The watch on her wrist gave her
twelve minutes and a half in which to reach Bruton Street. Lady
Congreve expected her at five.</p>

<p>The gilt clock at Verrey's was striking five.</p>

<p>Florinda looked at it with a dull expression, like an animal.
She looked at the clock; looked at the door; looked at the long
glass opposite; disposed her cloak; drew closer to the table,
for she was pregnant&mdash;no doubt about it, Mother Stuart said, recommending
remedies, consulting friends; sunk, caught by the heel, as she
tripped so lightly over the surface.</p>

<p>Her tumbler of pinkish sweet stuff was set down by the waiter;
and she sucked, through a straw, her eyes on the looking-glass,
on the door, now soothed by the sweet taste. When Nick Bramham
came in it was plain, even to the young Swiss waiter, that there
was a bargain between them. Nick hitched his clothes together
clumsily; ran his fingers through his hair; sat down, to an ordeal,
nervously. She looked at him; and set off laughing; laughed&mdash;laughed&mdash;laughed.
The young Swiss waiter, standing with crossed legs by the pillar,
laughed too.</p>

<p>The door opened; in came the roar of Regent Street, the roar
of traffic, impersonal, unpitying; and sunshine grained with dirt.
The Swiss waiter must see to the newcomers. Bramham lifted his
glass.</p>

<p>"He's like Jacob," said Florinda, looking at the newcomer.</p>

<p>"The way he stares." She stopped laughing.</p>

<p>Jacob, leaning forward, drew a plan of the Parthenon in the dust
in Hyde Park, a network of strokes at least, which may have been
the Parthenon, or again a mathematical diagram. And why was the
pebble so emphatically ground in at the corner? It was not to
count his notes that he took out a wad of papers and read a long
flowing letter which Sandra had written two days ago at Milton
Dower House with his book before her and in her mind the memory
of something said or attempted, some moment in the dark on the
road to the Acropolis which (such was her creed) mattered for
ever.</p>

<p>"He is," she mused, "like that man in Moliere."</p>

<p>She meant Alceste. She meant that he was severe. She meant that
she could deceive him.</p>

<p>"Or could I not?" she thought, putting the poems of Donne back
in the bookcase. "Jacob," she went on, going to the window and
looking over the spotted flower-beds across the grass where the
piebald cows grazed under beech trees, "Jacob would be shocked."</p>

<p>The perambulator was going through the little gate in the railing.
She kissed her hand; directed by the nurse, Jimmy waved his.</p>

<p>"HE'S a small boy," she said, thinking of Jacob.</p>

<p>And yet &mdash;Alceste?</p>

<p>"What a nuisance you are!" Jacob grumbled, stretching out first
one leg and then the other and feeling in each trouser-pocket
for his chair ticket.</p>

<p>"I expect the sheep have eaten it," he said. "Why do you keep
sheep?"</p>

<p>"Sorry to disturb you, sir," said the ticket-collector, his hand
deep in the enormous pouch of pence.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope they pay you for it," said Jacob. "There you are.
No. You can stick to it. Go and get drunk."</p>

<p>He had parted with half-a-crown, tolerantly, compassionately,
with considerable contempt for his species.</p>

<p>Even now poor Fanny Elmer was dealing, as she walked along the
Strand, in her incompetent way with this very careless, indifferent,
sublime manner he had of talking to railway guards or porters;
or Mrs. Whitehorn, when she consulted him about her little boy
who was beaten by the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>Sustained entirely upon picture post cards for the past two months,
Fanny's idea of Jacob was more statuesque, noble, and eyeless
than ever. To reinforce her vision she had taken to visiting the
British Museum, where, keeping her eyes downcast until she was
alongside of the battered Ulysses, she opened them and got a fresh
shock of Jacob's presence, enough to last her half a day. But
this was wearing thin. And she wrote now&mdash;poems, letters that
were never posted, saw his face in advertisements on hoardings,
and would cross the road to let the barrel-organ turn her musings
to rhapsody. But at breakfast (she shared rooms with a teacher),
when the butter was smeared about the plate, and the prongs of
the forks were clotted with old egg yolk, she revised these visions
violently; was, in truth, very cross; was losing her complexion,
as Margery Jackson told her, bringing the whole thing down (as
she laced her stout boots) to a level of mother-wit, vulgarity,
and sentiment, for she had loved too; and been a fool.</p>

<p>"One's godmothers ought to have told one," said Fanny, looking
in at the window of Bacon, the mapseller, in the Strand&mdash;told
one that it is no use making a fuss; this is life, they should
have said, as Fanny said it now, looking at the large yellow globe
marked with steamship lines.</p>

<p>"This is life. This is life," said Fanny.</p>

<p>"A very hard face," thought Miss Barrett, on the other side of
the glass, buying maps of the Syrian desert and waiting impatiently
to be served. "Girls look old so soon nowadays."</p>

<p>The equator swam behind tears.</p>

<p>"Piccadilly?" Fanny asked the conductor of the omnibus, and climbed
to the top. After all, he would, he must, come back to her.</p>

<p>But Jacob might have been thinking of Rome; of architecture;
of jurisprudence; as he sat under the plane tree in Hyde Park.</p>

<p>The omnibus stopped outside Charing Cross; and behind it were
clogged omnibuses, vans, motor-cars, for a procession with banners
was passing down Whitehall, and elderly people were stiffly descending
from between the paws of the slippery lions, where they had been
testifying to their faith, singing lustily, raising their eyes
from their music to look into the sky, and still their eyes were
on the sky as they marched behind the gold letters of their creed.</p>

<p>The traffic stopped, and the sun, no longer sprayed out by the
breeze, became almost too hot. But the procession passed; the
banners glittered &mdash;far away down Whitehall; the traffic was released;
lurched on; spun to a smooth continuous uproar; swerving round
the curve of Cockspur Street; and sweeping past Government offices
and equestrian statues down Whitehall to the prickly spires, the
tethered grey fleet of masonry, and the large white clock of Westminster.</p>

<p>Five strokes Big Ben intoned; Nelson received the salute. The
wires of the Admiralty shivered with some far-away communication.
A voice kept remarking that Prime Ministers and Viceroys spoke
in the Reichstag; entered Lahore; said that the Emperor travelled;
in Milan they rioted; said there were rumours in Vienna; said
that the Ambassador at Constantinople had audience with the Sultan;
the fleet was at Gibraltar. The voice continued, imprinting on
the faces of the clerks in Whitehall (Timothy Durrant was one
of them) something of its own inexorable gravity, as they listened,
deciphered, wrote down. Papers accumulated, inscribed with the
utterances of Kaisers, the statistics of ricefields, the growling
of hundreds of work-people, plotting sedition in back streets,
or gathering in the Calcutta bazaars, or mustering their forces
in the uplands of Albania, where the hills are sand-coloured,
and bones lie unburied.</p>

<p>The voice spoke plainly in the square quiet room with heavy tables,
where one elderly man made notes on the margin of typewritten
sheets, his silver-topped umbrella leaning against the bookcase.</p>

<p>His head&mdash;bald, red-veined, hollow-looking&mdash;represented all the
heads in the building. His head, with the amiable pale eyes, carried
the burden of knowledge across the street; laid it before his
colleagues, who came equally burdened; and then the sixteen gentlemen,
lifting their pens or turning perhaps rather wearily in their
chairs, decreed that the course of history should shape itself
this way or that way, being manfully determined, as their faces
showed, to impose some coherency upon Rajahs and Kaisers and the
muttering in bazaars, the secret gatherings, plainly visible in
Whitehall, of kilted peasants in Albanian uplands; to control
the course of events.</p>

<p>Pitt and Chatham, Burke and Gladstone looked from side to side
with fixed marble eyes and an air of immortal quiescence which
perhaps the living may have envied, the air being full of whistling
and concussions, as the procession with its banners passed down
Whitehall. Moreover, some were troubled with dyspepsia; one had
at that very moment cracked the glass of his spectacles; another
spoke in Glasgow to-morrow; altogether they looked too red, fat,
pale or lean, to be dealing, as the marble heads had dealt, with
the course of history.</p>

<p>Timmy Durrant in his little room in the Admiralty, going to consult
a Blue book, stopped for a moment by the window and observed the
placard tied round the lamp-post.</p>

<p>Miss Thomas, one of the typists, said to her friend that if the
Cabinet was going to sit much longer she should miss her boy outside
the Gaiety.</p>

<p>Timmy Durrant, returning with his Blue book under his arm, noticed
a little knot of people at the street corner; conglomerated as
though one of them knew something; and the others, pressing round
him, looked up, looked down, looked along the street. What was
it that he knew?</p>

<p>Timothy, placing the Blue book before him, studied a paper sent
round by the Treasury for information. Mr. Crawley, his fellow-clerk,
impaled a letter on a skewer.</p>

<p>Jacob rose from his chair in Hyde Park, tore his ticket to pieces,
and walked away.</p>

<p>"Such a sunset," wrote Mrs. Flanders in her letter to Archer
at Singapore. "One couldn't make up one's mind to come indoors,"
she wrote. "It seemed wicked to waste even a moment."</p>

<p>The long windows of Kensington Palace flushed fiery rose as Jacob
walked away; a flock of wild duck flew over the Serpentine; and
the trees were stood against the sky, blackly, magnificently.</p>

<p>"Jacob," wrote Mrs. Flanders, with the red light on her page,
"is hard at work after his delightful journey..."</p>

<p>"The Kaiser," the far-away voice remarked in Whitehall, "received
me in audience."</p>

<p>"Now I know that face&mdash;" said the Reverend Andrew Floyd, coming
out of Carter's shop in Piccadilly, "but who the dickens&mdash;?" and
he watched Jacob, turned round to look at him, but could not be
sure&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Jacob Flanders!" he remembered in a flash.</p>

<p>But he was so tall; so unconscious; such a fine young fellow.</p>

<p>"I gave him Byron's works," Andrew Floyd mused, and started forward,
as Jacob crossed the road; but hesitated, and let the moment pass,
and lost the opportunity.</p>

<p>Another procession, without banners, was blocking Long Acre.
Carriages, with dowagers in amethyst and gentlemen spotted with
carnations, intercepted cabs and motor-cars turned in the opposite
direction, in which jaded men in white waistcoats lolled, on their
way home to shrubberies and billiard-rooms in Putney and Wimbledon.</p>

<p>Two barrel-organs played by the kerb, and horses coming out of
Aldridge's with white labels on their buttocks straddled across
the road and were smartly jerked back.</p>

<p>Mrs. Durrant, sitting with Mr. Wortley in a motor-car, was impatient
lest they should miss the overture.</p>

<p>But Mr. Wortley, always urbane, always in time for the overture,
buttoned his gloves, and admired Miss Clara.</p>

<p>"A shame to spend such a night in the theatre!" said Mrs. Durrant,
seeing all the windows of the coachmakers in Long Acre ablaze.</p>

<p>"Think of your moors!" said Mr. Wortley to Clara.</p>

<p>"Ah! but Clara likes this better," Mrs. Durrant laughed.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;really," said Clara, looking at the blazing windows.
She started.</p>

<p>She saw Jacob.</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Mrs. Durrant sharply, leaning forward.</p>

<p>But she saw no one.</p>

<p>Under the arch of the Opera House large faces and lean ones,
the powdered and the hairy, all alike were red in the sunset;
and, quickened by the great hanging lamps with their repressed
primrose lights, by the tramp, and the scarlet, and the pompous
ceremony, some ladies looked for a moment into steaming bedrooms
near by, where women with loose hair leaned out of windows, where
girls&mdash;where children&mdash;(the long mirrors held the ladies suspended)
but one must follow; one must not block the way.</p>

<p>Clara's moors were fine enough. The Phoenicians slept under their
piled grey rocks; the chimneys of the old mines pointed starkly;
early moths blurred the heather-bells; cartwheels could be heard
grinding on the road far beneath; and the suck and sighing of
the waves sounded gently, persistently, for ever.</p>

<p>Shading her eyes with her hand Mrs. Pascoe stood in her cabbage-garden
looking out to sea. Two steamers and a sailing-ship crossed each
other; passed each other; and in the bay the gulls kept alighting
on a log, rising high, returning again to the log, while some
rode in upon the waves and stood on the rim of the water until
the moon blanched all to whiteness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pascoe had gone indoors long ago.</p>

<p>But the red light was on the columns of the Parthenon, and the
Greek women who were knitting their stockings and sometimes crying
to a child to come and have the insects picked from its head were
as jolly as sand-martins in the heat, quarrelling, scolding, suckling
their babies, until the ships in the Piraeus fired their guns.</p>

<p>The sound spread itself flat, and then went tunnelling its way
with fitful explosions among the channels of the islands.</p>

<p>Darkness drops like a knife over Greece.</p>

<p>"The guns?" said Betty Flanders, half asleep, getting out of
bed and going to the window, which was decorated with a fringe
of dark leaves.</p>

<p>"Not at this distance," she thought. "It is the sea."</p>

<p>Again, far away, she heard the dull sound, as if nocturnal women
were beating great carpets. There was Morty lost, and Seabrook
dead; her sons fighting for their country. But were the chickens
safe? Was that some one moving downstairs? Rebecca with the toothache?
No. The nocturnal women were beating great carpets. Her hens shifted
slightly on their perches.</p>
