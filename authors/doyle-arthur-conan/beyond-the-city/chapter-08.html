Mrs. Westmacott's great meeting for the
enfranchisement of woman had passed over, and it had been
a triumphant success.  All the maids and matrons of the
southern suburbs had rallied at her summons, there was an
influential platform with Dr. Balthazar Walker in the
chair, and Admiral Hay Denver among his more prominent
supporters.  One benighted male had come in from the
outside darkness and had jeered from the further end of
the hall, but he had been called to order by the chair,
petrified by indignant glances from the unenfranchised
around him, and finally escorted to the door by Charles
Westmacott.  Fiery resolutions were passed, to be
forwarded to a large number of leading statesmen, and the
meeting broke up with the conviction that a shrewd
blow had been struck for the cause of woman.
<P>
But there was one woman at least to whom the meeting
and all that was connected with it had brought anything
but pleasure.  Clara Walker watched with a heavy heart
the friendship and close intimacy which had sprung up
between her father and the widow.  From week to week it
had increased until no day ever passed without their
being together.  The coming meeting had been the excuse
for these continual interviews, but now the meeting was
over, and still the Doctor would refer every point which
rose to the judgment of his neighbor.  He would talk,
too, to his two daughters of her strength of character,
her decisive mind, and of the necessity of their
cultivating her acquaintance and following her example,
until at last it had become his most common topic of
conversation.
<P>
All this might have passed as merely the natural
pleasure which an elderly man might take in the society
of an intelligent and handsome woman, but there were
other points which seemed to Clara to give it a deeper
meaning.  She could not forget that when Charles
Westmacott had spoken to her one night he had alluded to
the possibility of his aunt marrying again.  He must have
known or noticed something before he would speak upon
such a subject.  And then again Mrs. Westmacott had
herself said that she hoped to change her style of
living shortly and take over completely new duties.  What
could that mean except that she expected to marry?  And
whom?  She seemed to see few friends outside their own
little circle.  She must have alluded to her father.  It
was a hateful thought, and yet it must be faced.
<P>
One evening the Doctor had been rather late at his
neighbor's.  He used to go into the Admiral's after
dinner, but now he turned more frequently in the other
direction.  When he returned Clara was sitting alone in
the drawing-room reading a magazine.  She sprang up as he
entered, pushed forward his chair, and ran to fetch his
slippers.
<P>
"You are looking a little pale, dear," he remarked.
<P>
"Oh, no, papa, I am very well."
<P>
"All well with Harold?"
<P>
"Yes.  His partner, Mr. Pearson, is still away, and
he is doing all the work."
<P>
"Well done.  He is sure to succeed.  Where is Ida?"
<P>
"In her room, I think."
<P>
"She was with Charles Westmacott on the lawn not very
long ago.  He seems very fond of her.  He is not very
bright, but I think he will make her a good husband."
<P>
"I am sure of it, papa.  He is very manly and
reliable."
<P>
"Yes, I should think that he is not the sort of man
who goes wrong.  There is nothing hidden about him.  As
to his brightness, it really does not matter, for his
aunt, Mrs. Westmacott, is very rich, much richer than you
would think from her style of living, and she has made
him a handsome provision."
<P>
"I am glad of that."
<P>
"It is between ourselves.  I am her trustee, and so
I know something of her arrangements.  And when are you
going to marry, Clara?"
<P>
"Oh, papa, not for some time yet.  We have not
thought of a date.
<P>
"Well, really, I don't know that there is any reason
for delay.  He has a competence and it increases yearly. 
As long as you are quite certain that your mind is made
up----"
<P>
"Oh, papa!"
<P>
"Well, then, I really do not know why there should be
any delay.  And Ida, too, must be married within the next
few months.  Now, what I want to know is what I am to do
when my two little companions run away from me."  He
spoke lightly, but his eyes were grave as he looked
questioningly at his daughter.
<P>
"Dear papa, you shall not be alone.  It will be years
before Harold and I think of marrying, and when we do you
must come and live with us."
<P>
"No, no, dear.  I know that you mean what you
say, but I have seen something of the world, and I know
that such arrangements never answer.  There cannot be two
masters in a house, and yet at my age my freedom is very
necessary to me."
<P>
"But you would be completely free."
<P>
"No, dear, you cannot be that if you are a guest in
another man's house.  Can you suggest no other
alternative?"
<P>
"That we remain with you."
<P>
"No, no.  That is out of the question.  Mrs.
Westmacott herself says that a woman's first duty is to
marry.  Marriage, however, should be an equal
partnership, as she points out.  I should wish you both
to marry, but still I should like a suggestion from you,
Clara, as to what I should do."
<P>
"But there is no hurry, papa.  Let us wait.  I do not
intend to marry yet."
<P>
Doctor Walker looked disappointed.  "Well, Clara, if
you can suggest nothing, I suppose that I must take the
initiative myself," said he.
<P>
"Then what do you propose, papa?"  She braced herself
as one who sees the blow which is about to fall.
<P>
He looked at her and hesitated.  "How like your poor
dear mother you are, Clara!" he cried.  "As I looked at
you then it was as if she had come back from the grave." 
He stooped towards her and kissed her.  "There, run
away to your sister, my dear, and do not trouble yourself
about me.  Nothing is settled yet, but you will find that
all will come right."
<P>
Clara went upstairs sad at heart, for she was sure
now that what she had feared was indeed about to come to
pass, and that her father was going to take Mrs.
Westmacott to be his wife.  In her pure and earnest mind
her mother's memory was enshrined as that of a saint, and
the thought that any one should take her place seemed a
terrible desecration.  Even worse, however, did this
marriage appear when looked at from the point of view of
her father's future.  The widow might fascinate him by
her knowledge of the world, her dash, her strength, her
unconventionality--all these qualities Clara was willing
to allow her--but she was convinced that she would be
unendurable as a life companion.  She had come to an age
when habits are not lightly to be changed, nor was she a
woman who was at all likely to attempt to change them. 
How would a sensitive man like her father stand the
constant strain of such a wife, a woman who was all
decision, with no softness, and nothing soothing in her
nature?  It passed as a mere eccentricity when they heard
of her stout drinking, her cigarette smoking, her
occasional whiffs at a long clay pipe, her horsewhipping
of a drunken servant, and her companionship with the
snake Eliza, whom she was in the habit of bearing about
in her pocket.  All this would become unendurable to her
father when his first infatuation was past.  For his own
sake, then, as well as for her mother's memory, this
match must be prevented.  And yet how powerless she was
to prevent it!  What could she do?  Could Harold aid her? 
Perhaps.  Or Ida?  At least she would tell her sister and
see what she could suggest.
<P>
Ida was in her boudoir, a tiny little tapestried
room, as neat and dainty as herself, with low walls hung
with Imari plaques and with pretty little Swiss brackets
bearing blue Kaga ware, or the pure white Coalport china. 
In a low chair beneath a red shaded standing lamp sat
Ida, in a diaphanous evening dress of mousseline de
soie, the ruddy light tinging her sweet childlike face,
and glowing on her golden curls.  She sprang up as her
sister entered, and threw her arms around her.
<P>
"Dear old Clara!  Come and sit down here beside me. 
I have not had a chat for days.  But, oh, what a troubled
face!  What is it then?"  She put up her forefinger and
smoothed her sister's brow with it.
<P>
Clara pulled up a stool, and sitting down beside her
sister, passed her arm round her waist.  "I am so sorry
to trouble you, dear Ida," she said.  "But I do not know
what to do.
<P>
"There's nothing the matter with Harold?"
<P>
"Oh, no, Ida."
<P>
"Nor with my Charles?"
<P>
"No, no."
<P>
Ida gave a sigh of relief.  "You quite frightened me,
dear," said she.  "You can't think how solemn you look. 
What is it, then?"
<P>
"I believe that papa intends to ask Mrs. Westmacott
to marry him."
<P>
Ida burst out laughing.  "What can have put such a
notion into your head, Clara?"
<P>
"It is only too true, Ida.  I suspected it before,
and he himself almost told me as much with his own lips
to-night.  I don't think that it is a laughing matter."
<P>
"Really, I could not help it.  If you had told me
that those two dear old ladies opposite, the Misses
Williams, were both engaged, you would not have surprised
me more.  It is really too funny."
<P>
"Funny, Ida!  Think of any one taking the place of
dear mother.
<P>
But her sister was of a more practical and less
sentimental nature.  "I am sure," said she, "that dear
mother would like papa to do whatever would make him most
happy.  We shall both be away, and why should papa not
please himself?"
<P>
"But think how unhappy he will be.  You know how
quiet he is in his ways, and how even a little thing
will upset him.  How could he live with a wife who would
make his whole life a series of surprises?  Fancy what a
whirlwind she must be in a house.  A man at his age
cannot change his ways.  I am sure he would be
miserable."
<P>
Ida's face grew graver, and she pondered over the
matter for a few minutes.  "I really think that you are
right as usual," said she at last.  "I admire Charlie's
aunt very much, you know, and I think that she is a very
useful and good person, but I don't think she would do as
a wife for poor quiet papa."
<P>
"But he will certainly ask her, and I really think
that she intends to accept him.  Then it would be too
late to interfere.  We have only a few days at the most. 
And what can we do?  How can we hope to make him change
his mind?"
<P>
Again Ida pondered.  "He has never tried what it is
to live with a strong-minded woman," said she.  "If we
could only get him to realize it in time.  Oh, Clara, I
have it; I have it!  Such a lovely plan!"  She leaned
back in her chair and burst into a fit of laughter so
natural and so hearty that Clara had to forget her
troubles and to join in it.
<P>
"Oh, it is beautiful!" she gasped at last. "Poor
papa!  What a time he will have!  But it's all for his
own good, as he used to say when we had to be
punished when we were little.  Oh, Clara, I do hope your
heart won't fail you.
<P>
"I would do anything to save him, dear."
<P>
"That's it.  You must steel yourself by that
thought."
<P>
"But what is your plan?"
<P>
"Oh, I am so proud of it.  We will tire him for ever
of the widow, and of all emancipated women.  Let me see,
what are Mrs. Westmacott's main ideas?  You have listened
to her more than I.  Women should attend less to
household duties.  That is one, is it not?"
<P>
"Yes, if they feel they have capabilities for higher
things.  Then she thinks that every woman who has leisure
should take up the study of some branch of science, and
that, as far as possible, every woman should qualify
herself for some trade or profession, choosing for
preference those which have been hitherto monopolized by
men.  To enter the others would only be to intensify the
present competition."
<P>
" Quite so.  That is glorious!"  Her blue eyes were
dancing with mischief, and she clapped her hands in her
delight.  "What else?  She thinks that whatever a man
can do a woman should be allowed to do also--does she
not?"
<P>
"She says so."
<P>
"And about dress?  The short skirt, and the
divided skirt are what she believes in?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"We must get in some cloth."
<P>
"Why?"
<P>
"We must make ourselves a dress each.  A brand-new,
enfranchised, emancipated dress, dear.  Don't you see my
plan?  We shall act up to all Mrs. Westmacott's views in
every respect, and improve them when we can.  Then papa
will know what it is to live with a woman who claims all
her rights.  Oh, Clara, it will be splendid."
<P>
Her milder sister sat speechless before so daring a
scheme.  "But it would be wrong, Ida!" she cried at last.
<P>
"Not a bit.  It is to save him."
<P>
"I should not dare."
<P>
"Oh, yes, you would.  Harold will help.  Besides,
what other plan have you?"
<P>
"I have none."
<P>
"Then you must take mine."
<P>
"Yes.  Perhaps you are right.  Well, we do it for a
good motive.
<P>
"You will do it?"
<P>
"I do not see any other way."
<P>
"You dear good Clara!  Now I will show you what you
are to do.  We must not begin too suddenly.  It might
excite suspicion."
<P>
"What would you do, then?"
<P>
"To-morrow we must go to Mrs. Westmacott, and sit
at her feet and learn all her views."
<P>
"What hypocrites we shall feel!"
<P>
"We shall be her newest and most enthusiastic
converts.  Oh, it will be such fun, Clara!  Then we shall
make our plans and send for what we want, and begin our
new life."
<P>
"I do hope that we shall not have to keep it up long. 
It seems so cruel to dear papa.
<P>
"Cruel!  To save him!"
<P>
"I wish I was sure that we were doing right.  And yet
what else can we do?  Well, then, Ida, the die is cast,
and we will call upon Mrs. Westmacott tomorrow.
