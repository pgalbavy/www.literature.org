<p>The clock struck eight and she rose suddenly, dropping her sewing
on her chair.  She went to the stairfoot door, opened it,
listening.  Then she went out, locking the door behind her.</p>

<p>Something scuffled in the yard, and she started, though she knew it
was only the rats with which the place was overrun.  The night was
very dark.  In the great bay of railway lines, bulked with trucks,
there was no trace of light, only away back she could see a few
yellow lamps at the pit-top, and the red smear of the burning pit-
bank on the night.  She hurried along the edge of the track, then,
crossing the converging lines, came to the stile by the white
gates, whence she emerged on the road.  Then the fear which had led
her shrank.  People were walking up to New Brinsley; she saw the
lights in the houses; twenty yards further on were the broad
windows of the 'Prince of Wales', very warm and bright, and the
loud voices of men could be heard distinctly.  What a fool she had
been to imagine that anything had happened to him!  He was merely
drinking over there at the 'Prince of Wales'.  She faltered.  She
had never yet been to fetch him, and she never would go.  So she
continued her walk towards the long straggling line of houses,
standing blank on the highway.  She entered a passage between the
dwellings.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr Rigley? - Yes!  Did you want him?  No, he's not in at this
minute.&quot;</p>

<p>The raw-boned woman leaned forward from her dark scullery and
peered at the other, upon whom fell a dim light through the blind
of the kitchen window.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it Mrs Bates?&quot; she asked in a tone tinged with respect.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.  I wondered if your Master was at home.  Mine hasn't come
yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Asn't 'e!  Oh, Jack's been 'ome an 'ad 'is dinner an' gone out.
E's just gone for 'alf an hour afore bedtime.  Did you call at the
'Prince of Wales'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No - &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, you didn't like - !  It's not very nice.&quot;  The other woman was
indulgent.  There was an awkward pause.  &quot;Jack never said nothink
about - about your Mester,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;No! - I expect he's stuck in there!&quot;</p>

<p>Elizabeth Bates said this bitterly, and with recklessness.  She
knew that the woman across the yard was standing at her door
listening, but she did not care.  As she turned:</p>

<p>&quot;Stop a minute!  I'll just go an' ask Jack if e' knows anythink,&quot;
said Mrs Rigley.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no - I wouldn't like to put - !&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I will, if you'll just step inside an' see as th' childer
doesn't come downstairs and set theirselves afire.&quot;</p>

<p>Elizabeth Bates, murmuring a remonstrance, stepped inside.  The
other woman apologized for the state of the room.</p>

<p>The kitchen needed apology.  There were little frocks and trousers
and childish undergarments on the squab and on the floor, and a
litter of playthings everywhere.  On the black American cloth of
the table were pieces of bread and cake, crusts, slops, and a
teapot with cold tea.</p>

<p>&quot;Eh, ours is just as bad,&quot; said Elizabeth Bates, looking at the
woman, not at the house.  Mrs Rigley put a shawl over her head and
hurried out, saying:</p>

<p>&quot;I shanna be a minute.&quot;</p>

<p>The other sat, noting with faint disapproval the general untidiness
of the room.  Then she fell to counting the shoes of various sizes
scattered over the floor.  There were twelve.  She sighed and said
to herself, &quot;No wonder!&quot; - glancing at the litter.  There came the
scratching of two pairs of feet on the yard, and the Rigleys
entered.  Elizabeth Bates rose.  Rigley was a big man, with very
large bones.  His head looked particularly bony.  Across his temple
was a blue scar, caused by a wound got in the pit, a wound in which
the coal-dust remained blue like tattooing.</p>

<p>&quot;Asna 'e come whoam yit?&quot; asked the man, without any form of
greeting, but with deference and sympathy.  &quot;I couldna say wheer he
is - 'e's non ower theer!&quot; - he jerked his head to signify the
'Prince of Wales'.</p>

<p>&quot;'E's 'appen gone up to th' 'Yew',&quot; said Mrs Rigley.</p>

<p>There was another pause.  Rigley had evidently something to get off
his mind:</p>

<p>&quot;Ah left 'im finishin' a stint,&quot; he began.  &quot;Loose-all 'ad bin gone
about ten minutes when we com'n away, an' I shouted, 'Are ter
comin', Walt?' an' 'e said, 'Go on, Ah shanna be but a'ef a
minnit,' so we com'n ter th' bottom, me an' Bowers, thinkin' as 'e
wor just behint, an' 'ud come up i' th' next bantle - &quot;</p>

<p>He stood perplexed, as if answering a charge of deserting his mate.
Elizabeth Bates, now again certain of disaster, hastened to
reassure him:</p>

<p>&quot;I expect 'e's gone up to th' 'Yew Tree', as you say.  It's not the
first time.  I've fretted myself into a fever before now.  He'll
come home when they carry him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, isn't it too bad!&quot; deplored the other woman.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll just step up to Dick's an' see if 'e IS theer,&quot; offered the
man, afraid of appearing alarmed, afraid of taking liberties.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I wouldn't think of bothering you that far,&quot; said Elizabeth
Bates, with emphasis, but he knew she was glad of his offer.</p>

<p>As they stumbled up the entry, Elizabeth Bates heard Rigley's wife
run across the yard and open her neighbour's door.  At this,
suddenly all the blood in her body seemed to switch away from her
heart.</p>

<p>&quot;Mind!&quot; warned Rigley.  &quot;Ah've said many a time as Ah'd fill up
them ruts in this entry, sumb'dy 'll be breakin' their legs yit.&quot;</p>

<p>She recovered herself and walked quickly along with the miner.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't like leaving the children in bed, and nobody in the
house,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;No, you dunna!&quot; he replied courteously.  They were soon at the
gate of the cottage.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I shanna be many minnits.  Dunna you be frettin' now, 'e'll
be all right,&quot; said the butty.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you very much, Mr Rigley,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p>&quot;You're welcome!&quot; he stammered, moving away.  &quot;I shanna be many
minnits.&quot;</p>

<p>The house was quiet.  Elizabeth Bates took off her hat and shawl,
and rolled back the rug.  When she had finished, she sat down.  It
was a few minutes past nine.  She was startled by the rapid chuff
of the winding-engine at the pit, and the sharp whirr of the brakes
on the rope as it descended.  Again she felt the painful sweep of
her blood, and she put her hand to her side, saying aloud, &quot;Good
gracious! - it's only the nine o'clock deputy going down,&quot; rebuking
herself.</p>

<p>She sat still, listening.  Half an hour of this, and she was
wearied out.</p>

<p>&quot;What am I working myself up like this for?&quot; she said pitiably to
herself, &quot;I s'll only be doing myself some damage.&quot;</p>

<p>She took out her sewing again.</p>

<p>At a quarter to ten there were footsteps.  One person!  She watched
for the door to open.  It was an elderly woman, in a black bonnet
and a black woollen shawl - his mother.  She was about sixty years
old, pale, with blue eyes, and her face all wrinkled and
lamentable.  She shut the door and turned to her daughter-in-law
peevishly.</p>

<p>&quot;Eh, Lizzie, whatever shall we do, whatever shall we do!&quot; she
cried.</p>

<p>Elizabeth drew back a little, sharply.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it, mother?&quot; she said.</p>

<p>The elder woman seated herself on the sofa.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know, child, I can't tell you!&quot; - she shook her head
slowly.  Elizabeth sat watching her, anxious and vexed.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; replied the grandmother, sighing very deeply.
&quot;There's no end to my troubles, there isn't.  The things I've gone
through, I'm sure it's enough - !&quot;  She wept without wiping her
eyes, the tears running.</p>

<p>&quot;But, mother,&quot; interrupted Elizabeth, &quot;what do you mean?  What is
it?&quot;</p>

<p>The grandmother slowly wiped her eyes.  The fountains of her tears
were stopped by Elizabeth's directness.  She wiped her eyes slowly.</p>

<p>&quot;Poor child!  Eh, you poor thing!&quot; she moaned.  &quot;I don't know what
we're going to do, I don't - and you as you are - it's a thing, it is
indeed!&quot;</p>

<p>Elizabeth waited.</p>

<p>&quot;Is he dead?&quot; she asked, and at the words her heart swung
violently, though she felt a slight flush of shame at the ultimate
extravagance of the question.  Her words sufficiently frightened
the old lady, almost brought her to herself.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't say so, Elizabeth!  We'll hope it's not as bad as that; no,
may the Lord spare us that, Elizabeth.  Jack Rigley came just as I
was sittin' down to a glass afore going to bed, an' 'e said,
''Appen you'll go down th' line, Mrs Bates.  Walt's had an
accident.  'Appen you'll go an' sit wi' 'er till we can get him
home.'  I hadn't time to ask him a word afore he was gone.  An' I
put my bonnet on an' come straight down, Lizzie.  I thought to
myself, 'Eh, that poor blessed child, if anybody should come an'
tell her of a sudden, there's no knowin' what'll 'appen to 'er.'
You mustn't let it upset you, Lizzie - or you know what to expect.
How long is it, six months - or is it five, Lizzie?  Ay!&quot; - the old
woman shook her head - &quot;time slips on, it slips on!  Ay!&quot;</p>

<p>Elizabeth's thoughts were busy elsewhere.  If he was killed - would
she be able to manage on the little pension and what she could
earn? - she counted up rapidly.  If he was hurt - they wouldn't take
him to the hospital - how tiresome he would be to nurse! - but
perhaps she'd be able to get him away from the drink and his
hateful ways.  She would - while he was ill.  The tears offered to
come to her eyes at the picture.  But what sentimental luxury was
this she was beginning? - She turned to consider the children.  At
any rate she was absolutely necessary for them.  They were her
business.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay!&quot; repeated the old woman, &quot;it seems but a week or two since he
brought me his first wages.  Ay - he was a good lad, Elizabeth, he
was, in his way.  I don't know why he got to be such a trouble, I
don't.  He was a happy lad at home, only full of spirits.  But
there's no mistake he's been a handful of trouble, he has!  I hope
the Lord'll spare him to mend his ways.  I hope so, I hope so.
You've had a sight o' trouble with him, Elizabeth, you have indeed.
But he was a jolly enough lad wi' me, he was, I can assure you.  I
don't know how it is . . .&quot;</p>

<p>The old woman continued to muse aloud, a monotonous irritating
sound, while Elizabeth thought concentratedly, startled once, when
she heard the winding-engine chuff quickly, and the brakes skirr
with a shriek.  Then she heard the engine more slowly, and the
brakes made no sound.  The old woman did not notice.  Elizabeth
waited in suspense.  The mother-in-law talked, with lapses into
silence.</p>

<p>&quot;But he wasn't your son, Lizzie, an' it makes a difference.
Whatever he was, I remember him when he was little, an' I learned
to understand him and to make allowances.  You've got to make
allowances for them - &quot;</p>

<p>It was half-past ten, and the old woman was saying:  &quot;But it's
trouble from beginning to end; you're never too old for trouble,
never too old for that - &quot; when the gate banged back, and there were
heavy feet on the steps.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll go, Lizzie, let me go,&quot; cried the old woman, rising.  But
Elizabeth was at the door.  It was a man in pit-clothes.</p>

<p>&quot;They're bringin' 'im, Missis,&quot; he said.  Elizabeth's heart halted
a moment.  Then it surged on again, almost suffocating her.</p>

<p>&quot;Is he - is it bad?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>The man turned away, looking at the darkness:</p>

<p>&quot;The doctor says 'e'd been dead hours.  'E saw 'im i' th' lamp-
cabin.&quot;</p>

<p>The old woman, who stood just behind Elizabeth, dropped into a
chair, and folded her hands, crying:  &quot;Oh, my boy, my boy!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hush!&quot; said Elizabeth, with a sharp twitch of a frown.  &quot;Be still,
mother, don't waken th' children: I wouldn't have them down for
anything!&quot;</p>

<p>The old woman moaned softly, rocking herself.  The man was drawing
away.  Elizabeth took a step forward.</p>

<p>&quot;How was it?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I couldn't say for sure,&quot; the man replied, very ill at ease.
&quot;'E wor finishin' a stint an' th' butties 'ad gone, an' a lot o'
stuff come down atop 'n 'im.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And crushed him?&quot; cried the widow, with a shudder.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said the man, &quot;it fell at th' back of 'im.  'E wor under th'
face, an' it niver touched 'im.  It shut 'im in.  It seems 'e wor
smothered.&quot;</p>

<p>Elizabeth shrank back.  She heard the old woman behind her cry:</p>

<p>&quot;What? - what did 'e say it was?&quot;</p>

<p>The man replied, more loudly:  &quot;'E wor smothered!&quot;</p>

<p>Then the old woman wailed aloud, and this relieved Elizabeth.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, mother,&quot; she said, putting her hand on the old woman, &quot;don't
waken th' children, don't waken th' children.&quot;</p>

<p>She wept a little, unknowing, while the old mother rocked herself
and moaned.  Elizabeth remembered that they were bringing him home,
and she must be ready.  &quot;They'll lay him in the parlour,&quot; she said
to herself, standing a moment pale and perplexed.</p>

<p>Then she lighted a candle and went into the tiny room.  The air was
cold and damp, but she could not make a fire, there was no
fireplace.  She set down the candle and looked round.  The candle-
light glittered on the lustre-glasses, on the two vases that held
some of the pink chrysanthemums, and on the dark mahogany.  There
was a cold, deathly smell of chrysanthemums in the room.  Elizabeth
stood looking at the flowers.  She turned away, and calculated
whether there would be room to lay him on the floor, between the
couch and the chiffonier.  She pushed the chairs aside.  There
would be room to lay him down and to step round him.  Then she
fetched the old red tablecloth, and another old cloth, spreading
them down to save her bit of carpet.  She shivered on leaving the
parlour; so, from the dresser-drawer she took a clean shirt and put
it at the fire to air.  All the time her mother-in-law was rocking
herself in the chair and moaning.</p>

<p>&quot;You'll have to move from there, mother,&quot; said Elizabeth.  &quot;They'll
be bringing him in.  Come in the rocker.&quot;</p>

<p>The old mother rose mechanically, and seated herself by the fire,
continuing to lament.  Elizabeth went into the pantry for another
candle, and there, in the little penthouse under the naked tiles,
she heard them coming.  She stood still in the pantry doorway,
listening.  She heard them pass the end of the house, and come
awkwardly down the three steps, a jumble of shuffling footsteps and
muttering voices.  The old woman was silent.  The men were in the
yard.</p>

<p>Then Elizabeth heard Matthews, the manager of the pit, say:  &quot;You
go in first, Jim.  Mind!&quot;</p>

<p>The door came open, and the two women saw a collier backing into
the room, holding one end of a stretcher, on which they could see
the nailed pit-boots of the dead man.  The two carriers halted, the
man at the head stooping to the lintel of the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Wheer will you have him?&quot; asked the manager, a short, white-
bearded man.</p>

<p>Elizabeth roused herself and came from the pantry carrying the
unlighted candle.</p>

<p>&quot;In the parlour,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;In there, Jim!&quot; pointed the manager, and the carriers backed round
into the tiny room.  The coat with which they had covered the body
fell off as they awkwardly turned through the two doorways, and the
women saw their man, naked to the waist, lying stripped for work.
The old woman began to moan in a low voice of horror.</p>

<p>&quot;Lay th' stretcher at th' side,&quot; snapped the manager, &quot;an' put 'im
on th' cloths.  Mind now, mind!  Look you now - !&quot;</p>

<p>One of the men had knocked off a vase of chrysanthemums.  He stared
awkwardly, then they set down the stretcher.  Elizabeth did not
look at her husband.  As soon as she could get in the room, she
went and picked up the broken vase and the flowers.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait a minute!&quot; she said.</p>

<p>The three men waited in silence while she mopped up the water with
a duster.</p>

<p>&quot;Eh, what a job, what a job, to be sure!&quot; the manager was saying,
rubbing his brow with trouble and perplexity.  &quot;Never knew such a
thing in my life, never!  He'd no business to ha' been left.  I
never knew such a thing in my life!  Fell over him clean as a
whistle, an' shut him in.  Not four foot of space, there wasn't - 
yet it scarce bruised him.&quot;</p>

<p>He looked down at the dead man, lying prone, half naked, all grimed
with coal-dust.</p>

<p>&quot;''Sphyxiated,' the doctor said.  It IS the most terrible job I've
ever known.  Seems as if it was done o' purpose.  Clean over him,
an' shut 'im in, like a mouse-trap&quot; - he made a sharp, descending
gesture with his hand.</p>

<p>The colliers standing by jerked aside their heads in hopeless
comment.</p>

<p>The horror of the thing bristled upon them all.</p>

<p>Then they heard the girl's voice upstairs calling shrilly:
&quot;Mother, mother - who is it?  Mother, who is it?&quot;</p>

<p>Elizabeth hurried to the foot of the stairs and opened the door:</p>

<p>&quot;Go to sleep!&quot; she commanded sharply.  &quot;What are you shouting
about?  Go to sleep at once - there's nothing - &quot;</p>

<p>Then she began to mount the stairs.  They could hear her on the
boards, and on the plaster floor of the little bedroom.  They could
hear her distinctly:</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter now? - what's the matter with you, silly thing?&quot; - 
her voice was much agitated, with an unreal gentleness.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought it was some men come,&quot; said the plaintive voice of the
child.  &quot;Has he come?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, they've brought him.  There's nothing to make a fuss about.
Go to sleep now, like a good child.&quot;</p>

<p>They could hear her voice in the bedroom, they waited whilst she
covered the children under the bedclothes.</p>

<p>&quot;Is he drunk?&quot; asked the girl, timidly, faintly.</p>

<p>&quot;No!  No - he's not!  He - he's asleep.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is he asleep downstairs?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes - and don't make a noise.&quot;</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, then the men heard the frightened
child again:</p>

<p>&quot;What's that noise?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's nothing, I tell you, what are you bothering for?&quot;</p>

<p>The noise was the grandmother moaning.  She was oblivious of
everything, sitting on her chair rocking and moaning.  The manager
put his hand on her arm and bade her &quot;Sh - sh!!&quot;</p>

<p>The old woman opened her eyes and looked at him.  She was shocked
by this interruption, and seemed to wonder.</p>

<p>&quot;What time is it?&quot; - the plaintive thin voice of the child, sinking
back unhappily into sleep, asked this last question.</p>

<p>&quot;Ten o'clock,&quot; answered the mother more softly.  Then she must have
bent down and kissed the children.</p>

<p>Matthews beckoned to the men to come away.  They put on their caps
and took up the stretcher.  Stepping over the body, they tiptoed
out of the house.  None of them spoke till they were far from the
wakeful children.</p>

<p>When Elizabeth came down she found her mother alone on the parlour
floor, leaning over the dead man, the tears dropping on him.</p>

<p>&quot;We must lay him out,&quot; the wife said.  She put on the kettle, then
returning knelt at the feet, and began to unfasten the knotted
leather laces.  The room was clammy and dim with only one candle,
so that she had to bend her face almost to the floor.  At last she
got off the heavy boots and put them away.</p>

<p>&quot;You must help me now,&quot; she whispered to the old woman.  Together
they stripped the man.</p>

<p>When they arose, saw him lying in the na&iuml;ve dignity of death, the
women stood arrested in fear and respect.  For a few moments they
remained still, looking down, the old mother whimpering.  Elizabeth
felt countermanded.  She saw him, how utterly inviolable he lay in
himself.  She had nothing to do with him.  She could not accept it.
Stooping, she laid her hand on him, in claim.  He was still warm,
for the mine was hot where he had died.  His mother had his face
between her hands, and was murmuring incoherently.  The old tears
fell in succession as drops from wet leaves; the mother was not
weeping, merely her tears flowed.  Elizabeth embraced the body of
her husband, with cheek and lips.  She seemed to be listening,
inquiring, trying to get some connection.  But she could not.  She
was driven away.  He was impregnable.</p>

<p>She rose, went into the kitchen, where she poured warm water into a
bowl, brought soap and flannel and a soft towel.</p>

<p>&quot;I must wash him,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Then the old mother rose stiffly, and watched Elizabeth as she
carefully washed his face, carefully brushing the big blond
moustache from his mouth with the flannel.  She was afraid with a
bottomless fear, so she ministered to him.  The old woman, jealous,
said:</p>

<p>&quot;Let me wipe him!&quot; - and she kneeled on the other side drying slowly
as Elizabeth washed, her big black bonnet sometimes brushing the
dark head of her daughter.  They worked thus in silence for a long
time.  They never forgot it was death, and the touch of the man's
dead body gave them strange emotions, different in each of the
women; a great dread possessed them both, the mother felt the lie
was given to her womb, she was denied; the wife felt the utter
isolation of the human soul, the child within her was a weight
apart from her.</p>

<p>At last it was finished.  He was a man of handsome body, and his
face showed no traces of drink.  He was blonde, full-fleshed, with
fine limbs.  But he was dead.</p>

<p>&quot;Bless him,&quot; whispered his mother, looking always at his face, and
speaking out of sheer terror.  &quot;Dear lad - bless him!&quot;  She spoke in
a faint, sibilant ecstasy of fear and mother love.</p>

<p>Elizabeth sank down again to the floor, and put her face against
his neck, and trembled and shuddered.  But she had to draw away
again.  He was dead, and her living flesh had no place against his.
A great dread and weariness held her: she was so unavailing.  Her
life was gone like this.</p>

<p>&quot;White as milk he is, clear as a twelve-month baby, bless him, the
darling!&quot; the old mother murmured to herself.  &quot;Not a mark on him,
clear and clean and white, beautiful as ever a child was made,&quot; she
murmured with pride.  Elizabeth kept her face hidden.</p>

<p>&quot;He went peaceful, Lizzie - peaceful as sleep.  Isn't he beautiful,
the lamb?  Ay - he must ha' made his peace, Lizzie.  'Appen he made
it all right, Lizzie, shut in there.  He'd have time.  He wouldn't
look like this if he hadn't made his peace.  The lamb, the dear
lamb.  Eh, but he had a hearty laugh.  I loved to hear it.  He had
the heartiest laugh, Lizzie, as a lad - &quot;</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked up.  The man's mouth was fallen back, slightly
open under the cover of the moustache.  The eyes, half shut, did
not show glazed in the obscurity.  Life with its smoky burning gone
from him, had left him apart and utterly alien to her.  And she
knew what a stranger he was to her.  In her womb was ice of fear,
because of this separate stranger with whom she had been living as
one flesh.  Was this what it all meant - utter, intact separateness,
obscured by heat of living?  In dread she turned her face away.
The fact was too deadly.  There had been nothing between them, and
yet they had come together, exchanging their nakedness repeatedly.
Each time he had taken her, they had been two isolated beings, far
apart as now.  He was no more responsible than she.  The child was
like ice in her womb.  For as she looked at the dead man, her mind,
cold and detached, said clearly:  &quot;Who am I?  What have I been
doing?  I have been fighting a husband who did not exist.  HE
existed all the time.  What wrong have I done?  What was that I
have been living with?  There lies the reality, this man.&quot; - And her
soul died in her for fear: she knew she had never seen him, he had
never seen her, they had met in the dark and had fought in the
dark, not knowing whom they met nor whom they fought.  And now she
saw, and turned silent in seeing.  For she had been wrong.  She had
said he was something he was not; she had felt familiar with him.
Whereas he was apart all the while, living as she never lived,
feeling as she never felt.</p>

<p>In fear and shame she looked at his naked body, that she had known
falsely.  And he was the father of her children.  Her soul was torn
from her body and stood apart.  She looked at his naked body and
was ashamed, as if she had denied it.  After all, it was itself.
It seemed awful to her.  She looked at his face, and she turned her
own face to the wall.  For his look was other than hers, his way
was not her way.  She had denied him what he was - she saw it now.
She had refused him as himself. - And this had been her life, and
his life. - She was grateful to death, which restored the truth.
And she knew she was not dead.</p>

<p>And all the while her heart was bursting with grief and pity for
him.  What had he suffered?  What stretch of horror for this
helpless man!  She was rigid with agony.  She had not been able to
help him.  He had been cruelly injured, this naked man, this other
being, and she could make no reparation.  There were the children - 
but the children belonged to life.  This dead man had nothing to do
with them.  He and she were only channels through which life had
flowed to issue in the children.  She was a mother - but how awful
she knew it now to have been a wife.  And he, dead now, how awful
he must have felt it to be a husband.  She felt that in the next
world he would be a stranger to her.  If they met there, in the
beyond, they would only be ashamed of what had been before.  The
children had come, for some mysterious reason, out of both of them.
But the children did not unite them.  Now he was dead, she knew how
eternally he was apart from her, how eternally he had nothing more
to do with her.  She saw this episode of her life closed.  They had
denied each other in life.  Now he had withdrawn.  An anguish came
over her.  It was finished then: it had become hopeless between
them long before he died.  Yet he had been her husband.  But how
little! - </p>

<p>&quot;Have you got his shirt, 'Lizabeth?&quot;</p>

<p>Elizabeth turned without answering, though she strove to weep and
behave as her mother-in-law expected.  But she could not, she was
silenced.  She went into the kitchen and returned with the garment.</p>

<p>&quot;It is aired,&quot; she said, grasping the cotton shirt here and there
to try.  She was almost ashamed to handle him; what right had she
or anyone to lay hands on him; but her touch was humble on his
body.  It was hard work to clothe him.  He was so heavy and inert.
A terrible dread gripped her all the while: that he could be so
heavy and utterly inert, unresponsive, apart.  The horror of the
distance between them was almost too much for her - it was so
infinite a gap she must look across.</p>

<p>At last it was finished.  They covered him with a sheet and left
him lying, with his face bound.  And she fastened the door of the
little parlour, lest the children should see what was lying there.
Then, with peace sunk heavy on her heart, she went about making
tidy the kitchen.  She knew she submitted to life, which was her
immediate master.  But from death, her ultimate master, she winced
with fear and shame.</p>
