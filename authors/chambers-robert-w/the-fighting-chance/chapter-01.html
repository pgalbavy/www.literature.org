<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The speed of the train slackened; a broad tidal river flashed
into sight below the trestle, spreading away on either hand through
yellowing level meadows. And now, above the roaring undertone
of the cars, from far ahead floated back the treble bell-notes
of the locomotive; there came a gritting vibration of brakes;
slowly, more slowly the cars glided to a creaking standstill beside
a sun-scorched platform gay with the bright flutter of sunshades
and summer gowns.</p>

<p>"Shotover! Shotover!" rang the far cry along the cars; and an
absent-minded young man in the Pullman pocketed the uncut magazine
he had been dreaming over and, picking up gun case and valise,
followed a line of fellow-passengers to the open air, where one
by one they were engulfed and lost to view amid the gay confusion
on the platform.</p>

<p>The absent-minded young man, however, did not seem to know exactly
where he was bound for. He stood hesitating, leisurely inspecting
the flashing ranks of vehicles&mdash;depot wagons, omnibusses, and
motor cars already eddying around a dusty gravel drive centred
by the conventional railroad flower bed and fountain.</p>

<p>Sunshine blazed on foliage plants arranged geometrically, on
scarlet stars composed of geraniums, on thickets of tall flame-tinted
cannas. And around this triumph of landscape gardening, phaeton,
Tilbury, Mercedes, and Toledo backed, circled, tooted; gaily gowned
women, whips aslant, horses dancing, greeted expected guests;
laughing young men climbed into dog-carts and took the reins from
nimble grooms; young girls, extravagantly veiled, made room in
comfortable touring-cars for feminine guests whose extravagant
veils were yet to be unpacked; slim young men in leather trappings,
caps adorned with elaborate masks or goggles, manipulated rakish
steering-gears; preoccupied machinists were fussing with valve
and radiator or were cranking up; and, through the jolly tumult,
the melancholy bell of the locomotive sounded, and the long train
moved out through the September sunshine amid clouds of snowy
steam.</p>

<p>And all this time the young man, gun case in one hand, suit case
in the other, looked about him in his good-humoured, leisurely
manner for anybody or any vehicle which might be waiting for him.
His amiable inspection presently brought a bustling baggage-master
within range of vision; and he spoke to this official, mentioning
his host's name.</p>

<p>"Lookin' for Mr. Ferrall?" repeated the baggage-master, spinning
a trunk dexterously into rank with its fellows. "Say, one of Mr.
Ferrall's men was here just now&mdash;there he is, over there uncrating
that there bird-dog!"</p>

<p>The young man's eyes followed the direction indicated by the
grimy thumb; a red-faced groom in familiar livery was kneeling
beside a dog's travelling crate, attempting to unlock it, while
behind the bars an excited white setter whined and thrust forth
first one silky paw then the other.</p>

<p>The young man watched the scene for a moment, then:</p>

<p>"Are you one of Mr. Ferrall's men?" he asked in his agreeable
voice.</p>

<p>The groom looked up, then stood up:</p>

<p>"Yis, Sorr."</p>

<p>"Take these; I'm Mr. Siward&mdash;for Shotover House. I dare say you
have room for me and the dog, too."</p>

<p>The groom opened his mouth to speak, but Siward took the crate
key from his fingers, knelt, and tried the lock. It resisted.
From the depths of the crate a beseeching paw fell upon his cuff.</p>

<p>"Certainly, old fellow," he said soothingly, "I know how you
feel about it; I know you're in a hurry&mdash;and we'll have you out
in a second&mdash;steady, boy!&mdash;something's jammed, you see! Only one
moment now! There you are!"</p>

<p>The dog attempted to bolt as the crate door opened, but the young
man caught him by the leather collar and the groom snapped on
a leash.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, Sorr," began the groom, carried almost off his feet
by the frantic circling of the dog&mdash;"beg pardon, Sorr, but I'll
be afther seem' if anny of Mr. Ferrall's men drove over for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! Are you not one of Mr. Ferrall's men?"</p>

<p>"Yis, Sorr, but I hadn't anny orders to meet anny wan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Haven't you anything here to drive me in?"</p>

<p>"Yis, Sorr &mdash;I'll look to see&mdash;"</p>

<p>The raw groom, much embarrassed, and keeping his feet with difficulty
against the plunging dog, turned toward the gravel drive where
now only a steam motor and a depot-wagon remained. As they looked
the motor steamed out, honking hoarsely; the depot-wagon followed,
leaving the circle at the end of the station empty of vehicles.</p>

<p>"Didn't Mr. Ferrall expect me?" asked Siward.</p>

<p>"Aw, yis, Sorr; but the gintlemen for Shotover House does ginerally
allways coom by Black Fells, Sorr&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!" said the young man, "I remember now. I should have
gone on to Black Fells Crossing; Mr. Ferrall wrote me!" Then,
amused: "I suppose you have only a baggage-wagon here?"</p>

<p>"No, Sorr&mdash;a phayton"&mdash;he hesitated.</p>

<p>"Well? Isn't a phaeton all right?"</p>

<p>"Yis, Sorr&mdash;if th' yoong lady says so&mdash;beg pardon, Sorr, Miss
Landis is driving."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;h! I see. … Is Miss Landis a guest at Shotover House?"</p>

<p>"Yis, Sorr. An' if ye would joost ask her&mdash;the phayton do be
coming now, Sorr!"</p>

<p>The phaeton was coming; the horse, a showy animal, executed side-steps;
blue ribbons fluttered from the glittering head-stall; a young
girl in white was driving.</p>

<p>Siward advanced to the platform's edge as the phaeton drew up;
the young lady looked inquiringly at the groom, at the dog, and
leisurely at him.</p>

<p>So he took off his hat, naming himself in that well-bred and
agreeable manner characteristic of men of his sort,&mdash;and even
his smile appeared to be part and parcel of a conventional ensemble
so harmonious as to remain inconspicuous.</p>

<p>"You should have gone on to Black Fells Crossing," observed Miss
Landis, coolly controlling the nervous horse. "Didn't you know
it?"</p>

<p>He said he remembered now that such were the directions given
him.</p>

<p>The girl glanced at him incuriously, and with more curiosity
at the dog. "Is that the Sagamore pup, Flynn?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It is, Miss."</p>

<p>"Can't you take him on the rumble with you?" And, to Siward:
"There is room for your gun and suit case."</p>

<p>"And for me?" he asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"I think so. Be careful of that Sagamore pup, Flynn. Hold him
between your knees. Are you ready, Mr. Siward?"</p>

<p>So he climbed in; the groom hoisted the dog to the rumble and
sprang up behind; the horse danced and misbehaved, making a spectacle
of himself and an agreeable picture of his driver; then the pretty
little phaeton swung northward out of the gravel drive and went
whirling along a road all misty with puffs of yellow dust which
the afternoon sun turned to floating golden powder.</p>

<p>"Did you send my telegram, Flynn?" she asked without turning
her head.</p>

<p>"I did, Miss."</p>

<p>It being the most important telegram she had ever sent in all
her life, Miss Landis became preoccupied,&mdash;quite oblivious to
extraneous details, including Siward, until the horse began acting
badly again. Her slightly disdainful and perfect control of the
reins interested the young man. He might have said something civil
and conventional about that, but did not make the effort to invade
a reserve which appeared to embarrass nobody.</p>

<p>A stacatto note from the dog, prolonged infinitely in hysterical
crescendo, demanded comment from somebody.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with him, Flynn?" she asked.</p>

<p>Siward said: "You should let him run, Miss Landis."</p>

<p>She nodded, smiling, inattentive, absorbed in her own affairs,
still theorising concerning her telegram. She drove on for a while,
and might have forgotten the dog entirely had he not once more
lifted his voice in melancholy.</p>

<p>"You say he ought to run for a mile or two? Do you think he'll
bolt, Mr. Siward?"</p>

<p>"Is he a new dog?"</p>

<p>"Yes, fresh from the kennels; supposed to be house-and wagon-broken,
steady to shot and wing&mdash;" She shrugged her pretty shoulders.
"You see how he's acting already!"</p>

<p>"Do you mind if I try him?" suggested Siward.</p>

<p>"You mean that you are going to let him run?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"And if he bolts?"</p>

<p>"I'll take my chances."</p>

<p>"Yes, but please consider my chances, Mr. Siward. The dog doesn't
belong to me."</p>

<p>"But he ought to run&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But suppose he runs away? He's a horridly expensive creature&mdash;if
you care to take the risk."</p>

<p>"I'll take the risk," said Siward, smiling as she drew rein.
"Now Flynn, give me the leash. Quiet! Quiet, puppy! Everything
is coming your way; that's the beauty of patience; great thing,
patience!" He took the leader; the dog sprang from the rumble.
"Now, my friend, look at me! No, don't twist and squirm and scramble;
look me square in the eye; so! … Now we know each ether and we
respect each other&mdash;because you are going to be a good puppy …
and obey … Down charge!"</p>

<p>The dog, trembling with eager comprehension, dropped like a shot,
muzzle laid flat between his paws. Siward unleashed him, looked
down at him for a second, stooped and caressed the silky head,
then with a laugh swung himself into the phaeton beside the driver,
who, pretty head turned, had been looking on intently.</p>

<p>"Your dog is yard-broken," he said. "Look at him."</p>

<p>"I see. Do you think he will follow us?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>The horse started, Miss Landis looking back over her shoulder
at the dog who lay motionless, crouched flat in the road.</p>

<p>Then Siward turned. "Come on, Sagamore!" he said gaily; and the
dog sprang forward, circled about the moving phaeton, splitting
the air with yelps of ecstasy, then tore ahead, mad with the delight
of stretching cramped muscles amid the long rank grass and shrubbery
of the roadside.</p>

<p>The girl watched him doubtfully; when he disappeared far away
up the road she turned the blue inquiry of her eyes on Siward.</p>

<p>"He'll be back," said the young fellow, laughing; and presently
the dog reappeared on a tearing gallop, white flag tossing, glorious
in his new liberty, enchanted with the confidence this tall young
man had reposed in him&mdash;this adorable young man, this wonderful
friend who had suddenly appeared to release him from an undignified
and abominable situation in a crate.</p>

<p>"A good dog," said Siward; and the girl looked around at him,
partly because his voice was pleasant, partly because a vague
memory was beginning to stir within her, coupling something unpleasant
with the name of Siward.</p>

<p>She had been conscious of it when he first named himself, but,
absorbed in the overwhelming importance of her telegram, had left
the analysis of the matter for the future.</p>

<p>She thought again of her telegram, theorised a little, came to
no conclusion except to let the matter rest for the present, and
mentally turned to the next and far less important problem&mdash;the
question of this rather attractive young man at her side, and
why the name of Siward should be linked in her mind with anything
disagreeable.</p>

<p>Tentatively following the elusive mental dews that might awaken
something definite concerning her hazy impression of the man beside
her, she spoke pleasantly, conventionally, touching idly any topic
that might have a bearing; and, under a self-possession so detached
as to give an impression of indifference, eyes, ears, and intelligence
admitted that he was agreeable to look at, pleasant of voice,
and difficult to reconcile with anything unpleasant.</p>

<p>Which gradually aroused her interest&mdash;the incongruous usually
interesting girls of her age&mdash;for he had wit enough to amuse her,
sufficient inconsequence to please her, and something listless,
at times almost absent-minded, almost inattentive, that might
have piqued her had it not inoculated her, as it always does any
woman, with the nascent germ of curiosity. Besides, there was,
in the hint of his momentary preoccupation, a certain charm.</p>

<p>They discussed shooting and the opening of the season; dogs and
the training of dogs; and why some go gun-shy and why some ace
blinkers. From sport and its justification, they became inconsequential;
and she was beginning to enjoy the freshness of their chance acquaintance,
his nice attitude toward things, his irrelevancy, his gaiety.</p>

<p>Laughter thawed her; for notwithstanding the fearless confidence
she had been taught for men of her own kind, self-possession and
reserve, if not inherent, had also been drilled into her, and
she required a great deal in a man before she paid him the tribute
of one of her pretty laughs.</p>

<p>Apparently they were advancing rather rapidly.</p>

<p>"Don't you think we ought to call the dog in, Mr. Siward?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he's had enough!"</p>

<p>She drew rein; he sprang out and whistled; and the Sagamore pup,
dusty and happy came romping back. Siward motioned him to the
rumble, but the dog leaped to the front.</p>

<p>"I don't mind," said the girl. "Let him sit here between us.
And you might occupy yourself by pulling some of those burrs from
his ears&mdash;if you will?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will. Look up here, puppy! No! Don't try to lick
my face, for that is bad manners. Demonstrations are odious, as
the poet says."</p>

<p>"It's always bad manners, isn't it?" asked Miss Landis.</p>

<p>"What? Being affectionate?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and admitting it."</p>

<p>"I believe it is. Do you hear that &mdash;Sagamore? But never
mind; I'll break the rules some day when we're alone."</p>

<p>The dog laid one paw on Siward's knee, looking him wistfully
in the eyes.</p>

<p>"More demonstrations," observed the girl. "Mr. Siward! You are
hugging him! This amounts to a dual conspiracy in bad manners."</p>

<p>"Awfully glad to admit you to the conspiracy," he said. "There's
one vacancy&mdash;if you are eligible."</p>

<p>"I am; I was discovered recently kissing my saddle-mare."</p>

<p>"That settles it! Sagamore, give the young lady the grip."</p>

<p>Sylvia Landis glanced at the dog, then impulsively shifting the
whip to her left hand, held out the right. And very gravely the
Sagamore pup laid one paw in her dainty white gloved palm.</p>

<p>"You darling!" murmured the girl, resuming her whip.</p>

<p>"I notice," observed Siward, "that you are perfectly qualified
for membership in our association for the promotion of bad manners.
In fact I should suggest you for the presidency&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I suppose you think all sorts of things because I gushed over
that dog."</p>

<p>"Of course I do."</p>

<p>"Well you need not," she rejoined, delicate nose up-tilted. "I
never kissed a baby in all my life&mdash;and never mean to. Which is
probably more than you can say."</p>

<p>"Yes, its more than I can say.</p>

<p>"That admission elects you president," she concluded. But after
a moment's silent driving she turned partly toward him with mock
seriousness: "Is it not horridly unnatural in me to feel that
way about babies? And about people, too; I simply cannot endure
demonstrations. As for dogs and horses&mdash;well, I've admitted how
I behave; and, being so shamelessly affectionate by disposition,
why can't I be nice to babies? I've a hazy but dreadful notion
that there's something wrong about me, Mr. Siward."</p>

<p>He scrutinised the pretty features, anxiously; "I can't see it,"
he said.</p>

<p>"But I mean it&mdash;almost seriously. I don't want to be so aloof,
but &mdash;I don't like to touch other people. It is rather horrid
of me I suppose to be like those silky, plumy, luxurious Angora
cats who never are civil to you and who always jump out of your
arms at the first opportunity."</p>

<p>He laughed&mdash;and there was malice in his eyes, but he did not
know her well enough to pursue the subject through so easy an
opening.</p>

<p>It had occurred to her, too, that her simile might invite elaboration,
and she sensed the laugh in his silence, and liked him for remaining
silent where he might easily have been wittily otherwise.</p>

<p>This set her so much at ease, left her so confident, that they
were on terms of gayest understanding presently, she gossiping
about the guests at Shotover House, outlining the diversions planned
for the two weeks before them.</p>

<p>"But we shall see little of one another; you will be shooting
most of the time," she said&mdash;with the very faintest hint of challenge&mdash;too
delicate, too impersonal to savour of coquetry. But the germ of
it was there.</p>

<p>"Do you shoot?"</p>

<p>"Yes; why?"</p>

<p>"I am reconciled to the shooting, then."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is awfully civil of you. Sometimes I'd rather play
Bridge."</p>

<p>"So should <em>I&mdash;</em>sometimes."</p>

<p>"I'll remember that, Mr. Siward; and when all the men are waiting
for you to start out after grouse perhaps I may take that moment
to whisper: 'May I play?'"</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"You mean that you really would stay and play double dummy when
every other living man will be off to the coverts? Double dummy&mdash;to
improve my game?"</p>

<p>"Certainly! I need improvement."</p>

<p>"Then there is something wrong with you, too, Mr. Siward."</p>

<p>She laughed and started to flick her whip, but at her first motion
the horse gave trouble.</p>

<p>"The bit doesn't fit," observed Siward.</p>

<p>"You are perfectly right," she returned, surprised. "I ought
to have remembered; it is shameful to drive a horse improperly
bitted." And, after a moment: "You are considerate toward animals;
it is good in a man."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's no merit. When animals are uncomfortable it worries
me. It's one sort of selfishness, you see."</p>

<p>"What nonsense," she said; and her smile was very friendly. "Why
doesn't a nice man ever admit he's nice when told so?"</p>

<p>It seems they had advanced that far. For she was beginning to
find this young man not only safe but promising; she had met nobody
recently half as amusing, and the outlook at Shotover House had
been unpromising with only the overgrateful Page twins to practise
on&mdash;the other men collectively and individually boring her. And
suddenly, welcome as manna from the sky, behold this highly agreeable
boy to play with&mdash;until Quarrier arrived. Her telegram had been
addressed to Mr. Quarrier.</p>

<p>"What was it you were saying about selfishness?" she asked. "Oh,
I remember. It was nonsense."</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>She laughed, adding: "Selfishness is so simply defined you know."</p>

<p>"Is it? How."</p>

<p>"A refusal to renounce. That covers everything," she concluded.</p>

<p>"Sometimes renunciation is weakness&mdash;isn't it?" he suggested.</p>

<p>"In what case for example?"</p>

<p>"Well, suppose we take love."</p>

<p>"Very well, you may take it if you like it."</p>

<p>"Suppose you loved a man!" he insisted.</p>

<p>"Let him beware! What then?"</p>

<p>" &mdash;And, suppose it would distress your family if you married
him?"</p>

<p>"I'd give him up."</p>

<p>"If you loved him?"</p>

<p>"Love? That is the poorest excuse for selfishness, Mr. Siward."</p>

<p>"So you would ruin your happiness and his&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A girl ought to find more happiness in renouncing a selfish
love than in love itself," announced Miss Landis with that serious
conviction characteristic of her years.</p>

<p>"Of course," assented Siward with a touch of malice, "if you
really do find more happiness in renouncing love than in love
itself, it would be foolish not to do it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Siward! You are derisive. Besides, you are not acute. A
woman is always an opportunist. When the event takes place I shall
know what to do."</p>

<p>"You mean when you want to marry the man you mustn't?</p>

<p>"Exactly. I probably shall."</p>

<p>"Marry him?</p>

<p>"Wish to!"</p>

<p>"I see. But you won't, of course."</p>

<p>She drew rein, bringing the horse to a walk at the foot of a
long hill.</p>

<p>"We are going much too fast," said Miss Landis, smiling.</p>

<p>"Driving too fast for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, not driving, going&mdash;you and I."</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes I do. We are on all sorts of terms, already."</p>

<p>"In the country, you know, people&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes I know all about it, and what old and valued friends one
makes at a week's end. But it has been a matter of half-hours
with us, Mr. Siward."</p>

<p>"Let us sit very still and think it over," he suggested. And
they both laughed.</p>

<p>It was perhaps the reaction of her gaiety that recalled to her
mind her telegram. The telegram had been her promised answer after
she had had time to consider a suggestion made to her by a Mr.
Howard Quarrier. The last week at Shotover permitted reflection;
and while her telegram was no complete answer to the suggestion
he had made, it contained material of interest in the eight words:
"I will consider your request when you arrive.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you know Howard Quarrier?" she said.</p>

<p>After a second's hesitation he replied: "Yes&mdash;a little. Everybody
does."</p>

<p>"You do know him?"</p>

<p>"Only at&mdash;the club."</p>

<p>"Oh, the Lenox?"</p>

<p>"The Lenox&mdash;and the Patroons."</p>

<p>Preoccupied, driving with careless, almost inattentive perfection,
she thought idly of her twenty-three years, wondering how life
could have passed so quickly leaving her already stranded on the
shoals of an engagement to marry Howard Quarrier. Then her thoughts,
errant, wandered half the world over before they returned to Siward;
and when at length they did, and meaning to be civil, she spoke
again of his acquaintance with Quarrier at the Patroons Club&mdash;the
club itself being sufficient to settle Siward's status in every
community.</p>

<p>"I'm trying to remember what it is I have heard about you," she
continued amiably; "you are&mdash;"</p>

<p>An odd expression in his eyes arrested her&mdash;long enough to note
their colour and expression&mdash;and she continued, pleasantly; "&mdash;you
are Stephen Siward, are you not? You see I know your name perfectly
well&mdash;" Her straight brows contracted a trifle; she drove on,
lips compressed, following an elusive train of thought which vaguely,
persistently, coupled his name with something indefinitely unpleasant.
And she could not reconcile this with his appearance. However,
the train of unlinked ideas which she pursued began to form the
semblance of a chain. Coupling his name with Quarrier's, and with
a club, aroused memory; vague uneasiness stirred her to a glimmering
comprehension. Siward? Stephen Siward? One of the New York Siwards
then;&mdash;one of that race&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly the truth flashed upon her,&mdash;the crude truth lacking
definite detail, lacking circumstance and colour and atmosphere,&mdash;merely
the raw and ugly truth.</p>

<p>Had he looked at her&mdash;and he did, once&mdash;he could have seen only
the unruffled and very sweet profile of a young girl. Composure
was one of the masks she had learned to wear&mdash;when she chose.</p>

<p>And she was thinking very hard all the while; "So this is the
man? I might have known his name. Where were my five wits? Siward!
&mdash;Stephen Siward! … He is very young, too … much too young
to be so horrid. … Yet&mdash;it wasn't so dreadful, after all; only
the publicity! Dear me! I knew we were going too fast."</p>

<p>"Miss Landis," he said.</p>

<p>"Mr. Siward?"&mdash;very gently. It was her way to be gentle when
generous.</p>

<p>"I think," he said, "that you are beginning to remember where
you may have heard my name."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a little&mdash;" She looked at him with the direct gaze of a
child, but the lovely eyes were troubled. His smile was not very
genuine, but he met her gaze steadily enough.</p>

<p>"It was rather nice of Mrs. Ferrall to ask me," he said, "after
the mess I made of things last spring."</p>

<p>"Grace Ferrall is a dear," she replied.</p>

<p>After a moment he ventured: "I suppose you saw it in the papers."</p>

<p>"I think so; I had completely forgotten it; your name seemed
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see." Then, listlessly: "I couldn't have ventured to remind
you that&mdash;that perhaps you might not care to be so amiable&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Siward," she said impulsively, "you are nice to me! Why
shouldn't I be amiable? It was&mdash;it was &mdash;I've forgotten just
how dreadfully you did behave&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pretty badly."</p>

<p>"Very?"</p>

<p>"They say so."</p>

<p>"And what is your opinion Mr. Siward?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I ought to have known better." Something about him reminded
her of a bad small boy; and suddenly in spite of her better sense,
in spite of her instinctive caution, she found herself on the
very verge of laughter. What was it in the man that disarmed and
invited a confidence&mdash;scarcely justified it appeared? What was
it now that moved her to overlook what few overlook&mdash;not the fault,
but its publicity? Was it his agreeable bearing, his pleasant
badinage, his amiably listless moments of preoccupation, his youth
that appealed to her&mdash;aroused her charity, her generosity, her
curiosity?</p>

<p>And had other people continued to accept him, too? What would
Quarrier think of his presence at Shotover? She began to realise
that she was a little afraid of Quarrier's opinions. And his opinions
were always judgments. However Grace Ferrall had thought it proper
to ask him, and that meant social absolution. As far as that went
she also was perfectly ready to absolve him if he needed it. But
perhaps he didn't care! &mdash;She looked at him, furtively. He
seemed to be tranquil enough in his abstraction. Trouble appeared
to slide very easily from his broad young shoulders. Perhaps he
was already taking much for granted in her gentleness with him.
And gradually speculation became interest and interest a young
girl's innocent curiosity to learn something of a man whose record
it seemed almost impossible to reconcile with his personality.</p>

<p>"I was wondering," he said looking up to encounter her clear
eyes, "whose house that is over there?"</p>

<p>"Beverly Plank's shooting-box; Black Fells," she replied nodding
toward the vast pile of blackish rocks against the sky, upon which
sprawled a heavy stone house infested with chimneys.</p>

<p>"Plank? Oh yes."</p>

<p>He smiled to remember the battering blows rained upon the ramparts
of society by the master of Black Fells.</p>

<p>But the smile faded; and, glancing at him, the girl was surprised
to see the subtle change in his face&mdash;the white worn look, then
the old listless apathy which, all at once to her, hinted of something
graver than preoccupation.</p>

<p>"Are we near the sea?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Very near. Only a moment to the top of this hill. … Now look!"</p>

<p>There lay the sea&mdash;the same grey-blue crawling void that had
ever fascinated and repelled him&mdash;always wrinkled, always in flat
monotonous motion, spreading away, away to the sad world's ends.</p>

<p>"Full of menace&mdash;always," he said, unconscious that he had spoken
aloud.</p>

<p>"The sea!"</p>

<p>He spoke without turning: "The sea is a relentless thing for
a man to fight. … There are other tides more persistent than the
sea, but like it&mdash;like it in its menace."</p>

<p>His face seemed thinner, older; she noticed his cheek bones for
the first time. Then, meeting her eyes, youth returned with a
laugh and a touch of colour; and, without understanding exactly
how, she was aware, presently, that they had insensibly slipped
back to their light badinage and gay inconsequences&mdash;back to a
footing which, strangely, seemed to be already an old footing,
familiar, pleasant, and natural to return to.</p>
