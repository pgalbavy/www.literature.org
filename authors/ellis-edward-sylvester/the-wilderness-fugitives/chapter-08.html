<p>Grinning in his imperturbable fashion, the Mohawk turned part
way round, and made a signal, evidently for some one invisible
to all. Be that as it may, it was instantly responded to by the
coming forward of a man in the ordinary dress of a farmer settler
of the valley. He had an honest countenance, and was about forty
years old. As he came into full view, so that the firelight fell
full upon his face, he was recognized as an old acquaintance,
named Perkins, who lived but a short distance from where the camp
fire was burning.</p>

<p>"Wall, how are ye all?" he asked in a drawling voice and an accent
that betrayed the fact that he was one of the descendants of the
Connecticut pioneers that built Forty Fort, not a great many years
before. "I say, how are ye all?" he continued, as he began shaking
hands round. "I'll be shot if I expected to see any one of ye
folks round here. I say, how are ye all agin?"</p>

<p>"Well, Ike," replied Ned Clinton, who was well acquainted with
him, and felt authorized to answer, "we are all right, as you
can see for yourself, and you seem to be equally fortunate."</p>

<p>"Wall, I s'pose I am," was the hesitating answer, "the main trouble
being that we have been suffering for the last few days from a
dreadful scare; but then we hain't been injured in any way, thanks
be to the Lord for it all."</p>

<p>"Then you aren't alone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," interrupted the farmer; "that is, when I'm abroad."</p>

<p>The precise meaning of this was not clear to the listeners, but
Ned continued without noticing it:</p>

<p>"I did not see you in the battle, Mr. Perkins."</p>

<p>"No, thanks be to the Lord for it all, I was able to keep out
by running away, when the battle begun, or rather a little before.
I had hard work to get clear; thanks to the Lord, I managed to
do it."</p>

<p>"Where's your family?"</p>

<p>"Wall, now, thar's where I've ben specially favored again. You
know that there are three of us&mdash;myself, Mrs. Perkins, and Master
George Washington Perkins, aged four years, so I had my hands
full in looking after them; but the second Mrs. Perkins is a remarkable
woman, and possesses an exceedingly powerful mind&mdash;an exceedingly
powerful mind, beyond all question. I must give her the credit
for the able management of this enterprise, for she deserves more
credit than I. You know how brave a man I am by nature, and how
I have a natural hankering for gore. Wall, that yearning to be
killing some one made me furious to plunge head first into the
battle when it began raging down the valley, and I started seventeen
times&mdash;yes, seventeen times&mdash;to go in to do or die, I didn't care
which, but Mrs. Perkins had her eagle eye on me, and every time
I made a rush, she rushed also, and caught me by the coat-tails,
and nothing short of an earthquake could have persuaded her to
let go. Wall, to make that story short, she prevailed, and kept
me out of the struggle, thanks be to the Lord for all that."</p>

<p>"But how did you manage to keep clear of the Indians?"</p>

<p>"There it was her planning again. She called to mind a spot in
the woods not far away, where, when she was a sweet little girl,
she used to play hide-and-whoop with her playmates, and where
she was always able to secure a hiding that baffled the skill
of her young friends, and straightway it occurred to her that
there was the very spot in which to take refuge, and there we
went."</p>

<p>"Any trouble in getting there?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to speak of," replied the farmer, in his lofty way.
"Of course the Tories and Indians tried to head us off, but I
had a gun, and the strength of my good right arm, and more than
all that, I had Mrs. Perkins as my second in command, and where
was the use of any one trying to break such a combination as that?
We were bound to prevail, and we never allowed ourselves to be
turned aside by any trifles, and we reached the refuge in safety,
and there we are staying, and expect to stay till things quiet
down again."</p>

<p>"But how did you manage for food?" asked Jo, desirous of testing
the accuracy of the Mohawk's judgment when he declared that the
first gun fired had been discharged by a man in the situation
of Perkins while searching for something to eat.</p>

<p>"Wall," he said, in the old drawling style peculiar to men who
love to hear themselves talk, "when stealing becomes a matter
of necessity, it ain't stealing any longer, and I have been in
the habit of slipping out on the sly and fetching down some of
the stock that's roaming through the woods without knowing who
their master is&mdash;thanks be to the Lord for all that!"</p>

<p>"Was that you who fired off your gun a little while ago?"</p>

<p>"I've shot off my rifle twice within the last hour. The first
time was at a hog, and I missed him, for, somehow or other, the
rampaging of the Indians and Tories through the valley seems to
have upset everything, the dumb animals as well &mdash;Mrs. Perkins
is more nervous than usual&mdash;thanks be to the &mdash;I was about
to say that the dumb critters know that something is going on
round them that ain't right, and they are as wild as mad bulls,
which is why I come to miss hitting that porker."</p>

<p>So the rather lengthy reply of the loquacious farmer proved that
Lena-Wingo was accurate in his opinion as to the reason the former
shot was fired.</p>

<p>"Was your second shot sent after another wild animal?"</p>

<p>At this question, Mr. Perkins looked meaningly at the Mohawk
and laughed:</p>

<p>"Wall, no; I don't suppose it would be safe to call Red Jack
a wild animal, but when I caught sight of him, or, rather, heard
him moving through the woods, I set him down as one of the Iroquois,
who have made Mrs. Perkins so nervous&mdash;thanks to the &mdash;I
say I set him down as one of those villains, and I blazed away."</p>

<p>"Did you hit him?"</p>

<p>"Wall, no&mdash;thanks to the Lord for it all&mdash;for, to tell the truth,
I didn't try, for I don't like to pick off a man in that style
without giving him a little notice, though I'm sorry to say I've
had to do it more than once. I just meant to give him a scare,
and I guess I made out to do that&mdash;didn't I, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Not much scare&mdash;don't shoot straight," was the rather uncomplimentary
reply of the Mohawk.</p>

<p>"Wall, we won't quarrel over that, Jack, for I'm mighty glad
I didn't hurt you. I would have felt very bad if I had shot such
a good fellow as you."</p>

<p>"Do you know whether there are any more Indians in this neighborhood?"</p>

<p>"I don't think there are any nearer than Forty Fort; they have
been rampaging up and down the valley for the past two or three
days, but they must have found that I'm around, for they are a
good deal more afraid than they were. But then there was quite
a lot of them through these parts to-day."</p>

<p>"Did you see Colonel Butler and his party?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," answered the settler, as though he pitied the ignorance
of his listeners, "I have had them under my eye ever since they
came out of the fort. Do you know that I came very near capturing
them all?"</p>

<p>Ned replied that they had no knowledge of such a startling fact.</p>

<p>"The minute I laid eyes onto them, I made up my mind they were
up to some deviltry, and I watched them&mdash;watched them as a cat
does a mouse. I heard that old rascal say something about his
looking for the purtiest lady in the valley, and I knew at once
he meant Mrs. Perkins, and that roused my dander, as you may guess,
and I swore I would go for him. I was so mad that I was determined
to snatch the whole party, and I laid my plans to do it."</p>

<p>"And how was it that you failed?"</p>

<p>"By the merest slip in the world. My plan was to follow close
behind, dogging their footsteps, and picking them off one by one
till they were all gone. It would have been a big thing, wouldn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly it would; and why did you fail?"</p>

<p>"Wall, I'm just telling you; it didn't take me long to fix up
all my scheme, and I had just drawn a bead on Colonel Butler,
having Captain Bagley in a line, too, so that I was sure to fetch
them both, when I happened to remember that my gun wasn't loaded.
I drew off to load it with an extra large charge, when something
must have told them of the danger that threatened, for they moved
off and before I could find them again it was so dark that they
couldn't be found, and so by that narrow chance they all escaped."</p>
