               The Bellman looked uffish, and wrinkled his brow.<br />
               "If only you'd spoken before!<br />
               It's excessively awkward to mention it now,<br />
               With the Snark, so to speak, at the door!
          <P>
               "We should all of us grieve, as you well may believe,<br />
               If you never were met with again--<br />
               But surely, my man, when the voyage began,<br />
               You might have suggested it then?
          <P>
               "It's excessively awkward to mention it now--<br />
               As I think I've already remarked."<br />
               And the man they called "Hi!" replied, with a sigh,<br />
               "I informed you the day we embarked.
          <P>
               "You may charge me with murder--or want of sense--<br />
               (We are all of us weak at times):<br />
               But the slightest approach to a false pretense<br />
               Was never among my crimes!
          <P>
               "I said it in Hebrew--I said it in Dutch--<br />
               I said it in German and Greek:<br />
               But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much)<br />
               That English is what you speak!"
          <P>
               "'Tis a pitiful tale," said the Bellman, whose face<br />
               Had grown longer at every word:<br />
               "But, now that you've stated the whole of your case,<br />
               More debate would be simply absurd.
          <P>
               "The rest of my speech" (he explained to his men)<br />
               "You shall hear when I've leisure to speak it.<br />
               But the Snark is at hand, let me tell you again!<br />
               'Tis your glorious duty to seek it!
          <P>
               "To seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care;<br />
               To pursue it with forks and hope;<br />
               To threaten its life with a railway-share;<br />
               To charm it with smiles and soap!
          <P>
               "For the Snark's a peculiar creature, that won't<br />
               Be caught in a commonplace way.<br />
               Do all that you know, and try all that you don't:<br />
               Not a chance must be wasted to-day!
          <P>
               "For England expects--I forbear to proceed:<br />
               'Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite:<br />
               And you'd best be unpacking the things that you need<br />
               To rig yourselves out for the fight."
          <P>
               Then the Banker endorsed a blank check (which he crossed),<br />
               And changed his loose silver for notes.<br />
               The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair,<br />
               And shook the dust out of his coats.
          <P>
               The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade--<br />
               Each working the grindstone in turn:<br />
               But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed<br />
               No interest in the concern:
          <P>
               Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride,<br />
               And vainly proceeded to cite<br />
               A number of cases, in which making laces<br />
               Had been proved an infringement of right.
          <P>
               The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned<br />
               A novel arrangement of bows:<br />
               While the Billiard-marker with quivering hand<br />
               Was chalking the tip of his nose.
          <P>
               But the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine,<br />
               With yellow kid gloves and a ruff--<br />
               Said he felt it exactly like going to dine,<br />
               Which the Bellman declared was all "stuff."
          <P>
               "Introduce me, now there's a good fellow," he said,<br />
               "If we happen to meet it together!"<br />
               And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head,<br />
               Said "That must depend on the weather."
          <P>
               The Beaver went simply galumphing about,<br />
               At seeing the Butcher so shy:<br />
               And even the Baker, though stupid and stout,<br />
               Made an effort to wink with one eye.
          <P>
               "Be a man!" said the Bellman in wrath, as he heard<br />
               The Butcher beginning to sob.<br />
               "Should we meet with a Jubjub, that desperate bird,<br />
               We shall need all our strength for the job!"
