<P>The kettle began it! Don't tell me what Mrs.
Peerybingle said. I know better. Mrs. Peery-
bingle may leave it on record to the end of time
that she couldn't say which of them began it; but,
I say the kettle did. I ought to know, I hope! The
kettle began it, full five minutes by the little waxy-
faced Dutch clock in the corner, before the Cricket
uttered a chirp.
<P>As if the clock hadn't finished striking, and the
convulsive little Haymaker at the top of it, jerking
away right and left with a scythe in front of a
Moorish Palace, hadn't mowed down half an acre of
imaginary grass before the Cricket joined in at all!
<P>Why, I am not naturally positive. Every one
knows that. I wouldn't set my own opinion against
the opinion of Mrs. Peerybingle, unless I were quite
sure, on any account whatever. Nothing should in-
duce me. But, this is a question of fact. And the
fact is, that the kettle began it, at least five minutes
before the Cricket gave any sign of being in exist-
ence. Contradict me, and I'll say ten.
<P>Let me narrate exactly how it happened. I should
have proceeded to do so in my very first word, but
for this plain consideration -- if I am to tell a story
I must begin at the beginning; and how is it pos-
sible to begin at the beginning, without beginning
at the kettle?
<P>It appeared as if there were a sort of match, or
trial of skill, you must understand, between the kettle
and the Cricket. And this is what led to it, and
how it came about.
<P>Mrs. Peerybingle, going out into the raw twilight,
and clicking over the wet stones in a pair of pattens
that worked innumerable rough impressions of the
first proposition in Euclid all about the yard -- Mrs,
Peerybingle filled the kettle at the water-butt. Pres-
ently returning, less the pattens (and a good deal
less, for they were tall and Mrs. Peerybingle was
but short), she set the kettle on the fire. In doing
which she lost her temper, or mislaid it for an instant;
for, the water being uncomfortably cold, and in that
slippy, slushy, sleety sort of state wherein it seems
to penetrate through every kind of substance, pat-
ten rings included -- had laid hold of Mrs. Peery-
bingle's toes, and even splashed her legs. And when
we rather plume ourselves (with reason too) upon
oue legs, and keep ourselves particularly neat in point
of stockings, we find this for the moment, hard to
bear.
<P>Besides, the kettle was aggravating and obstinate.
It wouldn't allow itself to be adjusted on the top
bar; it wouldn't hear of accommodating itself kindly
to the knobs of coal; it would lean forward with a
drunken air, and dribble, a very Idiot of a kettle,
on the hearth. It was quarrelsome, and hissed and
spluttered morosely at the fire. To sum up all, the
lid, resisting Mrs. Peerybingle's fingers, first of all
turned topsy-turvy, and then, with an ingenious per-
tinacity deserving of a better cause, dived sideways
in -- down to the very bottom of the kettle. And
the hull of the Royal George has never made half the
monstrous resistance to coming out of the water,
which the lid of that kettle employed against Mrs.
Peerybingle, before she got it up again.
<P>It looked sullen and pig-headed enough; even then;
carrying its handle with an air of defiance. and cock-
ing its spout pertly and mockingly at Mrs. Peery-
bingle, as if it said, 'I won't boil. Nothing shall
induce me!'
<P>But Mrs. Peerybingle, with restored good humour,
dusted her chubby little hands aginst each other,
and sat down before the kettle, laughing. Mean-
time, the jolly blaze uprose and fell, flashing and
gleaming on the little Haymaker at the top of the
Dutch clock, until one might have thought he stood
stock still before the Moorish Palace, and nothing
was in motion but the flame.
<P> He was on the move, however; and had his spasms,
two to the second, all right and regular. But, his
sufferings when the clock was going to strike, were
frightful to behold; and, when a Cuckoo looked out
of a trap-door in the Palace, and gave note six times,
it shook him, each time, like a spectral voice or like
a something wiry, plucking at his legs.
<P>It was not until a violent commotion and a whir-
ing noise among the weights and ropes below him
had quite subsided, that this terrified Haymaker be-
came himself again. Nor was he startled without
reason; for these rattling, bony skeletons of clocks
are very disconcerting in their operation, and I won-
der very much how any set of men, but most of all
how Dutchmen, can have had a liking to invent them.
There is a popular belief that Dutchmen love broad
cases and much clothing for their own lower selves;
and they might know better than to leave their clocks
so very lank and unprotected, surely.
<P> Now.it was, you observe, that the kettle began to
spend the evening. Now it was, that the kettle, grow-
ing mellow and musical, began to have irrepressible
gurglings in its throat, and to indulge in short vocal
snorts, which it checked in the bud, as if it hadn't
quite made up its mind yet, to be good company.
Now it was, that after two or three such vain at-
tempts to stifle its convivial sentiments, it threw off
all moroseness, all reserve, and burst into a stream of
song so cosy and hilarious, as never maudlin night-
ingale yet formed the least idea of.
 So plain too! Bless you, you might have under-
stood it like a book -- better than some books you and
I could name, perhaps. With its warm breath gush-
ing forth in a light cloud which merrily and grace-
fully ascended a few feet, then hung about the chim-
ney-corner as its own domestic Heaven, it trolled its
song with that strong energy of cheerfulness, that its
iron body hummed and stirred upon the fire; and the
lid itself, the recently rebellious lid -- such is the influ-
ence of a bright example -- performed a sort of jig, and
clattered like a deaf and dumb young cymbal that
had never known the use of its twin brother.
<P>That this song of the kettle's was a song of invita-
tion and welcome to somebody out of doors: to some-
body at that moment coming on, towards the snug
small home and the crisp fire: there is no doubt what-
ever Mrs. Peerybingle knew it, perfectly, as she sat
musing before the hearth. It's a dark night, sang
the kettle, and the rotten leaves are lying by the way;
and above, all is mist and darkness, and below, all
is mire and clay; and there's only one relief in all
the sad and murky air; and I don't know that it is
one, for it's nothing but a glare; of deep and angry
crimson, where the sun and wind together, set a brand
upon the clouds for being guilty of such weather;
and the wildest open country is a long dull streak
of black; and there's hoar-frost on the finger-post
and thaw upon the track; and the ice it isn't water,
and the water isn't free; and you couldn't say that
anything is what it ought to be; but he's coming,
coming, coming! --
<P>And here, if you like, the Cricket DID chime in!
with a Chirrup, Chirrup, Chirrup of such magnitude,
by way of chorus; with a voice so astoundingly dis-
proportionate to its size, as compared with the kettle;
(size! you couldn't see it!) that if it had then and
there burst itself like an overcharged gun, if it had
fallen a victim on the spot, and chirruped its little
body into fifty pieces, it would have seemed a natural
and inevitable consequence, for which it had ex-
pressly laboured.
<P>The kettle had had the last of its solo performance.
It persevered with undiminished ardour; but the
Cricket took first fiddle and kept it. Good Heaven,
how it chirped! Its shrill, sharp, piercing voice re-
sounded through the house, and seemed to twinkle in
the outer darkness like a star. There was an inde-
scribable little trill and tremble in it, at its loudest,
which suggested its being carried off its legs, and
made to leap again, by its own intense enthusiasm.
Yet they went very well together, the Cricket and
the kettle. The burden of the song was still the
same; and louder, louder, louder still, they sang it
in their emulation.
<P>The fair little listener -- for fair she was, and
young: though something of what is called the dump-
ling shape; but I don't myself object to that -- lighted
a candle, glanced at the Haymaker on the top of the
clock, who was getting in a pretty average crop of
minutes; and looked out of the window, where she
saw nothing, owing to the darkness, but her own face
imaged in the glass. And my opinion is (and so
would yours have been), that she might have looked
a long way, and seen nothing half so agreeable.
When she came back, and sat down in her former
seat, the Cricket and the kettle were still keeping it
up, with a perfect fury of competition. The kettle's
weak side clearly being, that he didn't know when
he was beat.
<P>There was all the excitement of a race about it.
Chirp, chirp, chirp! Cricket a mile ahead. Hum,
hum, hum -- m -- m! Kettle making play in the dis-
tance, like a great top. Chirp, chirp, chirp! Cricket
round the corner. Hum, hum, hum -- m -- m! Ket-
tle sticking to him in his own way; no idea of giv-
ing in. Chirp, chirp, chirp! Cricket fresher than
ever. Hum, hum, hum -- m -- m! Kettle slow and
steady. Chirp, chirp, chirp! Cricket going in to fin-
ish him. Hum, hum, hum -- m -- m! Kettle not to be
finished. Until at last they got so jumbled together,
in the hurry-skurry, helter-skelter, of the match, that
whether the kettle chirped and the Cricket hummed,
or the Cricket chirped and the kettled hummed, or
they both chirped and both hummed, it would have
taken a clearer head than yours or mine to have de-
cided with anything like certainty. But, of this,
there is no doubt: that, the kettle and the Cricket, at
one and the same moment, and by some power of
amalgamation best known to themselves, sent, each,
his fireside song of comfort streaming into a ray of the
candle that shone out through the wondow, and a long
way down the lane. And this light, bursting on a
certain person who, on the instant, approached to-
wards it through the gloom, expressed the whole thing
to him, literally in a twinkling, and cried, 'Welcome
home, old fellow! Welcome home, my boy!'
<P>This end attained, the kettle, being dead beat,
boiled over, and was taken off the fire. Mrs. Peery-
bingle then went running to the door, where, what
with the wheels of a cart, the tramp of a horse, the
voice of a man, the tearing in and out of an excited
dog, and the surprising and mysterious appearance
of a baby, there was soon the very What's-his-name
to pay.
<P>Where the baby came from, or how Mrs. Peery-
bingle got hold of it in that flash of time, I don't
know. But a live baby there was, in Mrs. Peery-
bingle's arms; and a pretty tolerable amount of pride
she seemed to have in it, when she was drawn gently
to the fire, by a sturdy figure of a man, much taller
and much older than herself, who had to stoop a long
way down, to kiss her. But she was worth the
trouble. Six foot six, with the lumbago, might have
done it.
<P>'Oh goodness, John!' said' Mrs. P. 'What a state
you are in with the weather!'
<P>He was something the worse for it, undeniably.
The thick mist hung in clots upon his eyelashes like
candied thaw; and between the fog and fire together,
there were rainbows in his very whiskers.
<P>'Why, you see, Dot,' John made answer, slowly,
as he unrolled a shawl from about his throat; and
warmed his hands; 'It -- it an't exactly summer
weather. So, no wonder.'
<P>'I wish you wouldn't call me Dot, John. I don't
like it,' said Mrs. Peerybingle: pouting in a way that
clearly showed she did like it, very much.
<P>'Why what else are you?' returned John, looking
down upon her with a smile, and giving her waist as
light a squeeze as his huge hand and arm could give.
'A dot and' -- here he glanced at the baby -- 'a dot and
carry -- I won't say it, for fear I should spoil it; but
I was very near a joke. I don't know as ever I was
nearer.'
<P>He was often near to something or other very
clever, by his own account: this lumbering, slow hon-
est John; this John so heavy, but so light of spirit;
so rough upon the surface, but so gentle at the core;
so dull without, so quick within, so stolid, but so good!
Oh Mother Nature, give thy children the true poetry
of heart that hid itself in this poor Carrier's breast --
he was but a Carrier by the way -- and we can bear
to have them talking prose, and leading lives of prose;
and bear to bless thee for their company!
<P>It was pleasant to see Dot, with her little figure,
and her baby in her arms: a very doll of a baby:
glancing with a coquettish thoughtfulness at the fire,
and inclining her delicate little head just enough on
one side to let it rest in an odd, half-natural, half-
affected, wholly nestling and agreeable manner, on
the great rugged figure of the Carrier. It was pleas-
ant to see him, with his tender awkwardness, endeav-
ouring to adapt his rude support to her slight need,
and make his burly middle-age a leaning-staff not
inappropriate to her blooming youth. It was pleasant
to observe how Tilly Slowboy, waiting in the back-
ground for the baby, took especial cognizance (though
in her earliest teens) of this grouping; and stood with
her mouth and eyes wide open, and her head thrust
forward, taking it in as if it were air. Nor was it
less agreeable to observe how John the Carrier, refer-
ence being made by Dot to the aforesaid baby, checked
his hand when on the point of touching the infant,
as if he thought he might crack it; and bending down,
surveyed it from a safe distance, with a kind of
puzzled pride, such as an amiable mastiff might be
supposed to show, if he found himself, one day, the
father of a young canary.
<P>'An't he beautiful, John? Don't he look precious
in his sleep?'
<P>'Very precious,' said John. 'Very much so. He
generally is asleep, an't he?'
<P>'Lor, John! Good gracious no!'
<P>'Oh,' said John, pondering. 'I thought his eyes was
generally shut. Halloa!'
<P>'Goodness, John, how you startle one!'
<P>'It an't right for him to turn 'em up in that way!'
said the astonished Carrier, 'is it? See how he's wink-
ing with both of 'em at once! And look at his mouth!
Why he's gasping like a gold and silver fish!'
<P>'You don't deserve to be a father, you don't,' said
Dot, with all the dignity of an experienced matron.
'But how should you know what little complaints
children are troubled with, John! You wouldn't so
much as know their names, you stupid fellow.' And
when she had turned the baby over on her left arm,
and had slapped its back as a restorative, she pinched
her husband's ear, laughing.
<P>'No,' said John, pulling off his outer coat. 'It's
very true, Dot. I don't know much about it. I only
know that I've been fighting pretty stiffly with the
wind to-night. It's been blowing north-east, straight
into the cart, the whole way home.'
<P>'Poor old man, so it has!' cried Mrs. Peerybingle,
instantly becoming very active. 'Here! Take the
precious darling, Tilly, while I make myself of some
use. Bless it, I could smother it with kissing it, I
could! Hie then, good dog! Hie Boxer, boy! Only
let me make the tea first, John; and then I'll help
you with the parcels, like a busy bee. "How doth
the little" -- and all the rest of it, you know, John.
Did you ever learn "how doth the little," when you
went to school, John?'
<P>'Not to quite know it,' John returned. 'I was very
near it once. But I should only have spoilt it, I
dare say.'
<P>'Ha ha,' laughed Dot. She had the blithest little
laugh you ever heard. 'What a dear old darling of
a dunce you are, John, to be sure!'
<P>Not at all disputing this position, John went out
to see that the boy with the lantern, which had been
dancing to and fro before the door and window,
like a Will of the Wisp, took due care of the horse;
who was fatter than you would quite believe, if I
gave you his measure, and so old that his birthday
was lost in the mists of antiquity. Boxer, feeling
that his attentions were due to the family in general,
and must be impartially distributed, dashed in and
out with bewildering inconstancy; now, describing a
circle of short barks round the horse, where he was
being rubbed down at the stable-door; now, feigning
to make savage rushes at his mistress, and facetiously
bringing himself to sudden stops; now, eliciting a
shriek from Tilly Slowboy, in the low nursing-chair
near the fire, by the unexpected application of his
moist nose to her countenance; now, exhibiting an
obtrusive interest in the baby; now, going round and
round upon the hearth, and lying down as if he had
established himself for the night; now, getting up
again, and. taking that nothing of a fag-end of a
tail of his, out into the weather, as if he had just
remembered an appointment, and was off, at a round
trot, to keep it.
<P>'There! There's the teapot, ready on the hob!' said
Dot; as briskly busy as a child at play at keeping
house. 'And there's the cold knuckle of ham; and
there's the butter; and there's the crusty loaf, and
all! Here's the clothes-basket for the small parcels,
John, if you've got any there -- where are you, John?
Don't let the dear child fall under the grate, Tilly,
whatever you do!'
<P>It may be noted of Miss Slowboy, in spite of her
rejecting the caution with some vivacity, that she had
a rare and surprising talent for getting this baby
into difficulties: and had several times imperilled its
short life, in a quiet way peculiarly her own. She
was of a spare and straight shape, this young lady,
insomuch that her garments appeared to be in con-
stant danger of sliding off those sharp pegs, her shoul-
ders, on which they were loosely hung. Her costume
was remarkable for the partial development, on all
possible occasions, of some flannel vestment of a
singular structure; also for affording glimpses, in
the region of the back, of a corset, or pair of stays,
in colour a dead-green. ,Being always in a state of
gaping admiration at everything, and absorbed, be-
sides, in the perpetual contemplation of her mistress's
perfections and the baby's, Miss Slowboy, in her little
errors of judgment, may be said to have done equal
honour to her head and to her heart; and though these
did less honour to the baby's head, which they were
the occasional means of bringing into contact with
deal doors, dressers, stair-rails, bedposts, and other
foreign substances, still they were the honest results
of Tilly Slowboy's constant astonishment at finding
herself so kindly treated, and installed in such a com-
fortable home. For, the maternal and paternal Slow-
boy were alike unknown to Fame, and Tilly had been
bred by public charity, a foundling; which word,
though only differing from fondling by one vowel's
length, is very different in meaning, and expresses
quite another thing.
<P>To have seen little Mrs. Peerybingle come back
with her husband, tugging at the clothes-basket, and
making the most strenuous exertions to do nothing
at all (for he carried it), would have amused you
almost as much as it amused him. It may have enter-
tained the Cricket too, for anything I know; but,
certainly, it now began to chirp again vehemently.
<P>'Heyday!' said John, in his slow way. 'It's mer-
rier than ever, to-night, I think.'
<P>'And it's sure to bring us good fortune, John! It
always has done so. To have a Cricket on the
Hearth, is the luckiest thing in all the world!'
<P>John looked at her as if he had very nearly got
the thought into his head, that she was his Cricket
in chief, and he quite agreed with her. But, it was
probably one of his narrow escapes, for he said
nothing.
<P>'The first time I heard its cheerful little note, John,
was on that night when you brought me home --
when you brought me to my new home here; its
little mistress. Nearly a year ago. You recollect,
John?'
<P>O yes. John remembered. I should think so!
<P>'Its chirp was such a welcome to me! It seemed
so full of promise and encouragement. It seemed
to say, you would be kind and gentle with me, and
would not expect (I had a fear of that, John, then)
to find an old head on the shoulders of your foolish
little wife.'
<P>John thoughtfully patted one of the shoulders, and
then the head, as though he would have said No, no;
he had had no such expectation; he had been quite
content to take them as they were. And really he
had reason. They were very comely.
<P>'It spoke the truth, John, when it seemed to say
so; for you have ever been, I am sure, the best, the
most considerate, the most affectionate of husbands
to me. This has been a happy home, John; and I
love the Cricket for its sake!'
<P>'Why so do I then,' said the Carrier. 'So do I,
Dot.'
<P>'I love it for the many times I have heard it, and
the many thoughts its harmless music has given me.
Sometimes, in the twilight, when I have felt a little
solitary and down-hearted, John -- before baby was
here to keep me company and make the house gay
-- when I have thought how lonely you would be if
I should die; how lonely I should be if I could know
that you had lost me, dear; its Chirp, Chirp, Chirp
upon the hearth, has seemed to tell me of another
little voice, so sweet, so very dear to me, before whose
coming sound my trouble vanished like a dream.
And when I used to fear -- I did fear once, John.
I was very young you know -- that ours might prove
to be an ill-assorted marriage, I being such a child,
and you more like my guardian than my husband;
and that you might not, however hard you tried, be
able to learn to love me, as you hoped and prayed
you might; its Chirp, Chirp, Chirp has cheered me
up again, and filled me with new trust and confidence.
I was thinking of these things to-night, dear, when
I sat expecting you; and I love the Cricket for their
sake!'
<P>'And so do I,' repeated John. 'But Dot? I hope
and pray that I might learn to love you? How you
talk! I had learnt that, long before I brought you
here, to be the Cricket's little mistress, Dot!'
<P>She laid her hand, an instant. on his arm, and
looked up at him with an agitated face, as if she
would have told him something. Next moment she
was down upon her knees before the basket, speaking
in a sprightly voice, and busy with the parcels.
<P>'There are not many of them to-night, John, but
I saw some goods behind the cart, just now; and
though they give more trouble, perhaps, still they
pay as well; so we have no reason to grumble, have
we? Besides, you have been delivering, I dare say,
as you came along?'
<P>'Oh yes,' John said. 'A good many.'
<P>'Why what's this round box? Heart alive, John,
it's a wedding-cake!'
<P>'Leave a woman alone to find out that,' said John,
admiringly. 'Now a man would never have thought
of it. Whereas, it's my belief that if you was to
pack a wedding-cake up in a tea-chest, or a turn-up
bedstead, or a pickled salmon keg, or any unlikely
thing, a woman would be sure to find it out directly.
Yes; I called for it at the pastry-cook's.'
<P>'And it weighs I don't know what -- whole hundred-
weights!' cried Dot, making a great demonstration of
trying to lift it. 'Whose is it, John? Where is it
going?'
<P>'Read the writing on the other side,' said John.
<P>'Why, John! My Goodness, John!'
<P>'Ah! who'd have thought it!' John returned.
<P>'You never mean to say,' pursued Dot, sitting on
the floor and shaking her head at him, 'that it's Gruff
and Tackleton the toy-maker!'
<P>John nodded.
<P>Mrs. Peerybingle nodded also, fifty times at least.
Not in assent -- in dumb and pitying amazement;
screwing up her lips the while with all their little
force (they were never made for screwing up; I am
clear of that), and looking the good Carrier through
and through, in her abstraction. Miss Slowboy, in
the mean time, who had a mechanical power of repro-
ducing scraps of current conversation for the delecta-
tion of the baby, with all the sense struck out of
them, and all the nouns changed into the plural num-
ber, inquired aloud of that young creature, Was it
Gruffs and Tackletons the toymakers then, and
Would it call at Pastry-cooks for wedding-cakes, and
Did its mothers know the boxes when its fathers
brought them homes; and so on.
<P>'And that is really to come about!' said Dot. 'Why
she and I were girls at school together, John.'
<P>He might have been thinking of her, or nearly
thinking of her, perhaps, as she was in that same
school time. He looked upon her with a thoughtful
pleasure, but he made no answer.
<P>'And he's as old! As unlike her! -- Why, how many
years older than you, is Gruff and Tackleton, John?'
<P>'How many more cups of tea shall I drink to-night
at one sitting, than Gruff and Tackleton ever took
in four, I wonder!' replied John, good-humoredly,
as he drew a chair to the round table, and began
at the cold ham. 'As to eating, I eat but little; but,
that little I enjoy, Dot.'
<P>Even this, his usual sentiment at meal times, one
of his innocent delusions (for his appetite was al-
ways obstinate, and flatly contradicted him), awoke
no smile in the face of his little wife, who stood among
the parcels, pushing the cake-box slowly from her
with her foot, and never once looked, though her
eyes were cast down too, upon the dainty shoe she
generally was so mindful of. Absorbed in thought,
she stood there, heedless alike of the tea and John
(although he called to her, and rapped the table with
his knife to startle her), until he rose and touched
her on the arm; when she looked at him for a mo-
ment, and hurried to her place behind the teaboard,
laughing at her negligence. But, not as she had
laughed before. The manner and the music were
quite changed.
<P>The Cricket, too, had stopped. Somehow the room
was not so cheerful as it had been. Nothing like it.
<P>'So, these are all the parcels, are they, John?' she
said, breaking a long silence, which the honest Car-
rier had devoted to the practical illustration of one
part of his favourite sentiment -- certainly enjoying
what he ate, if it couldn't be admitted that he ate
but little. 'So these are all the parcels; are they,
John?'
<P>'That's all,' said John. 'Why -- no -- I --' laying
down his knife and fork, and taking a long breath.
'I declare -- I've clean forgotten the old gentleman!'
<P>'The old gentleman?'
<P>'In the cart,' said John. 'He was asleep, among
the straw, the last time I saw him. I've very nearly
remembered him, twice, since I came in; but, he went
out of my head again. Holloa! Yahip there! Rouse
up! That's my hearty!'
<P>John said these latter words outside the door,
whither he had hurried with the candle in his hand.
<P>Miss Slowboy, conscious of some mysterious ref-
erence to The Old Gentleman, and connecting in her
mystified imagination certain associations of a re-
ligious nature with the phrase, was so disturbed, that
hastily rising from the low chair by the fire to seek
protection near the skirts of her mistress, and coming
into contact as she crossed the doorway with an an-
cient Stranger, she instinctively made a charge or
butt at him with the only offensive instrument within
her reach. This instrument happening to be the baby,
great commotion and alarm ensued, which the sagacity
of Boxer rather tended to increase; for, that good dog,
more thoughtful than its master, had, it seemed, been
watching the old gentleman in his sleep, lest he should
walk off with a few young poplar trees that were tied
up behind the cart, and he still attended on him very
closely, worrying his gaiters in fact, and making dead
sets at the buttons.
<P>'You're such an undeniable good sleeper, sir,' said
John, when tranquillity was restored; in the mean
time the old gentleman had stood, bareheaded and
motionless, in the centre of the room; 'that I have
half a mind to ask you where the other six are --
only that would be a joke, and I know I should spoil
it. Very near though,' murmured the Carrier, with
a chuckle; 'very near!'
<P>The Stranger, who had long white hair, good fea-
tures, singularly bold and well defined for an old
man, and dark, bright, penetrating eyes, looked round
with a smile, and saluted the Carrier's wife by gravely
inclining his head.
<P>His garb was very quaint and odd -- a long, long
way behind the time. Its hue was brown, all over.
In his hand he held a great brown club or walking-
stick; and striking this upon the floor, it fell asunder,
and became a chair. On which he sat down, quite
composedly.
<P>'There!' said the Carrier, turning to his wife.
'That's the way I found him, sitting by the roadside!
Upright as a milestone. And almost as deaf.'
<P>'Sitting in the open air, John!'
<P>'In the open air,' replied the Carrier, 'just at dusk.
"Carriage Paid," he said; and gave me eighteen-
pence. Then he got in. And there he is.'
<P>'He's going, John, I think!'
<P>Not at all. He was only going to speak.
<P>'If you please, I was to be left till called for,' said
the Stranger, mildly 'Don't mind me.'
<P>With that, he took a pair of spectacles from one
of his large pockets, and a book from another, and
leisurely began to read. Making no more of Boxer
than if he had been a house lamb!
<P>The Carrier and his wife exchanged a look of per-
plexity. The Stranger raised his head; and glancing
from the latter to the former, said,
<P>'Your daughter, my good friend?'
<P>'Wife,' returned John.
<P>'Niece?' said the Stranger.
<P>'Wife,' roared John.
<P>'Indeed?' observed the Stranger. 'Surely? Very
young!'
<P>He quietly turned over, and resumed his reading.
But, before he could have read two lines he again
interrupted himself to say:
<P>'Baby, yours?'
<P>John gave him a gigantic nod; equivalent to an
answer in the affirmative, delivered through a speak-
ing trumpet.
<P>'Girl?'
<P>'Bo-o-oy!' roared John.
<P>'Also very young, eh?'
<P>Mrs. Peerybingle instantly struck in. 'Two months
and three da-ays! Vaccinated just six weeks ago-o!
Took very fine-ly! Considered, by the doctor, a re-
markably beautiful chi-ild! Equal to the general run
of children at five months o-old! Takes notice, in a
way quite won-der-ful! May seem impossible to
you, but feels his legs al-ready!'
<P>Here the breathless little mother, who had been
shrieking these short sentences into the old man's ear.
until her pretty face was crimsoned, held up the Baby
before him as a stubborn and triumphant fact; while
Tilly Slowboy, with a melodious cry of 'Ketcher,
Ketcher' -- which sounded like some unknown words,
adapted to a popular Sneeze -- performed some cow-
like gambols round that all-unconscious Innocent.
<P>'Hark! He's called for, sure enough,' said John.
'There's somebody at the door. Open it, Tilly.'
<P>Before she could reach it, however, it was opened
from without, being a primitive sort of door, with
a latch, that any one could lift if he chose -- and a
good many people did choose, for all kinds of neigh-
bours liked to have a cheerful word or two with the
Carrier, though he was no great talker himself. Be-
ing opened, it gave admission to a little, meagre,
thoughtful, dingy-faced man, who seemed to have
made himself a great-coat from the sack-cloth cover-
ing of some old box; for, when he turned to shut
the door, and keep the weather out, he disclosed
upon the back of that garment, the inscription G & T
in large black capitals. Also the word GLASS in
bold characters.
<P>'Good-evening John!' said the little man. 'Good-
evening Mum. Good-evening Tilly. Good-evening
Unbeknown! How's Baby Mum? Boxer's pretty
well I hope?'
<P>'All thriving, Caleb,' replied Dot. 'I am sure you
need only look at the dear child, for one, to know
that.'
<P>'And I'm sure I need only look at you for another,'
said Caleb.
<P>He didn't look at her though; he had a wander-
ing and thoughtful eye which seemed to be always
projecting itself into some other time and place, no
matter what he said; a description which will equally
apply to his voice.
<P>'Or at John for another,' said Caleb. 'Or at Tilly,
as far as that goes. Or certainly at Boxer.'
<P>'Busy just now, Caleb?' asked the Carrier.
<P>'Why, pretty well, John,' he returned, with the dis-
traught air of a man who was casting about for the
Philosopher's stone, at least. 'Pretty much so.
There's rather a run on Noah's Arks at present. I
could have wished to improve upon the Family, but I
don't see how it's to be done at the price. It would
be a satisfaction to one's mind, to make it clearer
which was Shems and Hams, and which was Wives.
Flies an't on that scale neither, as compared with ele-
phants you know! Ah! well! Have you got any-
thing in the parcel line for me, John?'
<P>The Carrier put his hand into a pocket of the coat
he had taken off; and brought out, carefully pre-
served in moss and paper, a tiny flower-pot.
<P>'There it is!' he said, adjusting it with great care.
'Not so much as a leaf damaged. Full of buds!'
<P>Caleb's dull eye brightened, as he took it and
thanked him.
<P>'Dear, Caleb,' said the Carrier. 'Very dear at this
season.'
<P>'Never mind that. It would be cheap to me, what-
ever it cost,' returned the little man. 'Anything else,
John?'
<P>'A small box,' replied the Carrier. 'Here you are!'
<P>' "For Caleb Plummer," ' said the little man, spell-
ing out the direction. ' "With Cash." With Cash,
John. I don't think it's for me.'
<P>'With Care,' returned the Carrier, looking over his
shoulder. 'Where do you make out cash?'
<P>'Oh! To be sure!' said Caleb. 'It's all right.
With care! Yes, yes; that's mine. It might have
been with cash, indeed, if my dear Boy in the Golden
South Americas had lived, John. You loved him
like a son; didn't you? You needn't say did. I
know, of course. "Caleb Plummer. With care."
Yes, yes, it's all right. It's a box of dolls' eyes for
my daughter's work. I wish it was her own sight in
a box, John.'
<P>'I wish it was, or could be!' cried the Carrier.
<P>'Thank 'ee,' said the little man. 'You speak very
hearty. To think that she should never see the Dolls
-- and them a-staring at her, so bold, all day long!
That's where it cuts. What's the damage, John?'
<P>'I'll damage you,' said John, 'if you inquire. Dot!
Very near?
<P>'Well! it's like you to say so,' observed the little
man. 'It's your kind way. Let me see. I think
that's all.'
<P>'I think not,' said the Carrier. 'Try again.'
<P>'Something for our Governor, eh?' said Caleb, after
pondering a little while. 'To be sure. That's what
I came for; but my head's so running on them Arks
and things! He hasn't been here, has he?'
<P>'Not he,' returned the Carrier. 'He's too busy,
courting.'
<P>'He's coming round though,' said Caleb; 'for he
told me to keep on the near side of the road going
home, and it was ten to one he'd take me up. I had
better go, by the bye. -- You couldn't have the good-
ness to let me pinch Boxer's tail, Mum, for half a
moment, could you?'
<P>'Why, Caleb! what a question!'
<P>'Oh never mind, Mum,' said the little man. 'He
mightn't like it perhaps. There's a small order just
come in, for barking dogs; and I should wish to go as
close to Natur' as I could, for sixpence. That's all.
Never mind, Mum.'
<P>It happened opportunely, that Boxer, without re-
ceiving the proposed stimulus, began to bark with
great zeal. But, as this implied the approach of some
new visitor, Caleb, postponing his study from the
life to a more convenient season, shouldered the
round box, and took a hurried leave. He might have
spared himself the trouble, for he met the visitor upon
the threshold.
<P>'Oh! You are here, are you? Wait a bit. I'll
take you home. John Peerybingle, my service to
you. More of my service to your pretty wife. Hand-
somer every day! Better too, if possible! And
younger,' mused the speaker, in a low voice; 'that's
the Devil of it!'
<P>'I should be astonished at your paying compli-
ments, Mr. Tackleton,' said Dot, not with the best
grace in the world; 'but for your condition.'
 'You know all about it then?'
<P>'I have got myself to believe it, somehow,' said Dot.
<P>'After a hard struggle, I suppose?'
<P>'Very.'
<P>Tackleton the Toy-merchant, pretty generally
known as Gruff and Tackleton -- for that was the
firm, though Gruff had been bought out long ago;
only leaving his name, and as some said his nature,
according to its Dictionary meaning, in the business
-- Tackleton the Toy-merchant, was a man whose
vocation had been quite misunderstood by his Parents
and Guardians. If they had made him a Money
Lender, or a sharp Attorney, or a Sheriff's Officer,
or a Broker, he might have sown his discontented oats
in his youth, and, after having had the full run of
himself in ill-natured transactions, might have turned
out amiable, at last, for the sake of a little freshness
and novelty. But, cramped and chafing in the peace-
able pursuit of toy-making, he was a domestic Ogre,
who had been living on children all his life, and was
their implacable enemy. He despised all toys;
wouldn't have bought one for the world; delighted,
in his malice, to insinuate grim expressions into the
faces of brown-paper farmers who drove pigs to
market, bellmen who advertised lost lawyers' con-
sciences, moveable old ladies who darned stockings or
carved pies; and other like samples of his stock-in-
trade. In appalling masks; hideous, hair, red-eyed
Jacks in Boxes; Vampire Kites; demoniacal Tum-
blers who wouldn't lie down, and were perpetually
flying forward, to stare infants out of countenance;
his soul perfectly revelled. They were his only relief,
and safety-valve. He was great in such inventions.
Anything suggestive of a Pony-nightmare, was de-
licious to him. He had even lost money (and he
took to that toy very kindly) by getting up Goblin
slides for magic-lanterns, whereon the Powers of
Darkness were depicted as a sort of supernatural
shell-fish, with human faces. In intensifying the por-
traiture of Giants, he had sunk quite a little capital;
and, though no painter himself, he could indicate, for
the instruction of his artists, with a piece of chalk,
a certain furtive leer for the countenances of those
monsters, which was safe to destroy the peace of mind
of any young gentleman between the ages of six and
eleven, for the whole Christmas or Midsummer
Vacation.
<P>What he was in toys, he was (as most men are) in
other things. You may easily suppose, therefore,
that within the great green cape, which reached down
to the calves of his legs, there was buttoned up to the
chin an uncommonly pleasant fellow; and that he was
about as choice a spirit, and as agreeable a compan-
ion, as ever stood in a pair of bull-headed looking
boots with mahogany-coloured tops.
<P>Still, Tackleton, the toy-merchant, was going to be
married. In spite of all this, he was going to be
married. And to a young wife too, a beautiful young
wife.
<P>He didn't look much like a bridegroom, as he stood
in the Carrier's kitchen, with a twist in his dry face,
and a screw in his body, and his hat jerked over the
bridge of his nose, and his hands tucked down into the
bottoms of his pockets, and his whole sarcastic ill-
conditioned self peering out of one little corner of one
little eye, like the concentrated essence of any number
of ravens. But, a Bridegroom he designed to be.
<P>'In three days' time. Next Thursday. The last
day of the first month in the year. That's my wed-
ding day,' said Tackleton.
<P>Did I mention that he had always one eye wide
open, and one eye nearly shut; and that the one eye
nearly shut, was always the expressive eye? I don t
think I did.
<P>'That's my wedding-day!' said Tackleton, rattling
his money.
<P>'Why, it's our wedding-day too,' exclaimed the
Carrier.
<P>'Ha ha!' laughed Tackleton. 'Odd! You're just
such another couple. Just!'
<P>The indignation of Dot at this presumptuous asser-
tion is not to be described. What next? His imagina-
tion would compass the possibility of just such an-
other Baby, perhaps. The man was mad.
<P>'I say! A word with you,' murmured Tackleton,
nudging the Carrier with his elbow, and taking him
a little apart. 'You'll come to the wedding? We're
in the same boat, you know.'
<P>'How in the same boat?' inquired the Carrier.
<P>'A little disparity, you know'; said Tackleton, with
another nudge. 'Come and spend an evening with
us, beforehand.'
<P>'Why?' demanded John, astonished at this pressing
hospitality.
<P>'Why?' returned the other. 'That's a new way
of receiving an invitation. Why, for pleasure --
sociability, you know, and all that!'
<P>'I thought you were never sociable,' said John, in
his plain way.
<P>'Tchah! It's of no use to be anything but free
with you I see,' said Tackleton. 'Why, then, the
truth is you have a -- what tea-drinking people call a
sort of a comfortable appearance together, you and
your wife. We know better, you know. but --'
<P>'No, we don't know better,' interposed John. 'What
are you talking about?'
<P>'Well! We don't know better, then,' said Tackle-
ton. 'We'll agree that we don't. As you like; what
does it matter? I was going to say, as you have that
sort of appearance, your company will produce a
favourable effect on Mrs. Tackleton that will be.
And, though I don't think your good lady's very
friendly to me, in this matter, still she can't help her-
self from falling into my views, for there's a com-
pactness and cosiness of appearance about her that
always tells, even in an indifferent case. You'll say
you'll come?'
<P>'We have arranged to keep our Wedding-Day (as
far as that goes) at home,' said John. 'We have
made the promise to ourselves these six months. We
think, you see, that home --'
<P>'Bah! what's home?' cried Tackleton. 'Four walls
and a ceiling! (why don't you kill that Cricket! I
would! I always do. I hate their noise). There
are four walls and a ceiling at my house. Come to
me!'
<P>'You kill your Crickets, eh?' said John.
<P>'Scrunch 'em, sir,' returned the other, setting his
heel heavily on the floor. 'You'll say you'll come?
It's as much your interest as mine, you know, that the
women should persuade each other that they're quiet
and contented and couldn't be better off. I know
their way. Whatever one woman says, another
woman is determined to clinch, always. There's that
spirit of emulation among 'em, sir, that if your wife
says to my wife, "I'm the happiest woman in the
world, and mine's the best husband in the world, and
I dote on him," my wife will say the same to yours,
or more, and half believe it.'
<P>'Do you mean to say she don't, then?' asked the
Carrier.
<P>'Don't!' cried Tackleton, with a short, sharp laugh.
'Don't what?'
The Carrier had some faint idea of adding, 'dote
upon you.' But, happening to meet the half-closed
eye, as it twinkled upon him over the turned-up collar
of the cape, which was within an ace of poking it out,
he felt it such an unlikely part and parcel of anything
to be doted on, that he substituted, 'that she don't
believe it?'
<P>'Ah you dog! You're joking,' said Tackleton.
<P>But the Carrier, though slow to understand the full
drift of his meaning, eyed him in such a serious man-
ner, that he was obliged to be a little more explana-
tory.
<P>'I have the humour,' said Tackleton: holding up the
fingers of his left hand, and tapping the forefinger,
to imply 'there I am, Tackleton to wit': 'I have the
humour, sir, to marry a young wife, and a pretty
wife': here he rapped his little finger, to express the
Bride; not sparingly, but sharply; with a sense of
power. 'I'm able to gratify that humour and I do.
It's my whim. But -- now look there!'
<P>He pointed to where Dot was sitting, thoughtfully,
before the fire; leaning her dimpled chin upon her
hand, and watching the bright blaze. The Carrier
looked at her, and then at him, and then at her, and
then at him again.
<P>'She honours and obeys, no doubt, you know,' said
Tackleton; 'and that, as I am not a man of sentiment,
is quite enough for me. But do you think there's
anything more in it?'
<P>'I think,' observed the Carrier, 'that I should chuck
any man out of window, who said there wasn't.'
<P>'Exactly so,' returned the other with an unusual
alacrity of assent. 'To be sure! Doubtless you
would. Of course. I'm certain of it. Good-night.
Pleasant dreams!'
<P>The Carrier was puzzled, and made uncomfortable
and uncertaln, in spite of himself. He couldn't help
showing it, in his manner.
<P>'Good-night, my dear friend!' said Tackleton, com-
passionately. 'I'm off. We're exactly alike, in
reality, I see. You won't give us to-morrow evening?
Well! Next day you go out visiting, I know. I'll
meet you there, and bring my wife that is to be
It'll do her good. You re agreeable? Thank 'ee.
What's that!'
<P>It was a loud cry from the Carrier's wife. a loud
sharp, sudden cry, that made the room ring, like
glass vessel. She had risen from her seat, and stood
like one transfixed by terror and surprise. The
Stranger had advanced towards the fire to warm him-
selft and stood within a short stride of her chair. But
quite still.
<P>'Dot!' cried the Carrier. 'Mary! Darling! What's
the matter?'
<P>They were all about her in a moment. Caleb, who
had been dozing on the cake-box, in the first imper-
fect recovery of his suspended presence of mind, seized
Miss Slowboy by the hair of her head, but immediately
apologised.
<P>'Mary!' exclaimed the Carrier, supporting her in
his arms. 'Are you ill! What is it? Tell me, dear!'
<P>She only answered by beating her hands together
and falling into a wild fit of laughter. Then, sink-
ing from his grasp upon the ground, she covered her
face with her apron, and wept bitterly. And then
she laughed again, and then she cried again, and then
she said how cold it was, and suffered him to lead her
to the fire, where she sat down as before. The old
man standing, as before, quite still
<P>'I'm better, John,' she said. 'I'm quite well now
-- I --'
<P>'John!' But John was on the other side of her,
Why turn her face towards the strange old gentle-
man, as if addressing him! Was her brain wander-
ing?
<P>'Only a fancy, John dear -- a kind of shock -- a
something coming suddenly before my eyes -- I don't
know what it was. It's quite gone, quite gone.'
<P>'I'm glad it's gone,' muttered Tackleton, turning
the expressive eye all round the room. 'I wonder
where it's gone, and what it was. Humph. Caleb,
come here! Who's that with the grey hair?'
<P>'I don't know, sir,' returned Caleb in a whisper.
<P>'Never see him before, in all my life. A beautiful
figure for a nut-cracker; quite a new model. With a
screw-jaw opening down into his waistcoat, he'd be
lovely.'
<P>'Not ugly enough,' said Tackleton.
<P>'Or for a firebox, either,' observed Caleb, in deep
contemplation, 'what a model! Unscrew his head to
put the matches in; turn him heels up'ards for the
light; and what a firebox for a gentleman's mantel-
shelf, just as he stands!'
<P>'Not half ugly enough,' said Tackleton. 'Nothing
in him at all! Come! Bring that box! All right
now, I hope!'
<P>'Oh quite gone! Quite gone!' said the little woman,
waving him hurriedly away. 'Good-night!
<P>'Good-night,' said Tackleton. 'Good-night, John
Peerybingle! Take care how you carry that box,
Caleb. Let it fall, and I'll murder you! Dark as
pitch, and weather worse than ever, eh? Good-
night!'
<P>So, with another sharp look round the room, he went
out at the door; followed by Caleb with the wedding-
cake on his head.
<P>The Carrier had been so much astounded by his
little wife, and so busily engaged in soothing and
tending her, that he had scarcely been conscious of
the Stranger's presence, until now, when he again
stood there, their only guest.
<P>'He don't belong to them, you see,' said John. 'I
must give him a hint to go.'
<P>'I beg your pardon, friend,' said the old gentleman
advancing to him; 'the more so, as I fear your wife
has not been well; but the Attendant whom my in-
firmity,' he touched his ears and shook his head, 'ren-
ders almost indispensable, not having arrived, I fear
there must be some mistake. The bad night which
made the shelter of your comfortable cart (may I
never have a worse!) so acceptable, is still as bad as
ever. Would you, in your kindness, suffer me to rent
a bed here?'
<P>'Yes, yes,' cried Dot. 'Yes! Certainly!'
<P>'Oh!' said the Carrier, surprised by the rapidity of
this consent. 'Well! I don't object; but still I'm not
quite sure that --'
<P>'Hush!' she interrupted. 'Dear Johnl'
<P>'Why, he's stone deaf,' urged John.
<P>'I know he is, but -- Yes, sir, certainly. Yes! cer-
tainly! I'll make him up a bed, directly, John.'
<P> As she hurried off to do it, the flutter of her spirits,
and the agitation of her manner, were so strange, that
the Carrier stood looking after her, quite confounded.
<P>'Did its mothers make it up a Bed then!' cried
Miss Slowboy to the Baby; 'and did its hair grow
brown and curly, when its caps was lifted off, and
frighten it, a precious Pets, a-sitting by the fires!'
<P>With that unaccountable attraction of the mind to
trifles, which is often incidental to a state of doubt
and confusion, the Carrier, as he walked slowly to
and fro, found himself mentally repeating even these
absurd words, many times. So many times that he
got them by heart, and was still conning them over
and over, like a lesson, when Tilly, after administer-
ing as much friction to the little bald head with her
hand as she thought wholesome (according to the
practice of nurses), had once more tied the Baby's
cap on.
<P>'And frighten it a precious pets, a-sitting by the
fires. What frightened Dot, I wonder!' mused the
Carrier, pacing to and fro.
<P>He scouted, from his heart, the insinuations of the
Toy-merchant, and yet they filled him with a vague,
indefinite uneasiness. For, Tackleton was quick and
sly; and he had that painful sense, himself of being a
man of slow perception, that a broken hint was al-
ways worrying to him. He certainly had no inten-
tion in his mind of linking anything that Tackleton
had said, with the unusual conduct of his wife, but
the two subjects of reflection came into his mind to-
gether, and he could not keep them asunder.
<P>The bed was soon made ready; and the visitor, de-
clining all refreshment but a cup of tea, retired.
Then, Dot quite well again, she said, quite well
again -- arranged the great chair in the chimney-
corner for her husband; filled his pipe and gave it
him; and took her usual little stool beside him on the
hearth.
<P>She always would sit on that little stool. I think
she must have had a kind of notion that it was a
coaxing, wheedling, little stool.
<P>She was, out and out, the very best filler of a pipe,
I should say, in the four quarters of the globe. To
see her put that chubby little finger in the bowl, and
then blow down the pipe to clear the tube, and, when
she had done so, affect to think that there was really
something in the tube, and blow a dozen times, and
hold it to her eye like a telescope, with a most provok-
ing twist in her capital little face, as she looked down
it, was quite a brilliant thing. As to the tobacco, she
was perfect mistress of the subject; and her lighting
of the pipe, with a wisp of paper, when the Carrier
had it in his mouth -- going so very near his nose, and
yet not scorching it -- was Art, high Art.
<P>And the Cricket and the kettle, turning up again,
acknowledged it! The bright fire, blazing up again,
acknowledged it! The little Mower on the clock in
his unheeded work acknowledged it. The Carrier, in
his smoothing forehead and expanding face, acknowl-
edged it, the readiest of all.
<P>And as he soberly and thoughtfully puffed at his
old pipe, and as the Dutch clock ticked, and as the
red fire gleamed, and as the Cricket chirped; that
Genius of his Hearth and Home (for such the Cricket
was) came out, in fairy shape, into the room, and
summoned many forms of Home about him. Dots
of all ages, and all sizes, filled the chamber. Dots
who were merry children, running on before him
gathering flowers, in the fields; coy Dots, half shrink-
ing from, half yielding to, the pleading of his own
rough image; newly-married Dots, alighting at the
door, and taking wondering possession of the house-
hold keys; motherly Little Dots, attended by fictitious
Slowboys, bearing babies to be christened; matronly
Dots, still young and blooming, watching Dots of
daughters, as they danced at rustic balls; fat Dots,
encircled and beset by troops of rosy grand-children;
withered Dots, who leaned on sticks, and tottered as
they crept along. Old Carriers too, appeared, with
blind old Boxers lying at their feet; and newer carts
with younger drivers ('Peerybingle Brothers' on the
tilt'); and sick old Carriers, tended by the gentlest
hands; and graves of dead and gone old Carriers,
green in the churchyard. And as the Cricket showed
him all these things -- he saw them plainly, though his
eyes were fixed upon the fire -- the Carrier's heart grew
light and happy, and he thanked his Household Gods
with all his might, and cared no more for Gruff and
Tackleton than you do.            
<P>But, what was that young figure of a man, which
the same Fairy Cricket set so near Her stool, and
which remained there, singly and alone? Why did it
linger still, so near her, with its arm upon the chim-
ney-piece, ever repeating 'Married! and not to me!'
<P>O Dot! O failing Dot! There is no place for it
in all your husband's visions; why has its shadow
fallen on his hearth!
