<p>For hours the fog showed no signs of lifting. The three remained
seated near the carcass of the polar bear, discussing the one
question that had already been discussed so long, until there
really seemed nothing left to say.</p>

<p>Not long after the collision between the icebergs a singular
thing took place. It was evident that the two were acted upon
each by a diverse current, but the preponderating bulk of the
greater was not disturbed by the smaller. The latter, however,
as if anxious to break away from its master, began slowly grinding
along the face, until, after awhile, it swung clear and gradually
drifted out of sight in the misty vapor.</p>

<p>"She will know better than to tackle one bigger than herself,"
was the remark of Rob Carrol, "which reminds me that if there
should happen to be a bigger iceberg than this floating around
loose we sha'n't be in any danger."</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"Because being so big it will be under the influence of the same
current as this and going in the same direction, so there won't
be much chance of our coming together."</p>

<p>"Unless the big one should overtake us," suggested Fred.</p>

<p>"Even then it would find it hard to run over us, so there isn't
much to be feared from that; what I do dread is that we shall
strike some shallow place in the sea that will make this thing
turn a somersault."</p>

<p>"It would be a terrible thing," said Fred, unable to drive it
from his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Is it possible for the berg to strike something like that and
stick fast, without shifting its centre of gravity?"</p>

<p>The question was addressed to Jack Cosgrove, but he did not attempt
to answer until the last clause was explained to him.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes; that has been seen many times. A berg will ground itself
just like a boat, and stay for days and weeks until a storm breaks
it up, or it shakes itself loose. I don't believe if we do strike
bottom again that there's much danger of capsizing."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell us that before?" asked Rob, reprovingly;
"we might have been saved all this worry."</p>

<p>"It's only guesswork, any way, so you may as well keep on worrying,
for, somehow or other, you seem to enjoy it."</p>

<p>"I think there is a thinning of the fog," remarked Fred, some
time later.</p>

<p>"A little, but not much; it's growing colder, too; we'll run
into keen weather afore reaching the Pole."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if it came pretty soon. Hello!" added Rob,
looking at his watch; "it is past noon."</p>

<p>"Do you want your dinner?" asked Jack, with a grin.</p>

<p>Both lads gave an expression of disgust, the elder replying:</p>

<p>"I can stand it for twenty-four hours before hankering for another
slice of bear steak, and I shouldn't be surprised if Fred feels
the same way."</p>

<p>"You are correct, my friend."</p>

<p>"Ah, you chaps can get used to anything!" was the self-complacent
remark of the sailor, as he assumed a comfortable attitude on
the ice.</p>

<p>While the boys talked thus, Jack was carefully noting the weather.
He saw with pleasure that the fog was steadily clearing, and that,
before night, the atmosphere was likely to be wholly clear again.
That fact might avail them nothing, but it was a thousand-fold
better than the mist, in which they might drift within a hundred
feet of friends without either party suspecting it.</p>

<p>From what has been told, it will be understood that no one of
the three built any hope of a rescue by the "Nautilus." The violent
gale had driven her miles away, and a search on her part for this
particular iceberg would be like the hunt of one exploring party
for another that had been lost years before.</p>

<p>But it was not to be supposed that Captain McAlpine would quietly
dismiss all care concerning the lads from his mind. One of them
was a son of a leading director of the Hudson Bay Company, and
the other was a favorite of the son and his father. For the skipper
to return to London at the end of several months with the report
that he had left them on an iceberg in the Greenland Sea would
be likely to subject him to unpleasant consequences.</p>

<p>The most natural course of the captain, as it seemed to the sailor,
after making the best search he could, was to put into some of
the towns along the coast, and organize several parties to go
out in search of them.</p>

<p>"He is no fool," thought Jack, as he turned the subject over
in his mind without speaking, "and he must have took the bearings
of the ship and the berg as I did. He won't be able to keep track
of us, but he will know better than to sail exactly in the wrong
direction, as most other folks would do. Yes," he remarked to
his friends, as he looked off over the sea, "the weather is clearing
and the fog will be all gone before night."</p>

<p>This was gratifying information, though neither youth could tell
precisely why it should give them special ground for hope.</p>

<p>You will understand one of the trials of the boys when adrift
on the iceberg. The latter was moving slowly, and, though in a
direction different from the surface current, yet it was barely
perceptible. No other objects were in sight than the berg itself,
which gave the impression to the passengers that it was motionless
on the vasty deep. You know how much harder it is to wait in a
train at a station than it is in one in motion. If they could
have realized that the berg was actually moving, no matter in
what direction, the relief would have been great. As it was, they
felt as though they were simply waiting, waiting for they knew
not what.</p>

<p>The afternoon was more than two-thirds gone when the last vestige
of the fog vanished. The sun shone out, and, looking off to sea,
the power of the eye itself was the only limit to the vision.</p>

<p>Without explaining the meaning of his action, Jack Cosgrove made
his way down the path to the place where they had spent most of
the preceding night, and climbing upon a slight elevation, stood
for a full minute looking fixedly off over the sea. He shaded
his eyes carefully with his hand, and stood as motionless as a
stone statue.</p>

<p>"He either sees or expects to see something," said Rob, who,
like his companion, was watching him with much interest.</p>

<p>"He is so accustomed to the ocean that his eyes are better than
ours," said Fred.</p>

<p>"I can't make out anything."</p>

<p>Suddenly Jack struck his thigh with his right hand and wheeled
about, showing a face aglow with feeling.</p>

<p>"By the great horned spoon, I knowed it."</p>

<p>"What have you discovered, Jack?"</p>

<p>"You chaps just come this way," he said, crooking his stubby
forefinger toward them, "and put yourself alongside of me and
take the sharpest squint you can right over yonder."</p>

<p>Doing as directed, they finally agreed, after some hard looking,
that they saw what seemed to be a long, low, white cloud in the
horizon.</p>

<p>"That's Greenland," was the astonishing reply; "I don't know
what part, but it's solid airth with snow on it."</p>

<p>This was interesting, indeed, though it was still difficult to
understand what special hope the fact held out to them.</p>

<p>It seemed to grow slightly more distinct as the afternoon advanced.
Since it was hardly to be supposed that the iceberg was approaching
land, this was undoubtedly caused by the contour of the coast.</p>

<p>When night began closing in the party fired their guns repeatedly,
thinking possibly the reports might attract notice from some of
the natives fishing in the vicinity. The chance, however, was
so exceedingly slight that they made preparations for spending
the night as before&mdash;that is, huddled together against the projecting
ice. There was hardly a breath of air stirring, though the temperature
continued falling.</p>

<p>"I hear it!" exclaimed Fred, starting to his feet, within five
minutes after seating themselves as described.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked the amazed Rob; "are you crazy?"</p>

<p>"Listen!"</p>

<p>They did so. There was no mistake about it. They caught the sound
of a vigorously moved paddle, and, had any doubt remained, it
was dissipated by the loud call in a peculiar voice, and with
an odd accent:</p>

<p>"Holloa! holloa! holloa!"</p>
