<p>It seemed to take Rusty Wren's wife a long time to recover from the
fright that Jasper Jay had given her. He had amused himself by
dropping cherries upon the roof of her house. But the trick had not
amused the Wren family in the least.
</p>
<p>Even after Johnnie Green had driven the blue-coated rascal away
from the dooryard Mrs. Rusty Wren was all aflutter. She jumped at
the slightest noise. And she was so nervous that Rusty soon saw
that it was a great effort for her to go abroad for food for their
hungry family.
</p><p>"You must stay right here at home and rest," he urged her. "I'll
find enough for the children to eat--and for you too," he said
manfully.
</p><p>And really there was nothing else that his wife could do; for her
nerves were in a frightful state.
</p><p>So Rusty Wren took up his task cheerfully. He found it no easy one,
either. Feeding six growing youngsters had kept both their parents
working every minute all day long, because the children were always
clamoring for more food. And now they seemed half starved, for they
had had nothing to eat all the time that Jasper Jay had kept Rusty
and his wife hiding in their house.
</p><p>Rusty Wren, however, was not one to complain, no matter what
happened. And every day from dawn till dark he hurried out of the
house to find some toothsome insect, and bring it home to drop it
into somebody's yawning mouth.
</p><p>Indeed, he was so busy feeding his family that he scarcely had a
chance to eat anything himself. So he grew quite thin. And though
he still sang as merrily as ever, his wife noticed the change that
had come over him.
</p><p>Naturally, that made her worry. And since worrying was bad for her
nerves, she began to grow worse instead of better.
</p><p>"I don't know what's going to become of us," she said at last. "As
the children grow bigger they need more to eat. And I can see
plainly that you're never going to be able to provide enough for
them."
</p><p>"Oh! they'll soon be old enough to leave home and catch their own
insects," Rusty told her hopefully. "And until that time comes I'll
manage somehow, even if I have to work after dark."
</p><p>But that plan did not suit his wife at all.
</p><p>"I shouldn't care to stay alone in the house at night with six
small children," she said. "That will never do."
</p><p>"I have it!" Rusty cried suddenly. "I'll get somebody to help me!"
</p><p>Well, his wife didn't think much of that plan, either.
</p><p>"I don't like the idea of any strange bird coming into my house,"
she objected. "And you know yourself that you've always felt the
same way about strangers."
</p><p>"I know----" he replied--"but this is different. I'll find a brisk
young fellow somewhere. And after a day or two you won't mind his
being here. He'll seem just like one of the family."
</p><p>It took a good deal of urging before Mrs. Rusty consented. But at
last she said she was willing to give the plan a trial, though she
felt sure it was bound to cause trouble, somehow.
</p><p>So that is how Rusty Wren came to hang a sign outside his door,
which said:
</p><p><strong>BOY WANTED</strong>
