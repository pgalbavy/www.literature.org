<p>Perhaps the winter was longer than usual; or perhaps Dickie Deer Mouse
ate too freely of his hidden store of good things. At any rate, Dickie's
hoard slowly grew smaller and smaller. And long before the day came when
he bolted the last seed that remained in the hollow fence-rail he had
begun to wonder where he should find more food.
</p>
<p>While he had been sleeping the birds that stayed in Pleasant Valley
during the winter had been feasting greedily upon the very kind of fare
that Dickie Deer Mouse needed. Jasper Jay and his noisy cronies had
taken good care that there shouldn't be a beechnut left. And when they
had eaten the last sweet nut they turned to such dried berries as still
clung to the withered stocks on which they had grown.
</p><p>No longer could Dickie Deer Mouse spend so much time asleep in his cozy
chamber. Instead, he had to wander far through the woods at night,
thankful to pick up a bit here and there as best he might.
</p><p>On those crisp, cold nights he had to scamper fast in order to keep
warm. And often, when dawn came, he crept home still hungry.
</p><p>At last Dickie's night runs lapped well over into the day. For his
search for food became more and more disappointing. And afterward he
often wondered what would have happened to him if he hadn't met Mr.
Pine Finch early one morning.
</p><p>Mr. Pine Finch was an odd fellow. He had a peculiar way of talking as if
he spoke through his nose. Though Dickie Deer Mouse had seen him before,
he had paid scant attention to Mr. Pine Finch. But when he caught sight
of him on a certain chilly morning there were so few birds stirring that
Dickie stopped short and watched Mr. Pine Finch, who was so busy in a
tree-top that he didn't know anybody else was near him.
</p><p>He was talking to himself. And as nearly as Dickie Deer Mouse could
tell, he was remarking--through his nose--that he was having a good
breakfast.
</p><p>That news made Dickie Deer Mouse prick up his big ears. A good breakfast
was something that he had not enjoyed for a long, long time.
</p><p>At first Dickie couldn't quite see what Mr. Pine Finch was about. It was
he, beyond a doubt. There could be no more mistaking his odd voice than
his plump, black-streaked back, with its splashes of yellow at the base
of his tail, and his yellow-edged wings. Dickie had a good view of Mr.
Pine-Finch's back, because its owner hung upside down from the tips of
the branches of the tree where Dickie spied him.
</p><p>To Dickie Deer Mouse the sight, at first, was somewhat of a puzzle. He
stood quite still, gazing upward in wonder. And then all at once he
discovered what Mr. Pine Finch was doing. Something struck Dickie Deer
Mouse lightly on his back--something that made him jump.
</p><p>He looked all around to see what had hit him. And there, on the snow
beside him, lay a bud off the tree above him.
</p><p>Then Dickie Deer Mouse understood what Mr. Pine Finch was about. He was
eating the buds that clung to the tips of the branches.
</p><p>Dickie Deer Mouse quickly ate that bud; and then he waited, watching
eagerly every move that Mr. Pine Finch made.
