<p>Everything he saw was distasteful to him. He hated the blue and
white, the intensity and definiteness, the hum and heat of the
south; the landscape seemed to him as hard and as romantic as
a cardboard background on the stage, and the mountain but a wooden
screen against a sheet painted blue. He walked fast in spite of
the heat of the sun.</p>

<p>Two roads led out of the town on the eastern side; one branched
off towards the Ambroses' villa, the other struck into the country,
eventually reaching a village on the plain, but many footpaths,
which had been stamped in the earth when it was wet, led off from
it, across great dry fields, to scattered farm-houses, and the
villas of rich natives. Hewet stepped off the road on to one of
these, in order to avoid the hardness and heat of the main road,
the dust of which was always being raised in small clouds by carts
and ramshackle flies which carried parties of festive peasants,
or turkeys swelling unevenly like a bundle of air balls beneath
a net, or the brass bedstead and black wooden boxes of some newly
wedded pair.</p>

<p>The exercise indeed served to clear away the superficial irritations
of the morning, but he remained miserable. It seemed proved beyond
a doubt that Rachel was indifferent to him, for she had scarcely
looked at him, and she had talked to Mr. Flushing with just the
same interest with which she talked to him. Finally, Hirst's odious
words flicked his mind like a whip, and he remembered that he
had left her talking to Hirst. She was at this moment talking
to him, and it might be true, as he said, that she was in love
with him. He went over all the evidence for this supposition&mdash;her
sudden interest in Hirst's writing, her way of quoting his opinions
respectfully, or with only half a laugh; her very nickname for
him, "the great Man," might have some serious meaning in it. Supposing
that there were an understanding between them, what would it mean
to him?</p>

<p>"Damn it all!" he demanded, "am I in love with her?" To that
he could only return himself one answer. He certainly was in love
with her, if he knew what love meant. Ever since he had first
seen her he had been interested and attracted, more and more interested
and attracted, until he was scarcely able to think of anything
except Rachel. But just as he was sliding into one of the long
feasts of meditation about them both, he checked himself by asking
whether he wanted to marry her? That was the real problem, for
these miseries and agonies could not be endured, and it was necessary
that he should make up his mind. He instantly decided that he
did not want to marry any one. Partly because he was irritated
by Rachel the idea of marriage irritated him. It immediately suggested
the picture of two people sitting alone over the fire; the man
was reading, the woman sewing. There was a second picture. He
saw a man jump up, say good-night, leave the company and hasten
away with the quiet secret look of one who is stealing to certain
happiness. Both these pictures were very unpleasant, and even
more so was a third picture, of husband and wife and friend; and
the married people glancing at each other as though they were
content to let something pass unquestioned, being themselves possessed
of the deeper truth. Other pictures&mdash;he was walking very fast
in his irritation, and they came before him without any conscious
effort, like pictures on a sheet&mdash;succeeded these. Here were the
worn husband and wife sitting with their children round them,
very patient, tolerant, and wise. But that too, was an unpleasant
picture. He tried all sorts of pictures, taking them from the
lives of friends of his, for he knew many different married couples;
but he saw them always, walled up in a warm firelit room. When,
on the other hand, he began to think of unmarried people, he saw
them active in an unlimited world; above all, standing on the
same ground as the rest, without shelter or advantage. All the
most individual and humane of his friends were bachelors and spinsters;
indeed he was surprised to find that the women he most admired
and knew best were unmarried women. Marriage seemed to be worse
for them than it was for men. Leaving these general pictures he
considered the people whom he had been observing lately at the
hotel. He had often revolved these questions in his mind, as he
watched Susan and Arthur, or Mr. and Mrs. Thornbury, or Mr. and
Mrs. Elliot. He had observed how the shy happiness and surprise
of the engaged couple had gradually been replaced by a comfortable,
tolerant state of mind, as if they had already done with the adventure
of intimacy and were taking up their parts. Susan used to pursue
Arthur about with a sweater, because he had one day let slip that
a brother of his had died of pneumonia. The sight amused him,
but was not pleasant if you substituted Terence and Rachel for
Arthur and Susan; and Arthur was far less eager to get you in
a corner and talk about flying and the mechanics of aeroplanes.
They would settle down. He then looked at the couples who had
been married for several years. It was true that Mrs. Thornbury
had a husband, and that for the most part she was wonderfully
successful in bringing him into the conversation, but one could
not imagine what they said to each other when they were alone.
There was the same difficulty with regard to the Elliots, except
that they probably bickered openly in private. They sometimes
bickered in public, though these disagreements were painfully
covered over by little insincerities on the part of the wife,
who was afraid of public opinion, because she was much stupider
than her husband, and had to make efforts to keep hold of him.
There could be no doubt, he decided, that it would have been far
better for the world if these couples had separated. Even the
Ambroses, whom he admired and respected profoundly&mdash;in spite of
all the love between them, was not their marriage too a compromise?
She gave way to him; she spoilt him; she arranged things for him;
she who was all truth to others was not true to her husband, was
not true to her friends if they came in conflict with her husband.
It was a strange and piteous flaw in her nature. Perhaps Rachel
had been right, then, when she said that night in the garden,
"We bring out what's worst in each other&mdash;we should live separate."</p>

<p>No Rachel had been utterly wrong! Every argument seemed to be
against undertaking the burden of marriage until he came to Rachel's
argument, which was manifestly absurd. From having been the pursued,
he turned and became the pursuer. Allowing the case against marriage
to lapse, he began to consider the peculiarities of character
which had led to her saying that. Had she meant it? Surely one
ought to know the character of the person with whom one might
spend all one's life; being a novelist, let him try to discover
what sort of person she was. When he was with her he could not
analyse her qualities, because he seemed to know them instinctively,
but when he was away from her it sometimes seemed to him that
he did not know her at all. She was young, but she was also old;
she had little self-confidence, and yet she was a good judge of
people. She was happy; but what made her happy? If they were alone
and the excitement had worn off, and they had to deal with the
ordinary facts of the day, what would happen? Casting his eye
upon his own character, two things appeared to him: that he was
very unpunctual, and that he disliked answering notes. As far
as he knew Rachel was inclined to be punctual, but he could not
remember that he had ever seen her with a pen in her hand. Let
him next imagine a dinner-party, say at the Crooms, and Wilson,
who had taken her down, talking about the state of the Liberal
party. She would say&mdash;of course she was absolutely ignorant of
politics. Nevertheless she was intelligent certainly, and honest
too. Her temper was uncertain&mdash;that he had noticed&mdash;and she was
not domestic, and she was not easy, and she was not quiet, or
beautiful, except in some dresses in some lights. But the great
gift she had was that she understood what was said to her; there
had never been any one like her for talking to. You could say
anything&mdash;you could say everything, and yet she was never servile.
Here he pulled himself up, for it seemed to him suddenly that
he knew less about her than about any one. All these thoughts
had occurred to him many times already; often had he tried to
argue and reason; and again he had reached the old state of doubt.
He did not know her, and he did not know what she felt, or whether
they could live together, or whether he wanted to marry her, and
yet he was in love with her.</p>

<p>Supposing he went to her and said (he slackened his pace and
began to speak aloud, as if he were speaking to Rachel):</p>

<p>"I worship you, but I loathe marriage, I hate its smugness, its
safety, its compromise, and the thought of you interfering in
my work, hindering me; what would you answer?"</p>

<p>He stopped, leant against the trunk of a tree, and gazed without
seeing them at some stones scattered on the bank of the dry river-bed.
He saw Rachel's face distinctly, the grey eyes, the hair, the
mouth; the face that could look so many things&mdash;plain, vacant,
almost insignificant, or wild, passionate, almost beautiful, yet
in his eyes was always the same because of the extraordinary freedom
with which she looked at him, and spoke as she felt. What would
she answer? What did she feel? Did she love him, or did she feel
nothing at all for him or for any other man, being, as she had
said that afternoon, free, like the wind or the sea?</p>

<p>"Oh, you're free!" he exclaimed, in exultation at the thought
of her, "and I'd keep you free. We'd be free together. We'd share
everything together. No happiness would be like ours. No lives
would compare with ours." He opened his arms wide as if to hold
her and the world in one embrace.</p>

<p>No longer able to consider marriage, or to weigh coolly what
her nature was, or how it would be if they lived together, he
dropped to the ground and sat absorbed in the thought of her,
and soon tormented by the desire to be in her presence again.</p>
