<p>As Lieutenant Fred Godfrey slowly raised his hand, as if it were
the signal for his friends to open fire, Jake Golcher collapsed.</p>

<p>Sinking down on the ground, as limp as a rag, he began begging
in the most pitiful tones for his life. Indeed, he groveled so
in the dirt that all the whites who looked upon him found their
feelings of hatred turning to disgust and pity.</p>

<p>Fred Godfrey was disappointed, and, stepping back a pace or two,
gazed on the miserable craven as he would upon a dog he had caught
stealing sheep, and which was then cringing at his feet.</p>

<p>Instead of waiting until the patriot had proven the truth of
his declaration, the renegade succumbed at once. It is hard to
kick the wretch who clasps your knees, and the lieutenant, who
was determined to rid the world of the man as soon as he had made
the declaration of his purposes respecting the captives, found
his resentment gone.</p>

<p>Mr. Brainerd, with an expression of scorn, sprang up from the
log and strode over to his son.</p>

<p>"In Heaven's name, let him go, Fred! Kick him out of sight, for
he hasn't the manhood to stand up and be shot like a man."</p>

<p>"Get up!" commanded Fred, catching him by the collar of his coat,
and jerking him to his feet: "I want to speak to you."</p>

<p>But Golcher was no sooner on his feet than he went to pieces
again, groaning and whining, and begging for that mercy that he
had so often denied to others.</p>

<p>Again the lieutenant yanked him to the upright position, and,
finding him collapsed as before, he cuffed his ears until they
tingled, shouting:</p>

<p>"Stand up, or you're a dead man!"</p>

<p>Finally, after wabbling about several minutes, Golcher summoned
enough strength to keep his feet, though in a shaky condition;
and finding he was not to be executed immediately, he managed
to grasp the situation.</p>

<p>"I was going to say &mdash;What do you mean, Gravity?"</p>

<p>This sudden question was caused by Gimp, the African, who, with
a chuckle, ran forward from the darkness that was beginning to
give away before the approach of day, and, jamming his head down
in the ground between Godfrey and Golcher, threw his huge feet
in the air, and began kicking with such recklessness that one
of them struck the lieutenant in the breast, nearly knocking him
over, while the other sent the Tory recoiling some distance.</p>

<p>"Can't help it!" exclaimed the happy African; "Jake Golcher's
s'prise party dat was to hab arriv, hab arroven, and me and Aunt
Peggy feels like standin' on our heads, and kickin' de limbs off
de trees."</p>

<p>Gravity used his feet rather too vigorously, and, swaying beyond
the point of nature's gravity, came down on his back with a resounding
thump; but he did not mind it, and leaping up, ran to the fallen
tree, where he sat down among his friends with the most extravagant
manifestations of joy.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that the six Senecas remained idle spectators
of this extraordinary scene. They were quick to comprehend what
it meant, and had they but maintained guard for the preceding
hour or two with their usual care the surprise could not have
been effected.</p>

<p>But, if any warriors could feel warranted in believing themselves
beyond danger of molestation from white men, it was those Indians
who took part in the Wyoming massacre.</p>

<p>When they grasped their guns and glanced around, their eyes encountered
a strange sight. It seemed as if a score of men had sprung from
the ground like so many visions of the night, and every one of
the Iroquois who used his eyes saw a gun leveled at him.</p>

<p>Had the scene occurred in Texas to-day, it would have been said
that Dick Durkee and his foresters "had the drop" on the Tory
and his Iroquois.</p>

<p>The latter saw they were caught, and they preserved a masterly
inactivity, pending the negotiations between the two parties.</p>

<p>There was a threatened complication that might turn the tables
again, and this time against the patriots. Some of the Senecas
were absent and were likely to come back. Gray Panther might be
among them, and in such an event the whites were likely to find
themselves between two fires.</p>

<p>"You poor fool," said Fred, when Golcher got into such shape
that he could understand what was said to him; "stand up like
a man, or I'll shoot you!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes, <em>I&mdash;</em>w-w-wi-ll; what do you want?"</p>

<p>"I want to make an agreement with you, and it's got to be done
mighty quick or not at all."</p>

<p>Thereupon the Tory straightened up wonderfully; but, happening
to look about him and to catch sight of the patriots standing,
as it seemed everywhere, with their guns leveled, he was seized
with another fit of shivering, and it was some time before he
could compose himself.</p>

<p>"You see," said the lieutenant, "that you are at my mercy, and
I'll treat you better than you deserve. I have but to give the
signal, as I told you a minute ago, and ten seconds from now there
wouldn't be a Tory or red Indian standing alive in this camp.
Every one of you is covered, but I'll agree to let you and them
withdraw, on condition that you do so without a second's delay."</p>

<p>"I'll do it &mdash;I'll do it!" gasped Golcher; "I'll give you
an escort to Stroudsburg, or anywhere you want to go."</p>

<p>"I rather think you won't," was the reply of Godfrey. "You have
escorted us altogether too much as it is. Thank Heaven, we are
in shape to take care of ourselves now."</p>

<p>"Wal, I'm ready to do whatever you want; fact is, leftenant,
I never meant one-half I said about you, and I ain't half as mean
as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not another word!" commanded Fred. "We'll attend to business
now."</p>
