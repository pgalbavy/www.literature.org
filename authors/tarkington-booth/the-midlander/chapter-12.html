<p>IN <em>THE </em>minds of Mrs. Savage’s neighbours across the
street and of the habitual passers-by, that broad plate-glass
window where it was her custom to sit for the last hour of every
afternoon had come to bear the significance of a glass over a
portrait. All long thoroughfares and many of even the shortest
have such windows; and the people who repeatedly pass that way
will often find the portrait window becoming a part, however slight,
of their own lives; but it will seldom be an enduring part, except
as a fugitive, pathetic memory. For a time the silent old face
is seen framed there every day, or it may be a pale and wistful
child looking out gravely upon the noisy world. Then abruptly
one day the window is only a window and no more a portrait; the
passer-by has a moment of wonder whenever he goes by, but presently
may have his faintly troubled question answered by a wreath on
the door; and afterwards the window that was once a portrait will
seem to him a little haunted.</p>

<p>Mrs. Savage’s window had been a portrait so long that even the
school children who went homeward that way in the autumn afternoons
noticed a vacancy behind the glass and missed her from the frame;
but new seasons came and passed, and no wreath appeared upon her
door. She had been so thoroughly alive for so many years that
the separation of herself from life could not be abrupt, even
if she wished it. She did not wish it she told Harlan, one rainy
night, as he sat beside her bed after bringing her the news that
she was a great-grandmother.</p>

<p>"I suppose it seems funny to you," she said. "You must wonder
why an old woman with nothing to live for would still want to
live. I suppose you think it’s because I just want to eat a little
more and to lie here listening to that!" With a hand now become
the very ghost of a hand, she gestured toward a window where the
parted curtains revealed black panes slushed with noisy water
by the strong west wind. "How you must wonder!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Harlan said, though she spoke the truth. "I don’t wonder
at all, grandma."</p>

<p>"Yes, you do! How could a young person help wondering about such
a thing? Year before last I could still go out for a little walk;
last year I could only go for a drive in the afternoons. After
that I could still get downstairs and sit by the window; then
I couldn’t even do that, and could only hobble around upstairs;—then
I couldn’t even get into another room without being helped. And
now for a month I’ve not been able to get out of bed—and I’ll
never be able to. No wonder you wonder I want to hang on!"</p>

<p>"But I don’t," he insisted. "I don’t, indeed."</p>

<p>"You do. What do you think I have to live for?"</p>

<p>"Why, partly for your family, grandma. We’re all devoted to you;
and besides you have your memories—I know you have many happy
memories."</p>

<p>She laughed feebly, but nevertheless with audible asperity, interrupting
his rather stumbling reassurances. "‘Happy memories!’ Young people
are always talking about ‘happy memories’; and they think old
people ‘live in their happy memories.’ I advise you not to look
forward to spending your old age in that way! There’s no such
thing, young man."</p>

<p>"No such thing as a happy memory?"</p>

<p>"Not when you’re as old as I am," she said. "You can only have
a happy memory of something when you can look forward to something
of the same kind happening again; but I can’t look forward to
anything. Yet I still want to hang on!"</p>

<p>Harlan laughed gently. "Then doesn’t that prove you do look forward
to something, grandma?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "It only proves I still have a little curiosity.
I’d like to live twenty years just to prove I’m right about how
this baby’s going to turn out."</p>

<p>The implication of her tone was grim with conviction—clearly
she spoke of a baby who could not turn out well—and Harlan was
amused by his own perception of a little drama: his grandmother,
clinging with difficulty to one extreme edge of life and prophesying
only black doom for this new person who had just crawled up into
life over the opposite extreme edge. "I’m sorry you feel so gloomy
about that baby, grandma. I’m rather pleased, myself, to be an
uncle, and so far I haven’t been worrying about his future. Don’t
you think there’s a chance for him?"</p>

<p>"Not with such a mother and father," the old lady promptly replied.
"Dan oughtn’t to have mixed with such a stock as that painted-up
little photograph girl."</p>

<p>Harlan protested a little; coming to Lena’s defense at least
in this detail. "But I understand that the particular foible of
the McMillan family is the magnificence of their stock, as you
call it, grandma. It seems they’re so proud of it they don’t think
of much else."</p>

<p>"Yes; that’s always a sign a stock’s petered out. When people
<em>put</em> a lot on what their folks used to do, it always means
they haven’t got gimp enough left to do anything themselves. The
minute I laid eyes on her picture I knew she came from a no-account
stock; and when your mother gave her that reception everybody
in town could tell right off what she was. Painted! <em>That</em>
tells the story!"</p>

<p>Again Harlan protested on behalf of his sister-in-law. "Oh, I
shouldn’t make too much of that, grandma. A little rouge now and
then——"</p>

<p>"‘A little rouge!’" the old lady echoed satirically. "She was
plastered with it! That doesn’t make any difference though, because
a woman that uses it at all is a bad woman and wants the men to
know it."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!"</p>

<p>"It’s so," the old lady cried as fiercely as her enfeebled voice
permitted. "It’s the truth, and you’ll live to see I’m right.
I don’t want you to forget then that I told you so. You remember
it, Harlan."</p>

<p>"Yes, grandma," he said placatively. "I will if——"</p>

<p>"I don’t want any ‘if’ about it. You remember what I’m telling
you! She’s bad!" Mrs. Savage spoke so vehemently that she had
to pause and let her quickened breathing become more regular;—then
she went on: "Look how she’s treated me. If she’d had the right
stuff in her, she’d have been grateful to me for giving her a
lesson. If she’d been just a foolish girl who’d made a mistake
and painted herself because she wanted to look healthier when
she met her new husband’s friends, why, she might have got a little
pettish with me for showing her it was a mistake the way I did,
but long before now she’d have forgiven me and thanked me for
doing it. Not she! That was the last time I set foot out of doors;
and has she ever come to see me? She’s never been near me! What’s
more, she’s done her best to keep Dan from ever coming here. When
he <em>has</em> come I know he hasn’t dared to tell her. Do you
deny it?"</p>

<p>Harlan shook his head. "No, I’m afraid I can’t, grandma."</p>

<p>"Do you know why she hates me so?" the old lady demanded. "It’s
because she’s bad, and she knows I know it. People never forgive
you for knowing they’re bad. And now she’s brought this baby into
the world to inherit her badness, and you sit there and wonder
I say the child’s bound to turn out wrong."</p>

<p>"Grandma!" the young man exclaimed, laughing. "I only wonder
you don’t take into account the fact that the baby is Dan’s, too.
Dan may be a rather foolish sort of person—in fact, I think he
is—but surely you’ve never thought him bad."</p>

<p>The old lady looked at her grandson querulously. "Don’t be so
superior, young man. That’s always been your trouble—you think
you’re the only perfect person in the world." And when he would
have protested, defending himself, she checked him sharply and
went on: "Never mind! I’m talking about other things now. The
trouble with Dan is that he’s never seen anything as it really
is and never will—not in all the days of his life! He was that
way even when he was a boy. I remember once you hurt his feelings
about some poor little brackets he was making with a little Jew
boy. He thought the brackets were perfect, and he thought the
little Jew boy was perfect, too. When you criticized them both
he got into such a spasm of crying he had to go home to bed."</p>

<p>"Yes," Harlan said, smiling faintly; "I remember. He was always
like that."</p>

<p>"Yes, and always will be. So he’ll think this child of his is
perfect, and it’ll never get any discipline. I’d like to live
twenty years just to see the wrack and ruin that’s going to be
made by these children born nowadays. Their parents got hardly
any discipline at all, and <em>they</em> won’t get <em>any</em>,
so they’ll never know how to respect anything at all. It only
takes a little common sense to see from the start how this child’ll
turn out. With no discipline or respect for anything, and with
such a mother from a petered-out stock, and a father that hasn’t
got a practical thought in his head, you can just as well as not
expect the child to be in the penitentiary by the time he’s twenty
years old!" Then, as Harlan laughed, the old lady uttered a faint
sound of laughter herself, not as if admitting that she exaggerated
anything, however, but grimly. "You’ll see!"</p>

<p>"You’re right about it this far," Harlan said. "Dan already thinks
the baby’s perfect."</p>

<p>"Happy, is he?"</p>

<p>"The usual triumphant young father. More triumphant than the
usual one, I should say. He went whooping over the house till
mother had to stop him and send him outdoors to keep him from
disturbing Lena."</p>

<p>"Yes; that’s like him," the old lady said. "How queer it is;
there are people who can always find something to whoop about,
no matter what happens. Your grandfather was like that when he
was a young man. Even when we were poor as Job’s turkey he’d burst
out cackling and laughing over anything at all. I used to just
look at him and wonder. Dan’s desperate for money, isn’t he?"</p>

<p>Harlan coughed, frowned, and then looked faintly amused. "Yes,
I should just about use the word ‘desperate.’ I think he is."</p>

<p>"He’ll not get any of mine!" Mrs. Savage said. "I’d not be very
apt to help him anyhow, after the way his wife’s treated me. He
wouldn’t listen to me; he <em>would</em> marry her, and he <em>would</em>
throw all he had away on that miserable old farm! Now I guess
he’s got nothing more to throw away."</p>

<p>"He’s got rather less than nothing now, grandma. The place wouldn’t
sell for enough to pay the mortgages, and he hasn’t been able
to meet the interest. Father managed to let him have a thousand
dollars two months ago, but it didn’t go very far. The truth is,
I think Dan’s begun to be a little out of his head over the thing;—he
had twenty teams hauling dirt while poor father’s thousand lasted.
Now he’s going to lose the place, and I’d think it a fortunate
misfortune if I believed he’d learn anything by it; but he won’t."</p>

<p>"No," Mrs. Savage agreed gloomily. "He’s like his grandfather,
but he hasn’t got a wife to watch over him as his grandfather
had. He’ll just be up to some new wastefulness."</p>

<p>"He already is," Harlan laughed. "You’re extraordinary, the way
you put your finger on things, grandma. He’s already up to a new
wastefulness."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Horseless carriages," Harlan informed her. "Automobiles;—‘<em>les
autos</em>,’ I believe the French call them now. Since old Shelby
wouldn’t run a car line out to the farm, and the city council
wouldn’t build a street to the city boundary, and the county wouldn’t
improve the road, Dan’s got the really magnificent idea that his
Ornaby place could be reached by automobiles. He believes if the
things could be made cheap enough everybody that’s going to live
in Ornaby Addition could own one and go back and forth in it.
And besides, he expects to build some horseless omnibuses to run
out there from town."</p>

<p>"He expects to?" Mrs. Savage cried, aghast. "He’s just about
to lose everything, yet he expects to manufacture horseless carriages
and omnibuses?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Harlan said easily. "<em>He</em> doesn’t know he’s
bankrupt! To hear him you’d think he’s just beginning to make
his fortune and create great public works."</p>

<p>"Jehoshaphat!" In a few extremities during her long life Mrs.
Savage had sought an outlet for her emotions in this expression;
and after using it now she lay silent for some moments; then gave
utterance to a dry little gasp of laughter. "I guess it’s a good
thing I’ve made a new will! Maybe this girl might have sense enough
to clear out."</p>

<p>"Lena?" Harlan asked, for his grandmother’s voice was little
more than a whisper, as if she spoke to herself; and he was not
sure of her words. "Do you mean you think Lena might leave Dan?"</p>

<p>"If he didn’t have any money she might. What did she marry him
for? She’s <em>hated</em> being married to him, hasn’t she? She
must have believed he had money."</p>

<p>Harlan shook his head. "No," he said thoughtfully;—"I don’t believe
she’s mercenary. I don’t think that’s why she married him."</p>

<p>"Can’t you use your reason?" the old lady complained petulantly.
"Hasn’t she whined and scolded every minute since he brought her
here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it’s not so bad as that, grandma."</p>

<p>"Your mother says she stays in her room for days at a time."</p>

<p>"Yes, she gets spells when she’s moody—or at least just quiet,"
Harlan admitted. "But she’s not always in them by any means. She’s
rather amusing sometimes, and she seems to try to be kind to Dan."</p>

<p>"Oh, she ‘seems to try?’" Mrs. Savage echoed. "<em>You</em> seem
to try to stand up for her! Do you like her?"</p>

<p>Faced with this abrupt question, Harlan was somewhat disturbed.
"Well, possibly not," he replied honestly, after a moment. "No,
I can’t say I do."</p>

<p>"I thought not. And does she like any of you?"</p>

<p>"Well, she’s evidently rather fond of mother—and of father, too."</p>

<p>"Who on earth could help liking <em>them</em>?" Mrs. Savage cried,
and, in her vehemence, seemed about to rise from her bed. "Do
you think <em>that’s</em> to her credit? She hates everybody and
everything <em>else</em> here, and she nags Dan. That means she
thought he had money, and she married him for it, and now she’s
disappointed. Well, she’ll keep on being disappointed a good while,
so far as <em>my</em> property is concerned! Then maybe she’ll
have sense enough to leave him and give him a chance to get the
woman he ought to’ve married in the first place."</p>

<p>Harlan looked a little startled as his grandmother sank back,
panting with exhaustion; the spirit within her was too high and
still too passionate for the frail material left to it. The self
of her was indeed without age, unaltered, and as dominant as it
had ever been, though the instrument through which it communicated,
her strengthless body, was almost perished out of any serviceableness.
To her grandson there came an odd comparison: it seemed to him
that she was like a vigorous person shouting through an almost
useless telephone that could make only the tiniest, just perceptible
sounds; and he had an odder thought than this: When the telephone
was entirely broken and silent would she still be trying to shout
through it? She would be shouting somewhere, he felt sure. But
what he said, rather sadly, was, "Martha? I suppose you mean Martha
Shelby?"</p>

<p>"Of course! Martha could make something out of Dan, and she’s
never looked at anybody but him, and she never will. You needn’t
expect her to, either, young man."</p>

<p>Harlan’s colour heightened at this, and some shadows of sensitiveness
about his mouth became quickly more visible. "Oh, no; of course
I don’t," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"She’ll never marry you," the terrible old lady went on. "I know
what you’ve been up to—I’ve had my eyes about me—but you’ll never
get her to quit thinking of Dan. And if this painted-up photograph
girl takes her baby and goes away some day, things might have
a chance to come out right. But <em>you</em>, young man——" She
stopped, beset by a little cough as feeble as a baby’s, yet enough
to check her; and upon this the professional nurse who now took
care of her appeared in the doorway and gave Harlan the smiling
glance that let him know his call had lasted long enough.</p>

<p>He rose from his chair by the bedside, murmuring the appropriate
cheering phrases;—he was sure his grandmother would be stronger
the next time he came, and she would soon "get downstairs again,"
he said; while she looked up at him with a strange contemplation
that he sometimes remembered afterwards; she had so many times
in her life said to others what he was saying to her now. But
she let him thus ease his departure, and responded with only a
faintly gasped, "We’ll hope so," and "Good-night."</p>

<p>Though he bent over her, her voice was almost inaudible against
the sound of the rain spitefully hammering the windows; and in
the light of the single green-shaded bulb that hung above the
table of tonics and medicines at the foot of the bed, the whiteness
of her face was almost indistinguishable from the whiteness of
the pillow. She was so nearly a ghost, indeed, that as he touched
the cold hand in farewell, it seemed to him that if there were
ghosts about—his grandfather, for instance—she might almost as
easily be communing with them as with the living. She was of their
world more than of this wherein she still wished to linger.</p>

<p>Downstairs, the elderly negro who had served her so long waited
to open the door for the parting guest.</p>

<p>"You ought to brung you’ papa’s an’ mamma’s carri’ge, Mist’ Hollun,"
he said. "You goin’ git mighty wet, umbrella or no umbrella."</p>

<p>"No doubt, Nimbus."</p>

<p>"Yes, suh," said Nimbus reflectively. "You goin’ swim. How you
think you’ grammaw feel to-night?"</p>

<p>"I’m afraid she’s not any stronger. I’m afraid she won’t be here
much longer."</p>

<p>"No, suh?" The thin old man chuckled a little, as if to himself.
"She awready <em>did</em> be here some few days! She stay li’l’
while yet, Mist’ Hollun."</p>

<p>"You think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, suh," said Nimbus, chuckling again. "Same way as ’tis ’bout
anything else. Some people come call on you; stay li’l’ while;
git up to go, they walk right out. Some people, they set an’ set
an’ set; then when they git up to go, they don’t go; they keep
on talk, talk, talk. You grammaw she aw-ways do like that. She
goin’ take her time before she walk out the big door."</p>

<p>"I hope so," Harlan said, as Nimbus unfastened the old-fashioned
brass door-chain for him. "I hope so, indeed."</p>

<p>"Yes, suh; she take her own time," the coloured man insisted;—then,
opening the door, he stood aside and inclined himself in a bow
that obviously gave him a satisfaction more than worth the effort.
"I expeck she do you well, Mist’ Hollun."</p>

<p>"What?" Harlan asked, pausing to unfurl the umbrella he had left
just outside. "What did you say, Nimbus?"</p>

<p>"I mean: What she goin’ do with all that propaty?" Nimbus explained.
"Door she goin’ out of when she git ready, it’s a mighty big door,
but ’tain’t big enough to tote all that propaty with her—no, suh!
I expeck you goin’ git mighty big slice all that propaty, Mist’
Hollun. Goo’ ni’, suh."</p>

<p>Harlan laughed, bade him good-night, and strode forward into
the gusty water that drove through the darkness. Outside the gate,
as he turned toward home, he laughed again, amused by the old
negro’s view of things, but not amused by the things themselves.
Harlan knew that he had never won his grandmother’s affection;
her thought had always been of his brother and was still of Dan
now, as she lay upon the bed from which she would never rise.
Whatever the terms of her new will might be, and whatever their
actual consequences, she had made it clear that they were at least
designed for Dan’s ultimate benefit.</p>

<p>Harlan had little expectation of any immediate benefit to himself,
notwithstanding the lively hints of Nimbus; nor were his hopes
greater than his expectations. He had no wish to supplant his
brother. </p>
