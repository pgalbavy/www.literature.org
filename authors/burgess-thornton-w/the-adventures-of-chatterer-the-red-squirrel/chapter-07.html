<p>Chatterer the Red Squirrel is a scamp himself and not to be trusted.
Nobody in the Green Forest or on the Green Meadows trusts him.
And people who cannot be trusted themselves never trust any one
else. Chatterer never does. He is always suspicious. So when Peter
Rabbit had said good-by and started for the dear Old Briar-patch
without knowing where Chatterer's new house was, Chatterer had
made up his mind right away that Peter would never be satisfied
until he knew, or thought he knew, where that new house was. You
see, he knew all about Peter's dreadful curiosity.</p>

<p>He watched Peter out of sight, then he slipped down out of sight
himself between the stones of the old wall. "I know what Peter
will do," said he to himself. "Peter will come sneaking back,
and hide where he can watch me, and so find out where my new house
is. I'll just stay here long enough to give him a chance to hide,
and then I'll fool him."</p>

<p>You see, Chatterer knew that if he had been in Peter's place,
he would have done just that thing. So he waited a little while
and then went back to the place where Peter had left him. There
he sat and pretended to be looking in the direction in which Peter
had gone, as if to make sure that Peter was really on his way
home. But all the time Chatterer was watching out of the corners
of his eyes to see if Peter was hiding anywhere near. He didn't
see Peter, but he didn't have the least doubt that Peter was somewhere
about.</p>

<p>After a while, he ran over to a hole between the stones of the
old wall and pretended to be very busy there, just as if it really
were the new house he had found. He kept popping in and out and
looking around as if afraid that some one was watching him. He
even got some dry leaves and took them inside, as if to make a
bed. All the time, although he hadn't seen a sign of Peter, he
didn't have the least doubt in the world that Peter was watching
him. When he grew tired, a new idea popped into his shrewd little
head. He popped out of the hole and sat up on the wall. Then he
said aloud that verse which had made Peter's ears burn so. He
had meant to make Peter's ears burn. He said that verse just as
if he really did believe that Peter was not spying on him and
was glad of it. When he had finished, he whisked out of sight
again to give Peter a chance to get away. But this time Chatterer
did some peeking himself. He hid where Peter couldn't see him,
but where he himself could see both ways along the old stone wall,
and so it was that he saw Peter crawl out from under the little
bush where he had been hiding and sneak away in the direction
of the Old Briar-patch. And he knew that this time Peter had gone
for good.</p>

<p>Then Chatterer laughed and laughed to think how he had fooled
Peter Rabbit, and wished that he could pat himself on the back
for being so smart. He didn't once think of how dishonest and
mean it was of Peter to spy on him, because, you see, he would
have done the same thing himself. "One has to have one's wits
very sharp these days to keep a secret," chuckled Chatterer.</p>

<p>But over in the old Briar-patch that afternoon Peter Rabbit sat
very thoughtful and very much ashamed. The thought that he had
found out where Chatterer's new house was didn't give him the
pleasure that he had thought it would. His ears still burned,
for he thought that Chatterer supposed him honest when he wasn't.</p>

<p>"I believe I'll go over to-morrow and tell Chatterer all about
it and how mean I have been," said he at last. And when he had
made up his mind to do this, he felt better.</p>

<p>And all the time he hadn't found Chatterer's new house at all.
You see, it was the old home of Drummer the Woodpecker in an old
apple-tree which Chatterer had decided to live in.</p>
