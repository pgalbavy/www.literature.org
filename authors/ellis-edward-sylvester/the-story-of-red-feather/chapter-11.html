<p>Nothing could have shown more strongly the confidence of Melville
Clarendon in Saladin than the course he followed in trying to
throw the pursuing Sioux off his track.</p>

<p>He had halted at a distance of less than fifty feet from the
path, and, sitting erect on the back of the steed, he waited for
the three Indians to ride past.</p>

<p>At such times a horse is quicker than its rider to discover the
presence of other animals, and the temptation to make it known
by a whinny or neigh has often upset all calculations and overthrown
the plans of the fugitive or scout.</p>

<p>Melville knew the peril from this source, but he had little misgiving
about Saladin. He softly patted his neck, and knew he understood
the situation well enough to hold his peace; but how would it
be with the other animals&mdash;would they betray their discovery of
the motionless steed at the side of the trail? A faint neigh from
them would be certain to give their cunning riders a clue to the
truth; and, checking their own horses, they would leap to the
ground, and be upon the youth before he could dash into cover.</p>

<p>You may understand, therefore, the anxiety of Melville when through
the gloom he caught the dim outlines of the first horseman, as
he came opposite, closely followed by the others.</p>

<p>The suspense was short. While the boy held his breath, the last
of the three horsemen vanished in the gloom, and he was placed
at the rear, with enemies on both sides of him.</p>

<p>The ruse of Melville had succeeded, and the question now to be
answered was as to what use he should make of his opportunity,
if such it should prove to be?</p>

<p>It would seem that nothing could be more reckless than for the
youth, after eluding his three immediate pursuers, to return over
the trail to the crossing, but only a moment's thought was necessary
for him to decide to do that very thing.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "The last of the three horsemen vanished in the
gloom."]</p>

<p>From where he sat on his pony, screened by bushes and rocks,
he observed that the light from the burning buildings to the south-east
was fast diminishing. The fire had been rapid, and before long
total darkness would rest on the stream and plain again. It would
therefore be safe for him to approach the edge of the creek, provided
none of the remaining Sioux had crossed over.</p>

<p>Waiting only long enough to make sure that the three Indians
were beyond reach of the sound of Saladin's hoofs, he gently jerked
the bit and spoke softly to him. The steed stepped forward with
as much care as his rider could have shown, and soon stood in
the path again.</p>

<p>Here Melville held him motionless a moment or two, while he peered
around and listened. Nothing was seen or heard of the Indians,
and, heading toward the stream, the horse advanced on a gentle
walk.</p>

<p>Melville kept his pony at a walk for no other reason than to
prevent any betrayal from the sound of his feet. The distance
was slight, and soon he came to a halt on the very edge of the
stream, while the rider, peering across, failed to catch the faintest
outline of the horsemen that were in sight a short time before.</p>

<p>Nothing could have justified the risk of attempting to ride to
the other bank; for if the Sioux were in the neighborhood they
would not only discover the youth, but would have him at such
disadvantage that escape would be out of the question.</p>

<p>The lad held no such purpose, but, turning his animal to the
right, began making his way down stream, toward the Lower Crossing,
near his own home. It was easy to do this by keeping close to
the water, since the unevenness of the ground did not begin until
a few yards or rods from the bank.</p>

<p>The darkness was such that Saladin was left to himself, Melville
knowing he could give him no help by any attempt at guiding him.
The sagacious beast thrust his nose forward, and, like an elephant,
crossing the stream, seemed to feel every foot of the way.</p>

<p>Despite the extreme care, he had not taken a dozen steps when
a rolling stone caused him to stumble, and the rider narrowly
missed taking a header over his ears. Saladin quickly recovered
himself, but at the moment of doing so the youth was startled
by a whistle from the other shore, instantly answered by a similar
call from the bank along which he was riding.</p>

<p>This proved that not only were the main party waiting, but the
three Sioux that had started to pursue the young fugitive had
returned.</p>

<p>But if the stumble of Saladin had revealed his whereabouts, Melville
was still in great peril. Without waiting to assure himself on
the point, he urged his pony to a brisk walk, never pausing until
fully two hundred yards were placed behind him. Then, when he
looked back and listened, he was convinced his fears were groundless,
and it was a simple coincidence that the signals which startled
him were emitted at the moment of the slight mishap to his horse.</p>

<p>So far as he could judge, he had a clear course now, and he allowed
Saladin to advance as rapidly as he chose.</p>

<p>His chief distress was concerning Dot. The withdrawal of Red
Feather was so sudden that some unusual cause must have been at
the bottom. The lad could not help thinking the chieftain should
have given him a hint of his course before the youth learned it
at such a risk to himself.</p>

<p>He was not without fear that harm had befallen his beloved sister,
but his confidence in Red Feather was perfect, and he knew that
he would do his best to take care of her.</p>

<p>Convinced that the Sioux at the Upper Crossing were the ones
that had fired the buildings to the south-east, and that they
belonged to Tall Bear's band, it followed that something must
have taken place to drive them from the siege of Melville's home.</p>

<p>It might be that, learning of the flight of the children, they
had scattered to search for them. It would seem that they were
small game for such a big effort, but the ill success that had
marked Tall Bear's brief career as a raider may have made him
glad of even a small degree of success. Besides, it might be that
only a portion of his party was on the hunt.</p>

<p>But to Melville the most likely belief was the one formed some
time before, to the effect that company whose appearance had caused
such excitement were white men numerous and strong enough to send
the Sioux skurrying away to avoid a fight with them.</p>

<p>It was this belief which caused Melville to seek the Lower Crossing,
when there was much risk involved in the attempt.</p>

<p>"If father and a lot of his friends have scared off Tall Bear
and his Sioux, they can't be far off&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Climb down thar, pard, mighty quick!"</p>

<p>It was a startling summons that thus broke in upon the reverie
of Melville, but he quickly recovered from the shock, knowing
by the voice that it was that of a friend.</p>

<p>He had reached the Lower Crossing, when a horseman that was awaiting
him suddenly loomed in sight through the gloom, and hailed him
with the rough command to dismount.</p>

<p>"I don't see why I should get off my horse when he isn't stolen,"
replied the youth with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Wal, to be sure, if it isn't young Clarendon! Hello, Archie,
here's your younker (boy), sure as you live."</p>

<p>It was the famous scout Nat Trumbull who spoke these cheery words,
and, before the youth knew it, it looked as if a dozen horsemen
had sprung from the ground and surrounded him.</p>

<p>"We're looking for Injins," added Nat; "thar was plenty of 'em
a while ago, but they've become powerful scarce all of a sudden."</p>

<p>"I've seen more than I wished," replied Melville, "but I guess,
you've frightened them off&#11834;"</p>

<p>At this juncture the boy's father rode hurriedly forward through
the group, and, leaning from his saddle, gratefully pressed the
hand of his son, and anxiously asked about Dot.</p>

<p>The youth, as briefly as he could, told the story which is familiar
to you. The amazement of the listeners was great, and to more
than one it seemed impossible that the detested Red Feather should
have proved himself a friend instead of the most cruel enemy of
the children.</p>

<p>"Why, it's him that we war after more than any one else," said
Nat Trumbull; "but if he's made a change like that, why I'll shake
hands with him and call the account squar."</p>

<p>Mr. Clarendon's distress over the uncertainty about Dot was so
great that the thoughts of all were turned toward her; and when
he asked that an effort should be made to trace her and Red Feather,
Nat and the rest gave their eager consent, and the start was made
without a minute's unnecessary delay.</p>

<p>Nat Trumbull was disappointed because of his failure to locate
Tall Bear and his band. The outbreak of the Sioux was so sudden
that even those who were best acquainted with their ways did not
believe it was so near, but when the truth became known the authorities
saw the only right course to take.</p>

<p>There were many hundred Sioux within the boundaries of Minnesota
at that time, and unless the revolt was suppressed at once and
with a strong hand it would rapidly spread, with the most lamentable
consequences. There was a hasty organization and gathering of
forces to start after the raiders and bring them to terms before
they should gain courage by any important successes.</p>

<p>It was the ardent desire of the rangers under Trumbull to force
Red Feather and his band into a fight where there would be no
getting away on either side. The scout meant to hit hard when
he did strike.</p>

<p>This statement will make clear the course of the irregular cavalry&mdash;as
they may be called&mdash;when they became aware that the Indians whom
they were after were gathered around the home of Archibald Clarendon.
That gentleman was eager for himself and friends to dash forward,
but Nat reminded him that the presence of the Sioux and the fact
that, although the barn was a mass of ashes and smoking ruins,
his house stood intact were proofs that the raiders had been unable
to burn down the cabin or secure his children.</p>

<p>Such being the case, Trumbull began manoeuvring with a view of
getting matters in such a shape that a fight would be certain.
There were several glasses among the rangers, and in the deepening
darkness they gave important aid.</p>

<p>It was evident from the manner of the Sioux that they were not
sure of the identity of the horsemen. Could they have used spy-glasses
like the white men, they could not have failed to learn the truth.</p>

<p>Trumbull turned this uncertainty to his own advantage. He purposely
held his men back to prevent the truth becoming known; but as
the darkness increased he kept edging to the southward, spreading
the horsemen out to an extent that would have proved costly had
the Sioux been sagacious enough to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>Nat's force was too small to attempt to surround the Indians,
and he was still hopeful of forcing them into a fight. He did
not lose a minute, but worked farther and farther along, until
all were far from that part of the horizon where first seen.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Pressed the hand of his son, and anxiously asked
about Dot." &mdash;Page 119]</p>

<p>But while Nat Trumbull was vigorously pushing things, it became
known that two of the Sioux were hovering near and watching every
movement. That these fellows were wonderfully cunning and quick
was proved by their escape when both were charged by the horsemen.
Despite everything that could be done, these scouts made off,
and of course carried their important news to their chief.</p>

<p>The flight of the Sioux scouts caused a change in the plans of
Nat Trumbull. Knowing it was useless to try to surprise the dusky
rogues, he brought his men together and rode rapidly toward the
Clarendon cabin. He hoped to arrive before the raiders could get
away, and to administer sharp punishment to them.</p>

<p>Trumbull approached the house and smoking ruins with care, for
there was abundant chance for their enemies to hide themselves
and give the white men a rattling volley before they could escape
the peril. It required considerable time for the rangers to learn
that none of their enemies were there, and then Mr. Clarendon
himself discovered the door of his house open. Still uncertain
of the truth, he and his friends waited some time before daring
to venture within.</p>

<p>The conclusion of this examination was the natural one, that
the Sioux had fled, taking the children with them. But, as it
was clear they could not have gone far, Trumbull galloped with
most of his men to the crossing, in the hope of coming upon the
marauders there.</p>

<p>He had no more than fairly convinced himself that he was in error
again when Melville Clarendon rode up on Saladin, his father making
his appearance shortly after.</p>

<p>The light in the south-east had attracted the notice of the scouts
some time before, and the story told by the youth led Trumbull
to believe the main body was near the Upper Crossing, where doubtless
they had made Red Feather prisoner.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the dozen horsemen set their faces in that direction
and struck into a rapid gallop. The leader was hopeful that, if
the slippery scamps were located, he could reach them. He believed
his men were as well mounted as they, and, if only a fair chance
were given, they would compel the others to fight.</p>

<p>Nat rode at the head, with Mr. Clarendon and Melville just behind
him. The keen eyes of the ranger peered through the darkness into
which he was plunging so swiftly, on the alert for the first sign
of an enemy. As he drew near the Upper Crossing he slackened his
pace slightly, those behind doing the same, with the exception
of the settler and his son, who found themselves at the side of
the leader.</p>

<p>"Helloa! there's one of 'em!" exclaimed Nat.</p>

<p>The three saw the figure of an Indian running over the ground
with great swiftness. Knowing his danger, he flung aside his blankets,
so that his flight was unimpeded, and his exhibition of speed
excited the admiration of his pursuers.</p>

<p>"Let him alone," added Trumbull; "I don't want any one else to
interfere&mdash;he belongs to <em>me</em>."</p>

<p>And then, to the astonishment of every one, the scout made a
flying leap from the saddle, and bounded after the fugitive on
foot.</p>

<p>It was an odd chivalrous feeling which led him to do this. Inasmuch
as the warrior had no pony, Trumbull meant that the contest between
them should be without any unfair advantage to either party.</p>

<p>The Sioux was running like a deer, but the white man beat him.
Nat Trumbull is to-day one of the fleetest runners in the north-west,
and no doubt he felt a natural wish to show this Indian, as well
as his own friends, what he could do in that line.</p>

<p>It may be said that from the first the fugitive was doomed; for
if Trumbull should prove unequal to the task of running him down,
the cavalry would do it, and if his strangely absent comrades
should rally to his help, they would be fiercely attacked in turn.
Since the white man quickly proved his superiority, it must be
admitted that the outlook for the fleeing warrior was discouraging
from the beginning.</p>

<p>Steadily and rapidly Nat gained on the desperate fugitive, until,
in less time than would be supposed, he was almost at his elbow.</p>

<p>"Surrender, pard!" called out the scout; "for you don't know
how to run, and I've got you, dead sure."</p>

<p>Realizing that there was no escape by flight, the Sioux dropped
his rifle, and, whipping out his hunting-knife while still fleeing
at the highest bent of his speed, he stopped short, wheeled about,
and struck viciously at his pursuer with the weapon.</p>

<p>But the veteran scout was expecting that very thing, and parrying
the blow with admirable skill, he sent the knife spinning a dozen
feet to one side. Dropping his own gun, Trumbull then dashed in
and seized the warrior around the waist.</p>

<p>"It's you, Tall Bear, is it?" said he, recognizing his old antagonist;
"we'll settle this again by a wrestling-match. If you can throw
me, we'll let you go without a scratch; but if I fling you, then
you're mine. Keep back boys, and may the best man win!"</p>

<p>It was a curious scene, but the contest could not have been fairer.
Trumbull waited till his opponent had secured his best hold, for
Tall Bear was as quick to identify his rival as the latter was
to recognize him.</p>

<p>The scout waited till the chief said he was ready. Then, like
a flash, he dropped to a low stooping posture, seized each leg
of the other below the knee in a grip of iron, and straightening
up with marvelous quickness and power sent Tall Bear sprawling
like a frog through the air, and over his head.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Sent Tall Bear sprawling like a frog through
the air."]</p>

<p>Despite the remarkable agility of the Sioux, he could not save
himself, but alighted on his crown with tremendous force.</p>

<p>Not the least amusing part of this contest was that, at the instant
Tall Bear started on his ærial flight, he called out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Me surrender! Tall Bear good Injin&mdash;he lub white&#11834;"</p>

<p>The crash of his head against the solid ground checked his words,
and left for ever uncertain what the chieftain meant to say. He
quickly recovered from the shock, for possibly, it may be said,
he was becoming accustomed to such rough treatment and could stand
it better than at first.</p>

<p>In the course of a minute or two Tall Bear staggered uncertainly
to his feet, and looking up in the faces of the horsemen who were
on every side of him, was compelled to admit that he was their
prisoner.</p>

<p>So it proved that the last essay of the chieftain who was on
a little scout for himself was the greatest failure of them all,
and in the end it was fortunate that such was the fact; for when
the strong arm of the authorities was laid upon the raiders the
chief had no trouble in proving that he had inflicted no serious
harm to the settlers. True, he had destroyed some property, and
tried hard to do greater damage; but, as I have said, he failed
utterly.</p>
