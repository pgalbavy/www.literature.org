Mr. Salton had an appointment for six o'clock at Liverpool.  When he
had driven off, Sir Nathaniel took Adam by the arm.
<P>
"May I come with you for a while to your study?  I want to speak to
you privately without your uncle knowing about it, or even what the
subject is.  You don't mind, do you?  It is not idle curiosity.  No,
no.  It is on the subject to which we are all committed."
<P>
"Is it necessary to keep my uncle in the dark about it?  He might be
offended."
<P>
"It is not necessary; but it is advisable.  It is for his sake that
I asked.  My friend is an old man, and it might concern him unduly--
even alarm him.  I promise you there shall be nothing that could
cause him anxiety in our silence, or at which he could take
umbrage."
<P>
"Go on, sir!" said Adam simply.
<P>
"You see, your uncle is now an old man.  I know it, for we were boys
together.  He has led an uneventful and somewhat self-contained
life, so that any such condition of things as has now arisen is apt
to perplex him from its very strangeness.  In fact, any new matter
is trying to old people.  It has its own disturbances and its own
anxieties, and neither of these things are good for lives that
should be restful.  Your uncle is a strong man, with a very happy
and placid nature.  Given health and ordinary conditions of life,
there is no reason why he should not live to be a hundred.  You and
I, therefore, who both love him, though in different ways, should
make it our business to protect him from all disturbing influences.
I am sure you will agree with me that any labour to this end would
be well spent.  All right, my boy!  I see your answer in your eyes;
so we need say no more of that.  And now," here his voice changed,
"tell me all that took place at that interview.  There are strange
things in front of us--how strange we cannot at present even guess.
Doubtless some of the difficult things to understand which lie
behind the veil will in time be shown to us to see and to
understand.  In the meantime, all we can do is to work patiently,
fearlessly, and unselfishly, to an end that we think is right.  You
had got so far as where Lilla opened the door to Mr. Caswall and the
negro.  You also observed that Mimi was disturbed in her mind at the
way Mr. Caswall looked at her cousin."
<P>
"Certainly--though 'disturbed' is a poor way of expressing her
objection."
<P>
"Can you remember well enough to describe Caswall's eyes, and how
Lilla looked, and what Mimi said and did?  Also Oolanga, Caswall's
West African servant."
<P>
"I'll do what I can, sir.  All the time Mr. Caswall was staring, he
kept his eyes fixed and motionless--but not as if he was in a
trance.  His forehead was wrinkled up, as it is when one is trying
to see through or into something.  At the best of times his face has
not a gentle expression; but when it was screwed up like that it was
almost diabolical.  It frightened poor Lilla so that she trembled,
and after a bit got so pale that I thought she had fainted.
However, she held up and tried to stare back, but in a feeble kind
of way.  Then Mimi came close and held her hand.  That braced her
up, and--still, never ceasing her return stare--she got colour again
and seemed more like herself."
<P>
"Did he stare too?"
<P>
"More than ever.  The weaker Lilla seemed, the stronger he became,
just as if he were feeding on her strength.  All at once she turned
round, threw up her hands, and fell down in a faint.  I could not
see what else happened just then, for Mimi had thrown herself on her
knees beside her and hid her from me.  Then there was something like
a black shadow between us, and there was the nigger, looking more
like a malignant devil than ever.  I am not usually a patient man,
and the sight of that ugly devil is enough to make one's blood boil.
When he saw my face, he seemed to realise danger--immediate danger--
and slunk out of the room as noiselessly as if he had been blown
out.  I learned one thing, however--he is an enemy, if ever a man
had one."
<P>
"That still leaves us three to two!" put in Sir Nathaniel.
<P>
"Then Caswall slunk out, much as the nigger had done.  When he had
gone, Lilla recovered at once."
<P>
"Now," said Sir Nathaniel, anxious to restore peace, "have you found
out anything yet regarding the negro?  I am anxious to be posted
regarding him.  I fear there will be, or may be, grave trouble with
him."
<P>
"Yes, sir, I've heard a good deal about him--of course it is not
official; but hearsay must guide us at first.  You know my man
Davenport--private secretary, confidential man of business, and
general factotum.  He is devoted to me, and has my full confidence.
I asked him to stay on board the WEST AFRICAN and have a good look
round, and find out what he could about Mr. Caswall.  Naturally, he
was struck with the aboriginal savage.  He found one of the ship's
stewards, who had been on the regular voyages to South Africa.  He
knew Oolanga and had made a study of him.  He is a man who gets on
well with niggers, and they open their hearts to him.  It seems that
this Oolanga is quite a great person in the nigger world of the
African West Coast.  He has the two things which men of his own
colour respect:  he can make them afraid, and he is lavish with
money.  I don't know whose money--but that does not matter.  They
are always ready to trumpet his greatness.  Evil greatness it is--
but neither does that matter.  Briefly, this is his history.  He was
originally a witch-finder--about as low an occupation as exists
amongst aboriginal savages.  Then he got up in the world and became
an Obi-man, which gives an opportunity to wealth VIA blackmail.
Finally, he reached the highest honour in hellish service.  He
became a user of Voodoo, which seems to be a service of the utmost
baseness and cruelty.  I was told some of his deeds of cruelty,
which are simply sickening.  They made me long for an opportunity of
helping to drive him back to hell.  You might think to look at him
that you could measure in some way the extent of his vileness; but
it would be a vain hope.  Monsters such as he is belong to an
earlier and more rudimentary stage of barbarism.  He is in his way a
clever fellow--for a nigger; but is none the less dangerous or the
less hateful for that.  The men in the ship told me that he was a
collector:  some of them had seen his collections.  Such
collections!  All that was potent for evil in bird or beast, or even
in fish.  Beaks that could break and rend and tear--all the birds
represented were of a predatory kind.  Even the fishes are those
which are born to destroy, to wound, to torture.  The collection, I
assure you, was an object lesson in human malignity.  This being has
enough evil in his face to frighten even a strong man.  It is little
wonder that the sight of it put that poor girl into a dead faint!"
<P>
Nothing more could be done at the moment, so they separated.
<P>
Adam was up in the early morning and took a smart walk round the
Brow.  As he was passing Diana's Grove, he looked in on the short
avenue of trees, and noticed the snakes killed on the previous
morning by the mongoose.  They all lay in a row, straight and rigid,
as if they had been placed by hands.  Their skins seemed damp and
sticky, and they were covered all over with ants and other insects.
They looked loathsome, so after a glance, he passed on.
<P>
A little later, when his steps took him, naturally enough, past the
entrance to Mercy Farm, he was passed by the negro, moving quickly
under the trees wherever there was shadow.  Laid across one extended
arm, looking like dirty towels across a rail, he had the horrid-
looking snakes.  He did not seem to see Adam.  No one was to be seen
at Mercy except a few workmen in the farmyard, so, after waiting on
the chance of seeing Mimi, Adam began to go slowly home.
<P>
Once more he was passed on the way.  This time it was by Lady
Arabella, walking hurriedly and so furiously angry that she did not
recognise him, even to the extent of acknowledging his bow.
<P>
When Adam got back to Lesser Hill, he went to the coach-house where
the box with the mongoose was kept, and took it with him, intending
to finish at the Mound of Stone what he had begun the previous
morning with regard to the extermination.  He found that the snakes
were even more easily attacked than on the previous day; no less
than six were killed in the first half-hour.  As no more appeared,
he took it for granted that the morning's work was over, and went
towards home.  The mongoose had by this time become accustomed to
him, and was willing to let himself be handled freely.  Adam lifted
him up and put him on his shoulder and walked on.  Presently he saw
a lady advancing towards him, and recognised Lady Arabella.
<P>
Hitherto the mongoose had been quiet, like a playful affectionate
kitten; but when the two got close, Adam was horrified to see the
mongoose, in a state of the wildest fury, with every hair standing
on end, jump from his shoulder and run towards Lady Arabella.  It
looked so furious and so intent on attack that he called a warning.
<P>
"Look out--look out!  The animal is furious and means to attack."
<P>
Lady Arabella looked more than ever disdainful and was passing on;
the mongoose jumped at her in a furious attack.  Adam rushed forward
with his stick, the only weapon he had.  But just as he got within
striking distance, the lady drew out a revolver and shot the animal,
breaking his backbone.  Not satisfied with this, she poured shot
after shot into him till the magazine was exhausted.  There was no
coolness or hauteur about her now; she seemed more furious even than
the animal, her face transformed with hate, and as determined to
kill as he had appeared to be.  Adam, not knowing exactly what to
do, lifted his hat in apology and hurried on to Lesser Hill.
