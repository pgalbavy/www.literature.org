<p>The experience of Gravity Gimp, after reaching the outside of
the cavern, was remarkable in more than one respect.</p>

<p>When he found himself creeping up the narrow path, to the high
ground above, and realized that he would make a capital target
for one or a dozen of the Seneca sharpshooters, his teeth fairly
rattled, and he would have retreated, but for his affection for
the members of the Brainerd family.</p>

<p>"'Spect dere's two hundred ob 'em a-settin' in a row on a log
up dere and waitin' for me, and when I come along dey'll each
one hit me ober de head wid de butt end ob dere tomahawks, and
by de time dey gots frough I'll hab de headache so bad dat I'll
be as dizzy as Haberkick down dere."</p>

<p>Gravity paused for a minute, and then resumed creeping forward.
Within the succeeding ten minutes he had reached the high level
ground above, without sight or sound of an Indian.</p>

<p>No wonder he was mystified, for it occurred to him, naturally
enough, that if he could pass out unchallenged in that fashion
all the others might do the same, and what seemed to be a very
perilous situation might thus resolve itself into nothing of the
kind.</p>

<p>He came near turning back and inviting his friends to follow
him, but fortunately he changed his mind and decided to go farther,
before believing that the cloud had lifted.</p>

<p>"Dere don't seem to be anybody loafing 'bout here," he muttered,
"and I'll promenade a little further."</p>

<p>He now began cautiously moving over the same ground he and his
friends had hurried along when so hotly chased by the Indians.</p>

<p>Only a short distance was passed in the deep shadows of the trees,
when he paused, still mystified.</p>

<p>The question presented itself as to how he was to accomplish
anything that could benefit those whom he had left behind, for
if they should seek to leave the cavern during the night, there
was no other way, so far as he could judge, excepting that which
he himself had taken.</p>

<p>"It must be dat the Injuns are down on de oder side de ravine,
and I think dere's where I'll take an observation."</p>

<p>No task could be more delicate than this, and Gravity, with all
his shrewdness, was unfitted to undertake it. There were scouts,
who under the circumstances, would have gathered all the knowledge
desired, and would have placed themselves among their enemies
without detection, but the African was a different kind of personage.</p>

<p>He picked his way along the wood above the cavern, and had gone
less than two rods beyond, when he stopped to gaze about him.
The gloom was so dense that he could see very little, excepting
when he looked across the ravine, where the moonlight fell and
where the mass of rocks, so dreaded by the fugitives, was in plain
sight.</p>

<p>He saw nothing there which could enlighten him, but his heart
nearly stood still, when he not only heard a movement behind him
near the point where the path to the cavern reached the high ground
above, but despite the gloom detected several dark figures moving
stealthily about.</p>

<p>That these were Indians there could be no doubt, and the conclusion
was inevitable that they had seen him come out and had allowed
him to pass by them without molestation.</p>

<p>Being now between him and the shelter, his return was cut off,
and no matter what important discoveries he might make, he had
no means of telling them to his friends.</p>

<p>"I might have knowed dere would be some goings on like dis,"
he said, with a throb of alarm. "De best thing I kin do is to
strike out for Stroudsburg alone, widout waitin' for de folks."</p>

<p>Though he might have been justified in this course, yet his conscience
would not permit it, and he started again, with the purpose of
passing around to the other side of the ravine, and making a closer
reconnoissance of the spot where he was certain of finding enemies.</p>

<p>This required a long detour, and a full half-hour passed before
he got across the short ravine and began climbing up the other
side, near where the Indians were known to be only a short time
before.</p>

<p>As might have been anticipated, he went wrong, and got into the
worst trouble of his life.</p>

<p>He had seen nothing more of the Senecas, but several faint whistles
he recognized as signals passing between them, and he should have
understood, from what had already taken place, that his movements
were watched by the wary foe.</p>

<p>He was climbing a narrow passage, and was, perhaps, a dozen feet
above the bottom of the ravine, when, to his dismay, a sinewy
warrior sprang up in front of him, as though leaping out of the
ground itself, and with tomahawk raised and a guttural exclamation,
made for him.</p>

<p>The assault was so sudden that Gimp had no time to use his rifle,
but he was not taken altogether at fault. Dropping the weapon,
he recoiled a step or two and escaped the implement as it came
down with a vicious whiz.</p>

<p>Before the warrior could recover or retreat, the African threw
both arms about him, and, lifting him as though he were an infant,
flung him headlong into the ravine below.</p>

<p>"Dere! guess dat'll jar you a little&mdash;"</p>

<p>But, to his amazement, a second brawny Indian appeared directly
where the other had first shown himself, and he was immediately
followed by others, who, it was plain, were pushing up through
a narrow passage for the purpose of capturing the African.</p>

<p>The latter had succeeded so well a minute before, that he again
resorted to the same tactics, and, catching hold of the first
warrior he could reach, he hurried him after the first. Then the
next was treated in the same manner, and, for the time, Gravity
Gimp became a sort of sable geyser or miniature volcano, throwing
into the air sprawling Seneca Indians with a vehemence that was
as picturesque as it was amazing.</p>

<p>The exercise of hurling full-grown men aloft, regardless of how
high they go, and in what posture they strike, is an exhausting
diversion, no matter how powerful the gymnast who engages in it.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that the herculean African speedily found
that he had his hands more than full, and his terrific efforts
so told upon him that he grew more sluggish in his movements,
until at last he was fairly smothered with the crush of warriors,
and, despite his fierce resistance, was made prisoner.</p>
