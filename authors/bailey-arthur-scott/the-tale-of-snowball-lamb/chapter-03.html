<p>Old dog Spot came home from the pasture feeling quite pleased with
himself. He had caught a fat woodchuck. And that was enough to make him
happy.
</p>
<p>Spot hadn't crossed the barnyard when Henrietta Hen came fluttering up
to him. She was a busybody, always trying to get somebody into trouble.
"Snowball went to the village with Johnnie Green and his father!"
Henrietta shrieked.
</p><p>"That's good news," said old dog Spot. "I've been hoping to hear
something like that. We're well rid of that Snowball Lamb."
</p><p>"Oh! But they brought him back with them!" Henrietta Hen explained.
</p><p>Spot's face fell. "That's a pity," he said.
</p><p>Henrietta Hen peered into Spot's face. There was something that she
couldn't understand.
</p><p>"Why aren't you angry?" she inquired in her high-pitched voice. "Don't
you realize that Snowball tried to <u>follow the wagon</u> to the village? To
be sure, they picked him up down at the corner. But I want you to know
that he tried to <u>take your place</u>."
</p><p>At that old Spot let out a howl of rage.
</p><p>"I'll never go woodchuck hunting again!" he cried. "Things have come to
a pretty pass if I can't leave the farmyard for a few hours without
having a lamb insult me like that."
</p><p>Henrietta Hen was pleased.
</p><p>"I thought you'd want to know what had happened," she remarked. "And now
I must add that Snowball has been boasting about his trip. Of course,
his journey was nothing, compared with my visit to the county fair last
year. But I don't like to hear a lamb telling about his travels. Can't
you put a stop to it?"
</p><p>Old dog Spot shook his head.
</p><p>"For once," he said slowly, "I can't help wishing I was a sheep-killer."
</p><p>"Well," said Henrietta, "you know you could try."
</p><p>"It's not a question of trying," Spot told her. "My family isn't a
sheep-killing one. I have to live up to the family name."
</p><p>"Well," Henrietta Hen declared, "if I were you I'd join another
family--at least for a short time."
</p><p>But old dog Spot declared that that wouldn't do at all. "We'll have to
be patient," he said. "The Muley Cow claims that Johnnie Green will get
tired of Snowball sooner or later. It may be that she is right. Let us
hope so!"
</p><p>"Farmer Green ought to turn that great lamb into the pasture," Henrietta
Hen spluttered.
</p><p>That was exactly what Mrs. Green herself thought.
</p><p>"Your lamb can't come into my kitchen!" she called at that very moment.
For Johnnie Green was just then entering the doorway, with Snowball at
his heels.
</p><p>"Thank goodness," Spot barked, "there's one person on this farm who has
some sense! If it wasn't for Mrs. Green I'd be tempted to run away."
</p><p>As Johnnie Green closed the door behind him, leaving Snowball upon the
stone step, Snowball gave a plaintive _baa-a-a!_
</p><p>"Ugh!" cackled Henrietta Hen. "Did you ever hear such a silly sound in
all your life?"
