<p>Mrs. <em>BAXTER'S </em>little stroke of diplomacy had gone straight
to the mark, she was a woman of insight. For every reason she
was well content to have her son spend his evenings at home, though
it cannot be claimed that his presence enlivened the household,
his condition being one of strange, trancelike irascibility. Evening
after evening passed, while he sat dreaming painfully of Mr. Parcher's
porch; but in the daytime, though William did not literally make
hay while the sun shone, he at least gathered a harvest somewhat
resembling hay in general character.</p>

<p>Thus:</p>

<p>One afternoon, having locked his door to secure himself against
intrusion on the part of his mother or Jane, William seated himself
at his writing-table, and from a drawer therein took a small cardboard
box, which he uncovered, placing the contents in view before him
upon the table. (How meager, how chilling a word is "contents"!)
In the box were:</p>

<p>A faded rose.</p>

<p>Several other faded roses, disintegrated into leaves.</p>

<p>Three withered "four-leaf clovers."</p>

<p>A white ribbon still faintly smelling of violets.</p>

<p>A small silver shoe-buckle.</p>

<p>A large pearl button.</p>

<p>A small pearl button.</p>

<p>A tortoise-shell hair-pin.</p>

<p>A cross-section from the heel of a small slipper.</p>

<p>A stringy remnant, probably once an improvised wreath of daisies.</p>

<p>Four or five withered dandelions.</p>

<p>Other dried vegetation, of a nature now indistinguishable.</p>

<p>William gazed reverently upon this junk of precious souvenirs;
then from the inner pocket of his coat he brought forth, warm
and crumpled, a lumpish cluster of red geranium blossoms, still
aromatic and not quite dead, though naturally, after three hours
of such intimate confinement, they wore an unmistakable look of
suffering. With a tenderness which his family had never observed
in him since that piteous day in his fifth year when he tried
to mend his broken doll, William laid the geranium blossoms in
the cardboard box among the botanical and other relics.</p>

<p>His gentle eyes showed what the treasures meant to him, and yet
it was strange that they should have meant so much, because the
source of supply was not more than a quarter of a mile distant,
and practically inexhaustible. Miss Pratt had now been a visitor
at the Parchers' for something less than five weeks, but she had
made no mention of prospective departure, and there was every
reason to suppose that she meant to remain all summer. And as
any foliage or anything whatever that she touched, or that touched
her, was thenceforth suitable for William's museum, there appeared
to be some probability that autumn might see it so enlarged as
to lack that rarity in the component items which is the underlying
value of most collections.</p>

<p>William's writing-table was beside an open window, through which
came an insistent whirring, unagreeable to his mood; and, looking
down upon the sunny lawn, he beheld three lowly creatures. One
was Genesis; he was cutting the grass. Another was Clematis; he
had assumed a transient attitude, curiously triangular, in order
to scratch his ear, the while his anxious eyes never wavered from
the third creature.</p>

<p>This was Jane. In one hand she held a little stack of sugar-sprinkled
wafers, which she slowly but steadily depleted, unconscious of
the increasingly earnest protest, at last nearing agony, in the
eyes of Clematis. Wearing unaccustomed garments of fashion and
festivity, Jane stood, in speckless, starchy white and a blue
sash, watching the lawn-mower spout showers of grass as the powerful
Genesis easily propelled it along over lapping lanes, back and
forth, across the yard.</p>

<p>From a height of illimitable loftiness the owner of the cardboard
treasury looked down upon the squat commonplaceness of those three
lives. The condition of Jane and Genesis and Clematis seemed almost
laughably pitiable to him, the more so because they were unaware
of it. They breathed not the starry air that William breathed,
but what did it matter to them? The wretched things did not even
know that they meant nothing to Miss Pratt!</p>

<p>Clematis found his ear too pliable for any great solace from
his foot, but he was not disappointed; he had expected little,
and his thoughts were elsewhere. Rising, he permitted his nose
to follow his troubled eyes, with the result that it touched the
rim of the last wafer in Jane's external possession.</p>

<p>This incident annoyed William. "Look there!" he called from the
window. "You mean to eat that cake after the dog's had his face
on it?"</p>

<p>Jane remained placid. "It wasn't his face."</p>

<p>"Well, if it wasn't his face, I'd like to know what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It wasn't his face," Jane repeated. "It was his nose. It wasn't
all of his nose touched it, either. It was only a little outside
piece of his nose."</p>

<p>"Well, are you going to eat that cake, I ask you?"</p>

<p>Jane broke off a small bit of the wafer. She gave the bit to
Clematis and slowly ate what remained, continuing to watch Genesis
and apparently unconscious of the scorching gaze from the window.</p>

<p>"I never saw anything as disgusting as long as I've lived!" William
announced. "I wouldn't 'a' believed it if anybody'd told me a
sister of mine would eat after&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't," said Jane. "I like Clematis, anyway."</p>

<p>"Ye gods!" her brother cried. "Do you think that makes it any
better? And, BY the <em>WAY," </em>he continued, in a tone of
even greater severity, "I'd a like to know where you got those
cakes. Where'd you get 'em, I'd just like to inquire?"</p>

<p>"In the pantry." Jane turned and moved toward the house. "I'm
goin' in for some more, now."</p>

<p>William uttered a cry; these little cakes were sacred. His mother,
growing curious to meet a visiting lady of whom (so to speak)
she had heard much and thought more, had asked May Parcher to
bring her guest for iced tea, that afternoon. A few others of
congenial age had been invited: there was to be a small matinee,
in fact, for the honor and pleasure of the son of the house, and
the cakes of Jane's onslaught were part of Mrs. Baxter's preparations.
There was no telling where Jane would stop; it was conceivable
that Miss Pratt herself might go waferless.</p>

<p>William returned the cardboard box to its drawer with reverent
haste; then, increasing the haste, but dropping the reverence,
he hied himself to the pantry with such advantage of longer legs
that within the minute he and the wafers appeared in conjunction
before his mother, who was arranging fruit and flowers upon a
table in the "living-room."</p>

<p>William entered in the stained-glass attitude of one bearing
gifts. Overhead, both hands supported a tin pan, well laden with
small cakes and wafers, for which Jane was silently but repeatedly
and systematically jumping. Even under the stress of these efforts
her expression was cool and collected; she maintained the self-possession
that was characteristic of her.</p>

<p>Not so with William; his cheeks were flushed, his eyes indignant.
"You see what this child is doing?" he demanded. "Are you going
to let her ruin everything?"</p>

<p>"Ruin?" Mrs. Baxter repeated, absently, refreshing with fair
water a bowl of flowers upon the table. "Ruin?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ruin!" William was hotly emphatic, "If you don't do something
with her it 'll all be ruined before Miss Pr&mdash; before they even
get here!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter laughed. "Set the pan down, Willie."</p>

<p>"Set it <em>DOWN?" </em>he echoed, incredulously "With that child
in the room and grabbing like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There!" Mrs. Baxter took the pan from him, placed it upon a
chair, and with the utmost coolness selected five wafers and gave
them to Jane. "I'd already promised her she could have five more.
You know the doctor said Jane's digestion was the finest he'd
ever misunderstood. They won't hurt her at all, Willie."</p>

<p>This deliberate misinterpretation of his motives made it difficult
for William to speak. "Do <em>YOU </em>think," he began, hoarsely,
"do you <em>THINK</em>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They're so small, too," Mrs. Baxter went on. "<em>SHE </em>probably
wouldn't be sick if she ate them all."</p>

<p>"My heavens!" he burst forth. "Do you think I was worrying about&mdash;"
He broke off, unable to express himself save by a few gestures
of despair. Again finding his voice, and a great deal of it, he
demanded: "Do you realize that Miss <em>PRATT </em>will be here
within less than half an hour? What do you suppose she'd think
of the people of this town if she was invited out, expecting decent
treatment, and found two-thirds of the cakes eaten up before she
got there, and what was left of 'em all mauled and pawed over
and crummy and chewed-up lookin' from some wretched <em>CHILD?"
</em>Here William became oratorical, but not with marked effect,
since Jane regarded him with unmoved eyes, while Mrs. Baxter continued
to be mildly preoccupied in arranging the table. In fact, throughout
this episode in controversy the ladies' party had not only the
numerical but the emotional advantage. Obviously, the approach
of Miss Pratt was not to them what it was to William. "I tell
you," he declaimed;&mdash;"yes, I tell you that it wouldn't take much
of this kind of thing to make Miss Pratt think the people of this
town were&mdash;well, it wouldn't take much to make her think the people
of this town hadn't learned much of how to behave in society and
were pretty uncilivized!" He corrected himself. "Uncivilized!
And to think Miss Pratt has to find that out in MY house! To think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, Willie," said Mrs. Baxter, gently, "you'd better go up
and brush your hair again before your friends come. You mustn't
let yourself get so excited."</p>

<p>"'Excited!'" he cried, incredulously. "Do you think I'm <em>EXCITED?
</em>Ye gods!" He smote his hands together and, in his despair
of her intelligence, would have flung himself down upon a chair,
but was arrested half-way by simultaneous loud outcries from his
mother and Jane.</p>

<p>"Don't sit on the <em>CAKES!" </em>they both screamed.</p>

<p>Saving himself and the pan of wafers by a supreme contortion
at the last instant, William decided to remain upon his feet.
"What do I care for the cakes?" he demanded, contemptuously, beginning
to pace the floor. "It's the question of principle I'm talking
about! Do you think it's right to give the people of this town
a poor name when strangers like Miss <em>PRATT </em>come to vis&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Willie!" His mother looked at him hopelessly. "Do go and brush
your hair. If you could see how you've tousled it you would."</p>

<p>He gave her a dazed glance and strode from the room.</p>

<p>Jane looked after him placidly. "Didn't he talk funny!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," said Mrs. Baxter. She shook her head and uttered
the enigmatic words, "They do."</p>

<p>"I mean Willie, mamma," said Jane. "If it's anything about Miss
Pratt. he always talks awful funny. Don't you think Willie talks
awful funny if it's anything about Miss Pratt, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, mamma?" Jane asked as her mother paused.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;it happens. People do get like that at his age, Jane."</p>

<p>"Does everybody?"</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not everybody. Just some."</p>

<p>Jane's interest was roused. "Well, do those that do, mamma,"
she inquired, "do they all act like Willie?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Baxter. "That's the trouble; you can't tell what's
coming."</p>

<p>Jane nodded. "I think I know," she said. "You mean Willie&mdash;"</p>

<p>William himself interrupted her. He returned violently to the
doorway, his hair still tousled, and, standing upon the threshold,
said, sternly:</p>

<p>"What is that child wearing her best dress for?"</p>

<p>"Willie!" Mrs. Baxter cried. "Go brush your hair!"</p>

<p>"I wish to know what that child is all dressed up for?" he insisted.</p>

<p>"To please you! Don't you want her to look her best at your tea?"</p>

<p>"I thought that was it!" he cried, and upon this confirmation
of his worst fears he did increased violence to his rumpled hair.
"I suspected it, but I wouldn't 'a' believed it! You mean to let
this child&mdash;you mean to let&mdash;" Here his agitation affected his
throat and his utterance became clouded. A few detached phrases
fell from him: " &mdash;Invite MY friends&mdash;children's party&mdash;ye
gods!&mdash;think Miss Pratt plays dolls&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jane will be very good," his mother said. "I shouldn't think
of not having her, Willie, and you needn't bother about your friends;
they'll be very glad to see her. They all know her, except Miss
Pratt, perhaps, and&mdash;" Mrs. Baxter paused; then she asked, absently:
"By the way, haven't I heard somewhere that she likes pretending
to be a little girl, herself?"</p>

<p>"<em>WHAT</em>!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Baxter, remaining calm; "I'm sure I've heard
somewhere that she likes to talk 'baby-talk.'"</p>

<p>Upon this a tremor passed over William, after which he became
rigid. "You ask a lady to your house," he began, "and even before
she gets here, before you've even seen her, you pass judgment
upon one of the&mdash;one of the noblest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good gracious! <em>I</em> haven't 'passed judgment.' If she
does talk 'baby-talk,' I imagine she does it very prettily, and
I'm sure I've no objection. And if she does do it, why should
you be insulted by my mentioning it?"</p>

<p>"It was the way you said it," he informed her, icily.</p>

<p>"Good gracious! I just said it!" Mrs. Baxter laughed, and then,
probably a little out of patience with him, she gave way to that
innate mischievousness in such affairs which is not unknown to
her sex. "You see, Willie, if she pretends to be a cunning little
girl, it will be helpful to Jane to listen and learn how."</p>

<p>William uttered a cry; he knew that he was struck, but he was
not sure how or where. He was left with a blank mind and no repartee.
Again he dashed from the room.</p>

<p>In the hall, near the open front door, he came to a sudden halt,
and Mrs. Baxter and Jane heard him calling loudly to the industrious
Genesis:</p>

<p>"Here! You go cut the grass in the back yard, and for Heaven's
sake, take that dog with you!"</p>

<p>"Grass awready cut roun' back," responded the amiable voice of
Genesis, while the lawnmower ceased not to whir. "Cut all 'at
back yod 's mawnin'."</p>

<p>"Well, you can't cut the front yard now. Go around in the back
yard and take that dog with you."</p>

<p>"Nemmine 'bout 'at back yod! Ole Clem ain' trouble nobody."</p>

<p>"You hear what I tell you?" William shouted. "You do what I say
and you do it quick!"</p>

<p>Genesis laughed gaily. "I got my grass to cut!"</p>

<p>"You decline to do what I command you?" William roared.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeedy! Who pay me my wages? 'At's MY boss. You' ma say,
'Genesis, you git all 'at lawn mowed b'fo' sundown.' No, suh!
Nee'n' was'e you' bref on me, 'cause I'm got all MY time good
an' took up!"</p>

<p>Once more William presented himself fatefully to his mother and
Jane. "May I just kindly ask you to look out in the front yard?"</p>

<p>"I'm familiar with it, Willie," Mrs. Baxter returned, a little
wearily.</p>

<p>"I mean I want you to look at Genesis."</p>

<p>"I'm familiar with his appearance, too," she said. "Why in the
world do you mind his cutting the grass?"</p>

<p>William groaned. "Do you honestly want guests coming to this
house to see that awful old darky out there and know that HE'S
the kind of servants we employ? Ye gods!"</p>

<p>"Why, Genesis is just a neighborhood outdoors darky, Willie;
he works for half a dozen families besides us. Everybody in this
part of town knows him."</p>

<p>"Yes," he cried, "but a lady that didn't live here wouldn't.
Ye gods! What do you suppose she <em>WOULD </em>think? You know
what he's got on!"</p>

<p>"It's a sort of sleeveless jersey he wears, Willie, I think."</p>

<p>"No, you <em>DON'T </em>think that!" he cried, with great bitterness.
"You know it's not a jersey! You know perfectly well what it is,
and yet you expect to keep him out there when&mdash;when one of the
one of the nobl&mdash;when my friends arrive! And they'll think that's
our <em>DOG </em>out there, won't they? When intelligent people
come to a house and see a dog sitting out in front, they think
it's the family in the house's dog, don't they?"  William's condition
becoming more and more disordered, he paced the room, while his
agony rose to a climax. "Ye gods! What do you think Miss Pratt
will think of the people of this town, when she's invited to meet
a few of my friends and the first thing she sees is a nigger in
his undershirt? What 'll she think when she finds that child's
eaten up half the food, and the people have to explain that the
dog in the front yard belongs to the darky&mdash;" He interrupted himself
with a groan: "And prob'ly she wouldn't believe it. Anybody'd
<em>SAY </em>they didn't own a dog like that! And that's what
you want her to see, before she even gets inside the house! Instead
of a regular gardener in livery like we ought to have, and a bulldog
or a good Airedale or a fox-hound, or something, the first things
you want intelligent people from out of town to see are that awful
old darky and his mongrel scratchin' fleas and like as not lettin'
'em get on other people! <em>THAT'</em>d be nice, wouldn't it?
Go out to tea expecting decent treatment and get fl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>WILLIE</em>!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter managed to obtain his attention. "If you'll go and
brush your hair I'll send Genesis and Clematis away for the rest
of the afternoon. And then if you 'll sit down quietly and try
to keep cool until your friends get here, I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Quietly'!" he echoed, shaking his head over this mystery. "I'm
the only one that IS quiet around here. Things 'd be in a fine
condition to receive guests if I didn't keep pretty cool, I guess!"</p>

<p>"There, there," she said, soothingly. "Go and brush your hair.
And change your collar, Willie; it's all wilted. I'll send Genesis
away."</p>

<p>His wandering eye failed to meet hers with any intelligence.
"Collar,"  he muttered, as if in soliloquy. "Collar."</p>

<p>"Change it!" said Mrs. Baxter, raising her voice. "It's <em>WILTED</em>."</p>

<p>He departed in a dazed manner.</p>

<p>Passing through the hall, he paused abruptly, his eye having
fallen with sudden disapproval upon a large, heavily framed, glass-covered
engraving, "The Battle of Gettysburg," which hung upon the wall,
near the front door. Undeniably, it was a picture feeble in decorative
quality; no doubt, too, William was right in thinking it as unworthy
of Miss Pratt, as were Jane and Genesis and Clematis. He felt
that she must never see it, especially as the frame had been chipped
and had a corner broken, but it was more pleasantly effective
where he found it than where (in his nervousness) he left it.
A few hasty jerks snapped the elderly green cords by which it
was suspended; then he laid the picture upon the floor and with
his handkerchief made a curious labyrinth of avenues in the large
oblong area of fine dust which this removal disclosed upon the
wall. Pausing to wipe his hot brow with the same implement, he
remembered that some one had made allusions to his collar and
hair, whereupon he sprang to the stairs, mounted two at a time,
rushed into his own room, and confronted his streaked image in
the mirror.</p>
