<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Peace was panic stricken. Almost at the last minute Miss Peyton
had changed her mind about the poem which she was to speak, and
had given her instead of "The Children's Hour" which she had so
carefully learned, those other lines called "Children"; and there
were only five days in which to learn them. Memorizing poetry,
particularly when she could not quite understand its meaning,
was not Peace's strong forte, and it was small wonder that she
was dismayed at this change of program; but it was useless to
protest. When Miss Peyton decided to do a certain thing, "all
the king's horses and all the king's men" could not alter her
decision. Peace had learned this from bitter experience and many
hours in the dark closet behind the teacher's desk. So, inwardly
raging, though outwardly calm, she accepted her fate, and marched
home to air her outraged sense of justice before the little parsonage
family, sure of sympathy and help in that quarter. Nor was she
disappointed.</p>

<p>Elizabeth recognized the small maid's failings as a student,
and was much provoked at Miss Peyton's want of understanding,
but very wisely kept these sentiments to herself, and set about
to help Peace in her difficult task. At her suggestion, the young
elocutionist waited until the following morning before beginning
her study of the new lines, and with the teacher's copied words
in her hand, went out to the hammock under the trees to be alone
with her work. There she sat swinging violently to and fro, gabbling
the stanzas line by line, while she ferociously jerked the short
curls on her forehead and frowned so fiercely that Elizabeth,
busy with her Saturday baking, could not resist smiling whenever
she chanced to pass the door, through which she could see the
familiar figure.</p>

<p>Slower and slower the red lips moved, lower and lower the hammock
swung, and finally with a gesture of utter despair, Peace cast
the paper from her, and dropped her head dejectedly into her hands.</p>

<p>"Poor youngster," murmured the flushed cook from the window where
she sat picking over berries. "John, have you a minute to spare?
Peace is in trouble &mdash;Oh, nothing but that new poem, but
I thought perhaps you might invent some easy way for her to memorize
it. You were always good at such things, and I can't stop until
my cake is out of the oven and the pies are made."</p>

<p>He assented promptly, and strolling out of the door as if for
a breath of fresh air, wandered across the grass to the motionless
figure in the hammock. "What seems to be the matter, chick?" he
inquired cheerfully, rescuing the discarded paper from the dirt
and handing it back to its owner.</p>

<p>"Oh, Saint John, this is a perfectly <em>dreadful</em> poem!
I don't b'lieve Longfellow ever wrote it, and even if he did,
I know I can <em>never</em> learn it. The verses haven't <em>any</em>
sense at <em>all</em>. Just listen to this!" She seized the sheet
with an angry little flirt, and read to the amazed man:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'Ye open the eastern windows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That look toward the sun,<br/>
Where shots are stinging swallows<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the brooks in mourning run.

</p>
<p>
"'What the leaves are to the forest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where light and air are stewed,<br/>
Ere their feet and slender juices<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have been buttoned into food,&mdash;

</p>
<p>
"'That to the world are children;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through them it feels the glow<br/>
Of a brighter and stunnier slimate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than scratches the trunks below.

</p>
<p>
"'Ye are better than all the ballots<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That ever were snug and dead;<br/>
For ye are living poets,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the blest ate bread.'"

</p>
</div>
<p>With difficulty the preacher controlled his desire to shout,
and mutely held out his hand for the paper, which he studied long
and carefully, for even to his experienced eyes, the hastily scribbled
words were hard to decipher. But when he had finished, all he
said was, "You have misread the lines, Peace. Wait and I will
get you the book from the library. Then you will see your mistake."</p>

<p>Shaking with suppressed mirth he went back to his study, found
the volume in question, and returned to the discouraged student
with it open in his hands. Half-heartedly Peace reached up for
it, but he shook his head, knowing how easy it was for her to
misread even printed words and what ludicrous blunders it often
led to, and gravely suggested, "Suppose I read it to you first.
Then if there is anything you do not understand, perhaps I can
explain it so it will be easier to memorize."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you just would!" Peace exclaimed gratefully. "I never
could read Miss Peyton's writing, and then she marks me down for
her own mistakes."</p>

<p>So in sonorous tones, the preacher read the poet's beautiful
tribute to childhood:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'Come to me, O ye children!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For I hear you at your play,<br/>
And the questions that perplexed me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have vanished quite away.

</p>
<p>
"'Ye open the eastern windows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That look towards the sun,<br/>
Where thoughts are singing swallows<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the brooks of morning run.

</p>
<p>
"'In your hearts are the birds and the sunshine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In your thoughts the brooklet's flow,<br/>
But in mine is the wind of Autumn<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the first fall of the snow.

</p>
<p>
"'Ah! what would the world be to us<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the children were no more?<br/>
We should dread the desert behind us<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Worse than the dark before.

</p>
<p>
"'What the leaves are to the forest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With light and air for food,<br/>
Ere their sweet and tender juices<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have been hardened into wood,&mdash;

</p>
<p>
"'That to the world are children;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through them it feels the glow<br/>
Of a brighter and sunnier climate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than reaches the trunks below.

</p>
<p>
"'Come to me, O ye children!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And whisper in my ear<br/>
What the birds and the winds are singing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In your sunny atmosphere.

</p>
<p>
"'For what are all our contrivings,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wisdom of our books,<br/>
When compared with your caresses,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the gladness of your looks?

</p>
<p>
"'Ye are better than all the ballads<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That ever were sung or said;<br/>
For ye are living poems,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the rest are dead.'"

</p>
</div>
<p>"Well," breathed Peace in evident relief, as he lingeringly repeated
the last stanza, "that sounds a little more like it. Maybe with
that book I can learn her old poem now."</p>

<p>"Those are beautiful verses, Peace," he rebuked her.</p>

<p>"Yes, I 'xpect they are. I haven't got any grudge against the
verses, but it takes a beautifully long time for me to learn anything
like that, too." She seized the fat volume with both hands, tipped
back among the hammock cushions, and with her feet swinging idly
back and forth, began an animated study of the right version of
the words, while the minister strolled back to the house to enjoy
the joke with Elizabeth.</p>

<p>But though Peace studied industriously and faithfully during
the remaining days, she could not seem to master the lines in
spite of all the minister's coaching, and in spite of Miss Peyton's
struggle with her after school each day.</p>

<p>"There is no sense in making such hard work of a simple little
poem like that," declared the teacher, closing her lips in a straight
line and looking very much exasperated after an hour's battle
with the child Tuesday afternoon. "You have just made up your
mind that you will learn it, and that is where the whole trouble
lies."</p>

<p>"That's where you are mistaken," sobbed Peace forlornly, though
her eyes flashed with indignation as she wiped away her tears.
"It's you which has got her mind made up, and you and me ain't
the same people. I just can't seem to make those words stick,
and I might as well give up trying right now."</p>

<p>"You will have that poem perfectly learned tomorrow afternoon,
or I shall know the reason why."</p>

<p>"Then I 'xpect you'll have to know the reason why," gulped the
unhappy little scholar, who found the hill of knowledge very steep
to climb. "You can't make a frog fly if you tried all your life.
It takes me a <em>month</em> to learn as big a poem as that, and
you never gave it to me until Friday afternoon."</p>

<p>"Nine four-line stanzas!" snapped the weary instructor, privately
thinking Peace the greatest, trial she had ever had to endure.</p>

<p>"It might as well be ninety," sighed the child. "If Elizabeth
was my teacher, or the Lilac Lady, I could get it in no time,
but I never could learn anything for some people. Just the sight
of them knocks everything I know clean out of my head."</p>

<p>Longfellow slammed shut with a terrific bang, and Miss Peyton
rose from her chair, choking with indignation. "You may go now,
Peace Greenfield," she said icily, "but that poem must be perfect
by tomorrow afternoon, remember."</p>

<p>So with a heavy heart Peace trudged home and took up her struggle
once more in the hammock; but was at last rewarded by being able
to say every line perfectly and without much hesitation. Elizabeth
and her spouse both heard her repeat it many times that evening
and again the next morning, and sent her on her way rejoicing
to think the task was conquered.</p>

<p>But when it came to the afternoon's rehearsal, poor Peace could
only stare at the ceiling, and open and shut her lips in agony,
waiting for the words which would not come, while Miss Peyton
impatiently tapped the floor with her slippered toe and frowned
angrily at the miserable figure. Finally Peace blurted out, "P'raps
if you'd go out of the room, I could say it all right."</p>

<p>"You will say it all right with me in the room!" retorted the
woman grimly.</p>

<p>"Then s'posing you look out of the window and quit staring so
hard at me. All I can think of is that scowl, and it doesn't help
a bit."</p>

<p>The dazed teacher shifted her gaze, and Peace slowly began, "'Come
to me, O ye children!'" speaking very distinctly and with more
expression than Miss Peyton had thought possible.</p>

<p>"There!" exclaimed the woman, much mollified, when the child
had finished. "I knew you could say it if you wanted to. Now try
it again."</p>

<p>So with the teacher staring out of the window, and Peace gazing
at the ceiling, the poem was recited without a flaw six times
in succession, and she was finally excused to put in some more
practice at home.</p>

<p>Elizabeth thought the day was won, but poor Peace took little
comfort in the knowledge that she had acquitted herself creditably
at the last rehearsal. "It would be different if that was tomorrow
afternoon," she sighed. "But I just know she'll look at me when
I get up to speak, and with her eyes boring holes through me,
I'll be sure to forget some part of it. None of my other teachers
were like her a bit. Miss Truesdale and Miss Olney and Miss Allen
all liked children; but I don't b'lieve Miss Peyton does. There's
lots of the scholars that she ain't going to let pass, and the
only reason they didn't have better lessons is 'cause she scares
it out of 'em. Oh, dear, school is such a funny thing!"</p>

<p>"Would you like to have me come to visit you tomorrow?" suggested
Elizabeth, who dreaded the ordeal almost as much as did Peace.</p>

<p>"No, you needn't mind. S'posing I should make a <em>frizzle</em>
of everything, you'd feel just terribly, I know, and I should,
too. I guess it will be bad enough with all the other mothers
there. But I wish there wasn't <em>going</em> to be any exercises.
I'm sick of 'em already. And what do you think now! She told us
only this afternoon that we must all have an <em>antidote</em>
for some of the Presidents to tell tomorrow for General Lesson."</p>

<p>"A what!"</p>

<p>"An <em>antidote</em>. A short story about some of the Presidents
of the United States."</p>

<p>"You mean anecdote, child. I didn't suppose you were old enough
to be studying history in your room."</p>

<p>"Oh, this ain't hist'ry! We have a calendar each month telling
what big men or women were born and why. Then teacher tells us
something about their lives. Lots of 'em are very int'resting,
but I can't remember which were Presidents and which were only
<em>manner-fracturers</em>. That's my trouble."</p>

<p>"Well, it just happens that I can help you out there, my girlie,"
smiled Elizabeth, smoothing the damp curls back from the flushed
cheeks. "John has a book in his library of just such things as
that. We'll get it and hunt up some nice, new stories that aren't
hoary with age."</p>

<p>The volume was quickly found, and several quaint anecdotes were
selected for the next day's program, so if by chance other pupils
had come prepared with some of them, there would be still others
for Peace to choose from. And when school-time came the next day,
she departed almost happily, with the Presidential book tucked
under one arm and the well-fingered Longfellow under the other;
for she meant to make sure that the words were fresh in her mind
before her turn came to recite.</p>

<p>The session began very auspiciously with some happy songs, and
Peace's spirits rose. Then came the drawing lesson. Peace was
no more of an artist than she was an elocutionist, but she tried
hard, and was working away industriously trying to paint the group
of grape leaves Miss Peyton had arranged on her desk, when one
of the little visitors slipped from his seat in his mother's lap
and wandered across the room to his sister's desk, which chanced
to be directly in front of Peace; so he could easily see what
she was doing. He watched her in silence a moment, and then demanded
in a stage whisper, "What you d'awing?"</p>

<p>"Grape leaves," Peace stopped chewing her tongue long enough
to answer.</p>

<p>"No, they ain't neither. They's piggies."</p>

<p>The brown head was quickly raised from her task, and the would-be
artist studied her work critically. The boy was right. They did
look somewhat like a litter of curly-tailed pigs. All they needed
were eyes and pointed ears. Mechanically Peace added these little
touches, made the snouts a little sharper, drew in two or three
legs to make them complete, and sat back in her seat to admire
the result of her work.</p>

<p>"Ah," simpered Miss Peyton, who had chanced to look up just that
minute, "Peace has finished her sketch. Bring it to the desk,
please, so we may all criticize it."</p>

<p>Peace had just dipped her brush into the hollow of her cake of
red paint, intending to make the piggies' noses pink, but at this
startling command from the teacher, she seemed suddenly turned
to an icicle. What could she do? She glanced around her in an
agony of despair, saw no loophole of escape, and gathering up
the unlucky sketch, she stumbled up the aisle to the desk, still
holding her scarlet-tipped paint brush in her hand.</p>

<p>Usually Miss Peyton examined the drawings herself before calling
upon the scholars to criticise; but this was the last day of school,
and the program was long; so she smiled her prettiest, and said
sweetly, "Hold it up for inspection, Peace."</p>

<p>Miserably Peace faced the roomful of scholars and parents, and
extended the drawing with a trembling hand. There was an ominous
hush, and then the whole audience broke into a yell of laughter.
Miss Peyton's face flushed scarlet, and holding out her hand she
said sharply, "Give it to me."</p>

<p>Peace wheeled about and dropped the sheet of pigs upon the desk,
but at that unfortunate moment, the paint-brush slipped from her
grasp and spilled a great, scarlet blot on the teacher's fresh
white waist. Dismayed, Peace could only stare at the ruin she
had wrought, having forgotten all about her drawing in wondering
what punishment would follow this second calamity; and Miss Peyton
had to speak twice before she came to her senses enough to know
that she was being ordered to her seat.</p>

<p>"Oh," she gasped in mingled surprise and relief, "lemon juice
and salt will take that stain out, if it won't fade away with
just washing."</p>

<p>Again an audible titter ran around the room, and the teacher,
furiously red, repeated for the third time, "Take your seat, Peace
Greenfield!"</p>

<p>Much mortified and confused, the child subsided in her place
and tried to hide her burning cheeks behind the covers of her
volume of anecdotes, but fate seemed against her, for Miss Peyton
promptly ordered the paint boxes put away, the desks cleared,
and the scholars to be prepared to tell the stories they had found.
Now it happened that generous-hearted Peace had lent her book
of Presidential reminiscences to several of her less lucky mates
that noon, and as she was one of the last to be called upon, she
listened with dismay as one after another of the tales she had
taken so much pains to learn were repeated by other scholars.</p>

<p>In order that all might hear what was said, each pupil marched
to the front of the room, told his little story and returned noiselessly
to his seat; so when it came Peace's turn, she stalked bravely
up the aisle, faced the throng of scared, perspiring children
and beaming mothers, made a profound bow, and said, "George Washington
was pock-marked."</p>

<p>She was well on her way to her seat again, when Miss Peyton's
crisp tones halted her: "Peace, you surely have something more
than that. Have you forgotten?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am. I lent my stories to the rest of the scholars this
noon and they have already spoke all I knew, 'xcept those that
are <em>hairy</em> with age. Everyone knows that George Washington
was bled to death by over-<em>jealous</em> doctors."</p>

<p>The harder Peace tried to do her best, the more blundering she
became; and now, feeling that the visitors were having great fun
at her expense, she sank into her seat and buried her face in
her arms, swallowing hard to keep back the tears that stung her
eyes.</p>

<p>Directly, she heard Patty Fellows reciting, "The Psalm of Life,"
and Sara Gray answer to her name with, "The Castle-Builder." Next,
the children sang another song, and then&mdash;horror of horrors! &mdash;Miss
Peyton called her name. It was too bad! Any other teacher would
have excused her, but she knew Miss Peyton never would. So with
a final gulp, she struggled to her feet and advanced once more
to the platform.</p>

<p>Her heart beat like a trip-hammer, her breath came in gasps,
and her mind seemed an utter blank. "'Come to me,'" prompted the
teacher, perceiving for the first time the child's panic and distress;
but Peace did not understand that this was her cue, and with a
despairing glance at the immovable face behind the desk, she cried
hastily, "Oh, not this time! I've thunk of it now. Here goes!</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'Between the dark and the daylight<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When the night is beginning to lower,<br/>
Comes a pause in the day's occupation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That is known as the Children's Hour.'"

</p>
</div>
<p>Verse after verse she repeated glibly, racing so rapidly that
the words fairly tumbled out of her mouth. Suddenly the dreadful
thought came to her. She had begun the wrong poem! Her voice faltered;
she turned pleading, glassy eyes toward the teacher; and Miss
Peyton, misunderstanding the cause of her hesitation, again prompted,
"'They climb&mdash;'"</p>

<p>Peace was hopelessly lost.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'They climb up onto the target,'"

</p>
</div>
<p>She recited in feverish tones:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'O'er my arms and the back of my hair;<br/>
If I try to e-scrape, they surround me;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They scream to me everywhere,'"

</p>
</div>
<p>Someone tittered; the ripple of mirth broke into a peal of laughter;
and with a despairing sob, Peace cried, "Oh, teacher, I've got
the stage-<em>strike</em>! I can't say another word!" And out
of the room she rushed like a wounded bird.</p>

<p>Usually Elizabeth was her comforter, but this day some blind
instinct led her to take refuge in the Enchanted Garden, and she
sobbed out her sorrow and humiliation in the skirts of her beloved
Lilac Lady.</p>

<p>Peace in tears was a new sight for the invalid, and she was alarmed
at the wild tempest of grief. But the small philosopher could
not be unhappy long, and after a few moments the tears ceased,
the storm was spent, a flushed, swollen face peeped up at the
anxious eyes above her, and with a familiar, queer little grimace,
she giggled, "I made 'em all laugh, anyway, and they did look
awful solemn and <em>funerally</em> lined up there against the
wall. But I s'pose teacher won't let me pass now, and I'll have
to take this term all over again."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it," said the lame girl gently, stroking the damp
curls on the round, brown head in her lap.</p>

<p>So Peace faithfully recounted the day's events to the amusement
and indignation of her lone audience; but when she had finished,
she sighed dolefully. "The worst of it is, I've got to go back
to school tomorrow for my books and dismissal card. Oh, mercy,
yes! And Miss Peyton has got my Longfellow. I don't b'lieve I
can ever ask her for it, even if it is Saint John's."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you can," assured the Lilac Lady. "By the time tomorrow
comes, the teacher will have forgotten all about the mistakes
of today."</p>

<p>"It's very plain that you don't know Miss Peyton," was the disconcerting
reply. "There's nothing she ever forgets. My one comfort is I
won't have to go to school to her next year even if she doesn't
let me pass now, 'cause by that time the girls will all be well
and I can go home again. There's always a grain of comfort in
every bit of trouble, grandma says."</p>

<p>"Sca-atter sunshine, all along the wa-ay," sang the lame girl,
surprised out of her long silence in her anxiety to cajole her
little playmate into her happy self again; but Peace did not even
hear the rich sweetness of the voice, so surprised was she to
have her motto turned upon her in that manner, and for a few moments
she sat so lost in thought that the lame girl feared she had offended
her, and was about to beg her forgiveness when the round face
lifted itself again, and Peace exclaimed, "That's what I'll do!
Tomorrow, when I have to go back for my card, I'll offer to kiss
her good-bye, and I'll tell her I'm sorry I've been such a bother
to her all these weeks. I never thought about it before, but I
s'pose she's just been in <em>ag-o-ny</em> over having me upset
all her plans like I've managed to do, though I never meant to.
The worse I try to follow what she tells us to do, the bigger
chase I lead her. My, what a time she must have had! Do you think
she she'd like to hear I'm sorry?"</p>

<p>"What a darling you are!" thought the lame girl. "I don't wonder
everyone loves you so much." But aloud she merely answered heartily,
"I think it is a beautiful plan, dear. When she understands that
you have tried your best to please her, I am sure she will be
kind to my little curly-head."</p>

<p>So it happened that when Peace received her dismissal card from
Miss Peyton the next morning, she lifted her rosy mouth for a
kiss, and murmured contritely, "I'm very sorry you have caused
me so much bother since I came here to school, but next term I
won't be here, for which you bet I'm thankful." She had rehearsed
that little speech over and over on her way to school; but, as
usual, when she came to say it to this argus-eyed teacher, she
juggled her pronouns so thoroughly that no one could have been
sure just what she did mean.</p>

<p>However, Miss Peyton had done some hard thinking since the previous
afternoon, and a little glimmer of understanding was beginning
to penetrate her methodical, order-loving soul, so she stooped
and kissed the forgiving lips raised to hers, as she said heartily,
"That is all right, my child. I wish I could erase all the troubles
that have marred these days for you. I am sorry I did not know
as much three months ago as I do now."</p>

<p>"I am, too, but folks are never too old to learn, grandpa says,"
Peace answered happily, and departed with beaming countenance,
for Miss Peyton had "passed her" after all.</p>
