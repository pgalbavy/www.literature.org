<p>On the first landing, Sorelli ran against the Comte de Chagny,
who was coming up-stairs. The count, who was generally so calm,
seemed greatly excited.</p>

<p>"I was just going to you," he said, taking off his hat.  "Oh,
Sorelli, what an evening!  And Christine Daae:  what a triumph!"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" said Meg Giry.  "Six months ago, she used to sing
like a <em>CROCK!  </em>But do let us get by, my dear count,"
continues the brat, with a saucy curtsey.  "We are going to inquire
after a poor man who was found hanging by the neck."</p>

<p>Just then the acting-manager came fussing past and stopped when
he heard this remark.</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed roughly.  "Have you girls heard already? 
Well, please forget about it for tonight&mdash;and above all don't
let M. Debienne and M. Poligny hear; it would upset them too much
on their last day."</p>

<p>They all went on to the foyer of the ballet, which was already
full of people.  The Comte de Chagny was right; no gala performance
ever equalled this one.  All the great composers of the day had
conducted their own works in turns.  Faure and Krauss had sung;
and, on that evening, Christine Daae had revealed her true self,
for the first time, to the astonished and enthusiastic audience. 
Gounod had conducted the Funeral March of a Marionnette; Reyer,
his beautiful overture to Siguar; Saint Saens, the Danse Macabre
and a Reverie Orientale; Massenet, an unpublished Hungarian march;
Guiraud, his Carnaval; Delibes, the Valse Lente from Sylvia and
the Pizzicati from Coppelia. Mlle. Krauss had sung the bolero
in the Vespri Siciliani; and Mlle. Denise Bloch the drinking song
in Lucrezia Borgia.</p>

<p>But the real triumph was reserved for Christine Daae, who had
begun by singing a few passages from Romeo and Juliet.  It was
the first time that the young artist sang in this work of Gounod,
which had not been transferred to the Opera and which was revived
at the Opera Comique after it had been produced at the old Theatre
Lyrique by Mme. Carvalho. Those who heard her say that her voice,
in these passages, was seraphic; but this was nothing to the superhuman
notes that she gave forth in the prison scene and the final trio
in <em>FAUST, </em>which she sang in the place of La Carlotta,
who was ill.  No one had ever heard or seen anything like it.</p>

<p>Daae revealed a new Margarita that night, a Margarita of a splendor,
a radiance hitherto unsuspected.  The whole house went mad, rising
to its feet, shouting, cheering, clapping, while Christine sobbed
and fainted in the arms of her fellow-singers and had to be carried
to her dressing-room. A few subscribers, however, protested. 
Why had so great a treasure been kept from them all that time? 
Till then, Christine Daae had played a good Siebel to Carlotta's
rather too splendidly material Margarita.  And it had needed Carlotta's
incomprehensible and inexcusable absence from this gala night
for the little Daae, at a moment's warning, to show all that she
could do in a part of the program reserved for the Spanish diva! 
Well, what the subscribers wanted to know was, why had Debienne
and Poligny applied to Daae, when Carlotta was taken ill?  Did
they know of her hidden genius?  And, if they knew of it, why
had they kept it hidden?  And why had she kept it hidden?  Oddly
enough, she was not known to have a professor of singing at that
moment.  She had often said she meant to practise alone for the
future.  The whole thing was a mystery.</p>

<p>The Comte de Chagny, standing up in his box, listened to all
this frenzy and took part in it by loudly applauding.  Philippe
Georges Marie Comte de Chagny was just forty-one years of age. 
He was a great aristocrat and a good-looking man, above middle
height and with attractive features, in spite of his hard forehead
and his rather cold eyes.  He was exquisitely polite to the women
and a little haughty to the men, who did not always forgive him
for his successes in society. He had an excellent heart and an
irreproachable conscience.  On the death of old Count Philibert,
he became the head of one of the oldest and most distinguished
families in France, whose arms dated back to the fourteenth century. 
The Chagnys owned a great deal of property; and, when the old
count, who was a widower, died, it was no easy task for Philippe
to accept the management of so large an estate.  His two sisters
and his brother, Raoul, would not hear of a division and waived
their claim to their shares, leaving themselves entirely in Philippe's
hands, as though the right of primogeniture had never ceased to
exist. When the two sisters married, on the same day, they received
their portion from their brother, not as a thing rightfully belonging
to them, but as a dowry for which they thanked him.</p>

<p>The Comtesse de Chagny, nee de Moerogis de La Martyniere, had
died in giving birth to Raoul, who was born twenty years after
his elder brother.  At the time of the old count's death, Raoul
was twelve years of age.  Philippe busied himself actively with
the youngster's education.  He was admirably assisted in this
work first by his sisters and afterward by an old aunt, the widow
of a naval officer, who lived at Brest and gave young Raoul a
taste for the sea.  The lad entered the Borda training-ship, finished
his course with honors and quietly made his trip round the world. 
Thanks to powerful influence, he had just been appointed a member
of the official expedition on board the Requin, which was to be
sent to the Arctic Circle in search of the survivors of the D'Artoi's
expedition, of whom nothing had been heard for three years.  Meanwhile,
he was enjoying a long furlough which would not be over for six
months; and already the dowagers of the Faubourg Saint-Germain
were pitying the handsome and apparently delicate stripling for
the hard work in store for him.</p>

<p>The shyness of the sailor-lad &mdash;I was almost saying his
innocence&mdash;was remarkable.  He seemed to have but just left the
women's apron-strings. As a matter of fact, petted as he was by
his two sisters and his old aunt, he had retained from this purely
feminine education manners that were almost candid and stamped
with a charm that nothing had yet been able to sully.  He was
a little over twenty-one years of age and looked eighteen.  He
had a small, fair mustache, beautiful blue eyes and a complexion
like a girl's.</p>

<p>Philippe spoiled Raoul.  To begin with, he was very proud of
him and pleased to foresee a glorious career for his junior in
the navy in which one of their ancestors, the famous Chagny de
La Roche, had held the rank of admiral.  He took advantage of
the young man's leave of absence to show him Paris, with all its
luxurious and artistic delights.  The count considered that, at
Raoul's age, it is not good to be too good.  Philippe himself
had a character that was very well-balanced in work and pleasure
alike; his demeanor was always faultless; and he was incapable
of setting his brother a bad example. He took him with him wherever
he went.  He even introduced him to the foyer of the ballet. 
I know that the count was said to be "on terms" with Sorelli. 
But it could hardly be reckoned as a crime for this nobleman,
a bachelor, with plenty of leisure, especially since his sisters
were settled, to come and spend an hour or two after dinner in
the company of a dancer, who, though not so very, very witty,
had the finest eyes that ever were seen!  And, besides, there
are places where a true Parisian, when he has the rank of the
Comte de Chagny, is bound to show himself; and at that time the
foyer of the ballet at the Opera was one of those places.</p>

<p>Lastly, Philippe would perhaps not have taken his brother behind
the scenes of the Opera if Raoul had not been the first to ask
him, repeatedly renewing his request with a gentle obstinacy which
the count remembered at a later date.</p>

<p>On that evening, Philippe, after applauding the Daae, turned
to Raoul and saw that he was quite pale.</p>

<p>"Don't you see," said Raoul, "that the woman's fainting?"</p>

<p>"You look like fainting yourself," said the count.  "What's the
matter?"</p>

<p>But Raoul had recovered himself and was standing up.</p>

<p>"Let's go and see," he said, "she never sang like that before."</p>

<p>The count gave his brother a curious smiling glance and seemed
quite pleased. They were soon at the door leading from the house
to the stage.  Numbers of subscribers were slowly making their
way through. Raoul tore his gloves without knowing what he was
doing and Philippe had much too kind a heart to laugh at him for
his impatience.  But he now understood why Raoul was absent-minded
when spoken to and why he always tried to turn every conversation
to the subject of the Opera.</p>

<p>They reached the stage and pushed through the crowd of gentlemen,
scene-shifters, supers and chorus-girls, Raoul leading the way,
feeling that his heart no longer belonged to him, his face set
with passion, while Count Philippe followed him with difficulty
and continued to smile.  At the back of the stage, Raoul had to
stop before the inrush of the little troop of ballet-girls who
blocked the passage which he was trying to enter.  More than one
chaffing phrase darted from little made-up lips, to which he did
not reply; and at last he was able to pass, and dived into the
semi-darkness of a corridor ringing with the name of "Daae!  Daae!" 
The count was surprised to find that Raoul knew the way.  He had
never taken him to Christine's himself and came to the conclusion
that Raoul must have gone there alone while the count stayed talking
in the foyer with Sorelli, who often asked him to wait until it
was her time to "go on" and sometimes handed him the little gaiters
in which she ran down from her dressing-room to preserve the spotlessness
of her satin dancing-shoes and her flesh-colored tights.  Sorelli
had an excuse; she had lost her mother.</p>

<p>Postponing his usual visit to Sorelli for a few minutes, the
count followed his brother down the passage that led to Daae's
dressing-room and saw that it had never been so crammed as on
that evening, when the whole house seemed excited by her success
and also by her fainting fit. For the girl had not yet come to;
and the doctor of the theater had just arrived at the moment when
Raoul entered at his heels.  Christine, therefore, received the
first aid of the one, while opening her eyes in the arms of the
other.  The count and many more remained crowding in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Don't you think, Doctor, that those gentlemen had better clear
the room?" asked Raoul coolly.  "There's no breathing here."</p>

<p>"You're quite right," said the doctor.</p>

<p>And he sent every one away, except Raoul and the maid, who looked
at Raoul with eyes of the most undisguised astonishment.  She
had never seen him before and yet dared not question him; and
the doctor imagined that the young man was only acting as he did
because he had the right to.  The viscount, therefore, remained
in the room watching Christine as she slowly returned to life,
while even the joint managers, Debienne and Poligny, who had come
to offer their sympathy and congratulations, found themselves
thrust into the passage among the crowd of dandies. The Comte
de Chagny, who was one of those standing outside, laughed:</p>

<p>"Oh, the rogue, the rogue!"  And he added, under his breath:
"Those youngsters with their school-girl airs!  So he's a Chagny
after all!"</p>

<p>He turned to go to Sorelli's dressing-room, but met her on the
way, with her little troop of trembling ballet-girls, as we have
seen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Christine Daae uttered a deep sigh, which was answered
by a groan.  She turned her head, saw Raoul and started.  She
looked at the doctor, on whom she bestowed a smile, then at her
maid, then at Raoul again.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," she said, in a voice not much above a whisper, "who
are you?"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," replied the young man, kneeling on one knee and
pressing a fervent kiss on the diva's hand, "I AM <em>THE LITTLE
BOY WHO WENT INTO THE SEA TO RESCUE YOUR SCARF</em>."</p>

<p>Christine again looked at the doctor and the maid; and all three
began to laugh.</p>

<p>Raoul turned very red and stood up.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," he said, "since you are pleased not to recognize
me, I should like to say something to you in private, something
very important."</p>

<p>"When I am better, do you mind?"  And her voice shook.  "You
have been very good."</p>

<p>"Yes, you must go," said the doctor, with his pleasantest smile.
"Leave me to attend to mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"I am not ill now," said Christine suddenly, with strange and
unexpected energy.</p>

<p>She rose and passed her hand over her eyelids.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Doctor.  I should like to be alone.  Please go away,
all of you.  Leave me.  I feel very restless this evening."</p>

<p>The doctor tried to make a short protest, but, perceiving the
girl's evident agitation, he thought the best remedy was not to
thwart her. And he went away, saying to Raoul, outside:</p>

<p>"She is not herself to-night. She is usually so gentle."</p>

<p>Then he said good night and Raoul was left alone.  The whole
of this part of the theater was now deserted.  The farewell ceremony
was no doubt taking place in the foyer of the ballet.  Raoul thought
that Daae might go to it and he waited in the silent solitude,
even hiding in the favoring shadow of a doorway.  He felt a terrible
pain at his heart and it was of this that he wanted to speak to
Daae without delay.</p>

<p>Suddenly the dressing-room door opened and the maid came out
by herself, carrying bundles.  He stopped her and asked how her
mistress was.  The woman laughed and said that she was quite well,
but that he must not disturb her, for she wished to be left alone. 
And she passed on.  One idea alone filled Raoul's burning brain: 
of course, Daae wished to be left alone <em>FOR HIM!  </em>Had
he not told her that he wanted to speak to her privately?</p>

<p>Hardly breathing, he went up to the dressing-room and, with his
ear to the door to catch her reply, prepared to knock.  But his
hand dropped. He had heard A <em>MAN'S VOICE </em>in the dressing-room,
saying, in a curiously masterful tone:</p>

<p>"Christine, you must love me!"</p>

<p>And Christine's voice, infinitely sad and trembling, as though
accompanied by tears, replied:</p>

<p>"How can you talk like that?  <em>WHEN I SING ONLY FOR YOU</em>!"</p>

<p>Raoul leaned against the panel to ease his pain.  His heart,
which had seemed gone for ever, returned to his breast and was
throbbing loudly. The whole passage echoed with its beating and
Raoul's ears were deafened.  Surely, if his heart continued to
make such a noise, they would hear it inside, they would open
the door and the young man would be turned away in disgrace. 
What a position for a Chagny!  To be caught listening behind a
door!  He took his heart in his two hands to make it stop.</p>

<p>The man's voice spoke again:  "Are you very tired?"</p>

<p>"Oh, to-night I gave you my soul and I am dead!"  Christine replied.</p>

<p>"Your soul is a beautiful thing, child," replied the grave man's
voice, "and I thank you.  No emperor ever received so fair a gift. 
<em>THE ANGELS WEPT TONIGHT</em>."</p>

<p>Raoul heard nothing after that.  Nevertheless, he did not go
away, but, as though he feared lest he should be caught, he returned
to his dark corner, determined to wait for the man to leave the
room.  At one and the same time, he had learned what love meant,
and hatred.  He knew that he loved.  He wanted to know whom he
hated.  To his great astonishment, the door opened and Christine
Daae appeared, wrapped in furs, with her face hidden in a lace
veil, alone.  She closed the door behind her, but Raoul observed
that she did not lock it.  She passed him.  He did not even follow
her with his eyes, for his eyes were fixed on the door, which
did not open again.</p>

<p>When the passage was once more deserted, he crossed it, opened
the door of the dressing-room, went in and shut the door.  He
found himself in absolute darkness.  The gas had been turned out.</p>

<p>"There is some one here!" said Raoul, with his back against the
closed door, in a quivering voice.  "What are you hiding for?"</p>

<p>All was darkness and silence.  Raoul heard only the sound of
his own breathing.  He quite failed to see that the indiscretion
of his conduct was exceeding all bounds.</p>

<p>"You shan't leave this until I let you!" he exclaimed.  "If you
don't answer, you are a coward!  But I'll expose you!"</p>

<p>And he struck a match.  The blaze lit up the room.  There was
no one in the room!  Raoul, first turning the key in the door,
lit the gas-jets. He went into the dressing-closet, opened the
cupboards, hunted about, felt the walls with his moist hands. 
Nothing!</p>

<p>"Look here!" he said, aloud.  "Am I going mad?"</p>

<p>He stood for ten minutes listening to the gas flaring in the
silence of the empty room; lover though he was, he did not even
think of stealing a ribbon that would have given him the perfume
of the woman he loved. He went out, not knowing what he was doing
nor where he was going.  At a given moment in his wayward progress,
an icy draft struck him in the face.  He found himself at the
bottom of a staircase, down which, behind him, a procession of
workmen were carrying a sort of stretcher, covered with a white
sheet.</p>

<p>"Which is the way out, please?" he asked of one of the men.</p>

<p>"Straight in front of you, the door is open.  But let us pass."</p>

<p>Pointing to the stretcher, he asked mechanically:  "What's that?"</p>

<p>The workmen answered:</p>

<p>"'That' is Joseph Buquet, who was found in the third cellar,
hanging between a farm-house and a scene from the <em>ROI DE LAHORE</em>."</p>

<p>He took off his hat, fell back to make room for the procession
and went out.</p>
