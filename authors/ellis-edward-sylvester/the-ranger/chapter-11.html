<p>In a short time the whole body of Indians were awake and astir.
The morning meal was soon prepared and hastily eaten, and they
set forward. Leland found that his wound was much better, and
he traveled without difficulty. The savages took a southerly direction,
and appeared to be journeying toward the destination of those
who held Rosalind.</p>

<p>Their march continued without interruption until noon, when they
halted for a couple of hours for rest and food. For the first
time, George partook of some, and felt in a more hopeful frame
of mind. Zeb was as usual, and continued quarreling and abusing
and threatening every one within his reach.</p>

<p>"If dis isn't shameful, treating a pusson like me in dis way.
I's sorry dat I ever come wid you. I 'spects ebery bone in my
body is broke in pieces."</p>

<p>"You said last night that they dare not touch you," interrupted
Leland.</p>

<p>"Well, dat's a subject dat you can't understand, and I haven't
time to 'splain it. Dey're perwoken, anyhow, and dey's agwine
to cotch dar pay some ob dese days."</p>

<p>Consoled with this reflection, Zeb kept steadily upon his way,
seemingly as happy as a person could be when laboring under a
slight provocation. No further words passed between him and Leland
for a considerable time. The latter was busy with his own thoughts,
and began to feel the fatigues of their long-continued journey.
They had set out at an early hour, and had halted only at noon.
The traveling was very difficult at times, often leading through
tangled underwood and swamps, where a person's weight bore him
deep into the mire; and now and then some sluggish, poisonous
serpent crawled from beneath their feet, or hissed at them from
some decayed tree.</p>

<p>About the middle of the afternoon they paused upon the banks
of a stream of considerable size, which was a tributary to the
Big Sandy. Though broad, it was not deep, and could be easily
forded. The water flowed quite swiftly, and being perfectly translucent,
the bottom could be seen from either shore.</p>

<p>Here the Indians exhibited their usual cunning and foresight.
During their journey, they had proceeded in "Indian file," permitting
their prisoners, however, to walk after their usual manner. The
reason for their adopting the caution mentioned with themselves,
was more from habit than anything else. Although suspecting they
might be pursued, yet they had little fear of an enemy, and omitted,
as we have seen, to employ a sentinel at night.</p>

<p>One of the savages stepped into the water, and, taking a few
steps, was followed by another, who placed his feet upon the stones,
in the tracks that he had used and made. Thus each one did until
Leland and Zeb were driven in and warned to do likewise. The former
had no difficulty in obeying, but the latter, either through mistake
or design, made several provoking blunders. He seemed to use his
utmost endeavors to step into the tracks of those before him,
but instead of succeeding, was sure to place his foot a good distance
from it; and losing his foothold when about in the center of the
stream, came down with an awkward splash into the water.</p>

<p>"Gorra!" he exclaimed, regaining his position, "dat fish pulled
awful." The savages nearest cast threatening looks toward him,
and he reached the shore without further mishap.</p>

<p>At about sundown the party came to a halt, and a fire was started.
Leland and Zeb found themselves in the same condition as upon
the preceding night, with the exception that a closer surveillance
was kept upon their actions. George partook sparingly of supper,
while Zeb's appetite was as insatiate as ever. A guard was stationed
as soon as it was fully dark, and the Indians appeared disposed
to amuse and enjoy themselves until a late hour. One of their
number, with a hoarse, guttural "Ugh!" approached the negro.</p>

<p>"You needn't come here," ejaculated Zeb, divining his intention.
The savage paid no attention to him, but continued approaching.
Had the negro been free, he might have offered resistance and
occasioned considerable trouble; but besides having his arms bound;
his legs were joined at the ankles and he was thus rendered helpless.</p>

<p>"Plenty wool," said the savage, placing his hand upon his head.
He made no answer, but glanced furtively and suspiciously at him.
"Nice, good," he added; then closing his hand, gave a vigorous
jerk.</p>

<p>"Lord help me!" screamed Zeb, rolling over in helpless agony.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow," repeated the Indian, approaching him and rubbing
his back, after the manner which a celebrated horse-tamer advises.
Then, watching his opportunity, he seized another quantity and
pulled it forth. To his surprise, this elicited no remark from
his victim, and he repeated it.</p>

<p>This time he succeeded no better than before.</p>

<p>Zeb was lying upon his back and staring at his tormentor in unspeakable
fury. The Indian, still determined upon amusement, again approached.
Zeb remained motionless until he stooped over him; then bending
his knees to his chin, he gathered all his strength, and planted
both feet in his chest, throwing him a dozen feet. The savage
groaned and doubled up in his agony, and gasped spasmodically
for breath.</p>

<p>"Dar, how does dat set on your stummich? Yah! yah! dat's fun!"</p>

<p>Although this for the moment amused the others, yet it likewise
excited their anger, and there is no telling what the end would
have been, had not their attention been suddenly called in another
direction. This was occasioned by the arrival of a stranger among
them.</p>

<p>Leland gazed at the new-comer, and saw a tall, powerfully-built
and well-shaped savage stalk boldly forward toward the fire, and
exchange salutations with those seated around. All regarded him
suspiciously at first, yet his boldness and assurance seemed to
disarm them, and room was made for him. The pipe was passed to
him, and taking it, he smoked several minutes in silence, during
which time he seemed unconscious that the eye of every one was
bent upon him. Having finished, he turned and passed it to the
one nearest him, then gazing thoughtfully for a few moments in
the fire, commenced a conversation with the chief. He spoke their
tongue as correctly and fluently as any of them, which served
to disarm them still more. He stated that he had been out with
a couple of Indians, scouring the country for prey, when they
were set upon and pursued by two hunters, who at the first shot
killed his companion. He succeeded in effecting his escape after
a hot pursuit of nearly a day, and encountering a trail which
he supposed to be his friends', he followed it up and found that
he was not mistaken.</p>

<p>On hearing this recital, several of the savages appeared to suspect
that Kent and Leland were the two to whom he referred, and directed
his attention toward their captives. The savage stared wonderingly
toward them for a moment, and slowly shook his head. He had never
seen either before.</p>

<p>Although none of the Indians could show any reason for suspecting
their visitor, except his strange arrival among them, still they
were not reckless and foolish enough to leave him to himself,
or to permit him to depart. Besides the two who were stationed
at a distance as sentinels, one remained awake to keep an eye
upon his movements. Yet this precaution was useless; for to all
appearances, he slept as deeply as any of them, and was among
the latest who awoke in the morning.</p>

<p>Leland fell asleep about midnight, and gained a few hours of
undisturbed rest. In the morning he was considerably refreshed,
and had it not been for the awful doom that threatened him, would
have possessed a joyous fund of spirits. His wound, which had
been only an ugly flesh one, had ceased to trouble him, and he
experienced no pain except from the ligaments that bound him.
As he increased in strength, these were increased in number and
tightness, until his limbs swelled and pained him more than his
hurt.</p>

<p>It is the same with the body as with the mind. The sorest affliction
that can visit us will not occasion half the murmuring and discontent
that the petty annoyances and grievances of every-day life do.
Could the pain which harassed Leland, and in the end nearly drove
him frantic, have been concentrated into a few moments, or even
into a half-hour, he could have borne it without a murmur; but
it was the continual, never-ceasing, monotonous length of it that
troubled him.</p>

<p>Several times in the course of their journey, Leland was upon
the point of beseeching his enemies to kill him at once, and end
his misery; and had he reason to believe that they would have
gratified him, he would not have hesitated a moment; but such
a request would have been useless.</p>

<p>At noon, as usual, the party came to a halt, and a couple proceeded
to bind Leland to a tree. During the proceeding he broke the cords
that pained him so much, and they were replaced by others. The
latter, however, were much more lax, and he felt greatly relieved
when they were placed upon him.</p>

<p>As soon as he was secured to the body of the tree, the savage
left him and joined his companions. Leland closed his eyes as
if to shut out the terrible reality, and the dancing lights that
flickered before him, together with the hum that filled his ears,
told him that for a moment he had succeeded. But he was soon recalled
to a sense of his situation by the <em>zip</em> of a tomahawk
within a few inches of his head. Opening his eyes, he soon comprehended
the state of things. The savages were amusing themselves by ascertaining
who could send his tomahawk nearest the body of their captive
without touching him. The first weapon that had been sent had
missed his head, as we have said, by a few inches; but the next
was still closer, and Leland felt the wind of it, as it buried
itself in the solid oak by his cheek. He again closed his eyes,
and fervently prayed that one of their hatchets might sink into
his skull instead of the tree; yet there was not much danger of
such an occurrence; for the savages exercised perfect skill, and
rarely failed of sending their weapons to the very point intended.</p>

<p>[Illustration: The savages were amusing themselves by ascertaining

<p>Leland opened his eyes as a tomahawk came fearfully close to
his forehead. He wished to see who had hurled it. He soon saw
that it was the strange Indian, who was approaching to withdraw
it. It was buried deeper than the others; and as the savage placed
his hand upon it, it required considerable of an effort to extricate
it. While doing so, Leland heard the following words whispered
by the stranger:</p>

<p>"Don't be scart, George; it's Kent Whiteman that has got his
eye upon you."</p>

<p>These words came near proving fatal to both. They so startled
Leland that he could not prevent himself from betraying somewhat
his emotion and excitement. This was observed by a savage near
at hand, who approached to satisfy himself of the cause. Leland,
suspecting his motive, repeated the action and accompanied it
by a shudder, as though the scene which was being enacted had
overcome him. This satisfied the wily Indian, who retreated and
joined the others.</p>

<p>Hope was again awakened in Leland's breast&mdash;painful hope, that
increased his doubts and fears&mdash;hope that drowned the torture
that beset him&mdash;hope that sent the life-blood coursing rapidly
and hotly through his veins, and increased the charms which life
had held out to him.</p>

<p>Leland was shortly released from his unenviable situation, and
Zeb put in his place. The negro made no threats or declaration,
but submitted to the trying ordeal without a word. The scenes
through which he had passed had evidently had some effect upon
him. He seemed to possess a faint realization of the danger in
which he and his companion were placed. And yet it could not be
said that he was really frightened, for he evinced no fear of
any of his enemies, and his silence had the appearance of being
occasioned by sullenness and apathy. He did not tremble in the
least, but gazed unflinchingly at the tomahawks, as they came
revolving and seemingly directed toward his head, and struck beside
him.</p>

<p>Finding that they had about lost their power over their captives,
the Indians released Zeb, and permitted him and his master to
lie down upon the ground.</p>

<p>Leland could not prevent his gaze from wandering toward Kent
now and then, yet their eyes did not meet. The latter betrayed
no interest whatever in either of the captives, and seemed as
indifferent to their fate as any of the others.</p>

<p>The negro had no suspicion of the true state of things, and perhaps
it was best that he had not. He might have unwittingly betrayed
it, and Kent did not choose to warn him. The fact was, it could
have done him but little good at any rate; for Kent had determined
to rescue Leland, if possible, and leave Zeb for the present to
shift for himself. The white <em>man</em> was the first upon whom
they would wreak their vengeance, and aside from the greater estimation
in which his life was held, from the very nature of the case,
he required the first attention.</p>
