"Foot and eye opposed<br/>
In dubious strife."<br/>

<p>"And so here's Rugby, sir, at last, and you'll be in plenty of
time for dinner at the School-house, as I telled you," said the
old guard, pulling his horn out of its case and tootle-tooing
away, while the coachman shook up his horses, and carried them
along the side of the school close, round Dead-man's corner, past
the school-gates, and down the High Street to the Spread Eagle,
the wheelers in a spanking trot, and leaders cantering, in a style
which would not have disgraced "Cherry Bob," "ramping, stamping,
tearing, swearing Billy Harwood," or any other of the old coaching
heroes.</p>

<p>Tom's heart beat quick as he passed the great schoolfield or
close, with its noble elms, in which several games at football
were going on, and tried to take in at once the long line of gray
buildings, beginning with the chapel, and ending with the School-house,
the residence of the head-master, where the great flag was lazily
waving from the highest round tower. And he began already to be
proud of being a Rugby boy, as he passed the schoolgates, with
the oriel window above, and saw the boys standing there, looking
as if the town belonged to them, and nodding in a familiar manner
to the coachman, as if any one of them would be quite equal to
getting on the box, and working the team down street as well as
he.</p>

<p>One of the young heroes, however, ran out from the rest, and
scrambled up behind; where, having righted himself, and nodded
to the guard, with "How do, Jem?" he turned short round to Tom,
and after looking him over for a minute, began,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, you fellow, is your name Brown?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom, in considerable astonishment, glad, however,
to have lighted on some one already who seemed to know him.</p>

<p>"Ah, I thought so. You know my old aunt, Miss East. She lives
somewhere down your way in Berkshire. She wrote to me that you
were coming to-day, and asked me to give you a lift."</p>

<p>Tom was somewhat inclined to resent the patronizing air of his
new friend, a boy of just about his own height and age, but gifted
with the most transcendent coolness and assurance, which Tom felt
to be aggravating and hard to bear, but couldn't for the life
of him help admiring and envying&mdash;especially when young my lord
begins hectoring two or three long loafing fellows, half porter,
half stableman, with a strong touch of the blackguard, and in
the end arranges with one of them, nicknamed Cooey, to carry Tom's
luggage up to the School-house for sixpence.</p>

<p>"And hark 'ee, Cooey; it must be up in ten minutes, or no more
jobs from me. Come along, Brown." And away swaggers the young
potentate, with his hands in his pockets, and Tom at his side.</p>

<p>"All right, sir," says Cooey, touching his hat, with a leer and
a wink at his companions.</p>

<p>"Hullo though," says East, pulling up, and taking another look
at Tom; "this'll never do. Haven't you got a hat? We never wear
caps here. Only the louts wear caps. Bless you, if you were to
go into the quadrangle with that thing on, I don't know what'd
happen." The very idea was quite beyond young Master East, and
he looked unutterable things.</p>

<p>Tom thought his cap a very knowing affair, but confessed that
he had a hat in his hat-box; which was accordingly at once extracted
from the hind-boot, and Tom equipped in his go-to-meeting roof,
as his new friend called it. But this didn't quite suit his fastidious
taste in another minute, being too shiny; so, as they walk up
the town, they dive into Nixon's the hatter's, and Tom is arrayed,
to his utter astonishment, and without paying for it, in a regulation
cat-skin at seven-and-sixpence, Nixon undertaking to send the
best hat up to the matron's room, School-house, in half an hour.</p>

<p>"You can send in a note for a tile on Monday, and make it all
right, you know," said Mentor; "we're allowed two seven-and-sixers
a half, besides what we bring from home."</p>

<p>Tom by this time began to be conscious of his new social position
and dignities, and to luxuriate in the realized ambition of being
a public school-boy at last, with a vested right of spoiling two
seven-and-sixers in half a year.</p>

<p>"You see," said his friend, as they strolled up towards the school-gates,
in explanation of his conduct, "a great deal depends on how a
fellow cuts up at first. If he's got nothing odd about him, and
answers straightforward, and holds his head up, he gets on. Now,
you'll do very well as to rig, all but that cap. You see I'm doing
the handsome thing by you, because my father knows yours; besides,
I want to please the old lady. She gave me half a sov. this half,
and perhaps'll double it next, if I keep in her good books."</p>

<p>There's nothing for candour like a lower-school boy, and East
was a genuine specimen&mdash;frank, hearty, and good-natured, well-satisfied
with himself and his position, and choke-full of life and spirits,
and all the Rugby prejudices and traditions which he had been
able to get together in the long course of one half-year during
which he had been at the School-house.</p>

<p>And Tom, notwithstanding his bumptiousness, felt friends with
him at once, and began sucking in all his ways and prejudices,
as fast as he could understand them.</p>

<p>East was great in the character of cicerone. He carried Tom through
the great gates, where were only two or three boys. These satisfied
themselves with the stock questions, "You fellow, what's your
name? Where do you come from? How old are you? Where do you board?"
and, "What form are you in?" And so they passed on through the
quadrangle and a small courtyard, upon which looked down a lot
of little windows (belonging, as his guide informed him, to some
of the School-house studies), into the matron's room, where East
introduced Tom to that dignitary; made him give up the key of
his trunk, that the matron might unpack his linen, and told the
story of the hat and of his own presence of mind: upon the relation
whereof the matron laughingly scolded him for the coolest new
boy in the house; and East, indignant at the accusation of newness,
marched Tom off into the quadrangle, and began showing him the
schools, and examining him as to his literary attainments; the
result of which was a prophecy that they would be in the same
form, and could do their lessons together.</p>

<p>"And now come in and see my study&mdash;we shall have just time before
dinner; and afterwards, before calling over, we'll do the close."</p>

<p>Tom followed his guide through the School-house hall, which opens
into the quadrangle. It is a great room, thirty feet long and
eighteen high, or thereabouts, with two great tables running the
whole length, and two large fireplaces at the side, with blazing
fires in them, at one of which some dozen boys were standing and
lounging, some of whom shouted to East to stop; but he shot through
with his convoy, and landed him in the long, dark passages, with
a large fire at the end of each, upon which the studies opened.
Into one of these, in the bottom passage, East bolted with our
hero, slamming and bolting the door behind them, in case of pursuit
from the hall, and Tom was for the first time in a Rugby boy's
citadel.</p>

<p>He hadn't been prepared for separate studies, and was not a little
astonished and delighted with the palace in question.</p>

<p>It wasn't very large, certainly, being about six feet long by
four broad. It couldn't be called light, as there were bars and
a grating to the window; which little precautions were necessary
in the studies on the ground-floor looking out into the close,
to prevent the exit of small boys after locking up, and the entrance
of contraband articles. But it was uncommonly comfortable to look
at, Tom thought. The space under the window at the farther end
was occupied by a square table covered with a reasonably clean
and whole red and blue check tablecloth; a hard-seated sofa covered
with red stuff occupied one side, running up to the end, and making
a seat for one, or by sitting close, for two, at the table and
a good stout wooden chair afforded a seat to another boy, so that
three could sit and work together. The walls were wainscoted half-way
up, the wainscot being covered with green baize, the remainder
with a bright-patterned paper, on which hung three or four prints
of dogs' heads; Grimaldi winning the Aylesbury steeple-chase;
Amy Robsart, the reigning Waverley beauty of the day; and Tom
Crib, in a posture of defence, which did no credit to the science
of that hero, if truly represented. Over the door were a row of
hat-pegs, and on each side bookcases with cupboards at the bottom,
shelves and cupboards being filled indiscriminately with school-books,
a cup or two, a mouse-trap and candlesticks, leather straps, a
fustian bag, and some curious-looking articles which puzzled Tom
not a little, until his friend explained that they were climbing-irons,
and showed their use. A cricket-bat and small fishing-rod stood
up in one corner.</p>

<p>This was the residence of East and another boy in the same form,
and had more interest for Tom than Windsor Castle, or any other
residence in the British Isles. For was he not about to become
the joint owner of a similar home, the first place he could call
his own? One's own! What a charm there is in the words! How long
it takes boy and man to find out their worth! How fast most of
us hold on to them&mdash;faster and more jealously, the nearer we are
to that general home into which we can take nothing, but must
go naked as we came into the world! When shall we learn that he
who multiplieth possessions multiplieth troubles, and that the
one single use of things which we call our own is that they may
be his who hath need of them?</p>

<p>"And shall I have a study like this too?" said Tom.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course; you'll be chummed with some fellow on Monday,
and you can sit here till then."</p>

<p>"What nice places!"</p>

<p>"They're well enough," answered East, patronizingly, "only uncommon
cold at nights sometimes. Gower&mdash;that's my chum&mdash;and I make a
fire with paper on the floor after supper generally, only that
makes it so smoky."</p>

<p>"But there's a big fire out in the passage," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Precious little we get out of that, though," said East. "Jones
the praepostor has the study at the fire end, and he has rigged
up an iron rod and green baize curtain across the passage, which
he draws at night, and sits there with his door open; so he gets
all the fire, and hears if we come out of our studies after eight,
or make a noise. However, he's taken to sitting in the fifth-form
room lately, so we do get a bit of fire now sometimes; only to
keep a sharp lookout that he don't catch you behind his curtain
when he comes down&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>A quarter past one now struck, and the bell began tolling for
dinner; so they went into the hall and took their places, Tom
at the very bottom of the second table, next to the praepostor
(who sat at the end to keep order there), and East a few paces
higher. And now Tom for the first time saw his future school-fellows
in a body. In they came, some hot and ruddy from football or long
walks, some pale and chilly from hard reading in their studies,
some from loitering over the fire at the pastrycook's, dainty
mortals, bringing with them pickles and saucebottles to help them
with their dinners. And a great big-bearded man, whom Tom took
for a master, began calling over the names, while the great joints
were being rapidly carved on the third table in the corner by
the old verger and the housekeeper. Tom's turn came last, and
meanwhile he was all eyes, looking first with awe at the great
man, who sat close to him, and was helped first, and who read
a hard-looking book all the time he was eating; and when he got
up and walked off to the fire, at the small boys round him, some
of whom were reading, and the rest talking in whispers to one
another, or stealing one another's bread, or shooting pellets,
or digging their forks through the tablecloth. However, notwithstanding
his curiosity, he managed to make a capital dinner by the time
the big man called "Stand up!" and said grace.</p>

<p>As soon as dinner was over, and Tom had been questioned by such
of his neighbours as were curious as to his birth, parentage,
education, and other like matters, East, who evidently enjoyed
his new dignity of patron and mentor, proposed having a look at
the close, which Tom, athirst for knowledge, gladly assented to;
and they went out through the quadrangle and past the big fives
court, into the great playground.</p>

<p>"That's the chapel, you see," said East; "and there, just behind
it, is the place for fights. You see it's most out of the way
of the masters, who all live on the other side, and don't come
by here after first lesson or callings-over. That's when the fights
come off. And all this part where we are is the little-side ground,
right up to the trees; and on the other side of the trees is the
big-side ground, where the great matches are played. And there's
the island in the farthest corner; you'll know that well enough
next half, when there's island fagging. I say, it's horrid cold;
let's have a run across." And away went East, Tom close behind
him. East was evidently putting his best foot foremost; and Tom,
who was mighty proud of his running, and not a little anxious
to show his friend that, although a new boy, he was no milksop,
laid himself down to work in his very best style. Right across
the close they went, each doing all he knew, and there wasn't
a yard between them when they pulled up at the island moat.</p>

<p>"I say," said East, as soon as he got his wind, looking with
much increased respect at Tom, "you ain't a bad scud, not by no
means. Well, I'm as warm as a toast now."</p>

<p>"But why do you wear white trousers in November?" said Tom. He
had been struck by this peculiarity in the costume of almost all
the School-house boys.</p>

<p>"Why, bless us, don't you know? No; I forgot. Why, to-day's the
School-house match. Our house plays the whole of the School at
football. And we all wear white trousers, to show 'em we don't
care for hacks. You're in luck to come to-day. You just will see
a match; and Brooke's going to let me play in quarters. That's
more than he'll do for any other lower-school boy, except James,
and he's fourteen."</p>

<p>"Who's Brooke?"</p>

<p>"Why, that big fellow who called over at dinner, to be sure.
He's cock of the school, and head of the School-house side, and
the best kick and charger in Rugby."</p>

<p>"Oh, but do show me where they play. And tell me about it. I
love football so, and have played all my life. Won't Brooke let
me play?"</p>

<p>"Not he," said East, with some indignation. "Why, you don't know
the rules; you'll be a month learning them. And then it's no joke
playing-up in a match, I can tell you&mdash;quite another thing from
your private school games. Why, there's been two collar-bones
broken this half, and a dozen fellows lamed. And last year a fellow
had his leg broken."</p>

<p>Tom listened with the profoundest respect to this chapter of
accidents, and followed East across the level ground till they
came to a sort of gigantic gallows of two poles, eighteen feet
high, fixed upright in the ground some fourteen feet apart, with
a cross-bar running from one to the other at the height of ten
feet or thereabouts.</p>

<p>"This is one of the goals," said East, "and you see the other,
across there, right opposite, under the Doctor's wall. Well, the
match is for the best of three goals; whichever side kicks two
goals wins: and it won't do, you see, just to kick the ball through
these posts&mdash;it must go over the cross-bar; any height'll do,
so long as it's between the posts. You'll have to stay in goal
to touch the ball when it rolls behind the posts, because if the
other side touch it they have a try at goal. Then we fellows in
quarters, we play just about in front of goal here, and have to
turn the ball and kick it back before the big fellows on the other
side can follow it up. And in front of us all the big fellows
play, and that's where the scrummages are mostly."</p>

<p>Tom's respect increased as he struggled to make out his friend's
technicalities, and the other set to work to explain the mysteries
of "off your side," "drop-kicks," "punts," "places," and the other
intricacies of the great science of football.</p>

<p>"But how do you keep the ball between the goals?" said he; "I
can't see why it mightn't go right down to the chapel."</p>

<p>"Why; that's out of play," answered East. "You see this gravel-walk
running down all along this side of the playing-ground, and the
line of elms opposite on the other? Well, they're the bounds.
As soon as the ball gets past them, it's in touch, and out of
play. And then whoever first touches it has to knock it straight
out amongst the players-up, who make two lines with a space between
them, every fellow going on his own side. Ain't there just fine
scrummages then! And the three trees you see there which come
out into the play, that's a tremendous place when the ball hangs
there, for you get thrown against the trees, and that's worse
than any hack."</p>

<p>Tom wondered within himself, as they strolled back again towards
the fives court, whether the matches were really such break-neck
affairs as East represented, and whether, if they were, he should
ever get to like them and play up well.</p>

<p>He hadn't long to wonder, however, for next minute East cried
out, "Hurrah! here's the punt-about; come along and try your hand
at a kick."  The punt-about is the practice-ball, which is just
brought out and kicked about anyhow from one boy to another before
callings-over and dinner, and at other odd times. They joined
the boys who had brought it out, all small School-house fellows,
friends of East; and Tom had the pleasure of trying his skill,
and performed very creditably, after first driving his foot three
inches into the ground, and then nearly kicking his leg into the
air, in vigorous efforts to accomplish a drop-kick after the manner
of East.</p>

<p>Presently more boys and bigger came out, and boys from other
houses on their way to calling-over, and more balls were sent
for. The crowd thickened as three o'clock approached; and when
the hour struck, one hundred and fifty boys were hard at work.
Then the balls were held, the master of the week came down in
cap and gown to calling-over, and the whole school of three hundred
boys swept into the big school to answer to their names.</p>

<p>"I may come in, mayn't I?" said Tom, catching East by the arm,
and longing to feel one of them.</p>

<p>"Yes, come along; nobody'll say anything. You won't be so eager
to get into calling-over after a month," replied his friend; and
they marched into the big school together, and up to the farther
end, where that illustrious form, the lower fourth, which had
the honour of East's patronage for the time being, stood.</p>

<p>The master mounted into the high desk by the door, and one of
the praepostors of the week stood by him on the steps, the other
three marching up and down the middle of the school with their
canes, calling out, "Silence, silence!" The sixth form stood close
by the door on the left, some thirty in number, mostly great big
grown men, as Tom thought, surveying them from a distance with
awe; the fifth form behind them, twice their number, and not quite
so big. These on the left; and on the right the lower fifth, shell,
and all the junior forms in order; while up the middle marched
the three praepostors.</p>

<p>Then the praepostor who stands by the master calls out the names,
beginning with the sixth form; and as he calls each boy answers
"here"  to his name, and walks out. Some of the sixth stop at
the door to turn the whole string of boys into the close. It is
a great match-day, and every boy in the school, will he, nill
he, must be there. The rest of the sixth go forwards into the
close, to see that no one escapes by any of the side gates.</p>

<p>To-day, however, being the School-house match, none of the School-house
praepostors stay by the door to watch for truants of their side;
there is carte blanche to the School-house fags to go where they
like. "They trust to our honour," as East proudly informs Tom;
"they know very well that no School-house boy would cut the match.
If he did, we'd very soon cut him, I can tell you."</p>

<p>The master of the week being short-sighted, and the praepostors
of the week small and not well up to their work, the lower-school
boys employ the ten minutes which elapse before their names are
called in pelting one another vigorously with acorns, which fly
about in all directions. The small praepostors dash in every now
and then, and generally chastise some quiet, timid boy who is
equally afraid of acorns and canes, while the principal performers
get dexterously out of the way. And so calling-over rolls on somehow,
much like the big world, punishments lighting on wrong shoulders,
and matters going generally in a queer, cross-grained way, but
the end coming somehow, which is, after all, the great point.
And now the master of the week has finished, and locked up the
big school; and the praepostors of the week come out, sweeping
the last remnant of the school fags, who had been loafing about
the corners by the fives court, in hopes of a chance of bolting,
before them into the close.</p>

<p>"Hold the punt-about!" "To the goals!" are the cries; and all
stray balls are impounded by the authorities, and the whole mass
of boys moves up towards the two goals, dividing as they go into
three bodies. That little band on the left, consisting of from
fifteen to twenty boys, Tom amongst them, who are making for the
goal under the School-house wall, are the School-house boys who
are not to play up, and have to stay in goal. The larger body
moving to the island goal are the School boys in a like predicament.
The great mass in the middle are the players-up, both sides mingled
together; they are hanging their jackets (and all who mean real
work), their hats, waistcoats, neck-handkerchiefs, and braces,
on the railings round the small trees; and there they go by twos
and threes up to their respective grounds. There is none of the
colour and tastiness of get-up, you will perceive, which lends
such a life to the present game at Rugby, making the dullest and
worst-fought match a pretty sight. Now each house has its own
uniform of cap and jersey, of some lively colour; but at the time
we are speaking of plush caps have not yet come in, or uniforms
of any sort, except the School-house white trousers, which are
abominably cold to-day. Let us get to work, bare-headed, and girded
with our plain leather straps. But we mean business, gentlemen.</p>

<p>And now that the two sides have fairly sundered, and each occupies
its own ground, and we get a good look at them, what absurdity
is this? You don't mean to say that those fifty or sixty boys
in white trousers, many of them quite small, are going to play
that huge mass opposite? Indeed I do, gentlemen. They're going
to try, at any rate, and won't make such a bad fight of it either,
mark my word; for hasn't old Brooke won the toss, with his lucky
halfpenny, and got choice of goals and kick-off? The new ball
you may see lie there quite by itself, in the middle, pointing
towards the School or island goal; in another minute it will be
well on its way there. Use that minute in remarking how the Schoolhouse
side is drilled. You will see, in the first place, that the sixth-form
boy, who has the charge of goal, has spread his force (the goalkeepers)
so as to occupy the whole space behind the goal-posts, at distances
of about five yards apart. A safe and well-kept goal is the foundation
of all good play. Old Brooke is talking to the captain of quarters,
and now he moves away. See how that youngster spreads his men
(the light brigade) carefully over the ground, half-way between
their own goal and the body of their own players-up (the heavy
brigade). These again play in several bodies. There is young Brooke
and the bull-dogs. Mark them well. They are the "fighting brigade,"
the "die-hards," larking about at leap-frog to keep themselves
warm, and playing tricks on one another. And on each side of old
Brooke, who is now standing in the middle of the ground and just
going to kick off, you see a separate wing of players-up, each
with a boy of acknowledged prowess to look to&mdash;here Warner, and
there Hedge; but over all is old Brooke, absolute as he of Russia,
but wisely and bravely ruling over willing and worshipping subjects,
a true football king. His face is earnest and careful as he glances
a last time over his array, but full of pluck and hope&mdash;the sort
of look I hope to see in my general when I go out to fight.</p>

<p>The School side is not organized in the same way. The goal-keepers
are all in lumps, anyhow and nohow; you can't distinguish between
the players-up and the boys in quarters, and there is divided
leadership. But with such odds in strength and weight it must
take more than that to hinder them from winning; and so their
leaders seem to think, for they let the players-up manage themselves.</p>

<p>But now look! there is a slight move forward of the School-house
wings, a shout of "Are you ready?" and loud affirmative reply.
Old Brooke takes half a dozen quick steps, and away goes the ball
spinning towards the School goal, seventy yards before it touches
ground, and at no point above twelve or fifteen feet high, a model
kick-off; and the School-house cheer and rush on. The ball is
returned, and they meet it and drive it back amongst the masses
of the School already in motion. Then the two sides close, and
you can see nothing for minutes but a swaying crowd of boys, at
one point violently agitated. That is where the ball is, and there
are the keen players to be met, and the glory and the hard knocks
to be got. You hear the dull thud, thud of the ball, and the shouts
of "Off your side," "Down with him," "Put him over," "Bravo." 
This is what we call "a scrummage," gentlemen, and the first scrummage
in a School-house match was no joke in the consulship of Plancus.</p>

<p>But see! it has broken; the ball is driven out on the School-house
side, and a rush of the School carries it past the School-house
players-up. "Look out in quarters," Brooke's and twenty other
voices ring out. No need to call, though: the School-house captain
of quarters has caught it on the bound, dodges the foremost School
boys, who are heading the rush, and sends it back with a good
drop-kick well into the enemy's country. And then follows rush
upon rush, and scrummage upon scrummage, the ball now driven through
into the School-house quarters, and now into the School goal;
for the School-house have not lost the advantage which the kick-off
and a slight wind gave them at the outset, and are slightly "penning"
their adversaries. You say you don't see much in it all&mdash;nothing
but a struggling mass of boys, and a leather ball which seems
to excite them all to great fury, as a red rag does a bull. My
dear sir, a battle would look much the same to you, except that
the boys would be men, and the balls iron; but a battle would
be worth your looking at for all that, and so is a football match.
You can't be expected to appreciate the delicate strokes of play,
the turns by which a game is lost and won&mdash;it takes an old player
to do that; but the broad philosophy of football you can understand
if you will. Come along with me a little nearer, and let us consider
it together.</p>

<p>The ball has just fallen again where the two sides are thickest,
and they close rapidly around it in a scrummage. It must be driven
through now by force or skill, till it flies out on one side or
the other. Look how differently the boys face it! Here come two
of the bulldogs, bursting through the outsiders; in they go, straight
to the heart of the scrummage, bent on driving that ball out on
the opposite side. That is what they mean to do. My sons, my sons!
you are too hot; you have gone past the ball, and must struggle
now right through the scrummage, and get round and back again
to your own side, before you can be of any further use. Here comes
young Brooke; he goes in as straight as you, but keeps his head,
and backs and bends, holding himself still behind the ball, and
driving it furiously when he gets the chance. Take a leaf out
of his book, you young chargers. Here comes Speedicut, and Flashman
the School-house bully, with shouts and great action. Won't you
two come up to young Brooke, after locking-up, by the School-house
fire, with "Old fellow, wasn't that just a splendid scrummage
by the three trees?" But he knows you, and so do we. You don't
really want to drive that ball through that scrummage, chancing
all hurt for the glory of the School-house, but to make us think
that's what you want&mdash;a vastly different thing; and fellows of
your kidney will never go through more than the skirts of a scrummage,
where it's all push and no kicking. We respect boys who keep out
of it, and don't sham going in; but you&mdash;we had rather not say
what we think of you.</p>

<p>Then the boys who are bending and watching on the outside, mark
them: they are most useful players, the dodgers, who seize on
the ball the moment it rolls out from amongst the chargers, and
away with it across to the opposite goal. They seldom go into
the scrummage, but must have more coolness than the chargers.
As endless as are boys' characters, so are their ways of facing
or not facing a scrummage at football.</p>

<p>Three-quarters of an hour are gone; first winds are failing,
and weight and numbers beginning to tell. Yard by yard the School-house
have been driven back, contesting every inch of ground. The bull-dogs
are the colour of mother earth from shoulder to ankle, except
young Brooke, who has a marvellous knack of keeping his legs.
The School-house are being penned in their turn, and now the ball
is behind their goal, under the Doctor's wall. The Doctor and
some of his family are there looking on, and seem as anxious as
any boy for the success of the School-house. We get a minute's
breathing-time before old Brooke kicks out, and he gives the word
to play strongly for touch, by the three trees. Away goes the
ball, and the bull-dogs after it, and in another minute there
is shout of "In touch!" "Our ball!" Now's your time, old Brooke,
while your men are still fresh. He stands with the ball in his
hand, while the two sides form in deep lines opposite one another;
he must strike it straight out between them. The lines are thickest
close to him, but young Brooke and two or three of his men are
shifting up farther, where the opposite line is weak. Old Brooke
strikes it out straight and strong, and it falls opposite his
brother. Hurrah! that rush has taken it right through the School
line, and away past the three trees, far into their quarters,
and young Brooke and the bull-dogs are close upon it. The School
leaders rush back, shouting, "Look out in goal!" and strain every
nerve to catch him, but they are after the fleetest foot in Rugby.
There they go straight for the School goal-posts, quarters scattering
before them. One after another the bull-dogs go down, but young
Brooke holds on. "He is down." No! a long stagger, but the danger
is past. That was the shock of Crew, the most dangerous of dodgers.
And now he is close to the School goal, the ball not three yards
before him. There is a hurried rush of the School fags to the
spot, but no one throws himself on the ball, the only chance,
and young Brooke has touched it right under the School goal-posts.</p>

<p>The School leaders come up furious, and administer toco to the
wretched fags nearest at hand. They may well be angry, for it
is all Lombard Street to a china orange that the School-house
kick a goal with the ball touched in such a good place. Old Brooke,
of course, will kick it out, but who shall catch and place it?
Call Crab Jones. Here he comes, sauntering along with a straw
in his mouth, the queerest, coolest fish in Rugby. If he were
tumbled into the moon this minute, he would just pick himself
up without taking his hands out of his pockets or turning a hair.
But it is a moment when the boldest charger's heart beats quick.
Old Brooke stands with the ball under his arm motioning the School
back; he will not kick out till they are all in goal, behind the
posts. They are all edging forwards, inch by inch, to get nearer
for the rush at Crab Jones, who stands there in front of old Brooke
to catch the ball. If they can reach and destroy him before he
catches, the danger is over; and with one and the same rush they
will carry it right away to the School-house goal. Fond hope!
it is kicked out and caught beautifully. Crab strikes his heel
into the ground, to mark the spot where the ball was caught, beyond
which the school line may not advance; but there they stand, five
deep, ready to rush the moment the ball touches the ground. Take
plenty of room. Don't give the rush a chance of reaching you.
Place it true and steady. Trust Crab Jones. He has made a small
hole with his heel for the ball to lie on, by which he is resting
on one knee, with his eye on old Brooke. "Now!" Crab places the
ball at the word, old Brooke kicks, and it rises slowly and truly
as the School rush forward.</p>

<p>Then a moment's pause, while both sides look up at the spinning
ball. There it flies, straight between the two posts, some five
feet above the cross-bar, an unquestioned goal; and a shout of
real, genuine joy rings out from the School-house players-up,
and a faint echo of it comes over the close from the goal-keepers
under the Doctor's wall. A goal in the first hour&mdash;such a thing
hasn't been done in the School-house match these five years.</p>

<p>"Over!" is the cry. The two sides change goals, and the School-house
goal-keepers come threading their way across through the masses
of the School, the most openly triumphant of them&mdash;amongst whom
is Tom, a School-house boy of two hours' standing&mdash;getting their
ears boxed in the transit. Tom indeed is excited beyond measure,
and it is all the sixth-form boy, kindest and safest of goal-keepers,
has been able to do, to keep him from rushing out whenever the
ball has been near their goal. So he holds him by his side, and
instructs him in the science of touching.</p>

<p>At this moment Griffith, the itinerant vender of oranges from
Hill Morton, enters the close with his heavy baskets. There is
a rush of small boys upon the little pale-faced man, the two sides
mingling together, subdued by the great goddess Thirst, like the
English and French by the streams in the Pyrenees. The leaders
are past oranges and apples, but some of them visit their coats,
and apply innocent-looking ginger-beer bottles to their mouths.
It is no ginger-beer though, I fear, and will do you no good.
One short mad rush, and then a stitch in the side, and no more
honest play. That's what comes of those bottles.</p>

<p>But now Griffith's baskets are empty, the ball is placed again
midway, and the School are going to kick off. Their leaders have
sent their lumber into goal, and rated the rest soundly, and one
hundred and twenty picked players-up are there, bent on retrieving
the game. They are to keep the ball in front of the School-house
goal, and then to drive it in by sheer strength and weight. They
mean heavy play and no mistake, and so old Brooke sees, and places
Crab Jones in quarters just before the goal, with four or five
picked players who are to keep the ball away to the sides, where
a try at goal, if obtained, will be less dangerous than in front.
He himself, and Warner and Hedge, who have saved themselves till
now, will lead the charges.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" "Yes." And away comes the ball, kicked high
in the air, to give the School time to rush on and catch it as
it falls. And here they are amongst us. Meet them like Englishmen,
you Schoolhouse boys, and charge them home. Now is the time to
show what mettle is in you; and there shall be a warm seat by
the hall fire, and honour, and lots of bottled beer to-night for
him who does his duty in the next half-hour. And they are well
met. Again and again the cloud of their players-up gathers before
our goal, and comes threatening on, and Warner or Hedge, with
young Brooke and the relics of the bull-dogs, break through and
carry the ball back; and old Brooke ranges the field like Job's
war-horse. The thickest scrummage parts asunder before his rush,
like the waves before a clipper's bows; his cheery voice rings
out over the field, and his eye is everywhere. And if these miss
the ball, and it rolls dangerously in front of our goal, Crab
Jones and his men have seized it and sent it away towards the
sides with the unerring drop-kick. This is worth living for&mdash;the
whole sum of school-boy existence gathered up into one straining,
struggling half-hour, a half-hour worth a year of common life.</p>

<p>The quarter to five has struck, and the play slackens for a minute
before goal; but there is Crew, the artful dodger, driving the
ball in behind our goal, on the island side, where our quarters
are weakest. Is there no one to meet him? Yes; look at little
East! The ball is just at equal distances between the two, and
they rush together, the young man of seventeen and the boy of
twelve, and kick it at the same moment. Crew passes on without
a stagger; East is hurled forward by the shock, and plunges on
his shoulder, as if he would bury himself in the ground; but the
ball rises straight into the air, and falls behind Crew's back,
while the "bravoes" of the School-house attest the pluckiest charge
of all that hard-fought day. Warner picks East up lame and half
stunned, and he hobbles back into goal, conscious of having played
the man.</p>

<p>And now the last minutes are come, and the School gather for
their last rush, every boy of the hundred and twenty who has a
run left in him. Reckless of the defence of their own goal, on
they come across the level big-side ground, the ball well down
amongst them, straight for our goal, like the column of the Old
Guard up the slope at Waterloo. All former charges have been child's
play to this. Warner and Hedge have met them, but still on they
come. The bull-dogs rush in for the last time; they are hurled
over or carried back, striving hand, foot, and eyelids. Old Brooke
comes sweeping round the skirts of the play, and turning short
round, picks out the very heart of the scrummage, and plunges
in. It wavers for a moment; he has the ball. No, it has passed
him, and his voice rings out clear over the advancing tide, "Look
out in goal!" Crab Jones catches it for a moment; but before he
can kick, the rush is upon him and passes over him; and he picks
himself up behind them with his straw in his mouth, a little dirtier,
but as cool as ever.</p>

<p>The ball rolls slowly in behind the School-house goal, not three
yards in front of a dozen of the biggest School players-up.</p>

<p>There stands the School-house praepostor, safest of goal-keepers,
and Tom Brown by his side, who has learned his trade by this time.
Now is your time, Tom. The blood of all the Browns is up, and
the two rush in together, and throw themselves on the ball, under
the very feet of the advancing column&mdash;the praepostor on his hands
and knees, arching his back, and Tom all along on his face. Over
them topple the leaders of the rush, shooting over the back of
the praepostor, but falling flat on Tom, and knocking all the
wind out of his small carcass. "Our ball," says the praepostor,
rising with his prize; "but get up there; there's a little fellow
under you." They are hauled and roll off him, and Tom is discovered,
a motionless body.</p>

<p>Old Brooke picks him up. "Stand back, give him air," he says;
and then feeling his limbs, adds, "No bones broken. &mdash;How
do you feel, young un?"</p>

<p>"Hah-hah!" gasps Tom, as his wind comes back; "pretty well, thank
you&mdash;all right."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" says Brooke.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's Brown; he's a new boy; I know him," says East, coming
up.</p>

<p>"Well, he is a plucky youngster, and will make a player," says
Brooke.</p>

<p>And five o'clock strikes. "No side" is called, and the first
day of the School-house match is over.</p>
