<P>
The Duke paused, in his way across the crowded reception rooms,
to speak to his host, Sir Edward Bransome, Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs.
<P>
"I have just written you a line, Bransome," he said, as they
shook hands. "The chief tells me that he is going to honor us
down at Devenham for a few days, and that we may expect you
also."
<P>
"You are very kind, Duke," Bransome answered. "I suppose Haviland
explained the matter to you."
<P>
The Duke nodded.
<P>
"You are going to help me entertain my other distinguished
visitor," he remarked. "I fancy we shall be quite an interesting
party."
<P>
Bransome glanced around.
<P>
"I hope most earnestly," he said, "that we shall induce our young
friend to be a little more candid with us than he has been. One
can't get a word out of Hesho, but I'm bound to say that I don't
altogether like the look of things. The Press are beginning to
smell a rat. Two leading articles this morning, I see, upon our
Eastern relations."
<P>
The Duke nodded.
<P>
"I read them," he said. "We are informed that the prestige and
success of our ministry will entirely depend upon whether or not
we are able to arrange for the renewal of our treaty with Japan.
I remember the same papers shrieking themselves hoarse with
indignation when we first joined hands with our little friends
across the sea!"
<P>
His secretary approached Bransome and touched him on the
shoulder.
<P>
"There is a person in the anteroom, sir," he said, "whom I think
that you ought to see."
<P>
The Duke nodded and passed on. The Secretary drew his chief on
one side.
<P>
"This man has just arrived from Paris, sir," he continued, "and
is the bearer of a letter which he is instructed to deliver into
your hands only."
<P>
Bransome nodded.
<P>
"Is he known to us at all?" he asked. "From whom does the letter
come?"
<P>
The young man hesitated.
<P>
"The letter itself, sir, has nothing to do with France, I
imagine," he said. "The person I refer to is an American, and
although I have no positive information, I believe that he is
sometimes intrusted with the carrying of despatches from
Washington to his Embassy. Once or twice lately I have had it
reported to me that communications from the other side to Mr.
Harvey have been sent by hand. It seems as though they had some
objection to committing important documents to the post."
<P>
Bransome walked through the crowded rooms by the side of his
secretary, stopping for a moment to exchange greetings here and
there with his friends. His wife was giving her third reception
of the session to the diplomatic world.
<P>
"Washington has certainly shown signs of mistrust lately," he
remarked, "but if communications from them are ever tampered
with, it is more likely to be on their side than ours. They have
a particularly unscrupulous Press to deal with, besides political
intriguers. If this person you speak of is really the bearer of a
letter from there," he added, "I think we can both guess what it
is about."
<P>
The secretary nodded.
<P>
"Shall I ring up Mr. Haviland, sir?" He asked.
<P>
"Not yet," Bransome answered. "It is just possible that this
person requires an immediate reply, in which case it may be
convenient for me not to be able to get at the Prime Minister.
Bring him along into my private room, Sidney."
<P>
Sir Edward Bransome made his way to his study, opened the door
with a Yale key, turned on the electric lights, and crossed
slowly to the hearthrug. He stood there, for several moments,
with his elbow upon the mantelpiece, looking down into the fire.
A darker shadow had stolen across his face as soon as he was
alone. In his court dress and brilliant array of orders, he was
certainly a very distinguished-looking figure. Yet the last few
years had branded lines into his face which it was doubtful if he
would ever lose. To be Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to
the greatest power which the world had as yet known must
certainly seem, on paper, to be as brilliant a post as a man's
ambition could covet. Many years ago it had seemed so to Bransome
himself. It was a post which he had deliberately coveted, worked
for, and strived for. And now, when in sight of the end, with two
years of office only to run, he was appalled at the ever-growing
responsibilities thrust upon his shoulders. There was never,
perhaps, a time when, on paper, things had seemed smoother, when
the distant mutterings of disaster were less audible. It was only
those who were behind the curtain who realized how deceptive
appearances were.
<P>
In a few minutes his secretary reappeared, ushering in Mr. James
B. Coulson. Mr. Coulson was still a little pale from the effects
of his crossing, and he wore a long, thick ulster to conceal the
deficiencies of his attire. Nevertheless his usual breeziness of
manner had not altogether deserted him. Sir Edward looked him up
and down, and finding him look exactly as Mr. James B. Coulson of
the Coulson & Bruce Syndicate should look, was inclined to wonder
whether his secretary had made a mistake.
<P>
"I was told that you wished to see me," he said. "I am Sir Edward
Bransome."
<P>
Mr. James B. Coulson nodded appreciatively.
<P>
"Very good of you, Sir Edward," he said, "to put yourself out at
this time of night to have a word or two with me. I am sorry to
have troubled you, anyway, but the matter was sort of urgent."
<P>
Sir Edward bent his head.
<P>
"I understand, Mr. Coulson," he said, "that you come from the
United States."
<P>
"That is so, sir," Mr. Coulson replied. "I am at the head of a
syndicate, the Coulson & Bruce Syndicate, which in course of time
hope to revolutionize the machinery used for spinning wool all
over the world. Likewise we have patents for other machinery
connected with the manufacture of all varieties of woollen goods.
I am over here on a business trip, which I have just concluded."
<P>
"Satisfactorily, I trust?" Sir Edward remarked.
<P>
"Well, I'm not grumbling, sir," Mr. Coulson assented. "Here and
there I may have missed a thing, and the old fashioned way of
doing business on this side bothers me a bit, but on the whole
I'm not grumbling."
<P>
Bransome bowed. Perhaps, after all, the man was not a fool!
<P>
"I have a good many friends round about Washington," Mr. Coulson
continued, "and sometimes, when they know I am coming across, one
or the other of them finds it convenient to hand me a letter. It
isn't the postage stamp that worries them," he added with a
little laugh, "but they sort of feel that anything committed to
me is fairly safe to reach its right destination."
<P>
"Without disputing that fact for one moment, Mr. Coulson," Sir
Edward remarked, "I might also suggest that the ordinary mail
service between our countries has reached a marvellous degree of
perfection."
<P>
"The Post Office," Mr. Coulson continued meditatively, "is a
great institution, both on your side and ours, but a letter
posted in Washington has to go through a good many hands before
it is delivered in London."
<P>
Sir Edward smiled.
<P>
"It is a fact, sir," he said, "which the various Governments of
Europe have realized for many years, in connection with the
exchange of communications one with the other. Your own great
country, as it grows and expands, becomes, of necessity, more in
touch with our methods. Did I understand that you have a letter
for me, Mr. Coulson?"
<P>
Mr. Coulson produced it.
<P>
"Friend of mine you may have heard of," he said, "asked me to
leave this with you. I am catching the Princess Cecilia from
Southampton tomorrow. I thought, perhaps, if I waited an hour or
so, I might take the answer back with me."
<P>
"It is getting late, Mr. Coulson," Sir Edward reminded him,
glancing at the clock.
<P>
Mr. Coulson smiled.
<P>
"I think, Sir Edward," he said, "that in your line of business
time counts for little."
<P>
Sir Edward motioned his visitor to a chair and touched the bell.
<P>
"I shall require the A3X cipher, Sidney," he said to his
secretary.
<P>
Mr. Coulson looked up.
<P>
"Why," he said, "I don't think you'll need that. The letter
you've got in your hand is just a personal one, and what my
friend has to say to you is written out there in black and
white."
<P>
Sir Edward withdrew the enclosure from its envelope and raised
his eyebrows.
<P>
"Isn't this a trifle indiscreet?" he asked.
<P>
"Why, I should say not," Mr. Coulson answered. "My friend--Mr.
Jones we'll call him--knew me and, I presume, knew what he was
about. Besides, that is a plain letter from the head of a
business firm to--shall we say a client? There's nothing in it to
conceal."
<P>
"At the same time," Sir Edward remarked, "it might have been as
well to have fastened the flap of the envelope."
<P>
Mr. Coulson held out his hand.
<P>
"Let me look," he said.
<P>
Sir Edward gave it into his hands. Mr. Coulson held it under the
electric light. There was no indication in his face of any
surprise or disturbance.
<P>
"Bit short of gum in our stationery office," he remarked.
<P>
Sir Edward was looking at him steadily.
<P>
"My impressions were," he said, "when I opened this letter, that
I was not the first person who had done so. The envelope flew
apart in my fingers."
<P>
Mr. Coulson shook his head.
<P>
The document has never been out of my possession, sir," he said.
"It has not even left my person. My friend Mr. Jones does not
believe in too much secrecy in matters of this sort. I have had a
good deal of experience now and am inclined to agree with him. A
letter in a double-ended envelope, stuck all over with sealing
wax, is pretty certain to be opened in case of any accident to
the bearer. This one, as you may not have noticed, is written in
the same handwriting and addressed in the same manner as the
remainder of my letters of introduction to various London and
Paris houses of business."
<P>
Sir Edward said no more. He read the few lines written on a
single sheet of notepaper, starting a little at the signature.
Then he read them again and placed the document beneath a paper
weight in front of him. When he leaned across the table, his
folded arms formed a semicircle around it.
<P>
"This letter, Mr. Coulson," he said, "is not an official
communication."
<P>
"It is not," Mr. Coulson admitted. "I fancy it occurred to my
friend Jones that anything official would be hardly in place and
might be easier to evade. The matter has already cropped up in
negotiations between Mr. Harvey and your Cabinet, but so far we
are without any definite pronouncement,--at least, that is how my
friend Mr. Jones looks at it."
<P>
Sir Edward smiled.
<P>
"The only answer your friend asks for is a verbal one," he
remarked.
<P>
"A verbal one," Mr. Coulson assented, "delivered to me in the
presence of one other person, whose name you will find mentioned
in that letter."
<P>
Sir Edward bowed his head. When he spoke again, his manner had
somehow changed. It had become at once more official,--a trifle
more stilted.
<P>
"This is a great subject, Mr. Coulson," he said. "It is a subject
which has occupied the attention of His Majesty's Ministers for
many months. I shall take the opinion of the other person whose
name is mentioned in this letter, as to whether we can grant Mr.
Jones' request. If we should do so, it will not, I am sure, be
necessary to say to you that any communication we may make on the
subject tonight will be from men to a man of honor, and must be
accepted as such. It will be our honest and sincere conviction,
but it must also be understood that it does not bind the
Government of this country to any course of action."
<P>
Mr. Coulson smiled and nodded his head.
<P>
"That is what I call diplomacy, Sir Edward," he remarked. "I
always tell our people that they are too bullheaded. They don't
use enough words. What about that other friend of yours?"
<P>
Sir Edward glanced at his watch.
<P>
"It is possible," he said, "that by this time Mr.----- Mr. Smith,
shall we call him, to match your Mr. Jones?--is attending my
wife's reception, from which your message called me. If he has
not yet arrived, my secretary shall telephone for him."
<P>
Mr. Coulson indicated his approval.
<P>
"Seems to me," he remarked, "that I have struck a fortunate
evening for my visit."
<P>
Sir Edward touched the bell and his secretary appeared.
<P>
"Sidney," he said, "I want you to find the gentleman whose name I
am writing upon this piece of paper. If he is not in the
reception rooms and has not arrived, telephone for him. Say that
I shall be glad if he would come this way at once. He will
understand that it is a matter of some importance."
<P>
The secretary bowed and withdrew, after a glance at the piece of
paper which he held in his hand. Sir Edward turned toward his
visitor.
<P>
"Mr. Coulson," he said, "will you allow me the privilege of
offering you some refreshment?"
<P>
"I thank you, sir," Mr. Coulson answered. "I am in want of
nothing but a smoke."
<P>
Sir Edward turned to the bell, but his visitor promptly stopped
him.
<P>
"If you will allow me, sir," he said, "I will smoke one of my
own. Home-made article, five dollars a hundred, but I can't stand
these strong Havanas. Try one."
<P>
Sir Edward waved them away.
<P>
"If you will excuse me," he said, "I will smoke a cigarette.
Since you are here, Mr. Coulson, I may say that I am very glad to
meet you. I am very glad, also, of this opportunity for a few
minutes' conversation upon another matter."
<P>
Mr. Coulson showed some signs of surprise.
<P>
"How's that?" he asked.
<P>
"There is another subject," Sir Edward said, "which I should like
to discuss with you while we are waiting for Mr. Smith."
