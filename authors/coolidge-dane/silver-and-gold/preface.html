<p><strong>SILVER AND GOLD</strong>
</p>

<p><strong><u>THE PROPHECY</u></strong>
</p><p>"You will make a long journey to the West and there, within the
shadow of a Place of Death, you will find two treasures, one of Silver
and the other of Gold. Choose well between them and both shall be Yours,
but if you choose unwisely you will lose them Both and suffer a great
disgrace. You will fall in love with a beautiful woman who is an artist,
but beware how you reveal your affection or she will confer her hand
upon Another. Courage and constancy will attend you through life but in
the end will prove your undoing, for you will meet your death at the
hands of your Dearest Friend."
