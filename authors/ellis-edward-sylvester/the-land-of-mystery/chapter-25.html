<p>Ziffak, head chieftain of the Murhapas, was a shrewder and more
far-seeing man than even his white friends suspected.</p>

<p>He had been the first to observe the significant glances of Fred
Ashman at the hanging curtains, as he was the first to detect
the presence of his beloved niece behind them.</p>

<p>Although King Haffgo saw not the smile which flitted over the
face of his daughter, when her eyes met those of the young American,
yet Ziffak observed it, and he could not have translated it wrongly
had he wished to do so.</p>

<p>An intimation has been given of the nature of the quarrel between
Ziffak and his royal brother.  The latter was so infuriated that
he declared that every one of the white men should die.  Ziffak
reminded him of his pledge that they should be safe for two days,
a pledge that he had repeated in their presence.</p>

<p>But in his hot anger, Ziffak said, he would break that pledge. 
One of the explorers had dared to look upon the face of Ariel
and smile.  Had he detected her returning it, he would have driven
his javelin through her body as she stood beside him.</p>

<p>Ziffak gave no hint of what he had observed.</p>

<p>The head chieftain was not afraid to brave his brother to his
face; but he wisely forbore carrying the quarrel beyond the point
of reconciliation.  He told his brother that he was so beside
himself that he forgot he was a Murhapa who never broke his word. 
But if the king insisted, he would see that the white men took
their departure before the rising of the morrow's sun.</p>

<p>King Haffgo consented that if that was done, he would permit
them to go in peace.  It was Ziffak's hope that his brother, after
his anger had time to cool, would modify his last declaration
still further and allow them to stay their two days, that led
him to qualify his remark about the necessity of their withdrawing
that night.</p>

<p>The same cunning which stood the head chieftain so well during
this stormy interview remained with him to the end.  While he
and his brother were wrangling, Ariel stood mute and with bowed
head.  She durst not speak, but withdrew only a minute or two
before her parent.</p>

<p>Ziffak was still warmly attached to Ashman, and was willing to
risk his life in his behalf.  Knowing that Waggaman and Burkhardt
had had much to do with stirring the resentment of the king, he
was angry enough to slay both of them.</p>

<p>When the most peculiar situation is considered, however, it is
hardly safe to believe the head chieftain was ready to go to the
length of helping to bring about a meeting between the lovers.</p>

<p>He understood his niece well enough to know that despite the
fury of her parent, she would brave a good deal to exchange words
with the handsome stranger that had made such an impression on
his heart.</p>

<p>So long as this young man remained in Ziffak's house, so long
was it impossible for such meeting to take place; but, when Ashman
sprang up and announced his intention of taking a stroll, Ziffak
believed that it was with the intention of trying to see Ariel. 
That is to say, he suspected what really came to pass, though
it was not in the mind of the youth.</p>

<p>Ashman had not been gone long, when Ziffak made an excuse to
withdraw, saying he meant to find out, if he could, where Waggaman
and Burkhardt were hiding.  He counselled the Professor and the
New Englander to stay where they were until his return, which
he promised should not be long deferred.</p>

<p>Neither Grimcke nor Long dreamt of the object of their dusky
friend in leaving, and as the mother of the Murhapa reappeared
about that time and started a fire, with a view of preparing their
evening meal, they concluded that the best thing for them was
to follow the advice of the brave fellow.</p>

<p>The instant Ziffak was on the outside of his own house, he became
as alert as a cat scenting a mouse.  He held his ponderous javelin
with its poisoned tip in his right hand, and he looked keenly
about in the gathering gloom.</p>

<p>A warrior stopped in front of him and made a respectful inquiry
about the white men.  Ziffak uttered such an angry reply and raised
his weapon so menacingly that the native skurried away in terror
of his life.</p>

<p>All at once the keen black eyes caught sight of a small, petite
figure as it vanished in the darkness.  He smiled, for he recognized
Ariel on her way to the upper end of the village.  He knew on
the instant what <em>that</em> meant.</p>

<p>Then the penetrating gaze outlined the figure of a man, sneaking
like a wild animal, down the river bank.  He was seen only faintly,
but he was equally sure of <em>his</em> identity.  It was Burkhardt,
one of the hated white men that had poisoned the mind of his brother
and caused him to forget he was a Murhapa, whose word should be
sacred.</p>

<p>An exultant gleam came into the dusky face, as he stole forward
in the same direction that the convict took.  The action of the
miscreant showed that he was following some prey, and who was
it as likely to be as the white man that was abroad and was held
in such detestation by the scoundrel?</p>

<p>Burkhardt, in one respect, acted precisely as did his intended
victim. The latter was so absorbed in his own delicious thoughts,
that, after that hurried glance around him, he did not once again
look to the rear. So Burkhardt, never once dreaming that he was
under surveillance, kept his gloating eyes fixed on the shadowy
figure in front, without looking to see that while the man was
hunting the tiger another tiger was not hunting him.</p>

<p>Being a slight distance to the rear of the convict, Ziffak could
not see the form in front of him with equal distinctness, but
the faint glimpse which he caught was all he needed.</p>

<p>Thus the strange procession passed up the western bank of the
calmly flowing Xingu.  Fred Ashman moving slowly and lost in reverie,
Burkhardt prowling like a wild beast behind him, with Ziffak clinging
to the heels of the wretch as if he were his very shadow.</p>

<p>The moon, which gave but faint light at the beginning, increased
in power as the minutes passed.  Ziffak fell back, so that if
Burkhardt should look around, he would not recognize though he
might see him.</p>

<p>But the ruffian did not turn his head: he was too intent on the
fearful task before him.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped.  Instantly Ziffak crouched down into the
smallest possible space and clutched his javelin.  The increasing
moonlight showed that he had passed beyond the upper end of the
village and was watching the lovers on the fringe of the forest
beyond.</p>

<p>A movement on the part of Burkhardt, as if he were making preparation
to fire his rifle, caused Ziffak to move swiftly and silently
forward until he was within twenty paces.  Then he paused, for
he was close enough.</p>

<p>The change of position on the part of the pursuer enabled him
to catch the outlines of the lovers, so absorbed in each other's
presence that they forgot to keep within the sheltering shadow
of the trees.</p>

<p>Burkhardt could ask for no better opportunity than that which
was now before him.  He knew the inextinguishable hatred of King
Haffgo for this white man, and no greater favor could be done
the ruler than to slay him.</p>

<p>Sinking on one knee, he carefully brought his gun to a level. 
The gleam of the moonlight on the barrel insured unerring aim.</p>

<p>But a moment before it was perfected, Ashman stepped forward
and seized the hand of his adored one.  This caused such a change
of the relative situation of the two that the weapon could not
be fired without endangering the life of the maiden.</p>

<p>That would never do, and waiting a moment in the hope that another
charge would take place, Burkhardt began stealthily moving to
the right to secure the advantage.  A few steps up the slope were
all that was required, when he again knelt on one knee and pointed
his rifle at the unsuspicious American.</p>

<p>It was but an instant before that Ariel caught sight of the crouching
figure and was transfixed with terror.  The moonlight enabled
her to identify the person, who was aiming his gun either at her
or her companion.</p>

<p>Before she could speak, and at the moment Ashman turned his head,
a giant figure was seen to rise as if out of the very earth, directly
behind the miscreant.  He held his prodigious javelin poised over
his bead.  He was seen to make a sudden onward movement and then
the weapon vanished.</p>

<p>Speeding toward the couple with such amazing velocity it was
invisible; but, ere the crouching convict could press the trigger
of his rifle, he was seen to sprawl forward, his gun flying from
his grasp.  The terrible javelin had gone entirely through his
body as though it were tissue paper, and pinned him like an impaled
insect to the earth!</p>

<p>"The scoundrel!" exclaimed Ashman, who was just too late to anticipate
their friend.</p>

<p>"It is Ziffak who has saved us!" gasped Ariel, shrinking against
the side of her lover.</p>

<p>The herculean chieftain towered aloft in more imposing proportions
than ever as he strode toward the startled couple.  Whether he
was advancing to regain his weapon, or whether he meant to join
them could not be known; for, before he reached the body of the
assassin, he abruptly stopped and looked in the direction of the
village.</p>

<p>He had caught an ominous sound: it was that made by the discharge
of firearms!</p>

<p>"Great heaven!" exclaimed Ashman; "they have attacked my friends
in Ziffak's house; I must go to their help; dearest Ariel, what
will become of you?" added the distracted lover.</p>

<p>"Leave me alone," she replied, becoming calm again; "I can return
home."</p>

<p>"Well, then, good-bye!  It may be for the last time," he impulsively
added, catching her, his one arm clasped about her yielding form
and drawing her to him.  Then, while she only faintly resisted,
he kissed her passionately, as a lover kisses the queen of his
heart when he believes he is bidding her farewell forever.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Ashman felt both of the willowy arms about his own
neck, and she returned his caresses with a fervor equal to his
own.</p>

<p>"Heaven bless and keep you!" he murmured; "I now have everything
to live for!  I shall fight hard, for it is not the life of my
friends or my own that it is at stake!  It is <em>you</em>! It
is <em>YOU</em>!"</p>

<p>The startled Ziffak had paused but an instant, when he read aright
the meaning of the sounds of guns from the village.  The explorers
had been attacked by the Murhapas.  King Haffgo must have given
the order.  He had violated his pledge for the first time in his
life.  Great was his provocation!</p>

<p>The bosom of the giant heaved with indignation.  He stood glaring
like a lion at the keepers who are torturing his mate to death,
while he is barred within the cage and cannot rush to her help.</p>

<p>Then, wheeling about, he broke into a run straight for his home,
whence came the shots that left no doubt that Professor Grimcke,
Jared Long, and perchance their servants were fighting for their
lives.</p>

<p>The chieftain had not far to go, and half the distance was passed,
when he paused as suddenly as he had started.  A new and startling
decision had formed itself in his mind.</p>

<p>Again he wheeled and dashed toward the spot where he had left
the lovers a minute before.</p>

<p>They saw him coming, and Ashman released his beloved and started
to join the chieftain, who he suspected had come for him.</p>

<p>"Back!" he commanded, waving his immense arms; "neither of you
must go to the village!"</p>

<p>"But what shall we do?" asked Ariel, pausing in front of the
excited giant.</p>

<p>"Flee at once!  Delay not a moment!  If you do not, Haffgo will
slay both of you!  They are searching for Ariel!  They suspect
she is with you!  They will soon know it and death awaits each!"</p>
