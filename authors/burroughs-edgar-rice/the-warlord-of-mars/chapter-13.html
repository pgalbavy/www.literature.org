But solan's last loud cry had not been without effect, for a
moment later a dozen guardsmen burst into the chamber, though not
before I had so bent and demolished the great switch that it could
not be again used to turn the powerful current into the mighty
magnet of destruction it controlled.
<P>
The result of the sudden coming of the guardsmen had been to compel
me to seek seclusion in the first passageway that I could find,
and that to my disappointment proved to be not the one with which
I was familiar, but another upon its left.
<P>
They must have either heard or guessed which way I went, for I had
proceeded but a short distance when I heard the sound of pursuit.
I had no mind to stop and fight these men here when there was
fighting aplenty elsewhere in the city of Kadabra--fighting
that could be of much more avail to me and mine than useless
life-taking far below the palace.
<P>
But the fellows were pressing me; and as I did not know the way
at all, I soon saw that they would overtake me unless I found a
place to conceal myself until they had passed, which would then give
me an opportunity to return the way I had come and regain the tower,
or possibly find a way to reach the city streets.
<P>
The passageway had risen rapidly since leaving the apartment
of the switch, and now ran level and well lighted straight into the
distance as far as I could see.  The moment that my pursuers
reached this straight stretch I would be in plain sight of them,
with no chance to escape from the corridor undetected.
<P>
Presently I saw a series of doors opening from either side of
the corridor, and as they all looked alike to me I tried the first
one that I reached.  It opened into a small chamber, luxuriously
furnished, and was evidently an ante-chamber off some office or
audience chamber of the palace.
<P>
On the far side was a heavily curtained doorway beyond which
I heard the hum of voices.  Instantly I crossed the small chamber,
and, parting the curtains, looked within the larger apartment.
<P>
Before me were a party of perhaps fifty gorgeously clad nobles
of the court, standing before a throne upon which sat Salensus Oll.
The Jeddak of Jeddaks was addressing them.
<P>
"The allotted hour has come," he was saying as I entered the apartment;
"and though the enemies of Okar be within her gates, naught may stay the
will of Salensus Oll.  The great ceremony must be omitted that no single
man may be kept from his place in the defenses other than the fifty that
custom demands shall witness the creation of a new queen in Okar.
<P>
"In a moment the thing shall have been done and we may return
to the battle, while she who is now the Princess of Helium looks
down from the queen's tower upon the annihilation of her former
countrymen and witnesses the greatness which is her husband's."
<P>
Then, turning to a courtier, he issued some command in a low voice.
<P>
The addressed hastened to a small door at the far end of the
chamber and, swinging it wide, cried:  "Way for Dejah Thoris,
future Queen of Okar!"
<P>
Immediately two guardsmen appeared dragging the unwilling bride
toward the altar.  Her hands were still manacled behind her,
evidently to prevent suicide.
<P>
Her disheveled hair and panting bosom betokened that, chained though
she was, still had she fought against the thing that they would do to her.
<P>
At sight of her Salensus Oll rose and drew his sword, and the sword
of each of the fifty nobles was raised on high to form an arch,
beneath which the poor, beautiful creature was dragged toward her doom.
<P>
A grim smile forced itself to my lips as I thought of the rude
awakening that lay in store for the ruler of Okar, and my itching
fingers fondled the hilt of my bloody sword.
<P>
As I watched the procession that moved slowly toward the throne--
a procession which consisted of but a handful of priests,
who followed Dejah Thoris and the two guardsmen--I caught a
fleeting glimpse of a black face peering from behind the
draperies that covered the wall back of the dais upon which
stood Salensus Oll awaiting his bride.
<P>
Now the guardsmen were forcing the Princess of Helium up the
few steps to the side of the tyrant of Okar, and I had no eyes
and no thoughts for aught else.  A priest opened a book and,
raising his hand, commenced to drone out a sing-song ritual.
Salensus Oll reached for the hand of his bride.
<P>
I had intended waiting until some circumstance should give me
a reasonable hope of success; for, even though the entire ceremony
should be completed, there could be no valid marriage while I lived.
What I was most concerned in, of course, was the rescuing of
Dejah Thoris--I wished to take her from the palace of Salensus Oll,
if such a thing were possible; but whether it were accomplished
before or after the mock marriage was a matter of secondary import.
<P>
When, however, I saw the vile hand of Salensus Oll reach out for
the hand of my beloved princess I could restrain myself no longer,
and before the nobles of Okar knew that aught had happened I had
leaped through their thin line and was upon the dais beside
Dejah Thoris and Salensus Oll.
<P>
With the flat of my sword I struck down his polluting hand;
and grasping Dejah Thoris round the waist, I swung her behind
me as, with my back against the draperies of the dais, I faced
the tyrant of the north and his roomful of noble warriors.
<P>
The Jeddak of Jeddaks was a great mountain of a man--a coarse,
brutal beast of a man--and as he towered above me there, his fierce
black whiskers and mustache bristling in rage, I can well imagine
that a less seasoned warrior might have trembled before him.
<P>
With a snarl he sprang toward me with naked sword, but whether
Salensus Oll was a good swordsman or a poor I never learned;
for with Dejah Thoris at my back I was no longer human--I was
a superman, and no man could have withstood me then.
<P>
With a single, low:  "For the Princess of Helium!" I ran my
blade straight through the rotten heart of Okar's rotten ruler,
and before the white, drawn faces of his nobles Salensus Oll rolled,
grinning in horrible death, to the foot of the steps below his
marriage throne.
<P>
For a moment tense silence reigned in the nuptial-room.  Then the
fifty nobles rushed upon me.  Furiously we fought, but the
advantage was mine, for I stood upon a raised platform above them,
and I fought for the most glorious woman of a glorious race,
and I fought for a great love and for the mother of my boy.
<P>
And from behind my shoulder, in the silvery cadence of that
dear voice, rose the brave battle anthem of Helium which the
nation's women sing as their men march out to victory.
<P>
That alone was enough to inspire me to victory over even
greater odds, and I verily believe that I should have bested the
entire roomful of yellow warriors that day in the nuptial chamber
of the palace at Kadabra had not interruption come to my aid.
<P>
Fast and furious was the fighting as the nobles of Salensus Oll sprang,
time and again, up the steps before the throne only to fall back before
a sword hand that seemed to have gained a new wizardry from its
experience with the cunning Solan.
<P>
Two were pressing me so closely that I could not turn when I heard
a movement behind me, and noted that the sound of the battle
anthem had ceased.  Was Dejah Thoris preparing to take her place
beside me?
<P>
Heroic daughter of a heroic world!  It would not be unlike her
to have seized a sword and fought at my side, for, though the women
of Mars are not trained in the arts of war, the spirit is theirs,
and they have been known to do that very thing upon countless occasions.
<P>
But she did not come, and glad I was, for it would have doubled
my burden in protecting her before I should have been able to
force her back again out of harm's way.  She must be contemplating
some cunning strategy, I thought, and so I fought on secure in the
belief that my divine princess stood close behind me.
<P>
For half an hour at least I must have fought there against the
nobles of Okar ere ever a one placed a foot upon the dais where
I stood, and then of a sudden all that remained of them formed below
me for a last, mad, desperate charge; but even as they advanced the
door at the far end of the chamber swung wide and a wild-eyed
messenger sprang into the room.
<P>
"The Jeddak of Jeddaks!" he cried.  "Where is the Jeddak of Jeddaks?
The city has fallen before the hordes from beyond the barrier, and but
now the great gate of the palace itself has been forced and the
warriors of the south are pouring into its sacred precincts.
<P>
"Where is Salensus Oll?  He alone may revive the flagging courage
of our warriors.  He alone may save the day for Okar.  Where is
Salensus Oll?"
<P>
The nobles stepped back from about the dead body of their ruler,
and one of them pointed to the grinning corpse.
<P>
The messenger staggered back in horror as though from a blow in the face.
<P>
"Then fly, nobles of Okar!" he cried, "for naught can save you.  Hark!
They come!"
<P>
As he spoke we heard the deep roar of angry men from the
corridor without, and the clank of metal and the clang of swords.
<P>
Without another glance toward me, who had stood a spectator of
the tragic scene, the nobles wheeled and fled from the apartment
through another exit.
<P>
Almost immediately a force of yellow warriors appeared in the
doorway through which the messenger had come.  They were backing
toward the apartment, stubbornly resisting the advance of a handful
of red men who faced them and forced them slowly but inevitably back.
<P>
Above the heads of the contestants I could see from my elevated
station upon the dais the face of my old friend Kantos Kan.
He was leading the little party that had won its way into
the very heart of the palace of Salensus Oll.
<P>
In an instant I saw that by attacking the Okarians from the
rear I could so quickly disorganize them that their further
resistance would be short-lived, and with this idea in mind I
sprang from the dais, casting a word of explanation to Dejah Thoris
over my shoulder, though I did not turn to look at her.
<P>
With myself ever between her enemies and herself, and with
Kantos Kan and his warriors winning to the apartment, there could
be no danger to Dejah Thoris standing there alone beside the throne.
<P>
I wanted the men of Helium to see me and to know that their
beloved princess was here, too, for I knew that this knowledge
would inspire them to even greater deeds of valor than they had
performed in the past, though great indeed must have been those
which won for them a way into the almost impregnable palace of
the tyrant of the north.
<P>
As I crossed the chamber to attack the Kadabrans from the rear
a small doorway at my left opened, and, to my surprise, revealed
the figures of Matai Shang, Father of Therns and Phaidor,
his daughter, peering into the room.
<P>
A quick glance about they took.  Their eyes rested for a moment,
wide in horror, upon the dead body of Salensus Oll, upon the blood
that crimsoned the floor, upon the corpses of the nobles who had
fallen thick before the throne, upon me, and upon the battling
warriors at the other door.
<P>
They did not essay to enter the apartment, but scanned its
every corner from where they stood, and then, when their eyes had
sought its entire area, a look of fierce rage overspread the
features of Matai Shang, and a cold and cunning smile touched the
lips of Phaidor.
<P>
Then they were gone, but not before a taunting laugh was thrown
directly in my face by the woman.
<P>
I did not understand then the meaning of Matai Shang's rage or
Phaidor's pleasure, but I knew that neither boded good for me.
<P>
A moment later I was upon the backs of the yellow men,
and as the red men of Helium saw me above the shoulders of
their antagonists a great shout rang through the corridor,
and for a moment drowned the noise of battle.
<P>
"For the Prince of Helium!" they cried.  "For the Prince of Helium!"
and, like hungry lions upon their prey, they fell once more upon
the weakening warriors of the north.
<P>
The yellow men, cornered between two enemies, fought with the
desperation that utter hopelessness often induces.  Fought as I
should have fought had I been in their stead, with the determination
to take as many of my enemies with me when I died as lay within the
power of my sword arm.
<P>
It was a glorious battle, but the end seemed inevitable,
when presently from down the corridor behind the red men
came a great body of reenforcing yellow warriors.
<P>
Now were the tables turned, and it was the men of Helium who
seemed doomed to be ground between two millstones.  All were
compelled to turn to meet this new assault by a greatly
superior force, so that to me was left the remnants of
the yellow men within the throneroom.
<P>
They kept me busy, too; so busy that I began to wonder if
indeed I should ever be done with them.  Slowly they pressed me
back into the room, and when they had all passed in after me,
one of them closed and bolted the door, effectually barring the
way against the men of Kantos Kan.
<P>
It was a clever move, for it put me at the mercy of a dozen
men within a chamber from which assistance was locked out, and it
gave the red men in the corridor beyond no avenue of escape should
their new antagonists press them too closely.
<P>
But I have faced heavier odds myself than were pitted against
me that day, and I knew that Kantos Kan had battled his way from
a hundred more dangerous traps than that in which he now was.
So it was with no feelings of despair that I turned my attention
to the business of the moment.
<P>
Constantly my thoughts reverted to Dejah Thoris, and I longed for
the moment when, the fighting done, I could fold her in my arms,
and hear once more the words of love which had been denied me for
so many years.
<P>
During the fighting in the chamber I had not even a single
chance to so much as steal a glance at her where she stood behind
me beside the throne of the dead ruler.  I wondered why she no
longer urged me on with the strains of the martial hymn of Helium;
but I did not need more than the knowledge that I was battling for
her to bring out the best that is in me.
<P>
It would be wearisome to narrate the details of that bloody struggle;
of how we fought from the doorway, the full length of the room to the
very foot of the throne before the last of my antagonists fell with
my blade piercing his heart.
<P>
And then, with a glad cry, I turned with outstretched arms to seize
my princess, and as my lips smothered hers to reap the reward that
would be thrice ample payment for the bloody encounters through which
I had passed for her dear sake from the south pole to the north.
<P>
The glad cry died, frozen upon my lips; my arms dropped limp
and lifeless to my sides; as one who reels beneath the burden of a
mortal wound I staggered up the steps before the throne.
<P>
Dejah Thoris was gone.
