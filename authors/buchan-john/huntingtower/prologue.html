<p><em>If the Professor of Poetry in the University of Oxford has
not forgotten the rock whence he was hewn, this simple story may
give him an hour of entertainment. I offer it to you because I
think you have met my friend Dickson McCunn, and I dare to hope
that you may even in your many sojournings in the Westlands have
encountered one or other of the Gorbals Die-Hards. If you share
my kindly feeling for Dickson, you will be interested in some
facts which I have lately ascertained about his ancestry. In his
veins there flows a portion of the redoubtable blood of the Nicol
Jarvies. When the Bailie, you remember, returned from his journey
to Rob Roy beyond the Highland Line, he espoused his housekeeper
Mattie, "an honest man's daughter and a near cousin o' the Laird
o' Limmerfield." The union was blessed with a son, who succeeded
to the Bailie's business and in due course begat daughters, one
of whom married a certain Ebenezer McCunn, of whom there is record
in the archives of the Hammermen of Glasgow. Ebenezer's grandson,
Peter by name, was Provost of Kirkintilloch, and his second son
was the father of my hero by his marriage with Robina Dickson,
eldest daughter of one Robert Dickson, a tenant-farmer in the
Lennox. So there are coloured threads in Mr. McCunn's pedigree,
and, like the Bailie, he can count kin, should he wish, with Rob
Roy himself through "the auld wife ayont the fire at Stuckavrallachan."</em></p>

<p><em>Such as it is, I dedicate to you the story, and ask for no
better verdict on it than that of that profound critic of life
and literature, Mr. Huckleberry Finn, who observed of the</em>
Pilgrim's Progress, <em>that he "considered the statements interesting,
but steep."</em></p>

<p><em>PROLOGUE</em></p>

<p>The girl came into the room with a darting movement like a swallow,
looked round her with the same birdlike quickness, and then ran
across the polished floor to where a young man sat on a sofa with
one leg laid along it.</p>

<p>"I have saved you this dance, Quentin," she said, pronouncing
the name with a pretty staccato. "You must be so lonely not dancing,
so I will sit with you. What shall we talk about?"</p>

<p>The young man did not answer at once, for his gaze was held by
her face. He had never dreamed that the gawky and rather plain
little girl whom he had romped with long ago in Paris would grow
into such a being. The clean delicate lines of her figure, the
exquisite pure colouring of hair and skin, the charming young
arrogance of the eyes&mdash;this was beauty, he reflected, a miracle,
a revelation. Her virginal fineness and her dress, which was the
tint of pale fire, gave her the air of a creature of ice and flame.</p>

<p>"About yourself, please, Saskia," he said. "Are you happy now
that you are a grown-up lady?"</p>

<p>"Happy!" Her voice had a thrill in it like music, frosty music.
"The days are far too short. I grudge the hours when I must sleep.
They say it is sad for me to make my d√©but in a time of war. But
the world is very kind to me, and after all it is a victorious
war for our Russia. And listen to this, Quentin. To-morrow I am
to be allowed to begin nursing at the Alexander Hospital. What
do you think of that?"</p>

<p>The time was January, 1916, and the place a room in the great
Nirski Palace. No hint of war, no breath from the snowy streets,
entered that curious chamber where Prince Peter Nirski kept some
of the chief of his famous treasures. It was notable for its lack
of drapery and upholstering&mdash;only a sofa or two and a few fine
rugs on the cedar floor. The walls were of a green marble veined
like malachite, the ceiling was of darker marble inlaid with white
intaglios. Scattered everywhere were tables and cabinets laden
with celadon china, and carved jade, and ivories, and shimmering
Persian and Rhodian vessels. In all the room there was scarcely
anything of metal and no touch of gilding or bright colour. The
light came from green alabaster censers, and the place swam in
a cold green radiance like some cavern below the sea. The air
was warm and scented, and though it was very quiet there, a hum
of voices and the strains of dance music drifted to it from the
pillared corridor in which could be seen the glare of lights from
the great ballroom beyond.</p>

<p>The young man had a thin face with lines of suffering round the
mouth and eyes. The warm room had given him a high colour, which
increased his air of fragility. He felt a little choked by the
place, which seemed to him for both body and mind a hot-house,
though he knew very well that the Nirski Palace on this gala evening
was in no way typical of the land or its masters. Only a week
ago he had been eating black bread with its owner in a hut on
the Volhynian front.</p>

<p>"You have become amazing, Saskia," he said. "I won't pay my old
playfellow compliments; besides, you must be tired of them. I
wish you happiness all the day long like a fairy-tale Princess.
But a crock like me can't do much to help you to it. The service
seems to be the wrong way round, for here you are wasting your
time talking to me."</p>

<p>She put her hand on his. "Poor Quentin! Is the leg very bad?"</p>

<p>He laughed. "Oh, no. It's mending famously. I'll be able to get
about without a stick in another month, and then you've got to
teach me all the new dances."</p>

<p>The jigging music of a two-step floated down the corridor. It
made the young man's brow contract, for it brought to him a vision
of dead faces in the gloom of a November dusk. He had once had
a friend who used to whistle that air, and he had seen him die
in the Hollebeke mud. There was something <em>macabre</em> in
the tune.... He was surely morbid this evening, for there seemed
something <em>macabre</em> about the house, the room, the dancing,
all Russia.... These last days he had suffered from a sense of
calamity impending, of a dark curtain drawing down upon a splendid
world. They didn't agree with him at the Embassy, but he could
not get rid of the notion.</p>

<p>The girl saw his sudden abstraction.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking about?" she asked. It had been her favourite
question as a child.</p>

<p>"I was thinking that I rather wished you were still in Paris."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"Because I think you would be safer."</p>

<p>"Oh, what nonsense, Quentin dear! Where should I be safe if not
in my own Russia, where I have friends&mdash;oh, so many, and tribes
and tribes of relations? It is France and England that are unsafe
with the German guns grumbling at their doors.... My complaint
is that my life is too cosseted and padded. I am too secure, and
I do not want to be secure."</p>

<p>The young man lifted a heavy casket from a table at his elbow.
It was of dark green imperial jade, with a wonderfully carved
lid. He took off the lid and picked up three small oddments of
ivory&mdash;a priest with a beard, a tiny soldier and a draught-ox.
Putting the three in a triangle, he balanced the jade box on them.</p>

<p>"Look, Saskia! If you were living inside that box you would think
it very secure. You would note the thickness of the walls and
the hardness of the stone, and you would dream away in a peaceful
green dusk. But all the time it would be held up by trifles&mdash;brittle
trifles."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "You do not understand. You cannot understand.
We are a very old and strong people with roots deep, deep in the
earth."</p>

<p>"Please God you are right," he said. "But, Saskia, you know that
if I can ever serve you, you have only to command me. Now I can
do no more for you than the mouse for the lion&mdash;at the beginning
of the story. But the story had an end, you remember, and some
day it may be in my power to help you. Promise to send for me."</p>

<p>The girl laughed merrily. "The King of Spain's daughter," she
quoted,</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Came to visit me,<br/>
&nbsp;And all for the love<br/>
&nbsp;Of my little nut-tree."

</p>
</div>
<p>The other laughed also, as a young man in the uniform of the
Preobrajenski Guard approached to claim the girl. "Even a nut-tree
may be a shelter in a storm," he said.</p>

<p>"Of course I promise, Quentin," she said. "<em>Au revoir.</em>
Soon I will come and take you to supper, and we will talk of nothing
but nut-trees."</p>

<p>He watched the two leave the room, her gown glowing like a tongue
of fire in the shadowy archway. Then he slowly rose to his feet,
for he thought that for a little he would watch the dancing. Something
moved beside him, and he turned in time to prevent the jade casket
from crashing to the floor. Two of the supports had slipped.</p>

<p>He replaced the thing on its proper table and stood silent for
a moment.</p>

<p>"The priest and the soldier gone, and only the beast of burden
left.... If I were inclined to be superstitious, I should call
that a dashed bad omen."</p>
