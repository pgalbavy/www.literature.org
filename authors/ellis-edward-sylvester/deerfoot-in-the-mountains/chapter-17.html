<p>Deerfoot the Shawanoe, before entering the elevated wooded portion
to the east of the bleak plain that had been the scene of his
triumphs the day before, paused and carefully scrutinized all
that lay within his field of vision. He was not altogether free
from a shadowy suspicion that Taggarak would resort to treachery,
though for reasons named by Mul-tal-la it was improbable. Despite
the care the youth had used, he feared that rumors of the coming
fight had got abroad, and some of the curious might brave the
wrath of their chief for the sake of viewing the combat. That
which Deerfoot saw, or rather failed to see, convinced him that
both fears were unfounded.</p>

<p>He recalled too clearly the spot named by the Blackfoot to make
any mistake, and he went directly to it. A few rods beyond the
rocks where Mul-tal-la and Deerfoot had caught sight of each other
after their long separation was a comparatively clear and level
space that covered a fourth of an acre or less. A glance showed
it to be an ideal spot for a meeting such as was at hand.</p>

<p>Deerfoot looked hastily around for Taggarak. He was not in sight.
In truth, the Shawanoe was considerably ahead of time, and the
chief was not a moment late when, after awhile, he strode into
view from the other side of the arena.</p>

<p>This famous chieftain has already been described. No one could
look upon him without a certain admiration, and it was easy to
believe the many stories of his prowess. He was spare of frame,
nearly six feet tall, and his mien and manner showed perfect fearlessness.
He wore no head dress, his abundant hair, in which there was not
the first streaking of gray, falling loosely over his shoulders,
almost to his waist. The upper part of his body was encased in
a shirt of deerskin, and the buckskin breeches were fringed down
the legs. Deerfoot noticed that he had on a new pair of moccasins,
stained several bright colors. He must have thought the occasion
warranted something in the nature of display. There was no skirt
to the jacket-like garment, the thighs being inclosed with the
buckskin which formed the leggings, after the manner of the modern
style of trousers. The handle of his knife&mdash;the weapon that many
a time had done frightful work&mdash;could be seen protruding from
the girdle that encircled his waist.</p>

<p>With a dignified step the chief strode forward until within a
dozen paces of Deerfoot, when he paused and scowled at him.</p>

<p>Following his policy of tantalism, Deerfoot made a mock bow and
said:</p>

<p>"Blackfoot, the Shawanoe is glad to see you come at last. But
why does the Blackfoot tremble when he finds himself in front
of a warrior instead of a squaw who knows not how to fight?"</p>

<p>The chief had never been addressed in this audacious fashion,
and his eyes seemed to scintillate from under his scowling brows.
Could it be he heard aright?</p>

<p>"When the Shawanoe learned that the Blackfoot who calls himself
chief and pretends to be a brave man wished to meet him in fight
by this rock, the heart of the Shawanoe was glad and he hurried
to come; but the Blackfoot is backward. He hoped the Shawanoe
would not come, but he is here and eager to fight him."</p>

<p>And to show the truth of his words, Deerfoot drew his knife from
his girdle and grasped it in his good left hand.</p>

<p>Taggarak now found his voice. There was a tremulousness in the
words, but it was due to his tumultuous wrath and not to fear.</p>

<p>"Dog of a Shawanoe! Do you choose to die by the hand of Taggarak,
or shall he send you to the Spirit Circle? Let him choose!"</p>

<p>"Squaw of a Blackfoot! It shall be <em>neither</em>. The Shawanoe
cares naught for the Spirit Circle, and will not go there. He
has no fear of the Blackfoot who knows how to fight women but
trembles when he stands before the Shawanoe! Has the Blackfoot
brought some of his warriors to save him from the anger of the
Shawanoe?"</p>

<p>And Deerfoot glanced around, as if looking for the help which
he knew was not near. He did not see it, but he saw something
else, which caused him almost as much displeasure. As he turned
toward a large boulder, half hidden by bushes, the upper part
of a head dropped down out of sight. Seen only for an instant,
the Shawanoe recognized the owner as Victor Shelton, and knew
his brother was with him. Despite Deerfoot's orders the boys had
managed to steal their way from place to place and were spectators
of this meeting. It was too late now to correct the wrong, and
he acted as if he knew it not. All the same, he resolved to "discipline"
the youths for disregarding his orders.</p>

<p>[Illustration: A Memorable Duel.]</p>

<p>In this game of abuse the chief was no match for the Shawanoe,
who saw that the tempestuous rage of Taggarak threatened to master
him. Accustomed throughout his life to be feared and obeyed, it
was unbearable thus to be flouted to his face by a stripling,
whom he felt able to crush like a bird's egg. He drew his knife,
whose blade was several inches longer than the weapon of the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>With the weapon clinched as if in a vise, the chief thrust his
left foot forward for a single pace, but did not advance farther.
He was debating with himself how best to dispose of this intolerable
youth. A quick death would be too merciful; he would first wound
and then prolong his suffering for an hour or more.</p>

<p>"The trembling Blackfoot fears to come to the Shawanoe, so the
Shawanoe will go to him."</p>

<p>These words were accompanied with an exquisite sneer, and Deerfoot
advanced three paces, taking care to stop before he was within
reach of the enraged chief.</p>

<p>"Does the Shawanoe think the God he worships can save him from
the vengeance of Taggarak, who spurns that God?"</p>

<p>The reply was a noble one. Dropping his insulting tones and manner,
Deerfoot said:</p>

<p>"The Shawanoe knows not whether the God he worships will save
him; he never cares nor thinks of <em>that</em>. He knows that
whatever his Father chooses to do <em>is right</em>, and if He
does not wish to take care of the Shawanoe, it <em>is right</em>.
He will go to heaven, the abode of those who obey God, when he
is called. He will be ready, whether he hears that call in the
gloom of the woods at midnight or on the plain when the sun is
high in the sky.</p>

<p>"The Blackfoot worships false gods. Let him learn whether they
will help him when he stands in front of the Shawanoe."</p>

<p>The self-confidence of the chief was absolute. Wearied of listening
to the taunts of the dusky Apollo, he strode toward him, raising
his right hand as he did so, feinted once and then brought down
the weapon with a vicious vigor that was meant to bury the point
in the shoulder of Deerfoot.</p>

<p>The blade, however, swished through air, and the youth smote
the chief squarely in the mouth with the back of his fist. He
could have used his knife, but he chose to play awhile with this
boaster. He delivered his blow so quickly that the Blackfoot,
accustomed as he was to fierce hand-to-hand fighting, had no time
to dodge or parry, and the next instant the Shawanoe was ten feet
away, weapon still grasped, and grinning at the slightly dazed
chief.</p>

<p>"Why does not the Blackfoot squaw strike the Shawanoe? The Shawanoe
has struck <em>him</em>. Cannot the Blackfoot see where to strike
with his knife? He is as slow as an aged woman, but he fears the
Shawanoe, who is his master."</p>

<p>Taggarak could not believe his failure was anything more than
one of those accidents to which the most skilful fighter is sometimes
liable. His weapon was still firm in his hand, and he moved forward
again, taking shorter and more stealthy steps. He crouched as
if gathering his muscles for a leap, while the Shawanoe contemptuously
watched him, alert and observant as a cat.</p>

<p>Six feet away the chief halted. Deerfoot did not stir. Taggarak
had learned of the lightning-like quickness of the youth, but
felt none the less certain of speedily overcoming him.</p>

<p>For a full minute the two glared at each other, neither speaking,
but the same aggravating, scornful smile was on the face of the
young Shawanoe. Suddenly he did an astounding thing. He tossed
his knife several feet up in the air, caught it by the handle
as it came down and then flung it a couple of rods to one side.</p>

<p>"The Shawanoe needs no weapon to conquer the Blackfoot squaw!"</p>

<p>Then Deerfoot voluntarily placed himself in front of the furious
warrior, without any weapon with which to defend himself. Not
only that, he folded his arms over his breast and with biting
irony added:</p>

<p>"Now let the Blackfoot think he has a squaw in front of him;
then he will strike hard, if his hand does not tremble."</p>

<p>It was more than flesh and blood could stand. The passion within
the breast of the chief broke into a volcano-like flame. With
a hissing gasp he sprang forward, striking swiftly with his knife,
first downward, then upward and then from side to side, as if
he meant to cut the execrated youth into ribbons. He repeated
the wild blows with a celerity that almost prevented the eye from
following the movements.</p>

<p>But, as before, he split only vacancy. Deerfoot easily eluded
the strokes, which were blinder than usual, for Taggarak was beside
himself with passion. In the midst of his aimless outburst the
Shawanoe did another thing which was worthy of a skilled pugilist.
Waiting for an opening, he shot his left hand forward, and, with
the open palm, landed a stunning blow on the bridge of the chief's
nose. The advantage of such a blow is that, when rightly delivered,
tears are forced into the eyes of the one receiving it, who, for
a minute or two, is partially blinded. You can understand his
fatal position. He cannot pause to clear his vision, for it comes
at the crisis of the fight, and an instant halting means ignominious
defeat, while to persevere, when he has only the partial use of
his sight, makes his disadvantage hardly the less.</p>

<p>While the chief was savagely blinking, in order to enable him
to see, the crowning taunt of all sounded in his ears:</p>

<p>"The Blackfoot cries like a pappoose. Does he wish to tread the
Spirit Circle? Does he beg the Shawanoe to be merciful to him?
If he whines for pity, let him sink on his knees and the Shawanoe
will listen to his crying."</p>

<p>Chief Taggarak now lost the last shred of self-control. With
a growl of crazy rage he bounded forward again, striking up and
down and right and left with a blind, venomous energy that would
have exhausted a giant.</p>

<p>Suddenly the wrist which held the whistling blade was seized
in the steel-like fingers of Deerfoot's left hand. The grip was
fearful, for the Shawanoe had now called upon his last reserve
of strength, and the wrist was as if encased in a coil of iron.
Then, with a peculiar twist of his hand, known only to himself,
and resembling that remarkable system known under the name of
jiu jitsu among the Japanese, who are the only ones that understand
it in all its frightful perfection, he bent the hand of the chief
remorselessly over and backward, until the palm gaped like the
mouth of a dying fish and the knife dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>Deerfoot now had both wrists imprisoned. Taggarak gasped and
panted and writhed, but could not twist himself loose. In the
trial of strength the Shawanoe proved himself the superior. Great
drops gathered on the forehead of the Blackfoot. His grin displayed
every molar in his head, and the mouth, stretched to double its
usual extent, had that horrible appearance when the space between
the lips at the corners is the same as in front and the expression
is that of a raging wild beast.</p>

<p>Thus the two stood, their arms sawing up and down and from one
side to another, without the Blackfoot being able to loosen the
merciless grip. He was panting, but no one could have detected
any quickening of the respiration of the Shawanoe. His mouth was
set and the light of battle flashed in his eyes. He did not speak
or yield a point. The crisis had come and he knew he was the victor,
just as he knew he would be from the first.</p>

<p>The Blackfoot swayed and his moccasins slid here and there over
the ground from the contortion of limbs and body. Then he began
pushing with might and main. His eyes were beginning to clear,
but the perspiration dripped from the twisted coppery features.
Reading his purpose, Deerfoot began pushing also. Neither yielded
for a minute or two, and then the chief was slowly forced backward.
There was no withstanding the tremendous power of the youth, who
strove to the last ounce of his matchless strength.</p>

<p>Taggarak recoiled a step, then another, then began walking backward,
and the next minute the walk became a trot on the part of both,
the chief retreating and the Shawanoe forcing him faster and faster,
though he struggled and resisted with the same panting desperation
as at first.</p>

<p>He was still trotting backward with short, increasing steps when
Deerfoot, never relaxing his grasp on the writhing wrists, thrust
one heel behind his enemy, who tripped and went over. To insure
due emphasis in the fall, Deerfoot made a leap as he was going
and landed with both knees on the breast of the Blackfoot, who
dropped with a thump that forced a gasp from his body and literally
shook the earth.</p>

<p>George and Victor Shelton, in their excitement, sprang up from
behind the rock that hid them. When Taggarak went over on his
back, with Deerfoot bearing him down, Victor could restrain himself
no longer. Snatching his cap from his head he swung it aloft,
and had opened his mouth to cheer when the slightly less excited
brother clapped his hand over his lips.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, you idiot?"</p>

<p>"I want to cheer for Deerfoot! If I don't I'll bust!"</p>

<p>"You will get all the busting you want from him if he finds out
we came here, after he told us to stay at home."</p>

<p>"By gracious! That's so; I forgot it. I'm glad you stopped me;
we must keep mum. Look!"</p>
