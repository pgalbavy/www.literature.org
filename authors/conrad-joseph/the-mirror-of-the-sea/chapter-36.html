<p> The love that is given to ships is profoundly different from
the love men feel for every other work of their hands—the love
they bear to their houses, for instance—because it is untainted
by the pride of possession. The pride of skill, the pride of responsibility,
the pride of endurance there may be, but otherwise it is a disinterested
sentiment.  No seaman ever cherished a ship, even if she belonged
to him, merely because of the profit she put in his pocket.  No
one, I think, ever did; for a ship-owner, even of the best, has
always been outside the pale of that sentiment embracing in a
feeling of intimate, equal fellowship the ship and the man, backing
each other against the implacable, if sometimes dissembled, hostility
of their world of waters.  The sea—this truth must be confessed—has
no generosity.  No display of manly qualities—courage, hardihood,
endurance, faithfulness—has ever been known to touch its irresponsible
consciousness of power.  The ocean has the conscienceless temper
of a savage autocrat spoiled by much adulation.  He cannot brook
the slightest appearance of defiance, and has remained the irreconcilable
enemy of ships and men ever since ships and men had the unheard
of audacity to go afloat together in the face of his frown.  From
that day he has gone on swallowing up fleets and men without his
resentment being glutted by the number of victims—by so many wrecked
ships and wrecked lives.  To-day, as ever, he is ready to beguile
and betray, to smash and to drown the incorrigible optimism of
men who, backed by the fidelity of ships, are trying to wrest
from him the fortune of their house, the dominion of their world,
or only a dole of food for their hunger.  If not always in the
hot mood to smash, he is always stealthily ready for a drowning. 
The most amazing wonder of the deep is its unfathomable cruelty.</p>

<p>I felt its dread for the first time in mid-Atlantic one day,
many years ago, when we took off the crew of a Danish brig homeward
bound from the West Indies.  A thin, silvery mist softened the
calm and majestic splendour of light without shadows—seemed to
render the sky less remote and the ocean less immense.  It was
one of the days, when the might of the sea appears indeed lovable,
like the nature of a strong man in moments of quiet intimacy. 
At sunrise we had made out a black speck to the westward, apparently
suspended high up in the void behind a stirring, shimmering veil
of silvery blue gauze that seemed at times to stir and float in
the breeze which fanned us slowly along.  The peace of that enchanting
forenoon was so profound, so untroubled, that it seemed that every
word pronounced loudly on our deck would penetrate to the very
heart of that infinite mystery born from the conjunction of water
and sky.  We did not raise our voices.  "A water-logged derelict,
I think, sir," said the second officer quietly, coming down from
aloft with the binoculars in their case slung across his shoulders;
and our captain, without a word, signed to the helmsman to steer
for the black speck. Presently we made out a low, jagged stump
sticking up forward—all that remained of her departed masts.</p>

<p>The captain was expatiating in a low conversational tone to the
chief mate upon the danger of these derelicts, and upon his dread
of coming upon them at night, when suddenly a man forward screamed
out, "There’s people on board of her, sir!  I see them!" in a
most extraordinary voice—a voice never heard before in our ship;
the amazing voice of a stranger.  It gave the signal for a sudden
tumult of shouts.  The watch below ran up the forecastle head
in a body, the cook dashed out of the galley.  Everybody saw the
poor fellows now.  They were there!  And all at once our ship,
which had the well-earned name of being without a rival for speed
in light winds, seemed to us to have lost the power of motion,
as if the sea, becoming viscous, had clung to her sides.  And
yet she moved.  Immensity, the inseparable companion of a ship’s
life, chose that day to breathe upon her as gently as a sleeping
child.  The clamour of our excitement had died out, and our living
ship, famous for never losing steerage way as long as there was
air enough to float a feather, stole, without a ripple, silent
and white as a ghost, towards her mutilated and wounded sister,
come upon at the point of death in the sunlit haze of a calm day
at sea.</p>

<p>With the binoculars glued to his eyes, the captain said in a
quavering tone: "They are waving to us with something aft there." 
He put down the glasses on the skylight brusquely, and began to
walk about the poop.  "A shirt or a flag," he ejaculated irritably. 
"Can’t make it out. . . Some damn rag or other!"  He took a few
more turns on the poop, glancing down over the rail now and then
to see how fast we were moving.  His nervous footsteps rang sharply
in the quiet of the ship, where the other men, all looking the
same way, had forgotten themselves in a staring immobility. "This
will never do!" he cried out suddenly.  "Lower the boats at once!
Down with them!"</p>

<p>Before I jumped into mine he took me aside, as being an inexperienced
junior, for a word of warning:</p>

<p>"You look out as you come alongside that she doesn’t take you
down with her.  You understand?"</p>

<p>He murmured this confidentially, so that none of the men at the
falls should overhear, and I was shocked.  "Heavens! as if in
such an emergency one stopped to think of danger!" I exclaimed
to myself mentally, in scorn of such cold-blooded caution.</p>

<p>It takes many lessons to make a real seaman, and I got my rebuke
at once. My experienced commander seemed in one searching glance
to read my thoughts on my ingenuous face.</p>

<p>"What you’re going for is to save life, not to drown your boat’s
crew for nothing," he growled severely in my ear.  But as we shoved
off he leaned over and cried out: "It all rests on the power of
your arms, men.  Give way for life!"</p>

<p>We made a race of it, and I would never have believed that a
common boat’s crew of a merchantman could keep up so much determined
fierceness in the regular swing of their stroke.  What our captain
had clearly perceived before we left had become plain to all of
us since.  The issue of our enterprise hung on a hair above that
abyss of waters which will not give up its dead till the Day of
Judgment.  It was a race of two ship’s boats matched against Death
for a prize of nine men’s lives, and Death had a long start. 
We saw the crew of the brig from afar working at the pumps—still
pumping on that wreck, which already had settled so far down that
the gentle, low swell, over which our boats rose and fell easily
without a check to their speed, welling up almost level with her
head-rails, plucked at the ends of broken gear swinging desolately
under her naked bowsprit.</p>

<p>We could not, in all conscience, have picked out a better day
for our regatta had we had the free choice of all the days that
ever dawned upon the lonely struggles and solitary agonies of
ships since the Norse rovers first steered to the westward against
the run of Atlantic waves.  It was a very good race.  At the finish
there was not an oar’s length between the first and second boat,
with Death coming in a good third on the top of the very next
smooth swell, for all one knew to the contrary.  The scuppers
of the brig gurgled softly all together when the water rising
against her sides subsided sleepily with a low wash, as if playing
about an immovable rock.  Her bulwarks were gone fore and aft,
and one saw her bare deck low-lying like a raft and swept clean
of boats, spars, houses—of everything except the ringbolts and
the heads of the pumps.  I had one dismal glimpse of it as I braced
myself up to receive upon my breast the last man to leave her,
the captain, who literally let himself fall into my arms.</p>

<p>It had been a weirdly silent rescue—a rescue without a hail,
without a single uttered word, without a gesture or a sign, without
a conscious exchange of glances.  Up to the very last moment those
on board stuck to their pumps, which spouted two clear streams
of water upon their bare feet.  Their brown skin showed through
the rents of their shirts; and the two small bunches of half-naked,
tattered men went on bowing from the waist to each other in their
back-breaking labour, up and down, absorbed, with no time for
a glance over the shoulder at the help that was coming to them. 
As we dashed, unregarded, alongside a voice let out one, only
one hoarse howl of command, and then, just as they stood, without
caps, with the salt drying gray in the wrinkles and folds of their
hairy, haggard faces, blinking stupidly at us their red eyelids,
they made a bolt away from the handles, tottering and jostling
against each other, and positively flung themselves over upon
our very heads.  The clatter they made tumbling into the boats
had an extraordinarily destructive effect upon the illusion of
tragic dignity our self-esteem had thrown over the contests of
mankind with the sea.  On that exquisite day of gently breathing
peace and veiled sunshine perished my romantic love to what men’s
imagination had proclaimed the most august aspect of Nature. The
cynical indifference of the sea to the merits of human suffering
and courage, laid bare in this ridiculous, panic-tainted performance
extorted from the dire extremity of nine good and honourable seamen,
revolted me. I saw the duplicity of the sea’s most tender mood. 
It was so because it could not help itself, but the awed respect
of the early days was gone. I felt ready to smile bitterly at
its enchanting charm and glare viciously at its furies.  In a
moment, before we shoved off, I had looked coolly at the life
of my choice.  Its illusions were gone, but its fascination remained. 
I had become a seaman at last.</p>

<p>We pulled hard for a quarter of an hour, then laid on our oars
waiting for our ship.  She was coming down on us with swelling
sails, looking delicately tall and exquisitely noble through the
mist.  The captain of the brig, who sat in the stern sheets by
my side with his face in his hands, raised his head and began
to speak with a sort of sombre volubility.  They had lost their
masts and sprung a leak in a hurricane; drifted for weeks, always
at the pumps, met more bad weather; the ships they sighted failed
to make them out, the leak gained upon them slowly, and the seas
had left them nothing to make a raft of.  It was very hard to
see ship after ship pass by at a distance, "as if everybody had
agreed that we must be left to drown," he added.  But they went
on trying to keep the brig afloat as long as possible, and working
the pumps constantly on insufficient food, mostly raw, till "yesterday
evening," he continued monotonously, "just as the sun went down,
the men’s hearts broke."</p>

<p>He made an almost imperceptible pause here, and went on again
with exactly the same intonation:</p>

<p>"They told me the brig could not be saved, and they thought they
had done enough for themselves.  I said nothing to that.  It was
true.  It was no mutiny.  I had nothing to say to them.  They
lay about aft all night, as still as so many dead men.  I did
not lie down.  I kept a look-out.  When the first light came I
saw your ship at once.  I waited for more light; the breeze began
to fail on my face.  Then I shouted out as loud as I was able,
‘Look at that ship!’ but only two men got up very slowly and came
to me.  At first only we three stood alone, for a long time, watching
you coming down to us, and feeling the breeze drop to a calm almost;
but afterwards others, too, rose, one after another, and by-and-by
I had all my crew behind me.  I turned round and said to them
that they could see the ship was coming our way, but in this small
breeze she might come too late after all, unless we turned to
and tried to keep the brig afloat long enough to give you time
to save us all.  I spoke like that to them, and then I gave the
command to man the pumps."</p>

<p>He gave the command, and gave the example, too, by going himself
to the handles, but it seems that these men did actually hang
back for a moment, looking at each other dubiously before they
followed him.  "He! he! he!" He broke out into a most unexpected,
imbecile, pathetic, nervous little giggle.  "Their hearts were
broken so!  They had been played with too long," he explained
apologetically, lowering his eyes, and became silent.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years is a long time—a quarter of a century is a
dim and distant past; but to this day I remember the dark-brown
feet, hands, and faces of two of these men whose hearts had been
broken by the sea.  They were lying very still on their sides
on the bottom boards between the thwarts, curled up like dogs. 
My boat’s crew, leaning over the looms of their oars, stared and
listened as if at the play.  The master of the brig looked up
suddenly to ask me what day it was.</p>

<p>They had lost the date.  When I told him it was Sunday, the 22nd,
he frowned, making some mental calculation, then nodded twice
sadly to himself, staring at nothing.</p>

<p>His aspect was miserably unkempt and wildly sorrowful.  Had it
not been for the unquenchable candour of his blue eyes, whose
unhappy, tired glance every moment sought his abandoned, sinking
brig, as if it could find rest nowhere else, he would have appeared
mad.  But he was too simple to go mad, too simple with that manly
simplicity which alone can bear men unscathed in mind and body
through an encounter with the deadly playfulness of the sea or
with its less abominable fury.</p>

<p>Neither angry, nor playful, nor smiling, it enveloped our distant
ship growing bigger as she neared us, our boats with the rescued
men and the dismantled hull of the brig we were leaving behind,
in the large and placid embrace of its quietness, half lost in
the fair haze, as if in a dream of infinite and tender clemency. 
There was no frown, no wrinkle on its face, not a ripple.  And
the run of the slight swell was so smooth that it resembled the
graceful undulation of a piece of shimmering gray silk shot with
gleams of green.  We pulled an easy stroke; but when the master
of the brig, after a glance over his shoulder, stood up with a
low exclamation, my men feathered their oars instinctively, without
an order, and the boat lost her way.</p>

<p>He was steadying himself on my shoulder with a strong grip, while
his other arm, flung up rigidly, pointed a denunciatory finger
at the immense tranquillity of the ocean.  After his first exclamation,
which stopped the swing of our oars, he made no sound, but his
whole attitude seemed to cry out an indignant "Behold!" . . .
I could not imagine what vision of evil had come to him.  I was
startled, and the amazing energy of his immobilized gesture made
my heart beat faster with the anticipation of something monstrous
and unsuspected.  The stillness around us became crushing.</p>

<p>For a moment the succession of silky undulations ran on innocently. 
I saw each of them swell up the misty line of the horizon, far,
far away beyond the derelict brig, and the next moment, with a
slight friendly toss of our boat, it had passed under us and was
gone.  The lulling cadence of the rise and fall, the invariable
gentleness of this irresistible force, the great charm of the
deep waters, warmed my breast deliciously, like the subtle poison
of a love-potion.  But all this lasted only a few soothing seconds
before I jumped up too, making the boat roll like the veriest
landlubber.</p>

<p>Something startling, mysterious, hastily confused, was taking
place.  I watched it with incredulous and fascinated awe, as one
watches the confused, swift movements of some deed of violence
done in the dark.  As if at a given signal, the run of the smooth
undulations seemed checked suddenly around the brig.  By a strange
optical delusion the whole sea appeared to rise upon her in one
overwhelming heave of its silky surface, where in one spot a smother
of foam broke out ferociously.  And then the effort subsided. 
It was all over, and the smooth swell ran on as before from the
horizon in uninterrupted cadence of motion, passing under us with
a slight friendly toss of our boat.  Far away, where the brig
had been, an angry white stain undulating on the surface of steely-gray
waters, shot with gleams of green, diminished swiftly, without
a hiss, like a patch of pure snow melting in the sun.  And the
great stillness after this initiation into the sea’s implacable
hate seemed full of dread thoughts and shadows of disaster.</p>

<p>"Gone!" ejaculated from the depths of his chest my bowman in
a final tone.  He spat in his hands, and took a better grip on
his oar.  The captain of the brig lowered his rigid arm slowly,
and looked at our faces in a solemnly conscious silence, which
called upon us to share in his simple-minded, marvelling awe. 
All at once he sat down by my side, and leaned forward earnestly
at my boat’s crew, who, swinging together in a long, easy stroke,
kept their eyes fixed upon him faithfully.</p>

<p>"No ship could have done so well," he addressed them firmly,
after a moment of strained silence, during which he seemed with
trembling lips to seek for words fit to bear such high testimony. 
"She was small, but she was good.  I had no anxiety.  She was
strong.  Last voyage I had my wife and two children in her.  No
other ship could have stood so long the weather she had to live
through for days and days before we got dismasted a fortnight
ago.  She was fairly worn out, and that’s all.  You may believe
me.  She lasted under us for days and days, but she could not
last for ever.  It was long enough.  I am glad it is over.  No
better ship was ever left to sink at sea on such a day as this."</p>

<p>He was competent to pronounce the funereal oration of a ship,
this son of ancient sea-folk, whose national existence, so little
stained by the excesses of manly virtues, had demanded nothing
but the merest foothold from the earth.  By the merits of his
sea-wise forefathers and by the artlessness of his heart, he was
made fit to deliver this excellent discourse.  There was nothing
wanting in its orderly arrangement—neither piety nor faith, nor
the tribute of praise due to the worthy dead, with the edifying
recital of their achievement.  She had lived, he had loved her;
she had suffered, and he was glad she was at rest.  It was an
excellent discourse.  And it was orthodox, too, in its fidelity
to the cardinal article of a seaman’s faith, of which it was a
single-minded confession.  "Ships are all right."  They are. 
They who live with the sea have got to hold by that creed first
and last; and it came to me, as I glanced at him sideways, that
some men were not altogether unworthy in honour and conscience
to pronounce the funereal eulogium of a ship’s constancy in life
and death.</p>

<p>After this, sitting by my side with his loosely-clasped hands
hanging between his knees, he uttered no word, made no movement
till the shadow of our ship’s sails fell on the boat, when, at
the loud cheer greeting the return of the victors with their prize,
he lifted up his troubled face with a faint smile of pathetic
indulgence.  This smile of the worthy descendant of the most ancient
sea-folk whose audacity and hardihood had left no trace of greatness
and glory upon the waters, completed the cycle of my initiation. 
There was an infinite depth of hereditary wisdom in its pitying
sadness.  It made the hearty bursts of cheering sound like a childish
noise of triumph.  Our crew shouted with immense confidence—honest
souls!  As if anybody could ever make sure of having prevailed
against the sea, which has betrayed so many ships of great "name,"
so many proud men, so many towering ambitions of fame, power,
wealth, greatness!</p>

<p>As I brought the boat under the falls my captain, in high good-humour,
leaned over, spreading his red and freckled elbows on the rail,
and called down to me sarcastically, out of the depths of his
cynic philosopher’s beard:</p>

<p>"So you have brought the boat back after all, have you?"</p>

<p>Sarcasm was "his way," and the most that can be said for it is
that it was natural.  This did not make it lovable.  But it is
decorous and expedient to fall in with one’s commander’s way. 
"Yes.  I brought the boat back all right, sir," I answered.  And
the good man believed me.  It was not for him to discern upon
me the marks of my recent initiation. And yet I was not exactly
the same youngster who had taken the boat away—all impatience
for a race against death, with the prize of nine men’s lives at
the end.</p>

<p>Already I looked with other eyes upon the sea.  I knew it capable
of betraying the generous ardour of youth as implacably as, indifferent
to evil and good, it would have betrayed the basest greed or the
noblest heroism.  My conception of its magnanimous greatness was
gone.  And I looked upon the true sea—the sea that plays with
men till their hearts are broken, and wears stout ships to death. 
Nothing can touch the brooding bitterness of its heart.  Open
to all and faithful to none, it exercises its fascination for
the undoing of the best.  To love it is not well.  It knows no
bond of plighted troth, no fidelity to misfortune, to long companionship,
to long devotion.  The promise it holds out perpetually is very
great; but the only secret of its possession is strength, strength—the
jealous, sleepless strength of a man guarding a coveted treasure
within his gates.</p>
