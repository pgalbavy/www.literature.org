<P>
In the days that followed Billy's swellings went down and the
bruises passed away with surprising rapidity. The quick healing
of the lacerations attested the healthiness of his blood. Only
remained the black eyes, unduly conspicuous on a face as blond as
his. The discoloration was stubborn, persisting half a month, in
which time happened divers events of importance.
<P>
Otto Frank's trial had been expeditious. Found guilty by a jury
notable for the business and professional men on it, the death
sentence was passed upon him and he was removed to San Quentin
for execution.
<P>
The case of Chester Johnson and the fourteen others had taken
longer, but within the same week, it, too, was finished. Chester
Johnson was sentenced to be hanged. Two got life; three, twenty
years. Only two were acquitted. The remaining seven received
terms of from two to ten years.
<P>
The effect on Saxon was to throw her into deep depression. Billy
was made gloomy, but his fighting spirit was not subdued.
<P>
"Always some men killed in battle," he said. "That's to be
expected. But the way of sentencin' 'em gets me. All found guilty
was responsible for the killin'; or none was responsible. If all
was, then they should get the same sentence. They oughta hang
like Chester Johnson, or else he oughtn't to hang. I'd just like
to know how the judge makes up his mind. It must be like markin'
China lottery tickets. He plays hunches. He looks at a guy an'
waits for a spot or a number to come into his head. How else
could he give Johnny Black four years an' Cal Hutchins twenty
years? He played the hunches as they came into his head, an' it
might just as easy ben the other way around an' Cal Hutchins got
four years an' Johnny Black twenty.
<P>
"I know both them boys. They hung out with the Tenth an' Kirkham
gang mostly, though sometimes they ran with my gang. We used to
go swimmin' after school down to Sandy Beach on the marsh, an' in
the Transit slip where they said the water was sixty feet deep,
only it wasn't. An' once, on a Thursday, we dug a lot of clams
together, an' played hookey Friday to peddle them. An' we used to
go out on the Rock Wall an' catch pogies an' rock cod. One
day--the day of the eclipse--Cal caught a perch half as big as a
door. I never seen such a fish. An' now he's got to wear the
stripes for twenty years. Lucky he wasn't married. If he don't
get the consumption he'll be an old man when he comes out. Cal's
mother wouldn't let 'm go swimmin', an' whenever she suspected
she always licked his hair with her tongue. If it tasted salty,
he got a beltin'. But he was onto himself. Comin' home, he'd jump
somebody's front fence an' hold his head under a faucet."
<P>
"I used to dance with Chester Johnson," Saxon said. "And I knew
his wife, Kittie Brady, long and long ago. She had next place at
the table to me in the paper-box factory. She's gone to San
Francisco to her married sister's. She's going to have a baby,
too. She was awfully pretty, and there was always a string of
fellows after her."
<P>
The effect of the conviction and severe sentences was a bad one
on the union men. Instead of being disheartening, it intensified
the bitterness. Billy's repentance for having fought and the
sweetness and affection which had flashed up in the days of
Saxon's nursing of him were blotted out. At home, he scowled and
brooded, while his talk took on the tone of Bert's in the last
days ere that Mohegan died. Also, Billy stayed away from home
longer hours, and was again steadily drinking.
<P>
Saxon well-nigh abandoned hope. Almost was she steeled to the
inevitable tragedy which her morbid fancy painted in a thousand
guises. Oftenest, it was of Billy being brought home on a
stretcher. Sometimes it was a call to the telephone in the corner
grocery and the curt information by a strange voice that her
husband was lying in the receiving hospital or the morgue. And
when the mysterious horse-poisoning cases occurred, and when the
residence of one of the teaming magnates was half destroyed by
dynamite, she saw Billy in prison, or wearing stripes, or
mounting to the scaffold at San Quentin while at the same time
she could see the little cottage on Pine street besieged by
newspaper reporters and photographers.
<P>
Yet her lively imagination failed altogether to anticipate the
real catastrophe. Harmon, the fireman lodger, passing through the
kitchen on his way out to work, had paused to tell Saxon about
the previous day's train-wreck in the Alviso marshes, and of how
the engineer, imprisoned under the overturned engine and unhurt,
being drowned by the rising tide, had begged to be shot. Billy
came in at the end of the narrative, and from the somber light in
his heavy-lidded eyes Saxon knew he had been drinking. He
glowered at Harmon, and, without greeting to him or Saxon, leaned
his shoulder against the wall.
<P>
Harmon felt the awkwardness of the situation, and did his best to
appear oblivious.
<P>
"I was just telling your wife--" he began, but was savagely
interrupted.
<P>
"I don't care what you was tellin' her. But I got something to
tell you, Mister Man. My wife's made up your bed too many times
to suit me."
<P>
"Billy!" Saxon cried, her face scarlet with resentment, and hurt,
and shame.
<P>
Billy ignored her. Harmon was saying:
<P>
"I don't understand--"
<P>
"Well, I don't like your mug," Billy informed him. "You're
standin' on your foot. Get off of it. Get out. Beat it. D'ye
understand that?"
<P>
"I don't know what's got into him," Saxon gasped hurriedly to the
fireman. "He's not himself. Oh, I am so ashamed, so ashamed."
<P>
Billy turned on her.
<P>
"You shut your mouth an' keep outa this."
<P>
"But, Billy," she remonstrated.
<P>
"An' get outa here. You go into the other room."
<P>
"Here, now," Harmon broke in. "This is a fine way to treat a
fellow."
<P>
"I've given you too much rope as it is," was Billy's answer.
<P>
"I've paid my rent regularly, haven't I?"
<P>
"An' I oughta knock your block off for you. Don't see any reason
I shouldn't, for that matter."
<P>
"If you do anything like that, Billy--" Saxon began.
<P>
"You here still? Well, if you won't go into the other room, I'll
see that you do."
<P>
His hand clutched her arm. For one instant she resisted his
strength; and in that instant, the flesh crushed under his
fingers, she realized the fullness of his strength.
<P>
In the front room she could only lie back in the Morris chair
sobbing, and listen to what occurred in the kitchen. "I'll stay
to the end of the week," the fireman was saying. "I've paid in
advance."
<P>
"Don't make no mistake," came Billy's voice, so slow that it was
almost a drawl, yet quivering with rage. "You can't get out too
quick if you wanta stay healthy--you an' your traps with you. I'm
likely to start something any moment."
<P>
"Oh, I know you're a slugger--" the fireman's voice began.
<P>
Then came the unmistakable impact of a blow; the crash of glass;
a scuffle on the back porch; and, finally, the heavy bumps of a
body down the steps. She heard Billy reenter the kitchen, move
about, and knew he was sweeping up the broken glass of the
kitchen door. Then he washed himself at the sink, whistling while
he dried his face and hands, and walked into the front room. She
did not look at him. She was too sick and sad. He paused
irresolutely, seeming to make up his mind.
<P>
"I'm goin' up town," he stated. "They's a meeting of the union.
If I don't come back it'll be because that geezer's sworn out a
warrant."
<P>
He opened the front door and paused. She knew he was looking at
her. Then the door closed and she heard him go down the steps.
<P>
Saxon was stunned. She did not think. She did not know what to
think. The whole thing was incomprehensible, incredible. She lay
back in the chair, her eyes closed, her mind almost a blank,
crushed by a leaden feeling that the end had come to everything.
<P>
The voices of children playing in the street aroused her. Night
had fallen. She groped her way to a lamp and lighted it. In the
kitchen she stared, lips trembling, at the pitiful, half prepared
meal. The fire had gone out. The water had boiled away from the
potatoes. When she lifted the lid, a burnt smell arose.
Methodically she scraped and cleaned the pot, put things in
order, and peeled and sliced the potatoes for next day's frying.
And just as methodically she went to bed. Her lack of
nervousness, her placidity, was abnormal, so abnormal that she
closed her eyes and was almost immediately asleep. Nor did she
awaken till the sunshine was streaming into the room.
<P>
It was the first night she and Billy had slept apart. She was
amazed that she had not lain awake worrying about him. She lay
with eyes wide open, scarcely thinking, until pain in her arm
attracted her attention. It was where Billy had gripped her. On
examination she found the bruised flesh fearfully black and blue.
She was astonished, not by the spiritual fact that such bruise
had been administered by the one she loved most in the world, but
by the sheer physical fact that an instant's pressure had
inflicted so much damage. The strength of a man was a terrible
thing. Quite impersonally, she found herself wondering if Charley
Long were as strong as Billy.
<P>
It was not until she dressed and built the fire that she began to
think about more immediate things. Billy had not returned. Then
he was arrested. What was she to do?--leave him in jail, go away,
and start life afresh? Of course it was impossible to go on
living with a man who had behaved as he had. But then, came
another thought, WAS it impossible? After all, he was her
husband. FOR BETTER OR WORSE--the phrase reiterated itself, a
monotonous accompaniment to her thoughts, at the back of her
consciousness. To leave him was to surrender. She carried the
matter before the tribunal of her mother's memory. No; Daisy
would never have surrendered. Daisy was a fighter. Then she,
Saxon, must fight. Besides--and she acknowledged it--readily,
though in a cold, dead way--besides, Billy was better than most
husbands. Better than any other husband she had heard of, she
concluded, as she remembered many of his earlier nicenesses and
finenesses, and especially his eternal chant: NOTHING IS TOO GOOD
FOR US. THE ROBERTSES AIN'T ON THE CHEAP.
<P>
At eleven o'clock she had a caller. It was Bud Strothers, Billy's
mate on strike duty. Billy, he told her, had refused bail,
refused a lawyer, had asked to be tried by the Court, had pleaded
guilty, and had received a sentence of sixty dollars or thirty
days. Also, he had refused to let the boys pay his fine.
<P>
"He's clean looney," Strothers summed up. "Won't listen to
reason. Says he'll serve the time out. He's been tankin' up too
regular, I guess. His wheels are buzzin'. Here, he give me this
note for you. Any time you want anything send for me. The boys'll
all stand by Bill's wife. You belong to us, you know. How are you
off for money?"
<P>
Proudly she disclaimed any need for money, and not until her
visitor departed did she read Billy's note:
<P>
Dear Saxon--Bud Strothers is going to give you this. Don't worry
about me. I am going to take my medicine. I deserve it--you know
that. I guess I am gone bughouse. Just the same, I am sorry for
what I done. Don't come to see me. I don't want you to. If you
need money, the union will give you some. The business agent is
all right. I will be out in a month. Now, Saxon, you know I love
you, and just say to yourself that you forgive me this time, and
you won't never have to do it again.
<P>
                                  Billy.
<P>
Bud Strothers was followed by Maggie Donahue, and Mrs. Olsen, who
paid neighborly calls of cheer and were tactful in their offers
of help and in studiously avoiding more reference than was
necessary to Billy's predicament.
<P>
In the afternoon James Harmon arrived. He limped slightly, and
Saxon divined that he was doing his best to minimize that
evidence of hurt. She tried to apologize to him, but he would not
listen.
<P>
"I don't blame you, Mrs. Roberts," he said. "I know it wasn't
your doing. But your husband wasn't just himself, I guess. He was
fightin' mad on general principles, and it was just my luck to
get in the way, that was all."
<P>
"But just the same--"
<P>
The fireman shook his head.
<P>
"I know all about it. I used to punish the drink myself, and I
done some funny things in them days. And I'm sorry I swore that
warrant out and testified. But I was hot in the collar. I'm
cooled down now, an' I'm sorry I done it."
<P>
"You're awfully good and kind," she said, and then began
hesitantly on what was bothering her. "You ... you can't stay
now, with him... away, you know."
<P>
"Yes; that wouldn't do, would it? I'll tell you: I'll pack up
right now, and skin out, and then, before six o'clock, I'll send
a wagon for my things. Here's the key to the kitchen door."
<P>
Much as he demurred, she compelled him to receive back the
unexpired portion of his rent. He shook her hand heartily at
leaving, and tried to get her to promise to call upon him for a
loan any time she might be in need.
<P>
"It's all right," he assured her. "I'm married, and got two boys.
One of them's got his lungs touched, and she's with 'em down in
Arizona campin' out. The railroad helped with passes."
<P>
And as he went down the steps she wondered that so kind a man
should be in so madly cruel a world.
<P>
The Donahue boy threw in a spare evening paper, and Saxon found
half a column devoted to Billy. It was not nice. The fact that he
had stood up in the police court with his eyes blacked from some
other fray was noted. He was described as a bully, a hoodlum, a
rough-neck, a professional slugger whose presence in the ranks
was a disgrace to organized labor. The assault he had pleaded
guilty of was atrocious and unprovoked, and if he were a fair
sample of a striking teamster, the only wise thing for Oakland to
do was to break up the union and drive every member from the
city. And, finally, the paper complained at the mildness of the
sentence. It should have been six months at least. The judge was
quoted as expressing regret that he had been unable to impose a
six months' sentence, this inability being due to the condition
of the jails, already crowded beyond capacity by the many eases
of assault committed in the course of the various strikes.
<P>
That night, in bed, Saxon experienced her first loneliness. Her
brain seemed in a whirl, and her sleep was broken by vain
gropings for the form of Billy she imagined at her side. At last,
she lighted the lamp and lay staring at the ceiling, wide-eyed,
conning over and over the details of the disaster that had
overwhelmed her. She could forgive, and she could not forgive.
The blow to her love-life had been too savage, too brutal. Her
pride was too lacerated to permit her wholly to return in memory
to the other Billy whom she loved. Wine in, wit out, she repeated
to herself; but the phrase could not absolve the man who had
slept by her side, and to whom she had consecrated herself. She
wept in the loneliness of the all-too-spacious bed, strove to
forget Billy's incomprehensible cruelty, even pillowed her cheek
with numb fondness against the bruise of her arm; but still
resentment burned within her, a steady flame of protest against
Billy and all that Billy had done. Her throat was parched, a dull
ache never ceased in her breast, and she was oppressed by a
feeling of goneness. WHY, WHY?--And from the puzzle of the world
came no solution.
<P>
In the morning she received a visit from Sarah--the second in all
the period of her marriage; and she could easily guess her
sister-in-law's ghoulish errand. No exertion was required for the
assertion of all of Saxon's pride. She refused to be in the
slightest on the defensive. There was nothing to defend, nothing
to explain. Everything was all right, and it was nobody's
business anyway. This attitude but served to vex Sarah.
<P>
"I warned you, and you can't say I didn't," her diatribe ran. "I
always knew he was no good, a jailbird, a hoodlum, a slugger. My
heart sunk into my boots when I heard you was runnin' with a
prizefighter. I told you so at the time. But no; you wouldn't
listen, you with your highfalutin' notions an' more pairs of
shoes than any decent woman should have. You knew better'n me.
An' I said then, to Tom, I said, 'It's all up with Saxon now.'
Them was my very words. Them that touches pitch is defiled. If
you'd only a-married Charley Long! Then the family wouldn't a-ben
disgraced. An' this is only the beginnin', mark me, only the
beginnin'. Where it'll end, God knows. He'll kill somebody yet,
that plug-ugly of yourn, an' be hanged for it. You wait an' see,
that's all, an' then you'll remember my words. As you make your
bed, so you will lay in it"
<P>
"Best bed I ever had," Saxon commented.
<P>
"So you can say, so you can say," Sarah snorted.
<P>
"I wouldn't trade it for a queen's bed," Saxon added.
<P>
"A jailbird's bed," Sarah rejoined witheringly.
<P>
"Oh, it's the style," Saxon retorted airily. "Everybody's getting
a taste of jail. Wasn't Tom arrested at some street meeting of
the socialists? Everybody goes to jail these days."
<P>
The barb had struck home.
<P>
"But Tom was acquitted," Sarah hastened to proclaim.
<P>
"Just the same he lay in jail all night without bail."
<P>
This was unanswerable, and Sarah executed her favorite tactic of
attack in flank.
<P>
"A nice come-down for you, I must say, that was raised straight
an' right, a-cuttin' up didoes with a lodger."
<P>
"Who says so?" Saxon blazed with an indignation quickly mastered.
<P>
"Oh, a blind man can read between the lines. A lodger, a young
married woman with no self respect, an' a prizefighter for a
husband--what else would they fight about?"
<P>
"Just like any family quarrel, wasn't it?" Saxon smiled placidly.
<P>
Sarah was shocked into momentary speechlessness.
<P>
"And I want you to understand it," Saxon continued. "It makes a
woman proud to have men fight over her. I am proud. Do you hear?
I am proud. I want you to tell them so. I want you to tell all
your neighbors. Tell everybody. I am no cow. Men like me. Men
fight for me. Men go to jail for me. What is a woman in the world
for, if it isn't to have men like her? Now, go, Sarah; go at
once, and tell everybody what you've read between the lines. Tell
them Billy is a jailbird and that I am a bad woman whom all men
desire. Shout it out, and good luck to you. And get out of my
house. And never put your feet in it again. You are too decent a
woman to come here. You might lose your reputation. And think of
your children. Now get out. Go."
<P>
Not until Sarah had taken an amazed and horrified departure did
Saxon fling herself on the bed in a convulsion of tears. She had
been ashamed, before, merely of Billy's inhospitality, and
surliness, and unfairness. But she could see, now, the light in
which others looked on the affair. It had not entered Saxon's
head. She was confident that it had not entered Billy's. She knew
his attitude from the first. Always he had opposed taking a
lodger because of his proud faith that his wife should not work.
Only hard times had compelled his consent, and, now that she
looked back, almost had she inveigled him into consenting.
<P>
But all this did not alter the viewpoint the neighborhood must
hold, that every one who had ever known her must hold. And for
this, too, Billy was responsible. It was more terrible than all
the other things he had been guilty of put together. She could
never look any one in the face again. Maggie Donahue and Mrs.
Olsen had been very kind, but of what must they have been
thinking all the time they talked with her? And what must they
have said to each other? What was everybody saying?--over front
gates and back fences,--the men standing on the corners or
talking in saloons?
<P>
Later, exhausted by her grief, when the tears no longer fell, she
grew more impersonal, and dwelt on the disasters that had
befallen so many women since the strike troubles began--Otto
Frank's wife, Henderson's widow, pretty Kittie Brady, Mary, all
the womenfolk of the other workmen who were now wearing the
stripes in San Quentin. Her world was crashing about her ears. No
one was exempt. Not only had she not escaped, but hers was the
worst disgrace of all. Desperately she tried to hug the delusion
that she was asleep, that it was all a nightmare, and that soon
the alarm would go off and she would get up and cook Billy's
breakfast so that he could go to work.
<P>
She did not leave the bed that day. Nor did she sleep. Her brain
whirled on and on, now dwelling at insistent length upon her
misfortunes, now pursuing the most fantastic ramifications of
what she considered her disgrace, and, again, going back to her
childhood and wandering through endless trivial detail. She
worked at all the tasks she had ever done, performing, in fancy,
the myriads of mechanical movements peculiar to each
occupation--shaping and pasting in the paper box factory, ironing
in the laundry, weaving in the jute mill, peeling fruit in the
cannery and countless boxes of scalded tomatoes. She attended all
her dances and all her picnics over again; went through her
school days, recalling the face and name and seat of every
schoolmate; endured the gray bleakness of the years in the orphan
asylum; revisioned every memory of her mother, every tale; and
relived all her life with Billy. But ever--and here the torment
lay--she was drawn back from these far-wanderings to her present
trouble, with its parch in the throat, its ache in the breast,
and its gnawing, vacant goneness.
