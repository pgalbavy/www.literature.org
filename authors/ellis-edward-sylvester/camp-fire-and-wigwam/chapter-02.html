<p>One of the commendable habits of the early settlers and old-fashioned
folks was that of retiring and rising early. They were ardent
believers in the saying of Poor Richard that "early to bed, and
early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise."</p>

<p>It was not yet nine o'clock, when Jack and Otto, despite the
deep interest they felt in their projected campaign, voluntarily
withdrew to the other room, where they fell asleep within five
minutes after their heads touched the pillow. The mother remained
by the fire some time after the boys withdrew. Her small white
fingers flitted hither back and forth, while her mild brown eyes
seemed to look beyond the flashing needles, and into the glowing
coals on the hearth. Her thoughts were sad and sorrowful, as they
always were when she sat thus alone. They wandered back to that
awful time when her loved husband was stricken down in defence
of her and their little boy.</p>

<p>But to-night she was thinking more of that boy than of the father.
She saw how much like the latter he was growing, and she trembled
when she recalled that he was soon to start on another excursion
into the wilderness, to be gone for days, and likely for weeks,
and with no certainty of ever returning again.</p>

<p>As the night advanced, the fury of the storm diminished. At "low
twelve" the fall of rain ceased altogether. The wind blew strongly,
sometimes with a power which caused the strongest trees to bow
their heads to the blast. As the morning approached, it died out
altogether, and the sun rose on one of the fairest days that ever
was seen.</p>

<p>Early as was the orb, the inmates of the cabin were waiting to
greet it when it appeared above the horizon. The boys were in
high spirits over the beautiful morning, and both felt that it
promised well for the venture before them.</p>

<p>"I tell you <em>we're going to win</em>!" said Jack, compressing
his lips and shaking his head. "I feel it in my bones, as your
father says, just before a storm comes."</p>

<p>"Dot's vot I dinks," assented Otto, whose only discomfort was
his exceeding hunger: "Vot you dinks, Mrs. Carleton?"</p>

<p>"I hope you will not be disappointed; that is the most I can
say. Jack's feeling that you are going to succeed is simply his
pleasure over the prospect of a ramble in the woods. We will eat
breakfast, after which you can go home and make your preparations
for the journey."</p>

<p>When they were seated at the table and Otto's hunger was nearly
satisfied, he told his friends with a grin, that it was the first
food he had tasted in twenty-four hours. They were shocked, and
both took him to task for his failure to make known the truth
the evening before. He made the philosophic reply that if he had
done so he would have missed the boundless enjoyment of such a
meal as that of which he was then partaking.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carleton on rising in the morning felt that Otto ought not
to be allowed to go on the expedition until after a further talk
with his parents, who, despite what they had said, might be unwilling
for him to engage in such an undertaking; but when she learned
how the poor fellow had been made to suffer with hunger her feelings
changed. It was hard to repress her indignation, and she made
up her mind to talk to the cruel folks as they had never been
talked to before; but she allowed no impatient word to escape
her in the presence of their son. She simply advised him to depart
as soon as he could upon the hunt for the horse, and not to return,
if possible, until it was recovered or another obtained.</p>

<p>"Dot is vot I does," replied Otto with a shake of his head and
a determined expression; "Otto doesn't comes back till he brings
some kind of animal&mdash;if it's only a 'coon or 'possum."</p>

<p>When he walked over to his own home (the building for which was
precisely the same as that of widow Carleton), his father and
mother were eating their breakfast. They looked surlily at him
as he entered, and the mother showed her incredible heartlessness
by asking her only child in German:</p>

<p>"Where is Toby that you lost?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell, mother, except that he is in the woods? I tried
hard to find him again, and had it not been for Deerfoot I would
have lost my life; but he is gone."</p>

<p>"Did I not tell you to go and not come back until you brought
him with you?" demanded the father, glaring at his boy as though
he was ready to throttle him.</p>

<p>"So you did&mdash;so you did; but I couldn't do much last night, when
it was so dark and stormy. I have come over to get my gun and
ammunition."</p>

<p>The father and mother looked in each other's faces, as though
in doubt whether they would let the lad have the property, but
before the question could be debated Otto had flung the powder-horn
over his shoulders, adjusted the bullet-pouch, shoved the hunting-knife
in the girdle at his waist, and walked to the front door, where
he halted and looked back.</p>

<p>"Can't I have breakfast before I go?"</p>

<p>"No!" fairly shouted the father; "begone; you shall not have
a mouthful under my roof till you bring back the colt you have
lost."</p>

<p>"Nobody wants anything you've got on <em>that</em> table," the
lad was indignant enough to reply: "I've had one meal that was
worth more than a dozen like that. Good-by!"</p>

<p>And before the dumfounded parents could rally from the unparalleled
impudence of the youth he was gone.</p>

<p>When he reached the home of Jack Carleton, the latter was waiting
and impatient to start. Jack had already kissed his mother good-by
several times and he repeated the fond embrace. Tears were in
the eyes of both, and the mother stood in the door of her cabin
shading her eyes with her hand until the two passed from sight
in the forest beyond the clearing.</p>

<p>Several of the pioneers who were busy about the settlement greeted
the boys and inquired their errand. Colonel Martin shook hands
with them, and asked all the particulars of the business on which
they were engaged. His age and position authorized him to ask
such searching questions, had the couple been full-grown men instead
of boys.</p>

<p>Otto answered truthfully, and the colonel smiled grimly and shook
his head.</p>

<p>"It's mighty little chance you have of ever finding <em>that</em>
horse again, but you may come upon another. Take my advice, however,"
added the colonel with a wink of his left eye, "make certain the
owner isn't in sight when you walk off with the animal."</p>

<p>"Why, colonel, you don't think we mean to steal a horse!" exclaimed
the horrified Jack.</p>

<p>"Certainly not&mdash;certainly not," the principal man of the settlement
hastened to say, "I don't believe you could be persuaded to do
such a thing&mdash;that is if the owner was looking."</p>

<p>"We couldn't be persuaded to do such a thing <em>under any circumstances</em>,"
exclaimed Jack, his face flushing over the idea that any one who
knew him should suspect him capable of such a crime.</p>

<p>"See here," said the colonel, dropping his voice and stepping
in front of them, "you tell me you are going after a horse. Have
you the money with you to buy one?"</p>

<p>"No; we cannot get one <em>that</em> way."</p>

<p>"I judged not; how then do you propose to obtain him?"</p>

<p>"Toby, the colt belonging to Otto's father, is wandering in the
woods not very far away&#11834;"</p>

<p>"How do you know he is?" interrupted the colonel.</p>

<p>"Why, he was doing so only a few days ago."</p>

<p>"That is no proof that he is keeping it up; in fact it is scarcely
possible that such is the case. Recollect, my boy, that several
tribes of Indians hunt through this portion of Louisiana, and
they would be much quicker than you to observe the trail of a
horse wearing an iron shoe; they would be inquiring enough also
to investigate for themselves, and, when they came upon the colt,
they would snap him up quicker than lightning."</p>

<p>The boys felt that somehow or other the wonderful young Shawanoe
would appear at the right moment and lend them the help which
they were certain to need. Should he fail to do so, they could
no more recapture and take the colt to his owner than they could
penetrate into the Dark and Bloody Ground and bring back the great
war chief Tecumseh as a prisoner.</p>

<p>But neither Colonel Martin nor any one in the village knew anything
about the extraordinary Indian youth, and, while Jack was asking
himself whether he should linger long enough to explain the situation,
the gentleman relieved them from the embarrassment by a hearty
slap on the shoulder of Jack, and the exclamations:</p>

<p>"I was once a boy myself! I haven't forgotten that jolly time:
we always liked to have some sort of excuse when we went off on
a frolic. You see what a lot of work there is to do in clearing
the ground and getting it ready for cultivation; you would much
rather be hunting and rambling through the woods; I can't say
I blame you, so off with you, and when you come back with word
that the horse was mean enough to keep out of your way, why we
won't be too hard on you."</p>

<p>And with another resounding slap, the hearty colonel gave the
boys a vigorous shove which sent them forward among the trees,
near which they had halted.</p>
