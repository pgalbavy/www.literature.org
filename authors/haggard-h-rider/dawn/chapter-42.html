<p>"Why, Arthur, I had almost forgotten what you are like," said Mildred,
when that young gentleman at last put in an appearance at the Quinta.
"Where have you been to all this time?"
</p>
<p>"I--oh, I have been writing letters," said Arthur.
</p><p>"Then they must have been very long ones. Don't tell fibs, Arthur; you
have not stopped away from here for a day and a half in order to write
letters. What is the matter with you?"
</p><p>"Well, if you must know, Mildred, I detest your friend Lord Minster,
the mere sight of him sets my teeth on edge, and I did not want to
meet him. I only came here to-day because Lady Florence told me that
they were going up to the Convent this afternoon."
</p><p>"So you have been to see Lady Florence?"
</p><p>"No, I met her buying fruit yesterday, and went for a walk with her."
</p><p>"In the intervals of the letter-writing?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Well, do you know I detest Lady Florence?"
</p><p>"That is very unkind of you. She is charming."
</p><p>"From your point of view, perhaps, as her brother is from mine."
</p><p>"Do you mean to tell me that you think that horrid fellow charming?"
asked Arthur in disgust.
</p><p>"Why should I not?"
</p><p>"Oh, for the matter of that there is no reason why you should not, but
I can't congratulate you either on your friend or your taste."
</p><p>"Leaving my taste out of the question, why do you call Lord Minster my
friend?"
</p><p>"Because Miss Terry told me that he was; she said that he was always
proposing to you, and that you would probably marry him in the end."
</p><p>Mildred blushed faintly.
</p><p>"She has no business to tell you; but, for the matter of that, so have
many other men. It does not follow that, because they choose to
propose to me, they are my friends."
</p><p>"No, but then they have not married you."
</p><p>"No more has he; but, while we are talking of it, why should I not
marry Lord Minster? He can give me position, influence, everything
that is dear to a woman, except the rarest of all gifts--love."
</p><p>"But is love so rare, Mildred?"
</p><p>"Yes, the love that it can satisfy a woman either to receive or to
give, especially the latter, for in this we are more blessed in giving
than in receiving. It is but very rarely that the most fortunate of us
get a chance of accepting such love as I mean, and we can only give it
once in our lives. But you have not told me your reasons against my
marrying Lord Minster."
</p><p>"Because he is a mean-spirited, selfish man. If he were not, he could
not have talked as he did last night. Because you do not love him,
Mildred, you cannot love such a man as that, if he were fifty times a
member of the Government."
</p><p>"What does it matter to you, Arthur," she said, in a voice of
indescribable softness, bending her sunny head low over her work,
"whether I love him or not; my doing so would not make your heart beat
the faster."
</p><p>"I don't wish you to marry him," he said, confusedly.
</p><p>She raised her head and looked full at him with eyes which shone like
stars through a summer mist.
</p><p>"That is enough, Arthur," she answered, in a tone of gentle
submission, "if you do not wish it, I will not," and, rising, she left
the room.
</p><p>Arthur blushed furiously at her words, and a new sensation crept over
him.
</p><p>"Surely," he said to himself, "she cannot---- No, of course she only
means that she will take my advice."
</p><p>But, though he dismissed the suspicion thus readily, it left something
that he could not quite define behind it. He had, after the manner of
young men were women are concerned, thought that he understood Mildred
thoroughly; now he came to the modest conclusion that he knew very
little about her.
</p><p>On the following afternoon, when he was at the Quinta talking as usual
to Mrs. Carr, he saw Lord Minster coming up the steps of the portico,
dressed in much the same way and with exactly the same air as he was
accustomed to assume when he mounted those of the "Reform," or
occasionally, if he thought that the "hungry electors" wanted
"pandering" to, those of the new "National Club."
</p><p>"Hullo," said Arthur, "here comes Lord Minster in his war paint, frock
coat, tall hat, eye-glass and all. Good-bye."
</p><p>"Why do you go away, Arthur? Stop and protect me," said Mildred,
laughing.
</p><p>"Oh, no, indeed, I don't want to spoil sport. I would not interfere
with your amusement on any account."
</p><p>Mildred looked a little vexed.
</p><p>"Well, you will come back to dinner?"
</p><p>"That depends upon what happens."
</p><p>"I told you what would happen, Arthur. Good-bye."
</p><p>"Perhaps it is as well to get it over at once," thought Mildred.
</p><p>In the hall Arthur met Lord Minster, and they passed with a gesture of
recognition so infinitesimally small that it almost faded into the
nothingness of a "cut." So far as he could condescend to notice so low
a thing at all, his lordship had conceived a great dislike for Arthur.
</p><p>"How do you do, Lord Minster?" said Mildred, cordially. "I hear that
you went to the Convent yesterday; what did you think of the view?"
</p><p>"The view, Mrs. Carr--was there a view? I did not notice it; indeed, I
only went up there at all to please Florence. I don't like that sort
of thing."
</p><p>"If you don't like roughing it, I am afraid that you did not enjoy
your voyage out."
</p><p>"Well, no, I don't think I did, and there was a low fellow on board
who had been ruined by the retrocession of the Transvaal, and who,
hearing that I was in the Government, took every possible opportunity
to tell me publicly that his wife and children were almost in a state
of starvation, as though I cared about his confounded wife and
children. He was positively brutal. No, certainly I did not enjoy it.
However, I am rewarded by finding you here."
</p><p>"I am very much flattered."
</p><p>Lord Minster fixed his eye-glass firmly in his eye, planted his hands
at the bottom of his trousers pockets, and, clearing his throat,
placed himself in the attitude that was so familiar to the House, and
began.
</p><p>"Mrs. Carr, I told you, when last I had the pleasure of seeing you,
that I should take the first opportunity of renewing a conversation
that I was forced to suspend in order to attend, if my memory serves
me, a very important committee meeting. I was therefore surprised,
indeed I may almost say hurt, when I found that you had suddenly
flitted from London."
</p><p>"Indeed, Lord Minster?"
</p><p>"I will not, however, take up the time of this--I mean your time, by
recapitulating all that I told you on that occasion; the facts are, so
to speak, all upon the table, and I will merely touch upon the main
heads of my case. My prospects are these: I am now a member of the
Cabinet, and enjoy, owing to the unusual but calculated recklessness
of my non-official public utterances, an extraordinary popularity with
a large section of the country, the hungry section to which I alluded
last night. It is probable that the course of the present Government
is pretty nearly run, the country is sick of it, and those who put it
into power have not got enough out of it. A dissolution is therefore
an event of the near future; the Conservatives will come in, but they
have no power of organization, and very little political talent at
their backs, above all, they are deficient in energy, probably because
there is nothing that they can destroy and therefore no pickings to
struggle for. In short, they are not 'capaces imperii.' The want of
these qualities and of leaders will very soon undermine their hold
upon the country, always a slight one, and, assisted by a few other
pushing men, I anticipate, by carefully playing into the hands of the
Irish party which will really rule England in the future, being able,
as one of the leaders of the Opposition, to consummate their downfall.
Then will come my opportunity, and, if luck goes with me, I shall be
first Lord of the Treasury within half a dozen years. But now comes
the difficulty. Though I am so popular with the country, I am, for
some reason quite inexplicable to myself, rather at a--hum--a discount
amongst my colleagues and that influential section of society to which
they belong. Now, in order to succeed to the full extent that I have
planned, it is absolutely essential that I should win the countenance
of this class, and the only way that I can see of doing it is by
marrying some woman charming enough to disarm dislike, beautiful
enough to command admiration, rich enough to entertain profusely, and
clever enough to rule England. Those desiderata are all to a striking
degree united in your person, Mrs. Carr, and I have therefore much
pleasure in asking you to become my wife."
</p><p>"You have, as I understand you, Lord Minster, made a very admirable
statement of how desirable it is for yourself that you should marry
me, but it is not so clear what advantage I should reap by marrying
you."
</p><p>"Why, the advantages are obvious: if by your help I can become Prime
Minister, you would become the wife of the Prime Minister."
</p><p>"The prospect fails to dazzle me. I have everything that I want; why
should I strive to reach a grandeur to which I was not born, and
which, to speak the truth, I regard with a very complete indifference?
But there is another point. In all your speech you have said nothing
of any affection that you have to offer, not a single word of love--
you have been content to expatiate on the profits that a matrimonial
investment would bring to yourself, and by reflection, to the other
contracting party."
</p><p>"Love," asked Lord Minster, with an expression of genuine surprise;
"why, you talk like a character in a novel; now tell me, Mrs. Carr,
<u>what</u> is love?"
</p><p>"It is difficult to define, Lord Minster; but as you ask me to do so,
I will try. Love to a woman is what the sun is to the world, it is her
life, her animating principle, without which she must droop, and, if
the plant be very tender, die. Except under its influence, a woman can
never attain her full growth, never touch the height of her
possibilities, or bloom into the plenitude of her moral beauty. A
loveless marriage dwarfs our natures, a marriage where love is
develops them to their utmost."
</p><p>"And what is love to a man?"
</p><p>"Well, I should say that nine of a man's passions are merely episodes
in his career, the mile-stones that mark his path; the tenth, or the
first, is his philosopher's stone that turns all things to gold, or,
if the charm does not work, leaves his heart, broken and bankrupt, a
cold monument of failure."
</p><p>"I don't quite follow you, and I must say that, speaking for myself, I
never felt anything of all this," said Lord Minster, blankly.
</p><p>"I know you do not, Lord Minster; your only passions tend towards
political triumphs and personal aggrandisement; we are at the two
poles, you see, and I fear that we can never, never meet upon a common
matrimonial line. But don't be down-hearted about it, you will find
plenty more women who fulfil all your requirements and will be very
happy to take you at your own valuation. If only a woman is necessary
to success, you need not look far, and forgive me if I say that I
believe it will not make much difference to you who she is. But all
the same, Lord Minster, I will venture to give you a piece of advice:
next time you propose, address yourself a little more to the lady's
affections and a little less to her interests," and Mrs. Carr rose as
though to show that the interview was at an end.
</p><p>"Am I then to understand that my offer is definitely refused?" asked
Lord Minster, stiffly.
</p><p>"I am afraid so, and I am sure that you will, on reflection, see how
utterly unsuited we are to each other."
</p><p>"Possibly, Mrs. Carr, possibly; at present all that I see is that you
have had a great opportunity, and have failed to avail yourself of it.
My only consolation is that the loss will be yours, and my only regret
is that I have had the trouble of coming to this place for nothing.
However, there is a ship due to-morrow, and I shall sail in her."
</p><p>"I am sorry to have been the cause of bringing you here, Lord Minster,
and still more sorry that you should feel obliged to cut short your
stay. Good-bye, Lord Minster; we part friends, I hope?"
</p><p>"Oh, certainly, Mrs. Carr. I wish you a very good morning, Mrs. Carr,"
and his lordship marched out of Mildred's life.
</p><p>"There goes my chance of becoming the wife of a prime minister, and
making a figure in history," said that lady, as she watched his tall
figure stalking stiffly down the avenue. "Well, I am glad of it. I
would just as soon have married a speech-making figure-head stuffed
full of the purest Radical principles."
</p><p>On the following day Arthur met Lady Florence again in the town.
</p><p>"Where have you been to, Lady Florence?" he said.
</p><p>"To see my brother off," she answered, without any signs of deep
grief.
</p><p>"What, has he gone already?"
</p><p>"Yes; your friend Mrs. Carr has been too many for poor James."
</p><p>"What! do you mean that he has been proposing?"
</p><p>"Yes, and got more than he bargained for."
</p><p>"Is he cut up?"
</p><p>"He, no, but his vanity is. You see, Mr. Heigham, it is this way. My
brother may be a very great man and a pillar of the State, and all
that sort of thing. I don't say he isn't; but from personal experience
I <u>know</u> that he is an awful prig, and thinks that all women are
machines constructed to advance the comfort of your noble sex. Well,
he has come down a peg or two, that's all, and he don't like it. Goodbye; 
I'm in a hurry."
</p><p>Lady Florence was nothing if not outspoken.
