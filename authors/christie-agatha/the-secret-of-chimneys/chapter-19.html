<p>They all stared at the French detective, who smiled back at them.</p>

<p>"But yes," he said, "it is true."</p>

<p>There was a pause for a general readjusting of ideas. Then Virginia
turned to Battle.</p>

<p>"Do you know what I think, Superintendent Battle?"</p>

<p>"What do you think, Mrs. Revel?"</p>

<p>"I think the time has come to enlighten us a little."</p>

<p>"To enlighten you? I don’t quite understand, Mrs. Revel."</p>

<p>"Superintendent Battle, you understand perfectly. I dare say
Mr. Lomax has hedged you about with recommendations of secrecy—George
would, but surely it’s better to tell us than have us stumbling
on the secret all by ourselves, and perhaps doing untold harm.
M. Lemoine, don’t you agree with me?"</p>

<p>"Madame, I agree with you entirely."</p>

<p>"You can’t go on keeping things dark for ever," said Battle.
"I’ve told Mr. Lomax so. Mr. Eversleigh is Mr. Lomax’s secretary,
there’s no objection to his knowing what there is to know. As
for Mr. Cade, he’s been brought into the thing willy-nilly, and
I consider he’s a right to know where he stands. But——"</p>

<p>Battle paused.</p>

<p>"I know," said Virginia. "Women are so indiscreet! I’ve often
heard George say so."</p>

<p>Lemoine had been studying Virginia attentively. Now he turned
to the Scotland Yard man.</p>

<p>"Did I hear you just now address Madame by the name of Revel?"</p>

<p>"That is my name," said Virginia.</p>

<p>"Your husband was in the Diplomatic Service, was he not? And
you were with him in Herzoslovakia just before the assassination
of the late King and Queen."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Lemoine turned again.</p>

<p>"I think Madame has a right to hear the story. She is indirectly
concerned. Moreover"—his eyes twinkled a little—"Madame’s reputation
for discretion stands very high in Diplomatic circles."</p>

<p>"I’m glad they give me a good character," said Virginia, laughing.
"And I’m glad I’m not going to be left out of it."</p>

<p>"What about refreshments?" said Anthony. "Where does the conference
take place? Here?"</p>

<p>"If you please, sir," said Battle, "I’ve a fancy for not leaving
this room until morning. You’ll see why when you’ve heard the
story."</p>

<p>"Then I’ll go and forage," said Anthony.</p>

<p>Bill went with him and they returned with a tray of glasses,
siphons and other necessaries of life.</p>

<p>The augmented syndicate established itself comfortably in the
corner by the window, being grouped round a long oak table.</p>

<p>"It’s understood, of course," said Battle, "that anything that’s
said here is said in strict confidence. There must be no leakage.
I’ve always felt it would come out one of these days. Gentlemen
like Mr. Lomax who want everything hushed up take bigger risks
than they think. The start of this business was just over seven
years ago. There was a lot of what they call Reconstruction going
on—especially in the Near East. There was a good deal going on
in England, strictly on the <em>Q.T. </em>with that old gentleman,
Count Stylptitch, pulling the strings. All the Balkan States were
interested parties, and there were a lot of Royal Personages in
England just then. I’m not going into details, but Something disappeared—disappeared
in a way that seemed incredible unless you admitted two things—that
the thief was a Royal Personage and that at the same time it was
the work of a high-class professional. M. Lemoine here will tell
you how that well might be."</p>

<p>The Frenchman bowed courteously and took up the tale.</p>

<p>"It is possible that you in England may not even have heard of
our famous and fantastic King Victor. What his real name is, no
one knows, but he is a man of singular courage and daring, one
who speaks five languages and is unequalled in the art of disguise.
Though his father is known to have been either English or Irish,
he himself has worked chiefly in Paris. It was there, nearly eight
years ago, that he was carrying out a daring series of robberies
and living under the name of Captain O’Neill."</p>

<p>A faint exclamation escaped Virginia. M. Lemoine darted a keen
glance at her.</p>

<p>"I think I understand what agitates Madame. You will see in a
minute. Now we of the Sûreté had our suspicions that this Captain
O’Neill was none other than ‘King Victor,’ but we could not obtain
the necessary proof. There was also in Paris at the time a clever
young actress, Angèle Mory, of the Folies Bergères. For some time
we had suspected that she was associated with the operations of
King Victor. But again no proof was forthcoming.</p>

<p>"About that time, Paris was preparing for the visit of the young
King Nicholas IV of Herzoslovakia. At the Sûreté we were given
special instructions as to the course to be adopted to ensure
the safety of His Majesty. In particular we were warned to superintend
the activities of a certain Revolutionary organization which called
itself the Comrades of the Red Hand. It is fairly certain now
that the Comrades approached Angèle Mory and offered her a huge
sum if she would aid them in their plans. Her part was to infatuate
the young King, and decoy him to some spot agreed upon with them.
Angèle Mory accepted the bribe and promised to perform her part.</p>

<p>"But the young lady was cleverer and more ambitious than her
employers suspected. She succeeded in captivating the King who
fell desperately in love with her and loaded her with jewels.
It was then that she conceived the idea of being—not a King’s
mistress, but a Queen! As every one knows, she realized her ambition.
She was introduced into Herzoslovakia as the Countess Varaga Popoleffsky,
an offshoot of the Romanoffs, and became eventually Queen Varaga
of Herzoslovakia. Not bad for a little Parisian actress! I have
always heard that she played the part extremely well. But her
triumph was not to be long lived. The Comrades of the Red Hand,
furious at her betrayal, twice attempted her life. Finally they
worked up the country to such a pitch that a Revolution broke
out in which both the King and Queen perished. Their bodies, horribly
mutilated and hardly recognizable, were recovered, attesting to
the fury of the populace against the low-born foreign Queen.</p>

<p>"Now, in all this, it seems certain that Queen Varaga still kept
in with her confederate, King Victor. It is possible that the
bold plan was his all along. What is known is that she continued
to correspond with him, in a secret code, from the Court of Herzoslovakia.
For safety the letters were written in English, and signed with
the name of an English lady then at the Embassy. If any inquiry
had been made, and the lady in question had denied her signature,
it is possible that she would not have been believed, for the
letters were those of a guilty woman to her lover. It was your
name she used, Mrs. Revel."</p>

<p>"I know," said Virginia. Her colour was coming and going unevenly.
"So that is the truth of the letters! I have wondered and wondered."</p>

<p>"What a blackguardly trick," cried Bill indignantly.</p>

<p>"The letters were addressed to Captain O’Neill at his rooms in
Paris, and their principal purpose may have light shed upon it
by a curious fact which came to light later. After the assassination
of the King and Queen, many of the Crown Jewels which had fallen,
of course, into the hands of the mob, found their way to Paris,
and it was discovered that in nine cases out of ten the principal
stones had been replaced by paste—and mind you, there were some
very famous stones among the jewels of Herzoslovakia. So as a
Queen, Angèle Mory still practised her former activities.</p>

<p>"You see now where we have arrived. Nicholas IV and Queen Varaga
came to England and were the guests of the late Marquis of Caterham,
then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Herzoslovakia is
a small country, but it could not be left out. Queen Varaga was
necessarily received. And there we have a Royal Personage and
at the same time an expert thief. There is also no doubt that
the—er—substitute which was so wonderful as to deceive anyone
but an expert could only have been fashioned by King Victor, and
indeed the whole plan, in its daring and audacity, pointed to
him as the author."</p>

<p>"What happened?" asked Virginia.</p>

<p>"Hushed up," said Superintendent Battle laconically. "Not a mention
of it’s ever been made public to this day. We did all that could
be done on the quiet—and that was a good deal more than you’d
ever imagine, by the way. We’ve got methods of our own that would
surprise. That jewel didn’t leave England with the Queen of Herzoslovakia—I
can tell you that much. No, Her Majesty hid it somewhere—but where
we’ve never been able to discover. But I shouldn’t wonder"—Superintendent
Battle let his eyes wander gently round—"if it wasn’t somewhere
in this room."</p>

<p>Anthony leapt to his feet.</p>

<p>"What? After all these years?" he cried incredulously. "Impossible."</p>

<p>"You do not know the peculiar circumstances, monsieur," said
the Frenchman quickly. "Only a fortnight later, the Revolution
in Herzoslovakia broke out, and the King and Queen were murdered.
Also, Captain O’Neill was arrested in Paris and sentenced on a
minor charge. We hoped to find the packet of code letters in his
house, but it appears that this had been stolen by some Herzoslovakian
go-between. The man turned up in Herzoslovakia just before the
Revolution, and then disappeared completely."</p>

<p>"He probably went abroad," said Anthony thoughtfully. "To Africa
as likely as not. And you bet he hung on to that packet. It was
as good as a gold mine to him. It’s odd how things come about.
They probably called him Dutch Pedro or something like that out
there."</p>

<p>He caught Superintendent Battle’s expressionless glance bent
upon him, and smiled.</p>

<p>"It’s not really clairvoyance, Battle," he said, "though it sounds
like it. I’ll tell you presently."</p>

<p>"There is one thing you have not explained," said Virginia. "Where
does this link up with the Memoirs? There must be a link, surely?"</p>

<p>"Madame is very quick," said Lemoine approvingly. "Yes, there
is a link. Count Stylptitch was also staying at Chimneys at the
time."</p>

<p>"So that he might have known about it?"</p>

<p>"<em>Parfaitement.</em>"</p>

<p>"And, of course," said Battle, "if he’s blurted it out in his
precious Memoirs, the fat will be in the fire. Especially after
the way the whole thing was hushed up."</p>

<p>Anthony lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"There’s no possibility of there being a clue in the Memoirs
as to where the stone was hidden?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Very unlikely," said Battle decisively. "He was never in with
the Queen—opposed the marriage tooth and nail. She’s not likely
to have taken him into her confidence."</p>

<p>"I wasn’t suggesting such a thing for a minute," said Anthony.
"But by all accounts he was a cunning old boy. Unknown to her,
he may have discovered where she hid the jewel. In that case,
what would he have done, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Sat tight," said Battle, after a moment’s reflection.</p>

<p>"I agree," said the Frenchman. "It was a ticklish moment, you
see. To return the stone anonymously would have presented great
difficulties. Also, the knowledge of its whereabouts would give
him great power—and he liked power, that strange old man. Not
only did he hold the Queen in the hollow of his hand, but he had
a powerful weapon to negotiate with at any time. It was not the
only secret he possessed—oh, no!—he collected secrets like some
men collect rare pieces of china. It is said that, once or twice
before his death, he boasted to people of the things he could
make public if the fancy took him. And once at least he declared
that he intended to make some startling revelations in his Memoirs.
Hence"—the Frenchman smiled rather dryly—"the general anxiety
to get hold of them. Our own secret police intended to seize them,
but the Count took the precaution to have them conveyed away before
his death."</p>

<p>"Still, there’s no real reason to believe that he knew this particular
secret," said Battle.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Anthony quietly. "There are his own
words."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Both detectives stared at him as though unable to believe their
ears.</p>

<p>"When Mr. McGrath gave me that manuscript to bring to England,
he told me the circumstances of his one meeting with Count Stylptitch.
It was in Paris. At some considerable risk to himself, Mr. McGrath
rescued the Count from a band of Apaches. He was, I understand—shall
we say a trifle—exhilarated? Being in that condition, he made
two rather interesting remarks. One of them was to the effect
that he knew where the Koh-i-noor was—a statement to which my
friend paid very little attention. He also said that the gang
in question were King Victor’s men. Taken together, those two
remarks are very significant."</p>

<p>"Good Lord," ejaculated Superintendent Battle, "I should say
they were. Even the murder of Prince Michael wears a different
aspect."</p>

<p>"King Victor has never taken a life," the Frenchman reminded
him.</p>

<p>"Supposing he were surprised when he was searching for the jewel?"</p>

<p>"Is he in England, then?" asked Anthony sharply. "You say that
he was released a few months ago. Didn’t you keep track of him?"</p>

<p>A rather rueful smile overspread the French detective’s face.</p>

<p>"We tried to, monsieur. But he is a devil, that man. He gave
us the slip at once—at once. We thought, of course, that he would
make straight for England. But no. He went—where do you think?"</p>

<p>"Where?" said Anthony.</p>

<p>He was staring intently at the Frenchman, and absent-mindedly
his fingers played with a box of matches.</p>

<p>"To America. To the United States."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>There was sheer amazement in Anthony’s tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, and what do you think he called himself? What part do you
think he played over there? The part of Prince Nicholas of Herzoslovakia."</p>

<p>The match-box fell from Anthony’s hand, but his amazement was
fully equalled by that of Battle.</p>

<p>"Impossible."</p>

<p>"Not so, my friend. You, too, will get the news in the morning.
It has been the most colossal bluff. As you know, Prince Nicholas
was rumoured to have died in the Congo years ago. Our friend,
King Victor, seizes on that—difficult to prove a death of that
kind. He resurrects Prince Nicholas, and plays him to such purpose
that he gets away with a tremendous haul of American dollars—all
on account of the supposed oil concessions. But by a mere accident,
he was unmasked, and had to leave the country hurriedly. This
time he did come to England. And that is why I am here. Sooner
or later he will come to Chimneys. That is, if he is not already
here!"</p>

<p>"You think—that?"</p>

<p>"I think he was here the night Prince Michael died, and again
last night."</p>

<p>"It was another attempt, eh?" said Battle.</p>

<p>"It was another attempt."</p>

<p>"What has bothered me," continued Battle, "was wondering what
had become of M. Lemoine here. I’d had word from Paris that he
was on his way over to work with me, and I couldn’t make out why
he hadn’t turned up."</p>

<p>"I must indeed apologize," said Lemoine. "You see, I arrived
on the morning after the murder. It occurred to me at once that
it would be as well for me to study things from an unofficial
standpoint without appearing officially as your colleague. I thought
that great possibilities lay that way. I was, of course, aware
that I was bound to be an object of suspicion, but that in a way
furthered my plan since it would not put people I was after on
their guard. I can assure you that I have seen a good deal that
is interesting in the last two days."</p>

<p>"But look here," said Bill, "what really did happen last night?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid," said M. Lemoine, "that I gave you rather violent
exercise."</p>

<p>"It was you I chased then?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I will recount things to you. I came up here to watch,
convinced that the secret had to do with this room since the Prince
had been killed here. I stood outside on the terrace. Presently
I became aware that some one was moving about in this room. I
could see the flash of a torch now and again. I tried the middle
window and found it unlatched. Whether the man had entered that
way earlier, or whether he had left it so as a blind in case he
was disturbed, I do not know. Very gently, I pushed it back and
slipped inside the room. Step by step I felt my way until I was
in a spot where I could watch operations without likelihood of
being discovered myself. The man himself I could not see clearly.
His back was to me, of course, and he was silhouetted against
the light of the torch so that his outline only could be seen.
But his actions filled me with surprise. He took to pieces first
one and then the other of those two suits of armour, examining
each one piece by piece. When he had convinced himself that what
he sought was not there, he began tapping the panelling of the
wall under that picture. What he would have done next, I do not
know. The interruption came. <em>You</em> burst in——" He looked
at Bill.</p>

<p>"Our well-meant interference was really rather a pity," said
Virginia thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"In a sense, madame, it was. The man switched out his torch,
and I, who had no wish as yet to be forced to reveal my identity,
sprang for the window. I collided with the other two in the dark,
and fell headlong. I sprang up and out through the window. Mr.
Eversleigh, taking me for his assailant, followed."</p>

<p>"I followed you first," said Virginia. "Bill was only second
in the race."</p>

<p>"And the other fellow had the sense to stay still and sneak out
through the door. I wonder he didn’t meet the rescuing crowd."</p>

<p>"That would present no difficulties," said Lemoine. "He would
be a rescuer in advance of the rest, that was all."</p>

<p>"Do you really think this Arsène Lupin fellow is actually among
the household now?" asked Bill, his eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Lemoine. "He could pass perfectly as a servant.
For all we may know, he may be Boris Anchoukoff, the trusted servant
of the late Prince Michael."</p>

<p>"He is an odd-looking bloke," agreed Bill.</p>

<p>But Anthony was smiling.</p>

<p>"That’s hardly worthy of you, M. Lemoine," he said gently.</p>

<p>The Frenchman smiled too.</p>

<p>"You’ve taken him on as your valet now, haven’t you, Mr. Cade?"
asked Superintendent Battle.</p>

<p>"Battle, I take off my hat to you. You know everything. But just
as a matter of detail, he’s taken me on, not I him."</p>

<p>"Why was that, I wonder, Mr. Cade?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know," said Anthony lightly. "It’s a curious taste,
but perhaps he may have liked my face. Or he may think I murdered
his master and wish to establish himself in a handy position for
executing revenge upon me."</p>

<p>He rose and went over to the windows, pulling the curtains.</p>

<p>"Daylight," he said, with a slight yawn. "There won’t be any
more excitements now."</p>

<p>Lemoine rose also.</p>

<p>"I will leave you," he said. "We shall perhaps meet again later
in the day."</p>

<p>With a graceful bow to Virginia, he stepped out of the window.</p>

<p>"Bed," said Virginia, yawning. "It’s all been very exciting.
Come on, Bill, go to bed like a good little boy. The breakfast
table will see us not, I fear."</p>

<p>Anthony stayed at the window looking after the retreating form
of M. Lemoine.</p>

<p>"You wouldn’t think it," said Battle behind him, "but that’s
supposed to be the cleverest detective in France."</p>

<p>"I don’t know that I wouldn’t," said Anthony thoughtfully. "I
rather think I would."</p>

<p>"Well," said Battle, "he was right about the excitements of this
night being over. By the way, do you remember my telling you about
that man they’d found shot near Staines?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Why?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. They’ve identified him, that’s all. It seems he was
called Giuseppe Manelli. He was a waiter at the Blitz in London.
Curious, isn’t it?"</p>
