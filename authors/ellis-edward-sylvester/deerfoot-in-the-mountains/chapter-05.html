<p>The first sign that caught the eye of the Shawanoe was the mute
forms of the five Nez Perces, stretched here and there over a
space of an eighth of a mile. All had been scalped and mutilated.
But he had seen such shocking sights before, and he did not go
near the bodies nor give them further attention. It was no great
task for him to transfer his interest from the trail of one party
to that of another, and he was speedily loping forward as rapidly
as before.</p>

<p>To his astonishment he had gone only a little way when he discovered
a marked change of course. The Assiniboine footprints pointed
to the northeast. The information gained from the dwarf was reliable;
the horsemen were heading for their own villages.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe called all his consummate woodcraft into play to
determine how much time had passed since the party rode over this
ground. He figured that it must have been on the previous day,
though such conclusion did not fully accord with what was told
him by the chieftain Amokeat. His opinion of that leader, however,
made him ready to believe anything ill of him.</p>

<p>If the horsemen had twenty-four hours the start of their pursuer,
and kept up their rapid flight, he could hardly expect to come
up with them for several days. Deerfoot believed he could steadily
gain, but he was on foot and they were mounted. Such gain, in
the most favorable circumstances, must be gradual. Had they halted
for any length of time, or diverged from the regular course, the
prospect would be all the more favorable for him.</p>

<p>With this theory, Deerfoot now made a change of policy. Instead
of keeping to the trail with all its windings (made in order to
accommodate the horses), he adopted his other recourse&mdash;that of
reasoning out the route most likely to be followed by the warriors,
and, fixing upon a camp far in advance, making his way thither
by the most direct course. Provided he fell into no error, he
would thus save miles of distance and hours of time.</p>

<p>It was still early in the day when he forded a narrow, rapid
stream, in which the water rose to his waist, and climbing the
nearest elevation, which was a ridge crowned with rocks and a
few stunted cedars, he paused to make a study of the country spread
before him.</p>

<p>Naturally his first scrutiny was directed to the northeast. In
that direction the surface was rolling, with numerous valleys
and mountain spurs, but none of the latter was of great height.
The towering peaks rose more to the north and west. There was
variety and yet sameness in the vast undulating expanse, with
its wealth of wood, of rocks, some bleak and dark of color, and
others fringed with vegetation, of swelling hills, many of which
elsewhere would have been called mountains, and beautiful valleys,
with numerous streams hidden through most of their flow, all seeking
an outlet in the Atlantic or Pacific, hundreds of miles away.</p>

<p>The bed of one mountain torrent could be traced for a long distance
by the mist that hovered over it, though the spectator could not
catch the first sight of the water itself. At another point to
the right the Shawanoe saw what appeared to be a curved streak
of silver, fifty feet in height and but two or three feet wide.
It looked to be absolutely motionless, and yet it was a waterfall,
from whose foamy base little clouds of steam floated upward or
were wafted aside by the wisps of wind.</p>

<p>Deerfoot refrained from using the instrument until he had done
all he could with his unaided vision. His reason for this was
his wish to place himself in the same situation as the Assiniboine
party. None of them knew what a spyglass is, and he tried to reason
from what he saw upon what point they would be likely to fix as
their halting place.</p>

<p>Had he known the precise minute or hour when the horsemen had
ridden past the spot near where he was standing, the problem would
have been easy of solution, but no Indian or white hunter ever
lived who could settle such a question without more definite data.
We hear stories of achievements of that nature, but most of them
are mythical, though the woodcraft of many a trailer has enabled
him to do things which to others were impossible.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe believed the Assiniboines had ridden past at a moderate
pace about the middle of the preceding day. Acting on that supposition,
he selected a point somewhat more than a dozen miles to the northeast
as the one where they would have been likely to encamp for the
night. The trouble was that there was little in the wooded place,
near a small body of water, bearing a striking resemblance to
the lake of the previous day, to favor it above others in the
neighborhood. They might have halted several miles beyond or that
much nearer the standpoint of the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>At the best it was guesswork; but having made his conjecture,
Deerfoot now raised the glass to his eyes and centered his attention
upon the spot. As he did so he was thrilled by a discovery which
set his nerves at once on edge.</p>

<p>On the edge of the trees, near the lake itself, he saw two Indians,
standing as if in conversation. When he lowered the glass it was
impossible to make them out at so great distance, but the instrument
revealed them clearly. Suddenly one of the couple came forward
to the body of water, lay down on his face and drank. The other
walked part of the way and then stopped, and was rejoined by the
former. It looked as if they resumed their converse over some
subject in which they were unusually interested.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was almost certain that the two were members of the
party for whom he was hunting. If such were the fact, something
must have occurred to cause them to linger on their return to
their villages.</p>

<p>While he was speculating as to whether this was probable, smoke
began filtrating through the tops of the pines, behind the couple.
A fire had been started, though the hour of day was one when the
party naturally would have been in motion.</p>

<p>The question remained as to whether the horsemen intended to
stay where they were until the morrow or would soon resume their
journey. The last supposition seemed the most likely.</p>

<p>The decision of the Shawanoe was to lessen the distance between
him and the horsemen while such a fine opportunity offered. Flinging
the glass over his shoulder he set out to overtake the party in
advance, doing his best to decide upon the right policy, now that
the important information had come to him.</p>

<p>The most puzzling phase of the situation has been explained.
But for the certain recognition that Whirlwind would make of his
master, the latter would have gone direct to the Assiniboine camp
and watched for his opportunity; but as nearly as he could determine
there must be fully a score if not more of the warriors. To "cut
out" the stallion from among them when the sun was shining was
clearly an impossibility, though, as has been intimated, Deerfoot
was ready to make the attempt if no other chance offered.</p>

<p>Discretion warned him to keep out of sight of the party until
nightfall. He could then reconnoiter the camp with good prospect
of getting Whirlwind away. If the Assiniboines placed a sentinel
on duty, Deerfoot was confident he could get the better of him
in the darkness. The raiders would not be looking for any attack,
though when on the war trail they were sure to adopt the usual
precautions.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe, therefore, had not gone far when he decided upon
his plan of action. He would stay out of sight of men and animals
until the gloom gave him his opportunity. Meanwhile it was well
to decrease the intervening distance so far as was prudent.</p>

<p>It was yet early in the afternoon when the interval was cut in
half. While doing this he stopped and made frequent surveys of
the lake and wood. It would have made no great difference had
he been observed by the horsemen, for it was impossible for them
to suspect his identity or his business. Still, it was just as
well to have his presence in the neighborhood unknown and unsuspected.</p>

<p>All this time the vapor was climbing through the tree tops. Those
who had kindled the fire were still there, for they could not
leave by the "back door" without being seen by the vigilant Shawanoe.
He was surprised that none showed himself during these hours.
The couple who had first caught his eye had disappeared long before
in the wood and remained out of sight.</p>

<p>His interest led Deerfoot to continue edging forward until, by
the close of the afternoon, he was within a mile of the camp.
He had accomplished this by taking advantage of all the protection
possible. Since plenty offered, and the Assiniboines were not
apprehending anything of that nature, the task was not so hard
as it might seem.</p>

<p>The weather remained clear, though still keen and cold. The Shawanoe
had not eaten food for a long time, but he gave no thought to
that. He was ready to wait until the morrow before satisfying
his hunger. His one resolution was to regain Whirlwind, if such
a feat was within the range of human possibility.</p>

<p>The young Shawanoe did not forget that he was acting upon a theory
that might prove a rope of sand. The camp which he was reconnoitering
with such care might be that of another party, even though they
were Assiniboines. The probabilities, however, justified him in
believing he was on the right track.</p>

<p>A curious feature of the situation was that he had not as yet
seen a single horse. When a company of Indians stopped to rest,
even for a short time, they were accustomed to allow their animals
to graze. Between the margin of wood and the lake the dull green
of grass was plainly perceptible. Perhaps there was some open
spot among the trees which offered better pasturage for the horses.
Deerfoot could not feel clear in his own mind as to the explanation
of the absence of all sight of the animals.</p>

<p>He was speculating as to the cause of this singular fact when
six horses issued from among the timber and came frolicking and
cavorting down to the water's margin, where they thrust their
noses into the lake to drink. No Indians showed themselves, the
training of the animals making it unnecessary to guard them.</p>

<p>One of the steeds emerged from a point several yards to the right
of the others and kept apart from them, as if he felt too proud
to associate with those of common blood. When he lowered his head
he was fully a couple of rods from his companions. This horse
was the stallion Whirlwind.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "This Horse was Whirlwind."]</p>

<p>The sight of his peerless creature threw the Shawanoe into a
flutter, and it required all his self-control to restrain himself
from running forward and calling to Whirlwind to meet him, but
he resolutely held his ground, sheltered behind the projection
of the boulder he had used as a screen in keeping the camp under
surveillance. The situation was so critical that Deerfoot perhaps
was over-cautious.</p>

<p>He reasoned keenly. A mile separated steed and master. The latter
could have no thought that the youth from whom he had been separated
for weeks was near. If Deerfoot emitted his piercing whistle the
call would not be recognized on the instant, and the animal would
be confused. The dress of Deerfoot and his appearance were so
similar to those of other Indians that Whirlwind would not be
likely to identify him until they came considerably nearer each
other. The Assiniboines were in camp. They, too, would hear the
signal and be quick to discover what it meant. Rather than have
the black stallion escape from their possession they would shoot
him as he ran. A red man always prefers to slay a captive rather
than surrender him. With the horse shot Deerfoot would be forced
to have it out with the warriors at such disadvantage that only
one result could follow, for the Assiniboines were not only armed
with guns&mdash;at least several were thus equipped&mdash;but they were
daring and resolute.</p>

<p>It was these fears which caused the young Shawanoe to decide
to remain in hiding until nightfall, which was now at hand. It
is quite probable that the plan of calling Whirlwind to him would
have succeeded, as the youth afterward admitted; but it certainly
would have been attended with risk of failure, and he never regretted
the decision he made within the same minute that he caught sight
of his equine friend.</p>

<p>Like the king that he was, the stallion, having drank his fill,
wheeled and with dignified step passed back among the trees, keeping
apart from the others, who would have felt (as had Zigzag felt)
the impact of the fiercely driven heels had they ventured upon
any familiarity.</p>

<p>So it came about that Deerfoot the Shawanoe stayed in concealment
until the gathering gloom shut out the grove and its occupants.
There was no moon, but the star-gleam was strong and gave him
all the light he wished. He preferred that to stronger illumination.</p>

<p>During the slow passing minutes that the youth waited he reached
the conclusion that the Assiniboines in the timber were only a
part of the horsemen that had overthrown the Nez Perces. Some
cause had led them to divide, and a half dozen or so were waiting
for the others to rejoin them. Why this separation had taken place
Deerfoot could not understand, nor did he allow himself to be
interested in the question. The reason for his belief lay in the
number of horses that had issued from among the trees. In the
circumstances, all the animals would have gone for water at the
same time.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was cool, calm and perfectly poised when he stepped
from behind the boulder and began his stealthy approach to the
Assiniboine camp. He loosed his blanket from the fastening which
held the fold together in front and laid it over his right arm.
He confidently expected a fight and did not mean to have his limbs
hampered. Instinctively he slipped his hand down to his girdle.
The knife was there. He had examined his rifle long before. The
charge and priming were as they should be, and he grasped the
weapon with his left hand. He gave no thought to the fact that
more than twenty-four hours had passed since he had eaten food.
He was accustomed to such abstinence and the situation drove away
all appetite. He would not have taken a dozen paces to the right
or left to pick up nourishment.</p>

<p>A complication was threatened by the return of the other Assiniboines,
but aside from that Deerfoot did not mean to wait a half hour
longer than was necessary. His stealthy approach was continued
until in the gloom he made out the dim outlines of the timber.
The western terminus of the lake lay just to the left, so that
in order to reach the camp he had to diverge for some rods in
that direction. But the way was clear and the brief circuit brought
him to the edge of the wood, with the calm sheet of water stretching
for a half mile to the east, which was on his right hand.</p>

<p>The first step was to locate the Indians and their horses, for
the wise general acquaints himself with the battle ground upon
which the momentous issue is to be decided. The twinkle of light
that glimmered among the trees guided the Shawanoe, and with little
trouble he gained a position from which, unsuspected by the Assiniboines,
he had a perfect view of them.</p>
