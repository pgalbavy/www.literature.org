<p>Jo Stinger had decided to venture out from the block-house, at
a time when the Wyandots were on every side, and when many of
them were within the stockade and close to the building itself
It was a perilous act, but the veteran had what he deemed good
grounds for undertaking it.</p>

<p>In the first place, the darkness had deepened to that extent,
within the last few hours, that he believed he could move about
without being suspected: he was confident indeed that he could
stay out as long as he chose and return in safety.</p>

<p>He still felt chagrined over the audacity of the Wyandots, which
came so near success, and longed to turn the tables upon them.</p>

<p>But Jo Stinger had too much sense to leave the garrison and run
into great peril without the prospect of accomplishing some good
thereby. He knew the Wyandots were completing preparations to
burn the block-house. He believed it would be attempted before
morning, and, if not detected by him, would succeed. He had strong
hope that, by venturing outside, he could learn the nature of
the plan against which it would therefore be possible to make
some preparation.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston was not without misgiving when he drew the ponderous
bolts, but he gave no expression to his thoughts. All was blank
darkness, but, when the door was drawn inward, he felt several
cold specks on his hand, from which he knew it was snowing.</p>

<p>The flakes were very fine and few, but they were likely to increase
before morning, by which time the ground might be covered.</p>

<p>"When shall I look for your return?" asked the Colonel, but,
to his surprise, there was no answer. Jo had moved away, and was
gone without exchanging another word with the commandant.</p>

<p>The latter refastened the door at once. He could not but regard
the action of the most valuable man of his garrison as without
excuse: at the same time he reflected that his own title could
not have been more empty, for no one of the three men accepted
his orders when they conflicted with his personal views.</p>

<p>In the meantime Jo Stinger, finding himself on the outside of
the block-house, was in a situation where every sense needed to
be on the alert, and none knew it better than he.</p>

<p>The door which Colonel Preston opened was the front one, being
that which the scout passed through the previous night, and which
opened on the clearing along the river. He was afraid that, if
he emerged from the other entrance, he would step among the Wyandots
and be recognized before he could take his bearings.</p>

<p>But Jo felt that he had entered on an enterprise in which the
chances were against success, and in which he could accomplish
nothing except by the greatest risk to himself. The listening
Colonel fancied he heard the sound of his stealthy footstep, as
the hunter moved from the door of the block-house. He listened
a few minutes longer, but all was still except the soft sifting
of the snow against the door, like the finest particles of sand
and dust filtering through the tree-tops.</p>

<p>The Colonel passed to the narrow window at the side and looked
out. It had become like the blackness of darkness, and several
of the whirling snow-flakes struck his face.</p>

<p>"The Wyandots are concocting some mischief, and there's no telling
what shape it will take until it comes. I don't believe Jo will
do anything that will help us."</p>

<p>And with a sigh the speaker climbed the ladder again and told
his friends how rash the pioneer had been.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have allowed him to go," said Ned Preston.</p>

<p>"There's no stopping him when he has made up his mind to do anything."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you took him by de collar," asked Blossom Brown,
"and slam him down on de floor? Dat's what I'd done, and, if he'd
said anyting, den I'd took him by de heels and banged his head
agin de door till he'd be glad to sot down and behave himself."</p>

<p>"Jo is a skilled frontiersman," said the Colonel, who felt that
it was time he rallied to the defence of the scout; "he has tramped
hundreds of miles with Simon Kenton and Daniel Boone, and, if
his gun hadn't flashed fire one dark night last winter, he would
have ended the career of Simon Girty."</p>

<p>"How was that?"</p>

<p>"Simon Girty and Kenton served together as spies in Dunmore's
expedition in 1774, and up to that time Girty was a good soldier,
who risked much for his country. He was badly used by General
Lewis, and became the greatest scourge we have had on the frontier.
I don't suppose he ever has such an emotion as pity in his breast,
and there is no cruelty that he wouldn't be glad to inflict on
the whites. He and Jo know and hate each other worse than poison.
Last winter, Jo crept into one of the Shawanoe towns one dark
night, and when only a hundred feet away, aimed straight at Girty,
who sat on a log, smoking his pipe, and talking to several warriors.
Jo was so angered when his gun flashed in the pan, that he threw
it upon the ground and barely saved himself by dashing out of
the camp at the top of his speed. Jo has been in a great many
perilous situations," added Colonel Preston, "and he can tell
of many a thrilling encounter in the depths of the silent forest
and on the banks of the lonely streams, where no other human eyes
saw him and his foe."</p>

<p>"No doubt of all that," replied Ned, who knew that he was speaking
the sentiments of his uncle, "but it seems to me he is running
a great deal more risk than he ought to."</p>

<p>"I agree with you, but we have been greatly favored so far, and
we will continue to hope for the best."</p>

<p>The long spell of quiet which had followed the attempt to fire
the block-house, permitted the children to sleep, and their mother,
upon the urgency of her husband, had lain down beside them and
was sinking into a refreshing slumber.</p>

<p>Megill and Turner kept their places at the loopholes, watching
for the signs of danger with as vigilant interest as though it
was the first hour of the alarm. They were inclined to commend
the course of Jo Stinger, despite the great peril involved.</p>

<p>The Wyandots, beyond question, were perfecting some scheme of
attack, which most likely could be foiled only by previous knowledge
on the part of the garrison. The profound darkness and the skill
of the hunter would enable him to do all that could be done by
any one, under the circumstances.</p>

<p>There came seconds, and sometimes minutes, when no one spoke,
and the silence within the block-house was so profound that the
faint sifting of the snow on the roof was heard. Then an eddy
of wind would whirl some of the sand-like particles through the
loopholes into the eyes and faces of those who were peering out.
Men and boys gathered their blankets closer about their shoulders,
and set their muskets down beside them, where they could be caught
up the instant needed, while they carefully warmed their benumbed
fingers by rubbing and striking the palms together.</p>

<p>All senses were concentrated in the one of listening, for no
other faculty was of avail at such a time. Nerves were strung
to the highest point, because there was not one who did not feel
certain they were on the eve of events which were to decide the
fate of the little company huddled together in Fort Bridgman.</p>

<p>This stillness was at its profoundest depth, the soft rustling
of the snowflakes seemed to have ceased, and not a whisper was
on the lips of one of the garrison, when there suddenly rang out
on the night a shriek like that of some strong man caught in the
crush of death. It was so piercing that it seemed almost to sound
from the center of the room, and certainly must have been very
close to the block-house itself.</p>

<p>"That was the voice of Jo!" said Colonel Preston, in a terrified
undertone, after a minute's silence; "he has met his fate."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," Megill hastened to say; "I have been with
Jo too often, and I know his voice too well to be deceived."</p>

<p>"It sounded marvelously like his."</p>

<p>"It did not to me, though it may have been so to you."</p>

<p>"If it was not Jo, then it must have been one of the Wyandots."</p>

<p>"That follows, as a matter of course; in spite of all of Jo's
care, he has run against one of their men, or one of them has
run against him. The only way to settle it then was in the hurricane
order, and Jo has done it that promptly that the other has just
had time to work in a first-class yell like that."</p>

<p>"I'm greatly relieved to hear you take such a view," said Colonel
Preston, who, like the rest, was most agreeably disappointed to
hear Megill speak so confidently, his brother-in-law adding his
testimony to the same effect.</p>

<p>"Directly after that shriek," said Turner, "I'm sure there was
the tramping of feet, as if some one was running very fast: it
passed under the stockade and out toward the well."</p>

<p>"I heard the footsteps too," added Ned Preston.</p>

<p>"So did I," chimed in Blossom Brown, feeling it his duty to say
something to help the others along; "but I'm suah dat de footsteps
dat I heerd war on de roof. Some onrespectful Wyamdot hab crawled
up dar, and I bet am lookin' down de chimbley dis minute."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," observed Ned to his uncle, "that Jo will want
to come back pretty soon."</p>

<p>"I think so too," replied his uncle, "I will go down-stairs and
wait for him."</p>

<p>With these words he descended the rounds of the ladder and moved
softly across the lower floor to the door, where he paused, with
his hands on one of the heavy bars which held the structure in
place.</p>

<p>While crossing the room he looked toward the fire-place. Among
the ashes he caught the sullen red of a single point of fire,
like the glowering eye of some ogre, watching him in the darkness.</p>

<p>Beside the huge latch, there were three ponderous pieces of timber
which spanned the inner side of the door, the ends dropping into
massive sockets strong enough to hold the puncheon slabs against
prodigious pressure from the outside.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston carefully lifted the upper one out of place and
then did the same with the lowest. Then he placed his hand on
the middle bar and held his ear close to the jamb, so that he
might catch the first signal from the scout, whose return was
due every minute.</p>

<p>The listening ear caught the silken sifting of the particles
of snow, which insinuated themselves into and through the smallest
crevices, and a slight shiver passed through the frame of the
pioneer, who had thrown his blanket off his shoulders so that
he might have his arms free to use the instant it should become
necessary.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston had stood thus only a few minutes, when he fancied
he heard some one on the outside. The noise was very slight and
much as if a dog was scratching with his paw. Knowing that wood
is a better conductor of sound than air, he pressed his ear against
the door.</p>

<p>To his astonishment he then heard nothing except the snowflakes,
which sounded like the tapping of multitudinous fairies, as they
romped back and forth and up and down the door.</p>

<p>"That's strange," thought he, after listening a few minutes;
"there's something unusual out there, and I don't know whether
it is Jo or not. I'm afraid the poor fellow has been hurt and
is afraid to make himself known."</p>

<p>The words were yet in his mouth, when he caught a faint tapping
outside, as if made by the bill of a bird.</p>

<p>"That's Jo!" he exclaimed, immediately raising the end of the
middle bar from its socket; "he must be hurt, or he is afraid
to signal me, lest he be recognized."</p>

<p>At the moment the fastenings were removed, and Colonel Preston
was about drawing the door inward, he stayed his hand, prompted
so to do by the faintest suspicion that something was amiss.</p>

<p>"Jo! is that you?" he asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>"<em>Sh! Sh!</em>"</p>

<p>He caught the warning, almost inaudible as it was, and instantly
drew the door inward six or eight inches.</p>

<p>"Quick, Jo! the way is open!"</p>

<p>Even then a vague suspicion that all was not right led Colonel
Preston to step back a single step, and, though he had no weapons,
he clenched his fist and braced himself for an assault which he
did not expect.</p>

<p>The darkness was too complete for him to see anything, while
the faint ember, smouldering in the fire-place, threw no reflection
on the figure of the pioneer, so as to reveal his precise position.</p>

<p>It was a providential instinct that led Colonel Preston to take
this precaution, for as he recoiled some one struck a venomous
blow at him with a knife, under the supposition that he was standing
on the same spot where he stood at the moment the door was opened.
Had he been there, he would have been killed with the suddenness
almost of the lightning stroke.</p>

<p>The pioneer could not see, and he heard nothing except a sudden
expiration of the breath, which accompanied the fierce blow into
vacancy, but he knew like a flash that, instead of Jo, it was
a Wyandot Indian who was in the act of making a rush to open the
way for the other warriors behind him.</p>

<p>The right fist shot forward, with all the power Colonel Preston
could throw into it. He was an athlete and a good boxer. As he
struck, he hurled his body with the fist, so that all the momentum
possible went with it. Fortunately for the pioneer the blow landed
on the forehead of the unprepared warrior, throwing him violently
backward against his comrades, who were in the act of rushing
forward to follow in his wake.</p>

<p>But for them he would have been flung prostrate full a dozen
feet distant.</p>

<p>The instant the blow was delivered, Colonel Preston sprang back,
shoved the door to and caught up the middle bar. At such crises
it seems as if fate throws every obstruction in the way, and his
agony was indescribable, while desperately trying to get the bar
in place.</p>

<p>Only a few seconds were occupied in doing so, but those seconds
were frightful ones to him. He was sure the entire war party would
swarm into the block-house, before he could shut them out.</p>

<p>The Indians, who were forced backward by the impetus of the smitten
leader, understood the need of haste. They knew that, unless they
recovered their ground immediately, their golden opportunity was
gone.</p>

<p>Suppressing all outcry, for they had no wish to draw the fire
from the loopholes above, they precipitated themselves against
the door, as though each one was the carved head of a catapult,
equal to the task of bursting through any obstacle in its path.</p>

<p>Thank Heaven! In the very nick of time Colonel Preston got the
middle bar into its socket. This held the door so securely that
the other two were added without trouble, and he then breathed
freely.</p>

<p>Drops of cold perspiration stood on his forehead, and he felt
so faint that he groped about for a stool, on which he dropped
until he could recover.</p>
