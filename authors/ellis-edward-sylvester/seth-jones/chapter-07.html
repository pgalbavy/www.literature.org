<p>"By gracious! stars and garters! &amp;c.! &amp;c.! This is a
new way of introducing one’s self!" exclaimed Seth, as he sprawled
out among the savages around the council fire.</p>

<p>The consternation of the Indians at this sudden apparition among
them may well be imagined. The crackling of the undergrowth above,
had aroused them, yet the advent of Seth was so sudden and almost
instantaneous, that ere they could form a suspicion of the true
nature of things, he was among them. Their habitual quickness
of thought came to them at once. Graham was seen as he wheeled
and fled, and as has been shown, a number sprang at once in pursuit,
while a dozen leaped upon Seth, and as many tomahawks were raised.</p>

<p>"Now jest hold on," commanded Seth; "there ain’t any need of
being in a hurry. Plenty time to take my hair. Fact, by gracious."</p>

<p>His serio-comical manner arrested and amused his captors. They
all paused and looked at him, as if expecting another outburst,
while he contented himself with gazing at them with a look of
scornful contempt. Seeing this, one sprang forward, and clenching
his hair in a twist, hissed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! cuss Yankee! we burn him!"</p>

<p>"If you know what’s best, ole chap, you’ll take yer paw off my
head in a hurry. Ef you don’t you mought find it rather convenient
to."</p>

<p>The savage, as if to humor him, removed his hand, and Seth’s
rifle too. Seth gazed inquiringly at him a moment, and then with
an air of conscious superiority, said:</p>

<p>"I’ll lend that to you awhile, provided you return it all right.
Mind, you be keerful now, ’cause that ar gun cost something down
in New Hampshire."</p>

<p>From what has just been written, it will doubtless be suspected
that Seth’s conduct was a part which he was playing. When thrown
into peril by the impatience of his companion, he saw at once
that an attempt at flight was useless. Nothing was left but to
submit to his misfortune with the best grace possible; and yet
there was a <em>way</em> in which this submission could be effected
which would result better for himself than otherwise. Had he offered
resistance, or submitted despairingly, as many a man would have
done, he would doubtless have been tomahawked instantly. So, with
a readiness of thought, which was astonishing, he assumed an air
of reckless bravado. This, as we have shown, had the desired result
thus far. How it succeeded after, will be seen in the remaining
portion of this history.</p>

<p>Seth Jones was a man whose character could not be read in an
hour, or day. It required a long companionship with him to discover
the nicely shaded points, and the characteristics which seemed
in many cases so opposite. United with a genial, sportive humor
and apparent frankness, he was yet far-seeing and cautious, and
could read the motives of a man almost at a glance. With a countenance
which seemed made expressly to veil his soul, his very looks were
deceptive; and, when he chose to play a certain <em>role</em>,
he could do it to perfection. Had one seen him when the conversation
above recorded took place, he would have unhesitatingly set him
down as a natural-born idiot.</p>

<p>"How you like to burn, eh, Yankee?" asked a savage, stooping
and grinning horribly in his face.</p>

<p>"I don’t know; I never tried it," replied Seth with as much <em>nonchalance</em>
as though it was a dinner to which he was referring.</p>

<p>"E-e-e-e! you will try it, Yankee."</p>

<p>"Don’t know, yet; there are various opinions about that p’raps.
When the thing is did I mought believe it."</p>

<p>"You, <em>sizzle</em> nice&mdash;nice meat&mdash;good for burn!" added
another savage, grasping and feeling his arm.</p>

<p>"Just please to not pinch, my friend."</p>

<p>The savage closed his fingers like iron rods, and clenched the
member till Seth thought it would be crushed. But, though the
pain was excruciating, he manifested not the least feeling. The
Indian tried again and again, till he gave up and remarked, expressive
of his admiration of the man’s pluck.</p>

<p>"Good Yankee! stand pinch well."</p>

<p>"Oh! you wan’t pinching me, was you? Sorry I didn’t know it.
Try again, you mought p’raps do better."</p>

<p>The savage, however, retired, and another stepped forward and
grasped the captive’s hand.</p>

<p>"Soft, like squaw’s hand&mdash;let me feel it," he remarked, shutting
his own over it like a vice. Seth winced not in the least; but,
as the Indian in turn was about to relinquish his attempt at making
sport for his comrades, Seth said:</p>

<p>"Your paws don’t appear very horny," and closed over it with
a terrific grip. The savage stood it like a martyr, till Seth
felt the bones of his hand actually displacing, and yielding like
an apple. He determined, as he had in reality suffered himself,
to be revenged, and he closed his fingers tighter and more rigid
till the poor wretch sprang to his feet, and howled with pain!</p>

<p>"Oh! did I hurt you?" he asked with apparent solicitude, as the
savage’s hand slid from his own with much the appearance of a
wet glove. The discomfited Indian made no reply, but retired amid
the jeers of his comrades. Seth, without moving a muscle, seated
himself deliberately upon the ground, and coolly asked a savage
to lend him a pipe. It is known, that when an Indian sees such
hardihood and power, as their captor had just evinced, he does
not endeavor to conceal his admiration. Thus it was not strange,
that Seth’s impudent request was complied with. One handed him
a well-filled pipe, with a grin in which could be distinctly seen,
admiration, exaltation, and anticipated revenge. From the looks
of the others, it was plain they anticipated an immense deal of
sport. Our present hero continued smoking, lazily watching the
volumes of vapor, as they slowly rolled before and around him.
His captors sat around him a moment, conversing in their own tongue
(every word of which we may remark, was perfectly understood by
Seth), when one arose and stepped forward before him.</p>

<p>"White man strong&mdash;him pinch well&mdash;but me make him cry?"</p>

<p>So saying, he stooped, and removing the captive’s cap seized
a long tuft of yellow hair which had its root at the temple. A
stab in the eye would not have caused an acuter twinge of pain;
but, as he jerked it forth by the roots, Seth gave not the slightest
indication, save a stronger whiff at the pipe. The savages around
did not suppress a murmur of admiration. Seeing no effect from
this torture, the tormenter again stooped and caught another tuft
that grew low upon the neck. Each single hair felt like the point
of a needle thrust into the skin, and as it came forth, the Indians
seated around, noticed a livid paleness, like the track of a cloud,
quickly flash over their captive’s countenance. He looked up in
his tormentor’s eyes with an indescribable look. For a moment,
he fixed a gaze upon him, that savage as he was, caused a strange
shiver of dread to run through him.</p>

<p>To say that Seth cared nothing for these inflicted agonies would
be absurd. Had the savage dreamed what a whirlwind of hate and
revenge he had awakened by them, he would have never attempted
what he did. It was only by an almost unaccountable power that
Seth controlled the horrible pains of both body and mind, he suffered.
He felt as though it was impossible to prevent himself from writhing
on the ground in torment, and springing at his persecutor and
tearing him from limb to limb. But he had been schooled to Indian
indignities, and bore them unflinchingly.</p>

<p>His temple had the appearance of white parchment with innumerable
bloody points in it, as the blood commenced oozing from the wound,
and his neck seemed as though the skin had been scraped off! His
momentary paleness had been caused by the sickening pain and the
intensest passion. His look at the savage was <em>to remember
him</em>. After the events which have just transpired, they remained
seated a moment in silence. At last, one who appeared to be the
leader, addressed in an undertone, the Indian whom we have just
seen retire from the post of tormentor. Seth, however, caught
the words, and had he not, it is not probable he would have successfully
undergone the last trying ordeal.</p>

<p>The same savage again stepped forward in the circle before the
helpless captive, and removing the cap which had been replaced,
clinched the long yellow locks in his left hand, and threw the
head backward. Then whipping out his scalping knife, he flashed
it a second in the air, and circled its cold edge around his head
with the rapidity of lightning. The skin was not pierced, and
it was only an artifice. Seth never took his eyes from the Indian
during this awful minute.</p>

<p>The tormentor again retired. The savages were satisfied, but
Seth was not. He handed his pipe back, replaced his cap, and rising
to his feet, surveyed for a few seconds the group around. He then
addressed the leader.</p>

<p>"Can the white man now try the red man’s courage?"</p>

<p>The voice sounded like another person’s. Yet the chief noticed
it not, and nodded an assent to the request, while the looks of
the others showed the eagerness and interest they felt in these
dreadful proceedings.</p>

<p>The savage, who had inflicted all this agony, had seated himself
directly beside the chief. Seth stepped to him, and grasping his
arm, pressed it moderately. The Indian gave a scornful grunt.
Seth then stooped and gently took the tomahawk from his belt.
He raised it slowly on high, bent down till his form was like
the crouching panther ready to spring. The glittering blade was
seen to flash as it circled through the air, and the next instant
it crashed clean through the head of the unsuspecting savage!</p>
