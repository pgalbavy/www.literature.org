<p>And, if I felt in that manner as I entered the house, I felt it to a
still greater degree when I was welcomed by that most lovely old black
slave woman of the high temper and good cookery. She opened the door
for us herself, though a nice boy the color of a chocolate bonbon
stood in waiting to perform that office. She had a spoon in her hand
and upon her head was a spotless white turban, as also was an apron of
an equal spotlessness tied around her very large waist.
</p><p>"You, Mas' Robert, you done come home from the heathen land to keep my
food waiting jest like yo' father did from the minute I ontied him
from my apron string. Come right into the dining room 'fore my gravy
curdles and the liver wing I done saved for you gits too brown in the
skillet," was all of the introduction or greeting that she gave to me
as she waddled along behind Mr. Buzz Clendenning and myself, driving
us down the hall and into the dining-room. "Mas' Buzz, how is yo'
mother? I 'lowed to git over to see her soon as this ruckus of young
Mas' coming home is over. Now, here's the place fer you both and that
no 'count boy will bring in yo' dinner proper to you or he'll be skunt
alive." With which she departed through a door, from which came an
aroma that led to madness of hunger, and left the bonbon servant to
attend us.
</p><p>"Gee, I hope Kizzie killed by the half dozen last night; if there
aren't three chickens apiece you'll be hungry, L'Aiglon," said Mr.
Buzz Clendenning with a laugh as he seated himself beside me and
unfolded his napkin.
</p><p>"I wish that you might call me Robert, Mr. Clendenning," I said with a
great friendliness as I ate a food that I had not before tasted and
that I did so much like that I was tempted to steal some to put in my
pocket for fear I would come to believe that I had dreamed it to
exist. It is called corn pone and is made of maize, and it will be
found in some form at every meal upon my Uncle, the General Robert's,
table, good Kizzie assured me as I made her a compliment about it.
</p><p>"Though the name of that son of our great Napoleon is very dear to
me," I added at his quick glance, fearing he might think me offended
at what is called a nickname.
</p><p>"Sure, Bobbie, and you'll forget that I wouldn't let you kiss me,
won't you?" he answered as he drew back from the table and lit a
cigarette after passing me the case. "Everybody calls me Buzz the
Bumble Bee because of a historic encounter of mine with a whole nest
of bumblebees right out here in the General's garden. It is a title of
heroism and I'd like to have you use it as if we'd been kids together
as we were slated to have been. Gee, I bet you could have beat the
bees down some. You looked all soft to me when I first saw you but you
are so quick and lithe and springy that you must be some steel. What
do you weigh out, stripped?"
</p><p>"Er--er, about one-thirty," I answered, and I made a resolve not to
blush or show anything of embarrassment, no matter what was to be said
to me in my estate of a young gentleman.
</p><p>And I make this note to myself that it is a great pleasure and
interest to sit beside a nice young man with a cigarette in his mouth
and one in my hand as if for smoking, which I do not like to do from
its bitterness, and converse with him about matters of good sense
without having in any way to use that coquetry which breaks into small
sections the usual conversation between a man and a woman of
enthusiastic youngness.
</p><p>"I tip at one fifty-two, but I'm an inch and a half taller. Do you
run? You're good and deep chested," he further inquired and it was
with difficulty that I again controlled the blush.
</p><p>"I fence and I'm large of lung," I answered quickly.
</p><p>"Ride?"
</p><p>"Anything ever foaled," I answered in words I had heard my father use
about my horsemanship.
</p><p>"Don't smoke?"
</p><p>"Don't like it."
</p><p>"Golf?"
</p><p>"Some--wild."
</p><p>"I play a hurry game myself," he laughed. "Dance?"
</p><p>"With a greatness of pleasure," I answered.
</p><p>After that for a time he puffed at his cigarette and I looked around
the long dining room that was almost as large as the dining-hall at
the Chateau de Grez and which was dark and rich and full of old silver
on the sideboard and old portraits on the walls. Finally my Buzz put
out the stub of his cigarette in his saucer and looked me keenly in
the face as I raised my eyes to his.
</p><p>"Booze?" he asked quietly.
</p><p>"No!"
</p><p>"That's good, old top. Me neither! Say, let's go call on Sue and you
can get a nice little initiation into the girl bunch before the
General stops you by locking you away from them."
</p><p>"I wish that I might, but I must unpack my bags and write the letters
to small Pierre and my nurse Nannette; also be ready for translations
for my Uncle, the General Robert, when he arrives. Will you persuade
the lovely Mademoiselle Sue that she save one little dance for me on
that evening of Tuesday?" I said as we rose and walked down the long
hall towards the wide door under the budding rose vine.
</p><p>"She'll dead sure give you one--of mine," he answered me with a laugh,
"but come along with me now, L'Aiglon. The General won't be home until
night. I laid some letters on his desk that will hold him and Governor
Bill until sunset. They'll have pie and milk sent in and work it all
out together. What's the use of having them to watch the affairs of
the State of Harpeth for us if we don't use the time they are on watch
in having some joy life? Come on!"
</p><p>"I go," I made answer with a great pleasure.
</p><p>Then we descended to the gray car of much speed and did use that speed
in turning many streets until we came to another very fine old house,
where, I was informed by my Mr. Buzz Clendenning, resides that
Mademoiselle Susan of so much loveliness.
</p><p>And it is of a truth that I discovered that loveliness to be as great
as was told to me by her true lover. When I raised my head from the
kiss of presentation I gave to her hand I looked into very deep and
very wonderful girl eyes that had in their depths tears that were for
a sympathy for me, I knew. My heart of an exile beat very high in my
own girl's breast that ached for the refuge of her woman's arms, and I
must have partly betrayed my yearning to her, for I saw an expression
of confused question come into her eyes that looked into mine; then
the beautiful thing that had come into my Mr. Buzz Clendenning's eyes
for me came also into hers in place of the question. I saw then in
those eyes a sister born to the boy Robert Carruthers of a great
French strangeness.
</p><p>"I've been thinking about you all morning, Mr. Carruthers, and hoping
Buzz would bring you with him to see me first of all. I wanted to be
the first one of the girls to say, 'Welcome home' to you." And as she
spoke those words of much tenderness I again bent over her hand in
salutation because I could give forth no words from my throat.
</p><p>"Sue, you are the real sweet thing--and now notice me a bit, will
you?" said my fine Mr. Buzz Clendenning with both emotion and a
teasing in his voice. "I know I haven't got French manners and don't
look like L'Aiglon, but I'm an affectionate rough jewel."
</p><p>"Please don't mind Buzz, Mr. Carruthers--he just can't help buzzing.
Isn't it great about the dance Tuesday night? I fought hard to save
you from a horrid long banquet with a lot of solemn men. I ought to be
the belle of that ball and you and Buzz will be ungrateful if you
neglect me," and as she made these remarks for laughter, I liked still
more this new friend.
</p><p>"You are the good, thoughtful little missionary to the foreigner,
Susan. I suppose you wanted to stay at home and tat socks while Bobbie
and I dined and wined--not," was the very unappreciative answer that
was made to her by that Buzz.
</p><p>"For always I will be your humble slave, Mademoiselle Susan," was the
answer I made into her laughing eyes. "All the evening I will wait in
loneliness for the small crumbs of dance that you throw to me."
</p><p>"That will do, Robert; you don't know how spoiled Susan is and you're
making trouble for me. Besides, you haven't seen the baby Belle in war
paint yet. Let's go call on her now!" And that Mr. Buzz Clendenning
was in a moment ready for making more new friends for me. "Come on,
Susan, we can tie Prince Bob on the running board."
</p><p>"Why, there's Belle at the gate now and--yes--it's Mrs. Whitworth with
her. I wonder when she came from New York," said Mademoiselle Susan as
we went to meet the guests approaching, I on the one side of her and
the Mr. Buzz on the other.
