<p>It need not be said that George Starr wasted no time. Halting
only long enough to say a few words to Tim Brophy before he set
out to warn the son of his danger, he resumed his journey toward
Fort Meade, some thirty miles away, at the base of the Black Hills.</p>

<p>He drew up beside the pony on which his wife sat with Dot in
front. The pack-horse did not require leading, but as his load
was lighter than either of the others, he kept his head at the
haunch of the others, and plodded along as contentedly as they.</p>

<p>Though the route to the post by means of the regular trail was
longer, it was always used when safe, because it was easy travelling
throughout its whole extent. The country before the husband and
wife was varied. There were miles of open plain, over which they
could ride at a gallop, while in other places, the rocky ridges,
broken timber, and gullies compelled detours that were likely
to render a two days' journey necessary.</p>

<p>In addition to all this several streams must be crossed, and
these were held in great dread, for if swimming became necessary,
the plight of the little company, with the thermometer striking
steadily below freezing point, would be pitiful indeed. The ranchman
was resolved to save his wife and child from such an affliction,
by constructing some kind of a raft, though the delay involved
in such a work might solve the question of life and death.</p>

<p>"I have never been over this route&mdash;that is, to any extent,"
he remarked, after they had ridden a short time on a brisk walk;
"I have followed the cattle for some miles among the hills yonder,
but, as you know, we always used the regular trail when going
to the fort."</p>

<p>"This is shorter," replied the wife, "because it is the most
direct, and though there may be difficulties in the way, I am
hopeful that we shall have no serious trouble."</p>

<p>"I hope so, too, but if I am not mistaken, we must cross more
than one stream, and if they happen to be deep, it will be no
trifling matter. How do you feel, Dot?" he asked, looking fondly
at the little one, whose head was about the only portion visible
beneath the folds of the blanket wrapped about her.</p>

<p>"I'm all right," replied the sweet voice, while the bright eyes
twinkled happily, as though no thought of danger or sorrow had
ever dimmed them.</p>

<p>"How long do you think you can ride on the back of Sally?"</p>

<p>"Just as long as she can carry me."</p>

<p>"That's good," laughed the parent, who could not help reaching
across from the saddle and pinching the chubby cheek; "I want
to give you a good long ride, and we may keep it up after dark."</p>

<p>"That don't make any difference to me, for I can sleep here as
well as in my bed at home. Mamma will take care of me, won't you?"
she asked, twisting her head about and looking up in the face
of her parent.</p>

<p>The latter leaned down and kissed her, murmuring:</p>

<p>"Yes, with my life, precious one; but we are in the keeping of
God, and he is always merciful and kind."</p>

<p>"I know that," said the child thoughtfully, "for hasn't He given
me the best parents in the world? Oh, look! papa and mamma!" she
added, forcing her head farther out of its environments, and pointing
to the top of the elevation they were approaching.</p>

<p>The sight was a pretty one indeed. A noble buck had arrived first,
from the other side of the ridge, and paused on the highest point.
With his head erect, he looked down in wonderment at the party
approaching him. He made a fine picture, with his antlers high
in air and his whole form thrown in relief against the leaden
sky beyond.</p>

<p>"What a fine mark," said the rancher admiringly; "I never saw
a larger buck."</p>

<p>"You don't intend to shoot him?"</p>

<p>"No; we have all the food we are likely to want, and the sound
of the gun might be dangerous to us, when there's no saying that
other of the Sioux are not in the neighborhood."</p>

<p>"Isn't that too bad!"</p>

<p>The regretful exclamation of Dot was caused by the disappearance
of the animal. The steady advance of the party was more than the
timid creature could face. He whirled about and was off like a
flash, to the keen regret of Dot, who was hoping for a closer
acquaintance. The parents smiled at the innocence of the little
one, and assured her it would have to be caught and tamed before
allowing any companionship from anyone.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the friends rode to the top of the elevation,
halting at the very spot where the buck had stood but a few minutes
before.</p>

<p>"Just what I feared!" exclaimed the rancher regretfully.</p>

<p>As he spoke he pointed to the westward, where the gleam of water
was seen, revealing a winding stream, which it was necessary to
cross before continuing their journey.</p>

<p>"It is not broad and may not be deep," remarked the wife.</p>

<p>"That can be ascertained only by investigation."</p>

<p>He halted long enough to take a sweeping survey of the country
behind them. There might have been Indians watching, but, if so,
he detected no signs of them. The little party were conspicuous
objects, but it was an easy matter for anyone to keep out of sight
of the keenest vision on the crest of the elevation.</p>

<p>The stream that had caught his eye was about half a mile away,
the intervening ground being a comparatively level and grassy
plain, but beyond the water stretched a hilly and wooded section,
which was likely to offer serious obstacles to their progress.</p>

<p>"We shall have snow before night," remarked Mr. Starr, glancing
up and around at the sky, "and if it amounts to much it will make
more trouble."</p>

<p>"Let us ride faster, then, while we may," said his wife, urging
her pony into a gallop, which was instantly imitated by the other,
though the gait was so distasteful to the pack-horse that he held
back until sharply spoken to by his master. Finally all three
struck a pace which speedily carried them to the stream that crossed
their path.</p>

<p>It seemed odd that while there was plenty of timber on the other
side, even to the water's edge, not a stick was on the bank where
the fugitives halted. If it should be found necessary to make
a raft with which to cross, Mr. Starr might well ask himself where
the material was to be procured, since he saw none within reach.</p>

<p>The stream was less than a hundred yards wide and the current
not swift. The water was roiled to that extent that the bottom
could be seen only a few paces from shore, but the slope was so
gradual that the rancher was hopeful that the horse would be able
to wade it.</p>

<p>He scanned the water and finally turned to his wife with a smile:</p>

<p>"Where do you think we had better try it, Molly?"</p>

<p>"I know of no way of learning the depth of water except by test,"
she replied; "if it were clearer, we could make use of our eyes."</p>

<p>"I wonder if it is clearer up yonder," he remarked, looking at
a clump of bushes above them and some rods in extent. "It strikes
me that it may be; anyway, I will find out."</p>

<p>Instead of riding to the spot he dismounted, and, rifle in hand,
walked the short distance necessary. As he did so, naturally he
gave more heed to the stream than to his footsteps, for it was
the former in which his interest lay. Dot laughed merrily when
he stumbled, and he looked about and shook his head in mock anger
at her.</p>

<p>The bushes he approached were no more than three or four feet
in height, not very dense, and continued with straggling interruptions
as far as the eye could trace the winding stream.</p>

<p>Mrs. Starr, who was attentively watching her husband, saw him
pause on reaching the stunted growth. He looked at the water and
then at the bushes. Then he suddenly leaped back with an exclamation
and came hastening to his wife, his white face and staring eyes
showing that he had made a horrifying discovery.</p>
