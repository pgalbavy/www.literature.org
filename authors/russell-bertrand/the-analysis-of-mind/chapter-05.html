<p>The traditional conception of cause and effect is one which modern
science shows to be fundamentally erroneous, and requiring to
be replaced by a quite different notion, that of <em>LAWS OF CHANGE.
</em>In the traditional conception, a particular event A caused
a particular event B, and by this it was implied that, given any
event B, some earlier event A could be discovered which had a
relation to it, such that&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Whenever A occurred, it was followed by B;</p>

<p>(2) In this sequence, there was something "necessary," not a
mere de facto occurrence of A first and then B.</p>

<p>The second point is illustrated by the old discussion as to whether
it can be said that day causes night, on the ground that day is
always followed by night. The orthodox answer was that day could
not be called the cause of night, because it would not be followed
by night if the earth's rotation were to cease, or rather to grow
so slow that one complete rotation would take a year. A cause,
it was held, must be such that under no conceivable circumstances
could it fail to be followed by its effect.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, such sequences as were sought by believers
in the traditional form of causation have not so far been found
in nature. Everything in nature is apparently in a state of continuous
change,* so that what we call one "event" turns out to be really
a process. If this event is to cause another event, the two will
have to be contiguous in time; for if there is any interval between
them, something may happen during that interval to prevent the
expected effect. Cause and effect, therefore, will have to be
temporally contiguous processes. It is difficult to believe, at
any rate where physical laws are concerned, that the earlier part
of the process which is the cause can make any difference to the
effect, so long as the later part of the process which is the
cause remains unchanged. Suppose, for example, that a man dies
of arsenic poisoning, we say that his taking arsenic was the cause
of death. But clearly the process by which he acquired the arsenic
is irrelevant: everything that happened before he swallowed it
may be ignored, since it cannot alter the effect except in so
far as it alters his condition at the moment of taking the dose.
But we may go further: swallowing arsenic is not really the proximate
cause of death, since a man might be shot through the head immediately
after taking the dose, and then it would not be of arsenic that
he would die. The arsenic produces certain physiological changes,
which take a finite time before they end in death. The earlier
parts of these changes can be ruled out in the same way as we
can rule out the process by which the arsenic was acquired. Proceeding
in this way, we can shorten the process which we are calling the
cause more and more. Similarly we shall have to shorten the effect.
It may happen that immediately after the man's death his body
is blown to pieces by a bomb. We cannot say what will happen after
the man's death, through merely knowing that he has died as the
result of arsenic poisoning. Thus, if we are to take the cause
as one event and the effect as another, both must be shortened
indefinitely. The result is that we merely have, as the embodiment
of our causal law, a certain direction of change at each moment.
Hence we are brought to differential equations as embodying causal
laws. A physical law does not say "A will be followed by B," but
tells us what acceleration a particle will have under given circumstances,
i.e. it tells us how the particle's motion is changing at each
moment, not where the particle will be at some future moment.</p>

* The theory of quanta suggests that the continuity is only<br/>
apparent. If so, we shall be able theoretically to reach<br/>
events which are not processes. But in what is directly<br/>
observable there is still apparent continuity, which<br/>
justifies the above remarks for the prevent.

</p>
</div>
<p>Laws embodied in differential equations may possibly be exact,
but cannot be known to be so. All that we can know empirically
is approximate and liable to exceptions; the exact laws that are
assumed in physics are known to be somewhere near the truth, but
are not known to be true just as they stand. The laws that we
actually know empirically have the form of the traditional causal
laws, except that they are not to be regarded as universal or
necessary. "Taking arsenic is followed by death" is a good empirical
generalization; it may have exceptions, but they will be rare.
As against the professedly exact laws of physics, such empirical
generalizations have the advantage that they deal with observable
phenomena. We cannot observe infinitesimals, whether in time or
space; we do not even know whether time and space are infinitely
divisible. Therefore rough empirical generalizations have a definite
place in science, in spite of not being exact of universal. They
are the data for more exact laws, and the grounds for believing
that they are <em>USUALLY </em>true are stronger than the grounds
for believing that the more exact laws are <em>ALWAYS </em>true.</p>

<p>Science starts, therefore, from generalizations of the form,
"A is usually followed by B." This is the nearest approach that
can be made to a causal law of the traditional sort. It may happen
in any particular instance that A is <em>ALWAYS </em>followed
by B, but we cannot know this, since we cannot foresee all the
perfectly possible circumstances that might make the sequence
fail, or know that none of them will actually occur. If, however,
we know of a very large number of cases in which A is followed
by B, and few or none in which the sequence fails, we shall in
<em>PRACTICE </em>be justified in saying "A causes B," provided
we do not attach to the notion of cause any of the metaphysical
superstitions that have gathered about the word.</p>

<p>There is another point, besides lack of universality and necessity,
which it is important to realize as regards causes in the above
sense, and that is the lack of uniqueness. It is generally assumed
that, given any event, there is some one phenomenon which is <em>THE
</em>cause of the event in question. This seems to be a mere mistake.
Cause, in the only sense in which it can be practically applied,
means "nearly invariable antecedent." We cannot in practice obtain
an antecedent which is <em>QUITE </em>invariable, for this would
require us to take account of the whole universe, since something
not taken account of may prevent the expected effect. We cannot
distinguish, among nearly invariable antecedents, one as <em>THE
</em>cause, and the others as merely its concomitants: the attempt
to do this depends upon a notion of cause which is derived from
will, and will (as we shall see later) is not at all the sort
of thing that it is generally supposed to be, nor is there any
reason to think that in the physical world there is anything even
remotely analogous to what will is supposed to be. If we could
find one antecedent, and only one, that was <em>QUITE </em>invariable,
we could call that one <em>THE </em>cause without introducing
any notion derived from mistaken ideas about will. But in fact
we cannot find any antecedent that we know to be quite invariable,
and we can find many that are nearly so. For example, men leave
a factory for dinner when the hooter sounds at twelve o'clock.
You may say the hooter is <em>THE </em>cause of their leaving.
But innumerable other hooters in other factories, which also always
sound at twelve o'clock, have just as good a right to be called
the cause. Thus every event has many nearly invariable antecedents,
and therefore many antecedents which may be called its cause.</p>

<p>The laws of traditional physics, in the form in which they deal
with movements of matter or electricity, have an apparent simplicity
which somewhat conceals the empirical character of what they assert.
A piece of matter, as it is known empirically, is not a single
existing thing, but a system of existing things. When several
people simultaneously see the same table, they all see something
different; therefore "the" table, which they are supposed all
to see, must be either a hypothesis or a construction. "The" table
is to be neutral as between different observers: it does not favour
the aspect seen by one man at the expense of that seen by another.
It was natural, though to my mind mistaken, to regard the "real"
table as the common cause of all the appearances which the table
presents (as we say) to different observers. But why should we
suppose that there is some one common cause of all these appearances?
As we have just seen, the notion of "cause" is not so reliable
as to allow us to infer the existence of something that, by its
very nature, can never be observed.</p>

<p>Instead of looking for an impartial source, we can secure neutrality
by the equal representation of all parties. Instead of supposing
that there is some unknown cause, the "real" table, behind the
different sensations of those who are said to be looking at the
table, we may take the whole set of these sensations (together
possibly with certain other particulars) as actually <em>BEING
</em>the table. That is to say, the table which is neutral as
between different observers (actual and possible) is the set of
all those particulars which would naturally be called "aspects"
of the table from different points of view. (This is a first approximation,
modified later.)</p>

<p>It may be said: If there is no single existent which is the source
of all these "aspects," how are they collected together? The answer
is simple: Just as they would be if there were such a single existent.
The supposed "real" table underlying its appearances is, in any
case, not itself perceived, but inferred, and the question whether
such-and-such a particular is an "aspect" of this table is only
to be settled by the connection of the particular in question
with the one or more particulars by which the table is defined.
That is to say, even if we assume a "real" table, the particulars
which are its aspects have to be collected together by their relations
to each other, not to it, since it is merely inferred from them.
We have only, therefore, to notice how they are collected together,
and we can then keep the collection without assuming any "real"
table as distinct from the collection. When different people see
what they call the same table, they see things which are not exactly
the same, owing to difference of point of view, but which are
sufficiently alike to be described in the same words, so long
as no great accuracy or minuteness is sought. These closely similar
particulars are collected together by their similarity primarily
and, more correctly, by the fact that they are related to each
other approximately according to the laws of perspective and of
reflection and diffraction of light. I suggest, as a first approximation,
that these particulars, together with such correlated others as
are unperceived, jointly <em>ARE </em>the table; and that a similar
definition applies to all physical objects.*</p>

</div>
<p>In order to eliminate the reference to our perceptions, which
introduces an irrelevant psychological suggestion, I will take
a different illustration, namely, stellar photography. A photographic
plate exposed on a clear night reproduces the appearance of the
portion of the sky concerned, with more or fewer stars according
to the power of the telescope that is being used. Each separate
star which is photographed produces its separate effect on the
plate, just as it would upon ourselves if we were looking at the
sky. If we assume, as science normally does, the continuity of
physical processes, we are forced to conclude that, at the place
where the plate is, and at all places between it and a star which
it photographs, <em>SOMETHING </em>is happening which is specially
connected with that star. In the days when the aether was less
in doubt, we should have said that what was happening was a certain
kind of transverse vibration in the aether. But it is not necessary
or desirable to be so explicit: all that we need say is that <em>SOMETHING
</em>happens which is specially connected with the star in question.
It must be something specially connected with that star, since
that star produces its own special effect upon the plate. Whatever
it is must be the end of a process which starts from the star
and radiates outwards, partly on general grounds of continuity,
partly to account for the fact that light is transmitted with
a certain definite velocity. We thus arrive at the conclusion
that, if a certain star is visible at a certain place, or could
be photographed by a sufficiently sensitive plate at that place,
something is happening there which is specially connected with
that star. Therefore in every place at all times a vast multitude
of things must be happening, namely, at least one for every physical
object which can be seen or photographed from that place. We can
classify such happenings on either of two principles:</p>

<p>(1) We can collect together all the happenings in one place,
as is done by photography so far as light is concerned;</p>

<p>(2) We can collect together all the happenings, in different
places, which are connected in the way that common sense regards
as being due to their emanating from one object.</p>

<p>Thus, to return to the stars, we can collect together either&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) All the appearances of different stars in a given place,
or,</p>

<p>(2) All the appearances of a given star in different places.</p>

<p>But when I speak of "appearances," I do so only for brevity:
I do not mean anything that must "appear" to somebody, but only
that happening, whatever it may be, which is connected, at the
place in question, with a given physical object&mdash;according to
the old orthodox theory, it would be a transverse vibration in
the aether. Like the different appearances of the table to a number
of simultaneous observers, the different particulars that belong
to one physical object are to be collected together by continuity
and inherent laws of correlation, not by their supposed causal
connection with an unknown assumed existent called a piece of
matter, which would be a mere unnecessary metaphysical thing in
itself. A piece of matter, according to the definition that I
propose, is, as a first approximation,* the collection of all
those correlated particulars which would normally be regarded
as its appearances or effects in different places. Some further
elaborations are desirable, but we can ignore them for the present.
I shall return to them at the end of this lecture.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
*The exact definition of a piece of matter as a construction<br/>
will be given later.

</p>
</div>
<p>According to the view that I am suggesting, a physical object
or piece of matter is the collection of all those correlated particulars
which would be regarded by common sense as its effects or appearances
in different places. On the other hand, all the happenings in
a given place represent what common sense would regard as the
appearances of a number of different objects as viewed from that
place. All the happenings in one place may be regarded as the
view of the world from that place. I shall call the view of the
world from a given place a "perspective." A photograph represents
a perspective. On the other hand, if photographs of the stars
were taken in all points throughout space, and in all such photographs
a certain star, say Sirius, were picked out whenever it appeared,
all the different appearances of Sirius, taken together, would
represent Sirius. For the understanding of the difference between
psychology and physics it is vital to understand these two ways
of classifying particulars, namely:</p>

<p>(1) According to the place where they occur;</p>

<p>(2) According to the system of correlated particulars in different
places to which they belong, such system being defined as a physical
object.</p>

<p>Given a system of particulars which is a physical object, I shall
define that one of the system which is in a given place (if any)
as the "appearance of that object in that place."</p>

<p>When the appearance of an object in a given place changes, it
is found that one or other of two things occurs. The two possibilities
may be illustrated by an example. You are in a room with a man,
whom you see: you may cease to see him either by shutting your
eyes or by his going out of the room. In the first case, his appearance
to other people remains unchanged; in the second, his appearance
changes from all places. In the first case, you say that it is
not he who has changed, but your eyes; in the second, you say
that he has changed. Generalizing, we distinguish&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Cases in which only certain appearances of the object change,
while others, and especially appearances from places very near
to the object, do not change;</p>

<p>(2) Cases where all, or almost all, the appearances of the object
undergo a connected change.</p>

<p>In the first case, the change is attributed to the medium between
the object and the place; in the second, it is attributed to the
object itself.*</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
* The application of this distinction to motion raises<br/>
complications due to relativity, but we may ignore these for<br/>
our present purposes.

</p>
</div>
<p>It is the frequency of the latter kind of change, and the comparatively
simple nature of the laws governing the simultaneous alterations
of appearances in such cases, that have made it possible to treat
a physical object as one thing, and to overlook the fact that
it is a system of particulars. When a number of people at a theatre
watch an actor, the changes in their several perspectives are
so similar and so closely correlated that all are popularly regarded
as identical with each other and with the changes of the actor
himself. So long as all the changes in the appearances of a body
are thus correlated there is no pressing prima facie need to break
up the system of appearances, or to realize that the body in question
is not really one thing but a set of correlated particulars. It
is especially and primarily such changes that physics deals with,
i.e. it deals primarily with processes in which the unity of a
physical object need not be broken up because all its appearances
change simultaneously according to the same law&mdash;or, if not all,
at any rate all from places sufficiently near to the object, with
in creasing accuracy as we approach the object.</p>

<p>The changes in appearances of an object which are due to changes
in the intervening medium will not affect, or will affect only
very slightly, the appearances from places close to the object.
If the appearances from sufficiently neighbouring places are either
wholly un changed, or changed to a diminishing extent which has
zero for its limit, it is usually found that the changes can be
accounted for by changes in objects which are between the object
in question and the places from which its appearance has changed
appreciably. Thus physics is able to reduce the laws of most changes
with which it deals to changes in physical objects, and to state
most of its fundamental laws in terms of matter. It is only in
those cases in which the unity of the system of appearances constituting
a piece of matter has to be broken up, that the statement of what
is happening cannot be made exclusively in terms of matter. The
whole of psychology, we shall find, is included among such cases;
hence their importance for our purposes.</p>

<p>We can now begin to understand one of the fundamental differences
between physics and psychology. Physics treats as a unit the whole
system of appearances of a piece of matter, whereas psychology
is interested in certain of these appearances themselves. Confining
ourselves for the moment to the psychology of perceptions, we
observe that perceptions are certain of the appearances of physical
objects. From the point of view that we have been hitherto adopting,
we might define them as the appearances of objects at places from
which sense-organs and the suitable parts of the nervous system
form part of the intervening medium. Just as a photographic plate
receives a different impression of a cluster of stars when a telescope
is part of the intervening medium, so a brain receives a different
impression when an eye and an optic nerve are part of the intervening
medium. An impression due to this sort of intervening medium is
called a perception, and is interesting to psychology on its own
account, not merely as one of the set of correlated particulars
which is the physical object of which (as we say) we are having
a perception.</p>

<p>We spoke earlier of two ways of classifying particulars. One
way collects together the appearances commonly regarded as a given
object from different places; this is, broadly speaking, the way
of physics, leading to the construction of physical objects as
sets of such appearances. The other way collects together the
appearances of different objects from a given place, the result
being what we call a perspective. In the particular case where
the place concerned is a human brain, the perspective belonging
to the place consists of all the perceptions of a certain man
at a given time. Thus classification by perspectives is relevant
to psychology, and is essential in defining what we mean by one
mind.</p>

<p>I do not wish to suggest that the way in which I have been defining
perceptions is the only possible way, or even the best way. It
is the way that arose naturally out of our present topic. But
when we approach psychology from a more introspective standpoint,
we have to distinguish sensations and perceptions, if possible,
from other mental occurrences, if any. We have also to consider
the psychological effects of sensations, as opposed to their physical
causes and correlates. These problems are quite distinct from
those with which we have been concerned in the present lecture,
and I shall not deal with them until a later stage.</p>

<p>It is clear that psychology is concerned essentially with actual
particulars, not merely with systems of particulars. In this it
differs from physics, which, broadly speaking, is concerned with
the cases in which all the particulars which make up one physical
object can be treated as a single causal unit, or rather the particulars
which are sufficiently near to the object of which they are appearances
can be so treated. The laws which physics seeks can, broadly speaking,
be stated by treating such systems of particulars as causal units.
The laws which psychology seeks cannot be so stated, since the
particulars themselves are what interests the psychologist. This
is one of the fundamental differences between physics and psychology;
and to make it clear has been the main purpose of this lecture.</p>

<p>I will conclude with an attempt to give a more precise definition
of a piece of matter. The appearances of a piece of matter from
different places change partly according to intrinsic laws (the
laws of perspective, in the case of visual shape), partly according
to the nature of the intervening medium&mdash;fog, blue spectacles,
telescopes, microscopes, sense-organs, etc. As we approach nearer
to the object, the effect of the intervening medium grows less.
In a generalized sense, all the intrinsic laws of change of appearance
may be called "laws of perspective." Given any appearance of an
object, we can construct hypothetically a certain system of appearances
to which the appearance in question would belong if the laws of
perspective alone were concerned. If we construct this hypothetical
system for each appearance of the object in turn, the system corresponding
to a given appearance x will be independent of any distortion
due to the medium beyond x, and will only embody such distortion
as is due to the medium between x and the object. Thus, as the
appearance by which our hypothetical system is defined is moved
nearer and nearer to the object, the hypothetical system of appearances
defined by its means embodies less and less of the effect of the
medium. The different sets of appearances resulting from moving
x nearer and nearer to the object will approach to a limiting
set, and this limiting set will be that system of appearances
which the object would present if the laws of perspective alone
were operative and the medium exercised no distorting effect.
This limiting set of appearances may be defined, for purposes
of physics, as the piece of matter concerned.</p>
