<p>When Elwood Brandon separated from Howard Lawrence on the afternoon
of their ramble in the woods, it was with the firm intention of
making all haste around the range of hills, and there to unite
with him in their hunt for Tim.</p>

<p>But, like too many boys, he suffered himself to be led from the
sure path by the allurements of the false one. His example furnished
a striking moral lesson, which he will doubtless remember to the
day of his death.</p>

<p>When we are following the course which conscience tells us is
the true one, although it may be rough and stony, and at times
most difficult to keep, yet the knowledge of what awaits us at
the end should be proof against temptations to turn aside. Woe
to him who chides the voice of conscience and listens to that
of the charmer!</p>

<p>Elwood had gone some distance, and was walking very rapidly,
when he came abruptly upon the opening in the rocks which has
been mentioned in another place.</p>

<p>"Ah! here is a shorter cut across," was his reflection as he
saw it, and not stopping to think further, he turned and walked
rapidly through it. "I will beat Howard," and he smiled at the
thought. "What will he think when he gets around to see me waiting
for him? I know he will run so as to be there first."</p>

<p>Thus hopeful, Elwood hurried forward, thinking only of the surprise
he would give his cousin when they met again. As he found the
path taking a most sinuous course, a dim idea came through his
head that perhaps after all he had not gained so much by "cutting
across." He would have turned back as it was but for the rapidly
increasing darkness and the belief that he must speedily emerge
from the eastern side of the hills.</p>

<p>While walking through a narrow part of the path, he was alarmed
by the rattling of some dirt, stones and debris over his head,
and before he could retreat or advance he was stricken on the
head by several pieces with such violence that he staggered and
fell to the ground.</p>

<p>He was not senseless, but somewhat stunned, and placed his hand
on his head to see whether it was cut. Finding no blood, he arose
to his feet and replied to the whistle of Howard, which had been
ringing in his ears for the last ten minutes.</p>

<p>Immediately after, he was taken with a sickness at the stomach,
the result, doubtless, of the mental shock received. Such was
his faintness and nausea that he lay down upon the ground for
relief. When a boy feels so sick&mdash;as shown also by older persons
in seasickness&mdash;he generally becomes perfectly indifferent to
everything else in the world. Elwood concluded that Howard might
whistle as long as he chose, and he would reply when he felt able.
As for the gathering darkness, wild animals and savages, what
did he care for them? They could exist and get along without his
taking any trouble to think about them.</p>

<p>And so he lay still until his sickness diminished and was gradually
succeeded by drowsiness, which was not long in merging into slumber.</p>

<p>Whoever yet remembered the moment he went to sleep? Whoever lay
still to gain a few moments of slumber without obtaining far more
than he expected, and regretting it when his intellect became
sharp and clear?</p>

<p>It was near midnight when Elwood awoke, and all was blank darkness.
He called to Howard and Tim, and not until he had felt around
with his hands, did he remember his situation. Then it all came
to him.</p>

<p>"This is a pretty piece of business," he thought, as he arose
to his feet. "Poor Howard is half-frightened to death, and I suppose
is still hunting for me. But I don't hear him."</p>

<p>He listened, but all was still.</p>

<p>"It may be that he has grown tired, but will hear me if I call
to him."</p>

<p>Whereupon he whistled again and again, and shouted and listened
and then repeated his signals, but there was no response. But
for the intervening hills his cry would have reached the two watchers
by the river shore, but with twice the penetrating power he still
would have failed to reach them.</p>

<p>"Well, the best thing I can do is to wait here until morning,
and then I can make my way back again."</p>

<p>His sickness was gone, but he felt somewhat chilled from lying
upon the ground with no extra covering, although the night was
quite moderate, if not really warm. The contact with the ground
had made a portion of his body cold, and the sluggish circulation
prompted him to exercise.</p>

<p>"I hardly know whether to stay here or to go back to the woods
and take refuge in a tree. Some animals may find me here, while
I shall be safe if I am only twenty feet above ground."</p>

<p>The vivid recollection of the wolverines gave him this fear and
finally induced him to leave the place and seek shelter.</p>

<p>But at the moment of starting he was confronted by an alarming
difficulty. He found it impossible to decide upon the proper course
to follow, and could not tell with certainty which way led in
or out. This resulted from his having turned around several times
in his effort to restore warmth and circulation on awaking from
his sleep. Had he not done this the position in which he lay during
slumber would have told him the truth.</p>

<p>"How strange!" he reflected, vainly seeking to recover from his
bewilderment. "If I only had a little light I think I could tell,
but this is rather delicate business when I don't know whether
I may go over the rocks or not."</p>

<p>He leaned against the wall of the path and thought. At last he
believed he knew which way to turn, and facing backward he began
to pick his way out. This, we may say, was the right course, and
had he only persevered in it would have brought him out of the
hills into the woods, restored him to Tim and Howard a few hours
later and saved him one of the most momentous experiences of his
life.</p>

<p>He had retreated but a few rods when he became sure he had made
a mistake and was going wrong. It seemed from his contact with
the rocks and the curious windings it made, that he had never
passed over the ground, but was advancing further into the hills.</p>

<p>"This will not do," he said aloud, as he paused. "I am astray
and must change about."</p>

<p>He did so at once, and believing, of a surety, that he was now
upon the right path he walked much faster than was prudent. The
truth was, the associations of the plate were such as to make
him in a hurry to get away from it. He knew he would feel relieved
when he could get once more into the open air of the woods. A
strange fear that the overhanging rock would fall or imprison
him caused him to hasten still more. After walking some time further
he slackened his steps.</p>

<p>"I must be pretty near the opening, judging by the distance I
have come; and if such be the case&mdash;"</p>

<p>Further words were checked, for at that instant Elwood stepped
off the path and went down&mdash;down!</p>
