<blockquote>&quot;And the King commandeth and forbiddeth, that from henceforth
neither fairs nor markets be kept in Churchyards, for the honour
of the Church.&quot; - STATUTES : 13 Edw. I. Stat. II. cap. vi.</blockquote>
<P>As that venerable and learned poet (whose voluminous works we
all think it the correct thing to admire and talk about, but
don't read often) most truly says, &quot;The child is father to the
man;&quot; a fortiori, therefore, he must be father to the boy.  So
as we are going at any rate to see Tom Brown through his
boyhood, supposing we never get any farther (which, if you show
a proper sense of the value of this history, there is no knowing
but what we may), let us have a look at the life and
environments of the child in the quiet country village to which
we were introduced in the last chapter.</P>
<P>Tom, as has been already said, was a robust and combative
urchin, and at the age of four began to struggle against the
yoke and authority of his nurse.  That functionary was a good-
hearted, tearful, scatter-brained girl, lately taken by Tom's
mother, Madam Brown, as she was called, from the village school
to be trained as nurserymaid.  Madam Brown was a rare trainer of
servants, and spent herself freely in the profession; for
profession it was, and gave her more trouble by half than many
people take to earn a good income.  Her servants were known and
sought after for miles round.  Almost all the girls who attained
a certain place in the village school were taken by her, one or
two at a time, as housemaids, laundrymaids, nurserymaids, or
kitchenmaids, and after a year or two's training were started in
life amongst the neighbouring families, with good principles and
wardrobes.  One of the results of this system was the perpetual
despair of Mrs. Brown's cook and own maid, who no sooner had a
notable girl made to their hands than missus was sure to find a
good place for her and send her off, taking in fresh
importations from the school.  Another was, that the house was
always full of young girls, with clean, shining faces, who broke
plates and scorched linen, but made an atmosphere of cheerful,
homely life about the place, good for every one who came within
its influence.  Mrs. Brown loved young people, and in fact human
creatures in general, above plates and linen.  They were more
like a lot of elder children than servants, and felt to her more
as a mother or aunt than as a mistress.</P>
<P>Tom's nurse was one who took in her instruction very slowly - 
she seemed to have two left hands and no head; and so Mrs. Brown
kept her on longer than usual, that she might expend her
awkwardness and forgetfulness upon those who would not judge and
punish her too strictly for them.</P>
<P>Charity Lamb was her name.  It had been the immemorial habit of
the village to christen children either by Bible names, or by
those of the cardinal and other virtues; so that one was for
ever hearing in the village street or on the green, shrill
sounds of &quot;Prudence! Prudence! thee cum' out o' the gutter;&quot; or,
&quot;Mercy! drat the girl, what bist thee a-doin' wi' little Faith?&quot;
and there were Ruths, Rachels, Keziahs, in every corner.  The
same with the boys:  they were Benjamins, Jacobs, Noahs, Enochs.
I suppose the custom has come down from Puritan times.  There it
is, at any rate, very strong still in the Vale.</P>
<P>Well, from early morning till dewy eve, when she had it out of
him in the cold tub before putting him to bed, Charity and Tom
were pitted against one another.  Physical power was as yet on
the side of Charity, but she hadn't a chance with him wherever
headwork was wanted.  This war of independence began every
morning before breakfast, when Charity escorted her charge to a
neighbouring farmhouse, which supplied the Browns, and where, by
his mother's wish, Master Tom went to drink whey before
breakfast.  Tom had no sort of objection to whey, but he had a
decided liking for curds, which were forbidden as unwholesome;
and there was seldom a morning that he did not manage to secure
a handful of hard curds, in defiance of Charity and of the
farmer's wife.  The latter good soul was a gaunt, angular woman,
who, with an old black bonnet on the top of her head, the
strings dangling about her shoulders, and her gown tucked
through her pocket-holes, went clattering about the dairy,
cheese-room, and yard, in high pattens.  Charity was some sort
of niece of the old lady's, and was consequently free of the
farmhouse and garden, into which she could not resist going for
the purposes of gossip and flirtation with the heir-apparent,
who was a dawdling fellow, never out at work as he ought to have
been.  The moment Charity had found her cousin, or any other
occupation, Tom would slip away; and in a minute shrill cries
would be heard from the dairy, &quot;Charity, Charity, thee lazy
huzzy, where bist?&quot; and Tom would break cover, hands and mouth
full of curds, and take refuge on the shaky surface of the great
muck reservoir in the middle of the yard, disturbing the repose
of the great pigs.  Here he was in safety, as no grown person
could follow without getting over their knees; and the luckless
Charity, while her aunt scolded her from the dairy door, for
being &quot;allus hankering about arter our Willum, instead of
minding Master Tom,&quot; would descend from threats to coaxing, to
lure Tom out of the muck, which was rising over his shoes, and
would soon tell a tale on his stockings, for which she would be
sure to catch it from missus's maid.</P>
<P>Tom had two abettors, in the shape of a couple of old boys, Noah
and Benjamin by name, who defended him from Charity, and
expended much time upon his education.  They were both of them
retired servants of former generations of the Browns.  Noah
Crooke was a keen, dry old man of almost ninety, but still able
to totter about.  He talked to Tom quite as if he were one of
his own family, and indeed had long completely identified the
Browns with himself.  In some remote age he had been the
attendant of a Miss Brown, and had conveyed her about the
country on a pillion.  He had a little round picture of the
identical gray horse, caparisoned with the identical pillion,
before which he used to do a sort of fetish worship, and abuse
turnpike-roads and carriages.  He wore an old full-bottomed wig,
the gift of some dandy old Brown whom he had valeted in the
middle of last century, which habiliment Master Tom looked upon
with considerable respect, not to say fear; and indeed his whole
feeling towards Noah was strongly tainted with awe.  And when
the old gentleman was gathered to his fathers, Tom's lamentation
over him was not unaccompanied by a certain joy at having seen
the last of the wig.  &quot;Poor old Noah, dead and gone,&quot; said he;
&quot;Tom Brown so sorry.  Put him in the coffin, wig and all.&quot;</P>
<P>But old Benjy was young master's real delight and refuge.  He
was a youth by the side of Noah, scarce seventy years old - a
cheery, humorous, kind-hearted old man, full of sixty years of
Vale gossip, and of all sorts of helpful ways for young and old,
but above all for children.  It was he who bent the first pin
with which Tom extracted his first stickleback out of &quot;Pebbly
Brook,&quot; the little stream which ran through the village.  The
first stickleback was a splendid fellow, with fabulous red and
blue gills.  Tom kept him in a small basin till the day of his
death, and became a fisherman from that day.  Within a month
from the taking of the first stickleback, Benjy had carried off
our hero to the canal, in defiance of Charity; and between them,
after a whole afternoon's popjoying, they had caught three or
four small, coarse fish and a perch, averaging perhaps two and a
half ounces each, which Tom bore home in rapture to his mother
as a precious gift, and which she received like a true mother
with equal rapture, instructing the cook nevertheless, in a
private interview, not to prepare the same for the Squire's
dinner.  Charity had appealed against old Benjy in the meantime,
representing the dangers of the canal banks; but Mrs. Brown,
seeing the boy's inaptitude for female guidance, had decided in
Benjy's favour, and from thenceforth the old man was Tom's dry
nurse.  And as they sat by the canal watching their little
green-and-white float, Benjy would instruct him in the doings of
deceased Browns.  How his grandfather, in the early days of the
great war, when there was much distress and crime in the Vale,
and the magistrates had been threatened by the mob, had ridden
in with a big stick in his hand, and held the petty sessions by
himself.  How his great-uncle, the rector, had encountered and
laid the last ghost, who had frightened the old women, male and
female, of the parish out of their senses, and who turned out to
be the blacksmith's apprentice disguised in drink and a white
sheet.  It was Benjy, too, who saddled Tom's first pony, and
instructed him in the mysteries of horsemanship, teaching him to
throw his weight back and keep his hand low, and who stood
chuckling outside the door of the girls' school when Tom rode
his little Shetland into the cottage and round the table, where
the old dame and her pupils were seated at their work.</P>
<P>Benjy himself was come of a family distinguished in the Vale for
their prowess in all athletic games.  Some half-dozen of his
brothers and kinsmen had gone to the wars, of whom only one had
survived to come home, with a small pension, and three bullets
in different parts of his body; he had shared Benjy's cottage
till his death, and had left him his old dragoon's sword and
pistol, which hung over the mantelpiece, flanked by a pair of
heavy single-sticks with which Benjy himself had won renown long
ago as an old gamester, against the picked men of Wiltshire and
Somersetshire, in many a good bout at the revels and pastimes of
the country-side.  For he had been a famous back-swordman in his
young days, and a good wrestler at elbow and collar.</P>
<P>Back-swording and wrestling were the most serious holiday
pursuits of the Vale - those by which men attained fame - and
each village had its champion.  I suppose that, on the whole,
people were less worked then than they are now; at any rate,
they seemed to have more time and energy for the old pastimes.
The great times for back-swording came round once a year in each
village; at the feast.  The Vale &quot;veasts&quot; were not the common
statute feasts, but much more ancient business.  They are
literally, so far as one can ascertain, feasts of the dedication
&mdash; that is, they were first established in the churchyard on the
day on which the village church was opened for public worship,
which was on the wake or festival of the patron saint, and have
been held on the same day in every year since that time.</P>
There was no longer any remembrance of why the &quot;veast&quot; had been
instituted, but nevertheless it had a pleasant and almost sacred
character of its own; for it was then that all the children of
the village, wherever they were scattered, tried to get home for
a holiday to visit their fathers and mothers and friends,
bringing with them their wages or some little gift from up the
country for the old folk.  Perhaps for a day or two before, but
at any rate on &quot;veast day&quot; and the day after, in our village,
you might see strapping, healthy young men and women from all
parts of the country going round from house to house in their
best clothes, and finishing up with a call on Madam Brown, whom
they would consult as to putting out their earnings to the best
advantage, or how best to expend the same for the benefit of the
old folk.  Every household, however poor, managed to raise a
&quot;feast-cake&quot; and a bottle of ginger or raisin wine, which stood
on the cottage table ready for all comers, and not unlikely to
make them remember feast-time, for feast-cake is very solid, and
full of huge raisins.  Moreover, feast-time was the day of
reconciliation for the parish.  If Job Higgins and Noah Freeman
hadn't spoken for the last six months, their &quot;old women&quot; would
be sure to get it patched up by that day.  And though there was
a good deal of drinking and low vice in the booths of an
evening, it was pretty well confined to those who would have
been doing the like, &quot;veast or no veast;&quot; and on the whole, the
effect was humanising and Christian.  In fact, the only reason
why this is not the case still is that gentlefolk and farmers
have taken to other amusements, and have, as usual, forgotten
the poor.  They don't attend the feasts themselves, and call
them disreputable; whereupon the steadiest of the poor leave
them also, and they become what they are called.  Class
amusements, be they for dukes or ploughboys, always become
nuisances and curses to a country.  The true charm of cricket
and hunting is that they are still more or less sociable and
universal; there's a place for every man who will come and take
his part.</P>
<P>No one in the village enjoyed the approach of &quot;veast day&quot; more
than Tom, in the year in which he was taken under old Benjy's
tutelage.  The feast was held in a large green field at the
lower end of the village.  The road to Farringdon ran along one
side of it, and the brook by the side of the road; and above the
brook was another large, gentle, sloping pasture-land, with a
footpath running down it from the churchyard; and the old
church, the originator of all the mirth, towered up with its
gray walls and lancet windows, overlooking and sanctioning the
whole, though its own share therein had been forgotten.  At the
point where the footpath crossed the brook and road, and entered
on the field where the feast was held, was a long, low roadside
inn; and on the opposite side of the field was a large white
thatched farmhouse, where dwelt an old sporting farmer, a great
promoter of the revels.</P>
<P>Past the old church, and down the footpath, pottered the old man
and the child hand-in-hand early on the afternoon of the day
before the feast, and wandered all round the ground, which was
already being occupied by the &quot;cheap Jacks,&quot; with their green-
covered carts and marvellous assortment of wares; and the booths
of more legitimate small traders, with their tempting arrays of
fairings and eatables; and penny peep-shows and other shows,
containing pink-eyed ladies, and dwarfs, and boa-constrictors,
and wild Indians.  But the object of most interest to Benjy, and
of course to his pupil also, was the stage of rough planks some
four feet high, which was being put up by the village carpenter
for the back-swording and wrestling.  And after surveying the
whole tenderly, old Benjy led his charge away to the roadside
inn, where he ordered a glass of ale and a long pipe for
himself, and discussed these unwonted luxuries on the bench
outside in the soft autumn evening with mine host, another old
servant of the Browns, and speculated with him on the likelihood
of a good show of old gamesters to contend for the morrow's
prizes, and told tales of the gallant bouts of forty years back,
to which Tom listened with all his ears and eyes.</P>
<P>But who shall tell the joy of the next morning, when the church
bells were ringing a merry peal, and old Benjy appeared in the
servants' hall, resplendent in a long blue coat and brass
buttons, and a pair of old yellow buckskins and top-boots which
he had cleaned for and inherited from Tom's grandfather, a stout
thorn stick in his hand, and a nosegay of pinks and lavender in
his buttonhole, and led away Tom in his best clothes, and two
new shillings in his breeches-pockets?  Those two, at any rate,
look like enjoying the day's revel.</P>
<P>They quicken their pace when they get into the churchyard, for
already they see the field thronged with country folk; the men
in clean, white smocks or velveteen or fustian coats, with rough
plush waistcoats of many colours, and the women in the
beautiful, long scarlet cloak - the usual out-door dress of
west-country women in those days, and which often descended in
families from mother to daughter - or in new-fashioned stuff
shawls, which, if they would but believe it, don't become them
half so well.  The air resounds with the pipe and tabor, and the
drums and trumpets of the showmen shouting at the doors of their
caravans, over which tremendous pictures of the wonders to be
seen within hang temptingly; while through all rises the shrill
&quot;root-too-too-too&quot; of Mr. Punch, and the unceasing pan-pipe of
his satellite.</P>
<P>&quot;Lawk a' massey, Mr. Benjamin,&quot; cries a stout, motherly woman in
a red cloak, as they enter the field, &quot;be that you?  Well, I
never!  You do look purely.  And how's the Squire, and madam,
and the family?&quot;</P>
<P>Benjy graciously shakes hands with the speaker, who has left our
village for some years, but has come over for &quot;veast&quot; day on a
visit to an old gossip, and gently indicates the heir-apparent
of the Browns.</P>
<P>&quot;Bless his little heart!  I must gi' un a kiss.  - Here,
Susannah, Susannah!&quot; cries she, raising herself from the
embrace, &quot;come and see Mr. Benjamin and young Master Tom.  - You
minds our Sukey, Mr. Benjamin; she be growed a rare slip of a
wench since you seen her, though her'll be sixteen come
Martinmas.  I do aim to take her to see madam to get her a
place.&quot;</P>
<P>And Sukey comes bouncing away from a knot of old school-fellows,
and drops a curtsey to Mr. Benjamin.  And elders come up from
all parts to salute Benjy, and girls who have been madam's
pupils to kiss Master Tom.  And they carry him off to load him
with fairings; and he returns to Benjy, his hat and coat covered
with ribbons, and his pockets crammed with wonderful boxes which
open upon ever new boxes, and popguns, and trumpets, and apples,
and gilt gingerbread from the stall of Angel Heavens, sole
vender thereof, whose booth groans with kings and queens, and
elephants and prancing steeds, all gleaming with gold.  There
was more gold on Angel's cakes than there is ginger in those of
this degenerate age.  Skilled diggers might yet make a fortune
in the churchyards of the Vale, by carefully washing the dust of
the consumers of Angel's gingerbread.  Alas! he is with his
namesakes, and his receipts have, I fear, died with him.</P>
<P>And then they inspect the penny peep-show - at least Tom does - 
while old Benjy stands outside and gossips and walks up the
steps, and enters the mysterious doors of the pink-eyed lady and
the Irish giant, who do not by any means come up to their
pictures; and the boa will not swallow his rabbit, but there the
rabbit is waiting to be swallowed; and what can you expect for
tuppence?  We are easily pleased in the Vale.  Now there is a
rush of the crowd, and a tinkling bell is heard, and shouts of
laughter; and Master Tom mounts on Benjy's shoulders, and
beholds a jingling match in all its glory.  The games are begun,
and this is the opening of them.  It is a quaint game, immensely
amusing to look at; and as I don't know whether it is used in
your counties, I had better describe it.  A large roped ring is
made, into which are introduced a dozen or so of big boys and
young men who mean to play; these are carefully blinded and
turned loose into the ring, and then a man is introduced not
blindfolded; with a bell hung round his neck, and his two hands
tied behind him.  Of course every time he moves the bell must
ring, as he has no hand to hold it; and so the dozen blindfolded
men have to catch him.  This they cannot always manage if he is
a lively fellow, but half of them always rush into the arms of
the other half, or drive their heads together, or tumble over;
and then the crowd laughs vehemently, and invents nicknames for
them on the spur of the moment; and they, if they be choleric,
tear off the handkerchiefs which blind them, and not
unfrequently pitch into one another, each thinking that the
other must have run against him on purpose.  It is great fun to
look at a jingling match certainly, and Tom shouts and jumps on
old Benjy's shoulders at the sight, until the old man feels
weary, and shifts him to the strong young shoulders of the
groom, who has just got down to the fun.</P>
<P>And now, while they are climbing the pole in another part of the
field, and muzzling in a flour-tub in another, the old farmer
whose house, as has been said, overlooks the field, and who is
master of the revels, gets up the steps on to the stage, and
announces to all whom it may concern that a half-sovereign in
money will be forthcoming to the old gamester who breaks most
heads; to which the Squire and he have added a new hat.</P>
<P>The amount of the prize is sufficient to stimulate the men of
the immediate neighbourhood, but not enough to bring any very
high talent from a distance; so, after a glance or two round, a
tall fellow, who is a down shepherd, chucks his hat on to the
stage and climbs up the steps, looking rather sheepish.  The
crowd, of course, first cheer, and then chaff as usual, as he
picks up his hat and begins handling the sticks to see which
will suit him.</P>
<P>&quot;Wooy, Willum Smith, thee canst plaay wi' he arra daay,&quot; says
his companion to the blacksmith's apprentice, a stout young
fellow of nineteen or twenty.  Willum's sweetheart is in the
&quot;veast&quot; somewhere, and has strictly enjoined him not to get his
head broke at back-swording, on pain of her highest displeasure;
but as she is not to be seen (the women pretend not to like to
see the backsword play, and keep away from the stage), and as
his hat is decidedly getting old, he chucks it on to the stage,
and follows himself, hoping that he will only have to break
other people's heads, or that, after all, Rachel won't really
mind.</P>
<P>Then follows the greasy cap lined with fur of a half-gipsy,
poaching, loafing fellow, who travels the Vale not for much
good, I fancy:</P>
<blockquote>&quot;Full twenty times was Peter feared<br>
For once that Peter was respected,&quot;</blockquote>
<P>in fact.  And then three or four other hats, including the
glossy castor of Joe Willis, the self-elected and would-be
champion of the neighbourhood, a well-to-do young butcher of
twenty-eight or thereabouts, and a great strapping fellow, with
his full allowance of bluster.  This is a capital show of
gamesters, considering the amount of the prize; so, while they
are picking their sticks and drawing their lots, I think I must
tell you, as shortly as I can, how the noble old game of back-
sword is played; for it is sadly gone out of late, even in the
Vale, and maybe you have never seen it.</P>
<P>The weapon is a good stout ash stick with a large basket handle,
heavier and somewhat shorter than a common single-stick.  The
players are called &quot;old gamesters&quot; - why, I can't tell you - and
their object is simply to break one another's heads; for the
moment that blood runs an inch anywhere above the eyebrow, the
old gamester to whom it belongs is beaten, and has to stop.  A
very slight blow with the sticks will fetch blood, so that it is
by no means a punishing pastime, if the men don't play on
purpose and savagely at the body and arms of their adversaries.
The old gamester going into action only takes off his hat and
coat, and arms himself with a stick; he then loops the fingers
of his left hand in a handkerchief or strap, which he fastens
round his left leg, measuring the length, so that when he draws
it tight with his left elbow in the air, that elbow shall just
reach as high as his crown.  Thus you see, so long as he chooses
to keep his left elbow up, regardless of cuts, he has a perfect
guard for the left side of his head.  Then he advances his right
hand above and in front of his head, holding his stick across,
so that its point projects an inch or two over his left elbow;
and thus his whole head is completely guarded, and he faces his
man armed in like manner; and they stand some three feet apart,
often nearer, and feint, and strike, and return at one another's
heads, until one cries &quot;hold,&quot; or blood flows.  In the first
case they are allowed a minute's time; and go on again; in the
latter another pair of gamesters are called on.  If good men are
playing, the quickness of the returns is marvellous:  you hear
the rattle like that a boy makes drawing his stick along
palings, only heavier; and the closeness of the men in action to
one another gives it a strange interest, and makes a spell at
back-swording a very noble sight.</P>
<P>They are all suited now with sticks, and Joe Willis and the
gipsy man have drawn the first lot.  So the rest lean against
the rails of the stage, and Joe and the dark man meet in the
middle, the boards having been strewed with sawdust, Joe's white
shirt and spotless drab breeches and boots contrasting with the
gipsy's coarse blue shirt and dirty green velveteen breeches and
leather gaiters.  Joe is evidently turning up his nose at the
other, and half insulted at having to break his head.</P>
<P>The gipsy is a tough, active fellow, but not very skilful with
his weapon, so that Joe's weight and strength tell in a minute;
he is too heavy metal for him.  Whack, whack, whack, come his
blows, breaking down the gipsy's guard, and threatening to reach
his head every moment.  There it is at last.  &quot;Blood, blood!&quot;
shout the spectators, as a thin stream oozes out slowly from the
roots of his hair, and the umpire calls to them to stop.  The
gipsy scowls at Joe under his brows in no pleasant manner, while
Master Joe swaggers about, and makes attitudes, and thinks
himself, and shows that he thinks himself, the greatest man in
the field.</P>
<P>Then follow several stout sets-to between the other candidates
for the new hat, and at last come the shepherd and Willum Smith.
This is the crack set-to of the day.  They are both in famous
wind, and there is no crying &quot;hold.&quot;  The shepherd is an old
hand, and up to all the dodges.  He tries them one after
another, and very nearly gets at Willum's head by coming in
near, and playing over his guard at the half-stick; but somehow
Willum blunders through, catching the stick on his shoulders,
neck, sides, every now and then, anywhere but on his head, and
his returns are heavy and straight, and he is the youngest
gamester and a favourite in the parish, and his gallant stand
brings down shouts and cheers, and the knowing ones think he'll
win if he keeps steady; and Tom, on the groom's shoulder, holds
his hands together, and can hardly breathe for excitement.</P>
<P>Alas for Willum!  His sweetheart, getting tired of female
companionship, has been hunting the booths to see where he can
have got to, and now catches sight of him on the stage in full
combat.  She flushes and turns pale; her old aunt catches hold
of her, saying, &quot;Bless 'ee, child, doan't 'ee go a'nigst it;&quot;
but she breaks away and runs towards the stage calling his name.
Willum keeps up his guard stoutly, but glances for a moment
towards the voice.  No guard will do it, Willum, without the
eye.  The shepherd steps round and strikes, and the point of his
stick just grazes Willum's forehead, fetching off the skin, and
the blood flows, and the umpire cries, &quot;Hold!&quot; and poor Willum's
chance is up for the day.  But he takes it very well, and puts
on his old hat and coat, and goes down to be scolded by his
sweetheart, and led away out of mischief.  Tom hears him say
coaxingly, as he walks off, -</P>
<P>&quot;Now doan't 'ee, Rachel!  I wouldn't ha' done it, only I wanted
summut to buy 'ee a fairing wi', and I be as vlush o' money as a
twod o' feathers.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thee mind what I tells 'ee,&quot; rejoins Rachel saucily, &quot;and
doan't 'ee kep blethering about fairings.&quot;</P>
<P>Tom resolves in his heart to give Willum the remainder of his
two shillings after the back-swording.</P>
<P>Joe Willis has all the luck to-day.  His next bout ends in an
easy victory, while the shepherd has a tough job to break his
second head; and when Joe and the shepherd meet, and the whole
circle expect and hope to see him get a broken crown, the
shepherd slips in the first round and falls against the rails,
hurting himself so that the old farmer will not let him go on,
much as he wishes to try; and that impostor Joe (for he is
certainly not the best man) struts and swaggers about the stage
the conquering gamester, though he hasn't had five minutes'
really trying play.</P>
<P>Joe takes the new hat in his hand, and puts the money into it,
and then, as if a thought strikes him, and he doesn't think his
victory quite acknowledged down below, walks to each face of the
stage, and looks down, shaking the money, and chaffing, as how
he'll stake hat and money and another half-sovereign &quot;agin any
gamester as hasn't played already.&quot;  Cunning Joe! he thus gets
rid of Willum and the shepherd, who is quite fresh again.</P>
<P>No one seems to like the offer, and the umpire is just coming
down, when a queer old hat, something like a doctor of
divinity's shovel, is chucked on to the stage and an elderly,
quiet man steps out, who has been watching the play, saying he
should like to cross a stick wi' the prodigalish young chap.</P>
<P>The crowd cheer, and begin to chaff Joe, who turns up his nose
and swaggers across to the sticks.  &quot;Imp'dent old wosbird!&quot; says
he; &quot;I'll break the bald head on un to the truth.&quot;</P>
<P>The old boy is very bald, certainly, and the blood will show
fast enough if you can touch him, Joe.</P>
<P>He takes off his long-flapped coat, and stands up in a long-
flapped waistcoat, which Sir Roger de Coverley might have worn
when it was new, picks out a stick, and is ready for Master Joe,
who loses no time, but begins his old game, whack, whack, whack,
trying to break down the old man's guard by sheer strength.  But
it won't do; he catches every blow close by the basket, and
though he is rather stiff in his returns, after a minute walks
Joe about the stage, and is clearly a stanch old gamester.  Joe
now comes in, and making the most of his height, tries to get
over the old man's guard at half-stick, by which he takes a
smart blow in the ribs and another on the elbow, and nothing
more.  And now he loses wind and begins to puff, and the crowd
laugh.  &quot;Cry 'hold,' Joe; thee'st met thy match!&quot;  Instead of
taking good advice and getting his wind, Joe loses his temper,
and strikes at the old man's body.</P>
<P>&quot;Blood, blood!&quot; shout the crowd; &quot;Joe's head's broke!&quot;</P>
<P>Who'd have thought it?  How did it come?  That body-blow left
Joe's head unguarded for a moment; and with one turn of the
wrist the old gentleman has picked a neat little bit of skin off
the middle of his forehead; and though he won't believe it, and
hammers on for three more blows despite of the shouts, is then
convinced by the blood trickling into his eye.  Poor Joe is
sadly crestfallen, and fumbles in his pocket for the other half-
sovereign, but the old gamester won't have it.  &quot;Keep thy money,
man, and gi's thy hand,&quot; says he; and they shake hands.  But the
old gamester gives the new hat to the shepherd, and, soon after,
the half-sovereign to Willum, who thereout decorates his
sweetheart with ribbons to his heart's content.</P>
<P>&quot;Who can a be?&quot;  &quot;Wur do a cum from?&quot; ask the crowd.  And it
soon flies about that the old west-country champion, who played
a tie with Shaw the Lifeguardsman at &quot;Vizes&quot; twenty years
before, has broken Joe Willis's crown for him.</P>
<P>How my country fair is spinning out!  I see I must skip the
wrestling; and the boys jumping in sacks, and rolling
wheelbarrows blindfolded; and the donkey-race, and the fight
which arose thereout, marring the otherwise peaceful &quot;veast;&quot;
and the frightened scurrying away of the female feast-goers, and
descent of Squire Brown, summoned by the wife of one of the
combatants to stop it; which he wouldn't start to do till he had
got on his top-boots.  Tom is carried away by old Benjy, dog-
tired and surfeited with pleasure, as the evening comes on and
the dancing begins in the booths; and though Willum, and Rachel
in her new ribbons, and many another good lad and lass don't
come away just yet, but have a good step out, and enjoy it, and
get no harm thereby, yet we, being sober folk, will just stroll
away up through the churchyard, and by the old yew-tree, and get
a quiet dish of tea and a parley with our gossips, as the steady
ones of our village do, and so to bed.</P>
<P>That's the fair, true sketch, as far as it goes, of one of the
larger village feasts in the Vale of Berks, when I was a little
boy.  They are much altered for the worse, I am told.  I haven't
been at one these twenty years, but I have been at the statute
fairs in some west-country towns, where servants are hired, and
greater abominations cannot be found.  What village feasts have
come to, I fear, in many cases, may be read in the pages of
&quot;Yeast&quot; (though I never saw one so bad - thank God!).</P>
<P>Do you want to know why?  It is because, as I said before,
gentlefolk and farmers have left off joining or taking an
interest in them.  They don't either subscribe to the prizes, or
go down and enjoy the fun.</P>
<P>Is this a good or a bad sign?  I hardly know.  Bad, sure enough,
if it only arises from the further separation of classes
consequent on twenty years of buying cheap and selling dear, and
its accompanying overwork; or because our sons and daughters
have their hearts in London club-life, or so-called &quot;society,&quot;
instead of in the old English home-duties; because farmers' sons
are apeing fine gentlemen, and farmers' daughters caring more to
make bad foreign music than good English cheeses.  Good,
perhaps, if it be that the time for the old &quot;veast&quot; has gone by;
that it is no longer the healthy, sound expression of English
country holiday-making; that, in fact, we, as a nation, have got
beyond it, and are in a transition state, feeling for and soon
likely to find some better substitute.</P>
<P>Only I have just got this to say before I quit the text.  Don't
let reformers of any sort think that they are going really to
lay hold of the working boys and young men of England by any
educational grapnel whatever, which isn't some bona fide
equivalent for the games of the old country &quot;veast&quot; in it;
something to put in the place of the back-swording and wrestling
and racing; something to try the muscles of men's bodies, and
the endurance of their hearts, and to make them rejoice in their
strength.  In all the new-fangled comprehensive plans which I
see, this is all left out; and the consequence is, that your
great mechanics' institutes end in intellectual priggism, and
your Christian young men's societies in religious Pharisaism.</P>
<P>Well, well, we must bide our time.  Life isn't all beer and
skittles; but beer and skittles, or something better of the same
sort, must form a good part of every Englishman's education.  If
I could only drive this into the heads of you rising
parliamentary lords, and young swells who &quot;have your ways made
for you,&quot; as the saying is, you, who frequent palaver houses and
West-end clubs, waiting always ready to strap yourselves on to
the back of poor dear old John, as soon as the present used-up
lot (your fathers and uncles), who sit there on the great
parliamentary-majorities' pack-saddle, and make believe they're
guiding him with their red-tape bridle, tumble, or have to be
lifted off!</P>
<P>I don't think much of you yet - I wish I could - though you do
go talking and lecturing up and down the country to crowded
audiences, and are busy with all sorts of philanthropic
intellectualism, and circulating libraries and museums, and
Heaven only knows what besides, and try to make us think,
through newspaper reports, that you are, even as we, of the
working classes.  But bless your hearts, we &quot;ain't so green,&quot;
though lots of us of all sorts toady you enough certainly, and
try to make you think so.</P>
<P>I'll tell you what to do now:  instead of all this trumpeting and
fuss, which is only the old parliamentary-majority dodge over
again, just you go, each of you (you've plenty of time for it,
if you'll only give up t'other line), and quietly make three or
four friends - real friends - among us.  You'll find a little
trouble in getting at the right sort, because such birds don't
come lightly to your lure; but found they may be.  Take, say,
two out of the professions, lawyer, parson, doctor - which you
will; one out of trade; and three or four out of the working
classes - tailors, engineers, carpenters, engravers.  There's
plenty of choice.  Let them be men of your own ages, mind, and
ask them to your homes; introduce them to your wives and
sisters, and get introduced to theirs; give them good dinners,
and talk to them about what is really at the bottom of your
hearts; and box, and run, and row with them, when you have a
chance.  Do all this honestly as man to man, and by the time you
come to ride old John, you'll be able to do something more than
sit on his back, and may feel his mouth with some stronger
bridle than a red-tape one.</P>
<P>Ah, if you only would!  But you have got too far out of the
right rut, I fear.  Too much over-civilization, and the
deceitfulness of riches.  It is easier for a camel to go through
the eye of a needle.  More's the pity.  I never came across but
two of you who could value a man wholly and solely for what was
in him - who thought themselves verily and indeed of the same
flesh and blood as John Jones the attorney's clerk, and Bill
Smith the costermonger, and could act as if they thought so.</P>
