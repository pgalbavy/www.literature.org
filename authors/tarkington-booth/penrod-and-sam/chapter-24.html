<p>"Well, what you want?" Penrod asked, brusquely.</p>

<p>Marjorie's wonderful eyes were dark and mysterious, like still
water at twilight.</p>

<p>"What makes you behave so <em>AWFUL?" </em>she whispered.</p>

<p>"I don't either! I guess I got a right to do the way I want to,
haven't I?"</p>

<p>"Well, anyway," said Marjorie, "you ought to quit bumping into
people so it hurts."</p>

<p>"Poh! It wouldn't hurt a fly!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it did. It hurt when you bumped Maurice and me that time."</p>

<p>"It didn't either. <em>WHERE'D </em>it hurt you? Let's see if
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't show you, but it did. Penrod, are you going to
keep on?"</p>

<p>Penrod's heart had melted within him; but his reply was pompous
and cold. "I will if I feel like it, and I won't if I feel like
it. You wait and see."</p>

<p>But Marjorie jumped up and ran around to him abandoning her escort.
All the children were leaving their chairs and moving toward the
dancing-rooms; the orchestra was playing dance-music again.</p>

<p>"Come on, Penrod!" Marjorie cried. "Let's go dance this together.
Come on!"</p>

<p>With seeming reluctance, he suffered her to lead him away. "Well,
I'll go with you; but I won't dance," he said "I wouldn't dance
with the President of the United States"</p>

<p>"Why, Penrod?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;because well, I won't DO it!"</p>

<p>"All right. I don't care. I guess I've danced plenty, anyhow.
Let's go in here." She led him into a room too small for dancing,
used ordinarily by Miss Amy Rennsdale's father as his study, and
now vacant. For a while there was silence; but finally Marjorie
pointed to the window and said shyly:</p>

<p>"Look, Penrod, it's getting dark. The party'll be over pretty
soon, and you've never danced one single time!"</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I know that, don't I?"</p>

<p>He was unable to cast aside his outward truculence though it
was but a relic. However, his voice was gentler, and Marjorie
seemed satisfied. From the other rooms came the swinging music,
shouts of "Gotcher bumpus!" sounds of stumbling, of scrambling,
of running, of muffled concus signs and squeals of dismay. Penrod's
followers were renewing the wild work, even in the absence of
their chief.</p>

<p>"Penrod Schofield, you bad boy," said Marjorie, "you started
every bit of that! You ought to be ashamed of yourself."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> didn't do anything," he said&mdash;and he believed it.
"Pick on me for everything!"</p>

<p>"Well, they wouldn't if you didn't do so much," said Marjorie.</p>

<p>"They would, too."</p>

<p>"They wouldn't, either. Who would?"</p>

<p>"That Miss Lowe," he specified bitterly. "Yes, and Baby Rennsdale's
aunts. If the house'd burn down, I bet they'd say Penrod Schofield
did it! Anybody does anything at <em>ALL, </em>they say, 'Penrod
Schofield, shame on you!' When you and Carlie were dan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Penrod, I just hate that little Carlie Chitten. P'fesser Bartet
made me learn that dance with him; but I just hate him."</p>

<p>Penrod was now almost completely mollified; nevertheless, he
continued to set forth his grievance. "Well, they all turned around
to me and they said, 'Why, Penrod Schofield, shame on you!' And
I hadn't done a single thing! I was just standin' there. They
got to blame ME, though!"</p>

<p>Marjorie laughed airily. "Well, if you aren't the foolishest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They would, too," he asserted, with renewed bitterness. "If
the house was to fall down, you'd see! They'd all say&mdash;"</p>

<p>Marjorie interrupted him. She put her hand on the top of her
head, looking a little startled.</p>

<p>"What's that?" she said.</p>

<p>"What's what?"</p>

<p>"Like rain!" Marjorie cried. "Like it was raining in here! A
drop fell on my&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, it couldn't&mdash;" he began. But at this instant a drop fell
upon his head, too, and, looking up, they beheld a great oozing
splotch upon the ceiling. Drops were gathering upon it and falling;
the tinted plaster was cracking, and a little stream began to
patter down and splash upon the floor. Then there came a resounding
thump upstairs, just above them, and fragments of wet plaster
fell.</p>

<p>"The roof must be leaking," said Marjorie, beginning to be alarmed.</p>

<p>"Couldn't be the roof," said Penrod. "Besides there ain't any
rain outdoors."</p>

<p>As he spoke, a second slender stream of water began to patter
upon the floor of the hall outside the door.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" Marjorie cried, while the ceiling above them
shook as with earthquake&mdash;or as with boys in numbers jumping,
and a great uproar burst forth overhead.</p>

<p>"I believe the house IS falling down, Penrod!" she quavered.</p>

<p>"Well, they'll blame ME for it!" he said. "Anyways, we better
get out o' here. I guess sumpthing must be the matter."</p>

<p>His guess was accurate, so far as it went. The dance-music had
swung into "Home Sweet Home" some time before, the children were
preparing to leave, and Master Chitten had been the first boy
to ascend to the gentlemen's dressing-room for his cap, overcoat
and shoes, his motive being to avoid by departure any difficulty
in case his earlier activities should cause him to be suspected
by the other boys. But in the doorway he halted, aghast.</p>

<p>The lights had not been turned on; but even the dim windows showed
that the polished floor gave back reflections no floor-polish
had ever equalled. It was a gently steaming lake, from an eighth
to a quarter of an inch deep. And Carlie realized that he had
forgotten to turn off the faucets in the bathroom.</p>

<p>For a moment, his savoir faire deserted him, and he was filled
with ordinary, human-boy panic. Then, at a sound of voices behind
him, he lost his head and rushed into the bathroom. It was dark,
but certain sensations and the splashing of his pumps warned him
that the water was deeper in there. The next instant the lights
were switched on in both bathroom and dressing-room, and Carlie
beheld Sam Williams in the doorway of the former.</p>

<p>"Oh, look, Maurice!" Sam shouted, in frantic excitement. "Somebody's
let the tub run over, and it's about ten feet deep! Carlie Chitten's
sloshin' around in here. Let's hold the door on him and keep him
in!"</p>

<p>Carlie rushed to prevent the execution of this project; but he
slipped and went swishing full length along the floor, creating
a little surf before him as he slid, to the demoniac happiness
of Sam and Maurice. They closed the door, however, and, as other
boys rushed, shouting and splashing, into the flooded dressing-room,
Carlie began to hammer upon the panels. Then the owners of shoes,
striving to rescue them from the increasing waters, made discoveries.</p>

<p>The most dangerous time to give a large children's party is when
there has not been one for a long period. The Rennsdale party
had that misfortune, and its climax was the complete and convulsive
madness of the gentlemen's dressing-room during those final moments
supposed to be given to quiet preparations, on the part of guests,
for departure.</p>

<p>In the upper hall and upon the stairway, panic-stricken little
girls listened, wild-eyed, to the uproar that went on, while waiters
and maid servants rushed with pails and towels into what was essentially
the worst ward in Bedlam. Boys who had behaved properly all afternoon
now gave way and joined the confraternity of lunatics. The floors
of the house shook to tramplings, rushes, wrestlings, falls and
collisions. The walls resounded to chorused bellowings and roars.
There were pipings of pain and pipings of joy; there was whistling
to pierce the drums of ears; there were hootings and howlings
and bleatings and screechings, while over all bleated the heathen
battle-cry incessantly: "<em>GOTCHER BUMPUS! GOTCHER BUMPUS!"
</em>For the boys had been inspired by the unusual water to transform
Penrod's game of "Gotcher bumpus" into an aquatic sport, and to
induce one another, by means of superior force, dexterity, or
stratagems, either to sit or to lie at full length in the flood,
after the example of Carlie Chitten.</p>

<p>One of the aunts Rennsdale had taken what charge she could of
the deafened and distracted maids and waiters who were working
to stem the tide, while the other of the aunts Rennsdale stood
with her niece and Miss Lowe at the foot of the stairs, trying
to say good-night reassuringly to those of the terrified little
girls who were able to tear themselves away. This latter aunt
Rennsdale marked a dripping figure that came unobtrusively, and
yet in a self-contained and gentlemanly manner, down the stairs.</p>

<p>"Carlie Chitten!" she cried. "You poor dear child, you're soaking!
To think those outrageous little fiends wouldn't even spare <em>YOU!"
</em>As she spoke, another departing male guest came from behind
Carlie and placed in her hand a snakelike article&mdash;a thing that
Miss Lowe seized and concealed with one sweeping gesture.</p>

<p>"It's some false hair somebody must of put in my overcoat pocket,"
said Roderick Magsworth Bitts. "Well, 'g-night. Thank you for
a very nice time."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Miss Rennsdale," said Master Chitten demurely. "Thank
you for a&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Miss Rennsdale detained him. "Carrie," she said earnestly,
"you're a dear boy, and I know you'll tell me something. It was
all Penrod Schofield, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"You mean he left the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean," she said, in a low tone, not altogether devoid of ferocity.
"I mean it was Penrod who left the faucets running, and Penrod
who tied the boys' shoes together, and filled some of them with
soap and mucilage, and put Miss Lowe's hair in Roddy Bitts's overcoat.
No; look me in the eye, Carlie! They were all shouting that silly
thing he started. Didn't he do it?"</p>

<p>Carlie cast down thoughtful eyes. "I wouldn't like to tell, Miss
Rennsdale," he said. "I guess I better be going or I'll catch
cold. Thank you for a very nice time."</p>

<p>"There!" said Miss Rennsdale vehemently, as Carlie went on his
way. "What did I tell you? Carlie Chitten's too manly to say it,
but I just <em>KNOW </em>it was that terrible Penrod Schofield."</p>

<p>Behind her, a low voice, unheard by all except the person to
whom it spoke, repeated a part of this speech: "What did I tell
you?"</p>

<p>This voice belonged to one Penrod Schofield.</p>

<p>Penrod and Marjorie had descended by another stairway, and he
now considered it wiser to pass to the rear of the little party
at the foot of the stairs. As he was still in his pumps, his choked
shoes occupying his overcoat pockets, he experienced no difficulty
in reaching the front door, and getting out of it unobserved,
although the noise upstairs was greatly abated. Marjorie, however,
made her curtseys and farewells in a creditable manner.</p>

<p>"There!" Penrod said again, when she rejoined him in the darkness
outside. "What did I tell you? Didn't I say I'd get the blame
of it, no matter if the house went and fell down? I s'pose they
think I put mucilage and soap in my own shoes."</p>

<p>Marjorie delayed at the gate until some eagerly talking little
girls had passed out. The name "Penrod Schofield" was thick and
scandalous among them.</p>

<p>"Well," said Marjorie, "<em>I</em> wouldn't care, Penrod. 'Course,
about soap and mucilage in <em>YOUR </em>shoes, anybody'd know
some other boy must of put 'em there to get even for what you
put in his."</p>

<p>Penrod gasped.</p>

<p>"But I <em>DIDN'T!" </em>he cried. "I didn't do <em>ANYTHING!
</em>That ole Miss Rennsdale can say what she wants to, I didn't
do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, Penrod," said Marjorie, softly, "they can't ever
<em>PROVE </em>it was you."</p>

<p>He felt himself suffocating in a coil against which no struggle
availed.</p>

<p>"But I never <em>DID </em>it!" he wailed, helplessly. "I never
did anything at all!"</p>

<p>She leaned toward him a little, and the lights from her waiting
carriage illumined her dimly, but enough for him to see that her
look was fond and proud, yet almost awed.</p>

<p>"Anyway, Penrod," she whispered, "<em>I</em> don't believe there's
any other boy in the whole world could of done <em>HALF </em>as
much!"</p>

<p>And with that, she left him, and ran out to the carriage.</p>

<p>But Penrod remained by the gate to wait for Sam, and the burden
of his sorrows was beginning to lift. In fact, he felt a great
deal better, in spite of his having just discovered why Marjorie
loved him.</p>
