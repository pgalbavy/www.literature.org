<p>Probably there was no happier Thanksgiving in all the Great World
than the Thanksgiving of Lightfoot the Deer, when the dreadful
hunting season ended and he was once more back in his beloved
Green Forest with nothing to fear. All his neighbors called on
him to tell him how glad they were that he had escaped and how
the Green Forest would not have been the same if he had not returned.
So Lightfoot roamed about without fear and was happy. It seemed
to him that he could not be happier. There was plenty to eat and
that blessed feeling of nothing to fear. What more could any one
ask? He began to grow sleek and fat and handsomer than ever. The
days were growing colder and the frosty air made him feel good.</p>

<p>Just at dusk one evening he went down to his favorite drinking
place at the Laughing Brook. As he put down his head to drink
he saw something which so surprised him that he quite forgot he
was thirsty. What do you think it was he saw? It was a footprint
in the soft mud. Yes, Sir, it was a footprint.</p>

<p>For a long time Lightfoot stood staring at that footprint. In
his great, soft eyes was a look of wonder and surprise. You see,
that footprint was exactly like one of his own, only smaller.
To Lightfoot it was a very wonderful footprint. He was quite sure
that never had he seen such a dainty footprint. He forgot to drink.
Instead, he began to search for other footprints, and presently
he found them. Each was as dainty as that first one.</p>

<p>Who could have made them? That is what Lightfoot wanted to know
and what he meant to find out. It was clear to him that there
was a stranger in the Green Forest, and somehow he didn't resent
it in the least. In fact, he was glad. He couldn't have told why,
but it was true.</p>

<p>Lightfoot put his nose to the footprints and sniffed of them.
Even had he not known by looking at those prints that they had
been made by a stranger, his nose would have told him this. A
great longing to find the maker of those footprints took possession
of him. He lifted his handsome head and listened for some slight
sound which might show that the stranger was near. With his delicate
nostrils he tested the wandering little Night Breezes for a stray
whiff of scent to tell him which way to go. But there was no sound
and the wandering little Night Breezes told him nothing. Lightfoot
followed the dainty footprints up the bank. There they disappeared,
for the ground was hard. Lightfoot paused, undecided which way
to go.</p>
