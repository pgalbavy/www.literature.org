<p>After Mr. Crow found that Farmer Green had put tar on his corn, Mr. Crow
was so angry that he flew for a good many miles before stopping. And
then, as he started to walk along the limb that lead to his house in the
tall elm, he noticed for the first time that he could hardly move his
right foot.
</p>
<p>He looked down and he was startled when he saw that his foot was many
times its usual size. Moreover, it did not look like a foot at all, being
a strange, huge, shapeless thing.
</p><p>Old Mr. Crow was alarmed. Never in all his life had he found himself in
such a plight. He stayed at home only long enough to tie his foot up in a
bandage, which made it look bigger than ever. And then he hurried off as
fast as he could fly to call upon Aunt Polly Woodchuck, who was said to
be an excellent doctor.
</p><p>Aunt Polly was at home. And since Mr. Crow could not crawl inside her
house, she received him in her dooryard.
</p><p>As soon as she looked at Mr. Crow's foot Aunt Polly Woodchuck threw up
both her hands.
</p><p>"You have gout!" she cried. "And it's the worst case I ever saw."
</p><p>That made Mr. Crow feel proud and happy.
</p><p>"What about a cure?" he inquired. "I shouldn't like to have my foot like
this always. If you could cure it in a week I would be satisfied. But I
want at least a week in which to show my foot to my friends."
</p><p>"You'll be lucky if you're better in a month," said Aunt Polly Woodchuck.
"You must be very careful about what you eat. You may have all the
ginseng and Jimson weed and elecampane that you wish. And drink plenty of
catnip tea! But until you're quite well again, don't touch corn,
grasshoppers, birds' eggs, field-mice, or elderberries. If you eat such
things your other foot may swell. And then you'd be unable to walk at
all."
</p><p>Mr. Crow was no longer happy.
</p><p>"Those are the things I like best--the last that you mentioned," he said.
"And the food you tell me I may have is exactly the kind I've never cared
for in the least. As for catnip tea, I can't swallow it!" he groaned.
"Haven't you some other remedy? Can't you give me a pill?"
</p><p>But Aunt Polly Woodehuck said there was no other way.
</p><p>"I never can remember what you've told me," Mr. Crow objected.
</p><p>"I can fix that," said Aunt Polly. And then she went into her house,
returning presently with a basket. From the basket she drew forth a
handful of herbs, which she gave to Mr. Crow.
</p><p>"Take these," she said, "and put them in your right-hand pocket. These
are what you may eat--a sample of each herb."
</p><p>Straightway she gave Mr. Crow two more handfuls of food.
</p><p>"And here," she continued, "here are things you mustn't eat. Put them in
your left-hand pocket. And at dinner time to-night you won't have the
least bit of trouble knowing what you're allowed to have."
</p><p>Mr. Crow thanked her politely. But he felt somewhat angry, just the same.
He saw that he was going to have a very unpleasant time. For if there was
one thing that Mr. Crow liked, it was good food--and plenty of it.
