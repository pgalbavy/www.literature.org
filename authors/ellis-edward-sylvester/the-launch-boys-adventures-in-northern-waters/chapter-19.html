<p>Standing in the darkness of the upper front room, stealthily
watching the mysterious stranger on the other side of the street
in the shadow of the elm, and knowing that burglars were at work
below stairs&mdash;the nerves of mother and daughter and of Alvin Landon
and Chester Haynes were on edge. Had they peered out of the window
less than half an hour earlier they would have seen the meeting
between the lookout and young Jim Buxton.</p>

<p>Mike Murphy had slipped so silently from among them that no one
was aware of his absence when the bumping and crash at the rear
were followed by exclamations and words that were not intelligible.
Mrs. Friestone uttered a faint cry and sank back on her chair.
Nora screamed and threw her arms about her mother's neck.</p>

<p>"They will kill us! What shall we do?" she wailed.</p>

<p>For the moment Alvin and Chester, startled almost as much as
their friends, were mystified. When Chester said:</p>

<p>"That sounds like Mike's voice. Hello, Mike, are you here with
us?"</p>

<p>The failure to receive a reply proved that Chester was right.
Their comrade had stolen off and was already in a "shindy" at
the rear of the store.</p>

<p>"He may need our help!" called Alvin, starting for the stairs,
with his chum at his heels. But Nora, who had heard the unguarded
words, called in wild distress:</p>

<p>"Don't leave us! Don't leave us!"</p>

<p>They stopped irresolute. They could not abandon the two, and
yet Mike's life might be in peril.</p>

<p>"Go back to them," whispered Chester. "There's no call for both
of us to stay."</p>

<p>"Better not go down yourself; you know you have no weapon. Let's
take a look."</p>

<p>First of all it was necessary to quiet the daughter and mother,
for one was as much terrified as the other. Alvin hastened into
the room.</p>

<p>"We will not leave you," he said, "but we wish to see what we
can from the kitchen window."</p>

<p>"Oh, you may fall out," moaned Nora, scarcely responsible for
what she said. Even in the crisis of a tragedy a vein of comedy
will sometimes intrude itself.</p>

<p>"Have no fear of that," replied Alvin. "I will hold Chester from
tumbling out and he will do the same for me. Pray, compose yourselves."</p>

<p>During this brief absence Chester had threaded his way past the
furniture in the darkness to the window, out of which he was gazing
on a most interesting moving picture which had vanished when Alvin
appeared at his elbow.</p>

<p>"It made my blood tingle," said Chester. "I was just in time
to see a man, who must have leaped out, running for life with
Mike in pursuit. He had that old gun in one hand&mdash;as if it could
prove of any earthly use to him."</p>

<p>"Where are they now?"</p>

<p>"The fellow, after leaping the fence, turned to the right and
disappeared among the shadows."</p>

<p>"With Mike still chasing him?"</p>

<p>"As hard as he could run, but you know he hasn't much speed."</p>

<p>"I wonder," whispered Alvin, "whether there are any more of them
downstairs."</p>

<p>They stepped noiselessly to the head of the steps and listened.
Everything was so quiet that they heard the ticking of the clock
on the wall of the store.</p>

<p>"I don't believe anyone is there. Let's take a closer look."</p>

<p>Alvin struck a match from his safe and led the way, thus saving
the two from the mishap that had overtaken their friend. They
were a trifle nervous when they stepped upon the lower floor,
Alvin maintaining the illumination by burning more matches. He
climbed upon the counter, and lighted the large oil lamp suspended
there for such purpose. Adjusting the wick to the highest point
it would stand without smoking, the two looked around.</p>

<p>What they saw completed the story that had already taken shape
in their own minds. The unbroken dark lantern lay on the floor
where it had fallen, the light having been extinguished. The raised
window showed by what avenue the burglar and Mike had left the
building, but what amazed the youths more than anything else was
the wide open door of the safe. Not a burglar's tool or device
was in sight, and the appearance of the lock and door without
a scratch showing proved that no part of the structure had been
tampered with. It was just as if Mrs. Friestone had manipulated
it&mdash;as she had done times without number.</p>

<p>"Whoever opened it must have known the combination. And how did
he learn it?"</p>

<p>Chester shook his head.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mrs. Friestone can guess. I'll ask her."</p>

<p>Going to the foot of the stairs, the young man called to the
woman just loudly enough for her to hear. He said the visitors
had left, but the door of the safe was open and it was advisable
for her to come down and take a look at things.</p>

<p>She timidly came down the steps, with Nora tremblingly clinging
to her skirts, ready to scream and dash back to the front of the
house on the first appearance of danger. But nothing occurred
to cause new alarm, and mother and daughter stared wonderingly
at the safe with its wide open door.</p>

<p>"Who did that?" asked the woman, in a faint voice.</p>

<p>"One of the burglars," replied Chester.</p>

<p>"How did he learn the combination?"</p>

<p>"That's the mystery; Alvin and I cannot guess. Was it known to
anyone besides yourself?"</p>

<p>"No; I changed it two days ago and did not even tell Nora. Not
another soul knew it&mdash;and look!"</p>

<p>She pointed to a bunch of keys, one of which was inserted in
the lock of the middle small drawer, with a half dozen others
dangling from the metal ring. It will be understood that while
the door of the safe was opened by means of a usual combination
of numbers, the interior was guarded by only a tiny lock and key.
This was more convenient, for, when the massive door was drawn
back, the little wooden drawers, even with a combination, would
not avail long against a burglar.</p>

<p>"They have taken the money!" gasped the widow.</p>

<p>"Let us see."</p>

<p>As Alvin spoke, he turned the key. The lock clicked and he drew
out the drawer. There lay the big sealed envelope with the two
thousand five hundred dollars intact within, while the stamps
and cash receipts of the day were neatly piled on the shelf beneath.</p>

<p>The astonishing truth was that the criminal had been interrupted
at the critical moment when he had succeeded in fitting a key
to the lock. Had Mike Murphy been the fraction of a minute later
in bursting upon the scene, he would have been too late. The robber
would have carried off nearly three thousand dollars.</p>

<p>"That's what I call the greatest luck that ever happened," said
Chester.</p>

<p>The discovery was as cheering as amazing. The large amount of
money had been saved by a hair's breadth. The woman clasped her
hands in thankfulness. Chester slowly shoved the steel door shut.</p>

<p>"Now try the combination," he said to Mrs. Friestone. "Chester
and I will turn our backs while you do so."</p>

<p>"And why will you do that?"</p>

<p>"So that we shall not learn the secret. If anything like this
happens again, you cannot say we did it."</p>

<p>She saw the smile on his face and knew he spoke in jest.</p>

<p>"It may be the lock was broken in some way," suggested Chester.</p>

<p>But it worked perfectly. The knob was turned forward till the
finger pointed to a number, then back and then forward again to
another numeral. It moved as smoothly as if the delicate mechanism
was oiled.</p>

<p>"Now open it," she said to the lads, her spirits rallying over
her good fortune. They shook their heads and Chester said:</p>

<p>"We might succeed, and that would be suspicious."</p>

<p>"Whether you noticed the combination or not, you surely did not
know what it was a little while ago. I acquit you of having any
understanding with the burglars."</p>

<p>"What's become of Mike?" asked Nora plaintively, speaking for
the first time. "I'm afraid something dreadful has happened to
him."</p>

<p>"He is probably still chasing the bad man," said Chester.</p>

<p>As if in answer to her wail a hasty tread was heard at that moment
and a bushy red head without a cap appeared at the window, as
if flung thither by the hand of a giant. The bright light within
the door told him the story.</p>

<p>"The top of the morning to ye all, for I jedge it's near morning,
as Tim Mulligan said after he had been slaaping fur two days and
nights. I hope ye are all well."</p>

<p>He began climbing through and was half inside when Nora dashed
forward and caught hold of his arm. It so disarranged his balance
that he tumbled on the floor, the rifle falling from his grasp.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad to see you, Mike! I was afraid those awful people
had killed you," said the happy girl. "Are you hurt?"</p>

<p>"Not worth speaking of; I think my neck is broke and me lift
leg fractured in two places, but niver mind."</p>

<p>Then the exuberant youth told his story, to which his friends
listened with breathless interest.</p>

<p>"Then you didn't catch the villain?" said Chester inquiringly.</p>

<p>"No, but I made it hot fur him, as me cousin said after chasing
the expriss train a couple of miles. He has longer legs than mesilf.
The next time I engage in a chase wid him I'll make sure his legs
is sawed off at the knees, so as to give me a chance. If I had
thought to have that done I'd brought the spalpeen back to ye."</p>

<p>"Well, you drove him off in the nick of time. He didn't get away
with a penny," said Alvin.</p>

<p>"But what was the maans he used to open that door? That's what
gits me&mdash;whisht!"</p>

<p>The report of a gun rang out on the stillness, and the friends
stared at one another. Before anyone could venture an explanation,
the sound of hurried footsteps told that someone was approaching.</p>
