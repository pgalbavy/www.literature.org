<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>That year, towards the breaking up of the south-west monsoon,
disquieting rumours reached Sambir.  Captain Ford, coming up to
Almayer's house for an evening's chat, brought late numbers of
the <em>Straits Times</em> giving the news of Acheen war and of
the unsuccessful Dutch expedition.  The Nakhodas of the rare trading
praus ascending the river paid visits to Lakamba, discussing with
that potentate the unsettled state of affairs, and wagged their
heads gravely over the recital of Orang Blanda exaction, severity,
and general tyranny, as exemplified in the total stoppage of gunpowder
trade and the rigorous visiting of all suspicious craft trading
in the straits of Macassar.  Even the loyal soul of Lakamba was
stirred into a state of inward discontent by the withdrawal of
his license for powder and by the abrupt confiscation of one hundred
and fifty barrels of that commodity by the gunboat <em>Princess
Amelia</em>, when, after a hazardous voyage, it had almost reached
the mouth of the river.  The unpleasant news was given him by
Reshid, who, after the unsuccessful issue of his matrimonial projects,
had made a long voyage amongst the islands for trading purposes;
had bought the powder for his friend, and was overhauled and deprived
of it on his return when actually congratulating himself on his
acuteness in avoiding detection.  Reshid's wrath was principally
directed against Almayer, whom he suspected of having notified
the Dutch authorities of the desultory warfare carried on by the
Arabs and the Rajah with the up-river Dyak tribes.</p>

<p>To Reshid's great surprise the Rajah received his complaints
very coldly, and showed no signs of vengeful disposition towards
the white man.  In truth, Lakamba knew very well that Almayer
was perfectly innocent of any meddling in state affairs; and besides,
his attitude towards that much persecuted individual was wholly
changed in consequence of a reconciliation effected between him
and his old enemy by Almayer's newlyfound friend, Dain Maroola.</p>

<p>Almayer had now a friend.  Shortly after Reshid's departure on
his commercial journey, Nina, drifting slowly with the tide in
the canoe on her return home after one of her solitary excursions,
heard in one of the small creeks a splashing, as if of heavy ropes
dropping in the water, and the prolonged song of Malay seamen
when some heavy pulling is to be done. Through the thick fringe
of bushes hiding the mouth of the creek she saw the tall spars
of some European-rigged sailing vessel overtopping the summits
of the Nipa palms.  A brig was being hauled out of the small creek
into the main stream.  The sun had set, and during the short moments
of twilight Nina saw the brig, aided by the evening breeze and
the flowing tide, head towards Sambir under her set foresail. 
The girl turned her canoe out of the main river into one of the
many narrow channels amongst the wooded islets, and paddled vigorously
over the black and sleepy backwaters towards Sambir.  Her canoe
brushed the water-palms, skirted the short spaces of muddy bank
where sedate alligators looked at her with lazy unconcern, and,
just as darkness was setting in, shot out into the broad junction
of the two main branches of the river, where the brig was already
at anchor with sails furled, yards squared, and decks seemingly
untenanted by any human being.  Nina had to cross the river and
pass pretty close to the brig in order to reach home on the low
promontory between the two branches of the Pantai.  Up both branches,
in the houses built on the banks and over the water, the lights
twinkled already, reflected in the still waters below.  The hum
of voices, the occasional cry of a child, the rapid and abruptly
interrupted roll of a wooden drum, together with some distant
hailing in the darkness by the returning fishermen, reached her
over the broad expanse of the river.  She hesitated a little before
crossing, the sight of such an unusual object as an European-rigged
vessel causing her some uneasiness, but the river in its wide
expansion was dark enough to render a small canoe invisible. She
urged her small craft with swift strokes of her paddle, kneeling
in the bottom and bending forward to catch any suspicious sound
while she steered towards the little jetty of Lingard and Co.,
to which the strong light of the paraffin lamp shining on the
whitewashed verandah of Almayer's bungalow served as a convenient
guide.  The jetty itself, under the shadow of the bank overgrown
by drooping bushes, was hidden in darkness.  Before even she could
see it she heard the hollow bumping of a large boat against its
rotten posts, and heard also the murmur of whispered conversation
in that boat whose white paint and great dimensions, faintly visible
on nearer approach, made her rightly guess that it belonged to
the brig just anchored.  Stopping her course by a rapid motion
of her paddle, with another swift stroke she sent it whirling
away from the wharf and steered for a little rivulet which gave
access to the back courtyard of the house.  She landed at the
muddy head of the creek and made her way towards the house over
the trodden grass of the courtyard.  To the left, from the cooking
shed, shone a red glare through the banana plantation she skirted,
and the noise of feminine laughter reached her from there in the
silent evening.  She rightly judged her mother was not near, laughter
and Mrs. Almayer not being close neighbours.  She must be in the
house, thought Nina, as she ran lightly up the inclined plane
of shaky planks leading to the back door of the narrow passage
dividing the house in two.  Outside the doorway, in the black
shadow, stood the faithful Ali.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" asked Nina.</p>

<p>"A great Malay man has come," answered Ali, in a tone of suppressed
excitement.  "He is a rich man.  There are six men with lances. 
Real Soldat, you understand.  And his dress is very brave.  I
have seen his dress.  It shines!  What jewels!  Don't go there,
Mem Nina.  Tuan said not; but the old Mem is gone.  Tuan will
be angry.  Merciful Allah! what jewels that man has got!"</p>

<p>Nina slipped past the outstretched hand of the slave into the
dark passage where, in the crimson glow of the hanging curtain,
close by its other end, she could see a small dark form crouching
near the wall.  Her mother was feasting her eyes and ears with
what was taking place on the front verandah, and Nina approached
to take her share in the rare pleasure of some novelty.  She was
met by her mother's extended arm and by a low murmured warning
not to make a noise.</p>

<p>"Have you seen them, mother?" asked Nina, in a breathless whisper.</p>

<p>Mrs. Almayer turned her face towards the girl, and her sunken
eyes shone strangely in the red half-light of the passage.</p>

<p>"I saw him," she said, in an almost inaudible tone, pressing
her daughter's hand with her bony fingers.  "A great Rajah has
come to Sambir&mdash;a Son of Heaven," muttered the old woman to herself. 
"Go away, girl!"</p>

<p>The two women stood close to the curtain, Nina wishing to approach
the rent in the stuff, and her mother defending the position with
angry obstinacy.  On the other side there was a lull in the conversation,
but the breathing of several men, the occasional light tinkling
of some ornaments, the clink of metal scabbards, or of brass siri-vessels
passed from hand to hand, was audible during the short pause. 
The women struggled silently, when there was a shuffling noise
and the shadow of Almayer's burly form fell on the curtain.</p>

<p>The women ceased struggling and remained motionless.  Almayer
had stood up to answer his guest, turning his back to the doorway,
unaware of what was going on on the other side.  He spoke in a
tone of regretful irritation.</p>

<p>"You have come to the wrong house, Tuan Maroola, if you want
to trade as you say.  I was a trader once, not now, whatever you
may have heard about me in Macassar.  And if you want anything,
you will not find it here; I have nothing to give, and want nothing
myself.  You should go to the Rajah here; you can see in the daytime
his houses across the river, there, where those fires are burning
on the shore.  He will help you and trade with you.  Or, better
still, go to the Arabs over there," he went on bitterly, pointing
with his hand towards the houses of Sambir. "Abdulla is the man
you want.  There is nothing he would not buy, and there is nothing
he would not sell; believe me, I know him well."</p>

<p>He waited for an answer a short time, then added&mdash;</p>

<p>"All that I have said is true, and there is nothing more."</p>

<p>Nina, held back by her mother, heard a soft voice reply with
a calm evenness of intonation peculiar to the better class Malays&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who would doubt a white Tuan's words?  A man seeks his friends
where his heart tells him.  Is this not true also?  I have come,
although so late, for I have something to say which you may be
glad to hear.  To-morrow I will go to the Sultan; a trader wants
the friendship of great men.  Then I shall return here to speak
serious words, if Tuan permits.  I shall not go to the Arabs;
their lies are very great!  What are they?  Chelakka!"</p>

<p>Almayer's voice sounded a little more pleasantly in reply.</p>

<p>"Well, as you like.  I can hear you to-morrow at any time if
you have anything to say.  Bah!  After you have seen the Sultan
Lakamba you will not want to return here, Inchi Dain.  You will
see.  Only mind, I will have nothing to do with Lakamba.  You
may tell him so.  What is your business with me, after all?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow we talk, Tuan, now I know you," answered the Malay. 
"I speak English a little, so we can talk and nobody will understand,
and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>He interrupted himself suddenly, asking surprised, "What's that
noise, Tuan?"</p>

<p>Almayer had also heard the increasing noise of the scuffle recommenced
on the women's side of the curtain.  Evidently Nina's strong curiosity
was on the point of overcoming Mrs. Almayer's exalted sense of
social proprieties.  Hard breathing was distinctly audible, and
the curtain shook during the contest, which was mainly physical,
although Mrs. Almayer's voice was heard in angry remonstrance
with its usual want of strictly logical reasoning, but with the
well-known richness of invective.</p>

<p>"You shameless woman!  Are you a slave?" shouted shrilly the
irate matron.  "Veil your face, abandoned wretch!  You white snake,
I will not let you!"</p>

<p>Almayer's face expressed annoyance and also doubt as to the advisability
of interfering between mother and daughter.  He glanced at his
Malay visitor, who was waiting silently for the end of the uproar
in an attitude of amused expectation, and waving his hand contemptuously
he murmured&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is nothing.  Some women."</p>

<p>The Malay nodded his head gravely, and his face assumed an expression
of serene indifference, as etiquette demanded after such an explanation. 
The contest was ended behind the curtain, and evidently the younger
will had its way, for the rapid shuffle and click of Mrs. Almayer's
high-heeled sandals died away in the distance.  The tranquillised
master of the house was going to resume the conversation when,
struck by an unexpected change in the expression of his guest's
countenance, he turned his head and saw Nina standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>After Mrs. Almayer's retreat from the field of battle, Nina,
with a contemptuous exclamation, "It's only a trader," had lifted
the conquered curtain and now stood in full light, framed in the
dark background on the passage, her lips slightly parted, her
hair in disorder after the exertion, the angry gleam not yet faded
out of her glorious and sparkling eyes.  She took in at a glance
the group of white-clad lancemen standing motionless in the shadow
of the far-off end of the verandah, and her gaze rested curiously
on the chief of that imposing <em>cortege</em>.  He stood, almost
facing her, a little on one side, and struck by the beauty of
the unexpected apparition had bent low, elevating his joint hands
above his head in a sign of respect accorded by Malays only to
the great of this earth.  The crude light of the lamp shone on
the gold embroidery of his black silk jacket, broke in a thousand
sparkling rays on the jewelled hilt of his kriss protruding from
under the many folds of the red sarong gathered into a sash round
his waist, and played on the precious stones of the many rings
on his dark fingers.  He straightened himself up quickly after
the low bow, putting his hand with a graceful ease on the hilt
of his heavy short sword ornamented with brilliantly dyed fringes
of horsehair.  Nina, hesitating on the threshold, saw an erect
lithe figure of medium height with a breadth of shoulder suggesting
great power.  Under the folds of a blue turban, whose fringed
ends hung gracefully over the left shoulder, was a face full of
determination and expressing a reckless good-humour, not devoid,
however, of some dignity.  The squareness of lower jaw, the full
red lips, the mobile nostrils, and the proud carriage of the head
gave the impression of a being half-savage, untamed, perhaps cruel,
and corrected the liquid softness of the almost feminine eye,
that general characteristic of the race.  Now, the first surprise
over, Nina saw those eyes fixed upon her with such an uncontrolled
expression of admiration and desire that she felt a hitherto unknown
feeling of shyness, mixed with alarm and some delight, enter and
penetrate her whole being.</p>

<p>Confused by those unusual sensations she stopped in the doorway
and instinctively drew the lower part of the curtain across her
face, leaving only half a rounded cheek, a stray tress, and one
eye exposed, wherewith to contemplate the gorgeous and bold being
so unlike in appearance to the rare specimens of traders she had
seen before on that same verandah.</p>

<p>Dain Maroola, dazzled by the unexpected vision, forgot the confused
Almayer, forgot his brig, his escort staring in open-mouthed admiration,
the object of his visit and all things else, in his overpowering
desire to prolong the contemplation of so much loveliness met
so suddenly in such an unlikely place&mdash;as he thought.</p>

<p>"It is my daughter," said Almayer, in an embarrassed manner. 
"It is of no consequence.  White women have their customs, as
you know Tuan, having travelled much, as you say.  However, it
is late; we will finish our talk to-morrow."</p>

<p>Dain bent low trying to convey in a last glance towards the girl
the bold expression of his overwhelming admiration.  The next
minute he was shaking Almayer's hand with grave courtesy, his
face wearing a look of stolid unconcern as to any feminine presence. 
His men filed off, and he followed them quickly, closely attended
by a thick-set, savage-looking Sumatrese he had introduced before
as the commander of his brig.  Nina walked to the balustrade of
the verandah and saw the sheen of moonlight on the steel spear-heads
and heard the rhythmic jingle of brass anklets as the men moved
in single file towards the jetty.  The boat shoved off after a
little while, looming large in the full light of the moon, a black
shapeless mass in the slight haze hanging over the water.  Nina
fancied she could distinguish the graceful figure of the trader
standing erect in the stern sheets, but in a little while all
the outlines got blurred, confused, and soon disappeared in the
folds of white vapour shrouding the middle of the river.</p>

<p>Almayer had approached his daughter, and leaning with both arms
over the rail, was looking moodily down on the heap of rubbish
and broken bottles at the foot of the verandah.</p>

<p>"What was all that noise just now?" he growled peevishly, without
looking up.  "Confound you and your mother!  What did she want? 
What did you come out for?"</p>

<p>"She did not want to let me come out," said Nina.  "She is angry. 
She says the man just gone is some Rajah.  I think she is right
now."</p>

<p>"I believe all you women are crazy," snarled Almayer.  "What's
that to you, to her, to anybody?  The man wants to collect trepang
and birds' nests on the islands.  He told me so, that Rajah of
yours.  He will come to-morrow.  I want you both to keep away
from the house, and let me attend to my business in peace."</p>

<p>Dain Maroola came the next day and had a long conversation with
Almayer. This was the beginning of a close and friendly intercourse
which, at first, was much remarked in Sambir, till the population
got used to the frequent sight of many fires burning in Almayer's
campong, where Maroola's men were warming themselves during the
cold nights of the northeast monsoon, while their master had long
conferences with the Tuan Putih&mdash;as they styled Almayer amongst
themselves.  Great was the curiosity in Sambir on the subject
of the new trader.  Had he seen the Sultan?  What did the Sultan
say?  Had he given any presents?  What would he sell?  What would
he buy?  Those were the questions broached eagerly by the inhabitants
of bamboo houses built over the river.  Even in more substantial
buildings, in Abdulla's house, in the residences of principal
traders, Arab, Chinese, and Bugis, the excitement ran high, and
lasted many days.  With inborn suspicion they would not believe
the simple account of himself the young trader was always ready
to give.  Yet it had all the appearance of truth.  He said he
was a trader, and sold rice.  He did not want to buy gutta-percha
or beeswax, because he intended to employ his numerous crew in
collecting trepang on the coral reefs outside the river, and also
in seeking for bird's nests on the mainland.  Those two articles
he professed himself ready to buy if there were any to be obtained
in that way.  He said he was from Bali, and a Brahmin, which last
statement he made good by refusing all food during his often repeated
visits to Lakamba's and Almayer's houses.  To Lakamba he went
generally at night and had long audiences.  Babalatchi, who was
always a third party at those meetings of potentate and trader,
knew how to resist all attempts on the part of the curious to
ascertain the subject of so many long talks.  When questioned
with languid courtesy by the grave Abdulla he sought refuge in
a vacant stare of his one eye, and in the affectation of extreme
simplicity.</p>

<p>"I am only my master's slave," murmured Babalatchi, in a hesitating
manner.  Then as if making up his mind suddenly for a reckless
confidence he would inform Abdulla of some transaction in rice,
repeating the words, "A hundred big bags the Sultan bought; a
hundred, Tuan!" in a tone of mysterious solemnity.  Abdulla, firmly
persuaded of the existence of some more important dealings, received,
however, the information with all the signs of respectful astonishment. 
And the two would separate, the Arab cursing inwardly the wily
dog, while Babalatchi went on his way walking on the dusty path,
his body swaying, his chin with its few grey hairs pushed forward,
resembling an inquisitive goat bent on some unlawful expedition. 
Attentive eyes watched his movements.  Jim-Eng, descrying Babalatchi
far away, would shake off the stupor of an habitual opium smoker
and, tottering on to the middle of the road, would await the approach
of that important person, ready with hospitable invitation.  But
Babalatchi's discretion was proof even against the combined assaults
of good fellowship and of strong gin generously administered by
the openhearted Chinaman.  Jim-Eng, owning himself beaten, was
left uninformed with the empty bottle, and gazed sadly after the
departing form of the statesman of Sambir pursuing his devious
and unsteady way, which, as usual, led him to Almayer's compound. 
Ever since a reconciliation had been effected by Dain Maroola
between his white friend and the Rajah, the one-eyed diplomatist
had again become a frequent guest in the Dutchman's house.  To
Almayer's great disgust he was to be seen there at all times,
strolling about in an abstracted kind of way on the verandah,
skulking in the passages, or else popping round unexpected corners,
always willing to engage Mrs. Almayer in confidential conversation. 
He was very shy of the master himself, as if suspicious that the
pent-up feelings of the white man towards his person might find
vent in a sudden kick.  But the cooking shed was his favourite
place, and he became an habitual guest there, squatting for hours
amongst the busy women, with his chin resting on his knees, his
lean arms clasped round his legs, and his one eye roving uneasily&mdash;the
very picture of watchful ugliness.  Almayer wanted more than once
to complain to Lakamba of his Prime Minister's intrusion, but
Dain dissuaded him.  "We cannot say a word here that he does not
hear," growled Almayer.</p>

<p>"Then come and talk on board the brig," retorted Dain, with a
quiet smile.  "It is good to let the man come here.  Lakamba thinks
he knows much.  Perhaps the Sultan thinks I want to run away. 
Better let the oneeyed crocodile sun himself in your campong,
Tuan."</p>

<p>And Almayer assented unwillingly muttering vague threats of personal
violence, while he eyed malevolently the aged statesman sitting
with quiet obstinacy by his domestic rice-pot.</p>
