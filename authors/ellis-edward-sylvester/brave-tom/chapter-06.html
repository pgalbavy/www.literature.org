<p>Tom Gordon could not be blamed for failing to note several suggestive
occurrences during this memorable visit to Briggsville.</p>

<p>Seated on the porch of the hotel, while he was talking to the
group of young persons and acquaintances, were two strangers,
whose dilapidated dress, frowzy heads, and surly faces, showed
they belonged to that pestiferous class of vagrants known as tramps.
They sat apart, after taking a drink in the bar-room, and with
scowling but interested looks listened to the chatter going on
around them. It did not take them long to catch the drift of matters.
They talked together in low tones, with furtive glances at the
young hero, and kept their places, with a few muttered remarks
that no one else could catch, while Tom was inside.</p>

<p>When the smiling lad reappeared, his friends besieged him with
inquiries.</p>

<p>"Did he give you the money, Tom? How much is it?"</p>

<p>Being a sturdy boy, Tom naturally did not wish to appear too
much elated over his good fortune.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, with an assumption of indifference; "he paid
me the hundred dollars like a gentleman, and I've got it in my
pocket."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with so much money?" asked a mischievous
acquaintance; "buy a farm, or go in partnership with Vanderbilt?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to give every cent of it to my mother," replied Tom,
with a compression of his fine lips and a flash of his eye.</p>

<p>"That's right!" commented an elderly gentleman; "you couldn't
put it into safer hands, and I mean that for all of you youngsters."</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that the two tramps rose to their feet,
and slouched down the road in the direction of Tom Gordon's home.
In the flurry of the moment no one noticed their departure, which
indeed might not have attracted attention at any time.</p>

<p>"You've got a loaded gun in your house?" was the inquiring remark
of the same gentleman.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; we always keep one. I fired at the tiger with it,
but I didn't hurt him much," remarked Tom with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, tigers aren't the only creatures you've got to look out
for in these times. There are plenty of people that would break
into your house and murder you and your mother and aunt for the
sake of that money."</p>

<p>Tom blanched a little at these words, and one of the bystanders
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't think we have such people about here, Uncle Jed."</p>

<p>"I hope not, but you can't be too careful; I've been robbed myself
when I hadn't any more thought of it than that boy there."</p>

<p>Had Tom Gordon been a few years older or younger he would have
acted differently; that is to say he would have returned home
without delay. But he did not wish to appear frightened by the
words of the old gentleman; and, though he was eager to hurry
home to his mother and aunt with the good news, he remained talking
with his friends and trying to act as though he had forgotten
about his great fortune, until the long summer day ended and twilight
began closing in. Then when he started, he looked around to see
whether any one was going in the same direction. He would have
been glad of company, but it so happened that he set out alone
in the gathering gloom to walk the mile that must be passed before
he could reach his home.</p>

<p>"I wish Uncle Jed hadn't said what he did," he mused, when fairly
beyond the town, "it makes me feel kind of pokerish; why didn't
I think to bring my gun along? If the folks he talks about would
rob our house they would stop me on the road and take the money
from me."</p>

<p>He walked faster as the darkness increased, for the moon would
not rise for some time to come, glanced often behind him, and
essayed a timid whistle. He soon ceased this, however, for it
only increased his uneasiness. Every minute or two he pressed
one of his hands against his breast to make sure the precious
package was there. Then he glanced back again in the gloom, and
started when he fancied he saw a man following him. But it was
only fancy, and he increased his pace, wondering why the mile
seemed longer than he had ever known it before.</p>

<p>The rattle of a wagon caused him almost to leap from his feet.</p>

<p>"That's lucky!" he exclaimed; "I will get the man to let me ride,
and then no one will dare disturb me."</p>

<p>But it proved that the wagon was coming from the direction of
his home, so it could not be turned to account. He watched it
as it came nearer. An old gentleman sat on the front seat of the
open vehicle which was jolting along at an easy rate. It was too
dark to see the driver's features plainly, but Tom believed he
knew him and called out a greeting. The response showed he was
right as to the identity of the individual.</p>

<p>Two-thirds of the way home came the most trying ordeal. The lad
was obliged to follow quite a stretch of road where there was
woods on both sides. This deepened the gloom, for the highway
was so narrow that it was completely shadowed.</p>

<p>"If any robbers are waiting for me," he mused, "it will be in
them woods."</p>

<p>He hesitated on the border of the shadows, meditating whether
he could not reach home by some other course; but the forest,
originally one that covered several hundred acres, was bisected
by the highway, and the detour would be long. Still he decided
to try it, for, somehow or other, the conviction was strong with
him that danger lurked among the shadows. He turned about to retrace
his steps for a short way, before leaving the road, when he stopped
short, hardly repressing a gasp of affright.</p>

<p>He saw the unmistakable outlines of a man in the gloom, only
a short distance behind him. Afraid to meet him face to face,
Tom turned back and resumed his walk along the highway.</p>

<p>"When I get along a little farther," was his thought, "I'll slip
over the fence among the trees and dodge him."</p>

<p>He began walking fast, continually glancing over his shoulder.
His alarm increased upon discovering that the man had also quickened
his footsteps, so that instead of holding his place, the pursuer,
as he may be considered, was gaining.</p>

<p>The fact that not the slightest sound disturbed the stillness
added to the oppression of the situation. The lad was on the point
of breaking into a run, when the man, who was one of the tramps
before referred to, called out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hold on there, sonny! don't be in such a hurry."</p>

<p>This salutation was not calculated to soothe Tom's agitation,
and without any reply he started on a loping trot, still keeping
his attention to the rear, and prepared to break into a dead run
the moment it became necessary. He was fleet of foot, and believed
he could make the fellow hustle.</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear me, sonny? If you don't want to get shot, stop!"</p>

<p>Tom had no wish to be shot, nor did he mean to have the company
of the rascal who was bent on intruding upon him.</p>

<p>"Catch me if you can," he muttered, breaking into a swifter pace;
"I'm glad it's night so I'll have a chance to hide from you"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hold on there! what's your hurry, younker?"</p>

<p>The boy almost sank to the ground, for this startling hail came
not from the rear, but from the front. Stopping short, he saw
a burly fellow, standing within ten feet of him in the middle
of the road, so nigh indeed, that, despite the darkness, Tom had
no earthly chance of eluding him, as he might have done had he
detected his presence a moment sooner.</p>

<p>Rallying with a supreme effort, he addressed the one nearest
him.</p>

<p>"What do you want, that you stop me this way?"</p>

<p>"What do I want?" repeated the tramp with a chuckle, "that's
good; why I want to make the acquaintance of a purty young man
like you. What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Tom Gordon," promptly replied the boy, seeing nothing to be
gained by hiding his identity.</p>

<p>"I'm Count De Buffer, travelling incog. just now, 'cause you
see I don't want the Americans to make so much fuss over me; I
have enough of that at home, where they're not such tuft hunters
as here. Glad to know you, Tom," added the tramp, extending his
hand.</p>

<p>The boy with some hesitation accepted the grimy palm which almost
crushed his own.</p>

<p>"This is my friend Duke De Sassy," said the "count," as the other
came up; "him and me have got tired of the frivolities of court
life, and are making a tower through America studying its institutions,
and doing the country."</p>

<p>"This ere young man didn't seem to care for my company," remarked
the last arrival; "for I called to him two or three times, but
then, he couldn't have knowed that it was a real live dook he
was treating that way, so I forgive him."</p>

<p>"The truth is," added the count, "we're down on our luck just
now, and would like you to accommodate us with a trifle of a loan."</p>

<p>The tramps placed themselves while talking so as to forestall
any attempt on the part of the lad to break away.</p>

<p>"I haven't any money to lend you," sturdily answered Tom.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you have no funds in your exchequer?" continued
the count; "'cause if you haven't, of course we don't want anything
to do with you."</p>

<p>It flashed upon Tom that he had only to speak an untruth to free
himself of the presence of these miscreants. Would it be a sin
for him to say he had no money with him?</p>

<p>Only for an instant did the temptation linger. His mother had
taught him that a lie was never justifiable under any circumstances.</p>

<p>"I did not say I had no money," he said, "but that I had none
to lend you."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's a different matter. I'm afeard, Duke," he continued,
addressing his companion, "that we shall be under the necessity
of making a forced loan; how does the proposition strike you?"</p>

<p>"I'm convinced we shall be reduced to that painful necessity.
If I'm not mistook, this young gentleman was paid a hundred dollars
this afternoon for his bravery in throwing a royal Bengal tiger
over his shoulder and bringing him back to the circus, from which
erstwhile the animal strayed."</p>

<p>Poor Tom saw it was all up with him. These wretches must have
known about the reward from the moment he received it. They had
planned the robbery, and he had walked straight into the trap
set for him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have a hundred dollars given to me for helping to catch
the tiger; I was taking it home to my mother."</p>

<p>"That's a good boy," commented the count; "always think of your
mother, for the market isn't overstocked with first-class mothers.
But bear in mind, sonny, that we're only borering this for sixty
days, and we'll give you ten per cent interest&mdash;that's our style
of doing bus'ness, eh, Duke?"</p>

<p>"Well, if I must, I must," said Tom hopelessly, making a move
of his hand as if to draw the money from his trousers pocket.</p>

<p>"That's right, allers take things philosophically, and be ready
to extend a helping hand to them as"&mdash;</p>

<p>The count had got thus far in his observations, when the boy
darted to one side, and made a desperate attempt to pass them
and reach the fence on his right.</p>

<p>He came very nigh succeeding too. In fact, he did get to the
fence, and was in the act of clambering over, when he was seized
in the iron grip of Count De Buffer, who was angered at the narrow
escape of the youth making off with the funds.</p>

<p>"If you try anything like that agin, I'll kill you!" he said,
choking and shaking the boy; "we mean bus'ness, young man, and
don't you forget it!"</p>

<p>Tom still struggled furiously, and pulled so hard that all three
moved several paces along the highway. Nor did he cease his resistance
until he had been struck several cruel blows.</p>

<p>"Now fork over them funds!" commanded the count, when the panting
lad was exhausted.</p>

<p>"I sha'n't do it!" was the sturdy reply.</p>

<p>"Very well; then we'll do it for you."</p>

<p>The lad made no resistance, and the tramps searched him thoroughly
from head to foot. Not a penny was found on him.</p>

<p>"We ought to break your head for that trick," said the duke,
"and if it had done you any good we'd do so; but we understand
it. You flung the money away when you made a rush for the fence."</p>

<p>"If I did," was the defiant response of the boy, "all you've
got to do is to find it again."</p>

<p>"We'll soon do that; hold him fast till I get it, and then we'll
settle with him."</p>

<p>The tousled scamp shuffled off to the side of the highway to
search for the package, which he was convinced had been thrown
there at the time their prisoner made his dash for freedom.</p>

<p>"That'll prove bad bus'ness for you," growled the duke, who was
the custodian of Tom.</p>

<p>"Not any worse than if you had got it," replied the youth, who
was thoroughly roused by his brutal treatment. He had been struck
several times, but could not believe the ruffians would dare put
him to death in revenge for the loss of the money, that is, provided
they did recover it.</p>

<p>"Haven't you found it, Dick?" called the duke, forgetting the
title of his comrade.</p>

<p>"No, confound it! I don't know where to look for it."</p>

<p>"Where did you fling it?" demanded the duke of his captive.</p>

<p>"I shall not tell you; you may kill me first."</p>

<p>"Very well; take that!"</p>

<p>But Tom managed to dodge the blow, and, by a quick leap, freed
himself of the grip of his captor. The next minute he was off
like a deer.</p>

<p>Possibly the tramp might have overtaken him, had he made the
effort; but he chose to let him go while he joined his friend
in hunting for the money.</p>

<p>They kept up the search for hours, and were then, obliged to
give it up. Afraid that the boy, who must have reached home long
before, would bring friends back, the tramps took their departure
while the opportunity was theirs, and were seen no more.</p>

<p>Tom Gordon did a brave thing. The moment he discovered he was
not pursued, he hid himself at the side of the road, and waited
till the scamps departed. Then, when the moon had risen, he stole
back again, and, remembering quite well where he had thrown the
package of money, found it with little difficulty, and reaching
home without further incident, told his stirring experience to
his mother and aunt.</p>
