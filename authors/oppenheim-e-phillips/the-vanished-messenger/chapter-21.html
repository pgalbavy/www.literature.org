<P>
"To-day," Hamel declared, as he stood at the sideboard the following
morning at breakfast-time and helped himself to bacon and eggs, "I
am positively going to begin reading.  I have a case full of books
down at the Tower which I haven't unpacked yet."
<P>
Esther made a little grimace.
<P>
"Look at the sunshine," she said.  "There isn't a breath of wind,
either.  I think to-day that I could play from the men's tees."
<P>
Hamel sighed as he returned to his place.
<P>
"My good intentions are already half dissipated," he admitted.
<P>
She laughed.
<P>
"How can we attack the other half?" she asked.
<P>
Gerald, who was also on his way to the sideboard, suddenly stopped.
<P>
"Hullo!" he exclaimed, looking out of the window.  "Who's going
away this morning, I wonder?   There's the Rolls-Royce at the door."
<P>
Hamel, too, rose once more to his feet.  The two exchanged swift
glances.  Moved by a common thought, they both started for the door,
only to find it suddenly opened before them.  Mr. Fentolin glided
into the room.
<P>
"Uncle!" Gerald exclaimed.
<P>
Mr. Fentolin glanced keenly around the room.
<P>
"Good morning, everybody," he said.  "My appearance at this hour of
the morning naturally surprises you.  As a matter of fact, I have
been up for quite a long time.  Esther dear, give me some coffee,
will you, and be sure that it is hot.  If any of you want to say
good-by to Mr. John P. Dunster, you'd better hurry out."
<P>
"You mean that he is going?" Hamel asked incredulously.
<P>
"He is going," Mr. Fentolin admitted.  "I wash my hands of the man.
He has given us an infinite amount of trouble, has monopolised
Doctor Sarson when he ought to have been attending upon me - a
little more hot milk, if you please, Esther - and now, although he
really is not fit to leave his room, he insists upon hurrying off
to keep an appointment somewhere on the Continent.  The little
operation we spoke of last night was successful, as Doctor Sarson
prophesied, and Mr. Dunster was quite conscious and able to sit up
early this morning.  We telephoned at six o'clock to Norwich for a
surgeon, who is now on his way over here, but he will not wait even
to see him.  What can you do with a man so obstinate!"
<P>
Neither Hamel nor Gerald had resumed their places.  The former,
after a moment's hesitation, turned towards the door.
<P>
"I think," he said, "that I should like to see the last of Mr.
Dunster."
<P>
"Pray do," Mr. Fentolin begged.  "I have said good-by to him myself,
and all that I hope is that next time you offer a wayfarer the
hospitality of St. David's Hall, Gerald, he may be a more tractable
person.  This morning I shall give myself a treat.  I shall eat an
old-fashioned English breakfast.  Close the door after you, if you
please, Gerald."
<P>
Hamel, with Gerald by his side, hurried out into the hall.  Just
as they crossed the threshold they saw Mr. Dunster, wrapped from
head to foot in his long ulster, a soft hat upon his head and one
of Mr. Fentolin's cigars in his mouth, step from the bottom
stair into the hall and make his way with somewhat uncertain
footsteps towards the front door.  Doctor Sarson walked on one
side, and Meekins held him by the arm.  He glanced towards Gerald
and his companion and waved the hand which held his cigar.
<P>
"So long, my young friend!" he exclaimed.  You see, I've got them
to let me make a start.  Next time we go about the country in a
saloon car together, I hope we'll have better luck.  Say, but I'm
groggy about the knees!"
<P>
"You'd better save your breath," Doctor Sarson advised him grimly.
"You haven't any to spare now, and you'll want more than you have
before you get to the end of your journey.  Carefully down the
steps, mind."
<P>
They helped him into the car.  Hamel and Gerald stood under the
great stone portico, watching.
<P>
"Well, I'm jiggered!" the boy exclaimed, under his breath.
<P>
Hamel was watching the proceedings with a puzzled frown.  To his
surprise, neither Doctor Sarson nor Meekins were accompanying the
departing man.
<P>
"He's off, right enough," Hamel declared, as the car glided away.
"Do you understand it?  I don't."
<P>
Gerald did not speak for several moments.  His eyes were still fixed
upon the back of the disappearing car.  Then he turned towards Hamel.
<P>
"There isn't much," he said softly, "that Mr. Fentolin doesn't know.
If that detective was really on his way here, there wasn't any
chance of keeping Mr. Dunster to himself.  You see, the whole story
is common property.  And yet, there's something about the affair
that bothers me."
<P>
"And me," Hamel admitted, watching the car until it became a speck
in the distance.
<P>
"He was fairly well cornered," Gerald concluded, as they made their
way back to the dining-room, "but it isn't like him to let go of
anything so easily."
<P>
"So you've seen the last of our guest," Mr. Fentolin remarked, as 
amel and Gerald re-entered the dining-room.  "A queer fellow - almost
a new type to me.  Dogged and industrious, I should think.  He hadn't
the least right to travel, you know, and I think so long as we had
taken the trouble to telephone to Norwich, he might have waited to
see the physician.  Sarson was very angry about it, but what can you
do with these fellows who are never ill?  They scarcely know what
physical disability means.  Well, Mr. Hamel, and how are you goin
to amuse yourself to-day?"
<P>
"I had thought of commencing some reading I brought with me," Hamel
replied, "but Miss Esther has challenged me to another game of golf."
<P>
"Excellent!" Mr. Fentolin declared.  "It is very kind of you indeed,
Mr. Hamel.  It is always a matter of regret for me that society in
these parts is so restricted.  My nephew and niece have little
opportunity for enjoying themselves.  Play golf with Mr. Hamel, by
all means, my dear child," he continued, turning to his niece.  "Make
the most of this glorious spring weather.  And what about you, Gerald?
What are you doing to-day?"
<P>
"I haven't made up my mind yet, sir," the boy replied.
<P>
Mr. Fentolin sighed.
<P>
"Always that lack of initiative," he remarked.  "A lack of initiative
is one of your worst faults, I am afraid, dear Gerald."
<P>
The boy looked up quickly.  For a moment it seemed as though he were
about to make a fierce reply.  He met Mr. Fentolin's steady gaze,
however, and the words died away upon his lips.
<P>
"I rather thought," he said, "of going into Norwich, if you could
spare me.  Captain Holt has asked me to lunch at the Barracks."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin shook his head gently.
<P>
"It is most unfortunate," he declared.  "I have a commission for
you later in the day."
<P>
Gerald continued his breakfast in silence.  He bent over his plate
so that his face was almost invisible.  Mr. Fentolin was peeling a
peach.  A servant entered the room.
<P>
"Lieutenant Godfrey, sir," he announced.
<P>
They all looked up.  A trim, clean-shaven, hard-featured young man
in naval uniform was standing upon the threshold.  He bowed to
Esther.
<P>
"Very sorry to intrude, sir, at this hour of the morning," he said
briskly.  "Lieutenant Godfrey, my name.  I am flag lieutenant of
the Britannia.  You can't see her, but she's not fifty miles off at
this minute.  I landed at Sheringham this morning, hired a car and
made the best of my way here.  Message from the Admiral, sir."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin smiled genially.
<P>
"We are delighted to see you, Lieutenant Godfrey," he said.  "Have
some breakfast."
<P>
"You are very good, sir," the officer answered.  "Business first.
I'll breakfast afterwards, with pleasure, if I may.  The Admiral's
compliments, and he would take it as a favour if you would haul
down your wireless for a few days."
<P>
"Had down my wireless," Mr. Fentolin repeated slowly.
<P>
"We are doing a lot of manoeuvring within range of you, and likely
to do a bit more," the young man explained.  "You are catching up
our messages all the time.  Of course, we know they're quite safe
with you, but things get about.  As yours is only a private
installation, we'd like you, if you don't mind, sir, to shut up
shop for a few days."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin seemed puzzled.
<P>
"But, my dear sir," he protested, "we are not at war, are we?"
<P>
"Not yet," the young officer replied, "but God knows when we shall
be!  We are under sealed or ders, anyway, and we don't want any
risk of our plans leaking out.  That's why we want your wireless
disconnected." 
<P>
"You need say no more," Mr. Fentolin assured him.  "The matter is
already arranged.  Esther, let me present Lieutenant Godfrey - my
niece, Miss Fentolin; Mr. Gerald Fentolin, my nephew; Mr. Hamel, a
guest.  See that Lieutenant Godfrey has some breakfast, Gerald.  I
will go myself and see my Marconi operator."
<P>
"Awfully good of you, sir," the young man declared, "and I am sure
we are very sorry to trouble you.  In a week or two's time you can
go into business again as much as you like.  It's only while we
are fiddling around here that the Admiral's jumpy about things.
May my man have a cup of coffee, sir?  I'd like to be on the way
back in a quarter of an hour."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin halted his chair by the side of the bell, and rang it.
<P>
"Pray make use of my house as your own, sir," he said gravely.
"From what you leave unsaid, I gather that things are more serious
than the papers would have us believe.  Under those circumstances,
I need not assure you that any help we can render is entirely yours."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin left the room.  Lieutenant Godfrey was already
attacking his breakfast.  Gerald leaned towards him eagerly.
<P>
"Is there really going to be war?" he demanded.
<P>
"Ask those chaps at The Hague," Lieutenant Godfrey answered.
"Doing their best to freeze us out, or something.  All I know is,
if there's going to be fighting, we are ready for them.  By-the-by,
what have you got wireless telegraphy for here, anyway?"
<P>
"It's a fad of my uncle's," Gerald replied.  "Since his accident he
amuses himself in all sorts of queer ways."
<P>
Lieutenant Godfrey nodded.
<P>
"Poor fellow!" he said.  "I heard he was a cripple, or something
of the sort.  Forgive my asking, but - you people are English,
aren't you?"
<P>
"Rather!" Gerald answered.  "The Fentolins have lived here for
hundreds of years.  Why do you ask that?"
<P>
Lieutenant Godfrey hesitated.  He looked, for the moment, scarcely
at his ease.
<P>
"Oh, I don't know," he replied.  "The old man was very anxious I
should find out.  You see, a lot of information seems to have got
over on the other side, and we couldn't think where it had leaked
out, except through your wireless.  However, that isn't likely, of
course, unless you've got one of these beastly Germans in your
receiving-room.  Now if I can borrow a cigarette, a cigar, or a
pipe of tobacco - any mortal thing to smoke - I'll be off, if I may.
The old man turned me out at an unearthly hour this morning, and in
Sheringham all the shops were closed.  Steady on, young fellow," he
laughed, as Gerald filled his pockets with cigarettes.  "Well, here's
good morning to you, Miss Fentolin.  Good morning, sir.  How long
ought it to take me to get to Sheringham?"
<P>
"About forty minutes," Gerald told him, "if your car's any good at
all."
<P>
"It isn't much," was the somewhat dubious reply.  "However, we'll
shove along.  You in the Service?" he enquired, as they walked down
the hall together.
<P>
"Hope I shall be before long," Gerald answered.  I'm going into the
army, though."
<P>
"Have to hurry up, won't you?"
<P>
Gerald sighed.
<P>
"It's a little difficult for me.  Here's your car. Good luck to you!"
<P>
"My excuses to Mr. Fentolin," Lieutenant Godfrey shouted, "and many
thanks."
<P>
He jumped into the automobile and was soon on his way back.  Gerald
watched him until he was nearly out of sight.  On the knoll, two of
the wireless operators were already at work.  Mr. Fentolin sat in
his chair below, watching.  The blue sparks were flashing.  A message
was just being delivered.  Presently Mr. Fentolin turned his chair,
and with Meekins by his side, made his way back to the house.  He
passed along the ball and into his study.  Gerald, who was on his
way to the dining-room, heard the ring of the telephone bell and the
call for the trunk special line.  He hesitated for a moment.  Then
he made his way slowly down towards the study and stood outside the
door, listening.  In a moment he heard Mr. Fentolin's clear voice,
very low yet very penetrating.
<P>
"The Mediterranean Fleet will be forty-seven hours before it comes
together," was the message he heard.  "The Channel Fleet will
manoeuvre off Sheerness, waiting for it.  The North Sea Fleet is
seventeen units under nominal strength."
<P>
Gerald turned the handle of the door slowly and entered.  Mr.
Fentolin was just replacing the receiver on its stand.  He looked
up at his nephew, and his eyebrows came together.
<P>
"What do you mean by this?" he demanded.  "Don't you know that I
allow no one in here when I am telephoning on the private wire?"
<P>
Gerald closed the door behind him and summoned up all his courage.
<P>
"It is because I have heard what you were saying over the telephone
that I am here," he declared.  "I want to know to whom you were
sending that message which you have intercepted outside."
