<p>Five persons were detailed to wait upon us.  Uncle Parker, who brought us
toddy and green nuts, was an elderly, almost an old man, with the
spirits, the industry, and the morals of a boy of ten.  His face was
ancient, droll, and diabolical, the skin stretched over taut sinews, like
a sail on the guide-rope; and he smiled with every muscle of his head.
His nuts must be counted every day, or he would deceive us in the tale;
they must be daily examined, or some would prove to be unhusked; nothing
but the king’s name, and scarcely that, would hold him to his duty.
After his toils were over he was given a pipe, matches, and tobacco, and
sat on the floor in the maniap’ to smoke.  He would not seem to move from
his position, and yet every day, when the things fell to be returned the
plug had disappeared; he had found the means to conceal it in the roof,
whence he could radiantly produce it on the morrow.  Although this piece
of legerdemain was performed regularly before three or four pairs of
eyes, we could never catch him in the fact; although we searched after he
was gone, we could never find the tobacco.  Such were the diversions of
Uncle Parker, a man nearing sixty.  But he was punished according unto
his deeds: Mrs. Stevenson took a fancy to paint him, and the sufferings
of the sitter were beyond description.

<p>Three lasses came from the palace to do our washing and racket with Ah
Fu.  They were of the lowest class, hangers-on kept for the convenience
of merchant skippers, probably low-born, perhaps out-islanders, with
little refinement whether of manner or appearance, but likely and jolly
enough wenches in their way.  We called one <u>Guttersnipe</u>, for you may
find her image in the slums of any city; the same lean, dark-eyed, eager,
vulgar face, the same sudden, hoarse guffaws, the same forward and yet
anxious manner, as with a tail of an eye on the policeman: only the
policeman here was a live king, and his truncheon a rifle.  I doubt if
you could find anywhere out of the islands, or often there, the parallel
of <u>Fatty</u>, a mountain of a girl, who must have weighed near as many
stones as she counted summers, could have given a good account of a
life-guardsman, had the face of a baby, and applied her vast mechanical
forces almost exclusively to play.  But they were all three of the same
merry spirit.  Our washing was conducted in a game of romps; and they
fled and pursued, and splashed, and pelted, and rolled each other in the
sand, and kept up a continuous noise of cries and laughter like holiday
children.  Indeed, and however strange their own function in that austere
establishment, were they not escaped for the day from the largest and
strictest Ladies’ School in the South Seas?
</p><p>Our fifth attendant was no less a person than the royal cook.  He was
strikingly handsome both in face and body, lazy as a slave, and insolent
as a butcher’s boy.  He slept and smoked on our premises in various
graceful attitudes; but so far from helping Ah Fu, he was not at the
pains to watch him.  It may be said of him that he came to learn, and
remained to teach; and his lessons were at times difficult to stomach.
For example, he was sent to fill a bucket from the well.  About half-way
he found my wife watering her onions, changed buckets with her, and
leaving her the empty, returned to the kitchen with the full.  On another
occasion he was given a dish of dumplings for the king, was told they
must be eaten hot, and that he should carry them as fast as possible.
The wretch set off at the rate of about a mile in the hour, head in air,
toes turned out.  My patience, after a month of trial, failed me at the
sight.  I pursued, caught him by his two big shoulders, and thrusting him
before me, ran with him down the hill, over the sands, and through the
applauding village, to the Speak House, where the king was then holding a
pow-wow.  He had the impudence to pretend he was internally injured by my
violence, and to profess serious apprehensions for his life.
</p><p>All this we endured; for the ways of Tembinok’ are summary, and I was not
yet ripe to take a hand in the man’s death.  But in the meanwhile, here
was my unfortunate China boy slaving for the pair, and presently he fell
sick.  I was now in the position of Cimondain Lantenac, and indeed all
the characters in <u>Quatre-Vingt-Treize</u>: to continue to spare the guilty,
I must sacrifice the innocent.  I took the usual course and tried to save
both, with the usual consequence of failure.  Well rehearsed, I went down
to the palace, found the king alone, and obliged him with a vast amount
of rigmarole.  The cook was too old to learn: I feared he was not making
progress; how if we had a boy instead?—boys were more teachable.  It was
all in vain; the king pierced through my disguises to the root of the
fact; saw that the cook had desperately misbehaved; and sat a while
glooming.  ‘I think he tavvy too much,’ he said at last, with grim
concision; and immediately turned the talk to other subjects.  The same
day another high officer, the steward, appeared in the cook’s place, and,
I am bound to say, proved civil and industrious.
</p><p>As soon as I left, it seems the king called for a Winchester and strolled
outside the palisade, awaiting the defaulter.  That day Tembinok’ wore
the woman’s frock; as like as not, his make-up was completed by a pith
helmet and blue spectacles.  Conceive the glaring stretch of sandhills,
the dwarf palms with their noon-day shadows, the line of the palisade,
the crone sentries (each by a small clear fire) cooking syrup on their
posts—and this chimæra waiting with his deadly engine.  To him, enter at
last the cook, strolling down the sandhill from Equator Town, listless,
vain and graceful; with no thought of alarm.  As soon as he was well
within range, the travestied monarch fired the six shots over his head,
at his feet, and on either hand of him: the second Apemama warning,
startling in itself, fatal in significance, for the next time his majesty
will aim to hit.  I am told the king is a crack shot; that when he aims
to kill, the grave may be got ready; and when he aims to miss, misses by
so near a margin that the culprit tastes six times the bitterness of
death.  The effect upon the cook I had an opportunity of seeing for
myself.  My wife and I were returning from the sea-side of the island,
when we spied one coming to meet us at a very quick, disordered pace,
between a walk and a run.  As we drew nearer we saw it was the cook,
beside himself with some emotion, his usual warm, mulatto colour declined
into a bluish pallor.  He passed us without word or gesture, staring on
us with the face of a Satan, and plunged on across the wood for the
unpeopled quarter of the island and the long, desert beach, where he
might rage to and fro unseen, and froth out the vials of his wrath, fear,
and humiliation.  Doubtless in the curses that he there uttered to the
bursting surf and the tropic birds, the name of the Kaupoi—the rich
man—was frequently repeated.  I had made him the laughing-stock of the
village in the affair of the king’s dumplings; I had brought him by my
machinations into disgrace and the immediate jeopardy of his days; last,
and perhaps bitterest, he had found me there by the way to spy upon him
in the hour of his disorder.
</p><p>Time passed, and we saw no more of him.  The season of the full moon came
round, when a man thinks shame to lie sleeping; and I continued until
late—perhaps till twelve or one in the morning—to walk on the bright sand
and in the tossing shadow of the palms.  I played, as I wandered, on a
flageolet, which occupied much of my attention; the fans overhead rattled
in the wind with a metallic chatter; and a bare foot falls at any rate
almost noiseless on that shifting soil.  Yet when I got back to Equator
Town, where all the lights were out, and my wife (who was still awake,
and had been looking forth) asked me who it was that followed me, I
thought she spoke in jest.  ‘Not at all,’ she said.  ‘I saw him twice as
you passed, walking close at your heels.  He only left you at the corner
of the maniap’; he must be still behind the cook-house.’  Thither I
ran—like a fool, without any weapon—and came face to face with the cook.
He was within my tapu-line, which was death in itself; he could have no
business there at such an hour but either to steal or to kill; guilt made
him timorous; and he turned and fled before me in the night in silence.
As he went I kicked him in that place where honour lies, and he gave
tongue faintly like an injured mouse.  At the moment I daresay he
supposed it was a deadly instrument that touched him.
</p><p>What had the man been after?  I have found my music better qualified to
scatter than to collect an audience.  Amateur as I was, I could not
suppose him interested in my reading of the <u>Carnival of Venice</u>, or that
he would deny himself his natural rest to follow my variations on <u>The
Ploughboy</u>.  And whatever his design, it was impossible I should suffer
him to prowl by night among the houses.  A word to the king, and the man
were not, his case being far beyond pardon.  But it is one thing to kill
a man yourself; quite another to bear tales behind his back and have him
shot by a third party; and I determined to deal with the fellow in some
method of my own.  I told Ah Fu the story, and bade him fetch me the cook
whenever he should find him.  I had supposed this would be a matter of
difficulty; and far from that, he came of his own accord: an act really
of desperation, since his life hung by my silence, and the best he could
hope was to be forgotten.  Yet he came with an assured countenance,
volunteered no apology or explanation, complained of injuries received,
and pretended he was unable to sit down.  I suppose I am the weakest man
God made; I had kicked him in the least vulnerable part of his big
carcase; my foot was bare, and I had not even hurt my foot.  Ah Fu could
not control his merriment.  On my side, knowing what must be the nature
of his apprehensions, I found in so much impudence a kind of gallantry,
and secretly admired the man.  I told him I should say nothing of his
night’s adventure to the king; that I should still allow him, when he had
an errand, to come within my tapu-line by day; but if ever I found him
there after the set of the sun I would shoot him on the spot; and to the
proof showed him a revolver.  He must have been incredibly relieved; but
he showed no sign of it, took himself off with his usual dandy
nonchalance, and was scarce seen by us again.
</p><p>These five, then, with the substitution of the steward for the cook, came
and went, and were our only visitors.  The circle of the tapu held at
arm’s-length the inhabitants of the village.  As for ‘my pamily,’ they
dwelt like nuns in their enclosure; only once have I met one of them
abroad, and she was the king’s sister, and the place in which I found her
(the island infirmary) was very likely privileged.  There remains only
the king to be accounted for.  He would come strolling over, always
alone, a little before a meal-time, take a chair, and talk and eat with
us like an old family friend.  Gilbertine etiquette appears defective on
the point of leave-taking.  It may be remembered we had trouble in the
matter with Karaiti; and there was something childish and disconcerting
in Tembinok’s abrupt ‘I want go home now,’ accompanied by a kind of
ducking rise, and followed by an unadorned retreat.  It was the only blot
upon his manners, which were otherwise plain, decent, sensible, and
dignified.  He never stayed long nor drank much, and copied our behaviour
where he perceived it to differ from his own.  Very early in the day, for
instance, he ceased eating with his knife.  It was plain he was
determined in all things to wring profit from our visit, and chiefly upon
etiquette.  The quality of his white visitors puzzled and concerned him;
he would bring up name after name, and ask if its bearer were a ‘big
chiep,’ or even a ‘chiep’ at all—which, as some were my excellent good
friends, and none were actually born in the purple, became at times
embarrassing.  He was struck to learn that our classes were
distinguishable by their speech, and that certain words (for instance)
were tapu on the quarter-deck of a man-of-war; and he begged in
consequence that we should watch and correct him on the point.  We were
able to assure him that he was beyond correction.  His vocabulary is apt
and ample to an extraordinary degree.  God knows where he collected it,
but by some instinct or some accident he has avoided all profane or gross
expressions.  ‘Obliged,’ ‘stabbed,’ ‘gnaw,’ ‘lodge,’ ‘power,’ ‘company,’
‘slender,’ ‘smooth,’ and ‘wonderful,’ are a few of the unexpected words
that enrich his dialect.  Perhaps what pleased him most was to hear about
saluting the quarter-deck of a man-of-war.  In his gratitude for this
hint he became fulsome.  ‘Schooner cap’n no tell me,’ he cried; ‘I think
no tavvy!  You tavvy too much; tavvy ’teama’, tavvy man-a-wa’.  I think
you tavvy everything.’ Yet he gravelled me often enough with his
perpetual questions; and the false Mr. Barlow stood frequently exposed
before the royal Sandford.  I remember once in particular.  We were
showing the magic-lantern; a slide of Windsor Castle was put in, and I
told him there was the ‘outch’ of Victoreea.  ‘How many pathom he high?’
he asked, and I was dumb before him.  It was the builder, the
indefatigable architect of palaces, that spoke; collector though he was,
he did not collect useless information; and all his questions had a
purpose.  After etiquette, government, law, the police, money, and
medicine were his chief interests—things vitally important to himself as
a king and the father of his people.  It was my part not only to supply
new information, but to correct the old.  ‘My patha he tell me,’ or
‘White man he tell me,’ would be his constant beginning; ‘You think he
lie?’  Sometimes I thought he did.  Tembinok’ once brought me a
difficulty of this kind, which I was long of comprehending.  A schooner
captain had told him of Captain Cook; the king was much interested in the
story; and turned for more information—not to Mr. Stephen’s Dictionary,
not to the <u>Britannica</u>, but to the Bible in the Gilbert Island version
(which consists chiefly of the New Testament and the Psalms).  Here he
sought long and earnestly; Paul he found, and Festus and Alexander the
coppersmith: no word of Cook.  The inference was obvious: the explorer
was a myth.  So hard it is, even for a man of great natural parts like
Tembinok’, to grasp the ideas of a new society and culture.
