<p>Matcham was well rested and revived; and the two lads, winged by what
Dick had seen, hurried through the remainder of the outwood, crossed the
road in safety, and began to mount into the high ground of Tunstall
Forest. The trees grew more and more in groves, with healthy places in
between, sandy, gorsy, and dotted with old yews. The ground became more
and more uneven, full of pits and hillocks. And with every step of the
ascent the wind still blew the shriller, and the trees bent before the
gusts like fishing-rods.
</p><p>They had just entered one of the clearings, when Dick suddenly clapped
down upon his face among the brambles, and began to crawl slowly
backward towards the shelter of the grove. Matcham, in great
bewilderment, for he could see no reason for this flight, still imitated
his companion's course; and it was not until they had gained the harbour
of a thicket that he turned and begged him to explain.
</p><p>For all reply, Dick pointed with his finger.
</p><p>At the far end of the clearing, a fir grew high above the neighbouring
wood, and planted its black shock of foliage clear against the sky. For
about fifty feet above the ground the trunk grew straight and solid like
a column. At that level, it split into two massive boughs; and in the
fork, like a mastheaded seaman, there stood a man in a green tabard,
spying far and wide. The sun glistened upon his hair; with one hand he
shaded his eyes to look abroad, and he kept slowly rolling his head from
side to side, with the regularity of a machine.
</p><p>The lads exchanged glances.
</p><p>"Let us try to the left," said Dick. "We had near fallen foully, Jack."
</p><p>Ten minutes afterwards they struck into a beaten path.
</p><p>"Here is a piece of forest that I know not," Dick remarked. "Where goeth
me this track?"
</p><p>"Let us even try," said Matcham.
</p><p>A few yards farther, the path came to the top of a ridge and began to go
down abruptly into a cup-shaped hollow. At the foot, out of a thick wood
of flowering hawthorn, two or three roofless gables, blackened as if by
fire, and a single tall chimney marked the ruins of a house.
</p><p>"What may this be?" whispered Matcham.
</p><p>"Nay, by the mass, I know not," answered Dick. "I am all at sea. Let us
go warily."
</p><p>With beating hearts, they descended through the hawthorns. Here and
there, they passed signs of recent cultivation; fruit trees and pot
herbs ran wild among the thicket; a sun-dial had fallen in the grass; it
seemed they were treading what once had been a garden. Yet a little
farther and they came forth before the ruins of the house.
</p><p>It had been a pleasant mansion and a strong. A dry ditch was dug deep
about it; but it was now choked with masonry, and bridged by a fallen
rafter. The two farther walls still stood, the sun shining through their
empty windows; but the remainder of the building had collapsed, and now
lay in a great cairn of ruin, grimed with fire. Already in the interior
a few plants were springing green among the chinks.
</p><p>"Now I bethink me," whispered Dick, "this must be Grimstone. It was a
hold of one Simon Malmesbury; Sir Daniel was his bane! 'Twas Bennet
Hatch that burned it, now five years agone. In sooth, 'twas pity, for it
was a fair house."
</p><p>Down in the hollow, where no wind blew, it was both warm and still; and
Matcham, laying one hand upon Dick's arm, held up a warning finger.
</p><p>"Hist!" he said.
</p><p>Then came a strange sound, breaking on the quiet. It was twice repeated
ere they recognised its nature. It was the sound of a big man clearing
his throat; and just then a hoarse, untuneful voice broke into singing.
</p><p>  "Then up and spake the master, the king of the outlaws:
   'What make ye here, my merry men, among the greenwood shaws?'
   And Gamelyn made answer--he looked never adown:
   'O, they must need to walk in wood that may not walk in town!'"
</p><p>The singer paused, a faint clink of iron followed, and then silence.
</p><p>[Illustration: <u>In the fork, like a mastheaded seaman, there stood a man

</p><p>The two lads stood looking at each other. Whoever he might be, their
invisible neighbour was just beyond the ruin. And suddenly the colour
came into Matcham's face, and next moment he had crossed the fallen
rafter, and was climbing cautiously on the huge pile of lumber that
filled the interior of the roofless house. Dick would have withheld him,
had he been in time; as it was, he was fain to follow.
</p><p>Right in the corner of the ruin, two rafters had fallen crosswise, and
protected a clear space no larger than a pew in church. Into this the
lads silently lowered themselves. There they were perfectly concealed,
and through an arrow-loophole commanded a view upon the farther side.
</p><p>Peering through this, they were struck stiff with terror at their
predicament. To retreat was impossible; they scarce dared to breathe.
Upon the very margin of the ditch, not thirty feet from where they
crouched, an iron caldron bubbled and steamed above a glowing fire; and
close by, in an attitude of listening, as though he had caught some
sound of their clambering among the ruins, a tall, red-faced,
battered-looking man stood poised, an iron spoon in his right hand, a
horn and a formidable dagger at his belt. Plainly this was the singer;
plainly he had been stirring the caldron, when some incautious step
among the lumber had fallen upon his ear. A little farther off, another
man lay slumbering, rolled in a brown cloak, with a butterfly hovering
above his face. All this was in a clearing white with daisies; and at
the extreme verge, a bow, a sheaf of arrows, and part of a deer's
carcase hung upon a flowering hawthorn.
</p><p>Presently the fellow relaxed from his attitude of attention, raised the
spoon to his mouth, tasted its contents, nodded, and then fell again to
stirring and singing.
</p><p>"'O, they must need to walk in wood that may not walk in town,'" he
croaked, taking up his song where he had left it.
</p><p>  "O, sir, we walk not here at all an evil thing to do.
   But if we meet with the good king's deer to shoot a shaft into."
</p><p>Still as he sang, he took from time to time another spoonful of the
broth, blew upon it, and tasted it, with all the airs of an experienced
cook. At length, apparently, he judged the mess was ready; for taking
the horn from his girdle, he blew three modulated calls.
</p><p>The other fellow awoke, rolled over, brushed away the butterfly, and
looked about him.
</p><p>"How now, brother?" he said. "Dinner?"
</p><p>"Ay, sot," replied the cook, "dinner it is, and a dry dinner, too, with
neither ale nor bread. But there is little pleasure in the greenwood
now; time was when a good fellow could live here like a mitred abbot,
set aside the rain and the white frosts; he had his heart's desire both
of ale and wine. But now are men's spirits dead; and this John
Amend-All, save us and guard us! but a stuffed booby to scare crows
withal."
</p><p>"Nay," returned the other, "y'are too set on meat and drinking, Lawless.
Bide ye a bit; the good time cometh."
</p><p>"Look ye," returned the cook, "I have even waited for this good time
sith that I was so high. I have been a Grey Friar; I have been a king's
archer; I have been a shipman, and sailed the salt seas; and I have been
in greenwood before this, forsooth! and shot the king's deer. What
cometh of it? Naught! I were better to have bided in the cloister. John
Abbot availeth more than John Amend-All. By 'r Lady! here they come."
</p><p>One after another, tall, likely fellows began to stroll into the lawn.
Each as he came produced a knife and a horn cup, helped himself from the
caldron, and sat down upon the grass to eat. They were very variously
equipped and armed; some in rusty smocks, and with nothing but a knife
and an old bow; others in the height of forest gallantry, all in Lincoln
green, both hood and jerkin, with dainty peacock arrows in their belts,
a horn upon a baldrick, and a sword and dagger at their sides. They came
in the silence of hunger, and scarce growled a salutation, but fell
instantly to meat.
</p><p>There were, perhaps, a score of them already gathered, when a sound of
suppressed cheering arose close by among the hawthorns, and immediately
after five or six woodmen carrying a stretcher debouched upon the lawn.
A tall, lusty fellow, somewhat grizzled, and as brown as a smoked ham,
walked before them with an air of some authority, his bow at his back, a
bright boar-spear in his hand.
</p><p>"Lads!" he cried, "good fellows all, and my right merry friends, y' have
sung this while on a dry whistle and lived at little ease. But what said
I ever? Abide Fortune constantly; she turneth, turneth swift. And lo!
here is her little firstling--even that good creature, ale!"
</p><p>There was a murmur of applause as the bearers set down the stretcher and
displayed a goodly cask.
</p><p>"And now haste ye, boys," the man continued. "There is work toward. A
handful of archers are but now come to the ferry; murrey and blue is
their wear; they are our butts--they shall all taste arrows--no man of
them shall struggle through this wood. For, lads, we are here some fifty
strong, each man of us most foully wronged; for some they have lost
lands, and some friends; and some they have been outlawed--all
oppressed! Who, then, hath done this evil? Sir Daniel, by the rood!
Shall he then profit? shall he sit snug in our houses? shall he till our
fields? shall he suck the bone he robbed us of? I trow not. He getteth
him strength at law; he gaineth cases; nay, there is one case he shall
not gain--I have a writ here at my belt that, please the saints, shall
conquer him."
</p><p>Lawless the cook was by this time already at his second horn of ale. He
raised it, as if to pledge the speaker.
</p><p>"Master Ellis," he said, "y'are for vengeance--well it becometh
you!--but your poor brother o' the greenwood, that had never lands to
lose nor friends to think upon, looketh rather, for his poor part, to
the profit of the thing. He had liever a gold noble and a pottle of
canary wine than all the vengeances in purgatory."
</p><p>"Lawless," replied the other, "to reach the Moat House, Sir Daniel must
pass the forest. We shall make that passage dearer, pardy, than any
battle. Then, when he hath got to earth with such ragged handful as
escapeth us--all his great friends fallen and fled away, and none to
give him aid--we shall beleaguer that old fox about, and great shall be
the fall of him. 'Tis a fat buck; he will make a dinner for us all."
</p><p>"Ay," returned Lawless, "I have eaten many of these dinners beforehand;
but the cooking of them is hot work, good Master Ellis. And meanwhile
what do we? We make black arrows, we write rhymes, and we drink fair
cold water, that discomfortable drink."
</p><p>"Y'are untrue, Will Lawless. Ye still smell of the Grey Friars' buttery;
greed is your undoing," answered Ellis. "We took twenty pounds from
Appleyard. We took seven marks from the messenger last night. A day ago
we had fifty from the merchant."
</p><p>"And to-day," said one of the men, "I stopped a fat pardoner riding
apace for Holywood. Here is his purse."
</p><p>Ellis counted the contents.
</p><p>"Five-score shillings!" he grumbled. "Fool, he had more in his sandal,
or stitched into his tippet. Y'are but a child, Tom Cuckow; ye have lost
the fish."
</p><p>But, for all that, Ellis pocketed the purse with nonchalance. He stood
leaning on his boar-spear, and looked round upon the rest. They, in
various attitudes, took greedily of the venison pottage, and liberally
washed it down with ale. This was a good day; they were in luck; but
business pressed, and they were speedy in their eating. The first-comers
had by this time even despatched their dinner. Some lay down upon the
grass and fell instantly asleep, like boa-constrictors; others talked
together, or overhauled their weapons; and one, whose humour was
particularly gay, holding forth an ale-horn, began to sing:
</p><p>    "Here is no law in good green shaw,
</p><pre>
       Here is no lack of meat;
     'Tis merry and quiet, with deer for our diet,
       In summer, when all is sweet.</pre>
<p>    "Come winter again, with wind and rain--
</p><pre>
       Come winter, with snow and sleet,
     Get home to your places, with hoods on your faces,
       And sit by the fire and eat."</pre>
<p>All this while the two lads had listened and lain close; only Richard
had unslung his cross-bow, and held ready in one hand the windac, or
grappling-iron that he used to bend it. Otherwise they had not dared to
stir; and this scene of forest life had gone on before their eyes like a
scene upon a theatre. But now there came a strange interruption. The
tall chimney which overtopped the remainder of the ruins rose right
above their hiding-place. There came a whistle in the air, and then a
sounding smack, and the fragments of a broken arrow fell about their
ears. Some one from the upper quarters of the wood, perhaps the very
sentinel they saw posted in the fir, had shot an arrow at the
chimney-top.
</p><p>Matcham could not restrain a little cry, which he instantly stifled, and
even Dick started with surprise, and dropped the windac from his
fingers. But to the fellows on the lawn, this shaft was an expected
signal. They were all afoot together, tightening their belts, testing
their bow-strings, loosening sword and dagger in the sheath. Ellis held
up his hand; his face had suddenly assumed a look of savage energy; the
white of his eyes shone in his sun-brown face.
</p><p>"Lads," he said, "ye know your places. Let not one man's soul escape
you. Appleyard was a whet before a meal; but now we go to table. I have
three men whom I will bitterly avenge--Harry Shelton, Simon Malmesbury,
and"--striking his broad bosom--"and Ellis Duckworth, by the mass!"
</p><p>Another man came, red with hurry, through the thorns.
</p><p>"'Tis not Sir Daniel!" he panted. "They are but seven. Is the arrow
gone?"
</p><p>"It struck but now," replied Ellis.
</p><p>"A murrain!" cried the messenger. "Methought I heard it whistle. And I
go dinnerless!"
</p><p>In the space of a minute, some running, some walking sharply, according
as their stations were nearer or farther away, the men of the Black
Arrow had all disappeared from the neighbourhood of the ruined house;
and the caldron, and the fire, which was now burning low, and the dead
deer's carcase on the hawthorn, remained alone to testify they had been
there.
