<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>In this lecture we shall be concerned with a very general characteristic
which broadly, though not absolutely, distinguishes the behaviour
of living organisms from that of dead matter. The characteristic
in question is this:</p>

<p>The response of an organism to a given stimulus is very often
dependent upon the past history of the organism, and not merely
upon the stimulus and the <em>HITHERTO DISCOVERABLE </em>present
state of the organism.</p>

<p>This characteristic is embodied in the saying "a burnt child
fears the fire." The burn may have left no visible traces, yet
it modifies the reaction of the child in the presence of fire.
It is customary to assume that, in such cases, the past operates
by modifying the structure of the brain, not directly. I have
no wish to suggest that this hypothesis is false; I wish only
to point out that it is a hypothesis. At the end of the present
lecture I shall examine the grounds in its favour. If we confine
ourselves to facts which have been actually observed, we must
say that past occurrences, in addition to the present stimulus
and the present ascertainable condition of the organism, enter
into the causation of the response.</p>

<p>The characteristic is not wholly confined to living organisms.
For example, magnetized steel looks just like steel which has
not been magnetized, but its behaviour is in some ways different.
In the case of dead matter, however, such phenomena are less frequent
and important than in the case of living organisms, and it is
far less difficult to invent satisfactory hypotheses as to the
microscopic changes of structure which mediate between the past
occurrence and the present changed response. In the case of living
organisms, practically everything that is distinctive both of
their physical and of their mental behaviour is bound up with
this persistent influence of the past. Further, speaking broadly,
the change in response is usually of a kind that is biologically
advantageous to the organism.</p>

<p>Following a suggestion derived from Semon ("Die Mneme," Leipzig,
1904; 2nd edition, 1908, English translation, Allen &amp; Unwin,
1921; "Die mnemischen Empfindungen," Leipzig, 1909), we will give
the name of "mnemic phenomena" to those responses of an organism
which, so far as hitherto observed facts are concerned, can only
be brought under causal laws by including past occurrences in
the history of the organism as part of the causes of the present
response. I do not mean merely&mdash;what would always be the case&mdash;that
past occurrences are part of a <em>CHAIN </em>of causes leading
to the present event. I mean that, in attempting to state the
<em>PROXIMATE </em>cause of the present event, some past event
or events must be included, unless we take refuge in hypothetical
modifications of brain structure. For example: you smell peat-smoke,
and you recall some occasion when you smelt it before. The cause
of your recollection, so far as hitherto observable phenomena
are concerned, consists both of the peat smoke (present stimulus)
and of the former occasion (past experience). The same stimulus
will not produce the same recollection in another man who did
not share your former experience, although the former experience
left no <em>OBSERVABLE </em>traces in the structure of the brain.
According to the maxim "same cause, same effect," we cannot therefore
regard the peat-smoke alone as the cause of your recollection,
since it does not have the same effect in other cases. The cause
of your recollection must be both the peat-smoke and the past
occurrence. Accordingly your recollection is an instance of what
we are calling "mnemic phenomena."</p>

<p>Before going further, it will be well to give illustrations of
different classes of mnemic phenomena.</p>

<p>(a) <em>ACQUIRED HABITS. &</em>mdash;In Lecture II we saw how
animals can learn by experience how to get out of cages or mazes,
or perform other actions which are useful to them but not provided
for by their instincts alone. A cat which is put into a cage of
which it has had experience behaves differently from the way in
which it behaved at first. We can easily invent hypotheses, which
are quite likely to be true, as to connections in the brain caused
by past experience, and themselves causing the different response.
But the observable fact is that the stimulus of being in the cage
produces differing results with repetition, and that the ascertainable
cause of the cat's behaviour is not merely the cage and its own
ascertainable organization, but also its past history in regard
to the cage. From our present point of view, the matter is independent
of the question whether the cat's behaviour is due to some mental
fact called "knowledge," or displays a merely bodily habit. Our
habitual knowledge is not always in our minds, but is called up
by the appropriate stimuli. If we are asked "What is the capital
of France?" we answer "Paris," because of past experience; the
past experience is as essential as the present question in the
causation of our response. Thus all our habitual knowledge consists
of acquired habits, and comes under the head of mnemic phenomena.</p>

<p>(b) <em>IMAGES. &</em>mdash;I shall have much to say about images
in a later lecture; for the present I am merely concerned with
them in so far as they are "copies" of past sensations. When you
hear New York spoken of, some image probably comes into your mind,
either of the place itself (if you have been there), or of some
picture of it (if you have not). The image is due to your past
experience, as well as to the present stimulus of the words "New
York." Similarly, the images you have in dreams are all dependent
upon your past experience, as well as upon the present stimulus
to dreaming. It is generally believed that all images, in their
simpler parts, are copies of sensations; if so, their mnemic character
is evident. This is important, not only on its own account, but
also because, as we shall see later, images play an essential
part in what is called "thinking."</p>

<p>(c) <em>ASSOCIATION. &</em>mdash;The broad fact of association,
on the mental side, is that when we experience something which
we have experienced before, it tends to call up the context of
the former experience. The smell of peat-smoke recalling a former
scene is an instance which we discussed a moment ago. This is
obviously a mnemic phenomenon. There is also a more purely physical
association, which is indistinguishable from physical habit. This
is the kind studied by Mr. Thorndike in animals, where a certain
stimulus is associated with a certain act. This is the sort which
is taught to soldiers in drilling, for example. In such a case
there need not be anything mental, but merely a habit of the body.
There is no essential distinction between association and habit,
and the observations which we made concerning habit as a mnemic
phenomenon are equally applicable to association.</p>

<p>(d) <em>NON-SENSATIONAL ELEMENTS IN PERCEPTION. &</em>mdash;When
we perceive any object of a familiar kind, much of what appears
subjectively to be immediately given is really derived from past
experience. When we see an object, say a penny, we seem to be
aware of its "real" shape we have the impression of something
circular, not of something elliptical. In learning to draw, it
is necessary to acquire the art of representing things according
to the sensation, not according to the perception. And the visual
appearance is filled out with feeling of what the object would
be like to touch, and so on. This filling out and supplying of
the "real" shape and so on consists of the most usual correlates
of the sensational core in our perception. It may happen that,
in the particular case, the real correlates are unusual; for example,
if what we are seeing is a carpet made to look like tiles. If
so, the non-sensational part of our perception will be illusory,
i.e. it will supply qualities which the object in question does
not in fact have. But as a rule objects do have the qualities
added by perception, which is to be expected, since experience
of what is usual is the cause of the addition. If our experience
had been different, we should not fill out sensation in the same
way, except in so far as the filling out is instinctive, not acquired.
It would seem that, in man, all that makes up space perception,
including the correlation of sight and touch and so on, is almost
entirely acquired. In that case there is a large mnemic element
in all the common perceptions by means of which we handle common
objects. And, to take another kind of instance, imagine what our
astonishment would be if we were to hear a cat bark or a dog mew.
This emotion would be dependent upon past experience, and would
therefore be a mnemic phenomenon according to the definition.</p>

<p>(e) <em>MEMORY AS KNOWLEDGE. &</em>mdash;The kind of memory of
which I am now speaking is definite knowledge of some past event
in one's own experience. From time to time we remember things
that have happened to us, because something in the present reminds
us of them. Exactly the same present fact would not call up the
same memory if our past experience had been different. Thus our
remembering is caused by&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The present stimulus,</p>

<p>(2) The past occurrence.</p>

<p>It is therefore a mnemic phenomenon according to our definition.
A definition of "mnemic phenomena" which did not include memory
would, of course, be a bad one. The point of the definition is
not that it includes memory, but that it includes it as one of
a class of phenomena which embrace all that is characteristic
in the subject matter of psychology.</p>

<p>(f) <em>EXPERIENCE. &</em>mdash;The word "experience" is often
used very vaguely. James, as we saw, uses it to cover the whole
primal stuff of the world, but this usage seems objection able,
since, in a purely physical world, things would happen without
there being any experience. It is only mnemic phenomena that embody
experience. We may say that an animal "experiences" an occurrence
when this occurrence modifies the animal's subsequent behaviour,
i.e. when it is the mnemic portion of the cause of future occurrences
in the animal's life. The burnt child that fears the fire has
"experienced" the fire, whereas a stick that has been thrown on
and taken off again has not "experienced" anything, since it offers
no more resistance than before to being thrown on. The essence
of "experience" is the modification of behaviour produced by what
is experienced. We might, in fact, define one chain of experience,
or one biography, as a series of occurrences linked by mnemic
causation. I think it is this characteristic, more than any other,
that distinguishes sciences dealing with living organisms from
physics.</p>

<p>The best writer on mnemic phenomena known to me is Richard Semon,
the fundamental part of whose theory I shall endeavour to summarize
before going further:</p>

<p>When an organism, either animal or plant, is subjected to a stimulus,
producing in it some state of excitement, the removal of the stimulus
allows it to return to a condition of equilibrium. But the new
state of equilibrium is different from the old, as may be seen
by the changed capacity for reaction. The state of equilibrium
before the stimulus may be called the "primary indifference-state";
that after the cessation of the stimulus, the "secondary indifference-state."
We define the "engraphic effect" of a stimulus as the effect in
making a difference between the primary and secondary indifference-states,
and this difference itself we define as the "engram" due to the
stimulus. "Mnemic phenomena" are defined as those due to engrams;
in animals, they are specially associated with the nervous system,
but not exclusively, even in man.</p>

<p>When two stimuli occur together, one of them, occurring afterwards,
may call out the reaction for the other also. We call this an
"ekphoric influence," and stimuli having this character are called
"ekphoric stimuli." In such a case we call the engrams of the
two stimuli "associated." All simultaneously generated engrams
are associated; there is also association of successively aroused
engrams, though this is reducible to simultaneous association.
In fact, it is not an isolated stimulus that leaves an engram,
but the totality of the stimuli at any moment; consequently any
portion of this totality tends, if it recurs, to arouse the whole
reaction which was aroused before. Semon holds that engrams can
be inherited, and that an animal's innate habits may be due to
the experience of its ancestors; on this subject he refers to
Samuel Butler.</p>

<p>Semon formulates two "mnemic principles." The first, or "Law
of Engraphy," is as follows: "All simultaneous excitements in
an organism form a connected simultaneous excitement-complex,
which as such works engraphically, i.e. leaves behind a connected
engram-complex, which in so far forms a whole" ("Die mnemischen
Empfindungen," p. 146). The second mnemic principle, or "Law of
Ekphory," is as follows: "The partial return of the energetic
situation which formerly worked engraphically operates ekphorically
on a simultaneous engram-complex" (ib., p. 173). These two laws
together represent in part a hypothesis (the engram), and in part
an observable fact. The observable fact is that, when a certain
complex of stimuli has originally caused a certain complex of
reactions, the recurrence of part of the stimuli tends to cause
the recurrence of the whole of the reactions.</p>

<p>Semon's applications of his fundamental ideas in various directions
are interesting and ingenious. Some of them will concern us later,
but for the present it is the fundamental character of mnemic
phenomena that is in question.</p>

<p>Concerning the nature of an engram, Semon confesses that at present
it is impossible to say more than that it must consist in some
material alteration in the body of the organism ("Die mnemischen
Empfindungen," p. 376). It is, in fact, hypothetical, invoked
for theoretical uses, and not an outcome of direct observation.
No doubt physiology, especially the disturbances of memory through
lesions in the brain, affords grounds for this hypothesis; nevertheless
it does remain a hypothesis, the validity of which will be discussed
at the end of this lecture.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that, in the present state of physiology,
the introduction of the engram does not serve to simplify the
account of mnemic phenomena. We can, I think, formulate the known
laws of such phenomena in terms, wholly, of observable facts,
by recognizing provisionally what we may call "mnemic causation."
By this I mean that kind of causation of which I spoke at the
beginning of this lecture, that kind, namely, in which the proximate
cause consists not merely of a present event, but of this together
with a past event. I do not wish to urge that this form of causation
is ultimate, but that, in the present state of our knowledge,
it affords a simplification, and enables us to state laws of behaviour
in less hypothetical terms than we should otherwise have to employ.</p>

<p>The clearest instance of what I mean is recollection of a past
event. What we observe is that certain present stimuli lead us
to recollect certain occurrences, but that at times when we are
not recollecting them, there is nothing discoverable in our minds
that could be called memory of them. Memories, as mental facts,
arise from time to time, but do not, so far as we can see, exist
in any shape while they are "latent." In fact, when we say that
they are "latent," we mean merely that they will exist under certain
circumstances. If, then, there is to be some standing difference
between the person who can remember a certain fact and the person
who cannot, that standing difference must be, not in anything
mental, but in the brain. It is quite probable that there is such
a difference in the brain, but its nature is unknown and it remains
hypothetical. Everything that has, so far, been made matter of
observation as regards this question can be put together in the
statement: When a certain complex of sensations has occurred to
a man, the recurrence of part of the complex tends to arouse the
recollection of the whole. In like manner, we can collect all
mnemic phenomena in living organisms under a single law, which
contains what is hitherto verifiable in Semon's two laws. This
single law is:</p>

<p>IF A <em>COMPLEX STIMULUS A HAS CAUSED A COMPLEX REACTION B IN
AN ORGANISM, THE OCCURRENCE OF A PART OF A ON A FUTURE OCCASION
TENDS TO CAUSE THE WHOLE REACTION B</em>.</p>

<p>This law would need to be supplemented by some account of the
influence of frequency, and so on; but it seems to contain the
essential characteristic of mnemic phenomena, without admixture
of anything hypothetical.</p>

<p>Whenever the effect resulting from a stimulus to an organism
differs according to the past history of the organism, without
our being able actually to detect any relevant difference in its
present structure, we will speak of "mnemic causation," provided
we can discover laws embodying the influence of the past. In ordinary
physical causation, as it appears to common sense, we have approximate
uniformities of sequence, such as "lightning is followed by thunder,"
"drunkenness is followed by headache," and so on. None of these
sequences are theoretically invariable, since something may intervene
to disturb them. In order to obtain invariable physical laws,
we have to proceed to differential equations, showing the direction
of change at each moment, not the integral change after a finite
interval, however short. But for the purposes of daily life many
sequences are to all in tents and purposes invariable. With the
behaviour of human beings, however, this is by no means the case.
If you say to an Englishman, "You have a smut on your nose," he
will proceed to remove it, but there will be no such effect if
you say the same thing to a Frenchman who knows no English. The
effect of words upon the hearer is a mnemic phenomena, since it
depends upon the past experience which gave him understanding
of the words. If there are to be purely psychological causal laws,
taking no account of the brain and the rest of the body, they
will have to be of the form, not "X now causes Y now," but&mdash;</p>

<p>"A, B, C,... in the past, together with X now, cause Y now."
For it cannot be successfully maintained that our understanding
of a word, for example, is an actual existent content of the mind
at times when we are not thinking of the word. It is merely what
may be called a "disposition," i.e. it is capable of being aroused
whenever we hear the word or happen to think of it. A "disposition"
is not something actual, but merely the mnemic portion of a mnemic
causal law.</p>

<p>In such a law as "A, B, C,... in the past, together with X now,
cause Y now," we will call A, B, C,... the mnemic cause, X the
occasion or stimulus, and Y the reaction. All cases in which experience
influences behaviour are instances of mnemic causation.</p>

<p>Believers in psycho-physical parallelism hold that psychology
can theoretically be freed entirely from all dependence on physiology
or physics. That is to say, they believe that every psychical
event has a psychical cause and a physical concomitant. If there
is to be parallelism, it is easy to prove by mathematical logic
that the causation in physical and psychical matters must be of
the same sort, and it is impossible that mnemic causation should
exist in psychology but not in physics. But if psychology is to
be independent of physiology, and if physiology can be reduced
to physics, it would seem that mnemic causation is essential in
psychology. Otherwise we shall be compelled to believe that all
our knowledge, all our store of images and memories, all our mental
habits, are at all times existing in some latent mental form,
and are not merely aroused by the stimuli which lead to their
display. This is a very difficult hypothesis. It seems to me that
if, as a matter of method rather than metaphysics, we desire to
obtain as much independence for psychology as is practically feasible,
we shall do better to accept mnemic causation in psychology protem,
and therefore reject parallelism, since there is no good ground
for admitting mnemic causation in physics.</p>

<p>It is perhaps worth while to observe that mnemic causation is
what led Bergson to deny that there is causation at all in the
psychical sphere. He points out, very truly, that the same stimulus,
repeated, does not have the same consequences, and he argues that
this is contrary to the maxim, "same cause, same effect." It is
only necessary, however, to take account of past occurrences and
include them with the cause, in order to re-establish the maxim,
and the possibility of psychological causal laws. The metaphysical
conception of a cause lingers in our manner of viewing causal
laws: we want to be able to <em>FEEL </em>a connection between
cause and effect, and to be able to imagine the cause as "operating."
This makes us unwilling to regard causal laws as <em>MERELY </em>observed
uniformities of sequence; yet that is all that science has to
offer. To ask why such-and-such a kind of sequence occurs is either
to ask a meaningless question, or to demand some more general
kind of sequence which includes the one in question. The widest
empirical laws of sequence known at any time can only be "explained"
in the sense of being subsumed by later discoveries under wider
laws; but these wider laws, until they in turn are subsumed, will
remain brute facts, resting solely upon observation, not upon
some supposed inherent rationality.</p>

<p>There is therefore no a priori objection to a causal law in which
part of the cause has ceased to exist. To argue against such a
law on the ground that what is past cannot operate now, is to
introduce the old metaphysical notion of cause, for which science
can find no place. The only reason that could be validly alleged
against mnemic causation would be that, in fact, all the phenomena
can be explained without it. They are explained without it by
Semon's "engram," or by any theory which regards the results of
experience as embodied in modifications of the brain and nerves.
But they are not explained, unless with extreme artificiality,
by any theory which regards the latent effects of experience as
psychical rather than physical. Those who desire to make psychology
as far as possible independent of physiology would do well, it
seems to me, if they adopted mnemic causation. For my part, however,
I have no such desire, and I shall therefore endeavour to state
the grounds which occur to me in favour of some such view as that
of the "engram."</p>

<p>One of the first points to be urged is that mnemic phenomena
are just as much to be found in physiology as in psychology. They
are even to be found in plants, as Sir Francis Darwin pointed
out (cf. Semon, "Die Mneme," 2nd edition, p. 28 n.). Habit is
a characteristic of the body at least as much as of the mind.
We should, therefore, be compelled to allow the intrusion of mnemic
causation, if admitted at all, into non-psychological regions,
which ought, one feels, to be subject only to causation of the
ordinary physical sort. The fact is that a great deal of what,
at first sight, distinguishes psychology from physics is found,
on examination, to be common to psychology and physiology; this
whole question of the influence of experience is a case in point.
Now it is possible, of course, to take the view advocated by Professor
J. S. Haldane, who contends that physiology is not theoretically
reducible to physics and chemistry.* But the weight of opinion
among physiologists appears to be against him on this point; and
we ought certainly to require very strong evidence before admitting
any such breach of continuity as between living and dead matter.
The argument from the existence of mnemic phenomena in physiology
must therefore be allowed a certain weight against the hypothesis
that mnemic causation is ultimate.</p>

<p>The argument from the connection of brain-lesions with loss of
memory is not so strong as it looks, though it has also, some
weight. What we know is that memory, and mnemic phenomena generally,
can be disturbed or destroyed by changes in the brain. This certainly
proves that the brain plays an essential part in the causation
of memory, but does not prove that a certain state of the brain
is, by itself, a sufficient condition for the existence of memory.
Yet it is this last that has to be proved. The theory of the engram,
or any similar theory, has to maintain that, given a body and
brain in a suitable state, a man will have a certain memory, without
the need of any further conditions. What is known, however, is
only that he will not have memories if his body and brain are
not in a suitable state. That is to say, the appropriate state
of body and brain is proved to be necessary for memory, but not
to be sufficient. So far, therefore, as our definite knowledge
goes, memory may require for its causation a past occurrence as
well as a certain present state of the brain.</p>

<p>In order to prove conclusively that mnemic phenomena arise whenever
certain physiological conditions are fulfilled, we ought to be
able actually to see differences between the brain of a man who
speaks English and that of a man who speaks French, between the
brain of a man who has seen New York and can recall it, and that
of a man who has never seen that city. It may be that the time
will come when this will be possible, but at present we are very
far removed from it. At present, there is, so far as I am aware,
no good evidence that every difference between the knowledge possessed
by A and that possessed by B is paralleled by some difference
in their brains. We may believe that this is the case, but if
we do, our belief is based upon analogies and general scientific
maxims, not upon any foundation of detailed observation. I am
myself inclined, as a working hypothesis, to adopt the belief
in question, and to hold that past experience only affects present
behaviour through modifications of physiological structure. But
the evidence seems not quite conclusive, so that I do not think
we ought to forget the other hypothesis, or to reject entirely
the possibility that mnemic causation may be the ultimate explanation
of mnemic phenomena. I say this, not because I think it <em>LIKELY
</em>that mnemic causation is ultimate, but merely because I think
it <em>POSSIBLE, </em>and because it often turns out important
to the progress of science to remember hypotheses which have previously
seemed improbable.</p>
