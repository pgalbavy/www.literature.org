<p>The former district attorney started slightly.  Then, coming still
closer, he peered into the tense, angry features of Barry Houston.
</p>
<p>"A bit melodramatic, aren't you?" he asked in a sneering tone.
</p><p>"Perhaps so.  But then murder is always melodramatic."
</p><p>"Murder?  You don't intend--"
</p><p>"No.  I simply referred to the past.  I should have said 'reference to
murder.'  I hope you will pardon me if any inelegance of language
should offend you."
</p><p>"Sarcastic, aren't you?"
</p><p>"I have a right to be.  Knowing what I know--I should use more than
sarcasm."
</p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, you have.  The butler spoke of some threat."
</p><p>"Hardly a threat, Mr. Worthington."  Houston was speaking coldly,
incisively.  "Merely what I have heard you often call in court a
statement of fact.  In case it wasn't repeated to you correctly, I'll
bore you with it again.  I said that if you didn't see me immediately,
there would be something extremely distasteful to you in the morning
papers."
</p><p>"Well?  I've seen you.  Now--"
</p><p>"Wait just a moment, Mr. Worthington.  I thought it was only civil
lawyers who indulged in technicalities.  I didn't know that criminal,"
and he put emphasis on the word, then repeated it, "that criminal
lawyers had the habit also."
</p><p>"If you'll cease this insulting--"
</p><p>"Oh, I think I have a right to that.  To tell the truth, I've only
begun to insult you.  That is--if you call this sort of a thing an
insult.  To get at the point of the matter, Mr. Worthington, I want to
be fair with you.  I've come here to ask something--I'll admit
that--but it is something that should benefit you in a number of ways.
But we'll speak of that later.  The main point is this: I am thinking
very seriously of suing the city of Boston for a million dollars."
</p><p>"Well?  What's that to me?"  Worthington sighed, with a bit of relief,
Houston thought, and walked back to the table for a cigarette.  "I
haven't anything to do with the city.  Go as far as you like.  I'm out
of politics; in case you don't know, I'm in business for myself and
haven't the least interest in what the city does, or what any one does
to it."
</p><p>"Even though you should happen to be the bone of contention--and the
butt of what may be a good deal of unpleasant newspaper notoriety?"
</p><p>"You're talking blackmail!"
</p><p>"I beg your pardon.  Blackmail is something by which one extorts money.
I'm here to try to give you money--or at least the promise of it--and
at the same time allow you to make up for something that should,
whether it does or not, weigh rather heavily on your conscience."
</p><p>"If you'll come to the point."
</p><p>"Exactly.  Do you remember my case?"
</p><p>"In a way.  I had a good many of them."
</p><p>"Which, I hope, you did not handle in the same way that you did mine.
But to recall it all to your recollection, I was accused of having
killed my own cousin, Tom Langdon, with a mallet."
</p><p>"Yes--I remember now.  You two had some kind of a drunken fight."
</p><p>"And you, at the time, if I remember correctly, had a fight of your
own.  It was nearing election time."
</p><p>"Correct.  I remember now."  Then, with a little smile, "Quite luckily,
I was beaten."
</p><p>"I agree with you there.  But to return to the original statement.  Am
I right, or am I wrong, when I say that you were striving very hard,
for a record that would aid you in the election?"
</p><p>"Every official tries to make the best possible record.  Especially at
election time."
</p><p>"No matter whom it injures."
</p><p>"I didn't say that."
</p><p>"But I did--and I repeat it.  No matter whom it injures!  Now, to be
plain and frank and brutal with you to-night as you were with me in the
courtroom, Mr. Worthington, I have pretty convincing evidence that you
knew I was innocent.  Further, that you knew it almost at the beginning
of the trial.  But that in spite of this knowledge, you continued to
persecute me--notice, I don't say prosecute--to persecute me in a hope
of gaining a conviction, simply that you might go before the voters and
point to me in prison as a recommendation of your efficiency as a
district attorney."
</p><p>"Oh!"  Worthington threw away his cigarette with an angry gesture, and
came forward.  "You fellows are all the same.  You're always squealing
about your innocence.  I never saw a man yet who wasn't innocent in one
way or another.  Even when they confess, they've got some kind of an
alibi for their act.  They didn't know the gun was loaded, or the other
fellow hit them first or--"
</p><p>"In my case I have no alibis.  And this isn't simply my own statement.
I have sufficient witnesses."
</p><p>"Then why didn't you produce them at the trial?"
</p><p>"I couldn't.  You had them."
</p><p>"I?"
</p><p>"Yes.  I don't mind giving you the names.  One of them was Doctor
Horton.  Another was Doctor Mayer.  A third was Doctor Brensteam, all
physicians of the highest reputation.  I would like, Mr. Worthington,
to know why you did not make use of them in the trial instead of the
expert Hamon, and that other one, Jaggerston, who, as every one knows,
are professional expert witnesses, ready at all times to testify upon
anything from handwriting to the velocity of a rifle bullet, providing
they are sufficiently paid."
</p><p>"Why?  Simply because I figured they would make the best witnesses."
</p><p>"It couldn't have been," and Houston's voice was more coldly caustic
than ever, "that it was because they would be willing to perjure
themselves, while the real doctors wouldn't?"
</p><p>"Of course not!  This whole thing is silly.  Besides, I'm out of it
entirely.  I'm--"
</p><p>"Mr. Worthington," and Houston's tone changed.  "Your manner and your
words indicate very plainly that you're not out of it--that you merely
wish you were.  Isn't that the truth?  Don't you?"
</p><p>"Well," and the man lit a fresh cigarette, "I feel that way about every
murder case."
</p><p>"But especially about this one.  You're not naturally a persecutor.
You don't naturally want to railroad men to the penitentiary.  And I
believe that, as a general thing, you didn't do it.  You tried it in my
case; election was coming on, you had just run up against two or three
acquittals, and you had made up your mind that in my case you were
going to run the gauntlet to get a conviction.  I don't believe you
wanted to send me up simply for the joy of seeing an innocent man
confined in prison.  You wanted a conviction--wasn't that it?"
</p><p>"Every prosecutor works for that."
</p><p>"Not when he knows the man is innocent, Mr. Worthington.  You knew
that--I have proof.  I have evidence that you found it out almost at
the beginning of my trial--August second, to be exact--and that you
used this information to your own ends.  In other words, it told you
what the defense would testify; and you built up, with your
professional experts, a wall to combat it.  Now, isn't that the truth?"
</p><p>"Why--"  The former district attorney took more time than usual to
knock the ashes from his cigarette, then suddenly changed the subject.
</p><p>"You spoke of a suit you might bring when you came in here?"
</p><p>"Yes.  Against the city.  I have a perfect one.  I was persecuted when
the official in charge of the case knew that I was not guilty.  To that
end I can call the three doctors I've mentioned and put them on the
stand and ask them why they did not testify in the case.  I also can
call the officials of Bellstrand Hospital in New York where you
conducted certain experiments on cadavers on the night of August
second; also a doctor who saw you working in there and who watched you
personally strike the blows with a mallet; further, I can produce the
records of the hospital which state that you were there, give the names
of the entire party, together with the number of corpses experimented
upon.  Is that sufficient evidence that I know what I'm talking about?"
</p><p>Worthington examined his cigarette again.
</p><p>"I suppose it's on the books down there.  But there's nothing to state
of what the experiments consisted."
</p><p>"I have just told you that I have an eye-witness.  Further, there are
the three doctors."
</p><p>"Have you seen them?"
</p><p>Houston thought quickly.  It was his only chance.
</p><p>"I know exactly what their testimony will be."
</p><p>"You've made arrangements for your suit then."  Worthington's color had
changed.  Houston noticed that the hand which held the cigarette
trembled slightly.
</p><p>"No, I haven't.  I'm not here to browbeat you, Mr. Worthington, or lie
to you.  It came to me simply as a ruse to get in to see you.  But the
more I think of it, the more I know that I could go through with it and
possibly win it.  I might get my million.  I might not.  I don't want
money gained in that way.  The taxpayers would have to foot the bill,
not yourself."
</p><p>"Oh, I guess I'd pay enough," Worthington had assumed an entirely
different attitude now.  "It would hurt me worse in business than it
would if I were still in office.  Whether it's true or not."
</p><p>"You know in your heart that there's no doubt of that."
</p><p>Worthington did not answer.  Houston waited a moment, then went on.
</p><p>"But personally, I don't want to file the suit.  I don't want any
money--that way.  I don't want any bribes, or exculpations, or
statements from you that you know me to be innocent.  Some might
believe it; others would only ask how much I paid to have that
statement given out.  The damage has been done and is next to
irreparable.  You could have cleared me easily enough by dropping the
case, or making your investigations before ever an indictment was
issued.  You didn't, and I remain guilty in the minds of most of
Boston, in spite of what the jury said.  A man is not guilty until
convicted--under the law.  He is guilty as soon as accused, with the
lay mind.  So you can't help me much there; my only chance for freedom
lies in finding the man who actually committed that murder.  But that's
something else.  We won't talk about it.  You owe me something.  And
I'm here to-night to ask you for it."
</p><p>"I thought you said you didn't want any bribes."
</p><p>"I don't.  May I ask you what your margin of profit is at your
machinery company?"
</p><p>"My margin of profit?  What's that?  Well, I suppose it runs around
twelve per cent."
</p><p>"Then will you please allow me to give you twelve thousand dollars in
profits?  I'm in the lumber business.  I have a contract that runs into
the millions; surely that is good enough security to a man"--he
couldn't resist the temptation--"who knows my absolute innocence.  It
isn't good enough for the bankers, who still believe me guilty, so I've
come directly to you.  I need one hundred thousand dollars' worth of
lumber-mill machinery, blade saws, crosscuts, jackers, planers,
kickers, chain belting, leather belting, and everything else that goes
to make up a first-class plant.  I can pay for it--in installments.  I
guarantee to give you every cent above my current running expenses
until the bill is disposed of.  My contract with the Mountain, Plains
and Salt Lake Railroad is my bond.  I don't even ask a discount, or for
you to lose any of your profits.  I don't even ask any public statement
by you regarding my innocence.  All I want is to have you do what you
would do to any reputable business man who came to you with a contract
running into the millions of dollars--to give me credit for that
machinery.  It's a fair proposition.  Come in with me on it, and we'll
forget the rest.  Stay out--and I fight!"
</p><p>For a long moment, Kilbane Worthington paced the floor, his hands
clasped behind him, his rather thin head low upon his chest.  Then, at
last, he looked up.
</p><p>"How long are you going to be in town?"
</p><p>"Until this matter's settled."
</p><p>"Where are you staying?"
</p><p>"The Touraine."
</p><p>"Very well.  I'll have a machine there to pick you up at ten o'clock
to-morrow morning and take you to my office.  In the meanwhile--I'll
think it over."
