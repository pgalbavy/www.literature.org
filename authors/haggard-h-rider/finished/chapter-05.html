<p>I slept in Anscombe's room that night and looked after him.  He
was very feverish and the pain in his leg kept him awake a good
deal.  He told me that he could not bear Dr. Rodd and wished to
get away at once.  I had to explain to him that this was
impossible until his spare oxen arrived which I was going to send
for to Pretoria, but of other matters, including that of the
dangerous state of his foot, I said nothing.  I was thankful when
towards two in the morning, he fell into a sound sleep and
allowed me to do the same.
</p><p>Before breakfast time, just as I had finished dressing myself in
some of the clean things which had been brought from the wagon,
Rodd came and made a thorough and business-like examination of
his patient, while I awaited the result with anxiety on the
stoep.  At length he appeared and said--
</p><p>"Well, I think that we shall be able to save the foot, though I
can't be quite sure for another twenty-four hours.  The worst
symptoms have abated and his temperature is down by two degrees.
Anyway he will have to stay in bed and live on light food till it
is normal, after which he might lie in a long chair on the stoep.
On no account must he attempt to stand."
</p><p>I thanked him for his information heartily enough and asked him
if he knew where Marnham was, as I wanted to speak to him with
reference to the despatch of Footsack to fetch the oxen from
Pretoria.
</p><p>"Not up yet, I think," he answered.  "I fancy that yesterday was
one of his 'wet' nights, excitement of meeting strangers and so
on."
</p><p>"Wet nights?" I queried, wishing for a clearer explanation.
</p><p>"Yes, he is a grand old fellow, one of the best, but like most
other people he has his little weaknesses, and when the fit is on
him he can put away a surprising amount of liquor.  I tell you so
that you should not be astonished if you notice anything, or try
to argue with him when he is in that state, as then his temper is
apt to be--well, lively.  Now I must go and give him a pint of
warm milk; that is his favourite antidote, and in fact the best
there is."
</p><p>I thought to myself that we had struck a nice establishment in
which to be tied, literally by the leg, for an indefinite period.
I was not particularly flush at the time, but I know I would have
paid a #100 to be out of it; before the end I should have been
glad to throw in everything that I had.  But mercifully that was
hidden from me.
</p><p>Rodd and I breakfasted together and discoursed of Kaffir customs,
as to which he was singularly well informed.  Then I accompanied
him to see his native patients in the little hospital of which I
have spoken.  Believing the man to be a thorough scamp as I did,
it was astonishing to me to note how gentle and forbearing he was
to these people.  Of his skill I need say nothing, as that was
evident.  He was going to perform an internal operation upon a
burly old savage, rather a serious one I believe; at any rate it
necessitated chloroform.  He asked me if I would like to assist,
but I declined respectfully, having no taste for such things.  So
I left him boiling his instruments and putting on what looked
like a clean nightgown over his clothes, and returned to the
stoep.
</p><p>Here I found Marnham, whose eyes were rather bloodshot, though
otherwise, except for a shaky hand, he seemed right enough.  He
murmured something about having overslept himself and inquired
very politely, for his manners were beautiful, after Anscombe and
as to whether we were quite comfortable and so forth.  After this
I consulted him as to the best road for our servants to travel by
to Pretoria, and later on despatched them, giving Footsack
various notes to ensure the delivery of the oxen to him.  Also I
gave him some money to pay for their keep and told him with many
threats to get back with the beasts as quick as he could travel.
Then I sent him and the two other boys off, not without
misgivings, although he was an experienced man in his way and
promised faithfully to fulfil every injunction to the letter.  To
me he seemed so curiously glad to go that I inquired the reason,
since after a journey like ours, it would have been more natural
if he had wished to rest.
</p><p>"Oh! Baas," he said, "I don't think this Tampel very healthy for
coloured people.  I am told of some who have died here.  That man
Karl who gave me the diamond, I think he must have died also, at
least I saw his spook last night standing over me and shaking his
head, and the boys saw it too."
</p><p>"Oh! be off with your talk of spooks," I said, "and come back
quickly with those oxen, or I promise you that you will die and
be a spook yourself."
</p><p>"I will, Baas, I will!" he ejaculated and departed almost at a
run, leaving me rather uncomfortable.
</p><p>I believed nothing of the tale of the spook of Karl, but I saw
that Footsack believed in it, and was afraid lest he might be
thereby prevented from returning.  I would much rather have gone
myself, but it was impossible for me to leave Anscombe so ill in
the hands of our strange hosts.  And there was no one else whom I
could send.  I might perhaps have ridden to Pilgrim's Rest and
tried to find a white messenger there; indeed afterwards I
regretted not having done so, although it would have involved at
least a day's absence at a very critical time.  But the truth is
I never thought of it until too late, and probably if I had, I
should not have been able to discover anyone whom I could trust.
</p><p>As I walked back to the house, having parted from Footsack on
the top of a neighbouring ridge whence I could point out his path
to him, I met Marnham riding away.  He pulled up and said that he
was going down to the Granite stream to arrange about setting
some one up to watch the wagon.  I expressed sorrow that he
should have the trouble, which should have been mine if I could
have got away, whereon he answered that he was glad of the
opportunity for a ride, as it was something to do.
</p><p>"How do you fill in your time here," I asked carelessly, "as you
don't farm?"
</p><p>"Oh! by trading," he replied, and with a nod set his horse to a
canter.
</p><p>A queer sort of trading, thought I to myself, where there is no
store.  Now what exactly does he trade in, I wonder?
</p><p>As it happened I was destined to find out before I was an hour
older.  Having given Anscombe a look and found that he was
comfortable, I thought that I would inspect the quarry whence the
marble came of which the house was built, as it had occurred to
me that if there was plenty of it, it might be worth exploiting
some time in the future.  It had been pointed out to me in the
midst of some thorns in a gully that ran at right angles to the
main kloof not more than a few hundred yards from the house.
Following a path over which the stones had been dragged
originally, I came to the spot and discovered that a little
cavity had been quarried in what seemed to me to be a positive
mountain of pure white marble.  I examined the place as
thoroughly as I could, climbing among some bushes that grew in
surface earth which had been washed down from the top, in order
to do so.
</p><p>At the back of these bushes there was a hole large enough for a
man to creep through.  I crept through with the object of
ascertaining whether the marble veins continued.  To my surprise
I found a stout yellow-wood door within feet of the mouth of the
hole.  Reflecting that no doubt it was here that the quarrymen
kept, or had kept tools and explosives, I gave it a push.  I
suppose it had been left unfastened accidentally, or that
something had gone wrong with the lock; at any rate it swung
open.  Pursuing my researches as to the depth of the marble I
advanced boldly and, the place being dark, struck a match.
Evidently the marble did continue, as I could see by the
glittering roof of a cavern, for such it was.  But the floor
attracted my attention as well as the roof, for on it were
numerous cases not unlike coffins, bearing the stamp of a
well-known Birmingham firm, labelled "fencing iron" and
addressed to Messrs. Marnham &amp; Rodd, Transvaal, <u>via</u> Delagoa
Bay.
</p><p>I knew at once what they were, having seen the like before, but
if any doubt remained in my mind it was easy to solve, for as it
chanced one of the cases was open and half emptied.  I slipped my
hand into it.  As I thought it contained the ordinary Kaffir gun
of commerce, cost delivered in Africa, say 35s.; cost delivered
to native chief in cash or cattle, say #10, which, when the
market is eager, allows for a decent profit.  Contemplating those
cases, survivors probably of a much larger stock, I understood
how it came about that Sekukuni had dared to show fight against
the Government.  Doubtless it was hence that the guns had come
which sent a bullet through Anscombe's foot and nearly polished
off both of us.
</p><p>Moreover, as further matches showed me, that cave contained other
stores--item, kegs of gunpowder; item, casks of cheap spirit;
item, bars of lead, also a box marked "bullet moulds" and another
marked "Percussion caps." I think, too, there were some innocent
bags full of beads and a few packages of Birmingham-made assegai
blades.  There may have been other things, but if so I did not
wait to investigate them.  Gathering up the ends of my matches
and, in case there should be any dust in the place that would
show footmarks, flapping the stone floor behind me with my pocket
handkerchief, I retired and continued my investigations of that
wonderful marble deposit from the bottom of the quarry, to which,
having re-arranged the bushes, I descended by another route,
leaping like a buck from stone to stone.
</p><p>It was just as well that I did so, for a few minutes later Dr.
Rodd appeared.
</p><p>"Made a good job of your operation?" I asked cheerfully.
</p><p>"Pretty fair, thanks," he answered, "although that Kaffir tried
to brain the nurse-man when he was coming out of the anesthetic.
But are you interested in geology?"
</p><p>"A little," I replied, "that is if there is any chance of making
money out of it, which there ought to be here, as this marble
looks almost as good as that of Carrara.  But flint instruments
are more my line, that is in an ignorant and amateur way, as I
think they are in yours, for I saw some in your room.  Tell me,
what do you think of this.  Is it a scraper?" and I produced a
stone out of my pocket which I had found a week before in the
bush-veld.
</p><p>At once he forgot his suspicions, of which I could see he arrived
very full indeed.  This curious man, as it happened, was really
fond of flint instruments, of which he knew a great deal.
</p><p>"Did you find this here?" he asked.
</p><p>I led him several yards further from the mouth of the cave and
pointed out the exact spot where I said I had picked it up
amongst some quarry debris.  Then followed a most learned
discussion, for it appeared that this was a flint instrument of
the rarest and most valuable type, one that Noah might have used,
or Job might have scraped himself with, and the question was how
the dickens had it come among that quarry debris.  In the end we
left the problem undecided, and having presented the article to
Dr. Rodd, a gift for which he thanked me with real warmth, I
returned to the house filled with the glow that rewards one who
has made a valuable discovery.
</p><p>Of the following three days I have nothing particular to say,
except that during them I was perhaps more acutely bored than
ever I had been in my life before.  The house was beautiful in
its own fashion; the food was excellent; there was everything I
could want to drink, and Rodd announced that he no longer feared
the necessity of operation upon Anscombe's leg.  His recovery was
now a mere matter of time, and meanwhile he must not use his foot
or let the blood run into it more than could be helped, which
meant that he must keep himself in a recumbent position.  The
trouble was that I had nothing on earth do except study the
characters of our hosts, which I found disagreeable and
depressing.  I might have gone out shooting, but nothing of the
sort was allowed upon the property in obedience to the wish of
Miss Heda, a mysterious young person who was always expected and
never appeared, and beyond it I was afraid to travel for fear of
Basutos.  I might have gone to Pilgrim's Rest or Lydenburg to
make report of the nefarious deeds of the said Basutos, but at
best it would have taken one or two days, and possibly I should
have been detained by officials who never consider any one's time
except their own.
</p><p>This meant that I should have been obliged to leave Anscombe
alone, which I did not wish to do, so I just sat still and, as I
have said, was intensely bored, hanging about the place and
smoking more than was good for me.
</p><p>In due course Anscombe emerged on to the stoep, where he lay with
his leg up, and was also bored, especially after he had tried to
pump old Marnham about his past in the Guards and completely
failed.  It was in this mood of utter dejection that we agreed to
play a game of cards one evening.  Not that either of us cared
for cards; indeed, personally, I have always detested them
because, with various-coloured counters to represent money which
never passed, they had formed one of the afflictions of my youth.
</p><p>It was so annoying if you won, to be handed a number of green
counters and be informed that they represented so many hundreds
or thousands of pounds, or vice-versa if you lost, for as it cost
no one anything, my dear father insisted upon playing for
enormous stakes.  Never in any aspect of life have I cared for
fooling.  Anscombe also disliked cards, I think because his
ancestors too had played with counters, such as some that I have
seen belonging to the Cocoa-Tree Club and other gambling places
of a past generation, marked as high as a thousand guineas, which
counters must next morning be redeemed in hard cash, whereby his
family had been not a little impoverished.
</p><p>"I fancy you will find they are high-fliers," he said when the
pair had left to fetch a suitable table, for the night being very
hot we were going to play on the stoep by the light of the
hanging paraffin lamp and some candles.  I replied to the effect
that I could not afford to lose large sums of money, especially
to men who for aught I knew might then be engaged in marking the
cards.
</p><p>"I understand," he answered.  "Don't you bother about that, old
fellow.  This is my affair, arranged for my special amusement.  I
shan't grumble if the fun costs something, for I am sure there
will be fun."
</p><p>"All right," I said, "only if we should happen to win money, it's
yours, not mine."
</p><p>To myself I reflected, however, that with these two opponents we
had about as much chance of winning as a snowflake has of
resisting the atmosphere of the lower regions.
</p><p>Presently they returned with the table, which had a green cloth
over it that hung down half-way to the ground.  Also one of the
native boys brought a tray with spirits, from which I judged by
various signs, old Marnham, who had already drunk his share at
dinner, had helped himself freely on the way.  Soon we were
arranged, Anscombe, who was to be my partner, opposite to me in
his long chair, and the game began.
</p><p>I forget what particular variant of cards it was we played,
though I know it admitted of high and progressive stakes.  At
first, however, these were quite moderate and we won, as I
suppose we were meant to do.  After half an hour or so Marnham
rose to help himself to brandy and water, a great deal of brandy
and very little water, while I took a nip of Hollands, and
Anscombe and Rodd filled their pipes.
</p><p>"I think this is getting rather slow," said Rodd to Anscombe.  "I
vote we put a bit more on."
</p><p>"As much as you like," answered Anscombe with a little drawl and
twinkle of the eye, which always showed that he was amused.
"Both Quatermain and I are born gamblers.  Don't look angry,
Quatermain, you know you are.  Only if we lose you will have to
take a cheque, for I have precious little cash."
</p><p>"I think that will be good enough," replied the doctor
quietly--"if you lose."
</p><p>So the stakes were increased to an amount that made my hair stand
up stiffer even than usual, and the game went on.  Behold! a
marvel came to pass.  How it happened I do not know, unless
Marnham had brought the wrong cards by mistake or had grown too
fuddled to understand his partner's telegraphic signals, which I,
being accustomed to observe, saw him make, not once but often,
still we won!  What is more, with a few set-backs, we went on
winning, till presently the sums written down to our credit, for
no actual cash passed, were considerable.  And all the while, at
the end of each bout Marnham helped himself to more brandy, while
the doctor grew more mad in a suppressed-thunder kind of a way.
For my part I became alarmed, especially as I perceived that
Anscombe was on the verge of breaking into open merriment, and
his legs being up I could not kick him under the table.
</p><p>"My partner ought to go to bed.  Don't you think we should stop?"
I said.
</p><p>"On the whole I do," replied Rodd, glowering at Marnham, who,
somewhat unsteadily, was engaged in wiping drops of brandy from
his long beard.
</p><p>"D----d if I do," exclaimed that worthy.  "When I was young and
played with gentlemen they always gave losers an opportunity of
revenge."
</p><p>"Then," replied Anscombe with a flash of his eyes, "let us try to
follow in the footsteps of the gentlemen with whom you played in
your youth.  I suggest that we double the stakes."
</p><p>"That's right!  That's the old form!" said Marnham.
</p><p>The doctor half rose from his chair, then sat down again.
Watching him, I concluded that he believed his partner, a
seasoned vessel, was not so drunk as he pretended to be, and
either in an actual or a figurative sense, had a card up his
sleeve.  If so, it remained there, for again we won; all the luck
was with us.
</p><p>"I am getting tired," drawled Anscombe.  "Lemon and water are not
sustaining.  Shall we stop?"
</p><p>"By Heaven! no," shouted Marnham, to which Anscombe replied that
if it was wished, he would play another hand, but no more.
</p><p>"All right," said Marnham, "but let it be for double or quits."
</p><p>He spoke quite quietly and seemed suddenly to have grown sober.
Now I think that Rodd made up his mind that he really was acting
and that he really had that card up his sleeve.  At any rate he
did not object.  I, however, was of a different opinion, having
often seen drunken men succumb to an access of sobriety under the
stress of excitement and remarked that it did not last long.
</p><p>"Do you really mean that?" I said, speaking for the first time
and addressing myself to the doctor.  "I don't quite know what
the sum involved is, but it must be large."
</p><p>"Of course," he answered.
</p><p>Then remembering that at the worst Anscombe stood to lose
nothing, I shrugged my shoulders and held my tongue.  It was
Marnham's deal, and although he was somewhat in the shadow of the
hanging lamp and the candles had guttered out, I distinctly saw
him play some hocus-pocus with the cards, but in the
circumstances made no protest.  As it chanced he must have
hocus-pocused them wrong, for though <u>his</u> hand was full of
trumps, Rodd held nothing at all.  The battle that ensued was
quite exciting, but the end of it was that an ace in the hand of
Anscombe, who really was quite a good player, did the business,
and we won again.
</p><p>In the rather awful silence that followed Anscombe remarked in
his cheerful drawl--
</p><p>"I'm not sure that my addition is quite right; we'll check that
in the morning, but I make out that you two gentlemen owe
Quatermain and myself #749 10s."
</p><p>Then the doctor broke out.
</p><p>"You accursed old fool," he hissed--there is no other word for
it--at Marnham.  "How are you going to pay all this money that
you have gambled away, drunken beast that you are!"
</p><p>"Easily enough, you felon," shouted Marnham.  "So," and thrusting
his hand into his pocket he pulled out a number of diamonds which
he threw upon the table, adding, "there's what will cover it
twice over, and there are more where they came from, as you know
well enough, my medical jailbird."
</p><p>"You dare to call me that," gasped the doctor in a voice laden
with fury, so intense that it had deprived him of his reason,
"you--you--murderer!  Oh! why don't I kill you as I shall some
day?" and lifting his glass, which was half full, he threw the
contents into Marnham's face.
</p><p>"That's a nice man for a prospective, son-in-law, isn't he?"
exclaimed the old scamp, as, seizing the brandy decanter, he
hurled it straight at Rodd's head, only missing him by an inch.
</p><p>"Don't you think you had both better go to bed, gentlemen?" I
inquired.  "You are saying things you might regret in the
morning."
</p><p>Apparently they did think it, for without another word they rose
and marched off in different directions to their respective
rooms, which I heard both of them lock.  For my part I collected
the I.O.U.'s; also the diamonds which still lay upon the table,
while Anscombe examined the cards.
</p><p>"Marked, by Jove!" he said.  "Oh! my dear Quatermain, never have I
had such an amusing evening in all my life."
</p><p>"Shut up, you silly idiot," I answered.  "There'll be murder done
over this business, and I only hope it won't be on us."
