<p><em>THE </em>thrusting of the mortally wounded pony’s nose against
the shoulder of the trapper’s horse warned both him and Herbert
Watrous of what was coming. The latter slipped his feet from the
stirrups, and was in the act of leaping to the ground, to attempt
to run the short distance to the entrance of the mission building,
when the broad right hand of Eph Bozeman slapped him in the broad
of the back, clutched his coat, and with one powerful wrench he
swung him out of the saddle sinking beneath him, and lifting him
over in front of himself on his own steed.</p>

<p>There was not the slightest slackening of speed on the part of
the doubly laden animal, who not only held his own, but headed
the procession as it dashed through the door, followed by the
other two, amid a storm of bullets, as Rickard and Slidham slammed
the door shut and fastened it in place.</p>

<p>The whole party was safe, without a scratch, and with only the
loss of a single animal.</p>

<p>They could hardly believe their good fortune, until their panting
steeds were brought to a halt and the riders slipped to the ground.</p>

<p>Then followed a general handshaking, and it would have been hard
to believe that anything like enmity had existed between the men
who showed such genuine pleasure at the escape of the little company
from the Apaches. But a common danger draws people together, and
Rickard and Slidham forgot that but a short time ago they had
agreed to return a youth to these same visitors for a certain
ransom.</p>

<p>The first thing done after a general exchange of congratulations
was on the part of the new arrivals. They made haste to the spring
of cool, refreshing water, where they quaffed their fill, their
ponies doing the same.</p>

<p>Rickard had made preparations for their coming. From his storehouse
of meal and meat he had prepared a nourishing and abundant meal
for all. Since there was no grass within the building, the horses
were fed with the grain, of which there was sufficient to last
several weeks by the exercise of frugality.</p>

<p>The animals having been attended to and the hunger and thirst
of the guests being satisfied, the company gathered in the small
room where Eph Bozeman had held his interview of the night before.
They crowded the place, but all found seats, and they conversed
as freely as if they had been friends for years.</p>

<p>"I made a bad break," said Rickard, with a laugh; "you’ll admit
that I worked that plan pretty well, but I didn’t count on the
boy giving me the slip at the last minute."</p>

<p>"Where do you suppose he has gone?" asked Strubell, who did most
of the talking for his side, the others listening attentively
to every word that was spoken.</p>

<p>"He must have been on the watch when Eph come in; we were all
three in this room, talking the matter over, when he slipped out
with his pony and has gone, who can say where?"</p>

<p>"It doesn’t look as if the Apaches had caught him."</p>

<p>"No; I thought they might have done so, but there would have
been an outcry if that took place. We wouldn’t have heard the
sound of his horse as he rode off, but he would have used his
rifle and pistol before allowing himself to be taken, and we must
have heard them. He was the pluckiest fellow I ever saw."</p>

<p>"That’s so," added Herbert; "Nick Ribsam was a brave boy; he
gave me the biggest trouncing I ever had when he wasn’t more than
half my size, and there’s no Indian that can down him without
having the worst fight of his life."</p>

<p>"What I don’t understand," continued Strubell, "is why he should
wait until everything was in the best shape for him, and then
slip off and knock our plan endways."</p>

<p>"Didn’t he have any chance of gettin’ away when you was on the
road here?" inquired Lattin.</p>

<p>"Well, we watched pretty close, for we knew what he was thinking
of; Harman and I were never asleep at the same time, and we didn’t
let him have his gun or pistol while on the road."</p>

<p>Herbert’s heart burned with indignation at these words, but he
kept silent. He knew now why Nick had remained passive so long.
He was too wise to dash away from his captors and ride out on
the open prairie, exposed to innumerable dangers, without a weapon
at command. Had he been allowed to retain them he would have made
things lively for Bell Rickard.</p>

<p>Rickard stated further that they had no field glass at command,
like their pursuers, so that they never caught sight of them,
though well convinced they were on their trail. Consequently Nick
had not the incentive that would have been his had he felt any
assurance of meeting his friends if he fled eastward.</p>

<p>"When we arrived here," continued the horse thief, "and we knew
the Apaches were close outside, why, we let him have his weapons,
for it looked as if he might be able to help us against the redskins."</p>

<p>"Of course when he saw Eph come through the door and join you
in this room," said Strubell, "he had no idea that he came from
us; if he had he would have acted differently——"</p>

<p>"No, he wouldn’t either; you don’t know what you’re talkin’ ’bout."</p>

<p>It was the old trapper who uttered this exclamation, after he
had held his peace for several minutes. All looked at him wonderingly,
for it was not clear what he meant by his abrupt remark. His little
eyes shone with a peculiar light, and could his mouth have been
seen, a singular smile would have been observed playing around
it.</p>

<p>"Boys," added Eph, straightening up on his seat as he saw every
gaze fixed upon him, "shall I tell you something?"</p>

<p>The expression of general interest convinced him that no one
could be heard with greater pleasure.</p>

<p>"Last night, after passin’ out the door, a quar idea got into
my head. Instead of startin’ on a run to get back to you folks,
I stooped down and passed my hands over the ground all round the
door. And what do you s’pose I found? Why, thar war the prints
of several horses goin’ in, <em>but thar warn’t a single one comin’
out</em>!"</p>

<p>He paused a moment for this astounding announcement to produce
its effect. Strubell was the first to catch its full meaning.</p>

<p>"Are you sure of that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"As sure as I’m sittin’ here this minute. What does it mean,
tharfore and consequently? Why, that that younker came in with
Bell and Harman, but that he <em>haint gone out, which the same
means that he’s inside of this buildin’ and aint fifty feet off
this very minute</em>, and if thar’s anyone here that don’t b’lieve
me, all he’s got to do is to look through that door yonder and
tell me whether he don’t see the grinnin’ younker standin’ thar
this very minute."</p>

<p>It so happened that as Eph sat he faced the opening of the little
room, and, since every eye was fixed on him, their backs were
turned in the other direction. All wheeled like a flash and saw
Nick Ribsam in the act of entering the apartment, his honest face
expanded into one broad smile, while his hand was extended to
greet his old acquaintances.</p>

<p>Herbert Watrous stared with open mouth, unable to believe it
was not a dream, until his hand was clasped by that of the best
friend he had, outside of his own folks, in the world. Then he
saw that it was reality, and greeted the good fellow with a delight
which touched even the hearts of Bell Rickard and Harman Slidham.</p>

<p>Enough has been hinted about Nick Ribsam to give the reader a
general idea of his experience from the night he was made prisoner
by the horse thieves and carried westward into New Mexico. Herbert
was correct in his surmise as to why he made no effort to escape
while on the long journey. With no firearms at command, with no
knowledge of where his friends were, and believing that his captors
were only manœuvring for a ransom, he would have disproved all
faith in his good sense had he seized any one of the several occasions
for parting company with those whom he despised.</p>

<p>He had no suspicion of the business which brought Eph Bozeman
to the building, else he would not have played the little deception
he did on his captors; but when requested to betake himself to
some other part of the structure during the interview, he obeyed,
passing into the room which adjoined the one where the ponies
had been placed.</p>

<p>Here he struck a match that he might investigate his surroundings.
The first thing that caught his attention was a door, which he
did not notice until he was at the further end of the apartment,
and then he would not have observed it had not his gaze struck
it in a peculiar manner.</p>

<p>A brief examination showed that it was intended by the parties
who built the mission house as a secret storehouse or retreat
in a last emergency. It was so ingeniously constructed that the
space occupied was cut off from three other apartments, and the
missing portion was not likely to be noticed unless suspicion
happened to be turned that way.</p>

<p>The room was long and narrow, and there was space at one end
for a horse, ventilation being secured by means of several slits
that were cleverly concealed from view. Of course it would not
have required a close search for anyone to discover it from the
outside, but that search was not made.</p>

<p>The moment Nick stumbled upon the retreat, the idea of a trick
came to him. He led Jack into the space, slipped out and unfastened
the door to give the impression that he had passed through it,
and then returned and ensconced himself within.</p>

<p>The reflection came to him that he had done an exceedingly risky
thing in leaving the door unfastened, but he reasoned that he
would soon be missed and the open avenue discovered. Then, too,
what band of Apaches, or white persons for that matter, would
dream of such a piece of negligence on the part of three persons
who knew of their danger?</p>

<p>While debating the matter with himself, and when he was on the
point of going out to secure the door again, he fell asleep and
did not open his eyes until after the arrival of his friends.
The reports of the rifles were so dulled by the intervening walls
that they had not disturbed him at all.</p>

<p>Eph Bozeman was convinced of the presence of the youth within
the building on his failure to find any hoof prints leading outward
from the door. He deemed it best to say nothing of this to his
companions, since he wanted to give them a surprise, and he did
it beyond question.</p>

<p>What pleased the old trapper was the certainty that Bell Rickard,
after all, must lose the thousand dollars, for under the circumstances
he had no legal claim to it, inasmuch as Nick had escaped from
his custody, and he confessed himself unable to perform his part
of the contract.</p>

<p>Our friends were one horse short, and the loss was a severe one.
It was decided to stay where they were until the Apaches grew
tired of the siege, and communication could be opened with other
parties. Jim-John and his companion were supposed to be making
their way toward the same destination with the pack horses, one
of which could be turned to account in case nothing better presented
itself.</p>

<p>But at this interesting juncture Bell Rickard, of all others,
solved the difficulty in an unexpected manner. He insisted that
he had come by his own horse fairly, and he asked the privilege
of furnishing it to Herbert Watrous. He said he would wait where
he was until the arrival of Jim-John and Brindage, and accept
one of the pack horses in exchange. This was finally agreed to,
and the transaction was probably the first honest one of the kind
in which the fellow had taken part in a long time.</p>

<p>On the second day all signs of the Apaches disappeared. They
had carried off the bodies of those who had fallen, and sought
more inviting fields for their cruel work.</p>

<p>Instead of pushing on to California, as Nick and Herbert originally
intended, they decided to return to San Antonio with Strubell
and Lattin. Herbert had fully recovered his health, and, to tell
the truth, both boys were homesick. They felt there was no place
like their own homes, and the society of their loved ones. They
had been granted that which led them across Texas, and why go
further?</p>

<p>It is not necessary to give the incidents of their return to
the quaint old town of San Antonio, although the journey was marked
by many interesting incidents. They arrived there without serious
mishap, and, parting company with the Texans and the old trapper,
who was liberally rewarded for his services, Nick, just one week
later, clasped his father, mother, and sister Nellie in his arms.
Herbert stayed a day with him, and then hastened to his home in
New York City, where it need not be said he was welcomed with
gratitude and affection.</p>

<p>And here the history of Nick Ribsam and Herbert Watrous properly
ends. That they will be the same warm, trustful, loving friends
through life need not be said, and the good seed sown by the honest
young Pennsylvanian in the heart of his city associate will spring
up and bear a blessed fruit, the full degree of which can never
be known until they enter upon the life to come.</p>

<p>
<em>THE END</em>.
