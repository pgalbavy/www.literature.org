<p>"I'll follow him to the right, and you, Larry, go to the left;
we'll have him then, sure."</p>

<p>"All right; it's mesilf that will bate ye, fur all ye're the
swiftest runner in Kintucky."</p>

<p>"There isn't a minute to lose; move faster, Larry!"</p>

<p>"Do you attind to your own business, and lave Larry Murphy to
himsilf."</p>

<p>The words were uttered quickly, for the two youths were eager
and excited. They had caught sight of an enormous bear a few minutes
before, as he lumbered into the canebrake in the direction of
the torrent which swept furiously toward the Ohio. The young Irishman
happened to be a few paces in advance of his companion, Wharton
Edwards, and took a flying shot at the brute. Whether he struck
him or not was uncertain. The probabilities were that, despite
his skill with the rifle, he only scratched his bulky body, or
missed him altogether. Before Wharton could bring his weapon to
bear, bruin was beyond reach for the time.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that the fleet-footed youth bounded to
the side of his Irish friend and urged him to hurry to the left,
while he circled in the other direction. One of them must head
off the game, and it mattered little which did it provided it
was done.</p>

<p>Larry Murphy was as ardent in his pursuit as his comrade, and
was hopeful of getting the prize away from him. Pausing, therefore,
only long enough to exchange the words quoted, he was off like
a deer.</p>

<p>"That young man houlds a high opinion of himsilf," he muttered,
as he crashed forward, "and I've saan worse fellys than Whart
Edwards. He can bate all creation running, but I'm hoping that
he may thrip his feet so as to give mesilf a show&#11834;"</p>

<p>It was poetical justice, perhaps, that the fate which the young
Irishman wished might overtake his friend claimed him for his
own, for, while the words were in his mouth, a wire-like vine
on the ground did the mischief. It wound round his ankle like
an angry black snake, and he sprawled forward on his hands and
knees, his gun flying several feet from his hands.</p>

<p>"Bad luck to it!" he growled, climbing to his feet; "that's just
the sthyle I used to thrip up the spalpeens. I'm onsartin whether
me neck is broke off or not, but I'll have to lave it to find
out till this little job is over."</p>

<p>The fall was so violent that he limped for a few paces, and his
speed was lessened; but the stream was not far off, and the rugged
lad was quick to rally from his discomfiture.</p>

<p>"Begorrah, but I've got the laugh on Whart," he exclaimed, a
minute later, as he caught sight of a dark object among the trees;
"that shot of mine landed the beast, and knowing that it's mesilf
that's entitled to him, he has left Wharton and turned off there
to wait for me to finish him."</p>

<p>If this quaint faith were genuine, Larry did not trust it farther
than he was compelled to. Instead of waiting till he could draw
nearer and secure a truer shot, he stopped abruptly, brought his
heavy rifle to a level, sighted quickly but carefully, and let
fly.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about his having hit the mark this time. He
was a good shot, and the distance was too slight for him to miss.
Forgetting the law of the hunter, which requires him to reload
his discharged gun before moving from his tracks, Larry lowered
his weapon, and driving his broad honest face through the wreath
of smoke before it could lift from the muzzle of his rifle, he
dashed forward toward the game to which he was sure he had just
given the finishing touch.</p>

<p>In his excitement, and with his partly obscured view, he did
not observe that the bear remained immovable. If he had noticed
it, he would have concluded that the beast had been mortally wounded
by the first shot and had collapsed while on the way to the stream
of water.</p>

<p>"Now Whart will be filled wid jilousy whin he finds that the
bear surrindered to me. Had it been him that come in sight of
the beast he wouldn't have stopped, but obsarving that it was
mesilf, he threw up his hands and&#11834;"</p>

<p>Larry paused in dismay. Crashing through the brush, he stopped
close to his supposed prize, and found that, instead of its being
the game he had in mind, it was the lower portion of an immense
tree that had probably lain for years on the ground. It bore some
resemblance to a prostrate animal, but the youthful hunter never
could have made the mistake except for his flurried condition.</p>

<p>"Wurrah, wurrah, now, but that was a bad miss," he muttered,
grinning at his own blunder. "I don't see any necessity for acquainting
Whart wid all the sarcumstances, but if the stump doesn't say
anything about it, I'll hold me pace."</p>

<p>The slip took away from the youth about all the hope he had felt
until then of bagging the bear. He knew at the time that young
Edwards gave him the better chance, for it was just like the magnanimous
fellow to do that thing, and Larry had lost it through his own
stupidity.</p>

<p>He listened for a few moments, uncertain which way to move or
turn. There seemed little use in trying to regain his lost opportunities,
but the doughty fellow mortally hated to give up the peculiar
contest without another effort.</p>

<p>He could hear the dull roar of the torrent as it poured over
the falls only a short way off, and he fancied once that he detected
the rush of some swiftly-moving body through the wood. Of this,
however, he could not be certain, because of the interfering noise
of the stream.</p>

<p>"Whist, now, but I forgot the same!" he suddenly added, as he
recalled that it was an empty weapon which he held in his hand.</p>

<p>"S'pose now that that cratur should turn 'round to make my acquaintance;
I would have to ask him to have the kindness to wait awhile until
I could get the gun in shape, and he would be mane 'nough to objict."</p>

<p>Despite Larry's fondness for talking, either with a companion
or himself, and despite the apparent absurdity of many things
he said, he wasted no time when it was of value, and he committed
few errors of judgment.</p>

<p>The proper amount of powder was poured from the unstopped horn
into the palm of his hand and sent rattling down the inclined
barrel of his heavy gun. Then a bullet, clasped in a small square
of oiled cloth, was rammed tightly upon the charge; the yellow
flint was drawn back and the pan filled with the black grains;
then the hammer was carefully lowered, and the old-fashioned weapon
was ready for use.</p>

<p>At that moment the report of a rifle broke the stillness, and
the startled Larry, glancing around, exclaimed in a guarded undertone:</p>

<p>"I b'leave Whart is in trouble."</p>
