<p>Finding himself face to face with Mrs. Ladybug one night in Farmer
Green's meadow, Freddie Firefly noticed, even before she spoke, that the
little lady was not in a cheerful mood. In fact, she frowned at him
darkly and pointed one of her knitting needles straight at him as she
began to speak.
</p>
<p>"You're terribly careless with that light of yours," she said. "People
are always warning me that my house is on fire and telling me that I'd
better hurry home. Now--" she added--"now I think I've discovered the
reason why my friends are forever worrying about fire. No doubt when
they give me such advice they have seen you prowling around my house
with that light of yours; and they think that if you haven't already set
my house on fire, you're just a-going to."
</p><p>When Freddie Firefly saw that Mrs. Ladybug was making Benjamin Bat's
mistake of thinking that his light could start a blaze, he had to smile.
</p><p>"Nonsense!" he cried. "I'm always very careful, Mrs. Ladybug, when I'm
near your house. You know that I wouldn't want your charming children to
burn up."
</p><p>And now Mrs. Ladybug pointed her other knitting needle at Freddie.
</p><p>"Well, if you're not careless, you're silly, anyhow," she snapped. "I
wouldn't object so much to your light if only you'd put it to some good
use. But as long as I've known you--and that's several weeks--I've never
seen you do anything but caper about the meadow and dance." And then
Mrs. Ladybug began to knit furiously, as if to show Freddie Firefly that
she was never idle, even if she did spend a good deal of time away from
home. "Do you intend always to fritter your nights away as you do now?"
she inquired.
</p><p>"What else could I do? I should like to know--" Freddie began.
</p><p>"Why not use your light in some kind of work?" Mrs. Ladybug asked him.
</p><p>"What work, I should like to know--" Freddie said. And since Mrs.
Ladybug did not at once answer him, he added: "I don't believe you can
suggest anything--can you?"
</p><p>"Oh, yes, I can!" she declared quickly. "I was thinking. That's why I
didn't reply sooner. Probably you don't know that I have helped many
youngsters to begin to work. For instance, it was I that told Daddy
Longlegs to help Farmer Green with his harvesting." Little Mrs. Ladybug
felt so proud of herself that she dropped a stitch without noticing it.
</p><p>"Daddy Longlegs! HE'S not young!" Freddie Firefly exclaimed.
</p><p>"Oh! yes, he is! He's not so old as you think," Mrs. Ladybug replied.
"He's just about your age. And if he can work, you certainly can."
</p><p>"But I didn't know that Daddy Longlegs was working for Farmer Green,"
Freddie Firefly said.
</p><p>"He tried to, one day. But the wind blew too hard. ... It wasn't really
Daddy's fault," Mrs. Ladybug explained. "And you ought not to attempt to
work on windy nights, either," she went on. "For your light might go
out, and then there'd be a terrible accident."
