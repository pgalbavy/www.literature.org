<p>Through the entire night, with now and then an occasional halt
of a few minutes each, the fugitives&mdash;for they may now properly
be termed such&mdash;continued their journey. When day broke, they
halted in a small valley through which a small, sparkling stream
made its way. On either side, it was surrounded by dark overhanging
forest-trees and heavier undergrowth, through which none but the
eagle eye of the hunter or savage, could discover their retreat.</p>

<p>Seth, when they first halted, made off in the woods, and in the
course of a half-hour returned with a large fowl. The feathers
were plucked from this, a fire kindled, and in a few moments it
was cooked. It furnished all with a hearty, substantial and nourishing
breakfast&mdash;what all needed. After this, a short consultation was
held, when it was determined that they should halt for an hour
or two. Several blankets were spread upon the green sward, as
a bed for Ina, and in ten minutes she was sound asleep.</p>

<p>Our friends had decided upon making their homeward journey upon
foot for several reasons, any of which was sufficient to influence
them. In the first place, their course would be much shorter and
more direct, and was really attended with less danger; and even
if they desired to take to the river, there were no means at hand
to do it.</p>

<p>"By gracious!" remarked Seth, after a few minute’s deep thought,
"I feel, boys, as though we’re to run into a scrape before we
get home. I tell <em>yeou</em> I do."</p>

<p>"And I do, too," added Haldidge. "I don’t know why it is, and
yet I believe there is reason for it. If there is any chance for
them Mohawks to play the game of <em>tit for tat</em>, they’ll
do it; you can make up your mind to that."</p>

<p>"Do you think the chance is given them?" queried Haverland.</p>

<p>"I am afraid we can’t help it, any way we choose to fix it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? What do you refer to?"</p>

<p>"You see, them Ingins can’t help knowing the way we’ll have to
take to reach home, and what is to hinder them from getting ahead
of us and giving us a little trouble?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all, that’s the fact. Our utmost vigilance will be
required at every step. Don’t you think, Seth, that one of us
should act in the capacity of scout?"</p>

<p>"I <em>know</em> it; not only one, but two. As soon as we start,
I shall shoot ahead and pilot you along, while one of you must
flourish in the rear to announce any new visitors. This is the
only way we can ever expect to move along with dignity."</p>

<p>"What course do you suppose the savages will take?" asked Graham.</p>

<p>"I guess they ain’t in the neighborhood, though it’s darned hard
to tell where they are. You can make up your mind that they’ll
show themselves before we get any great distance ahead. They’ll
be dodging round in the woods till they find out where we are,
and then they’ll use their wits to draw us into ambush, and I
can tell <em>yeou</em>, too, that cuter ones than we have walked
right into the infarnal things."</p>

<p>An hour later, when preparations were making for resuming their
journey, Ina awoke. She was greatly refreshed by the sleep thus
obtained, and the others felt cheered and hopeful at the prospect
of a rapid march for the day.</p>

<p>The burden and responsibility of this small band of adventurers
naturally devolved upon Haldidge and Seth. Haverland, although
a thorough hunter and woodsman, had had little or no experience
in Indian warfare, and accordingly showed himself to be devoid
of that suspicious watchfulness which makes up the success of
the frontier ranger. As for Graham, he was suspicious enough,
but he lacked also the great teacher&mdash;experience. Seth and Haldidge
thus thrown together, rapidly consulted and determined in all
cases the precautionary measures to be adopted. In the present
instance, it was decided that Haldidge should linger some hundred
yards in the rear, and use all the opportunities thus afforded
of watching the actions or approach of their enemies. The same
duty was imposed upon Seth, with the additional certainty upon
his part, that the entire safety of the company rested with him.</p>

<p>Haverland and Graham generally walked side by side, with Ina
between them, and as watchful as though they had none but themselves
to depend upon. They seldom indulged in conversation, except now
and then to exchange a few words or inquiries.</p>

<p>As Seth Jones was well satisfied in his own mind, that the part
of danger was held by him, we will follow his adventures. After
emerging from the valley, in which the whites had encamped, their
way for a considerable distance led through the unbroken forest,
without hill or vale, and pretty thickly crowded with bushy, yielding
undergrowth. Had a person chanced to cross the path of Seth, the
only evidence he would have had of the presence of a human being,
would have been the snapping of a twig now and then, or the flitting
of his form like a shadow from tree to tree, and perhaps the shrill,
bird-like whistle as he signaled to those in the rear.</p>

<p>Through the forenoon, nothing occurred to excite suspicion upon
his part, but at the period mentioned, he arrived at a point where
his alarm was excited at once. The place offered such advantages
for an Indian ambush, that he gave the signal for those behind
to halt, and determined to make a thorough reconnoissance of the
whole locality before passing through it. The spot referred to,
had the appearance of having formerly been the bed of some large-sized
lake, the water of which having dried up years before, left a
rich, productive soil which was now covered over with the rankest
undergrowth and vegetation. Not a tree of any size appeared. The
hollow, or valley, was so much depressed that from the stand-point
of Seth, he obtained a perfect view of the whole portion. It was
of about a third of a mile in breadth, and perhaps a couple of
miles in length.</p>

<p>Seth stood a long time, running his eye over it, scanning every
spot where it seemed likely an enemy might lurk. Hardly a point
escaped his keen vision.</p>

<p>It was while he stood thus, eagerly scanning the valley, that
his looks were suddenly attracted toward a point near the center
of the valley, from which a faint, bluish wreath of smoke was
curling upward. This puzzled our friend greatly. He possessed
the curious, investigating habits so generally ascribed to his
race, and his curiosity was wonderfully excited by this occurrence.
That there was some design in it, not understood yet, he was well
satisfied, and he determined that, before allowing those behind
him to venture into the valley, he would gain all knowledge possible
of it. His first step was to take his own trail backward until
he reached Haverland and Graham, to whom he imparted his intention.
This done, he set forward again.</p>

<p>Having arrived at the point where he had first discovered this
suspicious appearance, he paused again for further consideration.
The smoke was still visible, rising very slowly in the clear air,
and making so slight an appearance that even his experienced eye
searched a long time for it. Seth watched for a while, until he
felt that he could not understand the meaning of it without venturing
into the valley. This conclusion arrived at, he hesitated no longer,
but descended and entered at once the luxuriant growth.</p>

<p>When fairly within it, he made a detour to the right, so as to
pass around the fire, and to avoid the path that one unsuspicious
of danger would be apt to follow. As he made his way slowly and
cautiously forward, he paused at intervals and listened intently.
Sometimes he bent his ear to the ground and lay for minutes at
a time. But as yet, not the slightest sound had been heard. Finally
he judged that he must be near the fire that had excited his apprehensions.
The snapping of a burning ember guided him, and a few minutes
later he stood within sight of it.</p>

<p>Here he met a sight that chilled him with horror!</p>

<p>Some wretched human being was bound to a tree and had been burned
to death. He was painted black as death, his scalped head drooped
forward, so that, from where Seth stood, it was impossible to
distinguish his features; but he saw enough to make him shudder
at the awful fate he had so narrowly escaped. Every vestige of
flesh was burnt off to the knees, and the bones, white and glistening,
dangled to the crisp and blackened members above! The hands, tied
behind, had passed through the fire unscathed, but every other
part of the body was literally roasted! The smoke in reality was
the smoke from this human body, and the stench which was now horrible,
had been noticed by Seth long before he suspected the cause.</p>

<p>"Heavens and earth!" he muttered to himself, "this is the first
time I ever saw a person burnt at the stake, and I hope to God
it will be the last time. Can he be a <em>white man</em>?"</p>

<p>After some cautious maneuvering, he gained a point from which
he could obtain a view of the face, and he experienced considerable
relief when he discovered that it was not a white man. He was
probably some unfortunate Indian, belonging to a hostile tribe,
who had been captured by his enemies, and upon whom they had thus
wreaked their vengeance. Whether he was a Mohawk or the member
of another tribe, it was impossible for Seth, under the circumstances,
to tell. But what was singular and unaccountable to Seth, was,
that there appeared to be no other savages in the vicinity. He
knew it was not their custom to leave a prisoner thus, and the
very fact of their being absent upon the present occasion, made
him doubly cautious and suspicious.</p>

<p>It was while he stood meditating upon the terrible scene before
him, that he was startled by the report of Haldidge’s rifle. He
was satisfied that it was his as it was from that direction, and
he could not be mistaken in the report. He had noticed it during
the conflict the night before, as having a peculiar sound entirely
different from either his own or the savages’. This was a new
source of wonder and perplexity. He was completely puzzled by
the extraordinary turn affairs were taking. Some unusual cause
must have discharged Haldidge’s rifle. What it was he could only
conjecture.</p>

<p>Still doubtful and cautious, he determined to reconnoiter his
own position before returning. Stooping almost to the earth, he
made his way stealthily around to the opposite side of the fire.
Here he stretched out flat upon the earth and bent his ear to
the ground. A faint tremor was heard. He raised his head and heard
the brushing of some body through the wood. The next moment, five
Mohawk warriors, in all the horrid panoply of war paint, stepped
into the open space in front of the Indian who had been burnt
at the stake.</p>

<p>The report of the rifle appeared to be the cause of the apprehension
among them. They conversed earnestly in a low tone at first, gesticulating
violently, without noticing in the least the heart-sickening spectacle
before them. Seth was satisfied that they had no suspicions of
his own proximity, for they gradually spoke louder until he managed
to overhear the most of what they said. As he expected, it was
the rifle report. They seemed to understand that it had not been
discharged by one of their own number, and were afraid that their
presence had been discovered. Seth learned further that there
were at least a dozen Indians in the neighborhood, every one of
whom were led thither by the one object.</p>

<p>Consequently he must have missed the others entirely in his movements,
or else they were in the rear and had been discovered by Haldidge.
That the latter was the case, seemed more than probable. A collision
in all probability had occurred between them and the hunter, and
Seth felt that his presence was needed. Accordingly he turned
to retrace his steps.</p>

<p>His presence was indeed required, for danger, dark and threatening,
surrounded the little band of whites.</p>
