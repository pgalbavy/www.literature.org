<p>"If you think it best that I shall stay at home, I will do so,"
said the young man, striving hard to repress the disappointment
the words caused him.</p>

<p>"No; you shall not," the wife hastened to interpose; "everything
has been arranged for you to go with your uncle."</p>

<p>"Was there ever a wife like you?" asked the captain admiringly;
"there is more pluck in that little frame of yours, Edna, than
in any one of my men. Very well; Avon will go with us, but I can
tell you, I shall be uneasy until I get back again."</p>

<p>"We have neighbors," she continued, still busy with her sewing,
"and if we need help, can get it."</p>

<p>"I declare," observed the captain grimly, "I forgot that; Jim
Kelton's cabin is only eight miles to the south, and Dick Halpine's
is but ten miles to the east; if the redskins do molest you, you
have only to slip in next door and get all the help you want."</p>

<p>As we have said, it was a chilly night in early spring. The moon
was hidden by clouds, so that one could see but a short distance
on the open prairie. A fitful wind was blowing, adding to the
discomfort of outdoors, and causing the interior of the cabin
to be the more comfortable by contrast.</p>

<p>But a few rods to the westward was a growth of mesquite bush,
in which the two mustangs that the captain and his nephew expected
to ride were wandering at will. The animals were so trained that
either would come at the whistle of his master, who, therefore,
felt sure of finding him at command when wanted&mdash;that is, provided
no outsiders disturbed him. This mesquite growth, consisting of
open bushes which attain a height of eight or ten feet, extended
over an area of several acres, affording the best kind of hiding-place
for man or animal.</p>

<p>The signs of their old enemies, the Comanches, to which Captain
Shirril referred, had been noticed by his men, including young
Avon Burnet. They had seen the smoke of camp-fires in the distance,
had observed parties of horsemen galloping to and fro, and, in
fact, had exchanged shots with the dusky marauders when they ventured
too near in the darkness.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that these fellows were on the watch
for a chance to stampede the cattle, but the vigilance of the
cowboys prevented that disaster. Most of the latter believed the
Comanches would hover on their flank, probably until the beasts
were well out of Texas and far over the line in the Indian Nation
or Kansas. That they would stay behind to avenge themselves upon
the wife and servant of the captain was not to be believed. The
wife was equally certain on that point, so their leader suffered
himself to be persuaded that his misgivings were groundless.</p>

<p>But this feeling of security, which was felt by all, suffered
a startling interruption.</p>

<p>When Captain Shirril erected his humble cabin several years before,
he did not forget the danger to which he was certain to be exposed
from the Indians. The wooden walls were heavy and bullet-proof,
and the door was capable of being barred so strongly at an instant's
warning, that nothing less than a battering ram could drive it
inward. The windows were too narrow to admit the passage of the
most elongated redskin that ever wormed himself into the camp
of an enemy. The structure was long and low, with an upper story,
in which the cowboys slept whenever it was advisable to do so.</p>

<p>"You have had so much experience with this kind of business,"
said the captain, "that I suppose I ought not to feel uneasy,
even if I knew you would be attacked, for there are two guns here
ready for you and Dinah, and you have both proven that you understand
how to use the weapons; there is plenty of ammunition, too, and
since you have had full warning of what may possibly take place&#11834;"</p>

<p>At that instant the resounding report of a rifle broke the stillness
on the outside, there was a jingle of glass, and the pipe which
Captain Shirril had held in his mouth while talking was shattered
as if from the explosion of a torpedo within the bowl.</p>

<p>Nothing could have shown the wonderful training of this little
family in the perils of the frontier more strikingly than did
their actions at this moment. Not a word was spoken, but almost
at the instant the alarming occurrence took place, the captain,
his wife, and his nephew leaped backward with lightning-like quickness.
The movement took the three out of range of the two windows at
the front of the house, with the door midway between, those being
the only openings on the lower floor.</p>

<p>Dinah happened to be at the extreme rear, where she was safe
for the time. She was about to advance, when checked by the crash
of the window pane and the crack of the rifle.</p>

<p>"For de Lawd's sake," she exclaimed, "de warmints hab come!"</p>

<p>"So they have," replied the captain, rising upright from his
crouching posture, "and see what they have done!"</p>

<p>He held up the stem of his pipe, which he had kept between his
teeth during the exciting moments, with such a grim expression
of woe that, despite the frightful incident, his wife and even
Avon smiled.</p>

<p>"It is a pity indeed," she said, "you will have to use your new
one, and I know how much <em>that</em> will pain you."</p>

<p>"They shall pay for this," he added with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>Fortunately the rifles of himself and nephew were leaning in
the corner, where they could be readily seized without exposing
themselves to another treacherous shot. The men laid hands on
them at once.</p>

<p>The weapons were of the repeating kind, and among the best that
money could buy in San Antonio.</p>

<p>The two guns belonging to Mrs. Shirril and their servant rested
together on the deer's prongs over the mantel, and, to reach them,
one must expose himself to another shot from the outside.</p>

<p>Following the rifle report, the sound of horses' hoofs were heard
galloping rapidly around the cabin. The captain listened intently
for a moment, holding one hand aloft as a signal for the others
to keep silent.</p>

<p>"There's fully a dozen of them," he said a minute later in a
low voice.</p>

<p>"But they know you and Avon are here," added his wife, who was
standing motionless just behind him, without any evidence of excitement
except that her face was a shade paler than usual.</p>

<p>"I should think so, judging from that," he replied, spitting
the stem of his pipe upon the floor; "but I must get those guns
for you."</p>

<p>"Don't think of it," she persisted, laying her hand on his shoulder;
"you will surely be shot, and there's no need of them yet."</p>

<p>"You may as well begin at once; you haven't had any practice
for months."</p>

<p>Gently removing the hand of his wife, whom he loved as he did
his life, the captain, holding his own gun in hand, began moving
stealthily across the floor toward the fireplace. Had he been
on his feet, he must have been observed by anyone in the position
of the savage that had fired the shot which was so well-nigh fatal,
but, while so close to the floor, he would not be seen by any
Comanche unless he was quite close to the window.</p>

<p>The redskin might and might not be there: <em>that</em> risk
must be taken, or the guns would have to be left alone for the
time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shirril was more disturbed than ever, for she knew as well
as did her husband the risk he ran, but she knew, too, that, when
he once decided to do a thing, it was idle to seek to restrain
him.</p>

<p>The burning wood threw an illumination through the room which
rendered any other light unnecessary, and the captain could not
have been in clearer view had the midday sun been shining. Nevertheless
he crept slowly forward, until in front of the fireplace. Then
he paused to consider which of two methods he had in mind was
the better for obtaining the weapons.</p>

<p>The Comanches were still circling back and forth on the outside,
uttering their whoops and firing their guns at intervals, though
the latter consisted of blind shooting, and was meant to terrify
the defenders, since none of the bullets found its way through
either of the windows.</p>

<p>Captain Shirril took but a few seconds to decide upon his course
of action.</p>
