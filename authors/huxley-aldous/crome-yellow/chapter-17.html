<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Ivor brought his hands down with a bang on to the final chord
of his rhapsody. There was just a hint in that triumphant harmony
that the seventh had been struck along with the octave by the
thumb of the left hand; but the general effect of splendid noise
emerged clearly enough. Small details matter little so long as
the general effect is good. And, besides, that hint of the seventh
was decidedly modern. He turned round in his seat and tossed the
hair back out of his eyes.</p>

<p>"There," he said. "That’s the best I can do for you, I’m afraid."</p>

<p>Murmurs of applause and gratitude were heard, and Mary, her large
china eyes fixed on the performer, cried out aloud, "Wonderful!"
and gasped for new breath as though she were suffocating.</p>

<p>Nature and fortune had vied with one another in heaping on Ivor
Lombard all their choicest gifts. He had wealth and he was perfectly
independent. He was good looking, possessed an irresistible charm
of manner, and was the hero of more amorous successes than he
could well remember. His accomplishments were extraordinary for
their number and variety. He had a beautiful untrained tenor voice;
he could improvise, with a startling brilliance, rapidly and loudly,
on the piano. He was a good amateur medium and telepathist, and
had a considerable first-hand knowledge of the next world. He
could write rhymed verses with an extraordinary rapidity. For
painting symbolical pictures he had a dashing style, and if the
drawing was sometimes a little weak, the colour was always pyrotechnical.
He excelled in amateur theatricals and, when occasion offered,
he could cook with genius. He resembled Shakespeare in knowing
little Latin and less Greek. For a mind like his, education seemed
supererogatory. Training would only have destroyed his natural
aptitudes.</p>

<p>"Let’s go out into the garden," Ivor suggested. "It’s a wonderful
night."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mr. Scogan, "but I for one prefer these still
more wonderful arm-chairs." His pipe had begun to bubble oozily
every time he pulled at it. He was perfectly happy.</p>

<p>Henry Wimbush was also happy. He looked for a moment over his
pince-nez in Ivor’s direction and then, without saying anything,
returned to the grimy little sixteenth-century account books which
were now his favourite reading. He knew more about Sir Ferdinando’s
household expenses than about his own.</p>

<p>The outdoor party, enrolled under Ivor’s banner, consisted of
Anne, Mary, Denis, and, rather unexpectedly, Jenny. Outside it
was warm and dark; there was no moon. They walked up and down
the terrace, and Ivor sang a Neapolitan song: "Stretti, stretti"&mdash;close,
close&mdash;with something about the little Spanish girl to follow.
The atmosphere began to palpitate. Ivor put his arm round Anne’s
waist, dropped his head sideways onto her shoulder, and in that
position walked on, singing as he walked. It seemed the easiest,
the most natural, thing in the world. Denis wondered why he had
never done it. He hated Ivor.</p>

<p>"Let’s go down to the pool," said Ivor. He disengaged his embrace
and turned round to shepherd his little flock. They made their
way along the side of the house to the entrance of the yew-tree
walk that led down to the lower garden. Between the blank precipitous
wall of the house and the tall yew trees the path was a chasm
of impenetrable gloom. Somewhere there were steps down to the
right, a gap in the yew hedge. Denis, who headed the party, groped
his way cautiously; in this darkness, one had an irrational fear
of yawning precipices, of horrible spiked obstructions. Suddenly
from behind him he heard a shrill, startled, "Oh!" and then a
sharp, dry concussion that might have been the sound of a slap.
After that, Jenny’s voice was heard pronouncing, "I am going back
to the house." Her tone was decided, and even as she pronounced
the words she was melting away into the darkness. The incident,
whatever it had been, was closed. Denis resumed his forward groping.
From somewhere behind Ivor began to sing again, softly:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Phillis plus avare que tendre

</p>
<p>
Ne gagnant rien à refuser,

</p>
<p>
Un jour exigea à Silvandre

</p>
<p>
Trente moutons pour un baiser."

</p>
</div>
<p>The melody drooped and climbed again with a kind of easy languor;
the warm darkness seemed to pulse like blood about them.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Le lendemain, nouvelle affaire:

</p>
<p>
Pour le berger le troc fut bon..."

</p>
</div>
<p>"Here are the steps," cried Denis. He guided his companions over
the danger, and in a moment they had the turf of the yew-tree
walk under their feet. It was lighter here, or at least it was
just perceptibly less dark; for the yew walk was wider than the
path that had led them under the lea of the house. Looking up,
they could see between the high black hedges a strip of sky and
a few stars.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Car il obtint de la bergere..."

</p>
</div>
<p>Went on Ivor, and then interrupted himself to shout, "I’m going
to run down," and he was off, full speed, down the invisible slope,
singing unevenly as he went:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Trente baisers pour un mouton."

</p>
</div>
<p>The others followed. Denis shambled in the rear, vainly exhorting
everyone to caution: the slope was steep, one might break one’s
neck. What was wrong with these people, he wondered? They had
become like young kittens after a dose of cat-nip. He himself
felt a certain kittenishness sporting within him; but it was,
like all his emotions, rather a theoretical feeling; it did not
overmasteringly seek to express itself in a practical demonstration
of kittenishness.</p>

<p>"Be careful," he shouted once more, and hardly were the words
out of his mouth when, thump! there was the sound of a heavy fall
in front of him, followed by the long "F-f-f-f-f" of a breath
indrawn with pain and afterwards by a very sincere, "Oo-ooh!"
Denis was almost pleased; he had told them so, the idiots, and
they wouldn’t listen. He trotted down the slope towards the unseen
sufferer.</p>

<p>Mary came down the hill like a runaway steam-engine. It was tremendously
exciting, this blind rush through the dark; she felt she would
never stop. But the ground grew level beneath her feet, her speed
insensibly slackened, and suddenly she was caught by an extended
arm and brought to an abrupt halt.</p>

<p>"Well," said Ivor as he tightened his embrace, "you’re caught
now, Anne."</p>

<p>She made an effort to release herself. "It’s not Anne. It’s Mary."</p>

<p>Ivor burst into a peal of amused laughter. "So it is!" he exclaimed.
"I seem to be making nothing but floaters this evening. I’ve already
made one with Jenny." He laughed again, and there was something
so jolly about his laughter that Mary could not help laughing
too. He did not remove his encircling arm, and somehow it was
all so amusing and natural that Mary made no further attempt to
escape from it. They walked along by the side of the pool, interlaced.
Mary was too short for him to be able, with any comfort, to lay
his head on her shoulder. He rubbed his cheek, caressed and caressing,
against the thick, sleek mass of her hair. In a little while he
began to sing again; the night trembled amorously to the sound
of his voice. When he had finished he kissed her. Anne or Mary:
Mary or Anne. It didn’t seem to make much difference which it
was. There were differences in detail, of course; but the general
effect was the same; and, after all, the general effect was the
important thing.</p>

<p>Denis made his way down the hill.</p>

<p>"Any damage done?" he called out.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Denis? I’ve hurt my ankle so&mdash;and my knee, and
my hand. I’m all in pieces."</p>

<p>"My poor Anne," he said. "But then," he couldn’t help adding,
"it was silly to start running downhill in the dark."</p>

<p>"Ass!" she retorted in a tone of tearful irritation; "of course
it was."</p>

<p>He sat down beside her on the grass, and found himself breathing
the faint, delicious atmosphere of perfume that she carried always
with her.</p>

<p>"Light a match," she commanded. "I want to look at my wounds."</p>

<p>He felt in his pockets for the match-box. The light spurted and
then grew steady. Magically, a little universe had been created,
a world of colours and forms &mdash;Anne’s face, the shimmering
orange of her dress, her white, bare arms, a patch of green turf&mdash;and
round about a darkness that had become solid and utterly blind.
Anne held out her hands; both were green and earthy with her fall,
and the left exhibited two or three red abrasions.</p>

<p>"Not so bad," she said. But Denis was terribly distressed, and
his emotion was intensified when, looking up at her face, he saw
that the trace of tears, involuntary tears of pain, lingered on
her eyelashes. He pulled out his handkerchief and began to wipe
away the dirt from the wounded hand. The match went out; it was
not worth while to light another. Anne allowed herself to be attended
to, meekly and gratefully. "Thank you," she said, when he had
finished cleaning and bandaging her hand; and there was something
in her tone that made him feel that she had lost her superiority
over him, that she was younger than he, had become, suddenly,
almost a child. He felt tremendously large and protective. The
feeling was so strong that instinctively he put his arm about
her. She drew closer, leaned against him, and so they sat in silence.
Then, from below, soft but wonderfully clear through the still
darkness, they heard the sound of Ivor’s singing. He was going
on with his half-finished song:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Le lendemain Phillis plus tendre,

</p>
<p>
Ne voulant deplaire au berger,

</p>
<p>
Fut trop heureuse de lui rendre

</p>
<p>
Trente moutons pour un baiser."

</p>
</div>
<p>There was a rather prolonged pause. It was as though time were
being allowed for the giving and receiving of a few of those thirty
kisses. Then the voice sang on:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Le lendemain Phillis peu sage

</p>
<p>
Aurait donne moutons et chien

</p>
<p>
Pour un baiser que le volage

</p>
<p>
À Lisette donnait pour rien."

</p>
</div>
<p>The last note died away into an uninterrupted silence.</p>

<p>"Are you better?" Denis whispered. "Are you comfortable like
this?"</p>

<p>She nodded a Yes to both questions.</p>

<p>"Trente moutons pour un baiser." The sheep, the woolly mutton&mdash;baa,
baa, baa...? Or the shepherd? Yes, decidedly, he felt himself
to be the shepherd now. He was the master, the protector. A wave
of courage swelled through him, warm as wine. He turned his head,
and began to kiss her face, at first rather randomly, then, with
more precision, on the mouth.</p>

<p>Anne averted her head; he kissed the ear, the smooth nape that
this movement presented him. "No," she protested; "no, Denis."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It spoils our friendship, and that was so jolly."</p>

<p>"Bosh!" said Denis.</p>

<p>She tried to explain. "Can’t you see," she said, "it isn’t...it
isn’t our stunt at all." It was true. Somehow she had never thought
of Denis in the light of a man who might make love; she had never
so much as conceived the possibilities of an amorous relationship
with him. He was so absurdly young, so...so...she couldn’t find
the adjective, but she knew what she meant.</p>

<p>"Why isn’t it our stunt?" asked Denis. "And, by the way, that’s
a horrible and inappropriate expression."</p>

<p>"Because it isn’t."</p>

<p>"But if I say it is?"</p>

<p>"It makes no difference. I say it isn’t."</p>

<p>"I shall make you say it is."</p>

<p>"All right, Denis. But you must do it another time. I must go
in and get my ankle into hot water. It’s beginning to swell."</p>

<p>Reasons of health could not be gainsaid. Denis got up reluctantly,
and helped his companion to her feet. She took a cautious step.
"Ooh!" She halted and leaned heavily on his arm.</p>

<p>"I’ll carry you," Denis offered. He had never tried to carry
a woman, but on the cinema it always looked an easy piece of heroism.</p>

<p>"You couldn’t," said Anne.</p>

<p>"Of course I can." He felt larger and more protective than ever.
"Put your arms round my neck," he ordered. She did so and, stooping,
he picked her up under the knees and lifted her from the ground.
Good heavens, what a weight! He took five staggering steps up
the slope, then almost lost his equilibrium, and had to deposit
his burden suddenly, with something of a bump.</p>

<p>Anne was shaking with laughter. "I said you couldn’t, my poor
Denis."</p>

<p>"I can," said Denis, without conviction. "I’ll try again."</p>

<p>"It’s perfectly sweet of you to offer, but I’d rather walk, thanks."
She laid her hand on his shoulder and, thus supported, began to
limp slowly up the hill.</p>

<p>"My poor Denis!" she repeated, and laughed again. Humiliated,
he was silent. It seemed incredible that, only two minutes ago,
he should have been holding her in his embrace, kissing her. Incredible.
She was helpless then, a child. Now she had regained all her superiority;
she was once more the far-off being, desired and unassailable.
Why had he been such a fool as to suggest that carrying stunt?
He reached the house in a state of the profoundest depression.</p>

<p>He helped Anne upstairs, left her in the hands of a maid, and
came down again to the drawing-room. He was surprised to find
them all sitting just where he had left them. He had expected
that, somehow, everything would be quite different&mdash;it seemed
such a prodigious time since he went away. All silent and all
damned, he reflected, as he looked at them. Mr. Scogan’s pipe
still wheezed; that was the only sound. Henry Wimbush was still
deep in his account books; he had just made the discovery that
Sir Ferdinando was in the habit of eating oysters the whole summer
through, regardless of the absence of the justifying R. Gombauld,
in horn-rimmed spectacles, was reading. Jenny was mysteriously
scribbling in her red notebook. And, seated in her favourite arm-chair
at the corner of the hearth, Priscilla was looking through a pile
of drawings. One by one she held them out at arm’s length and,
throwing back her mountainous orange head, looked long and attentively
through half-closed eyelids. She wore a pale sea-green dress;
on the slope of her mauve-powdered decolletage diamonds twinkled.
An immensely long cigarette-holder projected at an angle from
her face. Diamonds were embedded in her high-piled coiffure; they
glittered every time she moved. It was a batch of Ivor’s drawings&mdash;sketches
of Spirit Life, made in the course of tranced tours through the
other world. On the back of each sheet descriptive titles were
written: "Portrait of an Angel, 15th March ‘20;" "Astral Beings
at Play, 3rd December ‘19;" "A Party of Souls on their Way to
a Higher Sphere, 21st May ‘21." Before examining the drawing on
the obverse of each sheet, she turned it over to read the title.
Try as she could&mdash;and she tried hard &mdash;Priscilla had never
seen a vision or succeeded in establishing any communication with
the Spirit World. She had to be content with the reported experiences
of others.</p>

<p>"What have you done with the rest of your party?" she asked,
looking up as Denis entered the room.</p>

<p>He explained. Anne had gone to bed, Ivor and Mary were still
in the garden. He selected a book and a comfortable chair, and
tried, as far as the disturbed state of his mind would permit
him, to compose himself for an evening’s reading. The lamplight
was utterly serene; there was no movement save the stir of Priscilla
among her papers. All silent and all damned, Denis repeated to
himself, all silent and all damned...</p>

<p>It was nearly an hour later when Ivor and Mary made their appearance.</p>

<p>"We waited to see the moon rise," said Ivor.</p>

<p>"It was gibbous, you know," Mary explained, very technical and
scientific.</p>

<p>"It was so beautiful down in the garden! The trees, the scent
of the flowers, the stars..." Ivor waved his arms. "And when the
moon came up, it was really too much. It made me burst into tears."
He sat down at the piano and opened the lid.</p>

<p>"There were a great many meteorites," said Mary to anyone who
would listen. "The earth must just be coming into the summer shower
of them. In July and August..."</p>

<p>But Ivor had already begun to strike the keys. He played the
garden, the stars, the scent of flowers, the rising moon. He even
put in a nightingale that was not there. Mary looked on and listened
with parted lips. The others pursued their occupations, without
appearing to be seriously disturbed. On this very July day, exactly
three hundred and fifty years ago, Sir Ferdinando had eaten seven
dozen oysters. The discovery of this fact gave Henry Wimbush a
peculiar pleasure. He had a natural piety which made him delight
in the celebration of memorial feasts. The three hundred and fiftieth
anniversary of the seven dozen oysters...He wished he had known
before dinner; he would have ordered champagne.</p>

<p>On her way to bed Mary paid a call. The light was out in Anne’s
room, but she was not yet asleep.</p>

<p>"Why didn’t you come down to the garden with us?" Mary asked.</p>

<p>"I fell down and twisted my ankle. Denis helped me home."</p>

<p>Mary was full of sympathy. Inwardly, too, she was relieved to
find Anne’s non-appearance so simply accounted for. She had been
vaguely suspicious, down there in the garden&mdash;suspicious of what,
she hardly knew; but there had seemed to be something a little
louche in the way she had suddenly found herself alone with Ivor.
Not that she minded, of course; far from it. But she didn’t like
the idea that perhaps she was the victim of a put-up job.</p>

<p>"I do hope you’ll be better to-morrow," she said, and she commiserated
with Anne on all she had missed&mdash;the garden, the stars, the scent
of flowers, the meteorites through whose summer shower the earth
was now passing, the rising moon and its gibbosity. And then they
had had such interesting conversation. What about? About almost
everything. Nature, art, science, poetry, the stars, spiritualism,
the relations of the sexes, music, religion. Ivor, she thought,
had an interesting mind.</p>

<p>The two young ladies parted affectionately.</p>
