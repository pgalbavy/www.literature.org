<p>Once again, as Nero stood with Mr. Lion at the front door of the jungle
cave, the roaring sound echoed among the trees.
</p><p>"What is that?" asked the boy lion once more.
</p><p>"That is the roaring of other lions, who are also going out to hunt
to-night," said Nero's father. "There will be many of us lions in the
jungle; perhaps others, like you, who are going out for the first time.
You must be brave and strong. Remember the lessons your mother and I
have taught you. Crouch down and jump hard. Strike hard with your paws
and dig deep with your sharp claws. That is what they are for--to help
you hunt so that you may get things to eat. Now we will start."
</p><p>By this time the jungle around the cave where Nero lived seemed filled
with the roarings of other lions. The very ground seemed to tremble.
Nero was excited, but he was sure he could hunt well. He was a brave
lion, and he knew he was strong and nearly full grown now, and he knew
his teeth were sharp, as were his claws, and his paws were strong, both
for striking and leaping, for that is how a lion hunts.
</p><p>"Boom! Boom!" rolled out the lions' roars in the jungle.
</p><p>"Ah, we shall have a grand hunt to-night!" said Nero's father. "I hope
you are still hungry."
</p><p>"Yes I am, very," answered the boy lion.
</p><p>"That is good," returned the father. "Now we will start. At first stay
close to me, but when you see a goat or a sheep or some other animal you
think you would like to eat, spring on it and strike it with your
claws."
</p><p>Of course this sounds cruel, but lions must get their food this way;
there is no other.
</p><p>Suddenly Nero opened his mouth and gave a great roar, the loudest he had
ever uttered. It shook the ground on which he stood. The trembling of
the earth seemed to tickle the pads of skin and flesh of his paws, pads
which were the same to him as your shoes are to you.
</p><p>"Ha, that was a fine roar, Nero!" said his father. "Roar again!"
</p><p>And Nero did, louder than at first.
</p><p>"That's the way!" cried Mr. Lion. "That will tell the other jungle folk
to keep out of our way when we are having a night-hunt."
</p><p>And that, I suppose, is why lions roar. They do it to frighten away the
other animals who might spoil their hunt in the jungle.
</p><p>For the lion's voice, when he roars, is frightfully loud. There is no
other animal who can make so much noise--not even the elephant, which is
larger than ten lions. If you have ever heard a lion roar, even in his
circus cage, or in a city park, you will never forget it.
</p><p>And so Nero roared, and his father roared, and the other lions, all
about them in the jungle, roared until there was a regular lion chorus,
and the other beasts, hearing it, slunk back to their dens or caves, or
crouched under fallen trees, and one after another said to himself:
</p><p>"The lions are out hunting to-night. It is best for us to stay in until
they have finished. Then it will be our turn."
</p><p>And so you see how it is that the strength of a lion makes the other
animals afraid when the big animals hunt. Elephants do not need to fear
lions, for the big animals, with trunks and tusks, do not eat the same
kind of food lions eat. Elephants live on grass, hay, palm-nuts and
things that grow. But the lion eats only meat, and he would eat an
elephant if he could get one, though it might take him a long while.
</p><p>"Now for the hunt!" said Mr. Lion, as he led Nero into the jungle.
"Tread softly. Sniff with your nose until you smell something worth
hunting, and then spring on it."
</p><p>Though lions, like cats, can see pretty well in the dark, they have to
depend a great deal in their hunting on what they can smell with their
nose, just as your dog can smell a bone, and tell, in that way, where he
has buried it in the garden.
</p><p>So Nero and his father joined the other lions on their march through the
jungle in search of something to eat. And Nero kept getting hungrier and
hungrier, so that he looked eagerly around every side of him in the
darkness, and sniffed so that he might know when he came near anything
he could kill and eat.
</p><p>The other lions were doing the same thing. They did not roar now, but
went quietly, slinking through the jungle as quietly as your cat creeps
through the grass when she is trying to catch a sparrow. The lions had
done enough roaring to scare away other animals who might bother them in
their hunt. Now they did not roar any longer, for they did not want to
scare away the smaller beasts which were food for them in their hunger.
</p><p>"I'm going to leave you for a while now, Nero," said Mr. Lion, after a
bit. "You will have to get along by yourself. But don't forget the
lessons your mother and I taught you."
</p><p>"Where are you going?" asked Nero.
</p><p>"I am going to the front, to march along with the older men lions," said
Nero's father. "We are going to lead you young lions where there will be
good hunting."
</p><p>"I shall like that," growled Nero, and he sprang on a tree trunk as he
passed, and dug deep into the soft bark.
</p><p>"Hi! Quit that! You're scattering bark in my eyes!" said a voice behind
Nero. It was not a loud voice, for one has to be quiet when hunting in
the jungle.
</p><p>"Who's there?" asked Nero, thinking for a moment it might be the
crocodile who had tossed him into the jungle pool.
</p><p>"It is I--Switchie," was the answer.
</p><p>"Oh, are you hunting, too?" asked Nero, glad to find that he knew some
one among the lions besides his father. "Have you killed anything yet?"
</p><p>"No, not yet. But I shall pretty soon," answered Switchie. "This isn't
my first hunt. I've been out at night before."
</p><p>"Isn't it great!" said Nero. "I hope I can kill a big buffalo. That
would make a fine meal!"
</p><p>"Yes, I should say it would!" exclaimed Switchie. "But you had better
leave the buffaloes to your father and the other big men lions. They
always take them. It takes a big lion to catch a buffalo, and even then
sometimes the buffaloes kill a lion."
</p><p>"How?" asked Nero.
</p><p>"With their sharp horns," answered Switchie. "Buffaloes have terribly
sharp horns. Better look out for them. Better stick to the goats and the
sheep, or even a rabbit, until you learn more about hunting. As for me,
I am old enough now to try for a buffalo, I think. So if you see one,
tell me, and I'll kill it and give you some."
</p><p>"Well, I guess I'm nearly as big and strong as you," growled Nero. "If I
see a buffalo I'll jump on his back, and strike him with my paw."
</p><p>"All right. But if you get hurt don't say I didn't tell you to be
careful," warned Switchie. "Now come on! We must hurry or we shall be
left behind. Ho for the jungle hunt!"
</p><p>The two boy lions hurried on after the others. Ahead of them they could
hear, faintly, the tread of the older beasts as they walked along,
looking for something to strike and kill, to stop the terrible hunger.
The lions only went on a hunt when they wanted something to eat. They
did not kill for fun. It was their way of getting a living.
</p><p>Suddenly, up in front, there sounded a crash among the tangled vines,
bushes and trees of the jungle. Then came a roar, but not a very loud
one.
</p><p>"What's that?" asked Nero of Switchie.
</p><p>"Oh, that isn't any thing. Don't be afraid," answered the other lion.
</p><p>"I'm not afraid!" said Nero. "Only, I want to learn things. I never
hunted in the jungle at night before, and I don't know so much about it
as you do. What was that noise?"
</p><p>"Oh," said Switchie, easily, "that, I suppose, was my father, or yours,
killing some big animal. Maybe it was a buffalo. We'll soon find out."
</p><p>And the two boy lions did. As they came to an open place in the jungle
they saw Nero's father and that of Switchie crouching near something big
and black lying on the ground. Off to one side was a lion, licking, with
his big red tongue, a sore place on his leg.
</p><p>"What happened?" asked Nero quickly, of his father.
</p><p>"We killed a buffalo, Cruncher and I," said Mr. Lion, as he nodded
toward Switchie's father, whose name was Cruncher. "We killed a buffalo,
but my cousin, Chaw, is hurt. The buffalo stuck him with one of his
horns. Then I struck down the buffalo. Here, Nero, is a bit of meat for
you, and, Switchie, you may have some. But not much. This meat belongs
to Cruncher and me. We will give you a little, but, if you want any
more, you must hunt for yourselves. I fed you when you were a little
baby lion, Nero, but now that you are big you must learn to feed and
hunt for yourself."
</p><p>And this, too, is the law of the jungle.
</p><p>Switchie and Nero eagerly ate the bits of meat the older lions gave
them, and then the hunt went on. Nero was still very hungry, and so was
Switchie, and pretty soon Nero saw a small animal creeping along through
the jungle.
</p><p>"Ah, you are trying to get away from me!" thought Nero, who had gone to
one side, and away from the others. "But I'll get you!"
</p><p>Then he stalked, or crept softly after, the animal, which was a big
rabbit, and, all of a sudden, Nero leaped and caught the smaller beast.
</p><p>"At last I have hunted for myself!" thought Nero, as he ate his meal.
"This is great! But it is not enough. I must have more!"
</p><p>He went farther on in the jungle, and, all at once, he heard a goat
bleating.
</p><p>"Baa-a-a-a! Baa!" bleated the goat.
</p><p>"Ha! There is something else I can catch for my supper!" thought Nero.
"I am getting to be quite a hunter!"
</p><p>By this time he was far off from his father and the other lions. But he
did not mind that. He felt sure he could find his way back when he
needed to.
</p><p>"But first I'll catch that goat," said Nero.
</p><p>Carefully he stalked through the jungle, coming nearer and nearer to
where he could hear the goat bleating. At last, in an open place in the
jungle, where the moon shone brightly, Nero saw the goat, a white one.
It seemed caught fast in a vine, and could not move.
</p><p>"Ah, I can easily get this fellow!" thought the boy lion.
</p><p>He crouched for a spring, and was just going to leap through the air and
on the back of the goat when, suddenly, there was a loud sound, like a
small clap of thunder, and at once Nero felt a sharp pain in one paw. He
rolled over and over, howling and roaring in pain and anger.
</p><p>At the same time a man hidden on a platform built up in a tree, cried
out:
</p><p>"Oh, I have shot a lion! I have shot a lion!"
