<p>At the moment of flinging his rifle from him, when he made his
first leap, Wharton Edwards noticed where it landed, and of course
knew just where to look for it. When he searched that place for
it, and saw nothing of the weapon, he knew, therefore, that something
was wrong.</p>

<p>A thrill of alarm went through him on realizing the oversight
he had committed, but he met it with the coolness of a veteran.</p>

<p>He pretended to be still searching for the weapon, and moved
back and forth, and hither and yon, with his head bent, as though
his eyes were fixed on the ground, but the eyebrows were elevated
and his vision was roaming along the edge of the trees only a
few rods distant, in quest of Shawanoes.</p>

<p>None of them were in sight, but he knew that they were there,
and more than one pair of serpent-like eyes were fixed upon him
and watching his every act.</p>

<p>Wharton's impulse was to turn back and leap to the other side
of the gorge. The temptation was strong, but he dared not attempt
it. He could not make the jump without a short run, and that would
give the Indians all the chance they could ask to wing him on
the fly, as they most assuredly would do.</p>

<p>During the few minutes that he pretended to be groping for the
missing gun he did a lot of thinking. He knew he was caught inextricably
in a trap, and for a time saw no possible way out.</p>

<p>Had there been anything to gain by a sudden leap into the torrent
he would have made it; but that insured another plunge over the
falls, with the chances in favor of drowning. That, however, was
as nothing compared to the fact that he would be at the mercy
of the Shawanoes from the moment he entered the water.</p>

<p>Hopeless himself, his concern was for the chivalrous Larry, who
had imperilled his life for him. There was hope that his presence
on the other bluff was unknown to the red men, and Wharton felt
that if he could frighten him into getting out of the way he would
be comparatively safe, and would be at liberty to hasten on to
the block-house and secure help for him.</p>

<p>But Larry seemed to be taken with a spell of obtuseness just
then. He called to Wharton several times in a dangerously loud
voice, and appeared not to see, or at least not to understand,
the signals which were assiduously made to him. The young man
became so solicitous for his companion, who was without comprehension
of his danger, that he forgot everything else, and, advancing
to the edge of the ravine, indulged in the vigorous gestures and
words which accomplished what he intended.</p>

<p>"Now, if he will use sense, he can save himself," was the conclusion
of Wharton, from whose heart a crushing weight was lifted; "he
has not been seen, and only needs to keep out of sight until he
can take the trail again."</p>

<p>But he was in a dreadful situation himself. Between the ravine
and the woods, from which he knew the Shawanoes were watching
him, was an open space, something more than fifty yards in extent.
This narrowed to a fourth of that width up stream, and disappeared
altogether at the brink of the falls.</p>

<p>It was useless to pretend longer to hunt for the missing rifle
on the face of the rocks when a minute's scrutiny was sufficient
to prove that it was not there. His actions had already shown
that he knew something was amiss, and the Indians were not likely
to allow the farce to continue much longer.</p>

<p>To go directly away from the stream and toward the wood was to
walk into the hands of the fierce red men, and the youth was ready
to take any risk before doing that. The frightful contingency
he feared was that the moment he made a break for freedom they
would fire, and the distance was so short that he could not escape
their aim. That brief, open space over which he must run was the
gauntlet of certain death. If he were only a little nearer the
trees, he would attempt it. He saw but one possible thing to do,
and he now attempted it.</p>

<p>Pausing in his groping for the weapon, he raised his head and
looked inquiringly about him. He did not dare let his eyes dwell
on the trees immediately in front, through fear of exciting suspicion,
and the quick glance which he swept along the trees failed to
show him so much as a glimpse of his enemies. But he knew they
were there, all the same.</p>

<p>Fixing his eyes again on the ground, he pretended suddenly to
discover shadowy traces of something in the nature of footprints,
but, instead of leading straight toward the wood, they led up
stream, where the open space rapidly narrowed.</p>

<p>He walked slowly forward, with his gaze seemingly on the earth,
but he was slyly watching the wood, with the alertness of a weasel,
on the lookout for the first evidence that his action was mistrusted.</p>

<p>It was a fearful test to the nerves. With every foot's advance
his heart throbbed faster with hope, and his desperate resolve
became more fixed. His greatest task was to restrain himself from
bounding forward at the topmost bent of his speed as he saw the
friendly trees drawing near with each passing moment; and yet
he not only forced himself to do that, but he came to a dead halt,
slowly turned around, bent his head down and scanned the ground
behind him. His action was as if he had suddenly come upon some
evidence, but in that sweep of the head he again glanced along
the edge of the wood that confronted him when he leaped the chasm.
This time he saw a movement so faint that he could not identify
it, but it told him the crisis had come.</p>

<p>He had now gone so far that nothing less than a disabling bullet
could restrain him. He longed more than ever to leap away, but
every inch gained was of incalculable worth, and, repressing his
impatience with an iron will, he continued edging along, his heart
throbbing like a trip-hammer.</p>

<p>To fail to keep close watch of the wood any longer must defeat
his purpose. With little attempt, therefore, to hide his action,
he quickly turned his head, and, without checking his advance,
scanned the margin of the forest. As he did so, he observed a
stir among the trees. The Shawanoes evidently concluded that the
farce had gone too far. Without another second's hesitation young
Edwards made a tremendous bound in the direction of the trees,
and was off like an arrow shot from the bow.</p>

<p>He expected a rattling volley from the Shawanoes, and few who
have not been through the ordeal can understand the sensation
which comes over one when absolutely certain of a demonstration
of that kind. To his amazement, however, not a shot was fired,
and he dodged among the trees unscathed. Puzzled beyond measure
to know what it meant, the fugitive glanced over his shoulder.
That which he saw perplexed him for the moment as much as his
immunity from the part of a target. One solitary Shawanoe warrior
had leaped to his feet and started in pursuit. Like a flash the
whole meaning of this act came to Wharton Edwards.</p>

<p>When the Indians were not so hostile toward the whites as they
were at the time of which we are writing, they occasionally visited
the block-houses and settlements for purposes of barter, and to
engage in friendly contests of skill in shooting, leaping and
running. The red men were so trained from infancy to this kind
of amusement that they were experts, and held their own well against
the pioneers, though it is well known that the Caucasian race,
under similar surroundings and environments, surpasses all others
in physical as well as mental attainments.</p>

<p>The champion of the settlement was Wharton Edwards, who, despite
his seventeen years, vanquished all contestants. He received the
praise of Daniel Boone and Simon Kenton, who agreed that there
was but one Shawanoe, outside of the unrivalled Deerfoot, who
could hold his own with him. That was the famous warrior Blazing
Arrow, who was about double the age of Wharton, and who claimed
to have beaten every one with whom he struggled for supremacy.</p>

<p>Following this declaration from such high authority came the
natural desire to see young Edwards and the Shawanoe runner pitted
against each other, and efforts were made to bring about a contest
between these representatives of their respective races. The great
difficulty in the way was that the Shawanoe was one of the most
vicious and treacherous of his tribe. He had committed so many
crimes against the whites that he feared to trust himself in their
power, and stubbornly refused to come to the settlement, despite
the assurances of the leading pioneers.</p>

<p>He was persuaded, however, to venture out of the woods one day,
and the arrangements were quickly made for a race between him
and young Edwards. Before the trial came off some one gave the
Shawanoe a draught of "fire-water," which roused the sleeping
devil in him. Whipping out his knife, he emitted his war-whoop,
and charged upon the astonished youth, with the intention of slaying
him.</p>

<p>Wharton, who naturally had no weapon with him, succeeded in dodging
the miscreant, and before the wrathful settlers could punish him
he darted into the woods with a defiant shout and disappeared.</p>

<p>The glance which Wharton Edwards now cast to the rear, as he
started to flee, showed him that his single pursuer was Blazing
Arrow.</p>
