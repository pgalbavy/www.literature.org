<p>Rusty Wren looked quite crestfallen as he listened to his wife's
wail. He wished that he had heeded her warning, when she declared
that his hiring a boy would certainly lead to trouble.
</p>
<p>"What's the matter with you?" Rusty asked his helper, Chippy, Jr.
"When you first came to work for us you could slip through our
doorway easily enough. But now you're altogether too big."
</p><p>Chippy, Jr., said that the entrance to their house must have
shrunk.
</p><p>"How could it?" Rusty demanded impatiently.
</p><p>"It rained last night," the youngster reminded him.
</p><p>But Rusty Wren said, "Nonsense! The doorway's made of tin--not
wood. <u>You</u> have grown--that's the whole trouble! And you've got us
into a pretty fix."
</p><p>"I begin to think that it was all planned this way by his father,"
Mrs. Rusty told her husband, "so Mr. Chippy wouldn't have to take
care of his son. But I don't intend to adopt a big, overgrown boy
like him--not when I have six small children of my own!"
</p><p>Chippy, Jr., couldn't help feeling both uncomfortable and unhappy.
</p><p>"I want to go home!" he blubbered. "It's almost my bedtime. And my
father and my mother won't like it at all if I stay here all
night."
</p><p>"Well," said Rusty Wren, "I don't know how you're going to leave
our house if you can't squeeze through the door. So I'll hurry
over and tell your father about this trouble, and he can break the
news gently to your mother."
</p><p>Then Rusty went off, flying directly to the stone wall where the
Chippy family lived. And soon he was explaining to Mr. Chippy how
his son was inside their house and couldn't leave.
</p><p>Now, Mr. Chippy was unusually mild mannered. But he became greatly
excited as soon as he heard Rusty's story.
</p><p>"It's just like being caught in a trap!" he exclaimed. "And I can't
help feeling that you've played a trick on my son--probably to
please Johnnie Green.... If you don't set my boy free to-morrow
morning at daybreak, I shall certainly make trouble for you."
</p><p>Mr. Chippy's warning amazed Rusty Wren. But he couldn't help
laughing at the idea of anybody causing him any <u>trouble</u>.
</p><p>"I'm so deep in trouble now," he told Mr. Chippy, "there's nothing
you can do to make matters any worse for me. I've six growing
children to bring up; and now I have your son to take care of; and
my wife thinks everything is my fault, because I wanted to hire a
boy to help me catch insects.
</p><p>"So you can't scare me by your threats. I only wish you would come
to my house and take your son away with you--if you can."
</p><p>"I'll come--and I'll tear your house down!" Mr. Chippy cried
fiercely. And he began screaming, "<u>Chip, chip, chip, chip</u>," in a
very shrill voice which was most annoying to hear.
</p><p>Rusty Wren did not like to listen to him. So he flew back home and
went to bed. He only wished that it were possible for Mr. Chippy
to break into his house and rescue Chippy, Jr. But since the house
was made of tin, Rusty knew that Mr. Chippy was helpless.
</p><p>"I'll never settle in a tin house again so long as I live!" he
groaned.
