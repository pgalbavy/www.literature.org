<p>On Saturday afternoon Cynthia arrived at Silverwood House, with
Cairns in tow; and they were welcomed under the trees by their
host and hostess. Which was all very delightful until Cynthia
and Jacqueline paired off with each other and disappeared, calmly
abandoning Cairns and Desboro to their own devices, leaving them
to gaze at each other in the library with bored and increasing
indifference.</p>

<p>"You know, Jim," explained the former, in unfeigned disgust,
"I have quite enough of you every day, and I haven't come sixty
miles to see more of you."</p>

<p>"I sympathise with your sentiments," said Desboro, laughing,
"but Miss Lessler has never before seen the place, and, of course,
Jacqueline is dying to show it to her. And, Jack&mdash;did you <em>ever</em>
see two more engaging young girls than the two who have just deserted
us? Really, partiality aside, does any house in town contain two
more dignified, intelligent, charming&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, it doesn't!" said Cairns bluntly. "Nor any two women more
upright and chaste. It's a fine text, isn't it, though?" he added
morosely.</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"That their goodness is due to their characters, not to environment
or to any material advantages. Has it ever occurred to you how
doubly disgraceful it is for people, with every chance in the
world, not to make good?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It has to me frequently of late. And I wonder what I'd have
turned into, given Cynthia's worldly chances." He shook his head,
muttering to himself: "It's fine, <em>fine</em>&mdash;to be what she
is after what she has had to stack up against!"</p>

<p>Desboro winced. Presently he said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"The worst she had to encounter were men of our sort. That's
a truth we can't blink. It wasn't loneliness or poverty or hunger
that were dangerous; it was men."</p>

<p>"Don't," said Cairns, rising impatiently and striding about the
room. "I know all about <em>that</em>. But it's over, God be praised.
And I'm seeing things differently now&mdash;very, very differently.
You are, too, I take it. So, for the love of Mike, let's be pleasant
about it. I hate gloom. Can't a fellow regenerate himself and
remain cheerful?"</p>

<p>Desboro laughed uncertainly, listening to the gay voices on the
stairs, where Jacqueline and Cynthia were garrulously exploring
the house together.</p>

<p>"Darling, it's too lovely!" exclaimed Cynthia, every few minutes,
while Jacqueline was conducting her from one room to another,
upstairs, down again, through the hall and corridor, accompanied
by an adoring multitude of low-born dogs and nondescript cats,
all running beside her with tails stuck upright.</p>

<p>And so, very happily together, they visited the kitchen, laundry,
storeroom, drying room, engine room, cellars; made the fragrant
tour of the greenhouses and a less fragrant visit to the garage;
inspected the water supply; gingerly traversed the gravel paths
of the kitchen garden, peeped into tool houses, carpenters' quarters;
gravely surveyed compost heaps, manure pits, and cold frames.</p>

<p>Jacqueline pointed out the distant farm, with its barns, stables,
dairy, and chicken runs, from the lantern of the windmill, whither
they had climbed; and Cynthia looked out over the rolling country
to the blue hills edging the Hudson, and down into gray woodlands
where patches of fire signalled the swelling maple buds; and edging
willows were palely green. Over brown earth and new grass robins
were running; and bluebirds fluttered from tree to fencepost.</p>

<p>Cynthia's arm stole around Jacqueline's waist.</p>

<p>"I am so glad for you&mdash;so glad, so proud," she whispered. "Do
you remember, once, long ago, I prophesied this for you? That
you would one day take your proper place in the world?"</p>

<p>"Do you know," mused Jacqueline, "I don't really believe that
the <em>place</em> matters so much&mdash;as long as one is all right.
That sounds horribly priggish&mdash;but isn't it so, Cynthia?"</p>

<p>"Few ever attain that self-sufficient philosophy," said Cynthia,
laughing. "You can spoil a gem by cheap setting."</p>

<p>"But it remains a gem. Oh, Cynthia! <em>Am</em> I such a prig
as I sound?"</p>

<p>They were both laughing so gaily that the flock of pigeons on
the roof were startled into flight and swung around them in whimpering
circles.</p>

<p>As they started to descend the steep stairs, Jacqueline said
casually:</p>

<p>"Do you continue to find Mr. Cairns as agreeable and interesting
as ever?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," nodded the girl carelessly.</p>

<p>"Jim likes him immensely."</p>

<p>"He is a very pleasant companion," said Cynthia.</p>

<p>When they were strolling toward the house, she added:</p>

<p>"He thinks you are very wonderful, Jacqueline. But then everybody
does."</p>

<p>The girl blushed: "The only thing wonderful about me is my happiness,"
she said.</p>

<p>Cynthia looked up into her eyes.</p>

<p>"<em>Are</em> you?"</p>

<p>"Happy? Of course."</p>

<p>"Is that quite true, dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jacqueline under her breath.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;there is no flaw?"</p>

<p>"None&mdash;now."</p>

<p>Cynthia impulsively caught up one of her hands and kissed it.</p>

<p>In the library they found beside their deserted swains two visitors,
Daisy Hammerton and Captain Herrendene.</p>

<p>"Fine treatment!" protested Cairns, looking at Cynthia, as Jacqueline
came forward with charming friendliness and greeted her guests
and made Cynthia known to them. "Fine treatment!" he repeated
scornfully, "&mdash;leaving Jim and me to yawn at each other until
Daisy and the Captain yonder&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Jack," interrupted his pretty hostess, "if you push that button
somebody will bring tea."</p>

<p>"Twice means that Scotch is to be included," remarked Desboro.
"You didn't know that, did you, dear?"</p>

<p>"The only thing I know about your house, monsieur, is that your
cats and dogs must <em>not</em> pervade the red drawing-room,"
she said laughing. "<em>Look</em> at Captain Herrendene's beautiful
cutaway coat! It's all covered with fur and puppy hair! And now
<em>he</em> can't go into the drawing-room, either!"</p>

<p>Cairns looked ruefully at a black and white cat which had jumped
onto his knees and was purring herself to sleep there.</p>

<p>"If enough of 'em climb on me I'll have a motor coat for next
winter," he said with resignation.</p>

<p>Tea was served; the chatter and laughter became general. Daisy
Hammerton, always enamoured of literature, and secretly addicted
to its creation, spoke of Orrin Munger's new volume which Herrendene
had been reading to her that morning under the trees.</p>

<p>"Such a queer book," she said, turning to Jacqueline, "&mdash;and
I'm not yet quite certain whether it's silly or profound. Captain
Herrendene makes fun of it&mdash;but it seems as though there <em>must</em>
be <em>some</em> meaning in it."</p>

<p>"There isn't," said Herrendene. "It consists of a wad of verse,
blank, inverted, and symbolic. Carbolic is what it requires."</p>

<p>"Isn't that the moon-youth who writes over the heads of the public
and far ahead of 'em into the next century?" inquired Cairns.</p>

<p>"When an author," said Herrendene, "thinks he is writing ahead
of his readers, the chances are that he hasn't yet caught up with
them."</p>

<p>The only flaw in Daisy Hammerton's good sense was a mistaken
respect for printed pages. She said, reverently:</p>

<p>"When a poet like Orrin Munger refers to himself as a Cubist
and a Futurist, it <em>must</em> have some occult significance.
Besides, he went about a good deal last winter, and I met him."</p>

<p>"What did you think of him?" asked Desboro drily.</p>

<p>"I scarcely knew. He <em>is</em> odd. He kissed everybody's hand
and spoke with such obscurity about his work&mdash;referred to it in
such veiled terms that, somehow, it all seemed a wonderful mystery
to me."</p>

<p>Desboro smiled: "The man who is preÃ«minent in his profession,"
he said quietly, "never makes a mystery of it. He may be too tired
to talk about it, too saturated with it, after the day's work,
to discuss it; but never fool enough to pretend that there is
anything occult in it or in the success he has made of it. Only
incompetency is self-conscious and secretive; only the ass strikes
attitudes."</p>

<p>Jacqueline looked at him with pride unutterable. She thought
as he did.</p>

<p>He smiled at her, encouraged, and went on:</p>

<p>"The complacent tickler of phrases, the pseudo-intellectual scrambler
after subtleties that do not exist, the smirking creators of the
tortuous, the writhing explorers of the obvious, who pretend to
find depths where there are shallows, the unusual where only the
commonplace and wholesome exist&mdash;these will always parody real
effort, and ape real talent in all creative professions, and do
more damage than mere ignorance or even mere viciousness could
ever accomplish. And, to my mind, that is all there is and all
there ever will be to men like Munger."</p>

<p>Daisy laughed and looked at Herrendene.</p>

<p>"Then I've wasted your morning!" she said, pretending contrition.</p>

<p>He looked her straight in the eye.</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of it that way," he said pleasantly.</p>

<p>Cairns, tired of feigning an interest in matters literary, tinkled
the ice in his glass and looked appealingly at Cynthia. And his
eyes said very plainly: "Shall we go for a walk?"</p>

<p>But she only smiled, affecting not to understand; and the discussion
of things literary continued.</p>

<p>It was very pleasant there in the house; late sunshine slanted
across the hall; a springlike breeze fluttered the curtains, and
the evening song of the robins had begun, ringing cheerily among
the Norway spruces and over the fresh green lawns.</p>

<p>"It's a shame to sit indoors on a day like this," said Desboro
lazily.</p>

<p>Everybody agreed, but nobody stirred, except Cairns, who fidgeted
and looked at Cynthia.</p>

<p>Perhaps that maiden's heart softened, for she rose presently,
and drifted off into the music room. Cairns followed. The others
listened to her piano playing, conversing, too, at intervals,
until Daisy gave the signal to go, and Herrendene rose.</p>

<p>So the adieux were said, and a wood ramble for the morrow suggested.
Then Daisy and her Captain went away across the fields on foot,
and Cynthia returned to the piano, Cairns following at heel, as
usual.</p>

<p>Jacqueline and Desboro, lingering by the open door, saw the distant
hills turn to purest cobalt, and the girdling woodlands clothe
themselves in purple haze. Dusk came stealing across the meadows,
and her frail ghosts floated already over the alder-hidden brook.
A near robin sang loudly. A star came out between naked branches
and looked at them.</p>

<p>"How still the world has grown," breathed Jacqueline. "Except
for its silence, night with all its beauties would be unendurable."</p>

<p>"I believe we both need quiet," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, quiet&mdash;and each other."</p>

<p>Her voice had fallen so exquisitely low that he bent his head
to catch her words. But when he understood what she had said,
he turned and looked at her; and, still gazing on the coming night,
she leaned a little nearer to him, resting her cheek lightly against
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"That is what we need," she whispered, "&mdash;silence, and each other.
Don't you think so, Jim?"</p>

<p>"I need <em>you</em>&mdash;your love and faith and&mdash;forgiveness,"
he said huskily.</p>

<p>"You have them all. Now give me yours, Jim."</p>

<p>"I give you all&mdash;except forgiveness. I have nothing to forgive."</p>

<p>"You dear boy&mdash;you don't know&mdash;you will never know how much you
have to forgive me. But if I told you, I know you'd do it. So&mdash;let
it rest&mdash;forgotten forever. How fragrant the night is growing!
And I can hear the brook at intervals when the wind changes&mdash;very
far away&mdash;very far&mdash;as far as fairyland&mdash;as far as the abode of
the Maker of Moons."</p>

<p>"Who was he, dear?"</p>

<p>"Yu Lao. It's Chinese&mdash;and remote&mdash;lost in mystery eternal&mdash;where
the white soul of her abides who went forth 'between tall avenues
of spears, to die.' And that is where all things go at last, Jim&mdash;even
the world and the moon and stars&mdash;all things&mdash;even love&mdash;returning
to the source of all."</p>

<p>His arm had fallen around her waist. Presently, in the dusk,
he felt her cool, fresh hand seeking for his, drawing his arm
imperceptibly closer.</p>

<p>In the unlighted music room Cynthia's piano was silent.</p>

<p>Presently Jacqueline's cheek touched his, rested against it.</p>

<p>"I never knew I could feel so safe," she murmured. "I am&mdash;absolutely&mdash;contented."</p>

<p>"Do you love me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You have no fear of me now?"</p>

<p>"No. But don't kiss me&mdash;yet," she whispered, tightening his arm
around her.</p>

<p>He laughed softly: "Your Royal Shyness is so wonderful&mdash;so wonderful&mdash;so
worshipful and adorable! When may I kiss you?"</p>

<p>"When&mdash;we are alone."</p>

<p>"Will you respond&mdash;when we are alone?"</p>

<p>But she only pressed her flushed cheek against his shoulder,
clinging there in silence, eyes closed.</p>

<p>A few seconds later they started guiltily apart, as Cairns came
striding excitedly out of the darkness:</p>

<p>"I'm going to get married! I'm going to get married!" he repeated
breathlessly. "I've asked her, but she is crying! Isn't it wonderful!
Isn't it wonderful! Isn't it won&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>You!</em>" exclaimed Jacqueline, "and Cynthia! The <em>darling</em>!"</p>

<p>"I <em>said</em> she was one! I called her that, too!" said Cairns,
excitedly. "And she began to cry. So I came out here&mdash;and I <em>think</em>
she's going to accept me in a minute or two! Isn't it wonderful!
Isn't it won&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You lunatic!" cried Desboro, seizing and shaking him, "&mdash;you
incoherent idiot! If that girl is in there crying all alone, <em>what</em>
are you doing out here?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Cairns vacantly. "I don't know what I'm
doing. All this is too wonderful for me. I thought she knew me
too well to care for me. But she only began to cry. And I am going&#11834;"</p>

<p>He bolted back into the dark music room. Desboro and Jacqueline
gazed at each other.</p>

<p>"That man is mad!" snapped her husband. "But &mdash;I believe
she means to take him. Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Why &mdash;I suppose so," she managed to answer, stifling a
violent inclination to laugh.</p>

<p>They listened shamelessly. They stood there for a long while,
listening. And at last two shadowy figures appeared coming toward
them very slowly. One walked quietly into Jacqueline's arms; the
other attempted it with Desboro, and was repulsed.</p>

<p>"You're not French, you know," said the master of the house,
shaking hands with him viciously. "Never did I see such a blooming
idiot as you can be&mdash;but if Cynthia can stand you, I'll have to
try."</p>

<p>Jacqueline whispered: "Cynthia and I want to be alone for a little
while. Take him away, Jim."</p>

<p>So Desboro lugged off the happy but demoralised suitor and planted
him in a library chair vigorously.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "how about it? Has she accepted you?"</p>

<p>"She hasn't said a word yet. I've done nothing but talk and she's
done nothing but listen. It knocked me galley west, too. But it
happened before I realised it. She was playing on the piano, and
suddenly I knew that I wanted to marry her. And I said 'You darling!'
And she grew white and began to cry."</p>

<p>"Did you ask her to marry you?"</p>

<p>"About a thousand times."</p>

<p>"Didn't she say anything?"</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>"That's odd," said Desboro, troubled.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the clock struck.</p>

<p>"Come on, anyway," he said, "we've scarcely time to dress."</p>

<p>In his room later, tying his tie, Cairns' uncertainty clouded
his own happiness a little; and when he emerged to wait in the
sitting-room for Jacqueline, he was still worrying over it.</p>

<p>When Jacqueline opened her door and saw his perplexed and anxious
face, she came forward in her pretty dinner gown, startled, wondering.</p>

<p>"What is it, Jim?" she asked, her heart, still sensitive from
the old, healed wounds, sinking again in spite of her.</p>

<p>"I'm worried about that girl&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>What</em> girl!"</p>

<p>"Cynthia&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh! <em>That!</em> Jim, you frightened me!" She laid one hand
on her heart for a moment, breathed deeply her relief, then looked
at him and laughed.</p>

<p>"Silly! Of course she loves him."</p>

<p>"Jack says that she didn't utter a word&#11834;"</p>

<p>"She uttered several to me. Rather foolish ones, Jim&mdash;about her
life's business&mdash;the stage&mdash;and love. As though love and the business
of life were incompatible! Anyway, she'd choose him."</p>

<p>"Is she going to accept him?"</p>

<p>"Of course she is. I &mdash;I don't mean it in criticism&mdash;and
I love Cynthia&mdash;but I think she is a trifle temperamental&mdash;as
well as being the dearest, sweetest girl in the world&#11834;"</p>

<p>She took his arm with a pretty confidence of ownership that secretly
thrilled him, and they went down stairs together, she talking
all the while.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you?" she whispered, as they caught a glimpse
of the library in passing, where Cairns stood holding Cynthia's
hands between his own and kissing them. "Wait, Jim, darling! You
mustn't interrupt them&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I'm going to!" he said, exasperated. "I want to know what they're
going to do&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Jim!"</p>

<p>"Oh, all right, dear. Only they gave me a good scare when I wanted
to be alone with you."</p>

<p>She pressed his arm slightly:</p>

<p>"You haven't noticed my gown."</p>

<p>"It's a dream!" He kissed her shoulder lace, and she flushed
and caught his arm, then laughed, disconcerted by her own shyness.</p>

<p>Farris presented himself with a tray of cocktails.</p>

<p>"Jack! Come on!" called Desboro; and, as that gentleman sauntered
into view with Cynthia on his arm, something in the girl's delicious
and abashed beauty convinced her host. He stretched out his hand;
she took it, looking at him out of confused but sincere eyes.</p>

<p>"Is it all right to wish you happiness, Cynthia?"</p>

<p>"It is quite all right&mdash;thank you."</p>

<p>"And to drink this H. P. W. to your health and happiness?"</p>

<p>"That," she said laughingly, "is far more serious. But&mdash;you may
do so, please."</p>

<p>The ceremony ended, Desboro said to Jacqueline, deprecatingly:</p>

<p>"This promises to be a jolly, but a rather noisy, dinner. Do
you mind?"</p>

<p>And it was both&mdash;an exceedingly jolly and unusually noisy dinner
for four. Jacqueline and Cynthia both consented to taste the champagne
in honour of this occasion only; then set aside their glasses,
inflexible in their prejudice. Which boded well for everybody
concerned, especially to two young men to whom any countenance
of that sort might ultimately have proved no kindness.</p>

<p>And Jacqueline was as wise as she was beautiful; and Cynthia's
intuition matched her youthful loveliness, making logic superfluous.</p>

<p>Feeling desperately frivolous after coffee, they lugged out an
old-time card table and played an old-time game of cards&mdash;piquet&mdash;gambling
so recklessly that Desboro lost several cents to Cairns before
the evening was over, and Jacqueline felt that she had been dreadfully
and rather delightfully imprudent.</p>

<p>Then midnight sounded from the distant stable clock, and every
timepiece in the house echoed the far Westminster chimes.</p>

<p>Good-nights were said; Jacqueline went away with Cynthia to the
latter's room; Desboro accompanied Cairns, and endured the latter's
rhapsodies as long as he could, ultimately escaping.</p>

<p>In their sitting-room Jacqueline was standing beside the bowl
of white carnations, looking down at them. When he entered she
did not raise her head until he took her into his arms. Then she
looked up into his eyes and lifted her face. And for the first
time her warm lips responded to his kiss.</p>

<p>She trembled a little as he held her, and laid her cheek against
his breast, both hands resting on his shoulders. After a while
he was aware that her heart was beating as though she were frightened.</p>

<p>"Dearest," he whispered.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"Dearest?"</p>

<p>He could feel her trembling.</p>

<p>After a long while he said, very gently: "Come back and say good-night
to me when you are ready, dear." And quietly released her.</p>

<p>And she went away slowly to her room, not looking at him. And
did not return.</p>

<p>So at one o'clock he turned off the lights and went into his
own room. It was bright with moonlight. On his dresser lay a white
carnation and a key. But he did not see them.</p>

<p>Far away in the woods he heard the stream rushing, bank full,
through the darkness, and he listened as he moved about in the
moonlight. Tranquil, he looked out at the night for a moment,
then quietly composed himself to slumber, not doubting, serene,
happy, convinced that her love was his.</p>

<p>For a long while he thought of her; and, thinking, dreamed of
her at last&mdash;so vividly that into his vision stole the perfume
of her hair and the faint fresh scent of her hands, as when he
had kissed the slender fingers. And the warmth of her, too, seemed
real, and the sweetness of her breath.</p>

<p>His eyes unclosed. She lay there, in her frail Chinese robe,
curled up beside him in the moonlight, her splendid hair framing
a face as pale as the flower that had fallen from her half-closed
hand. And at first he thought she was asleep.</p>

<p>Then, in the moonlight, her eyes opened divinely, met his, lingered
unafraid, and were slowly veiled again. Neither stirred until,
at last, her arms stole up around his neck and her lips whispered
his name as though it were a holy name, loved, honoured, and adored.</p>

<p><em>THE END</em></p>
