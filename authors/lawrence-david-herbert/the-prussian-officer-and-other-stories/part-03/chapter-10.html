<p>By the big gate of the railway, in the fence, was a little gate,
that he kept locked.  As he unfastened it, he watched the kitchen
light that shone on to the bushes and the snow outside.  It was a
candle burning till night set in, he thought to himself.  He slid
down the steep path to the level below.  He liked making the first
marks in the smooth snow.  Then he came through the bushes to the
house.  The two women heard his heavy boots ring outside on the
scraper, and his voice as he opened the door:</p>

<p>&quot;How much worth of oil do you reckon to save by that candle,
mother?&quot;  He liked a good light from the lamp.</p>

<p>He had just put down his bottle and snap-bag and was hanging his
coat behind the scullery door, when Miss Louisa came upon him.  He
was startled, but he smiled.</p>

<p>His eyes began to laugh - then his face went suddenly straight, and
he was afraid.</p>

<p>&quot;Your mother's had an accident,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;How?&quot; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&quot;In the garden,&quot; she answered.  He hesitated with his coat in his
hands.  Then he hung it up and turned to the kitchen.</p>

<p>&quot;Is she in bed?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Miss Louisa, who found it hard to deceive him.  He was
silent.  He went into the kitchen, sat down heavily in his father's
old chair, and began to pull off his boots.  His head was small,
rather finely shapen.  His brown hair, close and crisp, would look
jolly whatever happened.  He wore heavy moleskin trousers that gave
off the stale, exhausted scent of the pit.  Having put on his
slippers, he carried his boots into the scullery.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; he asked, afraid.</p>

<p>&quot;Something internal,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p>He went upstairs.  His mother kept herself calm for his coming.
Louisa felt his tread shake the plaster floor of the bedroom above.</p>

<p>&quot;What have you done?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;It's nothing, my lad,&quot; said the old woman, rather hard.  &quot;It's
nothing.  You needn't fret, my boy, it's nothing more the matter
with me than I had yesterday, or last week.  The doctor said I'd
done nothing serious.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What were you doing?&quot; asked her son.</p>

<p>&quot;I was pulling up a cabbage, and I suppose I pulled too hard; for,
oh - there was such a pain - &quot;</p>

<p>Her son looked at her quickly.  She hardened herself.</p>

<p>&quot;But who doesn't have a sudden pain sometimes, my boy.  We all do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what's it done?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; she said, &quot;but I don't suppose it's anything.&quot;</p>

<p>The big lamp in the corner was screened with a dark green, so that
he could scarcely see her face.  He was strung tight with
apprehension and many emotions.  Then his brow knitted.</p>

<p>&quot;What did you go pulling your inside out at cabbages for,&quot; he
asked, &quot;and the ground frozen?  You'd go on dragging and dragging,
if you killed yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Somebody's got to get them,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;You needn't do yourself harm.&quot;</p>

<p>But they had reached futility.</p>

<p>Miss Louisa could hear plainly downstairs.  Her heart sank.  It
seemed so hopeless between them.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure it's nothing much, mother?&quot; he asked, appealing,
after a little silence.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, it's nothing,&quot; said the old woman, rather bitter.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want you to - to - to be badly - you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go an' get your dinner,&quot; she said.  She knew she was going to die:
moreover, the pain was torture just then.  &quot;They're only cosseting
me up a bit because I'm an old woman.  Miss Louisa's VERY good - and
she'll have got your dinner ready, so you'd better go and eat it.&quot;</p>

<p>He felt stupid and ashamed.  His mother put him off.  He had to
turn away.  The pain burned in his bowels.  He went downstairs.
The mother was glad he was gone, so that she could moan with pain.</p>

<p>He had resumed the old habit of eating before he washed himself.
Miss Louisa served his dinner.  It was strange and exciting to her.
She was strung up tense, trying to understand him and his mother.
She watched him as he sat.  He was turned away from his food,
looking in the fire.  Her soul watched him, trying to see what he
was.  His black face and arms were uncouth, he was foreign.  His
face was masked black with coal-dust.  She could not see him, she
could not even know him.  The brown eyebrows, the steady eyes, the
coarse, small moustache above the closed mouth - these were the only
familiar indications.  What was he, as he sat there in his pit-
dirt?  She could not see him, and it hurt her.</p>

<p>She ran upstairs, presently coming down with the flannels and the
bran-bag, to heat them, because the pain was on again.</p>

<p>He was half-way through his dinner.  He put down the fork, suddenly
nauseated.</p>

<p>&quot;They will soothe the wrench,&quot; she said.  He watched, useless and
left out.</p>

<p>&quot;Is she bad?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I think she is,&quot; she answered.</p>

<p>It was useless for him to stir or comment.  Louisa was busy.  She
went upstairs.  The poor old woman was in a white, cold sweat of
pain.  Louisa's face was sullen with suffering as she went about to
relieve her.  Then she sat and waited.  The pain passed gradually,
the old woman sank into a state of coma.  Louisa still sat silent
by the bed.  She heard the sound of water downstairs.  Then came
the voice of the old mother, faint but unrelaxing:</p>

<p>&quot;Alfred's washing himself - he'll want his back washing - &quot;</p>

<p>Louisa listened anxiously, wondering what the sick woman wanted.</p>

<p>&quot;He can't bear if his back isn't washed - &quot; the old woman persisted,
in a cruel attention to his needs.  Louisa rose and wiped the sweat
from the yellowish brow.</p>

<p>&quot;I will go down,&quot; she said soothingly.</p>

<p>&quot;If you would,&quot; murmured the sick woman.</p>

<p>Louisa waited a moment.  Mrs Durant closed her eyes, having
discharged her duty.  The young woman went downstairs.  Herself, or
the man, what did they matter?  Only the suffering woman must be
considered.</p>

<p>Alfred was kneeling on the hearthrug, stripped to the waist,
washing himself in a large panchion of earthenware.  He did so
every evening, when he had eaten his dinner; his brothers had done
so before him.  But Miss Louisa was strange in the house.</p>

<p>He was mechanically rubbing the white lather on his head, with a
repeated, unconscious movement, his hand every now and then passing
over his neck.  Louisa watched.  She had to brace herself to this
also.  He bent his head into the water, washed it free of soap, and
pressed the water out of his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Your mother said you would want your back washing,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Curious how it hurt her to take part in their fixed routine of
life!  Louisa felt the almost repulsive intimacy being forced upon
her.  It was all so common, so like herding.  She lost her own
distinctness.</p>

<p>He ducked his face round, looking up at her in what was a very
comical way.  She had to harden herself.</p>

<p>&quot;How funny he looks with his face upside down,&quot; she thought.  After
all, there was a difference between her and the common people.  The
water in which his arms were plunged was quite black, the soap-
froth was darkish.  She could scarcely conceive him as human.
Mechanically, under the influence of habit, he groped in the black
water, fished out soap and flannel, and handed them backward to
Louisa.  Then he remained rigid and submissive, his two arms thrust
straight in the panchion, supporting the weight of his shoulders.
His skin was beautifully white and unblemished, of an opaque, solid
whiteness.  Gradually Louisa saw it: this also was what he was.  It
fascinated her.  Her feeling of separateness passed away: she
ceased to draw back from contact with him and his mother.  There
was this living centre.  Her heart ran hot.  She had reached some
goal in this beautiful, clear, male body.  She loved him in a
white, impersonal heat.  But the sun-burnt, reddish neck and ears:
they were more personal, more curious.  A tenderness rose in her,
she loved even his queer ears.  A person - an intimate being he was
to her.  She put down the towel and went upstairs again, troubled
in her heart.  She had only seen one human being in her life - and
that was Mary.  All the rest were strangers.  Now her soul was
going to open, she was going to see another.  She felt strange and
pregnant.</p>

<p>&quot;He'll be more comfortable,&quot; murmured the sick woman abstractedly,
as Louisa entered the room.  The latter did not answer.  Her own
heart was heavy with its own responsibility.  Mrs Durant lay silent
awhile, then she murmured plaintively:</p>

<p>&quot;You mustn't mind, Miss Louisa.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why should I?&quot; replied Louisa, deeply moved.</p>

<p>&quot;It's what we're used to,&quot; said the old woman.</p>

<p>And Louisa felt herself excluded again from their life.  She sat in
pain, with the tears of disappointment distilling her heart.  Was
that all?</p>

<p>Alfred came upstairs.  He was clean, and in his shirt-sleeves.  He
looked a workman now.  Louisa felt that she and he were foreigners,
moving in different lives.  It dulled her again.  Oh, if she could
only find some fixed relations, something sure and abiding.</p>

<p>&quot;How do you feel?&quot; he said to his mother.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a bit better,&quot; she replied wearily, impersonally.  This
strange putting herself aside, this abstracting herself and
answering him only what she thought good for him to hear, made the
relations between mother and son poignant and cramping to Miss
Louisa.  It made the man so ineffectual, so nothing.  Louisa groped
as if she had lost him.  The mother was real and positive - he was
not very actual.  It puzzled and chilled the young woman.</p>

<p>&quot;I'd better fetch Mrs Harrison?&quot; he said, waiting for his mother to
decide.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose we shall have to have somebody,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p>Miss Louisa stood by, afraid to interfere in their business.  They
did not include her in their lives, they felt she had nothing to do
with them, except as a help from outside.  She was quite external
to them.  She felt hurt and powerless against this unconscious
difference.  But something patient and unyielding in her made her
say:</p>

<p>&quot;I will stay and do the nursing: you can't be left.&quot;</p>

<p>The other two were shy, and at a loss for an answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Wes'll manage to get somebody,&quot; said the old woman wearily.  She
did not care very much what happened, now.</p>

<p>&quot;I will stay until to-morrow, in any case,&quot; said Louisa.  &quot;Then we
can see.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure you've no right to trouble yourself,&quot; moaned the old
woman.  But she must leave herself in any hands.</p>

<p>Miss Louisa felt glad that she was admitted, even in an official
capacity.  She wanted to share their lives.  At home they would
need her, now Mary had come.  But they must manage without her.</p>

<p>&quot;I must write a note to the vicarage,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Alfred Durant looked at her inquiringly, for her service.  He had
always that intelligent readiness to serve, since he had been in
the Navy.  But there was a simple independence in his willingness,
which she loved.  She felt nevertheless it was hard to get at him.
He was so deferential, quick to take the slightest suggestion of an
order from her, implicitly, that she could not get at the man in
him.</p>

<p>He looked at her very keenly.  She noticed his eyes were golden
brown, with a very small pupil, the kind of eyes that can see a
long way off.  He stood alert, at military attention.  His face was
still rather weather-reddened.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you want pen and paper?&quot; he asked, with deferential suggestion
to a superior, which was more difficult for her than reserve.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, please,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He turned and went downstairs.  He seemed to her so self-contained,
so utterly sure in his movement.  How was she to approach him?  For
he would take not one step towards her.  He would only put himself
entirely and impersonally at her service, glad to serve her, but
keeping himself quite removed from her.  She could see he felt real
joy in doing anything for her, but any recognition would confuse
him and hurt him.  Strange it was to her, to have a man going about
the house in his shirt-sleeves, his waistcoat unbuttoned, his
throat bare, waiting on her.  He moved well, as if he had plenty of
life to spare.  She was attracted by his completeness.  And yet,
when all was ready, and there was nothing more for him to do, she
quivered, meeting his questioning look.</p>

<p>As she sat writing, he placed another candle near her.  The rather
dense light fell in two places on the overfoldings of her hair till
it glistened heavy and bright, like a dense golden plumage folded
up.  Then the nape of her neck was very white, with fine down and
pointed wisps of gold.  He watched it as it were a vision, losing
himself.  She was all that was beyond him, of revelation and
exquisiteness.  All that was ideal and beyond him, she was that - 
and he was lost to himself in looking at her.  She had no
connection with him.  He did not approach her.  She was there like
a wonderful distance.  But it was a treat, having her in the house.
Even with this anguish for his mother tightening about him, he was
sensible of the wonder of living this evening.  The candles
glistened on her hair, and seemed to fascinate him.  He felt a
little awe of her, and a sense of uplifting, that he and she and
his mother should be together for a time, in the strange, unknown
atmosphere.  And, when he got out of the house, he was afraid.  He
saw the stars above ringing with fine brightness, the snow beneath
just visible, and a new night was gathering round him.  He was
afraid almost with obliteration.  What was this new night ringing
about him, and what was he?  He could not recognize himself nor any
of his surroundings.  He was afraid to think of his mother.  And
yet his chest was conscious of her, and of what was happening to
her.  He could not escape from her, she carried him with her into
an unformed, unknown chaos.</p>
