The war-canoe with its savage load moved slowly toward the
break in the reef through which it must pass to gain the
open sea.  Tarzan, Mugambi, and Akut wielded the paddles,
for the shore kept the west wind from the little sail.
<P>
Sheeta crouched in the bow at the ape-man's feet, for it
had seemed best to Tarzan always to keep the wicked beast
as far from the other members of the party as possible,
since it would require little or no provocation to send him
at the throat of any than the white man, whom he evidently
now looked upon as his master.
<P>
In the stern was Mugambi, and just in front of him squatted
Akut, while between Akut and Tarzan the twelve hairy apes
sat upon their haunches, blinking dubiously this way and that,
and now and then turning their eyes longingly back toward shore.
<P>
All went well until the canoe had passed beyond the reef.  
Here the breeze struck the sail, sending the rude craft
lunging among the waves that ran higher and higher as
they drew away from the shore.
<P>
With the tossing of the boat the apes became panic-stricken.  
They first moved uneasily about, and then commenced grumbling
and whining.  With difficulty Akut kept them in hand for a time;
but when a particularly large wave struck the dugout
simultaneously with a little squall of wind their terror
broke all bounds, and, leaping to their feet, they
all but overturned the boat before Akut and Tarzan together
could quiet them.  At last calm was restored, and eventually
the apes became accustomed to the strange antics of their craft,
after which no more trouble was experienced with them.
<P>
The trip was uneventful, the wind held, and after ten hours'
steady sailing the black shadows of the coast loomed close
before the straining eyes of the ape-man in the bow.  It was
far too dark to distinguish whether they had approached close
to the mouth of the Ugambi or not, so Tarzan ran in through
the surf at the closest point to await the dawn.
<P>
The dugout turned broadside the instant that its nose
touched the sand, and immediately it rolled over, with all its
crew scrambling madly for the shore.  The next breaker rolled
them over and over, but eventually they all succeeded in
crawling to safety, and in a moment more their ungainly craft
had been washed up beside them.
<P>
The balance of the night the apes sat huddled close to one
another for warmth; while Mugambi built a fire close to them
over which he crouched.  Tarzan and Sheeta, however, were
of a different mind, for neither of them feared the jungle
night, and the insistent craving of their hunger sent them off
into the Stygian blackness of the forest in search of prey.
<P>
Side by side they walked when there was room for two abreast.  
At other times in single file, first one and then the
other in advance.  It was Tarzan who first caught the scent of
meat--a bull buffalo--and presently the two came stealthily
upon the sleeping beast in the midst of a dense jungle of
reeds close to a river.
<P>
Closer and closer they crept toward the unsuspecting beast,
Sheeta upon his right side and Tarzan upon his left nearest
the great heart.  They had hunted together now for some time,
so that they worked in unison, with only low, purring sounds
as signals.
<P>
For a moment they lay quite silent near their prey, and
then at a sign from the ape-man Sheeta sprang upon the
great back, burying his strong teeth in the bull's neck.  
Instantly the brute sprang to his feet with a bellow of
pain and rage, and at the same instant Tarzan rushed in
upon his left side with the stone knife, striking repeatedly
behind the shoulder.
<P>
One of the ape-man's hands clutched the thick mane, and
as the bull raced madly through the reeds the thing striking
at his life was dragged beside him.  Sheeta but clung
tenaciously to his hold upon the neck and back, biting deep in
an effort to reach the spine.
<P>
For several hundred yards the bellowing bull carried his two
savage antagonists, until at last the blade found his heart,
when with a final bellow that was half-scream he plunged headlong
to the earth.  Then Tarzan and Sheeta feasted to repletion.
<P>
After the meal the two curled up together in a thicket, the
man's black head pillowed upon the tawny side of the panther.  
Shortly after dawn they awoke and ate again, and then
returned to the beach that Tarzan might lead the balance of
the pack to the kill.
<P>
When the meal was done the brutes were for curling up to sleep,
so Tarzan and Mugambi set off in search of the Ugambi River.  
They had proceeded scarce a hundred yards when they came
suddenly upon a broad stream, which the Negro instantly
recognized as that down which he and his warriors
had paddled to the sea upon their ill-starred expedition.
<P>
The two now followed the stream down to the ocean, finding
that it emptied into a bay not over a mile from the point upon
the beach at which the canoe had been thrown the night before.
<P>
Tarzan was much elated by the discovery, as he knew that
in the vicinity of a large watercourse he should find natives,
and from some of these he had little doubt but that he should
obtain news of Rokoff and the child, for he felt reasonably
certain that the Russian would rid himself of the baby as
quickly as possible after having disposed of Tarzan.
<P>
He and Mugambi now righted and launched the dugout, though
it was a most difficult feat in the face of the surf which
rolled continuously in upon the beach; but at last they were
successful, and soon after were paddling up the coast toward
the mouth of the Ugambi.  Here they experienced considerable
difficulty in making an entrance against the combined
current and ebb tide, but by taking advantage of eddies close
in to shore they came about dusk to a point nearly opposite
the spot where they had left the pack asleep.
<P>
Making the craft fast to an overhanging bough, the two
made their way into the jungle, presently coming upon some
of the apes feeding upon fruit a little beyond the reeds where
the buffalo had fallen.  Sheeta was not anywhere to be seen,
nor did he return that night, so that Tarzan came to believe
that he had wandered away in search of his own kind.
<P>
Early the next morning the ape-man led his band down to the river,
and as he walked he gave vent to a series of shrill cries.  
Presently from a great distance and faintly there came
an answering scream, and a half-hour later the lithe form of
Sheeta bounded into view where the others of the pack were
clambering gingerly into the canoe.
<P>
The great beast, with arched back and purring like a
contented tabby, rubbed his sides against the ape-man, and then
at a word from the latter sprang lightly to his former place in
the bow of the dugout.
<P>
When all were in place it was discovered that two of the
apes of Akut were missing, and though both the king ape
and Tarzan called to them for the better part of an hour, there
was no response, and finally the boat put off without them.  
As it happened that the two missing ones were the very same
who had evinced the least desire to accompany the expedition
from the island, and had suffered the most from fright during
the voyage, Tarzan was quite sure that they had absented
themselves purposely rather than again enter the canoe.
<P>
As the party were putting in for the shore shortly after
noon to search for food a slender, naked savage watched
them for a moment from behind the dense screen of verdure
which lined the river's bank, then he melted away up-stream
before any of those in the canoe discovered him.
<P>
Like a deer he bounded along the narrow trail until, filled
with the excitement of his news, he burst into a native village
several miles above the point at which Tarzan and his pack
had stopped to hunt.
<P>
"Another white man is coming!" he cried to the chief
who squatted before the entrance to his circular hut.  
"Another white man, and with him are many warriors.  
They come in a great war-canoe to kill and rob as did
the black-bearded one who has just left us."
<P>
Kaviri leaped to his feet.  He had but recently had a taste
of the white man's medicine, and his savage heart was filled
with bitterness and hate.  In another moment the rumble of
the war-drums rose from the village, calling in the hunters
from the forest and the tillers from the fields.
<P>
Seven war-canoes were launched and manned by paint-daubed,
befeathered warriors.  Long spears bristled from the rude
battle-ships, as they slid noiselessly over the bosom of the water,
propelled by giant muscles rolling beneath glistening, ebony hides.
<P>
There was no beating of tom-toms now, nor blare of native
horn, for Kaviri was a crafty warrior, and it was in his mind
to take no chances, if they could be avoided.  He would swoop
noiselessly down with his seven canoes upon the single one
of the white man, and before the guns of the latter could
inflict much damage upon his people he would have overwhelmed
the enemy by force of numbers.
<P>
Kaviri's own canoe went in advance of the others a short
distance, and as it rounded a sharp bend in the river where
the swift current bore it rapidly on its way it came suddenly
upon the thing that Kaviri sought.
<P>
So close were the two canoes to one another that the black
had only an opportunity to note the white face in the bow of
the oncoming craft before the two touched and his own men
were upon their feet, yelling like mad devils and thrusting
their long spears at the occupants of the other canoe.
<P>
But a moment later, when Kaviri was able to realize the
nature of the crew that manned the white man's dugout, he
would have given all the beads and iron wire that he
possessed to have been safely within his distant village.  
Scarcely had the two craft come together than the frightful apes of
Akut rose, growling and barking, from the bottom of the
canoe, and, with long, hairy arms far outstretched, grasped
the menacing spears from the hands of Kaviri's warriors.
<P>
The blacks were overcome with terror, but there was nothing
to do other than to fight.  Now came the other war-canoes
rapidly down upon the two craft.  Their occupants were eager
to join the battle, for they thought that their foes were white
men and their native porters.
<P>
They swarmed about Tarzan's craft; but when they saw the nature
of the enemy all but one turned and paddled swiftly upriver.  
That one came too close to the ape-man's craft before
its occupants realized that their fellows were pitted
against demons instead of men.  As it touched Tarzan spoke
a few low words to Sheeta and Akut, so that before the
attacking warriors could draw away there sprang upon them
with a blood-freezing scream a huge panther, and into the
other end of their canoe clambered a great ape.
<P>
At one end the panther wrought fearful havoc with his
mighty talons and long, sharp fangs, while Akut at the other
buried his yellow canines in the necks of those that came
within his reach, hurling the terror-stricken blacks overboard
as he made his way toward the centre of the canoe.
<P>
Kaviri was so busily engaged with the demons that had
entered his own craft that he could offer no assistance to his
warriors in the other.  A giant of a white devil had wrested
his spear from him as though he, the mighty Kaviri, had been
but a new-born babe.  Hairy monsters were overcoming his
fighting men, and a black chieftain like himself was fighting
shoulder to shoulder with the hideous pack that opposed him.
<P>
Kaviri battled bravely against his antagonist, for he felt
that death had already claimed him, and so the least that he
could do would be to sell his life as dearly as possible; but it
was soon evident that his best was quite futile when pitted
against the superhuman brawn and agility of the creature that
at last found his throat and bent him back into the bottom of
the canoe.
<P>
Presently Kaviri's head began to whirl--objects became
confused and dim before his eyes--there was a great pain in
his chest as he struggled for the breath of life that the thing
upon him was shutting off for ever.  Then he lost consciousness.
<P>
When he opened his eyes once more he found, much to
his surprise, that he was not dead.  He lay, securely bound,
in the bottom of his own canoe.  A great panther sat upon its
haunches, looking down upon him.
<P>
Kaviri shuddered and closed his eyes again, waiting for
the ferocious creature to spring upon him and put him out of
his misery of terror.
<P>
After a moment, no rending fangs having buried themselves
in his trembling body, he again ventured to open his eyes.  
Beyond the panther kneeled the white giant who had
overcome him.
<P>
The man was wielding a paddle, while directly behind him
Kaviri saw some of his own warriors similarly engaged.  
Back of them again squatted several of the hairy apes.
<P>
Tarzan, seeing that the chief had regained consciousness,
addressed him.
<P>
"Your warriors tell me that you are the chief of a
numerous people, and that your name is Kaviri," he said.
<P>
"Yes," replied the black.
<P>
"Why did you attack me?  I came in peace."
<P>
"Another white man `came in peace' three moons ago,"
replied Kaviri; "and after we had brought him presents of a
goat and cassava and milk, he set upon us with his guns and
killed many of my people, and then went on his way, taking
all of our goats and many of our young men and women."
<P>
"I am not as this other white man," replied Tarzan.  
"I should not have harmed you had you not set upon me.  
Tell me, what was the face of this bad white man like?  I am
searching for one who has wronged me.  Possibly this may
be the very one."
<P>
"He was a man with a bad face, covered with a great,
black beard, and he was very, very wicked--yes, very
wicked indeed."
<P>
"Was there a little white child with him?" asked Tarzan,
his heart almost stopped as he awaited the black's answer.
<P>
"No, bwana," replied Kaviri, "the white child was not
with this man's party--it was with the other party."
<P>
"Other party!" exclaimed Tarzan.  "What other party?"
<P>
"With the party that the very bad white man was pursuing.  
There was a white man, woman, and the child, with six
Mosula porters.  They passed up the river three days ahead
of the very bad white man.  I think that they were running
away from him."
<P>
A white man, woman, and child!  Tarzan was puzzled.  The child
must be his little Jack; but who could the woman be--and the man? 
Was it possible that one of Rokoff's confederates had conspired
with some woman--who had accompanied the Russian--to steal
the baby from him?
<P>
If this was the case, they had doubtless purposed returning
the child to civilization and there either claiming a reward or
holding the little prisoner for ransom.
<P>
But now that Rokoff had succeeded in chasing them far inland,
up the savage river, there could be little doubt but
that he would eventually overhaul them, unless, as was still
more probable, they should be captured and killed by the
very cannibals farther up the Ugambi, to whom, Tarzan was now
convinced, it had been Rokoff's intention to deliver the baby.
<P>
As he talked to Kaviri the canoes had been moving steadily
up-river toward the chief's village.  Kaviri's warriors plied the
paddles in the three canoes, casting sidelong, terrified glances
at their hideous passengers.  Three of the apes of Akut had
been killed in the encounter, but there were, with Akut, eight
of the frightful beasts remaining, and there was Sheeta, the
panther, and Tarzan and Mugambi.
<P>
Kaviri's warriors thought that they had never seen so terrible
a crew in all their lives.  Momentarily they expected to
be pounced upon and torn asunder by some of their captors;
and, in fact, it was all that Tarzan and Mugambi and Akut
could do to keep the snarling, ill-natured brutes from snapping
at the glistening, naked bodies that brushed against them
now and then with the movements of the paddlers, whose
very fear added incitement to the beasts.
<P>
At Kaviri's camp Tarzan paused only long enough to eat
the food that the blacks furnished, and arrange with the
chief for a dozen men to man the paddles of his canoe.
<P>
Kaviri was only too glad to comply with any demands that
the ape-man might make if only such compliance would hasten
the departure of the horrid pack; but it was easier, he
discovered, to promise men than to furnish them, for when
his people learned his intentions those that had not already
fled into the jungle proceeded to do so without loss of time,
so that when Kaviri turned to point out those who were to
accompany Tarzan, he discovered that he was the only member
of his tribe left within the village.
<P>
Tarzan could not repress a smile.
<P>
"They do not seem anxious to accompany us," he said;
"but just remain quietly here, Kaviri, and presently you
shall see your people flocking to your side."
<P>
Then the ape-man rose, and, calling his pack about him,
commanded that Mugambi remain with Kaviri, and disappeared
in the jungle with Sheeta and the apes at his heels.
<P>
For half an hour the silence of the grim forest was broken
only by the ordinary sounds of the teeming life that but adds
to its lowering loneliness.  Kaviri and Mugambi sat alone in
the palisaded village, waiting.
<P>
Presently from a great distance came a hideous sound.  
Mugambi recognized the weird challenge of the ape-man.  
Immediately from different points of the compass rose a
horrid semicircle of similar shrieks and screams, punctuated
now and again by the blood-curdling cry of a hungry panther.
