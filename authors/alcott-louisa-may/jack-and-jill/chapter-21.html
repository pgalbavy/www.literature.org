<p>&quot;Now, Mr. Jack, it is a moral impossibility to get all those things
into one trunk, and you mustn't ask it of me,&quot; said Mrs. Pecq, in a
tone of despair, as she surveyed the heap of treasures she was
expected to pack for the boys.</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind the clothes, we only want a boating-suit apiece.
Mamma can put a few collars in her trunk for us; but these
necessary things <span style="text-decoration: underline">must</span> go,&quot; answered Jack, adding his target and
air-pistol to the pile of bats, fishing-tackle, games, and a choice
collection of shabby balls.</p>

<p>&quot;Those are the necessaries and clothes the luxuries, are they? Why
don't you add a velocipede, wheelbarrow, and printing-press, my
dear?&quot; asked Mrs. Pecq, while Jill turned up her nose at &quot;boys'
rubbish.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wish I could. Dare say we shall want them. Women don't know
what fellows need, and always must put in a lot of stiff shirts and
clean handkerchiefs and clothes-brushes and pots of cold cream.
We are going to rough it, and don't want any fuss and feathers,&quot;
said Jack, beginning to pack the precious balls in his rubber boots,
and strap them up with the umbrellas, rods, and bats, seeing that
there was no hope of a place in the trunk.</p>

<p>Here Frank came in with two big books, saying calmly, &quot;Just slip
these in somewhere, we shall need them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you are not to study at all, so you won't want those great
dictionaries,&quot; cried Jill, busily packing her new travelling-basket
with all sorts of little rolls, bags, and boxes.</p>

<p>&quot;They are not dics, but my Encyclopedia. We shall want to know
heaps of things, and this tells about everything. With those books,
and a microscope and a telescope, you could travel round the
world, and learn all you wanted to. Can't possibly get on without
them,&quot; said Frank, fondly patting his favorite work.</p>

<p>&quot;My patience! What queer cattle boys are!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Pecq,
while they all laughed. &quot;It can't be done, Mr. Frank; all the boxes
are brim full, and you'll have to leave those fat books behind, for
there's no place anywhere.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I'll carry them myself;&quot; and Frank tucked one under each
arm, with a determined air, which settled the matter.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose you'll study cockleology instead of boating, and read up
on polywogs while we play tennis, or go poking round with your
old spy-glass instead of having a jolly good time,&quot; said Jack,
hauling away on the strap till all was taut and ship-shape with the
bundle.</p>

<p>&quot;Tadpoles don't live in salt water, my son, and if you mean
conchology, you'd better say so. I shall play as much as I wish, and
when I want to know about any new or curious thing, I shall
consult my Cyclo, instead of bothering other people with
questions, or giving it up like a dunce;&quot; with which crushing reply
Frank departed, leaving Jill to pack and unpack her treasures a
dozen times, and Jack to dance jigs on the lids of the trunks till
they would shut.</p>

<p>A very happy party set off the next day, leaving Mrs. Pecq waving
her apron on the steps. Mrs. Minot carried the lunch, Jack his
precious bundle with trifles dropping out by the way, and Jill felt
very elegant bearing her new basket with red worsted cherries
bobbing on the outside. Frank actually did take the Encyclopedia,
done up in the roll of shawls, and whenever the others wondered
about anything - tides, lighthouses, towns, or natural productions - 
he brought forth one of the books and triumphantly read therefrom,
to the great merriment, if not edification, of his party.</p>

<p>A very short trip by rail and the rest of the journey by boat, to Jill's
great contentment, for she hated to be shut up; and while the lads
roved here and there she sat under the awning, too happy to talk.
But Mrs. Minot watched with real satisfaction how the fresh wind
blew the color back into the pale cheeks, how the eyes shone and
the heart filled with delight at seeing the lovely world again, and
being able to take a share in its active pleasures.</p>

<p>The Willows was a long, low house close to the beach, and as full
as a beehive of pleasant people, all intent on having a good time. A
great many children were swarming about, and Jill found it
impossible to sleep after her journey, there was such a lively
clatter of tongues on the piazzas, and so many feet going to and fro
in the halls. She lay down obediently while Mrs. Minot settled
matters in the two airy rooms and gave her some dinner, but she
kept popping up her head to look out of the window to see what
she could see. Just opposite stood an artist's cottage and studio,
with all manner of charming galleries, towers, steps, and even a
sort of drawbridge to pull up when the painter wished to be left in
peace. He was absent now, and the visitors took possession of this
fine play-place. Children were racing up and down the galleries,
ladies sitting in the tower, boys disporting themselves on the roof,
and young gentlemen preparing for theatricals in the large studio.</p>

<p>&quot;What fun I'll have over there,&quot; thought Jill, watching the merry
scene with intense interest, and wondering if the little girls she saw
were as nice as Molly and Merry.</p>

<p>Then there were glimpses of the sea beyond the green bank where
a path wound along to the beach, whence came the cool dash of
waves, and now and then the glimmer of a passing sail.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, when can I go out? It looks <span style="text-decoration: underline">so</span> lovely, I can't wait long,&quot; she
said, looking as eager as a little gull shut up in a cage and pining
for its home on the wide ocean.</p>

<p>&quot;As soon as it is a little cooler, dear, I'm getting ready for our trip,
but we must be careful and not do too much at once. 'Slow and
sure' is our motto,&quot; answered Mrs. Minot, busily collecting the
camp-stools, the shawls, the air-cushions, and the big parasols.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll be good, only do let me have my sailor-hat to wear, and my
new suit. I'm not a bit tired, and I do want to be like other folks
right off,&quot; said Jill, who had been improving rapidly of late, and
felt much elated at being able to drive out nearly every day, to
walk a little, and sit up some hours without any pain or fatigue.</p>

<p>To gratify her, the blue flannel suit with its white trimming was
put on, and Mamma was just buttoning the stout boots when Jack
thundered at the door, and burst in with all sorts of glorious news.</p>

<p>&quot;Do come out, mother, it's perfectly splendid on the beach! I've
found a nice place for Jill to sit, and it's only a step. Lots of capital
fellows here; one has a bicycle, and is going to teach us to ride. No
end of fun up at the hotel, and every one seems glad to see us. Two
ladies asked about Jill, and one of the girls has got some shells all
ready for her, Gerty Somebody, and her mother is so pretty and
jolly, I like her ever so much. They sit at our table, and Wally is
the boy, younger than I am, but very pleasant. Bacon is the fellow
in knickerbockers; just wish you could see what stout legs he's got!
Cox is the chap for me, though: we are going fishing to-morrow.
He's got a sweet-looking mother, and a sister for you, Jill. Now,
then, <span style="text-decoration: underline">do</span> come on, I'll take the traps.&quot;</p>

<p>Off they went, and Jill thought that very short walk to the shore the
most delightful she ever took; for people smiled at the little invalid
as she went slowly by leaning on Mrs. Minot's arm, while Jack
pranced in front, doing the honors, as if he owned the whole
Atlantic. A new world opened to her eyes as they came out upon
the pebbly beach full of people enjoying their afternoon
promenade. Jill save one rapturous &quot;Oh!&quot; and then sat on her stool,
forgetting everything but the beautiful blue ocean rolling away to
meet the sky, with nothing to break the wide expanse but a sail
here and there, a point of rocks on one hand, the little pier on the
other, and white gulls skimming by on their wide wings.</p>

<p>While she sat enjoying herself, Jack showed his mother the place
he had found, and a very nice one it was. Just under the green bank
lay an old boat propped up with some big stones. A willow
drooped over it, the tide rippled up within a few yards of it, and a
fine view of the waves could be seen as they dashed over the
rocks at the point.</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't it a good cubby-house? Ben Cox and I fixed it for Jill, and
she can have it for hers. Put her cushions and things there on the
sand the children have thrown in - that will make it soft; then these
seats will do for tables; and up in the bow I'm going to have that
old rusty tin boiler full of salt-water, so she can put seaweed and
crabs and all sorts of chaps in it for an aquarium, you know,&quot;
explained Jack, greatly interested in establishing his family
comfortably before he left them.</p>

<p>&quot;There couldn't be a nicer place, and it is very kind of you to get it
ready. Spread the shawls and settle Jill, then you needn't think of
us any more, but go and scramble with Frank. I see him over there
with his spy-glass and some pleasant-looking boys,&quot; said Mamma,
bustling about in great spirits.</p>

<p>So the red cushions were placed, the plaids laid, and the little
work-basket set upon the seat, all ready for Jill, who was charmed
with her nest, and cuddled down under the big parasol, declaring
she would keep house there every day.</p>

<p>Even the old boiler pleased her, and Jack raced over the beach to
begin his search for inhabitants for the new aquarium, leaving Jill
to make friends with some pretty babies digging in the sand, while
Mamma sat on the camp-stool and talked with a friend from
Harmony Village.</p>

<p>It seemed as if there could not be anything more delightful than to
lie there lulled by the sound of the sea, watching the sunset and
listening to the pleasant babble of little voices close by. But when
they went to tea in the great hall, with six tables full of merry
people, and half a dozen maids flying about, Jill thought that was
even better, because it was so new to her. Gerty and Wally nodded
to her, and their pretty mamma was so kind and so gay, that Jill
could not feel bashful after the first few minutes, and soon looked
about her, sure of seeing friendly faces everywhere. Frank and Jack
ate as if the salt air had already improved their appetites, and
talked about Bacon and Cox as if they had been bosom friends for
years. Mamma was as happy as they, for her friend, Mrs.
Hammond, sat close by; and this rosy lady, who had been a
physician, cheered her up by predicting that Jill would soon be
running about as well as ever.</p>

<p>But the best of all was in the evening, when the elder people
gathered in the parlors and played Twenty Questions, while the
children looked on for an hour before going to bed, much amused
at the sight of grown people laughing, squabbling, dodging, and
joking as if they had all become young again; for, as every one
knows, it is impossible to help lively skirmishes when that game is
played. Jill lay in the sofa corner enjoying it all immensely; for she
never saw anything so droll, and found it capital fun to help guess
the thing, or try to puzzle the opposite side. Her quick wits and
bright face attracted people, and in the pauses of the sport she held
quite a levee, for everybody was interested in the little invalid. The
girls shyly made friends in their own way, the mammas told
thrilling tales of the accidents their darlings had survived, several
gentlemen kindly offered their boats, and the boys, with the best
intentions in life, suggested strolls of two or three miles to Rafe's
Chasm and Norman's Woe, or invited her to tennis and archery, as
if violent exercise was the cure for all human ills. She was very
grateful, and reluctantly went away to bed, declaring, when she got
upstairs, that these new friends were the dearest people she ever
met, and the Willows the most delightful place in the whole world.</p>

<p>Next day a new life began for the young folks - a very healthy,
happy life; and all threw themselves into it so heartily, that it was
impossible to help getting great good from it, for these summer
weeks, if well spent, work miracles in tired bodies and souls.
Frank took a fancy to the bicycle boy, and, being able to hire one
of the breakneck articles, soon learned to ride it; and the two might
be seen wildly working their long legs on certain smooth stretches
of road, or getting up their muscle rowing about the bay till they
were almost as brown and nautical in appearance and language as
the fishermen who lived in nooks and corners along the shore.</p>

<p>Jack struck up a great friendship with the sturdy Bacon and the
agreeable Cox: the latter, being about his own age, was his
especial favorite; and they soon were called Box and Cox by the
other fellows, which did not annoy them a bit, as both had played
parts in that immortal farce. They had capital times fishing,
scrambling over the rocks, playing ball and tennis, and rainy days
they took possession of the studio opposite, drew up the portcullis,
and gallantly defended the castle, which some of the others
besieged with old umbrellas for shields, bats for battering-rams,
and bunches of burrs for cannon-balls. Great larks went on over
there, while the girls applauded from the piazza or chamber-windows,
and made a gay flag for the victors to display from the tower when
the fight was over.</p>

<p>But Jill had the best time of all, for each day brought increasing
strength and spirits, and she improved so fast it was hard to believe
that she was the same girl who lay so long almost helpless in the
Bird Room at home. Such lively letters as she sent her mother,
all about her new friends, her fine sails, drives, and little walks;
the good times she had in the evening, the lovely things people
gave her, and she was learning to make with shells and sea-weed,
and what splendid fun it was to keep house in a boat.</p>

<p>This last amusement soon grew quite absorbing, and her &quot;cubby,&quot;
as she called it, rapidly became a pretty grotto, where she lived
like a little mermaid, daily loving more and more the beauty of the
wonderful sea. Finding the boat too sunny at times, the boys cut
long willow boughs and arched them over the seats, laying
hemlock branches across till a green roof made it cool and shady
inside. There Jill sat or lay among her cushions reading, trying to
sketch, sorting shells, drying gay sea-weeds, or watching her crabs,
jelly-fish, and anemones in the old boiler, now buried in sand and
edged about with moss from the woods.</p>

<p>Nobody disturbed her treasures, but kindly added to them, and
often when she went to her nest she found fruit or flowers, books
or bon-bons, laid ready for her. Every one pitied and liked the
bright little girl who could not run and frisk with the rest, who was
so patient and cheerful after her long confinement, ready to help
others, and so grateful for any small favor. She found now that the
weary months had not been wasted, and was very happy to
discover in herself a new sort of strength and sweetness that was
not only a comfort to her, but made those about her love and trust
her. The songs she had learned attracted the babies, who would
leave their play to peep at her and listen when she sung over her
work. Passers-by paused to hear the blithe voice of the bird in the
green cage, and other invalids, strolling on the beach, would take
heart when they saw the child so happy in spite of her great trial.</p>

<p>The boys kept all their marine curiosities for her, and were always
ready to take her a row or a sail, as the bay was safe and that sort
of travelling suited her better than driving. But the girls had capital
times together, and it did Jill good to see another sort from those
she knew at home. She had been so much petted of late, that she
was getting rather vain of her small accomplishments, and being
with strangers richer, better bred and educated than herself, made
her more humble in some things, while it showed her the worth of
such virtues as she could honestly claim. Mamie Cox took her to
drive in the fine carriage of her mamma, and Jill was much
impressed by the fact that Mamie was not a bit proud about it, and
did not put on any airs, though she had a maid to take care of her.
Gerty wore pretty costumes, and came down with pink and blue
ribbons in her hair that Jill envied very much; yet Gerty liked her
curls, and longed to have some, while her mother, &quot;the lady from
Philadelphia,&quot; as they called her, was so kind and gay that Jill
quite adored her, and always felt as if sunshine had come into the
room when she entered. Two little sisters were very interesting to
her, and made her long for one of her own when she saw them
going about together and heard them talk of their pleasant home,
where the great silk factories were. But they invited her to come
and see the wonderful cocoons, and taught her to knot pretty gray
fringe on a cushion, which delighted her, being so new and easy.
There were several other nice little lasses, and they all gathered
about Jill with the sweet sympathy children are so quick to show
toward those in pain or misfortune. She thought they would not
care for a poor little girl like herself, yet here she was the queen of
the troupe, and this discovery touched and pleased her very much.</p>

<p>In the morning they camped round the boat on the stones with
books, gay work, and merry chatter, till bathing-time. Then the
beach was full of life and fun, for every one looked so droll in the
flannel suits, it was hard to believe that the neat ladies and
respectable gentlemen who went into the little houses could be the
same persons as the queer, short-skirted women with old hats tied
down, and bareheaded, barefooted men in old suits, who came
skipping over the sand to disport themselves in the sea in the most
undignified ways. The boys raced about, looking like circus-
tumblers, and the babies were regular little cupids, running away
from the waves that tried to kiss their flying feet.</p>

<p>Some of the young ladies and girls were famous swimmers, and
looked very pretty in their bright red and blue costumes, with loose
hair and gay stockings, as they danced into the water and floated
away as fearlessly as real mermaidens. Jill had her quiet dip and
good rubbing each fine day, and then lay upon the warm sand
watching the pranks of the others, and longing to run and dive and
shout and tumble with the rest. Now that she was among the well
and active, it seemed harder to be patient than when shut up and
unable to stir. She felt so much better, and had so little pain to
remind her of past troubles, it was almost impossible to help
forgetting the poor back and letting her recovered spirits run away
with her. If Mrs. Minot had not kept good watch, she would have
been off more than once, so eager was she to be &quot;like other girls&quot;
again, so difficult was it to keep the restless feet quietly folded
among the red cushions.</p>

<p>One day she did yield to temptation, and took a little voyage which
might have been her last, owing to the carelessness of those whom
she trusted. It was a good lesson, and made her as meek as a lamb
during the rest of her stay. Mrs. Minot drove to Gloucester one
afternoon, leaving Jill safely established after her nap in the boat,
with Gerty and Mamie making lace beside her.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't try to walk or run about, my dear. Sit on the piazza if you
get tired of this, and amuse yourself quietly till I come back. I'll
not forget the worsted and the canvas,&quot; said Mamma, peeping over
the bank for a last word as she waited for the omnibus to come
along.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, <span style="text-decoration: underline">don't</span> forget the Gibraltars!&quot; cried Jill, popping her head
out of the green roof.</p>

<p>&quot;Nor the bananas, please!&quot; added Gerty, looking round one end.</p>

<p>&quot;Nor the pink and blue ribbon to tie our shell-baskets,&quot; called
Mamie, nearly tumbling into the aquarium at the other end.</p>

<p>Mrs. Minot laughed, and promised, and rumbled away, leaving Jill
to an experience which she never forgot.</p>

<p>For half an hour the little girls worked busily, then the boys came
for Gerty and Mamie to go to the Chasm with a party of friends
who were to leave next day. Off they went, and Jill felt very lonely
as the gay voices died away. Every one had gone somewhere, and
only little Harry Hammond and his maid were on the beach. Two
or three sand-pipers ran about among the pebbles, and Jill envied
them their nimble legs so much, that she could not resist getting up
to take a few steps. She longed to run straight away over the firm,
smooth sand, and feel again the delight of swift motion; but she
dared not try it, and stood leaning on her tall parasol with her
book in her hand, when Frank, Jack, and the bicycle boy came
rowing lazily along and hailed her.</p>

<p>&quot;Come for a sail, Jill? Take you anywhere you like,&quot; called Jack,
touched by the lonely figure on the beach.</p>

<p>&quot;I'd love to go, if you will row. Mamma made me promise not to
go sailing without a man to take care of me. Would it spoil your
fun to have me?&quot; answered Jill, eagerly.</p>

<p>&quot;Not a bit; come out on the big stones and we'll take you aboard,&quot;
said Frank, as they steered to the place where she could embark the
easiest.</p>

<p>&quot;All the rest are gone to the Chasm. I wanted to go, because I've
never seen it; but, of course, I had to give it up, as I do most of the
fun;&quot; and Jill sat down with an impatient sigh.</p>

<p>&quot;We'll row you round there. Can't land, but you can see the place
and shout to the others, if that will be any comfort to you,&quot;
proposed Frank, as they pulled away round the pier.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes, that would be lovely!&quot; and Jill smiled at Jack, who was
steering, for she found it impossible to be dismal now with the
fresh wind blowing in her face, the blue waves slapping against the
boat, and three good-natured lads ready to gratify her wishes.</p>

<p>Away they went, laughing and talking gayly till they came to
Goodwin's Rocks, where an unusual number of people were to be
seen though the tide was going out, and no white spray was
dashing high into the air to make a sight worth seeing.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you suppose they are about? Never saw such a lot of
folks at this time. Shouldn't wonder if something had happened. I
say, put me ashore, and I'll cut up and see,&quot; said the bicycle boy,
who was of an inquiring turn.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll go with you,&quot; said Frank; &quot;it won't take but a minute, and I'd
like to discover what it is. May be something we ought to know
about.&quot;</p>

<p>So the boys pulled round into a quiet nook, and the two elder ones
scrambled up the rocks, to disappear in the crowd. Five, ten,
fifteen minutes passed, and they did not return. Jack grew
impatient, so did Jill, and bade him run up and bring them back.
Glad to know what kept them, Jack departed, to be swallowed up
in his turn, for not a sign of a boy did she see after that; and,
having vainly strained her eyes to discover the attraction which
held them, she gave it up, lay down on their jackets, and began to
read.</p>

<p>Then the treacherous tide, as it ebbed lower and lower down the
beach, began to lure the boat away; for it was not fastened, and
when lightened of its load was an easy prize to the hungry sea,
always ready to steal all it can. Jill knew nothing of this, for her
story was dull, the gentle motion proved soothing, and before she
knew it she was asleep. Little by little the runaway boat slid farther
from the shore, and presently was floating out to sea with its
drowsy freight, while the careless boys, unconscious of the time
they were wasting, lingered to see group after group photographed
by the enterprising man who had trundled his camera to the rocks.</p>

<p>In the midst of a dream about home, Jill was roused by a loud
shout, and, starting up so suddenly that the sun-umbrella went
overboard, she found herself sailing off alone, while the distracted
lads roared and beckoned vainly from the cove. The oars lay at
their feet, where they left them; and the poor child was quite
helpless, for she could not manage the sail, and even the parasol,
with which she might have paddled a little, had gone down with all
sail set. For a minute, Jill was so frightened that she could only
look about her with a scared face, and wonder if drowning was a
very disagreeable thing. Then the sight of the bicycle boy
struggling with Jack, who seemed inclined to swim after her, and
Frank shouting wildly, &quot;Hold on! Come back!&quot; made her laugh in
spite of her fear, it was so comical, and their distress so much
greater than hers, since it was their own carelessness which caused
the trouble.</p>

<p>&quot;I can't come back! There's nothing to hold on to! You didn't fasten
me, and now I don't know where I'm going!&quot; cried Jill, looking
from the shore to the treacherous sea that was gently carrying her
away.</p>

<p>&quot;Keep cool! We'll get a boat and come after you,&quot; roared Frank,
before he followed Jack, who had collected his wits and was
tearing up the rocks like a chamois hunter.</p>

<p>The bicycle boy calmly sat down to keep his eye on the runaway,
calling out from time to time such cheering remarks as &quot;All aboard
for Liverpool! Give my love to Victoria! Luff and bear away when
you come to Halifax! If you are hard up for provisions, you'll find
an apple and some bait in my coat-pocket,&quot; and other directions for
a comfortable voyage, till his voice was lost in the distance as a
stronger current bore her swiftly away and the big waves began to
tumble and splash.</p>

<p>At first Jill had laughed at his efforts to keep up her spirits, but
when the boat floated round a point of rock that shut in the cove,
she felt all alone, and sat quite still, wondering what would
become of her. She turned her back to the sea and looked at the
dear, safe land, which never had seemed so green and beautiful
before. Up on the hill rustled the wood through which the happy
party were wandering to the Chasm. On the rocks she still saw the
crowd all busy with their own affairs, unconscious of her danger.
Here and there artists were sketching in picturesque spots, and in
one place an old gentleman sat fishing peacefully. Jill called and
waved her handkerchief, but he never looked up, and an ugly little
dog barked at her in what seemed to her a most cruel way.</p>

<p>&quot;Nobody sees or hears or cares, and those horrid boys will never
catch up!&quot; she cried in despair, as the boat began to rock more and
more, and the loud swash of water dashing in and out of the
Chasm drew nearer and nearer. Holding on now with both hands
she turned and looked straight before her, pale and shivering,
while her eyes tried to see some sign of hope among the steep
cliffs that rose up on the left. No one was there, though usually at
this hour they were full of visitors, and it was time for the walkers
to have arrived.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder if Gerty and Mamie will be sorry if I'm drowned,&quot;
thought Jill, remembering the poor girl who had been lost in the
Chasm not long ago. Her lively fancy pictured the grief of her
friends at her loss; but that did not help or comfort her now, and as
her anxious gaze wandered along the shore, she said aloud, in a
pensive tone, - </p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps I shall be wrecked on Norman's Woe, and somebody will
make poetry about me. It would be pretty to read, but I don't want
to die that way. Oh, why did I come! Why didn't I stay safe and
comfortable in my own boat?&quot;</p>

<p>At the thought a sob rose, and poor Jill laid her head down on her
lap to cry with all her heart, feeling very helpless, small, and
forsaken alone there on the great sea. In the midst of her tears
came the thought, &quot;When people are in danger, they ask God to
save them;&quot; and, slipping down upon her knees, she said her prayer
as she had never said it before, for when human help seems gone
we turn to Him as naturally as lost children cry to their father, and
feel sure that he will hear and answer them.</p>

<p>After that she felt better, and wiped away the drops that blinded
her, to look out again like a shipwrecked mariner watching for a
sail. And there it was! Close by, coming swiftly on with a man
behind it, a sturdy brown fisher, busy with his lobster-pots, and
quite unconscious how like an angel he looked to the helpless little
girl in the rudderless boat.</p>

<p>&quot;Hi! hi! Oh, please do stop and get me! I'm lost, no oars, nobody to
fix the sail! Oh, oh! please come!&quot; screamed Jill, waving her hat
frantically as the other boat skimmed by and the man stared at her
as if she really was a mermaid with a fishy tail.</p>

<p>&quot;Keep still! I'll come about and fetch you!&quot; he called out; and Jill
obeyed, sitting like a little image of faith, till with a good deal of
shifting and flapping of the sail, the other boat came alongside and
took her in tow.</p>

<p>A few words told the story, and in five minutes she was sitting
snugly tucked up watching an unpleasant mass of lobsters flap
about dangerously near her toes, while the boat bounded over the
waves with a delightful motion, and every instant brought her
nearer home. She did not say much, but felt a good deal; and when
they met two boats coming to meet her, manned by very anxious
crews of men and boys, she was so pale and quiet that Jack was
quite bowed down with remorse, and Frank nearly pitched the
bicycle boy overboard because he gayly asked Jill how she left her
friends in England. There was great rejoicing over her, for the
people on the rocks had heard of her loss, and ran about like ants
when their hill is disturbed. Of course half a dozen amiable souls
posted off to the Willows to tell the family that the little girl was
drowned, so that when the rescuers appeared quite a crowd was
assembled on the beach to welcome her. But Jill felt so used up
with her own share of the excitement that she was glad to be
carried to the house by Frank and Jack, and laid upon her bed,
where Mrs. Hammond soon restored her with sugar-coated pills,
and words even sweeter and more soothing.</p>

<p>Other people, busied with their own pleasures, forgot all about it
by the next day; but Jill remembered that hour long afterward, both
awake and asleep, for her dreams were troubled, and she often
started up imploring someone to save her. Then she would recall
the moment when, feeling most helpless, she had asked for help,
and it had come as quickly as if that tearful little cry had been
heard and answered, though her voice had been drowned by the
dash of the waves that seemed ready to devour her. This made
a deep impression on her, and a sense of childlike faith in the
Father of all began to grow up within her; for in that lonely
voyage, short as it was, she had found a very precious treasure to
keep for ever, to lean on, and to love during the longer voyage
which all must take before we reach our home.</p>
