<p>That Naples of mine is like a soiled coronet of white gems, sparkling
only from far away. But I love it altogether, near or far, and
my heart would have leaped to return to it for its own sake, but
to come to it as we did, knowing that the only lady in the world
was there.... Again, this is one of those things I possess no
knowledge how to tell, and that those who know do know. How I
had longed for the time to come, how I had feared it, how I had
made pictures of it!</p>

<p>Yet I feared not so much as my friend, for he had a dim, small
hope, and I had none. How could I have? <em>I&mdash;</em>a man whose
head had been painted? <em>I&mdash;</em>for whom her great heart had
sorrowed as for the thin, beaten cab-horses of Paris! Hope? All
I could hope was that she might never know, and I be left with
some little shred of dignity in her eyes!</p>

<p>Who cannot see that it was for my friend to fear? At times, with
him, it was despair, but of that brave kind one loves to see&mdash;never
a quiver of the lip, no winking of the eyes to keep tears back.
And I, although of a people who express everything in every way,
I understood what passed within him and found time to sorrow for
him.</p>

<p>Most of all, I sorrowed for him as we waited for her on the terrace
of the Bertolini, that perch on the cliff so high that even the
noises of the town are dulled and mingle with the sound of the
thick surf far below.</p>

<p>Across the city, and beyond, we saw, from the terrace, the old
mountain of the warm heart, smoking amiably, and the lights of
Torre del Greco at its feet, and there, across the bay, I beheld,
as I had nightly so long ago, the lamps of Castellamare, of Sorrento;
then, after a stretch of water, a twinkling which was Capri. How
good it was to know that all these had not taken advantage of
my long absence to run away and vanish, as I had half feared they
would. Those who have lived here love them well; and it was a
happy thought that the beautiful lady knew them now, and shared
them. I had never known quite all their loveliness until I felt
that she knew it too. This was something that I must never tell
her&mdash;yet what happiness there was in it!</p>

<p>I stood close to the railing, with a rambling gaze over this
enchanted earth and sea and sky, while my friend walked nervously
up and down behind me. We had come to Naples in the late afternoon,
and had found a note from Mrs. Landry at our hotel, asking us
for dinner. Poor Jr. had not spoken more than twice since he had
read me this kind invitation, but now I heard a low exclamation
from him, which let me know who was approaching; and that foolish
trembling got hold of me again as I turned.</p>

<p>Mrs. Landry came first, with outstretched hand, making some talk
excusing delay; and, after a few paces, followed the loveliest
of all the world. Beside her, in silhouette against the white
window lights of the hotel, I saw the very long, thin figure of
a man, which, even before I recognized it, carried a certain ominousness
to my mind.</p>

<p>Mrs. Landry, in spite of her florid contentedness, had sometimes
a fluttering appearance of trivial agitations.</p>

<p>"The Prince came down from Rome this morning," she said nervously,
and I saw my friend throw back his head like a man who declines
the eye-bandage when they are going to shoot him. "He is dining
with us. I know you will be glad to meet him."</p>

<p>The beautiful lady took Poor Jr.'s hand, more than he hers, for
he seemed dazed, in spite of the straight way he stood, and it
was easy to behold how white his face was. She made the presentation
of us both at the same time, and as the other man came into the
light, my mouth dropped open with wonder at the singular chances
which the littleness of our world brings about.</p>

<p>"Prince Caravacioli, Mr. Poor. And this is Signor Ansolini."</p>

<p>It was my half-brother, that old Antonio!</p>
