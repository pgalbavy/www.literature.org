<p>When it was almost dark Grandaddy Beaver swam across the pond to the big
rock, where Ferdinand Frog had told him to come.
</p>
<p>And trooping after Daddy was almost everybody in the village. Not
counting the women and children, there were eleven of them. They climbed
upon the rock, looking for Mr. Frog. But he was nowhere in sight.
</p><p>"He'll be here in a minute or two, probably," Grandaddy Beaver said
hopefully, for all he looked a bit anxious.
</p><p>Then somebody spied a neat building near-by, which not one of them had
noticed before.
</p><p>"What's this strange house?" people asked one another. "Is this where
Mr. Frog lives?"
</p><p>But nobody seemed to know the answer to that question.
</p><p>"It can't be a shop," Grandaddy decided, "for there's no sign on it. And
nobody would have a shop without a sign."
</p><p>Now, the door of the little building was shut and fastened. And the
window-shades were pulled carefully down. It certainly looked as if
nobody was at home.
</p><p>But suddenly there came a sound that made the Beaver family jump. It
came from the house--there was no doubt of that.
</p><p>In fact it came right through the keyhole; and it was like nothing in
the world but a sneeze.
</p><p>A number of people were all ready to jump into the water and swim away,
they were so startled.
</p><p>And then a snicker followed the sneeze. And by that time Grandaddy
Beaver and his friends guessed who was inside the building. It was
Ferdinand Frog; and he had been watching his callers all the time,
through the keyhole, and listening to everything that they said.
</p><p>A few felt slightly uneasy, as they tried to remember exactly what
remarks they had made about Mr. Frog himself.
</p><p>"Come out!" they all cried, as soon as they had recovered from their
surprise. "We want to see you!" And they formed a half-circle in the
dooryard.
</p><p>Presently the door swung out, as if somebody had pushed it open. And
there, on the <u>inside</u> of the open door, which was flung back against
the outside of the building, they all saw a sign, which said:
</p><pre>
         MR. FERDINAND FROG
        UNFASHIONABLE TAILOR
          ALL THE STYLES
         FIVE YEARS AHEAD
          OF THE TIMES</pre>
<p>People began exclaiming that that was just like Ferdinand Frog--who was
an odd fellow--to have his sign painted on the inside of his door
instead of on the outside.
</p><p>"It'll be all the style five years from now," he retorted.
</p><p>So that was Mr. Frog's secret! He was a tailor himself! And there he
was, ready to make clothes for all of them!
</p><p>It was almost too good to be true. But there he stood in the doorway,
with a tape around his neck, smiling and bowing.
</p><p>"You'd better form in line!" he suggested. "You can come in through the
front door. I'll measure you. And you can pass out the back way. . . .
Don't crowd, please!"
</p><p>Now, that was just where Mr. Frog made a great blunder. But he didn't
find it out till it was too late.
