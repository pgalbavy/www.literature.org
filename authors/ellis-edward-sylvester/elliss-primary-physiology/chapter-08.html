<p>Every boy and girl should learn to swim. Instances are likely
to arise, where a knowledge of the art will not only enable you
to save your own life, but that of some dear friend.</p>

<p>[Illustration]</p>

<p>When ready to take your first lesson in swimming, plunge into
the water until the head and body are cooled. Then, standing where
the water reaches your waist, lie down gently on your face, head
erect as if walking, with the mouth just above the surface. Lift
your feet from the bottom and strike them out in imitation of
a frog. At the same instant or a second later, throw your arms,
palms outward, from the front of your breast, drawing them in
and striking out as before.</p>

<p>You will fail a good many times before you learn to swim, but
do not give up. You will perhaps swallow some water, and in spite
of all you can do, your head will drop more than once under the
surface; but, if you will keep trying, you will soon find yourself
able to make two, three or more strokes, before you sink. A little
practice will complete your mastery of the art.</p>

<p>[Illustration]</p>

<p>It is well to use helps at the beginning. A friend may hold up
your chin, or a light float may be fastened behind your shoulders.
The body of a person is very little heavier than water, and a
slight exertion, rightly directed, will keep it afloat for hours.</p>

<em>FLOATING</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>The most important step, after learning to swim, is to learn
how to float. A skillful swimmer may find himself overtaken by
cramp while in deep water. He can turn upon his back and float
until he recovers or help reaches him. In case of shipwreck, or
where a person is forced to stay a long time in water, he can
rest by floating.</p>

<p>Taking your position in water, no higher than your breast nor
shallower than your waist, you lie very gently on your back, with
your chest elevated, your hands on your stomach and your feet
extended in a straight line, close to the surface. If you wish
to swim on your back, you have only to draw up your legs and strike
out as when swimming in the natural position. It is a poor method,
however, as you cannot see in what direction you are going, and
will soon exhaust your strength.</p>

<p>After learning to swim, there are many fanciful movements which
can be easily learned. They have no special value, but afford
amusement to those who look on or engage in them.</p>

<p>You cannot be too careful while learning to swim. Boys are apt
to be venturesome and think their parents are too timid on their
account. You should make it a rule never to go into water beyond
your depth until you can swim very well. If this rule should be
followed the number of deaths from drowning would be greatly lessened.</p>
