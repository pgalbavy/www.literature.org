<p><em>AFTER </em>the concert the party went out of the hall, and
passed on to a striking mansion in which a sumptuous repast was
served. M. Mifroid had by this time become quite intimate with
the Lady de Montfort. He confessed that he was unable to withstand
the allurements of the lady. It must not be forgotten that the
darkness was most conducive to the failure of all his honorable
intentions. However, we will not dilate upon what happened, but
Mme. de Montfort weakened him with her caresses and M. Mifroid
at last succumbed to the temptation. After a while she slept,
and he opened the door and went out.</p>

<p>Although they had been among the Talfa several hours, neither
M. Mifroid nor Théophraste had had the inclination to see what
kind of habitation they were in. Weakness and the great crowd
of Talfa had prevented them.</p>

<p>M. Théophraste had conducted himself in such a manner during
the meal, eating everything to excess, that he had had to be carried
out. It was done according to the directions of Mme. de Coucy,
who, it is feared, would not at that time have carried on her
love intrigues.</p>

<p>Now M. Mifroid found himself alone, and he decided to investigate.
As he went out of the room, he realized that he was in a subterranean
city.</p>

<p>That which struck him most was the total absence of doors. All
the shops were open to the passers-by, and the most precious articles
as well as the poorest were exposed for any one to take who wished.</p>

<p>He was very much amused by the profusion of the columns, by the
incredible carving in the friezes, by the reliefs and sculptured
caps to the pillars. They were so extravagantly flowered, with
the lines so intricate, that only a master hand could have worked
them. A curious point about all this work was that it only reached
as high as a man could touch. Above that point the design mixed
in with the vaulting of the catacombs and was left to the imagination.
But whatever was seen of this beautiful carving could only be
compared with the marvels worked by the early sculptors of India
or the ivory-carvers of Burma.</p>

<p>In the search M. Mifroid did not come upon any large building.
He had frequently heard Mademoiselle say: "Ah, St. Mary!" And
so he tried to find some temple in order to find out what their
religion was. His search, however, was in vain. The only building
of any size was the concert hall where they had been earlier.
It was certainly more wonderful than all the rest, but except
for this one example all the architectural marvels were applied
to the private buildings. The meanest aperture, the poorest door,
were little gems of art. There were no statues in the squares.</p>

<p>M. Mifroid was just starting back to his lady’s house, when he
met a party of young Talfa, armed with cross-bows. "Ah!" thought
he, "here are the guards." He was, however, quickly undeceived,
for they had smelled the odor from his lamp, and they came up
to him. They told him they were going for a hunt. The hunting
season started every year on the rising of the waters of the great
lake. At this time there were always a lot of rats, which were
killed in thousands and used for many different things in the
Talfa households.</p>

<p>Thanks to the directions they had given him, he soon found his
way back to Lady de Montfort’s house. There he found her waiting
at the window, and as soon as he got near her, she waved her handkerchief.</p>

<p>They were soon in conversation again, and he found out that she
was not married.</p>

<p>She asked him what he did on the top of the earth, and he told
her he was a commissioner of police. She listened intently, and
asked what Théophraste did.</p>

<p>"He is a robber," said M. Mifroid.</p>

<p>Evidently neither a commissioner of police nor a robber was known
among the Talfa, and soon the news spread that the two strangers
had unknown trades, and a great crowd gathered, who begged them
to show them what they did on earth.</p>

<p>M. Mifroid sent to fetch Théophraste.</p>
