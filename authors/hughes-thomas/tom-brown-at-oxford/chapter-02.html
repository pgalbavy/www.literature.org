<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Within a day or two of the penning of this celebrated epistle,
which created quite a sensation in the sixth-form room as it went
the round after tea, Tom realized one of the objects of his young
Oxford ambition, and succeeded in embarking on the river in a
skiff by himself, with such results as are now described. He had
already been down several times in pair-oar and four-oar boats,
with an old oar to pull stroke, and another to steer and coach
the young idea, but he was not satisfied with these essays. He
could not believe that he was such a bad oar as the old hands'
made him out to be, and thought that it must be the fault of the
other freshmen who were learning with him that the boat made so
little way and rolled so much. He had been such a proficient in
all the Rugby games, that he couldn't realize the fact of his
unreadiness in a boat. Pulling looked a simple thing enough&mdash;much
easier than tennis; and he had made a capital start at the latter
game, and been highly complimented by the marker after his first
hour in the little court. He forgot that cricket and fives are
capital training for tennis, but that rowing is a speciality,
of the rudiments of which he was wholly ignorant. And so, in full
confidence that, if he could only have a turn or two alone, he
should not only satisfy himself, but everybody else, that he was
a heaven-born oar, he refused all offers of companionship, and
started on the afternoon of a fine February day down to the boats
for his trial trip. He had watched his regular companions well
out of college, and gave them enough start to make sure that they
would be off before he himself could arrive at St. Ambrose's dressing
room at Hall's, and chuckled, as he came within sight of the river,
to see the freshmen's boat in which he generally performed, go
plunging away past the University barge, keeping three different
times with four oars, and otherwise demeaning itself so as to
become an object of mirthful admiration to all beholders.</p>

<p>Tom was punted across to Hall's in a state of great content,
which increased when, in answer to his casual inquiry, the managing
man informed him that not a man of his college was about the place.
So he ordered a skiff with as much dignity and coolness as he
could command, and hastened up stairs to dress. He appeared again,
carrying his boating coat and cap. They were quite new, so he
would not wear them; nothing about him should betray the freshman
on this day if he could help it.</p>

<p>"Is my skiff ready?"</p>

<p>"All right, sir; this way, sir;" said the manager, conducting
him to a good, safe-looking craft. "Any gentleman going to steer,
sir?"</p>

<p>"No" said Tom, superciliously; "You may take out the rudder."</p>

<p>"Going quite alone, sir? Better take one of our boys&mdash;find you
a very light one. Here, Bill!"&mdash;and he turned to summons a juvenile
waterman to take charge of our hero.</p>

<p>"Take out the rudder, do you hear?" interrupted Tom. "I won't
have a steerer."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, as you please," said the manager, proceeding to remove
the degrading appendage. "The river's rather high, please to remember,
sir. You must mind the mill stream at Iffley Lock. I suppose you
can swim?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," said Tom, settling himself on his cushion.
"Now, shove her off."</p>

<p>The next moment he was well out in the stream, and left to his
own resources. He got his sculls out successfully enough, and,
though feeling by no means easy on his seat, proceeded to pull
very deliberately past the barges, stopping his sculls in the
air to feather accurately, in the hopes of deceiving spectators
into the belief that he was an old hand just going out for a gentle
paddle. The manager watched him for a minute, and turned to his
work with an aspiration that he might not come to grief.</p>

<p>But no thought of grief was on Tom's mind as he dropped gently
down, impatient for the time when he should pass the mouth of
the Cherwell, and so, having no longer critical eyes to fear,
might put out his whole strength, and give himself at least if
not the world, assurance of a waterman.</p>

<p>The day was a very fine one, a bright sun shining, and a nice
fresh breeze blowing across the stream, but not enough to ruffle
the water seriously. Some heavy storms up Gloucestershire way
had cleared the air, and swollen the stream at the same time;
in fact, the river was as full as it could be without overflowing
its banks&mdash;a state in which, of all others, it is the least safe
for boating experiments. Fortunately, in those days there were
no outriggers. Even the racing skiffs were comparatively safe
craft, and would now be characterized as tubs; while the real
tubs (in one of the safest of which the prudent manager had embarked
our hero) were of such build that it required considerable ingenuity
actually to upset them.</p>

<p>If any ordinary amount of bungling could have done it, Tom's
voyage would have terminated within a hundred yards of the Cherwell.
While he had been sitting quiet and merely paddling, and almost
letting the stream carry him down, the boat had trimmed well enough;
but now, taking a long breath, he leaned forward, and dug his
sculls into the water, pulling them through with all his strength.
The consequence of this feat was that the handles of the sculls
came into violent collision in the middle of the boat, the knuckles
of his right hand were barked, his left scull unshipped, and the
head of his skiff almost blown round by the wind before he could
restore order on board.</p>

<p>"Never mind; try again," thought he, after the first sensation
of disgust had passed off, and a glance at the shore showed him
that there were no witnesses. "Of course, I forgot one hand must
go over the other. It might have happened to anyone. Let me see,
which hand shall I keep uppermost; the left, that's the weakest."
And away he went again, keeping his newly-acquired fact painfully
in mind, and so avoiding further collision amidships for four
or five strokes. But, as in other sciences, the giving of undue
prominence to one fact brings others inexorably on the head of
the student to avenge his neglect of them, so it happened with
Tom in his practical study of the science of rowing that by thinking
of his hands he forgot his seat, and the necessity of trimming
properly. Whereupon the old tub began to rock fearfully, and the
next moment, he missed the water altogether with his right scull,
and subsided backwards, not without struggles, into the bottom
of the boat; while the half stroke which he had pulled with his
left hand sent her head well into the bank.</p>

<p>Tom picked himself up, and settled himself on his bench again,
a sadder and wiser man, as the truth began to dawn upon him that
pulling, especially sculling, does not, like reading and writing,
come by nature. However, he addressed himself manfully to his
task; savage indeed, and longing to drive a hole in the bottom
of the old tub, but as resolved as ever to get to Sandford and
back before hall time, or perish in the attempt.</p>

<p>He shoved himself off the bank, and warned by his last mishap,
got out into mid stream, and there, moderating his ardor, and
contenting himself with a slow and steady stroke, was progressing
satisfactorily, and beginning to recover his temper, when a loud
shout startled him; and, looking over his shoulder at the imminent
risk of an upset, he beheld the fast sailor the Dart, close hauled
on a wind, and almost aboard of him. Utterly ignorant of what
was the right thing to do, he held on his course, and passed close
under the bows of the miniature cutter, the steersman having jammed
his helm hard down, shaking her in the wind, to prevent running
over the skiff, and solacing himself with pouring maledictions
on Tom and his craft, in which the man who had hold of the sheets,
and the third, who was lounging in the bows, heartily joined.
Tom was out of ear-shot before he had collected vituperation enough
to hurl back at them, and was, moreover, already in the difficult
navigation of the Gut, where, notwithstanding all his efforts,
he again ran aground; but, with this exception, he arrived without
other mishap at Iffley, where he lay on his sculls with much satisfaction,
and shouted, "Lock&mdash;lock!"</p>

<p>The lock-keeper appeared to the summons, but instead of opening
the gates seized a long boat-hook, and rushed towards our hero,
calling upon him to mind the mill-stream, and pull his right-hand
scull; notwithstanding which warning, Tom was within an ace of
drifting past the entrance to the lock, in which case assuredly
his boat, if not he, had never returned whole. However, the lock-keeper
managed to catch the stern of his skiff with the boat-hook, and
drag him back into the proper channel, and then opened the lock-gates
for him. Tom congratulated himself as he entered the lock that
there were no other boats going through with him; but his evil
star was in the ascendant, and all things, animate and inanimate,
seemed to be leagued together to humiliate him. As the water began
to fall rapidly, he lost his hold of the chain and the tub instantly
drifted across the lock, and was in imminent danger of sticking
and breaking her back, when the lock-keeper again came to the
rescue with his boat-hook and, guessing the state of the case,
did not quit him until he had safely shoved him and his boat well
out into the pool below, with an exhortation to mind and go outside
of the barge which was coming up.</p>

<p>Tom started on the latter half of his outward voyage with the
sort of look which Cato must have worn when he elected the losing
side, and all the gods went over to the winning one. But his previous
struggles had not been thrown away, and he managed to keep the
right side of the barge, turn the corner without going around,
and zigzag down Kennington reach, slowly indeed, but with much
labor, but at any rate safely. Rejoicing in his feat, he stopped
at the island, and recreated himself with a glass of beer, looking
now hopefully towards Sandford, which lay within easy distance,
now upwards again along the reach which he had just overcome,
and solacing himself with the remembrance of a dictum, which he
had heard from a great authority, that it was always easier to
steer up stream than down, from which he argued that the worst
part of his trial trip was now over.</p>

<p>Presently he saw a skiff turn the corner at the top of the Kennington
reach, and, resolving in his mind to get to Sandford before the
new comer, paid for his beer, and betook himself again to his
tub. He got pretty well off, and, the island shutting out his
unconscious rival from his view, worked away at first under the
pleasing delusion that he was holding his own. But he was soon
undeceived, for in monstrously short time the pursuing skiff showed
around the corner and bore down on him. He never relaxed his efforts,
but could not help watching the enemy as he came up with him hand
over hand, and envying the perfect ease with which he seemed to
be pulling his long steady stroke and the precision with which
he steered, scarcely ever casting a look over his shoulder. He
was hugging the Berkshire side himself, as the other skiff passed
him, and thought he heard the sculler say something about keeping
out, and minding the small lasher; but the noise of the waters
and his own desperate efforts prevented his heeding, or, indeed,
hearing the warning plainly. In another minute, however, he heard
plainly enough most energetic shouts behind him and, turning his
head over his right shoulder, saw the man who had just passed
him backing his skiff rapidly up stream towards him. The next
moment he felt the bows of his boat whirl round, the old tub grounded
for a moment, and then, turning over on her side, shot him out
on to the planking of the steep descent into the small lasher.
He grasped at the boards, but they were too slippery to hold,
and the rush of water was too strong for him, and rolling him
over and over like a piece of driftwood, plunged him into the
pool below.</p>

<p>After the first moment of astonishment and fright was over, Tom
left himself to the stream, holding his breath hard, and paddling
gently with his hands, feeling sure that, if he could only hold
on, he should come to the surface sooner or later; which accordingly
happened after a somewhat lengthy submersion.</p>

<p>His first impulse on rising to the surface, after catching his
breath, was to strike out for the shore, but, in the act of doing
so, he caught sight of the other skiff coming stern foremost down
the decent after him, and he trod the water and drew in his breath
to watch. Down she came, as straight as an arrow, into the tumult
below; the sculler sitting upright, and holding his sculls steadily
in the water. For a moment she seemed to be going under, but righted
herself, and glided swiftly into the still water; and then the
sculler cast a hasty and anxious glance around, till his eyes
rested on our hero's half-drowned head.</p>

<p>"Oh, there you are!" he said, looking much relieved; "all right,
I hope. Not hurt, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, thankee; all right, I believe," answered Tom. "What shall
I do?"</p>

<p>"Swim ashore; I'll look after your boat." So Tom took the advice,
swam ashore, and there stood dripping and watching the other as
he righted the old tub which was floating quietly bottom upwards,
little the worse for the mishap, and no doubt, if boats can wish,
earnestly desiring in her wooden mind to be allowed to go quietly
to pieces then and there, sooner to be rescued than be again entrusted
to the guidance of freshmen.</p>

<p>The tub having been brought to the bank, the stranger started
again, and collected the sculls and bottom boards which were floating
about here and there in the pool, and also succeeded in making
salvage of Tom's coat, the pockets of which held his watch, purse,
and cigar case. These he brought to the bank, and delivering them
over, inquired whether there was anything else to look after.</p>

<p>"Thank you, no; nothing but my cap. Never mind it. It's luck
enough not to have lost the coat," said Tom, holding up the dripping
garment to let the water run out of the arms and pocket-holes,
and then wringing it as well as he could. "At any rate," thought
he, "I needn't be afraid of its looking too new any more."</p>

<p>The stranger put off again, and made one more round, searching
for the cap and anything else which he might have overlooked,
but without success. While he was doing so, Tom had time to look
him well over, and see what sort of a man had come to his rescue.
He hardly knew at the time the full extent of his obligation&mdash;at
least if this sort of obligation is to be reckoned not so much
by the service actually rendered, as by the risk encountered to
be able to render it. There were probably not three men in the
University who would have dared to shoot the lasher in a skiff
in its then state, for it was in those times a really dangerous
place; and Tom himself had an extraordinary escape, for, as Miller,
the St. Ambrose coxswain, remarked on hearing the story, "No one
who wasn't born to be hung could have rolled down it without knocking
his head against something hard, and going down like lead when
he got to the bottom."</p>

<p>He was very well satisfied with his inspection. The other man
was evidently a year or two older than himself, his figure was
more set, and he had stronger whiskers than are generally grown
at twenty. He was somewhere about five feet ten in height, very
deep-chested, and with long powerful arms and hands. There was
no denying, however, that at the first glance he was an ugly man;
he was marked with small-pox, had large features, high cheekbones,
deeply set eyes, and a very long chin; and had got the trick which
many underhung men have of compressing his upper lip. Nevertheless,
there was that in his face which hit Tom's fancy, and made him
anxious to know his rescuer better. He had an instinct that good
was to be gotten out of him. So he was very glad when the search
was ended, and the stranger came to the bank, shipped his sculls,
and jumped out with the painter of his skiff in his hand, which
he proceeded to fasten to an old stump, while he remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the cap's lost."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter the least. Thank you for coming to help me;
it was very kind indeed, and more than I expected. Don't they
say that one Oxford man will never save another from drowning
unless they have been introduced?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied the other; "are you sure you're not hurt?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite," said Tom, foiled in what he considered an artful
plan to get the stranger to introduce himself.</p>

<p>"Then we're very well out of it," said the other, looking at
the steep descent into the lasher, and the rolling tumbling rush
of the water below.</p>

<p>"Indeed we are," said Tom; "but how in the world did you manage
not to upset?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know myself &mdash;I had shipped a good deal of water,
you see. Perhaps I ought to have jumped out on the bank and come
across to you, leaving my skiff in the river, for if I had upset
I couldn't have helped you much. However, I followed my instinct,
which was to come the quickest way. I thought, too, that if I
could manage to get down in the boat I should be of more use.
I am very glad I did it," he added after a moment's pause; "I'm
really proud of having come down that place."</p>

<p>"So ain't I," said Tom, with a laugh, in which the other joined.</p>

<p>"But now you're getting chilled," and he turned from the lasher
and looked at Tom's chattering jaws.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's nothing. I'm used to being wet."</p>

<p>"But you may just as well be comfortable if you can. Here's this
rough Jersey which I use instead of a coat; pull off that wet
cotton affair, and put it on, and then we'll get to work, for
we have plenty to do."</p>

<p>After a little persuasion Tom did as he was bid, and got into
the great woolen garment, which was very comforting; and then
the two set about getting their skiffs back into the main stream.
This was comparatively easy as to the lighter skiff, which was
soon baled out and hauled by main force on to the bank, carried
across and launched again. The tub gave them much more trouble,
for she was quite full of water and very heavy; but after twenty
minutes or so of hard work, during which the mutual respect of
the labourers for the strength and willingness of each other was
much increased, she also lay in the main stream, leaking considerably,
but otherwise not much the worse for her adventure.</p>

<p>"Now what do you mean to do?" said the stranger. "I don't think
you can pull home in her. One doesn't know how much she may be
damaged. She may sink in the lock, or play any prank."</p>

<p>"But what am I to do with her?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you can leave her at Sandford and walk up, and send one
of Hall's boys after her. Or, if you like, I will tow her up behind
my skiff."</p>

<p>"Won't your skiff carry two?"</p>

<p>"Yes; if you like to come I'll take you, but you must sit very
quiet."</p>

<p>"Can't we go down to Sandford first and have a glass of ale?
What time is it?&mdash;the water has stopped my watch."</p>

<p>"A quarter past three. I have about twenty minutes to spare."</p>

<p>"Come along, then," said Tom; "but will you let me pull your
skiff down to Sandford? I resolved to pull to Sandford to-day,
and don't like to give it up."</p>

<p>"By all means, if you like," said the other, with a smile; "jump
in, and I'll walk along the bank."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Tom, hurrying into the skiff, in which he completed
the remaining quarter of a mile, while the owner walked by the
side, watching him.</p>

<p>They met on the bank at the little inn by Sandford lock, and
had a glass of ale, over which Tom confessed that it was the first
time he had ever navigated a skiff by himself, and gave a detailed
account of his adventures, to the great amusement of his companion.
And by the time they rose to go, it was settled, at Tom's earnest
request, that he should pull the sound skiff up, while his companion
sat in the stern and coached him. The other consented very kindly,
merely stipulating that he himself should take the sculls, if
it should prove that Tom could not pull them up in time for hall
dinner. So they started, and took the tub in tow when they came
up to it. Tom got on famously under his new tutor, who taught
him to get forward, and open his knees properly, and throw his
weight on to the sculls at the beginning of the stroke. He managed
even to get into Iffley lock on the way up without fouling the
gates, and was then and there complimented on his progress. Whereupon,
as they sat, while the lock filled, Tom poured out his thanks
to his tutor for his instruction, which had been given so judiciously
that, while he was conscious of improving at every stroke, he
did not feel that the other was asserting any superiority over
him; and so, though more humble than at the most disastrous period
of his downward voyage, he was getting into a better temper every
minute.</p>

<p>It is a great pity that some of our instructors in more important
matters than sculling will not take a leaf out of the same book.
Of course, it is more satisfactory to one's own self-love to make
everyone who comes to one to learn, feel that he is a fool, and
we wise men; but if our object is to teach well and usefully what
we know ourselves there cannot be a worse method. No man, however,
is likely to adopt it, so long as he is conscious that he has
anything himself to learn from his pupils; and as soon as he has
arrived at the conviction that they can teach him nothing&mdash;that
it is henceforth to be all give and no take&mdash;the sooner he throws
up his office of teacher, the better it will be for himself, his
pupils, and his country, whose sons he is misguiding.</p>

<p>On their way up, so intent were they on their own work that it
was not until shouts of "Hello, Brown! how did you get there?
Why, you said you were not going down today," greeted them just
above the Gut, that they were aware of the presence of the freshmen's
four-oar of St. Ambrose College, which had with some trouble succeeded
in overtaking them.</p>

<p>"I said I wasn't going down with <em>you</em>," shouted Tom,
grinding away harder than ever, that they might witness and wonder
at his prowess.</p>

<p>"Oh, I dare say! Whose skiff are you towing up? I believe you've
been upset."</p>

<p>Tom made no reply, and the four-oar floundered on ahead.</p>

<p>"Are you at St. Ambrose's?" asked his sitter, after a minute.</p>

<p>"Yes; that's my treadmill, that four-oar. I've been down in it
almost every day since I came up, and very poor fun it is. So
I thought to-day I would go on my own hook, and see if I couldn't
make a better hand of it. And I have too, I know, thanks to you."</p>

<p>The other made no remark, but a little shade came over his face.
He had no chance of making out Tom's college, as the new cap which
would have betrayed him had disappeared in the lasher. He himself
wore a glazed straw hat, which was of no college; so that up to
this time neither of them had known to what college the other
belonged.</p>

<p>When they landed at Hall's, Tom was at once involved in a wrangle
with the manager as to the amount of damage done to the tub; which
the latter refused to assess before he knew what had happened
to it; while our hero vigorously and with reason maintained, that
if he knew his business it could not matter what had happened
to the boat. There she was, and he must say whether she was better
or worse, or how much worse than when she started. In the middle
of which dialogue his new acquaintance, touching his arm, said,
"You can leave my jersey with your own things; I shall get it
to-morrow," and then disappeared.</p>

<p>Tom, when he had come to terms with his adversary, ran upstairs,
expecting to find the other, and meaning to tell his name, and
find out who it was that had played the good Samaritan by him.
He was much annoyed when he found the coast clear, and dressed
in a grumbling humour. "I wonder why he should have gone off so
quick. He might just as well have stayed and walked up with me,"
thought he. "Let me see, though; didn't he say I was to leave
his Jersey in our room, with my own things? Why, perhaps he is
a St. Ambrose man himself. But then he would have told me so,
surely. I don't remember to have seen his face in chapel or hall;
but then there is such a lot of new faces, and he may not sit
near me. However I mean to find him out before long, whoever he
may be." With which resolve Tom crossed in the punt into Christ's
Church meadow, and strolled college-wards, feeling that he had
had a good hard afternoon's exercise, and was much the better
for it. He might have satisfied his curiosity at once by simply
asking the manager who it was that had arrived with him; and this
occurred to him before he got home, whereat he felt satisfied,
but would not go back then, as it was so near hall time. He would
be sure to remember it the first thing tomorrow.</p>

<p>As it happened, however, he had not so long to wait for the information
which he needed; for scarcely had he sat down in hall and ordered
his dinner, when he caught sight of his boating acquaintance,
who walked in habited in a gown which Tom took for a scholar's.
He took his seat at a little table in the middle of the hall,
near the bachelors' table, but quite away from the rest of the
undergraduates, at which sat four or five other men in similar
gowns. He either did not or would not notice the looks of recognition
which Tom kept firing at him until he had taken his seat.</p>

<p>"Who is that man that has just come in, do you know?" said Tom
to his next neighbour, a second term man.</p>

<p>"Which?" said the other, looking up.</p>

<p>"That one over at the little table in the middle of the hall,
with the dark whiskers. There, he has just turned rather from
us, and put his arm on the table."</p>

<p>"Oh, his name is Hardy."</p>

<p>"Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"No; I don't think anybody does. They say he is a clever fellow,
but a very queer one."</p>

<p>"Why does he sit at that table!"</p>

<p>"He is one of our servitors; they all sit there together."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Tom, not much wiser for the information, but resolved
to waylay Hardy as soon as the hall was over, and highly delighted
to find that they were after all of the same college; for he had
already begun to find out, that however friendly you may be with
out-college men, you must live chiefly with those of your own.
But now his scout brought his dinner, and he fell to with the
appetite of a freshman on his ample commons.</p>
