<p>During the days that followed I had several opportunities to
question him as to his reason for his voyage to America, but I
obtained no more precise answers than he had given me on the evening
of the adjournment of the trial, when we were on the train for
Paris. One day, however, on my still pressing him, he said:</p>

<p>"Can’t you understand that I had to know Larsan’s true personality?"</p>

<p>"No doubt," I said, "but why did you go to America to find that
out?"</p>

<p>He sat smoking his pipe, and made no further reply. I began to
see that I was touching on the secret that concerned Mademoiselle
Stangerson. Rouletabille evidently had found it necessary to go
to America to find out what the mysterious tie was that bound
her to Larsan by so strange and terrible a bond. In America he
had learned who Larsan was and had obtained information which
closed his mouth. He had been to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>And now, what was this mystery which held Mademoiselle Stangerson
and Monsieur Robert Darzac in so inexplicable a silence? After
so many years and the publicity given the case by a curious and
shameless press; now that Monsieur Stangerson knows all and has
forgiven all, all may be told. In every phase of this remarkable
story Mademoiselle Stangerson had always been the sufferer.</p>

<p>The beginning dates from the time when, as a young girl, she
was living with her father in Philadelphia. A visitor at the house,
a Frenchman, had succeeded by his wit, grace and persistent attention,
in gaining her affections. He was said to be rich and had asked
her of her father. Monsieur Stangerson, on making inquiries as
to Monsieur Jean Roussel, found that the man was a swindler and
an adventurer. Jean Roussel was but another of the many names
under which the notorious Ballmeyer, a fugitive from France, tried
to hide himself. Monsieur Stangerson did not know of his identity
with Ballmeyer; he learned that the man was simply undesirable
for his daughter. He not only refused to give his consent to the
marriage but denied him admission into the house. Mathilde Stangerson,
however, had fallen in love. To her Jean Roussel was everything
that her love painted him. She was indignant at her father’s attitude,
and did not conceal her feelings. Her father sent her to stay
with an aunt in Cincinnati. There she was joined by Jean Roussel
and, in spite of the reverence she felt for her father, ran away
with him to get married.</p>

<p>They went to Louisville and lived there for some time. One morning,
however, a knock came at the door of the house in which they were
and the police entered to arrest Jean Roussel. It was then that
Mathilde Stangerson, or Roussel, learned that her husband was
no other than the notorious Ballmeyer!</p>

<p>The young woman in her despair tried to commit suicide. She failed
in this, and was forced to rejoin her aunt in Cincinnati, The
old lady was overjoyed to see her again. She had been anxiously
searching for her and had not dared to tell Monsieur Stangerson
of her disappearance. Mathilde swore her to secrecy, so that her
father should not know she had been away. A month later, Mademoiselle
Stangerson returned to her father, repentant, her heart dead within
her, hoping only one thing: that she would never again see her
husband, the horrible Ballmeyer. A report was spread, a few weeks
later, that he was dead, and she now determined to atone for her
disobedience by a life of labour and devotion for her father.
And she kept her word.</p>

<p>All this she had confessed to Robert Darzac, and, believing Ballmeyer
dead, had given herself to the joy of a union with him. But fate
had resuscitated Jean Roussel&mdash;the Ballmeyer of her youth. He
had taken steps to let her know that he would never allow her
to marry Darzac&mdash;that he still loved her.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Stangerson never for one moment hesitated to confide
in Monsieur Darzac. She showed him the letter in which Jean Roussel
asked her to recall the first hours of their union in their beautiful
and charming Louisville home. "The presbytery has lost nothing
of its charm, nor the garden its brightness," he had written.
The scoundrel pretended to be rich and claimed the right of taking
her back to Louisville. She had told Darzac that if her father
should know of her dishonour, she would kill herself. Monsieur
Darzac had sworn to silence her persecutor, even if he had to
kill him. He was outwitted and would have succumbed had it not
been for the genius of Rouletabille.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Stangerson was herself helpless in the hands of
such a villain. She had tried to kill him when he had first threatened
and then attacked her in "The Yellow Room". She had, unfortunately,
failed, and felt herself condemned to be for ever at the mercy
of this unscrupulous wretch who was continually demanding her
presence at clandestine interviews. When he sent her the letter
through the Post Office, asking her to meet him, she had refused.
The result of her refusal was the tragedy of "The Yellow Room".
The second time he wrote asking for a meeting, the letter reaching
her in her sick chamber, she had avoided him by sleeping with
her servants. In that letter the scoundrel had warned her that,
since she was too ill to come to him, he would come to her, and
that he would be in her chamber at a particular hour on a particular
night. Knowing that she had everything to fear from Ballmeyer,
she had left her chamber on that night. It was then that the incident
of the "inexplicable gallery" occurred.</p>

<p>The third time she had determined to keep the appointment. He
asked for it in the letter he had written in her own room, on
the night of the incident in the gallery, which he left on her
desk. In that letter he threatened to burn her father’s papers
if she did not meet him. It was to rescue these papers that she
made up her mind to see him. She did not for one moment doubt
that the wretch would carry out his threat if she persisted in
avoiding him, and in that case the labours of her father’s lifetime
would be for ever lost. Since the meeting was thus inevitable,
she resolved to see her husband and appeal to his better nature.
It was for this interview that she had prepared herself on the
night the keeper was killed. They did meet, and what passed between
them may be imagined. He insisted that she renounce Darzac. She,
on her part, affirmed her love for him. He stabbed her in his
anger, determined to convict Darzac of the crime. As Larsan he
could do it, and had so managed things that Darzac could never
explain how he had employeeed the time of his absence from the
chateau. Ballmeyer’s precautions were most cunningly taken.</p>

<p>Larsan had threatened Darzac as he had threatened Mathilde&mdash;with
the same weapon, and the same threats. He wrote Darzac urgent
letters, declaring himself ready to deliver up the letters that
had passed between him and his wife, and to leave them for ever,
if he would pay him his price. He asked Darzac to meet him for
the purpose of arranging the matter, appointing the time when
Larsan would be with Mademoiselle Stangerson. When Darzac went
to Epinay, expecting to find Ballmeyer or Larsan there, he was
met by an accomplice of Larsan’s, and kept waiting until such
time as the "coincidence" could be established.</p>

<p>It was all done with Machiavellian cunning; but Ballmeyer had
reckoned without Joseph Rouletabille.</p>

<p>Now that the Mystery of "The Yellow Room" has been cleared up,
this is not the time to tell of Rouletabille’s adventures in America.
Knowing the young reporter as we do, we can understand with what
acumen he had traced, step by step, the story of Mathilde Stangerson
and Jean Roussel. At Philadelphia he had quickly informed himself
as to Arthur William Rance. There he learned of Rance’s act of
devotion and the reward he thought himself entitled to for it.
A rumour of his marriage with Mademoiselle Stangerson had once
found its way into the drawing-rooms of Philadelphia. He also
learned of Rance’s continued attentions to her and his importunities
for her hand. He had taken to drink, he had said, to drown his
grief at his unrequited love. It can now be understood why Rouletabille
had shown so marked a coolness of demeanour towards Rance when
they met in the witnesses’ room, on the day of the trial.</p>

<p>The strange Roussel-Stangerson mystery had now been laid bare.
Who was this Jean Roussel? Rouletabille had traced him from Philadelphia
to Cincinnati. In Cincinnati he became acquainted with the old
aunt, and had found means to open her mouth. The story of Ballmeyer’s
arrest threw the right light on the whole story. He visited the
"presbytery"&mdash;a small and pretty dwelling in the old colonial
style&mdash;which had, indeed, "lost nothing of its charm." Then, abandoning
his pursuit of traces of Mademoiselle Stangerson, he took up those
of Ballmeyer. He followed them from prison to prison, from crime
to crime. Finally, as he was about leaving for Europe, he learned
in New York that Ballmeyer had, five years before, embarked for
France with some valuable papers belonging to a merchant of New
Orleans whom he had murdered.</p>

<p>And yet the whole of this mystery has not been revealed. Mademoiselle
Stangerson had a child, by her husband,&mdash;a son. The infant was
born in the old aunt’s house. No one knew of it, so well had the
aunt managed to conceal the event.</p>

<p>What became of that son? &mdash;That is another story which,
so far, I am not permitted to relate.</p>

<p>About two months after these events, I came upon Rouletabille
sitting on a bench in the Palais de Justice, looking very depressed.</p>

<p>"What’s the matter, old man?" I asked. "You are looking very
downcast. How are your friends getting on?"</p>

<p>"Apart from you," he said, "I have no friends."</p>

<p>"I hope that Monsieur Darzac&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No doubt."</p>

<p>"And Mademoiselle Stangerson &mdash;How is she?"</p>

<p>"Better&mdash;much better."</p>

<p>"Then you ought not to be sad."</p>

<p>"I am sad," he said, "because I am thinking of the perfume of
the lady in black&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The perfume of the lady in black! &mdash;I have heard you often
refer to it. Tell me why it troubles you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;some day; some day," said Rouletabille.</p>

<p>And he heaved a profound sigh.</p>
