<p>As soon as Worrell found himself on the outside of the cavern,
he walked rapidly for a hundred yards or so, taking a direction
at right angles to that which he followed when conducting the
fugitives to the retreat. His gait became almost a run until he
reached an elevation, when he paused, as if to make a survey of
a portion of the country spread out below him.</p>

<p>"The sun is almost overhead," he muttered, as he looked up to
the sky with an impatient expression, "and I am all of an hour
behind time, but this is one of them things that can't be fixed
just as you want it, and I don't see why it should make any difference."</p>

<p>He was gazing at the section which lay spread out at his feet,
and was between him and the Susquehanna. His eyes first roved
in a quick, restless way over the broad stretch of woods and clearings,
as if seeking for some object upon which to rest. At the end of
a few minutes, his gaze became fixed upon a place where stood
a small house in the middle of a clearing. It evidently belonged
to one of the settlers in the Wyoming valley, who had been smitten
with the panic which drove so many from their homes, and had fled
without taking any of his stock with him, or destroying his property
to prevent it falling into the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>The manner of Worrell showed that he awaited some person or signal
in connection with this house, but he was disappointed. The tomb
itself could not have been more deserted and desolate, and he
gazed until sure there was nothing on or about it which was intended
for his eye.</p>

<p>"That's the way it always is," he muttered. "I have got everything
fixed just as I promised, and now they turn up missing at the
very time they ought to be on hand. I suppose I've got to hunt
'em up, and that may take me till dark, by which time that Mohawk
will put in his oar."</p>

<p>He spent a few more minutes searching for something which did
not appear. Then he advanced to a small tree that grew on the
edge of the open space where he had halted, and drawing a large
red handkerchief from his pocket, bent down a small sapling and
tied the silk to it. As the little tree flew back to its upright
position, there was enough breeze to make the signal rise and
float in the wind. The man stood off a few paces, and watched
it.</p>

<p>"I can't improve on that," he said to himself. "If they will
only look this way, they can't help seeing it, and it will tell
the story; but the trouble is, there is no knowing when they will
take the trouble to look this way. Faugh! why didn't they leave
the whole thing to me? It would have been ended by this time,
and there would have been no after-clap, but this waiting and
bother is what will upset the whole arrangement unless they come
up to time better than they are likely to do."</p>

<p>Impatient as he was, he was obliged to content himself, while
he kept an unremitting watch on the house and its surroundings,
occasionally giving vent to his feelings by a series of expletives.
In fact, Worrell, who now showed himself to himself, as it may
be said, was altogether a less prepossessing character than the
one who had so kindly conducted the fugitives to the hiding-place
in the woods, and bidden them sleep while he watched over their
slumbers. Suddenly he started. He had discerned something for
which he was waiting. Moving to the edge of the open space, he
gazed with the keenness of one whose life depended upon making
no mistake as to what he saw. The house which engaged so much
of his attention was a quarter of a mile distant. The wonder was
how he distinguished anything so far off with enough certainty
to determine its character; but he had done so.</p>

<p>"Better late than never," he muttered; "though it looked awhile
ago as if it was to be never. Yes," he added, a moment after,
"they are there, and it won't take them long to find out that
I am here."</p>

<p>So it proved; for, in a few minutes there was an answering signal
waving from an upper window of the house in the form of a handkerchief
of a white color, swung by the hand of a man instead of the wind,
as in the former case.</p>

<p>"I don't know as there's any use of my waiting any longer," he
growled, "for I don't s'pose they'll come to me, and I may as
well go to them, for there is no telling where that infernal Mohawk
is. I wouldn't meet him for all the Colonel Butlers that ever
breathed. He is the devil himself, and I prefer to keep out of
his path."</p>

<p>Impressed with the value of time, the man gripped the sapling
and swung it violently, so as to make the red handkerchief wave
in the breeze. Then he started down the mountain, taking a direction
which led him straight toward the house in which he had shown
so much interest from the first. All the way was down-hill, and
Worrell walked like one accustomed to the woods, making such good
time that at the end of ten minutes he was with the parties whom
he was anxious to see and meet. Who were they?</p>

<p>Six Indians, under the charge of Captain Bagley, who has already
been introduced to our readers.</p>

<p>A glance at the painted warriors showed they were Iroquois, who
were following so vigilantly the fugitives that had managed to
elude them thus far. Bagley emerged from the house and shook hands
with Worrell, the two at once entering into a hurried conversation,
while the Indians, in accordance with their nature, stood apart,
saying nothing to each other, but satisfied to wait till the time
should come for them to act in obedience to the orders of their
leader. Something was wrong, for Bagley and Worrell continued
talking a long time, each earnest and abounding with gesture.
As might be supposed, it was Lena-Wingo, the Mohawk, that had
caused the trouble. Several of the warriors had seen him in another
direction, and an encounter of some kind had taken place between
the celebrated scout and the Iroquois, with the result that Colonel
Butler had now two less men than before.</p>

<p>Captain Bagley was of the opinion that the half dozen with him
were insufficient to enter the cave and secure the fugitives sleeping
there. He wanted about as many more before making the attempt.
Worrell insisted there should be no delay. The three were in sound
slumber, and all they had to do was to enter the cavern, take
possession of their arms, and then the trio themselves. Captain
Bagley's objection to this was that because of the time that had
elapsed, they would not be found asleep when his men arrived there.</p>

<p>Furthermore, from what his informant told him, he was confident
the Mohawk would reach the cavern ahead of them, in which event
it would be vain to attack them with only six Indians and two
white men, even though these eight were among the bravest soldiers
that had entered the Wyoming valley. It was folly, in his opinion,
to try such a task without a force that would insure success from
the first. Worrell, however, was as vehement for an immediate
advance, insisting that all that was needed was promptness. A
liberal reward had been promised him, and would assuredly be his
if his plan was carried to a successful completion. At last, his
importunity prevailed when he promised to be the first one to
enter the cavern, and the start was made.</p>
