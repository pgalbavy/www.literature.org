<p>A storm of industry raged on in the house. Ursula did not go to college
till October. So, with a distinct feeling of responsibility, as if she
must express herself in this house, she laboured arranging,
re-arranging, selecting, contriving.</p>

<p>She could use her father's ordinary tools, both for woodwork and
metal-work, so she hammered and tinkered. Her mother was quite content
to have the thing done. Brangwen was interested. He had a ready belief
in his daughter. He himself was at work putting up his work-shed in the
garden.</p>

<p>At last she had finished for the time being. The drawingroom was big
and empty. It had the good Wilton carpet, of which the family was so
proud, and the large couch and large chairs covered with shiny chintz,
and the piano, a little sculpture in plaster that Brangwen had done,
and not very much more. It was too large and empty-feeling for the
family to occupy very much. Yet they liked to know it was there, large
and empty.</p>

<p>The home was the dining-room. There the hard rush floor-covering made
the ground light, reflecting light upon the bottom their hearts; in the
window-bay was a broad, sunny seat, the table was so solid one could
not jostle it, and the chairs so strong one could knock them over
without hurting them. The familiar organ that Brangwen had made stood
on one side, looking peculiarly small, the sideboard was comfortably
reduced to normal proportions. This was the family living-room.</p>

<p>Ursula had a bedroom to herself. It was really a servants' bedroom,
small and plain. Its window looked over the back garden at other back
gardens, some of them old and very nice, some of them littered with
packing-cases, then at the backs of the houses whose fronts were the
shops in High Street, or the genteel homes of the under-manager or the
chief cashier, facing the chapel.</p>

<p>She had six weeks still before going to college. In this time she
nervously read over some Latin and some botany, and fitfully worked at
some mathematics. She was going into college as a teacher, for her
training. But, having already taken her matriculation examination, she
was entered for a university course. At the end of a year she would sit
for the Intermediate Arts, then two years after for her B.A. So her
case was not that of the ordinary school-teacher. She would be working
among the private students who came only for pure education, not for
mere professional training. She would be of the elect.</p>

<p>For the next three years she would be more or less dependent on her
parents again. Her training was free. All college fees were paid by the
government, she had moreover a few pounds grant every year. This would
just pay for her train fares and her clothing. Her parents would only
have to feed her. She did not want to cost them much. They would not be
well off. Her father would earn only two hundred a year, and a good
deal of her mother's capital was spent in buying the house. Still,
there was enough to get along with.</p>

<p>Gudrun was attending the Art School at Nottingham. She was working
particularly at sculpture. She had a gift for this. She loved making
little models in clay, of children or of animals. Already some of these
had appeared in the Students' Exhibition in the Castle, and Gudrun was
a distinguished person. She was chafing at the Art School and wanted to
go to London. But there was not enough money. Neither would her parents
let her go so far.</p>

<p>Theresa had left the High School. She was a great strapping, bold
hussy, indifferent to all higher claims. She would stay at home. The
others were at school, except the youngest. When term started, they
would all be transferred to the Grammar School at Willey Green.</p>

<p>Ursula was excited at making acquaintances in Beldover. The excitement
soon passed. She had tea at the clergyman's, at the chemist's, at the
other chemist's, at the doctor's, at the under-manager's - then she knew
practically everybody. She could not take people very seriously, though
at the time she wanted to.</p>

<p>She wandered the country, on foot and on her bicycle, finding it very
beautiful in the forest direction, between Mansfield and Southwell and
Worksop. But she was here only skirmishing for amusement. Her real
exploration would begin in college.</p>

<p>Term began. She went into town each day by train. The cloistered quiet
of the college began to close around her.</p>

<p>She was not at first disappointed. The big college built of stone,
standing in the quiet street, with a rim of grass and lime trees all so
peaceful: she felt it remote, a magic land. Its architecture was
foolish, she knew from her father. Still, it was different from that of
all other buildings. Its rather pretty, plaything, Gothic form was
almost a style, in the dirty industrial town.</p>

<p>She liked the hall, with its big stone chimney-piece and its Gothic
arches supporting the balcony above. To be sure the arches were ugly,
the chimney-piece of cardboard-like carved stone, with its armorial
decoration, looked silly just opposite the bicycle stand and the
radiator, whilst the great notice-board with its fluttering papers
seemed to slam away all sense of retreat and mystery from the far wall.
Nevertheless, amorphous as it might be, there was in it a reminiscence
of the wondrous, cloistral origin of education. Her soul flew straight
back to the medieval times, when the monks of God held the learning of
men and imparted it within the shadow of religion. In this spirit she
entered college.</p>

<p>The harshness and vulgarity of the lobbies and cloak-rooms hurt her at
first. Why was it not all beautiful? But she could not openly admit her
criticism. She was on holy ground.</p>

<p>She wanted all the students to have a high, pure spirit, she wanted
them to say only the real, genuine things, she wanted their faces to be
still and luminous as the nuns' and the monks' faces.</p>

<p>Alas, the girls chattered and giggled and were nervous, they were
dressed up and frizzed, the men looked mean and clownish.</p>

<p>Still, it was lovely to pass along the corridor with one's books in
one's hands, to push the swinging, glass-panelled door, and enter the
big room where the first lecture would be given. The windows were large
and lofty, the myriad brown students' desks stood waiting, the great
blackboard was smooth behind the rostrum.</p>

<p>Ursula sat beside her window, rather far back. Looking down, she saw
the lime trees turning yellow, the tradesman's boy passing silent down
the still, autumn-sunny street. There was the world, remote, remote.</p>

<p>Here, within the great, whispering sea-shell, that whispered all the
while with reminiscence of all the centuries, time faded away, and the
echo of knowledge filled the timeless silence.</p>

<p>She listened, she scribbled her notes with joy, almost with ecstasy,
never for a moment criticising what she heard. The lecturer was a
mouth-piece, a priest. As he stood, black-gowned, on the rostrum, some
strands of the whispering confusion of knowledge that filled the whole
place seemed to be singled out and woven together by him, till they
became a lecture.</p>

<p>At first, she preserved herself from criticism. She would not consider
the professors as men, ordinary men who ate bacon, and pulled on their
boots before coming to college. They were the black-gowned priests of
knowledge, serving for ever in a remote, hushed temple. They were the
initiated, and the beginning and the end of the mystery was in their
keeping.</p>

<p>Curious joy she had of the lectures. It was a joy to hear the theory of
education, there was such freedom and pleasure in ranging over the very
stuff of knowledge, and seeing how it moved and lived and had its
being. How happy Racine made her! She did not know why. But as the big
lines of the drama unfolded themselves, so steady, so measured, she
felt a thrill as of being in the realm of the reality. Of Latin, she
was doing Livy and Horace. The curious, intimate, gossiping tone of the
Latin class suited Horace. Yet she never cared for him, nor even Livy.
There was an entire lack of sternness in the gossipy class-room. She
tried hard to keep her old grasp of the Roman spirit. But gradually the
Latin became mere gossip-stuff and artificiality to her, a question of
manners and verbosities.</p>

<p>Her terror was the mathematics class. The lecturer went so fast, her
heart beat excitedly, she seemed to be straining every nerve. And she
struggled hard, during private study, to get the stuff into control.</p>

<p>Then came the lovely, peaceful afternoons in the botany laboratory.
There were few students. How she loved to sit on her high stool before
the bench, with her pith and her razor and her material, carefully
mounting her slides, carefully bringing her microscope into focus, then
turning with joy to record her observation, drawing joyfully in her
book, if the slide were good.</p>

<p>She soon made a college friend, a girl who had lived in Florence, a
girl who wore a wonderful purple or figured scarf draped over a plain,
dark dress. She was Dorothy Russell, daughter of a south-country
advocate. Dorothy lived with a maiden aunt in Nottingham, and spent her
spare moments slaving for the Women's Social and Political Union. She
was quiet and intense, with an ivory face and dark hair looped plain
over her ears. Ursula was very fond of her, but afraid of her. She
seemed so old and so relentless towards herself. Yet she was only
twenty-two. Ursula always felt her to be a creature of fate, like
Cassandra.</p>

<p>The two girls had a close, stern friendship. Dorothy worked at all
things with the same passion, never sparing herself. She came closest
to Ursula during the botany hours. For she could not draw. Ursula made
beautiful and wonderful drawings of the sections under the microscope,
and Dorothy always came to learn the manner of the drawing.</p>

<p>So the first year went by, in magnificent seclusion and activity of
learning. It was strenuous as a battle, her college life, yet remote as
peace.</p>

<p>She came to Nottingham in the morning with Gudrun. The two sisters were
distinguished wherever they went, slim, strong girls, eager and
extremely sensitive. Gudrun was the more beautiful of the two, with her
sleepy, half-languid girlishness that looked so soft, and yet was
balanced and inalterable underneath. She wore soft, easy clothing, and
hats which fell by themselves into a careless grace.</p>

<p>Ursula was much more carefully dressed, but she was self-conscious,
always falling into depths of admiration of somebody else, and
modelling herself upon this other, and so producing a hopeless
incongruity. When she dressed for practical purposes she always looked
well. In winter, wearing a tweed coat-and-skirt and a small hat of
black fur pulled over her eager, palpitant face, she seemed to move
down the street in a drifting motion of suspense and exceeding
sensitive receptivity.</p>

<p>At the end of the first year Ursula got through her Intermediate Arts
examination, and there came a lull in her eager activities. She
slackened off, she relaxed altogether. Worn nervous and inflammable by
the excitement of the preparation for the examination, and by the sort
of exaltation which carried her through the crisis itself, she now fell
into a quivering passivity, her will all loosened.</p>

<p>The family went to Scarborough for a month. Gudrun and the father were
busy at the handicraft holiday school there, Ursula was left a good
deal with the children. But when she could, she went off by herself.</p>

<p>She stood and looked out over the shining sea. It was very beautiful to
her. The tears rose hot in her heart.</p>

<p>Out of the far, far space there drifted slowly in to her a passionate,
unborn yearning. &quot;There are so many dawns that have not yet risen.&quot; It
seemed as if, from over the edge of the sea, all the unrisen dawns were
appealing to her, all her unborn soul was crying for the unrisen dawns.</p>

<p>As she sat looking out at the tender sea, with its lovely, swift
glimmer, the sob rose in her breast, till she caught her lip suddenly
under her teeth, and the tears were forcing themselves from her. And in
her very sob, she laughed. Why did she cry? She did not want to cry. It
was so beautiful that she laughed. It was so beautiful that she cried.</p>

<p>She glanced apprehensively round, hoping no one would see her in this
state.</p>

<p>Then came a time when the sea was rough. She watched the water
travelling in to the coast, she watched a big wave running unnoticed,
to burst in a shock of foam against a rock, enveloping all in a great
white beauty, to pour away again, leaving the rock emerged black and
teeming. Oh, and if, when the wave burst into whiteness, it were only
set free!</p>

<p>Sometimes she loitered along the harbour, looking at the sea-browned
sailors, who, in their close blue jerseys, lounged on the harbour-wall,
and laughed at her with impudent, communicative eyes.</p>

<p>There was established a little relation between her and them. She never
would speak to them or know any more of them. Yet as she walked by and
they leaned on the sea-wall, there was something between her and them,
something keen and delightful and painful. She liked best the young one
whose fair, salty hair tumbled over his blue eyes. He was so new and
fresh and salt and not of this world.</p>

<p>From Scarborough she went to her Uncle Tom's. Winifred had a small
baby, born at the end of the summer. She had become strange and alien
to Ursula. There was an unmentionable reserve between the two women.
Tom Brangwen was an attentive father, a very domestic husband. But
there was something spurious about his domesticity, Ursula did not like
him any more. Something ugly, blatant in his nature had come out now,
making him shift everything over to a sentimental basis. A
materialistic unbeliever, he carried it all off by becoming full of
human feeling, a warm, attentive host, a generous husband, a model
citizen. And he was clever enough to rouse admiration everywhere, and
to take in his wife sufficiently. She did not love him. She was glad to
live in a state of complacent self-deception with him, she worked
according to him.</p>

<p>Ursula was relieved to go home. She had still two peaceful years before
her. Her future was settled for two years. She returned to college to
prepare for her final examination.</p>

<p>But during this year the glamour began to depart from college. The
professors were not priests initiated into the deep mysteries of life
and knowledge. After all, they were only middle-men handling wares they
had become so accustomed to that they were oblivious of them. What was
Latin? - So much dry goods of knowledge. What was the Latin class
altogether but a sort of second-hand curio shop, where one bought
curios and learned the market-value of curios; dull curios too, on the
whole. She was as bored by the Latin curiosities as she was by Chinese
and Japanese curiosities in the antique shops. &quot;Antiques&quot; - the very
word made her soul fall flat and dead.</p>

<p>The life went out of her studies, why, she did not know. But the whole
thing seemed sham, spurious; spurious Gothic arches, spurious peace,
spurious Latinity, spurious dignity of France, spurious naivete of
Chaucer. It was a second-hand dealer's shop, and one bought an
equipment for an examination. This was only a little side-show to the
factories of the town. Gradually the perception stole into her. This
was no religious retreat, no perception of pure learning. It was a
little apprentice-shop where one was further equipped for making money.
The college itself was a little, slovenly laboratory for the factory.</p>

<p>A harsh and ugly disillusion came over her again, the same darkness and
bitter gloom from which she was never safe now, the realisation of the
permanent substratum of ugliness under everything. As she came to the
college in the afternoon, the lawns were frothed with daisies, the lime
trees hung tender and sunlit and green; and oh, the deep, white froth
of the daisies was anguish to see.</p>

<p>For inside, inside the college, she knew she must enter the sham
workshop. All the while, it was a sham store, a sham warehouse, with a
single motive of material gain, and no productivity. It pretended to
exist by the religious virtue of knowledge. But the religious virtue of
knowledge was become a flunkey to the god of material success.</p>

<p>A sort of inertia came over her. Mechanically, from habit, she went on
with her studies. But it was almost hopeless. She could scarcely attend
to anything. At the Anglo-Saxon lecture in the afternoon, she sat
looking down, out of the window, hearing no word, of Beowulf or of
anything else. Down below, in the street, the sunny grey pavement went
beside the palisade. A woman in a pink frock, with a scarlet sunshade,
crossed the road, a little white dog running like a fleck of light
about her. The woman with the scarlet sunshade came over the road, a
lilt in her walk, a little shadow attending her. Ursula watched spell-
bound. The woman with the scarlet sunshade and the flickering terrier
was gone - and whither? Whither?</p>

<p>In what world of reality was the woman in the pink dress walking? To
what warehouse of dead unreality was she herself confined?</p>

<p>What good was this place, this college? What good was Anglo-Saxon, when
one only learned it in order to answer examination questions, in order
that one should have a higher commercial value later on? She was sick
with this long service at the inner commercial shrine. Yet what else
was there? Was life all this, and this only? Everywhere, everything was
debased to the same service. Everything went to produce vulgar things,
to encumber material life.</p>

<p>Suddenly she threw over French. She would take honours in botany. This
was the one study that lived for her. She had entered into the lives of
the plants. She was fascinated by the strange laws of the vegetable
world. She had here a glimpse of something working entirely apart from
the purpose of the human world.</p>

<p>College was barren, cheap, a temple converted to the most vulgar, petty
commerce. Had she not gone to hear the echo of learning pulsing back to
the source of the mystery? - The source of mystery! And barrenly, the
professors in their gowns offered commercial commodity that could be
turned to good account in the examination room; ready-made stuff too,
and not really worth the money it was intended to fetch; which they all
knew.</p>

<p>All the time in the college now, save when she was labouring in her
botany laboratory, for there the mystery still glimmered, she felt she
was degrading herself in a kind of trade of sham jewjaws.</p>

<p>Angry and stiff, she went through her last term. She would rather be
out again earning her own living. Even Brinsley Street and Mr. Harby
seemed real in comparison. Her violent hatred of the Ilkeston School
was nothing compared with the sterile degradation of college. But she
was not going back to Brinsley Street either. She would take her B.A.,
and become a mistress in some Grammar School for a time.</p>

<p>The last year of her college career was wheeling slowly round. She
could see ahead her examination and her departure. She had the ash of
disillusion gritting under her teeth. Would the next move turn out the
same? Always the shining doorway ahead; and then, upon approach, always
the shining doorway was a gate into another ugly yard, dirty and active
and dead. Always the crest of the hill gleaming ahead under heaven: and
then, from the top of the hill only another sordid valley full of
amorphous, squalid activity.</p>

<p>No matter! Every hill-top was a little different, every valley was
somehow new. Cossethay and her childhood with her father; the Marsh and
the little Church school near the Marsh, and her grandmother and her
uncles; the High School at Nottingham and Anton Skrebensky; Anton
Skrebensky and the dance in the moonlight between the fires; then the
time she could not think of without being blasted, Winifred Inger, and
the months before becoming a school-teacher; then the horrors of
Brinsley Street, lapsing into comparative peacefulness, Maggie, and
Maggie's brother, whose influence she could still feel in her veins,
when she conjured him up; then college, and Dorothy Russell, who was
now in France, then the next move into the world again!</p>

<p>Already it was a history. In every phase she was so different. Yet she
was always Ursula Brangwen. But what did it mean, Ursula Brangwen? She
did not know what she was. Only she was full of rejection, of refusal.
Always, always she was spitting out of her mouth the ash and grit of
disillusion, of falsity. She could only stiffen in rejection, in
rejection. She seemed always negative in her action.</p>

<p>That which she was, positively, was dark and unrevealed, it could not
come forth. It was like a seed buried in dry ash. This world in which
she lived was like a circle lighted by a lamp. This lighted area, lit
up by man's completest consciousness, she thought was all the world:
that here all was disclosed for ever. Yet all the time, within the
darkness she had been aware of points of light, like the eyes of wild
beasts, gleaming, penetrating, vanishing. And her soul had acknowledged
in a great heave of terror only the outer darkness. This inner circle
of light in which she lived and moved, wherein the trains rushed and
the factories ground out their machine-produce and the plants and the
animals worked by the light of science and knowledge, suddenly it
seemed like the area under an arc-lamp, wherein the moths and children
played in the security of blinding light, not even knowing there was
any darkness, because they stayed in the light.</p>

<p>But she could see the glimmer of dark movement just out of range, she
saw the eyes of the wild beast gleaming from the darkness, watching the
vanity of the camp fire and the sleepers; she felt the strange, foolish
vanity of the camp, which said &quot;Beyond our light and our order there is
nothing,&quot; turning their faces always inward towards the sinking fire of
illuminating consciousness, which comprised sun and stars, and the
Creator, and the System of Righteousness, ignoring always the vast
darkness that wheeled round about, with half-revealed shapes lurking on
the edge.</p>

<p>Yea, and no man dared even throw a firebrand into the darkness. For if
he did he was jeered to death by the others, who cried &quot;Fool,
anti-social knave, why would you disturb us with bogeys? There is no
darkness. We move and live and have our being within the light, and
unto us is given the eternal light of knowledge, we comprise and
comprehend the innermost core and issue of knowledge. Fool and knave,
how dare you belittle us with the darkness?&quot;</p>

<p>Nevertheless the darkness wheeled round about, with grey shadow-shapes
of wild beasts, and also with dark shadow-shapes of the angels, whom
the light fenced out, as it fenced out the more familiar beasts of
darkness. And some, having for a moment seen the darkness, saw it
bristling with the tufts of the hyena and the wolf; and some having
given up their vanity of the light, having died in their own conceit,
saw the gleam in the eyes of the wolf and the hyena, that it was the
flash of the sword of angels, flashing at the door to come in, that the
angels in the darkness were lordly and terrible and not to be denied,
like the flash of fangs.</p>

<p>It was a little while before Easter, in her last year of college, when
Ursula was twenty-two years old, that she heard again from Skrebensky.
He had written to her once or twice from South Africa, during the first
months of his service out there in the war, and since had sent her a
post-card every now and then, at ever longer intervals. He had become a
first lieutenant, and had stayed out in Africa. She had not heard of
him now for more than two years.</p>

<p>Often her thoughts returned to him. He seemed like the gleaming dawn,
yellow, radiant, of a long, grey, ashy day. The memory of him was like
the thought of the first radiant hours of morning. And here was the
blank grey ashiness of later daytime. Ah, if he had only remained true
to her, she might have known the sunshine, without all this toil and
hurt and degradation of a spoiled day. He would have been her angel. He
held the keys of the sunshine. Still he held them. He could open to her
the gates of succeeding freedom and delight. Nay, if he had remained
true to her, he would have been the doorway to her, into the boundless
sky of happiness and plunging, inexhaustible freedom which was the
paradise of her soul. Ah, the great range he would have opened to her,
the illimitable endless space for self-realisation and delight for
ever.</p>

<p>The one thing she believed in was in the love she had held for him. It
remained shining and complete, a thing to hark back to. And she said to
herself, when present things seemed a failure:</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, I was fond of him,&quot; as if with him the leading flower of her life
had died.</p>

<p>Now she heard from him again. The chief effect was pain. The pleasure,
the spontaneous joy was not there any longer. But her will rejoiced.
Her will had fixed itself to him. And the old excitement of her dreams
stirred and woke up. He was come, the man with the wondrous lips that
could send the kiss wavering to the very end of all space. Was he come
back to her? She did not believe.</p>

<p>My dear Ursula, I am back in England again for a few months before
going out again, this time to India. I wonder if you still keep the
memory of our times together. I have still got the little photograph of
you. You must be changed since then, for it is about six years ago. I
am fully six years older, - I have lived through another life since I
knew you at Cossethay. I wonder if you would care to see me. I shall
come up to Derby next week, and I would call in Nottingham, and we
might have tea together. Will you let me know? I shall look for your
answer.</p>

<p>Anton Skrebensky</p>

<p>Ursula had taken this letter from the rack in the hall at college, and
torn it open as she crossed to the Women's room. The world seemed to
dissolve away from around her, she stood alone in clear air.</p>

<p>Where could she go, to be alone? She fled away, upstairs, and through
the private way to the reference library. Seizing a book, she sat down
and pondered the letter. Her heart beat, her limbs trembled. As in a
dream, she heard one gong sound in the college, then, strangely,
another. The first lecture had gone by.</p>

<p>Hurriedly she took one of her note-books and began to write.</p>

<p>&quot;Dear Anton, Yes, I still have the ring. I should be very glad to see
you again. You can come here to college for me, or I will meet you
somewhere in the town. Will you let me know? Your sincere friend -  - &quot;</p>

<p>Trembling, she asked the librarian, who was her friend, if he would
give her an envelope. She sealed and addressed her letter, and went
out, bare-headed, to post it. When it was dropped into the pillar-box,
the world became a very still, pale place, without confines. She
wandered back to college, to her pale dream, like a first wan light of
dawn.</p>

<p>Skrebensky came one afternoon the following week. Day after day, she
had hurried swiftly to the letter-rack on her arrival at college in
the morning, and during the intervals between lectures. Several times,
swiftly, with secretive fingers, she had plucked his letter down from
its public prominence, and fled across the hall holding it fast and
hidden. She read her letters in the botany laboratory, where her corner
was always reserved to her.</p>

<p>Several letters, and then he was coming. It was Friday afternoon he
appointed. She worked over her microscope with feverish activity, able
to give only half her attention, yet working closely and rapidly. She
had on her slide some special stuff come up from London that day, and
the professor was fussy and excited about it. At the same time, as she
focused the light on her field, and saw the plant-animal lying shadowy
in a boundless light, she was fretting over a conversation she had had
a few days ago with Dr. Frankstone, who was a woman doctor of physics
in the college.</p>

<p>&quot;No, really,&quot; Dr. Frankstone had said, &quot;I don't see why we should
attribute some special mystery to life - do you? We don't understand it
as we understand electricity, even, but that doesn't warrant our saying
it is something special, something different in kind and distinct from
everything else in the universe - do you think it does? May it not be
that life consists in a complexity of physical and chemical activities,
of the same order as the activities we already know in science? I don't
see, really, why we should imagine there is a special order of life,
and life alone -  - &quot;</p>

<p>The conversation had ended on a note of uncertainty, indefinite,
wistful. But the purpose, what was the purpose? Electricity had no
soul, light and heat had no soul. Was she herself an impersonal force,
or conjunction of forces, like one of these? She looked still at the
unicellular shadow that lay within the field of light, under her
microscope. It was alive. She saw it move - she saw the bright mist of
its ciliary activity, she saw the gleam of its nucleus, as it slid
across the plane of light. What then was its will? If it was a
conjunction of forces, physical and chemical, what held these forces
unified, and for what purpose were they unified?</p>

<p>For what purpose were the incalculable physical and chemical activities
nodalised in this shadowy, moving speck under her microscope? What was
the will which nodalised them and created the one thing she saw? What
was its intention? To be itself? Was its purpose just mechanical and
limited to itself?</p>

<p>It intended to be itself. But what self? Suddenly in her mind the world
gleamed strangely, with an intense light, like the nucleus of the
creature under the microscope. Suddenly she had passed away into an
intensely-gleaming light of knowledge. She could not understand what it
all was. She only knew that it was not limited mechanical energy, nor
mere purpose of self-preservation and self-assertion. It was a
consummation, a being infinite. Self was a oneness with the infinite.
To be oneself was a supreme, gleaming triumph of infinity.</p>

<p>Ursula sat abstracted over her microscope, in suspense. Her soul was
busy, infinitely busy, in the new world. In the new world, Skrebensky
was waiting for her - he would be waiting for her. She could not go yet,
because her soul was engaged. Soon she would go.</p>

<p>A stillness, like passing away, took hold of her. Far off, down the
corridors, she heard the gong booming five o'clock. She must go. Yet
she sat still.</p>

<p>The other students were pushing back their stools and putting their
microscopes away. Everything broke into turmoil. She saw, through the
window, students going down the steps, with books under their arms,
talking, all talking.</p>

<p>A great craving to depart came upon her. She wanted also to be gone.
She was in dread of the material world, and in dread of her own
transfiguration. She wanted to run to meet Skrebensky - the new life,
the reality.</p>

<p>Very rapidly she wiped her slides and put them back, cleared her place
at the bench, active, active, active. She wanted to run to meet
Skrebensky, hasten - hasten. She did not know what she was to meet. But
it would be a new beginning. She must hurry.</p>

<p>She flitted down the corridor on swift feet, her razor and note-books
and pencil in one hand, her pinafore over her arm. Her face was lifted
and tense with eagerness. He might not be there.</p>

<p>Issuing from the corridor, she saw him at once. She knew him at once.
Yet he was so strange. He stood with the curious self-effacing
diffidence which so frightened her in well-bred young men whom she
knew. He stood as if he wished to be unseen. He was very well-dressed.
She would not admit to herself the chill like a sunshine of frost that
came over her. This was he, the key, the nucleus to the new world.</p>

<p>He saw her coming swiftly across the hall, a slim girl in a white
flannel blouse and dark skirt, with some of the abstraction and gleam
of the unknown upon her, and he started, excited. He was very nervous.
Other students were loitering about the hall.</p>

<p>She laughed, with a blind, dazzled face, as she gave him her hand. He
too could not perceive her.</p>

<p>In a moment she was gone, to get her outdoor things. Then again, as
when she had been at school, they walked out into the town to tea. And
they went to the same tea-shop.</p>

<p>She knew a great difference in him. The kinship was there, the old
kinship, but he had belonged to a different world from hers. It was as
if they had cried a state of truce between him and her, and in this
truce they had met. She knew, vaguely, in the first minute, that they
were enemies come together in a truce. Every movement and word of his
was alien to her being.</p>

<p>Yet still she loved the fine texture of his face, of his skin. He was
rather browner, physically stronger. He was a man now. She thought his
manliness made the strangeness in him. When he was only a youth, fluid,
he was nearer to her. She thought a man must inevitably set into this
strange separateness, cold otherness of being. He talked, but not to
her. She tried to speak to him, but she could not reach him.</p>

<p>He seemed so balanced and sure, he made such a confident presence. He
was a great rider, so there was about him some of a horseman's sureness
and habitual definiteness of decision, also some of the horseman's
animal darkness. Yet his soul was only the more wavering, vague. He
seemed made up of a set of habitual actions and decisions. The
vulnerable, variable quick of the man was inaccessible. She knew
nothing of it. She could only feel the dark, heavy fixity of his animal
desire.</p>

<p>This dumb desire on his part had brought him to her? She was puzzled,
hurt by some hopeless fixity in him, that terrified her with a cold
feeling of despair. What did he want? His desires were so underground.
Why did he not admit himself? What did he want? He wanted something
that should be nameless. She shrank in fear.</p>

<p>Yet she flashed with excitement. In his dark, subterranean male soul,
he was kneeling before her, darkly exposing himself. She quivered, the
dark flame ran over her. He was waiting at her feet. He was helpless,
at her mercy. She could take or reject. If she rejected him, something
would die in him. For him it was life or death. And yet, all must be
kept so dark, the consciousness must admit nothing.</p>

<p>&quot;How long,&quot; she said, &quot;are you staying in England?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am not sure - but not later than July, I believe.&quot;</p>

<p>Then they were both silent. He was here, in England, for six months.
They had a space of six months between them. He waited. The same iron
rigidity, as if the world were made of steel, possessed her again. It
was no use turning with flesh and blood to this arrangement of forged
metal.</p>

<p>Quickly, her imagination adjusted itself to the situation.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you an appointment in India?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes - I have just the six months' leave.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will you like being out there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think so - there's a good deal of social life, and plenty going
on - hunting, polo - and always a good horse - and plenty of work, any
amount of work.&quot;</p>

<p>He was always side-tracking, always side-tracking his own soul. She
could see him so well out there, in India - one of the governing class,
superimposed upon an old civilisation, lord and master of a clumsier
civilisation than his own. It was his choice. He would become again an
aristocrat, invested with authority and responsibility, having a great
helpless populace beneath him. One of the ruling class, his whole being
would be given over to the fulfilling and the executing of the better
idea of the state. And in India, there would be real work to do. The
country did need the civilisation which he himself represented: it did
need his roads and bridges, and the enlightenment of which he was part.
He would go to India. But that was not her road.</p>

<p>Yet she loved him, the body of him, whatever his decisions might be. He
seemed to want something of her. He was waiting for her to decide of
him. It had been decided in her long ago, when he had kissed her first.
He was her lover, though good and evil should cease. Her will never
relaxed, though her heart and soul must be imprisoned and silenced. He
waited upon her, and she accepted him. For he had come back to her.</p>

<p>A glow came into his face, into his fine, smooth skin, his eyes,
gold-grey, glowed intimately to her. He burned up, he caught fire and
became splendid, royal, something like a tiger. She caught his
brilliant, burnished glamour. Her heart and her soul were shut away
fast down below, hidden. She was free of them. She was to have her
satisfaction.</p>

<p>She became proud and erect, like a flower, putting itself forth in its
proper strength. His warmth invigorated her. His beauty of form, which
seemed to glow out in contrast with the rest of people, made her proud.
It was like deference to her, and made her feel as if she represented
before him all the grace and flower of humanity. She was no mere Ursula
Brangwen. She was Woman, she was the whole of Woman in the human order.
All-containing, universal, how should she be limited to individuality?</p>

<p>She was exhilarated, she did not want to go away from him. She had her
place by him. Who should take her away?</p>

<p>They came out of the cafe.</p>

<p>&quot;Is there anything you would like to do?&quot; he said. &quot;Is there anything
we can do?&quot;</p>

<p>It was a dark, windy night in March.</p>

<p>&quot;There is nothing to do,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Which was the answer he wanted.</p>

<p>&quot;Let us walk then - where shall we walk?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall we go to the river?&quot; she suggested, timidly.</p>

<p>In a moment they were on the tram, going down to Trent Bridge. She was
so glad. The thought of walking in the dark, far-reaching
water-meadows, beside the full river, transported her. Dark water
flowing in silence through the big, restless night made her feel wild.</p>

<p>They crossed the bridge, descended, and went away from the lights. In
an instant, in the darkness, he took her hand and they went in silence,
with subtle feet treading the darkness. The town fumed away on their
left, there were strange lights and sounds, the wind rushed against the
trees, and under the bridge. They walked close together, powerful in
unison. He drew her very close, held her with a subtle, stealthy,
powerful passion, as if they had a secret agreement which held good in
the profound darkness. The profound darkness was their universe.</p>

<p>&quot;It is like it was before,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Yet it was not in the least as it was before. Nevertheless his heart
was perfectly in accord with her. They thought one thought.</p>

<p>&quot;I knew I should come back,&quot; he said at length.</p>

<p>She quivered.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you always love me?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>The directness of the question overcame him, submerged him for a
moment. The darkness travelled massively along.</p>

<p>&quot;I had to come back to you,&quot; he said, as if hypnotised. &quot;You were
always at the back of everything.&quot;</p>

<p>She was silent with triumph, like fate.</p>

<p>&quot;I loved you,&quot; she said, &quot;always.&quot;</p>

<p>The dark flame leaped up in him. He must give her himself. He must give
her the very foundations of himself. He drew her very close, and they
went on in silence.</p>

<p>She started violently, hearing voices. They were near a stile across
the dark meadows.</p>

<p>&quot;It's only lovers,&quot; he said to her, softly.</p>

<p>She looked to see the dark figures against the fence, wondering that
the darkness was inhabited.</p>

<p>&quot;Only lovers will walk here to-night,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Then in a low, vibrating voice he told her about Africa, the strange
darkness, the strange, blood fear.</p>

<p>&quot;I am not afraid of the darkness in England,&quot; he said. &quot;It is soft, and
natural to me, it is my medium, especially when you are here. But in
Africa it seems massive and fluid with terror - not fear of
anything - just fear. One breathes it, like the smell of blood. The
blacks know it. They worship it, really, the darkness. One almost likes
it - the fear - something sensual.&quot;</p>

<p>She thrilled again to him. He was to her a voice out of the darkness.
He talked to her all the while, in low tones, about Africa, conveying
something strange and sensual to her: the negro, with his loose, soft
passion that could envelop one like a bath. Gradually he transferred to
her the hot, fecund darkness that possessed his own blood. He was
strangely secret. The whole world must be abolished. He maddened her
with his soft, cajoling, vibrating tones. He wanted her to answer, to
understand. A turgid, teeming night, heavy with fecundity in which
every molecule of matter grew big with increase, secretly urgent with
fecund desire, seemed to come to pass. She quivered, taut and
vibrating, almost pained. And gradually, he ceased telling her of
Africa, there came a silence, whilst they walked the darkness beside
the massive river. Her limbs were rich and tense, she felt they must be
vibrating with a low, profound vibration. She could scarcely walk. The
deep vibration of the darkness could only be felt, not heard.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as they walked, she turned to him and held him fast, as if
she were turned to steel.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you love me?&quot; she cried in anguish.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, in a curious, lapping voice, unlike himself. &quot;Yes, I
love you.&quot;</p>

<p>He seemed like the living darkness upon her, she was in the embrace of
the strong darkness. He held her enclosed, soft, unutterably soft, and
with the unrelaxing softness of fate, the relentless softness of
fecundity. She quivered, and quivered, like a tense thing that is
struck. But he held her all the time, soft, unending, like darkness
closed upon her, omnipresent as the night. He kissed her, and she
quivered as if she were being destroyed, shattered. The lighted vessel
vibrated, and broke in her soul, the light fell, struggled, and went
dark. She was all dark, will-less, having only the receptive will.</p>

<p>He kissed her, with his soft, enveloping kisses, and she responded to
them completely, her mind, her soul gone out. Darkness cleaving to
darkness, she hung close to him, pressed herself into soft flow of his
kiss, pressed herself down, down to the source and core of his kiss,
herself covered and enveloped in the warm, fecund flow of his kiss,
that travelled over her, flowed over her, covered her, flowed over the
last fibre of her, so they were one stream, one dark fecundity, and she
clung at the core of him, with her lips holding open the very
bottommost source of him.</p>

<p>So they stood in the utter, dark kiss, that triumphed over them both,
subjected them, knitted them into one fecund nucleus of the fluid
darkness.</p>

<p>It was bliss, it was the nucleolating of the fecund darkness. Once the
vessel had vibrated till it was shattered, the light of consciousness
gone, then the darkness reigned, and the unutterable satisfaction.</p>

<p>They stood enjoying the unmitigated kiss, taking it, giving to it
endlessly, and still it was not exhausted. Their veins fluttered, their
blood ran together as one stream.</p>

<p>Till gradually a sleep, a heaviness settled on them, a drowse, and out
of the drowse, a small light of consciousness woke up. Ursula became
aware of the night around her, the water lapping and running full just
near, the trees roaring and soughing in gusts of wind.</p>

<p>She kept near to him, in contact with him, but she became ever more and
more herself. And she knew she must go to catch her train. But she did
not want to draw away from contact with him.</p>

<p>At length they roused and set out. No longer they existed in the
unblemished darkness. There was the glitter of a bridge, the twinkle of
lights across the river, the big flare of the town in front and on
their right.</p>

<p>But still, dark and soft and incontestable, their bodies walked
untouched by the lights, darkness supreme and arrogant.</p>

<p>&quot;The stupid lights,&quot; Ursula said to herself, in her dark sensual
arrogance. &quot;The stupid, artificial, exaggerated town, fuming its
lights. It does not exist really. It rests upon the unlimited darkness,
like a gleam of coloured oil on dark water, but what is it? - nothing,
just nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>In the tram, in the train, she felt the same. The lights, the civic
uniform was a trick played, the people as they moved or sat were only
dummies exposed. She could see, beneath their pale, wooden pretence of
composure and civic purposefulness, the dark stream that contained them
all. They were like little paper ships in their motion. But in reality
each one was a dark, blind, eager wave urging blindly forward, dark
with the same homogeneous desire. And all their talk and all their
behaviour was sham, they were dressed-up creatures. She was reminded of
the Invisible Man, who was a piece of darkness made visible only by his
clothes.</p>

<p>During the next weeks, all the time she went about in the same dark
richness, her eyes dilated and shining like the eyes of a wild animal,
a curious half-smile which seemed to be gibing at the civic pretence of
all the human life about her.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you, you pale citizens?&quot; her face seemed to say, gleaming.
&quot;You subdued beast in sheep's clothing, you primeval darkness falsified
to a social mechanism.&quot;</p>

<p>She went about in the sensual sub-consciousness all the time, mocking
at the ready-made, artificial daylight of the rest.</p>

<p>&quot;They assume selves as they assume suits of clothing,&quot; she said to
herself, looking in mocking contempt at the stiffened, neutralised men.
&quot;They think it better to be clerks or professors than to be the dark,
fertile beings that exist in the potential darkness. What do you think
you are?&quot; her soul asked of the professor as she sat opposite him in
class. &quot;What do you think you are, as you sit there in your gown and
your spectacles? You are a lurking, blood-sniffing creature with eyes
peering out of the jungle darkness, snuffing for your desires. That is
what you are, though nobody would believe it, and you would be the very
last to allow it.&quot;</p>

<p>Her soul mocked at all this pretence. Herself, she kept on pretending.
She dressed herself and made herself fine, she attended her lectures
and scribbled her notes. But all in a mood of superficial, mocking
facility. She understood well enough their two-and-two-make-four
tricks. She was as clever as they were. But care! - did she care about
their monkey tricks of knowledge or learning or civic deportment? She
did not care in the least.</p>

<p>There was Skrebensky, there was her dark, vital self. Outside the
college, the outer darkness, Skrebensky was waiting. On the edge of the
night, he was attentive. Did he care?</p>

<p>She was free as a leopard that sends up its raucous cry in the night.
She had the potent, dark stream of her own blood, she had the
glimmering core of fecundity, she had her mate, her complement, her
sharer in fruition. So, she had all, everything.</p>

<p>Skrebensky was staying in Nottingham all the time. He too was free. He
knew no one in this town, he had no civic self to maintain. He was
free. Their trams and markets and theatres and public meetings were a
shaken kaleidoscope to him, he watched as a lion or a tiger may lie
with narrowed eyes watching the people pass before its cage, the
kaleidoscopic unreality of people, or a leopard lie blinking, watching
the incomprehensible feats of the keepers. He despised it all - it was
all non-existent. Their good professors, their good clergymen, their
good political speakers, their good, earnest women - all the time he
felt his soul was grinning, grinning at the sight of them. So many
performing puppets, all wood and rag for the performance!</p>

<p>He watched the citizen, a pillar of society, a model, saw the stiff
goat's legs, which have become almost stiffened to wood in the desire
to make them puppet in their action, he saw the trousers formed to the
puppet-action: man's legs, but man's legs become rigid and deformed,
ugly, mechanical.</p>

<p>He was curiously happy, being alone, now. The glimmering grin was on
his face. He had no longer any necessity to take part in the performing
tricks of the rest. He had discovered the clue to himself, he had
escaped from the show, like a wild beast escaped straight back into its
jungle. Having a room in a quiet hotel, he hired a horse and rode out
into the country, staying sometimes for the night in some village, and
returning the next day.</p>

<p>He felt rich and abundant in himself. Everything he did was a
voluptuous pleasure to him - either to ride on horseback, or to walk, or
to lie in the sun, or to drink in a public-house. He had no use for
people, nor for words. He had an amused pleasure in everything, a great
sense of voluptuous richness in himself, and of the fecundity of the
universal night he inhabited. The puppet shapes of people, their
wood-mechanical voices, he was remote from them.</p>

<p>For there were always his meetings with Ursula. Very often, she did not
go to college in the afternoon, but walked with him instead. Or he took
a motor-car or a dog-cart and they drove into the country, leaving the
car and going away by themselves into the woods. He had not taken her
yet. With subtle, instinctive economy, they went to the end of each
kiss, each embrace, each pleasure in intimate contact, knowing
subconsciously that the last was coming. It was to be their final entry
into the source of creation.</p>

<p>She took him home, and he stayed a week-end at Beldover with her
family. She loved having him in the house. Strange how he seemed to
come into the atmosphere of her family, with his laughing, insidious
grace. They all loved him, he was kin to them. His raillery, his warm,
voluptuous mocking presence was meat and joy to the Brangwen household.
For this house was always quivering with darkness, they put off their
puppet form when they came home, to lie and drowse in the sun.</p>

<p>There was a sense of freedom amongst them all, of the undercurrent of
darkness among them all. Yet here, at home, Ursula resented it. It
became distasteful to her. And she knew that if they understood the
real relationship between her and Skrebensky, her parents, her father
in particular, would go mad with rage. So subtly, she seemed to be like
any other girl who is more or less courted by a man. And she was like
any other girl. But in her, the antagonism to the social imposition was
for the time complete and final.</p>

<p>She waited, every moment of the day, for his next kiss. She admitted it
to herself in shame and bliss. Almost consciously, she waited. He
waited, but, until the time came, more unconsciously. When the time
came that he should kiss her again, a prevention was an annihilation to
him. He felt his flesh go grey, he was heavy with a corpse-like
inanition, he did not exist, if the time passed unfulfilled.</p>

<p>He came to her finally in a superb consummation. It was very dark, and
again a windy, heavy night. They had come down the lane towards
Beldover, down to the valley. They were at the end of their kisses, and
there was the silence between them. They stood as at the edge of a
cliff, with a great darkness beneath.</p>

<p>Coming out of the lane along the darkness, with the dark space
spreading down to the wind, and the twinkling lights of the station
below, the far-off windy chuff of a shunting train, the tiny
clink-clink-clink of the wagons blown between the wind, the light of
Beldover-edge twinkling upon the blackness of the hill opposite, the
glow of the furnaces along the railway to the right, their steps began
to falter. They would soon come out of the darkness into the lights. It
was like turning back. It was unfulfilment. Two quivering, unwilling
creatures, they lingered on the edge of the darkness, peering out at
the lights and the machine-glimmer beyond. They could not turn back to
the world - they could not.</p>

<p>So lingering along, they came to a great oak tree by the path. In all
its budding mass it roared to the wind, and its trunk vibrated in every
fibre, powerful, indomitable.</p>

<p>&quot;We will sit down,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>And in the roaring circle under the tree, that was almost invisible yet
whose powerful presence received them, they lay a moment looking at the
twinkling lights on the darkness opposite, saw the sweeping brand of a
train past the edge of their darkened field.</p>

<p>Then he turned and kissed her, and she waited for him. The pain to her
was the pain she wanted, the agony was the agony she wanted. She was
caught up, entangled in the powerful vibration of the night. The man,
what was he? - a dark, powerful vibration that encompassed her. She
passed away as on a dark wind, far, far away, into the pristine
darkness of paradise, into the original immortality. She entered the
dark fields of immortality.</p>

<p>When she rose, she felt strangely free, strong. She was not
ashamed, - why should she be? He was walking beside her, the man who had
been with her. She had taken him, they had been together. Whither they
had gone, she did not know. But it was as if she had received another
nature. She belonged to the eternal, changeless place into which they
had leapt together.</p>

<p>Her soul was sure and indifferent of the opinion of the world of
artificial light. As they went up the steps of the foot-bridge over the
railway, and met the train-passengers, she felt herself belonging to
another world, she walked past them immune, a whole darkness dividing
her from them. When she went into the lighted dining-room at home, she
was impervious to the lights and the eyes of her parents. Her everyday
self was just the same. She merely had another, stronger self that knew
the darkness.</p>

<p>This curious separate strength, that existed in darkness and pride of
night, never forsook her. She had never been more herself. It could not
occur to her that anybody, not even the young man of the world,
Skrebensky, should have anything at all to do with her permanent self.
As for her temporal, social self, she let it look after itself.</p>

<p>Her whole soul was implicated with Skrebensky - not the young man of the
world, but the undifferentiated man he was. She was perfectly sure of
herself, perfectly strong, stronger than all the world. The world was
not strong - she was strong. The world existed only in a secondary
sense: - she existed supremely.</p>

<p>She continued at college, in her ordinary routine, merely as a cover to
her dark, powerful under-life. The fact of herself, and with her
Skrebensky, was so powerful, that she took rest in the other. She went
to college in the morning, and attended her classes, flowering, and
remote.</p>

<p>She had lunch with him in his hotel; every evening she spent with him,
either in town, at his rooms, or in the country. She made the excuse at
home of evening study for her degree. But she paid not the slightest
attention to her study.</p>

<p>They were both absolute and happy and calm. The fact of their own
consummate being made everything else so entirely subordinate that they
were free. The only thing they wanted, as the days went by, was more
time to themselves. They wanted the time to be absolutely their own.</p>

<p>The Easter vacation was approaching. They agreed to go right away. It
would not matter if they did not come back. They were indifferent to
the actual facts.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose we ought to get married,&quot; he said, rather wistfully. It was
so magnificently free and in a deeper world, as it was. To make public
their connection would be to put it in range with all the things which
nullified him, and from which he was for the moment entirely
dissociated. If he married he would have to assume his social self. And
the thought of assuming his social self made him at once diffident and
abstract. If she were his social wife, if she were part of that
complication of dead reality, then what had his under-life to do with
her? One's social wife was almost a material symbol. Whereas now she
was something more vivid to him than anything in conventional life
could be. She gave the complete lie to all conventional life, he and
she stood together, dark, fluid, infinitely potent, giving the living
lie to the dead whole which contained them.</p>

<p>He watched her pensive, puzzled face.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think I want to marry you,&quot; she said, her brow clouded.</p>

<p>It piqued him rather.</p>

<p>&quot;Why not?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's think about it afterwards, shall we?&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He was crossed, yet he loved her violently.</p>

<p>&quot;You've got a museau, not a face,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Have I?&quot; she cried, her face lighting up like a pure flame. She
thought she had escaped. Yet he returned - he was not satisfied.</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; he asked, &quot;why don't you want to marry me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want to be with other people,&quot; she said. &quot;I want to be like
this. I'll tell you if ever I want to marry you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>He would rather the thing was left indefinite, and that she took the
responsibility.</p>

<p>They talked of the Easter vacation. She thought only of complete
enjoyment.</p>

<p>They went to an hotel in Piccadilly. She was supposed to be his wife.
They bought a wedding-ring for a shilling, from a shop in a poor
quarter.</p>

<p>They had revoked altogether the ordinary mortal world. Their confidence
was like a possession upon them. They were possessed. Perfectly and
supremely free they felt, proud beyond all question, and surpassing
mortal conditions.</p>

<p>They were perfect, therefore nothing else existed. The world was a
world of servants whom one civilly ignored. Wherever they went, they
were the sensuous aristocrats, warm, bright, glancing with pure pride
of the senses.</p>

<p>The effect upon other people was extraordinary. The glamour was cast
from the young couple upon all they came into contact with, waiters or
chance acquaintances.</p>

<p>&quot;Oui, Monsieur le baron,&quot; she would reply with a mocking courtesy to
her husband.</p>

<p>So they came to be treated as titled people. He was an officer in the
engineers. They were just married, going to India immediately.</p>

<p>Thus a tissue of romance was round them. She believed she was a young
wife of a titled husband on the eve of departure for India. This, the
social fact, was a delicious make-belief. The living fact was that he
and she were man and woman, absolute and beyond all limitation.</p>

<p>The days went by - they were to have three weeks together - in perfect
success. All the time, they themselves were reality, all outside was
tribute to them. They were quite careless about money, but they did
nothing very extravagant. He was rather surprised when he found that he
had spent twenty pounds in a little under a week, but it was only the
irritation of having to go to the bank. The machinery of the old system
lasted for him, not the system. The money simply did not exist.</p>

<p>Neither did any of the old obligations. They came home from the
theatre, had supper, then flitted about in their dressing-gowns. They
had a large bedroom and a corner sitting-room high up, remote and very
cosy. They ate all their meals in their own rooms, attended by a young
German called Hans, who thought them both wonderful, and answered
assiduously:</p>

<p>&quot;Gewiss, Herr Baron - bitte sehr, Frau Baronin.&quot;</p>

<p>Often, they saw the pink of dawn away across the park. The tower of
Westminster Cathedral was emerging, the lamps of Piccadilly, stringing
away beside the trees of the park, were becoming pale and moth-like,
the morning traffic was clock-clocking down the shadowy road, which had
gleamed all night like metal, down below, running far ahead into the
night, beneath the lamps, and which was now vague, as in a mist,
because of the dawn.</p>

<p>Then, as the flush of dawn became stronger, they opened the glass doors
and went on to the giddy balcony, feeling triumphant as two angels in
bliss, looking down at the still sleeping world, which would wake to a
dutiful, rumbling, sluggish turmoil of unreality.</p>

<p>But the air was cold. They went into their bedroom, and bathed before
going to bed, leaving the partition doors of the bath-room open, so
that the vapour came into the bedroom and faintly dimmed the mirror.
She was always in bed first. She watched him as he bathed, his quick,
unconscious movements, the electric light glinting on his wet
shoulders. He stood out of the bath, his hair all washed flat over his
forehead, and pressed the water out of his eyes. He was slender, and,
to her, perfect, a clean, straight-cut youth, without a grain of
superfluous body. The brown hair on his body was soft and fine and
adorable, he was all beautifully flushed, as he stood in the white
bath-apartment.</p>

<p>He saw her warm, dark, lit-up face watching him from the pillow - yet he
did not see it - it was always present, and was to him as his own eyes.
He was never aware of the separate being of her. She was like his own
eyes and his own heart beating to him.</p>

<p>So he went across to her, to get his sleeping suit. It was always a
perfect adventure to go near to her. She put her arms round him, and
snuffed his warm, softened skin.</p>

<p>&quot;Scent,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Soap,&quot; he answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Soap,&quot; she repeated, looking up with bright eyes. They were both
laughing, always laughing.</p>

<p>Soon they were fast asleep, asleep till midday, close together,
sleeping one sleep. Then they awoke to the ever-changing reality of
their state. They alone inhabited the world of reality. All the rest
lived on a lower sphere.</p>

<p>Whatever they wanted to do, they did. They saw a few people - Dorothy,
whose guest she was supposed to be, and a couple of friends of
Skrebensky, young Oxford men, who called her Mrs. Skrebensky with
entire simplicity. They treated her, indeed, with such respect, that
she began to think she was really quite of the whole universe, of the
old world as well as of the new. She forgot she was outside the pale of
the old world. She thought she had brought it under the spell of her
own, real world. And so she had.</p>

<p>In such ever-changing reality the weeks went by. All the time, they
were an unknown world to each other. Every movement made by the one was
a reality and an adventure to the other. They did not want outside
excitements. They went to very few theatres, they were often in their
sitting-room high up over Piccadilly, with windows open on two sides,
and the door open on to the balcony, looking over the Green Park, or
down upon the minute travelling of the traffic.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, looking at a sunset, she wanted to go. She must be gone.
She must be gone at once. And in two hours' time they were at Charing
Cross taking train for Paris. Paris was his suggestion. She did not
care where it was. The great joy was in setting out. And for a few days
she was happy in the novelty of Paris.</p>

<p>Then, for some reason, she must call in Rouen on the way back to
London. He had an instinctive mistrust of her desire for the place.
But, perversely, she wanted to go there. It was as if she wanted to try
its effect upon her.</p>

<p>For the first time, in Rouen, he had a cold feeling of death; not
afraid of any other man, but of her. She seemed to leave him. She
followed after something that was not him. She did not want him. The
old streets, the cathedral, the age and the monumental peace of the
town took her away from him. She turned to it as if to something she
had forgotten, and wanted. This was now the reality; this great stone
cathedral slumbering there in its mass, which knew no transience nor
heard any denial. It was majestic in its stability, its splendid
absoluteness.</p>

<p>Her soul began to run by itself. He did not realise, nor did she. Yet
in Rouen he had the first deadly anguish, the first sense of the death
towards which they were wandering. And she felt the first heavy
yearning, heavy, heavy hopeless warning, almost like a deep, uneasy
sinking into apathy, hopelessness.</p>

<p>They returned to London. But still they had two days. He began to
tremble, he grew feverish with the fear of her departure. She had in
her some fatal prescience, that made her calm. What would be, would be.</p>

<p>He remained fairly easy, however, still in his state of heightened
glamour, till she had gone, and he had turned away from St. Pancras,
and sat on the tram-car going up Pimlico to the &quot;Angel&quot;, to Moorgate
Street on Sunday evening.</p>

<p>Then the cold horror gradually soaked into him. He saw the horror of
the City Road, he realised the ghastly cold sordidness of the tram-car
in which he sat. Cold, stark, ashen sterility had him surrounded. Where
then was the luminous, wonderful world he belonged to by rights? How
did he come to be thrown on this refuse-heap where he was?</p>

<p>He was as if mad. The horror of the brick buildings, of the tram-car,
of the ashen-grey people in the street made him reeling and blind as if
drunk. He went mad. He had lived with her in a close, living, pulsing
world, where everything pulsed with rich being. Now he found himself
struggling amid an ashen-dry, cold world of rigidity, dead walls and
mechanical traffic, and creeping, spectre-like people. The life was
extinct, only ash moved and stirred or stood rigid, there was a
horrible, clattering activity, a rattle like the falling of dry slag,
cold and sterile. It was as if the sunshine that fell were unnatural
light exposing the ash of the town, as if the lights at night were the
sinister gleam of decomposition.</p>

<p>Quite mad, beside himself, he went to his club and sat with a glass of
whisky, motionless, as if turned to clay. He felt like a corpse that is
inhabited with just enough life to make it appear as any other of the
spectral, unliving beings which we call people in our dead language.
Her absence was worse than pain to him. It destroyed his being.</p>

<p>Dead, he went on from lunch to tea. His face was all the time fixed and
stiff and colourless, his life was a dry, mechanical movement. Yet even
he wondered slightly at the awful misery that had overcome him. How
could he be so ashlike and extinct? He wrote her a letter.</p>

<p>I have been thinking that we must get married before long. My pay will
be more when I get out to India, we shall be able to get along. Or if
you don't want to go to India, I could very probably stay here in
England. But I think you would like India. You could ride, and you
would know just everybody out there. Perhaps if you stay on to take
your degree, we might marry immediately after that. I will write to
your father as soon as I hear from you -  - </p>

<p>He went on, disposing of her. If only he could be with her! All he
wanted now was to marry her, to be sure of her. Yet all the time he was
perfectly, perfectly hopeless, cold, extinct, without emotion or
connection.</p>

<p>He felt as if his life were dead. His soul was extinct. The whole being
of him had become sterile, he was a spectre, divorced from life. He had
no fullness, he was just a flat shape. Day by day the madness
accumulated in him. The horror of not-being possessed him.</p>

<p>He went here, there, and everywhere. But whatever he did, he knew that
only the cipher of him was there, nothing was filled in. He went to the
theatre; what he heard and saw fell upon a cold surface of
consciousness, which was now all that he was, there was nothing behind
it, he could have no experience of any sort. Mechanical registering
took place in him, no more. He had no being, no contents. Neither had
the people he came into contact with. They were mere permutations of
known quantities. There was no roundness or fullness in this world he
now inhabited, everything was a dead shape mental arrangement, without
life or being.</p>

<p>Much of the time, he was with friends and comrades. Then he forgot
everything. Their activities made up for his own negation, they engaged
his negative horror.</p>

<p>He only became happy when he drank, and he drank a good deal. Then he
was just the opposite to what he had been. He became a warm, diffuse,
glowing cloud, in a warm, diffuse formless fashion. Everything melted
down into a rosy glow, and he was the glow, and everything was the
glow, everybody else was the glow, and it was very nice, very nice. He
would sing songs, it was so nice.</p>

<p>Ursula went back to Beldover shut and firm. She loved Skrebensky, of
that she was resolved. She would allow nothing else.</p>

<p>She read his long, obsessed letter about getting married and going to
India, without any particular response. She seemed to ignore what he
said about marriage. It did not come home to her. He seemed, throughout
the greater part of his letter, to be talking without much meaning.</p>

<p>She replied to him pleasantly and easily. She rarely wrote long
letters.</p>

<p>India sounds lovely. I can just see myself on an elephant swaying
between lanes of obsequious natives. But I don't know if father would
let me go. We must see.</p>

<p>I keep living over again the lovely times we have had. But I don't
think you liked me quite so much towards the end, did you? You did not
like me when we left Paris. Why didn't you?</p>

<p>I love you very much. I love your body. It is so clear and fine. I am
glad you do not go naked, or all the women would fall in love with you.
I am very jealous of it, I love it so much.</p>

<p>He was more or less satisfied with this letter. But day after day he
was walking about, dead, non-existent.</p>

<p>He could not come again to Nottingham until the end of April. Then he
persuaded her to go with him for a week-end to a friend's house near
Oxford. By this time they were engaged. He had written to her father,
and the thing was settled. He brought her an emerald ring, of which she
was very proud.</p>

<p>Her people treated her now with a little distance, as if she had
already left them. They left her very much alone.</p>

<p>She went with him for the three days in the country house near Oxford.
It was delicious, and she was very happy. But the thing she remembered
most was when, getting up in the morning after he had gone back quietly
to his own room, having spent the night with her, she found herself
very rich in being alone, and enjoying to the full her solitary room,
she drew up her blind and saw the plum trees in the garden below all
glittering and snowy and delighted with the sunshine, in full bloom
under a blue sky. They threw out their blossom, they flung it out under
the blue heavens, the whitest blossom! How excited it made her.</p>

<p>She had to hurry through her dressing to go and walk in the garden
under the plum trees, before anyone should come and talk to her. Out
she slipped, and paced like a queen in fairy pleasaunces. The blossom
was silver-shadowy when she looked up from under the tree at the blue
sky. There was a faint scent, a faint noise of bees, a wonderful
quickness of happy morning.</p>

<p>She heard the breakfast gong and went indoors.</p>

<p>&quot;Where have you been?&quot; asked the others.</p>

<p>&quot;I had to go out under the plum trees,&quot; she said, her face glowing like
a flower. &quot;It is so lovely.&quot;</p>

<p>A shadow of anger crossed Skrebensky's soul. She had not wanted him to
be there. He hardened his will.</p>

<p>At night there was a moon, and the blossom glistened ghostly, they went
together to look at it. She saw the moonlight on his face as he waited
near her, and his features were like silver and his eyes in shadow were
unfathomable. She was in love with him. He was very quiet.</p>

<p>They went indoors and she pretended to be tired. So she went quickly to
bed.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be long coming to me,&quot; she whispered, as she was supposed to be
kissing him good night.</p>

<p>And he waited, intent, obsessed, for the moment when he could come to
her.</p>

<p>She enjoyed him, she made much of him. She liked to put her fingers on
the soft skin of his sides, or on the softness of his back, when he
made the muscles hard underneath, the muscles developed very strong
through riding; and she had a great thrill of excitement and passion,
because of the unimpressible hardness of his body, that was so soft and
smooth under her fingers, that came to her with such absolute service.</p>

<p>She owned his body and enjoyed it with all the delight and carelessness
of a possessor. But he had become gradually afraid of her body. He
wanted her, he wanted her endlessly. But there had come a tension into
his desire, a constraint which prevented his enjoying the delicious
approach and the lovable close of the endless embrace. He was afraid.
His will was always tense, fixed.</p>

<p>Her final examination was at midsummer. She insisted on sitting for it,
although she had neglected her work during the past months. He also
wanted her to go in for the degree. Then, he thought, she would be
satisfied. Secretly he hoped she would fail, so that she would be more
glad of him.</p>

<p>&quot;Would you rather live in India or in England when we are married?&quot; he
asked her.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, in India, by far,&quot; she said, with a careless lack of consideration
which annoyed him.</p>

<p>Once she said, with heat:</p>

<p>&quot;I shall be glad to leave England. Everything is so meagre and paltry,
it is so unspiritual - I hate democracy.&quot;</p>

<p>He became angry to hear her talk like this, he did not know why.
Somehow, he could not bear it, when she attacked things. It was as if
she were attacking him.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; he asked her, hostile. &quot;Why do you hate democracy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Only the greedy and ugly people come to the top in a democracy,&quot; she
said, &quot;because they're the only people who will push themselves there.
Only degenerate races are democratic.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you want then - an aristocracy?&quot; he asked, secretly moved. He
always felt that by rights he belonged to the ruling aristocracy. Yet
to hear her speak for his class pained him with a curious, painful
pleasure. He felt he was acquiescing in something illegal, taking to
himself some wrong, reprehensible advantages.</p>

<p>&quot;I do want an aristocracy,&quot; she cried. &quot;And I'd far rather have an
aristocracy of birth than of money. Who are the aristocrats now - who
are chosen as the best to rule? Those who have money and the brains for
money. It doesn't matter what else they have: but they must have
money-brains, - because they are ruling in the name of money.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The people elect the government,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;I know they do. But what are the people? Each one of them is a
money-interest. I hate it, that anybody is my equal who has the same
amount of money as I have. I know I am better than all of them. I hate
them. They are not my equals. I hate equality on a money basis. It is
the equality of dirt.&quot;</p>

<p>Her eyes blazed at him, he felt as if she wanted to destroy him. She
had gripped him and was trying to break him. His anger sprang up,
against her. At least he would fight for his existence with her. A
hard, blind resistance possessed him.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't care about money,&quot; he said, &quot;neither do I want to put my
finger in the pie. I am too sensitive about my finger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is your finger to me?&quot; she cried, in a passion. &quot;You with your
dainty fingers, and your going to India because you will be one of the
somebodies there! It's a mere dodge, your going to India.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In what way a dodge?&quot; he cried, white with anger and fear.</p>

<p>&quot;You think the Indians are simpler than us, and so you'll enjoy being
near them and being a lord over them,&quot; she said. &quot;And you'll feel so
righteous, governing them for their own good. Who are you, to feel
righteous? What are you righteous about, in your governing? Your
governing stinks. What do you govern for, but to make things there as
dead and mean as they are here!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't feel righteous in the least,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Then what do you feel? It's all such a nothingness, what you feel and
what you don't feel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you feel yourself?&quot; he said. &quot;Aren't you righteous in your own
mind?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I am, because I'm against you, and all your old, dead things,&quot;
she cried.</p>

<p>She seemed, with the last words, uttered in hard knowledge, to strike
down the flag that he kept flying. He felt cut off at the knees, a
figure made worthless. A horrible sickness gripped him, as if his legs
were really cut away, and he could not move, but remained a crippled
trunk, dependent, worthless. The ghastly sense of helplessness, as if
he were a mere figure that did not exist vitally, made him mad, beside
himself.</p>

<p>Now, even whilst he was with her, this death of himself came over him,
when he walked about like a body from which all individual life is
gone. In this state he neither heard nor saw nor felt, only the
mechanism of his life continued.</p>

<p>He hated her, as far as, in this state, he could hate. His cunning
suggested to him all the ways of making her esteem him. For she did not
esteem him. He left her and did not write to her. He flirted with other
women, with Gudrun.</p>

<p>This last made her very fierce. She was still fiercely jealous of his
body. In passionate anger she upbraided him because, not being man
enough to satisfy one woman, he hung round others.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't I satisfy you?&quot; he asked of her, again going white to the
throat.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;You've never satisfied me since the first week in
London. You never satisfy me now. What does it mean to me, your having
me - &quot; She lifted her shoulders and turned aside her face in a motion of
cold, indifferent worthlessness. He felt he would kill her.</p>

<p>When she had roused him to a pitch of madness, when she saw his eyes
all dark and mad with suffering, then a great suffering overcame her
soul, a great, inconquerable suffering. And she loved him. For, oh, she
wanted to love him. Stronger than life or death was her craving to be
able to love him.</p>

<p>And at such moments, when he was made with her destroying him, when all
his complacency was destroyed, all his everyday self was broken, and
only the stripped, rudimentary, primal man remained, demented with
torture, her passion to love him became love, she took him again, they
came together in an overwhelming passion, in which he knew he satisfied
her.</p>

<p>But it all contained a developing germ of death. After each contact,
her anguished desire for him or for that which she never had from him
was stronger, her love was more hopeless. After each contact his mad
dependence on her was deepened, his hope of standing strong and taking
her in his own strength was weakened. He felt himself a mere attribute
of her.</p>

<p>Whitsuntide came, just before her examination. She was to have a few
days of rest. Dorothy had inherited her patrimony, and had taken a
cottage in Sussex. She invited them to stay with her.</p>

<p>They went down to Dorothy's neat, low cottage at the foot of the downs.
Here they could do as they liked. Ursula was always yearning to go to
the top of the downs. The white track wound up to the rounded summit.
And she must go.</p>

<p>Up there, she could see the Channel a few miles away, the sea raised up
and faintly glittering in the sky, the Isle of Wight a shadow lifted in
the far distance, the river winding bright through the patterned plain
to seaward, Arundel Castle a shadowy bulk, and then the rolling of the
high, smooth downs, making a high, smooth land under heaven,
acknowledging only the heavens in their great, sun-glowing strength,
and suffering only a few bushes to trespass on the intercourse between
their great, unabateable body and the changeful body of the sky.</p>

<p>Below she saw the villages and the woods of the weald, and the train
running bravely, a gallant little thing, running with all the
importance of the world over the water meadows and into the gap of the
downs, waving its white steam, yet all the while so little. So little,
yet its courage carried it from end to end of the earth, till there was
no place where it did not go. Yet the downs, in magnificent
indifference, bearing limbs and body to the sun, drinking sunshine and
sea-wind and sea-wet cloud into its golden skin, with superb stillness
and calm of being, was not the downs still more wonderful? The blind,
pathetic, energetic courage of the train as it steamed tinily away
through the patterned levels to the sea's dimness, so fast and so
energetic, made her weep. Where was it going? It was going nowhere, it
was just going. So blind, so without goal or aim, yet so hasty! She sat
on an old prehistoric earth-work and cried, and the tears ran down her
face. The train had tunnelled all the earth, blindly, and uglily.</p>

<p>And she lay face downwards on the downs, that were so strong, that
cared only for their intercourse with the everlasting skies, and she
wished she could become a strong mound smooth under the sky, bosom and
limbs bared to all winds and clouds and bursts of sunshine.</p>

<p>But she must get up again and look down from her foothold of sunshine,
down and away at the patterned, level earth, with its villages and its
smoke and its energy. So shortsighted the train seemed, running to the
distance, so terrifying in their littleness the villages, with such
pettiness in their activity.</p>

<p>Skrebensky wandered dazed, not knowing where he was or what he was
doing with her. All her passion seemed to be to wander up there on the
downs, and when she must descend to earth, she was heavy. Up there she
was exhilarated and free.</p>

<p>She would not love him in a house any more. She said she hated houses,
and particularly she hated beds. There was something distasteful in his
coming to her bed.</p>

<p>She would stay the night on the downs, up there, he with her. It was
midsummer, the days were glamorously long. At about half-past ten, when
the bluey-black darkness had at last fallen, they took rugs and climbed
the steep track to the summit of the downs, he and she.</p>

<p>Up there, the stars were big, the earth below was gone into darkness.
She was free up there with the stars. Far out they saw tiny yellow
lights - but it was very far out, at sea, or on land. She was free up
among the stars.</p>

<p>She took off her clothes, and made him take off all his, and they ran
over the smooth, moonless turf, a long way, more than a mile from where
they had left their clothing, running in the dark, soft wind, utterly
naked, as naked as the downs themselves. Her hair was loose and blew
about her shoulders, she ran swiftly, wearing sandals when she set off
on the long run to the dew-pond.</p>

<p>In the round dew-pond the stars were untroubled. She ventured softly
into the water, grasping at the stars with her hands.</p>

<p>And then suddenly she started back, running swiftly. He was there,
beside her, but only on sufferance. He was a screen for her fears. He
served her. She took him, she clasped him, clenched him close, but her
eyes were open looking at the stars, it was as if the stars were lying
with her and entering the unfathomable darkness of her womb, fathoming
her at last. It was not him.</p>

<p>The dawn came. They stood together on a high place, an earthwork of the
stone-age men, watching for the light. It came over the land. But the
land was dark. She watched a pale rim on the sky, away against the
darkened land. The darkness became bluer. A little wind was running in
from the sea behind. It seemed to be running to the pale rift of the
dawn. And she and he darkly, on an outpost of the darkness, stood
watching for the dawn.</p>

<p>The light grew stronger, gushing up against the dark sap-hire of the
transparent night. The light grew stronger, whiter, then over it
hovered a flush of rose. A flush of rose, and then yellow, pale,
new-created yellow, the whole quivering and poising momentarily over
the fountain on the sky's rim.</p>

<p>The rose hovered and quivered, burned, fused to flame, to a transient
red, while the yellow urged out in great waves, thrown from the
ever-increasing fountain, great waves of yellow flinging into the sky,
scattering its spray over the darkness, which became bluer and bluer,
paler, till soon it would itself be a radiance, which had been
darkness.</p>

<p>The sun was coming. There was a quivering, a powerful terrifying swim
of molten light. Then the molten source itself surged forth, revealing
itself. The sun was in the sky, too powerful to look at.</p>

<p>And the ground beneath lay so still, so peaceful. Only now and again a
cock crew. Otherwise, from the distant yellow hills to the pine trees
at the foot of the downs, everything was newly washed into being, in a
flood of new, golden creation.</p>

<p>It was so unutterably still and perfect with promise, the
golden-lighted, distinct land, that Ursula's soul rocked and wept.
Suddenly he glanced at her. The tears were running over her cheeks, her
mouth was working strangely.</p>

<p>&quot;What is the matter?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>After a moment's struggle with her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;It is so beautiful,&quot; she said, looking at the glowing, beautiful land.
It was so beautiful, so perfect, and so unsullied.</p>

<p>He too realised what England would be in a few hours' time - a blind,
sordid, strenuous activity, all for nothing, fuming with dirty smoke
and running trains and groping in the bowels of the earth, all for
nothing. A ghastliness came over him.</p>

<p>He looked at Ursula. Her face was wet with tears, very bright, like a
transfiguration in the refulgent light. Nor was his the hand to wipe
away the burning, bright tears. He stood apart, overcome by a cruel
ineffectuality.</p>

<p>Gradually a great, helpless sorrow was rising in him. But as yet he
was fighting it away, he was struggling for his own life. He became
very quiet and unaware of the things about him, awaiting, as it were,
her judgment on him.</p>

<p>They returned to Nottingham, the time of her examination came. She must
go to London. But she would not stay with him in an hotel. She would go
to a quiet little pension near the British Museum.</p>

<p>Those quiet residential squares of London made a great impression on
her mind. They were very complete. Her mind seemed imprisoned in their
quietness. Who was going to liberate her?</p>

<p>In the evening, her practical examinations being over, he went with her
to dinner at one of the hotels down the river, near Richmond. It was
golden and beautiful, with yellow water and white and scarlet-striped
boat-awnings, and blue shadows under the trees.</p>

<p>&quot;When shall we be married?&quot; he asked her, quietly, simply, as if it
were a mere question of comfort.</p>

<p>She watched the changing pleasure-traffic of the river. He looked at
her golden, puzzled museau. The knot gathered in his throat.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>A hot grief gripped his throat.</p>

<p>&quot;Why don't you know - don't you want to be married?&quot; he asked her.</p>

<p>Her head turned slowly, her face, puzzled, like a boy's face,
expressionless because she was trying to think, looked towards his
face. She did not see him, because she was pre-occupied. She did not
quite know what she was going to say.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think I want to be married,&quot; she said, and her naive,
troubled, puzzled eyes rested a moment on his, then travelled away,
pre-occupied.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you mean never, or not just yet?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>The knot in his throat grew harder, his face was drawn as if he were
being strangled.</p>

<p>&quot;I mean never,&quot; she said, out of some far self which spoke for once
beyond her.</p>

<p>His drawn, strangled face watched her blankly for a few moments, then a
strange sound took place in his throat. She started, came to herself,
and, horrified, saw him. His head made a queer motion, the chin jerked
back against the throat, the curious, crowing, hiccupping sound came
again, his face twisted like insanity, and he was crying, crying blind
and twisted as if something were broken which kept him in control.</p>

<p>&quot;Tony - don't,&quot; she cried, starting up.</p>

<p>It tore every one of her nerves to see him. He made groping movements
to get out of his chair. But he was crying uncontrollably, noiselessly,
with his face twisted like a mask, contorted and the tears running down
the amazing grooves in his cheeks. Blindly, his face always this
horrible working mask, he groped for his hat, for his way down from the
terrace. It was eight o'clock, but still brightly light. The other
people were staring. In great agitation, part of which was
exasperation, she stayed behind, paid the waiter with a half-sovereign,
took her yellow silk coat, then followed Skrebensky.</p>

<p>She saw him walking with brittle, blind steps along the path by the
river. She could tell by the strange stiffness and brittleness of his
figure that he was still crying. Hurrying after him, running, she took
his arm.</p>

<p>&quot;Tony,&quot; she cried, &quot;don't! Why are you like this? What are you doing
this for? Don't. It's not necessary.&quot;</p>

<p>He heard, and his manhood was cruelly, coldly defaced. Yet it was no
good. He could not gain control of his face. His face, his breast, were
weeping violently, as if automatically. His will, his knowledge had
nothing to do with it. He simply could not stop.</p>

<p>She walked holding his arm, silent with exasperation and perplexity and
pain. He took the uncertain steps of a blind man, because his mind was
blind with weeping.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall we go home? Shall we have a taxi?&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He could pay no attention. Very flustered, very agitated, she signalled
indefinitely to a taxi-cab that was going slowly by. The driver saluted
and drew up. She opened the door and pushed Skrebensky in, then took
her own place. Her face was uplifted, the mouth closed down, she looked
hard and cold and ashamed. She winced as the driver's dark red face was
thrust round upon her, a full-blooded, animal face with black eyebrows
and a thick, short-cut moustache.</p>

<p>&quot;Where to, lady?&quot; he said, his white teeth showing. Again for a moment
she was flustered.</p>

<p>&quot;Forty, Rutland Square,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He touched his cap and stolidly set the car in motion. He seemed to
have a league with her to ignore Skrebensky.</p>

<p>The latter sat as if trapped within the taxi-cab, his face still
working, whilst occasionally he made quick slight movements of the
head, to shake away his tears. He never moved his hands. She could not
bear to look at him. She sat with face uplifted and averted to the
window.</p>

<p>At length, when she had regained some control over herself, she turned
again to him. He was much quieter. His face was wet, and twitched
occasionally, his hands still lay motionless. But his eyes were quite
still, like a washed sky after rain, full of a wan light, and quite
steady, almost ghost-like.</p>

<p>A pain flamed in her womb, for him.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't think I should hurt you,&quot; she said, laying her hand very
lightly, tentatively, on his arm. &quot;The words came without my knowing.
They didn't mean anything, really.&quot;</p>

<p>He remained quite still, hearing, but washed all wan and without
feeling. She waited, looking at him, as if he were some curious,
not-understandable creature.</p>

<p>&quot;You won't cry again, will you, Tony?&quot;</p>

<p>Some shame and bitterness against her burned him in the question. She
noticed how his moustache was soddened wet with tears. Taking her
handkerchief, she wiped his face. The driver's heavy, stolid back
remained always turned to them, as if conscious but indifferent.
Skrebensky sat motionless whilst Ursula wiped his face, softly,
carefully, and yet clumsily, not as well as he would have wiped it
himself.</p>

<p>Her handkerchief was too small. It was soon wet through. She groped in
his pocket for his own. Then, with its more ample capacity, she
carefully dried his face. He remained motionless all the while. Then
she drew his cheek to hers and kissed him. His face was cold. Her heart
was hurt. She saw the tears welling quickly to his eyes again. As if he
were a child, she again wiped away his tears. By now she herself was on
the point of weeping. Her underlip was caught between her teeth.</p>

<p>So she sat still, for fear of her own tears, sitting close by him,
holding his hand warm and close and loving. Meanwhile the car ran on,
and a soft, midsummer dusk began to gather. For a long while they sat
motionless. Only now and again her hand closed more closely, lovingly,
over his hand, then gradually relaxed.</p>

<p>The dusk began to fall. One or two lights appeared. The driver drew up
to light his lamps. Skrebensky moved for the first time, leaning
forward to watch the driver. His face had always the same still,
clarified, almost childlike look, impersonal.</p>

<p>They saw the driver's strange, full, dark face peering into the lamps
under drawn brows. Ursula shuddered. It was the face almost of an
animal yet of a quick, strong, wary animal that had them within its
knowledge, almost within its power. She clung closer to Krebensky.</p>

<p>&quot;My love?&quot; she said to him, questioningly, when the car was again
running in full motion.</p>

<p>He made no movement or sound. He let her hold his hand, he let her
reach forward, in the gathering darkness, and kiss his still cheek. The
crying had gone by - he would not cry any more. He was whole and himself
again.</p>

<p>&quot;My love,&quot; she repeated, trying to make him notice her. But as yet he
could not.</p>

<p>He watched the road. They were running by Kensington Gardens. For the
first time his lips opened.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall we get out and go into the park,&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, quietly, not sure what was coming.</p>

<p>After a moment he took the tube from its peg. She saw the stout,
strong, self-contained driver lean his head.</p>

<p>&quot;Stop at Hyde Park Corner.&quot;</p>

<p>The dark head nodded, the car ran on just the same.</p>

<p>Presently they pulled up. Skrebensky paid the man. Ursula stood back.
She saw the driver salute as he received his tip, and then, before he
set the car in motion, turn and look at her, with his quick, powerful,
animal's look, his eyes very concentrated and the whites of his eyes
flickering. Then he drove away into the crowd. He had let her go. She
had been afraid.</p>

<p>Skrebensky turned with her into the park. A band was still playing and
the place was thronged with people. They listened to the ebbing music,
then went aside to a dark seat, where they sat closely, hand in hand.</p>

<p>Then at length, as out of the silence, she said to him, wondering:</p>

<p>&quot;What hurt you so?&quot;</p>

<p>She really did not know, at this moment.</p>

<p>&quot;When you said you wanted never to marry me,&quot; he replied, with a
childish simplicity.</p>

<p>&quot;But why did that hurt you so?&quot; she said. &quot;You needn't mind everything
I say so particularly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know - I didn't want to do it,&quot; he said, humbly, ashamed.</p>

<p>She pressed his hand warmly. They sat close together, watching the
soldiers go by with their sweethearts, the lights trailing in myriads
down the great thoroughfares that beat on the edge of the park.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't know you cared so much,&quot; she said, also humbly.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't,&quot; he said. &quot;I was knocked over myself. - But I care - all the
world.&quot;</p>

<p>His voice was so quiet and colourless, it made her heart go pale with
fear.</p>

<p>&quot;My love!&quot; she said, drawing near to him. But she spoke out of fear,
not out of love.</p>

<p>&quot;I care all the world - I care for nothing else - neither in life nor in
death,&quot; he said, in the same steady, colourless voice of essential
truth.</p>

<p>&quot;Than for what?&quot; she murmured duskily.</p>

<p>&quot;Than for you - to be with me.&quot;</p>

<p>And again she was afraid. Was she to be conquered by this? She cowered
close to him, very close to him. They sat perfectly still, listening to
the great, heavy, beating sound of the town, the murmur of lovers going
by, the footsteps of soldiers.</p>

<p>She shivered against him.</p>

<p>&quot;You are cold?&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;A little.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We will go and have some supper.&quot;</p>

<p>He was now always quiet and decided and remote, very beautiful. He
seemed to have some strange, cold power over her.</p>

<p>They went to a restaurant, and drank chianti. But his pale, wan look
did not go away.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't leave me to-night,&quot; he said at length, looking at her, pleading.
He was so strange and impersonal, she was afraid.</p>

<p>&quot;But the people of my place,&quot; she said, quivering.</p>

<p>&quot;I will explain to them - they know we are engaged.&quot;</p>

<p>She sat pale and mute. He waited.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall we go?&quot; he said at length.</p>

<p>&quot;Where?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To an hotel.&quot;</p>

<p>Her heart was hardened. Without answering, she rose to acquiesce. But
she was now cold and unreal. Yet she could not refuse him. It seemed
like fate, a fate she did not want.</p>

<p>They went to an Italian hotel somewhere, and had a sombre bedroom with
a very large bed, clean, but sombre. The ceiling was painted with a
bunch of flowers in a big medallion over the bed. She thought it was
pretty.</p>

<p>He came to her, and cleaved to her very close, like steel cleaving and
clinching on to her. Her passion was roused, it was fierce but cold.
But it was fierce, and extreme, and good, their passion this night. He
slept with her fast in his arms. All night long he held her fast
against him. She was passive, acquiscent. But her sleep was not very
deep nor very real.</p>

<p>She woke in the morning to a sound of water dashed on a courtyard, to
sunlight streaming through a lattice. She thought she was in a foreign
country. And Skrebensky was there an incubus upon her.</p>

<p>She lay still, thinking, whilst his arm was round her, his head against
her shoulders, his body against hers, just behind her. He was still
asleep.</p>

<p>She watched the sunshine coming in bars through the persiennes, and her
immediate surroundings again melted away.</p>

<p>She was in some other land, some other world, where the old restraints
had dissolved and vanished, where one moved freely, not afraid of one's
fellow men, nor wary, nor on the defensive, but calm, indifferent, at
one's ease. Vaguely, in a sort of silver light, she wandered at large
and at ease. The bonds of the world were broken. This world of England
had vanished away. She heard a voice in the yard below calling:</p>

<p>&quot;O Giovann' - O'-O'-O'-Giovann' -  - !&quot;</p>

<p>And she knew she was in a new country, in a new life. It was very
delicious to lie thus still, with one's soul wandering freely and
simply in the silver light of some other, simpler, more finely natural
world.</p>

<p>But always there was a foreboding waiting to command her. She became
more aware of Skrebensky. She knew he was waking up. She must modify
her soul, depart from her further world, for him.</p>

<p>She knew he was awake. He lay still, with a concrete stillness, not as
when he slept. Then his arm tightened almost convulsively upon her, and
he said, half timidly:</p>

<p>&quot;Did you sleep well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So did I.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>&quot;And do you love me?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>She turned and looked at him searchingly. He seemed outside her.</p>

<p>&quot;I do,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>But she said it out of complacency and a desire not to be harried.
There was a curious breach of silence between them, which frightened
him.</p>

<p>They lay rather late, then he rang for breakfast. She wanted to be able
to go straight downstairs and away from the place, when she got up. She
was happy in this room, but the thought of the publicity of the hall
downstairs rather troubled her.</p>

<p>A young Italian, a Sicilian, dark and slightly pock-marked, buttoned up
in a sort of grey tunic, appeared with the tray. His face had an almost
African imperturbability, impassive, incomprehensible.</p>

<p>&quot;One might be in Italy,&quot; Skrebensky said to him, genially. A vacant
look, almost like fear, came on the fellow's face. He did not
understand.</p>

<p>&quot;This is like Italy,&quot; Skrebensky explained.</p>

<p>The face of the Italian flashed with a non-comprehending smile, he
finished setting out the tray, and was gone. He did not understand: he
would understand nothing: he disappeared from the door like a half-
domesticated wild animal. It made Ursula shudder slightly, the quick,
sharp-sighted, intent animality of the man.</p>

<p>Skrebensky was beautiful to her this morning, his face softened and
transfused with suffering and with love, his movements very still and
gentle. He was beautiful to her, but she was detached from him by a
chill distance. Always she seemed to be bearing up against the distance
that separated them. But he was unaware. This morning he was transfused
and beautiful. She admired his movements, the way he spread honey on
his roll, or poured out the coffee.</p>

<p>When breakfast was over, she lay still again on the pillows, whilst he
went through his toilet. She watched him, as he sponged himself, and
quickly dried himself with the towel. His body was beautiful, his
movements intent and quick, she admired him and she appreciated him
without reserve. He seemed completed now. He aroused no fruitful
fecundity in her. He seemed added up, finished. She knew him all round,
not on any side did he lead into the unknown. Poignant, almost
passionate appreciation she felt for him, but none of the dreadful
wonder, none of the rich fear, the connection with the unknown, or the
reverence of love. He was, however, unaware this morning. His body was
quiet and fulfilled, his veins complete with satisfaction, he was
happy, finished.</p>

<p>Again she went home. But this time he went with her. He wanted to stay
by her. He wanted her to marry him. It was already July. In early
September he must sail for India. He could not bear to think of going
alone. She must come with him. Nervously, he kept beside her.</p>

<p>Her examination was finished, her college career was over. There
remained for her now to marry or to work again. She applied for no
post. It was concluded she would marry. India tempted her - the strange,
strange land. But with the thought of Calcutta, or Bombay, or of Simla,
and of the European population, India was no more attractive to her
than Nottingham.</p>

<p>She had failed in her examination: she had gone down: she had not taken
her degree. It was a blow to her. It hardened her soul.</p>

<p>&quot;It doesn't matter,&quot; he said. &quot;What are the odds, whether you are a
Bachelor of Arts or not, according to the London University? All you
know, you know, and if you are Mrs. Skrebensky, the B.A. is
meaningless.&quot;</p>

<p>Instead of consoling her, this made her harder, more ruthless. She was
now up against her own fate. It was for her to choose between being
Mrs. Skrebensky, even Baroness Skrebensky, wife of a lieutenant in the
Royal Engineers, the Sappers, as he called them, living with the
European population in India - or being Ursula Brangwen, spinster,
school-mistress. She was qualified by her Intermediate Arts
examination. She would probably even now get a post quite easily as
assistant in one of the higher grade schools, or even in Willey Green
School. Which was she to do?</p>

<p>She hated most of all entering the bondage of teaching once more. Very
heartily she detested it. Yet at the thought of marriage and living
with Skrebensky amid the European population in India, her soul was
locked and would not budge. She had very little feeling about it: only
there was a deadlock.</p>

<p>Skrebensky waited, she waited, everybody waited for the decision. When
Anton talked to her, and seemed insidiously to suggest himself as a
husband to her, she knew how utterly locked out he was. On the other
hand, when she saw Dorothy, and discussed the matter, she felt she
would marry him promptly, at once, as a sharp disavowal of adherence
with Dorothy's views.</p>

<p>The situation was almost ridiculous.</p>

<p>&quot;But do you love him?&quot; asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't a question of loving him,&quot; said Ursula. &quot;I love him well
enough - certainly more than I love anybody else in the world. And I
shall never love anybody else the same again. We have had the flower of
each other. But I don't care about love. I don't value it. I don't care
whether I love or whether I don't, whether I have love or whether I
haven't. What is it to me?&quot;</p>

<p>And she shrugged her shoulders in fierce, angry contempt.</p>

<p>Dorothy pondered, rather angry and afraid.</p>

<p>&quot;Then what do you care about?&quot; she asked, exasperated.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; said Ursula. &quot;But something impersonal.
Love - love - love - what does it mean - what does it amount to? So much
personal gratification. It doesn't lead anywhere.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't supposed to lead anywhere, is it?&quot; said Dorothy, satirically.
&quot;I thought it was the one thing which is an end in itself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then what does it matter to me?&quot; cried Ursula. &quot;As an end in itself, I
could love a hundred men, one after the other. Why should I end with a
Skrebensky? Why should I not go on, and love all the types I fancy, one
after another, if love is an end in itself? There are plenty of men who
aren't Anton, whom I could love - whom I would like to love.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you don't love him,&quot; said Dorothy.</p>

<p>&quot;I tell you I do; - quite as much, and perhaps more than I should love
any of the others. Only there are plenty of things that aren't in Anton
that I would love in the other men.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What, for instance?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It doesn't matter. But a sort of strong understanding, in some men,
and then a dignity, a directness, something unquestioned that there is
in working men, and then a jolly, reckless passionateness that you
see - a man who could really let go -  - &quot;</p>

<p>Dorothy could feel that Ursula was already hankering after something
else, something that this man did not give her.</p>

<p>&quot;The question is, what do you want,&quot; propounded Dorothy. &quot;Is it just
other men?&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula was silenced. This was her own dread. Was she just promiscuous?</p>

<p>&quot;Because if it is,&quot; continued Dorothy, &quot;you'd better marry Anton. The
other can only end badly.&quot;</p>

<p>So out of fear of herself Ursula was to marry Skrebensky.</p>

<p>He was very busy now, preparing to go to India. He must visit relatives
and contract business. He was almost sure of Ursula now. She seemed to
have given in. And he seemed to become again an important, self-assured
man.</p>

<p>It was the first week in August, and he was one of a large party in a
bungalow on the Lincolnshire coast. It was a tennis, golf, motor-car,
motor-boat party, given by his great-aunt, a lady of social
pretensions. Ursula was invited to spend the week with the party.</p>

<p>She went rather reluctantly. Her marriage was more or less fixed for
the twenty-eighth of the month. They were to sail for India on
September the fifth. One thing she knew, in her subconsciousness, and
that was, she would never sail for India.</p>

<p>She and Anton, being important guests on account of the coming
marriage, had rooms in the large bungalow. It was a big place, with a
great central hall, two smaller writing-rooms, and then two corridors
from which opened eight or nine bedrooms. Skrebensky was put on one
corridor, Ursula on the other. They felt very lost, in the crowd.</p>

<p>Being lovers, however, they were allowed to be out alone together as
much as they liked. Yet she felt very strange, in this crowd of strange
people, uneasy, as if she had no privacy. She was not used to these
homogeneous crowds. She was afraid.</p>

<p>She felt different from the rest of them, with their hard, easy,
shallow intimacy, that seemed to cost them so little. She felt she was
not pronounced enough. It was a kind of hold-your-own unconventional
atmosphere.</p>

<p>She did not like it. In crowds, in assemblies of people, she liked
formality. She felt she did not produce the right effect. She was not
effective: she was not beautiful: she was nothing. Even before
Skrebensky she felt unimportant, almost inferior. He could take his
part very well with the rest.</p>

<p>He and she went out into the night. There was a moon behind clouds,
shedding a diffused light, gleaming now and again in bits of smoky
mother-of-pearl. So they walked together on the wet, ribbed sands near
the sea, hearing the run of the long, heavy waves, that made a ghostly
whiteness and a whisper.</p>

<p>He was sure of himself. As she walked, the soft silk of her dress - she
wore a blue shantung, full-skirted - blew away from the sea and flapped
and clung to her legs. She wished it would not. Everything seemed to
give her away, and she could not rouse herself to deny, she was so
confused.</p>

<p>He would lead her away to a pocket in the sand-hills, secret amid the
grey thorn-bushes and the grey, glassy grass. He held her close against
him, felt all her firm, unutterably desirable mould of body through the
fine fibre of the silk that fell about her limbs. The silk, slipping
fierily on the hidden, yet revealed roundness and firmness of her body,
her loins, seemed to run in him like fire, make his brain burn like
brimstone. She liked it, the electric fire of the silk under his hands
upon her limbs, the fire flew over her, as he drew nearer and nearer to
discovery. She vibrated like a jet of electric, firm fluid in response.
Yet she did not feel beautiful. All the time, she felt she was not
beautiful to him, only exciting. She let him take her, and he seemed
mad, mad with excited passion. But she, as she lay afterwards on the
cold, soft sand, looking up at the blotted, faintly luminous sky, felt
that she was as cold now as she had been before. Yet he, breathing
heavily, seemed almost savagely satisfied. He seemed revenged.</p>

<p>A little wind wafted the sea grass and passed over her face. Where was
the supreme fulfilment she would never enjoy? Why was she so cold, so
unroused, so indifferent?</p>

<p>As they went home, and she saw the many, hateful lights of the
bungalow, of several bungalows in a group, he said softly:</p>

<p>&quot;Don't lock your door.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'd rather, here,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;No, don't. We belong to each other. Don't let us deny it.&quot;</p>

<p>She did not answer. He took her silence for consent.</p>

<p>He shared his room with another man.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose,&quot; he said, &quot;it won't alarm the house if I go across to
happier regions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So long as you don't make a great row going, and don't try the wrong
door,&quot; said the other man, turning in to sleep.</p>

<p>Skrebensky went out in his wide-striped sleeping suit. He crossed the
big dining hall, whose low firelight smelled of cigars and whisky and
coffee, entered the other corridor and found Ursula's room. She was
lying awake, wide-eyed and suffering. She was glad he had come, if only
for consolation. It was consolation to be held in his arms, to feel his
body against hers. Yet how foreign his arms and body were! Yet still,
not so horribly foreign and hostile as the rest of the house felt to
her.</p>

<p>She did not know how she suffered in this house. She was healthy and
exorbitantly full of interest. So she played tennis and learned golf,
she rowed out and swam in the deep sea, and enjoyed it very much
indeed, full of zest. Yet all the time, among those others, she felt
shocked and wincing, as if her violently-sensitive nakedness were
exposed to the hard, brutal, material impact of the rest of the people.</p>

<p>The days went by unmarked, in a full, almost strenuous enjoyment of
one's own physique. Skrebensky was one among the others, till evening
came, and he took her for himself. She was allowed a great deal of
freedom and was treated with a good deal of respect, as a girl on the
eve of marriage, about to depart for another continent.</p>

<p>The trouble began at evening. Then a yearning for something unknown
came over her, a passion for something she knew not what. She would
walk the foreshore alone after dusk, expecting, expecting something, as
if she had gone to a rendezvous. The salt, bitter passion of the sea,
its indifference to the earth, its swinging, definite motion, its
strength, its attack, and its salt burning, seemed to provoke her to a
pitch of madness, tantalizing her with vast suggestions of fulfilment.
And then, for personification, would come Skrebensky, Skrebensky, whom
she knew, whom she was fond of, who was attractive, but whose soul
could not contain her in its waves of strength, nor his breast compel
her in burning, salty passion.</p>

<p>One evening they went out after dinner, across the low golf links to
the dunes and the sea. The sky had small, faint stars, all was still
and faintly dark. They walked together in silence, then ploughed,
labouring, through the heavy loose sand of the gap between the dunes.
They went in silence under the even, faint darkness, in the darker
shadow of the sandhills.</p>

<p>Suddenly, cresting the heavy, sandy pass, Ursula lifted her head, and
shrank back, momentarily frightened. There was a great whiteness
confronting her, the moon was incandescent as a round furnace door, out
of which came the high blast of moonlight, over the seaward half of the
world, a dazzling, terrifying glare of white light. They shrank back
for a moment into shadow, uttering a cry. He felt his chest laid bare,
where the secret was heavily hidden. He felt himself fusing down to
nothingness, like a bead that rapidly disappears in an incandescent
flame.</p>

<p>&quot;How wonderful!&quot; cried Urusla, in low, calling tones. &quot;How wonderful!&quot;</p>

<p>And she went forward, plunging into it. He followed behind. She too
seemed to melt into the glare, towards the moon.</p>

<p>The sands were as ground silver, the sea moved in solid brightness,
coming towards them, and she went to meet the advance of the flashing,
buoyant water. She gave her breast to the moon, her belly to the
flashing, heaving water. He stood behind, encompassed, a shadow ever
dissolving.</p>

<p>She stood on the edge of the water, at the edge of the solid, flashing
body of the sea, and the wave rushed over her feet.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to go,&quot; she cried, in a strong, dominant voice. &quot;I want to go.&quot;</p>

<p>He saw the moonlight on her face, so she was like metal, he heard her
ringing, metallic voice, like the voice of a harpy to him.</p>

<p>She prowled, ranging on the edge of the water like a possessed
creature, and he followed her. He saw the froth of the wave followed by
the hard, bright water swirl over her feet and her ankles, she swung
out her arms, to balance, he expected every moment to see her walk into
the sea, dressed as she was, and be carried swimming out.</p>

<p>But she turned, she walked to him.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to go,&quot; she cried again, in the high, hard voice, like the
scream of gulls.</p>

<p>&quot;Where?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know.&quot;</p>

<p>And she seized hold of his arm, held him fast, as if captive, and
walked him a little way by the edge of the dazzling, dazing water.</p>

<p>Then there in the great flare of light, she clinched hold of him, hard,
as if suddenly she had the strength of destruction, she fastened her
arms round him and tightened him in her grip, whilst her mouth sought
his in a hard, rending, ever-increasing kiss, till his body was
powerless in her grip, his heart melted in fear from the fierce,
beaked, harpy's kiss. The water washed again over their feet, but she
took no notice. She seemed unaware, she seemed to be pressing in her
beaked mouth till she had the heart of him. Then, at last, she drew
away and looked at him - looked at him. He knew what she wanted. He took
her by the hand and led her across the foreshore, back to the
sandhills. She went silently. He felt as if the ordeal of proof was
upon him, for life or death. He led her to a dark hollow.</p>

<p>&quot;No, here,&quot; she said, going out to the slope full under the moonshine.
She lay motionless, with wide-open eyes looking at the moon. He came
direct to her, without preliminaries. She held him pinned down at the
chest, awful. The fight, the struggle for consummation was terrible. It
lasted till it was agony to his soul, till he succumbed, till he gave
way as if dead, lay with his face buried, partly in her hair, partly in
the sand, motionless, as if he would be motionless now for ever, hidden
away in the dark, buried, only buried, he only wanted to be buried in
the goodly darkness, only that, and no more.</p>

<p>He seemed to swoon. It was a long time before he came to himself. He
was aware of an unusual motion of her breast. He looked up. Her face
lay like an image in the moonlight, the eyes wide open, rigid. But out
of the eyes, slowly, there rolled a tear, that glittered in the
moonlight as it ran down her cheek.</p>

<p>He felt as if as the knife were being pushed into his already dead
body. With head strained back, he watched, drawn tense, for some
minutes, watched the unaltering, rigid face like metal in the
moonlight, the fixed, unseeing eye, in which slowly the water gathered,
shook with glittering moonlight, then surcharged, brimmed over and ran
trickling, a tear with its burden of moonlight, into the darkness, to
fall in the sand.</p>

<p>He drew gradually away as if afraid, drew away - she did not move. He
glanced at her - she lay the same. Could he break away? He turned, saw
the open foreshore, clear in front of him, and he plunged away, on and
on, ever farther from the horrible figure that lay stretched in the
moonlight on the sands with the tears gathering and travelling on the
motionless, eternal face.</p>

<p>He felt, if ever he must see her again, his bones must be broken, his
body crushed, obliterated for ever. And as yet, he had the love of his
own living body. He wandered on a long, long way, till his brain drew
dark and he was unconscious with weariness. Then he curled in the
deepest darkness he could find, under the sea-grass, and lay there
without consciousness.</p>

<p>She broke from her tense cramp of agony gradually, though each movement
was a goad of heavy pain. Gradually, she lifted her dead body from the
sands, and rose at last. There was now no moon for her, no sea. All had
passed away. She trailed her dead body to the house, to her room, where
she lay down inert.</p>

<p>Morning brought her a new access of superficial life. But all within
her was cold, dead, inert. Skrebensky appeared at breakfast. He was
white and obliterated. They did not look at each other nor speak to
each other. Apart from the ordinary, trivial talk of civil people, they
were separate, they did not speak of what was between them during the
remaining two days of their stay. They were like two dead people who
dare not recognise, dare not see each other.</p>

<p>Then she packed her bag and put on her things. There were several
guests leaving together, for the same train. He would have no
opportunity to speak to her.</p>

<p>He tapped at her bedroom door at the last minute. She stood with her
umbrella in her hand. He closed the door. He did not know what to say.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you done with me?&quot; he asked her at length, lifting his head.</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't me,&quot; she said. &quot;You have done with me - we have done with each
other.&quot;</p>

<p>He looked at her, at the closed face, which he thought so cruel. And he
knew he could never touch her again. His will was broken, he was
seared, but he clung to the life of his body.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what have I done?&quot; he asked, in a rather querulous voice.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; she said, in the same dull, feelingless voice. &quot;It is
finished. It had been a failure.&quot;</p>

<p>He was silent. The words still burned his bowels.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it my fault?&quot; he said, looking up at length, challenging the last
stroke.</p>

<p>&quot;You couldn't -  - &quot; she began. But she broke down.</p>

<p>He turned away, afraid to hear more. She began to gather her bag, her
handkerchief, her umbrella. She must be gone now. He was waiting for
her to be gone.</p>

<p>At length the carriage came and she drove away with the rest. When she
was out of sight, a great relief came over him, a pleasant banality. In
an instant, everything was obliterated. He was childishly amiable and
companionable all the day long. He was astonished that life could be so
nice. It was better than it had been before. What a simple thing it was
to be rid of her! How friendly and simple everything felt to him. What
false thing had she been forcing on him?</p>

<p>But at night he dared not be alone. His room-mate had gone, and the
hours of darkness were an agony to him. He watched the window in
suffering and terror. When would this horrible darkness be lifted off
him? Setting all his nerves, he endured it. He went to sleep with the
dawn.</p>

<p>He never thought of her. Only his terror of the hours of night grew on
him, obsessed him like a mania. He slept fitfully, with constant
wakings of anguish. The fear wore away the core of him.</p>

<p>His plan was to sit up very late: drink in company until one or
half-past one in the morning; then he would get three hours of sleep,
of oblivion. It was light by five o'clock. But he was shocked almost to
madness if he opened his eyes on the darkness.</p>

<p>In the daytime he was all right, always occupied with the thing of the
moment, adhering to the trivial present, which seemed to him ample and
satisfying. No matter how little and futile his occupations were, he
gave himself to them entirely, and felt normal and fulfilled. He was
always active, cheerful, gay, charming, trivial. Only he dreaded the
darkness and silence of his own bedroom, when the darkness should
challenge him upon his own soul. That he could not bear, as he could
not bear to think about Ursula. He had no soul, no background. He never
thought of Ursula, not once, he gave her no sign. She was the darkness,
the challenge, the horror. He turned to immediate things. He wanted to
marry quickly, to screen himself from the darkness, the challenge of
his own soul. He would marry his Colonel's daughter. Quickly, without
hesitation, pursued by his obsession for activity, he wrote to this
girl, telling her his engagement was broken - it had been a temporary
infatuation which he less than any one else could understand now it was
over - and could he see his very dear friend soon? He would not be happy
till he had an answer.</p>

<p>He received a rather surprised reply from the girl, but she would be
glad to see him. She was living with her aunt. He went down to her at
once, and proposed to her the first evening. He was accepted. The
marriage took place quietly within fourteen days' time. Ursula was not
notified of the event. In another week, Skrebensky sailed with his new
wife to India.</p>
