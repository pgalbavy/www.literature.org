<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The smoke-house attached to the Perkinpine mansion, as we have
already said, was made of bricks, and was a strong, massive structure.
Although originally used for a building in which meat was cured,
it had been adapted to the purposes of a milk store-house. A stream
of water ran through one side and the milk and fresh meats were
kept there so long as it was possible during the summer weather.</p>

<p>A supply of mutton and lamb had been placed in it the evening
before by Michael, the hired man, a portion for the use of the
ladies and a portion for himself, when he should come to take
it away in the morning.</p>

<p>There had never been an ice-house on the property, that luxury
having been much less known a half a century ago than it is to-day.</p>

<p>The lion, in snuffing around the premises, had scented this store-house
of meat, and was feasting himself upon it when detected by Fred
Sheldon, who, with very little hesitation, covered the couple
of rods necessary to reach it.</p>

<p>It is difficult to comprehend the trying nature of such a venture,
but the reward was a gigantic one in the eyes of Fred, who was
very hopeful also of the chance being favorable for capturing
the animal.</p>

<p>Having started he did not dare to turn back, but hastened forward
on tip-toe, and with a firm hand caught the latch of the door.
The instant he did so the latter was closed and fastened.</p>

<p>He expected the lion would make a plunge against it, and break
out. Having done all he could to secure him, Fred scurried back
through the kitchen door, which he nervously closed after him,
and then scampered in such haste to his room that he feared he
had awakened the two ladies in the other part of the house.</p>

<p>Hurrying to the window, the lad looked anxiously out and down
upon the smoke-house as it was called.</p>

<p>To his delight he saw nothing different in its appearance from
what it was when he left it a few moments before.</p>

<p>It followed, therefore, that the lion was within, as indeed was
proven by the sounds which reached the ears of the listening lad.</p>

<p>But was the little structure strong enough to hold him? When
he broke through his own cage with such ease, would he find any
difficulty in making his way out of this place?</p>

<p>These were the questions our hero asked himself, and which he
could not answer as he wished.</p>

<p>While the walls of the little building were strong and secure,
yet the door was an ordinary one of wood, fastened by a common
iron latch and catch, supplemented by a padlock whenever Michael
Heyland chose to take the trouble; but the door was as secure
against the animal within with the simple latch in place as it
was with the addition of the lock, for it was not to be expected
that he would attempt to force his way out in any manner other
than by flinging himself against the door itself whenever he should
become tired of his restraint.</p>

<p>After a while all became still within the smoke-house, and it
must have been that the unconscious captive, having gorged himself,
had lain down for a good sleep.</p>

<p>Fred Sheldon was all excitement and hope, for he felt that if
the creature could be kept well supplied with food, he was likely
to remain content with his quarters for a considerable time.</p>

<p>Tired and worn out, the boy finally lay down on his bed and slept
till morning. The moment his eyes were open, he arose and looked
out. The smoke-house showed no signs of disturbance, the door
remaining latched as it was the night before.</p>

<p>"He's there yet," exclaimed the delighted boy, hurriedly donning
his clothes and going down the stairs in three jumps.</p>

<p>He was right in his guess, for when he cautiously peeped through
the slats of the window he saw the monster stretched out upon
the floor in a sound slumber.</p>

<p>When Fred told the Misses Perkinpine that the lion was fastened
in the smoke-house their alarm passed all bounds. They instantly
withdrew to the uppermost room, where they declared they would
stay until the neighbors should come and kill the creature.</p>

<p>Fred tried to persuade them out of their fears, but it was useless,
and gathering what meat he could in the house he shoved it through
the small window, and then hurried off toward Tottenville.</p>

<p>"The lion has got plenty of food, and there is the little stream
of water running through the smoke-house, so he ought to be content
to stay there for the day."</p>

<p>Jacob Kincade sat on the porch of the Tottenville Hotel, smoking
a cigar and talking with a number of the villagers, who were gathered
around him. Bud Heyland stayed with his folks up the road, and
he had not come down to the village yet.</p>

<p>The talk, as a matter of course was about the lion, which was
believed to be ranging through the country, and playing havoc
with the live stock of the farmers.</p>

<p>Among the listeners were several boys, with open mouths and eyes,
and when Fred joined them no one paid any attention to him.</p>

<p>"As I was saying," observed Mr. Kincade, flinging one of his
legs over the other, and flirting the ashes from his cigar, "the
lion is one of the most valuable in the country. He has a wonderful
history, having killed a number of people before he was captured
in Africa. Colonel Bandman has been offered a large price for
him, which explains why he is so anxious to secure him unhurt."</p>

<p>"What is the reward?" asked one of the bystanders.</p>

<p>"It was originally a hundred dollars, but I've just received
a letter from Colonel Bandman, in which he instructs me to make
the reward two hundred, provided the animal is not injured at
all."</p>

<p>"What does that offer imply?" asked another of the deeply interested
group.</p>

<p>"The only feasible plan, in my judgment, is to construct a large
cage and to lure the lion into that. I have a couple of carpenters
hard at work, but the trouble is the animal has such a good chance
now of getting all the meat he wants that it will be difficult
to get him inside of anything that looks like a cage."</p>

<p>"If he could be got into a place where he could be held secure
until you brought up his own cage, that would be all you would
ask?" continued the speaker, who evidently was forming some plan
of operations in his own mind.</p>

<p>"That is all, sir."</p>

<p>"<em>I've got your lion for you!</em>"</p>

<p>This rather weighty assertion was made by Fred Sheldon, from
his position in the group. An instant hush fell upon all, who
looked wonderingly at the lad, as if uncertain whether they had
heard aright.</p>

<p>Before any comment was made our hero, somewhat flushed in the
face, as he summoned up his courage, added:</p>

<p>"I've got the lion fast, and if you will go with me I will show
you where he is."</p>

<p>Mr. Kincade laughed, as did one or two others. Taking a puff
or two of his cigar, the showman added:</p>

<p>"Run home, sonny, and don't bother us any more."</p>

<p>But in that little party were a number who knew Fred Sheldon
to be an honest and truthful boy. They made inquiries of him,
and when his straightforward answers had been given they told
the showman he could rely on what had been said.</p>

<p>Mr. Kincade thereupon instantly made preparations, the group
swelling to large proportions, as the news spread that the wild
beast had been captured.</p>

<p>The cage of the lion, which had been strongly repaired, was driven
to the front of the hotel; Jake Kincade mounted, took the lines
in hand and started toward the home of the Misses Perkinpine,
the villagers following close beside and after him.</p>

<p>Just as they turned into the short lane leading to the place,
whom should they meet but Bud Heyland in a state of great excitement.</p>

<p>He was seen running and cracking his whip over his head, and
shouting&#11834;</p>

<p>"I've got him! I've got him! I've got the lion!"</p>

<p>The wagon and company halted for him to explain.</p>

<p>"I've got him up here in the old maids' smoke-house. I put some
meat in there last night, for I seen tracks that showed me he
had been prowling around, and this morning when me and the old
man went over to look there he was! I'll take that reward, Jacob,
if you please."</p>

<p>And the boy grinned and ejected a mouthful of tobacco juice,
while the others turned inquiringly toward Fred Sheldon, whose
cheeks burned with indignation.</p>

<p>"He tells a falsehood," said Fred. "He never knew a thing about
it till this morning."</p>

<p>"I didn't, eh?" shouted Bud. "I'll show you!"</p>

<p>Thereupon he raised his whip, but Mr. Emery stepped in front
and said, calmly:</p>

<p>"Bud, it won't be well for you to strike that boy."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want anybody telling me I don't tell the truth,
for I'm square in everything I do, and I won't be insulted."</p>

<p>Mr. Kincade was on the point of taking the word of Bud Heyland
that the reward had been earned by him, when he saw from the disposition
of the crowd that it would not permit any such injustice as that.</p>

<p>"If you've got the animal secure I'm satisfied," called out the
showman from his seat, as he assumed an easy, lolling attitude.
"You two chaps and the crowd can settle the question of who's
entitled to the reward between you, and I only ask that you don't
be too long about it, for the critter may get hungry and eat his
way out."</p>

<p>Mr. Emery, at the suggestion of several, took charge of the investigation.</p>

<p>Turning to Fred he said: "The people here have heard your story,
and Bud can now tell his."</p>

<p>"Why, I hain't got much to tell," said the big boy, in his swaggering
manner. "As I said awhile ago, I seen signs around the place last
night which showed the lion was sneaking about the premises. He
likes to eat good little boys, and I s'pose he was looking for
Freddy there," said young Heyland, with a grinning leer at our
hero, which brought a smile to several faces.</p>

<p>"So I didn't say anything to the old man but just flung a lot
of meat in the smoke-house and went home to sleep. This morning
the old man awoke afore I did, which ain't often the case, and
going over to his work found the trap had been sprung and the
game was there.</p>

<p>"The old man (Bud seemed to be proud of calling his father by
that disrespectful name) came running home and pitched through
the door as white as a ghost, and it was a minute or two before
he could tell his story. When he had let it out and the old woman
begun to shiver, why I laughed, and told 'em how I'd set the trap
and earned the reward. With that the old man cooled down, and
I got him back with me to look at the beast, which is still asleep,
and then I started to tell you about it, Jake, when I meets this
crowd and hears with pain and surprise the awful whopper this
good little boy tells. I believe he slept in the house there last
night, and when he woke up and went out in the smoke-house to
steal a drink of milk and seen the lion, he was so scared that
he nearly broke his neck running down to the village to tell about
it."</p>

<p>This fiction was told so well that several looked at Fred to
see what he had to say.</p>

<p>The lad, still flushed in the face, stepped forward and said:</p>

<p>"I'd like to ask Bud a question or two."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Fred addressed Mr. Emery, and then turned toward
the grinning bully, who said:</p>

<p>"Go ahead with all you're a mind to."</p>

<p>"You say you put the meat in there on purpose to catch the lion
last night?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I done, Freddy, my boy."</p>

<p>"Where did you get the meat?"</p>

<p>"At home of the old woman."</p>

<p>"After you put it in the smoke-house, you didn't go back until
this morning?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; my little Sunday school lad."</p>

<p>"Who, then, shut and fastened the door, after the lion walked
in the smoke-house to eat the meat?"</p>

<p>Bud Heyland's face flushed still redder, and he coughed, swallowed
and stuttered&#11834;</p>

<p>"Who shut the door? Why&mdash;that is&mdash;yes&mdash;why what's the use of
asking such infarnal questions?" demanded Bud in desperation,
as the listeners broke into laughter.</p>

<p>Mr. Emery quietly turned to Kincade, who was leaning back on
his elevated seat and said:</p>

<p>"The reward of two hundred dollars belongs to Master Fred here,"
and the decision was received with shouts of approbation.</p>

<p>Bud Heyland's eyes flashed with indignation, and he muttered
to himself; but, in the face of such a number, he dared not protest,
and he followed them as they pushed on toward the little structure
where the escaped beast was restrained of his liberty.</p>

<p>A reconnoissance showed that he was still there, and the arrangements
for his transfer were speedily made and carried out with much
less difficulty than would have been supposed.</p>

<p>The cage was placed in front of the door of the smoke-house,
communication being opened, after an inclined plane was so arranged
that the beast could not walk out without going directly into
his old quarters.</p>

<p>Several pounds of raw, bleeding meat were placed in the cage,
and then the animal was stirred up with a long pole.</p>

<p>He growled several times, got on his feet, looked about as if
a little confused, and then seemed to be pleased at the familiar
sight of his old home, for he walked deliberately up the inclined
plane into the cage, and lay down as if to complete his nap, so
rudely broken a few minutes before. The door was quickly closed
and fastened, and the escaped lion was recaptured!</p>

<p>When all saw how easily it was done, and recalled the fact that
the king of beasts, so far as was known, had injured no person
at all, there was a great deal of inquiry for the explanation.</p>

<p>Why was it that, with such opportunities for destroying human
life, he had failed to rend any one to fragments?</p>

<p>Jacob Kincade, after some laughter, stated that the lion, although
once an animal of tiger-like ferocity and strength, was now so
old that he was comparatively harmless. His teeth were poor, as
was shown by the little progress he had made with the bony meat
in the smoke-house. If driven into a corner he might make a fight,
but if he had been loose for a month it was hardly likely he would
have killed anybody.</p>

<p>The blow which he received in the eye from Bud Heyland's whip
incited him to fury for the moment, but by the time he got fairly
outside he was comparatively harmless, and the hurried climbing
of the center-pole by Bud Heyland was altogether a piece of superfluity.</p>

<p>As Fred Sheldon had fairly earned the two hundred dollars, he
was told to call at the hotel in Tottenville that afternoon and
it would be paid him.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to say that he was there punctually, for
the sum was a fortune in his eyes.</p>

<p>As he came to the porch a number of loungers were there as usual,
and Fred found himself quite a hero among his playmates and fellows.</p>

<p>Not only was Jake Kincade present, with his cigar alternately
between his finger and lips, but Bud Heyland and a stranger were
sitting on the bench which ran along the porch, their legs crossed,
one smoking his briar-wood and the other a cigar.</p>

<p>Despite Fred's agitation over his own prospects, he could not
help noticing this stranger whom, he believed, he had never seen
before.</p>

<p>His dress and appearance were much like those of a cattle drover.
He wore a large, gray sombrero, a blue flannel shirt, had no suspenders,
coarse corduroy trousers, though the weather was warm, with the
legs tucked in the tops of his huge cowhide boots, the front of
which reached far above his knees, like those of a cavalryman.</p>

<p>He had frowsy, abundant hair, a smoothly-shaven face&mdash;that is,
the stubby beard was no more than two or three days old&mdash;and he
seemed to be between twenty-five and thirty years of age.</p>

<p>Looking at his rather regular features, it would be hard to tell
whether he was a good or evil man, but it was very evident that
he and Bud Heyland had struck up a strong intimacy, which was
growing.</p>

<p>They sat close together, chatted and laughed, and indulged in
jokes at the expense of those around them, careless alike of the
feelings that were hurt or the resentment engendered.</p>

<p>As Fred approached he saw Bud turn his head and speak to the
stranger, who instantly centered his gaze on the boy, so there
could be no doubt that his attention was called to him.</p>

<p>Fred was moving rather timidly toward Kincade, when the stranger
raised his hand and crooked his finger toward him. Wondering what
he could want, Fred Sheldon diverged toward him and took off his
hat.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't stand bareheaded, Freddy, dear," said Bud, with his
old grin; "you might catch cold in your brains."</p>

<p>Neither of the others noticed this course remark, and the stranger,
scrutinizing the boy with great interest, said:</p>

<p>"What is your name, please?"</p>

<p>"Frederick Sheldon."</p>

<p>"And you are the boy who locked the lion in the smoke-house last
night when you heard the poor fellow trying to use his aged teeth
on some bones?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, you deserve credit; for you thought, like everybody else,
that he was as fierce as he was a dozen years ago. Well, all I
want to say, Fred, is that I'm Cyrus Sutton, stopping here at
the hotel, and I'm somewhat interested in cattle. Bud, here, doesn't
feel very well, and he's got leave of absence for two or three
days and is going to stay at home. Bud and I are strong friends,
and I've formed a rather good opinion of you and I congratulate
you on having earned such a respectable pile of money. Mr. Kincade
is ready and glad to pay you."</p>

<p>Squire Jones, a plain, honest, old man, who had been justice
of the peace for fully two score years, went into the inner room
with Fred Sheldon and Jacob Kincade to see that everything was
in proper shape; for as the boy was a minor his rights needed
careful protection.</p>

<p>All was done deliberately and carefully, and the entire amount
of money, in good, crisp greenbacks, was placed in the trembling
hands of Fred Sheldon, who felt just then as though he would buy
up the entire village of Tottenville, and present it to his poor
friends.</p>

<p>"Come over to my office with me," said the squire, when the transaction
was finished.</p>

<p>The lad willingly walked across the street and into the dingy
quarters of the old man, who closed the door and said:</p>

<p>"I am real glad, Frederick, that you have earned such a sum of
money, for your mother needs it, and I know you to be a truthful
and honest boy; but let me ask you what you mean to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Save it."</p>

<p>"I know, but how and where? It will not be safe in your house
nor at the Misses Perkinpines', as the events of the other night
prove. It ought to be placed somewhere where it will be safe."</p>

<p>"Tell me where to put it."</p>

<p>"There is the Lynton Bank ten miles away, but you couldn't drive
there before it would be closed. I have a good, strong, burglar-proof
safe, in which I have many valuable papers. If you wish it, I
will seal the money in a large envelope, write your name on the
back and lock it up for you. Then, whenever you want it, I will
turn it over to you."</p>

<p>Fred replied that he would be glad to have him do as proposed,
and the old squire, with solemn deliberation, went through the
ceremony of placing the two hundred dollars safely among his other
papers and swinging the ponderous safe-door upon them.</p>

<p>Fred would have liked to keep the money to look at and admire
and show to his playmates, but he saw how much wiser the course
of the squire was, and it was a great relief to the boy to have
the custody of such riches in other hands.</p>

<p>When he came out on the street again he looked across to the
hotel and noticed that Bud Heyland and Cyrus Sutton were no longer
visible. He supposed they were inside visiting the bar, and without
giving them any further thought, Fred started for his home to
complete his chores before going over to stay with the Misses
Perkinpine.</p>

<p>After reaching a certain point up the road a short cut was almost
always used by Fred, who followed quite a well-beaten path through
a long stretch of woods.</p>

<p>The boy was in high spirits, for he could not feel otherwise
after the wonderful success which had attended his efforts to
capture the astray lion.</p>

<p>"If I could only get on the track of the men that stole the silverware
and money, why, I would retire wealthy," he said to himself, with
a smile; "but I don't see where there is much chance&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Halloo, there, Freddy dear!"</p>

<p>It was Bud Heyland who hailed the startled youngster in this
fashion, and when our hero stopped and looked up, he saw the bully
standing before him, whip in hand and waiting for him to approach.</p>
