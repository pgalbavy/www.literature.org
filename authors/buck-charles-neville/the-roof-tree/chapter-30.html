<p>Sim Squires was finding himself in a most intricate and perplexing maze
of circumstance; the situation of the man who wears another man's collar
and whose vassalage galls almost beyond endurance.
</p>
<p>It was dawning on Squires that he was involved in a web of such
criss-cross meshes that before long he might find no way out. He had
been induced to waylay Parish Thornton at the demand of one whom he
dared not incense on pain of exposures that would send him to the
penitentiary.
</p><p>His intended victim had not only failed to die but had grown to an
influence in the neighbourhood that made him a most dangerous enemy; and
to become, in fact, such an enemy to Sim he needed only to learn the
truth as to who had fired that shot.
</p><p>Squires had come as Rowlett's spy into that house, hating Thornton with
a sincerity bred of fear, but now he had grown to hate Rowlett the more
bitterly of the two. Indeed, save for that sword of Damocles which hung
over him in the memory of his murderous employment and its possible
consequences, he would have liked Parish, and Dorothy's kindness had
awakened in the jackal's heart a bewildering sense of gratitude such as
he had never known before.
</p><p>So while compulsion still bound him to Bas Rowlett, his own sympathies
were beginning to lean toward the fortunes of that household from which
he drew his legitimate wage.
</p><p>But complications stood irrevocably between Sim and his inclinations.
His feeling against Bas Rowlett was becoming an obsession of venom fed
by the overweening arrogance of the man, but Bas still held him in the
hollow of his hand, and besides these reefs of menace were yet other
shoals to be navigated.
</p><p>Squires had been compelled by Rowlett not only to join the "riders" who
were growing in numbers and covert power, but to take such an active
part in their proceedings as would draw down upon his head the bolts of
wrath should the organization ever be brought to an accounting.
</p><p>There was terrible danger there and Sim recognized it. Sim knew that
when Rowlett had quietly stirred into life the forces from which the
secret body was born he had been building for one purpose--and one
purpose only. To its own membership, the riders might be a body of
vigilantes with divers intentions, but to Bas they were never anything
but a mob which should some day lynch Parish Thornton--and then be
themselves destroyed like the bee that dies when it stings. Through
Squires as the unwilling instrument Rowlett was possessing himself of
such evidence as would undo the leaders when the organization had served
that one purpose.
</p><p>Yet Sim dared reveal none of these secrets. The active personality who
was the head and front of the riders was Sam Opdyke's friend Rick
Joyce--and Rick Joyce was the man to whom Bas could whisper the facts
that had first given him power over Sim.
</p><p>For Sim had shot to death Rick's nephew, and though he had done it while
drunk and half responsible; though he had been incited to the deed by
Bas himself, no man save the two of them knew that, and so far the
murderer had never been discovered.
</p><p>It seemed to Sim that any way he turned his face he encountered a
cul-de-sac of mortal danger--and it left him in a perplexity that
fretted him and edged his nerves to rawness.
</p><p>Part of Christmas day was spent by the henchman in the cabin where he
had been accustomed to holding his secret councils with his master, Bas
Rowlett, and his venom for the man who had used him as a shameless pawn
was eclipsing his hatred for Parish Thornton, the intended victim whom
he was paid to shadow and spy upon. For Dorothy he had come to
acknowledge a dumb worship, and this sentiment was not the adoration of
a lover but that dog-like affection which reacts to kindness where there
has been no other kindness in life.
</p><p>It was not in keeping with such a character that he should attempt any
candid repudiation of his long-worn yoke, or declare any spirit of
conversion, but in him was a ferment of panic.
</p><p>"I'm growin' right restive, Bas," whined Sim as the two shivered and
drank whiskey to keep themselves warm in that abandoned shack where they
were never so incautious as to light a fire. "Any time this feller
Parish finds out I shot him, he'll turn on me an' kill me. Thar hain't
but jest one safe way out. Let me finish up ther job an' rest easy."
</p><p>Bas Rowlett shook his head decisively.
</p><p>"When I gits ready ter hev ye do thet," he ruled, imperiously, "I'll let
ye know. Right now hit's ther last thing I'd countenance."
</p><p>"I kain't no fashion make ye out," complained Sim. "Ye hired me ter do
ther job an' blackguarded me fer failin'. Now ye acks like ye war paid
ter pertect ther feller from peril."
</p><p>Rowlett scowled. It was not his policy to confide in his Myrmidons, yet
with an adherent who knew as much as Squires it was well to have the
confidential seeming.
</p><p>"Things hev changed, Sim," he explained. "Any heedless killin's right
now would bring on a heap of trouble afore I'm ready fer hit--but ye
hain't no more fretful ter hev him die then what I be--an' thet's what
we're buildin' up this hyar night-rider outfit ter do."
</p><p>"Thet's another thing thet disquiets me, though," objected Squires. "I'm
es deep inter thet es anybody else, an' them fellers, Thornton and Old
Hump, hain't nuver goin' ter rest twell they penitensheries some of ther
head men."
</p><p>Bas Rowlett laughed, then with such a confidential manner as he rarely
bestowed upon a subordinate, he laid a hand on his hireling's arm.
"Thet's all right, Sim. Ther penitenshery's a right fit an' becomin'
place fer them men, when ye comes ter study hit out. We hain't objectin'
ter thet ourselves--in due time."
</p><p>Sim Squires drew back and his face became for the moment
terror-stricken. "What does ye mean?" he demanded, tensely, "does ye aim
ter let me sulter out my days in convict-stripes because I've done
s'arved yore eends?"
</p><p>But Bas Rowlett shook his head.
</p><p>"Not you, Sim," he gave assurance. "I'm goin' ter tek keer of <u>you</u> all
right--but when ther rest of 'em hev done what we wants, we hain't got
no further use fer them riders. Atter thet they'll jest be a pest an'
burden ter us ef they goes on terrifyin' everybody."
</p><p>"I don't no fashion comprehend ye, but I've got ter know whar I stands
at." There was a momentary stiffening of the creature's moral backbone
and the employer hastened to smooth away his anxiety.
</p><p>"I hain't nuver drapped no hint of this ter no man afore," he confided,
"but me an' you air actin' tergither es pardners, an' ye've got a
license ter know. These hyar riders air ergoin' ter handle ther men that
stands in my light--then I'm goin' ter everlastin'ly bust up ther
riders. I wouldn't love ter see 'em git too strong. Ye fights a forest
fire by buildin' back-fires, Sim, but ef ye lets ther back-fires burn
too long ye're es bad off es ye war when ye started out."
</p><p>"How does ye aim ter take keer of me?" inquired the listener and Bas
replied promptly: "When ther time comes ter bust 'em up, we'll hev
strength enough ter handle ther matter. Leave thet ter me. You'll be
state's evi_dence_ then an' we'll prove thet ye ji'ned up ter keep watch
fer me."
</p><p>Over Sim Squires' face spread the vapid grin that he used to conceal his
emotions.
</p><p>"But thet all comes later on," enjoined Bas. "Meanwhile, keep preachin'
ter them fellers thet Thornton's buildin' up a case erginst 'em. Keep
'em skeered an' wrought up."
</p><p>"I reckon we'd better not start away tergither," suggested Sim when they
had brought their business to its conclusion, "you go on, Bas, an' I'll
foller d'reckly."
</p><p>When he stood alone in the house Sim spent a half-hour seeking to study
the ramifications of the whole web of intrigue from various angles of
consideration, but before he left the place he acted on a sudden thought
and, groping in the recess between plate-girder and overhang, he drew
out the dust-coated diary that Bas had thrust there and forgotten, long
ago. This Sim put into his pocket and took with him.
</p><hr/>
<p>The winter dragged out its course and broke that year like a glacier
suddenly loosened from its moorings of ice. A warm breath came out of
the south and icicled gorges sounded to the sodden drip of melting
waters. Snowslides moved on hundreds of steeply pitched slopes, and fed
sudden rivulets into freshet roarings.
</p><p>The river itself was no longer a clear ribbon but a turgid flood-tide
that swept along uprooted trees and snags of foam-lathered drift.
</p><p>There was as yet neither bud nor leaf, and the air was raw and
bone-chilling, but everywhere was the restless stirring of dormant life
impulses and uneasy hints of labour-pains.
</p><p>While the river sucked at its mud bank and lapped its inundated
lowlands, the walnut tree in the yard above the high-water mark sang
sagas of rebirth through the night as the wind gave tongue in its naked
branches.
</p><p>But in the breast of Sim Squires this spirit of restlessness was more
than an uneasy stirring. It was an obsession.
</p><p>He knew that when spring, or at the latest early summer, brought
firmness to the mired highways and deeper cover to the woods, the
organization of which he was a prominent member would strike, and stake
its success or failure upon decisive issue. Then Parish Thornton, and a
handful of lesser designates, would die--or else the "riders" would
encounter defeat and see their leaders go to the penitentiary.
</p><p>Bas Rowlett, himself a traitor to the Ku Klux, had promised Sim safety,
but Sim had never known Bas to keep faith, and he did not trust him now.
</p><p>Yet, should he break with the evil forces to which he stood allied,
Sim's peril became only the greater. So he lay awake through these gusty
nights cudgelling his brain for a solution, and at the end, when spring
had come with her first gracious touches of Judas-tree and wild plum
blossoming, he made up his mind.
</p><p>Sim Squires came to his decision one balmy afternoon and went, with a
caution that could not have been greater had he contemplated murder, to
the house of Hump Doane, when he knew the old man to be alone.
</p><p>His design, after all, was a simple one for a man versed in the art of
double-crossing and triple-crossing.
</p><p>If the riders prevailed he was safe enough, by reason of his charter
membership, and none of his brother vigilantes suspected that his
participation had been unwilling. But they might not prevail, and, in
that event, it was well to have a friend among the victors.
</p><p>He meant, therefore, to tell Hump Doane some things that Hump Doane
wished very much to know, but he would go to the confessional under such
oath of secrecy as could not recoil upon him. Then whoever triumphed, be
it Bas, the white-caps, or the forces of law and order, he would have a
protector on the winning side.
</p><p>The hunchback met his furtive visitor at the stile and walked with him
back into the chill woods where they were safe from observation. The
drawn face and the frightened eyes told him in advance that this would
be no ordinary interview, yet he was unprepared for what he heard.
</p><p>When Squires had hinted that he came heavy with tidings of gravest
import, but must be given guarantees of protection before he spoke, Hump
Doane sat reflecting dubiously upon the matter, then he shook his head.
"I don't jest see whar hit profits me ter know things thet I kain't make
no use of," he demurred, and Sim Squires bent forward with haunted eyes.
</p><p>"They're <u>facts</u>," he protested. "Ye kin use them facts, only ye mustn't
tell no man whar ye got 'em from."
</p><p>"Go ahead, then," decided Hump Doane after weighing the proposition even
further. "I'm hearkenin', an' I stands pledged ter hold my counsel es
ter yore part in tellin' me."
</p><p>The sun was sinking toward the horizon and the woods were cold. The
informer rose and walked back and forth on the soggy carpet of rotted
leaves with hands that clasped and unclasped themselves at his back. He
was under a stress of feeling that bordered on collapse.
</p><p>The dog that has been kicked and knocked about from puppyhood has in it
the accumulated viciousness of his long injuries. Such a beast is ready
to run amuck, frothing at the mouth, and Sim Squires was not unlike that
dog. He had debated this step through days and nights of hate and
terror. He had faltered and vacillated. Now he had come, and the
long-repressed passions had broken all his dams of reserve, transforming
him, as if with an epilepsy. His eyes were bloodshot, his cheeks were
putty-yellow and, had he been a dog instead of a man, his fangs would
have been slathered with foam.
</p><p>Heretofore he had spoken hesitantly and cautiously. Now like the
epileptic or the mad dog, he burst into a volcanic outpouring in which
wild words tumbled upon themselves in a cataract of boiling abandon. His
fists were clenched and veins stood out on his face.
</p><p>"I'm ther man thet shot Parish Thornton when he fust come hyar," was his
sensational beginning, "but albeit my hand sighted ther gun an' pulled
ther trigger hit was another man's damn dirty heart that contrived ther
act an' another man's dollars thet paid fer hit. I was plum fo'ced ter
do hit by a low-lived feller thet hed done got me whar he wanted me--a
feller thet bull-dozed an' dogged me an' didn't suffer me ter call my
soul my own--a feller thet I hates an' dreads like I don't nuver expect
ter hate Satan in hell!"
</p><p>The informer broke off there and stood a pitiable picture of rage and
cowardice, shaken with tearless sobs of unwonted emotion.
</p><p>"Some men ruins women," he rushed on, "an' some ruins other men. <u>He</u>
done thet ter me--an' whenever I boggled or balked he cracked his whip
anew--an' I wasn't nuthin' but his pore white nigger thet obeyed him. I
ached ter kill him an' I didn't even dast ter contrary him. His name's
Bas Rowlett!"
</p><p>The recital broke off and the speaker stood trembling from head to foot.
Then the hearer who had listened paled to the roots of his shaggy hair
and his gargoyle face became a mask of tragic fury.
</p><p>At first Hump Doane did not trust himself to speak and when he did,
there was a moment in which the other feared him almost more than he
feared Bas Rowlett.
</p><p>For the words of the hunchback came like a roar of thunder and he seemed
on the verge of leaping at his visitor's throat.
</p><p>"Afore God, ye self-confessed, murderin' liar," he bellowed, "don't seek
ter accuse Bas Rowlett ter me in no sich perjury! He's my kinsman an' my
friend--an' I knows ye lies. Ef ye ever lets words like them cross yore
lips ergin in my hearin' I'll t'ar ther tongue outen yore mouth with
these two hands of mine!"
</p><p>For a space they stood there in silence, the old man glaring, the
younger slowly coming back from his mania of emotion as from a trance.
</p><p>Perhaps had Sim sought to insist on his story he would never have been
allowed to finish it, but in that little interval of pause Hump Doane's
passion also passed, as passions too violent to endure must pass.
</p><p>After the first unsuspected shock, it was borne in on him that there are
confessions which may not be doubted, and that of them this was one. His
mind began to reaccommodate itself, and after a little he said in a
voice of deadly coldness:
</p><p>"Howsoever, now thet ye've started, go on. I'll hear ye out."
</p><p>"I'm tellin' ye gospel truth, an' sometimes ther truth hurts," insisted
Sim. "Bas war jealous of Dorothy Harper--an' I didn't dast ter deny
him. He paid me a patch of river-bottom land fer ther job, albeit I
failed."
</p><p>Hump Doane stood, his ugly face seamed with a scowl of incredulous
sternness, his hand twitching at the ends of his long and gorilla-like
arms. "Go on," he reiterated, "don't keep me waitin'."
</p><p>Under the evening sky, standing rigid with emotion, Squires doggedly
went on. He told, abating nothing, the whole wretched story from his own
knowledge: how Bas had sought to bring on the war afresh in order that
his enemy Parish Thornton might perish in its flaming; how with the same
end in view Bas had shot at Old Jim; how he himself had been sent to
trail Thornton to Virginia that his master might inform upon him, and
how while the Virginian was away, in jeopardy of his life, the
arch-conspirator had pursued his wife, until she, being afraid to tell
her husband, had come near killing the tormentor herself.
</p><p>"Hit war Bas thet stirred up ther riders into formin'," declared the spy
in conclusion. "He didn't nuver take no part hisself, but he used two
men thet didn't dast disobey him--two men thet he rules over like nigger
slaves--an' ther riders hev got one object over an' above everything
else, thet he aims ter hev 'em carry through. Thet is ter kill Parish
Thornton."
</p><p>Hump Doane walked over and stood looking up from his squat, toad-like
deformity into the face of the man who towered above him, yet in his
eyes was the blaze with which a giant might look down on a pigmy.
</p><p>"Ye says he used two men, Sim," the falsetto of the hunchback's voice
was as sharp as a dagger's point. "Ef ye came hyar fer any honest
purpose, I calls on ye, now, ter give me them two names."
</p><p>Squires' face turned even paler than it had been. The veins along his
temple were pulsing, and his words caught and hung in hesitancy; but he
gulped and said in a forced voice: "I was one of 'em, Hump."
</p><p>"An' t'other one? Who war he?"
</p><p>Again the informer hesitated, this time longer than before, but in the
end he said dully:
</p><p>"Hump, t'other one war--yore own boy, Pete."
