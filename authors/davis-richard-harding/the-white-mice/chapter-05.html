<p>"I can be quite as foolish as you," Inez repeated as Roddy continued
to regard her. "Some day, when this is over, when you have made it all
come right, we will sit out here and pretend that we have escaped from
Venezuela, that we are up North in my mother's country--in your
country. We will play these are the rocks at York Harbor, and we'll be
quite young and quite happy. Have you ever sat on the rocks at York
Harbor," she demanded eagerly, "when the spray splashed you, and the
waves tried to catch your feet?"
</p><p>Roddy was regarding her in open suspicion. He retreated warily.
</p><p>"York Harbor!" he murmured. "I discovered it! It is named after me.
But you! I never imagined you'd been there, and I never imagined you
could be anything but serious, either. It makes you quite dangerous."
</p><p>"Dangerous?" murmured the girl.
</p><p>"One is dangerous," said Roddy, "when one is completely charming."
</p><p>The girl frowned, and her shoulders moved slightly. "You speak," she
said, "like a Venezuelan."
</p><p>But Roddy was in no mood to accept reproof.
</p><p>"I told you," he said, "I admire the fools who rush in where angels
fear to tread. There is another man I admire equally, 'the man who
runs away.' It takes great courage to run away. I must do it now."
</p><p>He retreated from her. His eyes were filled with a sudden, deep
delight in her, and a growing wonder. The girl regarded him steadily.
</p><p>"Come here," she commanded, "and say 'Good-by' to me."
</p><p>Roddy took the slim, gauntleted hand stretched out to him, and for an
instant the girl held his hand firmly, and then nodded. The smile this
time was very near to tears.
</p><p>"What you are going to do," she said, "is the dangerous thing. You
don't know how dangerous. If I should not see you again----"
</p><p>Roddy looked down into her eyes, and laughed from utter happiness.
</p><p>"You will see <u>me</u> again," he said.
</p><p>His tone gave to the words a meaning which the girl entirely
disregarded.
</p><p>"You will remember," she went on, as though he had not spoken, "that
we--that I am grateful."
</p><p>Roddy turned and smiled out at the sunlit sea.
</p><p>"You have given me," he answered, "other things to remember."
</p><p>He pulled off his sombrero and took the gauntleted hand in both of
his. He bowed over it and brushed it with his lips. The girl still
regarded him steadily, questioningly.
</p><p>"Good-by," faltered Roddy.
</p><p>His eyes sought hers wistfully, appealingly, with all that he felt
showing in them. But her own told him nothing. Roddy released her hand
with an effort, as though it were bound to his with manacles.
</p><p>"Now I know," he said gently, "why I came to Venezuela."
</p><p>The girl made no answer, and silently Roddy mounted and rode away.
When he had reached the place where the rocks would hide her from
sight he glanced back. He saw Inez standing beside her pony, leaning
with her arms across the saddle, looking after him. Then, as he waved
his hand, she raised hers with a gesture that seemed to Roddy partly a
farewell, partly a benediction.
</p><p>The stable at which Roddy had told Pedro he would leave the pony was
far in the suburbs, and by the time he had walked to Willemstad the
morning was well advanced.
</p><p>[Illustration: "Now I know why I came to Venezuela!"]
</p><p>As he approached the quay he recognized that in his absence some event
of unusual interest had claimed the attention of the people.
Everywhere men were gathered in little groups, gesticulating,
laughing, frowning importantly, and at the hotel Roddy was surprised
to see, on the balcony leading from his room, Peter and the American
Consul. The sight of him apparently afforded them great satisfaction,
and they waved and beckoned to him frantically. Ignoring their last
meeting, the Consul greeted Roddy as though he were an old friend.
</p><p>"Have you heard the news?" he demanded. "It is of great local
interest, and it should interest you. Last night," he explained,
"President Alvarez declared an amnesty for his political opponents
living in foreign countries. All exiles may now return to their
homes."
</p><p>He pointed at the small passenger steamer lying at the quay directly
below the window. The <u>Blue Peter</u> was at the fore, and her deck was
crowded with excited, jubilant Venezuelans.
</p><p>"You see," explained Captain Codman, "they have lost no time."
</p><p>In a tone that precluded the possibility of discussion, Peter briskly
added: "And <u>we</u> are going with them. I have packed your bag and paid
the bill. We sail in an hour."
</p><p>The news of the amnesty bewildered Roddy. The wonderful possibilities
it so suddenly presented thrilled him. They were so important that
with difficulty he made his voice appear only politely interested.
</p><p>"And Señora Rojas?" he asked.
</p><p>"I regret to say," answered Captain Codman, "she decides to take
advantage of the amnesty. As soon as she can arrange her affairs here
she will return to Miramar, her home in Porto Cabello."
</p><p>To Miramar! Roddy turned suddenly to the window, and with unseeing
eyes stared at the busy harbor. By sight he knew the former home of
the Rojas family. In his walks he had often passed before its
yellow-pillared front and windows barred with intricate screens of
wrought iron. Through the great gates that had hung before Miramar
since it had been the palace of the Spanish Governor-General, and
through which four horses could pass abreast, he had peered at the
beautiful gardens. He had wondered at the moss-covered statues, at the
orchids on the flamboyant trees, with their flowers of scarlet, at the
rare plants, now neglected and trailing riotously across the paths,
choked with unkempt weeds. Not an hour before, when he had parted from
Inez, he had determined to make sentimental journeys to that same
house. For she had walked in those gardens, it was through those gates
she had swept in her carriage to take the air in the Plaza; at night,
when she slept, some high-ceilinged, iron-barred room of that house
had sheltered her. He had pictured himself prowling outside the empty
mansion and uncared-for garden, thinking of the exile, keeping vigil
in the shadow of her home, freshly resolving to win back her father to
health and freedom.
</p><p>And now, by a scratch of the pen, the best that could happen had come
to him. The house would waken to life. Instead of only the fragrance
clinging to the vase, the rose itself would bloom again. Again Inez
would walk under the arch of royal palms, would drive in the Alameda,
would kneel at Mass in the cool, dark church, while, hidden in the
shadows, he could stand and watch her. And though, if he hoped to save
her father, stealth and subterfuge would still be necessary, he could
see her, perhaps, speak to her; at least by the faithful Pedro he
could send her written words, flowers, foolish gifts, that were worth
only the meaning they carried with them.
</p><p>Feeling very much of a hypocrite, Roddy exclaimed fervently:
</p><p>"How wonderful for Señora Rojas! To be near him again! Is she happy?
Does it make it easier for her?"
</p><p>With a disturbed countenance the Consul nodded gravely.
</p><p>"Yes," he answered, "she welcomed the change. She believes it means
for her husband better conditions. She hopes even for his pardon;
but--" The Consul shook his head impatiently, and with pitying eyes
looked down upon the excited men on the steamer below them.
</p><p>"But what?" demanded Roddy.
</p><p>"I suspect every act of Alvarez," the Consul explained. "This <u>looks</u>
like the act of a generous opponent. But I cannot believe it is that.
I believe he knows all that is being plotted against him. I believe
this act of amnesty is only a device to put the plotters where he can
get his hand on them. He is the spider inviting the flies into his
parlor."
</p><p>As the little steamer passed the harbor mouth and pushed her nose
toward Porto Cabello, Roddy, with Peter at his side, leaned upon the
starboard rail. Roddy had assured Inez that Peter must be given their
full confidence, and he now only waited a fitting moment to tell him
of what had occurred that morning, in so far, at least, as it referred
to the tunnel.
</p><p>The eyes of both were turned toward Casa Blanca, now rapidly
retreating from them. And, as they watched it, the mind of each
occupied with thoughts of its inmates, they saw a white figure leave
the house, and, moving slowly, halt at the edge of the cliff.
</p><p>Roddy, his eyes straining toward the coast-line, took off his hat and
stood with it clasped in his hands. Peter saw the movement, and to
hide a smile of sympathy, looked down at the white foam rushing below
them.
</p><p>"Roddy," he asked, "what sort of a girl is Inez Rojas?"
</p><p>His eyes still seeking the figure on the rocks, and without turning
his head, Roddy answered with startling directness:
</p><p>"What sort of a girl?" he growled. "The sort of a girl _I_ am going to
marry!"
</p><p>More moved than he knew, and thinking himself secure in the excited
babel about him and in the fact that the others spoke in Spanish,
Roddy had raised his voice. He was not conscious he had done so until,
as he spoke, he saw a man leaning on the rail with his back toward
him, give an involuntary start. Furious with himself, Roddy bit his
lip, and with impatience waited for the man to disclose himself. For a
moment the stranger remained motionless, and then, obviously to find
out who had spoken, slowly turned his head. Roddy found himself
looking into the glowing, angry eyes of Pino Vega. Of the two men,
Roddy was the first to recover. With eagerness he greeted the
Venezuelan; with enthusiasm he expressed his pleasure at finding him
among his fellow-passengers, he rejoiced that Colonel Vega no longer
was an exile. The Venezuelan, who had approached trembling with
resentment, sulkily murmured his thanks. With a hope that sounded more
like a threat that they would soon meet again, he begged to be allowed
to rejoin his friends.
</p><p>"Now you've done it!" whispered Peter cheerily. "And he won't let it
rest there, either."
</p><p>"Don't you suppose I know that better than you do," returned Roddy
miserably. He beat the rail with his fist. "It should not have
happened in a thousand years," he wailed. "He must not know I have
ever even seen her."
</p><p>"He <u>does</u> know," objected Peter, coming briskly to the point. "What
are you going to do?"
</p><p>"Lie to him," said Roddy. "He is an old friend of the family. She told
me so herself. She thought even of appealing to him before she
appealed to us. If he finds out I have met her alone at daybreak, I
have either got to tell him why we met and what we are trying to do,
or he'll believe, in his nasty, suspicious, Spanish-American way, that
I am in love with her, and that she came there to let me tell her so."
</p><p>Roddy turned on Peter savagely.
</p><p>"<u>Why</u> didn't you stop me?" he cried.
</p><p>"Stop <u>you</u>--talking too much?" gasped Peter. "Is that my position? If
it is, I resign."
</p><p>The moon that night threw black shadows of shrouds, and ratlines
across a deck that was washed by its radiance as white as a
bread-board. In the social hall, the happy exiles were rejoicing
noisily, but Roddy stood apart, far forward, looking over the ship's
side and considering bitterly the mistake of the morning. His
melancholy self-upbraidings were interrupted by a light, alert step,
and Pino Vega, now at ease, gracious and on guard, stood bowing before
him.
</p><p>"I do not intrude?" he asked.
</p><p>Roddy, at once equally on guard, bade him welcome.
</p><p>"I have sought you out," said the Venezuelan pleasantly, "because I
would desire a little talk with you. I believe we have friends in
common."
</p><p>"It is possible," said Roddy. "I have been in Porto Cabello about four
months now."
</p><p>"It was not of Porto Cabello that I spoke," continued Vega, "but of
Curaçao." He looked into Roddy's eyes suddenly and warily, as a
swordsman holds the eyes of his opponent. "I did not understand," he
said, "that you knew the Rojas family?"
</p><p>"I do not know them," answered Roddy.
</p><p>Vega turned his back to the moon, so that his face was in shadow. With
an impatient gesture he flicked his cigarette into the sea. As though
he found Roddy's answer unsatisfactory, he paused. He appeared to wish
that Roddy should have a chance to reconsider it. As the American
remained silent, Vega continued, but his tone now was openly hostile.
</p><p>"I have been Chief of Staff to General Rojas for years," he said. "I
have the honor to know his family well. Señora Rojas treats me as she
did her son, who was my dearest friend. I tell you this to explain why
I speak of a matter which you may think does not concern me. This
morning, entirely against my will, I overheard you speaking to your
friend. He asked you of a certain lady. You answered boldly you
intended to marry her." Vega's voice shook slightly, and he paused to
control it. "Now, you inform me that you are not acquainted with the
Rojas family. What am I to believe?"
</p><p>"I am glad you spoke of that," said Roddy heartily. "I saw that you
overheard us, and I was afraid you'd misunderstand me----"
</p><p>The Venezuelan interrupted sharply.
</p><p>"I am well acquainted with your language!"
</p><p>"You speak it perfectly," Roddy returned, "but you did not understand
it as I spoke it. The young lady is well known in Willemstad. Our
Consul, as you are aware, is her friend. He admires her greatly. He
told me that she is half American. She has been educated like an
American girl, she rides, she plays tennis. What my friend said to me
was, 'What sort of a girl is Señorita Rojas?' and I answered, 'She is
the sort of girl I am going to marry,' meaning she is like the girls
in my own country, one of our own people, like one of the women I some
day hope to marry."
</p><p>Roddy smiled and shrugged his shoulders.
</p><p>"Now do you understand?" he asked.
</p><p>The Venezuelan gave no answering smile. His eyes shone with suspicion.
Roddy recognized that between his desire to believe and some fact that
kept him from believing, the man was acutely suffering.
</p><p>"Tell me, in a word," demanded Vega sharply, "give me your word you do
not know her."
</p><p>"I don't see," said Roddy, "that this is any of your damned business!"
</p><p>The face of Vega checked him. At his refusal to answer, Roddy saw the
look of jealousy that came into the man's eyes and the torment it
brought with it. He felt a sudden pity for him, a certain respect as
for a fellow-sufferer. He himself had met Inez Rojas but twice, but,
as he had told her, he knew now why he had come to Venezuela. This
older man had known Inez for years, and to Roddy, arguing from his own
state of mind regarding her, the fact was evidence enough that Vega
must love her also. He began again, but now quietly, as he would argue
with a child.
</p><p>"I see no reason for making any mystery of it," he said. "I did meet
Miss Rojas. But I can't say I know her. I met her when she was out
riding with her groom. I thought she was an American. She needed some
help, which I was able to give her. That is all."
</p><p>Vega approached Roddy, leaning forward as though he were about to
spring on him. His eyes were close to Roddy's face.
</p><p>"And what was the nature of this help?" he demanded.
</p><p>"You are impertinent," said Roddy.
</p><p>"Answer me!" cried the Venezuelan. "I have the right. No one has a
better right."
</p><p>He flung up his right arm dramatically, and held it tense and
trembling, as though it were poised to hurl a weapon.
</p><p>"You were watched!" he cried hysterically. "I <u>know</u> that you met. And
you tried to deceive me. Both of you. She will try, also----"
</p><p>The moonlight disappeared before the eyes of Colonel Vega, and when
again he opened them he was looking dizzily up at the swaying masts
and yards. Roddy, with his hand at Vega's throat, was forcing his
shoulders back against the rail. His free hand, rigid and heavy as a
hammer, swung above the Venezuelan's face.
</p><p>"Yesterday," panted Roddy, "I saved your life. If you insult that girl
with your dirty, Latin mind, so help me--I will <u>take</u> it!"
</p><p>He flung the man from him, but Vega, choking with pain and
mortification, staggered forward.
</p><p>"It is <u>you</u> who insult her," he shrieked. "It is I who protect her.
Do you know <u>why</u>? Do you know what she is to me? She is my promised
wife!"
</p><p>For a moment the two men stood, swaying with the gentle roll of the
ship, staring into each other's eyes. Above the sound of the wind in
the cordage and the whisper of the water against the ship's side,
Roddy could hear himself breathing in slow, heavy respirations. Not
for an instant did he doubt that the man told the truth. Vega had
spoken with a conviction that was only too genuine, and his statement,
while it could not justify, seemed to explain his recent, sudden
hostility. With a sharp effort, Roddy recovered himself. He saw that
no matter how deeply the announcement might affect him, Vega must
believe that to the American it was a matter of no possible
consequence.
</p><p>"You should have told me this at first," he said quietly. "I thought
your questions were merely impertinent."
</p><p>Roddy hesitated. The interview had become poignantly distasteful to
him. He wished to get away; to be alone. He was conscious that a
possibility had passed out of his life, the thought of which had been
very dear to him. He wanted to think, to plan against this new
condition. In discussing Inez with this man, in this way, he felt he
was degrading her and his regard for her. But he felt also that for
her immediate protection he must find out what Vega knew and what he
suspected. With the purpose of goading him into making some
disclosure, Roddy continued insolently:
</p><p>"And I still think they are impertinent."
</p><p>Roddy's indignation rose and got the upper hand. He cast caution
aside.
</p><p>"With us," he continued, "when a woman promises to marry a man--he
does not spy on her."
</p><p>"We spied on <u>you</u>," protested Vega. "We did not think it would lead
us to----"
</p><p>Roddy cut him off with a sharp cry of warning.
</p><p>"Be careful!" he challenged.
</p><p>"You met in the road----"
</p><p>"So I told you," returned Roddy.
</p><p>"You dismounted and talked with her."
</p><p>Roddy laughed, and with a gesture of impatience motioned Vega to be
silent.
</p><p>"Is that all?" he demanded.
</p><p>The Venezuelan saw the figure he presented. Back of him were hundreds
of years of Spanish traditions, in his veins was the blood of
generations of ancestors by nature suspicious, doubting, jealous. From
their viewpoint he was within his rights; they applauded, they gave
him countenance; but by the frank contempt of the young man before him
his self-respect was being rudely handled. Not even to himself could
he justify his attitude.
</p><p>"In my country," he protested, "according to our customs, it was
enough."
</p><p>The answer satisfied and relieved Roddy. It told him all he wished to
know. It was now evident that Vega's agent had seen only the first
meeting, that he was not aware that Inez followed after Roddy, or
that the next morning by the seashore they had again met. The American
brought the interview to an abrupt finish.
</p><p>"I refuse," said Roddy loftily, "to discuss this matter with you
further. If the mother of Señorita Rojas wishes it, I shall be happy
to answer any questions she may ask. I have done nothing that requires
explanation or apology. I am responsible to no one. Good-night."
</p><p>"Wait!" commanded Vega. "You will find that here you cannot so easily
avoid responsibilities. You have struck me. Well, we have other
customs, which gentlemen----"
</p><p>"I am entirely at your service," said Roddy. He made as magnificent a
bow as though he himself had descended from a line of Spanish
grandees. Vega's eyes lit with pleasure. He was now playing a part in
which he felt assured he appeared to advantage. He almost was grateful
to Roddy for permitting him to reëstablish himself in his own esteem.
</p><p>"My friends shall wait upon you," he said.
</p><p>"Whenever you like," Roddy answered. He started up the deck and
returned again to Vega. "Understand me," he whispered, "as long as I'm
enjoying the hospitality of your country I accept the customs of your
country. If you'd made such a proposition to me in New York I'd have
laughed at you." Roddy came close to Vega and emphasized his words
with a pointed finger. "And understand <u>this</u>! We have quarrelled over
politics. You made an offensive remark about Alvarez; I defended him
and struck you. You now demand satisfaction. That is what happened.
And if you drag the name of any woman into this I won't give you
satisfaction. I will give you a thrashing until you can't stand or
see."
</p><p>Roddy found Peter in the smoking-room, and beckoning him on deck, told
him what he had done.
</p><p>"You're a nice White Mouse!" cried Peter indignantly. "You're not
supposed to go about killing people; you're supposed to save lives."
</p><p>"No one is ever killed in a duel," said Roddy; "I'll fire in the air,
and he will probably miss me. I certainly hope so. But there will be
one good result. It will show Alvarez that I'm not a friend of Vega's,
nor helping him in his revolution."
</p><p>"You don't have to shoot a man to show you're not a friend of his,"
protested Peter.
</p><p>They were interrupted by the hasty approach of Vega's chief advisers
and nearest friends, General Pulido and Colonel Ramon.
</p><p>"Pino seems in a hurry," said Roddy. "I had no idea he was so
bloodthirsty."
</p><p>"Colonel Vega," began Pulido abruptly, "has just informed us of the
unfortunate incident. We have come to tell you that no duel can take
place. It is monstrous. The life of Colonel Vega does not belong to
him, it belongs to the Cause. We will not permit him to risk it
needlessly. You, of all people, should see that. You must apologize."
</p><p>The demand, and the peremptory tone in which it was delivered, caused
the fighting blood of Roddy's Irish grandfathers to bubble in his
veins.
</p><p>"'Must' and 'apologize!'" protested Roddy, in icy tones; "Those are
difficult words, gentlemen."
</p><p>"Consider," cried Pulido, "what great events hang upon the life of
Colonel Vega."
</p><p>"My own life is extremely interesting to me," said Roddy. "But I have
done nothing which needs apology."
</p><p>Colonel Ramon now interrupted anxiously.
</p><p>"You risked your life for Pino. Why now do you wish to take it? Think
of his importance to Venezuela, of the happiness he will bring his
country, and think what his loss would mean to your own father."
</p><p>"My father!" exclaimed Roddy. "What has my father to do with this?"
</p><p>The two Venezuelans looked at each other in bewilderment, and then
back at Roddy sternly and suspiciously.
</p><p>"Are you jesting?" demanded General Pulido.
</p><p>"Never been more serious in my life," said Roddy.
</p><p>The two officers searched his face eagerly.
</p><p>"It is as Pino says," exclaimed Pulido, with sudden enlightenment. "He
is telling the truth!"
</p><p>"Of course I'm telling the truth!" cried Roddy fiercely. "Are you
looking for a duel, too?"
</p><p>"Tell him!" cried Pulido.
</p><p>"But Mr. Forrester's orders!" protested Colonel Ramon.
</p><p>"He is more dangerous," declared Pulido, "knowing nothing, than he
would be if he understood."
</p><p>He cast a rapid glance about him. With a scowl, his eyes finally
rested upon Peter.
</p><p>"I'll be within knockout distance if you want me," said that young man
to Roddy, and moved to the rail opposite.
</p><p>When he had gone, Pulido bent eagerly forward.
</p><p>"Do you not know," he demanded, "what it is your father is doing in
our country?"
</p><p>Roddy burst forth impatiently, "No!" he protested. "And I seem to be
the only man in the country who doesn't."
</p><p>The two officers crowded close to him. In sepulchral tones, Pulido
exclaimed dramatically. He spoke as though he were initiating Roddy
into a secret order.
</p><p>"Then understand," he whispered, "that your father supports Pino Vega
with five million bolivars; that Vega, whose life you are seeking, is
the man your father means to make President of Venezuela. Now do you
understand?"
</p><p>For a long time Roddy remained silent. Then he exclaimed in tones of
extreme exasperation:
</p><p>"I understand," he said, "that, if my father had given me his
telephone number, he would have saved me a lot of trouble. No wonder
everybody suspects me."
</p><p>"And now," declared Pulido anxiously, "you are one of <u>us</u>!"
</p><p>"I am nothing of the sort," snapped Roddy. "If my father does not wish
to tell me his plans I can't take advantage of what I learn of them
from strangers. I shall go on," he continued with suspicious meekness,
"with the work Father has sent me here to do. Who am I, that I should
push myself into the politics of your great country?"
</p><p>"And the duel?" demanded Pulido.
</p><p>"I am sure," hastily interjected Colonel Ramon, "if Colonel Vega
withdraws his offensive remark about President Alvarez, Mr. Forrester
will withdraw his blow."
</p><p>Roddy failed to see how a blow that had left a raw spot on the chin of
Pino Vega could by mutual agreement be made to vanish. But if to the
minds of the Spanish-Americans such a miracle were possible, it seemed
ungracious not to consent to it.
</p><p>"If I understand you," asked Roddy, "Colonel Vega withdraws his
offensive remark?"
</p><p>The seconds of Pino Vega nodded vigorously.
</p><p>"Then," continued Roddy, "as there was no offensive remark, there
could have been no blow, and there can be no duel."
</p><p>Roddy's summing up delighted the Venezuelans, and declaring that the
honor of all was satisfied, they bowed themselves away.
</p><p>Next morning at daybreak the fortress of San Carlos rose upon the
horizon, and by ten o'clock Roddy was again at work, threatening a
gang of Jamaica coolies. But no longer he swore at them with his
former wholeheartedness. His mind was occupied with other things. Now,
between him and his work, came thoughts of the tunnel that for half a
century had lain hidden from the sight of man; and of Inez, elusive,
beautiful, distracting, now galloping recklessly toward him down a
sunlit road, now a motionless statue standing on a white cliff, with
the waves of the Caribbean bending and bowing before her.
</p><p>With the return of the exiles to Porto Cabello, that picturesque
seaport became a place of gay reunions, of banquets, of welcome and
rejoicing. The cafés again sprang to life. The Alameda was crowded
with loitering figures and smart carriages, whilst the vigilance and
activity of the government secret police increased. Roddy found
himself an object of universal interest. As the son of his father, and
as one who had prevented the assassination of Pino Vega, the members
of the government party suspected him. While the fact that in defense
of Alvarez he had quarrelled with Vega puzzled them greatly.
</p><p>"If I can't persuade them I am with the government," said Roddy, "I
can at least keep them guessing."
</p><p>A week passed before Peter and Roddy were able, without arousing
suspicion, and without being followed, to visit El Morro. They
approached it apparently by accident, at the end of a long walk
through the suburbs, and so timed their progress that, just as the sun
set, they reached the base of the hill on which the fortress stood.
They found that on one side the hill sloped gently toward the city,
and on the other toward the sea. The face toward the city, except for
some venturesome goats grazing on its scant herbage, was bare and
deserted. The side that sloped to the sea was closely overgrown with
hardy mesquite bushes and wild laurel, which would effectually conceal
any one approaching from that direction. What had been the fortress
was now only a broken wall, a few feet in height. It was covered with
moss, and hidden by naked bushes with bristling thorns. Inside the
circumference of the wall was a broken pavement of flat stones.
Between these, trailing vines had forced their way, their roots
creeping like snakes over the stones and through their interstices,
while giant, ill-smelling weeds had turned the once open court-yard
into a maze. These weeds were sufficiently high to conceal any one who
did not walk upright, and while Peter kept watch outside the walled
ring, Roddy, on his hands and knees, forced his way painfully from
stone to stone. After a quarter of an hour of this slow progress he
came upon what once had been the mouth of the tunnel. It was an
opening in the pavement corresponding to a trap in a roof, or to a
hatch in the deck of a ship. The combings were of stone, and were
still intact, as were also the upper stones of a flight of steps that
led down to the tunnel. But below the level of the upper steps,
blocking further descent, were two great slabs of stone. They were
buried deep in a bed of cement, and riveted together and to the walls
of the tunnel by bands of iron. Roddy signalled for Peter to join him,
and in dismay they gazed at the formidable mass of rusty iron, cement
and stone.
</p><p>"We might as well try to break into the Rock of Gibraltar!" gasped
Peter.
</p><p>"Don't think of the difficulties," begged Roddy. "Think that on the
other side of that barrier an old man is slowly dying. I admit it's
going to be a tough job. It will take months. But whatever a man has
put together, a man can pull to pieces."
</p><p>"I also try to see the bright side of life," returned Peter coldly,
"but I can't resist pointing out that the other end of your tunnel
opens into a prison. Breaking into a bank I can understand, but
breaking into a prison seems almost like looking for trouble."
</p><p>The dinner that followed under the stars in their own court-yard did
much to dispel Peter's misgivings, and by midnight, so assured was he
of their final success, that he declared it now was time that General
Rojas should share in their confidence.
</p><p>"To a man placed as he is," he argued, "hope is everything; hope is
health, life. He must know that his message has reached the outside.
He must feel that some one is working toward him. He is the entombed
miner, and, to keep heart in him, we must let him hear the picks of
the rescuing party."
</p><p>"Fine!" cried Roddy, "I am for that, too. I'll get my friend Vicenti,
the prison doctor, to show you over the fortress to-morrow. And we'll
try to think of some way to give Rojas warning."
</p><p>They at once departed for the café of the <u>Dos Hermanos</u>, where the
gay youth of Porto Cabello were wont to congregate, and where they
found the doctor. During the evening he had been lucky at baccarat,
and had been investing his winnings in sweet champagne. He was in a
genial mood. He would be delighted to escort the friend of Señor Roddy
over the fortress, or to any other of the historical places of
interest for which Porto Cabello was celebrated.
</p><p>"Where Alvarez punishes traitors," exclaimed Roddy in a loud tone, "is
what we most desire to see. And," he added, scowling darkly through
the smoke-laden café, "if we could see others who are still at liberty
in the same place we would be better pleased."
</p><p>The remark, although directed at no one in particular, caused a
sensation, and led several of those who had been for two years in
exile to hurriedly finish their chocolate ices and seek their homes.
</p><p>After making an appointment for the morrow with Doctor Vicenti, and
when they were safe in their own <u>patio</u>, Peter protested mildly.
</p><p>"Your devotion to Alvarez," he said, "is too sudden. You overdo it.
Besides, it's making an expert liar of you. Don't get the habit."
</p><p>"As the son of the man who is trying to destroy Alvarez," declared
Roddy, "my position is extremely delicate. And next week it will be
more so. McKildrick got a cable to-day saying that Sam Caldwell is
arriving here by the next boat. His starting for Porto Cabello the
very moment Vega arrives here means trouble for Alvarez, and that the
trouble is coming soon. For, wherever you find Sam Caldwell, there you
will find plotting, bribery, and all uncleanliness. And if I'm to help
Rojas out of prison I must have nothing to do with Sam. Alvarez
recognizes no neutrals. The man who is not with him is against him. So
I must be the friend of Alvarez and of his creatures. For public
occasions, my hand must be against the F. C. C., against Vega, and
especially against Sam Caldwell, because everybody knows he is the
personal agent of my father. Vega's friends know that my father treats
me as though he could not trust me. The Alvarez crowd must know that,
too. Even as it is, they think my being down here is a sort of
punishment. None of them has ever worked in his life, and the idea of
a rich man's son sweating at a donkey-engine with a gang of Conch
niggers, means to them only that my father and I have quarrelled. It
will be my object hereafter to persuade them that that is so. If I
have to act a bit, or lie a bit, what are a few lies against the
freedom of such a man as Rojas? So, to-morrow, if you should be so
lucky as to see Rojas, don't be a bit surprised if I should insult
that unhappy gentleman grossly. If I do, within an hour the fact will
be all over the cafés and the plazas, and with Alvarez it would be
counted to me for righteousness. Much that I may have to do of the
same sort will make the gentlemen of Vega's party consider me an
ungrateful son, and very much of a blackguard. They may, in their
turn, insult me, and want to fight more duels. But it's all in the
game. To save that old man is my only object for living, my only
interest. I don't care how many revolutions I tread on. I would
sacrifice everybody and everything--for him."
</p><p>After his long speech, Roddy drew a deep breath and glared at Peter as
though inviting contradiction. But, instead of contradicting him,
Peter smiled skeptically and moved to his bedroom, which opened upon
the court-yard. At the door he turned.
</p><p>"'And the woman,'" he quoted, "'was very fair.'"
</p><p>The next morning the two Americans met Doctor Vicenti in the
guard-room of the fortress, and under his escort began a leisurely
inspection of the prison. They themselves saw to it that it was
leisurely, and by every device prolonged it. That their interest in
the one prisoner they had come to see might not be suspected, they
pretended a great curiosity in the doctor's patients and in all the
other prisoners. After each visit to a cell they would invite Vicenti
to give them the history of its inmate. They assured him these little
biographies, as he related them, were of surpassing brilliancy and
pathos. In consequence, Vicenti was so greatly flattered that, before
they reached the cell of General Rojas, each succeeding narrative had
steadily increased in length, and the young doctor had become
communicative and loquacious.
</p><p>When at last they had descended to the lowest tier of cells, Vicenti
paused and pointed toward an iron-barred double door.
</p><p>"In there," he whispered to Peter, "is our most distinguished
political prisoner, General Rojas. There is no one Alvarez would so
willingly see dead. And, if he keeps him here a month longer, Alvarez
will have his wish."
</p><p>"But they say the man is a traitor," protested Roddy.
</p><p>The doctor shrugged his shoulders.
</p><p>"In my country," he answered, "every man who is not for the government
is a traitor."
</p><p>He directed the turnkey who accompanied them to unlock the gate of the
cell, and with a gesture invited the Americans to enter. As they did
so, each dropped his right hand into his outside coat pocket. When it
came forth again, concealed under each little finger was a tiny roll
of rice-paper torn from a book of cigarette-wrappers. On each, in
pencil, was written, "54-4" and the word "Hope." The night previous
Peter and Roddy had prepared the papers, on the chance that while one
of them occupied the attention of the guide, the other could slip his
message to Rojas. Roddy had insisted upon the use of rice-paper,
because it could be swallowed without indigestion, and instead of the
word "Hope," had preferred a freehand drawing of an anchor, arguing
that the anchor was the emblem of hope, and was more picturesque than
the written word. To this Peter had objected that while they knew an
anchor signified hope, Rojas might not, and as they were risking their
lives to get a message to him, it was important he should understand
it. They compromised on the numerals, which would show Rojas his own
cipher messages had been received and understood, and the word "Hope"
was added to put heart into him and strengthen his desire to cling to
life.
</p><p>But on entering the cell they saw at once that there would be no
chance to deliver their message. General Rojas was seated at a table
some ten feet from them, and the turnkey, who had submitted with ill
grace to the Americans entering any of the cells, and who seemed
especially to resent their presence in this one, at once placed
himself aggressively on guard.
</p><p>As he did so he commanded sharply: "The visitors will not speak to the
prisoner."
</p><p>"That is understood," Vicenti answered.
</p><p>The Americans saw a room some forty by twenty feet in size, with
walls, arched ceiling and floor entirely of stone. There were no
windows, but it was well lighted by candles, and the lanterns carried
by Vicenti and the turnkey threw a full light into each corner. They
saw a cot, a table, a chair, a number of shelves loaded to the bending
point with books and, at one end of the cell, an immense archway. This
archway had been blocked with stone, roughly hewn and held together by
cement. At the first glance, it was obvious that this was the other
entrance to the tunnel. As he beheld its solid front, the heart of
each of the young men sank in dismay.
</p><p>General Rojas had risen, and stood shading his eyes from the
unaccustomed light of the lanterns.
</p><p>"I have taken the liberty of intruding upon you," Vicenti was saying,
"because these two gentlemen are interested in the history of the
fortress."
</p><p>General Rojas bowed gravely, and with a deprecatory gesture, glanced
at the turnkey, as though to explain why he did not address them.
</p><p>"This part of the fortress," Vicenti began hurriedly, "is very old. It
was built in the sixteenth century, and was, I think, originally the
messroom. It is now used only for the most important political
prisoners."
</p><p>For an instant there was an awkward silence, and then Roddy broke it
with a laugh, short and contemptuous.
</p><p>"You mean traitors," he sneered.
</p><p>General Rojas straightened as suddenly as though Roddy had struck at
him. The young doctor was no less moved. He turned on the American
with an exclamation of indignation.
</p><p>"You forget yourself, sir!" he said.
</p><p>Though Peter had been warned that Roddy might try by insulting Rojas
to make capital for himself, his insolence to a helpless old man was
unpardonable. He felt his cheeks burn with mortification. The turnkey
alone showed his pleasure, and grinned appreciatively. Roddy himself
was entirely unashamed.
</p><p>"I have no sympathy for such men!" he continued defiantly. "A murderer
takes only human life; a traitor would take the life of his country.
In the States," he cried hotly, "we make short work with traitors. We
hang them!"
</p><p>He wheeled furiously on Peter, as though Peter had contradicted him.
</p><p>"I say we do," he exclaimed. "It's in the Constitution. It's the law.
You've read it yourself. It's page fifty-four, paragraph four, of the
Constitution of the United States. 'Punishment for Traitors.' Page
fifty-four, paragraph four."
</p><p>Apparently with sudden remorse at his impetuosity, he turned to the
doctor.
</p><p>"I beg your pardon," he exclaimed. "I <u>did</u> forget myself. But to me,
men like that are intolerable."
</p><p>Vicenti was not to be mollified.
</p><p>"Then you had better avoid their presence," he said angrily.
</p><p>With an impatient gesture he motioned the two Americans into the
corridor, and in distress approached the prisoner.
</p><p>"I apologize, sir," he said, "for having subjected you to such an
incident."
</p><p>But General Rojas made no answer. To his surprise, Vicenti found that
the old man was suffering from the scene even more keenly than he had
feared. Like one suddenly bereft of strength, General Rojas had sunk
into his chair. His bloodless, delicate hands trembled upon the table.
Great tears crept down his white, wrinkled face. In the two years
through which the young doctor had watched his patient he had never
before seen in his eyes the strange, mad light that now shone there.
To the medical man, it meant only that the end was nearer than he had
supposed. Shocked and grieved, the doctor made a movement to withdraw.
</p><p>"I am deeply sorry," he murmured.
</p><p>General Rojas raised his head. With an effort he drew over his face
its customary, deathlike mask.
</p><p>"It is nothing!" he exclaimed. "What is one more insult, what is one
more degradation, when I know that my end is near!" He raised his
voice; it was strangely vigorous, youthful, jubilant; it carried
through the open bars to the far end of the corridor. "What does
anything matter," he cried, "when I know--that the end is near!" His
head sunk upon the table. To hide his tears, the General buried his
face in his hands.
</p><p>Outside, in the darkness, Peter clutched Roddy by the hand, and for an
instant crushed it in his own.
</p><p>"Do you hear?" he whispered. "He is answering you."
</p><p>"Yes," stammered Roddy. The excitement or the dampness of the prison
had set him shivering, and with the back of his hand he wiped the cold
moisture from his forehead. He laughed mirthlessly. "Yes," he
answered, "he understood me. And now, we've <u>got</u> to make good!"
</p><p>That afternoon when the carriages of the aristocracy of Porto Cabello
were solemnly circling the Plaza, Roddy came upon McKildrick, seated
on one of the stone benches, observing the parade of local wealth and
fashion with eyes that missed nothing and told nothing. McKildrick was
a fine type of the self-taught American. He possessed a thorough
knowledge of his profession, executive skill, the gift of handling
men, and the added glory of having "worked his way up." He was tall,
lean, thin-lipped, between thirty and forty years of age. During
business hours he spoke only to give an order or to put a question.
Out of working hours, in his manner to his assistants and workmen, he
was genially democratic. He had, apparently, a dread of being alone,
and was seldom seen without one of the younger engineers at his elbow.
With them he was considered a cynic, the reason given for his cynicism
being that "the Chief" had tried to "take a fall out of matrimony,"
and had come out of it a woman-hater. Officially he was Roddy's
superior, but it never was possible for any one in the pay of the F.
C. C. to forget that Roddy was the son of his father. Even McKildrick,
in certain ways, acknowledged it. One way was, in their leisure
moments, not to seek out Roddy, but to wait for the younger man
to make advances. On this occasion, after for a brief moment
contemplating McKildrick severely, Roddy, with an impatient
exclamation, as though dismissing doubts and misgivings, sat down
beside him.
</p><p>"McKildrick," he began impetuously, "I want to ask you an impertinent
question. It concerns your moral character."
</p><p>McKildrick grinned appreciatively.
</p><p>"We court investigation," he said.
</p><p>"Under what pressure to the square inch," demanded Roddy, "would a
secret confided to you be liable to burst its boiler?"
</p><p>"I've never," returned the engineer, "had an accident of that kind."
</p><p>"Good!" exclaimed Roddy. "Then suppose I said to you, 'McKildrick, I
know where there's buried treasure, but I don't know how to get it
out.' You <u>would</u> know. Now, if I led you to the buried treasure,
would you, as an expert engineer, tell me how to dig it out, and then
could you forget you'd given that advice and that you'd ever heard of
the treasure?"
</p><p>For a moment McKildrick considered this hypothetical case. Then he
asked: "Which bank are you thinking of opening?"
</p><p>Roddy rose abruptly.
</p><p>"I'll show you," he exclaimed.
</p><p>That Roddy was acting, in spite of secret misgivings, was so evident,
that McKildrick good-naturedly demurred.
</p><p>"Better not tell me anything," he protested, "that you'll be sorry for
when you're sober."
</p><p>Roddy shook his head, and, not until they had left the suburbs and the
last fisherman's hut behind them and were on the open coast, did he
again refer to the subject of their walk. Then he exclaimed suddenly;
"And I forgot to mention that if Father finds out you advised me you
will probably lose your job."
</p><p>McKildrick halted in his tracks.
</p><p>"It's a pity," he agreed, "that you forgot to mention that. As a rule,
when I give expert advice I get a fat check for it."
</p><p>"And what's more," continued Roddy, "if Alvarez finds it out you'll go
to jail."
</p><p>"Your piquant narrative interests me strangely," said McKildrick.
"What else happens to me?"
</p><p>"But, of course," explained Roddy reassuringly, "you'll tell them you
didn't know what you were doing."
</p><p>"How about <u>your</u> telling me what we are doing?" suggested the
engineer.
</p><p>"From this point," was Roddy's only reply, "you crawl on your hands
and knees, or some one may see you."
</p><p>The engineer bent his tall figure and, following in Roddy's trail,
disappeared into the laurel bushes.
</p><p>"Why shouldn't they see me?" he called.
</p><p>"One looks so silly on his hands and knees," Roddy suggested.
</p><p>For ten minutes, except for the rustle of the bushes, they pushed
their way in silence, and then Roddy scrambled over the fallen wall of
the fort, and pointed down at the entrance to the tunnel.
</p><p>"The problem is," he said, "to remove these slabs from that
staircase, and leave it in such shape that no one who is foolish
enough to climb up here could see that they had been disturbed."
</p><p>"Do you really think," demanded McKildrick, smiling sceptically, "that
there <u>is</u> buried treasure under these stones?"
</p><p>"Yes," answered Roddy anxiously, "a <u>kind</u> of buried treasure."
</p><p>Cautiously McKildrick raised his head, and, as though to establish his
bearings, surveyed the landscape. To the north he saw the city; to the
east, a quarter of a mile away, the fortress, separated from the
mainland by a stretch of water; and to the south, the wild mesquite
bushes and laurel through which they had just come, stretching to the
coast.
</p><p>"Is this a serious proposition?" he asked.
</p><p>"It's a matter of life and death," Roddy answered.
</p><p>McKildrick seated himself on the flight of stone steps, and for some
time, in silence, studied them critically. He drove the heel of his
boot against the cement, and, with his eyes, tested the resistance of
the rusty bars of iron.
</p><p>"With a couple of men and crowbars, and a pinch of dynamite that
wouldn't make a noise," he said at last, "I could open that in an
hour."
</p><p>"Could you put it back again?" asked Roddy.
</p><p>There was a long pause.
</p><p>"I guess," said McKildrick, "you'll have to let me in on the ground
floor."
</p><p>The sun had set and the air had turned cold and damp. Roddy seated
himself beside his chief and pointed at the great slabs at their feet.
His voice dropped to a whisper.
</p><p>"It's like this," he began.
</p><p>When, two hours later, they separated at the outskirts of the city,
McKildrick had been initiated into the Brotherhood of the White Mice.
</p><p>They had separated, agreeing that in the future the less they were
seen together the better. But, in wishing to be alone, Roddy had
another and more sentimental reason.
</p><p>Each evening since his return from Curaçao he had made a pilgrimage to
the deserted home of the Rojas family, and, as the garden of Miramar
ran down to meet the shore of the harbor, as did the garden of his own
house, he was able to make the nocturnal visits by rowboat, and
without being observed. Sometimes he was satisfied simply to lie on
his oars opposite the empty mansion, and think of the young girl who,
so soon, was to waken it to life; and again he tied his boat to a
public wharf a hundred yards down the shore, and with the aid of the
hanging vines pulled himself to the top of the seawall, and dropped
into the garden. To a young man very much interested in a young woman,
of whom he knew so little that it was possible to endow her with every
grace of mind and character, and whose personal charm was never to be
forgotten, these melancholy visits afforded much satisfaction. Even to
pass the house was a pleasing exercise; and, separating from
McKildrick, he turned his steps to the Alameda, the broad avenue
shaded by a double line of trees that followed the curve of the
harbor, and upon which the gates of Miramar opened. As he approached
the house he saw, with surprise and pleasure, that in the future his
midnight prowlings were at an end. Miramar was occupied. Every window
blazed with light. In this light servants were moving hurriedly, and
in front of the gates the Alameda was blocked with carts loaded with
trunks and boxes.
</p><p>Excited by the sight, Roddy hid himself in the shadows of the trees,
and, unobserved, stood impatiently waiting for a chance to learn if
the exiles had indeed returned to their own. He had not long to wait.
In a little figure bustling among the carts, and giving many orders,
he recognized his friend and ally, Pedro. Roddy instantly stepped into
the glare of the electric globes until he was sure Pedro had seen
him, and then again retreated into the shadow. In a moment the old
servant was at his side.
</p><p>"Is she here?" demanded Roddy.
</p><p>Appreciating that in the world there could be only one "she," the
little man nodded violently.
</p><p>"Tell her," whispered Roddy, "I have seen her father, that he knows
what we are trying to do. I must talk with the <u>señorita</u> at once. Ask
her if she will come to the steps leading from the gardens to the
wharf at any hour this evening. From my own house I can row there
without being seen."
</p><p>Again Pedro nodded happily.
</p><p>"I will ask the <u>señorita</u> to be there at nine o'clock," he answered,
"or, I will come myself."
</p><p>The alternative did not strongly appeal to Roddy, but the mere fact
that Inez was now in the same city with him, that even at that moment
she was not a hundred yards from him, was in itself a reward.
</p><p>He continued on down the Alameda, his head in the air, his feet
treading on springs.
</p><p>"Three hours!" his mind protested. "How can I wait three hours?"
</p><p>In some fashion the hours passed, and at nine, just as over all the
city the bugles were recalling the soldiers to the barracks, Roddy was
waiting on the narrow stretch of beach that ran between the harbor and
the gardens of Miramar.
