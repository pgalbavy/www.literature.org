<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>But Georgie did. It is difficult to imagine how cause and effect
could be more closely and patently related. Inevitably, Georgie
did come poking around. How was he to refrain when daily, up and
down the neighbourhood, the brothers strutted with mystic and
important airs, when they whispered together and uttered words
of strange import in his presence? Thus did they defeat their
own object. They desired to keep Georgie at a distance, yet they
could not refrain from posing before him. They wished to impress
upon him the fact that he was an outsider, and they but succeeded
in rousing his desire to be an insider, a desire that soon became
a determination. For few were the days until he not only knew
of the shack but had actually paid it a visit. That was upon a
morning when the other boys were in school, Georgie having found
himself indisposed until about ten o'clock, when he was able to
take nourishment and subsequently to interest himself in this
rather private errand. He climbed the Williams' alley fence, and,
having made a modest investigation of the exterior of the shack,
which was padlocked, retired without having disturbed anything
except his own peace of mind. His curiosity, merely piqued before,
now became ravenous and painful. It was not allayed by the mystic
manners of the members or by the unnecessary emphasis they laid
upon their coldness toward himself; and when a committee informed
him darkly that there were "secret orders" to prevent his coming
within "a hundred and sixteen feet"&mdash;such was Penrod's arbitrary
language&mdash;of the Williams' yard, "in any direction", Georgie could
bear it no longer, but entered his own house, and, in burning
words, laid the case before a woman higher up. Here the responsibility
for things is directly traceable to grown people. Within that
hour, Mrs. Bassett sat in Mrs. Williams's library to address her
hostess upon the subject of Georgie's grievance.</p>

<p>"Of course, it isn't Sam's fault," she said, concluding her interpretation
of the affair. "Georgie likes Sam, and didn't blame him at all.
No; we both felt that Sam would always be a polite, nice boy &mdash;Georgie
used those very words&mdash;but Penrod seems to have a <em>VERY </em>bad
influence. Georgie felt that Sam would <em>WANT </em>him to come
and play in the shack if Penrod didn't make Sam do everything
HE wants. What hurt Georgie most is that it's <em>SAM'S </em>shack,
and he felt for another boy to come and tell him that he mustn't
even go <em>NEAR </em>it&mdash;well, of course, it was very trying.
And he's very much hurt with little Maurice Levy, too. He said
that he was sure that even Penrod would be glad to have him for
a member of their little club if it weren't for Maurice&mdash;and I
think he spoke of Roddy Bitts, too."</p>

<p>The fact that the two remaining members were coloured was omitted
from this discourse which leads to the deduction that Georgie
had not mentioned it.</p>

<p>"Georgie said all the other boys liked him very much," Mrs. Bassett
continued, "and that he felt it his duty to join the club, because
most of them were so anxious to have him, and he is sure he would
have a good influence over them. He really did speak of it in
quite a touching way, Mrs. Williams. Of course, we mothers mustn't
brag of our sons too much, but Georgie <em>REALLY </em>isn't like
other boys. He is so sensitive, you can't think how this little
affair has hurt him, and I felt that it might even make him ill.
You see, I <em>HAD </em>to respect his reason for wanting to join
the club. And if I AM his mother"&mdash;she gave a deprecating little
laugh&mdash;"I must say that it seems noble to want to join not really
for his own sake but for the good that he felt his influence would
have over the other boys. Don't you think so, Mrs. Williams?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Williams said that she did, indeed. And the result of this
interview was another, which took place between Sam and his father
that evening, for Mrs. Williams, after talking to Sam herself,
felt that the matter needed a man to deal with it. The man did
it man-fashion.</p>

<p>"You either invite Georgie Bassett to play in the shack all he
wants to," the man said, "or the shack comes down."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take your choice. I'm not going to have neighbourhood quarrels
over such&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Papa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's enough! You said yourself you haven't anything against
Georgie."</p>

<p>"I said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You said you didn't like him, but you couldn't tell why. You
couldn't state a single instance of bad behaviour against him.
You couldn't mention anything he ever did which wasn't what a
gentleman should have done. It's no use, I tell you. Either you
invite Georgie to play in the shack as much as he likes next Saturday,
or the shack comes down."</p>

<p>"But, <em>PAPA</em>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not going to talk any more about it. If you want the shack
pulled down and hauled away, you and your friends continue to
tantalize this inoffensive little boy the way you have been. If
you want to keep it, be polite and invite him in."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's <em>ALL, I </em>said!"</p>

<p>Sam was crushed.</p>

<p>Next day he communicated the bitter substance of the edict to
the other members, and gloom became unanimous. So serious an aspect
did the affair present that it was felt necessary to call a special
meeting of the order after school. The entire membership was in
attendance; the door was closed, the window covered with a board,
and the candle lighted. Then all of the brothers&mdash;except one&mdash;began
to express their sorrowful apprehensions. The whole thing was
spoiled, they agreed, if Georgie Bassett had to be taken in. On
the other hand, if they didn't take him in, "there wouldn't be
anything left." The one brother who failed to express any opinion
was little Verman. He was otherwise occupied.</p>

<p>Verman had been the official paddler during the initiations of
Roddy Bitts and Maurice Levy; his work had been conscientious,
and it seemed to be taken by consent that he was to continue in
office. An old shingle from the woodshed roof had been used for
the exercise of his function in the cases of Roddy and Maurice;
but this afternoon he had brought with him a new one that he had
picked up somewhere. It was broader and thicker than the old one
and, during the melancholy prophecies of his fellows, he whittled
the lesser end of it to the likeness of a handle. Thus engaged,
he bore no appearance of despondency; on the contrary, his eyes,
shining brightly in the candlelight, indicated that eager thoughts
possessed him, while from time to time the sound of a chuckle
issued from his simple African throat. Gradually the other brothers
began to notice his preoccupation, and one by one they fell silent,
regarding him thoughtfully. Slowly the darkness of their countenances
lifted a little; something happier and brighter began to glimmer
from each boyish face. All eyes remained fascinated upon Verman.</p>

<p>"Well, anyway," said Penrod, in a tone that was almost cheerful,
"this is only Tuesday. We got pretty near all week to fix up the
'nishiation for Saturday."</p>

<p>And Saturday brought sunshine to make the occasion more tolerable
for both the candidate and the society. Mrs. Williams, going to
the window to watch Sam when he left the house after lunch, marked
with pleasure that his look and manner were sprightly as he skipped
down the walk to the front gate. There he paused and yodelled
for a time. An answering yodel came presently; Penrod Schofield
appeared, and by his side walked Georgie Bassett. Georgie was
always neat; but Mrs. Williams noticed that he exhibited unusual
gloss and polish to-day. As for his expression, it was a shade
too complacent under the circumstances, though, for that matter,
perfect tact avoids an air of triumph under any circumstances.
Mrs. Williams was pleased to observe that Sam and Penrod betrayed
no resentment whatever; they seemed to have accepted defeat in
a good spirit and to be inclined to make the best of Georgie.
Indeed, they appeared to be genuinely excited about him&mdash;it was
evident that their cordiality was eager and wholehearted.</p>

<p>The three boys conferred for a few moments; then Sam disappeared
round the house and returned, waving his hand and nodding. Upon
that, Penrod took Georgie's left arm, Sam took his right, and
the three marched off to the backyard in a companionable way that
made Mrs. Williams feel it had been an excellent thing to interfere
a little in Georgie's interest.</p>

<p>Experiencing the benevolent warmth that comes of assisting in
a good action, she ascended to an apartment upstairs, and, for
a couple of hours, employed herself with needle and thread in
sartorial repairs on behalf of her husband and Sam. Then she was
interrupted by the advent of a coloured serving-maid.</p>

<p>"Miz Williams, I reckon the house goin' fall down!" this pessimist
said, arriving out of breath. "That s'iety o' Mist' Sam's suttenly
tryin' to pull the roof down on ow haids!"</p>

<p>"The roof?" Mrs. Williams inquired mildly. "They aren't in the
attic, are they?"</p>

<p>"No'm; they in the celluh, but they <em>REACHIN' </em>fer the
roof! I nev' did hear no sech a rumpus an' squawkin' an' squawlin'
an' fallin' an' whoopin' an' whackin' an' bangin'! They troop
down by the outside celluh do', n'en&mdash;bang!&mdash;they bus' loose,
an' been goin' on ev' since, wuss'n Bedlun! Ef they anything down
celluh ain' broke by this time, it cain' be only jes' the foundashum,
an' I bet <em>THAT </em>ain' goin' stan' much longer! I'd gone
down an' stop 'em, but I'm 'fraid to. Hones', Miz Williams, I'm
'fraid o' my life go down there, all that Bedlun goin' on. I thought
I come see what you say."</p>

<p>Mrs. Williams laughed.</p>

<p>"We have to stand a little noise in the house sometimes, Fanny,
when there are boys. They're just playing, and a lot of noise
is usually a pretty safe sign."</p>

<p>"Yes'm," Fanny said. "It's yo' house, Miz Williams, not mine.
You want 'em tear it down, I'm willin'."</p>

<p>She departed, and Mrs. Williams continued to sew. The days were
growing short, and at five o'clock she was obliged to put the
work aside, as her eyes did not permit her to continue it by artificial
light. Descending to the lower floor, she found the house silent,
and when she opened the front door to see if the evening paper
had come, she beheld Sam, Penrod and Maurice Levy standing near
the gate engaged in quiet conversation. Penrod and Maurice departed
while she was looking for the paper, and Sam came thoughtfully
up the walk.</p>

<p>"Well, Sam," she said, "it wasn't such a bad thing, after all,
to show a little politeness to Georgie Bassett, was it?"</p>

<p>Sam gave her a non-committal look&mdash;expression of every kind had
been wiped from his countenance. He presented a blank surface.</p>

<p>"No'm," he said meekly.</p>

<p>"Everything was just a little pleasanter because you'd been friendly,
wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>"Has Georgie gone home?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>"I hear you made enough noise in the cellar &mdash;Did Georgie
have a good time?"</p>

<p>"Ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Did Georgie Bassett have a good time?"</p>

<p>"Well" &mdash;Sam now had the air of a person trying to remember
details with absolute accuracy&mdash;"well, he didn't say he did, and
he didn't say he didn't."</p>

<p>"Didn't he thank the boys?"</p>

<p>"No'm."</p>

<p>"Didn't he even thank you?"</p>

<p>"No'm."</p>

<p>"Why, that's queer," she said. "He's always so polite. He <em>SEEMED
</em>to be having a good time, didn't he, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Didn't Georgie seem to be enjoying himself?"</p>

<p>This question, apparently so simple, was not answered with promptness.
Sam looked at his mother in a puzzled way, and then he found it
necessary to rub each of his shins in turn with the palm of his
right hand.</p>

<p>"I stumbled," he said apologetically. "I stumbled on the cellar
steps."</p>

<p>"Did you hurt yourself?" she asked quickly.</p>

<p>"No'm; but I guess maybe I better rub some arnica&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll get it," she said. "Come up to your father's bathroom,
Sam. Does it hurt much?"</p>

<p>"No'm," he answered truthfully, "it hardly hurts at all."</p>

<p>And having followed her to the bathroom, he insisted, with unusual
gentleness, that he be left to apply the arnica to the alleged
injuries himself. He was so persuasive that she yielded, and descended
to the library, where she found her husband once more at home
after his day's work.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said. "Did Georgie show up, and were they decent to
him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; it's all right. Sam and Penrod were good as gold. I
saw them being actually cordial to him."</p>

<p>"That's well," Mr. Williams said, settling into a chair with
his paper. "I was a little apprehensive, but I suppose I was mistaken.
I walked home, and just now, as I passed Mrs. Bassett's, I saw
Doctor Venny's car in front, and that barber from the corner shop
on Second Street was going in the door. I couldn't think what
a widow would need a barber and a doctor for&mdash;especially at the
same time. I couldn't think what Georgie'd need such a combination
for either, and then I got afraid that maybe&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Williams laughed. "Oh, no; it hasn't anything to do with
his having been over here. I'm sure they were very nice to him."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad of that."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed&mdash;" Mrs. Williams began, when Fanny appeared, summoning
her to the telephone.</p>

<p>It is pathetically true that Mrs. Williams went to the telephone
humming a little song. She was detained at the instrument not
more than five minutes; then she made a plunging return into the
library, a blanched and stricken woman. She made strange, sinister
gestures at her husband.</p>

<p>He sprang up, miserably prophetic. "Mrs. Bassett?"</p>

<p>"Go to the telephone," Mrs. Williams said hoarsely "She wants
to talk to you, too. She <em>CAN'T </em>talk much&mdash;she's hysterical.
She says they lured Georgie into the cellar and had him beaten
by negroes! That's not all&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Williams was already on his way.</p>

<p>"You find Sam!" he commanded, over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Mrs. Williams stepped into the front hall. "Sam!" she called,
addressing the upper reaches of the stairway. "Sam!"</p>

<p>Not even echo answered.</p>

<p>"<em>SAM</em>!"</p>

<p>A faint clearing of somebody's throat was heard behind her, a
sound so modest and unobtrusive it was no more than just audible,
and, turning, the mother beheld her son sitting upon the floor
in the shadow of the stairs and gazing meditatively at the hatrack.
His manner indicated that he wished to produce the impression
that he had been sitting there, in this somewhat unusual place
and occupation, for a considerable time, but without overhearing
anything that went on in the library so close by.</p>

<p>"Sam," she cried, "what have you <em>DONE</em>?"</p>

<p>"Well &mdash;I guess my legs are all right," he said gently.
"I got the arnica on, so probably they won't hurt any m&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stand up!" she said.</p>

<p>"Ma'am?"</p>

<p>"March into the library!"</p>

<p>Sam marched&mdash;slow-time. In fact, no funeral march has been composed
in a time so slow as to suit this march of Sam's. One might have
suspected that he was in a state of apprehension.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams entered at one door as his son crossed the threshold
of the other, and this encounter was a piteous sight. After one
glance at his father's face, Sam turned desperately, as if to
flee outright. But Mrs. Williams stood in the doorway behind him.</p>

<p>"You come here!" And the father's voice was as terrible as his
face. "<em>WHAT DID YOU DO TO GEORGIE BASSETT</em>?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'," Sam gulped; "nothin' at all."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"We just&mdash;we just 'nishiated him."</p>

<p>Mr. Williams turned abruptly, walked to the fireplace, and there
turned again, facing the wretched Sam. "That's all you did?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Georgie Bassett's mother has just told me over the telephone,"
Mr. Williams said, deliberately, "that you and Penrod Schofield
and Roderick Bitts and Maurice Levy <em>LURED GEORGIE INTO THE
CELLAR AND HAD HIM BEATEN BY NEGROES</em>!"</p>

<p>At this, Sam was able to hold up his head a little and to summon
a rather feeble indignation.</p>

<p>"It ain't so," he declared. "We didn't any such thing lower him
into the cellar. We weren't goin' <em>NEAR </em>the cellar with
him. We never <em>THOUGHT </em>of goin' down cellar. He went down
there himself, first."</p>

<p>"So! I suppose he was running away from you, poor thing! Trying
to escape from you, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"He wasn't," Sam said doggedly. "We weren't chasin' him&mdash;or anything
at all."</p>

<p>"Then why did he go in the cellar?"</p>

<p>"Well, he didn't exactly GO in the cellar," Sam said reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Well, how did he <em>GET </em>in the cellar, then?"</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he fell in," said Sam.</p>

<p>"<em>HOW </em>did he fall in?"</p>

<p>"Well, the door was open, and&mdash;well, he kept walkin' around there,
and we hollered at him to keep away, but just then he kind of&mdash;well,
the first <em>I</em> noticed was I couldn't <em>SEE </em>him,
and so we went and looked down the steps, and he was sitting down
there on the bottom step and kind of shouting, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"See here!" Mr. Williams interrupted. "You're going to make a
clean breast of this whole affair and take the consequences. You're
going to tell it and tell it <em>ALL. </em>Do you understand that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then you tell me how Georgie Bassett fell down the cellar steps&mdash;and
tell me quick!"</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he was blindfolded."</p>

<p>"Aha! <em>NOW </em>we're getting at it. You begin at the beginning
and tell me just what you did to him from the time he got here.
Understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Go on, then!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm goin' to," Sam protested. "We never hurt him at all.
He wasn't even hurt when he fell down cellar. There's a lot of
mud down there, because the cellar door leaks, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sam!" Mr. Williams's tone was deadly. "Did you hear me tell
you to begin at the beginning?"</p>

<p>Sam made a great effort and was able to obey.</p>

<p>"Well, we had everything ready for the 'nishiation before lunch,"
he said. "We wanted it all to be nice, because you said we had
to have him, papa, and after lunch Penrod went to guard him&mdash;that's
a new part in the rixual&mdash;and he brought him over, and we took
him out to the shack and blindfolded him, and&mdash;well, he got kind
of mad because we wanted him to lay down on his stummick and be
tied up, and he said he wouldn't, because the floor was a little
bit wet in there and he could feel it sort of squashy under his
shoes, and he said his mother didn't want him ever to get dirty
and he just wouldn't do it; and we all kept telling him he had
to, or else how could there be any 'nishiation; and he kept gettin'
madder and said he wanted to have the 'nishiation outdoors where
it wasn't wet and he wasn't goin' to lay down on his stummick,
anyway."  Sam paused for wind, then got under way again: "Well,
some of the boys were tryin' to get him to lay down on his stummick,
and he kind of fell up against the door and it came open and he
ran out in the yard. He was tryin' to get the blindfold off his
eyes, but he couldn't because it was a towel in a pretty hard
knot; and he went tearin' all around the backyard, and we didn't
chase him, or anything. All we did was just watch him&mdash;and that's
when he fell in the cellar. Well, it didn't hurt him any. It didn't
hurt him at all; but he was muddier than what he would of been
if he'd just had sense enough to lay down in the shack. Well,
so we thought, long as he was down in the cellar anyway, we might
as well have the rest of the 'nishiation down there. So we brought
the things down and&mdash;and 'nishiated him&mdash;and that's all. That's
every bit we did to him."</p>

<p>"Yes," Mr. Williams said sardonically; "I see. What were the
details of the initiation?"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"I want to know what else you did to him? What was the initiation?"</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's secret," Sam murmured piteously.</p>

<p>"Not any longer, I assure you! The society is a thing of the
past and you'll find your friend Penrod's parents agree with me
in that. Mrs. Bassett had already telephoned them when she called
us up. You go on with your story!"</p>

<p>Sam sighed deeply, and yet it may have been a consolation to
know that his present misery was not altogether without its counterpart.
Through the falling dusk his spirit may have crossed the intervening
distance to catch a glimpse of his friend suffering simultaneously
and standing within the same peril. And if Sam's spirit did thus
behold Penrod in jeopardy, it was a true vision.</p>

<p>"Go on!" Mr. Williams said.</p>

<p>"Well, there wasn't any fire in the furnace because it's too
warm yet, and we weren't goin' to do anything'd <em>HURT </em>him,
so we put him in there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the <em>FURNACE</em>?"</p>

<p>"It was cold," Sam protested. "There hadn't been any fire there
since last spring. Course we told him there was fire in it. We
<em>HAD </em>to do that," he continued earnestly, "because that
was part of the 'nishiation. We only kept him in it a little while
and kind of hammered on the outside a little and then we took
him out and got him to lay down on his stummick, because he was
all muddy anyway, where he fell down the cellar; and how could
it matter to anybody that had any sense at all? Well, then we
had the rixual, and&mdash;and&mdash;why, the teeny little paddlin' he got
wouldn't hurt a flea! It was that little coloured boy lives in
the alley did it&mdash;he isn't anyways near <em>HALF </em>Georgie's
size but Georgie got mad and said he didn't want any ole nigger
to paddle him. That's what he said, and it was his own foolishness,
because Verman won't let <em>ANYBODY </em>call him 'nigger', and
if Georgie was goin' to call him that he ought to had sense enough
not to do it when he was layin' down that way and Verman all ready
to be the paddler. And he needn't of been so mad at the rest of
us, either, because it took us about twenty minutes to get the
paddle away from Verman after that, and we had to lock Verman
up in the laundry-room and not let him out till it was all over.
Well, and then things were kind of spoiled, anyway; so we didn't
do but just a little more&mdash;and that's all."</p>

<p>"Go on! What was the 'just a little more?'"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;we got him to swaller a little teeny bit of asafidity
that Penrod used to have to wear in a bag around his neck. It
wasn't enough to even make a person sneeze&mdash;it wasn't much more'n
a half a spoonful&mdash;it wasn't hardly a <em>QUARTER </em>of a spoonf&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Mr. Williams. "That accounts for the doctor. What
else?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;we&mdash;we had some paint left over from our flag, and we
put just a little teeny bit of it on his hair and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Mr. Williams. "That accounts for the barber. What
else?"</p>

<p>"That's all," Sam said, swallowing. "Then he got mad and went
home."</p>

<p>Mr. Williams walked to the door, and sternly motioned to the
culprit to precede him through it. But just before the pair passed
from her sight, Mrs. Williams gave way to an uncontrollable impulse.</p>

<p>"Sam," she asked, "what does 'In-Or-In' stand for?"</p>

<p>The unfortunate boy had begun to sniffle.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it means &mdash;Innapenent Order of Infadelaty," he moaned&mdash;and
plodded onward to his doom.</p>

<p>Not his alone: at that very moment Master Roderick Magsworth
Bitts, Junior, was suffering also, consequent upon telephoning
on the part of Mrs. Bassett, though Roderick's punishment was
administered less on the ground of Georgie's troubles and more
on that of Roddy's having affiliated with an order consisting
so largely of Herman and Verman. As for Maurice Levy, he was no
whit less unhappy. He fared as ill.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, two ex-members of the In-Or-In were finding their
lot fortunate. Something had prompted them to linger in the alley
in the vicinity of the shack, and it was to this fated edifice
that Mr. Williams, with demoniac justice, brought Sam for the
deed he had in mind.</p>

<p>Herman and Verman listened&mdash;awe-stricken&mdash;to what went on within
the shack. Then, before it was over, they crept away and down
the alley toward their own home. This was directly across the
alley from the Schofields' stable, and they were horrified at
the sounds that issued from the interior of the stable store-room.
It was the St. Bartholomew's Eve of that neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"Man, man!" said Herman, shaking his head. "Glad I ain' no white
boy!"</p>

<p>Verman seemed gloomily to assent.</p>
