<P>
 An hour later than the time at which he had been expected,
Richard Turlington appeared at his office in the city.
<P>
He met beforehand all the inquiries which the marked change in
him must otherwise have provoked, by announcing that he was ill.
Before he proceeded to business, he asked if anybody was waiting
to see him. One of the servants from Muswell Hill was waiting
with another parcel for Miss Lavinia, ordered by telegram from
the country that morning. Turlington (after ascertaining the
servant's name) received the man in his private room. He there
heard, for the first time, that Launcelot Linzie had been lurking
in the grounds (exactly as he had supposed) on the day when the
lawyer took his instructions for the Settlement and the Will.
<P>
In two hours more Turlington's work was completed. On leaving the
office--as soon as he was out of sight of the door--he turned
eastward, instead of taking the way that led to his own house in
town. Pursuing his course, he entered the labyrinth of streets
which led, in that quarter of East London, to the unsavory
neighborhood of the river-side.
<P>
By this time his mind was made up. The forecast shadow of
meditated crime traveled before him already, as he threaded his
way among his fellow-men.
<P>
He had been to the vestry of St. Columb Major, and had satisfied
himself that he was misled by no false report. There was the
entry in the Marriage Register. The one unexplained mystery was
the mystery of Launce's conduct in permitting his wife to return
to her father's house. Utterly unable to account for this
proceeding, Turlington could only accept facts as they were, and
determine to make the most of his time, while the woman who had
deceived him was still under his roof. A hideous expression
crossed his face as he realized the idea that he had got her
(unprotected by her husband) in his house. "When Launcelot Linzie
_does_ come to claim her," he said to himself, "he shall find I
have been even with him." He looked at his watch. Was it possible
to save the last train and get back that night? No--the last
train had gone. Would she take advantage of his absence to
escape? He had little fear of it. She would never have allowed
her aunt to send him to Lord Winwood's house, if she had felt the
slightest suspicion of his discovering the truth in that quarter.
Returning by the first train the next morning, he might feel sure
of getting back in time. Meanwhile he had the hours of the night
before him. He could give his mind to the serious question that
must be settled before he left London--the question of repaying
the forty thousand pounds. There was but one way of getting the
money now. Sir Joseph had executed his Will; Sir Joseph's death
would leave his sole executor and trustee (the lawyer had said
it!) master of his fortune. Turlington determined to be master of
it in four-and-twenty hours--striking the blow, without risk to
himself, by means of another hand. In the face of the
probabilities, in the face of the facts, he had now firmly
persuaded himself that Sir Joseph was privy to the fraud that had
been practiced on him. The Marriage-Settlement, the Will, the
presence of the family at his country house--all these he
believed to be so many stratagems invented to keep him deceived
until the last moment. The truth was in those words which he had
overheard between Sir Joseph and Launce--and in Launce's presence
(privately encouraged, no doubt) at Muswell Hill. "Her father
shall pay me for it doubly: with his purse and with his life."
With that thought in his heart, Richard Turlington wound his way
through the streets by the river-side, and stopped at a blind
alley called Green Anchor Lane, infamous to this day as the
chosen resort of the most abandoned wretches whom London can
produce.
<P>
The policeman at the corner cautioned him as he turned into the
alley. "They won't hurt _me!_" he answered, and walked on to a
public-house at the bottom of the lane.
<P>
The landlord at the door silently recognized him, and led the way
in. They crossed a room filled with sailors of all nations
drinking; ascended a staircase at the back of the house, and
stopped at the door of the room on the second floor. There the
landlord spoke for the first time. "He has outrun his allowance,
sir, as usual. You will find him with hardly a rag on his back. I
doubt if he will last much longer. He had another fit of the
horrors last night, and the doctor thinks badly of him." With
that introduction he opened the door, and Turlington entered the
room.
<P>
On the miserable bed lay a gray-headed old man of gigantic
stature, with nothing on him but a ragged shirt and a pair of
patched, filthy trousers. At the side of the bed, with a bottle
of gin on the rickety table between them, sat two hideous
leering, painted monsters, wearing the dress of women. The smell
of opium was in the room, as well as the smell of spirits. At
Turlington's appearance, the old man rose on the bed and welcomed
him with greedy eyes and outstretched hand.
<P>
"Money, master!" he called out hoarsely. "A crown piece in
advance, for the sake of old times!"
<P>
Turlington turned to the women without answering, purse in hand.
<P>
"His clothes are at the pawnbroker's, of course. How much?"
<P>
"Thirty shillings."
<P>
"Bring them here, and be quick about it. You will find it worth
your while when you come back."
<P>
The women took the pawnbroker's tickets from the pockets of the
man's trousers and hurried out.
<P>
Turlington closed the door, and seated himself by the bedside. He
laid his hand familiarly on the giant's mighty shoulder, looked
him full in the face, and said, in a whisper,
<P>
"Thomas Wildfang!"
<P>
The man started, and drew his huge hairy hand across his eyes, as
if in doubt whether he was waking or sleeping. "It's better than
ten years, master, since you called me by my name. If I am Thomas
Wildfang, what are you?"
<P>
"Your captain, once more."
<P>
Thomas Wildfang sat up on the side of the bed, and spoke his next
words cautiously in Turlington's ear.
<P>
"Another man in the way?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
The giant shook his bald, bestial head dolefully. "Too late. I'm
past the job. Look here."
<P>
He held up his hand, and showed it trembling incessantly. "I'm an
old man," he said, and let his hand drop heavily again on the bed
beside him.
<P>
Turlington looked at the door, and whispered back,
<P>
"The man is as old as you are. And the money is worth having."
<P>
"How much?"
<P>
"A hundred pounds."
<P>
The eyes of Thomas Wildfang fastened greedily on Turlington's
face. "Let's hear," he said. "Softly, captain. Let's hear."
<P>
*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *
<P>
When the women came back with the clothes, Turlington had left
the room. Their promised reward lay waiting for them on the
table, and Thomas Wildfang was eager to dress himself and be
gone. They could get but one answer from him to every question
they put. He had business in hand, which was not to be delayed.
They would see him again in a day or two, with money in his
purse. With that assurance he took his cudgel from the corner of
the room, and stalked out swiftly by the back door of the house
into the night.
