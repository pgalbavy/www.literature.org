				<h3>Site Update - August 2021 - Downloads are here!</h3>
			</div>

			<div class="w3-container">
				<p>
					It's been a quiet time for us at literature.org but recently we've added a selection of new books
					for your to enjoy and also the first version of a new download feature!
					Look for the Download icon on the contents page of each book (like this: <i
						class="material-icons ml-lit">cloud_download</i>) and this will build an EPub file for you to
					download to your device.
				</p>
				<p>
					These EPub files are built dynamically entirely in your browser from the files on the web-site and
					so if you see any problems then please check that your browser is a modern one that supports HTML5
					and so on. All popular browsers do right now, as long as you keep them updated. If you are
					unfortunate enough to still be using IE then it will not work.
				</p>
				<p>
					We're working on adding other formats such as Mobi so that you can download books to a wider range
					of readers, including Kindle devices, but EPub was the most straight forward to implement as it's an
					open standard based on web technologies. Mobi (and Amazon's Kindle formats) are less
					straightforward. You can always convert the EPub files yourself in something like the excellent
					Calibre application.

				<h3>Site Update - June 2020</h3>
			</div>

			<div class="w3-container">
				<p>We've made further improvements to the site and we would like to hear your comments. Just drop us an
					email
					at <a href="mailto:contact@literature.org">contact@literature.org</a>. Some of the changes include:
				</p>
				<ul class="w3-ul w3-card-4">
					<li style="font-size: initial;"><i class="material-icons ml-lit">check</i> Links to online
						biographies and other sites for authors and their books. This is still being filled out.</li>
					<li style="font-size: initial;"><i class="material-icons ml-lit">check</i> The lists of authors and
						books will now display in one, two or three columns depending on your screen size</li>
					<li style="font-size: initial;"><i class="material-icons ml-lit">check</i> On a mobile phone, tablet
						or other touchscreen device you can swipe left and right to move between chapters in a book</li>
					<li style="font-size: initial;"><i class="material-icons ml-lit">check</i> More books (of course!)
					</li>

				<h3>Site Update - May 2020</h3>
			</div>

			<div class="w3-container">
				<p>This site fell off the Internet a few years ago after some embarrassing oversights and confusion
					around backups. Don't let this happen to you! Be more careful than we were.</p>
				<p>The original site contents have now been mostly rescued with the wonderful help of
					<a href="https://archive.org/web/">The Wayback Machine</a> and this
					<a href="https://github.com/hartator/wayback-machine-downloader">Wayback Machine Downloader</a>.
					Thanks to all those who provide these great tools for free.
				</p>

				<p>After some work and lots of learning about how web technologies have evolved we can
					present this new version of the site. The aim has been to update the look of the site to
					give it a more modern feel, to make it work well on different device types and to improve navigation
					through the library.</p>

				<p>For those interested all the changes are on the client side and based on
					<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp">W3.CSS</a>. We have tried to keep the
					client-side
					scripting as simple as possible and to avoid large frameworks. We hope that the behind the scenes
					changes
					will also make it more straightforward to update and add new books.
				</p>

				<p>There will be continual improvements where possible to your experience and any suggestions are more
					than welcome, even if we cannot promise to act on them.</p>
