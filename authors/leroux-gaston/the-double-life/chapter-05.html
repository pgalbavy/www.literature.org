<p><em>THEOPHRASTE </em>sang the song in loud, strident tones,
his eyes sparkling, glass in hand. It was with indescribable surprise
that the company received it, and despite the richness of the
rhyme, the couplet was followed by no applause. An awkward silence
followed, and all the ladies looked to Marceline for an explanation.</p>

<p>What was it that Marceline could explain? Adolphe himself looked
at Théophraste in surprise; but Théophraste, as if possessed with
the devil, continued with the second couplet of the drinking song.
When he had finished, he sat down, looked around with satisfaction,
and said to Marceline, "What do you think of that, Marie Antoinette?"</p>

<p>In the midst of a death-like silence preserved by all, Marceline
asked tremblingly, "Why do you call me Marie Antoinette?"</p>

<p>"Because you are the most beautiful of all!" cried Théophraste.
"I appeal to Madame la Marechale de Bouilleurs, who has taste.
I appeal to all of you. And there is not one who, by the signet
of the Pope, will contradict me, neither the Eros Picards, nor
the Bourbons, nor the Burgundias, nor the Provincials, nor the
Poet St. Jack, nor Gatelard, nor Bras-de-Fer, nor Guente Noir,
not even Bal-a-voir."</p>

<p>M. Théophraste had on his right old Mlle. Tabouret, and he pinched
her knee as he looked at Marceline, which nearly made that austere
person faint. No one dared to move; for the fiery look of Théophraste
frightened the whole company. He leaned amorously towards Mlle.
Tabouret, and said to her, staring at Marceline, who was by this
time weeping: "Let us see, Mlle. Tabouret, am I not right? To
whom can I compare her? Is it La Belle Laitere, or La Petite Minion;
or even La Blanche of the bowling alley; or La Belle Helene, who
kept the Harp Tavern?"</p>

<p>Turning towards Adolphe, he said with great energy, "Come you,
Va-de-Bon Cœur, tell me your opinion. Look at Marie Antoinette
a little while. By the fatted calf, she puts them all in the shade:
Jeannette, the flower girl of the Royal Palace; Marie Leroy and
the female Solomon, the beauty of the Temple; Jeanne Bonnefoy,
who kept the café of the Port Marie; Manon de Versailles, the
poultry girl—none of them approach her in beauty."</p>

<p>He then leapt with one bound upon the table, and breaking the
dishes, cups and plates into a thousand pieces, held his glass
over his head and shouted, "Let us drink to the Queen of the Nymphs,
Marie Antoinette."</p>

<p>Draining his glass, he smashed it against the table and waved
his hand, which was covered with blood. By this time the party
had fled in terror, fearing that some tragedy would follow Théophraste’s
strange behavior. On superficially thinking of these curious actions
one would immediately conclude that he had gone mad or was drunk,
but this was not the case. There is another kind of sense beside
common sense. It was not because he was crazy or drunk that he
could sing a song that he had never learnt, speak a language that
he had never heard, or refer to people that he had never read
about, who had been dead for centuries. There must have been some
other force working in his brain.</p>

<p>Modern scientific experiments have shown with indisputable examples
that this particular case was far from unique. Ignorant people,
who neither knew how to read or write, who had never been outside
their village, have been known to give most correct answers to
the medium who questioned them in a dead language. And this has
been before professors of colleges, not before charlatans. It
is difficult to explain. It is the mystery of this life, the life
hereafter. Some say that it is a learned spirit talking through
these ignorant mouths, others have timidly expressed the opinion
that such phenomena can only be explained by the remembrance of
a former life. Therefore the things which Théophraste said and
did without understanding, the Other who relives in him at intervals
understands perfectly well, and if we would understand them we
must know who this Other is.</p>

<p>As to Théophraste, after the guests had disappeared from the
tent, he climbed down from the table. He found it more difficult
to reach the floor than it had been to climb upon the table, and
he knelt down, taking great precaution not to fall. He then assumed
his natural self and called Marceline. She did not answer him,
and in searching for her he found her trembling with fright in
her room. He closed the door carefully and prepared to give an
explanation. She looked at him with her large eyes, amazed, filled
with tears, and he felt it his duty as a husband not to conceal
from her any longer this extraordinary phenomenon which had been
preoccupying his mind.</p>

<p>The night was ideal, and after they had retired he said to her,
"My dear Marceline, you cannot understand what has happened to
me this evening, and I can assure you I don’t understand myself,
but in telling you all I know perhaps we can arrive at some conclusion."</p>

<p>He then related all the details of his visits to the cellars
of the Conciergerie. He concealed nothing, and sketched in minute
details the extraordinary feelings which had actuated him that
evening, and the unknown influence which had commanded him. At
first she said nothing, but softly moved away from him as if afraid
of him; but when he came to the document which revealed the existence
of the treasures, she demanded to see it at once. He judged then
that she was taking an interest in the adventure and felt thankful.
They got up and he showed her the paper in the light of the full
moon, which was streaming into the room. Like all those who had
seen it before, she recognized the handwriting immediately, and
made the sign of the cross as if fearing some sorcery. Marceline
was not a fool, but explained that she could not help making the
sign. However, she soon became composed, and began to praise Adolphe,
who, in spite of Théophraste’s disapproval, had initiated her
into the elements of spiritualism, a science she said which would
be of some service to Théophraste in his condition. But even in
the face of that uncontestable evidence she found it difficult
to believe that he was a reincarnated spirit dating back two hundred
years, until he asked her who she thought he had been.</p>

<p>Marceline didn’t think that he had been a very great personage,
and in reply to his disappointed inquiry she said:</p>

<p>"Because this evening you sang in slang, and the ladies whose
names you mentioned do not belong to the aristocracy. People who
frequented La Terpidere, La Platire, Manon de Versailles, I think
are not of much account."</p>

<p>"But I also mentioned the leader of the Bouffleurs," replied
Théophraste, "and you know that morals were so dissolute under
the Regency of the Duke of Orleans that the fashion at Court was
to call the ladies in slighting terms. What do you think of the
idea of me being the Bastard of the Regent?"</p>

<p>For sole response she embraced Théophraste in delight, and recollecting
his duty on this day of celebration proved to her that if he was
more than two hundred years old, his love always remained youthful.</p>
