Mr. McAdam, of the firm of McAdam and Squire, was a
highly polished man who dwelt behind a highly polished
table in the neatest and snuggest of offices.  He was
white-haired and amiable, with a deep-lined aquiline
face, was addicted to low bows, and indeed, always seemed
to carry himself at half-cock, as though just descending
into one, or just recovering himself.  He wore a
high-buckled stock, took snuff, and adorned his
conversation with little scraps from the classics.
<P>
"My dear Sir," said he, when he had listened to their
story, "any friend of Mrs. Westmacott's is a friend of
mine.  Try a pinch.  I wonder that you should have gone
to this man Metaxa.  His advertisement is enough to
condemn him.  Habet foenum in cornu.  They are all
rogues."
<P>
"The doctor was a rogue too.  I didn't like the look
of him at the time."
<P>
"Arcades ambo.  But now we must see what we can do
for you.  Of course what Metaxa said was perfectly right. 
The pension is in itself no security at all, unless it
were accompanied by a life assurance which would be
an income in itself.  It is no good whatever."
<P>
His clients' faces fell.
<P>
"But there is the second alternative.  You might sell
the pension right out.  Speculative investors
occasionally deal in such things.  I have one client, a
sporting man, who would be very likely to take it up if
we could agree upon terms.  Of course, I must follow
Metaxa's example by sending for a doctor."
<P>
For the second time was the Admiral punched and
tapped and listened to.  This time, however, there could
be no question of the qualifications of the doctor, a
well-known Fellow of the College of Surgeons, and his
report was as favorable as the other's had been adverse.
<P>
"He has the heart and chest of a man of forty," said
he.  "I can recommend his life as one of the best of his
age that I have ever examined."
<P>
"That's well," said Mr. McAdam, making a note of the
doctor's remarks, while the Admiral disbursed a second
guinea.  "Your price, I understand, is five thousand
pounds.  I can communicate with Mr. Elberry, my client,
and let you know whether he cares to touch the matter. 
Meanwhile you can leave your pension papers here, and I
will give you a receipt for them."
<P>
"Very well.  I should like the money soon."
<P>
"That is why I am retaining the papers.  If I
can see Mr. Elberry to-day we may let you have a cheque
to-morrow.  Try another pinch.  No?  Well, good-bye.  I
am very happy to have been of service."  Mr. McAdam bowed
them out, for he was a very busy man, and they found
themselves in the street once more with lighter hearts
than when they bad left it.
<P>
"Well, Westmacott, I am sure I am very much obliged
to you," said the Admiral.  "You have stood by me when I
was the better for a little help, for I'm clean out of my
soundings among these city sharks.  But I've something to
do now which is more in my own line, and I need not
trouble you any more."
<P>
"Oh, it is no trouble.  I have nothing to do.  I
never have anything to do.  I don't suppose I could do it
if I had.  I should be delighted to come with you, sir,
if I can be of any use."
<P>
"No, no, my lad.  You go home again.  It would be
kind of you, though, if you would look in at number one
when you get back and tell my wife that all's well with
me, and that I'll be back in an hour or so."
<P>
"All right, sir.  I'll tell her."  Westmacott raised
his hat and strode away to the westward, while the
Admiral, after a hurried lunch, bent his steps towards
the east.
<P>
It was a long walk, but the old seaman swung along at
a rousing pace, leaving street after street behind him. 
The great business places dwindled down into
commonplace shops and dwellings, which decreased and
became more stunted, even as the folk who filled them
did, until he was deep in the evil places of the eastern
end.  It was a land of huge, dark houses and of garish
gin-shops, a land, too, where life moves irregularly and
where adventures are to be gained--as the Admiral was to
learn to his cost.
<P>
He was hurrying down one of the long, narrow,
stone-flagged lanes between the double lines of
crouching, disheveled women and of dirty children who sat
on the hollowed steps of the houses, and basked in the
autumn sun.  At one side was a barrowman with a load of
walnuts, and beside the barrow a bedraggled woman with a
black fringe and a chequered shawl thrown over her head. 
She was cracking walnuts and picking them out of the
shells, throwing out a remark occasionally to a rough man
in a rabbit-skin cap, with straps under the knees of his
corduroy trousers, who stood puffing a black clay pipe
with his back against the wall.  What the cause of the
quarrel was, or what sharp sarcasm from the woman's lips
pricked suddenly through that thick skin may never be
known, but suddenly the man took his pipe in his left
hand, leaned forward, and deliberately struck her across
the face with his right.  It was a slap rather than a
blow, but the woman gave a sharp cry and cowered up
against the barrow with her hand to her cheek.
<P>
"You infernal villain!" cried the Admiral, raising
his stick.  "You brute and blackguard!"
<P>
"Garn!" growled the rough, with the deep rasping
intonation of a savage.  "Garn out o' this or I'll----" 
He took a step forward with uplifted hand, but in an
instant down came cut number three upon his wrist, and
cut number five across his thigh, and cut number one 
full in the center of his rabbit-skin cap.  It was not a
heavy stick, but it was strong enough to leave a good red
weal wherever it fell.  The rough yelled with pain, and
rushed in, hitting with both hands, and kicking with his
iron-shod boots, but the Admiral had still a quick foot
and a true eye, so that he bounded backwards and
sideways, still raining a shower, of blows upon his
savage antagonist.  Suddenly, however, a pair of arms
closed round his neck, and glancing backwards he caught
a glimpse of the black coarse fringe of the woman whom he
had befriended, "I've got him!" she shrieked.  "I'll 'old
'im.  Now, Bill, knock the tripe out of him!"  Her grip
was as strong as a man's, and her wrist pressed like an
iron bar upon the Admiral's throat.  He made a
desperate effort to disengage himself, but the most that
he could do was to swing her round, so as to place her
between his adversary and himself.  As it proved, it
was the very best thing that he could have done.  The
rough, half-blinded and maddened by the blows which he
had received, struck out with all his ungainly strength,
just as his partner's head swung round in front of him. 
There was a noise like that of a stone hitting a wall, a
deep groan, her grasp relaxed, and she dropped a dead
weight upon the pavement, while the Admiral sprang back
and raised his stick once more, ready either for attack
or defense.  Neither were needed, however, for at that
moment there was a scattering of the crowd, and two
police constables, burly and helmeted, pushed their way
through the rabble.  At the sight of them the rough took
to his heels, and was instantly screened from view by a
veil of his friends and neighbors.
<P>
"I have been assaulted," panted the Admiral.  "This
woman was attacked and I had to defend her."
<P>
"This is Bermondsey Sal," said one police officer,
bending over the bedraggled heap of tattered shawl and
dirty skirt.  "She's got it hot this time."
<P>
"He was a shortish man, thick, with a beard."
<P>
"Ah, that's Black Davie.  He's been up four times for
beating her.  He's about done the job now.  If I were you
I would let that sort settle their own little affairs,
sir."
<P>
"Do you think that a man who holds the Queen's
commission will stand by and see a woman struck?" cried
the Admiral indignantly.
<P>
"Well, just as you like, sir.  But you've lost your
watch, I see."
<P>
"My watch!"  He clapped his hand to his waistcoat. 
The chain was hanging down in front, and the watch gone.
<P>
He passed his hand over his forehead.  "I would not
have lost that watch for anything," said he.  "No money
could replace it.  It was given me by the ship's company
after our African cruise.  It has an inscription."
<P>
The policeman shrugged his shoulders.  "It comes from
meddling," said he.
<P>
"What'll you give me if I tell yer where it is?" said
a sharp-faced boy among the crowd.  "Will you gimme a
quid?"
<P>
"Certainly."
<P>
"Well, where's the quid?"
<P>
The Admiral took a sovereign from his pocket.  "Here
it is."
<P>
"Then 'ere's the ticker!"  The boy pointed to the
clenched hand of the senseless woman.  A glimmer of gold
shone out from between the fingers, and on opening them
up, there was the Admiral's chronometer.  This
interesting victim had throttled her protector with one
hand, while she had robbed him with the other.
<P>
The Admiral left his address with the policeman,
satisfied that the woman was only stunned, not dead,
and then set off upon his way once more, the poorer
perhaps in his faith in human nature, but in very good
spirits none the less.  He walked with dilated nostrils
and clenched hands, all glowing and tingling with the
excitement of the combat, and warmed with the thought
that he could still, when there was need, take his own
part in a street brawl in spite of his three-score and
odd years.
<P>
His way now led towards the river-side regions, and
a cleansing whiff of tar was to be detected in the
stagnant autumn air.  Men with the blue jersey and peaked
cap of the boatman, or the white ducks of the dockers,
began to replace the cardurys and fustian of the
laborers.  Shops with nautical instruments in the
windows, rope and paint sellers, and slop shops with long
rows of oilskins dangling from hooks, all proclaimed the
neighborhood of the docks.  The Admiral quickened his
pace and straightened his figure as his surroundings
became more nautical, until at last, peeping between two
high, dingy wharfs, he caught a glimpse of the
mud-colored waters of the Thames, and of the bristle of
masts and funnels which rose from its broad bosom.  To
the right lay a quiet street, with many brass plates upon
either side, and wire blinds in all of the windows.  The
Admiral walked slowly down it until "The Saint Lawrence
Shipping Company" caught his eye.  He crossed the
road, pushed open the door, and found himself in a
low-ceilinged office, with a long counter at one end and
a great number of wooden sections of ships stuck upon
boards and plastered all over the walls.
<P>
"Is Mr. Henry in?" asked the Admiral.
<P>
"No, sir," answered an elderly man from a high seat
in the corner.  "He has not come into town to-day.  I can
manage any business you may wish seen to."
<P>
"You don't happen to have a first or second officer's
place vacant, do you?"
<P>
The manager looked with a dubious eye at his singular
applicant.
<P>
"Do you hold certificates?" he asked.
<P>
"I hold every nautical certificate there is."
<P>
"Then you won't do for us."
<P>
"Why not?"
<P>
"Your age, sir.
<P>
"I give you my word that I can see as well as ever,
and am as good a man in every way."
<P>
"I don't doubt it."
<P>
"Why should my age be a bar, then?"
<P>
"Well, I must put it plainly.  If a man of your age,
holding certificates, has not got past a second officer's
berth, there must be a black mark against him somewhere. 
I don't know what it is, drink or temper, or want of
judgment, but something there must be."
<P>
"I assure you there is nothing, but I find myself
stranded, and so have to turn to the old business again."
<P>
"Oh, that's it," said the manager, with suspicion in
his eye.  "How long were you in your last billet?"
<P>
"Fifty-one years."
<P>
"What!"
<P>
"Yes, sir, one-and-fifty years."
<P>
"In the same employ?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"Why, you must have begun as a child."
<P>
"I was twelve when I joined."
<P>
"It must be a strangely managed business," said the
manager, "which allows men to leave it who have served
for fifty years, and who are still as good as ever.  Who
did you serve?"
<P>
"The Queen.  Heaven bless her!"
<P>
"Oh, you were in the Royal Navy.  What rating did you
hold?"
<P>
"I am Admiral of the Fleet."
<P>
The manager started, and sprang down from his high
stool.
<P>
"My name is Admiral Hay Denver.  There is my card. 
And here are the records of my service.  I don't, you
understand, want to push another man from his billet; but
if you should chance to have a berth open, I should be
very glad of it.  I know the navigation from the Cod
Banks right up to Montreal a great deal better than I
know the streets of London."
<P>
The astonished manager glanced over the blue papers
which his visitor had handed him.  "Won't you take a
chair, Admiral?" said he.
<P>
"Thank you!  But I should be obliged if you would
drop my title now.  I told you because you asked me, but
I've left the quarter-deck, and I am plain Mr. Hay Denver
now."
<P>
"May I ask," said the manager, "are you the same
Denver who commanded at one time on the North American
station?"
<P>
"I did."
<P>
"Then it was you who got one of our boats, the
Comus, off the rocks in the Bay of Fundy?  The
directors voted you three hundred guineas as salvage, and
you refused them."
<P>
"It was an offer which should not have been made,"
said the Admiral sternly.
<P>
"Well, it reflects credit upon you that you should
think so.  If Mr. Henry were here I am sure that he would
arrange this matter for you at once.  As it is, I shall
lay it before the directors to-day, and I am sure that
they will be proud to have you in our employment, and, I
hope, in some more suitable position than that which you
suggest."
<P>
"I am very much obliged to you, sir," said the
Admiral, and started off again, well pleased, upon his
homeward journey.
