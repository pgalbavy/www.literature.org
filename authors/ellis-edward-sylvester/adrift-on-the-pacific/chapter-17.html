<p>Captain Bergen and Abe Storms, as may be supposed, greeted each
other ardently when the latter stepped upon the deck of the schooner,
clad in his diving-suit.</p>

<p>"I was growing very anxious about you," said the captain, "for
I could not understand what kept you away so long."</p>

<p>The eccentric New Englander, removing his headgear, but leaving
the rest of his armor on, laughed and asked:</p>

<p>"Tell me what took place after I went down."</p>

<p>The captain hurriedly related his experience, which has been
already told the reader.</p>

<p>"We took a good deal of risk, as you know," said the mate, "and
when I went down in the water, I was a great deal more uneasy
than I seemed to be. I was expecting a signal from you, and when
it did not come I started for the surface. The shore is rough
and craggy, you know, so that it was something like climbing up
stairs.</p>

<p>"Well, I had got pretty well up when the pipes were cut. I understood
what it meant, and, holding my breath, with the water rushing
down the two hose-pipes, I scrambled for the top.</p>

<p>"It may have been a perilous thing for you that the rascals pursued
you with such enthusiasm, but it was fortunate for me, for, although
I had a dry revolver under my armor, it was several minutes before
I was in a condition to use it.</p>

<p>"As soon as possible, however, I made ready, believing you were
in sore need of help. Crawling forward on my hands and knees,
I took a quick look over the bank, and saw you and Inez walking
off in the direction of the schooner, with the three scamps sullenly
watching you.</p>

<p>"I suspected what you tell me was the truth, and I was on the
point of rushing forward and making short work of them with my
revolver, but it flashed upon me that they possessed a fearful
advantage over us. Redvignez and Brazzier are as cunning as serpents,
and one of them, more than likely, would have caught up the little
girl and held her in front of him as a screen.</p>

<p>"Inez would have proved an effectual armor, indeed, and, with
her in their possession, they would have been masters of the situation,
and could have dictated whatever terms they chose to us. Pomp
would have been transformed into a bitter enemy at once, and the
chances of disaster to us all were so great that I remained quiet,
but watchful, ready to dash forward to your assistance should
it become necessary.</p>

<p>"I lay down in a secluded place to rest, when&mdash;shall I confess
it? &mdash;I fell asleep, and did not wake up until half an hour
ago. After thinking the matter over, I decided still to deceive
the rascals. I was quite certain that the water in the lagoon
was not very deep, so I fastened the upper ends of the hose to
floats, and walked out here on the bottom."</p>

<p>"Did you see anything of them?"</p>

<p>"No; I don't know where they are; but you can feel sure they'll
never take their eyes off the schooner."</p>

<p>After further discussing the exciting events of the day, they
considered the all-important question as to what should be their
own line of action. The decision which they reached was a most
remarkable one, being no less than to make a direct proposition
to the mutineers to turn over the schooner to them, with a portion
of the oysters, and to allow them to depart, while the captain,
mate and little girl were left upon the island.</p>

<p>The captain was not convinced that this was altogether wise,
and he said:</p>

<p>"Since your plan is for us to stay on the island, and allow them
to leave with the schooner, will you tell me how we are to depart,
when ready?"</p>

<p>The mate indicated the inlet, where the mast was still pointing
toward the sky.</p>

<p>"We've got to run our chances. We may be taken off in a week,
and possibly not for years; but, with all these probabilities
before us, I am in favor of surrendering the schooner, and allowing
them to leave us forever, if they will agree to do so."</p>

<p>"But, if we make the proposition, will they not suspect our purpose,
or take it as a confession of weakness on our part?"</p>

<p>"We must prevent that. But, captain, I've had all the sleep I
want, and you are in need of it. Better secure it, therefore,
while you can. Go below in the cabin and take your rest. I will
stand guard here, and you need have no fear of my dropping into
slumber again."</p>

<p>The captain remained some time longer, and even then was loth
to leave, but he consented to do so, and finally descended into
the cabin, where he threw himself upon his hammock without removing
his clothes.</p>

<p>The incidents of the day were exciting enough to keep him awake,
and, despite the exhaustion of his body, he lay a long time before
he closed his eyes in slumber. Even then his sleep was haunted
by horrible dreams, in which he lived over again the scenes through
which he had passed, when, but for the piteous pleadings of little
Inez, he would have fallen a victim to the ferocity of the mutineers,
and he awoke more than once with a gasp and a start, which showed
how disturbed his mind was.</p>

<p>He had not slept long when he suddenly awoke again, and looked
around in the gloom. The lamp overhead had been extinguished,
and he was in utter darkness, though the silvery glow of the moonlight
outside was perceptible through the windows and partly-open door.
He could hear the dull booming of the breakers on the outside
of the atoll, but all else was quiet, except the gentle breathing
of Inez, in the berth beneath his.</p>

<p>"God protect her and us all!" he prayed, his heart, in the solemn
stillness and solitude, ascending to the only being who could
assist him and his friend in their dire extremity; for Captain
Bergen was sure that no one could be placed in greater peril than
were he and Abe Storms, so long as they remained among the Pearl
Islands.</p>
