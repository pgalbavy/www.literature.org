<p>An hour later the captain Abdullah might have been seen walking
carelessly towards the tent where the brethren slept. Also, had
there been any who cared to watch, something else might have been
seen in that low moonlight, for now the storm and the heavy rain
which followed it had passed. Namely, the fat shape of the eunuch
Mesrour, slipping after him wrapped in a dark camel-hair cloak,
such as was commonly worn by camp followers, and taking shelter
cunningly behind every rock and shrub and rise of the ground.
Hidden among some picketed dromedaries, he saw Abdullah enter the
tent of the brethren, then, waiting till a cloud crossed the
moon, Mesrour ran to it unseen, and throwing himself down on its
shadowed side, lay there like a drunken man, and listened with
all his ears. But the thick canvas was heavy with wet, nor would
the ropes and the trench that was dug around permit him, who did
not love to lie in the water, to place his head against it. Also,
those within spoke low, and he could only hear single words, such
as "garden," "the star," "princess."
</p>
<p>So important did these seem to him, however, that at length
Mesrour crept under the cords, and although he shuddered at its
cold, drew his body into the trench of water, and with the sharp
point of his knife cut a little slit in the taut canvas. To this
he set his eye, only to find that it served him nothing, for
there was no light in the tent. Still, men were there who talked
in the darkness.
</p><p>"Good," said a voice--it was that of one of the brethren, but
which he could not tell, for even to those who knew them best
they seemed to be the same. "Good; then it is settled. To-morrow,
at the hour arranged, you bring the princess to the place agreed
upon, disguised as you have said. In payment for this service I
hand you the Luck of Hassan which you covet. Take it; here it is,
and swear to do your part, since otherwise it will bring no luck
to you, for I will kill you the first time we meet--yes, and the
other also."
</p><p>"I swear it by Allah and his prophet," answered Abdullah in a
hoarse, trembling voice.
</p><p>"It is enough; see that you keep the oath. And now away; it is
not safe that you should tarry here."
</p><p>Then came the sound of a man leaving the tent. Passing round it
cautiously, he halted, and opening his hand, looked at its
contents to make sure that no trick had been played upon him in
the darkness. Mesrour screwed his head round to look also, and
saw the light gleam faintly on the surface of the splendid jewel,
which he, too, desired so eagerly. In so doing his foot struck a
stone, and instantly Abdullah glanced down to see a dead or
drunken man lying almost at his feet. With a swift movement he
hid the jewel and started to walk away. Then bethinking him that
it would be well to make sure that this fellow was dead or
sleeping, he turned and kicked the prostrate Mesrour upon the
back and with all his strength. Indeed, he did this thrice,
putting the eunuch to the greatest agony.
</p><p>"I thought I saw him move," Abdullah muttered after the third
kick; "it is best to make sure," and he drew his knife.
</p><p>Now, had not terror paralysed him, Mesrour would have cried out,
but fortunately for himself, before he found his voice Abdullah
had buried the knife three inches deep in his fat thigh. With an
effort Mesrour bore this also, knowing that if he showed signs of
life the next stroke would be in his heart. Then, satisfied that
this fellow, whoever he might be, was either a corpse or
insensible, Abdullah drew out the knife, wiped it on his victim's
robe, and departed.
</p><p>Not long afterwards Mesrour departed also, towards the Sultan's
house, bellowing with rage and pain and vowing vengeance.
</p><p>It was not long delayed.
</p><p>That very night Abdullah was seized and put to the question. In
his suffering he confessed that he had been to the tent of the
brethren and received from one of them the jewel which was found
upon him, as a bribe to bring the princess to a certain garden
outside the camp. But he named the wrong garden. Further, when
they asked which of the brethren it was who bribed him, he said
he did not know, as their voices were alike, and their tent was
in darkness; moreover, that he believed there was only one man in
it--at least he heard or saw no other. He added that he was
summoned to the tent by an Arab man whom he had never seen
before, but who told him that if he wished for what he most
desired and good fortune, he was to be there at a certain hour
after sunset. Then he fainted, and was put back in prison till
the morning by the command of Saladin.
</p><p>When the morning came Abdullah was dead, who desired no more
torments with doom at the end of them, having made shift to
strangle himself with his robe. But first he had scrawled upon
the wall with a piece of charcoal:
</p><p>"May that accursed Star of Hassan which tempted me bring better
luck to others, and may hell receive the soul of Mesrour."
</p><p>Thus died Abdullah, as faithful as he could be in such sore
straits, since he had betrayed neither Masouda nor his son, both
of whom were in the plot, and said that only one of the brethren
was present in the tent, whereas he knew well that the two of
them were there and which of these spoke and gave him the jewel.
</p><p>Very early that morning the brethren, who were lying wakeful,
heard sounds without their tent, and looking out saw that it was
surrounded by Mameluks.
</p><p>"The plot is discovered," said Godwin to Wulf quietly, but with
despair in his face. "Now, my brother, admit nothing, even under
torture, lest others perish with us."
</p><p>"Shall we fight?" asked Wulf as they threw on their mail.
</p><p>But Godwin answered:
</p><p>"Nay, it would serve us nothing to kill a few brave men."
</p><p>Then an officer entered the tent, and commanded them to give up
their swords and to follow him to Saladin to answer a charge that
had been laid against them both, nor would he say any more. So
they went as prisoners, and after waiting awhile, were ushered
into a large room of the house where Saladin lodged, which was
arranged as a court with a dais at one end. Before this they were
stood, till presently the Sultan entered through the further
door, and with him certain of his emirs and secretaries. Also
Rosamund, who looked very pale, was brought there, and in
attendance on her Masouda, calm-faced as ever.
</p><p>The brethren bowed to them, but Saladin, whose eyes were full of
rage, took no notice of their salutation. For a moment there was
silence, then Saladin bade a secretary read the charge, which was
brief. It was that they had conspired to steal away the princess
of Baalbec.
</p><p>"Where is the evidence against us?" asked Godwin boldly. "The
Sultan is just, and convicts no man save on testimony."
</p><p>Again Saladin motioned to the secretary, who read the words that
had been taken down from the lips of the captain Abdullah. They
demanded to be allowed to examine the captain Abdullah, and
learned that he was already dead. Then the eunuch Mesrour was
carried forward, for walk he could not, owing to the wound that
Abdullah had given him, and told all his tale, how he had
suspected Abdullah, and, following him, had heard him and one of
the brethren speaking in the tent, and the words that passed,
and afterwards seen Abdullah with the jewel in his hand.
</p><p>When he had finished Godwin asked which of them he had heard
speaking with Abdullah, and he answered that he could not say, as
their voices were so alike, but one voice only had spoken.
</p><p>Then Rosamund was ordered to give her testimony, and said, truly
enough, that she knew nothing of the plot and had not thought of
this flight. Masouda also swore that she now heard of it for the
first time. After this the secretary announced that there was no
more evidence, and prayed of the Sultan to give judgment in the
matter.
</p><p>"Against which of us," asked Godwin, "seeing that both the dead
and the living witness declared they heard but one voice, and
whose that voice was they did not know? According to your own
law, you cannot condemn a man against whom there is no good
testimony."
</p><p>"There is testimony against one of you," answered Saladin
sternly, "that of two witnesses, as is required, and, as I have
warned you long ago, that man shall die. Indeed, both of you
should die, for I am sure that both are guilty. Still, you have
been put upon your trial according to the law, and as a just
judge I will not strain the law against you. Let the guilty one
die by beheading at sundown, the hour at which he planned to
commit his crime. The other may go free with the citizens of
Jerusalem who depart to-night, bearing my message to the Frankish
leaders in that holy town."
</p><p>"Which of us, then, is to die, and which to go free?" asked
Godwin. "Tell us, that he who is doomed may prepare his soul."
</p><p>"Say you, who know the truth," answered Saladin.
</p><p>"We admit nothing," said Godwin; "yet, if one of us must die, I
as the elder claim that right."
</p><p>"And I claim it as the younger. The jewel was Hassan's gift to
me; who else could give it to Abdullah?" added Wulf, speaking for
the first time, whereat all the Saracens there assembled, brave
men who loved a knightly deed, murmured in admiration, and even
Saladin said:
</p><p>"Well spoken, both of you. So it seems that both must die."
</p><p>Then Rosamund stepped forward and threw herself upon her knees
before him, exclaiming:
</p><p>"Sire, my uncle, such is not your justice, that two should be
slain for the offence of one, if offence there be. If you know
not which is guilty, spare them both, I beseech you."
</p><p>He stretched out his hand and raised her from her knees: then
thought awhile, and said:
</p><p>"Nay, plead not with me, for however much you love him the
guilty man must suffer, as he deserves. But of this matter Allah
alone knows the truth, therefore let it be decided by Allah," and
he rested his head upon his hand, looking at Wulf and Godwin as
though to read their souls.
</p><p>Now behind Saladin stood that old and famous imaum who had been
with him and Hassan when he commanded the brethren to depart from
Damascus, who all this while had listened to everything that
passed with a sour smile. Leaning forward, he whispered in his
master's ear, who considered a moment, then answered him:
</p><p>"It is good. Do so."
</p><p>So the imaum left the court, and returned presently carrying two
small boxes of sandalwood tied with silk and sealed, so like each
other that none could tell them apart, which boxes he passed
continually from his right hand to his left and from his left
hand to his right, then gave them to Saladin.
</p><p>"In one of these," said the Sultan, "is that jewel known as the
enchanted Star and the Luck of the House of Hassan, which the
prince presented to his conqueror on the day of Hattin, and for
the desire of which my captain Abdullah became a traitor and was
brought to death. In the other is a pebble of the same weight.
Come, my niece, take you these boxes and give them to your
kinsmen, to each the box you will. The jewel that is called the
Star of Hassan is magical, and has virtue, so they say. Let it
choose, therefore, which of these knights is ripe for death, and
let him perish in whose box the Star is found."
</p><p>"Now," muttered the imaum into the ear of his master, "now at
length we shall learn which it is of these two men that the lady
loves."
</p><p>"That is what I seek to know," answered Saladin in the same low
voice.
</p><p>As she heard this decree Rosamund looked round wildly and
pleaded:
</p><p>"Oh! be not so cruel. I beseech you spare me this task. Let it be
another hand that is chosen to deal death to one of those of my
own blood with whom I have dwelt since childhood. Let me not be
the blind sword of fate that frees his spirit, lest it should
haunt my dreams and turn all my world to woe. Spare me, I beseech
you."
</p><p>But Saladin looked at her very sternly and answered:
</p><p>"Princess, you know why I have brought you to the East and raised
you to great honour here, why also I have made you my companion
in these wars. It is for my dream's sake, the dream which told me
that by some noble act of yours you should save the lives of
thousands. Yet I am sure that you desire to escape, and plots are
made to take you from me, though of these plots you say that you
and your woman"--and he looked darkly at Masouda--"know nothing.
But these men know, and it is right that you, for whose sake if
not by whose command the thing was done, should mete out its
reward, and that the blood of him whom you appoint, which is
spilt for you, should be on your and no other head. Now do my
bidding."
</p><p>For a moment Rosamund stared at the boxes, then suddenly she
closed her eyes, and taking them up at hazard, stretched out her
arms, leaning forward over the edge of the dais. Thereon, calmly
enough the brethren took, each of them, the box that was nearest
to him, that in Rosamund's left hand falling to Godwin and that
in her right to Wulf. Then she opened her eyes again, stood
still, and watched.
</p><p>"Cousin," said Godwin, "before we break this cord that is our
chain of doom, know well that, whatever chances, we blame you not
at all. It is God Who acts through you, and you are as innocent
of the death of either of us as of that plot whereof we stand
accused."
</p><p>Then he began to unknot the silk which was bound about his box.
Wulf, knowing that it would tell all the tale, did not trouble
himself as yet, but looked around the room, thinking that,
whether he lived or died, never would he see a stranger sight.
Every eye in it was fixed upon the box in Godwin's hand; even
Saladin stared as though it held his own destiny. No; not every
one, for those of the old imaum were fixed upon the face of
Rosamund, which was piteous to see, for all its beauty had left
it, and even her parted lips were ashy. Masouda alone still
stood upright and unmoved, as though she watched some play, but
he noted that her rich-hued cheek grew pale and that beneath her
robe her hand was pressed upon her heart. The silence also was
intense, and broken only by the little grating noise of Godwin's
nails as, having no knife to cut it, he patiently untied the
silk.
</p><p>"Trouble enough about one man's life in a land where lives are
cheap!" exclaimed Wulf, thinking aloud, and at the sound of his
voice all men started, as though it had thundered suddenly in a
summer sky. Then with a laugh he tore the silk about his box
asunder with his strong fingers, and breaking the seal, shook out
its contents. Lo! there on the floor before him, gleaming green
and white with emerald and diamond, lay the enchanted Star of
Hassan.
</p><p>Masouda saw, and the colour crept back to her cheek. Rosamund saw
also, and nature was too strong for her, for in one bitter cry
the truth broke from her lips at last:
</p><p>"Not Wulf! Not Wulf!" she wailed, and sank back senseless into
Masouda's arms.
</p><p>"Now, sire," said the old imaum with a chuckle, "you know which
of those two the lady loves. Being a woman, as usual she chooses
badly, for the other has the finer spirit."
</p><p>"Yes, I know now," said Saladin, "and I am glad to know, for the
matter has vexed me much."
</p><p>But Wulf, who had paled for a moment, flushed with joy as the
truth came home to him, and he understood the end of all their
doubts.
</p><p>"This Star is well named 'The Luck,'" he said, as bending down
he took it from the floor and fastened it to his cloak above his
heart, "nor do I hold it dearly earned." Then he turned to his
brother, who stood by him white and still, saying:
</p><p>"Forgive me, Godwin, but such is the fortune of love and war.
Grudge it not to me, for when I am sped tonight this Luck--and
all that hangs to it--will be yours."
</p><p>So that strange scene ended.
</p><p>The afternoon drew towards evening, and Godwin stood before
Saladin in his private chamber.
</p><p>"What seek you now?" said the Sultan sternly.
</p><p>"A boon," answered Godwin. "My brother is doomed to die before
nightfall. I ask to die instead of him."
</p><p>"Why, Sir Godwin?"
</p><p>"For two reasons, sire. As you learned to-day, at length the
riddle is answered. It is Wulf who is beloved of the lady
Rosamund, and therefore to kill him would be a crime. Further, it
is I and not he whom the eunuch heard bargaining with the captain
Abdullah in the tent--I swear it. Take your vengeance upon me,
and let him go to fulfil his fate."
</p><p>Saladin pulled at his beard, then answered:
</p><p>"If this is to be so, time is short, Sir Godwin. What farewells
have you to make? You say that you would speak with my niece
Rosamund? Nay, the princess you shall not see, and indeed cannot,
for she lies swooning in her chamber. Do you desire to meet your
brother for the last time?"
</p><p>"No, sire, for then he might learn the truth and--"
</p><p>"Refuse this sacrifice, Sir Godwin, which perchance will be
scarcely to his liking."
</p><p>"I wish to say good-bye to Masouda, she who is waiting woman to
the princess."
</p><p>"That you cannot do, for, know, I mistrust this Masouda, and
believe that she was at the bottom of your plot. I have dismissed
her from the person of the princess and from my camp, which she
is to leave--if she has not already left--with some Arabs who
are her kin. Had it not been for her services in the land of the
Assassins and afterwards, I should have put her to death."
</p><p>"Then," said Godwin with a sigh, "I desire only to see Egbert the
bishop, that he may shrive me according to our faith and make
note of my last wishes."
</p><p>"Good; he shall be sent to you. I accept your statement that you
are the guilty man and not Sir Wulf, and take your life for his.
Leave me now, who have greater matters on my mind. The guard will
seek you at the appointed time."
</p><p>Godwin bowed and walked away with a steady step while Saladin,
looking after him, muttered:
</p><p>"The world could ill spare so brave and good a man."
</p><p>Two hours later guards summoned Godwin from the place where he
was prisoned, and, accompanied by the old bishop who had shriven
him, he passed its door with a happy countenance, such as a
bridegroom might have worn. In a fashion, indeed, he was happy,
whose troubles were done with, who had few sins to mourn, whose
faith was the faith of a child, and who laid down his life for
his friend and brother. They took him to a vault of the great
house where Saladin was lodged--a large, rough place, lit with
torches, in which waited the headsman and his assistants.
Presently Saladin entered, and, looking at him curiously, said:
</p><p>"Are you still of the same mind, Sir Godwin?"
</p><p>"I am."
</p><p>"Good. Yet I have changed mine. You shall say farewell to your
cousin, as you desired. Let the princess of Baalbec be brought
hither, sick or well, that she may see her work. Let her come
alone."
</p><p>"Sire," pleaded Godwin, "spare her such a sight."
</p><p>But he pleaded in vain, for Saladin answered only, "I have said."
</p><p>A while passed, and Godwin, hearing the sweep of robes, looked
up, and saw the tall shape of a veiled woman standing in the
corner of the vault where the shadow was so deep that the
torchlight only glimmered faintly upon her royal ornaments.
</p><p>"They told me that you were sick, princess, sick with sorrow, as
well you may be, because the man you love was about to die for
you," said Saladin in a slow voice. "Now I have had pity on your
grief, and his life has been bought with another life, that of
the knight who stands yonder."
</p><p>The veiled form started wildly, then sank back against the wall.
</p><p>"Rosamund," broke in Godwin, speaking in French, "I beseech you,
be silent and do not unman me with words or tears. It is best
thus, and you know that it is best. Wulf you love as he loves
you, and I believe that in time you will be brought together. Me
you do not love, save as a friend, and never have. Moreover, I
tell you this that it may ease your pain and my conscience; I no
longer seek you as my wife, whose bride is death. I pray you,
give to Wulf my love and blessing, and to Masouda, that truest
and most sweet woman, say, or write, that I offer her the homage
of my heart; that I thought of her in my last moments, and that
my prayer is we may meet again where all crooked paths are
straightened. Rosamund, farewell; peace and joy go with you
through many years, ay, and with your children's children. Of
Godwin I only ask you to remember this, that he lived serving
you, and so died."
</p><p>She heard and stretched out her arms, and, none forbidding him,
Godwin walked to where she stood. Without lifting her veil she
bent forward and kissed him, first upon the brow and next upon
the lips; then with a low, moaning cry, she turned and fled from
that gloomy place, nor did Saladin seek to stay her. Only to
himself the Sultan wondered how it came about that if it was Wulf
whom Rosamund loved, she still kissed Godwin thus upon the lips.
</p><p>As he walked back to the death-place Godwin wondered also, first
that Rosamund should have spoken no single word, and secondly
because she had kissed him thus, even in that hour. Why or
wherefore he did not know, but there rose in his mind a memory
of that wild ride down the mountain steeps at Beirut, and of lips
which then had touched his cheek, and of the odour of hair that
then was blown about his breast. With a sigh he thrust the
thought aside, blushing to think that such memories should come
to him who had done with earth and its delights, knelt down
before the headsman, and, turning to the bishop, said:
</p><p>"Bless me, father, and bid them strike."
</p><p>Then it was that he heard a well-known footstep, and looked up to
see Wulf staring at him.
</p><p>"What do you here, Godwin?" asked Wulf. "Has yonder fox snared
both of us?" and he nodded at Saladin.
</p><p>"Let the fox speak," said the Sultan with a smile. "Know, Sir
Wulf, that your brother was about to die in your place, and of
his own wish. But I refuse such sacrifice who yet have made use
of it to teach my niece, the princess, that should she continue
in her plottings to escape, or allow you to continue in them,
certainly it will bring you to your deaths, and, if need be, her
also. Knights, you are brave men whom I prefer to kill in war.
Good horses stand without; take them as my gift, and ride with
these foolish citizens of Jerusalem. We may meet again within its
streets. Nay, thank me not. I thank you who have taught
Salah-ed-din how perfect a thing can be the love of brothers."
</p><p>The brethren stood awhile bewildered, for it is a strange thing
thus to come back from death to life. Each of them had made sure
that he must die within some few minutes, and pass through the
blackness which walls man in, to find he knew not what. And now,
behold! the road that led to that blackness turned again at its
very edge, and ran forward through the familiar things of earth
to some end unknown. They were brave, both of them, and
accustomed to face death daily, as in such a place and time all
men must be; moreover, they had been shriven, and looked to see
the gates of Paradise open on their newborn sight.
</p><p>Yet, since no man loves that journey, it was very sweet to know
it done with for a while, and that they still might hope to dwell
in this world for many years. Little wonder, then, that their
brains swam, and their eyes grew dim, as they passed from the
shadow to the light again. It was Wulf who spoke the first.
</p><p>"A noble deed, Godwin, yet one for which I should not have
thanked you had it been accomplished, who then must have lived on
by grace of your sacrifice. Sultan, we are grateful for your boon
of life, though had you shed this innocent blood surely it would
have stained your soul. May we bid farewell to our cousin
Rosamund before we ride?"
</p><p>"Nay," answered Saladin; "Sir Godwin has done that already--let
it serve for both. To-morrow she shall learn the truth of the
story. Now go, and return no more."
</p><p>"That must be as fate wills," answered Godwin, and they bowed and
went.
</p><p>Outside that gloomy place of death their swords were given them,
and two good horses, which they mounted. Hence guides led them to
the embassy from Jerusalem that was already in the saddle, who
were very glad to welcome two such knights to their company.
Then, having bid farewell to the bishop Egbert, who wept for joy
at their escape, escorted for a while by Saladin's soldiers, they
rode away from Ascalon at the fall of night.
</p><p>Soon they had told each other all there was to tell. When he
heard of the woe of Rosamund Wulf well-nigh shed tears.
</p><p>"We have our lives," he said, "but how shall we save her? While
Masouda stayed with her there was some hope, but now I can see
none."
</p><p>"There is none, except in God," answered Godwin, "Who can do all
things--even free Rosamund and make her your wife. Also, if
Masouda is at liberty, we shall hear from her ere long; so let us
keep a good heart."
</p><p>But though he spoke thus, the soul of Godwin was oppressed with a
fear which he could not understand. It seemed as though some
great terror came very close to him, or to one who was near and
dear. Deeper and deeper he sank into that pit of dread of he knew
not what, until at length he could have cried aloud, and his brow
was bathed with a sweat of anguish. Wulf saw his face in the
moonlight, and asked:
</p><p>"What ails you, Godwin? Have you some secret wound?"
</p><p>"Yes, brother," he answered, "a wound in my spirit. Ill fortune
threatens us--great ill fortune."
</p><p>"That is no new thing," said Wulf, "in this land of blood and
sorrows. Let us meet it as we have met the rest."
</p><p>"Alas! brother," exclaimed Godwin, "I fear that Rosamund is in
sore danger--Rosamund or another."
</p><p>"Then," answered Wulf, turning pale, "since we cannot, let us
pray that some angel may deliver her."
</p><p>"Ay," said Godwin, and as they rode through the desert sands
beneath the silent stars, they prayed to the Blessed Mother, and
to their saints, St. Peter and St. Chad--prayed with all their
strength. Yet the prayer availed not. Sharper and sharper grew
Godwin's agony, till, as the slow hours went by, his very soul
reeled beneath this spiritual pain, and the death which he had
escaped seemed a thing desirable.
</p><p>The dawn was breaking, and at its first sign the escort of
Saladin's soldiers had turned and left them, saying that now they
were safe in their own country. All night they had ridden fast
and far. The plain was behind them, and their road ran among
hills. Suddenly it turned, and in the flaming lights of the
new-born day showed them a sight so beautiful that for a moment
all that little company drew rein to gaze. For yonder before
them, though far away as yet, throned upon her hills, stood the
holy city of Jerusalem. There were her walls and towers, and
there, stained red as though with the blood of its worshippers,
soared the great cross upon the mosque of Omar--that cross which
was so soon to fall.
</p><p>Yes, yonder was the city for which throughout the ages men had
died by tens and hundreds of thousands, and still must die until
the doom was done. Saladin had offered to spare her citizens if
they consented to surrender, but they would not. This embassy had
told him that they had sworn to perish with the holy Places, and
now, looking at it in its splendour, they knew that the hour was
near, and groaned aloud.
</p><p>Godwin groaned also, but not for Jerusalem. Oh! now the last
terror was upon him. Blackness surged round him, and in the
blackness swords, and a sound as of a woman's voice murmuring his
name. Clutching the pommel of his saddle, he swayed to and fro,
till suddenly the anguish passed. A strange wind seemed to blow
about him and lift his hair; a deep, unearthly peace sank into
his spirit; the world seemed far away and heaven very near.
</p><p>"It is over," he said to Wulf. "I fear that Rosamund is dead."
</p><p>"If so, we must make haste to follow her," answered Wulf with a
sob.
