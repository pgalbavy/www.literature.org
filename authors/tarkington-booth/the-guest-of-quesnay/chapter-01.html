<p>There are old Parisians who will tell you pompously that the
boulevards, like the political cafes, have ceased to exist, but
this means only that the boulevards no longer gossip of Louis
Napoleon, the Return of the Bourbons, or of General Boulanger,
for these highways are always too busily stirring with present
movements not to be forgetful of their yesterdays. In the shade
of the buildings and awnings, the loungers, the lookers-on in
Paris, the audience of the boulevard, sit at little tables, sipping
coffee from long glasses, drinking absinthe or bright-coloured
sirops, and gazing over the heads of throngs afoot at others borne
along through the sunshine of the street in carriages, in cabs,
in glittering automobiles, or high on the tops of omnibuses.</p>

<p>From all the continents the multitudes come to join in that procession:
Americans, tagged with race-cards and intending hilarious disturbances;
puzzled Americans, worn with guide-book plodding; Chinese princes
in silk; queer Antillean dandies of swarthy origin and fortune;
ruddy English, thinking of nothing; pallid English, with upper
teeth bared and eyes hungrily searching for sign-boards of tea-rooms;
over-Europeanised Japanese, unpleasantly immaculate; burnoosed
sheiks from the desert, and red-fezzed Semitic peddlers; Italian
nobles in English tweeds; Soudanese negroes swaggering in frock
coats; slim Spaniards, squat Turks, travellers, idlers, exiles,
fugitives, sportsmen&mdash;all the tribes and kinds of men are tributary
here to the Parisian stream which, on a fair day in spring, already
overflows the banks with its own much-mingled waters. Soberly
clad burgesses, bearded, amiable, and in no fatal hurry; well-kept
men of the world swirling by in miraculous limousines; legless
cripples flopping on hands and leather pads; thin-whiskered students
in velveteen; walrus-moustached veterans in broadcloth; keen-faced
old prelates; shabby young priests; cavalrymen in casque and cuirass;
workingmen turned horse and harnessed to carts; sidewalk jesters,
itinerant vendors of questionable wares; shady loafers dressed
to resemble gold-showering America; motor-cyclists in leather;
hairy musicians, blue gendarmes, baggy red zouaves; purple-faced,
glazed-hatted, scarlet-waistcoated, cigarette-smoking cabmen,
calling one another "onions," "camels," and names even more terrible.
Women prevalent over all the concourse; fair women, dark women,
pretty women, gilded women, haughty women, indifferent women,
friendly women, merry women. Fine women in fine clothes; rich
women in fine clothes; poor women in fine clothes. Worldly old
women, reclining befurred in electric landaulettes; wordy old
women hoydenishly trundling carts full of flowers. Wonderful automobile
women quick-glimpsed, in multiple veils of white and brown and
sea-green. Women in rags and tags, and women draped, coifed, and
befrilled in the delirium of maddened poet-milliners and the hasheesh
dreams of ladies' tailors.</p>

<p>About the procession, as it moves interminably along the boulevard,
a blue haze of fine dust and burnt gasoline rises into the sunshine
like the haze over the passages to an amphitheatre toward which
a crowd is trampling; and through this the multitudes seem to
go as actors passing to their cues. Your place at one of the little
tables upon the sidewalk is that of a wayside spectator: and as
the performers go by, in some measure acting or looking their
parts already, as if in preparation, you guess the roles they
play, and name them comedians, tragedians, buffoons, saints, beauties,
sots, knaves, gladiators, acrobats, dancers; for all of these
are there, and you distinguish the principles from the unnumbered
supernumeraries pressing forward to the entrances. So, if you
sit at the little tables often enough&mdash;that is, if you become
an amateur boulevardier&mdash;you begin to recognise the transient
stars of the pageant, those to whom the boulevard allows a dubious
and fugitive role of celebrity, and whom it greets with a slight
flutter: the turning of heads, a murmur of comment, and the incredulous
boulevard smile, which seems to say: "You see? Madame and monsieur
passing there&mdash;evidently they think we still believe in them!"</p>

<p>This flutter heralded and followed the passing of a white touring-car
with the procession one afternoon, just before the Grand Prix,
though it needed no boulevard celebrity to make the man who lolled
in the tonneau conspicuous. Simply for <em>THAT, </em>notoriety
was superfluous; so were the remarkable size and power of his
car; so was the elaborate touring-costume of flannels and pongee
he wore; so was even the enamelled presence of the dancer who
sat beside him. His face would have done it without accessories.</p>

<p>My old friend, George Ward, and I had met for our aperitif at
the Terrace Larue, by the Madeleine, when the white automobile
came snaking its way craftily through the traffic. Turning in
to pass a victoria on the wrong side, it was forced down to a
snail's pace near the curb and not far from our table, where it
paused, checked by a blockade at the next corner. I heard Ward
utter a half-suppressed guttural of what I took to be amazement,
and I did not wonder.</p>

<p>The face of the man in the tonneau detached him to the spectator's
gaze and singled him out of the concourse with an effect almost
ludicrous in its incongruity. The hair was dark, lustrous and
thick, the forehead broad and finely modelled, and certain other
ruinous vestiges of youth and good looks remained; but whatever
the features might once have shown of honour, worth, or kindly
semblance had disappeared beyond all tracing in a blurred distortion.
The lids of one eye were discoloured and swollen almost together;
other traces of a recent battering were not lacking, nor was cosmetic
evidence of a heroic struggle, on the part of some valet of infinite
pains, to efface them. The nose lost outline in the discolorations
of the puffed cheeks; the chin, tufted with a small imperial,
trembled beneath a sagging, gray lip. And that this bruised and
dissipated mask should suffer the final grotesque touch, it was
decorated with the moustache of a coquettish marquis, the ends
waxed and exquisitely elevated.</p>

<p>The figure was fat, but loose and sprawling, seemingly without
the will to hold itself together; in truth the man appeared to
be almost in a semi-stupor, and, contrasted with this powdered
Silenus, even the woman beside him gained something of human dignity.
At least, she was thoroughly alive, bold, predatory, and in spite
of the gross embon-point that threatened her, still savagely graceful.
A purple veil, dotted with gold, floated about her hat, from which
green-dyed ostrich plumes cascaded down across a cheek enamelled
dead white. Her hair was plastered in blue-black waves, parted
low on the forehead; her lips were splashed a startling carmine,
the eyelids painted blue; and, from between lashes gummed into
little spikes of blacking, she favoured her companion with a glance
of carelessly simulated tenderness,&mdash;a look all too vividly suggesting
the ghastly calculations of a cook wheedling a chicken nearer
the kitchen door. But I felt no great pity for the victim.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" I asked, staring at the man in the automobile and
not turning toward Ward.</p>

<p>"That is Mariana&mdash;'la bella Mariana la Mursiana,'" George answered;
"&mdash;one of those women who come to Paris from the tropics to form
themselves on the legend of the one great famous and infamous
Spanish dancer who died a long while ago. Mariana did very well
for a time. I've heard that the revolutionary societies intend
striking medals in her honour: she's done worse things to royalty
than all the anarchists in Europe! But her great days are over:
she's getting old; that type goes to pieces quickly, once it begins
to slump, and it won't be long before she'll be horribly fat,
though she's still a graceful dancer. She danced at the Folie
Rouge last week."</p>

<p>"Thank you, George," I said gratefully. "I hope you'll point
out the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower to me some day. I didn't mean
Mariana."</p>

<p>"What did you mean?"</p>

<p>What I had meant was so obvious that I turned to my friend in
surprise. He was nervously tapping his chin with the handle of
his cane and staring at the white automobile with very grim interest.</p>

<p>"I meant the man with her," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh!" He laughed sourly. "That carrion?"</p>

<p>"You seem to be an acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Everybody on the boulevard knows who he is," said Ward curtly,
paused, and laughed again with very little mirth. "So do you,"
he continued; "and as for my acquaintance with him&mdash;yes, I had
once the distinction of being his rival in a small way, a way
so small, in fact, that it ended in his becoming a connection
of mine by marriage. He's Larrabee Harman."</p>

<p>That was a name somewhat familiar to readers of American newspapers
even before its bearer was fairly out of college. The publicity
it then attained (partly due to young Harman's conspicuous wealth)
attached to some youthful exploits not without a certain wild
humour. But frolic degenerated into brawl and debauch: what had
been scrapes for the boy became scandals for the man; and he gathered
a more and more unsavoury reputation until its like was not to
be found outside a penitentiary. The crux of his career in his
own country was reached during a midnight quarrel in Chicago when
he shot a negro gambler. After that, the negro having recovered
and the matter being somehow arranged so that the prosecution
was dropped, Harman's wife left him, and the papers recorded her
application for a divorce. She was George Ward's second cousin,
the daughter of a Baltimore clergyman; a belle in a season and
town of belles, and a delightful, headstrong creature, from all
accounts. She had made a runaway match of it with Harman three
years before, their affair having been earnestly opposed by all
her relatives&mdash;especially by poor George, who came over to Paris
just after the wedding in a miserable frame of mind.</p>

<p>The Chicago exploit was by no means the end of Harman's notoriety.
Evading an effort (on the part of an aunt, I believe) to get him
locked up safely in a "sanitarium," he began a trip round the
world with an orgy which continued from San Francisco to Bangkok,
where, in the company of some congenial fellow travellers, he
interfered in a native ceremonial with the result that one of
his companions was drowned. Proceeding, he was reported to be
in serious trouble at Constantinople, the result of an inquisitiveness
little appreciated by Orientals. The State Department, bestirring
itself, saved him from a very real peril, and he continued his
journey. In Rome he was rescued with difficulty from a street
mob that unreasonably refused to accept intoxication as an excuse
for his riding down a child on his way to the hunt. Later, during
the winter just past, we had been hearing from Monte Carlo of
his disastrous plunges at that most imbecile of all games, roulette.</p>

<p>Every event, no matter how trifling, in this man's pitiful career
had been recorded in the American newspapers with an elaboration
which, for my part, I found infuriatingly tiresome. I have lived
in Paris so long that I am afraid to go home: I have too little
to show for my years of pottering with paint and canvas, and I
have grown timid about all the changes that have crept in at home.
I do not know the "new men," I do not know how they would use
me, and fear they might make no place for me; and so I fit myself
more closely into the little grooves I have worn for myself, and
resign myself to stay. But I am no "expatriate." I know there
is a feeling at home against us who remain over here to do our
work, but in most instances it is a prejudice which springs from
a misunderstanding. I think the quality of patriotism in those
of us who "didn't go home in time" is almost pathetically deep
and real, and, like many another oldish fellow in my position,
I try to keep as close to things at home as I can. All of my old
friends gradually ceased to write to me, but I still take three
home newspapers, trying to follow the people I knew and the things
that happen; and the ubiquity of so worthless a creature as Larrabee
Harman in the columns I dredged for real news had long been a
point of irritation to this present exile. Not only that: he had
usurped space in the Continental papers, and of late my favourite
Parisian journal had served him to me with my morning coffee,
only hinting his name, but offering him with that gracious satire
characteristic of the Gallic journalist writing of anything American.
And so this grotesque wreck of a man was well known to the boulevard&mdash;one
of its sights. That was to be perceived by the flutter he caused,
by the turning of heads in his direction, and the low laughter
of the people at the little tables. Three or four in the rear
ranks had risen to their feet to get a better look at him and
his companion.</p>

<p>Some one behind us chuckled aloud. "They say Mariana beats him."</p>

<p>"Evidently!"</p>

<p>The dancer was aware of the flutter, and called Harman's attention
to it with a touch upon his arm and a laugh and a nod of her violent
plumage.</p>

<p>At that he seemed to rouse himself somewhat: his head rolled
heavily over upon his shoulder, the lids lifted a little from
the red-shot eyes, showing a strange pride when his gaze fell
upon the many staring faces.</p>

<p>Then, as the procession moved again and the white automobile
with it, the sottish mouth widened in a smile of dull and cynical
contempt: the look of a half-poisoned Augustan borne down through
the crowds from the Palatine after supping with Caligula.</p>

<p>Ward pulled my sleeve.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, "let us go over to the Luxembourg gardens where
the air is cleaner."</p>
