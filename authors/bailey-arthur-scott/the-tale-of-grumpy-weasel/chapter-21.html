<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Throughout Pleasant Valley the very name of Grumpy Weasel was a bugaboo.
Those of his size, and many a good deal bigger than he, learned early to
avoid him.
</p>
<p>One of the first things Sandy Chipmunk's mother did was to teach him to
beware of Grumpy. And twice during his first summer Sandy caught a
glimpse of Grumpy as he flashed past like a brown streak, with a gleam
of white showing underneath.
</p><p>It was lucky for Sandy that on both occasions Grumpy was intent on
chasing somebody or other. And each time that Sandy told his mother
what he had seen, Mrs. Chipmunk said that she hoped it would never
happen again.
</p><p>"I'm glad that you know what he looks like, anyhow," she added.
</p><p>"Oh, I'll know him if I see him!" Sandy cried.
</p><p>"Don't stop for a second look!" his mother warned him.
</p><p>"I won't!" he promised. "I won't even stop to say, 'How do you do!'"
</p><p>"I should hope not!" Mrs. Chipmunk said severely.
</p><p>So Sandy Chipmunk went through his first summer on the watch for a long,
slender, brownish shape. But he never saw Grumpy Weasel again. And
winter found the Chipmunk family all unharmed, and very comfortable in
their cozy house below frost line.
</p><p>On mild days Sandy liked to visit the world above and find a rock bare
of snow, where he could enjoy the sunshine.
</p><p>It was on one of those outings that he caught sight of a stranger headed
for the stone wall near-by. At first Sandy missed seeing him, against
the snow. But when he reached the wind-swept wall Sandy couldn't help
noticing him. He was a slim gentleman and--except for his black-tipped
tail--was dressed all in white.
</p><p>After spending the winter underground Sandy Chipmunk was glad to talk
with the first person he saw. So he called to the stranger that it was a
fine day, wasn't it?
</p><p>The other wheeled about so quickly that Sandy couldn't help laughing.
</p><p>"Don't be nervous!" Sandy cried. "I won't hurt you!"
</p><p>But the stranger didn't answer. Once he opened his mouth. And Sandy
Chipmunk had a queer feeling then that he had met the fellow before.
That mouth had plenty of white, needle-like teeth. It had a cruel look,
too.
</p><p>Then the stranger jumped straight toward Sandy Chipmunk. And in that
instant Sandy knew who he was. No one could leap like that except Grumpy
Weasel!
</p><p>Sandy turned and ran madly for shelter. Luckily he had the advantage of
Grumpy in one way. He had a bare ledge to run on, while Grumpy Weasel
had to flounder for some distance through a snow-choked hollow.
</p><p>So Sandy escaped. And it was lucky that Grumpy didn't find the door to
the Chipmunk family's burrow. If he had he would have gone right in
himself.
</p><p>Mrs. Chipmunk blamed herself for Sandy's adventure. She had never
remembered to tell her son that every fall Grumpy Weasel changed his
summer dress for the one in which Sandy had just seen him.
