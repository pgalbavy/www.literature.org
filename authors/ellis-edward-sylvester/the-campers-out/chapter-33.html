<p>Jim McGovern now gave the particulars of his own escape through
the help of Dick Halliard, and of their memorable interview on
the border of the rushing flood, with the body of Tom Wagstaff
lying at their feet. Bob listened with deep interest until he
had finished, and then shook his head.</p>

<p>"It beats anything I ever knew or heard tell of; but I don’t
feel safe now that Halliard has the grip on me."</p>

<p>"Of course, he told me nothing about that affair; but, since
he got so much the best of it, I’m sure he will be satisfied to
let it go no further. I’ll guarantee it," added McGovern, with
a glowing face.</p>

<p>"I don’t see how you can do that; but I’m inclined to believe
you can make it right with Dick."</p>

<p>"Of course I can; such a fellow as he is will do anything in
the world for you."</p>

<p>But Bob was not free from misgiving. He had dwelt upon the troublesome
matter until he had grown morbid. It assumed a magnitude in his
mind beyond the truth.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Jim?"</p>

<p>"If I live I shall enter Yale College at the next term, and try
to be something that my folks won’t be ashamed of."</p>

<p>"Whew! but that’s a big flop for you, and you will lose a mighty
deal of fun by trying to be good."</p>

<p>"You can have tenfold more than by the other way; I haven’t tried
it long, it is true, but I have felt more genuine pleasure during
these few days than I ever knew in all my life; it will be the
same with you."</p>

<p>Bob Budd sat silent a moment, looking out of the window. He had
given the same important subject a great deal of thought during
the few days that he imagined so many of those whom he met were
hunting for him, but the restraining power in his case was that
he saw no safe way by which to turn the sharp corner. So long
as he was in danger of being arrested so long he must remain a
fugitive.</p>

<p>Now the whole case was changed. He knew, despite the doubts he
had expressed, that Dick Halliard could be relied upon, and that
not the slightest risk was run in trusting to his honor.</p>

<p>"Well, Jim," he said, after his brief silence, "<em>I’ll try
it</em>."</p>

<p>The other extended his hand, and they shook cordially.</p>

<p>"That’s settled!" said McGovern, with much emphasis. He was wise
enough to refrain from any sermon, or disquisition upon the rewards
that were sure to accompany such a step. Bob understood the matter
as well as he did, and therefore needed no enlightenment. His
friend never displayed more admirable tact than he did by treating
the mental debate of the other as ended beyond all possibility
of reopening. He showed no doubt in his own mind, though, truth
to tell, he was not wholly free from misgiving.</p>

<p>"Now," added Bob, with a laugh, "I suppose your next order will
be for me to go back to Piketon."</p>

<p>"I don’t know that there is anything better for you to do; but
I have been thinking that it might be better to bring Dick Halliard
to New York, that we can talk the whole thing over and reach a
full understanding before you return."</p>

<p>"That suits me better."</p>

<p>"Our folks are anxious to meet him, for I have told them so many
things about him that he has become quite a hero in their eyes.
And then there’s another matter that I want to speak to you about,"
added Jim, rising from his chair, opening the door and peering
into the hall, as if he feared that some one might overhear his
words.</p>

<p>"There’s no danger of anything like that," said Bob, with a laugh;
"we are not of enough importance to have any one listening at
the keyhole to catch our words."</p>

<p>"I don’t know about that," replied Jim, with an air so mysterious
that the curiosity of his friend was aroused. "I guess I’ll risk
it; but no one knows of it beside father and mother."</p>

<p>And then Jim, in a guarded undertone, made known another momentous
secret, while his companion sat with open mouth and staring eyes
listening to his words. He did not speak until he had finished
and turned upon him with the question:</p>

<p>"What do you think of <em>that</em>, Bob?"</p>

<p>"I agree with you; I’ll stand by you to the end; but what about
Dick’s visit to New York?"</p>

<p>"I’ll write to him now and mail both letters as I go out."</p>

<p>"Don’t give him a hint about <em>me</em>," cautioned Bob, as
the other placed himself at the table.</p>

<p>The letter, whose contents have already been known to the reader,
was written in the room of the Astor House where the other to
Captain Budd was formulated. Then Jim placed the two in his pocket
and rose to go.</p>

<p>"Won’t you come and stay at our house?" he asked of Bob.</p>

<p>"Thanks, no; I’ll remain here; you can understand that it would
be a little embarrassing to meet your folks just now. When matters
are straightened out I will give you a call, and you will come
down and spend a week or two at Piketon."</p>

<p>"That’s a bargain, provided it is not in the character of a Piketon
Ranger," replied Jim, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Shaking the hand of his friend he took his departure.</p>

<p>That afternoon when Bob strolled up Broadway, he reflected that
it was the most enjoyable hour he had spent since his visit to
the metropolis. He feared no one now, and his future was brighter
than he ever dreamed it could be.</p>

<p>When the telegram from Dick Halliard reached Jim McGovern, making
known on what train he would reach New York, he drove down to
the Astor House and took Bob to his own home, where he left him
in the library while he hastened to the station for Dick.</p>

<p>We have already given a hint about their meeting, when Dick received
the greatest shock in all his life. For a few minutes he doubted
his own senses, but that it was the real Bob Budd before him he
was compelled to admit, after shaking his hand, looking in his
laughing face, and hearing his voice.</p>

<p>The three sat for a couple of hours discussing the subject which
was nearest to each one’s heart. Then Jim took his two friends
out riding in the Park, for it happened to be one of the most
delightful of autumn days. In the evening the family of Mr. McGovern
made the acquaintance of Dick and Bob, and the three visited a
place of entertainment.</p>

<p>The McGoverns insisted on Dick spending a week with them, but,
though it would have given him rare pleasure to do so, he felt
that he ought to return at the end of the time he had named to
Mr. Hunter. His friends finally compromised by allowing him to
go, with the understanding that he was to pay the visit during
the holidays. Dick promised that if it lay in his power he would
do so.</p>

<p>The visit was made as per programme.</p>

<p>Bob decided to stay in New York for several days, until the excitement
of his disappearance had time to subside. It was agreed that Dick
on his return should make known the astonishing news to the people
in Piketon, that they might not be frightened out of their wits
when they encountered him on the street.</p>

<p>"I don’t know how to fix it with them," said Bob, "and I will
leave it with you, Dick; your head is plumb, and you may be able
to get up some story which, while true, don’t give me away too
bad."</p>

<p>"I’ll do my best," said Dick, as he bade his friends good-bye
for a brief while.</p>

<p>Upon reaching Piketon, Dick, after reporting at home, called
on Captain Jim and Aunt Ruth, whom he told of his meeting with
their nephew in New York. He brought a message to the effect that
he would soon be with them, and they were at liberty to make known
all he had told them, adding, by way of explanation, that he left
for New York on the evening of the flood on important business,
which would soon be finished, when he would be among them again.
He had read in the papers an account of the disaster, and was
extremely sorry to learn of poor Wagstaff’s death. He hoped all
his friends would overlook his failure to notify them more promptly
that he was alive and well.</p>

<p>This was the story told by the captain and by Dick Halliard,
and though it was far from revealing everything, it cannot be
said that it partook of the nature of a falsehood.</p>

<p>On the second day after Dick’s return, a small box arrived by
express for Dick Halliard. When the wondering lad opened it he
found within a magnificent gold watch and chain. On the former
was engraved the following inscription:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"From Bob and Jim,

</p>
<p>
TO <em>THEIR BEST FRIEND<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Dick Halliard.

</p>
<p>
WE <em>ARE ALL NOW FELLOW-TRAVELERS<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALONG THE RIGHT PATH</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>And that was the secret of the mysterious communication of Jim
McGovern to Bob Budd in the room of the latter at the Astor House.</p>
