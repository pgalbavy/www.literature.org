<p>Stuart Farquaharson had tempered a dignified strength with a gracious
fortitude. He had endured slanderous charges and stood with the
steadiness of a reef-light when Conscience was steering a storm ridden
course, but the constant pressure on the dykes of his self-command had
strained them until they might break at any moment and let the flood of
passion swirl through with destructive power. He was being oppressed and
seeing Conscience oppressed by a spirit which he regarded as viciously
illiberal--and he accused Conscience, in his own mind, of blind
obedience to a distorted sense of duty. Unconsciously he was seeking to
coerce her into repudiating it by a form of argument in which the
graciousness of his nature gave way to a domineering insistence.
Unconsciously, too, that form of attack aroused in her an unyielding
quality of opposition.
</p>
<p>When he saw her next after the mid-night meeting she had seemed more
normally composed and he had seized upon the occasion to open his
campaign. They had driven over and stopped the car at a point from which
they could look out to sea, and though the summer vividness had died out
of wave and sky and the waters had taken on a touch of a leaden
grimness, there was still beauty in the picture.
</p><p>For awhile they talked of unimportant things, but abruptly Stuart said:
"Dearest, I told you that I meant to fight for you even if I had to
fight with you. That's the hardest form in which the battle could come,
but one can't always choose the conditions of war." He paused and,
seeing that his eyes were troubled, Conscience smiled encouragingly.
</p><p>"At least," she laughed, "I believe you will wage war on me humanely."
</p><p>The man went on hurriedly. "I've been talking with the doctor. He says
that your father's condition holds no immediate danger--danger of death,
I mean. Unless he suffers another stroke, he may live for years."
</p><p>The girl nodded her head. "Yes, I know," she said wearily, "and for him
life only means continuation of suffering." She did not add that it
meant the same for her and Stuart, looking steadily into her face, said
with decision, "For awhile you must go away."
</p><p>"I!" Her eyes widened with an incredulous expression as if she thought
she had misunderstood, then she answered slowly and very gently, "You
<u>know</u> I can't do that, dear."
</p><p>"I know that you must," he countered, and because he had keyed himself
for this combat of wills he spoke more categorically than he realized.
"At first thought, of course, you would feel that you couldn't. But your
ability to stand a long siege will depend on conserving your strength.
You are human and not indestructible."
</p><p>She shook her head with a gentle stubbornness. "Stuart, dear, you're
trying to make me do a thing you wouldn't do yourself. A sentry placed
on duty can't go away until his watch is over--even if it's raw and
gloomy where's he's stationed."
</p><p>"No, but soldiers under intolerable stress are relieved and given
breathing space whenever it's possible."
</p><p>"Yes, whenever it's possible."
</p><p>"It's possible, now, dearest, and perhaps it won't be later. You could
visit some friend for a few weeks and come back the better able to carry
on the siege. Otherwise you'll be crushed by the weight of the ordeal."
</p><p>"Stuart," she began slowly, "who is there to take my place, even for a
few weeks?"
</p><p>"And the whole intolerable situation arises," he broke out with a
sudden inflection of wrath, "from inert, thick-skulled bigotry. Thought
processes that are moral cramps and mental dyspepsia threaten to ruin
your entire life."
</p><p>"Don't, dear--please!" She leaned toward him and spoke earnestly. "I
know it's hard to endure without retort, but please don't make me listen
to things like that about Father. It's bad enough without any more
recriminations."
</p><p>Then logic retreated from Stuart Farquaharson. He, the gracious and
controlled, gave way to his first moment of ungenerous temper and
retorted bitterly.
</p><p>"Very well, but it seems you can listen to his abuse of me."
</p><p>Conscience flinched as if lash-stung and for an instant indignation and
anger kindled in her eyes only to die as instantly out of them, as she
bit her lip. When she spoke it was in an even gentler voice. "You know
why I listened to him, Stuart. You know that I didn't listen ... before
his stroke. I didn't listen when I told him that if you went, I went,
too, did I?"
</p><p>The man's face paled and with a spasmodic gesture he covered it with his
hands. "My God!" he exclaimed, "I don't think I've ever said such a
damnably mean and caddish thing before--and to you!"
</p><p>But Conscience bent over and drew his hands away from his face. "It
wasn't you. It was just the strain. You could make allowances for me
when I called you out to calm me in the middle of the night. I can make
them, too. Neither of us is quite sane."
</p><p>But having had that warning of Stuart's slipping control, Conscience
kept locked in her own bosom certain fresh trials which discussion would
have alleviated. She did not tell him how she spent sleepless nights
devising plans to meet the grim insistence upon his banishment which
she knew the morning would bring. But she felt that the comfort of a
complete unburdening of her feelings had been curtailed and with a
woman's genius for sacrifice she uncomplainingly assumed that added
strain.
</p><p>One afternoon Eben Tollman came out of the house, as she was walking
alone under the bare trees of the driveway, and stopped, hat in hand, at
her side.
</p><p>"Conscience," he began thoughtfully, "Mr. Williams has just told me of
his insistence that Mr. Farquaharson shall not only be denied the house,
but sent away altogether. You must be carrying a pretty heavy load for
young shoulders."
</p><p>The girl stood regarding her father's counselor gravely. He had never
appealed to her as a person inviting confidence, and she had thought of
his mind as cut to the same austere pattern as the minister's own. Yet
now his face wore an expression of kindliness and sympathy to which his
manner gave corroboration. Possibly she had misjudged the man and lost
his underlying qualities in her careless view of externals. Tollman
seemed to expect no answer and went on slowly, "I tried to point out to
your father the unwisdom of an insistence which must stir a spirit like
yours to natural opposition. I suggested that under the circumstances it
was scarcely fair."
</p><p>"What did he say?" She put the inquiry with a level glance as if
reserving her right to accept or reject his volunteered assistance.
</p><p>"He could only see his own side. He must do his duty, however hard he
found it."
</p><p>Conscience remembered Stuart's warning that Tollman thought he loved
her, and smiled to herself. This voluntary championing of another man's
cause hardly seemed to comport with such a conception.
</p><p>"I don't know what to do," she admitted wearily. "Obviously I can't make
the promise he asks and no more can I let him fly into a rage that may
kill him. I'm between the upper and nether mill-stones."
</p><p>The man nodded with a grave and courteous comprehension.
</p><p>"I hesitate to volunteer advice--and yet--" He came to a questioning
halt.
</p><p>"Yes," she prompted eagerly. "Please go on."
</p><p>"I had thought," he continued, with the diffident manner of a man
unaccustomed to proffering counsel before it was asked, "that, if you
cared to use me, I might be of some help--as an intermediary of sorts."
</p><p>"An intermediary?" she repeated. Then more impulsively, because she felt
that her attitude had been wanting in graciousness, she added, "I know
you're offering to do something very kind, but I'm afraid I don't quite
understand."
</p><p>"I think I am entirely in your father's confidence," he explained, "and
because, on many subjects, we hold common opinions, I can discuss--even
argue--matters with him without fear of antagonism or excitement to him.
Still I hope I am not too old to be in sympathy with your more youthful
and more modern outlook on life. If at any time I can help, please call
on me."
</p><p>They had been walking toward his buggy at the hitching post--it was not
a new or particularly well-kept vehicle--and there they halted.
</p><p>"This is good of you," she said, extending her hand cordially, and as he
took it he suggested, "Meanwhile an old man is not speedily weaned from
an idea which has taken deep root, and that brings me to another
suggestion." Once more he paused deferentially as if awaiting
permission, "if I may make it."
</p><p>"I wish you would."
</p><p>"It is the idea of Mr. Farquaharson's constant proximity and influence
which keeps your father's animosity stirred to combat. With a temporary
absence it would relax. I think it might even come to an automatic
end.... When Farquaharson returned Mr. Williams's mind might have lost
its inflammation."
</p><p>He smiled and shook the reins over the back of the old horse and when he
drove away he left Conscience standing with her lips parted and her gaze
set.
</p><p>Send Stuart away for a time! She had told that she could not stand it
without him, and now Tollman had expressed the unbiased view of one
whose personal desires were not blinding his judgment. She moved over to
the side of the road and leaned heavily against a tree. She felt as if
she were standing unprotected under the chilling beat of a cold and
driving rain, and her lips moved without sound, shaping again the three
words "send him away!"
</p><p>She had been holding her lover at her side until she could see his
nerves growing raw under the stress of his worry about herself and the
temper which nature had made chivalric giving way to acerbity. Yes,
Tollman was right--it required a sacrifice to save a wreck--and because
he was right the sun grew dark and the future as black as the floor of
the sea.
</p><p>But the next time she saw Stuart she did not broach the suggestion, nor
yet the next time after that. The man gave her no opportunity, so
indomitably was he waging his campaign to have her go. And as her
equally inflexible refusal stood impregnable against his assaults, he
grew desperate and reënforced his arguments with the accusation of
indifference to his wishes. In each succeeding discussion, his
infectious smile grew rarer and the drawn brow, that bore close kinship
to a frown, more habitual. His own talisman of humor was going from him,
and two unyielding determinations settled more and more directly at
cross odds.
</p><p>When the breach came it was almost entirely the Virginian's fault, or
the fault of the unsuspected Hyde who lurked behind his Jekyll.
</p><p>"Conscience," he pleaded desperately on the afternoon which neither of
them could ever remember afterwards without a sickness of the soul,
"you're simply building a funeral pyre for yourself. You're wrecking
your life and my life because of an insane idea. You're letting the
pettiest and unworthiest thing in you--a twisted instinct--consume all
that's vital and fine. You're worshiping the morbid."
</p><p>"If I'm guilty of all that" she answered with a haunted misery in her
eyes which she averted her face to hide, "I'm hardly worth fighting for.
The only answer I have is that I'm doing what seems right to me."
</p><p>"Can't you admit that for the moment your sense of right may be clouded?
All I ask is that you go for a while to the home of some friend, where
they don't rebuff the sunlight when it comes in at the window."
</p><p>"Stuart," she told him gently but with conviction, "you have changed,
too. Once I could have taken your advice as almost infallible, but I
can't now."
</p><p>The Virginian's face paled, and his question came with an irritable
quickness, "In what fashion have I changed?"
</p><p>"In a way, I think I've recovered my balance," she said with deep
seriousness. "I couldn't have done it without you. You've taken my
troubles on yourself, but at a heavy price, dear. They've preyed on you
until now it's <u>you</u> who can't trust his judgment. All you say
influences me, but it's no longer because of its logic, it's because I
love you and you're talking to my heart."
</p><p>Farquaharson paced the frosty path of the woods where they were talking.
His face was dark and his movements nervous so Conscience would not let
herself look at him. She had something difficult to say and of late she
had not felt strong enough to spend vitality with wastefulness.
</p><p>"You say I'm wrecking both our lives...." she went on resolutely. "I
don't want to wreck either ... but yours I couldn't bear to wreck. I
love you enough to make any sacrifice for you ... even enough to give
you up."
</p><p>Stuart wheeled and his attitude stiffened to rigidity. The woods raced
about him in crazy circles, and before his eyes swam spots of yellow and
orange.
</p><p>"Do you mean--" he paused to moisten his lips with his tongue and found
his tongue, too, suddenly dry--"do you mean that you've let this tyranny
of weakness conquer you? Have you promised to exile me?"
</p><p>She flinched as she had flinched on the one other occasion when he had
accused her of a disloyalty which would have been impossible to her, but
she was too unhappy to be angry.
</p><p>"No," she said slowly, "I haven't even considered such a promise. I said
just now that you had changed. The other Stuart Farquaharson wouldn't
have suspected me of that."
</p><p>"Then what in Heaven's name do you mean?"
</p><p>"I mean that you must go away--for awhile. It's only selfishness that
has blinded me to that all along. I'm killing all the best in you by
keeping you here."
</p><p>"You are strong enough to bear the direct strain, I suppose," he accused
with a bitter smile. "But I'm too weak to endure even its reflection."
</p><p>"It's always easier to bear trouble oneself," she reminded him with a
gracious patience, "than to see the person one loves subjected to it."
</p><p>"When did you think of this?"
</p><p>"I didn't think of it myself," she told him with candid directness. "I
guess I was too selfish. Mr. Tollman suggested it."
</p><p>"Mr. Tollman!" The name burst from his lips like an anathema and a
sudden gust of fury swept him from all moorings of control. "You love me
enough to give me up--on the advice of my enemies! You are deaf to all
my pleadings, but to the casual suggestion of this damned pharisee you
yield instant obedience. And what he suggests is that I be sent away."
</p><p>Her twisted fingers clenched themselves more tautly and had passion not
enveloped Stuart in a red wreath of fog he must have refrained from
adding to the acuteness of her torture just then.
</p><p>"Why," she asked faintly, "should he be your enemy?"
</p><p>"Because he wants you himself, because, with me disposed of, he believes
he can get what his unclean and avaricious heart covets as a snake
charms a bird, because--"
</p><p>Conscience rose with an effort to her feet. Her knees were trembling
under her and her heart seemed to close into a painful strangulation.
</p><p>"Stuart," she faltered, "if you think that my love can only be held
against any outsider by your being at hand to watch it, you don't trust
it as it <u>must</u> be trusted--and it isn't worth offering you at all."
</p><p>"You've fallen under the spell of these Mad Mullah prophets," he
retorted hotly, "until you can't trust yourself any longer. You've been
inflamed into the Mohammedan's spirit of a holy war and you're ready to
make a burnt offering of me and my love."
</p><p>"Now," she said with a faintness that was almost a whisper, "you <u>must</u>
go, whether you agree or not. You distrust me and insult me ... and I
don't think ... I can stand many ... interviews like this."
</p><p>But Farquaharson's curb had slipped. His anger was a frenzied runaway
which he, like a madman, was riding in utter recklessness.
</p><p>"If I go now," he violently protested, "if I am sent into exile at the
behest of Tollman, my enemy, I go for all time, knowing that the woman I
leave behind is not the woman I thought I knew or the woman I have
worshiped."
</p><p>Their eyes met and engaged in a challenge of wills in which neither
would surrender; a challenge which had built an issue out of nothing.
His burned with the moment's madness. Hers were clear and unflinching.
</p><p>"If you <u>can</u> go like that," she said, and the tremor left her voice as
she said it, "the man who goes isn't the man to whom I gave all my love
and to whom I was ready to give my life."
</p><p>She straightened, sustained by a temporary strength, and stood clothed
in a beauty above any which even he had before acknowledged; a beauty
fired with the war spirit of a Valkyrie and of eyes regal in their
affronted dignity. "If you can feel about me as your words indicate, we
could never know happiness. The man whose love can make such accusations
isn't the Stuart Farquaharson that made me willing to die for him.
Perhaps after all I only <u>dreamed</u> that man. It was a wonderful dream."
</p><p>She carried the fingers of one hand to her temple in a bewildered
gesture, then shook back her head as one rousing oneself with an effort
from sleep. "If it was a dream," she went on with a forced courage,
"it's just as well to find it out in time."
</p><p>"Then--" he made several attempts before he could speak--"then you are
sending me away. If that's true--as there's a God in Heaven, I'll never
come back until you send for me."
</p><p>"As there's a God in Heaven," she answered steadily, almost
contemptuously, "I'll never send for you. You'll never come back unless
you come yourself--and come with a more absolute trust in your heart."
</p><p>They stood under the leafless branches in a long silence, both white of
cheek and supremely shaken, until at last the man said huskily: "I
suppose I may take you to your gate?"
</p><p>She shook her head. "No," she answered firmly, "I'm going across the
field. It's only a step." She turned then and walked away and as he
looked after her she did not glance backward. An erect and regal
carriage covered the misery of her retreat--but when she reached her
house she went up the stairs like some creature mortally wounded and as
she closed the door of her room, there came from her throat a low and
agonized groan. She stood leaning for a space against the panels with
her hands stretched out gropingly against the woodwork. Her lips moved
vacantly, then her knees gave way and she crumpled down and lay
insensible on the floor.
