<p>Next morning at breakfast I missed Flossie and asked where she was.
</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said her mother, ‘when I got up this morning I found a note put
outside my door in which--But here it is, you can read it for yourself,’
and she gave me the slip of paper on which the following was written:--
</p><p>‘Dearest M--,--It is just dawn, and I am off to the hills to get Mr Q--a
bloom of the lily he wants, so don’t expect me till you see me. I have
taken the white donkey; and nurse and a couple of boys are coming with
me--also something to eat, as I may be away all day, for I am determined
to get the lily if I have to go twenty miles for it.--Flossie.’
</p>
<p>‘I hope she will be all right,’ I said, a little anxiously; ‘I never
meant her to trouble after the flower.’
</p><p>‘Ah, Flossie can look after herself,’ said her mother; ‘she often goes
off in this way like a true child of the wilderness.’ But Mr Mackenzie,
who came in just then and saw the note for the first time, looked rather
grave, though he said nothing.
</p><p>After breakfast was over I took him aside and asked him whether it would
not be possible to send after the girl and get her back, having in view
the possibility of there still being some Masai hanging about, at whose
hands she might come to harm.
</p><p>‘I fear it would be of no use,’ he answered. ‘She may be fifteen miles
off by now, and it is impossible to say what path she has taken.
There are the hills;’ and he pointed to a long range of rising ground
stretching almost parallel with the course followed by the river Tana,
but gradually sloping down to a dense bush-clad plain about five miles
short of the house.
</p><p>Here I suggested that we might get up the great tree over the house and
search the country round with a spyglass; and this, after Mr Mackenzie
had given some orders to his people to try and follow Flossie’s spoor,
we did.
</p><p>The ascent of the mighty tree was rather an alarming performance, even
with a sound rope-ladder fixed at both ends to climb up, at least to a
landsman; but Good came up like a lamplighter.
</p><p>On reaching the height at which the first fern-shaped boughs sprang
from the bole, we stepped without any difficulty upon a platform made
of boards, nailed from one bough to another, and large enough to
accommodate a dozen people. As for the view, it was simply glorious.
In every direction the bush rolled away in great billows for miles and
miles, as far as the glass would show, only here and there broken by the
brighter green of patches of cultivation, or by the glittering surface
of lakes. To the northwest, Kenia reared his mighty head, and we could
trace the Tana river curling like a silver snake almost from his feet,
and far away beyond us towards the ocean. It is a glorious country, and
only wants the hand of civilized man to make it a most productive one.
</p><p>But look as we would, we could see no signs of Flossie and her donkey,
so at last we had to come down disappointed. On reaching the veranda I
found Umslopogaas sitting there, slowly and lightly sharpening his axe
with a small whetstone he always carried with him.
</p><p>‘What doest thou, Umslopogaas?’ I asked.
</p><p>‘I smell blood,’ was the answer; and I could get no more out of him.
</p><p>After dinner we again went up the tree and searched the surrounding
country with a spyglass, but without result. When we came down
Umslopogaas was still sharpening Inkosi-kaas, although she already had
an edge like a razor. Standing in front of him, and regarding him with a
mixture of fear and fascination, was Alphonse. And certainly he did seem
an alarming object--sitting there, Zulu fashion, on his haunches, a wild
look upon his intensely savage and yet intellectual face, sharpening,
sharpening, sharpening at the murderous-looking axe.
</p><p>‘Oh, the monster, the horrible man!’ said the little French cook,
lifting his hands in amazement. ‘See but the hole in his head; the skin
beats on it up and down like a baby’s! Who would nurse such a baby?’ and
he burst out laughing at the idea.
</p><p>For a moment Umslopogaas looked up from his sharpening, and a sort of
evil light played in his dark eyes.
</p><p>‘What does the little “buffalo-heifer” [so named by Umslopogaas, on
account of his mustachios and feminine characteristics] say? Let him be
careful, or I will cut his horns. Beware, little man monkey, beware!’
</p><p>Unfortunately Alphonse, who was getting over his fear of him, went on
laughing at ‘ce drole d’un monsieur noir’. I was about to warn him to
desist, when suddenly the huge Zulu bounded off the veranda on to the
open space where Alphonse was standing, his features alive with a sort
of malicious enthusiasm, and began swinging the axe round and round over
the Frenchman’s head.
</p><p>‘Stand still,’ I shouted; ‘do not move as you value your life--he will
not hurt you;’ but I doubt if Alphonse heard me, being, fortunately for
himself, almost petrified with horror.
</p><p>Then followed the most extraordinary display of sword, or rather of
axemanship, that I ever saw. First of all the axe went flying round
and round over the top of Alphonse’s head, with an angry whirl and such
extraordinary swiftness that it looked like a continuous band of steel,
ever getting nearer and yet nearer to that unhappy individual’s skull,
till at last it grazed it as it flew. Then suddenly the motion was
changed, and it seemed to literally flow up and down his body and limbs,
never more than an eighth of an inch from them, and yet never striking
them. It was a wonderful sight to see the little man fixed there, having
apparently realized that to move would be to run the risk of sudden
death, while his black tormentor towered over him, and wrapped him round
with the quick flashes of the axe. For a minute or more this went
on, till suddenly I saw the moving brightness travel down the side of
Alphonse’s face, and then outwards and stop. As it did so a tuft of
something black fell to the ground; it was the tip of one of the little
Frenchman’s curling mustachios.
</p><p>Umslopogaas leant upon the handle of Inkosi-kaas, and broke into a long,
low laugh; and Alphonse, overcome with fear, sank into a sitting posture
on the ground, while we stood astonished at this exhibition of almost
superhuman skill and mastery of a weapon. ‘Inkosi-kaas is sharp enough,’
he shouted; ‘the blow that clipped the “buffalo-heifer’s” horn would
have split a man from the crown to the chin. Few could have struck it
but I; none could have struck it and not taken off the shoulder too.
Look, thou little heifer! Am I a good man to laugh at, thinkest thou?
For a space hast thou stood within a hair’s-breadth of death. Laugh not
again, lest the hair’s-breadth be wanting. I have spoken.’
</p><p>‘What meanest thou by such mad tricks?’ I asked of Umslopogaas,
indignantly. ‘Surely thou art mad. Twenty times didst thou go near to
slaying the man.’
</p><p>‘And yet, Macumazahn, I slew not. Thrice as Inkosi-kaas flew the spirit
entered into me to end him, and send her crashing through his skull; but
I did not. Nay, it was but a jest; but tell the “heifer” that it is not
well to mock at such as I. Now I go to make a shield, for I smell blood,
Macumazahn--of a truth I smell blood. Before the battle hast thou not
seen the vulture grow of a sudden in the sky? They smell the blood,
Macumazahn, and my scent is more keen than theirs. There is a dry
ox-hide down yonder; I go to make a shield.’
</p><p>‘That is an uncomfortable retainer of yours,’ said Mr Mackenzie, who had
witnessed this extraordinary scene. ‘He has frightened Alphonse out of
his wits; look!’ and he pointed to the Frenchman, who, with a scared
white face and trembling limbs, was making his way into the house. ‘I
don’t think that he will ever laugh at “le monsieur noir” again.’
</p><p>‘Yes,’ answered I, ‘it is ill jesting with such as he. When he is roused
he is like a fiend, and yet he has a kind heart in his own fierce way.
I remember years ago seeing him nurse a sick child for a week. He is a
strange character, but true as steel, and a strong stick to rest on in
danger.’
</p><p>‘He says he smells blood,’ said Mr Mackenzie. ‘I only trust he is not
right. I am getting very fearful about my little girl. She must have
gone far, or she would be home by now. It is half-past three o’clock.’
</p><p>I pointed out that she had taken food with her, and very likely would
not in the ordinary course of events return till nightfall; but I myself
felt very anxious, and fear that my anxiety betrayed itself.
</p><p>Shortly after this, the people whom Mr Mackenzie had sent out to search
for Flossie returned, stating that they had followed the spoor of the
donkey for a couple of miles and had then lost it on some stony ground,
nor could they discover it again. They had, however, scoured the country
far and wide, but without success.
</p><p>After this the afternoon wore drearily on, and towards evening, there
still being no signs of Flossie, our anxiety grew very keen. As for the
poor mother, she was quite prostrated by her fears, and no wonder, but
the father kept his head wonderfully well. Everything that could be done
was done: people were sent out in all directions, shots were fired, and
a continuous outlook kept from the great tree, but without avail.
</p><p>And then it grew dark, and still no sign of fair-haired little Flossie.
</p><p>At eight o’clock we had supper. It was but a sorrowful meal, and Mrs
Mackenzie did not appear at it. We three also were very silent, for in
addition to our natural anxiety as to the fate of the child, we were
weighed down by the sense that we had brought this trouble on the head
of our kind host. When supper was nearly at an end I made an excuse to
leave the table. I wanted to get outside and think the situation over. I
went on to the veranda and, having lit my pipe, sat down on a seat about
a dozen feet from the right-hand end of the structure, which was, as
the reader may remember, exactly opposite one of the narrow doors of the
protecting wall that enclosed the house and flower garden. I had been
sitting there perhaps six or seven minutes when I thought I heard the
door move. I looked in that direction and I listened, but, being unable
to make out anything, concluded that I must have been mistaken. It was a
darkish night, the moon not having yet risen.
</p><p>Another minute passed, when suddenly something round fell with a soft
but heavy thud upon the stone flooring of the veranda, and came
bounding and rolling along past me. For a moment I did not rise, but sat
wondering what it could be. Finally, I concluded it must have been an
animal. Just then, however, another idea struck me, and I got up quick
enough. The thing lay quite still a few feet beyond me. I put down my
hand towards it and it did not move: clearly it was not an animal. My
hand touched it. It was soft and warm and heavy. Hurriedly I lifted it
and held it up against the faint starlight.
</p><p>_It was a newly severed human head!_
</p><p>I am an old hand and not easily upset, but I own that that ghastly sight
made me feel sick. How had the thing come there? Whose was it? I put it
down and ran to the little doorway. I could see nothing, hear nobody. I
was about to go out into the darkness beyond, but remembering that to do
so was to expose myself to the risk of being stabbed, I drew back,
shut the door, and bolted it. Then I returned to the veranda, and in as
careless a voice as I could command called Curtis. I fear, however, that
my tones must have betrayed me, for not only Sir Henry but also Good and
Mackenzie rose from the table and came hurrying out.
</p><p>‘What is it?’ said the clergyman, anxiously.
</p><p>Then I had to tell them.
</p><p>Mr Mackenzie turned pale as death under his red skin. We were standing
opposite the hall door, and there was a light in it so that I could see.
He snatched the head up by the hair and held it against the light.
</p><p>‘It is the head of one of the men who accompanied Flossie,’ he said with
a gasp. ‘Thank God it is not hers!’
</p><p>We all stood and stared at each other aghast. What was to be done?
</p><p>Just then there was a knocking at the door that I had bolted, and a
voice cried, ‘Open, my father, open!’
</p><p>The door was unlocked, and in sped a terrified man. He was one of the
spies who had been sent out.
</p><p>‘My father,’ he cried, ‘the Masai are on us! A great body of them have
passed round the hill and are moving towards the old stone kraal down
by the little stream. My father, make strong thy heart! In the midst
of them I saw the white ass, and on it sat the Water-lily [Flossie]. An
Elmoran [young warrior] led the ass, and by its side walked the nurse
weeping. The men who went with her in the morning I saw not.’
</p><p>‘Was the child alive?’ asked Mr Mackenzie, hoarsely.
</p><p>‘She was white as the snow, but well, my father. They passed quite close
to me, and looking up from where I lay hid I saw her face against the
sky.’
</p><p>‘God help her and us!’ groaned the clergyman.
</p><p>‘How many are there of them?’ I asked.
</p><p>‘More than two hundred--two hundred and half a hundred.’
</p><p>Once more we looked one on the other. What was to be done? Just then
there rose a loud insistent cry outside the wall.
</p><p>‘Open the door, white man; open the door! A herald--a herald to speak
with thee.’ Thus cried the voice.
</p><p>Umslopogaas ran to the wall, and, reaching with his long arms to the
coping, lifted his head above it and gazed over.
</p><p>‘I see but one man,’ he said. ‘He is armed, and carries a basket in his
hand.’
</p><p>‘Open the door,’ I said. ‘Umslopogaas, take thine axe and stand thereby.
Let one man pass. If another follows, slay.’
</p><p>The door was unbarred. In the shadow of the wall stood Umslopogaas, his
axe raised above his head to strike. Just then the moon came out. There
was a moment’s pause, and then in stalked a Masai Elmoran, clad in the
full war panoply that I have already described, but bearing a large
basket in his hand. The moonlight shone bright upon his great spear
as he walked. He was physically a splendid man, apparently about
thirty-five years of age. Indeed, none of the Masai that I saw were
under six feet high, though mostly quite young. When he got opposite to
us he halted, put down the basket, and stuck the spike of his spear into
the ground, so that it stood upright.
</p><p>‘Let us talk,’ he said. ‘The first messenger we sent to you could not
talk;’ and he pointed to the head which lay upon the paving of the
stoep--a ghastly sight in the moonlight; ‘but I have words to speak
if ye have ears to hear. Also I bring presents;’ and he pointed to the
basket and laughed with an air of swaggering insolence that is perfectly
indescribable, and yet which one could not but admire, seeing that he
was surrounded by enemies.
</p><p>‘Say on,’ said Mr Mackenzie.
</p><p>‘I am the “Lygonani” [war captain] of a party of the Masai of the Guasa
Amboni. I and my men followed these three white men,’ and he pointed
to Sir Henry, Good, and myself, ‘but they were too clever for us, and
escaped hither. We have a quarrel with them, and are going to kill
them.’
</p><p>‘Are you, my friend?’ said I to myself.
</p><p>‘In following these men we this morning caught two black men, one
black woman, a white donkey, and a white girl. One of the black men we
killed--there is his head upon the pavement; the other ran away. The
black woman, the little white girl, and the white ass we took and
brought with us. In proof thereof have I brought this basket that she
carried. Is it not thy daughter’s basket?’
</p><p>Mr Mackenzie nodded, and the warrior went on.
</p><p>‘Good! With thee and thy daughter we have no quarrel, nor do we wish to
harm thee, save as to thy cattle, which we have already gathered, two
hundred and forty head--a beast for every man’s father.’ {Endnote 6}
</p><p>Here Mr Mackenzie gave a groan, as he greatly valued this herd of
cattle, which he bred with much care and trouble.
</p><p>‘So, save for the cattle, thou mayst go free; more especially,’ he added
frankly, glancing at the wall, ‘as this place would be a difficult one
to take. But as to these men it is otherwise; we have followed them
for nights and days, and must kill them. Were we to return to our kraal
without having done so, all the girls would make a mock of us. So,
however troublesome it may be, they must die.
</p><p>‘Now I have a proposition for thee. We would not harm the little girl;
she is too fair to harm, and has besides a brave spirit. Give us one of
these three men--a life for a life--and we will let her go, and throw in
the black woman with her also. This is a fair offer, white man. We ask
but for one, not for the three; we must take another opportunity to kill
the other two. I do not even pick my man, though I should prefer the
big one,’ pointing to Sir Henry; ‘he looks strong, and would die more
slowly.’
</p><p>‘And if I say I will not yield the man?’ said Mr Mackenzie.
</p><p>‘Nay, say not so, white man,’ answered the Masai, ‘for then thy daughter
dies at dawn, and the woman with her says thou hast no other child. Were
she older I would take her for a servant; but as she is so young I will
slay her with my own hand--ay, with this very spear. Thou canst come and
see, an’ thou wilt. I give thee a safe conduct;’ and the fiend laughed
aloud as his brutal jest.
</p><p>Meanwhile I had been thinking rapidly, as one does in emergencies, and
had come to the conclusion that I would exchange myself against
Flossie. I scarcely like to mention the matter for fear it should be
misunderstood. Pray do not let any one be misled into thinking that
there was anything heroic about this, or any such nonsense. It was
merely a matter of common sense and common justice. My life was an old
and worthless one, hers was young and valuable. Her death would pretty
well kill her father and mother also, whilst nobody would be much the
worse for mine; indeed, several charitable institutions would have cause
to rejoice thereat. It was indirectly through me that the dear little
girl was in her present position. Lastly, a man was better fitted to
meet death in such a peculiarly awful form than a sweet young girl. Not,
however, that I meant to let these gentry torture me to death--I am far
too much of a coward to allow that, being naturally a timid man; my plan
was to see the girl safely exchanged and then to shoot myself, trusting
that the Almighty would take the peculiar circumstances of the case into
consideration and pardon the act. All this and more went through my mind
in very few seconds.
</p><p>‘All right, Mackenzie,’ I said, ‘you can tell the man that I will
exchange myself against Flossie, only I stipulate that she shall be
safely in this house before they kill me.’
</p><p>‘Eh?’ said Sir Henry and Good simultaneously. ‘That you don’t.’
</p><p>‘No, no,’ said Mr Mackenzie. ‘I will have no man’s blood upon my hands.
If it please God that my daughter should die this awful death, His will
be done. You are a brave man (which I am not by any means) and a noble
man, Quatermain, but you shall not go.’
</p><p>‘If nothing else turns up I shall go,’ I said decidedly.
</p><p>‘This is an important matter,’ said Mackenzie, addressing the Lygonani,
‘and we must think it over. You shall have our answer at dawn.’
</p><p>‘Very well, white man,’ answered the savage indifferently; ‘only
remember if thy answer is late thy little white bud will never grow into
a flower, that is all, for I shall cut it with this,’ and he touched the
spear. ‘I should have thought that thou wouldst play a trick and attack
us at night, but I know from the woman with the girl that your men are
down at the coast, and that thou hast but twenty men here. It is not
wise, white man,’ he added with a laugh, ‘to keep so small a garrison
for your “boma” [kraal]. Well, good night, and good night to you also,
other white men, whose eyelids I shall soon close once and for all. At
dawn thou wilt bring me word. If not, remember it shall be as I have
said.’ Then turning to Umslopogaas, who had all the while been standing
behind him and shepherding him as it were, ‘Open the door for me,
fellow, quick now.’
</p><p>This was too much for the old chief’s patience. For the last ten minutes
his lips had been, figuratively speaking, positively watering over the
Masai Lygonani, and this he could not stand. Placing his long hand
on the Elmoran’s shoulder he gripped it and gave him such a twist
as brought him face to face with himself. Then, thrusting his fierce
countenance to within a few inches of the Masai’s evil feather-framed
features, he said in a low growling voice:--
</p><p>‘Seest thou me?’
</p><p>‘Ay, fellow, I see thee.’
</p><p>‘And seest thou this?’ and he held Inkosi-kaas before his eyes.
</p><p>‘Ay, fellow, I see the toy; what of it?’
</p><p>‘Thou Masai dog, thou boasting windbag, thou capturer of little girls,
with this “toy” will I hew thee limb from limb. Well for thee that thou
art a herald, or even now would I strew thy members about the grass.’
</p><p>The Masai shook his great spear and laughed loud and long as he
answered, ‘I would that thou stoodst against me man to man, and we would
see,’ and again he turned to go still laughing.
</p><p>‘Thou shalt stand against me man to man, be not afraid,’ replied
Umslopogaas, still in the same ominous voice. ‘Thou shalt stand face
to face with Umslopogaas, of the blood of Chaka, of the people of the
Amazulu, a captain in the regiment of the Nkomabakosi, as many have done
before, and bow thyself to Inkosi-kaas, as many have done before. Ay,
laugh on, laugh on! tomorrow night shall the jackals laugh as they
crunch thy ribs.’
</p><p>When the Lygonani had gone, one of us thought of opening the basket
he had brought as a proof that Flossie was really their prisoner. On
lifting the lid it was found to contain a most lovely specimen of both
bulb and flower of the Goya lily, which I have already described, in
full bloom and quite uninjured, and what was more a note in Flossie’s
childish hand written in pencil upon a greasy piece of paper that had
been used to wrap up some food in:--
</p><p>‘Dearest Father and Mother,’ ran the note, ‘The Masai caught us when we
were coming home with the lily. I tried to escape but could not. They
killed Tom: the other man ran away. They have not hurt nurse and me, but
say that they mean to exchange us against one of Mr Quatermain’s party.
<u>I will have nothing of the sort</u>. Do not let anybody give his life
for me. Try and attack them at night; they are going to feast on three
bullocks they have stolen and killed. I have my pistol, and if no
help comes by dawn I will shoot myself. They shall not kill me. If so,
remember me always, dearest father and mother. I am very frightened,
but I trust in God. I dare not write any more as they are beginning to
notice. Goodbye.--Flossie.’
</p>
<p>Scrawled across the outside of this was ‘Love to Mr Quatermain. They are
going to take the basket, so he will get the lily.’
</p><p>When I read those words, written by that brave little girl in an hour
of danger sufficiently near and horrible to have turned the brain of
a strong man, I own I wept, and once more in my heart I vowed that she
should not die while my life could be given to save her.
</p><p>Then eagerly, quickly, almost fiercely, we fell to discussing the
situation. Again I said that I would go, and again Mackenzie negatived
it, and Curtis and Good, like the true men that they are, vowed that, if
I did, they would go with me, and die back to back with me.
</p><p>‘It is,’ I said at last, ‘absolutely necessary that an effort of some
sort should be made before the morning.’
</p><p>‘Then let us attack them with what force we can muster, and take our
chance,’ said Sir Henry.
</p><p>‘Ay, ay,’ growled Umslopogaas, in Zulu; ‘spoken like a man, Incubu. What
is there to be afraid of? Two hundred and fifty Masai, forsooth! How
many are we? The chief there [Mr Mackenzie] has twenty men, and thou,
Macumazahn, hast five men, and there are also five white men--that is,
thirty men in all--enough, enough. Listen now, Macumazahn, thou who art
very clever and old in war. What says the maid? These men eat and make
merry; let it be their funeral feast. What said the dog whom I hope to
hew down at daybreak? That he feared no attack because we were so few.
Knowest thou the old kraal where the men have camped? I saw it this
morning; it is thus:’ and he drew an oval on the floor; ‘here is the big
entrance, filled up with thorn bushes, and opening on to a steep rise.
Why, Incubu, thou and I with axes will hold it against an hundred men
striving to break out! Look, now; thus shall the battle go. Just as the
light begins to glint upon the oxen’s horns--not before, or it will be
too dark, and not later, or they will be awakening and perceive us--let
Bougwan creep round with ten men to the top end of the kraal, where the
narrow entrance is. Let them silently slay the sentry there so that he
makes no sound, and stand ready. Then, Incubu, let thee and me and one
of the Askari--the one with the broad chest--he is a brave man--creep to
the wide entrance that is filled with thorn bushes, and there also slay
the sentry, and armed with battleaxes take our stand also one on each
side of the pathway, and one a few paces beyond to deal with such as
pass the twain at the gate. It is there that the rush will come. That
will leave sixteen men. Let these men be divided into two parties, with
one of which shalt thou go, Macumazahn, and with one the “praying man”
 [Mr Mackenzie], and, all armed with rifles, let them make their way
one to the right side of the kraal and one to the left; and when thou,
Macumazahn, lowest like an ox, all shall open fire with the guns upon
the sleeping men, being very careful not to hit the little maid. Then
shall Bougwan at the far end and his ten men raise the war-cry, and,
springing over the wall, put the Masai there to the sword. And it shall
happen that, being yet heavy with food and sleep, and bewildered by the
firing of the guns, the falling of men, and the spears of Bougwan, the
soldiers shall rise and rush like wild game towards the thorn-stopped
entrance, and there the bullets from either side shall plough through
them, and there shall Incubu and the Askari and I wait for those who
break across. Such is my plan, Macumazahn; if thou hast a better, name
it.’
</p><p>When he had done, I explained to the others such portions of his
scheme as they had failed to understand, and they all joined with me in
expressing the greatest admiration of the acute and skilful programme
devised by the old Zulu, who was indeed, in his own savage fashion,
the finest general I ever knew. After some discussion we determined to
accept the scheme, as it stood, it being the only one possible under the
circumstances, and giving the best chance of success that such a forlorn
hope would admit of--which, however, considering the enormous odds and
the character of our foe, was not very great.
</p><p>‘Ah, old lion!’ I said to Umslopogaas, ‘thou knowest how to lie in wait
as well as how to bite, where to seize as well as where to hang on.’
</p><p>‘Ay, ay, Macumazahn,’ he answered. ‘For thirty years have I been a
warrior, and have seen many things. It will be a good fight. I smell
blood--I tell thee, I smell blood.’
