<p>Along this particular stretch of line no express had ever passed.
All the trains&mdash;the few that there were&mdash;stopped at all the stations.
Denis knew the names of those stations by heart. Bole, Tritton,
Spavin Delawarr, Knipswich for Timpany, West Bowlby, and, finally,
Camlet-on-the-Water. Camlet was where he always got out, leaving
the train to creep indolently onward, goodness only knew whither,
into the green heart of England.</p>

<p>They were snorting out of West Bowlby now. It was the next station,
thank Heaven. Denis took his chattels off the rack and piled them
neatly in the corner opposite his own. A futile proceeding. But
one must have something to do. When he had finished, he sank back
into his seat and closed his eyes. It was extremely hot.</p>

<p>Oh, this journey! It was two hours cut clean out of his life;
two hours in which he might have done so much, so much&mdash;written
the perfect poem, for example, or read the one illuminating book.
Instead of which&mdash;his gorge rose at the smell of the dusty cushions
against which he was leaning.</p>

<p>Two hours. One hundred and twenty minutes. Anything might be
done in that time. Anything. Nothing. Oh, he had had hundreds
of hours, and what had he done with them? Wasted them, spilt the
precious minutes as though his reservoir were inexhaustible. Denis
groaned in the spirit, condemned himself utterly with all his
works. What right had he to sit in the sunshine, to occupy corner
seats in third-class carriages, to be alive? None, none, none.</p>

<p>Misery and a nameless nostalgic distress possessed him. He was
twenty-three, and oh! so agonizingly conscious of the fact.</p>

<p>The train came bumpingly to a halt. Here was Camlet at last.
Denis jumped up, crammed his hat over his eyes, deranged his pile
of baggage, leaned out of the window and shouted for a porter,
seized a bag in either hand, and had to put them down again in
order to open the door. When at last he had safely bundled himself
and his baggage on to the platform, he ran up the train towards
the van.</p>

<p>"A bicycle, a bicycle!" he said breathlessly to the guard. He
felt himself a man of action. The guard paid no attention, but
continued methodically to hand out, one by one, the packages labelled
to Camlet. "A bicycle!" Denis repeated. "A green machine, cross-framed,
name of Stone. <em>S-T-O-N-E</em>."</p>

<p>"All in good time, sir," said the guard soothingly. He was a
large, stately man with a naval beard. One pictured him at home,
drinking tea, surrounded by a numerous family. It was in that
tone that he must have spoken to his children when they were tiresome.
"All in good time, sir."  Denis’s man of action collapsed, punctured.</p>

<p>He left his luggage to be called for later, and pushed off on
his bicycle. He always took his bicycle when he went into the
country. It was part of the theory of exercise. One day one would
get up at six o’clock and pedal away to Kenilworth, or Stratford-on-Avon&mdash;anywhere.
And within a radius of twenty miles there were always Norman churches
and Tudor mansions to be seen in the course of an afternoon’s
excursion. Somehow they never did get seen, but all the same it
was nice to feel that the bicycle was there, and that one fine
morning one really might get up at six.</p>

<p>Once at the top of the long hill which led up from Camlet station,
he felt his spirits mounting. The world, he found, was good. The
far-away blue hills, the harvests whitening on the slopes of the
ridge along which his road led him, the treeless sky-lines that
changed as he moved&mdash;yes, they were all good. He was overcome
by the beauty of those deeply embayed combes, scooped in the flanks
of the ridge beneath him. Curves, curves: he repeated the word
slowly, trying as he did so to find some term in which to give
expression to his appreciation. Curves&mdash;no, that was inadequate.
He made a gesture with his hand, as though to scoop the achieved
expression out of the air, and almost fell off his bicycle. What
was the word to describe the curves of those little valleys? They
were as fine as the lines of a human body, they were informed
with the subtlety of art...</p>

<p>Galbe. That was a good word; but it was French. Le galbe evase
de ses hanches: had one ever read a French novel in which that
phrase didn’t occur? Some day he would compile a dictionary for
the use of novelists. Galbe, gonfle, goulu: parfum, peau, pervers,
potele, pudeur: vertu, volupte.</p>

<p>But he really must find that word. Curves curves...Those little
valleys had the lines of a cup moulded round a woman’s breast;
they seemed the dinted imprints of some huge divine body that
had rested on these hills. Cumbrous locutions, these; but through
them he seemed to be getting nearer to what he wanted. Dinted,
dimpled, wimpled&mdash;his mind wandered down echoing corridors of
assonance and alliteration ever further and further from the point.
He was enamoured with the beauty of words.</p>

<p>Becoming once more aware of the outer world, he found himself
on the crest of a descent. The road plunged down, steep and straight,
into a considerable valley. There, on the opposite slope, a little
higher up the valley, stood Crome, his destination. He put on
his brakes; this view of Crome was pleasant to linger over. The
facade with its three projecting towers rose precipitously from
among the dark trees of the garden. The house basked in full sunlight;
the old brick rosily glowed. How ripe and rich it was, how superbly
mellow! And at the same time, how austere! The hill was becoming
steeper and steeper; he was gaining speed in spite of his brakes.
He loosed his grip of the levers, and in a moment was rushing
headlong down. Five minutes later he was passing through the gate
of the great courtyard. The front door stood hospitably open.
He left his bicycle leaning against the wall and walked in. He
would take them by surprise.</p>
