<p>"Drive me somewhere to breakfast, Archie," I said, "for I’m perishing
hungry."</p>

<p>He and I got into the tonneau, and the driver swung us out of
the station road up a long incline of hill. Sir Archie had been
one of my subalterns in the old Lennox Highlanders, and had left
us before the Somme to join the Flying Corps. I had heard that
he had got his wings and had done well before Arras, and was now
training pilots at home. He had been a light-hearted youth, who
had endured a good deal of rough-tonguing from me for his sins
of omission. But it was the casual class of lad I was looking
for now.</p>

<p>I saw him steal amused glances at my appearance.</p>

<p>"Been seein’ a bit of life, sir?" he inquired respectfully.</p>

<p>"I’m being hunted by the police," I said.</p>

<p>"Dirty dogs! But don’t worry, sir; we’ll get you off all right.
I’ve been in the same fix myself. You can lie snug in my little
log hut, for that old image Gibbons won’t blab. Or, tell you what,
I’ve got an aunt who lives near here and she’s a bit of a sportsman.
You can hide in her moated grange till the bobbies get tired."</p>

<p>I think it was Archie’s calm acceptance of my position as natural
and becoming that restored my good temper. He was far too well
bred to ask what crime I had committed, and I didn’t propose to
enlighten him much. But as we swung up the moorland road I let
him know that I was serving the Government, but that it was necessary
that I should appear to be unauthenticated and that therefore
I must dodge the police. He whistled his appreciation.</p>

<p>"Gad, that’s a deep game. Sort of camouflage? Speaking from my
experience it is easy to overdo that kind of stunt. When I was
at Misieux the French started out to camouflage the caravans where
they keep their pigeons, and they did it so damned well that the
poor little birds couldn’t hit ’em off, and spent the night out."</p>

<p>We entered the white gates of a big aerodrome, skirted a forest
of tents and huts, and drew up at a shanty on the far confines
of the place. The hour was half past four, and the world was still
asleep. Archie nodded towards one of the hangars, from the mouth
of which projected the propeller end of an aeroplane.</p>

<p>"I’m by way of flyin’ that bus down to Farnton tomorrow," he
remarked. "It’s the new Shark-Gladas. Got a mouth like a tree."</p>

<p>An idea flashed into my mind.</p>

<p>"You’re going this morning," I said.</p>

<p>"How did you know?" he exclaimed. "I’m due to go today, but the
grouse up in Caithness wanted shootin’ so badly that I decided
to wangle another day’s leave. They can’t expect a man to start
for the south of England when he’s just off a frowsy journey."</p>

<p>"All the same you’re going to be a stout fellow and start in
two hours’ time. And you’re going to take me with you."</p>

<p>He stared blankly, and then burst into a roar of laughter. "You’re
the man to go tiger-shootin’ with. But what price my commandant?
He’s not a bad chap, but a trifle shaggy about the fetlocks. He
won’t appreciate the joke."</p>

<p>"He needn’t know. He mustn’t know. This is an affair between
you and me till it’s finished. I promise you I’ll make it all
square with the Flying Corps. Get me down to Farnton before evening,
and you’ll have done a good piece of work for the country."</p>

<p>"Right-o! Let’s have a tub and a bit of breakfast, and then I’m
your man. I’ll tell them to get the bus ready."</p>

<p>In Archie’s bedroom I washed and shaved and borrowed a green
tweed cap and a brand-new aquascutum. The latter covered the deficiencies
of my raiment, and when I commandeered a pair of gloves I felt
almost respectable. Gibbons, who seemed to be a jack-of-all-trades,
cooked us some bacon and an omelette, and as he ate Archie yarned.
In the battalion his conversation had been mostly of race-meetings
and the forsaken delights of town, but now he had forgotten all
that, and, like every good airman I have ever known, wallowed
enthusiastically in "shop". I have a deep respect for the Flying
Corps, but it is apt to change its jargon every month, and its
conversation is hard for the layman to follow. He was desperately
keen about the war, which he saw wholly from the viewpoint of
the air. Arras to him was over before the infantry crossed the
top, and the tough bit of the Somme was October, not September.
He calculated that the big air-fighting had not come along yet,
and all he hoped for was to be allowed out to France to have his
share in it. Like all good airmen, too, he was very modest about
himself. "I’ve done a bit of steeple-chasin’ and huntin’ and I’ve
good hands for a horse, so I can handle a bus fairly well. It’s
all a matter of hands, you know. There ain’t half the risk of
the infantry down below you, and a million times the fun. Jolly
glad I changed, sir."</p>

<p>We talked of Peter, and he put him about top. Voss, he thought,
was the only Boche that could compare with him, for he hadn’t
made up his mind about Lensch. The Frenchman Guynemer he ranked
high, but in a different way. I remember he had no respect for
Richthofen and his celebrated circus.</p>

<p>At six sharp we were ready to go. A couple of mechanics had got
out the machine, and Archie put on his coat and gloves and climbed
into the pilot’s seat, while I squeezed in behind in the observer’s
place. The aerodrome was waking up, but I saw no officers about.
We were scarcely seated when Gibbons called our attention to a
motor-car on the road, and presently we heard a shout and saw
men waving in our direction.</p>

<p>"Better get off, my lad," I said. "These look like my friends."</p>

<p>The engine started and the mechanics stood clear. As we taxied
over the turf I looked back and saw several figures running in
our direction. The next second we had left the bumpy earth for
the smooth highroad of the air.</p>

<p>I had flown several dozen times before, generally over the enemy
lines when I wanted to see for myself how the land lay. Then we
had flown low, and been nicely dusted by the Hun Archies, not
to speak of an occasional machine-gun. But never till that hour
had I realised the joy of a straight flight in a swift plane in
perfect weather. Archie didn’t lose time. Soon the hangars behind
looked like a child’s toys, and the world ran away from us till
it seemed like a great golden bowl spilling over with the quintessence
of light. The air was cold and my hands numbed, but I never felt
them. As we throbbed and tore southward, sometimes bumping in
eddies, sometimes swimming evenly in a stream of motionless ether,
my head and heart grew as light as a boy’s. I forgot all about
the vexations of my job and saw only its joyful comedy. I didn’t
think that anything on earth could worry me again. Far to the
left was a wedge of silver and beside it a cluster of toy houses.
That must be Edinburgh, where reposed my portmanteau, and where
a most efficient police force was now inquiring for me. At the
thought I laughed so loud that Archie must have heard me. He turned
round, saw my grinning face, and grinned back. Then he signalled
to me to strap myself in. I obeyed, and he proceeded to practise
"stunts"—the loop, the spinning nose-dive, and others I didn’t
know the names of. It was glorious fun, and he handled his machine
as a good rider coaxes a nervous horse over a stiff hurdle. He
had that extra something in his blood that makes the great pilot.</p>

<p>Presently the chessboard of green and brown had changed to a
deep purple with faint silvery lines like veins in a rock. We
were crossing the Border hills, the place where I had legged it
for weary days when I was mixed up in the Black Stone business.
What a marvellous element was this air, which took one far above
the fatigues of humanity! Archie had done well to change. Peter
had been the wise man. I felt a tremendous pity for my old friend
hobbling about a German prison-yard, when he had once flown a
hawk. I reflected that I had wasted my life hitherto. And then
I remembered that all this glory had only one use in war and that
was to help the muddy British infantryman to down his Hun opponent.
He was the fellow, after all, that decided battles, and the thought
comforted me.</p>

<p>A great exhilaration is often the precursor of disaster, and
mine was to have a sudden downfall. It was getting on for noon
and we were well into England—I guessed from the rivers we had
passed that we were somewhere in the north of Yorkshire—when the
machine began to make odd sounds, and we bumped in perfectly calm
patches of air. We dived and then climbed, but the confounded
thing kept sputtering. Archie passed back a slip of paper on which
he had scribbled: "Engine conked. Must land at Micklegill. Very
sorry." So we dropped to a lower elevation where we could see
clearly the houses and roads and the long swelling ridges of a
moorland country. I could never have found my way about, but Archie’s
practised eye knew every landmark. We were trundling along very
slowly now, and even I was soon able to pick up the hangars of
a big aerodrome.</p>

<p>We made Micklegill, but only by the skin of our teeth. We were
so low that the smoky chimneys of the city of Bradfield seven
miles to the east were half hidden by a ridge of down. Archie
achieved a clever descent in the lee of a belt of firs, and got
out full of imprecations against the Gladas engine. "I’ll go up
to the camp and report," he said, "and send mechanics down to
tinker this darned gramophone. You’d better go for a walk, sir.
I don’t want to answer questions about you till we’re ready to
start. I reckon it’ll be an hour’s job."</p>

<p>The cheerfulness I had acquired in the upper air still filled
me. I sat down in a ditch, as merry as a sand-boy, and lit a pipe.
I was possessed by a boyish spirit of casual adventure, and waited
on the next turn of fortune’s wheel with only a pleasant amusement.</p>

<p>That turn was not long in coming. Archie appeared very breathless.</p>

<p>"Look here, sir, there’s the deuce of a row up there. They’ve
been wirin’ about you all over the country, and they know you’re
with me. They’ve got the police, and they’ll have you in five
minutes if you don’t leg it. I lied like billy-o and said I had
never heard of you, but they’re comin’ to see for themselves.
For God’s sake get off.... You’d better keep in cover down that
hollow and round the back of these trees. I’ll stay here and try
to brazen it out. I’ll get strafed to blazes anyhow.... I hope
you’ll get me out of the scrape, sir."</p>

<p>"Don’t you worry, my lad," I said. "I’ll make it all square when
I get back to town. I’ll make for Bradfield, for this place is
a bit conspicuous. Goodbye, Archie. You’re a good chap and I’ll
see you don’t suffer."</p>

<p>I started off down the hollow of the moor, trying to make speed
atone for lack of strategy, for it was hard to know how much my
pursuers commanded from that higher ground. They must have seen
me, for I heard whistles blown and men’s cries. I struck a road,
crossed it, and passed a ridge from which I had a view of Bradfield
six miles off. And as I ran I began to reflect that this kind
of chase could not last long. They were bound to round me up in
the next half-hour unless I could puzzle them. But in that bare
green place there was no cover, and it looked as if my chances
were pretty much those of a hare coursed by a good greyhound on
a naked moor.</p>

<p>Suddenly from just in front of me came a familiar sound. It was
the roar of guns—the slam of field-batteries and the boom of small
howitzers. I wondered if I had gone off my head. As I plodded
on the rattle of machine-guns was added, and over the ridge before
me I saw the dust and fumes of bursting shells. I concluded that
I was not mad, and that therefore the Germans must have landed.
I crawled up the last slope, quite forgetting the pursuit behind
me.</p>

<p>And then I’m blessed if I did not look down on a veritable battle.</p>

<p>There were two sets of trenches with barbed wire and all the
fixings, one set filled with troops and the other empty. On these
latter shells were bursting, but there was no sign of life in
them. In the other lines there seemed the better part of two brigades,
and the first trench was stiff with bayonets. My first thought
was that Home Forces had gone dotty, for this kind of show could
have no sort of training value. And then I saw other things—cameras
and camera-men on platforms on the flanks, and men with megaphones
behind them on wooden scaffoldings. One of the megaphones was
going full blast all the time.</p>

<p>I saw the meaning of the performance at last. Some movie-merchant
had got a graft with the Government, and troops had been turned
out to make a war film. It occurred to me that if I were mixed
up in that push I might get the cover I was looking for. I scurried
down the hill to the nearest camera-man.</p>

<p>As I ran, the first wave of troops went over the top. They did
it uncommon well, for they entered into the spirit of the thing,
and went over with grim faces and that slow, purposeful lope that
I had seen in my own fellows at Arras. Smoke grenades burst among
them, and now and then some resourceful mountebank would roll
over. Altogether it was about the best show I have ever seen.
The cameras clicked, the guns banged, a background of boy scouts
applauded, and the dust rose in billows to the sky.</p>

<p>But all the same something was wrong. I could imagine that this
kind of business took a good deal of planning from the point of
view of the movie-merchant, for his purpose was not the same as
that of the officer in command. You know how a photographer finicks
about and is dissatisfied with a pose that seems all right to
his sitter. I should have thought the spectacle enough to get
any cinema audience off their feet, but the man on the scaffolding
near me judged differently. He made his megaphone boom like the
swan-song of a dying buffalo. He wanted to change something and
didn’t know how to do it. He hopped on one leg; he took the megaphone
from his mouth to curse; he waved it like a banner and yelled
at some opposite number on the other flank. And then his patience
forsook him and he skipped down the ladder, dropping his megaphone,
past the camera-men, on to the battlefield.</p>

<p>That was his undoing. He got in the way of the second wave and
was swallowed up like a leaf in a torrent. For a moment I saw
a red face and a loud-checked suit, and the rest was silence.
He was carried on over the hill, or rolled into an enemy trench,
but anyhow he was lost to my ken.</p>

<p>I bagged his megaphone and hopped up the steps to the platform.
At last I saw a chance of first-class cover, for with Archie’s
coat and cap I made a very good appearance as a movie-merchant.
Two waves had gone over the top, and the cinema-men, working like
beavers, had filmed the lot. But there was still a fair amount
of troops to play with, and I determined to tangle up that outfit
so that the fellows who were after me would have better things
to think about.</p>

<p>My advantage was that I knew how to command men. I could see
that my opposite number with the megaphone was helpless, for the
mistake which had swept my man into a shell-hole had reduced him
to impotence. The troops seemed to be mainly in charge of <em>N.C.O.</em>s
(I could imagine that the officers would try to shirk this business),
and an <em>N.C.O. </em>is the most literal creature on earth.
So with my megaphone I proceeded to change the battle order.</p>

<p>I brought up the third wave to the front trenches. In about three
minutes the men had recognised the professional touch and were
moving smartly to my orders. They thought it was part of the show,
and the obedient cameras clicked at everything that came into
their orbit. My aim was to deploy the troops on too narrow a front
so that they were bound to fan outward, and I had to be quick
about it, for I didn’t know when the hapless movie-merchant might
be retrieved from the battle-field and dispute my authority.</p>

<p>It takes a long time to straighten a thing out, but it does not
take long to tangle it, especially when the thing is so delicate
a machine as disciplined troops. In about eight minutes I had
produced chaos. The flanks spread out, in spite of all the shepherding
of the <em>N.C.O.</em>s, and the fringe engulfed the photographers.
The cameras on their little platforms went down like ninepins.
It was solemn to see the startled face of a photographer, taken
unawares, supplicating the purposeful infantry, before he was
swept off his feet into speechlessness.</p>

<p>It was no place for me to linger in, so I chucked away the megaphone
and got mixed up with the tail of the third wave. I was swept
on and came to anchor in the enemy trenches, where I found, as
I expected, my profane and breathless predecessor, the movie-merchant.
I had nothing to say to him, so I stuck to the trench till it
ended against the slope of the hill.</p>

<p>On that flank, delirious with excitement, stood a knot of boy
scouts. My business was to get to Bradfield as quick as my legs
would take me, and as inconspicuously as the gods would permit.
Unhappily I was far too great an object of interest to that nursery
of heroes. Every boy scout is an amateur detective and hungry
for knowledge. I was followed by several, who plied me with questions,
and were told that I was off to Bradfield to hurry up part of
the cinema outfit. It sounded lame enough, for that cinema outfit
was already past praying for.</p>

<p>We reached the road and against a stone wall stood several bicycles.
I selected one and prepared to mount.</p>

<p>"That’s Mr Emmott’s machine," said one boy sharply. "He told
me to keep an eye on it."</p>

<p>"I must borrow it, sonny," I said. "Mr Emmott’s my very good
friend and won’t object."</p>

<p>From the place where we stood I overlooked the back of the battle-field
and could see an anxious congress of officers. I could see others,
too, whose appearance I did not like. They had not been there
when I operated on the megaphone. They must have come downhill
from the aerodrome and in all likelihood were the pursuers I had
avoided. The exhilaration which I had won in the air and which
had carried me into the tomfoolery of the past half-hour was ebbing.
I had the hunted feeling once more, and grew middle-aged and cautious.
I had a baddish record for the day, what with getting Archie into
a scrape and busting up an official cinema show—neither consistent
with the duties of a brigadier-general. Besides, I had still to
get to London.</p>

<p>I had not gone two hundred yards down the road when a boy scout,
pedalling furiously, came up abreast me.</p>

<p>"Colonel Edgeworth wants to see you," he panted. "You’re to come
back at once."</p>

<p>"Tell him I can’t wait now," I said. "I’ll pay my respects to
him in an hour."</p>

<p>"He said you were to come at once," said the faithful messenger.
"He’s in an awful temper with you, and he’s got bobbies with him."</p>

<p>I put on pace and left the boy behind. I reckoned I had the better
part of two miles’ start and could beat anything except petrol.
But my enemies were bound to have cars, so I had better get off
the road as soon as possible. I coasted down a long hill to a
bridge which spanned a small discoloured stream that flowed in
a wooded glen. There was nobody for the moment on the hill behind
me, so I slipped into the covert, shoved the bicycle under the
bridge, and hid Archie’s aquascutum in a bramble thicket. I was
now in my own disreputable tweeds and I hoped that the shedding
of my most conspicuous garment would puzzle my pursuers if they
should catch up with me.</p>

<p>But this I was determined they should not do. I made good going
down that stream and out into a lane which led from the downs
to the market-gardens round the city. I thanked Heaven I had got
rid of the aquascutum, for the August afternoon was warm and my
pace was not leisurely. When I was in secluded ground I ran, and
when anyone was in sight I walked smartly.</p>

<p>As I went I reflected that Bradfield would see the end of my
adventures. The police knew that I was there and would watch the
stations and hunt me down if I lingered in the place. I knew no
one there and had no chance of getting an effective disguise.
Indeed I very soon began to wonder if I should get even as far
as the streets. For at the moment when I had got a lift on the
back of a fishmonger’s cart and was screened by its flapping canvas,
two figures passed on motor-bicycles, and one of them was the
inquisitive boy scout. The main road from the aerodrome was probably
now being patrolled by motor-cars. It looked as if there would
be a degrading arrest in one of the suburbs.</p>

<p>The fish-cart, helped by half a crown to the driver, took me
past the outlying small-villadom, between long lines of workmen’s
houses, to narrow cobbled lanes and the purlieus of great factories.
As soon as I saw the streets well crowded I got out and walked.
In my old clothes I must have appeared like some second-class
bookie or seedy horse-coper. The only respectable thing I had
about me was my gold watch. I looked at the time and found it
half past five.</p>

<p>I wanted food and was casting about for an eating-house when
I heard the purr of a motor-cycle and across the road saw the
intelligent boy scout. He saw me, too, and put on the brake with
a sharpness which caused him to skid and all but come to grief
under the wheels of a wool-wagon. That gave me time to efface
myself by darting up a side street. I had an unpleasant sense
that I was about to be trapped, for in a place I knew nothing
of I had not a chance to use my wits.</p>

<p>I remember trying feverishly to think, and I suppose that my
preoccupation made me careless. I was now in a veritable slum,
and when I put my hand to my vest pocket I found that my watch
had gone. That put the top stone on my depression. The reaction
from the wild burnout of the forenoon had left me very cold about
the feet. I was getting into the under-world again and there was
no chance of a second Archie Roylance turning up to rescue me.
I remember yet the sour smell of the factories and the mist of
smoke in the evening air. It is a smell I have never met since
without a sort of dulling of spirit.</p>

<p>Presently I came out into a market-place. Whistles were blowing,
and there was a great hurrying of people back from the mills.
The crowd gave me a momentary sense of security, and I was just
about to inquire my way to the railway station when someone jostled
my arm.</p>

<p>A rough-looking fellow in mechanic’s clothes was beside me.</p>

<p>"Mate," he whispered. "I’ve got summat o’ yours here." And to
my amazement he slipped my watch into my hand.</p>

<p>"It was took by mistake. We’re friends o’ yours. You’re right
enough if you do what I tell you. There’s a peeler over there
got his eye on you. Follow me and I’ll get you off."</p>

<p>I didn’t much like the man’s looks, but I had no choice, and
anyhow he had given me back my watch. He sidled into an alley
between tall houses and I sidled after him. Then he took to his
heels, and led me a twisting course through smelly courts into
a tanyard and then by a narrow lane to the back-quarters of a
factory. Twice we doubled back, and once we climbed a wall and
followed the bank of a blue-black stream with a filthy scum on
it. Then we got into a very mean quarter of the town, and emerged
in a dingy garden, strewn with tin cans and broken flowerpots.
By a back door we entered one of the cottages and my guide very
carefully locked it behind him.</p>

<p>He lit the gas and drew the blinds in a small parlour and looked
at me long and quizzically. He spoke now in an educated voice.</p>

<p>"I ask no questions," he said, "but it’s my business to put my
services at your disposal. You carry the passport."</p>

<p>I stared at him, and he pulled out his watch and showed a white-and-purple
cross inside the lid.</p>

<p>"I don’t defend all the people we employ," he said, grinning.
"Men’s morals are not always as good as their patriotism. One
of them pinched your watch, and when he saw what was inside it
he reported to me. We soon picked up your trail, and observed
you were in a bit of trouble. As I say, I ask no questions. What
can we do for you?"</p>

<p>"I want to get to London without any questions asked. They’re
looking for me in my present rig, so I’ve got to change it."</p>

<p>"That’s easy enough," he said. "Make yourself comfortable for
a little and I’ll fix you up. The night train goes at eleven-thirty....
You’ll find cigars in the cupboard and there’s this week’s <em>Critic</em>
on that table. It’s got a good article on Conrad, if you care
for such things."</p>

<p>I helped myself to a cigar and spent a profitable half-hour reading
about the vices of the British Government. Then my host returned
and bade me ascend to his bedroom. "You’re Private Henry Tomkins
of the 12th Gloucesters, and you’ll find your clothes ready for
you. I’ll send on your present togs if you give me an address."</p>

<p>I did as I was bid, and presently emerged in the uniform of a
British private, complete down to the shapeless boots and the
dropsical puttees. Then my friend took me in hand and finished
the transformation. He started on my hair with scissors and arranged
a lock which, when well oiled, curled over my forehead. My hands
were hard and rough and only needed some grubbiness and hacking
about the nails to pass muster. With my cap on the side of my
head, a pack on my back, a service rifle in my hands, and my pockets
bursting with penny picture papers, I was the very model of the
British soldier returning from leave. I had also a packet of Woodbine
cigarettes and a hunch of bread-and-cheese for the journey. And
I had a railway warrant made out in my name for London.</p>

<p>Then my friend gave me supper—bread and cold meat and a bottle
of Bass, which I wolfed savagely, for I had had nothing since
breakfast. He was a curious fellow, as discreet as a tombstone,
very ready to speak about general subjects, but never once coming
near the intimate business which had linked him and me and Heaven
knew how many others by means of a little purple-and-white cross
in a watch-case. I remember we talked about the topics that used
to be popular at Biggleswick—the big political things that begin
with capital letters. He took Amos’s view of the soundness of
the British working-man, but he said something which made me think.
He was convinced that there was a tremendous lot of German spy
work about, and that most of the practitioners were innocent.
"The ordinary Briton doesn’t run to treason, but he’s not very
bright. A clever man in that kind of game can make better use
of a fool than a rogue."</p>

<p>As he saw me off he gave me a piece of advice. "Get out of these
clothes as soon as you reach London. Private Tomkins will frank
you out of Bradfield, but it mightn’t be a healthy <em>alias</em>
in the metropolis."</p>

<p>At eleven-thirty I was safe in the train, talking the jargon
of the returning soldier with half a dozen of my own type in a
smoky third-class carriage. I had been lucky in my escape, for
at the station entrance and on the platform I had noticed several
men with the unmistakable look of plainclothes police. Also—though
this may have been my fancy—I thought I caught in the crowd a
glimpse of the bagman who had called himself Linklater.</p>
