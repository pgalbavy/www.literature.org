THE journey from our town to the metropolis, was a journey of 
about five hours. It was a little past mid-day when the four- 
horse stage-coach by which I was a passenger, got into the ravel of 
traffic frayed out about the Cross Keys, Wood-street, Cheapside, 
London. 

<p>We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was 
treasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of every- 
thing: otherwise, while I was scared by the immensity of London, 
I think I might have had some fuint doubts whether it was not 
rather ugly, crooked, narrow, and dirty. 

<p>Mr Jaggers had duly sent me his address; it was, Little Britain, 
and he had written after it on his card, `just out of Smithfield, and 
close by the coach-office.' Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who 
seemed to have as many capes to his greasy great-coat as he was 
years old, packed me up in his coach and hemmed me in with a 
folding and jingling barrier of steps, as if he were going to take me 
fifty miles. His getting on his box, which I remember to have been 
decorated with an old weather-stained pea-green hammercloth 
moth-eaten into rags, was quite a work of time. It was a wonderful 
equipage, with six great coronets outside, and ragged things behind 
for I don't know how many footmen to hold on by, and a harrow 
below them, to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the 
temptation. 

<p>I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like 
a straw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder 
why the horses' nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the 
coachman beginning to get down, as if we were going to stop 
presently. And stop we presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain 
offices with an open door, whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS. 

<p>`How much?' I asked the coachman. 

<p>The coachman answered, `A shilling -- unless you wish to make 
it more.' 

<p>I naturally said I had no wish to make it more. 

<p>`Then it must be a shilling,' observed the coachman. `I don't 
want to get into trouble. I know <I>him!'</I> He darkly closed an eye at 
Mr Jaggers's name, and shook his head. 

<p>When he had got his shilling, and had in course of time com- 
pleted the ascent to his box, and had got away (which appeared to 
relieve his mind), I went into the front office with my little port- 
manteau in my hand and asked, Was Mr Jaggers at home? 

<p>`He is not,' returned the clerk. `He is in Court at present. Am I 
addressing Mr pip?' 

<p>I signified that he was addressing Mr Pip. 

<p>`Mr Jaggers left word would you wait in his room. He couldn't 
say how long he might be, having a case on. But it stands to reason 
his time being valuable, that he won't be longer than he can help.' 

<p>With those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into 
an inner chamber at the back. Here, we found a gentleman with one 
eye, in a velveteen suit and knee-breeches, who wiped his nose with 
his sleeve on being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper. 

<p>`Go and wait outside, Mike,' said the clerk. 

<p>I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting -- when the 
clerk shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever 
saw used, and tossing his fur cap out after him, left me alone. 

<p>Mr Jaggers's room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a 
most dismal place; the skylight, eccentrically patched like a broken 
head, and the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had 
twisted themselves to peep down at me through it. There were not 
so many papers about, as I should have expected to see; and rhere 
were some odd objects about, that I should not have expected to 
see -- such as an old rusty pistol, a sword in a scabbard, several 
strange-looking boxes and packages, and two dreadful casts on a 
shelf, of faces peculiarly swollen, and twitchy about the nose. Mr 
Jaggers's own high-backed chair was of deadly black horse-hair, 
with rows of brass nails round it, like a coffin; and I fancied I could 
see how he leaned back in it, and bit his forefinger at the clients. 
The room was but small, and the clients seemed to have had a habit 
of backing up against the wall: the wall, especially opposite to Mr 
Jaggers's chair, being greasy with shoulders. I recalled, too, that the 
one-eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was 
the innocent cause of his being turned out. 

<p>I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr Jaggers's 
chair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. 
I called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing some- 
thing to everybody else's disadvantage, as his master had. I won- 
dered how many other clerks there were up-stairs, and whether 
they all claimed to have the same detrimental mastery of their 
fellow-creatures. I wondered what was the history of all the odd 
litter about the room, and how it came there. I wondered whether 
the two swollen faces were of Mr Jaggers's family, and, if he were 
so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such ill-looking relations, 
why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the blacks and flies to 
settle on, instead of giving them a place at home. Of course I had 
no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits may have 
been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and grit 
that lay thick on everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in 
Mr Jaggers's close room, until I really could not bear the two 
casts on the shelf above Mr Jaggers's chair, and got up and 
went out. 

<p>When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I 
waited, he advised me to go round the corner and I should come 
into Smithfield. So, I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, 
being all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to 
stick to me. So, I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning 
into a street where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul's 
bulging at me from behind a grim stone building which a bystander 
said was Newgate Prison. Following the wall of the jail, I found the 
roadway covered with straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles; 
and from this, and from the quantity of people standing about, 
smelling strongly of spirits and beer, I inferred that the trials 
were on. 

<p>While I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially 
drunk minister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and 
hear a trial or so: informing me that he could give me a front place 
for half-a-crown, whence I should command a full view of the Lord 
Chief Justice in his wig and robes -- mentioning that awful per- 
sonage like waxwork, and presently offering him at the reduced 
price of eighteenpence. As I declined the proposal on the plea of an 
appointment, he was so good as to take me into a yard and show 
me where the gallows was kept, and also where people were 
publicly whipped, and then he showed me the Debtors' Door, 
out of which culprits came to be hanged: heightening the interest 
of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that `four on 
'em' would come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight 
in the morning, to be killed in a row. This was horrible, and gave 
me a sickening idea of London: the more so as the Lord Chief 
Justice's proprietor wore (from his hat down to his boots and up 
again to his pocket-handkerchief inclusive) mildewed clothes, 
which had evidently not belonged to him originally, and which, I 
took it into my head, he had bought cheap of the executioner. 
Under these circumstances I thought myself well rid of him for a 
shilling. 

<p>I dropped into the office to ask if Mr Jaggers had come in yet, 
and I found he had not, and I strolled out again. This time, I made 
the tour of Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; 
and now I became aware that other people were waiting about for 
Mr Jaggers, as well as I. There were two men of secret appearance 
lounging in Bartholomew Close, and thoughtfully fitting their feet 
into the cracks of the pavement as they talked together, one of 
whom said to the other when they first passed me, that `Jaggers 
would do it if it was to be done.' There was a knot of three men 
and two women standing at a corner, and one of the women was 
crying on her dirty shawl, and the other comforted her by saying 
as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders, `Jaggers is for 
him, 'Melia, and what more <I>could</I> you have?' There was a red-eyed 
little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering there, in 
company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand; 
and while the messenger was gone, I remarked this Jew, who was 
of a highly excitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety 
under a lamp-post, and accompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy, 
with the words, `Oh Jaggerth, Jaggerth, Jaggerth! all otherth ith 
Cag-Maggerth, give me Jaggerth!' These testimonies to the 
popularity of my guardian made a deep impression on me, and I 
admired and wondered more than ever. 

<p>At length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew 
Close into Little Britain, I saw Mr Jaggers coming across the road 
towards me. All the others who were waiting, saw him at the same 
time, and there was quite a rush at him. Mr Jaggers, putting a hand 
on my shoulder and walking me on at his side without saying 
anything to me, addressed himself to his followers. 

<p>First, he took the two secret men. 

<p>`Now, I have nothing to say to you,' said Mr Jaggers, throwing 
his finger at them. `l want to know no more than I know. As to the 
result, it's a toss-up. I told you from the first it was a toss-up. Have 
you paid Wemmick?' 

<p>`We made the money up this morning, sir,' said one of the men, 
submissively, while the other perused Mr Jaggers's face. 

<p>`I don't ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you 
made it up at all. Has Wemmick got it?' 

<p>`Yes, sir,' said both the men together. 

<p>`Very well; then you may go. Now, I won't have it!' said Mr 
Jaggers, waving his hand at them to put them behind him. `If you 
say a word to me, I'll throw up the case.' 

<p>`We thought, Mr Jaggers --' one of the men began, pulling off 
his hat. 

<p>`That's what I told you not to do,' said Mr Jaggers. `<I>You</I>
thought! I think for you; that's enough for you. If I want you, 
I know where to find you; I don't want you to find me. Now I 
won't have it. I won't hear a word.' 

<p>The two men looked at one another as Mr Jaggers waved them 
behind again, and humbly fell back and were heard no more. 

<p>`And now <I>you!'</I> said Mr Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning 
on the two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had 
meekly separated. -- `Oh! Amelia, is it? ' 

<p>`Yes, Mr Jaggers.' 

<p>`And do you remember,' retorted Mr Jaggers, `that but for me 
you wouldn't be here and couldn't be here?' 

<p>`Oh yes, sir!' exclaimed both women together. `Lord bless you, 
sir, well we knows that!' 

<p>`Then why,' said Mr Jaggers, `do you come here?' 

<p>`My Bill, sir!' the crying woman pleaded. 

<p>`Now, I tell you what!' said Mr Jaggers. `Once for all. If you 
don't know that your Bill's in good hands, I know it. And if you 
come here, bothering about your Bill, l'll make an example of 
both your Bill and you, and let him slip through my fingers. Have 
you paid Wemmick?' 

<p>`Oh yes, sir! Every farden.' 

<p>`Very well. Then you have done all you have got to do. Say 
another word -- one single word -- and Wemmick shall give you 
your money back. 

<p>This terrible threat caused the two women to fall off im- 
mediately. No one remained now but the excitable Jew, who had 
already raised the skirts of Mr Jaggers's coat to his lips several 
times. 

<p>`I don't know this man!' said Mr Jaggers, in the same devastating 
strain: `What does this fellow want?' 

<p>`Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth.  Hown brother to Habraham 
Latharuth ? ' 

<p>`Who's he?' said Mr Jaggers. `Let go of my coat.' 

<p>The suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relin- 
quishing it, replied, `Habraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of 
plate.' 

<p>`You're too late,' said Mr Jaggers. `I am over the way.' 

<p>`Holy father, Mithter Jaggerth! ' cried my excitable acquaintance, 
turning white, `don't thay you're again Habraham Latharuth!' 

<p>`I am,' said Mr Jaggers, `and there's an end of it. Get out of the 
way. 

<p>`Mithter Jaggerth! Half a moment! My hown cuthen'th gone to 
Mithter Wemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany 
termth. Mithter Jaggerth! Half a quarter of a moment! If you'd 
have the condethenthun to be bought off from the t'other thide -- 
at hany thuperior prithe! -- money no object! -- Mithter Jaggerth -- 
Mithter --!' 

<p>My guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference, 
and left him dancing on the pavement as if it were red-hot. Without 
further interruption, we reached the front office, where we found 
the clerk and the man in velveteen with the fur cap. 

<p>`Here's Mike,' said the clerk, getting down from his stool, and 
approaching Mr Jaggers confidentially. 

<p>`Oh!' said Mr Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a 
lock of hair in the middle of his forehead, like the Bull in Cock 
Robin pulling at the bell-rope; `your man comes on this after- 
noon. Well? ' 

<p>`Well, Mas'r Jaggers,' returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer 
from a constitutional cold; `arter a deal o' trouble, I've found one, 
sir, as might do.' 

<p>`What is he prepared to swear?'                        -- 

<p>`Well, Mas'r Jaggers,' said Mike, wiping his nose on his fur cap 
this time; `in a general way, anythink.' 

<p>Mr Jaggers suddenly became most irate. `Now, I warned you 
before,' said he, throwing his forefinger at the terrified client, 
`that if you ever presumed to talk in that way here, l'd make an 
example of you. You infernal scoundrel, how dare you tell ME 
that? ' 

<p>The client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if he were 
unconscious what he had done. 

<p>`Spooney!' said the clerk, in a low voice, giving him a stir with 
his elbow. `Soft Head! Need you say it fuce to face?' 

<p>`Now, I ask you, you blundering booby,' said my guardian, 
very sternly, `once more and for the last time, what the man you 
have brought here is prepared to swear?' 

<p>Mike looked hard at my guardian, as if he were trying to learn a 
lesson from his face, and slowly replied, `Ayther to character, or to 
having been in his company and never left him all the night in 
question.' 

<p>`Now, be careful. In what station of life is this man?' 

<p>Mike looked at his cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the 
ceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, before 
beginning to reply in a nervous manner, `We've dressed him up 
like --' when my guardian blustered out: 

<p>`What? You WILL, will you?' 

<p>(`Spooney!' added the clerk again, with another stir.) 

<p>After some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began 
again: 

<p>`He is dressed like a 'spectable pieman. A sort of a pastry-cook.' 

<p>`Is he here?' asked my guardian. 

<p>`I left him,' said Mike, `a settin on some doorsteps round the 
corner.' 

<p>`Take him past that window, and let me see him.' 

<p>The window indicated, was the office window. We all three went 
to it, behind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an 
accidental manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a 
short suit of white linen and a paper cap. This guileless con- 
fectioner was not by any means sober, and had a black eye in the 
green stage of recovery, which was painted over. 

<p>`Tell him to take his witness away directly,' said my guardian 
to the clerk, in extreme disgust, `and ask him what he means by 
bringing such a fellow as that.' 

<p>My guardian then took me into his own room, and while he 
lunched, standing, from a sandwich-box and a pocket flask of sherry 
(he seemed to bully his very sandwich as he ate it), informed me 
what arrangements he had made for me. I was to go to `Barnard's 
Inn,' to young Mr Pocket's rooms, where a bed had been sent 
in for my accommodation; I was to remain with young Mr Pocket 
until Monday; on Monday I was to go with him to his father's 
house on a visit, that I might try how I liked it. Also, I was told 
what my allowance was to be -- it was a very liberal one -- and had 
handed to me from one of my guardian's drawers, the cards of 
certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes, 
and such other things as I could in reason want. `You will find 
your credit good, Mr Pip,' said my guardian, whose flask of sherry 
smelt like a whole cask-full, as he hastily refreshed himself, `but I 
shall by this means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up 
if I find you outrunning the constable. Of course you'll go wrong 
somehow, but that's no fault of mine.' 

<p>After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I 
asked Mr Jaggers if I could send for a coach? He said it was not 
worth while, I was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk 
round with me, if I pleased. 

<p>I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room. 
Another clerk was rung down from up-stairs to take his place 
while he was out, and I accompanied him into the street, after 
shaking hands with my guardian. We found a new set of people 
lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way among them by 
saying coolly yet decisively, `I tell you it's no use; he won't have a 
word to say to one of you;' and we soon got clear of them, and 
went on side by side.
