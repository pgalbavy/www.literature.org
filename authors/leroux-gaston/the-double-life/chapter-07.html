<p><em>FOR </em>the next few days M. Lecamus and M.</p>

<p>Longuet occupied themselves with evidence of this phenomenon,
and were often seen together, conversing mysteriously, in the
bar-rooms and about town, about the treason of the first of April.
They left the Villa Flots d’Azure to return to Paris, with the
intention of searching the libraries. They worked diligently for
several days without any result, until M. Longuet began to lose
spirit. M. Lecamus was more patient.</p>

<p>One evening as they were walking towards the Rond Point, in the
Champs Elysees, he turned around and said, "What can we do to
find the approximate place where the treasures are buried if you
have not your black plume?" Théophraste and Marceline could not
understand this, and asked for an explanation. He commented:</p>

<p>"You have heard of the water witches who could discover water
by the aid of a wand, by a phenomenon which nobody has as yet
been able to explain. These witches traced water across the various
beds of earth, and by pointing the little rods, indicated where
it was necessary to dig in order to make a well. I do not despair
of showing you, Théophraste, where your treasures are buried.
I will conduct you over the ground shown in the document, and
tell you where it is that you must dig to find your treasure."</p>

<p>"Yes," interrupted Théophraste, "but this does not explain to
us what you mean by ‘the black plume.’"</p>

<p>"I am coming to that now. I am obliged to speak of Darwin. You
will understand directly. You know that Darwin devoted himself
to several celebrated experiments, of which the best known is
that with pigeons.</p>

<p>"Desirous of accounting for the phenomenon of heredity and the
value that he attached to it, he closely studied the breeding
of pigeons, which is sufficiently rapid to have enabled him to
draw conclusions upon an appreciable number of generations. At
the end of the tenth generation he found the same type of pigeon,
with the same defects, the same qualities, the same form, the
same outline, and the same black plume there in the same place
where the first pigeon had a black feather. Very well! With that
I will prove to you that it is the same with souls as it is with
bodies.</p>

<p>"At the end of the tenth generation, we find the same soul, as
far as it exists, with the same defects, the same virtues, and,
as it were, with the original black feather. While giving you
this illustration, it is necessary to distinguish between the
soul which reappears thus hereditarily, and that which comes back
by reincarnation. Believing that it is the result of a unique
combination which nothing can oppose, and, since it dwells in
a case called a body, is hereditary in the same degree as that
body, an hereditary soul which comes from an ancestor always has
his black feather, while a soul which comes back by reincarnation
finds itself in a body which is in no way prepared to receive
it. The aggregate materials of this body are original, and decaying,
momentarily impose a silence on that soul.</p>

<p>"But a time comes when this soul becomes the strongest, when
it speaks, when it shows itself entirely, just as the black feather
does.</p>

<p>"Now, Théophraste, for several generations you were the honest
gardeners in the Ferte-sous-Jonarre. But when that soul speaks
in you, you are no longer yourself. Théophraste Longuet has disappeared.
It is the Other who is there. It is the Other who has the gesture,
the manner, the action, the black feather. It is the other who
recalls the mystery of the treasure, it is the Other who remembers
the Other."</p>

<p>"Oh! This is admirable!" exclaimed Théophraste, who was so deeply
moved that he could hardly refrain from weeping with excitement.
"And now I understand what you mean by my black feather. My black
feather returns to me when I am the Other."</p>

<p>"And he will help you then, my friend," declared Adolphe with
conviction. "But until we have released the unknown who is hidden
in Théophraste Longuet, and until he lives with sufficient strength,
audacity, and liberty, until he is resuscitated, in a word, until
he appears to us with his ‘black feather,’ we will confine ourselves
to the study of that interesting document which you brought from
the Conciergerie. Let us make a plan for penetrating the mystery.
We will find out exactly where the treasures are buried, but we
must wait for the spirit who dwells in you to say to us, ‘It is
there.’"</p>

<p>"My friend," said Marceline, overflowing with admiration, "you
talk like a book, and I wonder that you have not more often tried
to teach us these things, for we are so ignorant. You must not
leave a stone unturned to find the treasure. I do not fear the
destruction of the earth on account of the object of our search."</p>

<p>Adolphe turned around to reprove Marceline for her flippancy,
but at this moment M. Milfroid, the Commissioner of Police, approached,
and Adolphe rose to greet his friend.</p>

<p>Adolphe introduced M. Milfroid to M. and Mme. Longuet. He was
a man of about forty years of age, elegantly dressed, immaculate
gloves, a silvery ringlet of hair on the white forehead. He advanced,
smiling and bowing.</p>

<p>"We have often heard our friend M. Adolphe speak of you," said
Marceline. "Your fame has gone before you."</p>

<p>"Oh, madame, I have known you for a long time. Every time I meet
M. Lecamus he speaks to me of his friends of the Rue Gerauds,
and in such terms that it has been my greatest desire to have
the happiness of being presented to you."</p>

<p>Marceline was conquered by such gallant manners. "I hear that
you play the violin very well," she said.</p>

<p>"I am equally interested in philosophy," said M. Milfroid. "An
interest which I owe to M. Adolphe, who is continually in dispute
with me over the immortality of the soul, and other psychic matters.
He has really made a convert of me."</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said Théophraste, who had not yet taken part in the
conversation, "Adolphe and I like to converse about serious matters,
also. We were just speaking of the relations between the soul
and the body, and the different ways that the soul has of behaving
with the body."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said M. Milfroid, who desired to shine before Marceline,
"are you able to distinguish between matter and mind, or the material
and the spiritual? Matter and mind are the same thing in the eyes
of science. That is to say, they constitute alike one unit, one
force, produce at one time the phenomenon of cause and effect,
tending to one end, the progressive steps of existence. You are
the only ones, gentlemen, to still make that old distinction between
matter and mind."</p>

<p>After a while they rose and returned through the Place de la
Concorde. At the entrance to the Rue Royale, there was a crowd
of people, shouting and gesticulating. Théophraste, an old Parisian,
wanted to know what was taking place, and flung himself into the
crowd.</p>

<p>"Look out for pickpockets," Marceline called to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, madame," said Monsieur Milfroid, the Commissioner of Police,
"there are no pickpockets when I am about."</p>

<p>"It is true. We should be in no danger when you are here."</p>

<p>"I do not know about that," said Adolphe, looking about them.
"My friend here appears more dangerous to me than all the pickpockets
on earth." At this they all laughed.</p>

<p>Théophraste made them wait ten minutes before he appeared, and
then he announced that it was a coachman who had gotten his wheels
locked with an automobile, and could not separate them.</p>

<p>Marceline felt annoyed at having been kept waiting so long on
such a slight pretext. However, her thoughts were diverted in
doing the honors of a hostess, and she invited M. Milfroid to
dinner.</p>

<p>During the dinner many pleasantries were passed, and M. Milfroid
excelled in complimenting Marceline.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he became uneasy, and plunging his hands in his pockets,
looked vainly for his handkerchief. After a final and useless
search, he passed his forefinger under his moustache, and sighed,
declaring that it did not matter.</p>

<p>However, at that moment Théophraste wiped his mouth, and Marceline
asked him where he had found such a beautiful handkerchief. M.
Mil-froid at once recognized it as his own, and thinking it just
a piece of pleasantry, took the handkerchief from Théophraste.
However, feeling in his left side, he became pale and exclaimed,
"Good God! I have lost my pocketbook. There were five hundred
francs in it." M. Milfroid did not regret losing the five hundred
francs, but he found himself ridiculed by Adolphe, and Marceline
teased him gently and laughed prettily. They were all poking fun
at him, and this made him furious.</p>

<p>"M. Milfroid," said Théophraste, "if you need any money for the
evening I can lend it to you," and he drew a wallet from his pocket.
M. Milfroid uttered a cry: it was his! M. Milfroid took the wallet
from him as he had done the handkerchief, and alleging numerous
engagements, he took his leave. Before going down the stairs,
he said to his friend Adolphe, who followed him, "These are nice
kind of people you have introduced me to."</p>

<p>When Adolphe returned to the dining-room, Théophraste was emptying
his pockets. On the table there lay three watches, six handkerchiefs,
several pocketbooks, containing large sums of money, and eighteen
checks.</p>
