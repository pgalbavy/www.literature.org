<P>
So this was the man!  Mr. Sabin did not neglect his luncheon, nor
was he ever for a moment unmindful of the grey-headed princess who
chatted away by his side with all the vivacity of her race and sex.
But he watched Mr. Brott.
<P>
A man this!  Mr. Sabin was a judge, and he appraised him rightly.
He saw through that courteous geniality of tone and gesture; the
ready-made smile, although it seemed natural enough, did not
deceive him.  Underneath was a man of iron, square-jawed, nervous,
forceful.  Mr. Brott was probably at that time the ablest
politician of either party in the country.  Mr. Sabin knew it.
He found himself wondering exactly at what point of their lives
this man and he would come into contact.
<P>
After luncheon Helene brought them together.
<P>
"I believe," she said to Mr. Brott, "that you have never met my
UNCLE.  May I make you formally acquainted?  UNCLE, this is Mr.
Brott, whom you must know a great deal about even though you have
been away for so long - the Duc 
de Souspennier."
<P>
The two men bowed and Helene passed on.  Mr. Sabin leaned upon his
stick and watched keenly for any sign in the other's face.  If he
expected to find it he was disappointed.  Either this man had no
knowledge of who he was, or those things which were to come between
them were as yet unborn.
<P>
They strolled together after the other guests into the winter
gardens, which were the envy of every hostess in London.  Mr. Sabin
lit a cigarette, Mr. Brott regretfully declined.  He neither smoked
nor drank wine.  Yet he was disposed to be friendly, and selected
a seat where they were a little apart from the other guests.
<P>
"You at least," he remarked, in answer to an observation of Mr.
Sabin's, "are free from the tyranny of politics.  I am assuming, of
course, that your country under its present form of government has
lost its hold upon you."
<P>
Mr. Sabin smiled.
<P>
"It is a doubtful boon," he said.  "It is true that I am practically
an exile.  Republican France has no need of me.  Had I been a
soldier I could still have remained a patriot.  But for one whose
leanings were towards politics, neither my father before me nor I
could be of service to our country.  You should be thankful," he
continued with a slight smile, "that you are an Englishman.  No
constitution in the world can offer so much to the politician who
is strong enough and fearless enough."
<P>
Mr. Brott glanced towards his twinkling eyes.
<P>
"Do you happen to know what my politics are?" he asked.
<P>
Mr. Sabin hesitated.
<P>
"Your views, I know, are advanced," he said.  "For the rest I have
been abroad for years.  I have lost touch a little with affairs in
this country."
<P>
"I am afraid," Mr. Brott said, "that I shall shock you.  You are
an aristocrat of the aristocrats, I a democrat of the democrats.
The people are the only masters whom I own.  They first sent me to
Parliament."
<P>
"Yet," Mr. Sabin remarked, "you are, I understand, in the Cabinet."
<P>
Mr. Brott glanced for a moment around.  The Prime Minister was
somewhere in the winter gardens.
<P>
"That," he declared, "is an accident.  I happened to be the only
man available who could do the work when Lord Kilbrooke died.  I
am telling you only what is an open secret.  But I am afraid I am
boring you.  Shall we join the others?"
<P>
"Not unless you yourself are anxious to," Mr. Sabin begged.  "It
is scarcely fair to detain you talking to an old man when there
are so many charming women here.  But I should be sorry for you
to think me hidebound in my prejudices.  You must remember that
the Revolution decimated my family.  It was a long time ago, but
the horror of it is still a live thing."
<P>
"Yet it was the natural outcome," Mr. Brott said, "of the things
which went before.  Such hideous misgovernment as generations of
your countrymen had suffered was logically bound to bring its own
reprisal."
<P>
"There is truth in what you say," Mr. Sabin admitted.  He did not
want to talk about the French Revolution.
<P>
"You are a stranger in London, are you not?" Mr. Brott asked.
<P>
"I feel myself one," Mr. Sabin answered.  "I have been away for a
few years, and I do not think that there is a city in the world
where social changes are so rapid.  I should perhaps except the
cities of the country from which I have come.  But then America
is a universe of itself."
<P>
For an instant Mr. Brott gave signs of the man underneath.  The air
of polite interest had left his face.  He glanced swiftly and keenly
at his companion.  Mr. Sabin's expression was immutable.  It was
he who scored, for he marked the change, whilst Mr. Brott could not
be sure whether he had noticed it or not.
<P>
"You have been living in America, then?"
<P>
"For several years - yes."
<P>
"It is a country," Mr. Brott said, "which I am particularly anxious
to visit.  I see my chances, however, grow fewer and fewer as the
years go by."
<P>
"For one like yourself," Mr. Sabin said, "whose instincts and
sympathies are wholly with the democracy, a few months in America
would be very well spent."
<P>
"And you," Mr. Brott remarked, "how did you get on with the people?"
<P>
Mr. Sabin traced a pattern with his stick upon the marble floor.
<P>
"I lived in the country," he said, "I played golf and read and
rested."
<P>
"Were you anywhere near New York?" Mr. Brott asked.
<P>
"A few hours' journey only," Mr. Sabin answered.  "My home was in
a very picturesque part, near Lenox."
<P>
Mr. Brott leaned a little forward.
<P>
"You perhaps know then a lady who spent some time in that
neighbourhood - a Mrs. James Peterson.  Her husband was, I believe,
the American consul in Vienna.
<P>
Mr. Sabin smiled very faintly.  His face betrayed no more than a
natural and polite interest.  There was nothing to indicate the
fact that his heart was beating like the heart of a young man, that
the blood was rushing hot through his veins.
<P>
"Yes," he said, "I know her very well.  Is she in London?"
<P>
Mr. Brott hesitated.  He seemed a little uncertain how to continue.
<P>
"To tell you the truth," he said, "I believe that she has reasons
for desiring her present whereabouts to remain unknown.  I should
perhaps not have mentioned her name at all.  It was, I fancy,
indiscreet of me.  The coincidence of hearing you mention the name
of the place where I believe she resided surprised my question.
With your permission we will abandon the subject."
<P>
"You disappoint me," Mr. Sabin said quietly.  "It would have given
me much pleasure to have resumed my acquaintance with the lady in
question."
<P>
"You will, without doubt, have an opportunity," Mr. Brott said,
glancing at his watch and suddenly rising.  "Dear me, how the time
goes."
<P>
He rose to his feet.  Mr. Sabin also rose.
<P>
"Must I understand," he said in a low tone, "that you are not at
liberty to give me Mrs. Peterson's address?"
<P>
"I am not at liberty even," Mr. Brott answered, with a frown, "to
mention her name.  It will give me great pleasure, Duke, to better
my acquaintance with you.  Will you dine with me at the House of
Commons one night next week?"
<P>
"I shall be charmed," Mr. Sabin answered.  "My address for the next
few days is at the Carlton.  I am staying there under my family
name of Sabin - Mr. Sabin.  It is a fancy of mine - it has been ever
since I became an alien - to use my title as little as possible."
<P>
Mr. Brott looked for a moment puzzled.
<P>
"Your pseudonym," he remarked thoughtfully, "seems very familiar
to me."
<P>
Mr. Sabin shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
"It is a family name," he remarked, "but I flattered myself that it
was at least uncommon."
<P>
"Fancy, no doubt," Mr. Brott remarked, turning to make his adieux
to his hostess.
<P>
Mr. Sabin joined a fresh group of idlers under the palms.  Mr.
Brott lingered over his farewells.
<P>
"Your UNCLE, Lady Camperdown," he said, "is delightful.  I enjoy
meeting new types, and he represents to me most perfectly the old
order of French aristocracy."
<P>
"I am glad," Helene said, "that you found him interesting.  I felt
sure you would.  In fact, I asked him especially to meet you."
<P>
"You are the most thoughtful of hostesses," he assured her.  "By
the bye, your UNCLE has just told me the name by which he is known
at the hotel.  Mr. Sabin!  Sabin!  It recalls something to my mind.
I cannot exactly remember what."
<P>
She smiled upon him.  People generally forgot things when Helene
smiled.
<P>
"It is an odd fancy of his to like his title so little," she
remarked.  "At heart no one is prouder of their family and
antecedents.  I have heard him say, though, that an exile had
better leave behind him even his name."
<P>
"Sabin!" Mr. Brott repeated.  "Sabin!"
<P>
"It is an old family name," she murmured.
<P>
His face suddenly cleared.  She knew that he had remembered.  But
he took his leave with no further reference to it.
<P>
"Sabin!" he repeated to himself when alone in his carriage.  "That
was the name of the man who was supposed to be selling plans to the
German Government.  Poor Renshaw was in a terrible stew about it.
Sabin!  An uncommon name."
<P>
He had ordered the coachman to drive to the House of Commons.
Suddenly he pulled the check-string.
<P>
"Call at Dorset House," he directed.
<P>
      *          *            *          *            *
    
Mr. Sabin lingered till nearly the last of the guests had gone.
Then he led Helene once more into the winter gardens.
<P>
"May I detain you for one moment's gossip?" he asked.  "I see your
carriage at the door."
<P>
She laughed.
<P>
"It is nothing," she declared.  "I must drive in the Park for an
hour.  One sees one's friends, and it is cool and refreshing after
these heated rooms.  But at any time.  Talk to me as long as you
will, and then I will drop you at the Carlton."
<P>
"It is of Brott!" he remarked.  "Ah, I thank you, I will smoke.
Your husband's taste in cigarettes is excellent."
<P>
"Perhaps mine!" she laughed.
<P>
Mr. Sabin shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
"In either case I congratulate you.  This man Brott.  He interests
me."
<P>
"He interests every one.  Why not?  He is a great personality."
<P>
"Politically," Mr. Sabin said, "the gauge of his success is of
course the measure of the man.  But he himself - what manner of a
man is he?"
<P>
She tapped with her fingers upon the little table by their side.
<P>
"He is rich," she said, "and an uncommon mixture of the student
and the man of society.  He refuses many more invitations than he
accepts, he entertains very seldom but very magnificently.  He has
never been known to pay marked attentions to any woman, even the
scandal of the clubs has passed him by.  What else can I say about
him, I wonder?" she continued reflectively.  "Nothing, I think,
except this.  He is a strong man.  You know that that counts for
much."
<P>
Mr. Sabin was silent.  Perhaps he was measuring his strength in some
imagined encounter with this man.  Something in his face alarmed
Helene.  She suddenly leaned forward and looked at him more closely.
<P>
"UNCLE," she exclaimed in a low voice, "there is something on your
mind.  Do not tell me that once more you are in the maze, that
again you have schemes against this country."
<P>
He smiled at her sadly enough, but she was reassured.
<P>
"You need have no fear," he told her.  "With politics - I have
finished.  Why I am here, what I am here for I will tell you very
soon.  It is to find one whom I have lost - and who is dear to me.
Forgive me if for to-day I say no more.  Come, if you will you shall
drive me to my hotel."
<P>
He offered his arm with the courtly grace which he knew so well how
to assume.  Together they passed out to her carriage.
