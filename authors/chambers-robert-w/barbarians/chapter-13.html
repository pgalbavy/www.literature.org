<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Lying far to the southwest of the battle line, only when a strong
northwest wind blew could Sainte Lesse hear the thudding of cannon
beyond the horizon. And once, when the northeast wind had blown
steadily for a week, on the wings of the driving drizzle had come
a faint but dreadful odour which hung among the streets and lanes
until the wind changed.</p>

<p>Except for the carillon, nothing louder than the call of a cuckoo,
the lowing of cattle or a goatherd’s piping ever broke the summer
silence in the little town. Birds sang; a shallow river rippled;
breezes ruffled green grain into long, silvery waves across the
valley; sunshine fell on quiet streets, on scented gardens unsoiled
by war, on groves and meadows, and on the stone-edged brink of
brimming pools where washerwomen knelt among the wild flowers,
splashing amid floating pyramids of snowy suds.</p>

<p>And into the exquisite peace of this little paradise rode John
Burley with a thousand American mules.</p>

<p>The town had been warned of this impending visitation; had watched
preparations for it during April and May when a corral was erected
down in a meadow and some huts and stables were put up among the
groves of poplar and sycamore, and a small barracks was built
to accommodate the negro guardians of the mules and a peloton
of gendarmes under a fat brigadier.</p>

<p>Sainte Lesse as yet knew nothing personally of the American mule
or of Burley. Sainte Lesse heard both before it beheld either
&mdash;Burley’s loud, careless, swaggering voice above the hee-haw
of his trampling herds:</p>

<p>"All I ask for is human food, Smith&mdash;not luxuries&mdash;just food!&mdash;and
that of the commonest kind."</p>

<p>And now an immense volume of noise and dust enveloped the main
street of Sainte Lesse, stilling the quiet noon gossip of the
town, silencing the birds, awing the town dogs so that their impending
barking died to amazed gurgles drowned in the din of the mules.</p>

<p>Astride a cream-coloured, wall-eyed mule, erect in his saddle,
talkative, gesticulating, good-humoured, famished but gay, rode
Burley at the head of the column, his reckless grey eyes glancing
amiably right and left at the good people of Sainte Lesse who
clustered silently at their doorways under the trees to observe
the passing of this noisy, unfamiliar procession.</p>

<p>Mules, dust; mules, dust, and then more mules, all enveloped
in dust, clattering, ambling, trotting, bucking, shying, kicking,
halting, backing; and here and there an American negro cracking
a long snake whip with strange, aboriginal ejaculations; and three
white men in khaki riding beside the trampling column, smoking
cigarettes.</p>

<p>"Sticky" Smith and "Kid" Glenn rode mules on the column’s flank;
Burley continued to lead on his wall-eyed animal, preceded now
by the fat brigadier of the gendarmerie, upon whom he had bestowed
a cigarette.</p>

<p>Burley, talking all the while from his saddle to whoever cared
to listen, or to himself if nobody cared to listen, rode on in
the van under the ancient bell-tower of Sainte Lesse, where a
slim, dark-eyed girl looked up at him as he passed, a faint smile
hovering on her lips.</p>

<p>"Bong jour, Mademoiselle," continued Burley, saluting her <em>en
passant</em> with two fingers at the vizor of his khaki cap, as
he had seen British officers salute. "I compliment you on your
silent but eloquent welcome to me, my comrades, my coons, and
my mules. Your charming though slightly melancholy smile bids
us indeed welcome to your fair city. I thank you; I thank all
the inhabitants for this unprecedented ovation. Doubtless a municipal
banquet awaits us&#11834;"</p>

<p>Sticky Smith spurred up.</p>

<p>"Did you see the inn?" he asked. "There it is, to the right."</p>

<p>"It looks good to me," said Burley. "Everything looks good to
me except these accursed mules. Thank God, that seems to be the
corral&mdash;down in the meadow there, Brigadeer!"</p>

<p>The fat brigadier drew bridle; Burley burst into French:</p>

<p>"Esker&mdash;esker&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Oui</em>," nodded the brigadier, "that is where we are going."</p>

<p>"Bong!" exclaimed Burley with satisfaction; and, turning to Sticky
Smith: "Stick, tell the coons to hustle. We’re there!"</p>

<p>Then, above the trampling, whip-cracking, and shouting of the
negroes, from somewhere high in the blue sky overhead, out of
limpid, cloudless heights floated a single bell-note, then another,
another, others exquisitely sweet and clear, melting into a fragment
of heavenly melody.</p>

<p>Burley looked up into the sky; the negroes raised their sweating,
dark faces in pleased astonishment; Stick and Kid Glenn lifted
puzzled visages to the zenith. The fat brigadier smiled and waved
his cigarette:</p>

<p>"<em>Il est midi, messieurs.</em> That is the carillon of Sainte
Lesse."</p>

<p>The angelic melody died away. Then, high in the old bell-tower,
a great resonant bell struck twelve times.</p>

<p>Said the brigadier:</p>

<p>"When the wind is right, they can hear our big bell, Bayard,
out there in the first line trenches&#11834;"</p>

<p>Again he waved his cigarette toward the northeast, then reined
in his horse and backed off into the flowering meadow, while the
first of the American mules entered the corral, the herd following
pellmell.</p>

<p>The American negroes went with the mules to a hut prepared for
them inside the corral&mdash;it having been previously and carefully
explained to France that an American mule without its negro complement
was as galvanic and unaccountable as a beheaded chicken.</p>

<p>Burley burst into French again, like a shrapnel shell:</p>

<p>"Esker&mdash;esker&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Oui</em>," said the fat brigadier, "there is an excellent
inn up the street, messieurs." And he saluted their uniform, the
same being constructed of cotton khaki, with a horseshoe on the
arm and an oxidized metal mule on the collar. The brigadier wondered
at and admired the minute nicety of administrative detail characterizing
a government which clothed even its muleteers so becomingly, yet
with such modesty and dignity.</p>

<p>He could not know that the uniform was unauthorized and the insignia
an invention of Sticky Smith, aiming to counteract any social
stigma that might blight his sojourn in France.</p>

<p>"For," said Sticky Smith, before they went aboard the transport
at New Orleans, "if you dress a man in khaki, with some gimcrack
on his sleeve and collar, you’re level with anybody in Europe.
Which," he added to Burley, "will make it pleasant if any emperors
or kings drop in on us for a drink or a quiet game behind the
lines."</p>

<p>"Also," added Burley, "it goes with the ladies." And he and Kid
Glenn purchased uniforms similar to Smith’s and had the horseshoe
and mule fastened to sleeve and collar.</p>

<p>"They’ll hang you fellows for francs-tireurs," remarked a battered
soldier of fortune from the wharf as the transport cast off and
glided gradually away from the sun-blistered docks.</p>

<p>"Hang <em>who</em>?" demanded Burley loudly from the rail above.</p>

<p>"What’s a frank-tiroor?" inquired Sticky Smith.</p>

<p>"And who’ll hang us?" shouted Kid Glenn from the deck of the
moving steamer.</p>

<p>"The Germans will if they catch you in that uniform," retorted
the battered soldier of fortune derisively. "You chorus-boy mule
drivers will wish you wore overalls and one suspender if the Dutch
Kaiser nails you!"</p>
