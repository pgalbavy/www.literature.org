<p>Astonished by the cry, young Clarendon turned his head and looked
at his sister, who landed at his side that moment like a fairy.
She was holding a sheet of paper in her hand. It was folded in
the form of an envelope, and pencilled on the outside in bold
letters were the words&mdash;</p>

"Melville Clarendon.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In haste; read instantly."

</p>

<p>He took the letter from his sister and trembled, as if from a
chill, as he hurriedly unfolded the paper and read&mdash;</p>

"MY <em>DEAR MEL,<br/>
&</em>mdash;Leave at once! The Sioux have taken the war-path,<br/>
and a party of their worst warriors from the Muddy Creek country<br/>
have started out on a raid. They are sure to come this way, and<br/>
I suppose the house will be burned, and everything on which they<br/>
can lay hands destroyed. They are under the lead of the<br/>
desperate Red Feather, and will spare nothing. A friendly Sioux<br/>
stopped this morning before daylight and warned me. I gathered<br/>
the animals together, and your mother and I set out for Barwell<br/>
in all haste, driving the beasts before us.

</p>
<p>
"I feel certain of either finding you and Dot at my brother's in<br/>
the settlement or of meeting you on the way, for I suppose, of<br/>
course, you will follow the regular trail; but, at the moment of<br/>
starting, your mother suggests the possibility that you may take<br/>
the upper route. To make sure, I write this letter. If the<br/>
Indians reach the building before you, they will leave such<br/>
traces of their presence that you will take the alarm. If you<br/>
arrive first and see this note, re-mount Saladin, turn<br/>
northward, and lose not a minute in galloping to the settlement.<br/>
None of them can overtake you. Avoid the upper trail, where it<br/>
is much easier for them to ambush you; keep as much on the open<br/>
prairie as possible; see that your weapons are loaded; make<br/>
Saladin do his best; and God be with you and Darling Dot.&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Father."

</p>

<p>[Illustration: "He hurriedly unfolded the paper and read."]</p>

<p>The youth read this important message aloud to Dot, who stood
at his side, looking wistfully up in his face. She was too young
to comprehend fully its meaning, but she knew that her parents
had left for the settlement, and that her father had ordered Melville
to follow at once with her.</p>

<p>"The bad Indians are coming," he added, "and if we stay here
they will shoot us. I don't think," he said, glancing around,
"that they are anywhere near; but they are likely to come any
minute, so we won't wait."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mel!" suddenly spoke up Dot, "you know I forgot to take
Susie with me when I went away; can't I get her now?"</p>

<p>Susie was Dot's pet doll, and the fact that she left it behind
when making her visit to Uncle Jack's had a great deal more to
do with her home-sickness than her friends suspected. The thought
of leaving it behind again almost broke her heart.</p>

<p>"I am sure mother took it with her when she went off this morning,"
replied Melville, feeling a little uneasy over the request.</p>

<p>"I'll soon find out," said she, stepping hastily towards the
door.</p>

<p>He could not refuse her wish, for he understood the depth of
the affection she felt for the doll, whose dress was somewhat
torn, and whose face was not always as clean as her own. Besides,
it could take only a minute or two to get the plaything, if it
had been left in the house. Although his situation prevented his
seeing anything in the rear of the building, he was sure the dreaded
Indians were not yet in sight, and he desired to make a hasty
survey of the interior of the house himself.</p>

<p>How familiar everything looked! There were the chairs placed
against the wall, and the deal table in the middle of the room.
Melville noticed that the pictures which had hung so long on the
walls had been taken away. They were portraits of the members
of the family, and the mother looked upon them as too precious
to be allowed to run any risk of loss. A few other valuables,
including the old Bible, had been removed; but the parents were
too wise to increase their own danger by loading themselves with
goods, however much they regretted leaving them behind.</p>

<p>Although there was an old-fashioned fire-place, the Clarendons
used a large stove standing near it. Curiosity led Melville to
examine it, and he smiled to find it still warm. The ashes within,
when stirred, showed some embers glowing beneath. There was something
in the fact which made the youth feel as though the distance between
him and his parents had become less than a short time before.</p>

<p>"Strange that I took the upper trail," he said to himself, resuming
his standing position, "and thereby missed them. It's the first
time I have been over that course for a long while, and it beats
me that to-day when I shouldn't have done so I must do it; but
fortunately no harm was done."</p>

<p>It struck him that Dot was taking an unusually long time in the
search for her doll. Walking to the foot of the stairs, he called
to her&mdash;</p>

<p>"It won't do to wait any longer, Dot; we must be off. If you
can't find your doll, it's because mother took it with her."</p>

<p>"I've found it! I've found it!" she exclaimed, dancing with delight;
"I had hid it in the bed, where mother didn't see it; bless your
soul, Susie!"</p>

<p>And Melville laughed as he heard a number of vigorous smacks
which told how much the child loved her pet.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are happy now," remarked Melville, taking her
hand, while he held his gun in the other, as they walked towards
the door.</p>

<p>"Indeed I am," she replied, with that emphatic shake of the head
by which children of her years often give force to their words.</p>

<p>Melville placed his hand on the latch of the door, and, raising
it, drew the structure inward. He had lowered his arm and once
more taken the hand of his sister, and was in the act of stepping
outside, when the sharp report of a rifle broke the stillness,
and he felt the whiz of the bullet, which grazed his face and
buried itself in the wall behind him.</p>

<p>The lad was quick-witted enough to know on the instant what it
meant; and, leaping back, he hastily closed the door, drew in
the latch-string, and, leaning his rifle against the side of the
room, slipped the bar in place.</p>

<p>He had hardly done so when there was a shock, as if some heavy
body were flung violently against it. Such was the fact, a Sioux
warrior having turned himself sideways at the moment of leaping,
so that his shoulder struck it with a force sufficient to carry
a door off its hinges.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked the frightened Dot; "why do you fasten
the door, Mel?"</p>

<p>"The bad Indians have come; they are trying to get into the house
so as to hurt us."</p>

<p>"And do they want Susie?" she asked Melville, hugging her doll
very closely to her breast.</p>

<p>"Yes, but we won't let them have her. Keep away from the window!"
he added, catching her arm, and drawing her back from the dangerous
position into which her curiosity was leading her. "Sit down there,"
he said, pointing to one of the chairs which was beyond reach
of any bullet that could be fired through a window; "don't stir
unless I tell you to, or the bad Indians will take you and dolly,
and you will never see father or mother or me again."</p>

<p>This was terrible enough to scare the little one into the most
implicit obedience of her brother. She meekly took her seat, with
Susie still clasped in her arms, willing to do anything to save
the precious one from danger, and content to leave everything
to her brother.</p>

<p>The youth had not time to explain matters more fully to his sister,
nor would it have been wise to do so; she had been told enough
already to distress and render her obedient to his wishes.</p>

<p>Following the startling shock against the door came a voice from
the outside. The words were in broken English, and were uttered
by the Sioux warrior that had made the vain effort to drive the
structure inward.</p>

<p>"Open door&mdash;open door, brudder."</p>

<p>"I will not open the door," called back Melville.</p>

<p>"Open door &mdash;Injin won't hurt pale-face&mdash;come in&mdash;eat wid
him."</p>

<p>"You cannot come in; we want no visitors. Go away, or I will
shoot you!"</p>

<p>This was a brave threat, but it did not do all that the lad hoped.
Whether the assailants knew how weak the force was within the
house the youth could not say. He was not without belief that
they might think there were several armed defenders who would
make an attack or siege on the part of the Sioux too costly for
them to continue it long.</p>

<p>The first purpose of Melville, therefore, was to learn how strong
the force was that had made such a sudden attack. It was too perilous
to attempt to look through one of the four narrow windows lighting
the large room where he stood, and which covered the entire lower
part of the building, and he decided, therefore, to got upstairs.</p>

<p>Before doing so, he made Dot repeat her promise to sit still
where she was. She assured him that he need have no fear whatever,
and he hurriedly made his way to the rooms above.</p>

<p>Advancing to one of the windows at the front, he peered out with
the utmost caution.</p>

<p>The first Indian whom he saw was the very one he dreaded above
all others. He recognized him at the first glance by the cluster
of eagle-feathers stuck in his crown. There were stained of a
crimson red, several of the longer ones drooping behind, so as
to mingle with his coarse black hair which streamed over his shoulders.</p>

<p>This was Red Feather, one of the most desperate Sioux known in
the history of the border. Years before he was a chief noted for
his daring and detestation of the white men. As the country became
partly settled he acquired most of the vices and few of the virtues
of the white race. He was fond of "firewater," was an inveterate
thief, sullen and revengeful, quarrelsome at all times; and, when
under the influence of drink, was feared almost as much by his
own people as by the whites.</p>

<p>Red Feather was mounted on a fine-looking horse, which there
is little doubt had been stolen from some of the settlers in that
part of the country. He had brought him to a stand about a hundred
yards from the building, he and the animal facing the house.</p>

<p>As the Sioux chieftain held this position the lad was struck
by his resemblance to the horseman whom he and Dot noticed at
the time they halted on the other bank of the stream.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Red Feather, one of the most desperate Sioux."
&mdash;Page 20]</p>

<p>This discovery of young Clarendon suggested an explanation of
the sight which so puzzled him and his sister. The chief had descried
them at the same moment, if not before they saw him. Inasmuch
as the occupants of the building were absent, he must have thought
they had gone off together, and he could not have believed that,
if such were the case, any members of the company would return&mdash;the
boy, therefore, had ridden part way back to learn what was to
be fate of the cabin and property left behind. Red Feather had
waved his blanket as a taunt, and then rode off for his warriors,
encamped near by, with the purpose of directing them in an attack
on the house.</p>

<p>It was a most unfortunate oversight that Melville did not make
a survey of the surrounding country before entering his own home,
for had he done so, he would have learned of his peril; but you
will remember that his first purpose was not to enter his house,
and in truth it was Susie, the little doll, that brought all the
trouble.</p>

<p>The dismay caused by his unexpected imprisonment was not without
something in the nature of relief.</p>

<p>In the first place, a careful survey of his surroundings showed
there were only six Sioux warriors in the attacking party. All
were mounted, as a matter of course, fully armed, and eager to
massacre the settler and his family. You will say these were enough
to frighten any lad, however brave; but you must remember that
Melville held a strong position in the house.</p>

<p>Such a fine horse as Saladin could not fail to catch the eye
of the dusky scamps, and at the moment Red Feather fired his well-nigh
fatal shot at the youth three warriors were putting forth their
utmost efforts to capture the prize.</p>

<p>But the wise Saladin showed no liking for the red men, and would
not permit any of them to lay hands on him. It was an easy matter
to do this, for among them all there was not one that could approach
him in fleetness. He suffered them to come quite near, and then,
flinging up his head with a defiant neigh, sped beyond their reach
like an arrow darting from the bow.</p>

<p>Melville's eyes kindled.</p>

<p>"I am proud of you, Saladin," he said, "and if I dared, I would
give you a hurrah."</p>

<p>He watched the performance for several minutes, the rapid movement
of the horses causing him to shift his position once or twice
from one side of the house to the other. Finally, one of the Sioux
saw how idle their pursuit was, and, angered at being baffled,
deliberately raised his rifle and fired at Saladin.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Saladin showed no liking for the red men."]</p>

<p>Whether he hit the horse or not Melville could not say, though
the animal showed no signs of being hurt: but the lad was so indignant
that he levelled his own weapon, and, pointing the muzzle out
of the narrow window, muttered&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you want to try that kind of business, I'm willing, and I
think I can make a better shot than you did."</p>

<p>Before, however, he could be sure of his aim, he was startled
by a cry from Dot&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come down here quick, Mel! A great big Indian is getting in
the house by the window!"</p>
