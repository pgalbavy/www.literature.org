As spring came on, a new set of amusements became the
fashion, and the lengthening days gave long afternoons for
work and play of all sorts.  The garden had to be put in order,
and each sister had a quarter of the little plot to do what she
liked with.  Hannah used to say, &quot;I'd know which each of them
gardings belonged to, ef I see 'em in Chiny,&quot; and so she might,
for the girls' tastes differed as much as their characters.  Meg's
had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange tree in it.
Jo's bed was never alike two seasons, for she was always trying
experiments.  This year it was to be a plantation of sun flowers,
the seeds of which cheerful land aspiring plant were to feed
Aunt Cockle-top and her family of chicks.  Beth had old-fashioned
fragrant flowers in her garden, sweet peas and mignonette,
larkspur, pinks, pansies, and southernwood, with chickweed for
the birds and catnip for the pussies.  Amy had a bower in hers,
rather small and earwiggy, but very pretty to look at, with
honeysuckle and morning-glories hanging their colored horns and
bells in graceful wreaths all over it, tall white lilies, delicate
ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants as would consent
to blossom there.</p>

<p>Gardening, walks, rows on the river, and flower hunts employed
the fine days, and for rainy ones, they had house diversions,
some old, some new, all more or less original.  One of these
was the 'P.C.', for as secret societies were the fashion,
it was thought proper to have one, and as all of the girls
admired Dickens, they called themselves the Pickwick Club.  With
a few interruptions, they had kept this up for a year, and met
every Saturday evening in the big garret, on which occasions the
ceremonies were as follows:  Three chairs were arranged in a row
before a table on which was a lamp, also four white badges, with
a big 'P.C.' in different colors on each, and the weekly
newspaper called, The Pickwick Portfolio, to which all contributed
something, while Jo, who reveled in pens and ink, was the editor.
At seven o'clock, the four members ascended to the clubroom,
tied their badges round their heads, and took their seats with
great solemnity.  Meg, as the eldest, was Samuel Pickwick, Jo,
being of a literary turn, Augustus Snodgrass, Beth, because she
was round and rosy, Tracy Tupman, and Amy, who was always trying
to do what she couldn't, was Nathaniel Winkle.  Pickwick, the
president, read the paper, which was filled with original tales,
poetry, local news, funny advertisements, and hints, in which
they good-naturedly reminded each other of their faults and
short comings.  On one occasion, Mr. Pickwick put on a pair
of spectacles without any glass, rapped upon the table, hemmed,
and having stared hard at Mr. Snodgrass, who was tilting back
in his chair, till he arranged himself properly, began to read:</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>THE MASKED MARRIAGE<br />
(A Tale Of Venice)<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>Gondola after gondola swept up to the marble<br />
steps, and left its lovely load to swell the<br />
brilliant throng that filled the stately halls of Count<br />
Adelon.  Knights and ladies, elves and pages, monks<br />
and flower girls, all mingled gaily in the dance.<br />
Sweet voices and rich melody filled the air, and so<br />
with mirth and music the masquerade went on.<br />
&quot;Has your Highness seen the Lady Viola tonight?&quot;<br />
asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who<br />
floated down the hall upon his arm.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>&quot;Yes, is she not lovely, though so sad!  Her<br />
dress is well chosen, too, for in a week she weds<br />
Count Antonio, whom she passionately hates.&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>&quot;By my faith, I envy him.  Yonder he comes,<br />
arrayed like a bridegroom, except the black mask.<br />
When that is off we shall see how he regards the<br />
fair maid whose heart he cannot win, though her<br />
stern father bestows her hand,&quot; returned the troubadour.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>&quot;Tis whispered that she loves the young English<br />
artist who haunts her steps, and is spurned by the<br />
old Count,&quot; said the lady, as they joined the dance.<br />
The revel was at its height when a priest<br />
appeared, and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove,<br />
hung with purple velvet, he motioned them to kneel.<br />
Instant silence fell on the gay throng, and not a<br />
sound, but the dash of fountains or the rustle of<br />
orange groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke the<br />
hush, as Count de Adelon spoke thus:<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>&quot;My lords and ladies, pardon the ruse by which<br />
I have gathered you here to witness the marriage of<br />
my daughter.  Father, we wait your services.&quot;<br />
All eyes turned toward the bridal party, and a<br />
murmur of amazement went through the throng, for<br />
neither bride nor groom removed their masks.  Curiosity<br />
and wonder possessed all hearts, but respect restrained<br />
all tongues till the holy rite was over.  Then the<br />
eager spectators gathered round the count, demanding<br />
an explanation.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>&quot;Gladly would I give it if I could, but I only<br />
know that it was the whim of my timid Viola, and I<br />
yielded to it.  Now, my children, let the play end.<br />
Unmask and receive my blessing.&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>But neither bent the knee, for the young bridegroom<br />
replied in a tone that startled all listeners<br />
as the mask fell, disclosing the noble face of Ferdinand<br />
Devereux, the artist lover, and leaning on the<br />
breast where now flashed the star of an English earl<br />
was the lovely Viola, radiant with joy and beauty.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>&quot;My lord, you scornfully bade me claim your<br />
daughter when I could boast as high a name and vast a<br />
fortune as the Count Antonio.  I can do more, for even<br />
your ambitious soul cannot refuse the Earl of Devereux<br />
and De Vere, when he gives his ancient name and boundless<br />
wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady,<br />
now my wife.&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>The count stood like one changed to stone, and<br />
turning to the bewildered crowd, Ferdinand added, with<br />
a gay smile of triumph, &quot;To you, my gallant friends, I<br />
can only wish that your wooing may prosper as mine has<br />
done, and that you may all win as fair a bride as I have<br />
by this masked marriage.&quot;<br />

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>THE HISTORY OF A SQUASH<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>Once upon a time a farmer planted a little seed<br />
in his garden, and after a while it sprouted and became<br />
a vine and bore many squashes.  One day in October,<br />
when they were ripe, he picked one and took it<br />
to market.  A gorcerman bought and put it in his shop.<br />
That same morning, a little girl in a brown hat<br />
and blue dress, with a round face and snub nose, went<br />
and bought it for her mother.  She lugged it home, cut<br />
it up, and boiled it in the big pot, mashed some of it<br />
with salt and butter, for dinner.  And to the rest she added<br />
a pint of milk, two eggs, four spoons of sugar, nutmeg,<br />
and some crackers, put it in a deep dish, and baked it<br />
till it was brown and nice, and next day it was eaten<br />
by a family named March.<br />

</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>On Friday last, we were startled by a violent shock<br />
in our basement, followed by cries of distress.<br />
On rushing in a body to the cellar, we discovered our beloved<br />
President prostrate upon the floor, having tripped and<br />
fallen while getting wood for domestic purposes.  A perfect<br />
scene of ruin met our eyes, for in his fall Mr. Pickwick<br />
had plunged his head and shoulders into a tub of water,<br />
upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form,  and torn<br />
his garments badly.  On being removed from this perilous<br />
situation, it was discovered that he had suffered<br />
no injury but several bruises, and we are happy to add,<br />
is now doing well.<br />

<p>__________________________________________________</p>

<p>As the President finished reading the paper (which I beg
leave to assure my readers is a bona fide copy of one written
by bona fide girls once upon a time), a round of applause
followed, and then Mr. Snodgrass rose to make a proposition.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. President and gentlemen,&quot; he began, assuming a
parliamentary attitude and tone, &quot;I wish to propose the admission
of a new member - one who highly deserves the honor, would be
deeply grateful for it, and would add immensely to the spirit
of the club, the literary value of the paper, and be no end
jolly and nice.  I propose Mr. Theodore Laurence as an honorary
member of the P.  C.  Come now, do have him.&quot;</p>

<p>Jo's sudden change of tone made the girls laugh, but all
looked rather anxious, and no one said a word as Snodgrass
took his seat.</p>

<p>&quot;We'll put it to a vote,&quot; said the President.  &quot;All in
favor of this motion please to manifest it by saying, 'Aye'.&quot;</p>

<p>A loud response from Snodgrass, followed, to everybody's 
surprise, by a timid one from Beth.</p>

<p>&quot;Contrary-minded say, 'No'.&quot;</p>

<p>Meg and Amy were contrary-minded, and Mr. Winkle rose to
say with great elegance, &quot;We don't wish any boys, they only
joke and bounce about.  This is a ladies' club, and we wish to
be private and proper.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid he'll laugh at our paper, and make fun of us
afterward,&quot; observed Pickwick, pulling the little curl on her
forehead, as she always did when doubtful.</p>

<p>Up rose Snodgrass, very much in earnest.  &quot;Sir, I give you
my word as a gentleman, Laurie won't do anything of the sort.  He
likes to write, and he'll give a tone to our contributions and
keep us from being sentimental, don't you see?  We can do so little
for him, and he does so much for us, I think the least we can do
is to offer him a place here, and make him welcome if he comes.&quot;</p>

<p>This artful allusion to benefits conferred brought Tupman to
his feet, looking as if he had quite made up his mind.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; we ought to do it, even if we are afraid.  I say he may
come, and his grandpa, too, if he likes.&quot;</p>

<p>This spirited burst from Beth electrified the club, and Jo
left her seat to shake hands approvingly.  &quot;Now then, vote again.
Everybody remember it's our Laurie, and say, 'Aye!'&quot;
cried Snodgrass excitedly.</p>

<p>&quot;Aye!  Aye!  Aye!&quot; replied three voices at once.</p>

<p>&quot;Good!  Bless you!  Now, as there's nothing like 'taking time
by the fetlock', as Winkle characteristically observes, allow me
to present the new member.&quot;  And, to the dismay of the rest of the
club, Jo threw open the door of the closet, and displayed Laurie
sitting on a rag bag, flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter.</p>

<p>&quot;You rogue!  You traitor!  Jo, how could you?&quot; cried the three
girls, as Snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth, and producing
both a chair and a badge, installed him in a jiffy.</p>

<p>&quot;The coolness of you two rascals is amazing,&quot; began Mr. Pickwick,
trying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in producing
an amiable smile.  But the new member was equal to the occasion,
and rising, with a grateful salutation to the Chair, said
in the most engaging manner, &quot;Mr. President and ladies - I beg pardon,
gentlemen - allow me to introduce myself as Sam Weller, the very
humble servant of the club.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good!  Good!&quot; cried Jo, pounding with the handle of the old
warming pan on which she leaned.</p>

<p>&quot;My faithful friend and noble patron,&quot; continued Laurie with
a wave of the hand, &quot;who has so flatteringly presented me, is not
to be blamed for the base stratagem of tonight.  I planned it, and
she only gave in after lots of teasing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come now, don't lay it all on yourself.  You know I proposed
the cupboard,&quot; broke in Snodgrass, who was enjoying the joke
amazingly.</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind what she says.  I'm the wretch that did it, sir,&quot;
said the new member, with a Welleresque nod to Mr. Pickwick.  &quot;But
on my honor, I never will do so again, and henceforth devote myself
to the interest of this immortal club.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hear!  Hear!&quot; cried Jo, clashing the lid of the warming pan
like a cymbal.</p>

<p>&quot;Go on, go on!&quot; added Winkle and Tupman, while the President
bowed benignly.</p>

<p>&quot;I merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude
for the honor done me, and as a means of promoting friendly relations
between adjoining nations, I have set up a post office in the hedge
in the lower corner of the garden, a fine, spacious building with
padlocks on the doors and every convenience for the mails, also the
females, if I may be allowed the expression.  It's the old martin
house, but I've stopped up the door and made the roof open, so it
will hold all sorts of things, and save our valuable time.  Letters,
manuscripts, books, and bundles can be passed in there, and as each
nation has a key, it will be uncommonly nice, I fancy.  Allow me to
present the club key, and with many thanks for your favor, take my
seat.&quot;</p>

<p>Great applause as Mr. Weller deposited a little key on the
table and subsided, the warming pan clashed and waved wildly, and
it was some time before order could be restored.  A long discussion
followed, and everyone came out surprising, for everyone did her
best.  So it was an unusually lively meeting, and did not adjourn
till a late hour, when it broke up with three shrill cheers for the
new member.</p>

<p>No one ever regretted the admittance of Sam Weller, for
a more devoted, well-behaved, and jovial member no club could have.
He certainly did add 'spirit' to the meetings, and 'a tone' to the
paper, for his orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions
were excellent, being patriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic,
but never sentimental.  Jo regarded them as worthy of Bacon, Milton,
or Shakespeare, and remodeled her own works with good effect, she
thought.</p>

<p>The P.  O.  was a capital little institution, and flourished
wonderfully, for nearly as many queer things passed through it as
through the real post office.  Tragedies and cravats, poetry and
pickles, garden seeds and long letters, music and gingerbread,
rubbers, invitations, scoldings, and puppies.  The old gentleman
liked the fun, and amused himself by sending odd bundles,
mysterious messages, and funny telegrams, and his gardener, who was
smitten with Hannah's charms, actually sent a love letter to Jo's
care.  How they laughed when the secret came out, never dreaming
how many love letters that little post office would hold in the
years to come.</p>
