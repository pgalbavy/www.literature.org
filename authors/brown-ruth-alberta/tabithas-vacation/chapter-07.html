<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>But when morning dawned, Gloriana lay flushed and feverish upon
her pillow, her head throbbing until she could scarcely open her
eyes. Tabitha was alarmed, and between her worry over the sick
girl lying in their darkened room, and her ministrations to croupy
Janie, who had caught cold sleeping in the night air on the mountain
top, the poor housekeeper was so nearly distracted that she had
little time to devote to the rest of her large family, and they
wandered about the premises like so many disconsolate chicks who
had lost their mother.  It was an ideal time to get into mischief,
and yet something restrained them.</p>

<p>The girls, it seemed, had slept through all the racket of the
previous night, and were not aware that anything out of the ordinary
had occurred, but they could not understand the tense atmosphere;
and when Mercedes heroically tried to fill Tabitha's place the
other members of the brood resented her authority, frankly found
fault with her badly cooked oatmeal and unsalted potatoes, and
insulted her attempts at housekeeping in such a heartless, unfeeling
manner that she finally dissolved in tears and refused to do anything
further toward their comfort.  Susie and Inez quarreled over the
dishes and had the sulks all day.  The boys, still fearful of
the consequences of their latest prank, and somewhat remorseful
at having frightened Gloriana into a fever, wandered aimlessly
away toward town, glad to escape from Tabitha's watchful eye,
and greatly relieved to think no mention had been made by anyone
of the burglars' visit.</p>

<p>"Guess the girls couldn't have heard the noise last night," ventured
Toady, when they had left the house far enough behind to make
it impossible for anyone to overhear their conversation.</p>

<p>"The girls?" repeated Billiard blankly, his thoughts on another
phase of the situation.</p>

<p>"Mercedes and Susie and the twins, I mean."</p>

<p>"Oh!  P'r'aps Tabitha's making 'em keep still."</p>

<p>"Do you think Tabitha knows we did it?" cried Toady in alarm.</p>

<p>"Naw, you ninny!  That is, not 'nless Glory's gone and squealed."</p>

<p>"But<hr>"</p>

<p>"I meant she'd prob'ly try to hush them up if they had heard
our racket, so's the whole town wouldn't know about the burglars."</p>

<p>"Why?  That's just what is worrying me.  If she has hushed them
up, it's just to make us believe she doesn't suspect.  I'll bet
the constable will be up there bright and early with his d'tectives,
asking all sorts of questions, and everyone in Silver Bow will
join in the hunt."</p>

<p>"Then we'll be found out even if Glory doesn't tell."</p>

<p>Toady nodded gloomily.</p>

<p>"It'll go hard with us if the <em>constable</em> should find
out who did it."</p>

<p>Again Toady nodded.</p>

<p>"We&mdash;better&mdash;light&mdash;out&mdash;now."</p>

<p>Toady stopped stock-still in the roadway.  "Why?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Do you want to go to jail?"</p>

<p>"Naw, but they don't put <em>kids</em> in jail here.  I s'pose
likely we'd get a good thrashing<hr>"</p>

<p>"Would you rather stay here and take a whaling than skip while
you've got the chance?" cried Billiard, turning pale at the mere
thought of such a punishment at the hands of a desert constable,
who, somehow, in his imagination, had assumed the proportions
and disposition of a monster.</p>

<p>"We&mdash;we deserve a sound licking," bravely replied Toady, whose
conscience was troubling him sorely.</p>

<p>It was Billiard's turn to halt in the rocky road and stare with
unbelieving eyes at his brother, finally finding vent for his
feelings by hissing the single word, "Coward!"</p>

<p>"No more coward than you!" Toady denied.  "We have been as mean
as dirt ever since we came here, and if Tabitha had been as hateful
as most girls are, she'd have written Uncle Hogan long ago."</p>

<p>"So you're fishing to get her to write, are you?"</p>

<p>"No, I ain't, but I believe she'd&mdash;like it&mdash;better&mdash;if we told
her ourselves, instead of getting found out by someone else."</p>

<p>"Oh!  Going to turn goody-goody, are you?" sneered Billiard,
not willing to admit that he had been thinking similar thoughts.</p>

<p>Toady bristled.  "I hate goody-goodies as bad as you do," he
said, with eyes flashing.  "But I'm going to own up to my part
in last night's racket.  We might have scared Glory to death."</p>

<p>"Pooh!  You make me sick!  Suppose you think she'll let you off
easy if you squeal.  Well, go ahead, tattler!  You will change
your mind maybe, when she writes to Uncle Hogan."</p>

<p>"If she wants to write Uncle Hogan, let her write!" screamed
the exasperated Toady, stung by his brother's taunts.  "I'm going
to quit bothering them right here and now; and what's more, I'm
going to own up, too."</p>

<p>"Tattler!"</p>

<p>Toady turned on his heel and strode haughtily away, not daring
to trust himself to further speech.</p>

<p>"Coward!  'Fraid cat!  Sissy girl!" jeered Billiard.</p>

<p>That was the last straw.  The younger boy wheeled about and retraced
his steps in a slow, ominous manner.  Thrusting his angry face
close to Billiard's, and shaking his clenched fist under his nose,
he said quietly, "Say that again if you dare, Williard McKittrick!"</p>

<p>Billiard was delighted.  He had succeeded in making Toady mad,
and now he would have the pleasure of thrashing him.  He felt
just like pounding someone.</p>

<p>"Coward!  'Fraid cat!  Sis<hr>"</p>

<p>A white fist shot out with accurate aim, striking the bully squarely
between the eyes.  A shower of stars danced merrily about him,
blood spurted from his nose, and the next thing he knew, he was
stretched flat on the rocky ground, with a grim-faced Toady bending
over him.</p>

<p>"Do you take it back?" a menacing voice was asking.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;" spluttered the angry victim, mopping his streaming
nose with his coat sleeve.</p>

<p>"Or do you want some more?"  The doubled-up fist drew perilously
near the disfigured face in the gravel.</p>

<p>"That's it!  Hit a fellow when he's down!" taunted the fallen
bully, still unable to realize just what had happened.</p>

<p>"I shan't hit you while you're down," said Toady calmly but decisively.
"I'll let you get onto your pins and then I'll knock them from
under you again."</p>

<p>And Billiard, looking up into the determined face above him,
knew that it was no idle threat.  Toady was in deadly earnest,
but still the older boy temporized.  It would never do to give
in to Toady.  If he took such a step as that, his leadership was
gone forever.  "Aw, come off!" he began, in what he meant to be
jocular tones.  "Quit your fooling and let me up!  I've swallowed
a bucket of blood already!"</p>

<p>"Will you take it back, or shall I pummel the stuffing out of
you?"</p>

<p>Billiard capitulated.  "I take it back," he said sullenly, "but,"&mdash;as
Toady removed his knees from his chest and allowed him to rise&mdash;"I'll
get even with you for this."</p>

<p>"All right," responded the younger boy cheerfully.  "But don't
forget that you will get what's coming to you, too."</p>

<p>"Don't be so sure, sonny!  You took me off guard; you know you
did, or you'd never have laid me out.  You weren't fair."</p>

<p>Toady, tasting his first victory over his bully brother, and
finding it very sweet, suggested casually, "I'll scrap <em>you</em>
any time you say. Now, if you like."</p>

<p>"My head aches too bad," said the other hastily.  "That was a
nasty place to fall.  It's a wonder it didn't fracture my skull."</p>

<p>Toady looked back at the spot which Billiard had adorned a moment
before, and remorse overtook him.  "I'm sorry, old chap, if I
hurt you," he said contritely.  "I wasn't aiming to put you out
of business, but you made me so all-fired mad<hr>"</p>

<p>"Aw, forget it!  I was just fooling," protested Billiard, shamed
by Toady's frank and manly confession.  "Say, ain't that the haunted
house the girls are always talking about?"</p>

<p>"Which?  Maybe 'tis.  It's the last one in town, they said. 
Mercy promised to point it out the next time we climbed the trail
behind the house.  Do you s'pose it really is haunted?"</p>

<p>"I dunno," Billiard answered indifferently.</p>

<p>Haunted houses in his opinion were things to be avoided.  He
had merely sought to distract Toady's thoughts from their fistic
encounter by mentioning the place.  But the younger boy's curiosity
was aroused, and as they neared the deserted, unpainted, dilapidated
hut, he studied it closely.  To him it looked like any other untenanted
shack in the mining town, and so he said musingly, "I wonder if
that man really did kill himself there, or was he murdered?"</p>

<p>Billiard shivered.  "Mercedes said he <em>died</em> there.  That's
all I know."</p>

<p>"She told me he was <em>found</em> dead, with all his pockets
turned inside out, and<hr>"</p>

<p>"Oh, Toady," interrupted Billiard again, "here's a plant just
like those mamma always has in her garden.  I didn't s'pose things
like that would grow here on the desert."</p>

<p>"That's a castor bean."</p>

<p>"Like they make castor oil of?"</p>

<p>"Sure!  At least, I guess so.  Glory told me it's the only thing
green on the desert that the burros won't eat.  Folks could have
flowers here the same as back home if water didn't cost so much,
and the burros didn't eat the plants as fast as they came up."</p>

<p>"It's the first castor bean <em>I've</em> seen here."</p>

<p>"Why, there's a whole bunch down by the drug-store!  We've passed
them dozens of times.  Where are your eyes?"</p>

<p>Billiard's face flushed wrathfully.  Toady's recent victory had
made him suddenly very important and domineering, but his fists
were certainly hard enough to deal a telling blow; so the older
boy, still caressing his swollen, aching nose, thought it wise
to overlook such sarcastic flings, and, pretending to be deeply
interested in the queer-leaved plant, he casually asked, "Do they
all have such funny burrs on them?"</p>

<p>"When they're big enough.  That's where the castor beans themselves
grow."</p>

<p>Billiard gingerly picked one of the strange balls and minutely
examined the hooked prickles of the reddish covering.  Then with
his jack-knife he proceeded to investigate the inside.  "Do you
s'pose they really make castor oil out of these?  I don't see
how they can."</p>

<p>"Glory says they do."</p>

<p>"The insides <em>smell</em> something like castor oil, but they
don't look at all oily."</p>

<p>"I'll bet they taste oily."</p>

<p>"Stump you to eat one!"</p>

<p>"Huh!  It doesn't bother me to take castor oil.  I can eat anything!"
To prove his boast, he plumped one white bean into his mouth,
and chewed it down with apparent relish.</p>

<p>Billiard watched him with eagle eyes to see that he actually
did swallow it, then held out another, and Toady obediently munched
it. Three, four, five,&mdash;bean by bean they disappeared down his
throat; but at last he rebelled.</p>

<p>"You hain't tasted one, Billiard McKittrick!  How many do you
think you are going to feed <em>me</em>?"</p>

<p>The brother laughed derisively.  "Wanted to see how big a fool
you was," he jeered.  "Thought you were going to eat all there
were on the bush."</p>

<p>Toady made no reply.  The beans tasted anything but appetizing,
and already the boy was beginning to feel queer.</p>

<p>"Sure you don't want some more?" teased Billiard.</p>

<p>"No.  Guess I'll go home."</p>

<p>"And tat&mdash;tell about last night?"  Billiard remembered all at
once the reason they were so far from the Eagles' Nest, and was
alarmed lest Toady's threatened confession should involve him
also.</p>

<p>"Y-e-s."</p>

<p>"I think you're downright mean, Toady McKittrick!"</p>

<p>"I shan't tell on you."</p>

<p>"Might as well!  They will know I was in it."</p>

<p>"And you know you ought to own up, too."</p>

<p>"Cut it out, good &mdash;Toady.  If you won't tell, I'll not
plague them&mdash;nor you&mdash;any more."</p>

<p>Toady silently plodded on, and in exasperation Billiard caught
him by the shoulder and shook him roughly.</p>

<p>"Le' go!" muttered the boy.  "I'm going home, I tell you!  Ge'
out my way!"</p>

<p>The white misery of that round, freckled face as it turned toward
him struck terror to the older brother's heart, and he excitedly
demanded, "What's the matter, kid?  Are you sick?"</p>

<p>"Feel funny," panted the castor-bean victim.  "<em>I&mdash;</em>want&mdash;to&mdash;lie&mdash;down."</p>

<p>"Let's hurry then.  We'll soon be home."  Billiard was genuinely
alarmed now, and seizing the other's cold hand, he tried to hasten
the lagging steps up the rocky trail.  But Toady was really too
ill to care what happened or where he went, and he stumbled blindly
on, tripping over a loose pebble here, or bruised by staggering
into a boulder there, protesting one minute that he could go no
further, and the next instant begging Billiard to hurry faster.</p>

<p>At length, however, the house was reached, and Toady drifted
like a crumpled leaf across the threshold and lay down in the
middle of the floor.  Irene had seen them coming, and rushed pell-mell
for Tabitha, shrieking in horrified accents, "Kitty, oh, Kitty,
they've been to a s'loon and got drunk!"</p>

<p>So Tabitha was somewhat prepared for their dramatic entrance;
but one glance at the livid lips, pinched nose and heavy, lusterless
eyes would have convinced her that Irene was mistaken, even if
Billiard had not caught the words and indignantly denied it. 
However, recalling a certain episode in Jerome Vane's life in
Silver Bow, she demanded severely, "How many cigarettes has he
smoked, Billiard McKittrick?"</p>

<p>"He hain't been smoking at all!" declared that young gentleman,
more ruffled at Tabitha's tone than at her accusation.  "He&mdash;he
&mdash;I dared him to eat some castor-beans, and I guess they
made him sick."</p>

<p>"Castor-beans!" shrieked Tabitha in wild alarm.  "Go for the
doctor at once.  Dr. Hayes at the drug-store!  Tell him it's castor-beans. 
He worked all night to save the Horan children who ate them once."</p>

<p>Billiard had shot out of the door before the words were out of
her mouth and was half-way down the trail before the dazed girl
awoke with a start to the realization that something must be done
at once for the suffering boy on the floor, or it might be too
late.  "We must make him vomit," she said to red-eyed Mercedes,
who had come out of her hiding-place to see what was the cause
of all the commotion.</p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<p>"I don't know myself what emetic would be best.  They use mustard
and warm water for some poisons, and&mdash;oh, I remember!  Bring me
that three-cornered, blue bottle from the cupboard, Susie.  Hurry! 
Your mother told me to use plenty of that if any of you got poisoned.
Mercedes, light the stove and set on the tea kettle.  Inez, get
the boy's bed ready, and Irene, bring some clean towels from the
closet."</p>

<p>Tabitha had suddenly grown calm again, and as she issued orders
to the panic-stricken sisters, she was deftly at work herself,
pouring the vile-tasting emetic down poor, unresisting Toady's
throat.  She worked hard and furiously, fearful that her efforts
might fail, and her heart sank within her as she watched the white
face grow whiter and listened to the weak moans which escaped
his lips with every breath.</p>

<p>Would the doctor never come?  The suspense was horrible.  When
it seemed as if she must scream with frenzy, the five watchers
on the door-step shouted wildly, "He's coming, he's coming!  Billiard
found him and he's got his v'lise!"</p>

<p>Another instant and he was in the kitchen kneeling beside the
limp form on the floor, and working as he questioned.  It was
over at last, the boy was pronounced out of danger, and Tabitha,
weak and trembling, felt her strength suddenly ooze from her limbs.</p>

<p>"Here, here, none of that!" commanded the physician in gruff
but kindly tones.  "There is no use of fainting now, my girl,
when you have done your work so well.  But for your efforts before
I got here, the chap might have been&mdash;well, he can thank his lucky
stars that he is in the land of the living."</p>

<p>Perhaps Toady heard, for when Tabitha bent over him a few moments
later, the brown eyes fluttered weakly open, and the repentant
sinner murmured, "How is Glory?"</p>

<p>"Better.  She will be well by morning.  But you mustn't talk
now."</p>

<p>"Yes, I must, 'cause I made her sick.  I burgled&mdash;that is, I
pretended I was a burglar last night and hid under your bed. 
I only meant to scare you, though.  Honest!"</p>

<p>"Sh!  I know all about it.  Go to sleep now, Toady."  When seeing
an unspoken question in his eyes, she answered, "No, Glory didn't
give you away.  I found it out myself."</p>

<p>"The constable<hr>"</p>

<p>"I never went for him at all.  He doesn't know a thing about
it."</p>

<p>"Uncle Hogan &mdash;I expect you'd better write him.  It was
awful mean of me, and I'm sorry, but he ought to know."</p>

<p>"Not this time, Toady.  I am sure you will not forget again."</p>

<p>A great light of relief crept into the big, brown eyes, and Toady
answered with all the vim he could muster, "You are right, I won't."</p>
