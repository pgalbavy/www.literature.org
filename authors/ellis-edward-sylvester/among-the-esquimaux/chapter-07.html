<p>Jack Cosgrove was awake on the instant. Not until he had groped
around in the darkness and repeated the name of Fred several times
in a loud voice would he believe he was not with them.</p>

<p>"Well, by the great horned spoon!" he exclaimed, "that beats
everything. How that chap got away, and why he done it, and where
he's gone to gets me."</p>

<p>"I wonder if he took his gun," added Rob, stooping over and examining
the depression in the ice, where the three laid their weapons
before composing themselves for sleep; "yes," he added directly
after, "he took his rifle with him."</p>

<p>As may be supposed, the two were in a frenzied state of mind,
and for several minutes were at a loss what to do, if, indeed,
they could do anything. They knew not where to look for their
missing friend, nor could they decide as to what had become of
him.</p>

<p>One fearful thought was in the minds of both, but neither gave
expression to it; each recoiled with a shudder from doing so.
It was that he had wandered off in his sleep and fallen into the
sea.</p>

<p>Despite their distress and dismay, they noticed several significant
facts. The wind that blew like a hurricane when they closed their
eyes, had subsided. When they stood up, so that their heads arose
above the projections that had protected them, the breeze was
so gentle that it was hard to tell from which direction it came.
It would be truth to say there was no wind at all.</p>

<p>Further, there was a marked rise in the temperature. In fact,
the weather was milder than any experienced after leaving St.
John, and was remarked by Rob.</p>

<p>"You don't often see anything of the kind," replied the sailor;
"though I call something of the kind to mind on that voyage in
these parts in the 'Mary Jane,' which was smashed by the iceberg."</p>

<p>But their thoughts instantly reverted to the missing boy. Rob
had shouted to him again and again in his loudest tones, had whistled
until the echo rang in his own ears, and had listened in vain
for the response.</p>

<p>The tumultuous waves did not subside as rapidly as they arose.
They broke against the walls of the iceberg with decreasing power,
but with a boom and crash that it would seem threatened to shatter
the vast structure into fragments. There were occasional lulls
in the overpowering turmoil, which were used both by Rob and Jack
in calling to the missing one, but with no result.</p>

<p>"It's no use," remarked the sailor, after they had tired themselves
pretty well out; "wherever he is, he can't hear us."</p>

<p>"I wonder if he will ever be able to hear us," said Rob, in a
choking voice, peering around in the gloom, his eyes and ears
strained to the highest tension.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew," replied Jack, who, though he was as much distressed
as his companion, was too thoughtful to add to the grief by any
words of his own. "I hope the lad is asleep somewhere in these
parts, but I don't know nothing more about him than you."</p>

<p>"And I know nothing at all."</p>

<p>"Can you find out what time it is?"</p>

<p>That was easily done. Stooping down so as to protect the flame
from any chance eddy of wind, Rob ignited a match on his clothing
and looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"We slept longer than I imagined, Jack; day-break isn't more
than three or four hours off."</p>

<p>"That's good, but them hours will seem the longest that you ever
passed, my hearty."</p>

<p>There could be no doubt on that point, as affected both.</p>

<p>"Why, Jack," called out Rob, "the stars are shining."</p>

<p>"Hadn't you observed that before? Yes; there's lots of the twinklers
out, and the storm is gone for good."</p>

<p>Every portion of the sky except the northern showed the glittering
orbs, and, for the moment, Rob forgot his grief in the surprise
over the marked change in the weather.</p>

<p>"This mildness will bring another change afore long," remarked
Jack.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Fogs. We'll catch it inside of twenty-four hours, and some of
them articles in this part of the world will beat them in London
town; thick enough for you to lean against without falling."</p>

<p>As the minutes passed, with the couple speculating as to what
could have happened to Fred Warburton, their uneasiness became
so great that they could not remain idle. They must do something
or they would lose command of themselves.</p>

<p>Rob was on the point of proposing a move, with little hope of
its amounting to anything, when the sailor caught his arm.</p>

<p>"Do you see that?"</p>

<p>The darkness had so lifted that the friends could distinguish
each other's forms quite plainly, and the lad saw that Jack had
extended his arm, and was pointing out to sea. The fellow was
startled, as he had good cause to be.</p>

<p>Apparently not far off was something resembling a star, low down
in the horizon and gliding over the surface of the deep. Now and
then it disappeared, but only for a moment. At such times it was
evidently shut from sight by the crests of the intervening waves.</p>

<p>It was moving steadily from the right to the left, the friends,
of course, being unable to decide what points of the compass these
were. Its motion in rising and sinking, vanishing and then coming
to view again, advancing steadily all the while, left no doubt
as to its nature.</p>

<p>"It's the 'Nautilus'!" exclaimed Rob; "Captain McAlpine is looking
for us."</p>

<p>"That's not the 'Nautilus'," said Jack; "for she doesn't show
her lights in that fashion. Howsumever, it's a craft of some kind,
and if we can only make 'em know we're here they'll lay by and
take us off in the morning."</p>

<p>As the only means of reaching the ears of the strangers the two
began shouting lustily, varying the cries as fancy suggested.
In addition, Jack fired his gun several times.</p>

<p>While thus busied they kept their gaze upon the star-like point
of light on which their hopes were fixed.</p>

<p>It maintained the same dancing motion, all the while pushing
forward, for several minutes after the emission of the signals.</p>

<p>"She has stopped!" was the joyful exclamation of Rob, who postponed
a shout that was trembling on his lips; "they have heard us and
will soon be here."</p>

<p>Jack was less hopeful, but thought his friend might be right.
The motion of the star from left to right had almost ceased, as
if the boat was coming to a halt. Still the sailor knew that the
same effect on their vision would be produced if the vessel headed
either away from or toward the iceberg; it was one of these changes
of direction that he feared had taken place.</p>

<p>Up and down the light bobbed out of sight for a second, then
gleaming brightly as if the obscuring clouds had been brushed
aside from the face of the star, which shone through the intervening
gloom like a beacon to the wanderer.</p>

<p>"Yes, they are coming to us," added Rob, forgetting his lost
friend in his excitement; "they will soon be here. I wonder they
don't hail us."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sartin, lad," was the answer of the sailor; "if
the boat was going straight from us it would seem for a time as
though she was coming this way; I b'lieve she has changed her
course without a thought of us."</p>

<p>They were cruel words, but, sad to say, they proved true. The
time was not long in coming when all doubt was removed. The star
dwindled to a smaller point than ever, seemed longer lost to view,
until finally it was seen no more.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose they heard us?" asked Rob, when it was no longer
possible to hope for relief from that source.</p>

<p>"Of course not; if they had they would have behaved like a Christian,
and stood by and done what they could."</p>

<p>"Ships are not numerous in this latitude, and it may be a long
time before we see another."</p>

<p>"The chances p'int that way, and yet you know there's a good
many settlements along the Greenland coast. It isn't exactly the
place I'd choose for a winter residence&mdash;especially back in the
country&mdash;but there are plenty who like it."</p>

<p>"In what way can that affect us?"</p>

<p>"There are ships passing back and forth between Denmark and Greenland,
and a number v'yage to the United States, and I'm hoping we may
be run across by some of them &mdash;Hark!"</p>
