<P>Upon the green waters of the canal bordered with marble,
upon which time had already scattered black spots and tufts
of mossy grass, there glided majestically a long, flat bark
adorned with the arms of England, surmounted by a dais, and
carpeted with long damasked stuffs, which trailed their
fringes in the water. Eight rowers, leaning lazily to their
oars, made it move upon the canal with the graceful slowness
of the swans, which, disturbed in their ancient possessions
by the approach of the bark, looked from a distance at this
splendid and noisy pageant. We say noisy  -  for the bark
contained four guitar and lute players, two singers, and
several courtiers, all sparkling with gold and precious
stones, and showing their white teeth in emulation of each
other, to please the Lady Henrietta Stuart, grand-daughter
of Henry IV., daughter of Charles I., and sister of Charles
II., who occupied the seat of honor under the dais of the
bark. We know this young princess, we have seen her at the
Louvre with her mother, wanting wood, wanting bread, and fed
by the coadjuteur and the parliament. She had, therefore,
like her brothers, passed through an uneasy youth; then, all
at once, she had just awakened from a long and horrible
dream, seated on the steps of a throne, surrounded by
courtiers and flatterers. Like Mary Stuart on leaving
prison, she aspired not only to life and liberty, but to
power and wealth.</P>
<P>The Lady Henrietta, in growing, had attained remarkable
beauty, which the recent restoration had rendered
celebrated. Misfortune had taken from her the luster of
pride, but prosperity had restored it to her. She was
resplendent, then, in her joy and her happiness,  -  like
those hot-house flowers which, forgotten during a frosty
autumn night, have hung their heads, but which on the
morrow, warmed once more by the atmosphere in which they
were born, rise again with greater splendor than ever.
Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, son of him who played so
conspicuous a part in the early chapters of this history,  - 
Villiers of Buckingham, a handsome cavalier, melancholy with
women, a jester with men,  -  and Wilmot, Lord Rochester, a
jester with both sexes, were standing at this moment before
the Lady Henrietta, disputing the privilege of making her
smile. As to that young and beautiful princess, reclining
upon a cushion of velvet bordered with gold, her hands
hanging listlessly so as to dip in the water, she listened
carelessly to the musicians without hearing them, and heard
the two courtiers without appearing to listen to them.</P>
<P>This Lady Henrietta  -  this charming creature  -  this woman
who joined the graces of France to the beauties of England,
not having yet loved, was cruel in her coquetry. The smile,
then,  -  that innocent favor of young girls,  -  did not even
lighten her countenance; and if, at times, she did raise her
eyes, it was to fasten them upon one or other of the
cavaliers with such a fixity, that their gallantry, bold as
it generally was, took the alarm, and became timid.</P>
<P>In the meanwhile the boat continued its course, the
musicians made a great noise, and the courtiers began, like
them, to be out of breath. Besides, the excursion became
doubtless monotonous to the princess, for all at once,
shaking her head with an air of impatience,  -  &quot;Come,
gentlemen,  -  enough of this;  -  let us land.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, madam,&quot; said Buckingham, &quot;we are very unfortunate! We
have not succeeded in making the excursion agreeable to your
royal highness.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My mother expects me,&quot; replied the princess; &quot;and I must
frankly admit, gentlemen, I am bored.&quot; And whilst uttering
this cruel word, Henrietta endeavored to console by a look
each of the two young men, who appeared terrified at such
frankness. The look produced its effect  -  the two faces
brightened; but immediately, as if the royal coquette
thought she had done too much for simple mortals, she made a
movement, turned her back on both her adorers, and appeared
plunged in a reverie in which it was evident they had no
part.</P>
<P>Buckingham bit his lips with anger, for he was truly in love
with Lady Henrietta, and, in that case, took everything in a
serious light. Rochester bit his lips likewise; but his wit
always dominated over his heart, it was purely and simply to
repress a malicious smile. The princess was then allowing
the eyes she turned from the young nobles to wander over the
green and flowery turf of the park, when she perceived Parry
and D'Artagnan at a distance.</P>
<P>&quot;Who is coming yonder?&quot; said she.</P>
<P>The two young men turned round with the rapidity of
lightning.</P>
<P>&quot;Parry,&quot; replied Buckingham, &quot;nobody but Parry.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; said Rochester, &quot;but I think he has a
companion.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the princess, at first with languor, but then,
 -  &quot;What mean those words, `Nobody but Parry;' say, my
lord?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because, madam,&quot; replied Buckingham, piqued, &quot;because the
faithful Parry, the wandering Parry, the eternal Parry, is
not, I believe, of much consequence.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are mistaken, duke. Parry  -  the wandering Parry, as
you call him  -  has always wandered in the service of my
family, and the sight of that old man always gives me
satisfaction.&quot;</P>
<P>The Lady Henrietta followed the usual progress of pretty
women, particularly coquettish women; she passed from
caprice to contradiction;  -  the gallant had undergone the
caprice, the courtier must bend beneath the contradictory
humor. Buckingham bowed, but made no reply.</P>
<P>&quot;It is true, madam,&quot; said Rochester, bowing in his turn,
&quot;that Parry is the model of servants; but, madam, he is no
longer young, and we laugh only when we see cheerful
objects. Is an old man a gay object?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Enough, my lord,&quot; said the princess, coolly; &quot;the subject
of conversation is unpleasant to me.&quot;</P>
<P>Then, as if speaking to herself, &quot;It is really
unaccountable,&quot; said she, &quot;how little regard my brother's
friends have for his servants.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, madam,&quot; cried Buckingham, &quot;your royal highness pierces
my heart with a dagger forged by your own hands.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is the meaning of that speech, which is turned so like
a French madrigal, duke? I do not understand it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It means, madam, that you yourself, so good, so charming,
so sensible, you have laughed sometimes  -  smiled, I should
say  -  at the idle prattle of that good Parry, for whom your
royal highness to-day entertains such a marvelous
susceptibility.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, my lord, if I have forgotten myself so far,&quot; said
Henrietta, &quot;you do wrong to remind me of it.&quot; And she made a
sign of impatience. &quot;The good Parry wants to speak to me, I
believe: please order them to row to the shore, my Lord
Rochester.&quot;</P>
<P>Rochester hastened to repeat the princess's command; and a
moment later the boat touched the bank.</P>
<P>&quot;Let us land, gentlemen,&quot; said Henrietta, taking the arm
which Rochester offered her, although Buckingham was nearer
to her, and had presented his. Then Rochester, with an
ill-dissembled pride, which pierced the heart of the unhappy
Buckingham through and through, led the princess across the
little bridge which the rowers had cast from the royal boat
to the shore.</P>
<P>&quot;Which way will your royal highness go?&quot; asked Rochester.</P>
<P>&quot;You see, my lord, towards that good Parry, who is
wandering, as my lord of Buckingham says, and seeking me
with eyes weakened by the tears he has shed over our
misfortunes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good heavens!&quot; said Rochester, &quot;how sad your royal highness
is to-day; in truth we seem ridiculous fools to you, madam.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Speak for yourself, my lord,&quot; interrupted Buckingham with
vexation; &quot;for my part, I displease her royal highness to
such a degree, that I appear absolutely nothing to her.&quot;</P>
<P>Neither Rochester nor the princess made any reply; Henrietta
only urged her companion more quickly on. Buckingham
remained behind, and took advantage of this isolation to
give himself up to his anger; he bit his handkerchief so
furiously that it was soon in shreds.</P>
<P>&quot;Parry my good Parry,&quot; said the princess, with her gentle
voice, &quot;come hither. I see you are seeking me, and I am
waiting for you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, madam,&quot; said Rochester, coming charitably to the help
of his companion, who had remained, as we have said, behind,
&quot;if Parry cannot see your royal highness, the man who
follows him is a sufficient guide, even for a blind man, for
he has eyes of flame. That man is a double-lamped lantern.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Lighting a very handsome martial countenance,&quot; said the
princess, determined to be as ill-natured as possible.
Rochester bowed. &quot;One of those vigorous soldiers' heads seen
nowhere but in France,&quot; added the princess, with the
perseverance of a woman sure of impunity.</P>
<P>Rochester and Buckingham looked at each other, as much as to
say,  -  &quot;What can be the matter with her?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;See, my lord of Buckingham, what Parry wants,&quot; said
Henrietta. &quot;Go!&quot;</P>
<P>The young man, who considered this order as a favor, resumed
his courage, and hastened to meet Parry, who, followed by
D'Artagnan, advanced slowly on account of his age.
D'Artagnan walked slowly but nobly, as D'Artagnan, doubled
by the third of a million, ought to walk, that is to say,
without conceit or swagger, but without timidity. When
Buckingham, very eager to comply with the desire of the
princess, who had seated herself on a marble bench, as if
fatigued with the few steps she had gone,  -  when
Buckingham, we say, was at a distance of only a few paces
from Parry, the latter recognized him.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah I my lord!&quot; cried he, quite out of breath, &quot;will your
grace obey the king?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In what, Mr. Parry?&quot; said the young man, with a kind of
coolness tempered by a desire to make himself agreeable to
the princess.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, his majesty begs your grace to present this gentleman
to her royal highness the Princess Henrietta.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In the first place, what is the gentleman's name?&quot; said the
duke, haughtily.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan, as we know, was easily affronted, and the Duke
of Buckingham's tone displeased him. He surveyed the
courtier from head to foot, and two flashes beamed from
beneath his bent brows. But, after a struggle,  -  &quot;Monsieur
le Chevalier d'Artagnan, my lord,&quot; replied he, quietly.</P>
<P>&quot;Pardon me, sir, that name teaches me your name but nothing
more.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You mean  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I mean I do not know you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am more fortunate than you, sir,&quot; replied D'Artagnan,
&quot;for I have had the honor of knowing your family, and
particularly my lord Duke of Buckingham, your illustrious
father.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My father?&quot; said Buckingham. &quot;Well, I think I now remember.
Monsieur le Chevalier d'Artagnan, do you say?&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan bowed. &quot;In person,&quot; said he.</P>
<P>&quot;Pardon me, but are you one of those Frenchmen who had
secret relations with my father?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Exactly, my lord duke, I am one of those Frenchmen.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then, sir, permit me to say that it was strange my father
never heard of you during his lifetime.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, monsieur, but he heard of me at the moment of his
death: it was I who sent to him, through the hands of the
valet de chambre of Anne of Austria, notice of the dangers
which threatened him; unfortunately, it came too late.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Never mind, monsieur,&quot; said Buckingham. &quot;I understand now,
that, having had the intention of rendering a service to the
father, you have come to claim the protection of the son.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In the first place, my lord,&quot; replied D'Artagnan,
phlegmatically, &quot;I claim the protection of no man. His
majesty Charles II., to whom I have had the honor of
rendering some services  -  I may tell you, my lord, my life
has been passed in such occupations  -  King Charles II.,
then, who wishes to honor me with some kindness, desires me
to be presented to her royal highness the Princess
Henrietta, his sister, to whom I shall, perhaps, have the
good fortune to be of service hereafter. Now, the king knew
that you at this moment were with her royal highness, and
sent me to you. There is no other mystery, I ask absolutely
nothing of you; and if you will not present me to her royal
highness, I shall be compelled to do without you, and
present myself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At least, sir,&quot; said Buckingham, determined to have the
last word, &quot;you will not refuse me an explanation provoked
by yourself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I never refuse, my lord,&quot; said D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;As you have had relations with my father, you must be
acquainted with some private details?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;These relations are already far removed from us, my lord  - 
for you were not then born  -  and for some unfortunate
diamond studs, which I received from his hands and carried
back to France, it is really not worth while awakening so
many remembrances.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! sir,&quot; said Buckingham, warmly, going up to D'Artagnan,
and holding out his hand to him, &quot;it is you, then  -  you
whom my father sought everywhere and who had a right to
expect so much from us.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To expect, my lord, in truth, that is my forte; all my life
I have expected.&quot;</P>
<P>At this moment, the princess, who was tired of not seeing
the stranger approach her, arose and came towards them.</P>
<P>&quot;At least, sir,&quot; said Buckingham, &quot;you shall not wait for
the presentation you claim of me.&quot;</P>
<P>Then turning toward the princess and bowing: &quot;Madam,&quot; said
the young man, &quot;the king, your brother, desires me to have
the honor of presenting to your royal highness, Monsieur le
Chevalier d'Artagnan.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In order that your royal highness may have, in case of
need, a firm support and a sure friend,&quot; added Parry.
D'Artagnan bowed.</P>
<P>&quot;You have still something to say, Parry,&quot; replied Henrietta,
smiling upon D'Artagnan, while addressing the old servant.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, madam, the king desires you to preserve religiously in
your memory the name and merit of M. d'Artagnan, to whom his
majesty owes, he says, the recovery of his kingdom.&quot;
Buckingham, the princess, and Rochester looked at each
other.</P>
<P>&quot;That,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;is another little secret, of
which, in all probability, I shall not boast to his
majesty's son, as I have done to you with respect to the
diamond studs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Madam,&quot; said Buckingham, &quot;monsieur has just, for the second
time, recalled to my memory an event which excites my
curiosity to such a degree, that I shall venture to ask your
permission to take him to one side for a moment, to converse
in private.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do, my lord,&quot; said the princess, &quot;but restore to the
sister, as quickly as possible, this friend so devoted to
the brother.&quot; And she took the arm of Rochester whilst
Buckingham took that of D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! tell me, chevalier,&quot; said Buckingham, &quot;all that affair
of the diamonds, which nobody knows in England, not even the
son of him who was the hero of it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My lord, one person alone had a right to relate all that
affair, as you call it, and that was your father; he thought
proper to be silent. I must beg you to allow me to be so
likewise.&quot; And D'Artagnan bowed like a man upon whom it was
evident no entreaties could prevail.</P>
<P>&quot;Since it is so, sir,&quot; said Buckingham, &quot;pardon my
indiscretion, I beg you; and if, at any time, I should go
into France  -  -  &quot; and he turned round to take a last look
at the princess, who took but little notice of him, totally
occupied as she was, or appeared to be, with Rochester.
Buckingham sighed.</P>
<P>&quot;Well?&quot; said D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;I was saying that if, any day, I were to go to France  -  - 
&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You will go, my lord,&quot; said D'Artagnan. &quot;I shall answer for
that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And how so?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, I have strange powers of prediction; if I do predict
anything I am seldom mistaken. If, then, you do come to
France?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, monsieur, you, of whom kings ask that valuable
friendship which restores crowns to them, I will venture to
beg of you a little of that great interest you took in my
father.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My lord,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, &quot;believe me, I shall deem
myself highly honored if, in France, you remember having
seen me here. And now permit  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>Then, turning towards the princess: &quot;Madam,&quot; said he, &quot;your
royal highness is a daughter of France; and in that quality
I hope to see you again in Paris. One of my happy days will
be that on which your royal highness shall give me any
command whatever, thus proving to me that you have not
forgotten the recommendations of your august brother.&quot; And
he bowed respectfully to the young princess, who gave him
her hand to kiss with a right royal grace.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! madam,&quot; said Buckingham, in a subdued voice, &quot;what can
a man do to obtain a similar favor from your royal
highness?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Dame! my lord &quot; replied Henrietta, &quot;ask Monsieur
d'Artagnan; he will tell you.&quot;</P></article>
