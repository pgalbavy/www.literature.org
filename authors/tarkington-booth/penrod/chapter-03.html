<p>After lunch his mother and his sister Margaret, a pretty girl
of nineteen, dressed him for the sacrifice. They stood him near
his mother's bedroom window and did what they would to him.</p>

<p>During the earlier anguishes of the process he was mute, exceeding
the pathos of the stricken calf in the shambles; but a student
of eyes might have perceived in his soul the premonitory symptoms
of a sinister uprising. At a rehearsal (in citizens' clothes)
attended by mothers and grown-up sisters, Mrs. Lora Rewbush had
announced that she wished the costuming to be "as medieval and
artistic as possible." Otherwise, and as to details, she said,
she would leave the costumes entirely to the good taste of the
children's parents. Mrs. Schofield and Margaret were no archeologists,
but they knew that their taste was as good as that of other mothers
and sisters concerned; so with perfect confidence they had planned
and executed a costume for Penrod; and the only misgiving they
felt was connected with the tractability of the Child Sir Lancelot
himself.</p>

<p>Stripped to his underwear, he had been made to wash himself vehemently;
then they began by shrouding his legs in a pair of silk stockings,
once blue but now mostly whitish. Upon Penrod they visibly surpassed
mere ampleness; but they were long, and it required only a rather
loose imagination to assume that they were tights.</p>

<p>The upper part of his body was next concealed from view by a
garment so peculiar that its description becomes difficult. In
1886, Mrs. Schofield, then unmarried, had worn at her "coming-out
party" a dress of vivid salmon silk which had been remodelled
after her marriage to accord with various epochs of fashion until
a final, unskilful campaign at a dye-house had left it in a condition
certain to attract much attention to the wearer. Mrs. Schofield
had considered giving it to Della, the cook; but had decided not
to do so, because you never could tell how Della was going to
take things, and cooks were scarce.</p>

<p>It may have been the word "medieval" (in Mrs. Lora Rewbush's
rich phrase) which had inspired the idea for a last conspicuous
usefulness; at all events, the bodice of that once salmon dress,
somewhat modified and moderated, now took a position, for its
farewell appearance in society, upon the back, breast, and arms
of the Child Sir Lancelot.</p>

<p>The area thus costumed ceased at the waist, leaving a Jaeger-like
and unmedieval gap thence to the tops of the stockings. The inventive
genius of woman triumphantly bridged it, but in a manner which
imposes upon history almost insuperable delicacies of narration.
Penrod's father was an old-fashioned man: the twentieth century
had failed to shake his faith in red flannel for cold weather;
and it was while Mrs. Schofield was putting away her husband's
winter underwear that she perceived how hopelessly one of the
elder specimens had dwindled; and simultaneously she received
the inspiration which resulted in a pair of trunks for the Child
Sir Lancelot, and added an earnest bit of colour, as well as a
genuine touch of the Middle Ages, to his costume. Reversed, fore
to aft, with the greater part of the legs cut off, and strips
of silver braid covering the seams, this garment, she felt, was
not traceable to its original source.</p>

<p>When it had been placed upon Penrod, the stockings were attached
to it by a system of safety-pins, not very perceptible at a distance.
Next, after being severely warned against stooping, Penrod got
his feet into the slippers he wore to dancing-school&mdash;"patent-leather
pumps" now decorated with large pink rosettes.</p>

<p>"If I can't stoop," he began, smolderingly, "I'd like to know
how'm I goin' to kneel in the pag&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You must <em>MANAGE!" </em>This, uttered through pins, was evidently
thought to be sufficient.</p>

<p>They fastened some ruching about his slender neck, pinned ribbons
at random all over him, and then Margaret thickly powdered his
hair.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that's all right," she said, replying to a question
put by her mother. "They always powdered their hair in Colonial
times."</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem right to me&mdash;exactly," objected Mrs. Schofield,
gently. "Sir Lancelot must have been ever so long before Colonial
times."</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter," Margaret reassured her. "Nobody'll know
the difference &mdash;Mrs. Lora Rewbush least of all. I don't
think she knows a thing about it, though, of course, she does
write splendidly and the words of the pageant are just beautiful.
Stand still, Penrod!" (The author of "Harold Ramorez" had moved
convulsively.) "Besides, powdered hair's always becoming. Look
at him. You'd hardly know it was Penrod!"</p>

<p>The pride and admiration with which she pronounced this undeniable
truth might have been thought tactless, but Penrod, not analytical,
found his spirits somewhat elevated. No mirror was in his range
of vision and, though he had submitted to cursory measurements
of his person a week earlier, he had no previous acquaintance
with the costume. He began to form a not unpleasing mental picture
of his appearance, something somewhere between the portraits of
George Washington and a vivid memory of Miss Julia Marlowe at
a matinee of "Twelfth Night."</p>

<p>He was additionally cheered by a sword which had been borrowed
from a neighbor, who was a Knight of Pythias. Finally there was
a mantle, an old golf cape of Margaret's. Fluffy polka-dots of
white cotton had been sewed to it generously; also it was ornamented
with a large cross of red flannel, suggested by the picture of
a Crusader in a newspaper advertisement. The mantle was fastened
to Penrod's shoulder (that is, to the shoulder of Mrs. Schofield's
ex-bodice) by means of large safety-pins, and arranged to hang
down behind him, touching his heels, but obscuring nowise the
glory of his facade. Then, at last, he was allowed to step before
a mirror.</p>

<p>It was a full-length glass, and the worst immediately happened.
It might have been a little less violent, perhaps, if Penrod's
expectations had not been so richly and poetically idealized;
but as things were, the revolt was volcanic.</p>

<p>Victor Hugo's account of the fight with the devil-fish, in "Toilers
of the Sea," encourages a belief that, had Hugo lived and increased
in power, he might have been equal to a proper recital of the
half hour which followed Penrod's first sight of himself as the
Child Sir Lancelot. But Mr. Wilson himself, dastard but eloquent
foe of Harold Ramorez, could not have expressed, with all the
vile dashes at his command, the sentiments which animated Penrod's
bosom when the instantaneous and unalterable conviction descended
upon him that he was intended by his loved ones to make a public
spectacle of himself in his sister's stockings and part of an
old dress of his mother's.</p>

<p>To him these familiar things were not disguised at all; there
seemed no possibility that the whole world would not know them
at a glance. The stockings were worse than the bodice. He had
been assured that these could not be recognized, but, seeing them
in the mirror, he was sure that no human eye could fail at first
glance to detect the difference between himself and the former
purposes of these stockings. Fold, wrinkle, and void shrieked
their history with a hundred tongues, invoking earthquake, eclipse,
and blue ruin. The frantic youth's final submission was obtained
only after a painful telephonic conversation between himself and
his father, the latter having been called up and upon, by the
exhausted Mrs. Schofield, to subjugate his offspring by wire.</p>

<p>The two ladies made all possible haste, after this, to deliver
Penrod into the hands of Mrs. Lora Rewbush; nevertheless, they
found opportunity to exchange earnest congratulations upon his
not having recognized the humble but serviceable paternal garment
now brilliant about the Lancelotish middle. Altogether, they felt
that the costume was a success. Penrod looked like nothing ever
remotely imagined by Sir Thomas Malory or Alfred Tennyson;&mdash;for
that matter, he looked like nothing ever before seen on earth;
but as Mrs. Schofield and Margaret took their places in the audience
at the Women's Arts and Guild Hall, the anxiety they felt concerning
Penrod's elocutionary and gesticular powers, so soon to be put
to public test, was pleasantly tempered by their satisfaction
that, owing to their efforts, his outward appearance would be
a credit to the family.</p>
