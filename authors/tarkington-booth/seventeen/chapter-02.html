<p>He was roused by the bluff greeting of an acquaintance not dissimilar
to himself in age, manner, and apparel.</p>

<p>"H'lo, Silly Bill!" said this person, halting beside William
Sylvanus Baxter. "What's the news?"</p>

<p>William showed no enthusiasm; on the contrary, a frown of annoyance
appeared upon his brow. The nickname "Silly Bill"&mdash;long ago compounded
by merry child-comrades from "William" and "Sylvanus"&mdash;was not
to his taste, especially in public, where he preferred to be addressed
simply and manfully as "Baxter." Any direct expression of resentment,
however, was difficult, since it was plain that Johnnie Watson
intended no offense whatever and but spoke out of custom.</p>

<p>"Don't know any," William replied, coldly.</p>

<p>"Dull times, ain't it?" said Mr. Watson, a little depressed by
his friend's manner. "I heard May Parcher was comin' back to town
yesterday, though."</p>

<p>"Well, let her!" returned William, still severe.</p>

<p>"They said she was goin' to bring a girl to visit her," Johnnie
began in a confidential tone. "They said she was a reg'lar ringdinger
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what if she is?" the discouraging Mr. Baxter interrupted.
"Makes little difference to ME, I guess!"</p>

<p>"Oh no, it don't. <em>YOU </em>don't take any interest in girls!
OH no!"</p>

<p>"No, I do not!" was the emphatic and heartless retort. "I never
saw one in my life I'd care whether she lived or died!"</p>

<p>"Honest?" asked Johnnie, struck by the conviction with which
this speech was uttered. "Honest, is that so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, 'honest'!" William replied, sharply. "They could <em>ALL
</em>die, <em>I</em> wouldn't notice!"</p>

<p>Johnnie Watson was profoundly impressed. "Why, <em>I</em> didn't
know you felt that way about 'em, Silly Bill. I always thought
you were kind of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I do feel that way about 'em!" said William Sylvanus Baxter,
and, outraged by the repetition of the offensive nickname, he
began to move away. "You can tell 'em so for me, if you want to!"
he added over his shoulder. And he walked haughtily up the street,
leaving Mr. Watson to ponder upon this case of misogyny, never
until that moment suspected.</p>

<p>It was beyond the power of his mind to grasp the fact that William
Sylvanus Baxter's cruel words about "girls" had been uttered because
William was annoyed at being called "Silly Bill" in a public place,
and had not known how to object otherwise than by showing contempt
for any topic of conversation proposed by the offender. This latter,
being of a disposition to accept statements as facts, was warmly
interested, instead of being hurt, and decided that here was something
worth talking about, especially with representatives of the class
so sweepingly excluded from the sympathies of Silly Bill.</p>

<p>William, meanwhile, made his way toward the "residence section"
of the town, and presently&mdash;with the passage of time found himself
eased of his annoyance. He walked in his own manner, using his
shoulders to emphasize an effect of carelessness which he wished
to produce upon observers. For his consciousness of observers
was abnormal, since he had it whether any one was looking at him
or not, and it reached a crucial stage whenever he perceived persons
of his own age, but of opposite sex, approaching.</p>

<p>A person of this description was encountered upon the sidewalk
within a hundred yards of his own home, and William Sylvanus Baxter
saw her while yet she was afar off. The quiet and shady thoroughfare
was empty of all human life, at the time, save for those two;
and she was upon the same side of the street that he was; thus
it became inevitable that they should meet, face to face, for
the first time in their lives. He had perceived, even in the distance,
that she was unknown to him, a stranger, because he knew all the
girls in this part of the town who dressed as famously in the
mode as that! And then, as the distance between them lessened,
he saw that she was ravishingly pretty; far, far prettier, indeed,
than any girl he knew. At least it seemed so, for it is, unfortunately,
much easier for strangers to be beautiful. Aside from this advantage
of mystery, the approaching vision was piquant and graceful enough
to have reminded a much older boy of a spotless white kitten,
for, in spite of a charmingly managed demureness, there was precisely
that kind of playfulness somewhere expressed about her. Just now
it was most definite in the look she bent upon the light and fluffy
burden which she carried nestled in the inner curve of her right
arm: a tiny dog with hair like cotton and a pink ribbon round
his neck&mdash;an animal sated with indulgence and idiotically unaware
of his privilege. He was half asleep!</p>

<p>William did not see the dog, or it is the plain, anatomical truth
that when he saw how pretty the girl was, his heart&mdash;his physical
heart&mdash;began to do things the like of which, experienced by an
elderly person, would have brought the doctor in haste. In addition,
his complexion altered&mdash;he broke out in fiery patches. He suffered
from breathlessness and from pressure on the diaphragm.</p>

<p>Afterward, he could not have named the color of the little parasol
she carried in her left hand, and yet, as it drew nearer and nearer,
a rosy haze suffused the neighborhood, and the whole world began
to turn an exquisite pink. Beneath this gentle glow, with eyes
downcast in thought, she apparently took no note of William, even
when she and William had come within a few yards of each other.
Yet he knew that she would look up and that their eyes must meet&mdash;a
thing for which he endeavored to prepare himself by a strange
weaving motion of his neck against the friction of his collar&mdash;for
thus, instinctively, he strove to obtain greater ease and some
decent appearance of manly indifference. He felt that his efforts
were a failure; that his agitation was ruinous and must be perceptible
at a distance of miles, not feet. And then, in the instant of
panic that befell, when her dark-lashed eyelids slowly lifted,
he had a flash of inspiration.</p>

<p>He opened his mouth somewhat, and as her eyes met his, full and
startlingly, he placed three fingers across the orifice, and also
offered a slight vocal proof that she had surprised him in the
midst of a yawn.</p>

<p>"Oh, hum!" he said.</p>

<p>For the fraction of a second, the deep blue spark in her eyes
glowed brighter&mdash;gentle arrows of turquoise shot him through and
through&mdash;and then her glance withdrew from the ineffable collision.
Her small, white-shod feet continued to bear her onward, away
from him, while his own dimmed shoes peregrinated in the opposite
direction &mdash;William necessarily, yet with excruciating reluctance,
accompanying them. But just at the moment when he and the lovely
creature were side by side, and her head turned from him, she
spoke that is, she murmured, but he caught the words.</p>

<p>"You Flopit, wake up!" she said, in the tone of a mother talking
baby-talk. "SO indifferink!"</p>

<p>William's feet and his breath halted spasmodically. For an instant
he thought she had spoken to him, and then for the first time
he perceived the fluffy head of the dog bobbing languidly over
her arm, with the motion of her walking, and he comprehended that
Flopit, and not William Sylvanus Baxter, was the gentleman addressed.
But&mdash;but had she <em>MEANT </em>him?</p>

<p>His breath returning, though not yet operating in its usual manner,
he stood gazing after her, while the glamorous parasol passed
down the shady street, catching splashes of sunshine through the
branches of the maple-trees; and the cottony head of the tiny
dog continued to be visible, bobbing rhythmically over a filmy
sleeve. Had she meant that William was indifferent? Was it William
that she really addressed?</p>

<p>He took two steps to follow her, but a suffocating shyness stopped
him abruptly and, in a horror lest she should glance round and
detect him in the act, he turned and strode fiercely to the gate
of his own home before he dared to look again. And when he did
look, affecting great casualness in the action, she was gone,
evidently having turned the corner. Yet the street did not seem
quite empty; there was still something warm and fragrant about
it, and a rosy glamor lingered in the air. William rested an elbow
upon the gate-post, and with his chin reposing in his hand gazed
long in the direction in which the unknown had vanished. And his
soul was tremulous, for she had done her work but too well.</p>

<p>"'Indifferink'!" he murmured, thrilling at his own exceedingly
indifferent imitation of her voice. "Indifferink!" that was just
what he would have her think&mdash;that he was a cold, indifferent
man. It was what he wished all girls to think. And "sarcastic"!
He had been envious one day when May Parcher said that Joe Bullitt
was "awfully sarcastic."  William had spent the ensuing hour in
an object-lesson intended to make Miss Parcher see that William
Sylvanus Baxter was twice as sarcastic as Joe Bullitt ever thought
of being, but this great effort had been unsuccessful, because
William, failed to understand that Miss Parcher had only been
sending a sort of message to Mr. Bullitt. It was a device not
unique among her sex; her hope was that William would repeat her
remark in such a manner that Joe Bullitt would hear it and call
to inquire what she meant.</p>

<p>"'SO indifferink'!" murmured William, leaning dreamily upon the
gate-post. "Indifferink!" He tried to get the exact cooing quality
of the unknown's voice. "Indifferink!" And, repeating the honeyed
word, so entrancingly distorted, he fell into a kind of stupor;
vague, beautiful pictures rising before him, the one least blurred
being of himself, on horseback, sweeping between Flopit and a
racing automobile. And then, having restored the little animal
to its mistress, William sat carelessly in the saddle (he had
the Guardsman's seat) while the perfectly trained steed wheeled
about, forelegs in the air, preparing to go. "But shall I not
see you again, to thank you more properly?" she cried, pleading.
"Some other day&mdash;perhaps," he answered.</p>

<p>And left her in a cloud of dust.</p>
