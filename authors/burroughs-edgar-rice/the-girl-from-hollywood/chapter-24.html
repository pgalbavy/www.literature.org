<p>The next morning he saw Shannon, who came to ride with them, the
Penningtons, as had been her custom. She looked tired, as if she had
spent a sleepless night. She had--she had spent two sleepless nights,
and she had had to fight the old fight all over again. It had been very
hard, even though she had won, for it had shown her that the battle was
not over. She had thought that she had conquered the craving; but that
had been when she had had no troubles or unhappiness to worry her mind
and nerves. The last two days had been days of suffering for her, and
the two sleepless nights had induced a nervous condition that begged
for the quieting influence of the little white powder.
</p>
<p>Custer noticed immediately that something was amiss. The roses were
gone from her cheeks, leaving a suggestion of the old pallor; and
though she smiled and greeted him happily, he thought that he detected
an expression of wistfulness and pain in her face when she was not
conscious that others were observing her.
</p><p>There was a strange suggestion of change in their relations, which
Custer did not attempt to analyze. It was as if he had been gone a long
time, and, returning, had found Shannon changed through the natural
processes of time and separation. She was not the same girl--she could
never be the same again, nor could their relations ever be the same.
</p><p>The careless freedom of their association, which had resembled that of
a brother and sister more than any other relationship between a man and
a woman, had gone forever. What had replaced it Custer did not know.
Sometimes he thought that it was a suspicion of Shannon that clung to
his mind in spite of himself, but again and again he assured himself
that he held no suspicion of her.
</p><p>He wished, though, that she would explain that which was to him
inexplicable. He had the faith to believe that she could explain it
satisfactorily; but would she do so? She had had the opportunity,
before this thing had occurred, and had not taken advantage of it. He
would give her another opportunity that day, and he prayed that she
would avail herself of it. Why he should care so much, he did not try
to reason. He did not even realize how much he did care.
</p><p>Presently he turned toward her.
</p><p>“I am going to ride over to the east pasture after breakfast,” he said,
and waited.
</p><p>“Is that an invitation?”
</p><p>He smiled and nodded.
</p><p>“But not if it isn’t perfectly convenient,” he added.
</p><p>“I’d love to come with you. You know I always do.”
</p><p>“Fine! And you’ll breakfast with us?”
</p><p>“Not to-day. I have a couple of letters to write that I want to get off
right away; but I’ll be up between eight thirty and nine. Is that too
late?”
</p><p>“I’ll ride down after breakfast and wait for you--if I won’t be in the
way.”
</p><p>“Of course you won’t. It will take me only a few minutes to write my
letters.”
</p><p>“How are you going to mail them? This is Sunday.”
</p><p>“Mr. Powers is going to drive in to Los Angeles to-day. He’ll mail them
in the city.”
</p><p>“Who looks after things when Mr. and Mrs. Powers are away?”
</p><p>“Who looks after things? Why, I do.”
</p><p>“The chickens, and the sow, and Baldy--you take care of them all?”
</p><p>“Certainly, and I have more than that now.”
</p><p>“How’s that?”
</p><p>“Nine little pigs! They came yesterday. They’re perfect beauties.”
</p><p>The man laughed.
</p><p>“What are you laughing about?” she demanded.
</p><p>“The idea of you taking care of chickens and pigs and a horse!”
</p><p>“I don’t see anything funny about it, and it’s lot of fun. Did you
think I was too stupid?”
</p><p>“I was just thinking what a change two months have made. What would you
have done if you’d been left alone two months ago with a hundred hens,
a horse, and ten pigs to care for?”
</p><p>“The question then would have been what the hens, the horse, and the
pigs would have done; but now I know pretty well what to do. The two
letters I have to write are about the little pigs. I don’t know much
about them, and so I am writing to Berkeley and Washington for the
latest bulletins.”
</p><p>“Why don’t you ask <u>us</u>?”
</p><p>“Gracious, but I do! I am forever asking the colonel questions, and
the boys at the hog house must hate to see me coming. I’ve spent hours
in the office, reading Lovejoy and Colton; but I want something for
ready reference. I’ve an idea that I can raise lots more hogs than I
intended by fencing the orchard and growing alfalfa between the rows,
for pasture. There’s something solid and substantial about hogs that
suggests a bank balance even in the years when the orange crop may be
short or a failure, or the market poor.”
</p><p>“You’ve got the right idea,” said Custer. “There isn’t a rancher or an
orchardist, big or little, in the valley who couldn’t make more money
year in and year out if he’d keep a few brood sows.”
</p><p>“What’s Cus doing?” asked Eva, who had reined back beside them.
“Preaching hog raising again? That’s his idea of a dapper little way to
entertain a girl--hogs, Herefords and horses! Wouldn’t he make a hit in
society? Regular little tea pointer, I’ll say!”
</p><p>“I knew you were about to say something,” remarked her brother. “You’ve
been quiet for all of five minutes.”
</p><p>“I’ve been thinking,” said Eva. “I’ve been thinking how lonely it will
be when you have to go away to jail.”
</p><p>“Why, they can’t send me to jail--I haven’t done anything,” he tried to
reassure her.
</p><p>“I’m so afraid, Cus!” The tears came to her eyes. “I lay awake for
hours last night, thinking about it. Oh, Cus, I just couldn’t stand it
if they sent you to jail! Do you think the men who did it would let you
go for something they did? Could any one be so wicked? I never hated
any one in my life, but I could hate them, if they don’t come forward
and save you. I could <u>hate</u> them, <u>hate</u> them, <u>hate</u> them! Oh, Cus,
I believe that I could <u>kill</u> the man who would do such a thing to my
brother!”
</p><p>“Come, dear, don’t worry about it. The chances are that they’ll free
me. Even if they don’t, you mustn’t feel quite so bitterly against the
men who are responsible. There may be reasons that you know nothing of
that would keep them silent. Let’s not talk about it. All we can do now
is to wait and see what the grand jury is going to do. In the meantime
I don’t intend to worry.”
</p><p>Shannon Burke, her heart heavy with shame and sorrow, listened as might
a condemned man to the reading of his death sentence. She felt almost
the degradation that might have been hers had she deliberately planned
to ensnare Custer Pennington in the toils that had been laid for him.
</p><p>She determined that she would go before the grand jury and tell all she
knew. Then she would go away. She would not have to see the contempt
and hatred they must surely feel for her after she had recited the
cold facts that she must lay before the jury, unmitigated by any of
those extenuating truths that must lie forever hidden in the secret
recesses of her soul. They would know only that she might have warned
Custer, and did not; that she might have cleared him at his preliminary
hearing, and did not. The fact that she had come to his rescue at the
eleventh hour would not excuse her, in their minds, of the guilt
of having permitted the Pennington honor to be placed in jeopardy
needlessly; nor could it explain her knowledge of the crime, or those
associations of her past life that had made it possible for her to have
gained such knowledge.
</p><p>No, she could never face them again after the following Wednesday; but
until then she would cling to the brief days of happiness that remained
to her before the final catastrophe of her life, for it was thus that
she thought of it--the moment and the act that would forever terminate
her intercourse with the Penningtons, that would turn the respect of
the man she loved to loathing.
</p><p>She counted the hours before the end. There would be two more morning
rides--to-morrow and Tuesday. They would ask her to dinner, or to
lunch, or to breakfast several times in the ensuing three days, and
there would be rides with Custer. She would take all the happy memories
that she could into the bleak and sunless future.
</p><p>Their ride that morning was over a loved and familiar trail that led
across El Camino Corto over low hills into Horse Camp Cañon, and up
Horse Camp to Coyote Springs; then over El Camino Largo to Sycamore
Cañon and down beneath the old, old sycamores to the ranch. She felt
that she knew each bush and tree and bowlder, and they held for her the
quiet restfulness of the familiar faces of old friends. She should miss
them, but she would carry them in her memory forever.
</p><p>When they came to the fork in the road, she would not let Custer ride
home with her.
</p><p>“At eight thirty, then,” he called to her, as she urged Baldy into a
canter and left them with a gay wave of the hand that gave no token of
the heavy sorrow in her heart.
</p><p>As was her custom, she ate breakfast with Mr. and Mrs. Powers at the
little tenant cottage a couple of hundred yards in rear of her own
bungalow--a practice which gave her an opportunity to discuss each
day’s work in advance with her foreman, and at the same time to add
to her store of information concerning matters of ranching and citrus
culture. Her knowledge of these things had broadened rapidly, and was a
constant source of surprise to Powers, who took great pride in bragging
about it to his friends; for Shannon had won as great a hold upon the
hearts of these two as she had upon all who were fortunate enough to
know her well.
</p><p>After breakfast, as she was returning to her bungalow to write her
letters, she saw a Mexican boy on a bicycle turn in at her gate. They
met in front of the bungalow.
</p><p>“Are you Miss Burke?” he asked. “Bartolo says for you to come to his
camp in the mountains this morning, sure,” he went on, having received
an affirmative reply.
</p><p>“Who is Bartolo?”
</p><p>“He says you know. You went to his camp a week ago yesterday.”
</p><p>“Tell him I do not know him and will not go.”
</p><p>“He says to tell you that he only wants to talk to you about your
friend who is in trouble.”
</p><p>The girl thought for a moment. Possibly here was a way out of her
dilemma. If she could force Bartolo by threats of exposure, he might
discover a way to clear Custer Pennington without incriminating
himself. She turned to the boy.
</p><p>“Tell him I will come.”
</p><p>“I do not see him again. He is up in his camp now. He told me this
yesterday. He also told me to tell you that he would be watching for
you, and if you did not come alone you would not find him.”
</p><p>“Very well,” she said, and turned into the bungalow.
</p><p>She wrote her letters, but she was not thinking about them. Then she
took them over to Powers to take to the city for her. After that she
went to the telephone and called the Rancho del Ganado, asking for
Custer when she got the connection.
</p><p>“I’m terribly disappointed,” she said, when he came to the telephone.
“I find I simply can’t ride this morning; but if you’ll put it off
until afternoon----”
</p><p>“Why, certainly! Come up to lunch and we’ll ride afterward,” he told
her.
</p><p>“You won’t go, then, until afternoon?” she asked.
</p><p>“I’ll ride over to the east pasture this morning, and we’ll just take a
ride any old place that you want to go this afternoon.”
</p><p>“All right,” she replied.
</p><p>She had hoped that he would not ride that morning. There was a chance
that he might see her, even though the east pasture was miles from the
trail she would ride, for there were high places on both trails, where
a horseman would be visible for several miles.
</p><p>“This noon at lunch, then,” he said.
