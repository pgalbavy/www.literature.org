<article class="w3-container w3-justify">

Tarzan scooped a shallow grave for the Kincaid's cook,
beneath whose repulsive exterior had beaten the heart of
a chivalrous gentleman.  That was all he could do in the cruel
jungle for the man who had given his life in the service of
his little son and his wife.
<P>
Then Tarzan took up again the pursuit of Rokoff.  Now that
he was positive that the woman ahead of him was indeed
Jane, and that she had again fallen into the hands of the
Russian, it seemed that with all the incredible speed of his
fleet and agile muscles he moved at but a snail's pace.
<P>
It was with difficulty that he kept the trail, for there were
many paths through the jungle at this point--crossing and
crisscrossing, forking and branching in all directions, and over
them all had passed natives innumerable, coming and going.  
The spoor of the white men was obliterated by that of the
native carriers who had followed them, and over all was the
spoor of other natives and of wild beasts.
<P>
It was most perplexing; yet Tarzan kept on assiduously,
checking his sense of sight against his sense of smell, that he
might more surely keep to the right trail.  But, with all his
care, night found him at a point where he was positive that
he was on the wrong trail entirely.
<P>
He knew that the pack would follow his spoor, and so he
had been careful to make it as distinct as possible, brushing
often against the vines and creepers that walled the jungle-
path, and in other ways leaving his scent-spoor plainly discernible.
<P>
As darkness settled a heavy rain set in, and there was
nothing for the baffled ape-man to do but wait in the partial
shelter of a huge tree until morning; but the coming of dawn
brought no cessation of the torrential downpour.
<P>
For a week the sun was obscured by heavy clouds, while
violent rain and wind storms obliterated the last remnants of
the spoor Tarzan constantly though vainly sought.
<P>
During all this time he saw no signs of natives, nor of his
own pack, the members of which he feared had lost his trail
during the terrific storm.  As the country was strange to him,
he had been unable to judge his course accurately, since he had had
neither sun by day nor moon nor stars by night to guide him.
<P>
When the sun at last broke through the clouds in the
fore- noon of the seventh day, it looked down upon
an almost frantic ape-man.
<P>
For the first time in his life, Tarzan of the Apes had been
lost in the jungle.  That the experience should have befallen
him at such a time seemed cruel beyond expression.  Somewhere in
this savage land his wife and son lay in the clutches of the
arch-fiend Rokoff.
<P>
What hideous trials might they not have undergone during
those seven awful days that nature had thwarted him in his
endeavours to locate them?  Tarzan knew the Russian, in
whose power they were, so well that he could not doubt but
that the man, filled with rage that Jane had once escaped
him, and knowing that Tarzan might be close upon his trail,
would wreak without further loss of time whatever vengeance
his polluted mind might be able to conceive.
<P>
But now that the sun shone once more, the ape-man was still
at a loss as to what direction to take.  He knew that Rokoff
had left the river in pursuit of Anderssen, but whether he
would continue inland or return to the Ugambi was a question.
<P>
The ape-man had seen that the river at the point he had left
it was growing narrow and swift, so that he judged that
it could not be navigable even for canoes to any great
distance farther toward its source.  However, if Rokoff had
not returned to the river, in what direction had he proceeded?
<P>
From the direction of Anderssen's flight with Jane and the
child Tarzan was convinced that the man had purposed
attempting the tremendous feat of crossing the continent to
Zanzibar; but whether Rokoff would dare so dangerous a
journey or not was a question.
<P>
Fear might drive him to the attempt now that he knew the
manner of horrible pack that was upon his trail, and that
Tarzan of the Apes was following him to wreak upon him
the vengeance that he deserved.
<P>
At last the ape-man determined to continue toward the
northeast in the general direction of German East Africa until
he came upon natives from whom he might gain information
as to Rokoff's whereabouts.
<P>
The second day following the cessation of the rain Tarzan
came upon a native village the inhabitants of which fled into
the bush the instant their eyes fell upon him.  Tarzan, not to
be thwarted in any such manner as this, pursued them, and
after a brief chase caught up with a young warrior.  The fellow
was so badly frightened that he was unable to defend
himself, dropping his weapons and falling upon the ground,
wide-eyed and screaming as he gazed on his captor.
<P>
It was with considerable difficulty that the ape-man quieted
the fellow's fears sufficiently to obtain a coherent statement
from him as to the cause of his uncalled-for terror.
<P>
From him Tarzan learned, by dint of much coaxing, that
a party of whites had passed through the village several
days before.  These men had told them of a terrible white
devil that pursued them, warning the natives against it and
the frightful pack of demons that accompanied it.
<P>
The black had recognized Tarzan as the white devil from
the descriptions given by the whites and their black servants.  
Behind him he had expected to see a horde of demons disguised
as apes and panthers.
<P>
In this Tarzan saw the cunning hand of Rokoff.  The Russian
was attempting to make travel as difficult as possible for
him by turning the natives against him in superstitious fear.
<P>
The native further told Tarzan that the white man who had
led the recent expedition had promised them a fabulous reward
if they would kill the white devil.  This they had fully
intended doing should the opportunity present itself; but the
moment they had seen Tarzan their blood had turned to water,
as the porters of the white men had told them would be the case.
<P>
Finding the ape-man made no attempt to harm him, the native
at last recovered his grasp upon his courage, and, at Tarzan's
suggestion, accompanied the white devil back to the village,
calling as he went for his fellows to return also, as "the
white devil has promised to do you no harm if you come back
right away and answer his questions."
<P>
One by one the blacks straggled into the village, but that
their fears were not entirely allayed was evident from the
amount of white that showed about the eyes of the majority
of them as they cast constant and apprehensive sidelong
glances at the ape-man.
<P>
The chief was among the first to return to the village, and
as it was he that Tarzan was most anxious to interview, he
lost no time in entering into a palaver with the black.
<P>
The fellow was short and stout, with an unusually low and
degraded countenance and apelike arms.  His whole expression
denoted deceitfulness.
<P>
Only the superstitious terror engendered in him by the
stories poured into his ears by the whites and blacks of the
Russian's party kept him from leaping upon Tarzan with his
warriors and slaying him forthwith, for he and his people
were inveterate maneaters.  But the fear that he might indeed
be a devil, and that out there in the jungle behind him his
fierce demons waited to do his bidding, kept M'ganwazam
from putting his desires into action.
<P>
Tarzan questioned the fellow closely, and by comparing
his statements with those of the young warrior he had first
talked with he learned that Rokoff and his safari were in
terror-stricken retreat in the direction of the far East Coast.
<P>
Many of the Russian's porters had already deserted him.  
In that very village he had hanged five for theft and
attempted desertion.  Judging, however, from what the Waganwazam
had learned from those of the Russian's blacks who were not
too far gone in terror of the brutal Rokoff to fear even to
speak of their plans, it was apparent that he would not travel
any great distance before the last of his porters, cooks,
tent-boys, gun-bearers, askari, and even his headman,
would have turned back into the bush, leaving him to
the mercy of the merciless jungle.
<P>
M'ganwazam denied that there had been any white woman
or child with the party of whites; but even as he spoke Tarzan
was convinced that he lied.  Several times the ape-man approached
the subject from different angles, but never was he successful
in surprising the wily cannibal into a direct contradiction of
his original statement that there had been no women or children
with the party.
<P>
Tarzan demanded food of the chief, and after considerable haggling
on the part of the monarch succeeded in obtaining a meal.
He then tried to draw out others of the tribe, especially the
young man whom he had captured in the bush, but M'ganwazam's
presence sealed their lips.
<P>
At last, convinced that these people knew a great deal
more than they had told him concerning the whereabouts of
the Russian and the fate of Jane and the child, Tarzan
determined to remain overnight among them in the hope of
discovering something further of importance.
<P>
When he had stated his decision to the chief he was rather
surprised to note the sudden change in the fellow's attitude
toward him.  From apparent dislike and suspicion M'ganwazam
became a most eager and solicitous host.
<P>
Nothing would do but that the ape-man should occupy the
best hut in the village, from which M'ganwazam's oldest
wife was forthwith summarily ejected, while the chief took up
his temporary abode in the hut of one of his younger consorts.
<P>
Had Tarzan chanced to recall the fact that a princely reward had
been offered the blacks if they should succeed in killing him,
he might have more quickly interpreted M'ganwazam's sudden
change in front.
<P>
To have the white giant sleeping peacefully in one of his own
huts would greatly facilitate the matter of earning the reward,
and so the chief was urgent in his suggestions that Tarzan,
doubtless being very much fatigued after his travels,
should retire early to the comforts of the anything but
inviting palace.
<P>
As much as the ape-man detested the thought of sleeping
within a native hut, he had determined to do so this night,
on the chance that he might be able to induce one of the
younger men to sit and chat with him before the fire that
burned in the centre of the smoke-filled dwelling, and from
him draw the truths he sought.  So Tarzan accepted the
invitation of old M'ganwazam, insisting, however, that he much
preferred sharing a hut with some of the younger men rather
than driving the chief's old wife out in the cold.
<P>
The toothless old hag grinned her appreciation of this suggestion,
and as the plan still better suited the chief's scheme,
in that it would permit him to surround Tarzan with a gang
of picked assassins, he readily assented, so that presently
Tarzan had been installed in a hut close to the village gate.
<P>
As there was to be a dance that night in honour of a band
of recently returned hunters, Tarzan was left alone in the hut,
the young men, as M'ganwazam explained, having to take part
in the festivities.
<P>
As soon as the ape-man was safely installed in the trap,
M'Ganwazam called about him the young warriors whom he
had selected to spend the night with the white devil!
<P>
None of them was overly enthusiastic about the plan, since
deep in their superstitious hearts lay an exaggerated fear
of the strange white giant; but the word of M'ganwazam was
law among his people, so not one dared refuse the duty he
was called upon to perform.
<P>
As M'ganwazam unfolded his plan in whispers to the savages
squatting about him the old, toothless hag, to whom Tarzan
had saved her hut for the night, hovered about the conspirators
ostensibly to replenish the supply of firewood for the blaze
about which the men sat, but really to drink in as much of
their conversation as possible.
<P>
Tarzan had slept for perhaps an hour or two despite the
savage din of the revellers when his keen senses came suddenly
alert to a suspiciously stealthy movement in the hut in
which he lay.  The fire had died down to a little heap of
glowing embers, which accentuated rather than relieved the
darkness that shrouded the interior of the evil-smelling
dwelling, yet the trained senses of the ape-man warned him
of another presence creeping almost silently toward him
through the gloom.
<P>
He doubted that it was one of his hut mates returning from
the festivities, for he still heard the wild cries of the dancers
and the din of the tom-toms in the village street without.  
Who could it be that took such pains to conceal his approach?
<P>
As the presence came within reach of him the ape-man bounded
lightly to the opposite side of the hut, his spear poised
ready at his side.
<P>
"Who is it," he asked, "that creeps upon Tarzan of the
Apes, like a hungry lion out of the darkness?"
<P>
"Silence, bwana!" replied an old cracked voice.  "It is
Tambudza--she whose hut you would not take, and thus drive
an old woman out into the cold night."
<P>
"What does Tambudza want of Tarzan of the Apes?" asked the ape-man.
<P>
"You were kind to me to whom none is now kind, and I have come
to warn you in payment of your kindness," answered the old hag.
<P>
"Warn me of what?"
<P>
"M'ganwazam has chosen the young men who are to sleep in the
hut with you," replied Tambudza.  "I was near as he talked
with them, and heard him issuing his instructions to them.  
When the dance is run well into the morning they are
to come to the hut.
<P>
"If you are awake they are to pretend that they have come
to sleep, but if you sleep it is M'ganwazam's command that
you be killed.  If you are not then asleep they will wait quietly
beside you until you do sleep, and then they will all fall upon
you together and slay you.  M'ganwazam is determined to
win the reward the white man has offered."
<P>
"I had forgotten the reward," said Tarzan, half to himself,
and then he added, "How may M'ganwazam hope to collect
the reward now that the white men who are my enemies
have left his country and gone he knows not where?"
<P>
"Oh, they have not gone far," replied Tambudza.  
"M'ganwazam knows where they camp.  His runners could
quickly overtake them--they move slowly."
<P>
"Where are they?" asked Tarzan.
<P>
"Do you wish to come to them?" asked Tambudza in way of reply.
<P>
Tarzan nodded.
<P>
"I cannot tell you where they lie so that you could come
to the place yourself, but I could lead you to them, bwana."
<P>
In their interest in the conversation neither of the speakers
had noticed the little figure which crept into the darkness of
the hut behind them, nor did they see it when it slunk
noiselessly out again.
<P>
It was little Buulaoo, the chief's son by one of his younger
wives--a vindictive, degenerate little rascal who hated Tambudza,
and was ever seeking opportunities to spy upon her and report her
slightest breach of custom to his father.
<P>
"Come, then," said Tarzan quickly, "let us be on our way."
<P>
This Buulaoo did not hear, for he was already legging it up
the village street to where his hideous sire guzzled native
beer, and watched the evolutions of the frantic dancers
leaping high in the air and cavorting wildly in their
hysterical capers.
<P>
So it happened that as Tarzan and Tambudza sneaked warily
from the village and melted into the Stygian darkness of
the jungle two lithe runners took their way in the same
direction, though by another trail.
<P>
When they had come sufficiently far from the village to
make it safe for them to speak above a whisper, Tarzan asked
the old woman if she had seen aught of a white woman and
a little child.
<P>
"Yes, bwana," replied Tambudza, "there was a woman
with them and a little child--a little white piccaninny.  
It died here in our village of the fever and they buried it!"
<P>
