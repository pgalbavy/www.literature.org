<p>Everything depended on whether the servant was in the hall. I
had put Stumm to sleep for a bit, but I couldn’t flatter myself
he would long be quiet, and when he came to he would kick the
locked door to matchwood. I must get out of the house without
a minute’s delay, and if the door was shut and the old man gone
to bed I was done.</p>

<p>I met him at the foot of the stairs, carrying a candle.</p>

<p>"Your master wants me to send off an important telegram. Where
is the nearest office? There’s one in the village, isn’t there?"
I spoke in my best German, the first time I had used the tongue
since I crossed the frontier.</p>

<p>"The village is five minutes off at the foot of the avenue,"
he said. "Will you be long, sir?"</p>

<p>"I’ll be back in a quarter of an hour," I said. "Don’t lock up
till I get in."</p>

<p>I put on my ulster and walked out into a clear starry night.
My bag I left lying on a settle in the hall. There was nothing
in it to compromise me, but I wished I could have got a toothbrush
and some tobacco out of it.</p>

<p>So began one of the craziest escapades you can well imagine.
I couldn’t stop to think of the future yet, but must take one
step at a time. I ran down the avenue, my feet cracking on the
hard snow, planning hard my programme for the next hour.</p>

<p>I found the village—half a dozen houses with one biggish place
that looked like an inn. The moon was rising, and as I approached
I saw that there was some kind of a store. A funny little two-seated
car was purring before the door, and I guessed this was also the
telegraph office.</p>

<p>I marched in and told my story to a stout woman with spectacles
on her nose who was talking to a young man.</p>

<p>"It is too late," she shook her head. "The Herr Burgrave knows
that well. There is no connection from here after eight o’clock.
If the matter is urgent you must go to Schwandorf."</p>

<p>"How far is that?" I asked, looking for some excuse to get decently
out of the shop.</p>

<p>"Seven miles," she said, "but here is Franz and the post-wagon.
Franz, you will be glad to give the gentleman a seat beside you."</p>

<p>The sheepish-looking youth muttered something which I took to
be assent, and finished off a glass of beer. From his eyes and
manner he looked as if he were half drunk.</p>

<p>I thanked the woman, and went out to the car, for I was in a
fever to take advantage of this unexpected bit of luck. I could
hear the post-mistress enjoining Franz not to keep the gentleman
waiting, and presently he came out and flopped into the driver’s
seat. We started in a series of voluptuous curves, till his eyes
got accustomed to the darkness.</p>

<p>At first we made good going along the straight, broad highway
lined with woods on one side and on the other snowy fields melting
into haze. Then he began to talk, and, as he talked, he slowed
down. This by no means suited my book, and I seriously wondered
whether I should pitch him out and take charge of the thing. He
was obviously a weakling, left behind in the conscription, and
I could have done it with one hand. But by a fortunate chance
I left him alone.</p>

<p>"That is a fine hat of yours, mein Herr," he said. He took off
his own blue peaked cap, the uniform, I suppose, of the driver
of the post-wagon, and laid it on his knee. The night air ruffled
a shock of tow-coloured hair.</p>

<p>Then he calmly took my hat and clapped it on his head.</p>

<p>"With this thing I should be a gentleman," he said.</p>

<p>I said nothing, but put on his cap and waited.</p>

<p>"That is a noble overcoat, mein Herr," he went on. "It goes well
with the hat. It is the kind of garment I have always desired
to own. In two days it will be the holy Christmas, when gifts
are given. Would that the good God sent me such a coat as yours!"</p>

<p>"You can try it on to see how it looks," I said good-humouredly.</p>

<p>He stopped the car with a jerk, and pulled off his blue coat.
The exchange was soon effected. He was about my height, and my
ulster fitted not so badly. I put on his overcoat, which had a
big collar that buttoned round the neck.</p>

<p>The idiot preened himself like a girl. Drink and vanity had primed
him for any folly. He drove so carelessly for a bit that he nearly
put us into a ditch. We passed several cottages and at the last
he slowed down.</p>

<p>"A friend of mine lives here," he announced. "Gertrud would like
to see me in the fine clothes which the most amiable Herr has
given me. Wait for me, I will not be long." And he scrambled out
of the car and lurched into the little garden.</p>

<p>I took his place and moved very slowly forward. I heard the door
open and the sound of laughing and loud voices. Then it shut,
and looking back I saw that my idiot had been absorbed into the
dwelling of his Gertrud. I waited no longer, but sent the car
forward at its best speed.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the infernal thing began to give trouble—a
nut loose in the antiquated steering-gear. I unhooked a lamp,
examined it, and put the mischief right, but I was a quarter of
an hour doing it. The highway ran now in a thick forest and I
noticed branches going off now and then to the right. I was just
thinking of turning up one of them, for I had no anxiety to visit
Schwandorf, when I heard behind me the sound of a great car driven
furiously.</p>

<p>I drew in to the right side—thank goodness I remembered the rule
of the road—and proceeded decorously, wondering what was going
to happen. I could hear the brakes being clamped on and the car
slowing down. Suddenly a big grey bonnet slipped past me and as
I turned my head I heard a familiar voice.</p>

<p>It was Stumm, looking like something that has been run over.
He had his jaw in a sling, so that I wondered if I had broken
it, and his eyes were beautifully bunged up. It was that that
saved me, that and his raging temper. The collar of the postman’s
coat was round my chin, hiding my beard, and I had his cap pulled
well down on my brow. I remembered what Blenkiron had said—that
the only way to deal with the Germans was naked bluff. Mine was
naked enough, for it was all that was left to me.</p>

<p>"Where is the man you brought from Andersbach?" he roared, as
well as his jaw would allow him.</p>

<p>I pretended to be mortally scared, and spoke in the best imitation
I could manage of the postman’s high cracked voice.</p>

<p>"He got out a mile back, Herr Burgrave," I quavered. "He was
a rude fellow who wanted to go to Schwandorf, and then changed
his mind."</p>

<p>"Where, you fool? Say exactly where he got down or I will wring
your neck."</p>

<p>"In the wood this side of Gertrud’s cottage ... on the left hand.
I left him running among the trees." I put all the terror I knew
into my pipe, and it wasn’t all acting.</p>

<p>"He means the Henrichs’ cottage, Herr Colonel," said the chauffeur.
"This man is courting the daughter."</p>

<p>Stumm gave an order and the great car backed, and, as I looked
round, I saw it turning. Then as it gathered speed it shot forward,
and presently was lost in the shadows. I had got over the first
hurdle.</p>

<p>But there was no time to be lost. Stumm would meet the postman
and would be tearing after me any minute. I took the first turning,
and bucketed along a narrow woodland road. The hard ground would
show very few tracks, I thought, and I hoped the pursuit would
think I had gone on to Schwandorf. But it wouldn’t do to risk
it, and I was determined very soon to get the car off the road,
leave it, and take to the forest. I took out my watch and calculated
I could give myself ten minutes.</p>

<p>I was very nearly caught. Presently I came on a bit of rough
heath, with a slope away from the road and here and there a patch
of black which I took to be a sandpit. Opposite one of these I
slewed the car to the edge, got out, started it again and saw
it pitch head-foremost into the darkness. There was a splash of
water and then silence. Craning over I could see nothing but murk,
and the marks at the lip where the wheels had passed. They would
find my tracks in daylight but scarcely at this time of night.</p>

<p>Then I ran across the road to the forest. I was only just in
time, for the echoes of the splash had hardly died away when I
heard the sound of another car. I lay flat in a hollow below a
tangle of snow-laden brambles and looked between the pine-trees
at the moonlit road. It was Stumm’s car again and to my consternation
it stopped just a little short of the sandpit.</p>

<p>I saw an electric torch flashed, and Stumm himself got out and
examined the tracks on the highway. Thank God, they would be still
there for him to find, but had he tried half a dozen yards on
he would have seen them turn towards the sandpit. If that had
happened he would have beaten the adjacent woods and most certainly
found me. There was a third man in the car, with my hat and coat
on him. That poor devil of a postman had paid dear for his vanity.</p>

<p>They took a long time before they started again, and I was jolly
well relieved when they went scouring down the road. I ran deeper
into the woods till I found a track which—as I judged from the
sky which I saw in a clearing—took me nearly due west. That wasn’t
the direction I wanted, so I bore off at right angles, and presently
struck another road which I crossed in a hurry. After that I got
entangled in some confounded kind of enclosure and had to climb
paling after paling of rough stakes plaited with osiers. Then
came a rise in the ground and I was on a low hill of pines which
seemed to last for miles. All the time I was going at a good pace,
and before I stopped to rest I calculated I had put six miles
between me and the sandpit.</p>

<p>My mind was getting a little more active now; for the first part
of the journey I had simply staggered from impulse to impulse.
These impulses had been uncommon lucky, but I couldn’t go on like
that for ever. <em>Ek sal "n plan maak</em>, says the old Boer
when he gets into trouble, and it was up to me now to make a plan.</p>

<p>As soon as I began to think I saw the desperate business I was
in for. Here was I, with nothing except what I stood up in—including
a coat and cap that weren’t mine—alone in mid-winter in the heart
of South Germany. There was a man behind me looking for my blood,
and soon there would be a hue-and-cry for me up and down the land.
I had heard that the German police were pretty efficient, and
I couldn’t see that I stood the slimmest chance. If they caught
me they would shoot me beyond doubt. I asked myself on what charge,
and answered, "For knocking about a German officer." They couldn’t
have me up for espionage, for as far as I knew they had no evidence.
I was simply a Dutchman that had got riled and had run amok. But
if they cut down a cobbler for laughing at a second lieutenant—which
is what happened at Zabern—I calculated that hanging would be
too good for a man that had broken a colonel’s jaw.</p>

<p>To make things worse my job was not to escape—though that would
have been hard enough—but to get to Constantinople, more than
a thousand miles off, and I reckoned I couldn’t get there as a
tramp. I had to be sent there, and now I had flung away my chance.
If I had been a Catholic I would have said a prayer to St Teresa,
for she would have understood my troubles.</p>

<p>My mother used to say that when you felt down on your luck it
was a good cure to count your mercies. So I set about counting
mine. The first was that I was well started on my journey, for
I couldn’t be above two score miles from the Danube. The second
was that I had Stumm’s pass. I didn’t see how I could use it,
but there it was. Lastly I had plenty of money—fifty-three English
sovereigns and the equivalent of three pounds in German paper
which I had changed at the hotel. Also I had squared accounts
with old Stumm. That was the biggest mercy of all.</p>

<p>I thought I’d better get some sleep, so I found a dryish hole
below an oak root and squeezed myself into it. The snow lay deep
in these woods and I was sopping wet up to the knees. All the
same I managed to sleep for some hours, and got up and shook myself
just as the winter’s dawn was breaking through the tree tops.
Breakfast was the next thing, and I must find some sort of dwelling.</p>

<p>Almost at once I struck a road, a big highway running north and
south. I trotted along in the bitter morning to get my circulation
started, and presently I began to feel a little better. In a little
I saw a church spire, which meant a village. Stumm wouldn’t be
likely to have got on my tracks yet, I calculated, but there was
always the chance that he had warned all the villages round by
telephone and that they might be on the look-out for me. But that
risk had to be taken, for I must have food.</p>

<p>It was the day before Christmas, I remembered, and people would
be holidaying. The village was quite a big place, but at this
hour—just after eight o’clock—there was nobody in the street except
a wandering dog. I chose the most unassuming shop I could find,
where a little boy was taking down the shutters—one of those general
stores where they sell everything. The boy fetched a very old
woman, who hobbled in from the back, fitting on her spectacles.</p>

<p>"Gruss Gott," she said in a friendly voice, and I took off my
cap. I saw from my reflection in a saucepan that I looked moderately
respectable in spite of my night in the woods.</p>

<p>I told her the story of how I was walking from Schwandorf to
see my mother at an imaginary place called Judenfeld, banking
on the ignorance of villagers about any place five miles from
their homes. I said my luggage had gone astray, and I hadn’t time
to wait for it, since my leave was short. The old lady was sympathetic
and unsuspecting. She sold me a pound of chocolate, a box of biscuits,
the better part of a ham, two tins of sardines and a rucksack
to carry them. I also bought some soap, a comb and a cheap razor,
and a small Tourists’ Guide, published by a Leipzig firm. As I
was leaving I saw what seemed like garments hanging up in the
back shop, and turned to have a look at them. They were the kind
of thing that Germans wear on their summer walking tours—long
shooting capes made of a green stuff they call <em>loden</em>.
I bought one, and a green felt hat and an alpenstock to keep it
company. Then wishing the old woman and her belongings a merry
Christmas, I departed and took the shortest cut out of the village.
There were one or two people about now, but they did not seem
to notice me.</p>

<p>I went into the woods again and walked for two miles till I halted
for breakfast. I was not feeling quite so fit now, and I did not
make much of my provisions, beyond eating a biscuit and some chocolate.
I felt very thirsty and longed for hot tea. In an icy pool I washed
and with infinite agony shaved my beard. That razor was the worst
of its species, and my eyes were running all the time with the
pain of the operation. Then I took off the postman’s coat and
cap, and buried them below some bushes. I was now a clean-shaven
German pedestrian with a green cape and hat, and an absurd walking-stick
with an iron-shod end—the sort of person who roams in thousands
over the Fatherland in summer, but is a rarish bird in mid-winter.</p>

<p>The Tourists’ Guide was a fortunate purchase, for it contained
a big map of Bavaria which gave me my bearings. I was certainly
not forty miles from the Danube—more like thirty. The road through
the village I had left would have taken me to it. I had only to
walk due south and I would reach it before night. So far as I
could make out there were long tongues of forest running down
to the river, and I resolved to keep to the woodlands. At the
worst I would meet a forester or two, and I had a good enough
story for them. On the highroad there might be awkward questions.</p>

<p>When I started out again I felt very stiff and the cold seemed
to be growing intense. This puzzled me, for I had not minded it
much up to now, and, being warm-blooded by nature, it never used
to worry me. A sharp winter night on the high-veld was a long
sight chillier than anything I had struck so far in Europe. But
now my teeth were chattering and the marrow seemed to be freezing
in my bones.</p>

<p>The day had started bright and clear, but a wrack of grey clouds
soon covered the sky, and a wind from the east began to whistle.
As I stumbled along through the snowy undergrowth I kept longing
for bright warm places. I thought of those long days on the veld
when the earth was like a great yellow bowl, with white roads
running to the horizon and a tiny white farm basking in the heart
of it, with its blue dam and patches of bright green lucerne.
I thought of those baking days on the east coast, when the sea
was like mother-of-pearl and the sky one burning turquoise. But
most of all I thought of warm scented noons on trek, when one
dozed in the shadow of the wagon and sniffed the wood-smoke from
the fire where the boys were cooking dinner.</p>

<p>From these pleasant pictures I returned to the beastly present—the
thick snowy woods, the lowering sky, wet clothes, a hunted present,
and a dismal future. I felt miserably depressed, and I couldn’t
think of any mercies to count. It struck me that I might be falling
sick.</p>

<p>About midday I awoke with a start to the belief that I was being
pursued. I cannot explain how or why the feeling came, except
that it is a kind of instinct that men get who have lived much
in wild countries. My senses, which had been numbed, suddenly
grew keen, and my brain began to work double quick.</p>

<p>I asked myself what I would do if I were Stumm, with hatred in
my heart, a broken jaw to avenge, and pretty well limitless powers.
He must have found the car in the sandpit and seen my tracks in
the wood opposite. I didn’t know how good he and his men might
be at following a spoor, but I knew that any ordinary Kaffir could
have nosed it out easily. But he didn’t need to do that. This
was a civilized country full of roads and railways. I must some
time and somewhere come out of the woods. He could have all the
roads watched, and the telephone would set everyone on my track
within a radius of fifty miles. Besides, he would soon pick up
my trail in the village I had visited that morning. From the map
I learned that it was called Greif, and it was likely to live
up to that name with me.</p>

<p>Presently I came to a rocky knoll which rose out of the forest.
Keeping well in shelter I climbed to the top and cautiously looked
around me. Away to the east I saw the vale of a river with broad
fields and church-spires. West and south the forest rolled unbroken
in a wilderness of snowy tree-tops. There was no sign of life
anywhere, not even a bird, but I knew very well that behind me
in the woods were men moving swiftly on my track, and that it
was pretty well impossible for me to get away.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to go on till I dropped or was taken.
I shaped my course south with a shade of west in it, for the map
showed me that in that direction I would soonest strike the Danube.
What I was going to do when I got there I didn’t trouble to think.
I had fixed the river as my immediate goal and the future must
take care of itself.</p>

<p>I was now certain that I had fever on me. It was still in my
bones, as a legacy from Africa, and had come out once or twice
when I was with the battalion in Hampshire. The bouts had been
short for I had known of their coming and dosed myself. But now
I had no quinine, and it looked as if I were in for a heavy go.
It made me feel desperately wretched and stupid, and I all but
blundered into capture.</p>

<p>For suddenly I came on a road and was going to cross it blindly,
when a man rode slowly past on a bicycle. Luckily I was in the
shade of a clump of hollies and he was not looking my way, though
he was not three yards off. I crawled forward to reconnoitre.
I saw about half a mile of road running straight through the forest
and every two hundred yards was a bicyclist. They wore uniform
and appeared to be acting as sentries.</p>

<p>This could only have one meaning. Stumm had picketed all the
roads and cut me off in an angle of the woods. There was no chance
of getting across unobserved. As I lay there with my heart sinking,
I had the horrible feeling that the pursuit might be following
me from behind, and that at any moment I would be enclosed between
two fires.</p>

<p>For more than an hour I stayed there with my chin in the snow.
I didn’t see any way out, and I was feeling so ill that I didn’t
seem to care. Then my chance came suddenly out of the skies.</p>

<p>The wind rose, and a great gust of snow blew from the east. In
five minutes it was so thick that I couldn’t see across the road.
At first I thought it a new addition to my troubles, and then
very slowly I saw the opportunity. I slipped down the bank and
made ready to cross.</p>

<p>I almost blundered into one of the bicyclists. He cried out and
fell off his machine, but I didn’t wait to investigate. A sudden
access of strength came to me and I darted into the woods on the
farther side. I knew I would be soon swallowed from sight in the
drift, and I knew that the falling snow would hide my tracks.
So I put my best foot forward.</p>

<p>I must have run miles before the hot fit passed, and I stopped
from sheer bodily weakness. There was no sound except the crush
of falling snow, the wind seemed to have gone, and the place was
very solemn and quiet. But Heavens! how the snow fell! It was
partly screened by the branches, but all the same it was piling
itself up deep everywhere. My legs seemed made of lead, my head
burned, and there were fiery pains over all my body. I stumbled
on blindly, without a notion of any direction, determined only
to keep going to the last. For I knew that if I once lay down
I would never rise again.</p>

<p>When I was a boy I was fond of fairy tales, and most of the stories
I remembered had been about great German forests and snow and
charcoal burners and woodmen’s huts. Once I had longed to see
these things, and now I was fairly in the thick of them. There
had been wolves, too, and I wondered idly if I should fall in
with a pack. I felt myself getting light-headed. I fell repeatedly
and laughed sillily every time. Once I dropped into a hole and
lay for some time at the bottom giggling. If anyone had found
me then he would have taken me for a madman.</p>

<p>The twilight of the forest grew dimmer, but I scarcely noticed
it. Evening was falling, and soon it would be night, a night without
morning for me. My body was going on without the direction of
my brain, for my mind was filled with craziness. I was like a
drunk man who keeps running, for he knows that if he stops he
will fall, and I had a sort of bet with myself not to lie down—not
at any rate just yet. If I lay down I should feel the pain in
my head worse. Once I had ridden for five days down country with
fever on me and the flat bush trees had seemed to melt into one
big mirage and dance quadrilles before my eyes. But then I had
more or less kept my wits. Now I was fairly daft, and every minute
growing dafter.</p>

<p>Then the trees seemed to stop and I was walking on flat ground.
It was a clearing, and before me twinkled a little light. The
change restored me to consciousness, and suddenly I felt with
horrid intensity the fire in my head and bones and the weakness
of my limbs. I longed to sleep, and I had a notion that a place
to sleep was before me. I moved towards the light and presently
saw through a screen of snow the outline of a cottage.</p>

<p>I had no fear, only an intolerable longing to lie down. Very
slowly I made my way to the door and knocked. My weakness was
so great that I could hardly lift my hand.</p>

<p>There were voices within, and a corner of the curtain was lifted
from the window. Then the door opened and a woman stood before
me, a woman with a thin, kindly face.</p>

<p>"Gruss Gott," she said, while children peeped from behind her
skirts.</p>

<p>"Gruss Gott," I replied. I leaned against the door-post, and
speech forsook me.</p>

<p>She saw my condition. "Come in, sir," she said. "You are sick
and it is no weather for a sick man."</p>

<p>I stumbled after her and stood dripping in the centre of the
little kitchen, while three wondering children stared at me. It
was a poor place, scantily furnished, but a good log-fire burned
on the hearth. The shock of warmth gave me one of those minutes
of self-possession which comes sometimes in the middle of a fever.</p>

<p>"I am sick, mother, and I have walked far in the storm and lost
my way. I am from Africa, where the climate is hot, and your cold
brings me fever. It will pass in a day or two if you can give
me a bed."</p>

<p>"You are welcome," she said; "but first I will make you coffee."</p>

<p>I took off my dripping cloak, and crouched close to the hearth.
She gave me coffee—poor washy stuff, but blessedly hot. Poverty
was spelled large in everything I saw. I felt the tides of fever
beginning to overflow my brain again, and I made a great attempt
to set my affairs straight before I was overtaken. With difficulty
I took out Stumm’s pass from my pocket-book.</p>

<p>"That is my warrant," I said. "I am a member of the Imperial
Secret Service and for the sake of my work I must move in the
dark. If you will permit it, mother, I will sleep till I am better,
but no one must know that I am here. If anyone comes, you must
deny my presence."</p>

<p>She looked at the big seal as if it were a talisman.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," she said, "you will have the bed in the garret and
be left in peace till you are well. We have no neighbours near,
and the storm will shut the roads. I will be silent, I and the
little ones."</p>

<p>My head was beginning to swim, but I made one more effort.</p>

<p>"There is food in my rucksack—biscuits and ham and chocolate.
Pray take it for your use. And here is some money to buy Christmas
fare for the little ones." And I gave her some of the German notes.</p>

<p>After that my recollection becomes dim. She helped me up a ladder
to the garret, undressed me, and gave me a thick coarse nightgown.
I seem to remember that she kissed my hand, and that she was crying.
"The good Lord has sent you," she said. "Now the little ones will
have their prayers answered and the Christkind will not pass by
our door."</p>
