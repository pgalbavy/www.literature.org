<p>The sun rose to see the forces of Ja-don still held at the palace gate.
The old warrior had seized the tall structure that stood just beyond
the palace and at the summit of this he kept a warrior stationed to
look toward the northern wall of the palace where Ta-den was to make
his attack; but as the minutes wore into hours no sign of the other
force appeared, and now in the full light of the new sun upon the roof
of one of the palace buildings appeared Lu-don, the high priest,
Mo-sar, the pretender, and the strange, naked figure of a man, into
whose long hair and beard were woven fresh ferns and flowers. Behind
them were banked a score of lesser priests who chanted in unison: "This
is Jad-ben-Otho. Lay down your arms and surrender." This they repeated
again and again, alternating it with the cry: "The false Dor-ul-Otho is
a prisoner."
</p>
<p>In one of those lulls which are common in battles between forces armed
with weapons that require great physical effort in their use, a voice
suddenly arose from among the followers of Ja-don: "Show us the
Dor-ul-Otho. We do not believe you!"
</p><p>"Wait," cried Lu-don. "If I do not produce him before the sun has moved
his own width, the gates of the palace shall be opened to you and my
warriors will lay down their arms."
</p><p>He turned to one of his priests and issued brief instructions.
</p><p>The ape-man paced the confines of his narrow cell. Bitterly he
reproached himself for the stupidity which had led him into this trap,
and yet was it stupidity? What else might he have done other than rush
to the succor of his mate? He wondered how they had stolen her from
Ja-lur, and then suddenly there flashed to his mind the features of the
warrior whom he had just seen with her. They were strangely familiar.
He racked his brain to recall where he had seen the man before and then
it came to him. He was the strange warrior who had joined Ja-don's
forces outside of Ja-lur the day that Tarzan had ridden upon the great
GRYF from the uninhabited gorge next to the Kor-ul-JA down to the
capital city of the chieftain of the north. But who could the man be?
Tarzan knew that never before that other day had he seen him.
</p><p>Presently he heard the clanging of a gong from the corridor without and
very faintly the rush of feet, and shouts. He guessed that his warriors
had been discovered and a fight was in progress. He fretted and chafed
at the chance that had denied him participation in it.
</p><p>Again and again he tried the doors of his prison and the trap in the
center of the floor, but none would give to his utmost endeavors. He
strained his eyes toward the aperture above but he could see nothing,
and then he continued his futile pacing to and fro like a caged lion
behind its bars.
</p><p>The minutes dragged slowly into hours. Faintly sounds came to him as of
shouting men at a great distance. The battle was in progress. He
wondered if Ja-don would be victorious and should he be, would his
friends ever discover him in this hidden chamber in the bowels of the
hill? He doubted it.
</p><p>And now as he looked again toward the aperture in the roof there
appeared to be something depending through its center. He came closer
and strained his eyes to see. Yes, there was something there. It
appeared to be a rope. Tarzan wondered if it had been there all the
time. It must have, he reasoned, since he had heard no sound from above
and it was so dark within the chamber that he might easily have
overlooked it.
</p><p>He raised his hand toward it. The end of it was just within his reach.
He bore his weight upon it to see if it would hold him. Then he
released it and backed away, still watching it, as you have seen an
animal do after investigating some unfamiliar object, one of the little
traits that differentiated Tarzan from other men, accentuating his
similarity to the savage beasts of his native jungle. Again and again
he touched and tested the braided leather rope, and always he listened
for any warning sound from above.
</p><p>He was very careful not to step upon the trap at any time and when
finally he bore all his weight upon the rope and took his feet from the
floor he spread them wide apart so that if he fell he would fall
astride the trap. The rope held him. There was no sound from above, nor
any from the trap below.
</p><p>Slowly and cautiously he drew himself upward, hand over hand.  Nearer
and nearer the roof he came. In a moment his eyes would be above the
level of the floor above. Already his extended arms projected into the
upper chamber and then something closed suddenly upon both his
forearms, pinioning them tightly and leaving him hanging in mid-air
unable to advance or retreat.
</p><p>Immediately a light appeared in the room above him and presently he saw
the hideous mask of a priest peering down upon him. In the priest's
hands were leathern thongs and these he tied about Tarzan's wrists and
forearms until they were completely bound together from his elbows
almost to his fingers. Behind this priest Tarzan presently saw others
and soon several lay hold of him and pulled him up through the hole.
</p><p>Almost instantly his eyes were above the level of the floor he
understood how they had trapped him. Two nooses had lain encircling the
aperture into the cell below. A priest had waited at the end of each of
these ropes and at opposite sides of the chamber. When he had climbed
to a sufficient height upon the rope that had dangled into his prison
below and his arms were well within the encircling snares the two
priests had pulled quickly upon their ropes and he had been made an
easy captive without any opportunity of defending himself or inflicting
injury upon his captors.
</p><p>And now they bound his legs from his ankles to his knees and picking
him up carried him from the chamber. No word did they speak to him as
they bore him upward to the temple yard.
</p><p>The din of battle had risen again as Ja-don had urged his forces to
renewed efforts. Ta-den had not arrived and the forces of the old
chieftain were revealing in their lessened efforts their increasing
demoralization, and then it was that the priests carried
Tarzan-jad-guru to the roof of the palace and exhibited him in the
sight of the warriors of both factions.
</p><p>"Here is the false Dor-ul-Otho," screamed Lu-don.
</p><p>Obergatz, his shattered mentality having never grasped fully the
meaning of much that was going on about him, cast a casual glance at
the bound and helpless prisoner, and as his eyes fell upon the noble
features of the ape-man, they went wide in astonishment and fright, and
his pasty countenance turned a sickly blue. Once before had he seen
Tarzan of the Apes, but many times had he dreamed that he had seen him
and always was the giant ape-man avenging the wrongs that had been
committed upon him and his by the ruthless hands of the three German
officers who had led their native troops in the ravishing of Tarzan's
peaceful home.  Hauptmann Fritz Schneider had paid the penalty of his
needless cruelties; Unter-lieutenant von Goss, too, had paid; and now
Obergatz, the last of the three, stood face to face with the Nemesis
that had trailed him through his dreams for long, weary months. That he
was bound and helpless lessened not the German's terror--he seemed not
to realize that the man could not harm him.  He but stood cringing and
jibbering and Lu-don saw and was filled with apprehension that others
might see and seeing realize that this bewhiskered idiot was no
god--that of the two Tarzan-jad-guru was the more godly figure. Already
the high priest noted that some of the palace warriors standing near
were whispering together and pointing. He stepped closer to Obergatz.
"You are Jad-ben-Otho," he whispered, "denounce him!"
</p><p>The German shook himself. His mind cleared of all but his great terror
and the words of the high priest gave him the clue to safety.
</p><p>"I am Jad-ben-Otho!" he screamed.
</p><p>Tarzan looked him straight in the eye. "You are Lieutenant Obergatz of
the German Army," he said in excellent German. "You are the last of the
three I have sought so long and in your putrid heart you know that God
has not brought us together at last for nothing."
</p><p>The mind of Lieutenant Obergatz was functioning clearly and rapidly at
last. He too saw the questioning looks upon the faces of some of those
around them. He saw the opposing warriors of both cities standing by
the gate inactive, every eye turned upon him, and the trussed figure of
the ape-man. He realized that indecision now meant ruin, and ruin,
death. He raised his voice in the sharp barking tones of a Prussian
officer, so unlike his former maniacal screaming as to quickly arouse
the attention of every ear and to cause an expression of puzzlement to
cross the crafty face of Lu-don.
</p><p>"I am Jad-ben-Otho," snapped Obergatz. "This creature is no son of
mine. As a lesson to all blasphemers he shall die upon the altar at the
hand of the god he has profaned. Take him from my sight, and when the
sun stands at zenith let the faithful congregate in the temple court
and witness the wrath of this divine hand," and he held aloft his right
palm.
</p><p>Those who had brought Tarzan took him away then as Obergatz had
directed, and the German turned once more to the warriors by the gate.
"Throw down your arms, warriors of Ja-don," he cried, "lest I call down
my lightnings to blast you where you stand. Those who do as I bid shall
be forgiven. Come! Throw down your arms."
</p><p>The warriors of Ja-don moved uneasily, casting looks of appeal at their
leader and of apprehension toward the figures upon the palace roof.
Ja-don sprang forward among his men. "Let the cowards and knaves throw
down their arms and enter the palace," he cried, "but never will Ja-don
and the warriors of Ja-lur touch their foreheads to the feet of Lu-don
and his false god. Make your decision now," he cried to his followers.
</p><p>A few threw down their arms and with sheepish looks passed through the
gateway into the palace, and with the example of these to bolster their
courage others joined in the desertion from the old chieftain of the
north, but staunch and true around him stood the majority of his
warriors and when the last weakling had left their ranks Ja-don voiced
the savage cry with which he led his followers to the attack, and once
again the battle raged about the palace gate.
</p><p>At times Ja-don's forces pushed the defenders far into the palace
ground and then the wave of combat would recede and pass out into the
city again. And still Ta-den and the reinforcements did not come. It
was drawing close to noon. Lu-don had mustered every available man that
was not actually needed for the defense of the gate within the temple,
and these he sent, under the leadership of Pan-sat, out into the city
through the secret passageway and there they fell upon Ja-don's forces
from the rear while those at the gate hammered them in front.
</p><p>Attacked on two sides by a vastly superior force the result was
inevitable and finally the last remnant of Ja-don's little army
capitulated and the old chief was taken a prisoner before Lu-don. "Take
him to the temple court," cried the high priest. "He shall witness the
death of his accomplice and perhaps Jad-ben-Otho shall pass a similar
sentence upon him as well."
</p><p>The inner temple court was packed with humanity. At either end of the
western altar stood Tarzan and his mate, bound and helpless. The sounds
of battle had ceased and presently the ape-man saw Ja-don being led
into the inner court, his wrists bound tightly together before him.
Tarzan turned his eyes toward Jane and nodded in the direction of
Ja-don. "This looks like the end," he said quietly. "He was our last
and only hope."
</p><p>"We have at least found each other, John," she replied, "and our last
days have been spent together. My only prayer now is that if they take
you they do not leave me."
</p><p>Tarzan made no reply for in his heart was the same bitter thought that
her own contained--not the fear that they would kill him but the fear
that they would not kill her. The ape-man strained at his bonds but
they were too many and too strong. A priest near him saw and with a
jeering laugh struck the defenseless ape-man in the face.
</p><p>"The brute!" cried Jane Clayton.
</p><p>Tarzan smiled. "I have been struck thus before, Jane," he said, "and
always has the striker died."
</p><p>"You still have hope?" she asked.
</p><p>"I am still alive," he said as though that were sufficient answer. She
was a woman and she did not have the courage of this man who knew no
fear. In her heart of hearts she knew that he would die upon the altar
at high noon for he had told her, after he had been brought to the
inner court, of the sentence of death that Obergatz had pronounced upon
him, and she knew too that Tarzan knew that he would die, but that he
was too courageous to admit it even to himself.
</p><p>As she looked upon him standing there so straight and wonderful and
brave among his savage captors her heart cried out against the cruelty
of the fate that had overtaken him. It seemed a gross and hideous wrong
that that wonderful creature, now so quick with exuberant life and
strength and purpose should be presently naught but a bleeding lump of
clay--and all so uselessly and wantonly. Gladly would she have offered
her life for his but she knew that it was a waste of words since their
captors would work upon them whatever it was their will to do--for him,
death; for her--she shuddered at the thought.
</p><p>And now came Lu-don and the naked Obergatz, and the high priest led the
German to his place behind the altar, himself standing upon the other's
left. Lu-don whispered a word to Obergatz, at the same time nodding in
the direction of Ja-don. The Hun cast a scowling look upon the old
warrior.
</p><p>"And after the false god," he cried, "the false prophet," and he
pointed an accusing finger at Ja-don. Then his eyes wandered to the
form of Jane Clayton.
</p><p>"And the woman, too?" asked Lu-don.
</p><p>"The case of the woman I will attend to later," replied Obergatz. "I
will talk with her tonight after she has had a chance to meditate upon
the consequences of arousing the wrath of Jad-ben-Otho."
</p><p>He cast his eyes upward at the sun. "The time approaches," he said to
Lu-don. "Prepare the sacrifice."
</p><p>Lu-don nodded to the priests who were gathered about Tarzan. They
seized the ape-man and lifted him bodily to the altar where they laid
him upon his back with his head at the south end of the monolith, but a
few feet from where Jane Clayton stood.  Impulsively and before they
could restrain her the woman rushed forward and bending quickly kissed
her mate upon the forehead.  "Good-bye, John," she whispered.
</p><p>"Good-bye," he answered, smiling.
</p><p>The priests seized her and dragged her away. Lu-don handed the
sacrificial knife to Obergatz. "I am the Great God," cried the German,
"thus falleth the divine wrath upon all my enemies!" He looked up at
the sun and then raised the knife high above his head.
</p><p>"Thus die the blasphemers of God!" he screamed, and at the same instant
a sharp staccato note rang out above the silent, spell-bound multitude.
There was a screaming whistle in the air and Jad-ben-Otho crumpled
forward across the body of his intended victim. Again the same alarming
noise and Lu-don fell, a third and Mo-sar crumpled to the ground. And
now the warriors and the people, locating the direction of this new and
unknown sound turned toward the western end of the court.
</p><p>Upon the summit of the temple wall they saw two figures--a Ho-don
warrior and beside him an almost naked creature of the race of
Tarzan-jad-guru, across his shoulders and about his hips were strange
broad belts studded with beautiful cylinders that glinted in the
mid-day sun, and in his hands a shining thing of wood and metal from
the end of which rose a thin wreath of blue-gray smoke.
</p><p>And then the voice of the Ho-don warrior rang clear upon the ears of
the silent throng. "Thus speaks the true Jad-ben-Otho," he cried,
"through this his Messenger of Death. Cut the bonds of the prisoners.
Cut the bonds of the Dor-ul-Otho and of Ja-don, King of Pal-ul-don, and
of the woman who is the mate of the son of god."
</p><p>Pan-sat, filled with the frenzy of fanaticism saw the power and the
glory of the regime he had served crumpled and gone. To one and only
one did he attribute the blame for the disaster that had but just
overwhelmed him. It was the creature who lay upon the sacrificial altar
who had brought Lu-don to his death and toppled the dreams of power
that day by day had been growing in the brain of the under priest.
</p><p>The sacrificial knife lay upon the altar where it had fallen from the
dead fingers of Obergatz. Pan-sat crept closer and then with a sudden
lunge he reached forth to seize the handle of the blade, and even as
his clutching fingers were poised above it, the strange thing in the
hands of the strange creature upon the temple wall cried out its
crashing word of doom and Pan-sat the under priest, screaming, fell
back upon the dead body of his master.
</p><p>"Seize all the priests," cried Ta-den to the warriors, "and let none
hesitate lest Jad-ben-Otho's messenger send forth still other bolts of
lightning."
</p><p>The warriors and the people had now witnessed such an exhibition of
divine power as might have convinced an even less superstitious and
more enlightened people, and since many of them had but lately wavered
between the Jad-ben-Otho of Lu-don and the Dor-ul-Otho of Ja-don it was
not difficult for them to swing quickly back to the latter, especially
in view of the unanswerable argument in the hands of him whom Ta-den
had described as the Messenger of the Great God.
</p><p>And so the warriors sprang forward now with alacrity and surrounded the
priests, and when they looked again at the western wall of the temple
court they saw pouring over it a great force of warriors. And the thing
that startled and appalled them was the fact that many of these were
black and hairy Waz-don.
</p><p>At their head came the stranger with the shiny weapon and on his right
was Ta-den, the Ho-don, and on his left Om-at, the black gund of
Kor-ul-JA.
</p><p>A warrior near the altar had seized the sacrificial knife and cut
Tarzan's bonds and also those of Ja-don and Jane Clayton, and now the
three stood together beside the altar and as the newcomers from the
western end of the temple court pushed their way toward them the eyes
of the woman went wide in mingled astonishment, incredulity, and hope.
And the stranger, slinging his weapon across his back by a leather
strap, rushed forward and took her in his arms.
</p><p>"Jack!" she cried, sobbing on his shoulder. "Jack, my son!"
</p><p>And Tarzan of the Apes came then and put his arms around them both, and
the King of Pal-ul-don and the warriors and the people kneeled in the
temple court and placed their foreheads to the ground before the altar
where the three stood.
