<p>You will understand that the pursuit of Deerfoot the Shawanoe
was not confined to the two Pawnees, whom he thwarted in the manner
described. Their superior activity simply brought them to the
front and hastened the collision.</p>

<p>It will be seen, therefore, that the incidents must have taken
place in a brief space of time: had it been otherwise, Deerfoot
would have been engaged with the entire party. No one could have
known that better than he. The whoops, signals and reports of
the guns could not fail to tell the whole story, and to cause
the Pawnees to converge toward the spot. In fact, when Deerfoot
lowered his bow and turned his back for the second time on the
warrior, he caught more than one glimpse of other red men hastening
thither.</p>

<p>Dangerous as was the situation of the youth, he did not forget
another incident which was liable to add to the difficulty of
extricating himself. From the moment he began his flight several
of the Pawnees gave utterance to shouts which were clearly meant
as signals. These had been repeated several times, and Deerfoot
could form no suspicion of their full meaning. Had the red men
been Shawanoes, Wyandots or almost any tribe whose hunting grounds
were east of the Mississippi, he would have read their purpose
as readily as could those for whose ears they were intended.</p>

<p>The interpretation, however, came sooner than was expected.</p>

<p>Deerfoot ran a little ways with such swiftness that he left every
one out of sight. Then he slackened his gait, and was going in
a leisurely fashion, when he came upon a narrow creek which ran
at right angles to the course he was following. The current was
swift and deep, and the breadth too great for him to leap over.</p>

<p>He saw that if he ran up or down the bank too far, he was likely
to place himself in peril again. He could have readily swam to
the other side, but preferred some other means, and concluded
to take a minute or two in looking for it.</p>

<p>A whoop to the left and the rear made known that no time was
to be lost. He was about to run in the opposite direction, when
he caught sight of the bridge for which he was hunting. A tree
growing on the opposite side had fallen directly across, so that
the top extended several yards from the shore. The trunk was long,
thin, covered with smooth bark, and with only a few branches near
the top, but it was the very thing the fugitive wanted, and, scarcely
checking his gait, he dashed toward it, heedless of the Pawnees,
a number of whom were in sight.</p>

<p>He slowed his pace when about to step on the support, and placing
one foot on the thin bridge, tested it. So far as he could judge
it was satisfactory, and, balancing himself, he began walking
toward the other shore. Only four steps were taken, when a Pawnee
stepped upon the opposite end, and advanced directly toward the
Shawanoe.</p>

<p>It began to look, after all, as though Deerfoot had presumed
too far on his own prowess, for his enemies were coming fast after
him, and now, while treading the delicate structure, he was brought
face to face with a warrior as formidable as Lone Bear or Eagle-of-the-Rocks.</p>

<p>But there was no time to hesitate. The Pawnee had caught the
signals from the other side of the stream, and hurried forward
to intercept the enemy making his way in that direction. He advanced
far enough from the spreading base of the tree to render his foothold
firm, when he braced himself with drawn knife, to receive the
youth. He had flung his blanket and rifle aside, before stepping
on the trunk, so as not to be hindered in his movements.</p>

<p>His painted face seemed to gleam with exultation, for, if ever
a man was justified in believing he had a sure thing it was that
Pawnee warrior, and if ever a person made a mistake that Pawnee
warrior was the individual.</p>

<p>[Illustration: A <em>DISPUTED POINT</em>.]</p>

<p>Instead of turning back Deerfoot drew his knife, and grasped
it with his right hand, as though he meant to engage the other
in conflict where both had such unsteady footing. Had the young
Shawanoe held such a purpose, his left hand, but the Pawnee, having
never seen him before, could not know that, and he was confident
that the slaying of the youth was the easiest task he could undertake.</p>

<p>Deerfoot not only continued his advance, but broke into a trot
composed of short, quick steps, such as a leaper takes when gathering
on the edge of a cliff for his final effort. He still held his
bow in his left and his knife in his right hand, and tightly closing
his lips, looked into the eyes of the Pawnee.</p>

<p>Just as the latter drew back his weapon with the intention of
making the decisive blow, and when two paces only separated the
enemies, the Shawanoe dropped his head and drove it with terrific
force against the chest of the Pawnee. The latter was carried
off the log as completely as if he had been smitten with a battering
ram.</p>

<p>He went over with feet pointing upward, and dropped with a splash
into the stream. The blow was so violent indeed that the breath
was knocked from him, and he emitted a grunt as he toppled off
the support. As he disappeared, Deerfoot, too, lost his balance,
but he was so close to land, that he leaped clear of the water.
Then, as if he thought the Pawnee might need his blanket and rifle,
he picked them up and tossed them into the stream after him.</p>

<p>Incidents followed each other with a rush, and the report of
two guns in quick succession reminded the youth that it would
not do to linger any longer in the vicinity; but assured now of
the meaning of the signals which he had heard, he scanned the
woods in front, as much as he did those in the rear. It was well
he did so.</p>

<p>By calling into play his magnificent fleetness, he rapidly increased
the distance between him and his enemies, but was scarcely able
to pass beyond their sight, before, to his astonishment, he found
he was confronted by two other warriors, coming from the opposite
direction. They were doubtless on a hunt when signaled by the
large party to intercept an enemy fleeing from them.</p>

<p>It began to look to Deerfoot as though he had struck either a
settlement of Pawnees, or a very large war party, for, beyond
question, the "woods were full of them". To have continued straight
on would have brought about an encounter with the two, and there
was too much risk in that, though from what the reader learned
long ago of Deerfoot, it is unnecessary to say that he would not
have hesitated to make such a fight, had there been a call to
do so.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, the red men were firing off their guns too rapidly
to allow the fugitive to feel comfortable. Thus far, although
he had swept his foes from his path, as may be said, he had refrained
from slaying any one. He would not take life unless necessary,
but he began to doubt whether he had acted wisely in showing mercy.
Had he pierced two or three of his foes through and through, the
others would not have been so enthusiastic in pursuing him across
stream and through wood.</p>

<p>At any rate, he decided to be more resolute, and when necessary,
drive a shaft "home".</p>

<p>The moment he observed the two Pawnees advancing from a point
in front, he made another change in his course. This time it was
to the right, and again he put forth a burst of speed the like
of which his enemies had never seen. He passed in and out among
the trees, and through the undergrowth, with such bewildering
swiftness, that, though he was within gunshot, neither would risk
firing, where it was more difficult to take aim than at the bird
darting through the tree tops.</p>

<p>The last act of the fugitive had, as he believed, thrown all
his pursuers well to the rear. When he made the turn, the two
whom he last encountered tried to head him off by cutting across,
as it may be called, but they relinquished the effort when they
saw how useless it was.</p>

<p>Thus far, though Deerfoot had been placed in situations of great
danger, he had managed to free himself without any effort that
could be deemed unusual for him, though it would have been remarkable
had it been performed by any one else. But now, when it began
to look as if the worst were over, he was made aware that the
most serious crisis of all had come.</p>

<p>At the moment when he began to lessen his speed, simply because
the intervening limbs annoyed him, he made the discovery that
still more of the Pawnees were in front. He caught the glimmer
of their dress between the trees scarcely, more than a hundred
yards in advance, and, instead of one or two, there were at least
five who were drawing near.</p>

<p>These were what may be called strangers, since they and Deerfoot
now saw each other for the first time. Had they known the exact
circumstances, they would have kept out of sight until the fugitive
had run, as may be said, into their arms; but, like the rest,
they were moving toward the camp, in obedience to the signals,
keeping a lookout at the same time for the enemy that they knew
was somewhere in the neighborhood. The reason they had not put
in an earlier appearance was because they were further off than
the rest.</p>

<p>At the moment Deerfoot observed them, he was not far off from
the winding stream over which he had passed on the fallen tree.
Like a flash, he turned about and ran with his own extraordinary
fleetness, directly over his own trail.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the peril of this course reached almost
a fatal degree, for the other Pawnees could not be far off, and
a very brief run would take him in full sight of them.</p>

<p>The last comers showed more vigor than the others. The glimpse
they caught of the strange warrior dashing toward them, told the
whole truth. The sight of a man running at full speed with a whooping
mob a short distance behind, is all the evidence needed to prove
he is a fugitive. Besides, when the Pawnees bore down on Deerfoot
they knew far more of the neighborhood than he, and were sure
he was entrapped.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Shawanoe was to put forth his utmost swiftness,
hoping to place himself, if only for part of a minute, beyond
sight of his enemies. Though he made the closest kind of calculation,
circumstances were against him, and he not only failed to disappear
from the last two, but, short as was the distance he doubled on
his own trail, it took him into the field of vision of the parties
whom he had eluded but a few minutes before. So it came about
that he was in full view of a number of enemies, rapidly converging
toward him, while a deep, swift stream was flowing across his
line of flight.</p>

<p>The success of the pursuers now looked so certain that their
leader emitted several whoops, a couple of which were meant as
a command for none to fire: the Shawanoe was cornered and they
meant to make him prisoner.</p>

<p>It need not be said that under the worst conditions the capture
of the young warrior would have been no easy matter. He could
fight like a tiger when driven into corner, and his great quickness
availed him against superior strength. He had bounded out of more
desperate situations than any person of double his years, and,
knowing that no mercy was to be expected from the warlike Pawnees,
it must have been a strange conjunction of disasters that could
compel him to throw up his hands and yield.</p>

<p>Deerfoot had crossed one stream on his way to the Pawnee camp,
and it was no task to swim one of double the width; but the skillful
swimmer can advance only at a slow rate through the water, and,
before he could reach the other shore, a half dozen Pawnees would
be on the bank in the rear, waiting for him to reappear. He was
a master of the natatorial art, but he was not amphibious, and
soon would have to come to the surface or die. The watchers would
be quick to detect him, and their position was so much the superior
of the fugitive that his capture was inevitable.</p>

<p>Suddenly Deerfoot seemed to see that there was but the one thing
to do; turning again, he faced the stream which was but a few
rods distant, and ran toward it. The undergrowth was abundant,
but his head and shoulders were seen, as under the swift doublings
of his limbs, they shot forward as if borne on the back of an
invisible express engine.</p>

<p>The thrilling run lasted but a second or two; then, having reached
the margin of the stream, the fugitive was seen to gather himself
and rise like a bird on the wing. He had made a prodigious leap
toward the other shore.</p>

<p>The Pawnees uttered several cries of exultation, for no doubt
remained of their success. For one instant the figure was suspended
in mid air, and then it descended. The pursuers heard the loud
splash, and were on the spot before the most skillful swimmer
could have taken three strokes or forced his body an arm's length
through the water.</p>

<p>The leading Pawnee saw the ripples made in the swift current
by the Shawanoe, whose body was out of sight, for he had not been
given time in which to rise. As the current was too powerful to
permit any one to swim against it (besides which such an expenditure
of strength could gain nothing), it followed that the youth must
either come up near the spot where he went down, or some distance
below it.</p>

<p>The supposition would be that, helped by the momentum of his
own body, Deerfoot would aim for the other shore. Fearful of attempting
to climb the opposite bank with a half dozen standing just behind
him with loaded guns, he would try to keep out of sight by thrusting
just the point of his nose above the water, so as to gain a breath
of the indispensable air.</p>

<p>But two facts rendered this impossible. In the first place, the
water was remarkably clear, so that a body only a fractional part
of the size of the youth, could not come within a foot of the
surface without being seen. Besides, the vegetation on the other
side did not overhang the current (as it did in one or two instances
which perhaps my readers will recall), so nothing there could
serve to screen such a movement. A third obstacle to such strategy
may be mentioned: the stream along shore was shallow, while with
the two conditions first mentioned in his favor, water to permit
the most absolute freedom of movement was indispensable. Enough
has been said, however, to prove that the feat was beyond the
reach even of such a marvel as Deerfoot the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>The leader of the Pawnees repeated his warning against shooting
the fugitive&mdash;that is, against killing him. If there seemed to
be danger of his getting away, they were to fire so as to disable
without slaying him. It would be an easy matter to bring him down
without endangering his life.</p>

<p>As if to shut out all hope for the Shawanoe, three of the warriors
who seemed to be wandering everywhere through the woods appeared
at this moment on the other shore. They were given to understand
the situation, and joined the parties that waited for the reappearance
of the youth, who seemed to have disported himself like a very
demon since coming into that vicinity.</p>

<p>The Pawnees were so distributed along the bank that the very
instant a swimmer should approach the surface from below, he would
be observed by several spectators. And thus stood and waited the
swarthy warriors for the sight which was never to come to them.</p>
