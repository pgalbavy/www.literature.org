<p>There were no further excitements that night. I had breakfast in
bed and got up late the next morning. Mrs. Blair hailed me as I
came on deck.
</p>
<p>“Good-morning, Gipsy girl, sit down here by me. You look as though
you hadn’t slept well.”
</p><p>“Why do you call me that?” I asked, as I sat down obediently.
</p><p>“Do you mind? It suits you somehow. I’ve called you that in my own
mind from the beginning. It’s the gipsy element in you that makes
you so different from any one else. I decided in my own mind that
you and Colonel Race were the only two people on board who wouldn’t
bore me to death to talk to.”
</p><p>“That’s funny,” I said, “I thought the same about you—only it’s
more understandable in your case. You’re—you’re such an exquisitely
finished product.”
</p><p>“Not badly put,” said Mrs. Blair, nodding her head. “Tell me all
about yourself, Gipsy girl. Why are you going to South Africa?”
</p><p>I told her something about Papa’s life work.
</p><p>“So you’re Charles Beddingfeld’s daughter? I thought you weren’t
a mere provincial Miss! Are you going to Broken Hill to grub up
more skulls?”
</p><p>“I may,” I said cautiously. “I’ve got other plans as well.”
</p><p>“What a mysterious minx you are. But you do look tired this morning.
Didn’t you sleep well? I can’t keep awake on board a boat. Ten
hours’ sleep for a fool, they say! I could do with twenty!”
</p><p>She yawned, looking like a sleepy kitten. “An idiot of a steward
woke me up in the middle of the night to return me that roll of
films I dropped yesterday. He did it in the most melodramatic
manner, stuck his arm through the ventilator and dropped them
nearly in the middle of my tummy. I thought it was a bomb for a
moment!”
</p><p>“Here’s your Colonel,” I said, as the tall soldierly figure of
Colonel Race appeared on the deck.
</p><p>“He’s not my Colonel particularly. In fact he admires <u>you</u> very
much, Gipsy girl. So don’t run away.”
</p><p>“I want to tie something round my head. It will be more comfortable
than a hat.”
</p><p>I slipped quickly away. For some reason or other I was uncomfortable
with Colonel Race. He was one of the few people who were capable
of making me feel shy.
</p><p>I went down to my cabin and began looking for a broad band of
ribbon, or a motor-veil, with which I could restrain my rebellious
locks. Now I am a tidy person, I like my things always arranged in
a certain way and I keep them so. I had no sooner opened my drawer
than I realized that somebody had been disarranging my things.
Everything had been turned over and scattered. I looked in the
other drawers and the small hanging cupboard. They told me the same
tale. It was as though some one had been making a hurried and
ineffectual search for something.
</p><p>I sat down on the edge of the bunk with a grave face. Who had been
searching my cabin and what had they been looking for? Was it the
half-sheet of paper with scribbled figures and words? I shook my
head, dissatisfied. Surely that was past history now. But what else
could there be?
</p><p>I wanted to think. The events of last night, though exciting, had
not really done anything to elucidate matters. Who was the young
man who had burst into my cabin so abruptly? I had not seen him on
board previously, either on deck or in the saloon. Was he one of
the ship’s company or was he a passenger? Who had stabbed him? Why
had they stabbed him? And why, in the name of goodness, should
Cabin No. 17 figure so prominently? It was all a mystery, but there
was no doubt that some very peculiar occurrences were taking place
on the <u>Kilmorden Castle.</u>
</p><p>I counted off on my fingers the people on whom it behoved me to
keep a watch.
</p><p>Setting aside my visitor of the night before, but promising myself
that I would discover him on board before another day had passed,
I selected the following persons as worthy of my notice.
</p><p>(1) Sir Eustace Pedler. He was the owner of the Mill House and his
presence on the <u>Kilmorden Castle</u> seemed something of a coincidence.
</p><p>(2) Mr. Pagett, the sinister-looking secretary, whose eagerness to
obtain Cabin 17 had been so very marked. N.B. Find out whether he
had accompanied Sir Eustace to Cannes.
</p><p>(3) The Rev. Edward Chichester. All I had against him was his
obstinacy over Cabin 17, and that might be entirely due to his own
peculiar temperament. Obstinacy can be an amazing thing.
</p><p>But a little conversation with Mr. Chichester would not come amiss,
I decided. Hastily tying a handkerchief round my rebellious locks,
I went up on deck again, full of purpose. I was in luck. My quarry
was leaning against the rail, drinking beef tea. I went up to him.
</p><p>“I hope you’ve forgiven me over Cabin 17,” I said, with my best
smile.
</p><p>“I consider it unchristian to bear a grudge,” said Mr. Chichester
coldly. “But the purser had distinctly promised me that cabin.”
</p><p>“Pursers are such busy men, aren’t they?” I said vaguely. “I
suppose they’re bound to forget sometimes.”
</p><p>Mr. Chichester did not reply.
</p><p>“Is this your first visit to Africa?” I inquired conversationally.
</p><p>“To South Africa, yes. But I have worked for the last two years
amongst the cannibal tribes in the interior of East Africa.”
</p><p>“How thrilling! Have you had many narrow escapes?”
</p><p>“Escapes?”
</p><p>“Of being eaten, I mean?”
</p><p>“You should not treat sacred subjects with levity, Miss Beddingfeld.”
</p><p>“I didn’t know that cannibalism was a sacred subject,” I retorted,
stung.
</p><p>As the words left my lips, another idea struck me. If Mr. Chichester
had indeed spent the last two years in the interior of Africa, how
was it that he was not more sunburnt? His skin was as pink and
white as a baby’s. Surely there was something fishy there? Yet his
manner and voice were so absolutely <u>it.</u> Too much so perhaps. Was
he—or was he not—just a little like a <u>stage</u> clergyman?
</p><p>I cast my mind back to the curates I had known at Little Hampsly.
Some of them I had liked, some of them I had not, but certainly
none of them had been quite like Mr. Chichester. They had been
human—he was a glorified type.
</p><p>I was debating all this when Sir Eustace Pedler passed down the
deck. Just as he was abreast of Mr. Chichester, he stooped and
picked up a piece of paper which he handed to him, remarking
“You’ve dropped something.”
</p><p>He passed on without stopping, and so probably did not notice Mr.
Chichester’s agitation. I did. Whatever it was he had dropped, its
recovery agitated him considerably. He turned a sickly green, and
crumpled up the sheet of paper into a ball. My suspicions were
accentuated a hundred-fold.
</p><p>He caught my eye, and hurried into explanations.
</p><p>“A—a—fragment of a sermon I was composing,” he said with a sickly
smile.
</p><p>“Indeed?” I rejoined politely.
</p><p>A fragment of a sermon, indeed! No, Mr. Chichester—too weak for
words!
</p><p>He soon left me with a muttered excuse. I wished, oh, how I wished,
that I had been the one to pick up that paper and not Sir Eustace
Pedler! One thing was clear, Mr. Chichester could not be exempted
from my list of suspects. I was inclined to put him top of the
three.
</p><p>After lunch, when I came up to the lounge for coffee, I noticed
Sir Eustace and Pagett sitting with Mrs. Blair and Colonel Race.
Mrs. Blair welcomed me with a smile, so I went over and joined
them. They were talking about Italy.
</p><p>“But it <u>is</u> misleading,” Mrs. Blair insisted. <u>“Aqua calda</u>
certainly <u>ought</u> to be cold water—not hot.”
</p><p>“You’re not a Latin scholar,” said Sir Eustace, smiling.
</p><p>“Men are so superior about their Latin,” said Mrs. Blair. “But all
the same I notice that when you ask them to translate inscriptions
in old churches they can never do it! They hem and haw, and get
out of it somehow.”
</p><p>“Quite right,” said Colonel Race. “I always do.”
</p><p>“But I love the Italians,” continued Mrs. Blair. “They’re so
obliging—though even that has its embarrassing side. You ask them
the way somewhere, and instead of saying ‘first to the right,
second to the left’ or something that one could follow, they pour
out a flood of well-meaning directions, and when you look bewildered
they take you kindly by the arm and walk all the way there with
you.”
</p><p>“Is that your experience in Florence, Pagett?” asked Sir Eustace,
turning with a smile to his secretary.
</p><p>For some reason the question seemed to disconcert Mr. Pagett. He
stammered and flushed.
</p><p>“Oh, quite so, yes—er quite so.”
</p><p>Then with a murmured excuse, he rose and left the table.
</p><p>“I am beginning to suspect Guy Pagett of having committed some dark
deed in Florence,” remarked Sir Eustace, gazing after his
secretary’s retreating figure. “Whenever Florence or Italy is
mentioned, he changes the subject, or bolts precipitately.”
</p><p>“Perhaps he murdered some one there,” said Mrs. Blair hopefully.
“He looks—I hope I’m not hurting your feelings, Sir Eustace—but he
does look as though he might murder some one.”
</p><p>“Yes, pure Cinquecento! It amuses me sometimes—especially when one
knows as well as I do how essentially law-abiding and respectable
the poor fellow really is.”
</p><p>“He’s been with you some time, hasn’t he, Sir Eustace?” asked
Colonel Race.
</p><p>“Six years,” said Sir Eustace, with a deep sigh.
</p><p>“He must be quite invaluable to you,” said Mrs. Blair.
</p><p>“Oh, invaluable! Yes, quite invaluable.” The poor man sounded even
more depressed, as though the invaluableness of Mr. Pagett was a
secret grief to him. Then he added more briskly: “But his face
should really inspire you with confidence, my dear lady. No
self-respecting murderer would ever consent to look like one.
Crippen, now, I believe, was one of the pleasantest fellows
imaginable.”
</p><p>“He was caught on a liner, wasn’t he?” murmured Mrs. Blair.
</p><p>There was a slight rattle behind us. I turned quickly. Mr.
Chichester had dropped his coffee-cup.
</p><p>Our party soon broke up; Mrs. Blair went below to sleep and I went
out on deck. Colonel Race followed me.
</p><p>“You’re very elusive, Miss Beddingfeld. I looked for you everywhere
last night at the dance.”
</p><p>“I went to bed early,” I explained.
</p><p>“Are you going to run away to-night too? Or are you going to dance
with me?”
</p><p>“I shall be very pleased to dance with you,” I murmured shyly. “But
Mrs. Blair——”
</p><p>“Our friend, Mrs. Blair, doesn’t care for dancing.”
</p><p>“And you do?”
</p><p>“I care for dancing with you.”
</p><p>“Oh!” I said nervously.
</p><p>I was a little afraid of Colonel Race. Nevertheless I was enjoying
myself. This was better than discussing fossilized skulls with
stuffy old professors! Colonel Race was really just my ideal of a
stern silent Rhodesian. Possibly I might marry him! I hadn’t been
asked, it is true, but, as the Boy Scouts say, Be Prepared! And
all women, without in the least meaning it, consider every man they
meet as a possible husband for themselves or for their best friend.
</p><p>I danced several times with him that evening. He danced well. When
the dancing was over, and I was thinking of going to bed, he
suggested a turn round the deck. We walked round three times and
finally subsided into two deck-chairs. There was nobody else in
sight. We made desultory conversation for some time.
</p><p>“Do you know, Miss Beddingfeld, I think that I once met your
father? A very interesting man—on his own subject, and it’s a
subject that has a special fascination for me. In my humble way,
I’ve done a bit in that line myself. Why, when I was in the Dordogne
region——”
</p><p>Our talk became technical. Colonel Race’s boast was not an idle
one. He knew a great deal. At the same time, he made one or two
curious mistakes—slips of the tongue, I might almost have thought
them. But he was quick to take his cue from me and to cover them
up. Once he spoke of the Mousterian period as succeeding the
Aurignacian—an absurd mistake for one who knew anything of the
subject.
</p><p>It was twelve o’clock when I went to my cabin. I was still puzzling
over those queer discrepancies. Was it possible that he had “got
the whole subject up” for the occasion—that really he knew nothing
of archaeology? I shook my head, vaguely dissatisfied with that
solution.
</p><p>Just as I was dropping off to sleep, I sat up with a sudden start
as another idea flashed into my head. Had <u>he</u> been pumping <u>me?</u>
Were those slight inaccuracies just tests—to see whether I really
knew what I was talking about? In other words, he suspected me of
not being genuinely Anne Beddingfeld.
</p><p>Why?
