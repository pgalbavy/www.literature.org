<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I collected some baggage and a pile of newly arrived letters
from my rooms in Westminster and took a taxi to my Park Lane flat.
Usually I had gone back to that old place with a great feeling
of comfort, like a boy from school who ranges about his room at
home and examines his treasures. I used to like to see my hunting
trophies on the wall and to sink into my own armchairs But now
I had no pleasure in the thing. I had a bath, and changed into
uniform, and that made me feel in better fighting trim. But I
suffered from a heavy conviction of abject failure, and had no
share in Macgillivray’s optimism. The awe with which the Black
Stone gang had filled me three years before had revived a thousandfold.
Personal humiliation was the least part of my trouble. What worried
me was the sense of being up against something inhumanly formidable
and wise and strong. I believed I was willing to own defeat and
chuck up the game.</p>

<p>Among the unopened letters was one from Peter, a very bulky one
which I sat down to read at leisure. It was a curious epistle,
far the longest he had ever written me, and its size made me understand
his loneliness. He was still at his German prison-camp, but expecting
every day to go to Switzerland. He said he could get back to England
or South Africa, if he wanted, for they were clear that he could
never be a combatant again; but he thought he had better stay
in Switzerland, for he would be unhappy in England with all his
friends fighting. As usual he made no complaints, and seemed to
be very grateful for his small mercies. There was a doctor who
was kind to him, and some good fellows among the prisoners.</p>

<p>But Peter’s letter was made up chiefly of reflection. He had
always been a bit of a philosopher, and now, in his isolation,
he had taken to thinking hard, and poured out the results to me
on pages of thin paper in his clumsy handwriting. I could read
between the lines that he was having a stiff fight with himself.
He was trying to keep his courage going in face of the bitterest
trial he could be called on to face—a crippled old age. He had
always known a good deal about the Bible, and that and the <em>Pilgrim’s
Progress</em> were his chief aids in reflection. Both he took
quite literally, as if they were newspaper reports of actual recent
events.</p>

<p>He mentioned that after much consideration he had reached the
conclusion that the three greatest men he had ever heard of or
met were Mr Valiant-for-Truth, the Apostle Paul, and a certain
Billy Strang who had been with him in Mashonaland in ’92. Billy
I knew all about; he had been Peter’s hero and leader till a lion
got him in the Blaauwberg. Peter preferred Valiant-for-Truth to
Mr Greatheart, I think, because of his superior truculence, for,
being very gentle himself, he loved a bold speaker. After that
he dropped into a vein of self-examination. He regretted that
he fell far short of any of the three. He thought that he might
with luck resemble Mr Standfast, for like him he had not much
trouble in keeping wakeful, and was also as "poor as a howler",
and didn’t care for women. He only hoped that he could imitate
him in making a good end.</p>

<p>Then followed some remarks of Peter’s on courage, which came
to me in that London room as if spoken by his living voice. I
have never known anyone so brave, so brave by instinct, or anyone
who hated so much to be told so. It was almost the only thing
that could make him angry. All his life he had been facing death,
and to take risks seemed to him as natural as to get up in the
morning and eat his breakfast. But he had started out to consider
the very thing which before he had taken for granted, and here
is an extract from his conclusions. I paraphrase him, for he was
not grammatical.</p>

<p><em>It’s easy enough to be brave if you’re feeling well and have
food inside you. And it’s not so difficult even if you’re short
of a meal and seedy, for that makes you inclined to gamble. I
mean by being brave playing the game by the right rules without
letting it worry you that you may very likely get knocked on the
head. It’s the wisest way to save your skin. It doesn’t do to
think about death if you’re facing a charging lion or trying to
bluff a lot of savages. If you think about it you’ll get it; if
you don’t, the odds are you won’t. That kind of courage is only
good nerves and experience.... Most courage is experience. Most
people are a little scared at new things ...</em></p>

<p><em>You want a bigger heart to face danger which you go out to
look for, and which doesn’t come to you in the ordinary way of
business. Still, that’s pretty much the same thing—good nerves
and good health, and a natural liking for rows. You see, Dick,
in all that game there’s a lot of fun. There’s excitement and
the fun of using your wits and skill, and you know that the bad
bits can’t last long. When Arcoll sent me to Makapan’s kraal I
didn’t altogether fancy the job, but at the worst it was three
parts sport, and I got so excited that I never thought of the
risk till it was over ...</em></p>

<p><em>But the big courage is the cold-blooded kind, the kind that
never lets go even when you’re feeling empty inside, and your
blood’s thin, and there’s no kind of fun or profit to be had,
and the trouble’s not over in an hour or two but lasts for months
and years. One of the men here was speaking about that kind, and
he called it "Fortitude". I reckon fortitude’s the biggest thing
a man can have—just to go on enduring when there’s no guts or
heart left in you. Billy had it when he trekked solitary from
Garungoze to the Limpopo with fever and a broken arm just to show
the Portugooses that he wouldn’t be downed by them. But the head
man at the job was the Apostle Paul ...</em></p>

<p>Peter was writing for his own comfort, for fortitude was all
that was left to him now. But his words came pretty straight to
me, and I read them again and again, for I needed the lesson.
Here was I losing heart just because I had failed in the first
round and my pride had taken a knock. I felt honestly ashamed
of myself, and that made me a far happier man. There could be
no question of dropping the business, whatever its difficulties.
I had a queer religious feeling that Ivery and I had our fortunes
intertwined, and that no will of mine could keep us apart. I had
faced him before the war and won; I had faced him again and lost;
the third time or the twentieth time we would reach a final decision.
The whole business had hitherto appeared to me a trifle unreal,
at any rate my own connection with it. I had been docilely obeying
orders, but my real self had been standing aside and watching
my doings with a certain aloofness. But that hour in the Tube
station had brought me into the serum, and I saw the affair not
as Bullivant’s or even Blenkiron’s, but as my own. Before I had
been itching to get back to the Front; now I wanted to get on
to Ivery’s trail, though it should take me through the nether
pit. Peter was right; fortitude was the thing a man must possess
if he would save his soul.</p>

<p>The hours passed, and, as I expected, there came no word from
Macgillivray. I had some dinner sent up to me at seven o’clock,
and about eight I was thinking of looking up Blenkiron. Just then
came a telephone call asking me to go round to Sir Walter Bullivant’s
house in Queen Anne’s Gate.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later I was ringing the bell, and the door was opened
to me by the same impassive butler who had admitted me on that
famous night three years before. Nothing had changed in the pleasant
green-panelled hall; the alcove was the same as when I had watched
from it the departure of the man who now called himself Ivery;
the telephone book lay in the very place from which I had snatched
it in order to ring up the First Sea Lord. And in the back room,
where that night five anxious officials had conferred, I found
Sir Walter and Blenkiron.</p>

<p>Both looked worried, the American feverishly so. He walked up
and down the hearthrug, sucking an unlit black cigar.</p>

<p>"Say, Dick," he said, "this is a bad business. It wasn’t no fault
of yours. You did fine. It was us—me and Sir Walter and Mr Macgillivray
that were the quitters."</p>

<p>"Any news?" I asked.</p>

<p>"So far the cover’s drawn blank," Sir Walter replied. "It was
the devil’s own work that our friend looked your way today. You’re
pretty certain he saw that you recognised him?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely. As sure as that he knew I recognised him in your
hall three years ago when he was swaggering as Lord Alloa."</p>

<p>"No," said Blenkiron dolefully, "that little flicker of recognition
is just the one thing you can’t be wrong about. Land alive! I
wish Mr Macgillivray would come."</p>

<p>The bell rang, and the door opened, but it was not Macgillivray.
It was a young girl in a white ball-gown, with a cluster of blue
cornflowers at her breast. The sight of her fetched Sir Walter
out of his chair so suddenly that he upset his coffee cup.</p>

<p>"Mary, my dear, how did you manage it? I didn’t expect you till
the late train."</p>

<p>"I was in London, you see, and they telephoned on your telegram.
I’m staying with Aunt Doria, and I cut her theatre party. She
thinks I’m at the Shandwick’s dance, so I needn’t go home till
morning.... Good evening, General Hannay. You got over the Hill
Difficulty."</p>

<p>"The next stage is the Valley of Humiliation," I answered.</p>

<p>"So it would appear," she said gravely, and sat very quietly
on the edge of Sir Walter’s chair with her small, cool hand upon
his.</p>

<p>I had been picturing her in my recollection as very young and
glimmering, a dancing, exquisite child. But now I revised that
picture. The crystal freshness of morning was still there, but
I saw how deep the waters were. It was the clean fineness and
strength of her that entranced me. I didn’t even think of her
as pretty, any more than a man thinks of the good looks of the
friend he worships.</p>

<p>We waited, hardly speaking a word, till Macgillivray came. The
first sight of his face told his story.</p>

<p>"Gone?" asked Blenkiron sharply. The man’s lethargic calm seemed
to have wholly deserted him.</p>

<p>"Gone," repeated the newcomer. "We have just tracked him down.
Oh, he managed it cleverly. Never a sign of disturbance in any
of his lairs. His dinner ordered at Biggleswick and several people
invited to stay with him for the weekend—one a member of the Government.
Two meetings at which he was to speak arranged for next week.
Early this afternoon he flew over to France as a passenger in
one of the new planes. He had been mixed up with the Air Board
people for months—of course as another man with another face.
Miss Lamington discovered that just too late. The bus went out
of its course and came down in Normandy. By this time our man’s
in Paris or beyond it."</p>

<p>Sir Walter took off his big tortoiseshell spectacles and laid
them carefully on the table.</p>

<p>"Roll up the map of Europe," he said. "This is our Austerlitz.
Mary, my dear, I am feeling very old."</p>

<p>Macgillivray had the sharpened face of a bitterly disappointed
man. Blenkiron had got very red, and I could see that he was blaspheming
violently under his breath. Mary’s eyes were quiet and solemn.
She kept on patting Sir Walter’s hand. The sense of some great
impending disaster hung heavily on me, and to break the spell
I asked for details.</p>

<p>"Tell me just the extent of the damage," I asked. "Our neat plan
for deceiving the Boche has failed. That is bad. A dangerous spy
has got beyond our power. That’s worse. Tell me, is there still
a worst? What’s the limit of mischief he can do?"</p>

<p>Sir Walter had risen and joined Blenkiron on the hearthrug. His
brows were furrowed and his mouth hard as if he were suffering
pain.</p>

<p>"There is no limit," he said. "None that I can see, except the
long-suffering of God. You know the man as Ivery, and you knew
him as that other whom you believed to have been shot one summer
morning and decently buried. You feared the second—at least if
you didn’t, I did—most mortally. You realised that we feared Ivery,
and you knew enough about him to see his fiendish cleverness.
Well, you have the two men combined in one man. Ivery was the
best brain Macgillivray and I ever encountered, the most cunning
and patient and long-sighted. Combine him with the other, the
chameleon who can blend himself with his environment, and has
as many personalities as there are types and traits on the earth.
What kind of enemy is that to have to fight?"</p>

<p>"I admit it’s a steep proposition. But after all how much ill
can he do? There are pretty strict limits to the activity of even
the cleverest spy."</p>

<p>"I agree. But this man is not a spy who buys a few wretched subordinates
and steals a dozen private letters. He’s a genius who has been
living as part of our English life. There’s nothing he hasn’t
seen. He’s been on terms of intimacy with all kinds of politicians.
We know that. He did it as Ivery. They rather liked him, for he
was clever and flattered them, and they told him things. But God
knows what he saw and heard in his other personalities. For all
I know he may have breakfasted at Downing Street with letters
of introduction from President Wilson, or visited the Grand Fleet
as a distinguished neutral. Then think of the women; how they
talk. We’re the leakiest society on earth, and we safeguard ourselves
by keeping dangerous people out of it. We trust to our outer barrage.
But anyone who has really slipped inside has a million chances.
And this, remember, is one man in ten millions, a man whose brain
never sleeps for a moment, who is quick to seize the slightest
hint, who can piece a plan together out of a dozen bits of gossip.
It’s like—it’s as if the Chief of the Intelligence Department
were suddenly to desert to the enemy.... The ordinary spy knows
only bits of unconnected facts. This man knows our life and our
way of thinking and everything about us."</p>

<p>"Well, but a treatise on English life in time of war won’t do
much good to the Boche."</p>

<p>Sir Walter shook his head. "Don’t you realise the explosive stuff
that is lying about? Ivery knows enough to make the next German
peace offensive really deadly—not the blundering thing which it
has been up to now, but something which gets our weak spots on
the raw. He knows enough to wreck our campaign in the field. And
the awful thing is that we don’t know just what he knows or what
he is aiming for. This war’s a packet of surprises. Both sides
are struggling for the margin, the little fraction of advantage,
and between evenly matched enemies it’s just the extra atom of
foreknowledge that tells."</p>

<p>"Then we’ve got to push off and get after him," I said cheerfully.</p>

<p>"But what are you going to do?" asked Macgillivray. "If it were
merely a question of destroying an organisation it might be managed,
for an organisation presents a big front. But it’s a question
of destroying this one man, and his front is a razor edge. How
are you going to find him? It’s like looking for a needle in a
haystack, and such a needle! A needle which can become a piece
of straw or a tin-tack when it chooses!"</p>

<p>"All the same we’ve got to do it," I said, remembering old Peter’s
lesson on fortitude, though I can’t say I was feeling very stout-hearted.</p>

<p>Sir Walter flung himself wearily into an arm-chair. "I wish I
could be an optimist," he said, "but it looks as if we must own
defeat. I’ve been at this work for twenty years, and, though I’ve
been often beaten, I’ve always held certain cards in the game.
Now I’m hanged if I’ve any. It looks like a knock-out, Hannay.
It’s no good deluding ourselves. We’re men enough to look facts
in the face and tell ourselves the truth. I don’t see any ray
of light in the business. We’ve missed our shot by a hairsbreadth
and that’s the same as missing by miles."</p>

<p>I remember he looked at Mary as if for confirmation, but she
did not smile or nod. Her face was very grave and her eyes looked
steadily at him. Then they moved and met mine, and they seemed
to give me my marching orders.</p>

<p>"Sir Walter," I said, "three years ago you and I sat in this
very room. We thought we were done to the world, as we think now.
We had just that one miserable little clue to hang on to—a dozen
words scribbled in a notebook by a dead man. You thought I was
mad when I asked for Scudder’s book, but we put our backs into
the job and in twenty-four hours we had won out. Remember that
then we were fighting against time. Now we have a reasonable amount
of leisure. Then we had nothing but a sentence of gibberish. Now
we have a great body of knowledge, for Blenkiron has been brooding
over Ivery like an old hen, and he knows his ways of working and
his breed of confederate. You’ve got something to work on now.
Do you mean to tell me that, when the stakes are so big, you’re
going to chuck in your hand?"</p>

<p>Macgillivray raised his head. "We know a good deal about Ivery,
but Ivery’s dead. We know nothing of the man who was gloriously
resurrected this evening in Normandy."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes we do. There are many faces to the man, but only one
mind, and you know plenty about that mind."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Sir Walter. "How can you know a mind which has
no characteristics except that it is wholly and supremely competent?
Mere mental powers won’t give us a clue. We want to know the character
which is behind all the personalities. Above all we want to know
its foibles. If we had only a hint of some weakness we might make
a plan."</p>

<p>"Well, let’s set down all we know," I cried, for the more I argued
the keener I grew. I told them in some detail the story of the
night in the Coolin and what I had heard there.</p>

<p>"There’s the two names <em>Chelius</em> and <em>Bommaerts</em>.
The man spoke them in the same breath as <em>Elfenbein</em>, so
they must be associated with Ivery’s gang. You’ve got to get the
whole Secret Service of the Allies busy to fit a meaning to these
two words. Surely to goodness you’ll find something! Remember
those names don’t belong to the Ivery part, but to the big game
behind all the different disguises.... Then there’s the talk about
the Wild Birds and the Cage Birds. I haven’t a guess at what it
means. But it refers to some infernal gang, and among your piles
of records there must be some clue. You set the intelligence of
two hemispheres busy on the job. You’ve got all the machinery,
and it’s my experience that if even one solitary man keeps chewing
on at a problem he discovers something."</p>

<p>My enthusiasm was beginning to strike sparks from Macgillivray.
He was looking thoughtful now, instead of despondent.</p>

<p>"There might be something in that," he said, "but it’s a far-out
chance."</p>

<p>"Of course it’s a far-out chance, and that’s all we’re ever going
to get from Ivery. But we’ve taken a bad chance before and won....
Then you’ve all that you know about Ivery here. Go through his
<em>dossier</em> with a small-tooth comb and I’ll bet you find
something to work on. Blenkiron, you’re a man with a cool head.
You admit we’ve a sporting chance."</p>

<p>"Sure, Dick. He’s fixed things so that the lines are across the
track, but we’ll clear somehow. So far as John S. Blenkiron is
concerned he’s got just one thing to do in this world, and that’s
to follow the yellow dog and have him neatly and cleanly tidied
up. I’ve got a stack of personal affronts to settle. I was easy
fruit and he hasn’t been very respectful. You can count me in,
Dick."</p>

<p>"Then we’re agreed," I cried. "Well, gentlemen, it’s up to you
to arrange the first stage. You’ve some pretty solid staff work
to put in before you get on the trail."</p>

<p>"And you?" Sir Walter asked.</p>

<p>"I’m going back to my brigade. I want a rest and a change. Besides,
the first stage is office work, and I’m no use for that. But I’ll
be waiting to be summoned, and I’ll come like a shot as soon as
you hoick me out. I’ve got a presentiment about this thing. I
know there’ll be a finish and that I’ll be in at it, and I think
it will be a desperate, bloody business too."</p>

<p>I found Mary’s eyes fixed upon me, and in them I read the same
thought. She had not spoken a word, but had sat on the edge of
a chair, swinging a foot idly, one hand playing with an ivory
fan. She had given me my old orders and I looked to her for confirmation
of the new.</p>

<p>"Miss Lamington, you are the wisest of the lot of us. What do
you say?"</p>

<p>She smiled—that shy, companionable smile which I had been picturing
to myself through all the wanderings of the past month.</p>

<p>"I think you are right. We’ve a long way to go yet, for the Valley
of Humiliation comes only half-way in the <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em>.
The next stage was Vanity Fair. I might be of some use there,
don’t you think?"</p>

<p>I remember the way she laughed and flung back her head like a
gallant boy.</p>

<p>"The mistake we’ve all been making," she said, "is that our methods
are too <em>terre-à-terre</em>. We’ve a poet to deal with, a great
poet, and we must fling our imaginations forward to catch up with
him. His strength is his unexpectedness, you know, and we won’t
beat him by plodding only. I believe the wildest course is the
wisest, for it’s the most likely to intersect his.... Who’s the
poet among us?"</p>

<p>"Peter," I said. "But he’s pinned down with a game leg in Germany.
All the same we must rope him in."</p>

<p>By this time we had all cheered up, for it is wonderful what
a tonic there is in a prospect of action. The butler brought in
tea, which it was Bullivant’s habit to drink after dinner. To
me it seemed fantastic to watch a slip of a girl pouring it out
for two grizzled and distinguished servants of the State and one
battered soldier—as decorous a family party as you would ask to
see—and to reflect that all four were engaged in an enterprise
where men’s lives must be reckoned at less than thistledown.</p>

<p>After that we went upstairs to a noble Georgian drawing-room
and Mary played to us. I don’t care two straws for music from
an instrument—unless it be the pipes or a regimental band—but
I dearly love the human voice. But she would not sing, for singing
to her, I fancy, was something that did not come at will, but
flowed only like a bird’s note when the mood favoured. I did not
want it either. I was content to let "Cherry Ripe" be the one
song linked with her in my memory.</p>

<p>It was Macgillivray who brought us back to business.</p>

<p>"I wish to Heaven there was one habit of mind we could definitely
attach to him and to no one else." (At this moment "He" had only
one meaning for us.)</p>

<p>"You can’t do nothing with his mind," Blenkiron drawled. "You
can’t loose the bands of Orion, as the Bible says, or hold Leviathan
with a hook. I reckoned I could and made a mighty close study
of his de-vices. But the darned cuss wouldn’t stay put. I thought
I had tied him down to the double bluff, and he went and played
the triple bluff on me. There’s nothing doing that line."</p>

<p>A memory of Peter recurred to me.</p>

<p>"What about the ‘blind spot’?" I asked, and I told them old Peter’s
pet theory. "Every man that God made has his weak spot somewhere,
some flaw in his character which leaves a dull patch in his brain.
We’ve got to find that out, and I think I’ve made a beginning."</p>

<p>Macgillivray in a sharp voice asked my meaning.</p>

<p>"He’s in a funk ... of something. Oh, I don’t mean he’s a coward.
A man in his trade wants the nerve of a buffalo. He could give
us all points in courage. What I mean is that he’s not clean white
all through. There are yellow streaks somewhere in him.... I’ve
given a good deal of thought to this courage business, for I haven’t
got a great deal of it myself. Not like Peter, I mean. I’ve got
heaps of soft places in me. I’m afraid of being drowned for one
thing, or of getting my eyes shot out. Ivery’s afraid of bombs—at
any rate he’s afraid of bombs in a big city. I once read a book
which talked about a thing called <em>agoraphobia</em>. Perhaps
it’s that.... Now if we know that weak spot it helps us in our
work. There are some places he won’t go to, and there are some
things he can’t do—not well, anyway. I reckon that’s useful."</p>

<p>"Ye-es," said Macgillivray. "Perhaps it’s not what you’d call
a burning and a shining light."</p>

<p>"There’s another chink in his armour," I went on. "There’s one
person in the world he can never practise his transformations
on, and that’s me. I shall always know him again, though he appeared
as Sir Douglas Haig. I can’t explain why, but I’ve got a feel
in my bones about it. I didn’t recognise him before, for I thought
he was dead, and the nerve in my brain which should have been
looking for him wasn’t working. But I’m on my guard now, and that
nerve’s functioning at full power. Whenever and wherever and howsoever
we meet again on the face of the earth, it will be ‘Dr Livingstone,
I presume’ between him and me."</p>

<p>"That is better," said Macgillivray. "If we have any luck, Hannay,
it won’t be long till we pull you out of His Majesty’s Forces."</p>

<p>Mary got up from the piano and resumed her old perch on the arm
of Sir Walter’s chair.</p>

<p>"There’s another blind spot which you haven’t mentioned." It
was a cool evening, but I noticed that her cheeks had suddenly
flushed.</p>

<p>"Last week Mr Ivery asked me to marry him," she said.</p>
