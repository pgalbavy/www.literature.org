A CONTROVERSY prevailed among the beasts of the field as to which
of the animals deserved the most credit for producing the
greatest number of whelps at a birth.  They rushed clamorously
into the presence of the Lioness and demanded of her the
settlement of the dispute.  "And you," they said, "how many sons
have you at a birth?'  The Lioness laughed at them, and said:
"Why! I have only one; but that one is altogether a thoroughbred
Lion."  
 
The value is in the worth, not in the number.
