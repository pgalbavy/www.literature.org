"It's the homiest spot I ever saw -- it's homier than home,"
avowed Philippa Gordon, looking about her with delighted eyes.
They were all assembled at twilight in the big living-room at
Patty's Place -- Anne and Priscilla, Phil and Stella, Aunt Jamesina,
Rusty, Joseph, the Sarah-Cat, and Gog and Magog.  The firelight
shadows were dancing over the walls; the cats were purring;
and a huge bowl of hothouse chrysanthemums, sent to Phil by one
of the victims, shone through the golden gloom like creamy moons.
<P>
It was three weeks since they had considered themselves settled,
and already all believed the experiment would be a success.  The
first fortnight after their return had been a pleasantly exciting
one; they had been busy setting up their household goods, organizing
their little establishment, and adjusting different opinions.
<P>
Anne was not over-sorry to leave Avonlea when the time came to
return to college.  The last few days of her vacation had not
been pleasant.  Her prize story had been published in the Island
papers; and Mr. William Blair had, upon the counter of his
store, a huge pile of pink, green and yellow pamphlets,
containing it, one of which he gave to every customer.  He sent a
complimentary bundle to Anne, who promptly dropped them all in
the kitchen stove.  Her humiliation was the consequence of her
own ideals only, for Avonlea folks thought it quite splendid
that she should have won the prize.  Her many friends regarded
her with honest admiration; her few foes with scornful envy.
Josie Pye said she believed Anne Shirley had just copied the story;
she was sure she remembered reading it in a paper years before.
The Sloanes, who had found out or guessed that Charlie had been
"turned down," said they didn't think it was much to be proud of;
almost any one could have done it, if she tried.  Aunt Atossa
told Anne she was very sorry to hear she had taken to writing
novels; nobody born and bred in Avonlea would do it; that was
what came of adopting orphans from goodness knew where, with
goodness knew what kind of parents.  Even Mrs. Rachel Lynde was
darkly dubious about the propriety of writing fiction, though she
was almost reconciled to it by that twenty-five dollar check.
<P>
"It is perfectly amazing, the price they pay for such lies,
that's what," she said, half-proudly, half-severely.
<P>
All things considered, it was a relief when going-away time came.
And it was very jolly to be back at Redmond, a wise, experienced
Soph with hosts of friends to greet on the merry opening day.
Pris and Stella and Gilbert were there, Charlie Sloane, looking
more important than ever a Sophomore looked before, Phil, with
the Alec-and-Alonzo question still unsettled, and Moody Spurgeon
MacPherson.  Moody Spurgeon had been teaching school ever since
leaving Queen's, but his mother had concluded it was high time
he gave it up and turned his attention to learning how to be a
minister.  Poor Moody Spurgeon fell on hard luck at the very
beginning of his college career.  Half a dozen ruthless Sophs,
who were among his fellow-boarders, swooped down upon him one
night and shaved half of his head.  In this guise the luckless
Moody Spurgeon had to go about until his hair grew again.  He
told Anne bitterly that there were times when he had his doubts
as to whether he was really called to be a minister.
<P>
Aunt Jamesina did not come until the girls had Patty's Place
ready for her.  Miss Patty had sent the key to Anne, with a
letter in which she said Gog and Magog were packed in a box under
the spare-room bed, but might be taken out when wanted; in a
postscript she added that she hoped the girls would be careful
about putting up pictures.  The living room had been newly
papered five years before and she and Miss Maria did not want any
more holes made in that new paper than was absolutely necessary.
For the rest she trusted everything to Anne.
<P>
How those girls enjoyed putting their nest in order!  As Phil said,
it was almost as good as getting married.  You had the fun of
homemaking without the bother of a husband.  All brought something
with them to adorn or make comfortable the little house.  Pris and
Phil and Stella had knick-knacks and pictures galore, which latter
they proceeded to hang according to taste, in reckless disregard
of Miss Patty's new paper.
<P>
"We'll putty the holes up when we leave, dear -- she'll never know,"
they said to protesting Anne.
<P>
Diana had given Anne a pine needle cushion and Miss Ada had given
both her and Priscilla a fearfully and wonderfully embroidered one.
Marilla had sent a big box of preserves, and darkly hinted at a
hamper for Thanksgiving, and Mrs. Lynde gave Anne a patchwork quilt
and loaned her five more.
<P>
"You take them," she said authoritatively.  "They might as well be
in use as packed away in that trunk in the garret for moths to gnaw."
<P>
No moths would ever have ventured near those quilts, for they
reeked of mothballs to such an extent that they had to be hung in
the orchard of Patty's Place a full fortnight before they could
be endured indoors.  Verily, aristocratic Spofford Avenue had
rarely beheld such a display.  The gruff old millionaire who
lived "next door" came over and wanted to buy the gorgeous red
and yellow "tulip-pattern" one which Mrs. Rachel had given Anne.
He said his mother used to make quilts like that, and by Jove, he
wanted one to remind him of her.  Anne would not sell it, much to
his disappointment, but she wrote all about it to Mrs. Lynde.
That highly-gratified lady sent word back that she had one just
like it to spare, so the tobacco king got his quilt after all,
and insisted on having it spread on his bed, to the disgust of
his fashionable wife.
<P>
Mrs. Lynde's quilts served a very useful purpose that winter.
Patty's Place for all its many virtues, had its faults also.
It was really a rather cold house; and when the frosty nights
came the girls were very glad to snuggle down under Mrs. Lynde's
quilts, and hoped that the loan of them might be accounted unto
her for righteousness.  Anne had the blue room she had coveted
at sight.  Priscilla and Stella had the large one.  Phil was
blissfully content with the little one over the kitchen; and
Aunt Jamesina was to have the downstairs one off the living-room.
Rusty at first slept on the doorstep.
<P>
Anne, walking home from Redmond a few days after her return,
became aware that the people that she met surveyed her with a
covert, indulgent smile.  Anne wondered uneasily what was the
matter with her.  Was her hat crooked?  Was her belt loose?
Craning her head to investigate, Anne, for the first time,
saw Rusty.
<P>
Trotting along behind her, close to her heels, was quite the
most forlorn specimen of the cat tribe she had ever beheld.
The animal was well past kitten-hood, lank, thin, disreputable
looking.  Pieces of both ears were lacking, one eye was
temporarily out of repair, and one jowl ludicrously swollen.
As for color, if a once black cat had been well and thoroughly
singed the result would have resembled the hue of this waif's
thin, draggled, unsightly fur.
<P>
Anne "shooed," but the cat would not "shoo."  As long as she
stood he sat back on his haunches and gazed at her reproachfully
out of his one good eye; when she resumed her walk he followed.
Anne resigned herself to his company until she reached the gate
of Patty's Place, which she coldly shut in his face, fondly
supposing she had seen the last of him.  But when, fifteen
minutes later, Phil opened the door, there sat the rusty-brown
cat on the step.  More, he promptly darted in and sprang upon
Anne's lap with a half-pleading, half-triumphant "miaow."
<P>
"Anne," said Stella severely, "do you own that animal?"
<P>
"No, I do NOT," protested disgusted Anne.  "The creature followed
me home from somewhere.  I couldn't get rid of him.  Ugh, get down.
I like decent cats reasonably well; but I don't like beasties of
your complexion."
<P>
Pussy, however, refused to get down.  He coolly curled up in
Anne's lap and began to purr.
<P>
"He has evidently adopted you," laughed Priscilla.
<P>
"I won't BE adopted," said Anne stubbornly.
<P>
"The poor creature is starving," said Phil pityingly.  "Why, his
bones are almost coming through his skin."
<P>
"Well, I'll give him a square meal and then he must return to
whence he came," said Anne resolutely.
<P>
The cat was fed and put out.  In the morning he was still
on the doorstep.  On the doorstep he continued to sit, bolting
in whenever the door was opened.  No coolness of welcome had
the least effect on him; of nobody save Anne did he take the
least notice.  Out of compassion the girls fed him; but when
a week had passed they decided that something must be done.
The cat's appearance had improved.  His eye and cheek had
resumed their normal appearance; he was not quite so thin;
and he had been seen washing his face.
<P>
"But for all that we can't keep him," said Stella.  "Aunt Jimsie
is coming next week and she will bring the Sarah-cat with her.
<P>
We can't keep two cats; and if we did this Rusty Coat would
fight all the time with the Sarah-cat.  He's a fighter by nature.
He had a pitched battle last evening with the tobacco-king's cat
and routed him, horse, foot and artillery."
<P>
"We must get rid of him," agreed Anne, looking darkly at the
subject of their discussion, who was purring on the hearth rug
with an air of lamb-like meekness.  "But the question is -- how?
How can four unprotected females get rid of a cat who won't be
got rid of?"
<P>
We must chloroform him," said Phil briskly.  "That is the most
humane way."
<P>
"Who of us knows anything about chloroforming a cat?" demanded
Anne gloomily.
<P>
"I do, honey.  It's one of my few -- sadly few -- useful accomplishments.
I've disposed of several at home.  You take the cat in the morning and
give him a good breakfast.  Then you take an old burlap bag -- there's
one in the back porch -- put the cat on it and turn over him a wooden box.
Then take a two-ounce bottle of chloroform, uncork it, and slip it under
the edge of the box.  Put a heavy weight on top of the box and leave it
till evening.  The cat will be dead, curled up peacefully as if he
were asleep.  No pain -- no struggle."
<P>
"It sounds easy," said Anne dubiously.
<P>
"It IS easy.  Just leave it to me.  I'll see to it," said Phil reassuringly.
<P>
Accordingly the chloroform was procured, and the next morning Rusty was
lured to his doom.  He ate his breakfast, licked his chops, and climbed
into Anne's lap.  Anne's heart misgave her.  This poor creature loved her
-- trusted her.  How could she be a party to this destruction?
<P>
"Here, take him," she said hastily to Phil.  "I feel like a murderess."
<P>
"He won't suffer, you know," comforted Phil, but Anne had fled.
<P>
The fatal deed was done in the back porch.  Nobody went near it
that day.  But at dusk Phil declared that Rusty must be buried.
<P>
"Pris and Stella must dig his grave in the orchard," declared Phil,
"and Anne must come with me to lift the box off.  That's the part
I always hate."
<P>
The two conspirators tip-toed reluctantly to the back porch.
Phil gingerly lifted the stone she had put on the box.  Suddenly,
faint but distinct, sounded an unmistakable mew under the box.
<P>
"He -- he isn't dead," gasped Anne, sitting blankly down on the
kitchen doorstep.
<P>
"He must be," said Phil incredulously.
<P>
Another tiny mew proved that he wasn't.  The two girls stared at
each other."
<P>
What will we do?" questioned Anne.
<P>
"Why in the world don't you come?" demanded Stella, appearing in
the doorway.  "We've got the grave ready.  `What silent still and
silent all?'" she quoted teasingly.
<P>
"`Oh, no, the voices of the dead Sound like the distant torrent's fall,'"
promptly counter-quoted Anne, pointing solemnly to the box.
<P>
A burst of laughter broke the tension.
<P>
"We must leave him here till morning," said Phil, replacing the stone.
"He hasn't mewed for five minutes.  Perhaps the mews we heard were his
dying groan.  Or perhaps we merely imagined them, under the strain of
our guilty consciences."
<P>
But, when the box was lifted in the morning, Rusty bounded at one gay
leap to Anne's shoulder where he began to lick her face affectionately.
Never was there a cat more decidedly alive.
<P>
"Here's a knot hole in the box," groaned Phil.  "I never saw it.
That's why he didn't die.  Now, we've got to do it all over again."
<P>
"No, we haven't," declared Anne suddenly.  "Rusty isn't going to be
killed again.  He's my cat -- and you've just got to make the best of it."
<P>
"Oh, well, if you'll settle with Aunt Jimsie and the Sarah-cat,"
said Stella, with the air of one washing her hands of the whole affair.
<P>
From that time Rusty was one of the family.  He slept o'nights on the
scrubbing cushion in the back porch and lived on the fat of the land.
By the time Aunt Jamesina came he was plump and glossy and tolerably
respectable.  But, like Kipling's cat, he "walked by himself."
His paw was against every cat, and every cat's paw against him.
One by one he vanquished the aristocratic felines of Spofford Avenue.
As for human beings, he loved Anne and Anne alone.  Nobody else even
dared stroke him.  An angry spit and something that sounded much like
very improper language greeted any one who did.
<P>
"The airs that cat puts on are perfectly intolerable," declared Stella.
<P>
"Him was a nice old pussens, him was," vowed Anne, cuddling her pet defiantly.
<P>
"Well, I don't know how he and the Sarah-cat will ever make out
to live together," said Stella pesimistically.  "Cat-fights in
the orchard o'nights are bad enough.  But cat-fights here in the
livingroom are unthinkable."  In due time Aunt Jamesina arrived.
Anne and Priscilla and Phil had awaited her advent rather dubiously;
but when Aunt Jamesina was enthroned in the rocking chair before the
open fire they figuratively bowed down and worshipped her.
<P>
Aunt Jamesina was a tiny old woman with a little, softly-triangular face,
and large, soft blue eyes that were alight with unquenchable youth, and
as full of hopes as a girl's.  She had pink cheeks and snow-white hair
which she wore in quaint little puffs over her ears.
<P>
"It's a very old-fashioned way," she said, knitting industriously
at something as dainty and pink as a sunset cloud.  "But _I_ am old-fashioned.
My clothes are, and it stands to reason my opinions are, too.  I don't say
they're any the better of that, mind you.  In fact, I daresay they're a good
deal the worse.  But they've worn nice and easy.  New shoes are smarter than
old ones, but the old ones are more comfortable.  I'm old enough to indulge
myself in the matter of shoes and opinions.  I mean to take it real easy here.
I know you expect me to look after you and keep you proper, but I'm not going
to do it.
<P>
You're old enough to know how to behave if you're ever going to be.
So, as far as I am concerned," concluded Aunt Jamesina, with a twinkle
in her young eyes, "you can all go to destruction in your own way."
<P>
"Oh, will somebody separate those cats?" pleaded Stella, shudderingly.
<P>
Aunt Jamesina had brought with her not only the Sarah-cat but Joseph.
Joseph, she explained, had belonged to a dear friend of hers who had
gone to live in Vancouver.
<P>
"She couldn't take Joseph with her so she begged me to take him.
I really couldn't refuse.  He's a beautiful cat -- that is, his
disposition is beautiful.  She called him Joseph because his coat
is of many colors."
<P>
It certainly was.  Joseph, as the disgusted Stella said, looked
like a walking rag-bag.  It was impossible to say what his ground
color was.  His legs were white with black spots on them.
His back was gray with a huge patch of yellow on one side and a
black patch on the other.  His tail was yellow with a gray tip.
One ear was black and one yellow.  A black patch over one eye gave
him a fearfully rakish look.  In reality he was meek and inoffensive,
of a sociable disposition.  In one respect, if in no other, Joseph
was like a lily of the field.  He toiled not neither did he spin
or catch mice.  Yet Solomon in all his glory slept not on softer
cushions, or feasted more fully on fat things.
<P>
Joseph and the Sarah-cat arrived by express in separate boxes.
After they had been released and fed, Joseph selected the cushion
and corner which appealed to him, and the Sarah-cat gravely sat
herself down before the fire and proceeded to wash her face.  She
was a large, sleek, gray-and-white cat, with an enormous dignity
which was not at all impaired by any consciousness of her plebian
origin.  She had been given to Aunt Jamesina by her washerwoman.
<P>
"Her name was Sarah, so my husband always called puss the
Sarah-cat," explained Aunt Jamesina.  "She is eight years old,
and a remarkable mouser.  Don't worry, Stella.  The Sarah-cat
NEVER fights and Joseph rarely."
<P>
"They'll have to fight here in self-defense," said Stella.
<P>
At this juncture Rusty arrived on the scene.  He bounded
joyously half way across the room before he saw the intruders.
Then he stopped short; his tail expanded until it was as big as
three tails.  The fur on his back rose up in a defiant arch;
Rusty lowered his head, uttered a fearful shriek of hatred and
defiance, and launched himself at the Sarah-cat.
<P>
The stately animal had stopped washing her face and was looking
at him curiously.  She met his onslaught with one contemptuous
sweep of her capable paw.  Rusty went rolling helplessly over on
the rug; he picked himself up dazedly.  What sort of a cat was
this who had boxed his ears?  He looked dubiously at the Sarah-cat.
Would he or would he not?  The Sarah-cat deliberately turned her
back on him and resumed her toilet operations.  Rusty decided that
he would not.  He never did.  From that time on the Sarah-cat ruled
the roost.  Rusty never again interfered with her.
<P>
But Joseph rashly sat up and yawned.  Rusty, burning to avenge
his disgrace, swooped down upon him.  Joseph, pacific by nature,
could fight upon occasion and fight well.  The result was a
series of drawn battles.  Every day Rusty and Joseph fought at
sight.  Anne took Rusty's part and detested Joseph.  Stella was
in despair.  But Aunt Jamesina only laughed.
<P>
Let them fight it out," she said tolerantly.  "They'll make friends
after a bit.  Joseph needs some exercise -- he was getting too fat.
And Rusty has to learn he isn't the only cat in the world."
<P>
Eventually Joseph and Rusty accepted the situation and from sworn
enemies became sworn friends.  They slept on the same cushion with
their paws about each other, and gravely washed each other's faces.
<P>
"We've all got used to each other," said Phil.  "And I've learned
how to wash dishes and sweep a floor."
<P>
"But you needn't try to make us believe you can chloroform a cat,"
laughed Anne.
<P>
"It was all the fault of the knothole," protested Phil.
<P>
"It was a good thing the knothole was there," said Aunt Jamesina
rather severely.  "Kittens HAVE to be drowned, I admit, or the
world would be overrun.  But no decent, grown-up cat should be
done to death -- unless he sucks eggs."
<P>
"You wouldn't have thought Rusty very decent if you'd seen him when
he came here," said Stella.  "He positively looked like the Old Nick."
<P>
"I don't believe Old Nick can be so very, ugly" said Aunt Jamesina
reflectively.  "He wouldn't do so much harm if he was.  _I_ always
think of him as a rather handsome gentleman."
