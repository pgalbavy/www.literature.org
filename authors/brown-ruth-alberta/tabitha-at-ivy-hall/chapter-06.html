<p>"Oh, Tabitha, Tabitha, come over to my house and see what papa
has brought me!"</p>

<p>Carrie's voice was shrill with joy; and hastily setting the last
cup on the pantry shelf, Tabitha seized her sunbonnet and rushed
away to join her excited playmate. "It's out here on the back
porch, and oh, it's a perfect darling! Tell me what to call him.
Isn't he a beauty?"</p>

<p>Talking and laughing and capering in delight, Carrie led the
way to the rear of the house, and there in a box on the steps
was a beautiful, black, shaggy pup, with the longest, silkiest
hair and the prettiest brown eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Carrie Carson, aren't you the luckiest girl!" cried Tabitha,
looking enviously at the treasure as she bent over it to smooth
the soft, shaggy coat. "Just see what beau-ti-ful ears he has!
And what a cunning nose! See him lick my hand!"</p>

<p>"He's kissing you. Isn't he cute? One of papa's men at the mine
owned four of these little pups, and he sold this one for five
dollars. He is to be my very own and I am going to teach him tricks
when he is old enough. Isn't he a darling?"</p>

<p>"I should say he is! I wish he belonged to me." The black eyes
grew very wistful and the brown face unusually sober as she examined
this new toy, this live toy that could really play with its little
mistress and understand, at least in a measure, whatever was said
to it.</p>

<p>Carrie saw the longing glance and promptly said, "You can play
with him, too, Puss, and help me teach him things,&mdash;to speak when
he wants something to eat, and to bring us sticks or stones when
we throw them for him to chase, and to jump through barrel hoops,
and to shake hands, and to walk on his hind legs like Jimmy's
dog, Sport, does, and to play sleep, and to stand on his hind
legs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That will be ever so nice, but it isn't the same as if he was
mine, Carrie," interrupted the mournful Tabitha, completely wrapped
up in this tiny specimen of puppyhood.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;that's so," answered the other child thoughtfully, watching
the precious possession with jealous eyes as it curled up in Tabitha's
arms and shut its eyes for a nap.</p>

<p>"He likes me already, doesn't he? I've always wanted a pet, but
we've never stayed long enough in one place to have anything of
this kind. I had a rabbit once, but a dog caught it, and I cried
so hard Aunt Maria said I never should have another."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what! Part of this dog can be yours," said Carrie
generously, though it cost her an effort to speak those words.</p>

<p>"Oh, Carrie, you don't mean that?" cried the astonished Tabitha.
"Really own part of your beautiful pup? What will your father
and mother say?"</p>

<p>"They won't care a bit. The dog is all mine to do what I like
with, and I like to give you a share of him. Course he will live
here, and I will feed him, so papa can tell me what to give him,
as pups are very hard to raise properly and it takes someone that
knows how to do it. But you can really, truly own half of him."</p>

<p>"What a good girl you are, Carrie!" exclaimed the other part
owner, much impressed at Carrie's grand air of knowledge. "If
I had a dog all my own, I'm afraid I'd never want to share him
with anyone else, except to play with. I'd want to keep all the
ownership myself."</p>

<p>"Well, it would be different with you. All the pets you ever
have had was a bunny, while I've had a Shetland pony until we
came up here on the desert where there isn't anything for him
to eat, and a little lamb out on grandma's farm, and two brown
hens, and a pair of doves, and three kitties, and this makes the
second dog."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"That's a lot of pets to have one person own, isn't it? But they
didn't all belong to me at the same time, and this dog is the
best of them all&mdash;except the pony. Dear little Arrow is at grandma's
house now and when I go back to town to live, if I'm not too big
I am to have her again."</p>

<p>"What a cute name for a pony! What are you going to call this
pup?"</p>

<p>"I had thought of Ponto, but papa says he will grow up into a
big dog, and he thought General would be a nice name."</p>

<p>"I like Ponto best, I believe. It has a grander sound to it than
General. And yet&mdash;can I name my half of the dog, too?" as a sudden
inspiration came to her mind.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes&mdash;if it fits in with General," a little doubtfully,
for Carrie's ideas of beautiful names differed materially from
Tabitha's.</p>

<p>"It will go with it splendidly &mdash;Sheridan Sherman Grant
McClellan."</p>

<p>"Which one?"</p>

<p>"All of them. That ain't too many, is it? I do like all those
generals so much, and I should hate to have to drop any of them."</p>

<p>"It's an awfully long name to say when you want to call a dog,"
said the first little mistress reflectively, yet afraid to suggest
the curtailing of it for fear of wounding her playmate.</p>

<p>"But you can shorten it up like&mdash;like I did once with&mdash;" The
unhappy episode was still very fresh in her mind, and her heart
still very sore; so she hesitated, unwilling to recall it further.</p>

<p>"I know," interrupted sympathetic Carrie hastily. "We can shorten
it to General Sheridan or General&mdash;what would you shorten it to?"</p>

<p>"General McClellan is the grandest sounding name, but General
Grant is the easiest to say, and I suppose a dog ought to be called
the easiest name so he can remember it. We'll call him General
Grant."</p>

<p>The dog was named.</p>

<p>That evening Tabitha was sitting on the steps studying her geography
when Tom came home late for supper, but every moment or two she
would look up from her books toward the Carson house, and stare
intently at something he could not see, while she seemed to be
listening for something he could not hear. From his seat at the
table he could watch her unobserved, and when at last he had satisfied
his appetite, he joined her on the steps, asking curiously, "What's
the matter, Puss? Geography doesn't seem to be interesting you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom, it's the pup! Carrie has the dearest little shaggy
dog. She said I might be part owner of it, and we've named him
General Sheridan Sherman Grant McClellan. General is her name
for him, and the rest is mine. It's most too long to say the whole
of it every time we want him to come, so we are going to call
him General Grant for short. Isn't that a nice name?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should say so. The General no doubt would be flattered
if he could know."</p>

<p>"He's an awfully pretty pup and will make a great big dog when
he's grown up. His feet are dreadfully big, but Mr. Carson says
he will need them some day, and all big dogs have big feet when
they are little. Carrie wanted to name him Ponto, but her father
thought General sounded more dignified for such a big dog. Ponto
is a pretty name, though, and if I had a pup all of my own I'd
call him&mdash; Say, Tom, do you suppose Dad would let me have a dog
for my very own self? It's nice to own part of one, but think
how much better it would be if I had a whole one. Then Carrie
wouldn't have to share hers, and I really think she would rather
own all of General Grant herself. If I asked Dad, do you suppose
he would say yes?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know, Puss, but I am afraid not. We had a pup
once when I was small, and it chewed up everything it could get
hold of. I had a little suit of black velvet &mdash;I remember
it was the first I ever had with pockets in it&mdash;and one day the
pup got hold of it and tore it all to pieces. Dad gave him away
at last because he did so much damage."</p>

<p>"What was its name?"</p>

<p>"Pinto."</p>

<p>"Why, isn't that funny&mdash;almost the name Carrie wanted! If I had
a dog, Tom, I should name him Pinto Ponto Poco Pronto. Wouldn't
that be grand? I never heard anything called that, and it has
such a pretty jingle about it when you say them all together.
It's a&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;'literation? It means where a whole
string of words begin with the same letter. Don't you think that
would make a splendid name for a dog?"</p>

<p>"Capital," answered loyal Tom, and Tabitha again took up the
study of her geography lesson, for while she had been talking,
Mr. Carson had opened the door of the big house and carried General
Grant, box and all, inside.</p>

<p>Tom was not the only one who had heard Tabitha's raptures over
the new possession, however. Sitting by the open window behind
his newspaper, Mr. Catt had caught every word of the conversation,
unknown to his small daughter, who did not realize his close proximity
while she was unburdening her heart to the big brother; and he
smiled derisively at the narrative; so when the child found courage
to ask him for a pet dog he answered curtly, "No, Miss Tabitha,
we don't want any pups around here. Dogs and cats fight, you know."</p>

<p>Without another word, the small supplicant went mournfully away
to gaze with longing eyes at the joint possession and wish more
fervently than ever that it might be hers.</p>

<p>But Mr. Catt was not really heartless. A few days later on his
way home from a short trip to his claims, he found a half-starved
cat tied to a lonely yucca far up on the mountain trail, where
it had been abandoned by its inhuman owners and left to this terrible
fate. Indignation burned within the man as he realized the plight
of the unhappy animal, and remembering Tabitha's plea for a pet,
he carried the scrawny feline home to the child, feeling assured
of its welcome there. But unfortunately the cat was as black as
a coal, without a white hair on its body; its tail had a very
perceptible crook in it which refused to be straightened out;
its ears had been closely cropped, and altogether it was so gaunt
and hideous that involuntarily one shuddered to look at it.</p>

<p>"A cat!" exclaimed disappointed Tabitha when she had been called
to see the gift. "I never asked for a cat; I don't want a cat;
I hate cats! There are enough cats in this house already without
this horrible skeleton. I suppose you will want me to call it
Tabby. Oh, dear, what a time I do have living!"</p>

<p>With a wail of woe Tabitha fled up the trail to her hidden chamber
among the boulders and threw herself on the ground to sob out
her grief and anger over this unexpected and wholly unwelcome
pet. That she would regard the gift as an insult when he had presented
it with the best of intentions had never occurred to the father,
and not understanding her antipathy for all of the feline tribe,
he was naturally somewhat angry at her attitude; so he insisted
that the cat had come to stay. And indeed it looked as if she
had, for no one wanted the homely, starved creature, and though
three times Tabitha surreptitiously pushed her down the shaft
of an abandoned mine on the other side of the mountain, the animal
always appeared serenely at meal time with a more ravenous appetite
than ever, and Tabitha began to think that the "nine lives of
a cat" was no joke, but a dreadful reality.</p>

<p>"I wish the owners of that thing had kept her. It was cruel to
tie her to the yucca and leave her to starve to death, but I 'most
wish she'd been dead when Dad found her. I hate the sight of her."
She was sitting on the lower step, elbows on her knees and chin
resting in her hands as she somberly surveyed the greedy animal
lapping up the milk she had just set before it, and vainly wished
she had no pet at all.</p>

<p>The kitchen door opened behind her and the father stepped out
on the porch. His quick glance took in the whole situation in
an instant, and recalling the conversation concerning the dog
a few nights previously, he asked with some curiosity, "What have
you named your cat, Tabitha?"</p>

<p>Without lifting her eyes or manifesting any interest in the subject
she answered briefly, "Lynne Maximilian."</p>

<p>The man started as if he could not believe his ears, and then
with an almost audible chuckle of amusement, he descended the
steps and strode rapidly up the path toward the town.</p>
