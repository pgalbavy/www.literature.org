<P>On the second flight of stairs, whether from fatigue or
emotion, the breathing of the visitor began to fail him, and
he leaned against the wall. &quot;Will you begin with this one?&quot;
said Baisemeaux; &quot;for since we are going to both, it matters
very little whether we ascend from the second to the third
story, or descend from the third to the second.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, no,&quot; exclaimed Aramis, eagerly, &quot;higher, if you please;
the one above is the more urgent.&quot; They continued their
ascent. &quot;Ask the jailer for the keys,&quot; whispered Aramis.
Baisemeaux did so, took the keys, and, himself, opened the
door of the third room. The jailer was the first to enter;
he placed upon the table the provisions, which the
kind-hearted governor called dainties, and then left the
room. The prisoner had not stirred; Baisemeaux then entered,
while Aramis remained at the threshold, from which place he
saw a youth about eighteen years of age, who, raising his
head at the unusual noise, jumped off the bed, as he
perceived the governor, and clasping his hands together,
began to cry out, &quot;My mother, my mother,&quot; in tones which
betrayed such deep distress that Aramis, despite his command
over himself, felt a shudder pass through his frame. &quot;My
dear boy,&quot; said Baisemeaux, endeavoring to smile, &quot;I have
brought you a diversion and an extra,  -  the one for the
mind, the other for the body; this gentleman has come to
take your measure, and here are some preserves for your
dessert.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, monsieur,&quot; exclaimed the young man, &quot;keep me in
solitude for a year, let me have nothing but bread and water
for a year, but tell me that at the end of a year I shall
leave this place, tell me that at the end of a year I shall
see my mother again.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But I have heard you say that your mother was very poor,
and that you were very badly lodged when you were living
with her, while here  -  upon my word!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If she were poor, monsieur, the greater reason to restore
her only means of support to her. Badly lodged with her! Oh,
monsieur, every one is always well lodged when he is free.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At all events, since you yourself admit you have done
nothing but write that unhappy distich  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But without any intention, I swear. Let me be punished  - 
cut off the hand which wrote it, I will work with the other
 -  but restore my mother to me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My boy,&quot; said Baisemeaux, &quot;you know very well that it does
not depend upon me; all I can do for you is to increase your
rations, give you a glass of port wine now and then, slip in
a biscuit for you between a couple of plates.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Great heaven!&quot; exclaimed the young man, falling backward
and rolling on the ground.</P>
<P>Aramis, unable to bear this scene any longer, withdrew as
far as the landing. &quot;Unhappy, wretched man,&quot; he murmured.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, monsieur, he is indeed very wretched,&quot; said the
jailer; &quot;but it is his parents' fault.</P>
<P>&quot;In what way?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No doubt. Why did they let him learn Latin? Too much
knowledge, you see; it is that which does harm. Now I, for
instance, can't read or write, and therefore I am not in
prison.&quot; Aramis looked at the man, who seemed to think that
being a jailer in the Bastile was not being in prison. As
for Baisemeaux, noticing the little effect produced by his
advice and his port wine, he left the dungeon quite upset.
&quot;You have forgotten to close the door,&quot; said the jailer.</P>
<P>&quot;So I have,&quot; said Baisemeaux, &quot;there are the keys, do you do
it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will solicit the pardon of that poor boy,&quot; said Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;And if you do not succeed,&quot; said Baisemeaux, &quot;at least beg
that he may be transferred to the ten-franc list, by which
both he and I shall be gainers.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If the other prisoner calls out for his mother in a similar
manner,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;I prefer not to enter at all, but
will take my measure from outside.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No fear of that, monsieur architect, the one we are now
going to see is as gentle as a lamb; before he could call
after his mother he must open his lips, and he never says a
word.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let us go in, then,&quot; said Aramis, gloomily.</P>
<P>&quot;Are you the architect of the prisons, monsieur?&quot; said the
jailer.</P>
<P>&quot;I am.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is odd, then, that you are not more accustomed to all
this.&quot;</P>
<P>Aramis perceived that, to avoid giving rise to any
suspicions he must summon all his strength of mind to his
assistance. Baisemeaux, who carried the keys, opened the
door. &quot;Stay outside,&quot; he said to the jailer, &quot;and wait for
us at the bottom of the steps.&quot; The jailer obeyed and
withdrew.</P>
<P>Baisemeaux entered first and opened the second door himself.
By the light which filtered through the iron-barred window,
could be seen a handsome young man, short in stature, with
closely cut hair, and a beard beginning to grow; he was
sitting on a stool, his elbow resting on an armchair, and
all the upper part of his body reclining against it. His
dress, thrown upon the bed, was of rich black velvet, and he
inhaled the fresh air which blew in upon his breast through
a shirt of the very finest cambric. As the governor entered,
the young man turned his head with a look full of
indifference; and on recognizing Baisemeaux, he arose and
saluted him courteously. But when his eyes fell upon Aramis,
who remained in the background, the latter trembled, turned
pale, and his hat, which he held in his hand, fell upon the
ground, as if all his muscles had become relaxed at once.
Baisemeaux, habituated to the presence of his prisoner, did
not seem to share any of the sensations which Aramis
experienced, but, with all the zeal of a good servant, he
busied himself in arranging on the table the pasty and
crawfish he had brought with him. Occupied in this manner,
he did not remark how disturbed his guest had become. When
he had finished, however, he turned to the young prisoner
and said: &quot;You are looking very well,  -  are you so?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Quite well, I thank you, monsieur,&quot; replied the young man.</P>
<P>The effect of the voice was such as almost to overpower
Aramis, and notwithstanding his control over himself, he
advanced a few steps towards him, with his eyes wide open
and his lips trembling. The movement he made was so marked
that Baisemeaux, notwithstanding his preoccupation, observed
it. &quot;This gentleman is an architect who has come to examine
your chimney,&quot; said Baisemeaux, &quot;does it smoke?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Never, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You were saying just now,&quot; said the governor, rubbing his
hands together, &quot;that it was not possible for a man to be
happy in prison; here, however, is one who is so. You have
nothing to complain of, I hope?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you ever feel weary?&quot; said Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;Never.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ha, ha,&quot; said Baisemeaux, in a low tone of voice; &quot;was I
right?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, my dear governor, it is impossible not to yield to
evidence. Is it allowed to put any question to him?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As many as you like.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well; be good enough to ask him if he knows why he is
here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This gentleman requests me to ask you,&quot; said Baisemeaux,
&quot;if you are aware of the cause of your imprisonment?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, monsieur,&quot; said the young man, unaffectedly, &quot;I am
not.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is hardly possible,&quot; said Aramis, carried away by his
feelings in spite of himself; &quot;if you were really ignorant
of the cause of your detention, you would be furious.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I was so during the early days of my imprisonment.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why are you not so now?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because I have reflected.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is strange,&quot; said Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;Is it not odd?&quot; said Baisemeaux.</P>
<P>&quot;May one venture to ask you, monsieur, on what you have
reflected?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I felt that as I had committed no crime, Heaven could not
punish me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is a prison, then,&quot; inquired Aramis, &quot;if it be not a
punishment?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Alas! I cannot tell, said the young man; &quot;all that I can
tell you now is the very opposite of what I felt seven years
ago.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To hear you converse, to witness your resignation, one
might almost believe that you liked your imprisonment?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I endure it.</P>
<P>&quot;In the certainty of recovering your freedom some day, I
suppose?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have no certainty; hope I have, and that is all; and yet
I acknowledge that this hope becomes less every day.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Still, why should you not again be free, since you have
already been so?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is precisely the reason,&quot; replied the young man,
&quot;which prevents me expecting liberty; why should I have been
imprisoned at all if it had been intended to release me
afterwards?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How old are you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do not know.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is your name?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have forgotten the name by which I was called.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who are your parents?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I never knew them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But those who brought you up?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They did not call me their son.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Did you ever love any one before coming here?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I loved my nurse, and my flowers.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Was that all?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I also loved my valet.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you regret your nurse and your valet?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I wept very much when they died.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Did they die since you have been here, or before you came?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They died the evening before I was carried off.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Both at the same time?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, both at the same time.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In what manner were you carried off?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A man came for me, directed me to get into a carriage,
which was closed and locked, and brought me here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Would you be able to recognize that man again?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He was masked.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is not this an extraordinary tale?&quot; said Baisemeaux, in a
low tone of voice, to Aramis, who could hardly breathe.</P>
<P>&quot;It is indeed extraordinary,&quot; he murmured.</P>
<P>&quot;But what is still more extraordinary is, that he has never
told me so much as he has just told you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps the reason may be that you have never questioned
him,&quot; said Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;It's possible,&quot; replied Baisemeaux; &quot;I have no curiosity.
Have you looked at the room? it's a fine one, is it not?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very much so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A carpet  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Beautiful.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'll wager he had nothing like it before he came here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I think so, too.&quot; And then again turning towards the young
man, he said, &quot;Do you not remember to have been visited at
some time or another by a strange lady or gentleman?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, indeed; thrice by a woman, who each time came to the
door in a carriage, and entered covered with a veil, which
she raised when we were together and alone.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you remember that woman?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What did she say to you?&quot;</P>
<P>The young man smiled mournfully, and then replied, &quot;She
inquired, as you have just done, if I were happy, and if I
were getting weary?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What did she do on arriving, and on leaving you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;She pressed me in her arms, held me in her embrace, and
kissed me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you remember her?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Perfectly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you recall her features distinctly?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You would recognize her, then, if accident brought her
before you, or led you into her presence?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Most certainly.&quot;</P>
<P>A flush of fleeting satisfaction passed across Aramis's
face. At this moment Baisemeaux heard the jailer
approaching. &quot;Shall we leave?&quot; he said, hastily, to Aramis.</P>
<P>Aramis, who probably had learnt all that he cared to know,
replied, &quot;When you like.&quot;</P>
<P>The young man saw them prepare to leave, and saluted them
politely. Baisemeaux replied merely by a nod of the head,
while Aramis, with a respect, arising perhaps from the sight
of such misfortune, saluted the prisoner profoundly. They
left the room, Baisemeaux closing the door behind them.</P>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot; said Baisemeaux, as they descended the staircase,
&quot;what do you think of it all?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have discovered the secret, my dear governor,&quot; he said.</P>
<P>&quot;Bah! what is the secret, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A murder was committed in that house.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nonsense.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But attend; the valet and nurse died the same day.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And by poison. What do you think?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That it is very likely to be true.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What! that that young man is an assassin?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who said that? What makes you think that poor young fellow
could be an assassin?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The very thing I was saying. A crime was committed in his
house,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;and that was quite sufficient; perhaps
he saw the criminals, and it was feared that he might say
something.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The deuce! if I only thought that  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I would redouble the surveillance.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, he does not seem to wish to escape.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You do not know what prisoners are.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Has he any books?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;None; they are strictly prohibited, and under M. de
Mazarin's own hand.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Have you the writing still?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, my lord; would you like to look at it as you return to
take your cloak?</P>
<P>&quot;I should, for I like to look at autographs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, this one is of the most unquestionable
authenticity; there is only one erasure.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, ah! an erasure; and in what respect?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;With respect to a figure. At first there was written: `To
be boarded at fifty francs.'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As princes of the blood, in fact?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But the cardinal must have seen his mistake, you
understand; for he canceled the zero, and has added a one
before the five. But, by the by  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You do not speak of the resemblance.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do not speak of it, dear M. de Baisemeaux, for a very
simple reason  -  because it does not exist.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The deuce it doesn't.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Or, if it does exist, it is only in your own imagination;
but, supposing it were to exist elsewhere, I think it would
be better for you not to speak about it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Really.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The king, Louis XIV.  -  you understand  -  would be
excessively angry with you, if he were to learn that you
contributed in any way to spread the report that one of his
subjects has the effrontery to resemble him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is true, quite true,&quot; said Baisemeaux, thoroughly
alarmed; &quot;but I have not spoken of the circumstance to any
one but yourself, and you understand, monseigneur, that I
perfectly rely on your discretion.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, be easy.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you still wish to see the note?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</P>
<P>While engaged in this manner in conversation, they had
returned to the governor's apartments; Baisemeaux took from
the cupboard a private register, like the one he had already
shown Aramis, but fastened by a lock, the key which opened
it being one of a small bunch of keys which Baisemeaux
always carried with him. Then placing the book upon the
table, he opened it at the letter &quot;M,&quot; and showed Aramis the
following note in the column of observations: &quot;No books at
any time; all linen and clothes of the finest and best
quality to be procured; no exercise; always the same jailer;
no communications with any one. Musical instruments; every
liberty and every indulgence which his welfare may require,
to be boarded at fifteen francs. M. de Baisemeaux can claim
more if the fifteen francs be not sufficient.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah,&quot; said Baisemeaux, &quot;now I think of it, I shall claim
it.&quot;</P>
<P>Aramis shut the book. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;it is indeed M. de
Mazarin's handwriting; I recognize it well. Now, my dear
governor,&quot; he continued, as if this last communication had
exhausted his interest, &quot;let us now turn to our own little
affairs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, what time for repayment do you wish me to take? Fix
it yourself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There need not be any particular period fixed; give me a
simple acknowledgment for one hundred and fifty thousand
francs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When to be made payable?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When I require it; but, you understand, I shall only wish
it when you yourself do.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, I am quite easy on that score,&quot; said Baisemeaux,
smiling; &quot;but I have already given you two receipts.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Which I now destroy,&quot; said Aramis; and after having shown
the two receipts to Baisemeaux, he destroyed them. Overcome
by so great a mark of confidence, Baisemeaux unhesitatingly
wrote out an acknowledgment of a debt of one hundred and
fifty thousand francs, payable at the pleasure of the
prelate. Aramis, who had, by glancing over the governor's
shoulder, followed the pen as he wrote, put the
acknowledgment into his pocket without seeming to have read
it, which made Baisemeaux perfectly easy. &quot;Now,&quot; said
Aramis, &quot;you will not be angry with me if I were to carry
off one of your prisoners?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;By obtaining his pardon, of course. Have I not already told
you that I took a great interest in poor Seldon?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, quite true, you did so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is your affair; do as you think proper. I see you have
an open hand, and an arm that can reach a great way.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Adieu, adieu.&quot; And Aramis left, carrying with him the
governor's best wishes.</P></div>
