<BLOCKQUOTE>
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;<BR>
     They pursued it with forks and hope;<BR>
They threatened its life with a railway-share;<BR>
     They charmed it with smiles and soap.
<P>
Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan<BR>
     For making a separate sally;<BR>
And fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,<BR>
     A dismal and desolate valley.
<P>
But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:<BR>
     It had chosen the very same place:<BR>
Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,<BR>
     The disgust that appeared in his face.
<P>
Each thought he was thinking of nothing but "Snark"<BR>
     And the glorious work of the day;<BR>
And each tried to pretend that he did not remark<BR>
     That the other was going that way.
<P>
But the valley grew narrow and narrower still,<BR>
     And the evening got darker and colder,<BR>
Till (merely from nervousness, not from goodwill)<BR>
     They marched along shoulder to shoulder.
<P>
Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,<BR>
     And they knew that some danger was near:<BR>
The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,<BR>
     And even the Butcher felt queer.
<P>
He thought of his childhood, left far far behind--<BR>
     That blissful and innocent state--<BR>
The sound so exactly recalled to his mind<BR>
     A pencil that squeaks on a slate!
<P>
"'Tis the voice of the Jubjub!" he suddenly cried.<BR>
     (This man, that they used to call "Dunce.")<BR>
"As the Bellman would tell you," he added with pride,<BR>
     "I have uttered that sentiment once.
<P>
"'Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat;<BR>
     You will find I have told it you twice.<BR>
'Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete,<BR>
     If only I've stated it thrice."
<P>
The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,<BR>
     Attending to every word:<BR>
But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair,<BR>
     When the third repetition occurred.
<P>
It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,<BR>
     It had somehow contrived to lose count,<BR>
And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains<BR>
     By reckoning up the amount.
<P>
"Two added to one--if that could but be done,"<BR>
     It said, "with one's fingers and thumbs!"<BR>
Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years,<BR>
     It had taken no pains with its sums.
<P>
"The thing can be done," said the Butcher, "I think.<BR>
     The thing must be done, I am sure.<BR>
The thing shall be done!  Bring me paper and ink,<BR>
     The best there is time to procure."
<P>
The Beaver brought paper,portfolio, pens,<BR>
     And ink in unfailing supplies:<BR>
While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,<BR>
     And watched them with wondering eyes.
<P>
So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,<BR>
     As he wrote with a pen in each hand,<BR>
And explained all the while in a popular style<BR>
     Which the Beaver could well understand.
<P>
"Taking Three as the subject to reason about--<BR>
     A convenient number to state--<BR>
We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out<BR>
     By One Thousand diminished by Eight.
<P>
"The result we proceed to divide, as you see,<BR>
     By Nine Hundred and Ninety Two:<BR>
Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be<BR>
     Exactly and perfectly true.
<P>
"The method employed I would gladly explain,<BR>
     While I have it so clear in my head,<BR>
If I had but the time and you had but the brain--<BR>
     But much yet remains to be said.
<P>
"In one moment I've seen what has hitherto been<BR>
     Enveloped in absolute mystery,<BR>
And without extra charge I will give you at large<BR>
     A Lesson in Natural History."
<P>
In his genial way he proceeded to say<BR>
     (Forgetting all laws of propriety,<BR>
And that giving instruction, without introduction,<BR>
     Would have caused quite a thrill in Society),
<P>
"As to temper the Jubjub's a desperate bird,<BR>
     Since it lives in perpetual passion:<BR>
Its taste in costume is entirely absurd--<BR>
     It is ages ahead of the fashion:
<P>
"But it knows any friend it has met once before:<BR>
     It never will look at a bride:<BR>
And in charity-meetings it stands at the door,<BR>
     And collects--though it does not subscribe.
<P>
" Its flavor when cooked is more exquisite far<BR>
     Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs:<BR>
(Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,<BR>
     And some, in mahogany kegs:)
<P>
"You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:<BR>
     You condense it with locusts and tape:<BR>
Still keeping one principal object in view--<BR>
     To preserve its symmetrical shape."
<P>
The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,<BR>
     But he felt that the lesson must end,<BR>
And he wept with delight in attempting to say<BR>
     He considered the Beaver his friend.
<P>
While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks<BR>
     More eloquent even than tears,<BR>
It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books<BR>
     Would have taught it in seventy years.
<P>
They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned<BR>
     (For a moment) with noble emotion,<BR>
Said "This amply repays all the wearisome days<BR>
     We have spent on the billowy ocean!"
<P>
Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,<BR>
     Have seldom if ever been known;<BR>
In winter or summer, 'twas always the same--<BR>
     You could never meet either alone.
<P>
And when quarrels arose--as one frequently finds<BR>
     Quarrels will, spite of every endeavor--<BR>
The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds,<BR>
     And cemented their friendship for ever!
