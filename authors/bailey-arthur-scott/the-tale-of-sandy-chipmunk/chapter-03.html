<p>Nuts and grains were what Sandy Chipmunk ate more than anything else. But
sometimes when he could not find enough of those, or when he wanted a
change of food, he would eat almost any sort of berry, and apples and
pears as well. Tomatoes, too, he liked once in a while. And he was very
fond of sunflower seeds. He would not refuse a fat insect, either, if it
flew his way. But these were not the only dainties that Sandy thought
good. There was something else--something to be found in trees--for which
Sandy sometimes hunted. And before he came home, after finding what he
was looking for, he always wiped his mouth with great care.
</p>
<p>If you had ever seen him wiping his mouth like that, you might have
guessed that Sandy Chipmunk had been eating birds' eggs. And the reason
he was so careful to remove all signs of his feast was because he did not
want his mother to know what he had been doing.
</p><p>Now you have heard the worst there is to know about Sandy Chipmunk.
</p><p>To you it may seem odd that Mrs. Chipmunk did not think it wrong to rob
birds' nests. And now you know the worst about <u>her</u>.
</p><p>Sandy's mother liked eggs just as much as he did. But her son was such
a little fellow that she was afraid he might get hurt climbing trees
and looking for eggs. She told him that some day some bird might
surprise him when he was enjoying a meal of her eggs, and peck out one
or two of his eyes.
</p><p>"Keep away from the nests!" Mrs. Chipmunk said.
</p><p>But Sandy had had too many tastes of birds' eggs. He simply couldn't
resist eating a few eggs now and then. Of course, when he did that he
disobeyed his mother. And of course, if she had known it she would have
punished him.
</p><p>As the spring days sped past, the birds that lived in Farmer Green's
pasture grew very angry with Sandy Chipmunk. You see, it was not
long before they discovered who it was that was robbing their nests
now and then.
</p><p>"You'd better leave birds' eggs alone!" Mr. Crow warned him one day. "A
number of my friends have told me what they're going to do to you, if
they catch you near their nests."
</p><p>But Sandy told Mr. Crow to keep his advice to himself.
</p><p>"What about Farmer Green's corn?" Sandy asked the old gentleman. "I've
heard that Farmer Green is looking for you with a gun."
</p><p>Mr. Crow didn't even answer him. He just flew away. There were some
things he didn't like to talk about.
</p><p>That very afternoon Sandy Chipmunk spied a robin's nest in a tree not far
from where he lived. And in less time than it takes to tell it, he had
climbed the tree and run out on the limb where the nest rested.
</p><p>Sandy Chipmunk smiled as he peered into the robin's nest. The four
greenish-blue eggs that he saw there looked very good to him. And he
smacked his lips--though his mother had often told him not to. He was
just picking the eggs out of the nest when he heard a rustle in the
leaves over his head. And Sandy Chipmunk looked up quickly.
</p><p>It seemed to him, at first, that the air was full of monstrous birds.
Actually, there were only three of them--Mr. and Mrs. Robin and a
neighbor of theirs. But to Sandy they looked six times as big as they
really were. <u>That</u> was because they had caught him robbing the nest.
</p><p>He was so startled that he dropped the eggs. They fell back into the
nest--all except one, which broke upon the ground beneath the tree.
</p><p>"Robber!" Mrs. Robin screamed.
</p><p>"Thief!" Mr. Robin roared.
</p><p>"Villain!" their neighbor cried.
</p><p>It is a wonder they didn't fly straight at Sandy and knock him off the
limb.
</p><p>At first he was too frightened to say a word. But when he saw that he
wasn't hurt, Sandy looked down at the broken egg and said:
</p><p>"What a pity!" He meant it, too. For he thought it was a shame to waste a
perfectly good egg like that, when he might have eaten it.
</p><p>"You don't mean you're sorry, do you?" Mrs. Robin asked him.
</p><p>"Certainly I am!" Sandy told her. "I was just counting your eggs. And
when you startled me, I dropped that one. I thought it must be a hawk,
you all made such a noise."
</p><p>"You're sure you weren't going to eat our eggs?" Mr. Robin inquired.
</p><p>"Eat them!" Sandy exclaimed. "Why, my mother has often told me not to eat
birds' eggs."
</p><p>When he heard that, Mr. Robin whispered something to his wife. And then
he said to Sandy Chipmunk:
</p><p>"You go home! And don't let me catch you around this tree again!"
</p><p>Sandy was glad to escape so easily as that. And though he was sorry to
have missed a good meal, there was one thing that made him almost
happy: He didn't have to bother to wipe his mouth before he let his
mother see him.
