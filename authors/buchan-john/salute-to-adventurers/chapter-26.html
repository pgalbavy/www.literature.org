<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I came out of the wood a new being. My wounded arm and my torn
and inflamed limbs were forgotten. I held my head high, and walked
like a free man. It was not that I had slain my enemy and been
delivered from deadly peril, nor had I any clearer light on my
next step. But I had suddenly got the conviction that God was
on my side, and that I need not fear what man could do unto me.
You may call it the madness of a lad whose body and spirit had
been tried to breaking-point. But, madness or no, it gave me infinite
courage, and in that hour I would have dared every savage on earth.</p>

<p>I found some Indians at the edge of the wood, and told one who
spoke Powhatan the issue of the fight. I flung the broken arrow
on the ground.</p>

<p>"That is my token," I said. "You will find the other in the pool
below the cascade."</p>

<p>Then I strode towards the tents, looking every man I passed squarely
in the eyes. No one spoke, no one hindered me; every face was
like a graven image.</p>

<p>I reached the teepee in which I had spent the night, and flung
myself down on the rude couch. In a minute I was sunk in a heavy
sleep.</p>

<p>I woke to see two men standing in the tent door. One was the
chief Onotawah, and the other a tall Indian who wore no war paint.</p>

<p>They came towards me, and the light fell on the face of the second.
To my amazement I recognized Shalah. He put a finger on his lip,
and, though my heart clamoured for news, I held my peace.</p>

<p>They squatted on a heap of skins and spoke in their own tongue.
Then Shalah addressed me in English.</p>

<p>"The maiden is safe, brother. There will be no more fighting
at the stockade. Those who assaulted us were of my own tribe,
and yesterday I reasoned with them."</p>

<p>Then he spoke to the chief, and translated for me.</p>

<p>"He says that you have endured the ordeal of the stake, and have
slain your enemy in fight, and that now you will go before the
great Sachem for his judgment. That is the custom of our people."</p>

<p>He turned to Onotawah again, and his tone was high and scornful.
He spoke as if he were the chief and the other were the minion,
and, what was strangest of all, Onotawah replied meekly. Shalah
rose to his feet and strode to the door, pointing down the glen
with his hand. He seemed to menace the other, his nostrils quivered
with contempt, and his voice was barbed with passion. Onotawah
bowed his head and said nothing.</p>

<p>Then he seemed to dismiss him, and the proud chief walked out
of the teepee like a disconsolate schoolboy.</p>

<p>Instantly Shalah turned to me and inquired about my wounds. He
looked at the hole in my arm and at my scorched legs, and from
his belt took a phial of ointment, which he rubbed on the former.
He passed his cool hands over my brow, and felt the beating of
my heart.</p>

<p>"You are weary, brother, and somewhat scarred, but there is no
grave hurt. What of the Master?"</p>

<p>I told him of Ringan's end. He bent his head, and then sprang
up and held his hands high, speaking in a strange tongue. I looked
at his eyes, and they were ablaze with fire.</p>

<p>"My people slew him," he cried. "By the shades of my fathers,
a score shall keep him company as slaves in the Great Hunting-ground."</p>

<p>"Talk no more of blood," I said. "He was amply avenged. 'Twas
I who slew him, for he died to save me. He made a Christian end,
and I will not have his memory stained by more murders. But oh,
Shalah, what a man died yonder!"</p>

<p>He made me tell every incident of the story, and he cried out,
impassive though he was, at the sword-play in the neck of the
gorge.</p>

<p>"I have seen it," he cried. "I have seen his bright steel flash
and men go down like ripe fruit. Tell me, brother, did he sing
all the while, as was his custom? Would I had been by his side!"</p>

<p>Then he told me of what had befallen at the stockade.</p>

<p>"The dead man told me a tale, for by the mark on his forehead
I knew that he was of my own house. When you and the Master had
gone I went into the woods and picked up the trail of our foes.
I found them in a crook of the hills, and went among them in peace.
They knew me, and my word was law unto them. No living thing will
come near the stockade save the wild beasts of the forest. Be
at ease in thy mind, brother."</p>

<p>The news was a mighty consolation, but I was still deeply mystified.</p>

<p>"You speak of your tribe. But these men were no Senecas."</p>

<p>He smiled gravely. "Listen, brother," he said. "The white men
of the Tidewater called me Seneca, and I suffered the name. But
I am of a greater and princelier house than the Sons of the Cat.
Some little while ago I spoke to you of the man who travelled
to the Western Seas, and of his son who returned to his own people.
I am the son of him who returned. I spoke of the doings of my
own kin."</p>

<p>"But what is your nation, then?" I cried.</p>

<p>"One so great that these little clanlets of Cherokee and Monacan,
and even the multitudes of the Long House, are but slaves and
horseboys by their side. We dwelt far beyond these mountains towards
the setting sun, in a plain where the rivers are like seas, and
the cornlands wider than all the Virginian manors. But there came
trouble in our royal house, and my father returned to find a generation
which had forgotten the deeds of their forefathers. So he took
his own tribe, who still remembered the House of the Sun, and,
because his heart was unquiet with longing for that which is forbidden
to man, he journeyed eastward, and found a new home in a valley
of these hills. Thine eyes have seen it. They call it the Shenandoah."</p>

<p>I remembered that smiling Eden I had seen from that hill-top,
and how Shalah had spoken that very name.</p>

<p>"We dwelt there," he continued, "while I grew to manhood, living
happily in peace, hunting the buffalo and deer, and tilling our
cornlands. Then the time came when the Great Spirit called for
my father, and I was left with the kingship of the tribe. Strange
things meantime had befallen our nation in the West. Broken clans
had come down from the north, and there had been many battles,
and there had been blight, and storms, and sickness, so that they
were grown poor and harassed. Likewise men had arisen who preached
to them discontent, and other races of a lesser breed had joined
themselves to them. My own tribe had become fewer, for the young
men did not stay in our valley, but drifted back to the West,
to that nation we had come from, or went north to the wars with
the white man, or became lonely hunters in the hills. Then from
the south along the mountain crests came another people, a squat
and murderous people, who watched us from the ridges and bided
their chance."</p>

<p>"The Cherokees?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Even so. I speak of a hundred moons back, when I was yet a stripling,
with little experience in war. I saw the peril, but I could not
think that such a race could vie with the Children of the Sun.
But one black night, in the Moon of Wildfowl, the raiders descended
in a torrent and took us unprepared. What had been a happy people
dwelling with full barns and populous wigwams became in a night
a desolation. Our wives and children were slain or carried captive,
and on every Cherokee belt hung the scalps of my warriors. Some
fled westwards to our nation, but they were few that lived, and
the tribe of Shalah went out like a torch in a roaring river.</p>

<p>"I slew many men that night, for the gods of my fathers guided
my arm. Death I sought, but could not find it; and by and by I
was alone in the woods, with twenty scars and a heart as empty
as a gourd. Then I turned my steps to the rising sun and the land
of the white man, for there was no more any place for me in the
councils of my own people.</p>

<p>"All this was many moons ago, and since then I have been a wanderer
among strangers. While I reigned in my valley I heard of the white
man's magic and of the power of his gods, and I longed to prove
them. Now I have learned many things which were hid from the eyes
of our oldest men. I have learned that a man may be a great brave,
and yet gentle and merciful, as was the Master, I have learned
that a man may be a lover of peace and quiet ways and have no
lust of battle in his heart, and yet when the need comes be more
valiant than the best, even as you, brother. I have learned that
the God of the white men was Himself a man who endured the ordeal
of the stake for the welfare of His enemies. I have seen cruelty
and cowardice and folly among His worshippers; but I have also
seen that His faith can put spirit into a coward's heart, and
make heroes of mean men. I do not grudge my years of wandering.
They have taught me such knowledge as the Sachems of my nation
never dreamed of, and they have given me two comrades after my
own heart. One was he who died yesterday, and the other is now
by my side."</p>

<p>These words of Shalah did not make me proud, for things were
too serious for vanity. But they served to confirm in me my strange
exaltation. I felt as one dedicated to a mighty task.</p>

<p>"Tell me, what is the invasion which threatens the Tidewater?"</p>

<p>"The whole truth is not known to me; but from the speech of my
tribesmen, it seems that the Children of the West Wind, twelve
moons ago, struck their tents and resolved to seek a new country.
There is a restlessness comes upon all Indian peoples once in
every five generations. It fell upon my grandfather, and he travelled
towards the sunset, and now it has fallen upon the whole race
of the Sun. As they were on the eve of journeying there came to
them a prophet, who told them that God would lead them not towards
the West, as was the tradition of the elders, but eastwards to
the sea and the dwellings of the Palefaces."</p>

<p>"Is that the crazy white man we have heard of?"</p>

<p>"He is of your race, brother. What his spell is I know not, but
it works mightily among my people. They tell me that he hath bodily
converse with devils, and that God whispers His secrets to him
in the night-watches. His God hath told him&mdash;so runs the tale&mdash;that
He hath chosen the Children of the Sun for His peculiar people,
and laid on them the charge of sweeping the white men off the
earth and reigning in their stead from the hills to the Great
Waters."</p>

<p>"Do you believe in this madman, Shalah?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I know not," he said, with a troubled face. "I fear one possessed
of God. But of this I am sure, that the road of the Children of
the West Wind lies not eastward but westward, and that no good
can come of war with the white man. This Sachem hath laid his
magic on others than our people, for the Cherokee nation and all
the broken clans of the hills acknowledge him and do his bidding.
He is a soldier as well as a prophet, for he has drilled and disposed
his army like a master of war."</p>

<p>"Will your tribe ally themselves with Cherokee murderers?"</p>

<p>"I asked that question of this man Onotawah, and he liked it
little. He says that his people distrust this alliance with a
race they scorn, and I do not think they pine for the white man's
war. But they are under the magic of this prophet, and presently,
when blood begins to flow, they will warm to their work. In time
they will be broken, but that time will not be soon, and meanwhile
there will be nothing left alive between the hills and the bay
of Chesapeake."</p>

<p>"Do you know their plans?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The Cherokees have served their purpose," he said. "Your forecast
was right, brother. They have drawn the fire of the Border, and
been driven in a rabble far south to the Roanoke and the Carolina
mountains. That is as the prophet planned. And now, while the
white men hang up their muskets and rejoice heedlessly in their
triumph, my nation prepares to strike. To-night the moon is full,
and the prophet makes intercession with his God. To-morrow at
dawn they march, and by twilight they will have swarmed across
the Border."</p>

<p>"Have you no power over your own people?"</p>

<p>"But little," he answered. "I have been too long absent from
them, and my name is half forgotten. Yet, were they free of this
prophet, I think I might sway them, for I know their ways, and
I am the son of their ancient kings. But for the present his magic
holds them in thrall. They listen in fear to one who hath the
ear of God."</p>

<p>I arose, stretched my arms, and yawned.</p>

<p>"They carry me to this Sachem," I said. "Well and good. I will
outface this blasphemous liar, whoever he may be. If he makes
big magic, I will make bigger. The only course is the bold course.
If I can humble this prophet man, will you dissuade your nation
from war and send them back to the sunset?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly," he said wonderingly. "But what is your plan, brother?"</p>

<p>"None," I answered. "God will show me the way. Honesty may trust
in Him as well as madness."</p>

<p>"By my father's shade, you are a man, brother," and he gave me
the Indian salute.</p>

<p>"A very weary, feckless cripple of a man," I said, smiling. "But
the armies of Heaven are on my side, Shalah. Take my pistols and
Ringan's sword. I am going into this business with no human weapons."
And as they set me on an Indian horse and the whole tribe turned
their eyes to the higher glens, I actually rejoiced. Light-hearted
or light-headed, I know not which I was, but I know that I had
no fear.</p>
