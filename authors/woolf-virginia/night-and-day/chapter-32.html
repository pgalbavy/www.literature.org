<p>Nobody asked Katharine any questions next day. If cross-examined
she might have said that nobody spoke to her. She worked a little,
wrote a little, ordered the dinner, and sat, for longer than she
knew, with her head on her hand piercing whatever lay before her,
whether it was a letter or a dictionary, as if it were a film
upon the deep prospects that revealed themselves to her kindling
and brooding eyes. She rose once, and going to the bookcase, took
out her father’s Greek dictionary and spread the sacred pages
of symbols and figures before her. She smoothed the sheets with
a mixture of affectionate amusement and hope. Would other eyes
look on them with her one day? The thought, long intolerable,
was now just bearable.</p>

<p>She was quite unaware of the anxiety with which her movements
were watched and her expression scanned. Cassandra was careful
not to be caught looking at her, and their conversation was so
prosaic that were it not for certain jolts and jerks between the
sentences, as if the mind were kept with difficulty to the rails,
Mrs. Milvain herself could have detected nothing of a suspicious
nature in what she overheard.</p>

<p>William, when he came in late that afternoon and found Cassandra
alone, had a very serious piece of news to impart. He had just
passed Katharine in the street and she had failed to recognize
him.</p>

<p>"That doesn’t matter with me, of course, but suppose it happened
with somebody else? What would they think? They would suspect
something merely from her expression. She looked&mdash;she looked"&mdash;he
hesitated&mdash;"like some one walking in her sleep."</p>

<p>To Cassandra the significant thing was that Katharine had gone
out without telling her, and she interpreted this to mean that
she had gone out to meet Ralph Denham. But to her surprise William
drew no comfort from this probability.</p>

<p>"Once throw conventions aside," he began, "once do the things
that people don’t do&mdash;" and the fact that you are going to meet
a young man is no longer proof of anything, except, indeed, that
people will talk.</p>

<p>Cassandra saw, not without a pang of jealousy, that he was extremely
solicitous that people should not talk about Katharine, as if
his interest in her were still proprietary rather than friendly.
As they were both ignorant of Ralph’s visit the night before they
had not that reason to comfort themselves with the thought that
matters were hastening to a crisis. These absences of Katharine’s,
moreover, left them exposed to interruptions which almost destroyed
their pleasure in being alone together. The rainy evening made
it impossible to go out; and, indeed, according to William’s code,
it was considerably more damning to be seen out of doors than
surprised within. They were so much at the mercy of bells and
doors that they could hardly talk of Macaulay with any conviction,
and William preferred to defer the second act of his tragedy until
another day.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances Cassandra showed herself at her best.
She sympathized with William’s anxieties and did her utmost to
share them; but still, to be alone together, to be running risks
together, to be partners in the wonderful conspiracy, was to her
so enthralling that she was always forgetting discretion, breaking
out into exclamations and admirations which finally made William
believe that, although deplorable and upsetting, the situation
was not without its sweetness.</p>

<p>When the door did open, he started, but braved the forthcoming
revelation. It was not Mrs. Milvain, however, but Katharine herself
who entered, closely followed by Ralph Denham. With a set expression
which showed what an effort she was making, Katharine encountered
their eyes, and saying, "We’re not going to interrupt you," she
led Denham behind the curtain which hung in front of the room
with the relics. This refuge was none of her willing, but confronted
with wet pavements and only some belated museum or Tube station
for shelter, she was forced, for Ralph’s sake, to face the discomforts
of her own house. Under the street lamps she had thought him looking
both tired and strained.</p>

<p>Thus separated, the two couples remained occupied for some time
with their own affairs. Only the lowest murmurs penetrated from
one section of the room to the other. At length the maid came
in to bring a message that Mr. Hilbery would not be home for dinner.
It was true that there was no need that Katharine should be informed,
but William began to inquire Cassandra’s opinion in such a way
as to show that, with or without reason, he wished very much to
speak to her.</p>

<p>From motives of her own Cassandra dissuaded him.</p>

<p>"But don’t you think it’s a little unsociable?" he hazarded.
"Why not do something amusing?&mdash;go to the play, for instance?
Why not ask Katharine and Ralph, eh?" The coupling of their names
in this manner caused Cassandra’s heart to leap with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Don’t you think they must be&mdash;?" she began, but William hastily
took her up.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know nothing about that. I only thought we might amuse
ourselves, as your uncle’s out."</p>

<p>He proceeded on his embassy with a mixture of excitement and
embarrassment which caused him to turn aside with his hand on
the curtain, and to examine intently for several moments the portrait
of a lady, optimistically said by Mrs. Hilbery to be an early
work of Sir Joshua Reynolds. Then, with some unnecessary fumbling,
he drew aside the curtain, and with his eyes fixed upon the ground,
repeated his message and suggested that they should all spend
the evening at the play. Katharine accepted the suggestion with
such cordiality that it was strange to find her of no clear mind
as to the precise spectacle she wished to see. She left the choice
entirely to Ralph and William, who, taking counsel fraternally
over an evening paper, found themselves in agreement as to the
merits of a music-hall. This being arranged, everything else followed
easily and enthusiastically. Cassandra had never been to a music-hall.
Katharine instructed her in the peculiar delights of an entertainment
where Polar bears follow directly upon ladies in full evening
dress, and the stage is alternately a garden of mystery, a milliner’s
band-box, and a fried-fish shop in the Mile End Road. Whatever
the exact nature of the program that night, it fulfilled the highest
purposes of dramatic art, so far, at least, as four of the audience
were concerned.</p>

<p>No doubt the actors and the authors would have been surprised
to learn in what shape their efforts reached those particular
eyes and ears; but they could not have denied that the effect
as a whole was tremendous. The hall resounded with brass and strings,
alternately of enormous pomp and majesty, and then of sweetest
lamentation. The reds and creams of the background, the lyres
and harps and urns and skulls, the protuberances of plaster, the
fringes of scarlet plush, the sinking and blazing of innumerable
electric lights, could scarcely have been surpassed for decorative
effect by any craftsman of the ancient or modern world.</p>

<p>Then there was the audience itself, bare-shouldered, tufted and
garlanded in the stalls, decorous but festal in the balconies,
and frankly fit for daylight and street life in the galleries.
But, however they differed when looked at separately, they shared
the same huge, lovable nature in the bulk, which murmured and
swayed and quivered all the time the dancing and juggling and
love-making went on in front of it, slowly laughed and reluctantly
left off laughing, and applauded with a helter-skelter generosity
which sometimes became unanimous and overwhelming. Once William
saw Katharine leaning forward and clapping her hands with an abandonment
that startled him. Her laugh rang out with the laughter of the
audience.</p>

<p>For a second he was puzzled, as if this laughter disclosed something
that he had never suspected in her. But then Cassandra’s face
caught his eye, gazing with astonishment at the buffoon, not laughing,
too deeply intent and surprised to laugh at what she saw, and
for some moments he watched her as if she were a child.</p>

<p>The performance came to an end, the illusion dying out first
here and then there, as some rose to put on their coats, others
stood upright to salute "God Save the King," the musicians folded
their music and encased their instruments, and the lights sank
one by one until the house was empty, silent, and full of great
shadows. Looking back over her shoulder as she followed Ralph
through the swing doors, Cassandra marveled to see how the stage
was already entirely without romance. But, she wondered, did they
really cover all the seats in brown holland every night?</p>

<p>The success of this entertainment was such that before they separated
another expedition had been planned for the next day. The next
day was Saturday; therefore both William and Ralph were free to
devote the whole afternoon to an expedition to Greenwich, which
Cassandra had never seen, and Katharine confused with Dulwich.
On this occasion Ralph was their guide. He brought them without
accident to Greenwich.</p>

<p>What exigencies of state or fantasies of imagination first gave
birth to the cluster of pleasant places by which London is surrounded
is matter of indifference now that they have adapted themselves
so admirably to the needs of people between the ages of twenty
and thirty with Saturday afternoons to spend. Indeed, if ghosts
have any interest in the affections of those who succeed them
they must reap their richest harvests when the fine weather comes
again and the lovers, the sightseers, and the holiday-makers pour
themselves out of trains and omnibuses into their old pleasure-grounds.
It is true that they go, for the most part, unthanked by name,
although upon this occasion William was ready to give such discriminating
praise as the dead architects and painters received seldom in
the course of the year. They were walking by the river bank, and
Katharine and Ralph, lagging a little behind, caught fragments
of his lecture. Katharine smiled at the sound of his voice; she
listened as if she found it a little unfamiliar, intimately though
she knew it; she tested it. The note of assurance and happiness
was new. William was very happy. She learnt every hour what sources
of his happiness she had neglected. She had never asked him to
teach her anything; she had never consented to read Macaulay;
she had never expressed her belief that his play was second only
to the works of Shakespeare. She followed dreamily in their wake,
smiling and delighting in the sound which conveyed, she knew,
the rapturous and yet not servile assent of Cassandra.</p>

<p>Then she murmured, "How can Cassandra&mdash;" but changed her sentence
to the opposite of what she meant to say and ended, "how could
she herself have been so blind?" But it was unnecessary to follow
out such riddles when the presence of Ralph supplied her with
more interesting problems, which somehow became involved with
the little boat crossing the river, the majestic and careworn
City, and the steamers homecoming with their treasury, or starting
in search of it, so that infinite leisure would be necessary for
the proper disentanglement of one from the other. He stopped,
moreover, and began inquiring of an old boatman as to the tides
and the ships. In thus talking he seemed different, and even looked
different, she thought, against the river, with the steeples and
towers for background. His strangeness, his romance, his power
to leave her side and take part in the affairs of men, the possibility
that they should together hire a boat and cross the river, the
speed and wildness of this enterprise filled her mind and inspired
her with such rapture, half of love and half of adventure, that
William and Cassandra were startled from their talk, and Cassandra
exclaimed, "She looks as if she were offering up a sacrifice!
Very beautiful," she added quickly, though she repressed, in deference
to William, her own wonder that the sight of Ralph Denham talking
to a boatman on the banks of the Thames could move any one to
such an attitude of adoration.</p>

<p>That afternoon, what with tea and the curiosities of the Thames
tunnel and the unfamiliarity of the streets, passed so quickly
that the only method of prolonging it was to plan another expedition
for the following day. Hampton Court was decided upon, in preference
to Hampstead, for though Cassandra had dreamt as a child of the
brigands of Hampstead, she had now transferred her affections
completely and for ever to William <em>III. </em>Accordingly,
they arrived at Hampton Court about lunch-time on a fine Sunday
morning. Such unity marked their expressions of admiration for
the red-brick building that they might have come there for no
other purpose than to assure each other that this palace was the
stateliest palace in the world. They walked up and down the Terrace,
four abreast, and fancied themselves the owners of the place,
and calculated the amount of good to the world produced indubitably
by such a tenancy.</p>

<p>"The only hope for us," said Katharine, "is that William shall
die, and Cassandra shall be given rooms as the widow of a distinguished
poet."</p>

<p>"Or&mdash;" Cassandra began, but checked herself from the liberty
of envisaging Katharine as the widow of a distinguished lawyer.
Upon this, the third day of junketing, it was tiresome to have
to restrain oneself even from such innocent excursions of fancy.
She dared not question William; he was inscrutable; he never seemed
even to follow the other couple with curiosity when they separated,
as they frequently did, to name a plant, or examine a fresco.
Cassandra was constantly studying their backs. She noticed how
sometimes the impulse to move came from Katharine, and sometimes
from Ralph; how, sometimes, they walked slow, as if in profound
intercourse, and sometimes fast, as if in passionate. When they
came together again nothing could be more unconcerned than their
manner.</p>

<p>"We have been wondering whether they ever catch a fish..." or,
"We must leave time to visit the Maze." Then, to puzzle her further,
William and Ralph filled in all interstices of meal-times or railway
journeys with perfectly good-tempered arguments; or they discussed
politics, or they told stories, or they did sums together upon
the backs of old envelopes to prove something. She suspected that
Katharine was absent-minded, but it was impossible to tell. There
were moments when she felt so young and inexperienced that she
almost wished herself back with the silkworms at Stogdon House,
and not embarked upon this bewildering intrigue.</p>

<p>These moments, however, were only the necessary shadow or chill
which proved the substance of her bliss, and did not damage the
radiance which seemed to rest equally upon the whole party. The
fresh air of spring, the sky washed of clouds and already shedding
warmth from its blue, seemed the reply vouchsafed by nature to
the mood of her chosen spirits. These chosen spirits were to be
found also among the deer, dumbly basking, and among the fish,
set still in mid-stream, for they were mute sharers in a benignant
state not needing any exposition by the tongue. No words that
Cassandra could come by expressed the stillness, the brightness,
the air of expectancy which lay upon the orderly beauty of the
grass walks and gravel paths down which they went walking four
abreast that Sunday afternoon. Silently the shadows of the trees
lay across the broad sunshine; silence wrapt her heart in its
folds. The quivering stillness of the butterfly on the half-opened
flower, the silent grazing of the deer in the sun, were the sights
her eye rested upon and received as the images of her own nature
laid open to happiness and trembling in its ecstasy.</p>

<p>But the afternoon wore on, and it became time to leave the gardens.
As they drove from Waterloo to Chelsea, Katharine began to have
some compunction about her father, which, together with the opening
of offices and the need of working in them on Monday, made it
difficult to plan another festival for the following day. Mr.
Hilbery had taken their absence, so far, with paternal benevolence,
but they could not trespass upon it indefinitely. Indeed, had
they known it, he was already suffering from their absence, and
longing for their return.</p>

<p>He had no dislike of solitude, and Sunday, in particular, was
pleasantly adapted for letter-writing, paying calls, or a visit
to his club. He was leaving the house on some such suitable expedition
towards tea-time when he found himself stopped on his own doorstep
by his sister, Mrs. Milvain. She should, on hearing that no one
was at home, have withdrawn submissively, but instead she accepted
his half-hearted invitation to come in, and he found himself in
the melancholy position of being forced to order tea for her and
sit in the drawing-room while she drank it. She speedily made
it plain that she was only thus exacting because she had come
on a matter of business. He was by no means exhilarated at the
news.</p>

<p>"Katharine is out this afternoon," he remarked. "Why not come
round later and discuss it with her&mdash;with us both, eh?"</p>

<p>"My dear Trevor, I have particular reasons for wishing to talk
to you alone.... Where is Katharine?"</p>

<p>"She’s out with her young man, naturally. Cassandra plays the
part of chaperone very usefully. A charming young woman that&mdash;a
great favorite of mine." He turned his stone between his fingers,
and conceived different methods of leading Celia away from her
obsession, which, he supposed, must have reference to the domestic
affairs of Cyril as usual.</p>

<p>"With Cassandra," Mrs. Milvain repeated significantly. "With
Cassandra."</p>

<p>"Yes, with Cassandra," Mr. Hilbery agreed urbanely, pleased at
the diversion. "I think they said they were going to Hampton Court,
and I rather believe they were taking a protege of mine, Ralph
Denham, a very clever fellow, too, to amuse Cassandra. I thought
the arrangement very suitable." He was prepared to dwell at some
length upon this safe topic, and trusted that Katharine would
come in before he had done with it.</p>

<p>"Hampton Court always seems to me an ideal spot for engaged couples.
There’s the Maze, there’s a nice place for having tea &mdash;I
forget what they call it&mdash;and then, if the young man knows his
business he contrives to take his lady upon the river. Full of
possibilities&mdash;full. Cake, Celia?" Mr. Hilbery continued. "I respect
my dinner too much, but that can’t possibly apply to you. You’ve
never observed that feast, so far as I can remember."</p>

<p>Her brother’s affability did not deceive Mrs. Milvain; it slightly
saddened her; she well knew the cause of it. Blind and infatuated
as usual!</p>

<p>"Who is this Mr. Denham?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Ralph Denham?" said Mr. Hilbery, in relief that her mind had
taken this turn. "A very interesting young man. I’ve a great belief
in him. He’s an authority upon our mediaeval institutions, and
if he weren’t forced to earn his living he would write a book
that very much wants writing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is not well off, then?" Mrs. Milvain interposed.</p>

<p>"Hasn’t a penny, I’m afraid, and a family more or less dependent
on him."</p>

<p>"A mother and sisters? &mdash;His father is dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes, his father died some years ago," said Mr. Hilbery, who
was prepared to draw upon his imagination, if necessary, to keep
Mrs. Milvain supplied with facts about the private history of
Ralph Denham since, for some inscrutable reason, the subject took
her fancy.</p>

<p>"His father has been dead some time, and this young man had to
take his place&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A legal family?" Mrs. Milvain inquired. "I fancy I’ve seen the
name somewhere."</p>

<p>Mr. Hilbery shook his head. "I should be inclined to doubt whether
they were altogether in that walk of life," he observed. "I fancy
that Denham once told me that his father was a corn merchant.
Perhaps he said a stockbroker. He came to grief, anyhow, as stockbrokers
have a way of doing. I’ve a great respect for Denham," he added.
The remark sounded to his ears unfortunately conclusive, and he
was afraid that there was nothing more to be said about Denham.
He examined the tips of his fingers carefully. "Cassandra’s grown
into a very charming young woman,"  he started afresh. "Charming
to look at, and charming to talk to, though her historical knowledge
is not altogether profound. Another cup of tea?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Milvain had given her cup a little push, which seemed to
indicate some momentary displeasure. But she did not want any
more tea.</p>

<p>"It is Cassandra that I have come about," she began. "I am very
sorry to say that Cassandra is not at all what you think her,
Trevor. She has imposed upon your and Maggie’s goodness. She has
behaved in a way that would have seemed incredible&mdash;in this house
of all houses&mdash;were it not for other circumstances that are still
more incredible."</p>

<p>Mr. Hilbery looked taken aback, and was silent for a second.</p>

<p>"It all sounds very black," he remarked urbanely, continuing
his examination of his finger-nails. "But I own I am completely
in the dark."</p>

<p>Mrs. Milvain became rigid, and emitted her message in little
short sentences of extreme intensity.</p>

<p>"Who has Cassandra gone out with? William Rodney. Who has Katharine
gone out with? Ralph Denham. Why are they for ever meeting each
other round street corners, and going to music-halls, and taking
cabs late at night? Why will Katharine not tell me the truth when
I question her? I understand the reason now. Katharine has entangled
herself with this unknown lawyer; she has seen fit to condone
Cassandra’s conduct."</p>

<p>There was another slight pause.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, Katharine will no doubt have some explanation to give
me,"  Mr. Hilbery replied imperturbably. "It’s a little too complicated
for me to take in all at once, I confess&mdash;and, if you won’t think
me rude, Celia, I think I’ll be getting along towards Knightsbridge."</p>

<p>Mrs. Milvain rose at once.</p>

<p>"She has condoned Cassandra’s conduct and entangled herself with
Ralph Denham," she repeated. She stood very erect with the dauntless
air of one testifying to the truth regardless of consequences.
She knew from past discussions that the only way to counter her
brother’s indolence and indifference was to shoot her statements
at him in a compressed form once finally upon leaving the room.
Having spoken thus, she restrained herself from adding another
word, and left the house with the dignity of one inspired by a
great ideal.</p>

<p>She had certainly framed her remarks in such a way as to prevent
her brother from paying his call in the region of Knightsbridge.
He had no fears for Katharine, but there was a suspicion at the
back of his mind that Cassandra might have been, innocently and
ignorantly, led into some foolish situation in one of their unshepherded
dissipations. His wife was an erratic judge of the conventions;
he himself was lazy; and with Katharine absorbed, very naturally
&mdash;Here he recalled, as well as he could, the exact nature
of the charge. "She has condoned Cassandra’s conduct and entangled
herself with Ralph Denham." From which it appeared that Katharine
was <em>NOT </em>absorbed, or which of them was it that had entangled
herself with Ralph Denham? From this maze of absurdity Mr. Hilbery
saw no way out until Katharine herself came to his help, so that
he applied himself, very philosophically on the whole, to a book.</p>

<p>No sooner had he heard the young people come in and go upstairs
than he sent a maid to tell Miss Katharine that he wished to speak
to her in the study. She was slipping furs loosely onto the floor
in the drawing-room in front of the fire. They were all gathered
round, reluctant to part. The message from her father surprised
Katharine, and the others caught from her look, as she turned
to go, a vague sense of apprehension.</p>

<p>Mr. Hilbery was reassured by the sight of her. He congratulated
himself, he prided himself, upon possessing a daughter who had
a sense of responsibility and an understanding of life profound
beyond her years. Moreover, she was looking to-day unusual; he
had come to take her beauty for granted; now he remembered it
and was surprised by it. He thought instinctively that he had
interrupted some happy hour of hers with Rodney, and apologized.</p>

<p>"I’m sorry to bother you, my dear. I heard you come in, and thought
I’d better make myself disagreeable at once&mdash;as it seems, unfortunately,
that fathers are expected to make themselves disagreeable. Now,
your Aunt Celia has been to see me; your Aunt Celia has taken
it into her head apparently that you and Cassandra have been&mdash;let
us say a little foolish. This going about together&mdash;these pleasant
little parties&mdash;there’s been some kind of misunderstanding. I
told her I saw no harm in it, but I should just like to hear from
yourself. Has Cassandra been left a little too much in the company
of Mr. Denham?"</p>

<p>Katharine did not reply at once, and Mr. Hilbery tapped the coal
encouragingly with the poker. Then she said, without embarrassment
or apology:</p>

<p>"I don’t see why I should answer Aunt Celia’s questions. I’ve
told her already that I won’t."</p>

<p>Mr. Hilbery was relieved and secretly amused at the thought of
the interview, although he could not license such irreverence
outwardly.</p>

<p>"Very good. Then you authorize me to tell her that she’s been
mistaken, and there was nothing but a little fun in it? You’ve
no doubt, Katharine, in your own mind? Cassandra is in our charge,
and I don’t intend that people should gossip about her. I suggest
that you should be a little more careful in future. Invite me
to your next entertainment."</p>

<p>She did not respond, as he had hoped, with any affectionate or
humorous reply. She meditated, pondering something or other, and
he reflected that even his Katharine did not differ from other
women in the capacity to let things be. Or had she something to
say?</p>

<p>"Have you a guilty conscience?" he inquired lightly. "Tell me,
Katharine," he said more seriously, struck by something in the
expression of her eyes.</p>

<p>"I’ve been meaning to tell you for some time," she said, "I’m
not going to marry William."</p>

<p>"You’re not going&mdash;!" he exclaimed, dropping the poker in his
immense surprise. "Why? When? Explain yourself, Katharine."</p>

<p>"Oh, some time ago&mdash;a week, perhaps more." Katharine spoke hurriedly
and indifferently, as if the matter could no longer concern any
one.</p>

<p>"But may I ask&mdash;why have I not been told of this&mdash;what do you
mean by it?"</p>

<p>"We don’t wish to be married&mdash;that’s all."</p>

<p>"This is William’s wish as well as yours?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. We agree perfectly."</p>

<p>Mr. Hilbery had seldom felt more completely at a loss. He thought
that Katharine was treating the matter with curious unconcern;
she scarcely seemed aware of the gravity of what she was saying;
he did not understand the position at all. But his desire to smooth
everything over comfortably came to his relief. No doubt there
was some quarrel, some whimsey on the part of William, who, though
a good fellow, was a little exacting sometimes&mdash;something that
a woman could put right. But though he inclined to take the easiest
view of his responsibilities, he cared too much for this daughter
to let things be.</p>

<p>"I confess I find great difficulty in following you. I should
like to hear William’s side of the story," he said irritably.
"I think he ought to have spoken to me in the first instance."</p>

<p>"I wouldn’t let him," said Katharine. "I know it must seem to
you very strange," she added. "But I assure you, if you’d wait
a little&mdash;until mother comes back."</p>

<p>This appeal for delay was much to Mr. Hilbery’s liking. But his
conscience would not suffer it. People were talking. He could
not endure that his daughter’s conduct should be in any way considered
irregular. He wondered whether, in the circumstances, it would
be better to wire to his wife, to send for one of his sisters,
to forbid William the house, to pack Cassandra off home&mdash;for he
was vaguely conscious of responsibilities in her direction, too.
His forehead was becoming more and more wrinkled by the multiplicity
of his anxieties, which he was sorely tempted to ask Katharine
to solve for him, when the door opened and William Rodney appeared.
This necessitated a complete change, not only of manner, but of
position also.</p>

<p>"Here’s William," Katharine exclaimed, in a tone of relief. "I’ve
told father we’re not engaged," she said to him. "I’ve explained
that I prevented you from telling him."</p>

<p>William’s manner was marked by the utmost formality. He bowed
very slightly in the direction of Mr. Hilbery, and stood erect,
holding one lapel of his coat, and gazing into the center of the
fire. He waited for Mr. Hilbery to speak.</p>

<p>Mr. Hilbery also assumed an appearance of formidable dignity.
He had risen to his feet, and now bent the top part of his body
slightly forward.</p>

<p>"I should like your account of this affair, Rodney&mdash;if Katharine
no longer prevents you from speaking."</p>

<p>William waited two seconds at least.</p>

<p>"Our engagement is at an end," he said, with the utmost stiffness.</p>

<p>"Has this been arrived at by your joint desire?"</p>

<p>After a perceptible pause William bent his head, and Katharine
said, as if by an afterthought:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>Mr. Hilbery swayed to and fro, and moved his lips as if to utter
remarks which remained unspoken.</p>

<p>"I can only suggest that you should postpone any decision until
the effect of this misunderstanding has had time to wear off.
You have now known each other&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"There’s been no misunderstanding," Katharine interposed. "Nothing
at all." She moved a few paces across the room, as if she intended
to leave them. Her preoccupied naturalness was in strange contrast
to her father’s pomposity and to William’s military rigidity.
He had not once raised his eyes. Katharine’s glance, on the other
hand, ranged past the two gentlemen, along the books, over the
tables, towards the door. She was paying the least possible attention,
it seemed, to what was happening. Her father looked at her with
a sudden clouding and troubling of his expression. Somehow his
faith in her stability and sense was queerly shaken. He no longer
felt that he could ultimately entrust her with the whole conduct
of her own affairs after a superficial show of directing them.
He felt, for the first time in many years, responsible for her.</p>

<p>"Look here, we must get to the bottom of this," he said, dropping
his formal manner and addressing Rodney as if Katharine were not
present. "You’ve had some difference of opinion, eh? Take my word
for it, most people go through this sort of thing when they’re
engaged. I’ve seen more trouble come from long engagements than
from any other form of human folly. Take my advice and put the
whole matter out of your minds&mdash;both of you. I prescribe a complete
abstinence from emotion. Visit some cheerful seaside resort, Rodney."</p>

<p>He was struck by William’s appearance, which seemed to him to
indicate profound feeling resolutely held in check. No doubt,
he reflected, Katharine had been very trying, unconsciously trying,
and had driven him to take up a position which was none of his
willing. Mr. Hilbery certainly did not overrate William’s sufferings.
No minutes in his life had hitherto extorted from him such intensity
of anguish. He was now facing the consequences of his insanity.
He must confess himself entirely and fundamentally other than
Mr. Hilbery thought him. Everything was against him. Even the
Sunday evening and the fire and the tranquil library scene were
against him. Mr. Hilbery’s appeal to him as a man of the world
was terribly against him. He was no longer a man of any world
that Mr. Hilbery cared to recognize. But some power compelled
him, as it had compelled him to come downstairs, to make his stand
here and now, alone and unhelped by any one, without prospect
of reward. He fumbled with various phrases; and then jerked out:</p>

<p>"I love Cassandra."</p>

<p>Mr. Hilbery’s face turned a curious dull purple. He looked at
his daughter. He nodded his head, as if to convey his silent command
to her to leave the room; but either she did not notice it or
preferred not to obey.</p>

<p>"You have the impudence&mdash;" Mr. Hilbery began, in a dull, low
voice that he himself had never heard before, when there was a
scuffling and exclaiming in the hall, and Cassandra, who appeared
to be insisting against some dissuasion on the part of another,
burst into the room.</p>

<p>"Uncle Trevor," she exclaimed, "I insist upon telling you the
truth!"  She flung herself between Rodney and her uncle, as if
she sought to intercept their blows. As her uncle stood perfectly
still, looking very large and imposing, and as nobody spoke, she
shrank back a little, and looked first at Katharine and then at
Rodney. "You must know the truth,"  she said, a little lamely.</p>

<p>"You have the impudence to tell me this in Katharine’s presence?"
Mr. Hilbery continued, speaking with complete disregard of Cassandra’s
interruption.</p>

<p>"I am aware, quite aware&mdash;" Rodney’s words, which were broken
in sense, spoken after a pause, and with his eyes upon the ground,
nevertheless expressed an astonishing amount of resolution. "I
am quite aware what you must think of me," he brought out, looking
Mr. Hilbery directly in the eyes for the first time.</p>

<p>"I could express my views on the subject more fully if we were
alone,"  Mr. Hilbery returned.</p>

<p>"But you forget me," said Katharine. She moved a little towards
Rodney, and her movement seemed to testify mutely to her respect
for him, and her alliance with him. "I think William has behaved
perfectly rightly, and, after all, it is I who am concerned &mdash;I
and Cassandra."</p>

<p>Cassandra, too, gave an indescribably slight movement which seemed
to draw the three of them into alliance together. Katharine’s
tone and glance made Mr. Hilbery once more feel completely at
a loss, and in addition, painfully and angrily obsolete; but in
spite of an awful inner hollowness he was outwardly composed.</p>

<p>"Cassandra and Rodney have a perfect right to settle their own
affairs according to their own wishes; but I see no reason why
they should do so either in my room or in my house.... I wish
to be quite clear on this point, however; you are no longer engaged
to Rodney."</p>

<p>He paused, and his pause seemed to signify that he was extremely
thankful for his daughter’s deliverance.</p>

<p>Cassandra turned to Katharine, who drew her breath as if to speak
and checked herself; Rodney, too, seemed to await some movement
on her part; her father glanced at her as if he half anticipated
some further revelation. She remained perfectly silent. In the
silence they heard distinctly steps descending the staircase,
and Katharine went straight to the door.</p>

<p>"Wait," Mr. Hilbery commanded. "I wish to speak to you&mdash;alone,"
he added.</p>

<p>She paused, holding the door ajar.</p>

<p>"I’ll come back," she said, and as she spoke she opened the door
and went out. They could hear her immediately speak to some one
outside, though the words were inaudible.</p>

<p>Mr. Hilbery was left confronting the guilty couple, who remained
standing as if they did not accept their dismissal, and the disappearance
of Katharine had brought some change into the situation. So, in
his secret heart, Mr. Hilbery felt that it had, for he could not
explain his daughter’s behavior to his own satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Uncle Trevor," Cassandra exclaimed impulsively, "don’t be angry,
please. I couldn’t help it; I do beg you to forgive me."</p>

<p>Her uncle still refused to acknowledge her identity, and still
talked over her head as if she did not exist.</p>

<p>"I suppose you have communicated with the Otways," he said to
Rodney grimly.</p>

<p>"Uncle Trevor, we wanted to tell you," Cassandra replied for
him. "We waited&mdash;" she looked appealingly at Rodney, who shook
his head ever so slightly.</p>

<p>"Yes? What were you waiting for?" her uncle asked sharply, looking
at her at last.</p>

<p>The words died on her lips. It was apparent that she was straining
her ears as if to catch some sound outside the room that would
come to her help. He received no answer. He listened, too.</p>

<p>"This is a most unpleasant business for all parties," he concluded,
sinking into his chair again, hunching his shoulders and regarding
the flames. He seemed to speak to himself, and Rodney and Cassandra
looked at him in silence.</p>

<p>"Why don’t you sit down?" he said suddenly. He spoke gruffly,
but the force of his anger was evidently spent, or some preoccupation
had turned his mood to other regions. While Cassandra accepted
his invitation, Rodney remained standing.</p>

<p>"I think Cassandra can explain matters better in my absence,"
he said, and left the room, Mr. Hilbery giving his assent by a
slight nod of the head.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the dining-room next door, Denham and Katharine
were once more seated at the mahogany table. They seemed to be
continuing a conversation broken off in the middle, as if each
remembered the precise point at which they had been interrupted,
and was eager to go on as quickly as possible. Katharine, having
interposed a short account of the interview with her father, Denham
made no comment, but said:</p>

<p>"Anyhow, there’s no reason why we shouldn’t see each other."</p>

<p>"Or stay together. It’s only marriage that’s out of the question," 
Katharine replied.</p>

<p>"But if I find myself coming to want you more and more?"</p>

<p>"If our lapses come more and more often?"</p>

<p>He sighed impatiently, and said nothing for a moment.</p>

<p>"But at least," he renewed, "we’ve established the fact that
my lapses are still in some odd way connected with you; yours
have nothing to do with me. Katharine," he added, his assumption
of reason broken up by his agitation, "I assure you that we are
in love&mdash;what other people call love. Remember that night. We
had no doubts whatever then. We were absolutely happy for half
an hour. You had no lapse until the day after; I had no lapse
until yesterday morning. We’ve been happy at intervals all day
until <em>I&mdash;</em>went off my head, and you, quite naturally,
were bored."</p>

<p>"Ah," she exclaimed, as if the subject chafed her, "I can’t make
you understand. It’s not boredom &mdash;I’m never bored. Reality&mdash;reality,"
she ejaculated, tapping her finger upon the table as if to emphasize
and perhaps explain her isolated utterance of this word. "I cease
to be real to you. It’s the faces in a storm again&mdash;the vision
in a hurricane. We come together for a moment and we part. It’s
my fault, too. I’m as bad as you are&mdash;worse, perhaps."</p>

<p>They were trying to explain, not for the first time, as their
weary gestures and frequent interruptions showed, what in their
common language they had christened their "lapses"; a constant
source of distress to them, in the past few days, and the immediate
reason why Ralph was on his way to leave the house when Katharine,
listening anxiously, heard him and prevented him. What was the
cause of these lapses? Either because Katharine looked more beautiful,
or more strange, because she wore something different, or said
something unexpected, Ralph’s sense of her romance welled up and
overcame him either into silence or into inarticulate expressions,
which Katharine, with unintentional but invariable perversity,
interrupted or contradicted with some severity or assertion of
prosaic fact. Then the vision disappeared, and Ralph expressed
vehemently in his turn the conviction that he only loved her shadow
and cared nothing for her reality. If the lapse was on her side
it took the form of gradual detachment until she became completely
absorbed in her own thoughts, which carried her away with such
intensity that she sharply resented any recall to her companion’s
side. It was useless to assert that these trances were always
originated by Ralph himself, however little in their later stages
they had to do with him. The fact remained that she had no need
of him and was very loath to be reminded of him. How, then, could
they be in love? The fragmentary nature of their relationship
was but too apparent.</p>

<p>Thus they sat depressed to silence at the dining-room table,
oblivious of everything, while Rodney paced the drawing-room overhead
in such agitation and exaltation of mind as he had never conceived
possible, and Cassandra remained alone with her uncle. Ralph,
at length, rose and walked gloomily to the window. He pressed
close to the pane. Outside were truth and freedom and the immensity
only to be apprehended by the mind in loneliness, and never communicated
to another. What worse sacrilege was there than to attempt to
violate what he perceived by seeking to impart it? Some movement
behind him made him reflect that Katharine had the power, if she
chose, to be in person what he dreamed of her spirit. He turned
sharply to implore her help, when again he was struck cold by
her look of distance, her expression of intentness upon some far
object. As if conscious of his look upon her she rose and came
to him, standing close by his side, and looking with him out into
the dusky atmosphere. Their physical closeness was to him a bitter
enough comment upon the distance between their minds. Yet distant
as she was, her presence by his side transformed the world. He
saw himself performing wonderful deeds of courage; saving the
drowning, rescuing the forlorn. Impatient with this form of egotism,
he could not shake off the conviction that somehow life was wonderful,
romantic, a master worth serving so long as she stood there. He
had no wish that she should speak; he did not look at her or touch
her; she was apparently deep in her own thoughts and oblivious
of his presence.</p>

<p>The door opened without their hearing the sound. Mr. Hilbery
looked round the room, and for a moment failed to discover the
two figures in the window. He started with displeasure when he
saw them, and observed them keenly before he appeared able to
make up his mind to say anything. He made a movement finally that
warned them of his presence; they turned instantly. Without speaking,
he beckoned to Katharine to come to him, and, keeping his eyes
from the region of the room where Denham stood, he shepherded
her in front of him back to the study. When Katharine was inside
the room he shut the study door carefully behind him as if to
secure himself from something that he disliked.</p>

<p>"Now, Katharine," he said, taking up his stand in front of the
fire, "you will, perhaps, have the kindness to explain&mdash;" She
remained silent. "What inferences do you expect me to draw?" he
said sharply.... "You tell me that you are not engaged to Rodney;
I see you on what appear to be extremely intimate terms with another&mdash;with
Ralph Denham. What am I to conclude? Are you," he added, as she
still said nothing, "engaged to Ralph Denham?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied.</p>

<p>His sense of relief was great; he had been certain that her answer
would have confirmed his suspicions, but that anxiety being set
at rest, he was the more conscious of annoyance with her for her
behavior.</p>

<p>"Then all I can say is that you’ve very strange ideas of the
proper way to behave.... People have drawn certain conclusions,
nor am I surprised.... The more I think of it the more inexplicable
I find it,"  he went on, his anger rising as he spoke. "Why am
I left in ignorance of what is going on in my own house? Why am
I left to hear of these events for the first time from my sister?
Most disagreeable&mdash;most upsetting. How I’m to explain to your
Uncle Francis&mdash;but I wash my hands of it. Cassandra goes tomorrow.
I forbid Rodney the house. As for the other young man, the sooner
he makes himself scarce the better. After placing the most implicit
trust in you, Katharine&mdash;" He broke off, disquieted by the ominous
silence with which his words were received, and looked at his
daughter with the curious doubt as to her state of mind which
he had felt before, for the first time, this evening. He perceived
once more that she was not attending to what he said, but was
listening, and for a moment he, too, listened for sounds outside
the room. His certainty that there was some understanding between
Denham and Katharine returned, but with a most unpleasant suspicion
that there was something illicit about it, as the whole position
between the young people seemed to him gravely illicit.</p>

<p>"I’ll speak to Denham," he said, on the impulse of his suspicion,
moving as if to go.</p>

<p>"I shall come with you," Katharine said instantly, starting forward.</p>

<p>"You will stay here," said her father.</p>

<p>"What are you going to say to him?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I suppose I may say what I like in my own house?" he returned.</p>

<p>"Then I go, too," she replied.</p>

<p>At these words, which seemed to imply a determination to go&mdash;to
go for ever, Mr. Hilbery returned to his position in front of
the fire, and began swaying slightly from side to side without
for the moment making any remark.</p>

<p>"I understood you to say that you were not engaged to him," he
said at length, fixing his eyes upon his daughter.</p>

<p>"We are not engaged," she said.</p>

<p>"It should be a matter of indifference to you, then, whether
he comes here or not &mdash;I will not have you listening to other
things when I am speaking to you!" he broke off angrily, perceiving
a slight movement on her part to one side. "Answer me frankly,
what is your relationship with this young man?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that I can explain to a third person," she said obstinately.</p>

<p>"I will have no more of these equivocations," he replied.</p>

<p>"I refuse to explain," she returned, and as she said it the front
door banged to. "There!" she exclaimed. "He is gone!" She flashed
such a look of fiery indignation at her father that he lost his
self-control for a moment.</p>

<p>"For God’s sake, Katharine, control yourself!" he cried.</p>

<p>She looked for a moment like a wild animal caged in a civilized
dwelling-place. She glanced over the walls covered with books,
as if for a second she had forgotten the position of the door.
Then she made as if to go, but her father laid his hand upon her
shoulder. He compelled her to sit down.</p>

<p>"These emotions have been very upsetting, naturally," he said.
His manner had regained all its suavity, and he spoke with a soothing
assumption of paternal authority. "You’ve been placed in a very
difficult position, as I understand from Cassandra. Now let us
come to terms; we will leave these agitating questions in peace
for the present. Meanwhile, let us try to behave like civilized
beings. Let us read Sir Walter Scott. What d’you say to ‘The Antiquary,’
eh? Or ‘The Bride of Lammermoor’?"</p>

<p>He made his own choice, and before his daughter could protest
or make her escape, she found herself being turned by the agency
of Sir Walter Scott into a civilized human being.</p>

<p>Yet Mr. Hilbery had grave doubts, as he read, whether the process
was more than skin-deep. Civilization had been very profoundly
and unpleasantly overthrown that evening; the extent of the ruin
was still undetermined; he had lost his temper, a physical disaster
not to be matched for the space of ten years or so; and his own
condition urgently required soothing and renovating at the hands
of the classics. His house was in a state of revolution; he had
a vision of unpleasant encounters on the staircase; his meals
would be poisoned for days to come; was literature itself a specific
against such disagreeables? A note of hollowness was in his voice
as he read.</p>
