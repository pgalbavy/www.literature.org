<P>
My vision of the scene came abruptly, as I emerged from
the forest.  I found myself on the edge of a large
clear space.  On one side of this space rose up high
bluffs.  On the other side was the river.  The earth
bank ran steeply down to the water, but here and there,
in several places, where at some time slides of earth
had occurred, there were run-ways.  These were the
drinking-places of the Folk that lived in the caves.
<P>
And this was the main abiding-place of the Folk that I
had chanced upon.  This was, I may say, by stretching
the word, the village. My mother and the Chatterer and
I, and a few other simple bodies, were what might be
termed suburban residents.  We were part of the horde,
though we lived a distance away from it.  It was only a
short distance, though it had taken me, what of my
wandering, all of a week to arrive. Had I come
directly, I could have covered the trip in an hour.
<P>
But to return.  From the edge of the forest I saw the
caves in the bluff, the open space, and the run-ways to
the drinking-places. And in the open space I saw many
of the Folk.  I had been straying, alone and a child,
for a week.  During that time I had seen not one of my
kind.  I had lived in terror and desolation. And now,
at the sight of my kind, I was overcome with gladness,
and I ran wildly toward them.
<P>
Then it was that a strange thing happened.  Some one of
the Folk saw me and uttered a warning cry.  On the
instant, crying out with fear and panic, the Folk fled
away.  Leaping and scrambling over the rocks, they
plunged into the mouths of the caves and
disappeared...all but one, a little baby, that had been
dropped in the excitement close to the base of the
bluff.  He was wailing dolefully.  His mother dashed
out; he sprang to meet her and held on tightly as she
scrambled back into the cave.
<P>
I was all alone.  The populous open space had of a
sudden become deserted.  I sat down forlornly and
whimpered.  I could not understand.  Why had the Folk
run away from me? In later time, when I came to know
their ways, I was to learn.  When they saw me dashing
out of the forest at top speed they concluded that I
was being pursued by some hunting animal.  By my
unceremonious approach I had stampeded them.
<P>
As I sat and watched the cave-mouths I became aware
that the Folk were watching me.  Soon they were
thrusting their heads out.  A little later they were
calling back and forth to one another.  In the hurry
and confusion it had happened that all had not gained
their own caves.  Some of the young ones had sought
refuge in other caves.  The mothers did not call for
them by name, because that was an invention we had not
yet made.  All were nameless. The mothers uttered
querulous, anxious cries, which were recognized by the
young ones.  Thus, had my mother been there calling to
me, I should have recognized her voice amongst the
voices of a thousand mothers, and in the same way would
she have recognized mine amongst a thousand.
<P>
This calling back and forth continued for some time,
but they were too cautious to come out of their caves
and descend to the ground. Finally one did come.  He
was destined to play a large part in my life, and for
that matter he already played a large part in the lives
of all the members of the horde.  He it was whom I
shall call Red-Eye in the pages of this history--so
called because of his inflamed eyes, the lids being
always red, and, by the peculiar effect they produced,
seeming to advertise the terrible savagery of him.  The
color of his soul was red.
<P>
He was a monster in all ways.  Physically he was a
giant.  He must have weighed one hundred and seventy
pounds.  He was the largest one of our kind I ever saw.
Nor did I ever see one of the Fire People so large as
he, nor one of the Tree People.  Sometimes, when in the
newspapers I happen upon descriptions of our modern
bruisers and prizefighters, I wonder what chance the
best of them would have had against him.
<P>
I am afraid not much of a chance.  With one grip of his
iron fingers and a pull, he could have plucked a
muscle, say a biceps, by the roots, clear out of their
bodies.  A back-handed, loose blow of his fist could
have smashed their skulls like egg-shells. With a sweep
of his wicked feet (or hind-hands) he could have
disembowelled them.  A twist could have broken their
necks, and I know that with a single crunch of his jaws
he could have pierced, at the same moment, the great
vein of the throat in front and the spinal marrow at
the back.
<P>
He could spring twenty feet horizontally from a sitting
position. He was abominably hairy.  It was a matter of
pride with us to be not very hairy.  But he was covered
with hair all over, on the inside of the arms as well
as the outside, and even the ears themselves.  The only
places on him where the hair did not grow were the
soles of his hands and feet and beneath his eyes.  He
was frightfully ugly, his ferocious grinning mouth and
huge down-hanging under-lip being but in harmony with
his terrible eyes.
<P>
This was Red-Eye.  And right gingerly he crept out or
his cave and descended to the ground.  Ignoring me, he
proceeded to reconnoitre.  He bent forward from the
hips as he walked; and so far forward did he bend, and
so long were his arms, that with every step he touched
the knuckles of his hands to the ground on either side
of him.  He was awkward in the semi-erect position of
walking that he assumed, and he really touched his
knuckles to the ground in order to balance himself.
But oh, I tell you he could run on all-fours! Now this
was something at which we were particularly awkward.
Furthermore, it was a rare individual among us who
balanced himself with his knuckles when walking.  Such
an individual was an atavism, and Red-Eye was an even
greater atavism.
<P>
That is what he was--an atavism.  We were in the
process of changing our tree-life to life on the
ground.  For many generations we had been going through
this change, and our bodies and carriage had likewise
changed.  But Red-Eye had reverted to the more
primitive tree-dwelling type.  Perforce, because he was
born in our horde he stayed with us; but in actuality
he was an atavism and his place was elsewhere.
<P>
Very circumspect and very alert, he moved here and
there about the open space, peering through the vistas
among the trees and trying to catch a glimpse of the
hunting animal that all suspected had pursued me.  And
while he did this, taking no notice of me, the Folk
crowded at the cave-mouths and watched.
<P>
At last he evidently decided that there was no danger
lurking about.  He was returning from the head of the
run-way, from where he had taken a peep down at the
drinking-place.  His course brought him near, but still
he did not notice me.  He proceeded casually on his way
until abreast of me, and then, without warning and with
incredible swiftness, he smote me a buffet on the head.
I was knocked backward fully a dozen feet before I
fetched up against the ground, and I remember,
half-stunned, even as the blow was struck, hearing the
wild uproar of clucking and shrieking laughter that
arose from the caves.  It was a great joke--at least in
that day; and right heartily the Folk appreciated it.
<P>
Thus was I received into the horde.  Red-Eye paid no
further attention to me, and I was at liberty to
whimper and sob to my heart's content.  Several of the
women gathered curiously about me, and I recognized
them.  I had encountered them the preceding year when
my mother had taken me to the hazelnut canyons.
<P>
But they quickly left me alone, being replaced by a
dozen curious and teasing youngsters.  They formed a
circle around me, pointing their fingers, making faces,
and poking and pinching me.  I was frightened, and for
a time I endured them, then anger got the best of me
and I sprang tooth and nail upon the most audacious one
of them--none other than Lop-Ear himself.  I have so
named him because he could prick up only one of his
ears.  The other ear always hung limp and without
movement.  Some accident had injured the muscles and
deprived him of the use of it.
<P>
He closed with me, and we went at it for all the world
like a couple of small boys fighting.  We scratched and
bit, pulled hair, clinched, and threw each other down.
I remember I succeeded in getting on him what in my
college days I learned was called a half-Nelson.  This
hold gave me the decided advantage.  But I did not
enjoy it long.  He twisted up one leg, and with the
foot (or hind-hand) made so savage an onslaught upon my
abdomen as to threaten to disembowel me.  I had to
release him in order to save myself, and then we went
at it again.
<P>
Lop-Ear was a year older than I, but I was several
times angrier than he, and in the end he took to his
heels.  I chased him across the open and down a run-way
to the river.  But he was better acquainted with the
locality and ran along the edge of the water and up
another run-way.  He cut diagonally across the open
space and dashed into a wide-mouthed cave.
<P>
Before I knew it, I had plunged after him into the
darkness.  The next moment I was badly frightened.  I
had never been in a cave before.  I began to whimper
and cry out.  Lop-Ear chattered mockingly at me, and,
springing upon me unseen, tumbled me over. He did not
risk a second encounter, however, and took himself off.
I was between him and the entrance, and he did not pass
me; yet he seemed to have gone away.  I listened, but
could get no clew as to where he was.  This puzzled me,
and when I regained the outside I sat down to watch.
<P>
He never came out of the entrance, of that I was
certain; yet at the end of several minutes he chuckled
at my elbow.  Again I ran after him, and again he ran
into the cave; but this time I stopped at the mouth.  I
dropped back a short distance and watched.  He did not
come out, yet, as before, he chuckled at my elbow and
was chased by me a third time into the cave.
<P>
This performance was repeated several times.  Then I
followed him into the cave, where I searched vainly for
him.  I was curious.  I could not understand how he
eluded me.  Always he went into the cave, never did he
come out of it, yet always did he arrive there at my
elbow and mock me.  Thus did our fight transform itself
into a game of hide and seek.
<P>
All afternoon, with occasional intervals, we kept it
up, and a playful, friendly spirit arose between us.
In the end, he did not run away from me, and we sat
together with our arms around each other.  A little
later he disclosed the mystery of the wide-mouthed
cave.  Holding me by the hand he led me inside.  It
connected by a narrow crevice with another cave, and it
was through this that we regained the open air.
<P>
We were now good friends.  When the other young ones
gathered around to tease, he joined with me in
attacking them; and so viciously did we behave that
before long I was let alone.  Lop-Ear made me
acquainted with the village.  There was little that he
could tell me of conditions and customs--he had not the
necessary vocabulary; but by observing his actions I
learned much, and also he showed me places and things.
<P>
He took me up the open space, between the caves and the
river, and into the forest beyond, where, in a grassy
place among the trees, we made a meal of stringy-rooted
carrots.  After that we had a good drink at the river
and started up the run-way to the caves.
<P>
It was in the run-way that we came upon Red-Eye again.
The first I knew, Lop-Ear had shrunk away to one side
and was crouching low against the bank.  Naturally and
involuntarily, I imitated him. Then it was that I
looked to see the cause of his fear.  It was Red-Eye,
swaggering down the centre of the run-way and scowling
fiercely with his inflamed eyes.  I noticed that all
the youngsters shrank away from him as we had done,
while the grown-ups regarded him with wary eyes when
he drew near, and stepped aside to give him the centre
of the path.
<P>
As twilight came on, the open space was deserted.  The
Folk were seeking the safety of the caves.  Lop-Ear led
the way to bed. High up the bluff we climbed, higher
than all the other caves, to a tiny crevice that could
not be seen from the ground.  Into this Lop-Ear
squeezed.  I followed with difficulty, so narrow was
the entrance, and found myself in a small rock-chamber.
It was very low--not more than a couple of feet in
height, and possibly three feet by four in width and
length.  Here, cuddled together in each other's arms,
we slept out the night.
