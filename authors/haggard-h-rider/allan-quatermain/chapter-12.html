<p>The big rowing-boat glided on up the cutting that ran almost to the foot
of the vast stairway, and then halted at a flight of steps leading to
the landing-place. Here the old gentleman disembarked, and invited us to
do so likewise, which, having no alternative, and being nearly starved,
we did without hesitation--taking our rifles with us, however. As each
of us landed, our guide again laid his fingers on his lips and bowed
deeply, at the same time ordering back the crowds which had assembled to
gaze on us. The last to leave the canoe was the girl we had picked out
of the water, for whom her companion was waiting. Before she went away
she kissed my hand, I suppose as a token of gratitude for having saved
her from the fury of the hippopotamus; and it seemed to me that she had
by this time quite got over any fear she might have had of us, and was
by no means anxious to return in such a hurry to her lawful owners. At
any rate, she was going to kiss Good’s hand as well as mine, when the
young man interfered and led her off. As soon as we were on shore, a
number of the men who had rowed the big boat took possession of our few
goods and chattels, and started with them up the splendid staircase,
our guide indicating to us by means of motions that the things were
perfectly safe. This done, he turned to the right and led the way to
a small house, which was, as I afterwards discovered, an inn. Entering
into a good-sized room, we saw that a wooden table was already furnished
with food, presumably in preparation for us. Here our guide motioned
us to be seated on a bench that ran the length of the table. We did
not require a second invitation, but at once fell to ravenously on the
viands before us, which were served on wooden platters, and consisted
of cold goat’s-flesh, wrapped up in some kind of leaf that gave it a
delicious flavour, green vegetables resembling lettuces, brown bread,
and red wine poured from a skin into horn mugs. This wine was peculiarly
soft and good, having something of the flavour of Burgundy. Twenty
minutes after we sat down at that hospitable board we rose from it,
feeling like new men. After all that we had gone through we needed two
things, food and rest, and the food of itself was a great blessing to
us. Two girls of the same charming cast of face as the first whom we had
seen waited on us while we ate, and very nicely they did it. They were
also dressed in the same fashion namely, in a white linen petticoat
coming to the knee, and with the toga-like garment of brown cloth,
leaving bare the right arm and breast. I afterwards found out that
this was the national dress, and regulated by an iron custom, though of
course subject to variations. Thus, if the petticoat was pure white,
it signified that the wearer was unmarried; if white, with a straight
purple stripe round the edge, that she was married and a first or legal
wife; if with a black stripe, that she was a widow. In the same way the
toga, or ‘kaf’, as they call it, was of different shades of colour, from
pure white to the deepest brown, according to the rank of the wearer,
and embroidered at the end in various ways. This also applies to the
‘shirts’ or tunics worn by the men, which varied in material and colour;
but the kilts were always the same except as regards quality. One
thing, however, every man and woman in the country wore as the national
insignia, and that was the thick band of gold round the right arm above
the elbow, and the left leg beneath the knee. People of high rank also
wore a torque of gold round the neck, and I observed that our guide had
one on.
</p>
<p>So soon as we had finished our meal our venerable conductor, who had
been standing all the while, regarding us with inquiring eyes, and our
guns with something as like fear as his pride would allow him to show,
bowed towards Good, whom he evidently took for the leader of the party
on account of the splendour of his apparel, and once more led the way
through the door and to the foot of the great staircase. Here we paused
for a moment to admire two colossal lions, each hewn from a single block
of pure black marble, and standing rampant on the terminations of
the wide balustrades of the staircase. These lions are magnificently
executed, and it is said were sculptured by Rademas, the great prince
who designed the staircase, and who was without doubt, to judge from the
many beautiful examples of his art that we saw afterwards, one of the
finest sculptors who ever lived, either in this or any other country.
Then we climbed almost with a feeling of awe up that splendid stair,
a work executed for all time and that will, I do not doubt, be admired
thousands of years hence by generations unborn unless an earthquake
should throw it down. Even Umslopogaas, who as a general rule made it
a point of honour not to show astonishment, which he considered
undignified, was fairly startled out of himself, and asked if the
‘bridge had been built by men or devils’, which was his vague way of
alluding to any supernatural power. But Alphonse did not care about it.
Its solid grandeur jarred upon the frivolous little Frenchman, who said
that it was all ‘tres magnifique, mais triste--ah, triste!’ and went on
to suggest that it would be improved if the balustrades were <u>gilt</u>.
</p><p>On we went up the first flight of one hundred and twenty steps, across
the broad platform joining it to the second flight, where we paused
to admire the glorious view of one of the most beautiful stretches of
country that the world can show, edged by the blue waters of the lake.
Then we passed on up the stair till at last we reached the top, where we
found a large standing space to which there were three entrances, all
of small size. Two of these opened on to rather narrow galleries or
roadways cut in the face of the precipice that ran round the palace
walls and led to the principal thoroughfares of the city, and were
used by the inhabitants passing up and down from the docks. These were
defended by gates of bronze, and also, as we afterwards learnt, it was
possible to let down a portion of the roadways themselves by withdrawing
certain bolts, and thus render it quite impracticable for an enemy
to pass. The third entrance consisted of a flight of ten curved black
marble steps leading to a doorway cut in the palace wall. This wall was
in itself a work of art, being built of huge blocks of granite to
the height of forty feet, and so fashioned that its face was concave,
whereby it was rendered practically impossible for it to be scaled. To
this doorway our guide led us. The door, which was massive, and made
of wood protected by an outer gate of bronze, was closed; but on our
approach it was thrown wide, and we were met by the challenge of a
sentry, who was armed with a heavy triangular-bladed spear, not unlike a
bayonet in shape, and a cutting sword, and protected by breast and back
plates of skilfully prepared hippopotamus hide, and a small round shield
fashioned of the same tough material. The sword instantly attracted our
attention; it was practically identical with the one in the possession
of Mr Mackenzie which he had obtained from the ill-starred wanderer.
There was no mistaking the gold-lined fretwork cut in the thickness of
the blade. So the man had told the truth after all. Our guide instantly
gave a password, which the soldier acknowledged by letting the iron
shaft of his spear fall with a ringing sound upon the pavement, and we
passed on through the massive wall into the courtyard of the palace.
This was about forty yards square, and laid out in flower-beds full of
lovely shrubs and plants, many of which were quite new to me. Through
the centre of this garden ran a broad walk formed of powdered shells
brought from the lake in the place of gravel. Following this we came
to another doorway with a round heavy arch, which is hung with thick
curtains, for there are no doors in the palace itself. Then came another
short passage, and we were in the great hall of the palace, and once
more stood astonished at the simple and yet overpowering grandeur of the
place.
</p><p>The hall is, as we afterwards learnt, one hundred and fifty feet long by
eighty wide, and has a magnificent arched roof of carved wood. Down
the entire length of the building there are on either side, and at a
distance of twenty feet from the wall, slender shafts of black marble
springing sheer to the roof, beautifully fluted, and with carved
capitals. At one end of this great place which these pillars support is
the group of which I have already spoken as executed by the King Rademas
to commemorate his building of the staircase; and really, when we had
time to admire it, its loveliness almost struck us dumb. The group, of
which the figures are in white, and the rest is black marble, is
about half as large again as life, and represents a young man of
noble countenance and form sleeping heavily upon a couch. One arm is
carelessly thrown over the side of this couch, and his head reposes upon
the other, its curling locks partially hiding it. Bending over him,
her hand resting on his forehead, is a draped female form of such white
loveliness as to make the beholder’s breath stand still. And as for the
calm glory that shines upon her perfect face--well, I can never hope to
describe it. But there it rests like the shadow of an angel’s smile; and
power, love, and divinity all have their part in it. Her eyes are fixed
upon the sleeping youth, and perhaps the most extraordinary thing about
this beautiful work is the success with which the artist has succeeded
in depicting on the sleeper’s worn and weary face the sudden rising of
a new and spiritual thought as the spell begins to work within his mind.
You can see that an inspiration is breaking in upon the darkness of the
man’s soul as the dawn breaks in upon the darkness of night. It is a
glorious piece of statuary, and none but a genius could have conceived
it. Between each of the black marble columns is some such group of
figures, some allegorical, and some representing the persons and wives
of deceased monarchs or great men; but none of them, in our opinion,
comes up to the one I have described, although several are from the hand of
the sculptor and engineer, King Rademas.
</p><p>In the exact centre of the hall was a solid mass of black marble about
the size of a baby’s arm-chair, which it rather resembled in appearance.
This, as we afterwards learnt, was the sacred stone of this remarkable
people, and on it their monarchs laid their hand after the ceremony
of coronation, and swore by the sun to safeguard the interests of the
empire, and to maintain its customs, traditions, and laws. This stone
was evidently exceedingly ancient (as indeed all stones are), and was
scored down its sides with long marks or lines, which Sir Henry said
proved it to have been a fragment that at some remote period in its
history had been ground in the iron jaws of glaciers. There was a
curious prophecy about this block of marble, which was reported among
the people to have fallen from the sun, to the effect that when it was
shattered into fragments a king of alien race should rule over the
land. As the stone, however, looked remarkably solid, the native princes
seemed to have a fair chance of keeping their own for many a long year.
</p><p>At the end of the hall is a dais spread with rich carpets, on which
two thrones are set side by side. These thrones are shaped like great
chairs, and made of solid gold. The seats are richly cushioned, but
the backs are left bare, and on each is carved the emblem of the sun,
shooting out his fiery rays in all directions. The footstools are golden
lions couchant, with yellow topazes set in them for eyes. There are no
other gems about them.
</p><p>The place is lighted by numerous but narrow windows, placed high up,
cut on the principle of the loopholes to be seen in ancient castles, but
innocent of glass, which was evidently unknown here.
</p><p>Such is a brief description of this splendid hall in which we now found
ourselves, compiled of course from our subsequent knowledge of it.
On this occasion we had but little time for observation, for when we
entered we perceived that a large number of men were gathered together
in front of the two thrones, which were unoccupied. The principal among
them were seated on carved wooden chairs ranged to the right and the
left of the thrones, but not in front of them, and were dressed in white
tunics, with various embroideries and different coloured edgings, and
armed with the usual pierced and gold-inlaid swords. To judge from the
dignity of their appearance, they seemed one and all to be individuals
of very great importance. Behind each of these great men stood a small
knot of followers and attendants.
</p><p>Seated by themselves, in a little group to the left of the throne, were
six men of a different stamp. Instead of wearing the ordinary kilt, they
were clothed in long robes of pure white linen, with the same symbol of
the sun that is to be seen on the back of the chairs, emblazoned in gold
thread upon the breast. This garment was girt up at the waist with a
simple golden curb-like chain, from which hung long elliptic plates of
the same metal, fashioned in shiny scales like those of a fish, that, as
their wearers moved, jingled and reflected the light. They were all men
of mature age and of a severe and impressive cast of features, which was
rendered still more imposing by the long beards they wore.
</p><p>The personality of one individual among them, however, impressed us
at once. He seemed to stand out among his fellows and refuse to be
overlooked. He was very old--eighty at least--and extremely tall, with
a long snow-white beard that hung nearly to his waist. His features were
aquiline and deeply cut, and his eyes were grey and cold-looking. The
heads of the others were bare, but this man wore a round cap entirely
covered with gold embroidery, from which we judged that he was a person
of great importance; and indeed we afterwards discovered that he was
Agon, the High Priest of the country. As we approached, all these men,
including the priests, rose and bowed to us with the greatest courtesy,
at the same time placing the two fingers across the lips in salutation.
Then soft-footed attendants advanced from between the pillars, bearing
seats, which were placed in a line in front of the thrones. We three sat
down, Alphonse and Umslopogaas standing behind us. Scarcely had we done
so when there came a blare of trumpets from some passage to the right,
and a similar blare from the left. Next a man with a long white wand
of ivory appeared just in front of the right-hand throne, and cried out
something in a loud voice, ending with the word <u>Nyleptha</u>, repeated
three times; and another man, similarly attired, called out a similar
sentence before the other throne, but ending with the word <u>Sorais</u>,
also repeated thrice. Then came the tramp of armed men from each
side entrance, and in filed about a score of picked and magnificently
accoutred guards, who formed up on each side of the thrones, and let
their heavy iron-handled spears fall simultaneously with a clash upon
the black marble flooring. Another double blare of trumpets, and in
from either side, each attended by six maidens, swept the two Queens of
Zu-Vendis, everybody in the hall rising to greet them as they came.
</p><p>I have seen beautiful women in my day, and am no longer thrown into
transports at the sight of a pretty face; but language fails me when I
try to give some idea of the blaze of loveliness that then broke upon
us in the persons of these sister Queens. Both were young--perhaps
five-and-twenty years of age--both were tall and exquisitely formed;
but there the likeness stopped. One, Nyleptha, was a woman of dazzling
fairness; her right arm and breast bare, after the custom of her people,
showed like snow even against her white and gold-embroidered ‘kaf’, or
toga. And as for her sweet face, all I can say is, that it was one that
few men could look on and forget. Her hair, a veritable crown of gold,
clustered in short ringlets over her shapely head, half hiding the ivory
brow, beneath which eyes of deep and glorious grey flashed out in tender
majesty. I cannot attempt to describe her other features, only the
mouth was most sweet, and curved like Cupid’s bow, and over the whole
countenance there shone an indescribable look of loving-kindness, lit
up by a shadow of delicate humour that lay upon her face like a touch of
silver on a rosy cloud.
</p><p>She wore no jewels, but on her neck, arm, and knee were the usual
torques of gold, in this instance fashioned like a snake; and her dress
was of pure white linen of excessive fineness, plentifully embroidered
with gold and with the familiar symbols of the sun.
</p><p>Her twin sister, Sorais, was of a different and darker type of beauty.
Her hair was wavy like Nyleptha’s but coal-black, and fell in masses
on her shoulders; her complexion was olive, her eyes large, dark, and
lustrous; the lips were full, and I thought rather cruel. Somehow her
face, quiet and even cold as it is, gave an idea of passion in repose,
and caused one to wonder involuntarily what its aspect would be if
anything occurred to break the calm. It reminded me of the deep sea,
that even on the bluest days never loses its visible stamp of power, and
in its murmuring sleep is yet instinct with the spirit of the storm.
Her figure, like her sister’s, was almost perfect in its curves and
outlines, but a trifle more rounded, and her dress was absolutely the
same.
</p><p>As this lovely pair swept onwards to their respective thrones, amid the
deep attentive silence of the Court, I was bound to confess to myself
that they did indeed fulfil my idea of royalty. Royal they were in
every way--in form, in grace, and queenly dignity, and in the barbaric
splendour of their attendant pomp. But methought that they needed no
guards or gold to proclaim their power and bind the loyalty of wayward
men. A glance from those bright eyes or a smile from those sweet lips,
and while the red blood runs in the veins of youth women such as these
will never lack subjects ready to do their biddings to the death.
</p><p>But after all they were women first and queens afterwards, and therefore
not devoid of curiosity. As they passed to their seats I saw both of
them glance swiftly in our direction. I saw, too, that their eyes passed
by me, seeing nothing to charm them in the person of an insignificant
and grizzled old man. Then they looked with evident astonishment on
the grim form of old Umslopogaas, who raised his axe in salutation.
Attracted next by the splendour of Good’s apparel, for a second their
glance rested on him like a humming moth upon a flower, then off it
darted to where Sir Henry Curtis stood, the sunlight from a window
playing upon his yellow hair and peaked beard, and marking the outlines
of his massive frame against the twilight of the somewhat gloomy hall.
He raised his eyes, and they met the fair Nyleptha’s full, and thus for
the first time the goodliest man and woman that it has ever been my lot
to see looked one upon another. And why it was I know not, but I saw the
swift blood run up Nyleptha’s skin as the pink lights run up the morning
sky. Red grew her fair bosom and shapely arm, red the swanlike neck; the
rounded cheeks blushed red as the petals of a rose, and then the crimson
flood sank back to whence it came and left her pale and trembling.
</p><p>I glanced at Sir Henry. He, too, had coloured up to the eyes.
</p><p>‘Oh, my word!’ thought I to myself, ‘the ladies have come on the stage,
and now we may look to the plot to develop itself.’ And I sighed and
shook my head, knowing that the beauty of a woman is like the beauty
of the lightning--a destructive thing and a cause of desolation. By
the time that I had finished my reflections both the Queens were on the
thrones, for all this had happened in about six seconds. Once more the
unseen trumpets blared out, and then the Court seated itself, and Queen
Sorais motioned to us to do likewise.
</p><p>Next from among the crowd whither he had withdrawn stepped forward our
guide, the old gentleman who had towed us ashore, holding by the
hand the girl whom we had seen first and afterwards rescued from the
hippopotamus. Having made obeisance he proceeded to address the Queens,
evidently describing to them the way and place where we had been found.
It was most amusing to watch the astonishment, not unmixed with fear,
reflected upon their faces as they listened to his tale. Clearly they
could not understand how we had reached the lake and been found floating
on it, and were inclined to attribute our presence to supernatural
causes. Then the narrative proceeded, as I judged from the frequent
appeals that our guide made to the girl, to the point where we had shot
the hippopotami, and we at once perceived that there was something
very wrong about those hippopotami, for the history was frequently
interrupted by indignant exclamations from the little group of
white-robed priests and even from the courtiers, while the two Queens
listened with an amazed expression, especially when our guide pointed to
the rifles in our hands as being the means of destruction. And here, to
make matters clear, I may as well explain at once that the inhabitants
of Zu-Vendis are sun-worshippers, and that for some reason or another
the hippopotamus is sacred among them. Not that they do not kill it,
because at a certain season of the year they slaughter thousands--which
are specially preserved in large lakes up the country--and use their
hides for armour for soldiers; but this does not prevent them from
considering these animals as sacred to the sun. {Endnote 11} Now, as ill
luck would have it, the particular hippopotami we had shot were a family
of tame animals that were kept in the mouth of the port and daily fed by
priests whose special duty it was to attend to them. When we shot them
I thought that the brutes were suspiciously tame, and this was, as we
afterwards ascertained, the cause of it. Thus it came about that in
attempting to show off we had committed sacrilege of a most aggravated
nature.
</p><p>When our guide had finished his tale, the old man with the long beard
and round cap, whose appearance I have already described, and who was,
as I have said, the High Priest of the country, and known by the name
of Agon, rose and commenced an impassioned harangue. I did not like the
look of his cold grey eye as he fixed it on us. I should have liked it
still less had I known that in the name of the outraged majesty of his
god he was demanding that the whole lot of us should be offered up as a
sacrifice by means of being burnt alive.
</p><p>After he had finished speaking the Queen Sorais addressed him in a soft
and musical voice, and appeared, to judge from his gestures of dissent,
to be putting the other side of the question before him. Then Nyleptha
spoke in liquid accents. Little did we know that she was pleading for
our lives. Finally, she turned and addressed a tall, soldierlike man of
middle age with a black beard and a long plain sword, whose name, as
we afterwards learnt, was Nasta, and who was the greatest lord in the
country; apparently appealing to him for support. Now when Sir Henry
had caught her eye and she had blushed so rosy red, I had seen that the
incident had not escaped this man’s notice, and, what is more, that
it was eminently disagreeable to him, for he bit his lip and his
hand tightened on his sword-hilt. Afterwards we learnt that he was an
aspirant for the hand of this Queen in marriage, which accounted for it.
This being so, Nyleptha could not have appealed to a worse person, for,
speaking in slow, heavy tones, he appeared to confirm all that the High
Priest Agon had said. As he spoke, Sorais put her elbow on her knee,
and, resting her chin on her hand, looked at him with a suppressed smile
upon her lips, as though she saw through the man, and was determined to
be his match; but Nyleptha grew very angry, her cheek flushed, her eyes
flashed, and she did indeed look lovely. Finally she turned to Agon and
seemed to give some sort of qualified assent, for he bowed at her words;
and as she spoke she moved her hands as though to emphasize what she
said; while all the time Sorais kept her chin on her hand and smiled.
Then suddenly Nyleptha made a sign, the trumpets blew again, and
everybody rose to leave the hall save ourselves and the guards, whom she
motioned to stay.
</p><p>When they were all gone she bent forward and, smiling sweetly, partially
by signs and partially by exclamations made it clear to us that she
was very anxious to know where we came from. The difficulty was how to
explain, but at last an idea struck me. I had my large pocket-book in
my pocket and a pencil. Taking it out, I made a little sketch of a lake,
and then as best I could I drew the underground river and the lake
at the other end. When I had done this I advanced to the steps of the
throne and gave it to her. She understood it at once and clapped her
hands with delight, and then descending from the throne took it to her
sister Sorais, who also evidently understood. Next she took the pencil
from me, and after examining it with curiosity proceeded to make a
series of delightful little sketches, the first representing herself
holding out both hands in welcome, and a man uncommonly like Sir Henry
taking them. Next she drew a lovely little picture of a hippopotamus
rolling about dying in the water, and of an individual, in whom we had
no difficulty in recognizing Agon the High Priest, holding up his
hands in horror on the bank. Then followed a most alarming picture of a
dreadful fiery furnace and of the same figure, Agon, poking us into it
with a forked stick. This picture perfectly horrified me, but I was a
little reassured when she nodded sweetly and proceeded to make a fourth
drawing--a man again uncommonly like Sir Henry, and of two women, in
whom I recognized Sorais and herself, each with one arm around him, and
holding a sword in protection over him. To all of these Sorais, who
I saw was employed in carefully taking us all in--especially
Curtis--signified her approval by nodding.
</p><p>At last Nyleptha drew a final sketch of a rising sun, indicating that
she must go, and that we should meet on the following morning; whereat
Sir Henry looked so disappointed that she saw it, and, I suppose by
way of consolation, extended her hand to him to kiss, which he did with
pious fervour. At the same time Sorais, off whom Good had never taken
his eyeglass during the whole indaba [interview], rewarded him by giving
him her hand to kiss, though, while she did so, her eyes were fixed
upon Sir Henry. I am glad to say that I was not implicated in these
proceedings; neither of them gave <u>me</u> her hand to kiss.
</p><p>Then Nyleptha turned and addressed the man who appeared to be in
command of the bodyguard, apparently from her manner and his frequent
obeisances, giving him very stringent and careful orders; after which,
with a somewhat coquettish nod and smile, she left the hall, followed by
Sorais and most of the guards.
</p><p>When the Queens had gone, the officer whom Nyleptha had addressed
came forward and with many tokens of deep respect led us from the hall
through various passages to a sumptuous set of apartments opening out of
a large central room lighted with brazen swinging lamps (for it was now
dusk) and richly carpeted and strewn with couches. On a table in the
centre of the room was set a profusion of food and fruit, and, what is
more, flowers. There was a delicious wine also in ancient-looking sealed
earthenware flagons, and beautifully chased golden and ivory cups to
drink it from. Servants, male and female, also were there to minister to
us, and whilst we ate, from some recess outside the apartment
</p>
<p>   ‘The silver lute did speak between
    The trumpet’s lordly blowing;’
</p>
<p>and altogether we found ourselves in a sort of earthly paradise which
was only disturbed by the vision of that disgusting High Priest who
intended to commit us to the flames. But so very weary were we with
our labours that we could scarcely keep ourselves awake through the
sumptuous meal, and as soon as it was over we indicated that we desired
to sleep. As a further precaution against surprise we left Umslopogaas
with his axe to sleep in the main chamber near the curtained doorways
leading to the apartments which we occupied respectively, Good and I in
the one, and Sir Henry and Alphonse in the other. Then throwing off our
clothes, with the exception of the mail shirts, which we considered it
safer to keep on, we flung ourselves down upon the low and luxurious
couches, and drew the silk-embroidered coverlids over us.
</p><p>In two minutes I was just dropping off when I was aroused by Good’s
voice.
</p><p>‘I say, Quatermain,’ he said, ‘did you ever see such eyes?’
</p><p>‘Eyes!’ I said, crossly; ‘what eyes?’
</p><p>‘Why, the Queen’s, of course! Sorais, I mean--at least I think that is
her name.’
</p><p>‘Oh, I don’t know,’ I yawned; ‘I didn’t notice them much: I suppose they
are good eyes,’ and again I dropped off.
</p><p>Five minutes or so elapsed, and I was once more awakened.
</p><p>‘I say, Quatermain,’ said the voice.
</p><p>‘Well,’ I answered testily, ‘what is it now?’
</p><p>‘Did you notice her ankle? The shape--’
</p><p>This was more than I could stand. By my bed stood the veldtschoons I had
been wearing. Moved quite beyond myself, I took them up and threw them
straight at Good’s head--and hit it.
</p><p>Afterwards I slept the sleep of the just, and a very heavy sleep it must
be. As for Good, I don’t know if he went to sleep or if he continued to
pass Sorais’ beauties in mental review, and, what is more, I don’t care.
