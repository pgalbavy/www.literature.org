<p>The Russian gentleman was better the next day, and the day after
that better still, and on the third day he was well enough to come
into the garden.  A basket chair was put for him and he sat there,
dressed in clothes of Father's which were too big for him.  But when
Mother had hemmed up the ends of the sleeves and the trousers, the
clothes did well enough.  His was a kind face now that it was no
longer tired and frightened, and he smiled at the children whenever
he saw them.  They wished very much that he could speak English.
Mother wrote several letters to people she thought might know
whereabouts in England a Russian gentleman's wife and family might
possibly be; not to the people she used to know before she came to
live at Three Chimneys - she never wrote to any of them - but strange
people - Members of Parliament and Editors of papers, and Secretaries
of Societies.</p>

<p>And she did not do much of her story-writing, only corrected proofs
as she sat in the sun near the Russian, and talked to him every now
and then.</p>

<p>The children wanted very much to show how kindly they felt to this
man who had been sent to prison and to Siberia just for writing a
beautiful book about poor people.  They could smile at him, of
course; they could and they did.  But if you smile too constantly,
the smile is apt to get fixed like the smile of the hyaena.  And
then it no longer looks friendly, but simply silly.  So they tried
other ways, and brought him flowers till the place where he sat was
surrounded by little fading bunches of clover and roses and
Canterbury bells.</p>

<p>And then Phyllis had an idea.  She beckoned mysteriously to the
others and drew them into the back yard, and there, in a concealed
spot, between the pump and the water-butt, she said: - </p>

<p>&quot;You remember Perks promising me the very first strawberries out of
his own garden?&quot;  Perks, you will recollect, was the Porter.  &quot;Well,
I should think they're ripe now.  Let's go down and see.&quot;</p>

<p>Mother had been down as she had promised to tell the Station Master
the story of the Russian Prisoner.  But even the charms of the
railway had been unable to tear the children away from the
neighbourhood of the interesting stranger.  So they had not been to
the station for three days.</p>

<p>They went now.</p>

<p>And, to their surprise and distress, were very coldly received by
Perks.</p>

<p>&quot;'Ighly honoured, I'm sure,&quot; he said when they peeped in at the door
of the Porters' room.  And he went on reading his newspaper.</p>

<p>There was an uncomfortable silence.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; said Bobbie, with a sigh, &quot;I do believe you're CROSS.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What, me?  Not me!&quot; said Perks loftily; &quot;it ain't nothing to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What AIN'T nothing to you?&quot; said Peter, too anxious and alarmed to
change the form of words.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing ain't nothing.  What 'appens either 'ere or elsewhere,&quot;
said Perks; &quot;if you likes to 'ave your secrets, 'ave 'em and
welcome.  That's what I say.&quot;</p>

<p>The secret-chamber of each heart was rapidly examined during the
pause that followed.  Three heads were shaken.</p>

<p>&quot;We haven't got any secrets from YOU,&quot; said Bobbie at last.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe you 'ave, and maybe you 'aven't,&quot; said Perks; &quot;it ain't
nothing to me.  And I wish you all a very good afternoon.&quot;  He held
up the paper between him and them and went on reading.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, DON'T!&quot; said Phyllis, in despair; &quot;this is truly dreadful!
Whatever it is, do tell us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We didn't mean to do it whatever it was.&quot;</p>

<p>No answer.  The paper was refolded and Perks began on another
column.</p>

<p>&quot;Look here,&quot; said Peter, suddenly, &quot;it's not fair.  Even people who
do crimes aren't punished without being told what it's for - as once
they were in Russia.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know nothing about Russia.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes, you do, when Mother came down on purpose to tell you and
Mr. Gills all about OUR Russian.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can't you fancy it?&quot; said Perks, indignantly; &quot;don't you see 'im a-
asking of me to step into 'is room and take a chair and listen to
what 'er Ladyship 'as to say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you mean to say you've not heard?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not so much as a breath.  I did go so far as to put a question.
And he shuts me up like a rat-trap.  'Affairs of State, Perks,' says
he.  But I did think one o' you would 'a' nipped down to tell me - 
you're here sharp enough when you want to get anything out of old
Perks&quot; - Phyllis flushed purple as she thought of the strawberries - 
&quot;information about locomotives or signals or the likes,&quot; said Perks.</p>

<p>&quot;We didn't know you didn't know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We thought Mother had told you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wewantedtotellyouonlywethoughtitwouldbestalenews.&quot;</p>

<p>The three spoke all at once.</p>

<p>Perks said it was all very well, and still held up the paper.  Then
Phyllis suddenly snatched it away, and threw her arms round his
neck.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, let's kiss and be friends,&quot; she said; &quot;we'll say we're sorry
first, if you like, but we didn't really know that you didn't know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are so sorry,&quot; said the others.</p>

<p>And Perks at last consented to accept their apologies.</p>

<p>Then they got him to come out and sit in the sun on the green
Railway Bank, where the grass was quite hot to touch, and there,
sometimes speaking one at a time, and sometimes all together, they
told the Porter the story of the Russian Prisoner.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I must say,&quot; said Perks; but he did not say it - whatever it
was.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it is pretty awful, isn't it?&quot; said Peter, &quot;and I don't wonder
you were curious about who the Russian was.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wasn't curious, not so much as interested,&quot; said the Porter.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I do think Mr. Gills might have told you about it.  It was
horrid of him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't keep no down on 'im for that, Missie,&quot; said the Porter;
&quot;cos why?  I see 'is reasons.  'E wouldn't want to give away 'is own
side with a tale like that 'ere.  It ain't human nature.  A man's
got to stand up for his own side whatever they does.  That's what it
means by Party Politics.  I should 'a' done the same myself if that
long-'aired chap 'ad 'a' been a Jap.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But the Japs didn't do cruel, wicked things like that,&quot; said
Bobbie.</p>

<p>&quot;P'r'aps not,&quot; said Perks, cautiously; &quot;still you can't be sure with
foreigners.  My own belief is they're all tarred with the same
brush.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then why were you on the side of the Japs?&quot; Peter asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you see, you must take one side or the other.  Same as with
Liberals and Conservatives.  The great thing is to take your side
and then stick to it, whatever happens.&quot;</p>

<p>A signal sounded.</p>

<p>&quot;There's the 3.14 up,&quot; said Perks.  &quot;You lie low till she's through,
and then we'll go up along to my place, and see if there's any of
them strawberries ripe what I told you about.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If there are any ripe, and you DO give them to me,&quot; said Phyllis,
&quot;you won't mind if I give them to the poor Russian, will you?&quot;</p>

<p>Perks narrowed his eyes and then raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>&quot;So it was them strawberries you come down for this afternoon, eh?&quot;
said he.</p>

<p>This was an awkward moment for Phyllis.  To say &quot;yes&quot; would seem
rude and greedy, and unkind to Perks.  But she knew if she said
&quot;no,&quot; she would not be pleased with herself afterwards.  So - </p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;it was.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well done!&quot; said the Porter; &quot;speak the truth and shame the - &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But we'd have come down the very next day if we'd known you hadn't
heard the story,&quot; Phyllis added hastily.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe you, Missie,&quot; said Perks, and sprang across the line six
feet in front of the advancing train.</p>

<p>The girls hated to see him do this, but Peter liked it.  It was so
exciting.</p>

<p>The Russian gentleman was so delighted with the strawberries that
the three racked their brains to find some other surprise for him.
But all the racking did not bring out any idea more novel than wild
cherries.  And this idea occurred to them next morning.  They had
seen the blossom on the trees in the spring, and they knew where to
look for wild cherries now that cherry time was here.  The trees
grew all up and along the rocky face of the cliff out of which the
mouth of the tunnel opened.  There were all sorts of trees there,
birches and beeches and baby oaks and hazels, and among them the
cherry blossom had shone like snow and silver.</p>

<p>The mouth of the tunnel was some way from Three Chimneys, so Mother
let them take their lunch with them in a basket.  And the basket
would do to bring the cherries back in if they found any.  She also
lent them her silver watch so that they should not be late for tea.
Peter's Waterbury had taken it into its head not to go since the day
when Peter dropped it into the water-butt.  And they started.  When
they got to the top of the cutting, they leaned over the fence and
looked down to where the railway lines lay at the bottom of what, as
Phyllis said, was exactly like a mountain gorge.</p>

<p>&quot;If it wasn't for the railway at the bottom, it would be as though
the foot of man had never been there, wouldn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>The sides of the cutting were of grey stone, very roughly hewn.
Indeed, the top part of the cutting had been a little natural glen
that had been cut deeper to bring it down to the level of the
tunnel's mouth.  Among the rocks, grass and flowers grew, and seeds
dropped by birds in the crannies of the stone had taken root and
grown into bushes and trees that overhung the cutting.  Near the
tunnel was a flight of steps leading down to the line - just wooden
bars roughly fixed into the earth - a very steep and narrow way, more
like a ladder than a stair.</p>

<p>&quot;We'd better get down,&quot; said Peter; &quot;I'm sure the cherries would be
quite easy to get at from the side of the steps.  You remember it
was there we picked the cherry blossoms that we put on the rabbit's
grave.&quot;</p>

<p>So they went along the fence towards the little swing gate that is
at the top of these steps.  And they were almost at the gate when
Bobbie said: - </p>

<p>&quot;Hush.  Stop!  What's that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&quot; was a very odd noise indeed - a soft noise, but quite plainly
to be heard through the sound of the wind in tree branches, and the
hum and whir of the telegraph wires.  It was a sort of rustling,
whispering sound.  As they listened it stopped, and then it began
again.</p>

<p>And this time it did not stop, but it grew louder and more rustling
and rumbling.</p>

<p>&quot;Look&quot; - cried Peter, suddenly - &quot;the tree over there!&quot;</p>

<p>The tree he pointed at was one of those that have rough grey leaves
and white flowers.  The berries, when they come, are bright scarlet,
but if you pick them, they disappoint you by turning black before
you get them home.  And, as Peter pointed, the tree was moving - not
just the way trees ought to move when the wind blows through them,
but all in one piece, as though it were a live creature and were
walking down the side of the cutting.</p>

<p>&quot;It's moving!&quot; cried Bobbie.  &quot;Oh, look! and so are the others.
It's like the woods in Macbeth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's magic,&quot; said Phyllis, breathlessly.  &quot;I always knew this
railway was enchanted.&quot;</p>

<p>It really did seem a little like magic.  For all the trees for about
twenty yards of the opposite bank seemed to be slowly walking down
towards the railway line, the tree with the grey leaves bringing up
the rear like some old shepherd driving a flock of green sheep.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?  Oh, what is it?&quot; said Phyllis; &quot;it's much too magic
for me.  I don't like it.  Let's go home.&quot;</p>

<p>But Bobbie and Peter clung fast to the rail and watched
breathlessly.  And Phyllis made no movement towards going home by
herself.</p>

<p>The trees moved on and on.  Some stones and loose earth fell down
and rattled on the railway metals far below.</p>

<p>&quot;It's ALL coming down,&quot; Peter tried to say, but he found there was
hardly any voice to say it with.  And, indeed, just as he spoke, the
great rock, on the top of which the walking trees were, leaned
slowly forward.  The trees, ceasing to walk, stood still and
shivered.  Leaning with the rock, they seemed to hesitate a moment,
and then rock and trees and grass and bushes, with a rushing sound,
slipped right away from the face of the cutting and fell on the line
with a blundering crash that could have been heard half a mile off.
A cloud of dust rose up.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Peter, in awestruck tones, &quot;isn't it exactly like when
coals come in? - if there wasn't any roof to the cellar and you could
see down.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look what a great mound it's made!&quot; said Bobbie.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Peter, slowly.  He was still leaning on the fence.
&quot;Yes,&quot; he said again, still more slowly.</p>

<p>Then he stood upright.</p>

<p>&quot;The 11.29 down hasn't gone by yet.  We must let them know at the
station, or there'll be a most frightful accident.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let's run,&quot; said Bobbie, and began.</p>

<p>But Peter cried, &quot;Come back!&quot; and looked at Mother's watch.  He was
very prompt and businesslike, and his face looked whiter than they
had ever seen it.</p>

<p>&quot;No time,&quot; he said; &quot;it's two miles away, and it's past eleven.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Couldn't we,&quot; suggested Phyllis, breathlessly, &quot;couldn't we climb
up a telegraph post and do something to the wires?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We don't know how,&quot; said Peter.</p>

<p>&quot;They do it in war,&quot; said Phyllis; &quot;I know I've heard of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They only CUT them, silly,&quot; said Peter, &quot;and that doesn't do any
good.  And we couldn't cut them even if we got up, and we couldn't
get up.  If we had anything red, we could get down on the line and
wave it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But the train wouldn't see us till it got round the corner, and
then it could see the mound just as well as us,&quot; said Phyllis;
&quot;better, because it's much bigger than us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If we only had something red,&quot; Peter repeated, &quot;we could go round
the corner and wave to the train.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We might wave, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They'd only think it was just US, as usual.  We've waved so often
before.  Anyway, let's get down.&quot;</p>

<p>They got down the steep stairs.  Bobbie was pale and shivering.
Peter's face looked thinner than usual.  Phyllis was red-faced and
damp with anxiety.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, how hot I am!&quot; she said; &quot;and I thought it was going to be
cold; I wish we hadn't put on our - &quot; she stopped short, and then
ended in quite a different tone - &quot;our flannel petticoats.&quot;</p>

<p>Bobbie turned at the bottom of the stairs.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; she cried; &quot;THEY'RE red!  Let's take them off.&quot;</p>

<p>They did, and with the petticoats rolled up under their arms, ran
along the railway, skirting the newly fallen mound of stones and
rock and earth, and bent, crushed, twisted trees.  They ran at their
best pace.  Peter led, but the girls were not far behind.  They
reached the corner that hid the mound from the straight line of
railway that ran half a mile without curve or corner.</p>

<p>&quot;Now,&quot; said Peter, taking hold of the largest flannel petticoat.</p>

<p>&quot;You're not&quot; - Phyllis faltered - &quot;you're not going to TEAR them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shut up,&quot; said Peter, with brief sternness.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Bobbie, &quot;tear them into little bits if you like.
Don't you see, Phil, if we can't stop the train, there'll be a real
live accident, with people KILLED.  Oh, horrible!  Here, Peter,
you'll never tear it through the band!&quot;</p>

<p>She took the red flannel petticoat from him and tore it off an inch
from the band.  Then she tore the other in the same way.</p>

<p>&quot;There!&quot; said Peter, tearing in his turn.  He divided each petticoat
into three pieces.  &quot;Now, we've got six flags.&quot;  He looked at the
watch again.  &quot;And we've got seven minutes.  We must have
flagstaffs.&quot;</p>

<p>The knives given to boys are, for some odd reason, seldom of the
kind of steel that keeps sharp.  The young saplings had to be broken
off.  Two came up by the roots.  The leaves were stripped from them.</p>

<p>&quot;We must cut holes in the flags, and run the sticks through the
holes,&quot; said Peter.  And the holes were cut.  The knife was sharp
enough to cut flannel with.  Two of the flags were set up in heaps
of loose stones between the sleepers of the down line.  Then Phyllis
and Roberta took each a flag, and stood ready to wave it as soon as
the train came in sight.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall have the other two myself,&quot; said Peter, &quot;because it was my
idea to wave something red.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They're our petticoats, though,&quot; Phyllis was beginning, but Bobbie
interrupted - </p>

<p>&quot;Oh, what does it matter who waves what, if we can only save the
train?&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps Peter had not rightly calculated the number of minutes it
would take the 11.29 to get from the station to the place where they
were, or perhaps the train was late.  Anyway, it seemed a very long
time that they waited.</p>

<p>Phyllis grew impatient.  &quot;I expect the watch is wrong, and the
train's gone by,&quot; said she.</p>

<p>Peter relaxed the heroic attitude he had chosen to show off his two
flags.  And Bobbie began to feel sick with suspense.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that they had been standing there for hours and
hours, holding those silly little red flannel flags that no one
would ever notice.  The train wouldn't care.  It would go rushing by
them and tear round the corner and go crashing into that awful
mound.  And everyone would be killed.  Her hands grew very cold and
trembled so that she could hardly hold the flag.  And then came the
distant rumble and hum of the metals, and a puff of white steam
showed far away along the stretch of line.</p>

<p>&quot;Stand firm,&quot; said Peter, &quot;and wave like mad!  When it gets to that
big furze bush step back, but go on waving!  Don't stand ON the
line, Bobbie!&quot;</p>

<p>The train came rattling along very, very fast.</p>

<p>&quot;They don't see us!  They won't see us!  It's all no good!&quot; cried
Bobbie.</p>

<p>The two little flags on the line swayed as the nearing train shook
and loosened the heaps of loose stones that held them up.  One of
them slowly leaned over and fell on the line.  Bobbie jumped forward
and caught it up, and waved it; her hands did not tremble now.</p>

<p>It seemed that the train came on as fast as ever.  It was very near
now.</p>

<p>&quot;Keep off the line, you silly cuckoo!&quot; said Peter, fiercely.</p>

<p>&quot;It's no good,&quot; Bobbie said again.</p>

<p>&quot;Stand back!&quot; cried Peter, suddenly, and he dragged Phyllis back by
the arm.</p>

<p>But Bobbie cried, &quot;Not yet, not yet!&quot; and waved her two flags right
over the line.  The front of the engine looked black and enormous.
It's voice was loud and harsh.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, stop, stop, stop!&quot; cried Bobbie.  No one heard her.  At least
Peter and Phyllis didn't, for the oncoming rush of the train covered
the sound of her voice with a mountain of sound.  But afterwards she
used to wonder whether the engine itself had not heard her.  It
seemed almost as though it had - for it slackened swiftly, slackened
and stopped, not twenty yards from the place where Bobbie's two
flags waved over the line.  She saw the great black engine stop
dead, but somehow she could not stop waving the flags.  And when the
driver and the fireman had got off the engine and Peter and Phyllis
had gone to meet them and pour out their excited tale of the awful
mound just round the corner, Bobbie still waved the flags but more
and more feebly and jerkily.</p>

<p>When the others turned towards her she was lying across the line
with her hands flung forward and still gripping the sticks of the
little red flannel flags.</p>

<p>The engine-driver picked her up, carried her to the train, and laid
her on the cushions of a first-class carriage.</p>

<p>&quot;Gone right off in a faint,&quot; he said, &quot;poor little woman.  And no
wonder.  I'll just 'ave a look at this 'ere mound of yours, and then
we'll run you back to the station and get her seen to.&quot;</p>

<p>It was horrible to see Bobbie lying so white and quiet, with her
lips blue, and parted.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe that's what people look like when they're dead,&quot;
whispered Phyllis.</p>

<p>&quot;DON'T!&quot; said Peter, sharply.</p>

<p>They sat by Bobbie on the blue cushions, and the train ran back.
Before it reached their station Bobbie had sighed and opened her
eyes, and rolled herself over and begun to cry.  This cheered the
others wonderfully.  They had seen her cry before, but they had
never seen her faint, nor anyone else, for the matter of that.  They
had not known what to do when she was fainting, but now she was only
crying they could thump her on the back and tell her not to, just as
they always did.  And presently, when she stopped crying, they were
able to laugh at her for being such a coward as to faint.</p>

<p>When the station was reached, the three were the heroes of an
agitated meeting on the platform.</p>

<p>The praises they got for their &quot;prompt action,&quot; their &quot;common
sense,&quot; their &quot;ingenuity,&quot; were enough to have turned anybody's
head.  Phyllis enjoyed herself thoroughly.  She had never been a
real heroine before, and the feeling was delicious.  Peter's ears
got very red.  Yet he, too, enjoyed himself.  Only Bobbie wished
they all wouldn't.  She wanted to get away.</p>

<p>&quot;You'll hear from the Company about this, I expect,&quot; said the
Station Master.</p>

<p>Bobbie wished she might never hear of it again.  She pulled at
Peter's jacket.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, come away, come away!  I want to go home,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>So they went.  And as they went Station Master and Porter and guards
and driver and fireman and passengers sent up a cheer.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, listen,&quot; cried Phyllis; &quot;that's for US!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Peter.  &quot;I say, I am glad I thought about something red,
and waving it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How lucky we DID put on our red flannel petticoats!&quot; said Phyllis.</p>

<p>Bobbie said nothing.  She was thinking of the horrible mound, and
the trustful train rushing towards it.</p>

<p>&quot;And it was US that saved them,&quot; said Peter.</p>

<p>&quot;How dreadful if they had all been killed!&quot; said Phyllis; &quot;wouldn't
it, Bobbie?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We never got any cherries, after all,&quot; said Bobbie.</p>

<p>The others thought her rather heartless.</p>
