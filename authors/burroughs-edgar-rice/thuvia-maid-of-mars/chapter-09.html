The distance from the bottom of the funnel to the floor of
the chamber beneath it could not have been great, for all
three of the victims of Tario's wrath alighted unscathed.
<P>
Carthoris, still clasping Thuvia tightly to his breast,
came to the ground catlike, upon his feet, breaking the
shock for the girl.  Scarce had his feet touched the rough
stone flagging of this new chamber than his sword flashed
out ready for instant use.  But though the room was lighted,
there was no sign of enemy about.
<P>
Carthoris looked toward Jav.  The man was pasty white with fear.
<P>
"What is to be our fate?" asked the Heliumite.  "Tell
me, man!  Shake off your terror long enough to tell me,
so I may be prepared to sell my life and that of the
Princess of Ptarth as dearly as possible."
<P>
"Komal!" whispered Jav.  "We are to be devoured by Komal!"
<P>
"Your deity?" asked Carthoris.
<P>
The Lotharian nodded his head.  Then he pointed
toward a low doorway at one end of the chamber.
<P>
"From thence will he come upon us.  Lay aside your
puny sword, fool.  It will but enrage him the more and
make our sufferings the worse."
<P>
Carthoris smiled, gripping his long-sword the more firmly.
<P>
Presently Jav gave a horrified moan, at the same time
pointing toward the door.
<P>
"He has come," he whimpered.
<P>
Carthoris and Thuvia looked in the direction the Lotharian
had indicated, expecting to see some strange and fearful
creature in human form; but to their astonishment they saw
the broad head and great-maned shoulders of a huge banth,
the largest that either ever had seen.
<P>
Slowly and with dignity the mighty beast advanced
into the room.  Jav had fallen to the floor, and was
wriggling his body in the same servile manner that he
had adopted toward Tario.  He spoke to the fierce beast
as he would have spoken to a human being, pleading with
it for mercy.
<P>
Carthoris stepped between Thuvia and the banth, his
sword ready to contest the beast's victory over them.
Thuvia turned toward Jav.
<P>
"Is this Komal, your god?" she asked.
<P>
Jav nodded affirmatively.  The girl smiled, and then,
brushing past Carthoris, she stepped swiftly toward the
growling carnivore.
<P>
In low, firm tones she spoke to it as she had spoken
to the banths of the Golden Cliffs and the scavengers
before the walls of Lothar.
<P>
The beast ceased its growling.  With lowered head and
catlike purr, it came slinking to the girl's feet.
Thuvia turned toward Carthoris.
<P>
"It is but a banth," she said.  "We have nothing to
fear from it."
<P>
Carthoris smiled.
<P>
"I did not fear it," he replied, "for I, too, believed
it to be only a banth, and I have my long-sword."
<P>
Jav sat up and gazed at the spectacle before him--the
slender girl weaving her fingers in the tawny mane
of the huge creature that he had thought divine, while
Komal rubbed his hideous snout against her side.
<P>
"So this is your god!" laughed Thuvia.
<P>
Jav looked bewildered.  He scarce knew whether he
dare chance offending Komal or not, for so strong is the
power of superstition that even though we know that we
have been reverencing a sham, yet still we hesitate
to admit the validity of our new-found convictions.
<P>
"Yes," he said, "this is Komal.  For ages the enemies
of Tario have been hurled to this pit to fill his maw,
for Komal must be fed."
<P>
"Is there any way out of this chamber to the avenues
of the city?" asked Carthoris.
<P>
Jav shrugged.
<P>
"I do not know," he replied.  "Never have I been
here before, nor ever have I cared to do so."
<P>
"Come," suggested Thuvia, "let us explore.
There must be a way out."
<P>
Together the three approached the doorway through
which Komal had entered the apartment that was to have
witnessed their deaths.  Beyond was a low-roofed lair,
with a small door at the far end.
<P>
This, to their delight, opened to the lifting of an
ordinary latch, letting them into a circular arena,
surrounded by tiers of seats.
<P>
"Here is where Komal is fed in public," explained
Jav.  "Had Tario dared it would have been here that
our fates had been sealed; but he feared too much thy
keen blade, red man, and so he hurled us all downward
to the pit.  I did not know how closely connected were
the two chambers.  Now we may easily reach the avenues
and the city gates.  Only the bowmen may dispute the
right of way, and, knowing their secret, I doubt that
they have power to harm us."
<P>
Another door led to a flight of steps that rose from
the arena level upward through the seats to an exit at
the back of the hall.  Beyond this was a straight,
broad corridor, running directly through the palace
to the gardens at the side.
<P>
No one appeared to question them as they advanced,
mighty Komal pacing by the girl's side.
<P>
"Where are the people of the palace--the jeddak's retinue?"
asked Carthoris.  "Even in the city streets as we came
through I scarce saw sign of a human being, yet all about
are evidences of a mighty population."
<P>
Jav sighed.
<P>
"Poor Lothar," he said.  "It is indeed a city of ghosts.
There are scarce a thousand of us left, who once were
numbered in the millions.  Our great city is peopled by
the creatures of our own imaginings.  For our own needs
we do not take the trouble to materialize these peoples
of our brain, yet they are apparent to us.
<P>
"Even now I see great throngs lining the avenue,
hastening to and fro in the round of their duties. 
I see women and children laughing on the balconies--these
we are forbidden to materialize; but yet I see them--they
are here. . . .  But why not?" he mused.  "No longer need I
fear Tario--he has done his worst, and failed.  Why not indeed?
<P>
"Stay, friends," he continued.  "Would you see Lothar
in all her glory?"
<P>
Carthoris and Thuvia nodded their assent, more out
of courtesy than because they fully grasped the import
of his mutterings.
<P>
Jav gazed at them penetratingly for an instant, then,
with a wave of his hand, cried:  "Look!"
<P>
The sight that met them was awe-inspiring.  Where
before there had been naught but deserted pavements
and scarlet swards, yawning windows and tenantless
doors, now swarmed a countless multitude of happy,
laughing people.
<P>
"It is the past," said Jav in a low voice.  "They do
not see us--they but live the old dead past of ancient
Lothar--the dead and crumbled Lothar of antiquity,
which stood upon the shore of Throxus, mightiest of
the five oceans.
<P>
"See those fine, upstanding men swinging along the
broad avenue?  See the young girls and the women smile
upon them?  See the men greet them with love and respect?
Those be seafarers coming up from their ships which lie
at the quays at the city's edge.
<P>
"Brave men, they--ah, but the glory of Lothar has faded!
See their weapons.  They alone bore arms, for they crossed
the five seas to strange places where dangers were.
With their passing passed the martial spirit of the
Lotharians, leaving, as the ages rolled by, a race of
spineless cowards.
<P>
"We hated war, and so we trained not our youth in
warlike ways.  Thus followed our undoing, for when the
seas dried and the green hordes encroached upon us we
could do naught but flee.  But we remembered the 
seafaring bowmen of the days of our glory--it is the
memory of these which we hurl upon our enemies."
<P>
As Jav ceased speaking, the picture faded, and once more,
the three took up their way toward the distant gates,
along deserted avenues.
<P>
Twice they sighted Lotharians of flesh and blood.  At
sight of them and the huge banth which they must have
recognized as Komal, the citizens turned and fled.
<P>
"They will carry word of our flight to Tario," cried Jav,
"and soon he will send his bowmen after us.  Let us hope
that our theory is correct, and that their shafts are
powerless against minds cognizant of their unreality.
Otherwise we are doomed.
<P>
"Explain, red man, to the woman the truths that I
have explained to you, that she may meet the arrows
with a stronger counter-suggestion of immunity."
<P>
Carthoris did as Jav bid him; but they came to the great
gates without sign of pursuit developing.  Here Jav set in
motion the mechanism that rolled the huge, wheel-like
gate aside, and a moment later the three, accompanied
by the banth, stepped out into the plain before Lothar.
<P>
Scarce had they covered a hundred yards when the
sound of many men shouting arose behind them.  As
they turned they saw a company of bowmen debouching
upon the plain from the gate through which they had
but just passed.
<P>
Upon the wall above the gate were a number of
Lotharians, among whom Jav recognized Tario.  The
jeddak stood glaring at them, evidently concentrating all
the forces of his trained mind upon them.  That he was
making a supreme effort to render his imaginary creatures
deadly was apparent.
<P>
Jav turned white, and commenced to tremble.  At the
crucial moment he appeared to lose the courage of his
conviction.  The great banth turned back toward the
advancing bowmen and growled.  Carthoris placed himself
between Thuvia and the enemy and, facing them,
awaited the outcome of their charge.
<P>
Suddenly an inspiration came to Carthoris.
<P>
"Hurl your own bowmen against Tario's!" he cried to Jav.
"Let us see a materialized battle between two mentalities."
<P>
The suggestion seemed to hearten the Lotharian, and
in another moment the three stood behind solid ranks
of huge bowmen who hurled taunts and menaces at the
advancing company emerging from the walled city.
<P>
Jav was a new man the moment his battalions stood
between him and Tario.  One could almost have sworn
the man believed these creatures of his strange hypnotic
power to be real flesh and blood.
<P>
With hoarse battle cries they charged the bowmen of Tario.
Barbed shafts flew thick and fast.  Men fell, and the
ground was red with gore.
<P>
Carthoris and Thuvia had difficulty in reconciling the
reality of it all with their knowledge of the truth.
They saw utan after utan march from the gate in perfect
step to reinforce the outnumbered company which Tario
had first sent forth to arrest them.
<P>
They saw Jav's forces grow correspondingly until all
about them rolled a sea of fighting, cursing warriors,
and the dead lay in heaps about the field.
<P>
Jav and Tario seemed to have forgotten all else beside
the struggling bowmen that surged to and fro, filling the
broad field between the forest and the city.
<P>
The wood loomed close behind Thuvia and Carthoris.
The latter cast a glance toward Jav.
<P>
"Come!" he whispered to the girl.  "Let them fight out
their empty battle--neither, evidently, has power to harm
the other.  They are like two controversialists hurling
words at one another.  While they are engaged we may
as well be devoting our energies to an attempt to find
the passage through the cliffs to the plain beyond."
<P>
As he spoke, Jav, turning from the battle for an instant,
caught his words.  He saw the girl move to accompany the
Heliumite.  A cunning look leaped to the Lotharian's eyes.
<P>
The thing that lay beyond that look had been deep
in his heart since first he had laid eyes upon Thuvia
of Ptarth.  He had not recognized it, however, until now
that she seemed about to pass out of his existence.
<P>
He centred his mind upon the Heliumite and the girl
for an instant.
<P>
Carthoris saw Thuvia of Ptarth step forward with
outstretched hand.  He was surprised at this sudden softening
toward him, and it was with a full heart that he let his
fingers close upon hers, as together they turned away
from forgotten Lothar, into the woods, and bent their steps
toward the distant mountains.
<P>
As the Lotharian had turned toward them, Thuvia had been
surprised to hear Carthoris suddenly voice a new plan.
<P>
"Remain here with Jav," she had heard him say, "while
I go to search for the passage through the cliffs."
<P>
She had dropped back in surprise and disappointment,
for she knew that there was no reason why she should not
have accompanied him.  Certainly she should have been
safer with him than left here alone with the Lotharian.
<P>
And Jav watched the two and smiled his cunning smile.
<P>
When Carthoris had disappeared within the wood, Thuvia
seated herself apathetically upon the scarlet sward to
watch the seemingly interminable struggles of the bowmen.
<P>
The long afternoon dragged its weary way toward darkness,
and still the imaginary legions charged and retreated. 
The sun was about to set when Tario commenced to withdraw
his troops slowly toward the city.
<P>
His plan for cessation of hostilities through the night
evidently met with Jav's entire approval, for he caused
his forces to form themselves in orderly utans and march
just within the edge of the wood, where they were soon
busily engaged in preparing their evening meal, and
spreading down their sleeping silks and furs for the night.
<P>
Thuvia could scarce repress a smile as she noted the
scrupulous care with which Jav's imaginary men attended
to each tiny detail of deportment as truly as if they had
been real flesh and blood.
<P>
Sentries were posted between the camp and the city.
Officers clanked hither and thither issuing commands
and seeing to it that they were properly carried out.
<P>
Thuvia turned toward Jav.
<P>
"Why is it," she asked, "that you observe such careful
nicety in the regulation of your creatures when Tario
knows quite as well as you that they are but figments
of your brain?  Why not permit them simply to dissolve
into thin air until you again require their futile service?"
<P>
"You do not understand them," replied Jav.  "While they
exist they are real.  I do but call them into being now,
and in a way direct their general actions.  But thereafter,
until I dissolve them, they are as actual as you or I.
Their officers command them, under my guidance.  I am
the general--that is all.  And the psychological effect upon
the enemy is far greater than were I to treat them merely
as substanceless vagaries.
<P>
"Then, too," continued the Lotharian, "there is always
the hope, which with us is little short of belief, that some
day these materializations will merge into the real--that
they will remain, some of them, after we have dissolved
their fellows, and that thus we shall have discovered a
means for perpetuating our dying race.
<P>
"Some there are who claim already to have accomplished
the thing.  It is generally supposed that the
etherealists have quite a few among their number who
are permanent materializations.  It is even said that
such is Tario, but that cannot be, for he existed before
we had discovered the full possibilities of suggestion.
<P>
"There are others among us who insist that none of us is real.
That we could not have existed all these ages without material
food and water had we ourselves been material.  Although I am
a realist, I rather incline toward this belief myself.
<P>
"It seems well and sensibly based upon the belief that
our ancient forbears developed before their extinction
such wondrous mentalities that some of the stronger minds
among them lived after the death of their bodies--that
we are but the deathless minds of individuals long dead.
<P>
"It would appear possible, and yet in so far as I am
concerned I have all the attributes of corporeal existence.
I eat, I sleep"--he paused, casting a meaning look upon
the girl--"I love!"
<P>
Thuvia could not mistake the palpable meaning of his
words and expression.  She turned away with a little shrug
of disgust that was not lost upon the Lotharian.
<P>
He came close to her and seized her arm.
<P>
"Why not Jav?" he cried.  "Who more honourable
than the second of the world's most ancient race?
Your Heliumite?  He has gone.  He has deserted you
to your fate to save himself.  Come, be Jav's!"
<P>
Thuvia of Ptarth rose to her full height, her lifted
shoulder turned toward the man, her haughty chin upraised,
a scornful twist to her lips.
<P>
"You lie!" she said quietly, "the Heliumite knows less
of disloyalty than he knows of fear, and of fear he is as
ignorant as the unhatched young."
<P>
"Then where is he?" taunted the Lotharian.  "I tell you
he has fled the valley.  He has left you to your fate.
But Jav will see that it is a pleasant one.  To-morrow we
shall return into Lothar at the head of my victorious army,
and I shall be jeddak and you shall be my consort.  Come!"
And he attempted to crush her to his breast.
<P>
The girl struggled to free herself, striking at the man
with her metal armlets.  Yet still he drew her toward him,
until both were suddenly startled by a hideous growl that
rumbled from the dark wood close behind them.
