<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>When the taxicab carrying Captain Sengoun and the unknown Russian
girl had finally disappeared far away down the Boulevard in the
thin grey haze of early morning, Neeland looked around him; and
it was a scene unfamiliar, unreal, that met his anxious eyes.</p>

<p>The sun had not yet gilded the chimney tops; east and west, as
far as he could see, the Boulevard stretched away under its double
line of trees between ranks of closed and silent houses, lying
still and mysterious in the misty, bluish-grey light.</p>

<p>Except for police and municipal guards, and two ambulances moving
slowly away from the ruined café, across the street, the vast
Boulevard was deserted; no taxicabs remained; no omnibuses moved;
no early workmen passed, no slow-moving farm wagons and milk wains
from the suburbs; no <em>chiffoniers</em> with scrap-filled sacks
on their curved backs, and steel-hooked staves, furtively sorting
and picking among the night's débris on sidewalk and in gutter.</p>

<p>Here and there in front of half a dozen wrecked cafés little
knots of policemen stood on the glass-littered sidewalk, in low-voiced
consultation; far down the Boulevard, helmets gleamed dully through
the haze where municipal cavalry were quietly riding off the mobs
and gradually pushing them back toward the Montmartre and Villette
quarters, whence they had arrived.</p>

<p>Mounted Municipals still sat their beautiful horses in double
line across the corner of the rue Vilna and parallel streets,
closing that entire quarter where, to judge from a few fitful
and far-away pistol shots, the methodical apache hunt was still
in progress.</p>

<p>And it was a strange and sinister phase of Paris that Neeland
now gazed upon through the misty stillness of early morning. For
there was something terrible in the sudden quiet, where the swift
and shadowy fury of earliest dawn had passed: and the wrecked
buildings sagged like corpses, stark and disembowelled, spilling
out their dead intestines indecently under the whitening sky.</p>

<p>Save for the echoes of distant shots, no louder than the breaking
of a splinter&mdash;save for the deadened stamp and stir of horses,
a low-voiced order, the fainter clash of spurs and scabbards&mdash;an
intense stillness brooded now over the city, ominously prophetic
of what fateful awakening the coming sunrise threatened for the
sleeping capital.</p>

<p>Neeland turned and looked at Ilse Dumont. She stood motionless
on the sidewalk, in the clear, colourless light, staring fixedly
across the street at the débris of the gaping, shattered Café
des Bulgars. Her evening gown hung in filmy tinted shreds; her
thick, dark hair in lustrous disorder shadowed her white shoulders;
a streak of dry blood striped one delicate bare arm.</p>

<p>To see her standing there on the sidewalk in the full, unshadowed
morning light, silent, dishevelled, scarcely clothed, seemed to
him part of the ghastly unreality of this sombre and menacing
vision, from which he ought to rouse himself.</p>

<p>She turned her head slowly; her haggard eyes met his without
expression; and he found his tongue with the effort of a man who
strives for utterance through a threatening dream:</p>

<p>"We can't stay here," he said. The sound of his own voice steadied
and cleared his senses. He glanced down at his own attire, blood-stained,
and ragged; felt for the loose end of his collar, rebuttoned it,
and knotted the draggled white tie with the unconscious indifference
of habit.</p>

<p>"What a nightmare!" he muttered to himself. "The world has been
turned upside down over night." He looked up at her: "We can't
stay here," he repeated. "Where do you live?"</p>

<p>She did not appear to hear him. She had already started to move
toward the rue Vilna, where the troopers barring that street still
sat their restive horses. They were watching her and her dishevelled
companion with the sophisticated amusement of men who, by clean
daylight, encounter fagged-out revellers of a riotous night.</p>

<p>Neeland spoke to her again, then followed her and took her arm.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" he repeated, uneasily.</p>

<p>"I shall give myself up," she replied in a dull voice.</p>

<p>"To whom?"</p>

<p>"To the Municipals over there."</p>

<p>"Give yourself up!" he repeated. "Why?"</p>

<p>She passed a slender hand over her eyes as though unutterably
weary:</p>

<p>"Neeland," she said, "I am lost already.... And I am very tired."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he demanded, drawing her back under a <em>porte-cochère</em>.
"You live somewhere, don't you? If it's safe for you to go back
to your lodgings, I'll take you there. Is it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'll take you somewhere else. I'll find somewhere
to take you&#11834;"</p>

<p>She shook her head:</p>

<p>"It is useless, Neeland. There is no chance of my leaving the
city now&mdash;no chance left&mdash;no hope. It is simpler for me to end
the matter this way&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Can't you go to the Turkish Embassy!"</p>

<p>She looked up at him in a surprised, hopeless way:</p>

<p>"Do you suppose that any Embassy ever receives a spy in trouble?
Do you really imagine that any government ever admits employing
secret agents, or stirs a finger to aid them when they are in
need?"</p>

<p>"I told you I'd stand by you," he reminded her bluntly.</p>

<p>"You have been&mdash;kind &mdash;Neeland."</p>

<p>"And you have been very loyal to me, Scheherazade. I shall not
abandon you."</p>

<p>"How can you help me? I can't get out of this city. Wherever
I go, now, it will be only a matter of a few hours before I am
arrested."</p>

<p>"The American Embassy. There is a <em>man</em> there," he reminded
her.</p>

<p>She shrugged her naked shoulders:</p>

<p>"I cannot get within sight of the Trocadero before the secret
police arrest me. Where shall I go? I have no passport, no papers,
not even false ones. If I go to the lodgings where I expected
to find shelter it means my arrest, court martial, and execution
in a <em>caserne</em> within twenty-four hours. And it would involve
others who trust me&mdash;condemn them instantly to a firing squad&mdash;if
I am found by the police in their company!... No, Neeland. There's
no hope for me. Too many know me in Paris. I took a risk in coming
here when war was almost certain. I took my chances, and lost.
It's too late to whimper now."</p>

<p>As he stared at her something suddenly brightened above them;
and he looked up and saw the first sunbeam painting a chimney
top with palest gold.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, "we've got to get out of this! We've got to
go somewhere&mdash;find a taxicab and get under shelter&#11834;"</p>

<p>She yielded to the pressure of his arm and moved forward beside
him. He halted for a moment on the curb, looking up and down the
empty streets for a cab of any sort, then, with the instinct of
a man for whom the Latin Quarter had once been a refuge and a
home, he started across the Boulevard, his arm clasping hers.</p>

<p>All the housetops were glittering with the sun as they passed
the ranks of the Municipal cavalry.</p>

<p>A young officer looked down mischievously as they traversed the
Boulevard&mdash;the only moving objects in that vast and still perspective.</p>

<p>"<em>Mon Dieu!</em>" he murmured. "A night like that is something
to remember in the winter of old age!"</p>

<p>Neeland heard him. The gay, bantering, irresponsible Gallic wit
awoke him to himself; the rising sun, tipping the city's spires
with fire, seemed to relight a little, long-forgotten flame within
him. His sombre features cleared; he said confidently to the girl
beside him:</p>

<p>"Don't worry; we'll get you out of it somehow or other. It's
been a rather frightful dream, Scheherazade, nothing worse&#11834;"</p>

<p>Her arm suddenly tightened against his and he turned to look
at the shattered Café des Bulgars which they were passing, where
two policemen stood looking at a cat which was picking its way
over the mass of débris, mewing dismally.</p>

<p>One of the policemen, noticing them, smiled sympathetically at
their battered appearance.</p>

<p>"Would you like to have a cat for your lively <em>ménage</em>?"
he said, pointing to the melancholy animal which Neeland recognised
as the dignified property of the Cercle Extranationale.</p>

<p>The other policeman, more suspicious, eyed Ilse Dumont closely
as she knelt impulsively and picked up the homeless cat.</p>

<p>"Where are you going in such a state?" he asked, moving over
the heaps of splintered glass toward her.</p>

<p>"Back to the Latin Quarter," said Neeland, so cheerfully that
suspicion vanished and a faint grin replaced the official frown.</p>

<p>"<em>Allons, mes enfants</em>," he muttered. "<em>Faut pas s'attrouper
dans la rue</em>. Also you both are a scandal. <em>Allons! Filez!
Houp!</em> The sun is up already!"</p>

<p>They went out across the rue Royale toward the Place de la Concorde,
which spread away before them in deserted immensity and beauty.</p>

<p>There were no taxicabs in sight. Ilse, carrying the cat in her
arms, moved beside Neeland through the deathly stillness of the
city, as though she were walking in a dream. Everywhere in the
pale blue sky above them steeple and dome glittered with the sun;
there were no sounds from <em>quai</em> or river; no breeze stirred
the trees; nothing moved on esplanade or bridge; the pale blue
August sky grew bluer; the gilded tip of the obelisk glittered
like a living flame.</p>

<p>Neeland turned and looked up the Champs Elysées.</p>

<p>Far away on the surface of the immense avenue a tiny dark speck
was speeding&mdash;increasing in size, coming nearer.</p>

<p>"A taxi," he said with a quick breath of relief. "We'll be all
right now."</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the speeding vehicle, rushing toward them
between the motionless green ranks of trees. Neeland walked forward
across the square to signal it, waited, watching its approach
with a slight uneasiness.</p>

<p>Now it sped between the rearing stone horses, and now, swerving,
swung to the left toward the rue Royale. And to his disgust and
disappointment he saw it was a private automobile.</p>

<p>"The devil!" he muttered, turning on his heel.</p>

<p>At the same moment, as though the chauffeur had suddenly caught
an order from within the limousine, the car swung directly toward
him once more.</p>

<p>As he rejoined Ilse, who stood clasping the homeless cat to her
breast, listlessly regarding the approaching automobile, the car
swept in a swift circle around the fountain where they stood,
stopped short beside them; and a woman flung open the door and
sprang out to the pavement.</p>

<p>And Ilse Dumont, standing there in the rags of her frail gown,
cuddling to her breast the purring cat, looked up to meet her
doom in the steady gaze of the Princess Naïa Mistchenka.</p>

<p>Every atom of colour left her face, and her ashy lips parted.
Otherwise, she made no sign of fear, no movement.</p>

<p>There was a second's absolute silence; then the dark eyes of
the Princess turned on Neeland.</p>

<p>"Good heavens, James!" she said. "What has happened to you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said gaily, "thanks to Miss Dumont&#11834;"</p>

<p>"To <em>whom</em>?" interrupted the Princess sharply.</p>

<p>"To Miss Dumont. We got into a silly place where it began to
look as though we'd get our heads knocked off, Sengoun and I.
I'm really quite serious, Princess. If it hadn't been for Miss
Dumont&mdash;" he shrugged; "&mdash;and that is twice she has saved my idiotic
head for me," he added cheerfully.</p>

<p>The Princess Naïa's dark eyes reverted to Ilse Dumont, and the
pallid girl met them steadily enough. There was no supplication
in her own eyes, no shrinking, only the hopeless tranquillity
that looks Destiny in the face&mdash;the gaze riveted unflinchingly
upon the descending blow.</p>

<p>"What are <em>you</em> doing in Paris at such a time as this?"
said the Princess.</p>

<p>The girl's white lips parted stiffly:</p>

<p>"Do you need to ask?"</p>

<p>For a full minute the Princess bent a menacing gaze on her in
silence; then:</p>

<p>"What do you expect from <em>me</em>?" she demanded in a low
voice. And, stepping nearer: "What have you to expect from anyone
in France on such a day as this?"</p>

<p>Ilse Dumont did not answer. After a moment she dropped her head
and fumbled with the rags of her bodice, as though trying to cover
the delicately rounded shoulders. A shaft of sunlight, reflected
from the obelisk to the fountain, played in golden ripples across
her hair.</p>

<p>Neeland looked at the Princess Naïa:</p>

<p>"What you do is none of my business," he said pleasantly, "but&mdash;"
he smiled at her and stepped back beside Ilse Dumont, and passed
his arm through hers: "I'm a grateful beast," he added lightly,
"and if I've nine lives to lose, perhaps Miss Dumont will save
seven more of them before I'm entirely done for."</p>

<p>The girl gently disengaged his arm.</p>

<p>"You'll only get yourself into serious trouble," she murmured,
"and you can't help me, dear Neeland."</p>

<p>The Princess Naïa, flushed and exasperated, bit her lip.</p>

<p>"James," she said, "you are behaving absurdly. That woman has
nothing to fear from me now, and she ought to know it!" And, as
Ilse lifted her head and stared at her: "Yes, you ought to know
it!" she repeated. "Your work is ended. It ended today at sunrise.
And so did mine. War is here. There is nothing further for you
to do; nothing for me. The end of everything is beginning. What
would your death or mine signify now, when the dawn of such a
day as this is the death warrant for millions? What do we count
for now, Mademoiselle Minna Minti?"</p>

<p>"Do you not mean to give me up, madame?"</p>

<p>"Give you up? No. I mean to get you out of Paris if I can. Give
me your cat, mademoiselle. Please help her, James&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;offer me your limousine?" stammered Ilse.</p>

<p>"Give that cat to me. Of course I do! Do you suppose I mean to
leave you in rags with your cat on the pavement here?" And, to
Neeland: "Where is Alak?"</p>

<p>"Gone home as fit as a fiddle. Am I to receive the hospitality
of your limousine also, dear lady? Look at the state I'm in to
travel with two ladies!"</p>

<p>The Princess Naïa's dark eyes glimmered; she tucked the cat comfortably
against her shoulder and motioned Ilse into the car.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'll have to take you, James. What on earth has happened
to you?" she added, as he put her into the car, nodded to the
chauffeur, and, springing in beside her, slammed the door.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you in two words," he explained gaily. "Prince Erlik
and I started for a stroll and landed, ultimately, in the Café
des Bulgars. And presently a number of gentlemen began to shoot
up the place, and Miss Dumont stood by us like a brick."</p>

<p>The Princess Mistchenka lifted the cat from her lap and placed
it in the arms of Ilse Dumont.</p>

<p>"That ought to win our gratitude, I'm sure," she said politely
to the girl. "We Russians never forget such pleasant obligations.
There is a Cossack jingle:</p>

<p>  "To those who befriend our friends   Our duty never ends."</p>

<p>Ilse Dumont bent low over the purring cat in her lap; the Princess
watched her askance from moment to moment, and Neeland furtively
noted the contrast between these women&mdash;one in rags and haggard
disorder; the other so trim, pretty, and fresh in her morning
walking suit.</p>

<p>"James," she said abruptly, "we've had a most horrid night, Ruhannah
and I. The child waited up for you, it seems &mdash;I thought
she'd gone to bed&mdash;and she came to my room about two in the morning&mdash;the
little goose&mdash;as though men didn't stay out all night!"</p>

<p>"I'm terribly sorry," he said contritely.</p>

<p>"You ought to be.... And Ruhannah was so disturbed that I put
on something and got out of bed. And after a while"&mdash;the Princess
glanced sardonically at Ilse Dumont&mdash;"I telephoned to various
sources of information and was informed concerning the rather
lively episodes of your nocturnal career with Sengoun. And when
I learned that you and he had been seen to enter the Café des
Bulgars, I became sufficiently alarmed to notify several people
who might be interested in the matter."</p>

<p>"One of those people," said Neeland, smiling, "was escorted to
her home by Captain Sengoun, I think."</p>

<p>The Princess glanced out of the window where the early morning
sun glimmered on the trees as the car flew swiftly through the
Champs Elysées.</p>

<p>"I heard that there were some men killed there last night," she
said without turning.</p>

<p>"Several, I believe," admitted Neeland.</p>

<p>"Were <em>you</em> there, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"Did you know anybody who was killed, James?"</p>

<p>"Yes, by sight."</p>

<p>She turned to him:</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"There was a man named Kestner; another named Weishelm. Three
American gamblers were killed also."</p>

<p>"And Karl Breslau?" inquired the Princess coolly.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence.</p>

<p>"No. I think he got away across the roofs of the houses," replied
Neeland.</p>

<p>Ilse Dumont, bent over the cat in her lap, stared absently into
its green eyes where it lay playfully patting the rags that hung
from her torn bodice.</p>

<p>Perhaps she was thinking of the dead man where he lay in the
crowded café&mdash;the dead man who had confronted her with bloodshot
eyes and lifted pistol&mdash;whose voice, thick with rage, had denounced
her&mdash;whose stammering, untaught tongue stumbled over the foreign
words with which he meant to send her to her death&mdash;this dead
man who once had been <em>her</em> man&mdash;long ago&mdash;very, very long
ago when there was no bitterness in life, no pain, no treachery&mdash;when
life was young in the Western World, and Fate gaily beckoned her,
wearing a smiling mask and crowned with flowers.</p>

<p>"I hope," remarked the Princess Mistchenka, "that it is sufficiently
early in the morning for you to escape observation, James."</p>

<p>"I'm a scandal; I know it," he admitted, as the car swung into
the rue Soleil d'Or.</p>

<p>The Princess turned to the drooping girl beside her and laid
a gloved hand lightly on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said gently, "there is only one chance for you,
and if we let it pass it will not come again&mdash;under military law."</p>

<p>Ilse lifted her head, held it high, even tilted back a little.</p>

<p>The Princess said:</p>

<p>"Twenty-four hours will be given for all Germans to leave France.
But&mdash;you took your nationality from the man you married. You are
American."</p>

<p>The girl flushed painfully:</p>

<p>"I do not care to take shelter under his name," she said.</p>

<p>"It is the only way. And you must get to the coast in my car.
There is no time to lose. Every vehicle, private and public, will
be seized for military uses this morning. Every train will be
crowded; every foot of room occupied on the Channel boats. There
is only one thing for you to do&mdash;travel with me to Havre as my
American maid."</p>

<p>"Madame&mdash;would you do that&mdash;for me?"</p>

<p>"Why, I've got to," said the Princess Mistchenka with a shrug.
"I am not a barbarian to leave you to a firing squad, I hope."</p>

<p>The car had stopped; the chauffeur descended and came around
to open the door.</p>

<p>"Caron," said the Princess, "no servants are stirring yet. Take
my key, find a cloak and bring it out&mdash;and a coat for Monsieur
Neeland&mdash;the one that Captain Sengoun left the other evening.
Have you plenty of gasoline?"</p>

<p>"Plenty, madame."</p>

<p>"Good. We leave for Havre in five minutes. Bring the cloak and
coat quickly."</p>

<p>The chauffeur hastened to the door, unlocked it, disappeared,
then came out carrying a voluminous wrap and a man's opera cloak.
The Princess threw the one over Ilse Dumont; Neeland enveloped
himself in the other.</p>

<p>"Now," murmured the Princess Naïa, "it will look more like a
late automobile party than an ambulance after a free fight&mdash;if
any early servants are watching us."</p>

<p>She descended from the car; Ilse Dumont followed, still clasping
the cat under her cloak; and Neeland followed her.</p>

<p>"Be very quiet," whispered the Princess. "There is no necessity
for servants to observe what we do&#11834;"</p>

<p>A small and tremulous voice from the head of the stairs interrupted
her:</p>

<p>"Naïa! Is it you?"</p>

<p>"Hush, Ruhannah! Yes, darling, it is I. Everything is all right
and you may go back to bed&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Naïa! Where is Mr. Neeland?" continued the voice, fearfully.</p>

<p>"He is here, Rue! He is all right. Go back to your room, dear.
I have a reason for asking you."</p>

<p>Listening, she heard a door close above; then she touched Ilse
on the shoulder and motioned her to follow up the stairs. Halfway
up the Princess halted, bent swiftly over the banisters:</p>

<p>"James!" she called softly.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Go into the pantry and find a fruit basket and fill it with
whatever food you can find. Hurry, please."</p>

<p>He discovered the pantry presently, and a basket of fruit there.
Poking about he contrived to disinter from various tins and ice-boxes
some cold chicken and biscuits and a bottle of claret. These he
wrapped hastily in a napkin which he found there, placed them
in the basket of fruit, and came out into the hall just as Ilse
Dumont, in the collar and cuffs and travelling coat of a servant,
descended, carrying a satchel and a suitcase.</p>

<p>"Good business!" he whispered, delighted. "You're all right now,
Scheherazade! And for heaven's sake, keep out of France hereafter.
Do you promise?"</p>

<p>He had taken the satchel and bag from her and handed both, and
the fruit basket, to Caron, who stood outside the door.</p>

<p>In the shadowy hall those two confronted each other now, probably
for the last time. He took both her hands in his.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Scheherazade dear," he said, with a new seriousness
in his voice which made the tone of it almost tender.</p>

<p>"G-good-bye&#11834;" The girl's voice choked; she bent her head and
rested her face on the hands he held clasped in his.</p>

<p>He felt her hot tears falling, felt the slender fingers within
his own tighten convulsively; felt her lips against his hand&mdash;an
instant only; then she turned and slipped through the open door.</p>

<p>A moment later the Princess Naïa appeared on the stairs, descending
lightly and swiftly, her motor coat over her arm.</p>

<p>"Jim," she said in a low voice, "it's the wretched girl's only
chance. They know about her; they're looking for her now. But
I am trusted by my Ambassador; I shall have what papers I ask
for; I shall get her through to an American steamer."</p>

<p>"Princess Naïa, you are splendid!"</p>

<p>"You don't think so, Jim; you never did.... Be nice to Rue. The
child has been dreadfully frightened about you.... And," added
the Princess Mistchenka with a gaily forced smile, resting her
hand on Neeland's shoulder for an instant, "don't ever kiss Rue
Carew unless you mean it with every atom of your heart and soul....
I know the child.... And I know you. Be generous to her, James.
All women need it, I think, from such men as you&mdash;such men as
you," she added laughingly, "who know not what they do."</p>

<p>If there was a subtle constraint in her pretty laughter, if her
gay gesture lacked spontaneity, he did not perceive it. His face
had flushed a trifle under her sudden badinage.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he said. "You <em>are</em> splendid, and I <em>do</em>
think so. I know you'll win through."</p>

<p>"I shall. I always do&mdash;except with you," she added audaciously.
And "Look for me tomorrow!" she called back to him through the
open door; and slammed it behind her, leaving him standing there
alone in the dark and curtained house.</p>
