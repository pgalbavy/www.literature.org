<p>The most careless reader must have remarked a change of air since the
Marquesas.  The house, crowded with effects, the bustling housewife
counting her possessions, the serious, indoctrinated island pastor, the
long fight for life in the lagoon: here are traits of a new world.  I
read in a pamphlet (I will not give the author’s name) that the Marquesan
especially resembles the Paumotuan.  I should take the two races, though
so near in neighbourhood, to be extremes of Polynesian diversity.  The
Marquesan is certainly the most beautiful of human races, and one of the
tallest—the Paumotuan averaging a good inch shorter, and not even
handsome; the Marquesan open-handed, inert, insensible to religion,
childishly self-indulgent—the Paumotuan greedy, hardy, enterprising, a
religious disputant, and with a trace of the ascetic character.
</p>
<p>Yet a few years ago, and the people of the archipelago were crafty
savages.  Their isles might be called sirens’ isles, not merely from the
attraction they exerted on the passing mariner, but from the perils that
awaited him on shore.  Even to this day, in certain outlying islands,
danger lingers; and the civilized Paumotuan dreads to land and hesitates
to accost his backward brother.  But, except in these, to-day the peril
is a memory.  When our generation were yet in the cradle and playroom it
was still a living fact.  Between 1830 and 1840, Hao, for instance, was a
place of the most dangerous approach, where ships were seized and crews
kidnapped.  As late as 1856, the schooner <u>Sarah Ann</u> sailed from Papeete
and was seen no more.  She had women on board, and children, the
captain’s wife, a nursemaid, a baby, and the two young sons of a Captain
Steven on their way to the mainland for schooling.  All were supposed to
have perished in a squall.  A year later, the captain of the <u>Julia</u>,
coasting along the island variously called Bligh, Lagoon, and Tematangi
saw armed natives follow the course of his schooner, clad in
many-coloured stuffs.  Suspicion was at once aroused; the mother of the
lost children was profuse of money; and one expedition having found the
place deserted, and returned content with firing a few shots, she raised
and herself accompanied another.  None appeared to greet or to oppose
them; they roamed a while among abandoned huts and empty thickets; then
formed two parties and set forth to beat, from end to end, the pandanus
jungle of the island.  One man remained alone by the landing-place—Teina,
a chief of Anaa, leader of the armed natives who made the strength of the
expedition.  Now that his comrades were departed this way and that, on
their laborious exploration, the silence fell profound; and this silence
was the ruin of the islanders.  A sound of stones rattling caught the ear
of Teina.  He looked, thinking to perceive a crab, and saw instead the
brown hand of a human being issue from a fissure in the ground.  A shout
recalled the search parties and announced their doom to the buried
caitiffs.  In the cave below, sixteen were found crouching among human
bones and singular and horrid curiosities.  One was a head of golden
hair, supposed to be a relic of the captain’s wife; another was half of
the body of a European child, sun-dried and stuck upon a stick, doubtless
with some design of wizardry.
</p><p>The Paumotuan is eager to be rich.  He saves, grudges, buries money,
fears not work.  For a dollar each, two natives passed the hours of
daylight cleaning our ship’s copper.  It was strange to see them so
indefatigable and so much at ease in the water—working at times with
their pipes lighted, the smoker at times submerged and only the glowing
bowl above the surface; it was stranger still to think they were next
congeners to the incapable Marquesan.  But the Paumotuan not only saves,
grudges, and works, he steals besides; or, to be more precise, he
swindles.  He will never deny a debt, he only flees his creditor.  He is
always keen for an advance; so soon as he has fingered it he disappears.
He knows your ship; so soon as it nears one island, he is off to another.
You may think you know his name; he has already changed it.  Pursuit in
that infinity of isles were fruitless.  The result can be given in a
nutshell.  It has been actually proposed in a Government report to secure
debts by taking a photograph of the debtor; and the other day in Papeete
credits on the Paumotus to the amount of sixteen thousand pounds were
sold for less than forty—<u>quatre cent mille francs pour moins de mille
francs</u>.  Even so, the purchase was thought hazardous; and only the man
who made it and who had special opportunities could have dared to give so
much.
</p><p>The Paumotuan is sincerely attached to those of his own blood and
household.  A touching affection sometimes unites wife and husband.
Their children, while they are alive, completely rule them; after they
are dead, their bones or their mummies are often jealously preserved and
carried from atoll to atoll in the wanderings of the family.  I was told
there were many houses in Fakarava with the mummy of a child locked in a
sea-chest; after I heard it, I would glance a little jealously at those
by my own bed; in that cupboard, also, it was possible there was a tiny
skeleton.
</p><p>The race seems in a fair way to survive.  From fifteen islands, whose
rolls I had occasion to consult, I found a proportion of 59 births to 47
deaths for 1887.  Dropping three out of the fifteen, there remained for
the other twelve the comfortable ratio of 50 births to 32 deaths.  Long
habits of hardship and activity doubtless explain the contrast with
Marquesan figures.  But the Paumotuan displays, besides, a certain
concern for health and the rudiments of a sanitary discipline.  Public
talk with these free-spoken people plays the part of the Contagious
Diseases Act; in-comers to fresh islands anxiously inquire if all be
well; and syphilis, when contracted, is successfully treated with
indigenous herbs.  Like their neighbours of Tahiti, from whom they have
perhaps imbibed the error, they regard leprosy with comparative
indifference, elephantiasis with disproportionate fear.  But, unlike
indeed to the Tahitian, their alarm puts on the guise of self-defence.
Any one stricken with this painful and ugly malady is confined to the
ends of villages, denied the use of paths and highways, and condemned to
transport himself between his house and coco-patch by water only, his
very footprint being held infectious.  Fe’efe’e, being a creature of
marshes and the sequel of malarial fever, is not original in atolls.  On
the single isle of Makatea, where the lagoon is now a marsh, the disease
has made a home.  Many suffer; they are excluded (if Mr. Wilmot be right)
from much of the comfort of society; and it is believed they take a
secret vengeance.  The defections of the sick are considered highly
poisonous.  Early in the morning, it is narrated, aged and malicious
persons creep into the sleeping village, and stealthily make water at the
doors of the houses of young men.  Thus they propagate disease; thus they
breathe on and obliterate comeliness and health, the objects of their
envy.  Whether horrid fact or more abominable legend, it equally depicts
that something bitter and energetic which distinguishes Paumotuan man.
</p><p>The archipelago is divided between two main religions, Catholic and
Mormon.  They front each other proudly with a false air of permanence;
yet are but shapes, their membership in a perpetual flux.  The Mormon
attends mass with devotion: the Catholic sits attentive at a Mormon
sermon, and to-morrow each may have transferred allegiance.  One man had
been a pillar of the Church of Rome for fifteen years; his wife dying, he
decided that must be a poor religion that could not save a man his wife,
and turned Mormon.  According to one informant, Catholicism was the more
fashionable in health, but on the approach of sickness it was judged
prudent to secede.  As a Mormon, there were five chances out of six you
might recover; as a Catholic, your hopes were small; and this opinion is
perhaps founded on the comfortable rite of unction.
</p><p>We all know what Catholics are, whether in the Paumotus or at home.  But
the Paumotuan Mormon seemed a phenomenon apart.  He marries but the one
wife, uses the Protestant Bible, observes Protestant forms of worship,
forbids the use of liquor and tobacco, practises adult baptism by
immersion, and after every public sin, rechristens the backslider.  I
advised with Mahinui, whom I found well informed in the history of the
American Mormons, and he declared against the least connection.  ‘<u>Pour
moi</u>,’ said he, with a fine charity, ‘<u>les Mormons ici un petit
Catholiques</u>.’  Some months later I had an opportunity to consult an
orthodox fellow-countryman, an old dissenting Highlander, long settled in
Tahiti, but still breathing of the heather of Tiree.  ‘Why do they call
themselves Mormons?’ I asked.  ‘My dear, and that is my question!’ he
exclaimed.  ‘For by all that I can hear of their doctrine, I have nothing
to say against it, and their life, it is above reproach.’  And for all
that, Mormons they are, but of the earlier sowing: the so-called
Josephites, the followers of Joseph Smith, the opponents of Brigham
Young.
</p><p>Grant, then, the Mormons to be Mormons.  Fresh points at once arise: What
are the Israelites? and what the Kanitus?  For a long while back the sect
had been divided into Mormons proper and so-called Israelites, I never
could hear why.  A few years since there came a visiting missionary of
the name of Williams, who made an excellent collection, and retired,
leaving fresh disruption imminent.  Something irregular (as I was told)
in his way of ‘opening the service’ had raised partisans and enemies; the
church was once more rent asunder; and a new sect, the Kanitu, issued
from the division.  Since then Kanitus and Israelites, like the
Cameronians and the United Presbyterians, have made common cause; and the
ecclesiastical history of the Paumotus is, for the moment, uneventful.
There will be more doing before long, and these isles bid fair to be the
Scotland of the South.  Two things I could never learn.  The nature of
the innovations of the Rev. Mr. Williams none would tell me, and of the
meaning of the name Kanitu none had a guess.  It was not Tahitian, it was
not Marquesan; it formed no part of that ancient speech of the Paumotus,
now passing swiftly into obsolescence.  One man, a priest, God bless him!
said it was the Latin for a little dog.  I have found it since as the
name of a god in New Guinea; it must be a bolder man than I who should
hint at a connection.  Here, then, is a singular thing: a brand-new sect,
arising by popular acclamation, and a nonsense word invented for its
name.
</p><p>The design of mystery seems obvious, and according to a very intelligent
observer, Mr. Magee of Mangareva, this element of the mysterious is a
chief attraction of the Mormon Church.  It enjoys some of the status of
Freemasonry at home, and there is for the convert some of the
exhilaration of adventure.  Other attractions are certainly conjoined.
Perpetual rebaptism, leading to a succession of baptismal feasts, is
found, both from the social and the spiritual side, a pleasing feature.
More important is the fact that all the faithful enjoy office; perhaps
more important still, the strictness of the discipline.  ‘The veto on
liquor,’ said Mr. Magee, ‘brings them plenty members.’  There is no doubt
these islanders are fond of drink, and no doubt they refrain from the
indulgence; a bout on a feast-day, for instance, may be followed by a
week or a month of rigorous sobriety.  Mr. Wilmot attributes this to
Paumotuan frugality and the love of hoarding; it goes far deeper.  I have
mentioned that I made a feast on board the <u>Casco</u>.  To wash down ship’s
bread and jam, each guest was given the choice of rum or syrup, and out
of the whole number only one man voted—in a defiant tone, and amid shouts
of mirth—for ‘Trum’!  This was in public.  I had the meanness to repeat
the experiment, whenever I had a chance, within the four walls of my
house; and three at least, who had refused at the festival, greedily
drank rum behind a door.  But there were others thoroughly consistent.  I
said the virtues of the race were bourgeois and puritan; and how
bourgeois is this! how puritanic! how Scottish! and how Yankee!—the
temptation, the resistance, the public hypocritical conformity, the
Pharisees, the Holy Willies, and the true disciples.  With such a people
the popularity of an ascetic Church appears legitimate; in these strict
rules, in this perpetual supervision, the weak find their advantage, the
strong a certain pleasure; and the doctrine of rebaptism, a clean bill
and a fresh start, will comfort many staggering professors.
</p><p>There is yet another sect, or what is called a sect—no doubt
improperly—that of the Whistlers.  Duncan Cameron, so clear in favour of
the Mormons, was no less loud in condemnation of the Whistlers.  Yet I do
not know; I still fancy there is some connection, perhaps fortuitous,
probably disavowed.  Here at least are some doings in the house of an
Israelite clergyman (or prophet) in the island of Anaa, of which I am
equally sure that Duncan would disclaim and the Whistlers hail them for
an imitation of their own.  My informant, a Tahitian and a Catholic,
occupied one part of the house; the prophet and his family lived in the
other.  Night after night the Mormons, in the one end, held their evening
sacrifice of song; night after night, in the other, the wife of the
Tahitian lay awake and listened to their singing with amazement.  At
length she could contain herself no longer, woke her husband, and asked
him what he heard.  ‘I hear several persons singing hymns,’ said he.
‘Yes,’ she returned, ‘but listen again!  Do you not hear something
supernatural?’  His attention thus directed, he was aware of a strange
buzzing voice—and yet he declared it was beautiful—which justly
accompanied the singers.  The next day he made inquiries.  ‘It is a
spirit,’ said the prophet, with entire simplicity, ‘which has lately made
a practice of joining us at family worship.’  It did not appear the thing
was visible, and like other spirits raised nearer home in these
degenerate days, it was rudely ignorant, at first could only buzz, and
had only learned of late to bear a part correctly in the music.
</p><p>The performances of the Whistlers are more business-like.  Their meetings
are held publicly with open doors, all being ‘cordially invited to
attend.’  The faithful sit about the room—according to one informant,
singing hymns; according to another, now singing and now whistling; the
leader, the wizard—let me rather say, the medium—sits in the midst,
enveloped in a sheet and silent; and presently, from just above his head,
or sometimes from the midst of the roof, an aerial whistling proceeds,
appalling to the inexperienced.  This, it appears, is the language of the
dead; its purport is taken down progressively by one of the experts,
writing, I was told, ‘as fast as a telegraph operator’; and the
communications are at last made public.  They are of the baldest
triviality; a schooner is, perhaps, announced, some idle gossip reported
of a neighbour, or if the spirit shall have been called to consultation
on a case of sickness, a remedy may be suggested.  One of these,
immersion in scalding water, not long ago proved fatal to the patient.
The whole business is very dreary, very silly, and very European; it has
none of the picturesque qualities of similar conjurations in New Zealand;
it seems to possess no kernel of possible sense, like some that I shall
describe among the Gilbert islanders.  Yet I was told that many hardy,
intelligent natives were inveterate Whistlers.  ‘Like Mahinui?’ I asked,
willing to have a standard; and I was told ‘Yes.’  Why should I wonder?
Men more enlightened than my convict-catechist sit down at home to
follies equally sterile and dull.
</p><p>The medium is sometimes female.  It was a woman, for instance, who
introduced these practices on the north coast of Taiarapu, to the scandal
of her own connections, her brother-in-law in particular declaring she
was drunk.  But what shocked Tahiti might seem fit enough in the
Paumotus, the more so as certain women there possess, by the gift of
nature, singular and useful powers.  They say they are honest,
well-intentioned ladies, some of them embarrassed by their weird
inheritance.  And indeed the trouble caused by this endowment is so
great, and the protection afforded so infinitesimally small, that I
hesitate whether to call it a gift or a hereditary curse.  You may rob
this lady’s coco-patch, steal her canoes, burn down her house, and slay
her family scatheless; but one thing you must not do: you must not lay a
hand upon her sleeping-mat, or your belly will swell, and you can only be
cured by the lady or her husband.  Here is the report of an eye-witness,
Tasmanian born, educated, a man who has made money—certainly no fool.  In
1886 he was present in a house on Makatea, where two lads began to
skylark on the mats, and were (I think) ejected.  Instantly after, their
bellies began to swell; pains took hold on them; all manner of island
remedies were exhibited in vain, and rubbing only magnified their
sufferings.  The man of the house was called, explained the nature of the
visitation, and prepared the cure.  A cocoa-nut was husked, filled with
herbs, and with all the ceremonies of a launch, and the utterance of
spells in the Paumotuan language, committed to the sea.  From that moment
the pains began to grow more easy and the swelling to subside.  The
reader may stare.  I can assure him, if he moved much among old residents
of the archipelago, he would be driven to admit one thing of two—either
that there is something in the swollen bellies or nothing in the evidence
of man.
</p><p>I have not met these gifted ladies; but I had an experience of my own,
for I have played, for one night only, the part of the whistling spirit.
It had been blowing wearily all day, but with the fall of night the wind
abated, and the moon, which was then full, rolled in a clear sky.  We
went southward down the island on the side of the lagoon, walking through
long-drawn forest aisles of palm, and on a floor of snowy sand.  No life
was abroad, nor sound of life; till in a clear part of the isle we spied
the embers of a fire, and not far off, in a dark house, heard natives
talking softly.  To sit without a light, even in company, and under
cover, is for a Paumotuan a somewhat hazardous extreme.  The whole
scene—the strong moonlight and crude shadows on the sand, the scattered
coals, the sound of the low voices from the house, and the lap of the
lagoon along the beach—put me (I know not how) on thoughts of
superstition.  I was barefoot, I observed my steps were noiseless, and
drawing near to the dark house, but keeping well in shadow, began to
whistle.  ‘The Heaving of the Lead’ was my air—no very tragic piece.
With the first note the conversation and all movement ceased; silence
accompanied me while I continued; and when I passed that way on my return
I found the lamp was lighted in the house, but the tongues were still
mute.  All night, as I now think, the wretches shivered and were silent.
For indeed, I had no guess at the time at the nature and magnitude of the
terrors I inflicted, or with what grisly images the notes of that old
song had peopled the dark house.
