<article class="w3-container w3-justify">

Surrounded by guardsmen I marched back along the corridors of
the palace of Kulan Tith, Jeddak of Kaol, to the great audience
chamber in the center of the massive structure.
<P>
As I entered the brilliantly lighted apartment, filled with
the nobles of Kaol and the officers of the visiting jeddak,
all eyes were turned upon me.  Upon the great dais at the end
of the chamber stood three thrones, upon which sat Kulan Tith
and his two guests, Matai Shang, and the visiting jeddak.
<P>
Up the broad center aisle we marched beneath deadly silence,
and at the foot of the thrones we halted.
<P>
"Prefer thy charge," said Kulan Tith, turning to one who stood
among the nobles at his right; and then Thurid, the black dator
of the First Born, stepped forward and faced me.
<P>
"Most noble Jeddak," he said, addressing Kulan Tith,
"from the first I suspected this stranger within thy palace.
Your description of his fiendish prowess tallied with that
of the arch-enemy of truth upon Barsoom.
<P>
"But that there might be no mistake I despatched a priest of
your own holy cult to make the test that should pierce his disguise
and reveal the truth.  Behold the result!" and Thurid pointed a
rigid finger at my forehead.
<P>
All eyes followed the direction of that accusing digit--I alone
seemed at a loss to guess what fatal sign rested upon my brow.
<P>
The officer beside me guessed my perplexity; and as the brows of
Kulan Tith darkened in a menacing scowl as his eyes rested upon me,
the noble drew a small mirror from his pocket-pouch and held it
before my face.
<P>
One glance at the reflection it gave back to me was sufficient.
<P>
From my forehead the hand of the sneaking thern had reached out
through the concealing darkness of my bed-chamber and wiped away
a patch of the disguising red pigment as broad as my palm.
Beneath showed the tanned texture of my own white skin.
<P>
For a moment Thurid ceased speaking, to enhance, I suspect,
the dramatic effect of his disclosure.  Then he resumed.
<P>
"Here, O Kulan Tith," he cried, "is he who has desecrated the
temples of the Gods of Mars, who has violated the persons of the
Holy Therns themselves and turned a world against its age-old
religion.  Before you, in your power, Jeddak of Kaol, Defender of
the Holies, stands John Carter, Prince of Helium!"
<P>
Kulan Tith looked toward Matai Shang as though for corroboration
of these charges.  The Holy Thern nodded his head.
<P>
"It is indeed the arch-blasphemer," he said.  "Even now he has
followed me to the very heart of thy palace, Kulan Tith, for the
sole purpose of assassinating me.  He--"
<P>
"He lies!" I cried.  "Kulan Tith, listen that you may know the truth.
Listen while I tell you why John Carter has followed Matai Shang
to the heart of thy palace.  Listen to me as well as to them,
and then judge if my acts be not more in accord with true
Barsoomian chivalry and honor than those of these revengeful
devotees of the spurious creeds from whose cruel bonds I have
freed your planet."
<P>
"Silence!" roared the jeddak, leaping to his feet and laying his hand
upon the hilt of his sword.  "Silence, blasphemer!  Kulan Tith need not
permit the air of his audience chamber to be defiled by the heresies
that issue from your polluted throat to judge you.
<P>
"You stand already self-condemned.  It but remains to determine the
manner of your death.  Even the service that you rendered the arms
of Kaol shall avail you naught; it was but a base subterfuge whereby
you might win your way into my favor and reach the side of this holy
man whose life you craved.  To the pits with him!" he concluded,
addressing the officer of my guard.
<P>
Here was a pretty pass, indeed!  What chance had I against a
whole nation?  What hope for me of mercy at the hands of the
fanatical Kulan Tith with such advisers as Matai Shang and Thurid.
The black grinned malevolently in my face.
<P>
"You shall not escape this time, Earth man," he taunted.
<P>
The guards closed toward me.  A red haze blurred my vision.
The fighting blood of my Virginian sires coursed hot through
my veins.  The lust of battle in all its mad fury was upon me.
<P>
With a leap I was beside Thurid, and ere the devilish smirk
had faded from his handsome face I had caught him full upon the
mouth with my clenched fist; and as the good, old American blow
landed, the black dator shot back a dozen feet, to crumple in a
heap at the foot of Kulan Tith's throne, spitting blood and teeth
from his hurt mouth.
<P>
Then I drew my sword and swung round, on guard, to face a nation.
<P>
In an instant the guardsmen were upon me, but before a blow
had been struck a mighty voice rose above the din of shouting
warriors, and a giant figure leaped from the dais beside Kulan Tith
and, with drawn long-sword, threw himself between me and my adversaries.
<P>
It was the visiting jeddak.
<P>
"Hold!" he cried.  "If you value my friendship, Kulan Tith,
and the age-old peace that has existed between our peoples,
call off your swordsmen; for wherever or against whomsoever
fights John Carter, Prince of Helium, there beside him and
to the death fights Thuvan Dihn, Jeddak of Ptarth."
<P>
The shouting ceased and the menacing points were lowered as a
thousand eyes turned first toward Thuvan Dihn in surprise and then
toward Kulan Tith in question.  At first the Jeddak of Kaol went white
in rage, but before he spoke he had mastered himself, so that his tone
was calm and even as befitted intercourse between two great jeddaks.
<P>
"Thuvan Dihn," he said slowly, "must have great provocation
thus to desecrate the ancient customs which inspire the deportment
of a guest within the palace of his host.  Lest I, too, should
forget myself as has my royal friend, I should prefer to remain
silent until the Jeddak of Ptarth has won from me applause for his
action by relating the causes which provoked it."
<P>
I could see that the Jeddak of Ptarth was of half a mind to
throw his metal in Kulan Tith's face, but he controlled himself
even as well as had his host.
<P>
"None knows better than Thuvan Dihn," he said, "the laws which
govern the acts of men in the domains of their neighbors; but
Thuvan Dihn owes allegiance to a higher law than these--the
law of gratitude.  Nor to any man upon Barsoom does he owe a
greater debt of gratitude than to John Carter, Prince of Helium.
<P>
"Years ago, Kulan Tith," he continued, "upon the occasion of
your last visit to me, you were greatly taken with the charms and
graces of my only daughter, Thuvia.  You saw how I adored her, and
later you learned that, inspired by some unfathomable whim, she had
taken the last, long, voluntary pilgrimage upon the cold bosom of
the mysterious Iss, leaving me desolate.
<P>
"Some months ago I first heard of the expedition which John Carter had
led against Issus and the Holy Therns.  Faint rumors of the atrocities
reported to have been committed by the therns upon those who for
countless ages have floated down the mighty Iss came to my ears.
<P>
"I heard that thousands of prisoners had been released, few of
whom dared to return to their own countries owing to the mandate of
terrible death which rests against all who return from the Valley Dor.
<P>
"For a time I could not believe the heresies which I heard,
and I prayed that my daughter Thuvia might have died before she
ever committed the sacrilege of returning to the outer world.
But then my father's love asserted itself, and I vowed that I
would prefer eternal damnation to further separation from her
if she could be found.
<P>
"So I sent emissaries to Helium, and to the court of Xodar,
Jeddak of the First Born, and to him who now rules those of the
thern nation that have renounced their religion; and from each
and all I heard the same story of unspeakable cruelties and
atrocities perpetrated upon the poor defenseless victims of
their religion by the Holy Therns.
<P>
"Many there were who had seen or known my daughter, and from
therns who had been close to Matai Shang I learned of the
indignities that he personally heaped upon her; and I was glad
when I came here to find that Matai Shang was also your guest,
for I should have sought him out had it taken a lifetime.
<P>
"More, too, I heard, and that of the chivalrous kindness that
John Carter had accorded my daughter.  They told me how he fought
for her and rescued her, and how he spurned escape from the savage
Warhoons of the south, sending her to safety upon his own
thoat and remaining upon foot to meet the green warriors.
<P>
"Can you wonder, Kulan Tith, that I am willing to jeopardize
my life, the peace of my nation, or even your friendship, which I
prize more than aught else, to champion the Prince of Helium?"
<P>
For a moment Kulan Tith was silent.  I could see by the expression
of his face that he was sore perplexed.  Then he spoke.
<P>
"Thuvan Dihn," he said, and his tone was friendly though sad,
"who am I to judge my fellow-man?  In my eyes the Father of Therns
is still holy, and the religion which he teaches the only true religion,
but were I faced by the same problem that has vexed you I doubt not
that I should feel and act precisely as you have.
<P>
"In so far as the Prince of Helium is concerned I may act, but between
you and Matai Shang my only office can be one of conciliation.
The Prince of Helium shall be escorted in safety to the boundary
of my domain ere the sun has set again, where he shall be free
to go whither he will; but upon pain of death must he never
again enter the land of Kaol.
<P>
"If there be a quarrel between you and the Father of Therns,
I need not ask that the settlement of it be deferred until both
have passed beyond the limits of my power.  Are you satisfied,
Thuvan Dihn?"
<P>
The Jeddak of Ptarth nodded his assent, but the ugly scowl that
he bent upon Matai Shang harbored ill for that pasty-faced godling.
<P>
"The Prince of Helium is far from satisfied," I cried,
breaking rudely in upon the beginnings of peace, for I
had no stomach for peace at the price that had been named.
<P>
"I have escaped death in a dozen forms to follow Matai Shang
and overtake him, and I do not intend to be led, like a decrepit
thoat to the slaughter, from the goal that I have won by the
prowess of my sword arm and the might of my muscles.
<P>
"Nor will Thuvan Dihn, Jeddak of Ptarth, be satisfied when he
has heard me through.  Do you know why I have followed Matai Shang
and Thurid, the black dator, from the forests of the Valley Dor
across half a world through almost insurmountable difficulties?
<P>
"Think you that John Carter, Prince of Helium, would stoop to
assassination?  Can Kulan Tith be such a fool as to believe
that lie, whispered in his ear by the Holy Thern or Dator Thurid?
<P>
"I do not follow Matai Shang to kill him, though the God of
mine own planet knows that my hands itch to be at his throat.
I follow him, Thuvan Dihn, because with him are two prisoners--
my wife, Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, and your daughter,
Thuvia of Ptarth.
<P>
"Now think you that I shall permit myself to be led beyond
the walls of Kaol unless the mother of my son accompanies me,
and thy daughter be restored?"
<P>
Thuvan Dihn turned upon Kulan Tith.  Rage flamed in his keen eyes;
but by the masterfulness of his self-control he kept his tones level
as he spoke.
<P>
"Knew you this thing, Kulan Tith?" he asked.  "Knew you that
my daughter lay a prisoner in your palace?"
<P>
"He could not know it," interrupted Matai Shang, white with
what I am sure was more fear than rage.  "He could not know it,
for it is a lie."
<P>
I would have had his life for that upon the spot, but even as
I sprang toward him Thuvan Dihn laid a heavy hand upon my shoulder.
<P>
"Wait," he said to me, and then to Kulan Tith.  "It is not a lie.
This much have I learned of the Prince of Helium--he does not lie.
Answer me, Kulan Tith--I have asked you a question."
<P>
"Three women came with the Father of Therns," replied Kulan Tith.
"Phaidor, his daughter, and two who were reported to be her slaves.
If these be Thuvia of Ptarth and Dejah Thoris of Helium I did not
know it--I have seen neither.  But if they be, then shall they be
returned to you on the morrow."
<P>
As he spoke he looked straight at Matai Shang, not as a devotee
should look at a high priest, but as a ruler of men looks at one
to whom he issues a command.
<P>
It must have been plain to the Father of Therns, as it was to me,
that the recent disclosures of his true character had done much
already to weaken the faith of Kulan Tith, and that it would require
but little more to turn the powerful jeddak into an avowed enemy;
but so strong are the seeds of superstition that even the great
Kaolian still hesitated to cut the final strand that bound him
to his ancient religion.
<P>
Matai Shang was wise enough to seem to accept the mandate of
his follower, and promised to bring the two slave women to the
audience chamber on the morrow.
<P>
"It is almost morning now," he said, "and I should dislike to break
in upon the slumber of my daughter, or I would have them fetched
at once that you might see that the Prince of Helium is mistaken,"
and he emphasized the last word in an effort to affront me so
subtilely that I could not take open offense.
<P>
I was about to object to any delay, and demand that the Princess
of Helium be brought to me forthwith, when Thuvan Dihn made such
insistence seem unnecessary.
<P>
"I should like to see my daughter at once," he said, "but if
Kulan Tith will give me his assurance that none will be permitted
to leave the palace this night, and that no harm shall befall
either Dejah Thoris or Thuvia of Ptarth between now and the moment
they are brought into our presence in this chamber at daylight I
shall not insist."
<P>
"None shall leave the palace tonight," replied the Jeddak of Kaol,
"and Matai Shang will give us assurance that no harm will come
to the two women?"
<P>
The thern assented with a nod.  A few moments later Kulan Tith
indicated that the audience was at an end, and at Thuvan Dihn's
invitation I accompanied the Jeddak of Ptarth to his own apartments,
where we sat until daylight, while he listened to the account of
my experiences upon his planet and to all that had befallen
his daughter during the time that we had been together.
<P>
I found the father of Thuvia a man after my own heart, and that
night saw the beginning of a friendship which has grown until
it is second only to that which obtains between Tars Tarkas,
the green Jeddak of Thark, and myself.
<P>
The first burst of Mars's sudden dawn brought messengers from
Kulan Tith, summoning us to the audience chamber where Thuvan Dihn
was to receive his daughter after years of separation, and I was to
be reunited with the glorious daughter of Helium after an almost
unbroken separation of twelve years.
<P>
My heart pounded within my bosom until I looked about me in
embarrassment, so sure was I that all within the room must hear.
My arms ached to enfold once more the divine form of her
whose eternal youth and undying beauty were but outward
manifestations of a perfect soul.
<P>
At last the messenger despatched to fetch Matai Shang returned.
I craned my neck to catch the first glimpse of those who should
be following, but the messenger was alone.
<P>
Halting before the throne he addressed his jeddak in a voice
that was plainly audible to all within the chamber.
<P>
"O Kulan Tith, Mightiest of Jeddaks," he cried, after the
fashion of the court, "your messenger returns alone, for when he
reached the apartments of the Father of Therns he found them empty,
as were those occupied by his suite."
<P>
Kulan Tith went white.
<P>
A low groan burst from the lips of Thuvan Dihn who stood next me,
not having ascended the throne which awaited him beside his host.
For a moment the silence of death reigned in the great audience
chamber of Kulan Tith, Jeddak of Kaol.  It was he who broke the spell.
<P>
Rising from his throne he stepped down from the dais to the
side of Thuvan Dihn.  Tears dimmed his eyes as he placed both
his hands upon the shoulders of his friend.
<P>
"O Thuvan Dihn," he cried, "that this should have happened in the
palace of thy best friend!  With my own hands would I have wrung
the neck of Matai Shang had I guessed what was in his foul heart.
Last night my life-long faith was weakened--this morning it has
been shattered; but too late, too late.
<P>
"To wrest your daughter and the wife of this royal warrior
from the clutches of these archfiends you have but to command the
resources of a mighty nation, for all Kaol is at your disposal.
What may be done?  Say the word!"
<P>
"First," I suggested, "let us find those of your people who be
responsible for the escape of Matai Shang and his followers.
Without assistance on the part of the palace guard this thing
could not have come to pass.  Seek the guilty, and from them
force an explanation of the manner of their going and the
direction they have taken."
<P>
Before Kulan Tith could issue the commands that would initiate
the investigation a handsome young officer stepped forward and
addressed his jeddak.
<P>
"O Kulan Tith, Mightiest of Jeddaks," he said, "I alone be
responsible for this grievous error.  Last night it was I
who commanded the palace guard.  I was on duty in other parts of
the palace during the audience of the early morning, and knew
nothing of what transpired then, so that when the Father of Therns
summoned me and explained that it was your wish that his party be
hastened from the city because of the presence here of a deadly
enemy who sought the Holy Hekkador's life I did only what a
lifetime of training has taught me was the proper thing to do--
I obeyed him whom I believed to be the ruler of us all,
mightier even than thou, mightiest of jeddaks.
<P>
"Let the consequences and the punishment fall on me alone,
for I alone am guilty.  Those others of the palace guard who
assisted in the flight did so under my instructions."
<P>
Kulan Tith looked first at me and then at Thuvan Dihn, as though
to ask our judgment upon the man, but the error was so evidently
excusable that neither of us had any mind to see the young officer
suffer for a mistake that any might readily have made.
<P>
"How left they," asked Thuvan Dihn, "and what direction did they take?"
<P>
"They left as they came," replied the officer, "upon their own flier.
For some time after they had departed I watched the vessel's lights,
which vanished finally due north."
<P>
"Where north could Matai Shang find an asylum?" asked Thuvan Dihn
of Kulan Tith.
<P>
For some moments the Jeddak of Kaol stood with bowed head,
apparently deep in thought.  Then a sudden light brightened
his countenance.
<P>
"I have it!" he cried.  "Only yesterday Matai Shang let drop
a hint of his destination, telling me of a race of people unlike
ourselves who dwell far to the north.  They, he said, had always
been known to the Holy Therns and were devout and faithful
followers of the ancient cult.  Among them would he find a
perpetual haven of refuge, where no `lying heretics' might
seek him out.  It is there that Matai Shang has gone."
<P>
"And in all Kaol there be no flier wherein to follow," I cried.
<P>
"Nor nearer than Ptarth," replied Thuvan Dihn.
<P>
"Wait!" I exclaimed, "beyond the southern fringe of this great
forest lies the wreck of the thern flier which brought me that far
upon my way.  If you will loan me men to fetch it, and
artificers to assist me, I can repair it in two days, Kulan Tith."
<P>
I had been more than half suspicious of the seeming sincerity
of the Kaolian jeddak's sudden apostasy, but the alacrity with
which he embraced my suggestion, and the despatch with which a
force of officers and men were placed at my disposal entirely
removed the last vestige of my doubts.
<P>
Two days later the flier rested upon the top of the watchtower,
ready to depart.  Thuvan Dihn and Kulan Tith had offered me the
entire resources of two nations--millions of fighting men were
at my disposal; but my flier could hold but one other than
myself and Woola.
<P>
As I stepped aboard her, Thuvan Dihn took his place beside me.
I cast a look of questioning surprise upon him.  He turned to the
highest of his own officers who had accompanied him to Kaol.
<P>
"To you I entrust the return of my retinue to Ptarth," he said.
"There my son rules ably in my absence.  The Prince of Helium
shall not go alone into the land of his enemies.  I have spoken.
Farewell!"
