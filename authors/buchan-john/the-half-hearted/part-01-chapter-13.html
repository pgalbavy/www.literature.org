<p>It was half-way down the glen that the full ignominy of his position
came on Lewis with the shock of a thunder-clap. A hateful bitterness
against her preserver and the tricks of fate had been his solitary
feeling, till suddenly he realized the part he had played, and
saw himself for a naked coward. Coward he called himself&mdash;without
reflection; for in such a moment the mind thinks in crude colours
and bold lines of division. He set his teeth in his lip, and with
a heart sinking at the shameful thought stalked into the farm
stables where the Glenavelin servants were.</p>

<p>He could not return to the Pool. Alice was little hurt, so anxiety
was needless; better let him leave Mr. Stocks to enjoy his heroics
in peace. He would find an excuse; meanwhile, give him quiet and
solitude to digest his bitterness. He cursed himself for the unworthiness
of his thoughts. What a pass had he come to when he grudged a
little <em>kudos</em> to a rival, grudged it churlishly, childishly.
He flung from him the self-reproach. Other people would wonder
at his ungenerousness, and his sulky ill-nature. They would explain
by the first easy discreditable reason. What cared he for their
opinion when he knew the far greater shame in his heart?</p>

<p>For as he strode up the woodland path to Etterick the wrappings
of surface passion fell off from his view of the past hour, and
he saw the bald and naked ribs of his own incapacity. It was a
trivial incident to the world, but to himself a momentous self-revelation.
He was a dreamer, a weakling, a fool. He had hesitated in a crisis,
and another had taken his place. A thousand incidents of ready
courage in past sport and travel were forgotten, and on this single
slip the terrible indictment was founded. And the reason is at
hand; this weakness had at last drawn near to his life's great
passion.</p>

<p>He found a deserted house, but its solitude was too noisy for
his unrest. Bidding the butler tell his friends that he had gone
up the hill, he crossed the sloping lawns and plunged into the
thicket of rhododendrons. Soon he was out on the heather, with
the great slopes, scorched with the heat, lying still and fragrant
before him. He felt sick and tired, and flung himself down amid
the soft brackens.</p>

<p>It was the man's first taste of bitter mental anguish. Hitherto
his life had been equable and pleasant; his friends had adored
him; the world had flattered him; he had been at peace with his
own soul. He had known his failings, but laughed at them cavalierly;
he stood on a different platform from the struggling, conscience-stricken
herd. Now he had in very truth been flung neck and crop from the
pedestal of his self-esteem; and he lay groaning in the dust of
abasement.</p>

<p>Wratislaw guessed with a friend's instinct his friend's disquietude,
and turned his steps to the hill when he had heard the butler's
message. He had known something of Lewis's imaginary self-upbraidings,
and he was prepared for them, but he was not prepared for the
grey and wretched face in the lee of the pinewood. A sudden suspicion
that Lewis had been guilty of some real dishonour flashed across
his mind for the moment, only to be driven out with scorn.</p>

<p>"Lewie, my son, what the deuce is wrong with you?" he cried.</p>

<p>The other looked at him with miserable eyes.</p>

<p>"I am beginning to find out my rottenness."</p>

<p>Wratislaw laughed in spite of himself. "What a fool to go making
psychological discoveries on such a day! Is it all over the little
misfortune at the pool?"</p>

<p>Tragedy grew in Lewis's eyes. "Don't laugh, old chap. You don't
know what I did. I let her fall into the water, and then I stood
staring and let another man&mdash;the other man&mdash;save her."</p>

<p>"Well, and what about that? He had a better chance than you.
You shouldn't grudge him his good fortune."</p>

<p>"Good Lord, man, you don't think it's that that's troubling me!
I felt murderous, but it wasn't on his account."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked the older man drily. "You love the girl, and
he's in the running with you. What more?"</p>

<p>Lewis groaned. "How can I talk about loving her when my love
is such a trifling thing that it doesn't nerve me to action? I
tell you I love her body and soul. I live for her. The whole world
is full of her. She is never a second out of my thoughts. And
yet I am so little of a man that I let her come near death and
never try to save her."</p>

<p>"But, confound it, man, it may have been mere absence of mind.
You were always an extraordinarily plucky chap." Wratislaw spoke
irritably, for it seemed to him sheer folly.</p>

<p>Lewis looked at him imploringly. "Can you not understand?" he
cried.</p>

<p>Wratislaw did understand, and suddenly. The problem was subtler
than he had thought. Weakness was at the core of it, weakness
revealed in self-deception and self-accusation alike, the weakness
of the finical dreamer, the man with the unrobust conscience.
But the weakness which Lewis arraigned himself on was the very
obvious failing of the diffident and the irresolute. Wratislaw
tried the path of boisterous encouragement.</p>

<p>"Get up, you old fool, and come down to the house. You a coward!
You are simply a romancer with an unfortunate knack of tragedy."
The man must be laughed out of this folly. If he were not he would
show the self-accusing front to the world, and the Manorwaters,
Alice, Stocks&mdash;all save his chosen intimates&mdash;would credit him
with a cowardice of which he had no taint.</p>

<p>Arthur and George, resigned now to the inevitable lady, had seen
in the incident only the anxiety of a man for his beloved, and
just a hint of the ungenerous in his treatment of Mr. Stocks.
They were not prepared for the silent tragic figure which Wratislaw
brought with him.</p>

<p>Arthur had a glint of the truth, but the obtuse George saw nothing.
"Do you know that you are going to have the Wisharts for neighbours
for a couple of months yet? Old Wishart has taken Glenavelin from
the end of August."</p>

<p>This would have been pleasant hearing at another time, but now
it simply drove home the nail of his bitter reflections. Alice
would be near him, a terrible reproach&mdash;she, the devotee of strength
and competence. He could not win her, and it is characteristic
of the man that he had ceased to think of Mr. Stocks as his rival.
He would lose her to no rival; to his ragged incapacity alone
would his ill fortune be due.</p>

<p>He struggled to act the part of the cheerful host, and Wratislaw
watched his efforts grimly. He ate little at dinner, showed no
desire to smoke, and played billiards so badly that Wratislaw,
an execrable player, won the first and last game of his life.
The victor took him out of doors thereafter to walk on the moonlit,
fragrant lawn.</p>

<p>"You are taking things to heart," said he.</p>

<p>"And I'm blessed if I can understand you. To me it's sheer mania."</p>

<p>"And to me it's the last link in a chain. I have suspected myself
for long, now I know myself and&mdash;ugh! the knowledge is a hideous
thing."</p>

<p>Wratislaw stood regarding his companion seriously. "I wonder
what will happen to you, Lewie. Life is serious enough without
inventing a crotchety virtue to make it miserable."</p>

<p>"Can't you understand me, Tommy? It isn't that I'm a cad, it's
that I am a coward. I couldn't be a cad supposing I tried. These
things are a matter chiefly of blood and bone, and I am not made
that way. But God help me! I am a coward. I can't fight worth
twopence. Look at my performance a fortnight ago. The ordinary
gardener's boy can beat me at making love. I am full of generous
impulses and sentiments, but what's the use of them? Everything
grows cold and I am a dumb icicle when it comes to action. I knew
all this before, but I thought I had kept my bodily courage. I've
had a good enough training, and I used to have pluck."</p>

<p>"But you don't mean to tell me that it was funk that kept you
out of the pool to-day?" cried the impatient Wratislaw.</p>

<p>"How do I know that it wasn't?" came the wretched answer.</p>

<p>Wratislaw turned on his heel and made to go back.</p>

<p>"You're an infernal idiot, Lewie, and an infernal child. Thank
heaven! your friends know you better than you know yourself."</p>

<p>The next morning it was a different man who came down to breakfast.
He had lost his haggard air, and seemed to have forgotten the
night's episode.</p>

<p>"Was I very rude to everybody last night?" he asked. "I have
a vague recollection of playing the fool."</p>

<p>"You were particularly rude about yourself," said Wratislaw.</p>

<p>The young man laughed. "It's a way I have sometimes. It's an
awkward thing when a man's foes are of his own household."</p>

<p>The others seemed to see a catch in his mirth, a ring as of something
hollow. He opened some letters, and looked up from one with a
twitching face and a curious droop of the eyelids. "Miss Wishart
is all right," he said. "My aunt says that she is none the worse,
but that Stocks has caught a tremendous cold. An unromantic ending!"</p>

<p>The meal ended, they wandered out to the lawn to smoke, and Wratislaw
found himself standing with a hand on his host's shoulder. He
noticed something distraught in his glance and air.</p>

<p>"Are you fit again to-day?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Quite fit, thanks," said Lewis, but his face belied him. He
had forgiven himself the incident of yesterday, but no proof of
a non sequitur could make him relinquish his dismal verdict. The
wide morning landscape lay green and soothing at his feet. Down
in the glen men were winning the bog-hay; up on the hill slopes
they were driving lambs; the Avelin hurried to the Gled, and beyond
was the great ocean and the infinite works of man. The whole brave
bustling world was astir, little and great ships hasting out of
port, the soldier scaling the breach, the adventurer travelling
the deserts. And he, the fool, had no share in this braggart heritage.
He could not dare to look a man straight in the face, for like
the king in the old fable he had lost his soul.</p>
