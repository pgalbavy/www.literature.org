<p>At last the clothing of Jack Dudley was dried, and he felt thoroughly
comfortable in body. While he was employed in the pleasant task,
Hank Hazletine went away in quest of food. It took time and hard
work to find it, but his remarkable skill as a hunter enabled
him to do so, and when he returned he brought enough venison to
serve for the evening and morning meal. No professor of the culinary
art could have prepared the meat more excellently than he over
the bed of live coals. The odor was so appetizing that the youth
was in misery because of his impatience, but the guide would not
let him touch a mouthful until the food was done "to the queen's
taste." Then they had their feast.</p>

<p>And yet the two were oppressed by thoughts of the absent one.
The attempts of his friends during the day to help or to get trace
of Fred Greenwood had been brought to naught, and it looked as
if they would have to consent to the humiliating terms of Tozer
and Motoza, with strong probability that the missing youth was
never again to be seen alive.</p>

<p>"I think, Hank," said Jack, when the cowman had lit his pipe,
"that we should run no more risks."</p>

<p>"How can we help it?"</p>

<p>"When you meet Tozer to-morrow morning by appointment, tell him
the price he asks will be paid, but everything must be square
and above board."</p>

<p>The guide looked at his companion a moment in silence. Then he
said:</p>

<p>"If you'll turn the matter over in your mind, younker, you'll
see that this bus'ness can't be put through without giving the
scamps the chance to swindle us the worst sort of way. They won't
give up the boy on our promise to pay 'em the money and no questions
asked, for they don't b'leve we'll do it; so we've got to give
'em the money and trust to their honor to keep their part. Trust
to their <em>honor</em>," repeated Hank, with all the scorn he
could throw into voice and manner; "as if they knowed what it
means."</p>

<p>"I know from what you have said that Tozer and Motoza are cunning,
but&#11834;"</p>

<p>In order to receive all the warmth possible, Jack Dudley was
sitting within the cavern and facing outward, while his companion
faced him, with his back toward the plateau and mountains beyond.
Jack suddenly broke off his remark, for in the gloom behind the
cowman he saw something move. That something quickly took the
form of a white-faced, exhausted youth trudging painfully forward
and ready to sink to the ground with weakness.</p>

<p>"Heavens! can it be?" gasped Jack, half-rising to his feet and
staring across the camp-fire. The next moment, and while Hazletine
was looking in the same direction, as astounded as the youth,
the elder made one bound and was at the side of Fred Greenwood,
whom he caught in his arms as he sagged downward in a state of
utter collapse.</p>

<p>In the course of the following hour everything was made clear.
Under the tender ministrations of Jack Dudley and Hank Hazletine
the returned wanderer recovered to a great degree his strength,
and to the fullest degree his naturally buoyant spirits. The faint
odor of the broiling meat which lingered in the air awoke his
ravenous appetite, but knowing how long he had been without food,
the cowman would not permit him to eat more than a tithe of what
he craved. After a time he gave him more, until his appetite was
fairly well satisfied.</p>

<p>"Jack," said Fred, with something of his old waggishness, as
he looked across the fire into the face of his comrade, "let's
go home."</p>

<p>"You forget that we have a month's vacation, and it is hardly
half gone. We can stay another week and then be sure of being
back to school in time. You lamented more than I because we could
not have a longer play-spell. Your sentiments have changed."</p>

<p>The younger lad pointed to his feet.</p>

<p>"There's the reason. If I were like you I shouldn't think of
leaving this delightful country until the last day; but I shall
need all the vacation to get on my feet again. Do you comprehend?"</p>

<p>"Yes; your demonstration is logical. True, you have lost your
rifle and pistol, the same as myself, but we could get others
at the ranch, and no doubt meet with plenty more enjoyable adventures,
but not as you are. I shall be very willing to start home with
you to-morrow morning. What do you think of it, Hank?"</p>

<p>"I'm blamed sorry this bus'ness has to wind up as it does, but
there's no help fur it, and we'll leave fur the ranch after breakfast."</p>

<p>"Will you keep your appointment with Tozer?"</p>

<p>"I've been thinking of that; yes, I'll meet him."</p>

<p>There was a peculiar intonation in these words that caused both
boys to look into that bearded face, but they could not be sure
of his meaning.</p>

<p>It was Fred who spoke:</p>

<p>"Hank, there is one matter as to which I cannot feel certain;
I want your opinion of it."</p>

<p>"Wal, I'm listening."</p>

<p>"After Motoza forced me into the cavern at the side of the canyon
he went off and has not returned yet, unless he did so after I
left. Now, why didn't he go back?"</p>

<p>"Why should he go back? He felt sartin there was no way fur you
to git out, and if I'd been told that your only chance was to
climb the wall I'd 'greed with him, though you struck the spot
where I done it myself."</p>

<p>"He must have known I hadn't a mouthful of food?"</p>

<p>"He couldn't help knowing it."</p>

<p>"The question in my mind is this: what he said to me, as well
as what you have told, proves that he understood the whole scheme
of my being ransomed. Tozer must have known where I was; he knew
that to bring the ransom business to a head would require several
days, even with the use of the telegraph; they expected me to
stay in the cavern all the time. How long would they have left
me there without bringing me anything to eat?"</p>

<p>"They'd never brought you anything."</p>

<p>"Then when the time came to surrender me to my friends I should
have been dead."</p>

<p>The cowman nodded his head.</p>

<p>"There ain't no doubt of that."</p>

<p>"And they couldn't have carried out their part of the agreement."</p>

<p>"Which the same they knowed."</p>

<p>"But it seems unreasonable. It would have placed both in peril,
from which I cannot see how it was possible for them to escape.
If they gave me up after receiving the money they would be safe
against punishment. Why, then, should they place themselves in
such great danger when they had nothing to gain and all to lose
by doing so? That is what I can't understand, and I am sure my
brain has become clearer."</p>

<p>It was the same view of the question that had puzzled Jack Dudley,
and the two boys listened with interest to the explanation of
the veteran.</p>

<p>"Tozer of himself would turn you over sound in limb and body;
but, since it was the Sioux who done all the work, as you have
showed us, Bill had to make a sort of compromise with the villain,
and that compromise was that you should be left with Motoza till
the hour come fur you to be produced. That was the price Bill
had to pay Motoza fur what he done. It wasn't Tozer, but the Sioux,
that was fixing things so as to starve you to death."</p>

<p>The cowman spoke with a deliberation and seriousness that left
no doubt he believed every word uttered, and the boys were convinced
he was right.</p>

<p>"Bill is as mean as they make 'em," added Hazletine, "but he'd
rather grab a pile of money than kill a chap he don't like. It's
t'other way with the Sioux. He likes money well 'nough, fur he
knows it'll buy firewater, but the sweetest enjoyment he can have
is to revenge himself on a person he hates, and from what I've
heard he hates you as hard as he knows how."</p>

<p>"There is no doubt of that," said Jack; "I shall never forget
the expression of his face when Fred made him give up my rifle."</p>

<p>Fred was thoughtful a moment, and then asked:</p>

<p>"Hank, what do you mean to do about Tozer?"</p>

<p>"Wal, until I larned your story I was fixed to shoot him on sight."</p>

<p>"But what of the agreement you would have to make before he gave
me up?"</p>

<p>"I'd kept that the same as the other folks, but it wouldn't be
long afore I'd git a chance to pick a quarrel with him over other
matters, and then it would be him or me; and," added the cowman,
with a grim smile, "I don't think it would be me."</p>

<p>"Do you still hold to that resolve?"</p>

<p>"I can't say that I do. I don't see that Bill meant any hurt
except to make some money out of you, and he couldn't help taking
chances on that. If he could have had his way he'd turned you
over to us as well as when you left; so I think I'll wait to see
what his next trick is to be afore I draw a bead on him. I'll
take another plan &mdash;I'll give him the laugh."</p>

<p>"Give him the laugh!" repeated the wondering Jack Dudley; "what
do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"I'll meet him here to-morrer morning, and, after we've talked
a while, let him see you or know how things stand, and then I'll
just laugh at him till I drop to the ground and roll over on my
back. Won't he feel cheap?"</p>

<p>The conceit was so odd that both boys smiled.</p>

<p>"That certainly is a curious way to punish a man for doing a
wrong. It seems to me that, since he had so much to do with abducting
Fred, he ought to be arrested, tried, and punished. He should
be made to suffer for his crime."</p>

<p>Hank showed his hard sense by replying:</p>

<p>"I don't deny that, but there's no way of punishing him. He hasn't
done a thing fur which you could make the court say he's guilty.
The younker there that spent more time than he liked in the canyon
has never even seed Bill Tozer. What reason, then, has he fur
saying Bill had anything to do with the bus'ness?"</p>

<p>"Didn't he admit as much to you?"</p>

<p>"Not a word! He give himself away in his talk, but whenever he
said anything 'bout things he reminded me it was all guesswork."</p>

<p>"Could not Motoza be made to swear against him?"</p>

<p>"He might, and he might not. If he did, why, Bill would swear
t'other way, and make it look as if he was trying to play the
friend for the younker. It would be like some folks, after the
thing was over, proposing to buy Bill a gold medal fur showing
himself such a good and noble man. No; my plan is best. When I
give him the laugh he'll feel worse than if he was sent up fur
ten years."</p>

<p>"It looks as if there is no other way of punishing him," remarked
Fred; "but the case is different with Motoza."</p>

<p>"Wal, <em>rather</em>!"</p>

<p>It would be impossible to convey a true idea of the manner of
Hank Hazletine when he uttered these words. He nodded his head,
clinched his free hand, and his eyes seemed to flash fire.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to kill him, Hank?"</p>

<p>"O, no," was the scornful response; "I'm going to take his hand
and tell him how much I love him. I'll wipe the paint off one
cheek, so as to make room fur a brotherly kiss. I'll send him
to your folks, that you may have him for a playmate. He'll be
so sweet and nice among the little younkers. <em>That's</em> what
I'll do with dear Motoza!"</p>

<p>It was impossible not to read the terrible purpose that lay behind
all this. The boys made no mistake. Jack Dudley shuddered, but
was silent. He knew the miscreant richly merited the threatened
retribution, and yet he wished it were not impending.</p>

<p>Surely, if anyone was justified in calling down vengeance upon
the head of the vagrant Sioux it was his victim&mdash;he who had felt
his hatred, and whose physical sufferings must remind him of the
same for weeks to come. But Fred Greenwood was in a gracious and
forgiving mood. His heart throbbed when he recalled what he had
so recently passed through, but he could not lose sight of the
blessed fact that he <em>had</em> passed through it all. He was
with his beloved comrade again, not much the worse for his experience.
In truth he was a little homesick, and was stirred with sweet
delight at the thought that, if all went well, he should be with
his parents within the coming week.</p>

<p>And yet he was oppressed by the thought that one of the results
of his short visit to Wyoming was to be the death of a human being.
He was sure he could never shake off the remembrance, and should
he ever wish to return in the future to renew his hunt under more
favorable conditions, the memory would haunt him. It mattered
not that the wretch deserved to be executed for the crime, in
the commission of which he had been interrupted before he could
complete it. He was a savage, a heathen, a barbarian, who was
following the light as he understood it. Why, therefore, should
not mercy be shown to him?</p>

<p>There are many things which Jack Dudley and Fred Greenwood have
done during their youthful lives that are creditable to them,
but there is none which gives the two greater pleasure than the
remembrance of the moral victory gained in their argument with
Hank Hazletine. Fred opened the plea, and his comrade quickly
rallied to his help. Their aim was to convince their guide that
it was wrong for him to carry out his purpose regarding the Sioux.
That the fellow should be punished was not to be questioned, but
it should be done in a legitimate way and by the constituted authorities.
Hazletine insisted that the conditions were such that Motoza would
never be thus punished, at least not to the extent he ought to
be; therefore, it was the duty of Hazletine to attend to the matter
himself.</p>

<p>The argument lasted for two hours. The boys were able, bright
and ingenious, but they had <em>truth</em> on their side, and
by and by the grim cowman showed signs of weakening. What knocked
the props from under him was the fact which he was compelled to
admit that the Sioux was only following the teachings he had received
from infancy; that he lacked the light and knowledge with which
Hazletine had been favored; that it was the duty of the white
people to educate, civilize and Christianize the red men, who
have been treated with cruel injustice from the very discovery
of our country.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that the guide yielded with good grace, but
yield he did, and the victory was secured. He pledged the boys
not to offer any harm to Motoza for his last crime, and indeed
would never harm him, unless it should become necessary in self
defence.</p>

<p>"But I s'pose you hain't any 'bjection to my giving the laugh
to Bill?" he said, with ludicrous dismay; "there ain't nothing
wrong in <em>that</em>, is there?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," replied the pleased Fred; "we shall enjoy it
as much as you."</p>

<p>"Which the same being the case, it's time you went to sleep;
I'll keep watch and call you when I git ready."</p>

<p>Bidding their friend good-night, the boys wrapped themselves
in their blankets and speedily sank into slumber.</p>

<p>The kind-hearted guide did not disturb either, and when they
opened their eyes the sun was in the sky. Fred Greenwood was in
a bad shape with his swollen and lacerated feet, but his naturally
rugged frame recovered rapidly from the trying strain to which
it had been subjected. He proved that his appetite was as vigorous
as ever, and was eager to reach the ranch with the least possible
delay. Hank promised him no time should be wasted.</p>

<p>A lookout was kept for Bill Tozer, the boys remaining in the
cavern, where they could not be seen. There was the possibility,
of course, that the man had learned of the escape of the young
prisoner, but all doubt was removed when, at the appointed time,
he appeared on the edge of the plateau and strode confidently
to the point where Hazletine, just outside the cavern, awaited
his coming.</p>

<p>The two shook hands and immediately got down to business. The
scamp felt that he commanded the situation and he was disposed
to push matters.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking over what you said yesterday," remarked the
guide, "and have made up my mind that I can't do it."</p>

<p>"You can't, eh? It's the only thing you <em>can</em> do; Motoza
insists that the price shall be ten thousand dollars, but I'll
stick by the original agreement and call it half that sum."</p>

<p>"Let me see," said the cowman, thoughtfully; "you promise to
give us back the younker safe and sound, provided his friends
hand you five thousand dollars?"</p>

<p>"That's it; you understand the whole business. You know, of course,
Hank, that I'm only acting as the friend&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don't git over any more of that stuff, Bill. Are we to give
you the money afore you produce the younker?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; that's the only way to do business."</p>

<p>"S'pose you bring him, and then I'll ask his folks if they want
to make you a present of five thousand dollars&mdash;how'll <em>that</em>
work?"</p>

<p>Tozer broke into laughter.</p>

<p>"You ought to be ashamed to talk such nonsense. The only way
by which you can see your young friend again is to hand us the
money, give a pledge not to ask any questions or try to punish
Motoza or me&#11834;"</p>

<p>The jaw of the man suddenly dropped and he ceased speaking, for
at that moment he saw Jack Dudley and his limping companion walk
out from the cavern and smilingly approach.</p>

<p>The whole truth flashed upon him. He was outwitted as he had
never been outwitted before in all his life. Without speaking
a syllable, he wheeled around and started at a rapid stride across
the plateau toward the point where he had first appeared, with
feelings which it is impossible to imagine.</p>

<p>And didn't Hank Hazletine "give him the laugh?" He bent over
with mirth, staggering backward until he had to place his hand
against the side of the cavern to save himself from falling. It
really seemed as if his uproarious mirth must have penetrated
a mile in every direction, and it did not cease until some minutes
after the discomfited victim had disappeared. Jack and Fred laughed,
too, until their sides ached; and who shall deny that there was
not full cause for their merriment?</p>

<p>An hour later, the ponies, saddled and bridled, were threading
their way out of the foot-hills for the ranch, which was reached
without further incident. There the boys remained several days
until Fred had recovered to a large extent from his hurts, when
they rode to the station at Fort Steele, where they shook hands
with the honest Hank Hazletine and bade him good-by.</p>

<p>And thus it came about that on the first Monday in the following
November Jack Dudley and Fred Greenwood were in their respective
seats at school, as eager and ambitious to press their studies
as they had been to visit Bowman's ranch, in Southwestern Wyoming,
in which ranch, by the way, they advised Mr. Dudley to retain
his half-ownership.</p>

<p>"It's worth all it cost you, father," said Jack, "and perhaps
one of these days you will want the V. W. W. to go out and take
another look at it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," was the dubious reply of the parent.</p>
