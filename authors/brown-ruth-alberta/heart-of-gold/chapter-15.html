<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was a hot June night. Not a breath of air was stirring, and
in the great Danbury Hospital every window was opened its widest.
Yet the patients lay panting and sweltering on their cots. Peace,
in her room, tossed and turned restlessly, dozed a few minutes,
then wakened, changed her position, trying to find a cooler spot,
and finally in desperation, raised her hand and jerked the bell-cord
dangling at the head of her bed. She could hear the answering
whir in the hall outside, but no one came to minister to her wants,
and after an impatient wait of a few seconds, she repeated the
summons.</p>

<p>Still no one came.</p>

<p>"What in creation can be the matter with Miss Hays, I wonder,"
she muttered, and savagely pulled the cord for the third time.</p>

<p>There was a faint patter of rapid steps through the corridor,
and the night nurse, flushed and perspiring, flew into the room.
"What is it?" she asked crisply, mopping her warm face after a
hasty survey of the small patient.</p>

<p>"O," exclaimed Peace in relief. "It's you at last! I thought
you were never coming. Is it hot outside tonight, or is it just
me that's hot?"</p>

<p>Poor, hurried, steaming Miss Hays glared down at the tumbled
figure on the bed, and snapped, "It's <em>me</em> that's hot!
Did you chase me clear down two flights of stairs just to ask
that question?"</p>

<p>"You <em>do</em> look warm," said Peace in conciliatory tones,
not quite understanding the cause of Miss Hays' evident wrath.</p>

<p>"I <em>am</em> warm,&mdash;decidedly warm under the collar!" Suddenly
the funny side of the situation burst upon her, and she laughed
hysterically. It was utterly ridiculous to think of the haste
she had made to answer the frantic summons of that bell!</p>

<p>Then, with an effort she controlled her merriment, and asked
soberly, "Was there anything you wanted?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;that is &mdash;Hark! What is that noise? It sounds like
a little baby crying. That's the third time tonight I've heard
it squall."</p>

<p>Miss Hays obediently strained her ears to listen. "It does sound
like a child, doesn't it?" she admitted, as the plaintive wail
was repeated. "Who can it be?"</p>

<p>"Seems as if it came from the other part of the building," said
Peace, peering across the moonlit court toward the windows of
the opposite wing.</p>

<p>"But there are no babies over there," the nurse objected. "Nearly
all the patients in that section are old men, and the nurses'
rooms are on the top floor."</p>

<p>"Well, that's where the crying comes from anyway," Peace insisted,
as another low, persistent wail rose on the midnight air. "Are
you <em>sure</em> there ain't <em>any</em> babies over there?"</p>

<p>"None that I know of. I'll go investigate. It's queer that Miss
Gee did not mention it to me if any new patients were brought
in there today."</p>

<p>Puzzled Miss Hays turned to go when Peace stopped her with an
imperative, "Wait! There's a nightcap sticking out of a topfloor
window. I guess it's going to holler."</p>

<p>"Nightcap? Where?" demanded the nurse, again staring out over
the court toward the other wing of the hospital.</p>

<p>"It looked like one, but it's gone in out of sight. O, I know
I saw it. There! What did I tell you!"</p>

<p>Peace was right. From an open window in the nurses' quarters
a white-capped head slowly protruded, followed by a huge pitcher.
There was a sound of splashing water, a startled caterwaul from
the lawn below, some excited spitting and scratching, and two
black shapes streaked across the court to the street. The wailing
ceased. Silence reigned.</p>

<p>"Cats!" exclaimed Miss Hays in disgust.</p>

<p>"Making that crying noise?" demanded incredulous Peace.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Not babies at all?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll &mdash;Say, that water splashed in through the window
of the room below. Listen to that man&mdash;swear! He's saying dreadful
things! Can't you hear him?"</p>

<p>"I must go," the nurse ejaculated, when a swift survey of the
windows opposite had proved that the child's observations were
correct; but even as she darted through the doorway, the buzzer
in the hall whirred viciously, and Peace heard her mutter, "My
sakes! but the old gentleman is mad!"</p>

<p>Once more quiet descended over the great building, and for a
long time Peace lay chuckling over the night's unusual adventure.
Then in spite of the heat she at length fell asleep. Nor did she
waken until the sun was high in the sky and the bustle of the
busy city floated up through the open window.</p>

<p>The first thing she was conscious of was the sound of Dr. Shumway's
voice sharp with bitter disappointment, and by craning her neck
almost to breaking point, she could catch a glimpse of his coat-tails
through the open door, as he said to some invisible audience,
"No, we can hope for absolutely nothing from that source now,
and we do need that addition so badly. Why, man alive it would
mean a chance for hundreds of helpless babies. We simply haven't
the room to accept charity cases now. Every bed in the institution
filled this morning! What a record! But we have had to turn away
ten cases this past month because we were too crowded to take
charity patients."</p>

<p>"What did the old codger have to say to the committee?" asked
another voice, which Peace recognized as that of Dr. Race, though
she could not see him.</p>

<p>"He wasn't even <em>decent</em> about it. Said if his father
had seen fit to spend half his fortune erecting this hospital,
it was no sign that he intended to follow his example. What is
more, he declared that we never would see another red cent of
Danbury money if he could help it. Called his father an old fool
and every other uncomplimentary name he could think of."</p>

<p>"Did you remind him that his father had intended to build this
addition that we are so anxious for?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and got laughed at for my pains. If only old John Danbury
could have lived to see his building completed! He used to say
he cared for no other monument than Danbury Hospital."</p>

<p>"Do you know," said a new voice thoughtfully, "I think he recognized
the worthlessness of his profligate son, and planned to sink his
whole fortune in this institution? Money has been the curse of
Robson Danbury's life, and his father knew that the only hope
of making anything like a man out of him was the cutting him off
without a cent, but the Death Angel claimed him before he had
finished his plans."</p>

<p>"Well, that doesn't help us out of our predicament," said Dr.
Race in his crisp, curt tones. "How are we to get our addition
built?"</p>

<p>"Go to the Church for it,&mdash;that's our only course now," suggested
Dr. Shumway resignedly.</p>

<p>"The Church! Good gracious, man! The church is bled to death
now with its collections for this and subscriptions for that,"
declared Dr. Rosencrans impatiently. "They won't listen to our
cry for help. I'm sorry this hospital is a denominational institution.
It is a serious handicap."</p>

<p>"It ought not to be," said Dr. Shumway stoutly. "Our people should
be proud of the chance to give to such a cause."</p>

<p>"But the fact still remains that they raise a howl or have a
fit every time they are asked for a copper," returned Dr. Rosencrans
pessimistically.</p>

<p>"Well, what are you going to do about it?" demanded Dr. Race
briskly. "Got anything tangible to work upon?"</p>

<p>"I happen to know that the bishop will give us his heartiest
co-operation," Dr. Shumway answered. "We must confer with him
and plan a state-wide campaign. We've simply <em>got</em> to have
that addition."</p>

<p>"Then it's to be the same old song and dance?" inquired Dr. Rosencrans
in deep disgust. "We'll send out a professional beggar to the
different churches of the state, and then sit back and wait for
the money to roll in?"</p>

<p>"What is your plan?" quietly asked Dr. Shumway, but in such a
tone that Peace, straining to catch every word, fairly jumped
from her cot, and wondered whether there was to be a fight.</p>

<p>"I have none," was the sulky reply, "but I'm tired of this lemon-squeezing
farce. We can never raise a thousand dollars, let alone seventy-five
thousand."</p>

<p>"I suggest that we take twenty-four hours to think on this thing
before we make any decisions," suggested Dr. Race in soothing
tones. "It is too important a question to settle without considerable
thought."</p>

<p>"Good idea," seconded another voice, and after a brief parley
as to their next meeting, the group of physicians just outside
Peace's door dispersed about their various duties.</p>

<p>But they had left the brown-eyed maid much food for thought.
Some of their conversation had puzzled her, but she gathered from
their remarks that an addition to the hospital had become necessary,
and for some reason seemed unobtainable, except by appealing to
the churches for the money to build, which the doctors seemed
loath to do.</p>

<p>"I'll ask Gail, she'll know," Peace promised herself, when she
found that she could not untangle the puzzling questions without
further explanation.</p>

<p>So when Gail entered the white room that afternoon, the small
sister was ready with an avalanche of queries. "Why ain't the
hospital big enough as 'tis? What do they need an <em>edition</em>
for? Why won't Robinson Danbury give them any money, and why do
they think he ought to? What's the matter with the churches and
how do they bleed to death?"</p>

<p>Gail stopped short in her tracks. "Why, girlie!" she cried apprehensively,
noting the scarlet flush on the thin cheeks, "what do you mean?
What is the matter? Have you been dreaming? What are you talking
about?"</p>

<p>So Peace told her of the conference held that morning just outside
her door, and Gail listened attentively, surprised that the small
maid should display such interest in a question supposed to concern
only her elders.</p>

<p>"What's all the fuss about?" Peace asked a second time before
Gail could decide whether or not it would be advisable to try
to explain.</p>

<p>"Well," she said at length, "it happens that this is the only
hospital in the state which belongs to our church,&mdash;that is, to
our denomination, you understand. A man by the name of John Danbury
planned and built it with his own money, and gave it to the church
with the understanding that it was to be supported by our people.
His plan was to have the hospital take only poor patients, but
even with the church's help they couldn't anywhere nearly pay
their way when they did that, and they have had to accept pay
patients almost entirely. So rather than give up this pet idea
of his, Mr. Danbury decided to build an addition just for charity
cases. But he died without a will,&mdash;that is, without anything
to show how he wanted his money spent, and his son, Robson, got
it all. The son was hurt in a railroad accident about a month
ago, and was brought here to be treated. Up to that time, he had
absolutely refused to give the Hospital Board a dollar toward
carrying out his father's wishes, although he himself knew what
the plans had been. But while he was here, he sort of changed
his mind. I suppose he had never before realized how many people
a hospital reaches; and he hinted that perhaps after all he might
do a <em>little</em> to help the Board build its addition. The
committee was to visit him this morning and get his definite answer,
but last night some cats got to squalling in the court under his
window, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," Peace interrupted. "It sounded, like a baby. I started
Miss Hays off to find out who it was."</p>

<p>"Well, it bothered the nurses who were off duty, too, and finally
Miss Gee could stand it no longer, so she deluged the cats with
a pitcher of water,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and some of it landed on the sill just under her window,
and spattered a sick man inside. Mercy! how he swore!"</p>

<p>"And that sick man was Robson Danbury."</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious!" gasped Peace. "No wonder he won't build
any more hospital."</p>

<p>"It is such a pity to act so childish about it."</p>

<p>"I s'pose it does seem so to everyone else, but just s'posing
<em>you</em> had got settled comfortable on a <em>boiling</em>
hot night, and someone spilled water all over you. How would you
like it?"</p>

<p>"But it was purely an accident, Peace."</p>

<p>"Accidents don't always make a fellow feel nice," the child asserted.
"And the committee oughtn't to have visited him just after he
got half drowned. They might have known he'd be ugly."</p>

<p>"They knew nothing whatever of the accident until he told them.
It seems that even Miss Gee herself did not realize that anything
but the cats had been soaked, He was so angry that he refused
to stay here any longer, and as soon as he could get his clothes
on, the ambulance took him home. It is such a shame, for the hospital
does need more room so badly, and now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'F I was the hospital, I'd just show him that I could build
all the rooms I wanted to without any of his old money."</p>

<p>"O, they intend to try to raise seventy-five thousand dollars
by subscriptions from the churches. That was decided today. But
it will be a hard job."</p>

<p>"Who's going to do it?"</p>

<p>"Do what?"</p>

<p>"Why, the work, of course. You said it would be a hard job."</p>

<p>"O, they mean to open the campaign next Sunday in Martindale,
and the bishop is to preach the first sermon. After that, Rev.
Mr. Murdock will do most of the preaching. He is secretary of
the Hospital Association, you know."</p>

<p>"Is the bishop to preach in <em>our</em> church?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And take up a collection?"</p>

<p>"A subscription one."</p>

<p>"And I won't be there! Why couldn't they wait till I got home?"</p>

<p>"They must begin at once, dear, if they hope to raise such a
great sum before Conference."</p>

<p>"What's the difference between a collection and a <em>perscription</em>?"</p>

<p>"_Sub_scription, child. Well&mdash;er&mdash;we take up collections every
Sunday in our regular services, but a subscription gives the people
a longer time to pay what they have promised."</p>

<p>The conversation turned to other subjects, but had Gail only
known it, the busy brain under the curly brown thatch was puzzling
over ways and means of taking part in that important subscription
when she was miles away and absolutely bankrupt. She had given
her last mite to help purchase a typewriter for her little author
lady.</p>

<p>But while the nurse was making her ready for the night, a sudden
thought came to her, and holding up the slender finger on which
gleamed her birthday ring, one of her most prized possessions,
she asked, "How much do rings cost, Miss Keith?"</p>

<p>"Rings like yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not much of a judge of jewelry, but I should say that
was worth maybe ten or fifteen dollars. That stone looks like
a real ruby."</p>

<p>"'Tis a real ruby, though 'tain't very big."</p>

<p>"I never owned but one ring in my life, and that was a plain
band. I don't know anything about precious stones, but no doubt
your ring cost a pretty penny."</p>

<p>When she had gone on to her next charge, Peace sat warily up
in bed, snatched paper and pencil from the stand close by and
scribbled a brief and hurried note, which read:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Deer Bishup,<br/>
&mdash;I can't be at church Sunday when you take up a<br/>
subscription to build some more Danbury Hospittle, cause I am in the<br/>
hospittle myself, and I have spent all my money. Nurse says my ruby ring<br/>
which Grandpa gave me on my last birthday cost as much as 10 or 15<br/>
dolars; so I am sending my ring for your collection. You can sell it to<br/>
some honest jueler and give the Money to the hospittle. It has been worn<br/>
only a little while for my birthday was New Years, and I've been in the<br/>
hospittle ever since, so the ring is reely as good as new. I would sell<br/>
it myself if I could get out but I can't.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours truly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>PEACE GREENFIELD</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>When the bishop rose to face the select and fashionable audience
in the South Avenue Church the following Sabbath Day, his heart
misgave him. What message could he bring to this people which
would open their hearts and pocketbooks to help in the Lord's
great work? He had prepared a most careful and elaborate sermon
for the occasion, but as he stood looking down into that sea of
critical faces before him, he realized that here was a people
who needed a soul's awakening, and with a sudden determination
he cast aside his scholarly efforts, and drawing from his pocket
a hastily scrawled letter and a small, ruby ring, he told their
simple story so beautifully and so well that purse-strings, as
well as heart-strings, responded instantly, and the following
day a telegram reached Danbury Hospital which read, "Fifteen thousand
dollars subscribed at South Avenue Church. Thank God for our 'Peace
which passeth understanding.'"</p>

<p>The hospital staff was at a loss to explain these strange words
until a visit from the bishop himself made everything clear. Then
great was the rejoicing, for instinctively each heart knew that
the simple little ring had won the fight. The story of its giving
was an "open Sesame" wherever it was told, and the much needed
addition to Danbury Hospital was made possible through the sacrifice
of one childish heart's dearest treasure.</p>

<p>Verily, "A little child shall lead them."</p>
