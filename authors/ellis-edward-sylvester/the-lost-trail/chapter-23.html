<p>The terrifying walk of Otto Relstaub ended sooner and more agreeably
than he anticipated.  He had in fact gone but a short ways when
he became aware that the Osage had a definite destination before
him. A light flashed out from the gloom in front, vanishing before
the boy could locate it.  A few steps further and it reappeared,
again dropping from sight.</p>

<p>Otto was walking slowly, intently peering in the direction and
naturally wondering what it all meant, when, as he moved slightly
to the left, it once more came to view.  This showed that it was
visible only when approached along a certain line.  It was not
an ordinary camp-fire, but the light flitted in and out of sight,
on account of the objects intervening between it and the spectator;
there was absolutely but a single line of advance which would
keep it in view.</p>

<p>The Indian gave no expression to his views, but the rustling
leaves told that he was still treading on the heels of the lad,
who knew that so long as he walked straight toward the light,
he was following the wishes of his master.</p>

<p>Suddenly something flitted in front of the blaze, as though a
person had stepped quickly past.  But Otto had secured the range,
so to speak, and so far as the trees and undergrowth permit, he
advanced in a direct line.  The distance being short, the whole
thing speedily became clear to him.</p>

<p>The fire was burning within and at the further side of a wigwam,
and was first seen through the opening which served as an entrance.
Thus it was that when he diverged to the right or left it was
shut from sight.</p>

<p>"It ish, de vigvam of him," thought Otto, "ish going to takes
me mit dere, and pieces to makes de childrens laugh."</p>

<p>The boy softly returned the knife to its place, for he was anxious
that the chieftain should see no signs of fear on his part.  A
few steps further and he stopped in front of the door of the lodge,
afraid to enter until something more was said by his master.</p>

<p>The entrance of Otto into the aboriginal home was anything but
dignified.  The proprietor observing that he had halted, gave
him such a powerful shove that he sprawled headlong in the middle
of the "apartment."</p>

<p>"Oof!" grunted the sachem, bending his head so as to push his
body through the opening, which was not closed after him; "lazy
dog!"</p>

<p>Otto did not think it wise to dispute the question.  He was not
hurt by the fall, and rising, stepped back against the side of
the lodge and took a good view of his surroundings.</p>

<p>The wigwam of the Osage chieftain was similar to those which
may be found to-day on the slopes of the Rocky Mountains, in the
depths of the wilderness along the Assiniboine, on the shores
of Athabasca Lake in the far North, and beyond the Llano Estacado
of the South. It was modeled in the same style that was fashionable
when Columbus saw the lights of the New World twinkling through
the gloom of the night across the unknown sea, and which will
prevail so long as the American Indian roams the woods and wields
the tomahawk.</p>

<p>A half dozen poles were pushed into the ground in a rude circle,
so as to include a space between four and five yards in diameter. 
The tops of the poles joined, as do the bayonets of muskets when
stacked. This framework was covered with the skins of bison and
deer, sewed together with the sinews of the latter.  At the peak
of the roof was an opening a foot in diameter, partly filled by
the network of poles there locked together. This answered for
a chimney to the fire kindled at one side of the lodge.</p>

<p>Directly opposite the fireplace (if it may be called that), was
the opening which served as a door, there being no other outlet
except the one named.  The deer-skin could be flung back or allowed
to hang down.  If the wind set it to flapping, it was pinned fast
with a knife or sharp stick.</p>

<p>The ground in most places was covered with bison-skins, so that
in moderately cold weather they were comfortable and pleasant
to sit and recline upon.  The skins composing the sides of the
wigwam were soiled with smoke, grease and dirt for alas! nearly
all the romance and charm enveloping the American Indian is dissipated
at first sight by his frightful lack of cleanliness.</p>

<p>But Otto Relstaub had viewed the interior of Indian wigwams before,
and his interest was fixed upon the occupants, of whom there were
three beside himself.  The squaw or wife of the chief was at the
further end, or rather the side opposite the door, busy broiling
two slices of venison on the coals.  She had no kettle, pan, knife
or fork in the lodge, her sole implement being a sharpened stick,
scarcely a foot in length, which she used in turning and handling
the meat.</p>

<p>When Otto came tumbling through the door, the mistress was in
the act of lifting one of the slices from the coals.  She was
on her knees, and paused for a second with the meat in air, while
she glanced around to see whether her lord and master had been
imbibing too much fire-water.  One glance was enough, and she
turned back and gave her attention to the culinary operations.</p>

<p>She wore moccasins, leggings, and a species of loose hunting-shirt,
tied with a cord about the waist, and which protected her-body
quite well, though the deer-skin composing it looked as if it
had served as a part of the wigwam for a number of years.  Her
long, black hair dangled about her shoulders, as did that of her
husband, and she was no more cleanly in her person than was he.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting object in the place was an Indian
infant, less than a year old, which lay on a bison-robe not far
from the fire.  It was a male, too young to walk, though it had
been freed from the coffin-like cradle in which the aboriginal
babies are strapped and carried on the backs of their mothers.</p>

<p>The little fellow was covered to his arm-pits, the bare arms
lying outside on the bison-robe.  He kept these going in an awkward,
spasmodic fashion, which caused the infantile fist now and then
to land in his eye.  On such occasions the organ winked very suddenly,
and the boy seemed to start with a gasp of surprise, but he did
not cry.  Young as he was, he had been trained in the iron school
which makes the American Indian indifferent to suffering and torture.</p>

<p>This aboriginal youth showed more interest in the new arrival
than did any one else.  His fists became motionless, his head
flapped over on one side, and the twinkling black eyes were fixed
upon Otto as though they would read him through.  If we could
recall the fancies that flitted through our brains at that early
stage of existence, what a wonderful kaleidoscope it would present!</p>

<p>The limits of the wigwam were so moderate that the sachem was
compelled to lay aside most of his dignity. Seating himself on
a robe, just across from their guest, he said something to his
squaw, and then, leaning back, with his legs crossed and his arms
folded, he placidly smoked his pipe and awaited supper.  The wife
answered with what sounded like a half dozen grunts, but did not
look around or cease giving her full attention to the broiling
venison.</p>

<p>The prisoner observed a long, fine-looking rifle leaning against
one side of the wigwam, the powder-horn and bullet-pouch on the
ground near the stock.  Beside them, a bow as long and powerful
as that of Deerfoot; and a quiver half full of arrows also lay
on the earth. Like the Shawanoe, the Osage was an adept in the
use of both weapons.</p>

<p>In addition to the furniture referred to, a few cast-off garments
of the owners were flung on one side, while some additional pieces
of venison lay upon, or rather among, a mass of leaves, where
they could be found when needed.  The smoke from the fire found
its way through the opening in the roof, and the vapor from the
pipe of the Osage, after slowly winding above his head, seemed
to lean off to one side and grope its way toward the same vent. 
A partial draught was created through the door of the wigwam,
by which the impure air was carried away, and the interior rendered
much more pleasant than would be supposed.</p>

<p>Like a true native American gentleman, the chieftain sat calmly
enjoying his pipe, while his wife did the work of the household,
and she, in accordance with universal law, accepted the drudgery
as one of the necessities of existence.</p>

<p>There were some facts respecting the Indian wigwam and its owner
which may as well be stated in this place.  The red man had been
a chief of the Osage tribe, but a violent quarrel with his people
caused him to withdraw, and he was living entirely alone in the
woods with his family.  The village where he had reigned so long
was miles distant.  He had a number of partisans who occasionally
called at his "residence" to see and urge him to return, but he
continued sulking in his tent, smoked his awful pipe, and shook
his head to all their appeals.</p>

<p>The wigwam, while similar in shape to the hundreds still to be
found in the wilderness of the North American continent differed
in some respects, while retaining the same general form.  Many
a lodge contains but the single ridge-pole, standing in the centre
of the structure, which, in the shape of a cone, is gathered at
the top and spreads out at the bottom, where it is fastened in
place by pegs, similar to those of the ordinary army tent.</p>

<p>Otto Relstaub, being relieved from his fear of instant death,
became sensitive to the appetizing odor of the broiling deer-steaks,
and looked longingly toward the unattractive cook, whose only
redeeming feature was the beauty of her teeth, which were as regular
and almost as white as those of Deerfoot.</p>

<p>When, a few minutes later, the slices of meat were ready, the
squaw flung one to her master, who dextrously caught it with his
right hand while he removed the pipe with the other.  Laying the
latter on the ground beside him, he began eating his supper, using
both hands, much as a bear employs his paws.</p>

<p>The wife devoured her share in the same manner, the two forming
a striking, but by no means attractive, picture.  The meat was
obviously tough, but their teeth were equal to the work, and plates,
knives and forks would have been only an encumbrance.</p>

<p>While the mother was thus occupied, she kept looking across at
her baby, who seemed to be watching her with comical wishfulness.
By-and-by, the parent gave a flirt of her hand, and a piece of
the venison, which she had bitten off, went flying toward the
head of the youngster.  He made an awkward grab with both hands,
but it landed on his pug nose.  He quickly found it, and shoving
it between his lips, began fiercely sucking and tugging, as though
it afforded the most delicious nourishment, which undoubtedly
was fact.</p>

<p>"I dinks they have forgot me," Otto said himself, with a sigh;
"I vish dot she would fro me a piece of dot, and see whedder she
could hit mine nose; yaw &mdash;Id just open mine mouth and cotch
him on de fly."</p>

<p>The lad had seated himself with his back against the side of
the wigwam, and no one could have looked at his face and failed
to know he was as hungry as one of his years could well be.  Had
the people possessed more food than they wished, and had it been
cooked, it is possible they would have tossed him a piece, but,
as it was, they had no intention of doing anything of the kind,
as Otto plainly saw.</p>

<p>"They am pigs," he said, taking care that the huge chief did
not overhear his muttered words; "if I starve, dey will sot dere
and laugh at me till they dies."</p>

<p>The meat soon vanished, and then the squaw began fumbling among
the leaves where the uncooked venison lay.  Otto's eyes sparkled
with hope.</p>

<p>"She is going to cook mit a piece for meawh!"</p>

<p>Instead of food, she fished out a pipe, similar to that of her
master.  Walking to him she held out her hand, and he passed over
a pouch of tobacco, from which she filled the bowl of her pipe,
punching in and compressing the stuff with her forefinger.  Then
it was lighted, with a coal of fire which she deftly scooped up,
and sitting, so that she faced her guest, she crossed her feet,
and leaning her elbows on her knees, stared at him, the picture
of enjoyment, as she puffed her pipe.  At the same time, the baby
eagerly sucked and chewed his bit of meat, and, no doubt, was
as happy as its parents.</p>

<p>But this had continued only a few minutes, when all the adults
started, for footsteps on the outside showed that some one was
approaching the wigwam.</p>
