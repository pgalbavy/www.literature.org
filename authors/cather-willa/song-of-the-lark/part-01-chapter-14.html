<p>“Mother,” said Peter Kronborg to his wife one morning about two weeks
after Wunsch's departure, “how would you like to drive out to Copper
Hole with me to-day?”
</p><p>Mrs. Kronborg said she thought she would enjoy the drive. She put on her
gray cashmere dress and gold watch and chain, as befitted a minister's
wife, and while her husband was dressing she packed a black oilcloth
satchel with such clothing as she and Thor would need overnight.
</p><p>Copper Hole was a settlement fifteen miles northwest of Moonstone where
Mr. Kronborg preached every Friday evening. There was a big spring there
and a creek and a few irrigating ditches. It was a community of
discouraged agriculturists who had disastrously experimented with dry
farming. Mr. Kronborg always drove out one day and back the next,
spending the night with one of his parishioners. Often, when the weather
was fine, his wife accompanied him. To-day they set out from home after
the midday meal, leaving Tillie in charge of the house. Mrs. Kronborg's
maternal feeling was always garnered up in the baby, whoever the baby
happened to be. If she had the baby with her, the others could look out
for themselves. Thor, of course, was not, accurately speaking, a baby
any longer. In the matter of nourishment he was quite independent of his
mother, though this independence had not been won without a struggle.
Thor was conservative in all things, and the whole family had anguished
with him when he was being weaned. Being the youngest, he was still the
baby for Mrs. Kronborg, though he was nearly four years old and sat up
boldly on her lap this afternoon, holding on to the ends of the lines
and shouting “'mup, 'mup, horsey.” His father watched him affectionately
and hummed hymn tunes in the jovial way that was sometimes such a trial
to Thea.
</p><p>Mrs. Kronborg was enjoying the sunshine and the brilliant sky and all
the faintly marked features of the dazzling, monotonous landscape. She
had a rather unusual capacity for getting the flavor of places and of
people. Although she was so enmeshed in family cares most of the time,
she could emerge serene when she was away from them. For a mother of
seven, she had a singularly unprejudiced point of view. She was,
moreover, a fatalist, and as she did not attempt to direct things beyond
her control, she found a good deal of time to enjoy the ways of man and
nature.
</p><p>When they were well upon their road, out where the first lean pasture
lands began and the sand grass made a faint showing between the
sagebrushes, Mr. Kronborg dropped his tune and turned to his wife.
“Mother, I've been thinking about something.”
</p><p>“I guessed you had. What is it?” She shifted Thor to her left knee,
where he would be more out of the way.
</p><p>“Well, it's about Thea. Mr. Follansbee came to my study at the church
the other day and said they would like to have their two girls take
lessons of Thea. Then I sounded Miss Meyers” (Miss Meyers was the
organist in Mr. Kronborg's church) “and she said there was a good deal
of talk about whether Thea wouldn't take over Wunsch's pupils. She said
if Thea stopped school she wouldn't wonder if she could get pretty much
all Wunsch's class. People think Thea knows about all Wunsch could
teach.”
</p><p>Mrs. Kronborg looked thoughtful. “Do you think we ought to take her out
of school so young?”
</p><p>“She is young, but next year would be her last year anyway. She's far
along for her age. And she can't learn much under the principal we've
got now, can she?”
</p><p>“No, I'm afraid she can't,” his wife admitted. “She frets a good deal
and says that man always has to look in the back of the book for the
answers. She hates all that diagramming they have to do, and I think
myself it's a waste of time.”
</p><p>Mr. Kronborg settled himself back into the seat and slowed the mare to a
walk. “You see, it occurs to me that we might raise Thea's prices, so it
would be worth her while. Seventy-five cents for hour lessons, fifty
cents for half-hour lessons. If she got, say two thirds of Wunsch's
class, that would bring her in upwards of ten dollars a week. Better pay
than teaching a country school, and there would be more work in vacation
than in winter. Steady work twelve months in the year; that's an
advantage. And she'd be living at home, with no expenses.”
</p><p>“There'd be talk if you raised her prices,” said Mrs. Kronborg
dubiously.
</p><p>“At first there would. But Thea is so much the best musician in town
that they'd all come into line after a while. A good many people in
Moonstone have been making money lately, and have bought new pianos.
There were ten new pianos shipped in here from Denver in the last year.
People ain't going to let them stand idle; too much money invested. I
believe Thea can have as many scholars as she can handle, if we set her
up a little.”
</p><p>“How set her up, do you mean?” Mrs. Kronborg felt a certain reluctance
about accepting this plan, though she had not yet had time to think out
her reasons.
</p><p>“Well, I've been thinking for some time we could make good use of
another room. We couldn't give up the parlor to her all the time. If we
built another room on the ell and put the piano in there, she could give
lessons all day long and it wouldn't bother us. We could build a
clothes-press in it, and put in a bed-lounge and a dresser and let Anna
have it for her sleeping-room. She needs a place of her own, now that
she's beginning to be dressy.”
</p><p>“Seems like Thea ought to have the choice of the room, herself,” said
Mrs. Kronborg.
</p><p>“But, my dear, she don't want it. Won't have it. I sounded her coming
home from church on Sunday; asked her if she would like to sleep in a
new room, if we built on. She fired up like a little wild-cat and said
she'd made her own room all herself, and she didn't think anybody ought
to take it away from her.”
</p><p>“She don't mean to be impertinent, father. She's made decided that way,
like my father.” Mrs. Kronborg spoke warmly. “I never have any trouble
with the child. I remember my father's ways and go at her carefully.
Thea's all right.”
</p><p>Mr. Kronborg laughed indulgently and pinched Thor's full cheek. “Oh, I
didn't mean anything against your girl, mother! She's all right, but
she's a little wild-cat, just the same. I think Ray Kennedy's planning
to spoil a born old maid.”
</p><p>“Huh! She'll get something a good sight better than Ray Kennedy, you
see! Thea's an awful smart girl. I've seen a good many girls take music
lessons in my time, but I ain't seen one that took to it so. Wunsch said
so, too. She's got the making of something in her.”
</p><p>“I don't deny that, and the sooner she gets at it in a businesslike way,
the better. She's the kind that takes responsibility, and it'll be good
for her.”
</p><p>Mrs. Kronborg was thoughtful. “In some ways it will, maybe. But there's
a good deal of strain about teaching youngsters, and she's always worked
so hard with the scholars she has. I've often listened to her pounding
it into 'em. I don't want to work her too hard. She's so serious that
she's never had what you might call any real childhood. Seems like she
ought to have the next few years sort of free and easy. She'll be tied
down with responsibilities soon enough.”
</p><p>Mr. Kronborg patted his wife's arm. “Don't you believe it, mother. Thea
is not the marrying kind. I've watched 'em. Anna will marry before long
and make a good wife, but I don't see Thea bringing up a family. She's
got a good deal of her mother in her, but she hasn't got all. She's too
peppery and too fond of having her own way. Then she's always got to be
ahead in everything. That kind make good church-workers and missionaries
and school teachers, but they don't make good wives. They fret all their
energy away, like colts, and get cut on the wire.”
</p><p>Mrs. Kronborg laughed. “Give me the graham crackers I put in your pocket
for Thor. He's hungry. You're a funny man, Peter. A body wouldn't think,
to hear you, you was talking about your own daughters. I guess you see
through 'em. Still, even if Thea ain't apt to have children of her own,
I don't know as that's a good reason why she should wear herself out on
other people's.”
</p><p>“That's just the point, mother. A girl with all that energy has got to
do something, same as a boy, to keep her out of mischief. If you don't
want her to marry Ray, let her do something to make herself
independent.”
</p><p>“Well, I'm not against it. It might be the best thing for her. I wish I
felt sure she wouldn't worry. She takes things hard. She nearly cried
herself sick about Wunsch's going away. She's the smartest child of 'em
all, Peter, by a long ways.”
</p><p>Peter Kronborg smiled. “There you go, Anna. That's you all over again.
Now, I have no favorites; they all have their good points. But you,”
 with a twinkle, “always did go in for brains.”
</p><p>Mrs. Kronborg chuckled as she wiped the cracker crumbs from Thor's chin
and fists. “Well, you're mighty conceited, Peter! But I don't know as I
ever regretted it. I prefer having a family of my own to fussing with
other folks' children, that's the truth.”
</p><p>Before the Kronborgs reached Copper Hole, Thea's destiny was pretty well
mapped out for her. Mr. Kronborg was always delighted to have an excuse
for enlarging the house.
</p><p>Mrs. Kronborg was quite right in her conjecture that there would be
unfriendly comment in Moonstone when Thea raised her prices for
music-lessons. People said she was getting too conceited for anything.
Mrs. Livery Johnson put on a new bonnet and paid up all her back calls
to have the pleasure of announcing in each parlor she entered that her
daughters, at least, would “never pay professional prices to Thea
Kronborg.”
</p><p>Thea raised no objection to quitting school. She was now in the “high
room,” as it was called, in next to the highest class, and was studying
geometry and beginning Caesar. She no longer recited her lessons to the
teacher she liked, but to the Principal, a man who belonged, like Mrs.
Livery Johnson, to the camp of Thea's natural enemies. He taught school
because he was too lazy to work among grown-up people, and he made an
easy job of it. He got out of real work by inventing useless activities
for his pupils, such as the “tree-diagramming system.” Thea had spent
hours making trees out of “Thanatopsis,” Hamlet's soliloquy, Cato on
“Immortality.” She agonized under this waste of time, and was only too
glad to accept her father's offer of liberty.
</p><p>So Thea left school the first of November. By the first of January she
had eight one-hour pupils and ten half-hour pupils, and there would be
more in the summer. She spent her earnings generously. She bought a new
Brussels carpet for the parlor, and a rifle for Gunner and Axel, and an
imitation tiger-skin coat and cap for Thor. She enjoyed being able to
add to the family possessions, and thought Thor looked quite as handsome
in his spots as the rich children she had seen in Denver. Thor was most
complacent in his conspicuous apparel. He could walk anywhere by this
time--though he always preferred to sit, or to be pulled in his cart. He
was a blissfully lazy child, and had a number of long, dull plays, such
as making nests for his china duck and waiting for her to lay him an
egg. Thea thought him very intelligent, and she was proud that he was so
big and burly. She found him restful, loved to hear him call her
“sitter,” and really liked his companionship, especially when she was
tired. On Saturday, for instance, when she taught from nine in the
morning until five in the afternoon, she liked to get off in a corner
with Thor after supper, away from all the bathing and dressing and
joking and talking that went on in the house, and ask him about his
duck, or hear him tell one of his rambling stories.
