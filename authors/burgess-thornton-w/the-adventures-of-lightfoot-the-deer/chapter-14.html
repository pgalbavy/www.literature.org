<p>It was a queer partnership, that partnership between Lightfoot
and Paddy, but it was a good partnership. They had been the best
of friends for a long time. Paddy had always been glad to have
Lightfoot visit his pond. To tell the truth, he was rather fond
of handsome Lightfoot. You know Paddy is himself not at all handsome.
On land he is a rather clumsy-looking fellow and really homely.
So he admired Lightfoot greatly. That is one reason why he proposed
that they be partners.</p>

<p>Lightfoot himself thought the idea a splendid one. He spent that
night browsing not far from Paddy's pond. With the coming of daylight
he lay down in a thicket of young hemlock-trees near the upper
end of the pond. It was a quiet, peaceful day. It was so quiet
and peaceful and beautiful it was hard to believe that hunters
with terrible guns were searching the Green Forest for beautiful
Lightfoot. But they were, and Lightfoot knew that sooner or later
one of them would be sure to visit Paddy's pond. So, though he
rested and took short naps all through that beautiful day, he
was anxious. He couldn't help but be.</p>

<p>The next morning found Lightfoot back in the same place. But
this morning he took no naps. He rested, but all the time he was
watchful and alert. A feeling of uneasiness possessed him. He
felt in his bones that danger in the shape of a hunter with a
terrible gun was not far distant.</p>

<p>But the hours slipped away, and little by little he grew less
uneasy. He began to hope that that day would prove as peaceful
as the previous day had been. Then suddenly there was a sharp
report from the farther end of Paddy's pond. It was almost like
a pistol shot. However, it wasn't a pistol shot. It wasn't a shot
at all. It was the slap of Paddy's broad tail on the surface of
the water. Instantly Lightfoot was on his feet. He knew just what
that meant. He knew that Paddy had seen or heard or smelled a
hunter.</p>

<p>It was even so. Paddy had heard a dry stick snap. It was a very
tiny snap, but it was enough to warn Paddy. With only his head
above water he had watched in the direction from which that sound
had come. Presently, stealing quietly along towards the pond,
a hunter had come in view. Instantly, Paddy had brought his broad
tail down on the water with all his force. He knew that Lightfoot
would know that that meant danger. Then Paddy had dived, and swimming
under water, had sought the safety of his house. He had done his
part, and there was nothing more he could do.</p>
