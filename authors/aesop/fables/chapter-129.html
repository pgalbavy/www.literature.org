A FISHERMAN who lived on the produce of his nets, one day caught
a single small Fish as the result of his day's labor.  The Fish,
panting convulsively, thus entreated for his life:  "O Sir, what
good can I be to you, and how little am I worth? I am not yet
come to my full size.  Pray spare my life, and put me back into
the sea.  I shall soon become a large fish fit for the tables of
the rich, and then you can catch me again, and make a handsome
profit of me."  The Fisherman replied, "I should indeed be a very
simple fellow if, for the chance of a greater uncertain profit, I
were to forego my present certain gain."
